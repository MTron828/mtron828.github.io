Chapter 676: Did He Mind So Much?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian put her phone into her bag. Just as she was about to speak, she heard Lu Nian ask.

“Why does he care so much?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

If Second Brother didn’t know that she was Sugar, he would have urged her to go back early.

Now that she had acknowledged Second Brother, he stood on her side without hesitation.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. Smiling, she explained for Gu Zhou, “It’s already past one in the morning. He might think that it’s too late and want me to go back and rest early!”

When Lu Nian heard Qiao Nian’s words, he felt a little better.

That made sense. One couldn’t stay up late often. It wasn’t good for one’s health.

His sister should go back early to rest.

At the thought of this, Lu Nian asked with a complicated expression, “Does Second Brother treat you well?”

Hearing Lu Nian’s question, Qiao Nian recalled that in MY, she had been in a stalemate with Jiang Chi’s men. Then, at this moment, Gu Zhou had brought a large number of tanks to save her.

The sunlight shone on Gu Zhou’s face, and the breeze blew up the hair on his forehead.

Gu Zhou stood on the tank, wearing a black windbreaker. He looked tired and travel-worn.

Even so, his eyes were filled with determination.

If Gu Zhou hadn’t appeared, the situation that day might have been out of control.

At that time, Gu Zhou was like a god, saving her and her brother.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. When she came back to her senses, she hurriedly pursed her lips and said calmly, “He treats me very well.”

Lu Nian sized Qiao Nian up.

He knew very well that Sugar meant what she said. She wasn’t lying.

Similarly, Lu Nian knew Gu Zhou very well.

The two of them had grown up together. He knew very well that Second Brother was very slow when it came to relationships. Moreover, Second Brother had an aversion to women.

Although Second Brother was not against Sugar now, this did not mean that he could accept her.

However, it was hard to say what was going on between men and women. Lu Nian did not want to interfere in the relationship between Second Brother and Sugar, but he would never allow Second Brother to hurt Sugar.

However, he was too embarrassed to say such things. He looked at Qiao Nian seriously and instructed, “Alright, if he treats you badly, tell me. I’ll seek justice for you!”

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Nian’s expression and knew that he was serious. She smiled and said, “No matter what, he is still your Second Brother. You can’t be so unprincipled. You should treat him fairly.”

If Qiao Nian was really just his adopted sister, Lu Nian naturally had to treat her fairly.

But now, when he found out that Qiao Nian was Sugar, he was biased.

“Sugar, Second Brother has no principles with you,” Lu Nian said seriously. Although this sentence was a little mushy, it was indeed his truest thought.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, she couldn’t help but smile. Her beautiful fox-like eyes were filled with sweetness.

“Thank you, Second Brother. If Gu Zhou bullies me, I’ll definitely tell you!” Qiao Nian said coquettishly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Okay.” Seeing that Qiao Nian had already stood up with her bag, Lu Nian couldn’t bear to part with her, but he had no choice but to send her off. “Hurry up!”

“Second Brother, I’ll leave first!” Qiao Nian waved at Lu Nian. When she passed by Lu Zhu, a bright smile appeared on her face. “Brother, goodbye!”

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian stood rooted to the ground, watching Qiao Nian leave reluctantly.

Qiao Nian quickly walked out. When she walked out of Yongan Building, she saw Gu Zhou standing in front of the car.

Gu Zhou leaned lazily against the car. When he saw Qiao Nian come out, he slowly stood up straight.

When Qiao Nian saw Gu Zhou, her heart couldn’t help but race. She jogged up to Gu Zhou and finally saw his expression clearly.

The moonlight shone on his face, making him look even paler.

His facial features were well-defined, and the contours of his face were much gentler under the moonlight. No matter what time this man appeared, he would make one’s heart race.
