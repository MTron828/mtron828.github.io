Chapter 688: Not Noisy

She took a change of clothes into the bathroom, took off her clothes, and walked under the showerhead.

Sensing her approach, the showerhead automatically released warm water.

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground, feeling the hot water fall on her head. She slowly closed her eyes, surrounded by warmth. She felt an indescribable sense of security.

Her hand inadvertently slid across her lips, and she recalled that she had taken the initiative to kiss Zhou Zhou just now.

She still seemed to be able to feel the softness of Zhou Zhou’s lips.

Her throat moved involuntarily. She hurriedly opened her eyes and tried her best to forget the ambiguous scene in her mind.

Strange, why would someone like Gu Zhou have an inferiority complex in his childhood?

Could it be that Gu Zhou had been very insecure when he was young?

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly. She had to investigate what had happened to Gu Zhou when he was young.

Perhaps after she investigated thoroughly, Gu Zhou’s Zhou Zhou personality might fuse with Gu Zhou’s.

As Qiao Nian planned, she took a shower. After taking a shower, she wiped her body and walked out. As soon as she opened the bathroom door, she found someone standing there.

Qiao Nian gasped and clutched her chest with one hand. She knew that it was him, but she was still shocked.

It must be the aftereffects of her forcing a kiss on Zhou Zhou. She was feeling guilty!

Qiao Nian glanced at his gray pajamas and slowly looked up. Before she could confirm who he was, she realized that he was taking a step towards her.

At this moment, the two of them were only a foot apart.

This distance made Qiao Nian feel uneasy and oppressed. She silently took a step back and stared unblinkingly into his eyes.

His gaze was extremely deep.

Zhou Zhou’s gaze was innocent. In other words, the person standing in front of her was not Zhou Zhou.

Was it Gu Zhou or Gu Chuan?

Qiao Nian was really curious about how his personality had switched.

Qiao Nian’s mind raced. As long as she didn’t call anyone by their name, it shouldn’t be a big deal.

“Why are you here?” Qiao Nian asked, still staring at Gu Zhou.

He looked down at Qiao Nian and asked in a gentle and calm voice, “Are you afraid of me?”

“No.” Qiao Nian hurriedly shook her head and said, “I thought you were asleep. I didn’t expect you to come over.”

“I’m awake.” Gu Zhou’s expression changed slightly. He remembered sitting in the pavilion previously, but he couldn’t remember anything after that. “I heard some movement in your room, so I came over.”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly, staring unblinkingly at the man in front of her.

That’s right, this was Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou was usually abstinent, and his voice was calm and steady.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Gu Zhou should have completely forgotten about Zhou Zhou, just like before.

While Qiao Nian was deep in thought, her hand was grabbed.

Qiao Nian gasped and looked up at Gu Zhou. Instinctively, she wanted to pull her hand away, but she was afraid that Gu Zhou would be angry, so she didn’t.

The place he was holding was extremely hot. The heat flowed from her wrist to every part of her body. She did not retract her hand, but let Gu Zhou hold her hand.

“Why are you taking a bath here?”

Qiao Nian’s heart instantly tightened. Could it be that Gu Zhou had Zhou Zhou’s memories?

Or was Gu Zhou just asking casually?

A faint smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face as she casually explained, “At that time, you were asleep. I was worried that I would wake you up, so I came here.”

“It’s not noisy!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked up at him and accidentally met his dark eyes.

There seemed to be a hint of gentleness in his eyes compared to usual.

Why had Gu Zhou suddenly become so gentle?

Qiao Nian didn’t dare to speak. She could only obediently follow Gu Zhou out.

When she returned to Gu Zhou’s room, she noticed that Gu Zhou had closed the door. Her heart began to race.

Qiao Nian asked carefully, “Shouldn’t we sleep separately?”

“Huh?”

“Xiao Qi is still at home. If he finds out that we’re sleeping together, won’t he be unhappy?” As Qiao Nian spoke, she reached out to open the door.

“No,” Gu Zhou said.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

“He likes you.”

Qiao Nian smiled and continued, “But being his aunt and being his stepmother are different for him.”

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze slightly to look at Qiao Nian. His eyes were calm as he raised his hand to stroke her face.
