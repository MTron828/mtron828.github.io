1404 Hypnotic Worm

Auntie Cao looked at Qiao Nian in confusion, then at Uncle Zhao worriedly.

Qiao Nian came out of Uncle Zhao’s room and went straight to the Lu family’s living room. Everyone in the living room didn’t look well.

It was true that they had caught the traitor, but they had yet to get the mastermind out of Uncle Zhao.

When Qiao Nian walked in, everyone’s gaze was on her face. Gu Zhou was sitting on an armchair, staring unblinkingly at her.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She walked over to Gu Zhou and sat on the armrest of the sofa beside him.

Matriarch Lu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Frowning, she asked, “Nian Nian, how’s Old Zhao now?”

Matriarch Lu’s emotions were complicated. She was very worried about Old Zhao. Part of the reason was that she wanted to find out who was behind this through Old Zhao, and another part was because she cared a little about Old Zhao.

She didn’t sleep well last night. Her dreams were filled with what happened when Old Zhao was in the Lu family. When she woke up, she still couldn’t believe that Old Zhao was a traitor.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and said, “I’ve seen similar cases in books regarding Uncle Zhao’s condition. It’s been too long. I’m afraid my memory is wrong.”

“What do you mean?” Matriarch Lu asked in confusion.

“If I remember correctly, he must have been drugged with a hypnotic worm,” Qiao Nian said, pursing her lips.

“Hypnotic Worm? What’s that?” Matriarch Lu looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

“The hypnotic worm is a kind of worm in the southern borders. Those who are infected with the child worm will listen to the master of the mother worm obediently.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “Even if the master of the mother worm changes the memories of the person who is infected with the child worm, the person who is infected will listen obediently.”

“Are you saying that he was poisoned by a worm?” Matriarch Lu asked in surprise.

“I’m not sure either, but there are indeed hypnotic worms in his body. I want to make a trip to Qin Chuan’s house and find books about hypnotic worms. Then, I’ll be able to confirm if Uncle Zhao has really been poisoned with the hypnotic worm,” Qiao Nian said solemnly.

When she was young, she had flipped through her grandfather’s books and seen records of hypnotic worms.

At that time, her grandfather had taken the book out of her hand and said that there were not many hypnotic worms left. There was no need to study hypnotic worms anymore.

Qiao Nian thought that it was the same logic, so she stopped reading. At that time, she happened to see an introduction of the hypnotic worm.

Matriarch Lu nodded. The others also turned serious. They had not expected someone to be poisoned.

It seemed that the person behind this could not be underestimated. Lu Zhu and Lu Nian looked at each other in unison, their eyes gradually becoming firm. There was only one thought in their minds. No matter how difficult the future path was, they had to do their best to protect the Lu family.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou went straight to Qin Chuan’s house. Qiao Nian’s fingerprints had been recorded in the lock of Qin Chuan’s door, so Qiao Nian entered without any effort.

She brought Gu Zhou to the study and scanned the bookcase. Finally, she saw the Encyclopedia of Voodoo in the corner of the bookcase.

Qiao Nian took out the book and found the “hypnotic worm” in the contents. Seeing the contents, she heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Let’s go now!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he followed her out. The two of them went to the Lu family again.

In the car, Qiao Nian read the contents of the book, her expression turning more and more serious. She turned to look at Gu Zhou and said solemnly, “This is going to be difficult!”

A trace of confusion flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes. He asked, “What happened?”

“I don’t think we’ll be able to find out the truth from Uncle Zhao,” Qiao Nian said with a frown.

“Why?”

“When the hypnotic worm is in Uncle Zhao’s body, he will protect his master wholeheartedly and definitely won’t leak anything. However, if we take the hypnotic worm out of Uncle Zhao’s body, Uncle Zhao’s memories when he was poisoned will disappear.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened. She gripped the book in her hand tightly. “Those people are really cautious. They didn’t leak anything. We have nowhere to investigate unless we find the source of the hypnotic worm.”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Qiao Nian continued, “According to the book, the last time the hypnotic worm appeared was 300 years ago. It was a young girl who refined the hypnotic worm who took the initiative to reveal it. Otherwise, no one would know that she had a hypnotic worm.”
