Chapter 314: Borrowing Money

However, this little girl had one hand in her pocket. For some reason, she looked a little cool.

The little girl frowned slightly, her thin lips pursed tightly, giving off a cold aura.

“You…” Qiao Nian had wanted to pull the little girl away, but the little girl avoided her hand, as if she didn’t like to interact with strangers. She squatted down and smiled at the little girl, asking with concern,” It’s so late. Why are you here alone? Your parents should be very worried about you. Can you tell Auntie where you live so that I can send you home? ”

The little girl looked at Qiao Nian steadily and said coldly, “Auntie, can you lend me ten dollars?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she asked, “Why do you want money?”

“I’m hungry.”

Qiao Nian looked at the little girl in front of her and seemed to recall her own child. If that child survived, he would probably be the same age as this little girl.

She would definitely treasure her child dearly. She would never let her child wander around and starve.

For some reason, Qiao Nian’s heart ached. She said gently, “There’s a porridge shop not far away. Auntie will take you there to eat. Is that okay?”

The little girl looked at Qiao Nian and hesitated, deep in thought.

Her father had told her in the past not to leave with strangers.

However, this auntie didn’t look like a bad person.

The little girl hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, “Okay.”

Before the little girl left, she glanced at Qiao Nian’s car plate number.

The porridge shop was not far away. According to the little girl’s wishes, Qiao Nian ordered porridge and a cabbage bun for her. She also ordered a bowl of porridge and ate it slowly.

After the little girl was full, she wiped her mouth with a tissue. She even handed Qiao Nian a tissue.

While Qiao Nian was paying the bill, she heard the little girl say to the boss, “Uncle, may I ask if you can give me a pen and paper to use?”

When the owner of the porridge shop heard a pleasant voice, his gaze fell on the little girl’s face and he smiled brightly. This was the first time he had seen such a cute little girl. He handed the pen and paper to the little girl.

Qiao Nian watched as the little girl walked to a table with a pen and paper. She sat on a stool and wrote seriously.

A four-year-old child could write?

Qiao Nian was a little surprised. After paying the bill, she walked over to the little girl and saw her handing the paper to her.

Puzzled, Qiao Nian took the piece of paper. Her eyes lit up when she saw the words on it.

The handwriting on the paper was still considered neat, but it was already very good for a four-year-old child.

Gu Qi owes you 15 yuan.

Gu Qi looked up at Qiao Nian and said, “Just now, the boss said that this meal would cost 15 yuan. Take it as my treat. Thank you for bringing me here.”

Qiao Nian looked at the IOU in her hand. This little girl was serious. She was only four years old.

Instinctively, she wanted to reject her. However, she thought about how Gu Qi would definitely be very upset if she did so.

Qiao Nian couldn’t bear to see her upset. She put the note away solemnly and said with a smile, “Then don’t forget!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Gu Qi nodded seriously and smiled.

Qiao Nian smiled as well. This was the first time Gu Qi had smiled at her. Although it was just a smile, she looked like an exquisite doll.

On the other side, the owner of the porridge shop looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

This lady looked quite rich. How could she be so stingy as to let a child treat her to a meal?

Holding her bag, Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi and said, “Alright, can you tell me where your house is now? I’ll send you back!”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she refused. “I can go home by myself.”

Qiao Nian was still worried when she heard Gu Qi’s words. Just as she was about to speak, she saw Gu Qi take out her phone. “I come here often, so I know the way home.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. “But…”
