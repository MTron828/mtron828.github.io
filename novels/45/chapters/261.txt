Chapter 262: Chasing an Idol

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes revealed a trace of confusion. “What is it?”

“Do you still remember the violin I gave you?” Matriarch Gu asked gently, smiling at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian nodded. “Yes.”

“Lu Nian made that violin himself.” Matriarch Gu glanced at Lu Nian and gave him a loving smile.

When Qiao Nian heard this, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She turned to look at Lu Nian’s fair and delicate hands.

It was hard to imagine that the exquisite violin was made by Lu Nian.

From Lu Nian’s appearance alone, he looked like a rich second-generation heir. Moreover, Lu Nian’s hands didn’t look like they were used in wood work at all.

Gu Zhou raised his wrist to look at the time. He had other things to do at the banquet, and did not have much time to waste. He looked up at Matriarch Gu and said helplessly, “Grandma, if you continue to keep us in suspense, when will we be able to have lunch?”

“Yes, yes.” Matriarch Gu covered her mouth and laughed.

Gu Zhou glanced at Lu Nian, who was standing beside him. His gaze finally landed on Qiao Nian’s face and he said, “Let me introduce you.”

Qiao Nian was a little stunned. Hadn’t Grandma already introduced them just now?

“He’s Mr. Dong Hua.” When Gu Zhou said this, it was as if he was saying that the weather was good today. His voice was extremely calm.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, the smile on her face froze. She looked at Lu Nian in disbelief. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He? Mr. Dong Hua?

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.

Wang Xuan’s mouth fell open in shock!

Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan looked at each other.

Qiao Nian felt as if she were in a dream. She tried hard to calm herself down, but her voice still revealed her excitement. “Is it really Mr. Dong Hua?”

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually turned cold. He had known from the beginning that Qiao Nian liked Mr. Dong Hua, but he had not expected Qiao Nian to have such a big reaction. She had actually lost her composure.

This was the first time he had seen Qiao Nian lose her composure.

Qiao Nian could see disdain in Gu Zhou’s eyes. At the same time, she was certain that Lu Nian was Mr. Dong Hua.

To be honest, her current state was indeed quite embarrassing, especially for Gu Zhou.

But what did that have to do with anything?

This was Mr. Dong Hua!

Her idol!

How could she not be excited?

This was a chance to chase her idol!

Qiao Nian now understood why Grandma had said that she would definitely want to meet this distinguished guest.

She could no longer control her emotions.

Since she couldn’t control them, she didn’t try to.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes were sparkling. She asked directly, “Mr. Dong Hua, may I have your autograph?”

Lu Nian’s gaze met Qiao Nian’s sparkling eyes. He couldn’t help but think of the little fox he had raised secretly eating meat.

Seeing that Lu Nian was silent, Qiao Nian thought that he was unwilling to extend a finger. She asked carefully, “Just one. Will that do?”

Lu Nian gasped.

Under such circumstances, who could withstand it?

However, before Qiao Nian could say anything, Gu Zhou had already walked up to her. Holding onto Qiao Nian’s shoulder, he walked towards the dining room and said, “I’m hungry now. Let’s eat!”

With that, Gu Zhou turned back to look at Lu Nian and said, “Sign your name on her violin.”

“Okay.”

Gu Zhou forcefully led Qiao Nian towards the dining room. Qiao Nian shifted her shoulders uncomfortably and turned to look at Gu Zhou, saying unhappily, “Put your hand down quickly. I can walk on my own.”

Only then did Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian. In a low voice, he said coldly, “Mrs. Gu, I think you need to learn how to manage your expressions again.”
