1373 Crossing the Water

Seeing Lu Qi lower her head in self-blame, Qin Chuan comforted her softly, “It’s fine if I don’t drink it.”

Hearing his hoarse voice, Lu Qi tightened her grip on the mineral water bottle. Then, her eyes gradually hardened. She looked up at Qin Chuan and asked seriously, “Senior, will you despise me?”

When Qin Chuan heard Lu Qi’s inexplicable words, he still shook his head. He was about to comfort Lu Qi not to blame herself for the bottle cap falling to the ground.

At this moment, Lu Qi drank from a mineral water bottle.

Before he could come back to his senses, he saw Lu Qi’s face grow larger and larger. A softness pressed against his lips.

Qin Chuan’s pupils instantly dilated. Before he could come back to his senses, he felt a chill in his mouth.

She… she had actually used her mouth to transfer the water to him.

Half a beat later, Qin Chuan realized what Lu Qi had meant by asking him that question.

Qin Chuan swallowed the water with difficulty, and his body instantly felt much better.

Lu Qi was very shy at first, but when she heard Qin Chuan swallow, she opened her eyes and looked at him. Her lips did not leave his.

Qin Chuan swallowed the water with difficulty, and his body instantly felt much better.

After the water in her mouth was finished, Lu Qi took a few steps back. Just as she was about to ask Qin Chuan if he still wanted to drink water, she saw Qin Chuan gently lick all the water from his mouth, as if he wanted more.

Lu Qi’s face was slightly red. She lowered her gaze and gripped the mineral water bottle in her hand tightly. She said anxiously, “Senior, actually, I just felt that you were especially thirsty. We had no other choice. I could only use this method to feed you water.”

Towards the end, Lu Qi’s voice grew softer and softer. “Don’t… don’t misunderstand.”

The light from the cell phone was very weak, but it could illuminate their faces. Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi’s red face and asked with a smile in his eyes, “Have you fed others like this?”

“How is that possible?” Lu Qi pouted and looked up at Qin Chuan, saying pitifully, “Senior Brother, you’re bullying me!”

Lu Qi pursed her lips. She was not such a casual person.

The reason why she treated her senior brother like this was because he had saved her life. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Compared to her senior brother’s life-saving grace, her first kiss was nothing.

Medically, it was said that giving artificial respiration to others was not considered kissing at all, but in all these years, she had never kissed anyone mouth to mouth.

She still felt that this was her first kiss!

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi’s angry expression and his lips curved up slightly.

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s laughter, she looked up and was about to scold him when she was slightly stunned.

When he smiled, his peach blossom eyes narrowed slightly. There was a roguish look in his eyes, and the curve of his lips seemed to be very seductive.

Lu Qi could hear her violent heartbeat. She looked at Qin Chuan in a daze, then came back to her senses and looked to the side.

Qin Chuan moved slightly, and a sharp pain came from his back. He gasped.

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s movements, she hurriedly looked at him and asked anxiously, “Senior Brother, what’s wrong?”

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi in front of him. Without a word, he moved again. The pain made his forehead covered in cold sweat, and his breathing quickened.

“Move the seat down,” Qin Chuan instructed.

Seeing Qin Chuan in pain, Lu Qi’s eyes turned red. She hurriedly said, “Senior Brother, don’t move around. The weight on your body has to be moved away bit by bit. If it’s all moved away at once, you’ll be in danger.”

Previously, she had wanted to move Senior Brother’s weight away bit by bit. That way, even if the pressure of the stone pressed down on Senior Brother’s internal organs, the harm would not be great.

If she adjusted the seat directly and the weight on it pressed down on Senior’s internal organs, wouldn’t Senior…

“Senior, I can’t adjust the seats…” Lu Qi shook her head gently and said anxiously.

“It’s not pressing down on my internal organs. Do as I… cough, cough… say,” Qin Chuan said weakly.

Only then did Lu Qi realize why Qin Chuan had been turning his body just now. Now, it seemed that he must have been judging if his internal organs were injured.
