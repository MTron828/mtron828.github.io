Chapter 1740 - 1740 Monster!

Wright laughed wantonly, but his jaw was dislocated. He looked at Gu Zhou awkwardly with his mouth open. He turned his head and silently straightened his chin before looking at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

At this moment, the president arrived with his men. When he saw Wright, who was covered in blood, he was shocked.

He seriously suspected that Wright was no longer human.

“What kind of monster is this?” the President asked in a low voice, frowning at Wright, who was not far away.

When Lina heard the president’s voice, she gave Chen Qing a look. Chen Qing leaned against the wall. Seeing that Chen Qing could stand steadily, she quickly walked towards the president.

When she walked over to the president, Lina looked at her father’s concerned face. Tears fell uncontrollably, and her voice choked. “Father, I miss you so much.”

She really didn’t expect her father to rush over so quickly.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The president sized up Lina and didn’t notice the gauze on her hand. Seeing that Lina was fine, he heaved a sigh of relief.

He gently patted Lina’s arm and said softly, “I’ve been worried that you would suffer here, so I stayed in a villa nearby. I just received the news, so I brought some people over.”

Lina raised her hand and silently wiped her tears. She sniffled. If Wright hadn’t cut off the Internet previously, they would probably have been fine if they could contact her father when Wright brought people into her room.

The president took out a tissue and handed it to Lina. His gaze swept across the people in front of him, and he frowned. His eyes were filled with surprise.

Strange, what had happened?

One of the groups of people should be from Wright, while the other group was from Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

He glanced at Chen Qing, who was standing not far away. Chen Qing was in a sorry state and seemed to close to collapse. He kept leaning against the wall.

The president’s gaze finally fell on Wright, who was not far away. If Wright hadn’t looked up, he wouldn’t have recognized him.

“Wright?”

When Lina heard the president’s words, she nodded seriously and said pitifully, “Father, last night, Wright barged into my room with a large group of people. He… he even wanted to…”

Lina was really too embarrassed to say the rest. After all, she was a girl.

Lina looked at Chen Qing, who was not far away. The scene of Chen Qing barging into the room and covering her with the blanket appeared in her mind again. If it weren’t for Chen Qing, she might have been bullied a long ago.

Lina looked at the president and said sternly, “Fortunately, Chen Qing arrived in time and Wright didn’t succeed. However, Wright flew into a rage out of humiliation and vented all his anger on Chen Qing. He brought so many people to kill Chen Qing and was prepared to silence him.”

The president listened to Lina’s words. Although there were some things Lina didn’t say, he had already imagined them.

His expression was dark. He had already told Wright not to have sex with Lina before marriage.

Wright was really rebellious. He even had to bring a group of guards with him when he wanted to attack Lina. It was obvious that nothing good happened.

The president was a father. Lina was his treasure. How could he suffer such humiliation?

He clenched his fists tightly and walked towards Wright step by step, his eyes filled with killing intent.

When Wright saw the president coming over, he hurriedly smiled and was about to call for help when the president punched Wright in the face.

Wright staggered and fell to the ground. He looked up at the president in front of him.

“Did you not take what I told you at the engagement banquet to heart at all? Or do you not take me, the president, seriously at all? Since you don’t respect my daughter, I have to reconsider your marriage.”

The president’s eyes were filled with hatred. How could he let his daughter be with a beast?
