830 Disappointment

Chen Qing’s heart ached for his car. He wanted to cry but had no tears.

Qiao Nian really didn’t do it on purpose. Her mind was filled with the matter of the appraisal. She had long heard Chen Qing’s words.

…

She waited until it was time for the appraisal.

Ever since Qiao Nian found out that the formal forensic appraisal center was run by Gu Zhou, she had gotten someone to open a small appraisal center herself. It wasn’t that she was worried that the people in Gu Zhou’s appraisal center would lie and give her fake data.

It was mainly because there were some things she couldn’t let Gu Zhou know.

Director Wang wanted to help Qiao Nian with the test, but Qiao Nian still refused.

In the end, Director Wang said worriedly, “President Qiao, if you encounter any problems, come and look for me!”

Qiao Nian nodded perfunctorily.

Qiao Nian was the only one in the appraisal room. She put on a white coat and gloves. After disinfecting them, she prepared to begin the appraisal.

Qiao Nian stood in front of the experiment table. She first extracted Song Man’s blood, then conducted a DNA test on it.

Soon, Song Man’s DNA test report was out. Qiao Nian sat in front of the computer and compared Song Man’s DNA sample with the one from when she was young. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She sat at the computer table and waited quietly.

By the time she was done, three hours had passed.

The appraisal results were out.

When Qiao Nian looked at the results, she was slightly stunned.

How was this possible?

Qiao Nian frowned.

Worried that there was a mistake with the computer’s analysis of the data, she checked every item bit by bit.

The computer’s analysis was not wrong. Song Man was indeed Xiao Shi’s biological mother.

How could a mother be so heartless as to let her daughter do so much work?

If Song Man’s hands were also rough, she would only think that Song Man and Xiao Shi’s lives were not easy.

However, Song Man’s hands were smooth and delicate. It was obvious that she had not done any work.

If Song Man was not good to her at all, it was impossible for her to care about her.

Qiao Nian couldn’t figure out what was going on with Song Man and Xiao Shi.

Although she already had the test report, her intuition told her that Song Man was not her mother.

Could it be that she had made a mistake?

Previously, when Qiao Nian was conducting a DNA test for Song Man and Xiao Shi, she had taken three samples of Song Man. The results of these three samples were the same.

Qiao Nian frowned and sighed helplessly.

The results of the three consecutive tests were identical. That meant that she was wrong.

Song Man was indeed Gu Qi’s biological mother when she was young.

DNA testing was infallible.

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened.

She had heard from others in the past that some mothers did not treat their children well at all.

It was also possible that Song Man hated Gu Qi and Xiao Shi to the core!

If Song Man really hated children that much, why did she give birth back then?

She had had unhappy experiences in the past. It was only later that she found out that she was pregnant. At first, she was a little flustered. She didn’t want her child to grow up in an unhealthy home. She didn’t want to give birth to a fatherless child.

She had initially wanted to abort the child, but later on, she recalled everything that had happened to her.

She had not grown up by her parents’ side. Her greatest hope was to receive parental love.

However, she could give birth to her child. She didn’t want to become like Su Xue, who didn’t care about her child.

She wanted to give birth to her own child, then take the child to the father. When that happened, the child would also have a father and mother.

Later on, during her pregnancy, every time she felt the fetal movement and felt the child in her stomach gradually grow up, she gradually became happy.

She was especially looking forward to the scene of the child’s birth.

However, she had never expected that neither of her two children would survive.

In the middle of the night, she often dreamed of her children. Every time, she was sad.

But there was nothing she could do.

She did not have the ability to bring her children back to life.

She really did not understand. Song Man’s child had clearly grown up healthy by her side. How could Song Man not cherish her?

Even though Song Man was the biological mother of the two children, she was too dangerous. She did not want the two children to be by her side.
