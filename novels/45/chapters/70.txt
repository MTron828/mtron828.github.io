Chapter 71: Wang Lin

Qiao Xin wasn’t completely stupid. Worried that she would give herself away, she hurriedly lowered her head.

However, her mind was in a mess. She had to investigate what exactly had happened back then.

“Actually, this pendant doesn’t belong to my sister. I just wanted to test if Brother-in-law would misunderstand my sister. Brother-in-law, I was really just joking…” Qiao Xin said, her expression serious.

At this moment, Qiao Nian was looking at Lu Zhu expressionlessly. She tried hard to suppress the inexplicable affection she felt for Lu Zhu.

Gu Zhou gave Qiao Xin a meaningful look. As if he was an outsider, he explained impassively, “This pendant is very important to him.”

“This pendant was from five years ago, during the autumn season…” Qiao Xin made up her mind and stepped forward. Smiling at Qiao Nian, she was just about to spill everything when she was interrupted by hurried footsteps…

“Second Young Master!” Su Xue hurried into the room anxiously. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Who are you…” Frowning, Lu Zhu looked toward the woman.

“Mr. Lu, this is my mother.” Qiao Xin thought to herself about how fortunate it was that she had called Su Xue before she arrived. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to handle this situation alone.

“Mom, why are you here?” Qiao Xin turned to look at Su Xue, pretending not to know anything. She looked innocent and harmless.

Seeing how sweet and obedient Qiao Xin was, Su Xue’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She began to speak in a persuading manner. “Xinxin, we’ve already hidden that matter from everyone for five years. We can’t keep it a secret anymore.”

Qiao Nian, who was standing to the side, frowned slightly. She didn’t think Su Xue would tell the truth about the evil acts she had carried out back then.

But Qiao Xin hadn’t understood. She looked at Su Xue in utter shock, disbelief written all over her face. “Mom!”

“I know that you and Wang Lin are close friends, but how can you beat those big shots yourself?”

When Gu Zhou heard the name “Wang Lin”, a trace of shock flashed in his eyes, but it quickly disappeared.

“Mom!” Qiao Xin had no idea who Wang Lin was. She looked at Su Xue in confusion.

Su Xue tugged at Qiao Xin’s arm and said sternly, “For some things, it’s better to tell the truth as it is. Five years ago, Wang Lin was drugged, and someone assaulted her, ruining her purity. After that, she died in childbirth. I know you’ve always wanted to find the person who hurt your friend, and avenge her, but we have to act within our means!”

Qiao Nian stood coldly at the side. She felt that Su Xue must truly be talented at making things up. Wasn’t Su Xue afraid that Lu Zhu would investigate this matter?

Su Xue pulled Qiao Xin behind her, giving a helpless sigh. “Mr. Lu, Xinxin and Wang Lin were good friends. Xin Xin has always wanted to avenge her, so she tends to spout nonsense. I’ll definitely prevent her from spouting nonsense in the future.”

Lu Zhu toyed with the pendant in his hand and asked seriously, “So you’re saying that… the girl from that night five years ago was Wang Lin?”

“Yes, yes, yes. We didn’t know that this pendant was yours either. If we had known…”

Before Su Xue could finish her sentence, Lu Zhu interrupted her.

“Did anyone say this pendant was mine?” Lu Zhu placed the pendant on the coffee table. His voice was cool and pleasant to the ear.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu in shock.

“That night, I drank too much. Someone took my pendant. I didn’t expect that person to commit such acts and use this pendant as an identifier.” Lu Zhu frowned, his expression displeased.

Qiao Xin inhaled. Fortunately, she hadn’t blurted out that she herself was the woman from five years ago. Otherwise, in the eyes of everyone, wouldn’t her purity be ruined?

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian lowered her gaze in disappointment. It seemed that it would truly be difficult to find that person.

Su Xue was the first to react. After exchanging a few more pleasantries, she congratulated Lu Zhu on finding the pendant. Then, she pulled Qiao Xin away to leave.

“Hold on.” Gu Zhou glared at Qiao Xin coldly.

Qiao Xin and Su Xue both turned to look at Gu Zhou.

“Were you friends with Wang Lin?” Gu Zhou looked calmly at Qiao Xin..
