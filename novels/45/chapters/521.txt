Chapter 522: Danger

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian wanted to cry. She was about to go crazy.

What exactly was going on?

Why did a third personality suddenly appear?

Zhou Zhou was clearly so adorable. Why had he disappeared?

Now, Qiao Nian felt that it was better for her to deal with Zhou Zhou.

The personality in front of him seemed to be even more dangerous than Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at the man in front of her. She licked her lips and said politely, “I… I haven’t seen you in a long time. I couldn’t remember your name for a moment. Actually, I… um…”

Before she could finish, the man sealed her lips without hesitation.

This kiss seemed to be different from before.

He wrapped his arms around her back and pulled her into his embrace. Caught off guard, their hearts collided.

Her heart was beating very fast.

His heart beat faster.

Again and again. Ruthlessly.

His kiss was especially domineering. He insisted on taking the lead, mercilessly stealing all her breath.

She was suffocating more and more.

Qiao Nian tried to push him away, but to no avail.

“Well… ssss—”

Suddenly, her lips hurt, and a metallic taste spread in her mouth.

This man!

He had bitten her!

He seemed to be deliberately punishing her for her disobedience.

This stimulation almost made Qiao Nian faint from the pain.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to lose consciousness, the man finally let go. His tongue gently brushed across her lips.

Qiao Nian tried hard to breathe. She looked at Gu Zhou in shock, frowning. “You…”

Gu Zhou looked down into Qiao Nian’s eyes. His Adam’s apple bobbed slightly, and he made a swallowing motion, swallowing her blood mercilessly.

Qiao Nian was stunned.

This man was not only possessive and exaggerated, but also bloodthirsty.

Qiao Nian had already forgotten the pain in her mouth. At this moment, she just wanted to leave him and never come back.

The man took Qiao Nian’s hand, lowered his eyes, and wrote a word on her palm.

The word had only three strokes.

Qiao Nian’s eyes widened uncontrollably as she stared in disbelief at the words on her palm.

Chuan!

Why is it Chuan?

Qiao Nian pretended to be calm. She looked up at Gu Zhou and asked tentatively, “Chuan Chuan?”

When she called out the name, she regretted it. Surely this man wouldn’t come up with a name as simple as that?

Sure enough, in the next moment, the man frowned.

The man opened his eyes and stared into hers with contempt. “How could I be like that idiot and pick a pet name?”

Qiao Nian looked at the man in front of her in disbelief. He actually knew about the existence of Zhou Zhou.

In that case, this personality seemed to be even stronger than Gu Zhou.

At this moment, the man’s eyes narrowed slightly. His facial features were handsome, and his thin lips moved slightly. “Nian’er, does that fellow treat you well?”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She was sure that he was referring to Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. Since he already knew everything, did that mean that he knew that he was Gu Zhou’s third personality? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She didn’t know what to say.

Then, suddenly, there was another flash of lightning, followed by a deafening clap of thunder.

The man subconsciously shielded Qiao Nian in his arms. His face grew paler, and his breathing grew heavier.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She recalled that when she received Zhou Zhou’s call, his breathing had been like this.

“Gu… Chuan, how are you now?”

The man hugged her tightly without hesitation, but with some caution, as if he was hugging a lost treasure.

“Nian’er, I’ve been looking for you for more than ten years. How can you forget me so quickly?”
