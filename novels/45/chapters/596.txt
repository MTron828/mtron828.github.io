Chapter 597: Indifferent

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the Gu family’s study.

Gu Zhou sat calmly in front of the desk, playing with the ring on his thumb. He looked at Chen Qing and said indifferently, “Speak!”

Although he had heard Qiao Nian talking to Lu Zhu on the phone, he wasn’t sure if Qiao Nian was lying.

Looking at Gu Zhou’s expression, Chen Qing recounted in fear and trepidation how Qiao Nian had asked about Gu Qi in the car. He continued, “Second Young Madam also said that Little Master had suffered too much in the past. If Little Master stays in the Gu family villa in the future, she will definitely not let Little Master suffer again.”

Gu Zhou’s hand, which was fiddling with the ring, paused for a moment. A trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

“Second Young Madam also said that if Little Master can grow up in a warm family in the future, his personality will also improve.” As soon as Chen Qing finished speaking, he instantly felt the pressure coming from Second Young Master and immediately didn’t dare to speak.

“A warm home…” Gu Zhou murmured softly, his voice tinged with patience. He continued, “Did she say that?”

Without any hesitation, Chen Qing nodded. “Second Young Madam spoke very seriously. She doesn’t seem to be lying.”

He could only hope for the best.

Then, Chen Qing felt the pressure on him gradually lessen. He heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Second Young Master was in a good mood.

He had finally passed this round.

“Continue!” Gu Zhou said coldly.

“After I sent Second Young Madam to Yongan Building, she asked me to come back. However, I saw Eldest Young Master Lu driving there with a beauty,” Chen Qing said honestly.

Yongan Building was where Lu Zhu’s company was. The entire building belonged to him.

Lu Zhu and a beauty.

Gu Zhou frowned. He had thought that Qiao Nian was meeting Lu Zhu in private. He didn’t expect there to be someone else. Did that mean that he had misunderstood?

“How beautiful is the beauty?” Gu Zhou raised his eyebrow. “More beautiful than Qiao Nian?”

For some reason, Chen Qing had a bad feeling about this. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead. How could he tell? He hurriedly smiled and said, “I was just saying.”

“Is that so?”

“Yes, yes. How can anyone compare to Second Young Madam’s beauty?” Chen Qing hurriedly said.

Gu Zhou did not speak. He took his phone and called Lu Nian.

Chen Qing stood in the office. He didn’t know whether to leave or not. He could only lower his head and stand where he was, trying hard to reduce his presence.

The beautiful sound of a piano came from the phone. The call was picked up very quickly, and Gu Zhou’s voice softened. “Ah Nian.”

Chen Qing heaved a sigh of relief. He thought that Second Young Master was going to call Second Young Madam, but he didn’t expect him to call Second Young Master Lu.

Fortunately.

He had dodged a bullet.

Lu Nian was practicing the violin. When he saw that it was Gu Zhou calling, his eyes were filled with smiles. “Second Brother!”

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. His voice was as gentle as ever. “It’s like this. After returning from MY, there were many things to do at home. I was quite busy, so I didn’t have time to visit your eldest brother.”

Chen Qing was a little stunned.

He didn’t understand what Second Young Master meant by this call.

“Big Brother’s health is alright. It’s nothing serious.”

“Yes, I just called him, but he didn’t pick up. Ask him to pick up,” Gu Zhou said calmly, his eyes as calm as ever.

When Lu Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, the smile on his face grew brighter. “Brother went out. He might be busy.”

He went out.

Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes narrowed dangerously, shrouded in a thick fog. “Oh, I see. When did he leave?”

“An hour ago. He said he was going to meet someone very important.”

Someone very important?

Was he referring to Qiao Nian?

Lu Zhu left the house at the same time as Qiao Nian.

Now, he was one hundred percent sure that Qiao Nian had gone out to meet Lu Zhu.

Gu Zhou took a deep breath and tapped his fingers on the table. When they were in MY, he realized that Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu’s relationship was not simple.

His gaze swept towards Chen Qing like a sharp blade.

“In that case, I’ll call him again.” With that, Gu Zhou hung up and looked at Chen Qing intently.

Chen Qing was so frightened that his legs went weak. He hurriedly said, “Second Young Master, Second Young Madam definitely didn’t meet Eldest Young Master Lu alone.”
