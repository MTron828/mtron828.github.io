Chapter 1763 - 1763 Fighting for Injustice

“A casual chat?” Cui Huai clearly did not believe what Chen Sheng said. He narrowed his eyes slightly, as if he suspected Chen Sheng.

Chen Sheng looked at Cui Huai intently and asked, “Could it be that Boss has some relationship with Old General Cui?”

Cui Huai and Old General Cui were both surnamed Cui.

Therefore, Chen Sheng’s question made sense.

When Cui Huai heard Chen Sheng’s words, his temples throbbed as he tried his best to suppress the waves in his heart.

Cui Huai originally wanted to ask Chen Sheng why he was asking about the Cui family.

However, before he could ask, Chen Sheng took the initiative to ask his question.

Cui Huai took a deep breath and stared at Chen Sheng’s face. Finally, he said, “Come in with me.”

Chen Sheng did not speak. He only followed Cui Huai inside, leaving Sha He and Ba Song behind.

Ba Song had finished his game. He walked to Sha He and asked in a low voice, “Do you want to eavesdrop?”

“It’s better not to.” Sha He shook his head. Although he really wanted to get answers, Boss definitely didn’t want them to hear his conversation with Chen Sheng alone.

Ba Song walked to the sofa and sat down. He lowered his voice and asked, “What do you think Boss’s relationship with General Cui is?”

“I don’t know,” Sha He said in a low voice. He didn’t dare to say anything casually.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In the room.

Cui Huai walked to the desk and sat down. He narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Chen Sheng in front of him, his eyes gradually turning cold.

At this point, he did not plan to beat around the bush with Chen Sheng. He went straight to the point and said, “You deliberately asked Sha He to mention the Cui family just now. Why? What’s your motive?”

Chen Sheng looked at Cui Huai in front of him and said very seriously, “Boss, I don’t have any motives. I’m just feeling injustice for Old General Cui Si. He’s a loyal official and has always been willing to go through fire and water for his leader, but his president suspects him.”

Chen Sheng’s tone was a little anxious. One could hear his dissatisfaction with that matter. He frowned coldly and said seriously, “I think my situation is very similar to his. I’m the same kind of person as him. I’m just very dissatisfied with this matter and feel indignant about his tragedy.”

“Boss, what’s your relationship with General Cui Si?” Chen Sheng finally asked the question he wanted to ask.

Cui Huai did not speak. He looked calmly at Chen Sheng in front of him, his breathing a little heavy.

This was the first time he had seen Chen Sheng express his thoughts so clearly.

Seeing that Cui Huai had been looking at him, Chen Sheng took a deep breath and tried his best to suppress the anger in his heart. He said, “Boss, I’ve been by your side for so many years. Actually, I’m only thinking about one thing. I want to make a name for myself with you.”

“I was just an inconspicuous person in the past. If not for Boss’s guidance, I wouldn’t have climbed up so quickly.”

“Boss, I don’t understand. What did I do wrong? Why are you suspecting me again and again?” When Chen Sheng said this, his eyes were a little red, as if he had been wronged.

When Cui Huai heard Chen Sheng’s words, his breathing involuntarily became heavier, and his chest suddenly became hot.

Chen Sheng said what he was thinking.

All these years, he had been suppressing the hatred in his heart and trying his best to maintain his composure. However, after listening to Chen Sheng’s accusations, he understood that he had never let go of that matter.

He looked at Chen Sheng as if he was looking at a soulmate.

Only Chen Sheng could understand the complicated feelings in his heart, because Chen Sheng really empathized with his feelings.

Cui Huai’s lips trembled slightly. He quickly shook his head. He could understand Chen Sheng’s pain. He was not the president. He could not give up on everyone who had followed him. Without hesitation, he said, “I’m Cui Si!”

After Cui Huai finished speaking, he tore off the mask on his face and looked at Chen Sheng intently. He said impatiently, “I’m the person who was killed by the president. I should have died long ago.”
