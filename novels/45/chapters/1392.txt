Doctor Lin looked over. The person who had stopped him was Qin Chuan.

Doctor Lin pursed his lips and did not speak. Since the patient had agreed, it was useless for him to say anything as a doctor. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Doctor Lin watched as Qiao Nian skillfully removed the silver needles from Qin Chuan’s head. Her movements were very natural, just like Doctor Zhao’s acupuncture technique in their hospital. No, to be precise, Qiao Nian’s technique was even more natural than Doctor Zhao’s.

Doctor Zhao came from a Chinese medicine family and had studied Chinese medicine since he was young. Now that he was in Chinese medicine, many people regarded him as a divine doctor, especially when it came to acupuncture. His acupuncture skills were second in the country, but no one dared to claim the first place.

Miss Qiao’s acupuncture skills far exceeded Doctor Zhao’s. Miss Qiao looked to be in her early twenties, but Doctor Zhao was already in his forties.

Doctor Lin slowly walked to the bed. When Miss Qiao took out the needles, her expression was natural, as if she did not take such a matter seriously at all.

Seeing the silver needles on Mr. Qin’s head being removed one by one, a little blood flowed out from the back of his head.

Seeing this, Doctor Lin gasped. He looked at Qiao Nian nervously, not daring to speak.

With a calm expression, Qiao Nian placed the silver needle aside and wiped the blood off the back of Qin Chuan’s head with a cotton ball. She said, “You must have been hit in the head by a stone. From the looks of it, there shouldn’t be much blood in your brain, nor did it crush the most important nerves. However, the blood clot in your brain will give you a headache and cause you to lose your memory.”

Qiao Nian helped Qin Chuan deal with the blood clot at the back of his head. Only then did she let Qin Chuan sit by the bed. As she disinfected the silver needles, she put them away and said, “For the next three days, I’ll perform acupuncture on you twice a day. When the time comes, take the medicine I prescribed for you.”

Qin Chuan leaned against the bed and stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. He wanted to ask when he would remember everything, but he heard Qiao Nian say, “You’ve only temporarily lost your memory. You’ll definitely remember everything in the future, but…”

After Qiao Nian disinfected the last silver needle and put it away, she looked at Qin Chuan and said, “I’m not sure when you’ll be able to remember everything, but don’t worry. I’ll definitely treat you.”

Seeing the smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Qin Chuan knew that he would definitely recover. The tension in his heart gradually relaxed.

Doctor Lin, who was at the side, frowned. Just now, when he found out that Qin Chuan’s situation was urgent, he ran over anxiously. However, it seemed that the problem had been resolved. He didn’t have to do anything else.

Qiao Nian put the silver needles into her bag. Only then did she notice Doctor Lin standing at the side in a daze. She said seriously, “When his condition improves tomorrow, we’ll do a CT scan of his brain.”

Doctor Lin came back to his senses and looked at Qin Chuan. Qin Chuan’s face was pale, but he looked quite energetic.

He didn’t know where Miss Qiao came from. She had casually touched his patient. He didn’t know how his patient was doing now. If anything happened, no matter who was in charge, the hospital would be slandered.

Doctor Lin said with a serious expression, “I think it’s necessary to do a full examination.”

Qiao Nian was a doctor, so she naturally knew what Doctor Lin was worried about. She understood Doctor Lin’s worry very well. After a moment of silence, she said, “He does need a full examination, but he’s still very weak now. It’s not suitable for him to do many tests at once. Why don’t we do them separately?”

Seeing how cooperative Qiao Nian was, Doctor Lin heaved a sigh of relief.

If Qiao Nian was really just a quack, she would definitely not agree to his suggestion because of her guilty conscience. However, since Qiao Nian had agreed to his suggestion now, it meant that Qiao Nian wasn’t worried that there would be something wrong with Qin Chuan’s health at all. She trusted his medical skills very much.

Doctor Lin recalled Qiao Nian’s acupuncture technique just now. He really hadn’t expected a young little girl to have such ability. He said, “Yes, we’ll take a CT scan of his brain tomorrow. I’ll make arrangements for the rest.”

“Thank you for your hard work, Doctor Lin,” Qiao Nian said politely.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Qiao Nian said, “Come in.” Song Yu walked in.

When Qin Chuan saw Song Yu’s white down jacket, his pupils dilated slightly.
