Qiao Nian washed Gu Qi’s feet very carefully and seriously. She looked up at Gu Qi and said with a smile, “Remember to wear shoes in the future.”

Gu Qi nodded obediently.

After helping Gu Qi dry his feet, Qiao Nian carried the basin into the bathroom and poured it out. She then washed her hands and returned. Seeing that Gu Qi was still sitting on the bed, she smiled and said, “Aren’t you sleepy?”

Gu Qi shook his head.

“Are you hungry?” Qiao Nian asked gently.

Gu Qi nodded. He even touched his stomach with his right hand, as if in response to Qiao Nian’s question.

Previously, Qiao Nian had fed him some food. Later on, she and Gu Zhou spent a few hours alone on the mountain. It was normal for Gu Qi to be hungry now.

“Alright, I’ll go to the kitchen to take a look now. There should be some porridge specially prepared for you. When you recover, I’ll take you to eat something delicious, okay?” As Qiao Nian spoke, she helped Gu Qi back to the bed and covered him with the blanket. She didn’t forget to tuck him in.

Qiao Nian gave Gu Zhou a look and walked out.

Gu Qi lay on the bed and watched as Qiao Nian left. Only after Qiao Nian had left did his gaze fall on Gu Zhou’s face.

Gu Qi frowned. The joy in his eyes instantly disappeared. He questioned unhappily, “How did you meet Auntie?”

Gu Zhou’s dark eyes were filled with curiosity. He asked with interest, “Huh?”

“She’s my aunt!” Gu Qi said unhappily.

He seemed to be declaring his sovereignty, but he also seemed to be displeased that Gu Zhou knew her.

However, Gu Qi’s voice was exceptionally loud, unlike his usual calm self. It was as if knowing his aunt was something he was very proud of.

This was the first time Gu Zhou had seen Gu Qi like this. In the past, Gu Qi’s expression had been indifferent, as if he was not interested in anything. He especially didn’t want to communicate with him.

What surprised him even more was that Gu Qi had taken the initiative to communicate with him because of this matter.

Gu Zhou said calmly, “Of course I know her. She’s my…”

Wife.

He almost said the word.

If Gu Qi knew that Qiao Nian was his stepmother, he might deliberately go against Qiao Nian because of his rebellious nature. This would gradually distance Gu Qi from Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou knew that there were very few people Gu Qi cared about. In his heart, other than his parents, Qiao Nian probably ranked first.

However, just because Qiao Nian was ranked first didn’t mean that she could replace his mother.

Gu Zhou recalled what Qiao Nian had told him previously. She had asked him to hide their marriage. Qiao Nian was really putting herself in Gu Qi’s shoes.

Gu Qi stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou, confusion written all over his face. “What?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou retracted his thoughts and his gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face. “My secretary.”

“Huh?” The disappointment on Gu Qi’s face was obvious. At the same time, he realized something. “Could it be that you met auntie before me?”

Gu Zhou nodded calmly. “Yes.”

Gu Qi frowned. How could his father monopolize all the good things? He pouted and looked at Gu Zhou indignantly.

His expression was very expressive, making Gu Zhou a little curious.

Gu Qi was expressionless, as if everything around him had nothing to do with him.

“Are you unhappy?” Gu Zhou still liked Gu Qi when he had a lively expression as he would look more like a child.

Gu Qi pouted and sat up in anger.

If it was anything else, he would definitely not argue with his father.

The only exception was Auntie.

The auntie was clearly his. He had clearly known her earlier. Why had she become the auntie his father had known first?

Hmph.

“It’s useless even if you knew Auntie first. I know that Auntie definitely likes me the most. Moreover, Auntie likes to hug me and wash my feet!”

Gu Qi raised his head high and puffed out his chest, looking as proud as he could.
