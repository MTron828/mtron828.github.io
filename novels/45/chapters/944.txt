945 Six Million

“Six million?” Qiao Yu looked at Su Xue in disbelief.

More than twenty years ago, six million yuan was a huge sum!

Su Xue lowered her head. She didn’t expect herself to tell the truth.

In her opinion, the more mistakes one made, the better it was to say nothing.

!!

Qiao Yu’s mind was in a mess. Six million yuan was a huge sum in the modern era. Ordinary families would never have so much money in their entire lives.

He looked at Su Xue’s face as if he was looking at a stranger. He was so angry that he laughed.

“Qiao Yu.” Su Xue felt that something was wrong with Qiao Yu’s expression and called out worriedly, “What’s wrong?”

“Six million. You took six million away. How can you treat Qiao Nian like this? Do you still have a conscience?” Qiao Yu was so angry that he loosened his tie, his eyes slightly red.

Tears welled up in Su Xue’s eyes. She raised her hand to wipe them away and said tearfully, “I didn’t do it on purpose back then. I was also afraid of losing money, but I was afraid that the company would be dragged down by me, so I took the money to fill the hole. I didn’t dare to take out the remaining money.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Although Qiao Nian was young at that time, I was really afraid that she would tell others about the money. If the numbers didn’t match, your father would know that I had been cheated. That’s a million yuan. A million yuan isn’t a small sum. I could only send Qiao Nian to the countryside. That way, I could hide the fact that I had lost money.”

Seeing that everyone was looking over, Su Xue wiped her tears. After everyone left, she looked at Qiao Yu pitifully. “Qiao Yu, Mom really didn’t do it on purpose. Mom took the wrong step back then, but I didn’t expect Qiao Nian to be the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”

“Are you in the wrong?” Qiao Yu looked at Su Xue in disappointment. He pursed his lips and enunciated each word clearly. “You keep saying that you were wrong. You only admitted that you lost money. Do you admit to anything else?”

Su Xue’s lips parted slightly, not understanding what Qiao Yu meant.

“You’re doing this for your own sake. You’ve never felt that it was wrong of you to let Qiao Nian stay in the countryside. Even if you’re worried that Qiao Nian will say that she’ll fork out the money, you can send her somewhere else and find a nanny to take good care of her. What did you do? Let her fend for herself!” Qiao Yu really found it hard to imagine that his mother hadn’t taken good care of Qiao Nian after taking her money!

“I also wanted to find a nanny to take care of Qiao Nian, but if I really did that, your father would definitely suspect Qiao Nian’s identity!” Su Xue tried hard to find an excuse. “I was helpless back then!”

“You say you’re helpless but I think you’ve been planning this for a long time. Who would believe the words of a three-year-old child?” Qiao Yu looked at Su Xue in disappointment and questioned, “Back then, Grandma took care of Qiao Nian for so long, but Qiao Nian didn’t even say anything about the cheque. How do you know that she still remembers? Back then, when I was studying overseas, you kept lying to me, saying that Qiao Nian was very well. But when I returned, I realized that Qiao Nian had long been thrown to the countryside by you! She was still a child. How could she live alone?”

Su Xue was rendered speechless by Qiao Yu’s words.

Qiao Yu was so angry that his face and neck turned red. Suddenly, an idea flashed across his mind. He looked at Su Xue suspiciously and said tentatively, “Did the investment really fail?”

Su Xue’s heart jumped to her throat. She looked at Qiao Yu and tried hard to remain calm. She nodded and said, “Yes, the investment failed!”

After Su Xue finished speaking, she looked at Qiao Yu uneasily. As a mother, how could she have the cheek to tell her son that she had been cheated of her money because she had a gigolo?

However, as long as Qiao Shan stopped investigating the past, Qiao Shan would never know that she had cheated on him in the past.

However, she didn’t know what her son thought. Would he stand on her side?

Qiao Yu’s gaze fell on Su Xue’s face, his eyes deep. For some reason, he felt that his mother was hiding something else. It seemed that he had to investigate further.

Seeing Qiao Yu looking at her suspiciously, Su Xue said pitifully, “Qiao Yu, Mom really wants you and Xin Xin to live a better life. Mom did all of this for you. However, I was deceived back then. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have…”
