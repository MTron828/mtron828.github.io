Chapter 384: Better Move Than One’s Opponent

Qiao Nian had seen many people like Qin Lu. If Qin Lu was really trying to please Li Kun, it would be normal for her to lie and say that she liked tea leaves when she was talking to Jiang Yue.

However, what made Qiao Nian wary was a woman like Jiang Yue who could read people’s minds.

Jiang Yue must have long realized Qin Lu’s intentions, so she chose to give Qin Lu the tea leaves that had already been drugged.

The silly Qin Lu gave the tea leaves to Li Kun.

This way, Jiang Yue could easily trick Li Kun, and she would also be able to remove any blame completely.

A faint smile appeared on Jiang Yue’s face as she said, “Miss Qin Lu, I feel that I’ve really been wronged. Even if I had drugged the tea leaves, how could I be sure that you would give them to Li Kun according to my plan? Moreover, how could I be sure that Li Kun would drink the tea leaves tonight?”

When Qin Lu heard Jiang Yue’s question, she was stunned.

She did not know how to explain. Her eyes were red with anxiety.

Qiao Nian stood there calmly, her eyes slightly cold.

Jiang Yue’s move was really brilliant.

Qin Lu was no match for Jiang Yue at all, because she had no idea where she had lost.

Li Kun stood at the side, his hands gripping the door frame tightly. He said angrily, “Qin Lu, you accepted Jiang Yue’s tea leaves and drugged me. You even called Miss Qiao Nian over. What are you doing this for?”

Qin Lu was crying profusely. She quickly shook her head and explained, “Cousin, you’ve really misunderstood me. I had no intention of harming you at all. At that time, your face turned red after drinking the tea. I thought you were sick, so I asked the waiter to invite Miss Qiao over.”

......

“When I entered, I heard that Miss Qiao was Mr. Gu Zhou’s attending physician. Therefore, I thought that if she saw that you were feeling unwell, she would definitely not leave you in the lurch. She would definitely be able to treat you. However, I had a disagreement with Miss Qiao Nian once. I was worried that when I was here, Miss Qiao would be unwilling to help, so I could only hide! Cousin, I really never thought of harming you!”

When Qiao Nian heard this, it didn’t seem to be a problem. She asked, “Since this has nothing to do with you, why did you hide so sneakily?”

“I’m worried about my cousin. If you’re unwilling to save him, then I’ll have to call an ambulance quickly. Who knew that when you came over, you would knock me out and…”

The more Qin Lu thought about it, the more upset she felt. Tears streamed down her face as she sobbed.

.

Li Kun stood at the side and did not say anything. Qin Lu was a timid person who ran away whenever something happened. This was quite in line with her personality.

Qiao Nian pretended to be enlightened and said, “At that time, did you really not know what was going on with your cousin?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Lu raised her hand to wipe her tears. Actually, she had indeed wanted to matchmake her cousin and Qiao Nian.

However, she definitely couldn’t say it out loud. She looked up at Qiao Nian, pretending not to understand. “I’m not a medical student. How could I know?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Lu. Seeing that she had lowered her head to cry again, she frowned.

This matter became confusing again. If she wasn’t wrong, Qin Lu definitely knew that there was something wrong with the tea leaves, and Jiang Yue was definitely involved.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was frowning and pretending not to care, Jiang Yue smiled and said, “Miss Qin, you’re really amazing. You’re pushing all the blame onto me. I didn’t even know that I had the ability to predict the future.”

Jiang Yue immediately said, “Since Miss Qin thinks it’s me, just pretend it’s me!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Jiang Yue’s face. It seemed that Jiang Yue had long thought of making Qin Lu the scapegoat. With Qin Lu’s intelligence, she must have been played by her like a fiddle.
