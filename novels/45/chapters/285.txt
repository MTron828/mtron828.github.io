Chapter 286: Goddess’ Descent

At this moment, someone in the crowd finally spoke the truth.

“What stage fright? She’s clearly not capable enough!”

“That’s right. If she’s really capable, why would she have stage fright?”

“I hereby announce that from today onwards, Qiao Nian is the person I admire the most! She is my idol!”

“Student Qiao Nian, can you tell everyone where you studied music in the past? Can you teach me my poor hand?”

“Me too!”

“I want to learn too!”

…

In an instant, the classroom became extremely lively.

Qiao Nian smiled and said softly, “Actually, you just need to practice more. There’s no trick to it. Later on, I’ll post something I think will be useful on the school website. Everyone can take a look.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, everyone was overjoyed. They instantly cheered.

“Oh my god, Qiao Nian is like a goddess who has descended from the sky. She’s so kind!”

“I like her so much. I’m going to woo her in the future!”

“Qiao Nian is my idol. I’m Qiao Nian’s first fan!”

…

When Gao Lin and Xia Xue heard that everyone liked Qiao Nian, their expressions grew uglier and uglier. They stood rooted to the ground, not daring to make a sound, trying hard to reduce their presence.

However, Qiao Nian had no intention of letting them off the hook. She smiled and turned to look at Xia Xue, her red lips curved up slightly. “Senior Xia Xue, you haven’t given me a score yet!”

Xia Xue’s face turned paler and paler. For a moment, she felt so ashamed that she wished she could find a place to hide.

Seeing this, Brother Cao spoke up to help Xia Xue out of the situation. “Student Qiao Nian, you did well just now. If it were up to me, I would give you 99 points. I’m just afraid that if I give you one more point, you’ll become arrogant. Student Xia Xue hasn’t reached your level yet, so she can’t give you a score!”

Hearing Brother Cao’s words, the entire hall was in an uproar. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Brother Cao had praised Qiao Nian and belittled Xia Xue. Could it be that Brother Cao had already decided to let Qiao Nian be the female musician?

Everyone present was looking forward to seeing Qiao Nian become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. It had to be known that Xia Xue becoming Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician would only affect the quality of Mr. Dong Hua’s performance.

If Qiao Nian could become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician, they would definitely approve.

“Brother Cao, why don’t you accept Qiao Nian as your student?”

“That’s right, Brother Cao. If Student Qiao Nian becomes Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician, I believe that Mr. Dong Hua’s performance will definitely be as perfect as ever!”

“Moreover, you’ve seen for yourself how capable Qiao Nian is. Qiao Nian is so talented. Brother Cao, are you really not going to give her a chance?”

…

Qiao Nian looked at her classmates, who were speaking up for her. Her lips curved up slightly. It seemed that most people could appreciate beauty, except for Gao Lin, who was brainless.

Brother Cao hesitated. He pursed his lips slightly and pondered this question seriously.

At this moment, Brother Cao suddenly felt Lu Nian looking at him.

Brother Cao instantly felt a chill run down his spine. He involuntarily straightened his back.

Alright, he now understood what Mr. Dong Hua meant.

Brother Cao glanced at everyone and sighed slightly. He shook his head and said, “I’m afraid everyone will be disappointed in this matter. Back then, I was the one who chose Student Xia Xue to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. If I tell Mr. Dong Hua that he has to change his female musician, I’m afraid Mr. Dong Hua will be unhappy. Unless he can personally post on Weibo to ask Student Qiao Nian to perform, I can’t help you with this matter!”

As soon as Brother Cao finished speaking, he felt the gaze behind him turn even colder.

Strange.

What was going on?

Didn’t he do what Dong Hua wanted?

Why was Dong Hua unhappy?

Brother Cao frowned slightly. He couldn’t be bothered to speak anymore.

When the other students heard Brother Cao’s words, they instantly felt disappointed. At this moment, they were doubting Brother Cao’s ability to appreciate beauty.

They had just been curious about why Mr. Dong Hua had chosen Xia Xue to be his female musician. Now, they finally understood. So Brother Cao had chosen her.

However, Brother Cao’s method of choosing female musicians was too careless. Qiao Nian was clearly much better than Xia Xue. Why wasn’t Brother Cao willing to choose Qiao Nian?
