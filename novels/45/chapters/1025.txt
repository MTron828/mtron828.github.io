1026 Acknowledging one’s roots and ancestors

Matriarch Lu walked to the memorial tablet and saw Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou standing side by side in the middle. They were truly a match made in heaven.

After Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou kowtowed three times to their ancestors, they inserted the incense sticks into the incense burner.

Today’s incense sticks were straight up. It was obvious that this was a good sign.

Matriarch Lu’s gaze fell on the memorial tablet in the corner. It was her husband’s memorial tablet.

!!

Back then, after Sugar disappeared, her husband had also thought about her every day. However, Sugar had never returned. She hoped that he would see her in the sky and stop worrying.

Qiao Nian noticed Matriarch Lu’s gaze. When she saw the name on the memorial tablet, she instantly reacted.

This was his grandfather’s memorial tablet.

Qiao Nian pulled Gu Zhou to bow to Grandpa Lu’s memorial tablet. Then, she said seriously, “Grandpa, I’m Sugar.”

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, they were all stunned. All their attention was on Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian continued, “I know that Grandpa has been thinking about me for so many years. Now that I’m back, you don’t have to worry about me anymore. In the future, I’ll come to the ancestral hall often to talk to you. I hope you won’t find me noisy in the future. I hope you can bless Grandma to live a long life!”

Matriarch Lu’s eyes welled up. She seemed to have thought of something and couldn’t help but sigh again.

Sugar had been so understanding when she was young. Even when she grew up, she was still the same as when she was young. She always thought for others in every way. She was like a small sun that warmed everyone’s hearts.

Qiao Nian stood up straight and looked at the memorial tablets of the Lu family’s ancestors, praying silently.

She hoped that her ancestors could help her find the culprit who had planned all of this back then as soon as possible. She also hoped that her ancestors could help her find her third child.

Regardless of whether the third child was alive or dead, she had to work hard to find him. She didn’t want her child to wander outside, nor did she want her child to suffer any grievances. She only hoped that her family could live happily together.

Song Yu stood at the side and watched as Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian held hands. She felt a little expectant. From the corner of her eye, she glanced at Lu Nian. Worried that Second Brother would notice, she quickly looked away.

Song Yu’s long eyelashes were slightly lowered, and her gaze was unpredictable.

Matriarch Lu looked at the memorial tablet with a smile after everyone had offered incense. “Ancestors, I hope you can bless our children with their wishes. One by one, they can find the person they love and get married as soon as possible so that I can carry my great-grandchildren!”

With that, Matriarch Lu looked at the children in the room and said gently, “Our family’s Eldest Child Lu Zhu, Second Child, Lu Nian, Third Child, Lu Rao, Fourth Child, Lu Jiang, and Fifth Child, Lu Nian. Her name is also Qiao Nian now. Our Sixth Child, Song Yu, and the youngest Lu Qi.”

Song Yu was originally wavering. When she heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she suddenly looked up, and her heart trembled violently.

So.

Grandma had always treated her as a family. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Song Yu glanced at Lu Qi beside her. She remembered that Lu Qi had also liked fireworks when she was young, but Lu Qi didn’t dare to set them off at home. Sometimes, she would secretly set off fireworks in the city park. Lu Qi had also called her over at that time.

However, at that time, she always remembered that Grandma didn’t like her to set off fireworks, so she only went over to watch. She had never set off fireworks herself.

She had always cared too much about her identity and had completely forgotten that it was nothing personal.

“As brothers, the four of you have to take good care of your younger sisters. Otherwise, the family will punish you according to the family rules. All the daughters of the Lu family have to be pampered.” As Matriarch Lu spoke, her gaze fell on Song Yu’s face and she smiled. “Little Sixth, you’re in the entertainment industry now. It’s a mess there. If anyone dares to bully you, don’t be afraid. The family will protect you. You just have to be yourself and protect yourself!”

Song Yu’s eyes were red and she felt a lump in her throat. She smiled and nodded.

Matriarch Lu looked at Lu Qi, who was about to slip away. She frowned and said, “Lu Qi, study hard in school. Don’t think about going to the bar all day. There are all kinds of people there. Even if you go, you have to bring someone with you!”

When Lu Qi heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she pouted and looked at Lu Jiang, who was standing not far away, unhappily.
