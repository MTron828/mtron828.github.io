1482 Gift

Wright felt as if he had punched cotton. He pursed his lips tightly, his eyes filled with coldness.

Wright’s eyes were dark, like an abyss. His smile did not reach his eyes. “You’re welcome.”

Wright’s gaze moved away from Qiao Nian’s face. He looked at Lina, who was nestled in Chen Qing’s arms. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Since Princess Lina isn’t feeling well, I’ll visit you another day. I’ll give you a gift then.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Lina heard the word “gift”, her expression changed and she shivered.

Wright smiled coldly and looked at his assistant. “Let’s go!”

“Wait,” Qiao Nian called out.

At this moment, Wright’s back was facing Qiao Nian, and his eyes were filled with hatred. He was already unhappy today, but Qiao Nian had challenged him again and again.

Wright heaved a deep sigh of relief and turned to look at Qiao Nian coldly.

At this moment, the assistant stole a glance at Wright on tenterhooks. This was how the prince looked like when he was suppressing his anger. In his heart, he silently lit a row of candles for Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian glanced at the mess on the ground and asked in a low voice, “Isn’t Prince Wright in charge of cleaning up?”

“You…” Wright’s face turned red with anger.

Qiao Nian didn’t seem to notice that Wright was angry. She continued, “Then leave. I didn’t expect the prince to have such poor values!”

Wright gritted his teeth and looked at Qiao Nian, his gaze dark. Finally, he looked at his assistant, who was standing beside him.

The assistant raised his hand to wipe the cold sweat off his forehead and hurriedly said, “Let me clean it!”

Wright glanced at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression before leaving.

Qiao Nian glanced at the assistant who had his head lowered as she instructed, “Clean up. Otherwise, I’ll go look for your prince.”

The assistant really had a headache. He hurriedly agreed in a low voice, not daring to say anything.

Lina finally came back to her senses. She slowly stood up straight and realized that she seemed to have taken the initiative to hug Chen Qing.

Chen Qing’s clothes were all crumpled up because of her.

Lina looked at Chen Qing guiltily. Just as she was about to apologize, she inadvertently met Chen Qing’s smiling eyes, as if telling her that he did not mind.

After a while, Lina came back to her senses. She looked away with a red face and let go of Chen Qing’s arm slightly.

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s question, she hurriedly shook her head. She looked to the side uncomfortably and said in a low voice, “I’m fine.”

With that, Lina glanced at Wright’s assistant, who was still cleaning up. Holding Qiao Nian’s arm, she walked in.

When she walked into the villa, she turned back to look outside and said worriedly, “Nian Nian, you shouldn’t have stood up for me just now. Wright will definitely direct all his hatred towards you. When the time comes, he’ll definitely think of a way to deal with you.”

Hearing Lina’s concern, Qiao Nian said, “Actually, he was also testing me today. There’s no way he’ll let me off.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was filled with guilt. “I’m sorry, Nian Nian. It’s all because of me that you were involved in this battle.”

“Don’t think too much about it. Things have already come to this. We’ll take it one step at a time in the future.” Qiao Nian smiled at Lina and comforted her softly.

She did not expect Wright to receive the news that the president and Gu Zhou had joined forces so quickly.

Although she and Gu Zhou did not want to get involved in the internal strife of the European royal family, in order to investigate the kidnapping more than twenty years ago, they had no choice but to get close to the president so that they could investigate the situation back then.

As long as they investigated the mastermind of the kidnapping back then, they could find out who wanted to kill her and Lu Qi.

It wasn’t convenient for them to ask the President directly about the situation twenty years ago. They could only ask indirectly what the President was doing twenty years ago and what his motive was for dealing with the Lu family.
