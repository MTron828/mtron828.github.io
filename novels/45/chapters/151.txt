Chapter 152 Stealing the Gown

Lin Tao’s words were unpleasant, but Jiang Yue didn’t seem to be angered by them. Smiling, she said, “Miss Lin, you’ve really misunderstood.”

Lin Tao couldn’t be bothered with Jiang Yue. Why would she bother arguing with a beast?

At this moment, Zhao Qian walked in with two servants and said with a smile, “Sister Jiang, Sister Qiao, Grandma asked me to send the gown over.”

A trace of light flashed in Jiang Yue’s eyes. The gown Grandma had made for her had been sent over. As long as she put on the gown, she would be able to stun everyone with her beauty.

At this moment, someone took Gu Zhou away, saying that they wanted to discuss a collaboration.

Zhao Qian glanced at the boxes the two servants were holding. She pointed to the left and said respectfully, “Grandma made this gown herself.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When everyone heard Zhao Qian’s words, they craned their necks to look at the box on the left. However, the box was opaque, preventing them from seeing the gown inside.

Matriarch Gu was a world-renowned fashion designer. If they could see a gown Matriarch Gu had designed with their own eyes, they would be able to brag about it in the future.

When Qiao Nian heard Zhao Qian’s words, she instinctively reached for the box on the left. However, to her surprise, Jiang Yue had already walked over to pick it up.

P.

Jiang Yue looked at the box happily. With a smile on her face, she stared intently at Zhao Qian. “Qian Qian, you have to help me thank Grandma when we get back.”

A trace of hesitation flashed in Zhao Qian’s eyes. Only then did she say, “Sister Yueyue, Grandma prepared this gown for Sister Qiao.”

Jiang Yue didn’t take Zhao Qian’s words seriously at all. Smiling, she said, “Qian Qian, don’t joke around on such an occasion.” With that, her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Pointing at the remaining box, she said, “Sister Nian Nian, this is the gown Grandma prepared for you. Judging by the wrapping on the box, I think it’s a limited edition gown designed by Mr. S. I heard it’s worth tens of millions. Take it and wear it.”

Qiao Nian could hear the tinge of charity in Jiang Yue’s words. Her gaze fell on the box in Jiang Yue’s hand, and she raised her eyebrow. “Are you sure this is your gown?”

“Of course.” Jiang Yue had a gentle smile on her face as she looked at Qiao Nian triumphantly. “Sister Nian Nian, you have no idea. For every event I attend, I wear a gown that Grandma makes for me. All the evening gowns Grandma has made for me herself must fill a room.”

When everyone heard Jiang Yue’s words, they all gasped. Not everyone was qualified to wear a gown designed by Matriarch Gu. At this moment, Lin Tao, who was standing at the side, was also looking at Jiang Yue with envy. In the past, she had always wanted to wear a gown designed by Matriarch Gu, but Matriarch Gu had already retired and rarely made gowns anymore. Jiang Yue could feel the envious gazes on her, and her vanity went off the charts. She looked at Qiao Nian, who was staring at the box in her hand, and asked half-jokingly, “Sister Nian Nian, do you think Grandma made this gown for you?”

As soon as Jiang Yue’s words fell, the people around them burst into gossip. They all looked at Qiao Nian with disdain.

Liu Yu had always disliked Qiao Nian. Her expression instantly turned cold as she scolded, “Qiao Nian, you’re too brazen. You’ve been freeloading off the Gu family, and now you want to snatch their things too. How can you be so shameless? Do you not know your place at all?”

“Exactly. Matriarch Gu has already given her face by letting her stay in the Gu residence. Yet she actually wants to wear a gown made by Matriarch Gu.”

“Young ladies these days all have thicker skin than city walls. She’s stolen the spot of the first speaker, and now she even wants to steal the gown made by someone else’s grandmother!”

Seeing that everyone was on Jiang Yue’s side, Liu Yu felt much more at ease.

With a gentle smile on her face, Jiang Yue said, “Everyone, don’t misunderstand. Sister Nian Nian and I were just joking. Don’t take it seriously.”
