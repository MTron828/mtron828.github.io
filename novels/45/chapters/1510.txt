1511 Are you injured?

Gu Zhou’s gaze swept up and down Qiao Nian’s body. Seeing that Qiao Nian was not injured, he heaved a sigh of relief. However, he still asked, “Are you injured?”

Annie was standing two to three steps away from Gu Zhou. He could clearly see Gu Zhou looking at Qiao Nian with gentleness, worry, and love.

Fury burned in her heart. Annie glared at Qiao Nian angrily.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou gently and shook her head. “I’m fine!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he nodded slightly and turned to walk to the side. Qiao Nian and Annie were in a confrontation now. He would disturb Qiao Nian if he stayed here.

Annie stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. Seeing that Gu Zhou was about to leave, she subconsciously raised her hand to grab his arm.

Suddenly, the image of Gu Zhou breaking her hand appeared in her mind again. Annie couldn’t help but shiver and silently retract her hand.

She couldn’t bear to vent her anger on Gu Zhou, but Qiao Nian was a good punching bag.

Annie questioned with a dark expression, “Assassination of the princess is a capital crime! Do you want to be cut into pieces or be shot to death?”

Annie retracted her gaze coldly and her gaze fell on the president’s face. She said impatiently, “Uncle, my father was already very angry when I was injured here last time. If I’m injured again, I’m afraid my father won’t be so easy to talk to!”

This was a blatant threat!

Lina was so angry that her eyes were red. She looked at Annie fiercely and was so angry that she could not say anything. She could not help but clench her fists.

Lina frowned tightly. Although her father was the president of Europe, why did their family have to listen to their uncle’s family? From this perspective, her uncle looked more like the president of Europe because he had the absolute right to speak.

The president narrowed his eyes in displeasure. It was just a small injury. As his niece, Annie actually threatened him again!

Qiao Nian could sense the tension between them. However, if the president attacked Annie, it would mean that the president had declared war on Mark. Perhaps Mark had been waiting for this moment.

Qiao Nian smiled and crossed her arms, saying innocently, “Princess Annie really knows how to joke. I just accidentally dropped a pot of grass. How can you call it an assassination?”

Annie looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She had seen Qiao Nian smash the flower pot to the ground with her own eyes. Qiao Nian was still lying!

She was so angry that she was panting heavily. She pointed at Qiao Nian. “You’re spouting nonsense. Let me tell you, it’s fine even if you don’t admit it. You’re trying to assassinate me. If my father finds out about this, he’ll never let you off!”

Qiao Nian smiled and continued, “Alright, then I’ll wait here for the arrival of the First Earl. However, I still want to discuss the Falling Autumn Grass with you!”

With that, Qiao Nian bent down.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Qiao Nian didn’t pick up the Falling Autumn Grass on the ground. Instead, she picked up one of the pieces of soil.

When Annie saw the soil in Qiao Nian’s hand, her pupils dilated uncontrollably. She gripped the corner of her shirt nervously.

However, Annie quickly suppressed the fear in her heart. She tried hard to remain calm and deliberately said coldly, “My time is so precious. I don’t have time to talk to you!”

“It’s no different whether you’re willing to talk to me or not. I wonder if the princess knows what this is.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she brought the soil to Annie.

Annie subconsciously took two steps back. She said anxiously and angrily, “What are you doing? Why did you bring this in front of me!”

Seeing that Qiao Nian had brought the soil in front of her again, Annie’s face turned red with anger. She slapped Qiao Nian’s arm and flung the soil away. Only then did she heave a sigh of relief.

“What are you doing? Why did you bring such a dirty thing in front of me? Let me tell you, I have nothing to say to you. Assassinating a princess is a capital crime!” Annie roared.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
