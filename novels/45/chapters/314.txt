Chapter 315: I Believe You!

“You don’t believe me too?” Gu Qi frowned slightly and looked at Qiao Nian seriously.

Could it be that this woman, like everyone else, felt that she was not a normal child?

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi say “too”, her heart ached for some reason. What kind of environment did this child live in to ask such a question?

Children needed to be trusted to establish their confidence.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi with heartache. Smiling, she said, “Of course I believe you, but I want to know where your house is. You even wrote me an IOU. What if I can’t find you in the future?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Gu Qi thought about it seriously and felt that Qiao Nian’s words made sense. She took out her phone, turned it on, and opened WeChat. “Let’s add each other on WeChat. Don’t worry, I always don’t return the money I owe.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Gu Qi coughed awkwardly and said seriously, “I mean I’ll always pay back what I owe.”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew even brighter. Coupled with Gu Qi’s WeChat, she thought that she would secretly tail Gu Qi later. She would leave after she got home.

Gu Qi walked to the door of the porridge shop. She seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at Qiao Nian. “Don’t follow me!”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face froze for a moment, then widened.

“By the way, as a girl, don’t wander around in the middle of the night. It’s very dangerous here!” Gu Qi instructed sternly.

Gu Qi thought of her car plate number. It would protect her in the future.

Qiao Nian smiled. It was strange for a four-year-old girl to worry about an old auntie.

However, Qiao Nian’s heart warmed.

A daughter was the best. A daughter was like a considerate little cotton-padded jacket.

Qiao Nian had initially planned to follow Gu Qi five minutes after she left, but when she thought about what Gu Qi had said, she didn’t want to go against her wishes.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and used her hacking skills to enter Skynet. From the surveillance cameras, she watched the route Gu Qi took. When Gu Qi walked to an apartment, the signal instantly disappeared.

It seemed that a very strong firewall had been installed in this apartment. Most people would not be able to crack it.

Qiao Nian naturally didn’t want to pry into other people’s privacy, so she closed the website.

At this moment, her phone began to ring.

Qiao Nian opened it and saw that it was Gu Qi who had sent her a location after she got home. She was relieved.

Gu Qi stood at the door of her house, hesitating to enter.

Chen Qing’s surprised voice came from the house. “Is Young Master avoiding Skynet on purpose? The places he goes are all blind spots that can’t be seen by the surveillance cameras. If he didn’t come back himself, then…”

Chen Qing was truly stunned!

How did Young Master know where to find Skynet?

He had actually dodged it perfectly.

That was impossible. Young Master was still a child.

Chen Qing looked at Gu Zhou in panic and asked with uncertainty, “Second Master, could Young Master have been kidnapped? Should we call the police?”

Gu Zhou clenched his fists tightly, his brow furrowed. His expression turned serious.

When that child was a year old, he was just like any other child. However, he spoke less and less after that.

Worried that there was something wrong with the child’s health, Gu Zhou took the child to various large hospitals for a checkup. However, the results of the hospital examination clearly told him that there was nothing wrong with the child’s vocal cords.

The child was just a little antisocial and unwilling to communicate with others.

This was the first time he had left home on his own. He had even deliberately turned off his phone.

Chen Qing’s gaze inadvertently fell on the door. He saw Gu Qi standing there.

“Young Master, you’re finally back!” Smiling, Chen Qing stepped forward and hurriedly pulled Gu Qi in. He led Gu Qi to the sofa and sat down. “Why are your hands so cold? Let me warm them for you.”

Gu Zhou stood at the side, his brow furrowed. He stared unblinkingly at Gu Qi.
