1436 Bride

After a long time, he planted a light kiss on Qiao Nian’s forehead. “Go to sleep!”

“Goodnight!”

Qiao Nian closed her eyes and fell asleep in a daze.

She seemed to be standing in a forest, surrounded by whiteness.

Qiao Nian looked around and found her familiar. For a moment, she couldn’t remember where she had seen this place before.

At this moment, the sound of a car engine came from afar, mixed with laughter.

Qiao Nian realized that there was someone in front of her. She walked towards the sound. Before she reached it, she heard the sound of fireworks.

When Qiao Nian walked over, she saw luxury cars parked there. A large group of people was standing beside the cars. The men were all wearing suits and leather shoes, while the women were wearing beautiful gowns.

What puzzled Qiao Nian was that she couldn’t see their faces clearly.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to see what was going on, a woman in a white dress grabbed her arm and said, “Bride, why have you gotten out of the car? Hurry up and get in. You have to wait for the groom to pick you up!”

Just as Qiao Nian was about to say something, she was pushed into the car by a group of people. Just as she was about to get out of the car, she realized that she was already wearing a white wedding dress.

Before Qiao Nian could react, everyone was cheering outside.

“The groom is here!”

“The groom has come to welcome the bride!”

“The groom is so handsome!”

…

While everyone was laughing, the groom had already walked to the car and opened it.

Qiao Nian looked up. The groom was wearing a well-tailored suit. His back was facing the sunlight, and she couldn’t see his face clearly.

However, the only thing that could be seen clearly was the groom’s figure. The groom’s figure was simply carved from the same mold as Gu Zhou’s.

Was she going to marry Gu Zhou?

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling surprised, the groom handed his hand to her in a gentlemanly manner, signaling for her to place her hand on his and get out of the car.

Qiao Nian placed her hand on the groom’s and obediently got out of the car. When she looked up at the groom, she was slightly stunned.

How could the groom be Gu Yue?

Qiao Nian was shocked. She suddenly recalled the dream she had once had. In the dream, she had married Gu Yue. Then, during her wedding ceremony with Gu Yue, she was shot to death. In order to save her, Gu Yue had been killed by those people.

Was it that dream again?

Why was she still having this dream? It was even the first half of the previous dream!

At the thought that she was about to be shot, Qiao Nian frowned. She wanted to remind Gu Yue not to enter the church, but her body didn’t seem to be under her control.

She could only be forced to follow Gu Yue into the church.

The church was filled with guests. Gu Yue held her hand and walked towards the priest.

Qiao Nian’s heart was in her throat. She wanted to tell Gu Yue to escape quickly, but the moment she opened her mouth, she said, “I do.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Yue, her eyes filled with anxiety. She could clearly see the joy in Gu Yue’s eyes.

Just like in Qiao Nian’s previous dream, a group of people fired at her. Gu Yue guarded her firmly behind him and pushed her out of the window.

Qiao Nian fell to the ground in a sorry state. She turned back to look at Gu Yue in the church. At this moment, she saw that the entire church had collapsed!

Qiao Nian’s tears couldn’t stop flowing. She looked at the razed church with teary eyes, desperately wanting to rush in and dig Gu Yue out.

At this moment, a pair of hands hugged her tightly from behind and whispered into her ear, “Don’t go over. It’s too dangerous. He doesn’t want anything to happen to you!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When she heard that voice, Qiao Nian’s body instantly stiffened. She turned back to look at the person holding her back. It was none other than Gu Zhou.

At this moment, Gu Zhou looked at her as if he was looking at a stranger. The only difference was that his eyes only had heartache for her, and he no longer doted on her like he usually did.

The heartache in Gu Zhou’s eyes had nothing to do with love. It was like a stranger sympathizing with a pitiful person.

Qiao Nian’s heart seemed to be clenched tightly by an invisible hand, and it became difficult to breathe. Suddenly, her eyes flew open.
