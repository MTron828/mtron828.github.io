Chapter 413: Gentleman?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The girl’s body was soft and supple.

Qiao Nian’s reaction was very similar to that girl’s when she was panicking!

Gu Zhou had investigated Qiao Nian in the past, and he had also learned that Qiao Nian had been trapped in a mental hospital previously. Therefore, he felt that the girl shouldn’t be Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou was completely sure that Qiao Nian wasn’t that girl because she had also been schemed against.

Qiao Nian was so smart. How could she have fallen into someone else’s trap?

She had also been drugged before. Moreover, after being drugged, she could still control her body to beat up the scumbag.

Not only that, but she had also cleverly avoided danger during the charity auction.

In conclusion, Gu Zhou felt that Qiao Nian was definitely not that girl.

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou felt a sense of loss.

He looked at the sleeping Qiao Nian and slowly closed his eyes.

… .

The next morning.

When Qiao Nian woke up, she saw Gu Zhou sitting by the bed, flipping through a magazine.

He seemed to be in a good mood. The corners of his mouth turned up slightly.

That was true. It was indeed a joyous matter to be able to continue the family line in the future.

However, at the thought of this, Qiao Nian felt a little guilty.

Qiao Nian sat up. Just as she was about to speak, there was a knock on the door.

“Miss Qiao, are you awake?”

Lu Zhu’s voice came from outside.

Qiao Nian subconsciously looked at Gu Zhou. Seeing him shake his head, she instantly understood.

It seemed that Gu Zhou didn’t want Lu Zhu to know that he was here either. Qiao Nian turned to look at the door and said, “I just woke up. Go downstairs first. I’ll go over after I’m done packing.”

“Got it.”

Qiao Nian quickly got out of bed and went into the bathroom to wash up. Then, she put on some light makeup, put on her clothes, and came out of the bathroom.

When Qiao Nian came out of the bathroom, Gu Zhou was still reading a magazine. She asked, “Shall we eat out together at noon, or should I bring food back?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Gu Zhou looked up from the magazine and his gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. “I’m going out in the afternoon. Just bring me some food at noon.”

“Okay.”

Qiao Nian nodded and turned to walk towards the door.

“Wait.”

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou in confusion. “What’s wrong?”

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s beautiful face. He pursed his lips slightly and lowered his voice. “Remember to stay away from Mr. Chen!”

Qiao Nian responded and turned to walk out.

Even if Gu Zhou hadn’t reminded her, she would have stayed away from Mr. Chen. After all, Ah Miao’s death last night was still vivid in her mind. She didn’t want to die without knowing why.

Qiao Nian walked downstairs. From afar, she could hear people discussing Ah Miao.

“The forensics team has already produced the results. They said that Ah Miao drank too much and accidentally fell into the lake, causing her to die in an accident!”

“What a pity. She’s only in her twenties. This is the best time of her life!”

“Isn’t that so? It’s really too pitiful. She has a 16-year-old younger brother who has leukemia and is still waiting for her to earn money to treat him!”

“Boss Jin is also a coward. He left on a plane last night and even told others that he wasn’t familiar with Ah Miao. His values are really awful!”

“Speaking of which, Mr. Chen is still the kind one. He said that he had already sent a plane to pick up Ah Miao’s younger brother, saying that he wanted to help him treat his illness and then raise him by his side!”

“Mr. Chen is really a good person. Even though such a big thing happened on his property, he didn’t shirk his responsibility. Instead, he’s serious and responsible. Where in the world can we find such a good person!”

… .

Hearing their words, Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly, her heart filled with disdain.

She was already dead. How could she be lucky?

Only the living could enjoy life.

Now, it seemed that Mr. Chen was really too good at putting on a show. Even though he had done many ruthless things, outsiders felt that he was a gentleman. To them, he was so kind that he couldn’t bear to step on an ant.
