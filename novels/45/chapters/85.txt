Qiao Nian then inserted nine more needles into Gu Zhou’s body. After fifteen minutes, she removed the needles.

She placed the needles back to the side and was about to give Gu Zhou a massage when she seemed to recall something. She asked, “Um, can I help you massage your acupuncture points? Only then will your body recover faster.”

“Sure,” Gu Zhou answered lazily.

Gu Zhou’s voice was soft and sultry. Listening to him speak, Qiao Nian had the illusion that she was going to get pregnant.

Could it be that this person’s voice had changed after soaking in the medicinal bath for too long?

She was not used to Gu Zhou being so obedient.

Qiao Nian reached out and began giving Gu Zhou a massage.

Gu Zhou sat in the bathtub with his eyes closed. He could clearly feel the strength in her soft fingers. At times, she was gentle, but at other times, she was forceful. Her hands moved slowly along his back.

This kind of massage felt a little different from how doctors usually massaged him. There were also some changes in his body that he had never felt before.

He slowly opened his eyes, his gaze landing on the mist-resistant mirror not far away. Under the light, her skin seemed to have turned snow-white while her cheeks were flushed pink. Her lips were red, like a cherry.

Gu Zhou’s breath hitched. He swallowed.

For some reason, he suddenly recalled that night five years ago.

That girl’s hands had been as soft and comforting as Qiao Nian’s. Her head had been buried in his chest and there was a faint fragrance coming from her.

Gu Zhou’s heart was beating extremely fast. He was a little confused now. Was the girl from that night five years ago really Wang Lin?

Gu Zhou took a deep breath and closed his eyes again, submitting himself to Qiao Nian’s massage.

Qiao Nian was wholly focused on the massage. After the massage, she stood up and walked to the basin to wash her hands, saying, “Alright, you can come out now. After an hour, you can take a shower.”

Gu Zhou opened his eyes and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian. “Okay.”

“If you feel weak all over, that’s normal. You’ll recover tomorrow,” Qiao Nian explained patiently.

With that, Qiao Nian packed up the silver needles and walked out. When she reached the door, she seemed to have thought of something and turned back to look at Gu Zhou. “You should have a medicinal bath every other day. Let’s try for a month, then we’ll see if it’s suitable for you.”

It was only after Qiao Nian spoke that she noticed the coldness in Gu Zhou’s eyes. She frowned slightly. Did he really dislike women touching him to such a great extent?

“Okay,” Gu Zhou agreed.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Wasn’t he angry because of the medicinal bath?

Was he angry because of something else?

“You have to take care of your health these few days. Your emotions can’t fluctuate too much…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou cut her off. “Get out!”

This was infuriating, She was determined to make him soak longer in the bath next time. From then on, she would insist on making him do whatever he found disgusting under the guise of treating his illness, just to cure him of that annoying habit!

Qiao Nian was about to leave when she seemed to have thought of something. She said, “A while later, remember to rinse your body clean with water.”

“Yeah.”

Qiao Nian returned to her room to rest. She still had to get up early tomorrow morning to prepare medicine for Matriarch Gu. She was still Gu Zhou’s wife, and it was her duty and responsibility to take care of Matriarch Gu.

At this moment, in the study.

After Gu Zhou rinsed himself with clean water, he could still smell the medicinal fragrance on him. Holding a piece of rabbit meat in his chopsticks, he placed it by his pet snake Lan’s mouth.

Lan looked at him and flicked out its tongue, swallowing the rabbit meat in one bite obediently. Its manner was adorable.

Looking at Lan, Gu Zhou recalled the first time Qiao Nian had seen Lan. She had managed to subdue Lan in just one move. Not only that, Lan had especially liked Qiao Nian.

It was because of this that Gu Zhou had begun to have doubts about Qiao Nian.

At this moment, Chen Qing walked in.

“Master Gu.”

‘When Lan saw Chen Qing, it instantly went on high alert. It glared at Chen Qing with a threatening expression, as if it would tear his neck in half in the next moment..Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
