889 Are you flirting with me?

He seemed to see Qiao Nian calling him sweetly under him. His lower abdomen tightened, and his eyes turned red. He lowered his body slightly and looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze. “Nian’er, you’re flirting with me. Aren’t you afraid of the outcome?”

“How would you know if you don’t try?” As Qiao Nian spoke, she wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck, her meaning obvious.

This was the first time Gu Zhou had seen Qiao Nian filled with temptation. He narrowed his eyes and hugged her tightly without hesitation.

How could he bear to let go of Qiao Nian like this?

!!

The ambiguous atmosphere grew stronger and stronger. Gu Zhou reached out and unbuttoned Qiao Nian’s shirt collar, revealing her sexy collarbone. His mouth felt a little dry.

Gu Zhou’s breathing grew more and more erratic, and his heart began to race. Everything around him no longer seemed to matter. Qiao Nian was the only one left in his eyes.

Suddenly, the door of the ward was pushed open. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The sound of the door opening was like a basin of cold water, pouring over the two of them, who were burning with desire. Only then did they come back to their senses.

This was neither the Gu family nor their bedroom. Instead, it was a ward.

Gu Zhou was the first to react. He pulled the blanket over Qiao Nian and leaned out slightly to see Gu Qi standing at the door innocently.

...

Gu Qi’s grape-like eyes flickered as he looked at him.

Gu Zhou felt a little guilty.

After Qiao Nian woke up under the blanket, she tried hard to take a few deep breaths. Carefully, she poked her head out of the blanket and raised her head slightly to see Gu Qi’s young and innocent face.

She was stunned. What had she just been doing?

If Gu Qi hadn’t appeared, would she have gone all out with Gu Zhou in the ward?

Could it be that she had not eaten meat in more than six years so she was desperate?

Or could it be that Gu Zhou was too lewd to have any self-control?

Oh my god, they were in a hospital.

They were really close to…

Qiao Nian closed her eyes in embarrassment.

Gu Qi wasn’t tall. As the bed was a little high, he couldn’t see Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. He looked around.

...

Gu Zhou heaved a sigh of relief. He stood up, got out of bed, and walked up to Gu Qi.

When Gu Qi saw Gu Zhou, his eyes lit up. “Dad!”

Gu Zhou walked up to Gu Qi and squatted down. Looking at him, his voice couldn’t help but be gentle. “Xiao Qi, why are you here?”

When Gu Qi heard Gu Zhou’s question, the light in his eyes gradually disappeared. He lowered his gaze, looking dejected.

At this moment, Chen Qing silently walked in from the door. He didn’t dare to look at Gu Zhou’s face. He lowered his head and said, “Second Young Master came over just now. He went to visit Little Miss. I forgot to mention this just now!”

Gu Zhou looked at Chen Qing expressionlessly, his eyes cold. He was no longer as dazed and ambiguous as before.

Chen Qing didn’t understand why Second Young Master was looking at him so coldly. He silently lowered his head and couldn’t help but shiver. If he had known, he wouldn’t have appeared.

Gu Zhou noticed that he was about the same height as Gu Qi when he squatted down. He turned to look at the bed. With Gu Qi’s line of sight, he couldn’t see the bed.

In addition, the hospital bed and the door were covered by a white curtain. Due to the lack of light, one could see what was happening outside, but not what was happening inside.

Realizing this, Gu Zhou heaved a sigh of relief.

Gu Qi’s eyes were filled with worry. He looked at Gu Zhou uneasily and asked, “Dad, why was Sister hospitalized? What exactly happened?”

...

Although Gu Qi was a child, he knew many things. Being hospitalized meant that she was sick. His sister had clearly been fine previously. Why was she sick?

Gu Zhou retracted his attention and his gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face. Gu Qi’s eyes were red, as if he had just cried. He knew that Gu Qi was worried about Xiao Shi. He rubbed his head and said softly, “Don’t worry, Sister will recover soon. She’s been through too much recently. You have to stay by her side and make her happy every day. That way, she won’t be sad.”

Gu Qi nodded like an adult. He had heard from Uncle Chen Qing about what had happened today.

His eyes gradually became firm as he said, “Dad, I know Auntie Song isn’t our mommy, but I still want to thank her for sending my sister over.”
