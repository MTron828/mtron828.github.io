1474 Leaving

She had just woken up, and the memories of what had happened were still fresh in her mind. She was in an abnormal state of excitement, and had completely forgotten how hard it had been for Qiao Nian to brew the antidote for her. Instinctively, she wanted to thank Qiao Nian, but when she thought about how Qiao Nian didn’t like her being especially polite, she forcibly retracted her apologetic tone.

As she spoke, Lina walked out. However, she had just taken a step when Qiao Nian stopped her.

Lina looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Where do you plan to go?”

Lina blinked and said, “Aren’t you going to sleep?”

“This is your ward.” Qiao Nian smiled faintly, a teasing smile on her face.

Lina instantly reacted and smiled helplessly. She was so stupid. She had forgotten that this was her ward.

Qiao Nian stopped teasing Lina and said gently, “Rest early. Goodnight. I’ll go back.”

With that, Qiao Nian greeted the president again before leaving with Gu Zhou, leaving the ward for the president and Lina.

Gu Zhou put his arm around Qiao Nian’s shoulder. Seeing her tired expression, his heart ached.

Qiao Nian had been tense the entire day. In the past ten hours, she hadn’t relaxed for a moment.

Now that she finally relaxed, fatigue welled up in her. She leaned gently into Gu Zhou’s arms and said in a low voice, “Fortunately, it was a close shave today.”

“Okay,” Gu Zhou replied in a low voice. Seeing Qiao Nian’s tired expression, he asked, “What do you want to eat later?”

After a busy day, Qiao Nian didn’t even have time to eat.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and smiled faintly. After some thought, she said, “I don’t have much of an appetite now. I’ll have some porridge!”

“Okay.”

When Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked out of the hospital, Gu Zhou drove towards Chen Qing, who was walking over not far away. He said, “Prepare some porridge and a few light dishes.”

“Yes!” Chen Qing agreed. Seeing that the car had arrived, he opened the door and waited for Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian to enter before closing the door of the back seat. He walked to the front passenger seat and sat down.

Chen Qing took out his phone and sent a message to the servants in the villa, asking them to prepare dinner in advance.

…

The assistant stood at the side, trembling. He lowered his head, not daring to speak.

The assistant pursed his lips and said reluctantly, “Yes, the Seventh Princess has woken up.”

“Good, this is great!” Wright’s eyes darkened. He gritted his teeth. “In other words, our plan has failed this time!”

The assistant lowered his head even more. He was afraid that Wright would vent all his anger on him. He was so frightened that he did not dare to make a sound.

“Not only did we not force Lina to get engaged to me, but we also made the president and the Gu family stand on the same side?” Wright was so angry that he laughed out loud, his eyes filled with mockery. He didn’t understand where he went wrong. How did someone else benefit instead?

The assistant was so frightened that he didn’t dare to speak anymore. He was afraid that he would say more wrong things.

Wright gave the hospital a resentful look, then turned and walked out.

Seeing this, the assistant hurriedly followed. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Wright had just walked to the parking lot when his cell phone rang. The caller ID was Fourth Princess Aisha.

Wright took a few deep breaths before answering. He put the phone to his ear and said in a low voice, “Hello.”

“Wright, what are you busy with?” Aisha’s voice sounded gentle and sweet.

Wright gave a faint smile and said, “I was about to eat dinner. Have you eaten?”

“No, I haven’t had dinner,” Aisha said eagerly. “Why don’t we eat together?”
