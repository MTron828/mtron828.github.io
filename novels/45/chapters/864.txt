865 Awake

Song Man, who was standing at the side, was also stunned. She did not expect Xiao Shi to take the initiative to take so many sleeping pills.

“I’m sure,” the doctor said with a complicated expression. “She seemed to be afraid that the pills would be stuck in her throat and she drank a lot of water.”

Gu Zhou clenched his fists tightly, his hands trembling non-stop. His thin lips were pursed tightly, turning pale.

“This…” Qiao Nian couldn’t believe the doctor’s words. Xiao Shi was just a five-year-old child. She didn’t know anything.

!!

The doctor sighed and continued, “The patient did take the initiative to take sleeping pills, but I don’t know if someone forced her to take so many sleeping pills. Many things should wait for the patient to wake up. However, the patient’s condition isn’t good now. She needs to be hospitalized for observation. I’ll get someone to transfer the patient to a normal ward!”

With that, the doctor left. Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian couldn’t come back to their senses for a long time. When they did, they both looked at Song Man.

At this moment, Song Man was also shocked. She had never expected Xiao Shi to take so many sleeping pills. She did not understand why Xiao Shi would take so many sleeping pills. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Suddenly, a thought flashed across Song Man’s mind.

She remembered.

Previously in Hai Cheng.

The neighbor’s wife, Wang Lin, seemed to be unable to tolerate domestic violence and committed suicide by taking an entire bottle of sleeping pills.

That was two years ago.

When Xiao Shi found out about this, she was so frightened that she cried.

She had never expected Xiao Shi to take so many sleeping pills.

Could it be that Xiao Shi was really in pain?

Qiao Nian noticed that something was wrong with Song Man’s expression. She seemed to be recalling something.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly. If she wasn’t wrong, what Song Man was recalling should be related to her taking more than half a bottle of sleeping pills .

The emergency room door opened again.

The nurse pushed the bed out.

On the hospital bed, Xiao Shi was curled up in pain. Her face was pale, and there were tears in the corners of her eyes.

Seeing Xiao Shi like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel her heart ache. She had heard from others in the past that stomach lavage was very painful.

Xiao Shi was like a broken doll, making one unable to help but pity her. Qiao Nian only wanted to hug Xiao Shi in her arms now, but she was afraid that if she touched Xiao Shi’s body, it would affect her stomach. That would make her feel even worse.

Seeing that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had gathered around, the doctor explained, “The patient has already passed the anesthesia period, so she’ll feel the pain in her stomach now. She hasn’t woken up yet. However, you can try to wake her up.”

Hearing the doctor’s words, Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi with heartache. She gently tucked Xiao Shi’s hair behind her ear.

Qiao Nian’s actions were very gentle, as if she was dealing with something precious and fragile. She was worried that she would hurt Xiao Shi.

“Xiao Shi, you’re fine now. Your father and mother are both here. Don’t be afraid anymore!” Although Qiao Nian didn’t like Song Man, she knew in her heart that the person she cared about was Song Man so she still told Xiao Shi that Song Man was here.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s actions, Gu Zhou glanced at Xiao Shi, who was lying on the hospital bed. His eyes darkened.

The anesthesia had almost worn off and Xiao Shi was still in a semi-conscious state.

She felt as warm as a hot spring. This warmth made her feel very comfortable. She liked this voice.

In a daze, she seemed to have heard it somewhere.

With this thought in mind, Xiao Shi slowly opened her eyes. Her eyelids were a little too heavy. When she finally opened them a crack, she saw a person leaning in front of her in a daze.

Although she couldn’t see who the person in front of her was, she could feel the warmth brought by her illness.

Could it be Auntie Nian Nian?

Only Auntie Nian Nian would speak to her so gently.

Xiao Shi tried hard to open her eyes. In front of her was Auntie Nian Nian’s blurry face.

So it was really Auntie Nian Nian.

She really liked Auntie Nian Nian.

At the thought of this, Xiao Shi opened her mouth, wanting to call Auntie Nian Nian.
