1091 Forged!

Su Xue suddenly looked up at Qiao Shan, panicking.

Qiao Shan’s face grew darker and darker. It was so dark that ink could drip from it. It seemed that his guess was right. Back then, Qiao Nian had more than a million yuan!

“Where’s the rest of the money?” Qiao Shan asked angrily. “Did you give it all to your pretty boys?”

Su Xue looked at Qiao Shan in fear. She recalled what Qiao Yu had told her in the hospital previously. At that time, she had even rejected Qiao Yu’s help.

“No, all the money was spent on the daily expenses of the family!” Su Xue definitely didn’t dare to admit that she had kept a man in the past. Holding the letter, she looked at Qiao Shan. “Qiao Xin wronged me. She must have fabricated these facts on purpose because I handed her over to Lu Zhu! Hubby, I’m really innocent.”

“Are you saying that your daughter is framing you?” Qiao Shan slapped Su Xue hard. He didn’t expect Su Xue to still refuse to admit it. This woman was too despicable and shameless!

“It’s true. Can’t you see how much she hates me now? She really made this up! Think about it carefully. She was so young. How can she remember so many things?” Su Xue explained anxiously, her body trembling involuntarily. She didn’t know if Qiao Shan would believe her.

“I really misjudged you in the past. I didn’t expect you to have so many pretty boys. Even now, you can still lie shamelessly. Your words are really pleasant to the ear. If I had known that you were so eloquent, you should have been a salesperson all these years. You might have been able to earn a lot of money. Why spend money to find a man?” Qiao Shan said sarcastically. “It’s not bad to sell yourself directly!”

“You’ve really misunderstood. I really didn’t do these things!” Su Xue was crying so hard that she was out of breath. In the end, she still said those words.

The anger in Qiao Shan’s eyes burned brighter and brighter. His eyes grew redder and redder. He grabbed Su Xue and slammed her head against the wall.

Thump!

Thump!

Again and again!

Su Xue was in so much pain that she was seeing stars. She felt a warm current flowing down from the top of her head. She reached out to touch it and realized that she was bleeding!

“Let go of me!” Su Xue shouted loudly. She knelt there in a sorry state and looked at Qiao Shan pleadingly. “I really know my mistake. Can’t you forgive me?”

“You know that you’re in the wrong. Do you want me to forgive you? Why did you still do these things back then?” Qiao Shan’s eyes were filled with killing intent. Previously, he had thought that Su Xue had just cheated on him. He thought to himself that Su Xue was already so old. For the sake of her two children, since Su Xue knew that she was in the wrong, he would forgive her!

But now, he realized how ridiculous her mistake was. Su Xue might grow old but never turn good. Moreover, she had cheated on him long ago!

All these years, he had worked hard outside and brought home all the money he had earned!

He had resisted so many temptations outside, but he had never expected his wife to betray him!

Such a fickle woman should not live in this world! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hatred instantly surged in Qiao Sheng’s heart. He grabbed Su Xue’s neck with both hands and exerted strength. The expression on his face became even more ferocious.

“Ah!”

Su Xue screamed. Qiao Shan was holding her neck so tightly that the oxygen in her lungs was decreasing. Her face was getting redder and redder. She reached out, wanting to pry Qiao Shan’s hand away from her neck.

However, Qiao Shan was too strong. She couldn’t break free from his grip at all.

Time passed bit by bit. Su Xue felt that it had been a long time. Everything in front of her gradually turned white, and her eyelids grew heavier and heavier. The strength in her body seemed to have been drained, and she couldn’t struggle at all.

Su Xue blinked weakly. In the end, she closed her eyes and the hand holding Qiao Shan fell weakly to the ground.

At this moment, Qiao Yu rushed in. When he saw that Qiao Shan was still strangling Su Xue, Su Xue knelt lifelessly beside the wheelchair like a broken toy.

“Dad!” Qiao Yu quickly stepped forward and pushed Qiao Shan’s hand away.
