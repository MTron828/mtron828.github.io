1038 You’re Amazing

When Lu Jiang walked into the elevator, he turned around and looked at He Cheng’s door, narrowing his eyes slightly.

When he was in He Cheng’s room, he had left He Cheng two choices.

He Cheng could take the initiative to call the police and turn himself in. He would go to prison with Qiao Xin.

Or he could put all the blame on Qiao Xin.

At that time, He Cheng had to choose. Without waiting for He Cheng to speak, he said, “You don’t have to answer me. You can choose for yourself. Of course, if you don’t choose, I’ll help you choose in the future.”

Lu Jiang believed that He Cheng would never choose option one.

Even if He Cheng chose to be clueless and Qiao Xin’s reputation was ruined, it had nothing to do with them.

In the elevator, Qiao Nian glanced at Lu Zhu and Lu Jiang. Although the two of them didn’t speak, she could tell from the satisfaction in their eyes that the matter had been settled.

After the four of them left, He Cheng walked out of the room, still holding the access card.

This access card had been left behind by Lu Zhu.

He walked out of the room and looked at the room number. Only then did he realize that he was on the sixth floor.

He walked to the room opposite and opened the door. He saw Qiao Xin lying on the ground, crying sadly.

The sound of the door opening attracted Qiao Xin’s attention. She looked up and saw He Cheng standing at the door.

In Qiao Xin’s subconscious mind, He Cheng was one of her own.

She looked at He Cheng with teary eyes, as if she was looking at her family. She shouted excitedly, “He Cheng, He Cheng, you’re really amazing. You can actually escape from the room!”

When He Cheng heard Qiao Xin’s voice, he inadvertently met her watery almond-shaped eyes. His heart skipped a beat.

Although Qiao Xin’s looks couldn’t compare to Qiao Nian and Lu Qi, she was still one of the top beauties.

Previously, he had been worried that he would be beaten to death by the Lu family. He did not expect there to be a chance to get out.

Of the two choices given by the Fourth Master of the Lu family, anyone with a brain would know which to choose.

He Cheng pretended to be wary and uneasy. He looked around and said, “They entered my room just now. I stole the access card when they weren’t paying attention. Let’s leave quickly.”

Qiao Xin nodded in agreement. She didn’t want to stay here any longer. She wanted to go home. She wanted to tell her brother how Qiao Nian had bullied her.

Qiao Xin leaned against the wall and was about to stand up.

He Cheng hurriedly walked over and supported Qiao Xin. Only then did he feel Qiao Xin’s smooth and delicate arm. He couldn’t help but touch it twice more.

Qiao Xin’s mind was filled with thoughts of escaping. She didn’t notice He Cheng’s a cheap shot or trick at all. She used He Cheng’s strength to stand up and said anxiously, “Let’s go!”

The two of them came out of the room and their gazes fell on the elevator door not far away. He Cheng said, “Your legs are inconvenient. Let’s take the elevator.”

“Okay.” Qiao Xin nodded in agreement. She tried her best to keep up with He Cheng. Thinking of Qiao Nian’s previous threat, she said coldly, “After we escape, you can make arrangements with those homeless people you found. Then, we can ruin Qiao Nian’s reputation!”

“Alright!”

He Cheng thought of Qiao Nian’s face and how she had hit him in public. If he didn’t regain his dignity, how could he survive in society in the future?

Although he had agreed to the conditions of the two people from the Lu family, this did not mean that he was on the Lu family’s side.

He Cheng looked at Qiao Xin, who was beside him. He had only accepted two business deals.

Initially, he didn’t have any feelings for Qiao Xin. Now that he did, he yearned to press Qiao Xin under him.

If the situation wasn’t inappropriate, he would have made a move long ago.

Qiao Xin limped along beside He Cheng. She stole a glance at He Cheng. At this moment, He Cheng had a smug smile on his face. He seemed to be still gloating over her praise.

Qiao Xin frowned slightly. She didn’t like such a good-for-nothing He Cheng, but she had no choice but to rely on him. If it weren’t for He Cheng, she might still be in her room. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
