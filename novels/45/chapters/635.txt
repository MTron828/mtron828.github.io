“Brother, I’m really sorry about today. I’ve already accepted someone else’s invitation.” Qiao Nian felt very guilty as she spoke.

“Is it very important?”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s voice, her heart trembled slightly. It seemed that her brother must be very disappointed. Actually, she was also very disappointed.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and nodded. “Yes.”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he gave up on the idea of inviting her again.

In any case, he had already acknowledged his sister. There would be many opportunities in the future.

“Alright, have a good time tonight!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, her heart ached even more. She really wanted to have a meal with her brother. Ever since she returned, they had never had a meal together alone.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian asked carefully, “Brother, will you invite me to dinner again?”

“Sugar, why would you ask that?” Lu Zhu was puzzled.

The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the more upset she felt. This was the first time her brother had invited her to a meal, but she had cruelly rejected him.

“But… but didn’t I reject Big Brother’s first invitation to dinner?” Qiao Nian said in disappointment.

“Then can’t I treat you to another meal?”

“What if I have something on next time?” Qiao Nian asked, looking disappointed.

“Isn’t there a next time?”

Lu Zhu’s voice was as warm as spring, giving her a sense of security. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. She was very touched. “Brother…”

“Sugar, your brother should have taken good care of you. Even if you reject me a thousand times, or ten thousand times, I won’t be angry.” Lu Zhu had already guessed what Qiao Nian was thinking. His heart ached for her.

His sister must have suffered a lot to become so careful.

Since he had already found his sister, he would never let her suffer again.

The uneasiness in Qiao Nian’s heart instantly disappeared. She smiled and said, “Thank you, Brother!”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s happy voice, there was no joy in his eyes.

His younger sister should have been the eldest daughter of the Lu family. She should have enjoyed wealth and glory, and been doted on by countless people.

His younger sister had led a wandering life and suffered a lot. Even though she had acknowledged her family, she was still very careful.

This was a sign of extreme insecurity.

Lu Zhu’s expression grew more and more serious as he said, “Sugar, you might not have remembered everything I told you previously. Then I’ll tell you again!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s voice, she pursed her lips slightly, her heart beating faster and faster.

“You’re the eldest daughter of the Lu family. You don’t have to be humble, nor do you have to please anyone. You don’t have to worry about hurting anyone, including me.” Lu Zhu paused for a moment before continuing.

“People don’t get along by being humble and pleasing. Those who like you, no matter what you do, will care about you and love you. They won’t reject you. Those who don’t like you, no matter how much you do, won’t even look at you. Sugar, I’m your brother. I like you the most and care about you, so you don’t have to worry about rejecting me at all. Because I know you’re busy, I’ll be waiting for you.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. This was the first time someone had said such a thing to her.

Before Qiao Nian found her family, she was fearless. But when she found her family, she couldn’t help but feel afraid.

She was really afraid that her family would leave her one by one. In the end, she would be left alone again.

If she hadn’t been pampered, she might have gotten used to this loneliness.

Now that he had received her brother’s favor, she was really afraid of losing him. She just wanted to hold on to him tightly.

“Brother…” Qiao Nian’s voice was a little choked up.

Big Brother was truly the best. He understood what she was thinking and what she was afraid of. He tried hard to pull her out of the abyss.

He was really the best brother in the world.

Lu Zhu’s voice rang out from the phone again. “Sugar, you just have to be yourself. Even if the entire world doesn’t like you, you’re still my Sugar. You’re also the eldest daughter of the Lu family. You’re the treasure that everyone in the Lu family has been searching for for more than twenty years.”
