866 Illusion

But she didn’t cry out.

Her throat hurt too much.

How strange.

It was said that after a person died, they had to go to heaven. If she went to heaven, she shouldn’t be able to see Auntie Nian Nian.

She must be hallucinating.

She really wanted to see the person she wanted to see before she went to heaven.

She wanted to see Auntie Nian Nian and tell her that she really liked her.

She still wanted to see her brother and ask him to take good care of Auntie Nian Nian, Daddy, and Mommy.

She still wanted to see her father and ask him to tutor her with her homework.

She still wanted to see her mommy. She wanted to tell her that she really liked her.

But Mommy didn’t seem to like her.

Every time Mommy saw her, she would get angry.

Moreover, in Mommy’s opinion, she was a burden. She was already so old and could not take good care of Mommy, nor could she stand on the same side as her.

Forget it. She shouldn’t see Mommy, lest she angered her and made her sad.

Xiao Shi’s eyelids grew heavier and heavier, and her eyes became unfocused.

Seeing Xiao Shi like this, Qiao Nian knew that she was about to wake up. She grabbed Xiao Shi’s hand and whispered gently into her ear, “Xiao Shi, you’re your own person. Don’t care about what others think. Your father and I miss you very much. I hope you can wake up soon. I hope you can still be by our side.”

Wasn’t this heaven?

Xiao Shi tried hard to open her eyes and see the person in front of her clearly.

It was Auntie Nian Nian!

When Qiao Nian saw that Xiao Shi had woken up, her eyes lit up. She clenched Xiao Shi’s hand and called out happily, “Xiao Shi!”

Only then did Xiao Shi realize that Auntie Nian Nian was really beside her. Her eyes instantly lit up, like bright stars in the night.

However, in the next moment, the light in her eyes instantly disappeared.

Her brow furrowed, and she retracted her hand hesitantly.

Qiao Nian’s palm felt empty, and so did her heart. Disappointment instantly welled up in her heart, and she felt a little suffocated.

Naturally, Gu Zhou saw every move Qiao Nian and Xiao Shi made. He walked over to Qiao Nian and gently held her hand.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Xiao Shi’s face. He asked gently, “Xiao Shi, how do you feel now? Does your stomach still hurt?”

At this moment, Xiao Shi’s eyes were a little dull and empty, as if she didn’t know anyone. She didn’t answer Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou couldn’t help but worry.

Xiao Shi said nothing. She slowly retracted her gaze and looked around again.

She looked at the nurse and doctor in white, but she did not see her mommy.

Could it be that Mommy was angry with her again?

At the thought of this, Xiao Shi’s eyes turned red. She pursed her lips in discomfort.

It must be because she was disobedient that Mommy was angry and unwilling to see her.

Tears welled up in Xiao Shi’s eyes. She sniffled and her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. Her voice was as hoarse as white paper rubbing against dry old bark. “Where’s Mommy…”

Xiao Shi’s face turned red, looking pitiful. Her voice trailed off slightly in a childish and trembling manner. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi say this, she was stunned.

At this moment, Qiao Nian clearly realized that no matter what Song Man did, she would always be her mommy. She would always be the person closest to her and the person she relied on the most.

She thought of her childhood again.

She had been like this .

She knew that Su Xue didn’t like her. It was Su Xue who had suggested sending her to the countryside. But even so, she missed Su Xue every day, hoping that Su Xue would bring her home as soon as possible.

At that time, Su Xue was her mother, the person she relied on the most. She believed that as long as she corrected all her mistakes and became especially outstanding, her mother would definitely bring her home. She would even buy her beautiful clothes and tell her bedtime stories gently.
