Chapter 39: Being Taken Advantage Of?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lin Nan walked towards Sun Jiu, his expression calm. He gazed at Sun Jiu’s face for a long while before he spoke. “Mr. Sun, every word you say will be recorded. Please tell us everything that happened from the beginning. If we find out that you are lying, the consequences…”

Lin Nan paused for a second and pushed his glasses up. He continued, “The last person who lied… his family is already begging on the streets. None of the companies under the Gu family will hire him or any of his family members.”

The blood drained from Sun Jiu’s face. Most of the companies in Country Z were related to the Gu family. Even those companies who were not would still not hire them out of respect for the Gu family.

Sun Jiu was so frightened that his legs gave way, and he sank to his knees.

Naturally, Shen Xing knew Lin Nan was threatening Sun Jiu. Her heart skipped a beat. If she could not drag Qiao Nian down this time, her reputation would be ruined. However, beyond that, the entire Shen family would definitely become a thorn in the Gu family’s side.

If she had known this would happen, she wouldn’t have targeted Qiao Nian in the first place.

But it was too late for regrets.

Shen Xing wanted to kick Sun Jiu, who was kneeling beside her, but she was afraid that she would be exposed. She could only stand on the spot and glare at Sun Jiu with a ferocious expression. She said furiously, “I told you to tell the truth. Hurry up!”

Shen Ming glanced at Shen Xing with a peculiar expression before turning his gaze toward Sun Jiu, who was still kneeling. He had initially planned to make use of this opportunity to get Shen Xing and Sun Jiu engaged. However, it appeared that Sun Jiu wasn’t someone who could be placed in a position of importance.

Shen Ming only hoped that this matter would end as soon as possible. Then, he could send Shen Xing overseas and never allow her to return. Thus, he said, “Xing Xing, you tell the story. You’re not allowed to lie!”

Shen Xing did not understand her father’s good intentions. She continued to glare at Qiao Nian angrily and berated loudly, “Qiao Nian, you’re so vicious. I didn’t expect you to ruin my reputation. I know you’re the Second Young Madam of the Gu family now, but I’d rather die than submit to you!”

Qiao Nian looked away with an impatient expression. She was not the least bit interested in what Shen Xing was saying. She glanced at Shen Xing indifferently and said, “Miss Shen, regarding what has happened tonight, I advise you to think carefully before you speak. Don’t let anyone with ulterior motives take advantage of you!”

Shen Xing’s heart sank.

Ulterior motives?

Shen Xing subconsciously glanced at Qiao Xin, who was sitting not far away. If Qiao Xin had not told her about those things, she would never have thought of going against Qiao Nian. Moreover, she wouldn’t have known that Qiao Nian was the person who had hurt her older sister.

Shen Xing saw that Qiao Xin had her head lowered. She glanced back at Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian’s indifferent expression seemed to be giving her one last chance.

Was Qiao Xin trying to harm her?

No, she was Young Mistress Shen. She had never interacted with Qiao Xin at all. Why would Qiao Xin do this to her?

“Miss Shen.”

When Shen Xing heard Qiao Nian calling her, she looked toward her, still stunned.

“Miss Shen, your gown today is very unique. There’s even a strange smell.” Qiao Nian felt that with Shen Xing’s pig-like brain, she probably wouldn’t be able to figure out what was going on. All Qiao Nian could do was help Shen Xing get there.

Shen Xing’s face turned paler and paler. She swallowed nervously and looked at Qiao Nian in panic. Turning to glance at Qiao Xin not far away, she saw that Qiao Xin was about to leave. Shen Xing shouted, “Qiao Xin, stop right there!”

Due to Shen Xing’s warning, Gu Zhou’s men immediately stopped Qiao Xin and Su Yan from leaving.

A trace of panic flashed in Qiao Xin’s eyes before she reverted back to her gentle and weak facade. Su Yan helped her walk back.

Zhao Qian stood at the side with a stunned expression. She glanced at Qiao Xin, then at Shen Xing who was not far away. Her gaze fell on Shen Xing’s gown hidden in the grass, and she cried out in surprise.

Everyone looked at Zhao Qian in confusion.

Seeing that Zhao Qian was hesitating to speak, Matriarch Gu waved at her and asked softly, “Qian Qian, what’s wrong? What do you have to say?”

Before Zhao Qian could say anything, Shen Xing shouted at Qiao Xin, “Qiao Xin, get over here! Let me smell you!”

Even though Shen Xing was only wearing a suit jacket, the powerful aura radiating from her was still impossible to overlook. Her legs were tense.

Seeing that Qiao Xin was dawdling on purpose, Shen Xing roared angrily, “Qiao Xin, is your leg broken or what? Why are you walking so slowly? Do you need me to carry you over?”

“Young Mistress Shen, Xin Xin has just fainted. She isn’t feeling well right now.” Su Yan frowned. He didn’t understand why Shen Xing had asked Qiao Xin to go over. He didn’t want Xin Xin to get hurt.

Shen Xing had no time to waste on Su Yan. She pulled Qiao Xin over and sniffed her. She frowned, looking at Qiao Xin with a complicated expression.

Qiao Xin coughed lightly and glanced at Shen Xing confusedly, looking as if she were in pain.
