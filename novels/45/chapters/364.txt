Chapter 365: Helpless

Qin Dong stood on the stage. She had to examine them carefully, but no matter how she looked at them, there was nothing different about these two paintings.

There was no deviation between the contents of the paper and the painting. Moreover, judging from the color, these two paintings had been around for a long time.

Seeing that it was about time, Zhang Lei asked, “Madam Li, you appraised it again just now. Are there any results?”

Qin Dong shook his head gently and sighed helplessly. “I’m really sorry. Perhaps it’s because my appraisal skills are limited. No matter how I look at it, both paintings seem to be authentic. I really can’t tell if they’re real or fake!”

Qiao Xin, who was standing below the stage, couldn’t help but frown. Her gaze fell on Qiao Yu’s face.

She recalled Qiao Yu’s words and was momentarily confused.

However, Qiao Xin consoled herself. Since even Qin Dong couldn’t tell if these two paintings were real or fake, it meant that Song Yu’s painting might be real. Her brother must have remembered wrongly…

Qiao Nian wasn’t surprised by Qin Dong’s results.

When she saw this painting, she was also a little surprised. If she hadn’t used the real painting as the finale of this auction, she would have really thought that Song Yu’s painting was real.

When Zhang Lei heard Qin Dong’s words, he walked up to the painting and took a look. These two paintings were simply identical.

...

It seemed that if he wanted to distinguish which painting was real, he would have to invite Mr. Huang Shi over.

However, Mr. Huang Shi was a very mysterious person. He was unwilling to show his face in public, so no one knew where he was.

Just as everyone was wondering what to do, an old voice sounded from the side. “Let me give it a try!”

Everyone looked over and saw Mr. Jiang Qi, the president of An City’s Painting and Calligraphy Association, stepping forward.

Mr. Jiang Qi had a certain amount of prestige in the country’s painting and calligraphy world. Moreover, he had seen many famous paintings. Perhaps he could appraise them.

Everyone’s uneasy hearts gradually settled down.

“With Mr. Jiang Qi’s talent and ability, he will definitely be able to appraise it!”

“I really didn’t expect Mr. Qin Chuan to invite him over!”

“Mr. Jiang Qi hasn’t been out much in the past two years. He must have known that Mr. Huang Shi’s work was here, so he was willing to come out.”

…

When Jiang Qi heard everyone’s words, he waved at them and said, “Everyone, don’t have too much hope in me. I might not be able to appraise it.”

Although Jiang Qi said that, he still hoped that he could find the real stone wall painting.

Jiang Qi stepped onto the stage. Mr. Huang Shi was the artist he admired the most. If he could help Mr. Huang Shi get rid of a fake, this would be a small contribution he could make as a fan to his idol. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mr. Huang Shi, courtesy name Nan Chuan.

He had never signed his name on a painting.

When Jiang Qi looked at the painting up close, he was extremely excited. He couldn’t help but praise it. He said excitedly, “I am actually seeing the legendary stone wall painting in my lifetime. I can die in peace!”

Jiang Qi examined the painting carefully and couldn’t help but praise, “Mr. Huang Shi is indeed a genius in painting history. He can actually draw such a majestic painting. This is simply unbelievable!”

However, the others in the banquet hall were extremely excited. They only wanted to know if the painting was real or fake.

“Mr. Jiang, can you tell which painting is fake?”

“That’s right. What’s the difference between these two paintings?”

“Stop beating around the bush. Hurry up and tell us!”

…

However, Old Master Jiang Qi seemed to automatically block out everyone’s voices. He looked at the two paintings unhurriedly and closed his eyes, sensing the patterns on the paintings.

After a long while, Jiang Qi slowed down. He frowned, then opened his eyes and slowly retracted his hand. He had an answer.
