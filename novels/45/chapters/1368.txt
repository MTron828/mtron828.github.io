1369 I’m afraid

Gu Zhou hugged Qiao Nian and gently planted a kiss on her forehead to comfort her. Only then did he speak into his cell phone. “Chen Qing, how is everyone?”

“Second Young Master, everyone has some scratches. It’s nothing much.”

Gu Zhou continued to ask, “What’s the situation in the tunnel?”

“The way into the tunnel is completely blocked. They should be trying to stop our rescue.” As Chen Qing spoke, he couldn’t help but cough twice. He continued, “Second Young Master, there should be many bombs placed here. Our people can’t enter casually. We can only let the police manually detonate them first!”

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, her face instantly turned pale. She grabbed Gu Zhou’s hand tightly and said, “Let’s retreat.”

“Yes.”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she looked at the snow-covered mountain slope filled with dead trees. Her eyes turned red uncontrollably.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Gu Zhou reached out and hugged her. He gently patted her back and comforted her in a low voice, “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.”

Qiao Nian’s body trembled slightly, and tears welled up in her eyes. Her voice was very soft, like a falling leaf, and she had no one to rely on. “I’m afraid.”

Gu Zhou hugged Qiao Nian tightly. This was the first time Qiao Nian had said that she was afraid. His heart ached as he looked at Qiao Nian. He lowered his head and planted another kiss on her forehead. He said softly, “Don’t worry, those people placed bombs at the entrance of the tunnel. This might mean that they’re not targeting Qin Chuan and Lu Qi.”

“Even if they’re targeting Qin Chuan and Lu Qi, I don’t think they want their lives.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he pointed at the place where the bomb had exploded not far away. “The place where it exploded just now was four kilometers away from us. Some of the people who can come in to search and rescue are from the government, and the rest are our people.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qiao Nian nodded slightly.

“If those people are targeting Qin Chuan and Lu Qi, the fact that those people can accurately intercept our people to save Qin Chuan and Lu Qi means that they’re here. It’s very likely that they’re also in the tunnel. They won’t let Qin Chuan and Lu Qi die, because they’re in there to take them away,” Gu Zhou said solemnly.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she thought about it and realized that it made sense. If they wanted to murder someone, they only needed to place a bomb near the person they targeted, or fill the entire tunnel with bombs and blow them all up. That way, the target would die.

However, that person had just activated a bomb, which meant that the bomb was remotely controlled. Or rather, the bomb that had just exploded had just been set up by them to stop their people from saving their target.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She only hoped that she could save Lu Qi and Qin Chuan as soon as possible.

…

In the tunnel.

A car was stuck in a corner. The three large rocks around it barely supported the huge rocks above the car, but there was still some gravel on the roof.

Lu Qi’s eyelashes fluttered slightly. She slowly opened her eyes. Her surroundings were pitch-black, and she couldn’t react for a moment.

Where was this?

Why was she here?

Suddenly, Lu Qi’s pupils dilated. She and Senior Brother planned to pay respects to their ancestors. When they passed by the Wang Village Tunnel, it collapsed.

That wasn’t right.

What appeared in the tunnel was not a collapse, but a collapse caused by a bomb explosion.

Lu Qi felt that her body hurt and was very heavy. She felt suffocated.

She touched her surroundings and wanted to push them away, but when her hand touched the ground, it felt a little soft and there was a faint fragrance.

All the memories before the explosion surged into her mind. Lu Qi touched Qin Chuan’s face in a panic and called out shakily, “Senior, wake up. Wake up!”

However, there was no response from above her head.

Lu Qi hurriedly took out her phone from her pocket. Under the weak light, she noticed that Qin Chuan was shielding her under him. Half of his body was leaning against her seat, shielding her with his back.

There was a lot of blood on Qin Chuan’s forehead. Under the weak light of the cell phone, she saw that his face was pale.

Lu Qi wanted to help Qin Chuan down, but there was the sound of a rock pressing down on the roof. Her eyes turned red. If Senior Brother hadn’t protected her with his back, the rock on the roof might have crushed her.
