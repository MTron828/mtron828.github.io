A trace of cunning flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She nodded and said, “There’s a small surprise!”

“What surprise?” Lin Tao asked eagerly.

“If I tell you, it won’t be a surprise anymore!” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

Lin Tao nodded regretfully. She handed a couple of bags to Qiao Nian. “These are the Moonlight Fruits you wanted.”

“Thank you for making the trip!” Qiao Nian said sincerely.

“There’s no need to thank me given our relationship. By the way, how are you doing in the Gu family? If you’re not being treated well, I’ll protect you! I’ll make sure that no one in the Gu family dares to bully you!” As Lin Tao spoke, she patted her chest, looking as if she was unafraid of anything, even if it

meant going through hell for her good friend.

“Little girl, you’re only twenty years old this year. You should call me Elder Sis!” As Qiao Nian spoke, she pinched Lin Tao’s nose dotingly.

Lin Tao coughed. Seeing that no one was looking over, she said in a low voice, “There are outsiders here. Give me some face!”

“Okay, okay. You’re not young anymore. You’re an adult now.” Qiao Nian went along with Lin Tao’s words.

Lin Tao instructed the people in the pickup truck to unload all the medicinal herbs. After she was done, she said to Qiao Nian, “Nian Nian, I have to leave. I have to go back and help Dad take care of the opening of the hospital in the northern suburbs tomorrow. You have to come tomorrow!”

As Lin Tao spoke, she stuffed an invitation into Qiao Nian’s hand.

“Okay, I’ll definitely go tomorrow.” Smiling, Qiao Nian saw Lin Tao off.

After that, Qiao Nian got the servants in the villa to move the medicinal herbs in. She was tending to the medicinal field when she heard footsteps behind her. She turned around and saw Gu Zhou standing by the rockery in a well-tailored suit.

Seeing Gu Zhou staring at her, Qiao Nian casually asked, “Are you going out?”

“Doctor Qiao, isn’t it time for the medicinal bath?”

Gu Zhou’s shirt was all buttoned up, and he was wearing a dark blue tie. He looked sultry, yet exuded a strong air of propriety.

Qiao Nian’s ears turned slightly red. This was the first time she had seen Gu Zhou so cooperative. She quickly said, “Tl go get the medicine bag!”

Qiao Nian had just taken two steps when Gu Zhou stopped her again.

She looked at Gu Zhou worriedly and asked in confusion, “Are you feeling unwell?”

“No.”

Qiao Nian frowned but didn’t leave immediately. Walking up to Gu Zhou, she reached out to grab his hand.

Gu Zhou lowered his head and watched Qiao Nian. Carefully, she unbuttoned the cuffs of his shirt and rolled up his sleeve, resting her fingers on his wrist. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The skin on her hand was a little warm. That delicate heat traveled through his blood to every part of his body, warming up his cold body.

After taking Gu Zhou’s pulse, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and said, “You can use the same medicine bag we used previously to treat your current condition. Go back to your room and wait for me. I’ll get the medicine!”

After retrieving the medicine bag, Qiao Nian walked towards Gu Zhou’s room. When she passed by Gu Zhou’s office, she heard a scream.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She opened the office door and saw Gu Zhou’s snake coiled around a young girl’s neck. There was a dangerous glint in its eyes.

It was as if the snake was going to snap the girl’s neck in the next moment.

The girl screamed in despair.

Qiao Nian didn’t have time to think. She quickly ran forward and grabbed the snake, snatching it off the girl’s neck.

In pain, the snake bit Qiao Nian’s wrist without hesitation.

Qiao Nian’s face contorted in agony. Carelessly, she tossed the snake away, revealing a ghastly bite mark on her pale wrist.

The snake was in pain from the fall. Without hesitation, it pounced on Qiao Nian, but Qiao Nian grabbed the seven-inch snake before it could attack.

Qiao Nian hurriedly took out a silver needle and pricked the snake, causing it to faint!

The young girl in the office had already collapsed to the ground in shock.. She had never expected there to be a snake in this room!
