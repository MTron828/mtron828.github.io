Gu Qing smiled at Su Sheng and comforted her. “I thought it was something big. So it’s just a small matter. You don’t have to think too much about it. Miss Qiao should be a very generous person. As long as you don’t cross her bottom line, she won’t usually hold it against you. So, don’t worry anymore. She won’t be angry with you.”

When Su Sheng heard Gu Qing’s words, she forced a smile. She trusted her senior sister’s judgment.

But for some reason, her heart was still in a mess. She had a nagging feeling that something bad would happen.

Moreover, she felt that Qiao Nian wasn’t as simple as she seemed.

Especially Qiao Nian’s relationship with Gu Zhou and Lu Zhu. She was 100% sure that Qiao Nian was very intimate with those two men.

Perhaps Senior Sister had misjudged him this time.

Qiao Nian was really not a simple person.

Su Sheng couldn’t tell Gu Qing directly.

At this moment, the melodious sound of a piano came from the piano room.

The beautiful sound of the piano brought warmth and peace, as if it could chase away the coldness in the world.

The sound of the piano was like a flowing stream, gentle and delicate, incomparably clear.

The uneasiness in Su Sheng’s heart gradually dissipated, leaving only calmness.

Mr. Dong Hua was the only person in the world who could play a tune that could cleanse one’s soul.

Su Sheng looked into the piano room expectantly. Her heart was beating faster and faster.

Although she knew that Mr. Dong Hua was an old man, that didn’t stop her from liking his music.

Mr. Dong Hua’s music was truly wonderful.

Suddenly, she didn’t want to enter the piano room anymore. As long as she listened to Mr. Dong Hua play this song outside, she would have no regrets in her life.

Su Sheng pulled Gu Qing to the door. She closed her eyes to admire the music.

Could this song be Mr. Dong Hua’s new song?

It was another tune that could cure one’s illness.

Gu Qing stood at the side, her frown deepening. For some reason, she felt that she had heard this music before, but she couldn’t remember.

Where exactly had she heard it before?

Gu Qing’s frown deepened.

At that moment, footsteps sounded in the distance.

Although the sound of her footsteps seemed to have softened a lot, it still pulled Su Sheng out of the world of music. She couldn’t help but frown and look back. Who was disturbing her from listening to Mr. Dong Hua’s song?

What if this person disturbed Mr. Dong Hua’s performance?

Su Sheng turned her head. In the next moment, she saw the man’s handsome face.

Her heart sank.

This man was simply too good-looking. His skin was very fair, and very delicate. His features were three-dimensional, especially his beautiful phoenix-like eyes. They were soul-stirring.

His beauty was a little feminine, but the aura he exuded was that of a king.

If he wore female clothes, no one would suspect that he was a man.

She might even be classified as the most beautiful queen.

He was like a blazing fire, so beautiful that no one could profane him.

When Gu Qing saw him, a faint smile appeared on her face. She hadn’t seen Lu Nian in a long time. She didn’t expect him to look even better than before.

Just as Gu Qing was about to speak, she saw Lu Nian shake his head at her, indicating for her not to speak. He didn’t seem to want to interrupt the beautiful music.

Gu Qing nodded. Her gaze fell on Su Sheng’s face and she elbowed Su Sheng’s arm.

Only then did Su Sheng realize that her gaze on that man was a little greedy. She hurriedly lowered her gaze, her heart beating faster and faster.

Who wouldn’t like to look at such a handsome man?

Su Sheng’s heart began to race. She wondered what this man did for a living and if the two of them would have a chance to be together.

Su Sheng was no longer in the mood to listen to music. All her attention was on that man. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Her palms were covered in sweat, and she was extremely nervous.

Amidst the beautiful piano music, she felt like the female lead in an idol drama. She had met her Prince Charming. This feeling was truly wonderful.

She imagined herself falling in love with him, getting married, having children, and growing old with him. She couldn’t help but blush.

If she could spend the rest of her life with such a good-looking man, she would do anything.

She wondered if this man would like girls like her.

Su Sheng looked at the man’s face with spring in her eyes, already intoxicated by his looks.
