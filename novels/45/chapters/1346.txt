1347 Frightened

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she looked at Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu sighed softly and held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. Her heart ached as she said, “I know you’re a kind child. She targeted you time and time again, but you didn’t make a fuss about it. If she had really turned over a new leaf, she wouldn’t have been reduced to a beggar and bullied.”

Qiao Nian had never expected Matriarch Gu to know everything. However, from another perspective, before Gu Zhou took charge of the Gu family, Matriarch Gu had always been the one managing the Gu family’s company. The Gu family hada lot of influence in MY. Matriarch Gu must have her own connections.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to say something, Matriarch Gu spoke.

“Fortunately, you’re fine. If it were anyone else who was more stupid, they would have been bullied to the point where not even their bones would be left behind.” Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian with heartache. She swallowed before saying, “What she did was infuriating. She brought this upon herself.”

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu worriedly. She wanted to comfort Matriarch Gu, but she didn’t know how.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. When Jiang Yue did those things, she had definitely never considered Grandma’s thoughts, much less thought about the right and wrong of that matter from Grandma’s perspective. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Matriarch Gu smiled at Qiao Nian and said softly, “Nian Nian, there’s something I want to tell you.”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded.

“I raised Jiang Yue myself. Although she’s vicious and cruel, in my heart, Jiang Yue has always been an innocent and kind young lady.” At this point, Matriarch Gu’s eyes gradually dimmed. She said weakly, “I didn’t want her to be humiliated like that. I sent someone to send her to the mental hospital in MY. Nian Nian, I didn’t want to hide it from you. I knew that I should have discussed it with you first before making a decision. At that time, you were on the plane, so I made the decision…”

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. She said gently, “I can understand your thoughts, and I can understand your feelings for her. She’ll just stay in the mental hospital and not come out to harm anyone. I have no objections.”

Qiao Nian’s thoughts were very simple. She might as well do Grandma a favor and make her happy.

However, she had also expressed her stance. She would never let Jiang Yue leave the mental hospital. Even if she was a lunatic, she had to be imprisoned.

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. With a faint smile on her face, she said, “Yes, yes, I think so too. I’ve already gotten someone to keep an eye on her. She won’t come out. This is good for both of you. It’s just that it’s been hard on you.”

Her heart ached as she held Qiao Nian’s hand, her eyes filled with apology. For her own selfish reasons, she had let Qiao Nian suffer.

“Grandma, I’m fine.” Qiao Nian gave a faint smile. Just as she was about to say something, she suddenly thought of something serious.

Grandma had her own connections in MY. Would those people tell Grandma that Gu Zhou had been shot?

Realizing this, Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. She said in a low voice, “Grandma, Ah Zhou…”

“Are you talking about Ah Zhou being shot?” Matriarch Gu stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. Seeing Qiao Nian nod, she smiled and said, “Of course I know that he was shot. This is probably another method he used to deal with those people. He wants to catch a turtle in a jar!”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Grandma thought that Gu Zhou was using a strategy to deal with the enemy. She smiled and said, “Yes, I was about to tell you about this. I was afraid that you would be worried.”

“Ah Zhou doesn’t care about the consequences every time he does something.” Matriarch Gu took Qiao Nian’s hand and said with heartache, “Were you frightened at the amusement park?”

“I’m fine…”

“Nian Nian, you must have been especially frightened. I know in my heart that it must be another trap set up by that kid, Gu Zhou. It’s been hard on you.” The more Matriarch Gu spoke, the more she felt that Gu Zhou, her husband, was not reliable at all. He didn’t even know how to take good care of his wife and even put her in danger. “I know he’s thorough, but he’s too confident in himself. He even took a risk with you. Don’t worry, when he returns, I’ll definitely make him kneel in the ancestral hall to reflect!”
