Gu Zhou patted his back gently and comforted him in a low voice. “Xiao Qi, if you want Daddy to accompany you, you can just say so! Daddy is very happy to be able to do more with Xiao Qi!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Xiao Shi’s body involuntarily softened.

His father was really gentle, and his words were especially gentle. They were like the winter sun, warm and comfortable.

So she was so happy to be her daddy’s child. That was great. She could live such a happy life in the future.

Xiao Yi looked at Gu Zhou seriously and nodded. “Thank you, Daddy. I understand!”

Xiao Shi really wanted to tell her mommy everything that had happened here. Her mommy would probably be very happy too.

Seeing the little person in his arms become happy, Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly.

Although Gu Qi looked a little strange today, he was still very happy.

Gu Qi could already laugh, make a scene, and wheedle like a normal child. This meant that Gu Qi had completely recovered.

All of this was thanks to Qiao Nian. If Qiao Nian hadn’t been accompanying Gu Qi and trying her best to take care of his emotions, Gu Qi might still be the same as before.

At the thought of Qiao Nian, Gu Zhou’s expression gradually turned serious. His gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face. After some thought, he asked, “Xiao Qi, you’re no longer a child. There’s something I want to ask for your permission about!”

Xiao Shi sat up straight and looked up at Gu Zhou. “Daddy, what do you want to tell me?”

“During this period of time, Auntie Nian Nian has been by your side and taking care of you. When you had a fever, she stayed by your bed!”

When she heard Gu Zhou’s words, she recalled what Brother Xiao Qi had told her previously.

When Brother Xiao Qi first moved into the Gu family villa, he had a high fever. Auntie Nian Nian had been by his side, accompanying him, treating his illness, feeding him medicine, and taking care of him meticulously.

At the thought of this, Xiao Shi nodded and said, “Yes, Daddy, I remember everything!”

Gu Zhou looked at her young face, and a complicated look flashed in his eyes. After a long while, he said, “Xiao Qi, are you willing to let Auntie Nian Nian take care of you and be your mother?”

Actually, she had a premonition that her father might tell her about Auntie Nian Nian.

She really liked Auntie Nian Nian.

She had also heard about Auntie Nian Nian from Brother Xiao Qi. Auntie Nian Nian treated Brother Xiao Qi very well.

If Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian were together, her mommy wouldn’t be able to marry Daddy. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Xiao Shi recalled what Brother Xiao Qi had said about letting Mommy and Auntie Nian Nian be together.

She felt that this was impossible.

Her mommy was still living in the slums, waiting for her to call her grandparents over.

Gu Zhou knew that this question was very difficult for Gu Qi, so he waited quietly for his answer.

Xiao Shi sighed softly, his expression serious. He looked up at Gu Zhou and asked solemnly, “Daddy, do you really like Auntie Nian Nian very much?”

Actually, Gu Zhou had already discussed this matter with Gu Qi, but he hadn’t made it so clear.

After spending some time with Qiao Nian and Gu Qi, he believed that Gu Qi definitely liked Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly into Xiao Qing’s eyes and said solemnly, “Yes, I do.”

Xiao Shi looked at the seriousness in his father’s eyes. She still remembered Brother Xiao Qi telling her that her father liked Auntie Nian Nian a lot.

Actually, at that time, she had already approved of her father and Auntie Nian Nian being together.

Auntie Nian Nian was a very good person and was especially gentle to her. She was not like Xiao Yu’s stepmother, who was very fierce to Xiao Yu.

Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian seemed to have gone through a lot. They could no longer leave each other.

It seemed that Mommy’s dream was about to be ruined.

She had better tell Mommy about this as soon as possible. That way, Mommy would no longer have any illusions of being with Daddy. Anyway, Mommy still had her. She would take good care of Mommy for the rest of her life.
