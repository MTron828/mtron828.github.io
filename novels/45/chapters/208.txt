Chapter 209: Disappointment

“Nurse Wang, may I ask if anyone has gone to the hospital for a DNA test?” Qiao Nian asked tentatively. This was the first time she had ever been so nervous. Her heart was in her mouth.

“Miss Qiao, I’m really sorry. You might have to wait a little longer.” Nurse Wang’s apologetic voice came through the phone.

The light in Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually faded. She composed herself and said with a smile, “Nurse Wang, thank you for your trouble!”

Nurse Wang was in charge of conducting blood tests. She could hear the disappointment in Qiao Nian’s voice. In a comforting voice, she said softly, “Miss Qiao, some things can’t be rushed. These things have to be left to fate. Don’t worry. Just leave it to me. As soon as I get any news, I’ll inform you immediately.”

Hearing Nurse Wang’s words, Qiao Nian felt even worse. Could it be that she was really abandoned by her biological mother, just like Su Xue had said?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart felt empty. She tried hard to perk up and said, “Thank you, Nurse Wang. Goodbye!”

After hanging up, Qiao Nian sat on the sofa in disappointment, her entire body shrouded in gloom.

She thought of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, who had died young. Her heart ached even more.

Both incidents had to do with the birth of a child. The Lu family valued kinship and loyalty, while her parents had seemingly only treated her as a burden. They didn’t care if she lived or died.

Qiao Nian leaned weakly against the sofa and hugged her shoulders tightly. It was as if this was the only way she could feel a trace of warmth.

After some time, a knock on the door interrupted Qiao Nian’s dispirited thoughts.

She hurriedly sat up straight. Sensing that her face was a little cold, she reached out to touch it. Only then did she realize that she was crying.

Qiao Nian hurriedly took out a tissue to wipe her tears. Blinking hard, she tried to calm herself down before saying, “Come in.”

“Young Madam.” Chen Qing pushed the door open and entered, panting heavily.

Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “What happened?”

“Second Young Master… Second Young Master has fallen ill. The situation is serious. He’s already unconscious!” Chen Qing said anxiously.

Qiao Nian’s eyes widened in shock. The medicine she had previously prepared for Gu Zhou was to stabilize his condition. How could his illness have flared up?

“When did this happen?” Qiao Nian asked, frowning at Chen Qing.

“Ten minutes ago!”

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. She said, “Tell the butler to keep Gu Zhou’s relapse a secret. Don’t let Grandma know. Her health isn’t great. She won’t be able to take the shock.”

“Yes.” As Chen Qing spoke, he hurriedly took out his walkie-talkie to instruct the butler on these matters.

Qiao Nian picked up the medicine kit she usually used and said to Chen Qing, who was standing at the door, “Let’s go!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Chen Qing replied, “Yes, ma’am.” With Qiao Nian following him, he walked toward the door of the house.

Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “Is he outside?”

If Gu Zhou had fallen ill outside, why had Chen Qing returned to the villa so quickly?

“No, Second Young Master is at the back of the mountain,” Chen Qing hurriedly explained, leading Qiao Nian towards the mountain.

The entire mountain belonged to the Gu family. Chen Qing got into the car, and after Qiao Nian got in, he began driving towards the mountain.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Chen Qing and asked in confusion, “What are his symptoms?”

As Chen Qing drove, he said, “Second Young Master seems to have been poisoned. He’s lying on the ground, and his body is completely cold. No matter how hard we try, we can’t wake him up.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Knowing only these symptoms, she had no way to determine Gu Zhou’s current condition. She needed to take his pulse.

The mountain path curved prettily, and fresh flowers bloomed on both sides. Yet Qiao Nian didn’t have time to admire the scenery now. Her mind was filled with thoughts of what medicine Gu Zhou should use next.

Chen Qing drove very fast. He stepped on the accelerator all the way, drifting around many turns.

In just a few minutes, the car stopped in front of a small courtyard.

Chen Qing hurriedly got out of the car. He turned his head and saw Qiao Nian calmly getting out of the car with the medical kit.

Chen Qing was momentarily stunned.
