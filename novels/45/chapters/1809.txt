Chapter 1810 - 1810 Separation

Chang Feng naturally had no objections. He habitually made plans. “When we reach An City, Second Young Master and Mr. Chen will return to the Gu family. Nian Nian will follow me to pick Master up to see Qin Chuan. We can eat together then.”

After Chang Feng finished speaking, he habitually looked at Chen Sheng beside him.

This was how they communicated when they were on MY.

Chen Sheng nodded and nodded.

It was getting late. They had been tense today and were gradually falling into exhaustion. They all covered themselves with blankets to rest.

This time, Qiao Nian slept peacefully. She no longer had to worry about their plan being discovered by Mark, nor did she have to worry about Mark ambushing them, let alone Eldest Senior Brother.

This time, Qiao Nian even had a beautiful dream.

When they woke up, the plane had already landed.

Qiao Nian stood beside Chang Feng and smiled at Gu Zhou. She said gently, “Hurry up and bring Big Brother home. I think Grandma must really want to see Big Brother as soon as possible.”

“Okay.” Gu Zhou nodded and looked at Qiao Nian. “Be careful when you go to the hospital. It might not be safe in the country.”

Chang Feng immediately tensed up and subconsciously said, “I’ll definitely protect Little Junior Sister!”

According to the way a normal person thought, Gu Zhou should be happy that Chang Feng had said this.

However, Gu Zhou frowned again. Seeing that Gu Zhou was about to be jealous again, Qiao Nian hurriedly said, “An City is very safe. Previously, something almost happened to Little Seven and Big Brother has already investigated the entire An City. It’s absolutely safe.”

If An City was not safe, there might not be a safe place in this world.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian intently and said, “Alright, I’ll call you later and pick you up.”

“I understand. Hurry up and leave!” Seeing that Gu Zhou was about to frown again, Qiao Nian hurriedly waved her hand. “Goodbye.”

After the four of them separated, Qiao Nian thought of how jealous Gu Zhou looked and couldn’t help but laugh.

Chang Feng tilted his head and looked at Qiao Nian. He asked thoughtfully, “I think Second Young Master can’t wait to install surveillance cameras around you.”

“Eldest Senior Brother, how can you say that about him? He’s not that paranoid. How can he be so possessive? He even wants to install a surveillance camera…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she seemed to have thought of something. Her gaze landed on her face and she said seriously, “That seems to make sense.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou laughed in unison.

Changfeng looked at Qiao Nian gently. Qiao Nian’s smile was as bright as the sun, it was as if she had returned to her childhood.

When they were young, the few of them often played and laughed. They had always been carefree.

“That’s nice.”

When Qiao Nian heard Chang Feng’s sudden words, she was slightly stunned. She looked at Chang Feng beside her, and an inexplicable sadness surged in her heart.

However, that sadness quickly disappeared. She reached out and bumped Chang Feng’s arm. “Eldest Senior Brother, don’t be so emotional. In the future, we’ll only be relaxed and free. Isn’t this a happy thing? By the way, Grandpa’s plane seems to have landed. Let’s hurry up and wait for Grandpa!”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When Chang Feng heard Qiao Nian’s words, the corners of his lips slowly curled up.

The two of them stood at the exit. Chang Feng took out his phone and called his grandfather’s assistant directly. Before the call could be broadcasted, he heard his junior sister’s happy voice. “Grandpa, over here!”

Qiao Nian waved at Old Master Qin. Chang Feng followed Qiao Nian’s gaze and hurriedly pulled her towards Old Master Qin.

Old Master Qin stopped walking and looked over. When he saw Qiao Nian, he smiled lovingly.

Nian Nian was the same as when she was young. She was an outstanding individual with Chang Feng, who refused to get married, by her side.

The assistant had been dragging the luggage. Seeing that Old Master Qin was standing rooted to the ground, he followed his gaze and said with a smile, “Old Master Qin, your eyesight is really good. Let’s hurry and meet Mr. Chang Feng!”
