810 Not Worthy of Living!

How could Su Xue treat him like this?

Such a loose woman was not worthy of living!

Qiao Shan was in a rage. He could no longer listen to what others were saying. He shook off Qiao Xin’s arm, grabbed Su Xue’s hair, and smashed her head against the wall.

“Ah…”

Su Xue screamed in pain.

All these years, she had been pampered. How could she accept this pain?

Seeing that Su Xue’s face was covered in blood, Qiao Xin’s heart ached so much that tears fell from her eyes. She hurriedly rushed over and shielded Su Xue behind her. She cried, “Dad, you can’t hit her anymore. Although Mom has done something wrong in the past, she has already corrected herself and has been punished. If you beat her to death now, what will you do? What will happen to Brother and me? Dad!”

Qiao Shan gradually came back to his senses. His gaze fell on Su Xue. If he had to sacrifice his life to kill this b*tch, it wouldn’t be worth it!

The anger in Qiao Shan’s chest burned. He knew that Su Xue had been trying to please him recently, but when he thought of how Su Xue had once been with another man, he couldn’t control the anger in his heart.

Panting heavily, he pointed at the door and said loudly, “Get out!”

Qiao Xin heaved a sigh of relief. She would send her mother to the hospital later. She wondered how long it would take for her mother to recover from her injuries.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Xin helped Su Xue out of the room.

The two of them had just taken a few steps when Qiao Xin noticed that Qiao Nian had also arrived.

Qiao Xin’s eyes narrowed slightly. She instantly understood.

Previously, Dad and Mom had been getting along very well. The two of them were about to remarry. It must be because Qiao Nian had come over and sowed discord in front of Dad that Dad had hit Mom.

Qiao Nian was really like a lingering ghost!

Although Qiao Xin yearned for Qiao Nian to die now, she knew very well that she couldn’t continue to provoke Qiao Nian.

She wondered what kind of bewitching potion Qiao Nian had fed Gu Zhou to make him listen to her.

Moreover, Qiao Nian had previously cultivated some precious herbs. She was now the dean of a university.

The current Qiao Nian was already so outstanding that she could stand at the top of the entire An City.

She didn’t want to provoke Qiao Nian. Firstly, she didn’t want Qiao Nian to attack the Qiao family. The Qiao family couldn’t take it anymore. Secondly, she didn’t want Qiao Nian to target her mother anymore.

A gentle smile appeared on Qiao Xin’s face. She greeted Qiao Nian politely, “Sister, you’re back. Why don’t we have dinner together tonight?”

Dinner?

Qiao Nian felt that Qiao Xin had grown up. She was no longer the little white lotus she used to be.

It seemed that the days ahead would be even more interesting.

“There’s no need to eat dinner. After all, I’ve already cut ties with the Qiao family. If I stay for dinner, your family will probably be full of anger!” Qiao Nian said with a smile. Seeing that Qiao Xin’s expression didn’t change, she continued, “Also, you don’t have to call me Sister anymore.”

Qiao Xin smiled.

Su Xue’s face was bruised and swollen. When she saw Qiao Nian, her eyes were filled with cold poison, as if she wanted to cut Qiao Nian into pieces.

A gentle smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face as she smiled at Su Xue. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Su Xue was so angry that she spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted.

“Mom, Mom, wake up!” Qiao Xin shouted in panic. Seeing that Su Xue was still motionless in her arms, she hurriedly called for a servant. “Someone, please send my mother to the hospital!”

Qiao Nian casually walked past Su Xue and Qiao Xin and drove away.

In a panic, Qiao Xin and the servants sent Su Xue to the hospital. Su Xue was sent to the operating theater. Qiao Xin stood guard outside the emergency room alone, her mind in a mess.

At this moment, Qiao Xin’s phone suddenly rang.

Qiao Xin took out her phone in frustration. When she saw the caller ID, her expression froze.

Qiao Xin hurriedly wiped the tears off her face. She sat up straight and tried hard to calm herself down before answering the call.

A faint smile appeared on Qiao Xin’s face as she greeted sweetly, “Sister Man Man!”

A gentle voice came through the phone. “Xinxin, I’ll be arriving in An City today. When are you free? Shall we meet?”
