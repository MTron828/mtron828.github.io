982 Sister Is Still Alive?

Towards the end, Lu Qi began to sob uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian could naturally understand what Lu Qi was thinking. She took out a tissue and gently wiped Lu Qi’s tears. “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Your sister will be fine too!”

Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian with red-rimmed eyes and said in extreme pain, “Sister Qiao Nian, whenever I think of my sister, my heart hurts. Why did something so terrifying happen to us sisters? I want to see my sister. I really miss her. I want to protect her when she’s afraid. I want…”

Seeing that Lu Qi was about to break down, Qiao Nian was worried that she would faint from crying. She hurriedly said, “Lu Qi, don’t think about those things. You’ll be fine in the future!”

Lu Qi shook her head. She was not afraid of being kidnapped. Her heart ached for her sister, who had been kidnapped at the age of three and killed.

Qiao Nian hugged Lu Qi and comforted her. “It’s okay, it’s really okay. Cry out loud, and you’ll feel much better!”

“Sister Qiao Nian, do you have biological sisters? Can you understand such feelings between biological sisters? I don’t know how to express it. Whenever I think of Sister now, my heart hurts so much that I want to die,” Lu Qi said tearfully.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, her eyes gradually darkened.

She had always been alone in the past. Later on, she reunited with her brother. When she saw that her brother was shot because of her and his blood was drawn by Jiang Chi, and when she found out in the hospital that she was Lu Zhu’s sister, she looked at Lu Zhu with heartache. She yearned to bear all of this for him.

She could understand Lu Qi’s feelings very well now. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She let go of Lu Qi and looked at her tear-stained face. She felt very sad.

She stared unblinkingly at Lu Qi. When she returned from MY, she was thinking about not telling the rest of the Lu family that she was alive first because she wanted to investigate what had happened more than twenty years ago.

However, from another perspective, the other members of the Lu family missed her dearly, but she had never thought that they would know how happy they were to be alive.

No matter what the future held, their family would be reunited.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi. Lu Qi was innocent and kind. She must have been well protected.

She didn’t want this matter to leave Lu Qi with painful memories. Meeting Lu Qi’s painful eyes, she was about to speak when she heard Lu Qi say, “Mom and Dad said that Sister has a pair of beautiful fox eyes… If Sister was still alive, her eyes might be as beautiful as yours… but Sister…”

Qiao Nian finally understood how Lu Zhu felt when he found out that she was his sister. His heart really ached for her and he wanted to protect her.

“Lu Qi, don’t cry. Don’t think about such things anymore. Sister is still alive! She hasn’t experienced those terrifying things!”

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, Lu Qi seemed to be frozen in place. Her eyes were filled with surprise, as if she didn’t understand what Qiao Nian was saying.

Qiao Nian took out a tissue to wipe Lu Qi’s tears and comforted her. “You’re so good-looking. Your eyes are swollen from crying. If Brother sees this, his heart will definitely ache. Of course, Sister’s heart will also ache when she sees this.”

“Sister Qiao Nian, what were you saying just now?” Lu Qi had long forgotten about the pain just now. She grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand and asked impatiently, “Are you saying that my sister, my sister… Is she still alive? She’s not dead?”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She looked at Lu Qi gently and took a closer look. Lu Qi still looked very similar to her. Smiling, she said, “Yes, your sister is alive and well now. She’s not hurt at all. She has a pair of beautiful eyes like mine!”

The light in Lu Qi’s eyes gradually disappeared. Sister Qiao Nian was probably just comforting her so that she wouldn’t be sad. “Sister Qiao Nian, I know you’re comforting me. Back then, when something like that happened to Sister, Mommy did a paternity test for her. It’s impossible for the results to be wrong. Sister should have already…”

Towards the end, Lu Qi was already silent. Although she knew that her sister was gone, someone tried to lie to her that her sister was still alive. She couldn’t help but imagine that her sister was still alive.

She really didn’t want her sister to die.
