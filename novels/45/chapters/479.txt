Chapter 480: Displeasure

Now, she had to protect herself.

Moreover, she had to let everyone know that she had donated blood to Lu Zhu, but she did not intend to tell Lu Zhu about this.

She did this because she was very worried that some people would make an issue of it.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian quietly, not denying her suggestion. After a while, he nodded.

Seeing Gu Zhou nod, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief.

As long as Qiao Nian didn’t tell Lu Zhu, he definitely wouldn’t know.

However, when she thought about it carefully, she felt quite helpless.

She had never donated blood to Lu Zhu in the first place, but now she had to go around in a big circle. She could only hope that the ending between her and Lu Zhu was good.

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling emotional, Lu Zhu’s fingers moved slightly.

Qiao Nian took in all of Lu Zhu’s small changes. She exclaimed in surprise, “Gu Zhou, he moved his finger just now!”

As long as Lu Zhu could wake up tonight, it meant that he had already passed the critical period.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. Not hearing Gu Zhou’s response, she reached out and tugged at his sleeve. “Look, his fingers are moving again!”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s smiling face and frowned slightly. His eyes gradually darkened.

He rarely saw Qiao Nian so happy and unguarded.

At this moment, Qiao Nian was like an innocent child. All her emotions were written on her face.

On the bed, Lu Zhu’s eyelashes trembled and he slowly opened his eyes.

When Gu Zhou saw that Lu Zhu had woken up, he heaved a sigh of relief and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, they were sparkling.

When Qiao Nian saw that Lu Zhu had woken up, her breathing tightened. After spending so much time with Lu Zhu, she had always felt that Lu Zhu was a good person. Now that she knew that Lu Zhu might be related to her by blood, her feeling of closeness and dependence became even more obvious.

Qiao Nian felt a lump in her throat and her eyes reddened. She said excitedly, “You’re finally awake. How do you feel now? Does your chest still hurt? Do you need me to call a doctor over?”

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. Faced with her sudden concern, he frowned slightly. He didn’t answer Qiao Nian’s question. Instead, his gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face. “How long have I been unconscious?”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s hoarse voice, Qiao Nian’s heart tightened. She hurriedly asked, “Brother Zhu, do you want some water now? I can pour you some to moisten your throat.”

Chen Qing, who was standing at the side, was instantly speechless.

Previously, when Second Young Master was sick, she had not seen Second Young Madam so worried and anxious.

Why was Second Young Madam so concerned when Lu Zhu was sick?

Could it be that after this incident, Second Young Madam fell in love with Lu Zhu?

Oh my God!

This was simply a tragedy!

Chen Qing had a bad feeling and silently moved towards the door.

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian indifferently, his face expressionless. He was just a little surprised. Qiao Nian had never been like this before.

She seemed to be overly concerned about Lu Zhu.

Could it be because they were lifelong friends?

Gu Zhou frowned and quickly regained his composure.

Chen Qing saw Gu Zhou’s hand clench into a fist before letting go. Although it was only for a moment, Chen Qing felt that the Second Young Master was angry.

Lu Zhu wasn’t used to Qiao Nian’s concern, especially since Gu Zhou was still beside her.

Qiao Nian’s husband was Gu Zhou, but he was more like an unimportant person.

Lu Zhu felt that he shouldn’t let Qiao Nian have such improper thoughts. With a calm expression, he said, “Miss Qiao, you don’t have to be so concerned. If I need anything, I’ll tell the staff myself!”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
