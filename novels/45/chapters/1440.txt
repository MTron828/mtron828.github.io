1441 Sick

Lina nodded slightly and sighed softly. “My mother’s illness has been getting worse and worse recently. Our private doctor is helpless against her illness. I’ve also looked for many famous doctors in the world, but they can’t treat my mother’s illness!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, she frowned slightly and asked seriously, “Then do you know what illness your mother has?”

“It’s precisely because no one can tell me what my mother’s illness is that I don’t know what illness she has.” This was what troubled Lina the most, because her mother’s illness was a relatively strange illness. The doctors had never seen it. “The experts couldn’t even name my mother’s illness.”

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that this was the fastest way to get close to the European president. It was also a step closer to the truth. She thought for a while and said seriously, “Then what are your mother’s symptoms?”

“Speaking of which, it’s strange. My mother is usually like a normal person, but when she’s sick, her eyes become dull and she can’t speak. She just sits there smiling foolishly and drooling. Not only can’t she recognize my Dad, but she can’t recognize me either.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her heart beating violently.

This was simply a symptom of cerebral palsy.

Previously, she had thought that the President of Europe would not marry a person with cerebral palsy. However, from Lina’s description, the President of Europe had indeed married a wife with health problems.

If Madam President of Europe really had cerebral palsy, then she was very likely Teacher Shen’s daughter.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. Regardless of whether the President of Europe was the person who had kidnapped her twenty years ago, she wanted to investigate thoroughly.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. With a serious expression, she said, “The illness you described just now is a little complicated. Chinese medicine is most particular about examining, listening, asking, and interpreting. I need to see your mother to confirm the diagnosis.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes lit up. She asked hopefully, “Nian Nian, are you willing to treat my mother?”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Of course.”

She had wanted to get close to Lina first and find a time to get close to the European president.

If she treated Madam President, she would be able to get close to the President of Europe without arousing suspicion.

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief and said excitedly, “I wanted to ask you to treat my mother, but I didn’t think it was appropriate. Nian Nian, thank you so much!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“We’re friends,” Qiao Nian said sincerely. She hoped that the President of Europe wasn’t the person who had kidnapped her twenty years ago. She wanted to be good friends with Lina. “However, I’m not completely confident. I have to take a look at the patient first because I can confirm if she can recover!”

Lina smiled and nodded. She said understandingly, “Nian Nian, I understand everything you’re saying. Regardless of whether you can treat my mother’s illness, we’re all good friends. When we get home tonight, I’ll discuss it with my father. If he agrees, I’ll go over and pick you up to my house to treat my mother.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Okay!”

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang. She took out her phone and glanced at it. Her brother had sent her a document.

Qiao Nian only replied, “Got it.” Then, she told Lina about Bear Mountain Falls.

When they reached the bottom of Bear Mountain, Lina looked at the bathroom not far away and said, “Nian Nian, wait for me. I have to go to the bathroom.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. After Lina entered the bathroom, she took out her phone and opened the document her brother had sent her.

“Sugar, Madam President of Europe has never appeared in public. I heard that she’s from Country Z.”

At the bottom, Big Brother even sent a photo of Professor Shen’s daughter.

Qiao Nian looked at Professor Shen’s daughter. She was as beautiful as a fairy, but her eyes were dull. It was obvious that there was something wrong with her brain.

She had an oval face, phoenix-like eyes, a high nose bridge, and a small mole on the left side of her nose.

If one ignored the gaze of Professor Shen’s daughter, she looked like a classical beauty who had walked out of a painting.
