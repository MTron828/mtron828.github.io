Chapter 398: Leaving

Old Madam Gu made up her mind and said, “If you still remember how well I treated you in the past, then don’t ever appear in the Gu family again!”

With that, Old Madam Gu turned around and walked into the villa without looking at Jiang Yue again.

When Jiang Yue saw that Old Madam Gu was about to leave, she quickly got up and wanted to plead with her.

The butler walked forward and quickly blocked Jiang Yue’s path. He said coldly, “Jiang Yue, Old Madam has already made it very clear. If you still don’t know what’s good for you, I can only get the security guards to chase you out!”

Hearing the butler’s words, Jiang Yue’s face instantly turned pale.

If she was kicked out…

Tomorrow morning, everyone in the circle would probably know that she had been kicked out of the Gu family.

She was originally just the adopted daughter of the Gu family, and many people looked down on her. If that was the case, she would really become a joke in everyone’s eyes.

Jiang Yue tilted her head slightly and watched her grandmother leave. For some reason, she felt that her grandmother was a little hunched over.

She still remembered that Grandma’s back had always been proud and straight.

She had really hurt Grandma’s heart and misunderstood her. She regretted what she had done to Grandma back then.

Jiang Yue regretted it very much now, but it was useless to regret now.

Looking at Jiang Yue’s wailing face, Qiao Nian thought that perhaps Jiang Yue still had Grandma in her heart. However, to Jiang Yue, benefits were the most important.

......

Therefore, Jiang Yue was not worth pitying at all.

Qiao Nian looked down at Jiang Yue and asked indifferently, “Miss Jiang, do you need the security now?”

Jiang Yue’s expression changed drastically. She turned to look at Qiao Nian.

At this moment, she felt that Qiao Nian was like a high and mighty queen. She looked at her as if she were looking at an ant.

Jiang Yue slowly lowered her eyes. She knew that she had lost, completely.

What bothered Jiang Yue the most was that when Qiao Nian had first arrived, she had also looked at her with this same gaze.

However, things had changed.

Jiang Yue’s gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face again. She pursed her lips slightly, and her voice was as gentle as ever, with a hint of crying. “Brother Ah Zhou, when I leave in the future, you have to take good care of Grandma and care for her. She’s actually very lonely alone!”

Zhao Qian was speechless. Do you think I don’t exist? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou glanced at Jiang Yue indifferently, then walked over to Qiao Nian and pulled her into his arms.

Qiao Nian tilted her head to look at Gu Zhou. She had wanted to escape from him, but the man’s grip was too strong, not giving her a chance.

“In the future, with Mrs. Gu around, Grandma will definitely not be harmed!”

When Jiang Yue heard Gu Zhou’s words, her face turned pale again, and it became difficult for her to breathe.

By calling her Mrs. Gu, Gu Zhou was directly acknowledging Qiao Nian’s name. He was also telling everyone that Qiao Nian was the mistress of the Gu family’s villa.

Moreover, the latter half of Gu Zhou’s words were clearly mocking her. What he meant was that if she still stayed in the Gu family villa in the future, Grandma would very likely be in danger because of her.

Jiang Yue felt as if her chest had been stabbed by a sharp blade. She felt terrible. Her hands were clenched into fists, and her nails were deeply embedded in her palms. After a long time, she said, “Goodbye!”

Jiang Yue got up from the ground and walked towards the door.

She swore to herself that she would return here in the future and be forgiven by her grandmother.

Qiao Nian watched as Jiang Yue left. Her gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face again. She asked, “Shouldn’t you let go?”

Gu Zhou lowered his eyes slightly and looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes. “Didn’t you invite me?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned before she reacted.
