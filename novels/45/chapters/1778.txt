Chapter 1779 Relief

Hearing Qiao Nian's words, Lina lowered her head and looked at the wound on her hand. She pursed her lips slightly and said in a low voice, "Nian Nian, if you had encountered those things, you would have done the same."

"Lina, why do you have to put yourself in my shoes?" Qiao Nian asked in confusion.

Lina thought about it seriously and shook her head. "I think you're very outstanding. I think no matter what happens to you, you can quickly resolve all the problems and turn the situation around."

"Lina, have you ever thought that if you become like me, you won't be the person Chen Qing likes?"

When Lina heard the word "Chen Qing", she subconsciously recalled the scene when Chen Qing pressed her against the door and kissed her. She blushed and said, "Nian Nian, this, this has nothing to do with whether he likes me or not!"

"Of course it's related." Qiao Nian smiled at Lina and comforted her seriously. "Think about it. If everyone in the world is the same, then everyone will be the same. Basically, no one will fall in love and find another partner."

Lina frowned slightly. That seemed to be the case. Everyone will look at each other like they are looking at a mirror. It was indeed meaningless. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Everyone in the world is different. You're you and that is the best reality."

At this moment, Lina recalled what Chen Qing had said before. Chen Qing seemed to like her original appearance.

Lina's eyes gradually lit up. Perhaps it was as Chen Qing and Nian Nian had said. As long as she was herself, she didn't need to be like others.

Qiao Nian looked at Lina's thoughtful expression and knew that she was listening. The corners of her lips curled up slightly. "Actually, everyone has their bright spots. People who love you see your bright spots. In their eyes, your bright spots are like the sun that can illuminate the world."

Qiao Nian smiled and looked at Lina in front of her. She continued, "The reason why you think I'm awesome is because you like me. My strengths are also magnified infinitely in your eyes."

Lina pursed her lips slightly and said seriously, "Nian Nian, I think I understand."

"Lina, we're good friends. I like you from the beginning. You pushed me out to save me. Actually, at that time, I was very worried about you and felt sorry for you." Qiao Nian smiled and looked at Lina. "The love between us is mutual. In my eyes, you're kind and innocent. You're a little sun that people can't help but get close to."

The last bit of fog in Lina's eyes was peeled away. She seemed to see the sun and everything around her clearly.

"Nian Nian." Lina's voice was a little choked. She reached out to hug Qiao Nian and said softly, "Thank you."

If it wasn't for Nian Nian, she might still be immersed in self-denial.

Qiao Nian patted Lina's back gently and said gently, "I've said it before. Don't say thank you to good friends. If we're really talking about it, I should be the one thanking you."

"No." Lina shook her head gently, her voice nasal. "I should be the one thanking you."

"Everyone can be confused. It's good to get over it."

"Nian Nian, let's sleep together." Lina let go of Qiao Nian and sniffed.

Qiao Nian looked at Lina's red eyes and a trace of hesitation flashed across her face. She said helplessly, "Lina, I might not be able to sleep until later. What happens tomorrow is very important. We need to discuss how to deploy our troops. I might not have time to sleep tomorrow."

Lina tilted her head and leaned on Qiao Nian's shoulder. She said stubbornly, "Actually, I'm not tired at all. I'll accompany you!"

Actually, she couldn't sleep either. The thought of marrying Wright tomorrow didn't make her happy at all.

Seeing Lina like this, Qiao Nian smiled and said, "There are still many things to do tomorrow. Why don't we chat for a while first. You can sleep later?"

Lina sat upright and looked at Qiao Nian. After some thought, she said awkwardly, "Actually, I haven't thought about what to talk about…"

Qiao Nian smiled and looked at Lina. She knew that Lina could not sleep because of tomorrow's matter. The two of them casually turned on a television drama to watch.

At this moment, Gu Zhou had already rushed to Cui Huai's hotel with Gu Ting's men and drugged Cui Huai and the others.
