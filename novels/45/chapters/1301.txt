1302 Sneaky

Dao Wen and Zhao Song watched as Chang Feng brought the medicine box over. Dao Wen glanced at his watch and said to the two of them, “This won’t do. My stomach hurts a little. I have to go to the bathroom.”

Chang Feng nodded. He knew very well that ten minutes ago, after Mr. Chen had given them the mission to kill Gu Zhou, he had asked them to go to the armory to choose something. After they had chosen something, they had been called to the office by Mr. Chen.

During this period, Dao Wen had never had the chance to contact Cui Huai.

This time, Dao Wen would definitely send Cui Huai a message when he went to the bathroom. Chang Feng leaned against the sofa, holding the medicine box.

Every time they went on a mission, they would bring a medicine box. This was a life-saving item.

Chang Feng sighed heavily. This time, Mr. Chen had asked him to assassinate Gu Zhou because he wanted him to protect Gu Zhou.

However, if he protected Gu Zhou, Dao Wen would definitely tell Cui Huai that something was wrong with him. That way, Cui Huai would kill Mr. Chen and him.

Chang Feng gripped the medicine box in his hand tightly. In this line of work, either he or Dao Wen would die.

If necessary, he might have to sacrifice himself.

Chang Feng was not afraid of death, but when he thought of that soft Xiao Bao, he felt a little reluctant.

Zhao Song glanced at Chang Feng and said, “Brother Feng, I’ll go to the bathroom too.”

Chang Feng nodded. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

With that, he walked towards the bathroom.

Ba Song had just walked to the bathroom when he saw Dao Wen looking at his cell phone.

When Dao Wen saw Ba Song, his face turned pale, but he quickly pretended to be calm. He raised his eyebrows and asked, “Are you here to use the bathroom too?”

Ba Song nodded.

After Ba Song went in, the more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was wrong. Usually, they did not bring their phones with them when they went on missions. When they changed into their bulletproof suits, they had already placed their cell phones in the safe in the armory.

Dao Wen had two cell phones?

Realizing this, Ba Song frowned.

After Ba Song went there, he saw that Dao Wen had just walked out of the bathroom. He hadn’t heard Dao Wen wash his hands just now. Could it be that Dao Wen had been looking at his cell phone just now?

Realizing this, Ba Song’s expression darkened.

After Dao Wen left, his gaze fell on Chang Feng’s face not far away. Mr. Cui had just said that if Chang Feng did anything strange, he would shoot him to death.

Dao Wen tried hard to suppress the joy in his heart. As long as he could do this mission well, Mr. Cui would let him enter the core level. No one else had such treatment.

Chang Feng did not speak. Seeing that everyone was here, he walked out.

When he walked outside, he quickened his pace and walked to Chang Feng’s side. Just as he was about to say something, he saw Dao Wen walking over. He pursed his lips and did not speak.

When they walked to the car outside the villa, Dao Wen got into the driver’s seat first. Chang Feng walked to the trunk and placed the medicine box in his hand.

Every time they went on a mission, they would put the medicine box in the trunk in case of emergencies.

If anything really happened, they could save their lives first.

Seeing Dao Wen enter the car, Ba Song quickly walked to Chang Feng’s side and helped him put the medicine box in. He said in a low voice, “Brother Feng, I think there’s something wrong with Dao Wen.”

Chang Feng looked at Ba Song in confusion. “What’s wrong?”

“When I went to the toilet just now, I saw Dao Wen send a message. Didn’t they say that we couldn’t bring phones with us when we were on a mission? He went out with his phone this time.”

Ba Song felt that there were some things he had to tell Chang Feng. If Dao Wen was really a traitor, Brother Feng would be mentally prepared. “Dao Wen said that he wanted to go to the toilet just now, but he was actually sending a message. When I went over, he didn’t look well. He even hid his phone and seemed to have deleted the message. Brother Li, do you think he’s…”

Zhao Song looked at Chang Feng worriedly. In their line of work, they were most afraid of a traitor around them.

If there was really a mole, they were very likely to be betrayed.

With a mole around, the operation was most likely a failure.

It was fine if the mission failed. If he lost his life there…

Ba Song’s brow furrowed.

If he died on the battlefield, he would be a hero. If he died at the hands of his own people, he would be trash.

Chang Feng looked at Ba Song’s nervous expression and smiled. He gently patted Ba Song’s shoulder and said, “Aren’t you too nervous? Actually, I don’t think there’s a traitor around us. We brothers have been together for so many years. How can there be a traitor?”

“But aren’t our phones in the armory?” Ba Song asked in confusion.

Hearing Ba Song’s words, Chang Feng said in a low voice, “I’m guessing that Dao Wen might be in a relationship.”

“Huh?”
