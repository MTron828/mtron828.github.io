1047 Retreat to Advance

“Xin Xin.” Su Xue leaned over the bed and called out softly to Qiao Xin, whose eyes were blank.

When Qiao Xin heard Su Xue’s voice, her eyelashes fluttered, and her eyes gradually lit up. She looked at Su Xue, who was looking anxious.

She really wanted to ask why her mother was so heartless. Why did her mother betray her!

But when Qiao Xin saw the white hair on Su Xue’s head, she was slightly stunned.

!!

In the past, she had heard from others that when a person was extremely sad, their hair would turn white overnight.

Could it be that He Cheng was sowing discord?

“Mom?” Qiao Xin called out in a low voice.

Su Xue’s tears fell, and her voice trembled. She didn’t notice her completely white hair at all. She held Qiao Xin’s hand tightly. “Xin Xin, I’m sorry. I didn’t protect you well. I’ve let you suffer!”

When Qiao Xin thought of the humiliation she had suffered today, she yearned to cut those people into pieces. However, she quickly calmed down and put on a pitiful expression. “It hurts. It hurts!”

“Xin Xin, don’t worry. The doctor will definitely treat you.”

“Mom, I’m so dirty!”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words, her heart jumped to her throat. Tears streamed down her face as she said tearfully, “You’re not dirty. My Xin Xin is the cleanest. You’re definitely not dirty. Don’t worry, Mom will protect you well in the future. I won’t let you suffer again.”

Qiao Xin lowered her gaze, hiding the killing intent in her eyes. She still couldn’t be sure if her mother had betrayed her, but judging from her mother’s reaction, she shouldn’t have.

But why did He Cheng sow discord?

Qiao Xin thought for a moment and asked tentatively, “Mom, how do you plan to deal with Qiao Nian?”

Qiao Xin’s voice was hoarse. When she spoke, it was like the sound of rough tree bark rubbing against each other.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s question, she was slightly stunned. When she thought of Lu Zhu’s face, she couldn’t help but tremble.

Qiao Nian.

She yearned to tear Qiao Nian into pieces!

Could she really kill Qiao Nian?

It didn’t seem possible.

Her abilities were limited, and she couldn’t touch Qiao Nian at all.

“I’m sorry, Xin Xin. It’s Mom’s fault. Mom doesn’t dare to provoke the Lu family…”

Su Xue apologized tearfully.

Qiao Xin’s heart skipped a beat.

She had initially thought that her mother had not betrayed her. Everything was made up by He Cheng.

But at this moment, she understood that her mother had really betrayed her.

If her mother had not betrayed her, she would not have been taken away by Lu Zhu and suffered so much.

“Mom, have you already given up on me?” Suppressing her anger towards Su Xue, Qiao Xin pretended to be innocent and asked.

Su Xue had been covering her face and crying. When she heard Qiao Xin’s question, she slowly lowered her hand and looked at Qiao Xin with teary eyes.

She shook her head vigorously and hurriedly said, “Xin Xin, why would you think that? You’re Mom’s most treasured princess. Mom loves you the most. How can she give up on you?”

Qiao Xin lowered her gaze. She thought to herself that Su Xue had already given up on her once. This time, as long as she gave in and cried, Su Xue would definitely deal with Qiao Nian for her.

Su Xue had also taught her this move. It was called retreating in order to advance. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“But Mom wants to let go of Qiao Nian, who bullied me.” Qiao Xin paused and looked up at Su Xue. “So I can only let Qiao Nian bully me now, right?”

Su Xue’s expression froze.

She recalled what Lu Zhu had said previously. Now that Lu Zhu was willing to let Qiao Xin come back, did that mean that Lu Zhu no longer wanted to pursue the matter between the Qiao family and Qiao Nian?

“Xin Xin, Mom will definitely protect you,” Su Xue said firmly. “After you recover, we’ll leave this place and go to a place with no one around. Even Qiao Nian won’t be able to find you. Then, we’ll start from scratch, okay?”

“At the end of the day, Mom is still unwilling to attack Qiao Nian.” Qiao Xin looked at Su Xue in disappointment. She slowly closed her eyes, tears flowing down her face. “I understand now!”

“Xin Xin, don’t take things too hard!”

“Mom must be lying to me when she said that she doted on me. Now that I’ve been bullied by Qiao Nian, Mom still wants to let Qiao Nian off!” Qiao Xin said in disappointment. “Do you think you really love me?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words and saw how disheveled she looked, she asked in a trembling voice, “Then how do you want to deal with Qiao Nian?”

Qiao Xin’s eyes gradually turned cold. She said, “I want her to die!”
