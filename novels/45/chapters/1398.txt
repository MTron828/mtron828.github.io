1399 Eavesdropping

The two of them had just walked to the kitchen door when they heard Auntie Cao’s incredulous voice.

“What did you say? What nonsense are you spouting?”

Auntie Cao’s words were filled with surprise, as if she could not believe what she had heard at all.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou looked at each other, then moved closer to the kitchen door to continue eavesdropping.

“I’m spouting nonsense? Heh, let me tell you, I’m the most awake now!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This was a man’s voice. His voice was a little old, and his tone was filled with displeasure, as if he didn’t agree with Auntie Cao at all.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. She had a feeling that the two people in the kitchen were talking about Lu Qi.

Bam—

A crisp slap resounded throughout the room.

After a few more seconds, Auntie Cao’s angry voice came from the kitchen. “Is there something wrong with your brain? What you’re saying is all nonsense. I’m telling you, quickly shut up. I’ll go and confess to Matriarch!”

“Confess? What are you talking about?” The man sounded anxious. “I came to tell you this tonight. I just wanted to say that I’m leaving. I just feel that I’ve let you down for the rest of my life…”

Auntie Cao’s sobbing voice came from the kitchen. “You’re really muddle-headed. How could you leave me alone? How could you do such a thing? I don’t want you to leave. Don’t worry, I’ll confess. For the sake of our past relationship, Matriarch will definitely forgive me. I might not have the good days I have now, but you’re different. You can still be the butler. As long as you’re no longer muddle-headed, nothing will happen to us.”

“No, it’s too late.” The man didn’t seem to agree with Auntie Cao’s suggestion.

“It’s not too late. As long as I take the initiative to confess, it’s not too late.”

“It’s useless for you to help me confess. The young masters are so smart. They’ll definitely find out that I was the one who did it. When that happens, they’ll definitely be even angrier. Stay here. You’ll definitely be doing well by Matriarch’s side.”

“No, I don’t want you to leave me.”

“Sigh, it’s late at night. This is the best time for me to leave. If it’s any later, I might not be able to leave.”

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou exchanged glances. They stood there coldly. When the man walked out of the kitchen, they blocked his path.

Qiao Nian had already turned on the flashlight on her cell phone. When she saw Uncle Zhao, her expression changed slightly.

Uncle Zhao had never expected Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian to be standing outside the door. He was so frightened that his heart was in his throat, and his legs felt a little weak. If he hadn’t been holding onto the door frame, he might have knelt on the ground.

Qiao Nian put away her cell phone and turned on the lights in the living room and kitchen.

Auntie Cao, who had been silently wiping her tears in the kitchen, hurriedly ran out of the kitchen when she saw that the lights had turned on. When she saw Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, she was so frightened that she covered her mouth.

Gu Zhou looked down at Uncle Zhao. His voice was cold, like a demon from hell. “Uncle Zhao, it’s already so late. Where are you planning to go instead of sleeping?”

Uncle Zhao tried hard to remain calm. He gave a bright smile. “Eldest Miss, you’re back. Our son-in-law is also here!”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She had never expected to see such a good show tonight. Now, there was no need to investigate anything. There was already an explanation.

Auntie Cao looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. She didn’t know if the two of them had just returned or if they had been back for a long time. She thought of a way to change the topic. “Um, Old Zhao and I had been together for a long time, but we were too embarrassed to say it. After all, we’re two old people in a relationship, so we came out at night…”

“Do you think we’re deaf?” Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. He took a step forward, and the pressure he exuded made Auntie Cao and Uncle Zhao’s expressions change.

Uncle Zhao looked at Gu Zhou in front of him and took a deep breath nervously. His voice trembled as he asked, “You, you…”

“Yes, from the beginning to the end, not a word was missed. I heard everything.” Qiao Nian looked at him expressionlessly and said coldly.

Uncle Zhao pursed his lips tightly. He had the guts to do something like that, but he didn’t want to get himself involved.
