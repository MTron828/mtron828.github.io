1442 Warning

Qiao Nian looked at the photo of Professor Shen’s daughter and thought of Lina. Professor Shen’s daughter didn’t look like Lina at all. Perhaps Lina looked more like the President of Europe.

Qiao Nian closed the document. Some things had to be taken one step at a time. The most important thing now was to get close to the European president.

Qiao Nian put her phone into her pocket and looked up at the towering bear mountain in front of her. She wondered how long it would take for her to climb up.

When Lina came out of the bathroom, she saw Qiao Nian taking a photo of Bear Mountain on her phone. Smiling, she walked over to Qiao Nian and said, “The scenery at the top of Bear Mountain is even better. Nian Nian will definitely like it!”

Qiao Nian turned off her phone and said regretfully, “If only I had brought a camera!”

“I’ve thought of this long ago. I got someone to put it in the trunk!” Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Lina walked towards the car. When she reached the trunk, she asked the chauffeur to open it and instructed him, “Take out the camera and follow us up the mountain!”

Lina was the seventh princess of Europe. Usually, she was taken care of by a servant, and the chauffeur was Lina’s personal bodyguard.

As Lina’s bodyguard, not only was he skilled, but he also knew how to take photos.

The four of them walked into Bear Mountain. When they reached the stairs, Qiao Nian glanced at the introduction of the Bear Mountain Scenic Area.

There were a total of 10,000 steps needed to climb Bear Mountain. After climbing up and walking another 4,000 meters, one would be able to see the famous Bear Mountain Falls.

At the thought of climbing so high, Qiao Nian felt suffocated.

Lina smiled at Qiao Nian and asked, “Nian Nian, we can choose to climb the steps or take the cable car. Which do you like?”

Qiao Nian pondered for a moment and said, “Why don’t we walk?”

Although she hadn’t climbed a mountain in a long time, she recalled that she often climbed mountains with her senior brothers when she was young.

Time had passed. She was so busy every day that her feet didn’t touch the ground. It wasn’t easy for her to have time to come out and play. It was a good thing to exercise.

“Then let’s go this way.” Lina led Qiao Nian towards the stairs not far away.

Chen Qing and Lina’s chauffeur, David, followed closely behind.

Before the four of them could reach the stairs, they were stopped by a beautiful blonde woman in a leather jacket and pants.

Qiao Nian looked at the person blocking their path. She was a blonde, blue-eyed beauty with a high nose bridge and slightly thick lips. She stood with her arms crossed, accentuating her superior figure.

“I was wondering who it was. So it’s Seventh Sister.” Aisha walked up to Lina with a smile and looked down at her with interest. “Can your delicate feet walk now?”

Lina gave a polite smile and said, “Thank you for your concern, Fourth Sister. My feet have recovered and I can walk now.

“I’m your sister. It’s normal for me to care about you.” Aisha paused, her eyes sharp. “If I don’t care more about you, our royal family will be completely humiliated by you!”

Lina looked at Aisha without changing her expression. She smiled and said, “Fourth Sister, you should have other things to do!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Aisha took a step forward and moved slightly closer to Lina’s ear. In a voice so low that only the two of them could hear, she said, “Don’t think you can seduce Wright with that innocent face. Let me tell you, Wright is mine. You’d better stay away from him.”

“Fourth Sister is right.” Lina smiled gently. She looked at the ferocious-looking Aisha and continued, “Fourth Sister, if you have time to come to look for me, you might as well look for Wright and make your presence known in front of him. Fourth Sister, don’t you think I’m right?”

When Aisha heard Lina’s words, her face turned red with anger. She left angrily in her high heels.

Lina looked at Aisha’s retreating back and narrowed her eyes, her heart gradually sinking.

She and Nian Nian had only decided to climb Bear Mountain last night. If she remembered correctly, Fourth Sister was still in America yesterday afternoon. She could not help but overthink.

Lina watched as Aisha got into the car and drove off. Only then did she act as if nothing had happened. She smiled at Qiao Nian and said, “Nian Nian, let’s climb the mountain!”
