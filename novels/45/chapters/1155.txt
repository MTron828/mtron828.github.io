1156 His wife has been snatched away

Lu You and Su Yan frowned and glanced at each other. Back then, the other party had kidnapped Sugar and even found an adoptive family for her. They had actually given her a six million cheque.

That was twenty years ago!

The two of them could see the confusion in each other’s eyes. However, at that time, few families could fork out such a sum of money.

Qiao Nian continued, “I don’t know if the person who sent me to be adopted is my savior or one of those kidnappers. I think twenty years ago, not many people could fork out six million yuan!”

Lu Zhu frowned and said in a low voice, “Six million yuan was not a small sum at that time. That person was willing to fork out so much money probably because he hoped that the family who adopted Sugar would treat her well. But why did he kidnap you? This doesn’t make sense!”

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “I suspect it’s not the kidnappers.”

Lu Qi rested her chin on her hand and said in confusion, “If it’s purely a person who saved Sister when he saw injustice, that person wouldn’t take out so much money for Sister to adopt for no reason. How strange. Why didn’t that person send Sister home back then?”

“Could it be that they’ve done something wrong?” Lu Jiang’s expression darkened slightly, and his eyes turned cold. He said, “Otherwise, he would definitely have sent Sugar home. At that time, all the television channels in the country knew that our Lu family was looking for Sugar again. Even if they didn’t know whose child Sugar was, they could have sent her to the police station!”

“I think we should go and ask Forensic Doctor Shen An about the situation. We might be able to get an unexpected result!” Qiao Nian said seriously.

“Alright, alright. We’ll think about these things tomorrow.” Seeing everyone’s serious expressions, Matriarch Lu glanced at the time. It was already eleven in the night. “It’s getting late. Everyone, rest early.”

“Mom, rest first. We’re also preparing to rest,” Lu You said. He gestured for the servants to help Matriarch Lu upstairs to rest. Then, he looked at everyone. “Alright, everyone, leave!”

Qiao Nian nodded. Actually, she was also a little sleepy. She smiled at Lu You and Su Yan and said, “Mom, Dad and Grandma, we’ll go back first!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“What?” Lu You’s voice suddenly rose as he questioned in disbelief, “Go back?”

Lu You had just found his daughter and had not said much to her when her daughter was about to go to someone else’s house.

He felt as if his heart had been dug out. In an instant, he felt empty and desperate.

Su Yan felt the same way. Her eyes turned red as she looked at Qiao Nian’s face reluctantly, as if she had a thousand words to say. Then, she looked at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou looked at the way the Lu family was looking at Qiao Nian. In his life, he had only messed up with two people. One was Grandma, and the other was Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou’s thumb gently caressed Qiao Nian’s hand. He looked at Qiao Nian and suggested gently, “Let’s not leave tonight!”

Actually, he could understand Lu You and Su Yan’s feelings very well.

When Lu You heard Gu Zhou’s words, he stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. When he saw Qiao Nian nod, he was immediately happy.

Sigh.

If only he had firmly believed that Sugar was not dead back then. That way, he could have found her earlier. That way, Sugar could have grown up by his side!

However, on second thought, it was already a blessing in disguise to be able to find Sugar.

Lu Qi hurriedly followed happily. Holding Qiao Nian’s other arm, she said happily, “Sister, I’ve always wanted to sleep with you. Don’t worry, my bed is big and soft, and I don’t snore. If you sleep with me, it’ll definitely be a beautiful experience.”

Gu Zhou watched helplessly as Qiao Nian left him.

He had suggested staying because he wanted to live with Qiao Nian in the Lu family. He had never thought of being separated from Qiao Nian!

But now, it seemed that his wife was about to be kidnapped!

Sensing Gu Zhou’s resentful gaze, Qiao Nian turned back to look at him.
