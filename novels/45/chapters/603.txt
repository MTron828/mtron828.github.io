Chapter 604: Fans Meet Fans

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian was like a person drowning in darkness, unable to touch the light. She was also like a drowning person who couldn’t swim to the surface.

The suffocating feeling enveloped her. Her heart seemed to be clenched tightly by an invisible hand. It hurt terribly.

Previously, Brother Cao had only played the first part of the song for her. At that time, she was very relaxed and wholeheartedly immersed in the song. She had wanted to continue listening, but Brother Cao took the music away.

At that time, she hadn’t had enough. However, because she was going on stage to perform, her mind quickly shifted away from the song.

She had never expected the difference between the first and second half of the song to be so great.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She didn’t know under what circumstances Second Brother had composed such a completely different tune.

Qiao Nian sighed heavily. Her phone rang with a notification. She opened it and saw that it was from Gu Zhou.

“Little Qi is squatting under the curtains and not speaking.”

Qiao Nian imagined Little Qi squatting pitifully in a corner. He was still so young, but he had suffered so much that he shouldn’t have. She hurriedly replied, “I’m on my way home.”

After sending the message, Qiao Nian sighed heavily. She really hoped that Gu Qi was just pretending to be autistic to gain attention.

Su Sheng realized that Qiao Nian didn’t look well. She asked worriedly, “What happened?”

Qiao Nian forced a smile and said gently, “I’m just a little worried about the child.”

“Don’t worry, it’ll be fine,” Su Sheng said with a smile. The music changed, and the song was still played by Mr. Dong Hua. She changed the topic. “Are you also a fan of Mr. Dong Hua?”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Sheng’s question, she smiled and nodded. “Yes.”

“Me too. We’re all the same. How did you fall in love with Mr. Dong Hua’s music?” Su Sheng asked excitedly.

When fans met fans, as long as they talked about their idols, they would have many things to say.

At this moment, Qiao Nian was discussing Mr. Dong Hua with Su Sheng. The pain in her heart gradually dissipated. “I overheard it when I was young and fell in love with him.”

When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s words, she said with a look of longing, “I was under a lot of pressure when I was studying in high school. When I heard Mr. Dong Hua’s music, the pressure on me disappeared. He was the light on my path.”

Although Su Sheng’s words were a little cheesy, Qiao Nian could empathize. She had felt the same way back then.

“Mr. Dong Hua has a song that has a hypnotic effect. I heard from Senior Sister that she used that song to hypnotize a patient back then. The effect was especially good. Later on, she often used that song to hypnotize her patients. I was curious once and followed her. Just by listening to the song ‘Oxygen’, I was almost hypnotized.”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Sheng’s words, Gu Qing’s face flashed in her mind. When she spoke to her brother, her expression was as usual, and she seemed to be very close to him.

She wondered if Gu Qing knew that Second Brother was Mr. Dong Hua.

Qiao Nian was deep in thought when Su Sheng spoke again.

“I heard that you’re Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. I didn’t expect you to be his fan either,” Su Sheng said with a smile, her voice filled with joy. It was obvious that she was a very talkative girl.

Qiao Nian thought for a moment, then shook her head. “It’s still a little different.”

In the past, she had treated Mr. Dong Hua as her own light, but now that she knew that Mr. Dong Hua was her second brother, she felt a strange feeling in her heart.

Su Sheng asked curiously, “What does Mr. Dong Hua look like? Have you seen him?”

“No.”

“What a pity. Sigh, I really want to meet Mr. Dong Hua. He must be a handsome man.” When Su Sheng said this, her voice was filled with admiration.

Qiao Nian had only said that she had never met Mr. Dong Hua to avoid unnecessary trouble. One had to know that Second Brother had always liked to keep a low profile and never appeared in front of the media.

“I just think that talented people are handsome,” Su Sheng said with a smile.

Su Sheng looked straight ahead, her eyes flashing. From Qiao Nian’s attitude, she could tell that she was lying.
