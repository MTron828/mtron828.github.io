“I swear that I’ll definitely make you die without a burial ground!” Annie gritted her teeth and looked at the man in front of her viciously.

When Annie heard the words “Earl Mark”, her eyes lit up. She stared unblinkingly at the man, anticipating his next words.

“Earl Mark wanted to bring you back, but he was rejected by the President. A small fry like me doesn’t know the details. I only know that after Earl Mark returned, he made a statement.” The more the man thought about it, the happier he became. He had long disliked Annie. Using her status as a princess, Annie bragged everywhere. “The murder of the President’s Madam was planned by you alone. He even said that he wanted to cut ties with you!”

The light in Annie’s eyes instantly dimmed. She had never expected her father to cut ties with her.

No, this was impossible!

She was her father’s only daughter. How could her father not want her?

The man could naturally see Annie breaking down. He smiled coldly and continued, “So I advise you not to think about anything else. You’re only worthy of dying here for the rest of your life. Don’t even think about leaving. Earl Mark has already given up on you. He can’t save you!”

The man’s words exploded like a bomb, causing Annie’s mind to go blank. Stunned, she got up and sat on the ground in a daze.

“No!” Annie’s eyes gradually hardened. She looked at the man in front of her coldly and screamed, “You’re a liar. You’re lying to me!”

The man smiled coldly and placed Annie’s food on the ground at the side. Then, he stood up and mocked condescendingly, “It’s fine if you don’t believe me. That’s the truth. You b*tch, hurry up and eat. Don’t treat yourself as a princess anymore. You’re not worthy at all!”

The man narrowed his eyes slightly. He couldn’t understand. Couldn’t Annie be a princess obediently? Why did she have to murder Madam President!

One had to know that murdering the President’s Madam was a capital crime. Moreover, there was evidence that Annie was the culprit. There was no room for negotiation.

Even if the president was kind enough to give Annie a way out, Annie would definitely be demoted to a poor person.

The man looked at Annie’s dejected expression and recalled that Annie had actually slapped him. He kicked Annie angrily and turned to leave.

Annie was like a broken doll. After being kicked by the man, she fell heavily to the ground. The light in her eyes disappeared as the lights in the room went out. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In the darkness, Annie’s eyes were open. They were frighteningly bright. She crawled to the door of the room and slammed it hard, shouting, “Liar, you big liar. How dare you lie to me and hit me? Let me tell you, if my father finds out, he’ll definitely skin you alive and pull out your tendons, making you beg for death for the rest of your life.”

“Open the door, open the door!”

“I want to see my father!”

“I’m the princess. I order you to open the door!”

…

Annie screamed for a long time. Her hand hit the door so hard that it hurt. Even so, no one came to open the door.

That would never happen!

Annie was exhausted. She lay on the ground, exhausted. Her eyes were filled with pain, and tears fell to the ground one by one.

How was this possible?

How could her father abandon her?

Perhaps this was a scheme by the president to sow discord between father and daughter. If she believed the president, she would have fallen into his trap.

Annie’s hair was in a mess. She took the initiative to turn on the lights in the room. Her gaze fell on the food not far away and she walked over.

She had to live. She had to live well so that she could see her father.

Annie’s hands were covered in blood. She picked up the burger and ate it without a care, as if she had thought of something and couldn’t help but cry again.

The guards who had been guarding outside the interrogation room frowned when they heard Annie’s voice. They had goosebumps.

In the afternoon, Earl Mark’s statement was released and instantly became a trending topic.
