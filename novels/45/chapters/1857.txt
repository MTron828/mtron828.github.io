There was a low-profile black car parked not far from the villa.

Gu Zhou rolled down the car window, letting in fresh air.

Qiao Nian was wearing a mask and holding a listening device.

“Is there any movement?” Gu Zhou sat up slightly and looked at Qiao Nian. Qiao

Nian handed one of the earphones to Gu Zhou and said, “Looks like we’ll know the truth soon.”

In the villa.

Song Yu looked down at the buttons of her dress. She just hoped that the people inside wouldn’t realize that there was something wrong with her dress. Before she came here, she was worried that they would check her clothes.

“Auntie Cao, she’s…” Song Yu looked at Auntie Cao and asked.

Auntie Cao walked over to Song Ling’s side, her eyes filled with smiles. She said, “Sixth Miss, her name is Song Ling. Back then, your biological mother died in childbirth after giving birth to your sister, Song Xue. She’s your aunt.

I’m your third aunt.”

When Song Yu heard Auntie Cao’s words, her expression changed. “How… how is this possible? How can you be my family? I was clearly kidnapped from the orphanage…’

“Yu’er, I know it’s hard for you to accept everything I’m saying, but I’m indeed your aunt. Back then, your mother and I had the best relationship. Sit down first.” As Song Ling spoke, she walked to Song Yu’s side and pulled her to the sofa. “Actually, you’re a child of our Song family. Back then, we had no choice but to send you to the Lu family.”

Song Yu frowned slightly and retracted her hand from Song Ling’s with a firm expression. “I don’t understand what you mean.”

“Sixth Miss, no, I should call you Yu’er now.” Auntie Cao looked at Song Yu gently and said, “What we’re doing now is to take back everything the Lu family owes your aunt. However, we’re weak alone, so we can only use such a roundabout strategy.”

“I don’t understand what you mean. Moreover, why did you call me over?” Song Yu went straight to the point, her eyes filled with confusion.

“Yu’er, we need your help. Now that the Lu family is so heartless to you, don’t you want to stand above them?” Song Ling looked at Song Yu with a smile, her red lips filled with endless charm.

Song Yu frowned and did not speak directly, as if she was conflicted.

“Song Yu, let me tell you a story!” Song Ling smiled at Song Yu, not seeming to be angry at her hesitation. “Back then, Su Yan and I were good friends.”

Song Yu’s eyes widened uncontrollably. She looked at Song Ling in disbelief. “You and Mom were good friends.”

Seeing Song Yu like this, Auntie Cao couldn’t help but shake her head and remind her, “You’ve already been chased out of the Lu family. The Lu family has already treated you so cruelly. Madam doesn’t even help you. Why are you still calling her Mom?”

Song Yu lowered her head in a daze, her eyes filled with sadness.

Song Ling glanced at Auntie Cao, then said gently to Song Yu, “You don’t have to be sad. Su Yan is a beast in human skin. This has to do with my husband, Zhou Jin. The location of the Lu family’s building in A City was originally a piece of land my husband and I had taken a liking to. At that time, there was demolition and relocation, so many tenants had to move away. No one was willing to take over this matter. We realized that the profits were very high, so we persuaded all the tenants to move.”

“There was only an eighty-year-old grandmother who had no children left. At that time, we were discussing this matter with her and wanted to persuade her to sign and leave, but the old Grandma was persistent that this was her former home and refused to leave no matter what.

“Later on, she finally relented and accidentally knocked over the candles on the table. The Grandma was about to extinguish the candles with water, but the more anxious she was, the more troublesome it became. Grandma accidentally tripped and fell towards the coal stove at the side. At that time, she was wearing cotton clothes. Soon, her clothes caught fire.”

“My husband wanted to pull her up, but he didn’t expect the fire on her to burn him. My husband reached out and pushed her away, but he didn’t expect her to hit her head on the corner of the table and die.”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“At that time, Su Yan was at the scene. We wanted to call the police, but she said that it was obvious that it was an accident. As a forensic doctor, she would help us clear our name of murder. However, we never expected her to turn around and sell us out. Then, the Lu family occupied our piece of land. It was precisely because of that piece of land that the Lu family was able to reach its current state..”
