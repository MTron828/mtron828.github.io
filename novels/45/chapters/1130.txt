1131 Dead because of you?

On the surface, he was the one taking care of Jiang Cheng, but in reality, Jiang Cheng was the one taking care of him!

Jiang Chi read the diary faster and faster. It didn’t take long for him to finish reading it. He closed it heavily.

Seeing that Jiang Chi was in a low mood, Qiao Nian sympathized with him. She hesitated for a moment and said, “He chose you. You should thank him and live a good life!”

Jiang Chi took a deep breath. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s high heels and he could see her slender ankles.

“Jiang Chi, you should know very well now that my eldest brother once saved your brother. Shouldn’t you let go of the grudge between the two of you?” Qiao Nian continued.

Jiang Chi looked up. His eyes were red-rimmed, and his blue eyes were filled with sorrow. His surroundings were still bloodshot, and he looked very sad but filled with hatred.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Chi’s sad expression. She had hated him for a long time, but she suddenly realized that she hated the wrong person. She thought for a while and said, “Your brother must want you to be happy.”

Jiang Chi pursed his lips and looked down at the diary in his hand. After a while, he said, “I’m sorry, I misunderstood previously.”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Jiang Chi was a person who could distinguish right from wrong.

However, Jiang Chi’s words in the next moment made Qiao Nian’s heart jump to her throat again. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“My brother died because of you?”

Caught off guard, Qiao Nian met Jiang Chi’s blue eyes. The moment their eyes met, she felt the killing intent coming from Jiang Chi.

If looks could kill, she would have been torn to pieces by Jiang Chi long ago.

Qiao Nian thought of what was written in Jiang Cheng’s diary. Jiang Cheng had indeed died because of her, but it was impossible for her to compensate Jiang Cheng with her life. The only thing she could do was find the murderers of Jiang Cheng and bring them to justice.

Gu Zhou noticed Jiang Chi’s murderous gaze. He sat forward slightly, blocking Jiang Chi’s view of Qiao Nian. He met Jiang Chi’s gaze coldly.

“Do you still want to find a random sacrificial lamb or scapegoat to avenge your brother?” Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly. “Do you want her to be that sacrificial lamb or scapegoat?”

Without waiting for Jiang Chi to speak, Gu Zhou’s eyes instantly turned cold. He continued, “She didn’t know about those things at all. If you really want to take revenge on her, beat me first!”

Qiao Nian sat beside Gu Zhou. When she heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart warmed. It was as if Gu Zhou would protect her no matter what. This feeling was so good!

“Take revenge on her?” Jiang Chi narrowed his eyes slightly. His words were cold as he gritted his teeth and said, “As you said, she didn’t even know my brother at that time. What’s the use of taking revenge on her?”

When Gu Zhou heard Jiang Chi’s words, he stared unblinkingly at him, as if he was trying to determine if he was telling the truth!

“Let’s find the culprit. When the time comes, you can avenge Jiang Cheng!” Qiao Nian sat forward, staring unblinkingly at Jiang Chi.

“Take revenge?” Jiang Chi repeated.

No matter what the price was, Jiang Chi only hoped that Jiang Cheng could come back to life. However, God would not give Jiang Cheng another chance to come back to life!

In his impression, his younger brother was as warm as the sun, but such a beautiful brother had been killed!

“My brother is really too naive. He’s too innocent. He hasn’t experienced evil before. The world is sinister.” Jiang Chi’s heart ached so much that he wanted to die. “It’s my fault!”

Jiang Chi had traveled everywhere. As he was used to seeing the darkness of society, he did not want Jiang Chi to see those dark things. He would sweep away all the obstacles for his brother.

It was precisely because he had protected Jiang Cheng too well that Jiang Cheng was so innocent.

Jiang Cheng knew that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was not dead, so he wanted to bring her to Lu Zhu to repay him for saving his life.

Jiang Cheng definitely didn’t know that when he exposed other people’s secrets, those people would kill him cruelly!

It was his fault. He had underestimated human nature. He had failed to protect Jiang Cheng!
