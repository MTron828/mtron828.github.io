1519 Puppet

What surprised Chen Qing was that Lina was the princess he had to protect. He shouldn’t be the person she cared about.

She looked small, and her eyes were still a little red when she was anxious. She kept staring at his hand.

He glanced at his hand, which was already wrapped in gauze. Under such circumstances, he couldn’t see the condition of the wound.

Chen Qing retracted his hand. His gaze fell on Lina’s face and he said seriously, “Thank you, Seventh Princess. I’ll go look for Second Young Master and Second Young Madam.”

Just as Lina was about to say something, she saw that Chen Qing had already left.

She looked at Chen Qing’s back. Her heart seemed to be empty, and she felt disappointed and uncomfortable. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A trace of confusion flashed in Chen Qing’s eyes. Just now, Second Young Master and Second Young Madam were talking to him in the pavilion. He didn’t know when he had fallen asleep, but he had been sleeping there.

…

The next day.

The sun was shining brightly.

Under the butler’s lead, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian arrived at the dining area of the palace. At this moment, the president’s family of three was sitting at the table.

When Lina saw Qiao Nian coming over, she ran up to her happily and took her arm. Smiling, she said, “We didn’t know what you liked to eat, so we prepared some breakfast in An City and our country. Look and choose what you like to eat.”

The president also stood up and invited Gu Zhou to sit down with him. There was no need for him to get up, but when he thought of how Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had saved them yesterday, he stood up to express his gratitude.

Shen Mei sat there, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. Her eyes were bright, and her expression was much better than before.

After exchanging pleasantries, Qiao Nian sat down opposite Madam President. She could see Madam President’s expression. Now, it seemed that Madam President’s expression was much better than yesterday.

During the meal, the President scooped some soup for Madam President and placed it in front of her.

Holding a spoon, Madam President scooped up the soup herself, feeling a little uncomfortable. She even stole a few timid glances at Qiao Nian. When she saw Qiao Nian smiling at her, her face instantly turned red, and she lowered her head even more.

Qiao Nian lowered her head to eat, observing Madam President’s condition.

The president noticed that Qiao Nian had been observing Madam President, and his heart was filled with gratitude.

Fortunately, Qiao Nian was around. Otherwise, their entire family wouldn’t know how they would suffer.

After breakfast, the President realized that Shen Mei had no intention of resisting Qiao Nian. Instead, she had been sizing her up curiously.

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Shen Mei was no different from a normal person. Moreover, her eyes were no longer unfocused.

A thought flashed across her mind. Actually, Shen Mei’s cerebral palsy might have recovered long ago.

Cerebral palsy was indeed difficult to treat from birth, but it could be cured from behind the scenes. Moreover, after it was cured, it would not affect one’s intelligence.

After breakfast, the President and Madam prepared to take a walk. Gu Zhou and Chen Qing left, and Lina held Qiao Nian’s arm as they followed the President and Madam.

Shen Mei was in a good mood. When she walked to the garden, she looked at the courtyard full of flowers and called Lina to help her pick them.

Seeing Shen Mei and Lina chatting and laughing, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile.

The president looked at his wife and daughter in the distance, his eyes filled with gentleness and doting. He looked at Qiao Nian beside him and hesitated for a moment before walking over to her and asking in a low voice, “Miss Qiao, how is my Madam’s health now? You can tell me the truth.”

He sighed slightly and said softly, “I’m prepared for the worst.”

When Qiao Nian heard the president’s words, she knew that he wanted to hear the truth. Only then did she say, “When I took her pulse, I realized that her skin and tongue were purple. I knew that she had been poisoned.”

When the president heard the word “poisoned”, his expression changed.

“The poison of the Teng Yang Flower has already corroded her internal organs. She’s fine because of the Hypnotic worm in her body. A portion of the poison has already been absorbed by the Hypnotic worm in her body.”

“What? Hypnotic worm? What’s that?”

“I only realized that she was poisoned and has a Hypnotic worm when I saw the Teng Yang flower yesterday.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment. She stood under the sunlight, but her words were as cold as ice. “After some time, when the puppet Hypnotic worm grows up, Madam will become a puppet.”
