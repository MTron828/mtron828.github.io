Chapter 376: Jealousy

“Xu? Don’t you think he’s Miss Su’s current director?”

“This age doesn’t match. Director Xu is only 35 years old this year. Could he be Best Actor Xu, who has already retired?”

“Perhaps he’s a rich businessman with the surname Xu.”

…

Song Yu stood there calmly, ignoring everyone’s guesses. In her opinion, the rest of the matter could be resolved by her management team.

Since the authenticity of the stone wall painting had been confirmed, the auction continued.

“Next, let’s welcome our next item!”

Zhang Lei’s voice brought everyone back to their senses.

Qiao Nian’s hands were a little sore from painting for so long. Coupled with the fact that she had her head lowered the entire time, her chest felt a little tight. She said something to Gu Zhou and walked towards the balcony.

When she walked to the balcony, she felt that her breathing was smooth. The huge rock that had been weighing on her heart seemed to have disappeared.

At this moment, the door to the balcony opened.

...

Qiao Nian turned around and saw Qiao Yu standing there with a dark expression.

Qiao Yu pursed his lips tightly, as if he was controlling something.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze indifferently and looked into the distance. “Why are you here?”

“Silly Qiao Nian.”

Qiao Yu’s voice was no longer as dark as before. Instead, there was a trace of warmth.

Qiao Nian frowned. This voice sent a chill down her spine.

While Qiao Nian was in a daze, Qiao Yu walked up to her and followed her gaze, looking at the beautiful fountain downstairs.

Qiao Nian sensed Qiao Yu approaching and subconsciously distanced herself from him.

Ignoring Qiao Nian’s little gesture, Qiao Yu turned to look at her and asked with a smile, “An City is even more prosperous now than it was in the past. I wonder how long it will take for it to appear on your painting.”

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly, and she couldn’t help but think about her memories.

.

“Brother Qiao Yu, does An City look good?”

“It’s very beautiful.”

“If only I could go and take a look.”

“When you grow up, I can take you to see it, but for now, I can take photos and give them to you.”

“Really?”

“Yes.”

“Thank you, Brother Qiao Yu.”

She was only five years old that year, and that was the first time she had seen Qiao Yu. Moreover, she had no idea that Qiao Yu was her “brother”.

Qiao Nian came back to her senses. Her gaze fell on Qiao Yu’s eyes and she said coldly, “Mr. Qiao, don’t you know how long I’ve stopped painting?”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he narrowed his eyes dangerously. “Mr. Qiao?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Yu calmly. She raised her eyebrows slightly and said, “Last time at the hotel, I’ve already cut ties with the Qiao family, haven’t I?”

Qiao Yu’s lips suddenly curved up. “Yes.”

Although Qiao Nian didn’t know what Qiao Yu meant, she had a bad feeling about this.

In her opinion, Qiao Yu was a lunatic. She couldn’t be bothered to say another word to him. She turned around and walked in.

Qiao Nian had just pushed the door open when she saw Qiao Xin walking towards her angrily.

“Qiao Nian, what are you thinking? Why did you bring my brother here?”

After what had happened at the hotel, she had long fallen out with Qiao Nian. She couldn’t be bothered to continue pretending.

Qiao Nian glanced back at Qiao Yu and saw that he was staring unblinkingly at her. Her gaze fell on Qiao Xin’s face again and she snorted. “You’ll have to ask your brother about that. You’d better watch your brother closely in the future!”

With that, Qiao Nian walked in without looking back.

Qiao Xin could clearly sense that Qiao Nian was looking down on her, but it wasn’t appropriate for her to argue with Qiao Nian on such an occasion. The way she looked at Qiao Nian grew colder and colder.

This wouldn’t do! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She would never allow Qiao Nian to steal her brother’s love!

Qiao Xin walked over to Qiao Yu and took his arm, complaining unhappily, “Brother, Qiao Nian has really gone too far. Dad has already been released from prison, but she doesn’t even come home to visit him. Moreover, Mom has become ostracized because of her. Our good family has been torn apart by her!”

Qiao Yu didn’t speak. He just stared at Qiao Nian’s back, his eyes flickering with a complicated light.
