1102 Missing

Qin Chuan arrived at the private room on time. He pushed the door open and walked in.

Qiao Nian looked up.

Qin Chuan’s golden hair sparkled under the light. His hair was 60-40 centimeters long, and his bangs had been styled. He looked like a shining star on stage.

He was wearing a sweater and did not look like a businessman at all. He looked lazy and harmless.

!!

Qin Chuan looked very devilish. When he smiled, he looked like a beautiful poppy flower. One could only look at him from afar and not touch him.

“Sister Nian!” When Qin Chuan saw Qiao Nian, he gave her a doting smile and called out happily.

From the moment Qin Chuan opened the door of the private room, Gu Zhou had been staring at him. This man looked very demonic, but he exuded a masculine aura. There was no feminine feeling at all.

He had heard from Qiao Nian in the past that Qin Chuan and Qiao Nian had grown up together. From the way Qin Chuan looked at Qiao Nian, he was certain that Qin Chuan and Qiao Nian must be especially close.

Qiao Nian stood up, a bright smile on her face. Her eyes sparkled as she walked up to Qin Chuan. “Old Qin, I want to introduce you to my husband today.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she glanced at Gu Zhou, who was already standing beside her with his arm around her waist. She introduced, “Gu Zhou.”

Qin Chuan looked at Gu Zhou and said, “I met you once at a charity auction.”

With that, he handed his hand to Gu Zhou with a bright smile. “It’s an honor to meet you!”

Gu Zhou reached out and shook Qin Chuan’s hand.

After meeting briefly, everyone sat down.

Only then did Qiao Nian remember that Gu Zhou had also participated in Qin Chuan’s charity auction. At that time, her relationship with Gu Zhou was relatively cold, and the two of them treated each other with respect. In addition, at that time, both of them subconsciously wanted to keep their marriage a secret, so she didn’t introduce Gu Zhou to Qin Chuan.

But now, her relationship with Gu Zhou was different. That was why she had introduced Gu Zhou to Qin Chuan. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In just a few months, her relationship with Gu Zhou had developed very quickly.

Gu Zhou looked at Qin Chuan and said politely, “I heard from Nian’er that Old Master Qin is your grandfather?”

Qin Chuan took a sip of coffee and placed the cup back on the table. He nodded. “Yes.”

Gu Zhou instantly recalled that on the night of August 15, six years ago, he had been set up. His eldest brother had disappeared.

He had heard from others that his brother wanted to introduce Old Master Qin to him that night. He wanted to confirm it again, so he asked, “Six years ago, did my brother visit your house and look for Old Master Qin?”

“Six years ago?” Qin Chuan’s expression turned serious. He pursed his lips slightly and said, “He did come to the Qin family because he brought the medicinal herbs Grandpa wanted the most. At that time, Grandpa agreed to go out for a consultation for the first time.”

Qin Chuan recalled what happened six years ago. He clenched his fists under the table and said in a low voice, “Before Grandpa left, I even prepared many medicinal herbs for him. However, after he left with your brother, he disappeared!”

They actually disappeared without a trace!

Everyone thought that they had been in a car accident, but there was only an old car at the event location. No one was there.

Gu Zhou received an accurate answer from Qin Chuan. His breathing quickened, and his heart seemed to be clenched tightly by an invisible hand.

In Gu Zhou’s impression, his brother had always been very strict. If he didn’t finish his homework, he would be punished to stand. At that time, he had always felt that his brother hated him.

However, he had never expected his brother to secretly treat Old Master Qin.

Big Brother was just a brother who looked strict on the surface but was gentle on the inside.

Qiao Nian noticed the change in Gu Zhou’s expression. She reached out and held his hand, as if silently comforting him.

Gu Zhou noticed Qiao Nian’s small actions. He looked up at Qiao Nian and forced a smile.

Qin Chuan frowned, his brow filled with worry. He said, “All these years, I’ve been looking for your brother and my grandfather, but I haven’t heard from them yet. If you have any news, please let me know. I’ll tell you when I receive any news. We can share information.”
