Chapter 1730 - 1730 Injured

If Chen Qing shot Wright at this moment, he would be a wanted person. What awaited him was very likely the death penalty.

In other words, Chen Qing could risk his life for her.

At this moment, Lina gradually sobered up.

She couldn’t let Chen Qing become a murderer. She had to think of a way to get the best of both worlds.

What should she do?

What could she do?

Lina gripped the blanket tightly around her. Tears welled up in her eyes.

If Nian Nian encountered such a thing, what would she do?

She felt that Nian Nian would never be as incompetent as her when stopping Chen Qing from killing Wright. Nian Nian would definitely think of a good solution.

Lina pursed her lips slightly. She had already decided not to be a fool and learn from Nian Nian. Then, she quickly calmed down.

Now that Chen Qing was threatening Wright, he couldn’t move.

Wright’s guards were worried that Wright would be hurt, so they didn’t dare to attack Chen Qing.

If they let Wright go now, once his life was no longer in danger, he would definitely bully her again shamelessly.

What should she do?

She should let Wright never dare to come in again!

Lina recalled what her father had said previously. Her father had instructed Wright not to sleep with her, but Wright had not taken her father’s words seriously at all.

Lina frowned, feeling troubled.

Out of the corner of his eye, Wright glanced at the guards not far away. Then, he gently moved his finger, indicating for the guards to quickly use Via as a hostage.

The two guards near Via immediately understood and pulled her up from the ground. Holding a dagger to Via’s neck, they said coldly, “Let go of Prince Wright quickly, or I’ll kill this maid directly!”

Chen Qing and Lina looked over and saw the cold dagger pressed against Via’s neck, as if it would cut through her skin in the next moment.

Seeing this, Wright smiled happily.

So what if Chen Qing was skilled?

Now that his men were using Via to threaten Chen Qing, Chen Qing would definitely put down the gun in his hand.

When he took the gun from Chen Qing, he would definitely point it at Chen Qing’s forehead and make him kneel and beg for mercy.

Right, after that, he would let Chen Qing watch another free love movie!

He wanted to sleep with Lina in front of Chen Qing and make him beg for death.

At this moment, a gunshot interrupted Wright’s beautiful dream.

Wright felt a little pain in his calf. He looked down and saw Chen Qing shoot at his leg. The bullet grazed his left calf.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wright looked at Chen Qing in disbelief and saw the gun aimed directly between his eyebrows, as if a bullet would come out of the gun in the next moment.

Chen Qing looked at Wright coldly and said, “Do you think I won’t dare to shoot?”

Wright’s eyes widened, and they were bloodshot. The veins on his forehead bulged ferociously as he said angrily, “Kill her! Kill her now!”

When the guard heard Wright’s order, he prepared to slit Via’s neck.

Slowly, Via closed her eyes. She knew that her life was about to end.

Fortunately, the princess was fine.

However, the expected pain did not come. The dagger that had been pressed against her neck seemed to have moved away. It was as if a gust of wind had brushed past her just now.
Trembling, she opened her eyes and saw the Seventh Princess standing in front of her. The princess’s fair and flawless hand was stained with blood, and the princess was holding the dagger.

“Princess!” Via called out, her heart aching. Her gaze fell on the Seventh Princess’s hand. “Your hand is bleeding. How can you use your hand!”

“Seventh Princess!” Chen Qing called out anxiously.

“Lina!” Wright looked at her in disbelief.

Lina pursed her lips. Her hand hurt terribly, and cold sweat broke out on her forehead.

However, she knew very well that she could not show her weakness at this moment.

She was the seventh princess of Europe and definitely not Wright’s plaything!
