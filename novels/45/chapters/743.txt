744 Auntie, For You!

Qiao Nian walked out of the paternity test center. She folded the report back up and put it into her bag.

When she faced Doctor Li, although she looked calm, her mood instantly sank to rock bottom when she walked to the underground parking lot.

Logic told her that even if Gu Zhou was Gu Qi’s biological father, this could only mean that Gu Zhou was hiding this from her.

Who didn’t have an unspeakable past?

But she was still very upset.

Her mind was in a mess. Her rationality and emotions collided. She needed to consider how to face Gu Zhou and Gu Qi in the future.

After Qiao Nian left, Doctor Li took out his phone and called Gu Zhou.

Doctor Li had thought that Second Young Master Gu would take a long time to pick up his call, but he did not expect Gu Zhou to pick up instantly.

He was stunned. In fact, he had yet to think of an excuse.

“How is she now?” Second Young Master Gu’s cold voice came through the phone.

“I’ve already given the real report to Second Young Madam. She doesn’t look well.” Doctor Li thought for a moment and continued, “When she mentioned finding her family, her expression improved a little.”

After a long time, just as Doctor Li thought that Second Young Master Gu had hung up, Second Young Master Gu’s slightly hoarse voice came through the phone. “Got it.”

Doctor Li frowned. He could hear the disappointment in Second Young Master Gu’s words. After some thought, he mustered his courage and asked, “Second Young Master, actually, you can choose to hide this matter. Why did you let Second Young Madam know?”

Just as he finished asking, he realized that Second Young Master Gu had already hung up.

At this moment, in the Gu family villa.

He had lied to Qiao Nian on purpose.

He still remembered what Qiao Nian had said to him when he found out that she knew Gu Qi.

“I just didn’t expect you to have such a heartless friend.”

“He’s a boy, but his father doesn’t care about him at all. He always thought that his father liked girls and even specially wore girls’ clothes. This is simply too much. If this isn’t heartless, what is?!”

“What’s the name of your heartless friend?”

…

Gu Zhou still clearly remembered Qiao Nian’s indignant expression.

He massaged his temples in frustration and walked towards the window, looking out sadly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After a while, Gu Zhou saw Qiao Nian’s car driving back.

His heart skipped a beat.

He knew what was about to happen and couldn’t help but feel nervous. Without hesitation, he walked downstairs.

Qiao Nian parked the car in the garage, frowning. She didn’t know how to face Gu Zhou.

Along the way, she tried her best to persuade herself to remain rational. Even after returning to the Gu residence, her heart was still in a mess.

After sitting in the car for a while, Qiao Nian got out.

She had just walked out of the garage when a young voice rang out from the side.

“Auntie!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked over and saw Gu Qi running over happily.

Gu Qi ran up to her. After stopping, he looked up at Qiao Nian, then took out a piece of candy from the small bag he was carrying and held it in front of Qiao Nian with both hands.

“Auntie, here you go!”

Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart gradually calmed down. She felt as if she was enveloped in warmth. Her entire body was warm and extremely comfortable.

She bent down slightly and took the candy from Gu Qi. Smiling, she said, “Thank you, Xiao Qi.”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, a bright smile appeared on his face. His voice was relaxed and happy. “Grandma gave me so many pieces of candy. I had to give Auntie one!”

When Matriarch Gu, who had walked over, heard Gu Qi’s words, a loving smile appeared on her face. She praised, “I gave him a lot of candy. He said that you liked strawberry-flavored candy, so he took it out alone. As soon as he saw you return, he couldn’t wait to look for you!”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She tried hard to put on a smile and gently patted Gu Qi’s head.

After Qiao Nian placed the candy in her mouth, she instantly felt a sweetness in her mouth, completely driving away the fear and unease in her heart.
