Chapter 302: Scandal

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Nian. Although she knew that Lu Nian was a part of this family, the thought of him being Mr. Dong Hua made her involuntarily nervous.

His music brought her out of the darkness.

He was her guiding light.

He was her idol and pillar of support, so she would always be at a loss of words.

Qiao Nian pondered for a while, then said, “Just call me Nian Nian, just like Grandma.”

Her answer was according to Lu Nian’s wishes.

Matriarch Gu said helplessly, “You’ve struck gold!”

Lu Nian smiled happily, then his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He asked, “Shouldn’t there be a conclusion today about Xia Xue?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded.

If she wanted to deal with Xia Xue, she could just move her little finger.

After breakfast, Qiao Nian carried the violin to school.

When she reached the school gate, she realized that everyone was looking at her strangely, as if she were a vicious beast.

Qiao Nian frowned. She had a bad feeling about this.

“How can such a person still have the cheek to come to school?”

“If I were her, I would have found a place to hide long ago. How would I dare to come to school?”

“You don’t understand. She can only be with old men with her looks. How can she not go out on the streets? If she doesn’t, won’t she lose her job?”

“I really didn’t expect our school to produce such a scum. I hope the principal will chase her away quickly!”

“Previously, I heard her play the violin so well. I thought she came to this school on her own. I didn’t expect her to get in through the back door!”

“Her violin skills are much better than Senior Xia’s!”

“Really?”

“What a pity that you weren’t there!”

“What do you know? The old man who kept her likes the violin, so she risked her life to play the violin just to get that old man to keep her. It was also so that that old man could send her here!”

“Really?”

“How can that be fake? There are already photos. Hurry up and go take a look at Baidu Tieba [1. Baidu’s online forum]!”

“Could it be that someone else is deliberately creating hype to frame her because he envied her talent?”

“How is that possible? Didn’t you hear what she said? She taught herself how to play the violin and zither. Do you think someone who came from the countryside has the ability to make the school make an exception and accept her?”

“The eyes of the public are sharp. Now that the matter has been exposed, I’ll see how she’ll still have the cheek to stay here in the future.”

…

Listening to the whispers of those people, Qiao Nian roughly understood what had happened.

It was obvious that Gao Lin and Xia Xue were behind this.

The moment Qiao Nian entered the classroom, she saw Wang Xuan running over, panting.

“Nian Nian.”

“What’s wrong?” Qiao Nian looked at Wang Xuan in confusion.

“You don’t know who’s making this up. Hurry up and look at Baidu Tieba!” Wang Xuan said anxiously.

Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan walked into the classroom and asked casually, “Inelegant photos?”

Wang Xuan nodded slightly.

“Then there’s no need to look. It must be fake,” Qiao Nian said calmly.

“There’s a photo of you getting into Second Young Master’s car!”

Qiao Nian recalled what had happened yesterday evening and instantly understood.

Those people would probably have photos of her getting into a luxury car. Then, they would photoshop some indecent photos. When that happened, word would spread like wildfire. What was fake would become real. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Then what do you plan to do?” Wang Xuan looked at Qiao Nian worriedly.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were cold, and her red lips curved up wickedly. She said unhurriedly, “Since they want to cause trouble, let’s add fuel to the fire!”

Wang Xuan looked at Qiao Nian in surprise and confusion. “What kind of logic is that?”

Qiao Nian said confidently, “Don’t worry, just wait for the show.”

At this moment, Gao Lin walked in arrogantly in her high heels.
