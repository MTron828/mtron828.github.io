His sexy thin lips curved up slightly. They had not seen each other since that concert.

Qiao Nian kept her head lowered, anxiety written all over her face. Had something happened?

With this thought in mind, Lu Nian took the initiative to walk up to Qiao Nian and stop her.

Qiao Nian had been walking with her head lowered the entire time. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed that there was someone in front of her. She moved slightly to the left, wanting to circle around him, but she didn’t expect the man in the suit to continue walking in front of her.

She walked to the right, but the man in front of her still moved in front of her.

Puzzled, Qiao Nian looked up. When she saw Lu Nian’s face, her heart skipped a beat.

Second Brother!

Qiao Nian wanted to greet him. When she thought about how her eldest brother hadn’t told Second Brother about her, she realized that if she rashly acknowledged him as her brother, it would probably cause unnecessary trouble.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian suppressed the address she had almost blurted out and smiled at the man in front of her.

The man had a pair of beautiful phoenix-like eyes. The ends of his eyes were raised. His eyes were filled with starlight and temptation, making one unable to look away.

Qiao Nian wanted to call him “Brother”. Although they acknowledged each other as god siblings last time, perhaps Second Brother was just joking. She couldn’t take him seriously.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian said, “Lu…”

“Sister Nian,” Lu Nian called out, inadvertently interrupting Qiao Nian.

His voice was low and hoarse, soul-stirring.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. Her eyes were filled with Lu Nian’s charming face. She still remembered the first time she saw Lu Nian and was stunned by his appearance.

Qiao Nian looked up at Lu Nian. She didn’t expect that the first person she recognized was her biological brother.

“Brother Ah Nian!” Qiao Nian called out softly.

Lu Nian looked at Qiao Nian. For some reason, he felt that Qiao Nian’s smile was especially sweet today. He smiled and said softly, “Yes.”

Qiao Nian had a thousand words to say, but she didn’t know what to say. When she thought of how Gu Qi was still waiting for her at home, she smiled and said, “Brother Ah Nian, when are you free? Shall I treat you to a meal?”

Lu Nian had been a little busy recently. Every time he composed, he would lock himself in his room and not leave. He had wanted to refuse, but when he saw the smile on Qiao Nian’s face, he swallowed his words.

“Tomorrow will do,” Lu Nian said with a smile.

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew brighter. “Okay, I’ll call you tomorrow.”

“Hm.”

Qiao Nian waved at Lu Nian and walked out.

When she saw Second Brother just now, she was in a good mood. However, when she thought of Gu Qi’s situation, she frowned again.

At this moment, the elevator door opened again and Lu Zhu walked out.

Lu Zhu happened to see Qiao Nian and Lu Nian waving goodbye. He also saw the smile on her face. He had mixed feelings.

During his time with Qiao Nian, she would smile at him too, but she had never been so obedient and sweet.

Perhaps it was because the situation was not right.

At that time, they were in MY. As he had been shot, his body was weak, and his injuries hadn’t recovered. Every time Qiao Nian smiled at him, her eyes were filled with worry.

Sigh.

If only he wasn’t sick.

Then he could see Sugar’s sweet smile.

Lu Nian retracted his gaze from Qiao Nian. When he turned around, he inadvertently saw Lu Zhu looking at Qiao Nian’s back in disappointment.

His brow furrowed and his thin lips pursed.

Although his eldest brother didn’t have an aversion to women, he would never get so close to other girls, much less stare at them.

Lu Nian looked at Lu Zhu calmly. For some reason, he felt that Lu Zhu seemed to be jealous.

Lu Nian gasped.

Could Third Brother words be true?

Lu Nian quickly walked up to Lu Zhu, blocking his view of Qiao Nian.

“When you saw Su…” Lu Zhu had just said the word “Sugar” when he saw Lu Nian’s serious gaze. Could it be that Lu Nian and Sugar had yet to acknowledge each other?

That made sense. Sugar was a person with a sense of ritual. She would definitely want to be able to formally acknowledge her relatives properly.
