Chapter 60: Stuck Out Like a Sore Thumb

Su Yan watched as Wang Qi and Qiao Nian left. His brow furrowed deeply. He pressed his lips together, remaining quiet.

Qiao Xin, who was standing beside Su Yan, carefully tugged at his sleeve. She said gently, “Su Yan, let’s go to the lecture hall!”

Su Yan recalled how embarrassed he had been just now and yearned to find a place to hide. He agreed easily. “Okay, let’s go!”

After Su Yan and Qiao Xin left, the other students followed suit.

Shen Xing was livid. She followed Su Yan and Qiao Xin, determined to find an opportunity to embarrass Qiao Nian.

Although Su Yan had just embarrassed himself, many of his classmates still wanted to get in his good books. They wanted to join the Su family’s company in the future.

A classmate stepped forward with a smile and said ingratiatingly, “Senior Su Yan, since five years ago, everyone knows that you’ve been taking good care of Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian likes you too. I guess the principal is looking for Qiao Nian this time because of you. Perhaps he wanted to give Qiao Nian a warning beforehand, so he asked her to go to the principal’s office alone.”

As soon as she said this, the onlookers immediately nodded in agreement.

“That’s right, that must be it. The principal and his assistant must be afraid that Qiao Nian’s mental illness will flare up again. That’s why they’re so polite to her!”

“Definitely. The principal must be treating Qiao Nian with such gentleness on Senior Su Yan’s account. Senior Su Yan, do you want to make your relationship with Qiao Nian clear? Otherwise, the principal might misunderstand you.”

…

Su Yan was momentarily stunned.

That was true.

The principal must have treated Qiao Nian so gently because of him. He must have called Qiao Nian to the principal’s office alone to warn her.

The principal didn’t get his assistant to call Su Yan into his office because he thought Su Yan was preparing his speech.

It seemed that he should take the initiative to speak to the principal about this, lest the principal misunderstand.

Qiao Xin’s tense shoulders gradually relaxed. Only then did she realize that she had been wrong.

That was true. Qiao Nian hadn’t been to school. How could she have gotten a PhD?

It was even more impossible for her to have anything to do with the principal.

Qiao Xin heaved a sigh of relief. She didn’t want Qiao Nian to climb on top of her.

When everyone arrived backstage, they saw that the principal’s assistant had arranged for Qiao Nian to sit in the middle of the first row.

Everyone was stunned.

What was going on?

The seat in the middle had always been reserved for the principal. Qiao Nian actually had the guts to sit in the principal’s seat without hesitation.

Today, Qiao Nian was wearing a white shirt and jeans. Her hair was tied up high into a bun behind her head, and a few stray hairs fell on either side of her face. She looked just like a student.

She was already eye-catching to begin with. Once she sat in the middle, she attracted everyone’s attention.

The seats in the second row were filled with famous teachers and formidable top students of An University. All of them were considered to be gifted and favored by heaven.

And Qiao Nian stuck out like a sore thumb. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As the representative of the outstanding graduates that year, Su Yan sat in the third row. He glanced at Su Yan, his expression darkening.

Qiao Nian was sitting in the first row today. She was simply looking for trouble!

Su Yan didn’t want to interfere in this matter. However, he thought that the principal might have misunderstood that he had a special relationship with Qiao Nian. What if the principal got angry and took it out on him?

Qiao Xin, who was standing beside Su Yan, also felt embarrassed. She felt that Qiao Nian had truly brought disgrace upon the entire Qiao family.

Qiao Xin thought for a while, then shouted at Qiao Nian, “Qiao Nian!”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s voice, she didn’t even bother giving her a glance out of kindness.

Qiao Xin had no choice but to raise her voice. “Sister, you’re sitting in the wrong seat. Apart from the outstanding graduates, everyone who comes to the banquet brings their own stools..”
