1478 Bodyguard and secretary?

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes and looked at Wright with a complicated expression.

Before coming to Europe, she had learned about the situation in Europe in advance.

There was endless internal strife in the European royal family. The president’s brother and third brother were eyeing the throne covetously, both wanting to be king.

Back then, after the President took over, he conferred his biological brother the position of Earl and openly lowered their titles to consolidate his royal power.

However, the president’s brother and third brother were unwilling to have their statuses lowered, and the two of them were unwilling to let the other party take advantage of them, resulting in the current three-way situation.

Wright was the adopted son of the first earl, and he had been carefully selected by the first earl.

In the past few years, the most important thing for Wright was to woo Lina.

The assassination yesterday had caused an uproar. Anyone with a good eye would know what had happened. Under such circumstances, Wright still dared to look for her. It was obvious that Wright was fully prepared. He was certain that the president would not attack him.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. It seemed that the strength of the First Earl couldn’t be underestimated.

Lina looked at Wright, who was not far away, and her face turned red with anger. She pursed her lips tightly and said in a trembling voice, “Last night, I went home with Dad. I wanted to look for you today to see how you were, but I didn’t expect him to chase after me as soon as I arrived at your house!”

Qiao Nian held Lina’s hand gently and said softly, “Don’t be angry. It’s not worth getting angry over such a person. Let’s go over and take a look and see what he has to say!”

Qiao Nian’s voice was very gentle, but there was no trace of gentleness in her eyes. Instead, they were filled with coldness. She looked at Wright as if she had seen the thing she hated the most.

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, the uneasiness in her heart gradually disappeared. She nodded in agreement.

In her eyes, Qiao Nian was a safe and reliable person. She would be at ease with Qiao Nian by her side.

Seeing Qiao Nian and Lina walking towards the door, Wright’s lips curved up slightly. He stuffed his hands into his pockets smugly, his gaze inadvertently landing on Chen Qing’s face.

This was the man who had hugged Lina yesterday.

Wright’s eyes sharpened. He questioned angrily, “What’s your relationship with Lina?”

Chen Qing glanced at Wright coldly, then retracted his gaze and ignored him.

If it weren’t for the fact that Lina was about to walk over, he would have punched Chen Qing in the face. This would make Chen Qing realize that a lowly person like him shouldn’t have carried their most respected Seventh Princess.

Wright’s expression darkened. He asked his assistant, “Who is this person?”

The assistant had already investigated Chen Qing beforehand. If he didn’t do well by Prince Wright’s side, he might have to drink toilet water again.

The assistant said impatiently, “Prince, his name is Chen Qing. He’s Gu Zhou’s bodyguard and secretary.”

“So you’re the bodyguardand secretary.” Wright’s lips curled up slightly. He walked up to Chen Qing and mocked, “Look at how you hugged Lina yesterday. I really should take a photo and let you take a good look at your bootlicking appearance. You’re just a commoner. Do you think you can be with our European Seventh Princess? I advise you to stop daydreaming!”

When Lina heard Wright say that about Chen Qing, her expression suddenly changed and she frowned slightly.

Chen Qing looked at Wright expressionlessly and said calmly, “You look like a mad dog!”

The relaxed expression on Wright’s face instantly disappeared, and he looked at Chen Qing coldly.

Although he was not the president’s child, most people in Europe were still respectful to him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Chen Qing’s words had already offended him.

An ordinary person from Country Z actually dared to argue with him, the Prince of Europe. He was looking down on their country!

Wright looked at Chen Qing with a dark expression. He raised his chin arrogantly and looked down at him. “Some people should know their limits and recognize their own identity!”

When Lina walked to the door and heard Wright’s words, her heart seemed to be clenched tightly by an invisible hand, and her eyes turned red.
