1078 Regret

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes darkened.

It was all his fault. If he had believed Qiao Nian six years ago, the two of them wouldn’t have been strangers.

Qiao Yu’s heart seemed to be clenched tightly by a heartless hand. It hurt so much that he was about to suffocate.

If he could go back to six years ago, he would definitely stand firmly by Qiao Nian’s side.

!!

The last time he was in MY, Qiao Xin had disappeared for no reason. At that time, he had suspected that it was related to Qiao Nian, but he had broken Qiao Nian’s heart again.

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered with these cheap shots and tricks. Qiao Yu took a deep breath and glanced at Qiao Xin.

Ever since he returned to the country, everything Qiao Xin had done had exceeded his expectations. He couldn’t believe that Qiao Xin was his younger sister. In his impression, his younger sister was obedient and adorable, but Qiao Xin was sinister and vicious.

This time, Qiao Xin was complaining that Qiao Nian had attacked her. She even said that Qiao Nian had caused her innocence to be ruined.

He didn’t believe Qiao Xin’s words, because he felt that Qiao Xin was no longer the younger sister in his heart.

Qiao Yu got someone to investigate the matter. In the end, he realized that his sister was the one who in the wrong. His sister had bought that kind of dirty medicine. His sister had gotten He Cheng to deal with Qiao Nian.

Even the people in the temple had been specially hired by He Cheng to deal with Qiao Nian.

However, all of this was retribution for Qiao Xin. In Qiao Yu’s opinion, Qiao Xin had brought this upon herself!

Qiao Yu really didn’t dare to think about it. His only thought was that it was fortunate that Qiao Nian hadn’t gone to that temple.

“I…” Qiao Yu stopped talking and said, “Stay for a meal!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Yu’s words, he frowned imperceptibly.

“There’s no need to eat. We have to leave first!” With that, Qiao Nian took Gu Zhou’s arm and walked out.

Qiao Xin watched as Qiao Nian left.

This was unfair!

This world was not fair at all! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian was just a wild girl from the countryside. How could she be liked by Gu Zhou?

Even though Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, she had always lived in the countryside. She exuded a poor aura, and her eyes were clear and stupid.

Qiao Nian was far inferior to her. The person standing beside Gu Zhou should be as outstanding as her.

Qiao Xin thought of how her reputation had been ruined. She yearned to tear Qiao Nian into pieces. If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, how could she have been bullied?

Right!

Qiao Nian wasn’t a clean person either!

Six years ago, she had found an old man to spend a night with Qiao Nian.

If Gu Zhou knew what had happened to Qiao Nian six years ago, he would definitely be separated from her.

“Stop right there!” Qiao Xin said coldly.

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Xin’s words, he frowned. He reached out and grabbed Qiao Xin’s arm, saying in a low voice, “Don’t mess around!”

“Brother, I’m not messing around. I just want to tell the truth!” Qiao Xin said solemnly.

Qiao Yu frowned. He didn’t think Qiao Xin would say anything nice. He said coldly, “Go and offer incense to Grandma now. You don’t have to worry about what’s going on here!”

Qiao Yu meant for Qiao Xin to shut up!

Qiao Xin naturally understood what Qiao Yu meant. She knew that Qiao Yu liked Qiao Nian and wanted to protect her, but she had to trample on Qiao Nian. If she didn’t have a good life, she wouldn’t let Qiao Nian have it easy either.

Qiao Nian stopped in her tracks and turned to look at Qiao Xin. She raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, “Are you planning to apologize to me?”

Qiao Xin was slightly stunned. With the last of her anger left, she questioned, “You ruined my reputation. You’re the one who should apologizing!”

Without waiting for Qiao Nian to speak, Qiao Yu said angrily, “What nonsense are you spouting? Hurry up and offer incense to Grandma. Don’t stay here!”

Qiao Yu wanted to chase Qiao Xin away, but Qiao Xin had already thought it through. She would never let Qiao Nian off the hook. Without even looking at Qiao Yu, she said, “Qiao Nian, if you apologize to me now, I can be merciful and accept your apology!”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, “I think you’re wrong!”

“What?” Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in surprise.

“Didn’t you think of that move yourself? In the end, it backfired on you. Don’t you deserve it?” Qiao Nian said with a smile.
