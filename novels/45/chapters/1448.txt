1449 Stop the bleeding

Qiao Nian comforted Lina and wanted to stop the bleeding for David. She turned around and saw David looking at her with a burning gaze.

David gave a sincere smile and asked seriously, “Madam Gu, can you help me bandage my leg again?”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on David’s leg. David had already done a simple treatment, but from the bandaged leg, she could tell that the blood was still flowing out. She nodded and said, “I’ll help you stop the bleeding.”

“Thank you, thank you, Madam Gu. You’re the best.” David’s eyes were slightly red. Without waiting for Qiao Nian to speak, he swiftly untied the bandage.

Qiao Nian took out the remaining silver needles and inserted them into David’s leg a few times. Then, she took out the silver needles.

David hurriedly bandaged his wound with the sleeve of his shirt he had torn off himself. He looked at Qiao Nian gratefully. “Madam Gu, thank you so much. You’re really a good person. You’re an angel sent by God to the mortal world.”

“You’re welcome. Let’s leave quickly.” With that, Qiao Nian turned to look at Chen Qing and said, “I’ll leave Lina to you.”

Chen Qing immediately understood. He wanted to carry the Seventh Princess on his back, but he was worried that he would touch the Seventh Princess’s injuries. He could only change his method and pick Lina up.

Lina’s head was spinning. Her gaze inadvertently fell on Chen Qing’s sleeveless arm. The muscles on his arm were bulging. She lowered her head shyly and inadvertently leaned her head against Chen Qing’s chest.

Lina’s pale face flushed unnaturally.

Chen Qing was so focused on his surroundings that he didn’t see Lina’s shy expression at all.

Holding a branch with both hands as a walking stick, David struggled to follow behind Qiao Nian and Chen Qing.

This time, they continued on the trail. They hadn’t gone far when they heard the sound of a car engine behind them.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. She hurriedly gestured for Chen Qing and David to hide behind a tree.

From their angle, they could see the road not far away. Six cars were parked beside their previous car.

The people in the car swiftly got out and surrounded their original car.

After the driver of the third car got out, he didn’t surround Lina and Qiao Nian’s car like everyone else. Instead, he walked to the back seat and opened the door very respectfully.

A tall man with fair skin stepped out of the car. He was wearing a black suit and was tall and straight. His hair was an unruly brown, and his dark brown eyes were malicious.

When David saw the man, he lowered his voice and said, “It’s Prince Wright, Madam Gu. We can ask Prince Wright for help!”

Qiao Nian glanced at David, then shook her head and said, “Let’s wait and see!”

“Prince Wright is the son of the seventh princess’ uncle, and also the prince of the earldom. He’s always liked the seventh princess,” David said softly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lina, who had been leaning against Chen Qing’s chest, opened her eyes slightly. She was already in so much pain that she couldn’t breathe. She tried hard to open her eyes and said breathlessly, “Don’t go!”

David had been following Lina. He naturally understood what Lina meant.

Just as David was about to say something, Wright’s furious voice came from afar. “What, they’re not here? How is that possible? Lina couldn’t have run far with her injuries.”

The bodyguards in black suits were so frightened that they lowered their heads, not daring to make a sound.

Wright gritted his teeth and said angrily, “Find them. Even if you have to dig three feet into the ground, you have to find them. If anything happens to Lina, I’ll take your lives!”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her heart filled with confusion. How did Wright know that Lina was injured?

Other than them, only the people who attacked Lina knew that she was injured.

Could it be that Wright had sent someone to assassinate Lina?

Qiao Nian glanced at David and said in a low voice, “We should be able to meet up with our people in about fifteen minutes. Let’s go down the mountain first.”

Although David didn’t understand what Qiao Nian meant by that, he knew that Qiao Nian would definitely take good care of the princess, so he nodded in agreement. “Okay!”
