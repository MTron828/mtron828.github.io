1284 Going Home Together

Xiao Bao was still too young. Although he understood what family was, he would still be sad not to be with his family.

Gu Zhou stood at the side and watched as Qiao Nian comforted Xiao Bao. He walked over to them and sat down, pulling them into his arms. He said softly, “Xiao Bao, don’t feel bad. When we get home, you still have your brother, sister, and great-grandmother. They’re all looking forward to you coming home.”

When Xiao Bao heard Gu Zhou’s words, he recalled his brother and sister. He secretly wiped his tears and looked up at Gu Zhou, asking seriously, “When can I see them?”

“Let’s take a plane back later, okay?” Gu Zhou smiled and patted Xiao Bao’s head, his tone gentle.

Xiao Bao had heard from Uncle Feng in the past that his brother, sister, and great-grandmother all lived in An City. An City was very far from MY. He hesitated for a moment and asked curiously, “Then will we come here again?”

“Yes.” Gu Zhou nodded solemnly. His phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, filled with determination. His tone turned serious. “We’ll bring our family back home!”

Xiao Bao’s lips gradually curved up. He nodded seriously and said happily, “I want to come too. Then I can see Daddy!”

At this moment, Xiao Bao and Gu Zhou reached a consensus and made a promise to each other.

The family of three walked out of the amusement park.

Qiao Nian carried Xiao Bao in her arms. Gu Zhou carried Xiao Bao’s school bag and called Chen Qing on his phone.

Before he could unlock his phone screen, Chen Qing called.

“Hello?”

Chen Qing’s anxious voice came from the cell phone. “Second Young Master, something has happened!!!”

Gu Zhou frowned and asked in a low voice, “What happened?”

…

Chen Qing stepped on the accelerator all the way, completely ignoring the traffic rules. Every time he passed a red light, he honked without hesitation.

When the cars on the road saw Chen Qing’s car, they all avoided it. When Chen Qing’s car left, they poked their heads out of the windows and cursed.

Chen Qing looked at the tablet on the front passenger seat. The tablet displayed car information from HH Corporation. He said to Gu Zhou, “Second Young Master, several cars from HH Corporation are driving directly towards the amusement park you’re at. I wonder how many of them there are. Hurry up and find a place to hide. I’ll bring people over now!”

After Chen Qing hung up, he switched to the view of the cars by his side. Seeing those cars following closely behind, he heaved a sigh of relief. He only hoped that Second Young Master could hold on!

…

This time, he and Qiao Nian had brought a total of four bodyguards to pick Xiao Bao up.

Chen Qing knew his situation very well. The reason why Chen Qing said that meant that there were many people here.

Gu Zhou took Xiao Bao from Qiao Nian and said in a low voice, “We can’t go out yet. Let’s find a place to hide and wait for Chen Qing to pick us up!”

Xiao Bao was originally sad. Now that he saw Gu Zhou’s serious expression, he became nervous as well. He gripped the gun in his pocket tightly and said in a childish voice, “Second Daddy, Mommy, don’t be afraid. Xiao Bao can protect you!”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Bao’s gentle voice, she smiled and said, “Xiao Bao is really amazing. You’re a man. But at this moment, we can protect you. Xiao Bao, you don’t have to worry.”

Xiao Bao nodded. He thought to himself that he should let his second daddy and mommy make the first move. If they were in danger, he would interfere.

Gu Zhou was very vague, and he did not expect Xiao Bao to understand. It seemed that Big Brother had taught Xiao Bao a lot about safety.

Qiao Nian spoke very gently to Xiao Bao, but when she looked at Gu Zhou, her expression turned serious. “In that case, let’s hide first.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Xiao Bao is best at hiding. Daddy said that if anyone sees Xiao Bao and wants to catch him, Xiao Bao has to hide first. When the time comes, I’ll wait for Daddy to look for me!” Xiao Bao said seriously.
