715 Pain

This was the first time Qiao Nian had seen Jiang Yue so hysterical.

Sadness, anger, and grievance mixed together.

The pain on Jiang Yue’s face was even greater than when she had been chased out of the Gu family by Grandma Gu.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. At this moment, she felt that she might have misunderstood Jiang Yue.

Song Yu, who was standing not far away, also felt that everyone might have misunderstood Jiang Yue. No matter what, Jiang Yue had grown up in the Gu family since she was young. She had good grades, good looks, and a good figure. She was the child of another family in the eyes of many parents, and also a goddess in the eyes of her peers.

All this time, Jiang Yue had always been as gentle as water. No matter what, she would value her dignity and cultivation.

How could such an outstanding Jiang Yue do such a vicious thing?

Moreover, Jiang Yue might have really suffered this time, which was why she was so angry.

Song Yu lowered her eyes and recalled what had happened in the Buddhist hall.

Actually, Jiang Yue was right. She had also secretly investigated Hyacinth’s flower symbolism.

The meaning of those three colors was indeed not good.

Qiao Nian’s words were also a little far-fetched.

However, when Qiao Nian said that she had been reborn, she hit the nail on the head. Everyone hoped that the eldest daughter of the Lu family could be reborn as soon as possible and not suffer underground.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and her gaze fell on the perfume in Jiang Yue’s hand. Was this bottle of perfume very important to Jiang Yue?

This was also the first time Matriarch Lu had seen Jiang Yue lose her composure. Her gaze fell on the perfume bottle in Jiang Yue’s hand. In a daze, she seemed to have seen this perfume bottle before.

Suddenly, a thought flashed across her mind. Matriarch Lu’s expression instantly softened. She looked at Jiang Yue gently and said, “This bottle of perfume was left behind by your mother, right?”

When Jiang Yue heard Matriarch Lu’s words, the tears in her eyes fell uncontrollably. Her voice was a little choked as she looked at Matriarch Lu pitifully. “I didn’t expect Grandma Lu to still remember this. This bottle of perfume was my mother’s legacy!”

When Matriarch Lu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she recalled what had happened previously and said, “This bottle of perfume was originally a birthday gift from my old friend to your mother. At that time, I was the one who accompanied her to buy it. At that time, your mother loved lilies the most. We found many perfume shops before we found this fresh and elegant perfume. I really didn’t expect you to still bring this bottle with you all these years.”

When Jiang Yue heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she lowered her gaze slightly and looked at the perfume in her palm. Tears fell from the corners of her eyes and landed on the perfume bottle, as if she was missing her late mother.

Jiang Yue hurriedly raised her hand and carefully wiped the tears off the perfume bottle. She said softly, “Mother passed away early. This is all she has left. This is my only consolation!”

She thought again of the past. If her mother had still been alive back then, she would have been better off than she was now.

But there were not so many ifs in this world.

Jiang Yue gripped the perfume in her hand tightly, tears flowing down her face in pain.

Seeing Jiang Yue like this, Qiao Nian glanced at the perfume in her hand.

Suddenly, she smelled the fragrance of lilies.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s bag.

If this bottle of perfume was what Jiang Yue cared about the most, then Jiang Yue would definitely be reluctant to use it.

Qiao Nian walked over to Jiang Yue. She noticed that Jiang Yue’s perfume smelled of jasmine, and the perfume in her bag smelled of lilies.

The things poured out of the bag meant one thing. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jiang Yue did not use the perfume she was wearing today.

Jiang Yue had only brought her mother’s belongings today.

If that was the case, even if there was no perfume in Jiang Yue’s bag, it shouldn’t be the fragrance of lilies.

If Jiang Yue had really used her mother’s perfume today, why did she still wear perfume that smelled different?

Qiao Nian stared at Jiang Yue. Jiang Yue looked at the perfume in her hand with a cherished expression, as if this bottle of perfume was her most precious possession.

However, she would not let Jiang Yue off just because she pretended to be pitiful.

She had a feeling that Jiang Yue was behind this.
