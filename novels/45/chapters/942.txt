943 On What Basis?

But the Qiao family was already in danger because of what Su Xue and Qiao Xin had done.

It seemed that the Qiao family could only rely on Qiao Yu in the future.

Qiao Yu lowered his gaze. After some thought, he looked at Su Xue and said, “Mom, Grandma’s death anniversary is coming up. When the time comes, go and invite Qiao Nian.”

At this moment, Su Xue was thinking about how she had kept a gigolo more than twenty years ago and was cheated of a million yuan by him, so she didn’t hear Qiao Yu’s words.

After Qiao Yu finished speaking, he did not receive a response from Su Xue. He frowned slightly and called out again, “Mom?”

“Huh?” Su Xue came back to her senses. Seeing that everyone was looking at her, she lowered her gaze in a panic and sighed. “I was thinking about Qiao Nian just now. Sigh, it was all my fault back then. If I had treated her better, it wouldn’t have come to this!”

Qiao Yu looked at Su Xue with a complicated expression. He didn’t completely believe Su Xue’s words, but he still repeated what he had just said!

When Su Xue heard this, she asked expectantly, “Are you trying to use your grandmother’s relationship to get close to Qiao Nian so that she won’t hold it against Qiao Xin?”

“No.” Qiao Shan enunciated each word clearly. “It’s to beg Qiao Nian to let our Qiao family off. Do you think the Qiao family can withstand the anger of the Lu family?”

Qiao Xin shrank back and sobbed softly. She really knew that she was in the wrong.

When Qiao Yu heard Su Xue’s words, he immediately frowned, his eyes turning cold. “Don’t have such thoughts again.”

Seeing Qiao Xin looking at him indignantly, Qiao Yu’s voice deepened. “Don’t mention this in front of Qiao Nian. Besides…”

His gaze fell on Qiao Xin’s face. This sister of his was truly pitiful and pathetic. “She might not let Qiao Xin off!”

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Yu’s words, he immediately disagreed. Wouldn’t they have to beg Qiao Nian even more?

On what basis?

Qiao Nian was just a little girl. Would she go so far?

“If she hadn’t caused trouble when she was young, your grandmother wouldn’t have fallen, let alone been paralyzed. Your grandmother treated her so well. How could she have the cheek to argue with our family?” Qiao Shan felt that anyone who rejected asking for a favor was a fool!

Su Xue nodded in agreement and said, “If it weren’t for her, your grandmother would definitely have lived a few more years!”

Qiao Yu sneered and said coldly, “Are you trying to morally guilt trip her? Do you want the Qiao family to disappear as soon as possible?”

Qiao Yu had never expected that his family had never realized what they had done wrong, nor did they know how to repent sincerely.

He had wanted to make everything clear, but he suddenly realized that his parents and Qiao Xin were both the same. They only knew how to scheme against others and never cared about others.

How selfish!

Moreover, he had more or less been influenced by the Qiao family’s bad habits. During Qiao Xin’s surgery, he had actually called Qiao Nian to ask her about this.

Right now, he really regretted it. As for compensating Qiao Nian, he would think about it later.

Seeing that the Qiao family was unconvinced, Qiao Yu pursed his lips and said, “Based on your thoughts, the Qiao family will die faster. Do as you please!”

The blood drained from Qiao Shan’s face. Was the Qiao Corporation he had painstakingly built really going to disappear?

Su Xue and Qiao Xin didn’t look any better either.

“Dad, stay here and take care of Qiao Xin. Mom and I will go out to buy some things for Qiao Xin. After all, we have time today. There are many things to prepare,” Qiao Yu said.

At this moment, Qiao Shan’s mind was filled with thoughts of the Qiao Corporation. Hearing Qiao Yu’s words, he nodded in agreement.

Su Xue followed Qiao Yu out sadly, her mind in a mess.

When they walked into the elevator, Qiao Yu looked at the numbers on the elevator. He turned to look at the distracted Su Xue, his gaze sharp. “Mom, back then, was the cheque in Qiao Nian’s school bag really only a million yuan?”

Su Xue looked up abruptly and was caught off guard by Qiao Yu’s questioning gaze.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
