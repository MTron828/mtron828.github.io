Chapter 284: Trying Hard to Recover

Gao Lin glared fiercely at her classmates, then looked at Xia Xue in disbelief. She had never expected Xia Xue to play so poorly.

Did Xia Xue not want to play Missing?

She had misunderstood. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Xia Xue was in an abyss of suffering.

At that time, she didn’t want to play the violin, because she wasn’t good at it to begin with. No matter how well she played the violin, it was nothing compared to Qiao Nian’s.

However, Xia Xue had been forced to play the violin by Gao Lin. She was under a lot of pressure, and now, she heard her classmates pointing fingers at her. Her mind was in a mess.

Xia Xue tried hard to remain calm. She still wanted to play this song well.

Someone in the crowd said.

“Why do I think Qiao Nian is more suitable to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician?”

When Xia Xue heard this, her mind exploded. Her hand suddenly trembled, and the violin let out a piercing sound.

Xia Xue came back to her senses. She let go of the violin and it fell to the ground!

For a moment, the training room fell silent.

Xia Xue’s eyes instantly turned red. She bent down and picked up the violin. When she looked up, she saw the disappointment in her classmates’ eyes.

Xia Xue’s hands trembled slightly, and the violin in her hand fell to the ground again.

Xia Xue squatted down, tears welling up in her eyes. She picked up the violin again.

The room was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

Gao Lin looked at Xia Xue worriedly. She didn’t understand what was wrong with Xia Xue.

When Brother Cao, who was standing at the side, heard Xia Xue’s playing, his face was filled with displeasure.

Wang Xuan, who had been silent all this while, stepped forward. She looked at Xia Xue curiously and asked in confusion, “Senior Xia Xue, why aren’t you continuing? Have you already forgotten the score?”

Qiao Nian really wanted to give Wang Xuan a thumbs up. This question was simply too good.

Most of the people who came to this classroom today were die-hard fans of Mr. Dong Hua.

They were looking forward to Xia Xue’s flawless performance, but no one expected her to make such a low-level mistake.

They could not tolerate this. How could Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician forget her score? She was simply too incompetent!

“That’s right. Xia Xue is Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. If others can’t remember the score, it was fine but how can she forget? How can she make such a low-level mistake?”

“With her standards, if she were to attend Mr. Dong Hua’s concert, her reputation would be ruined!”

“We should go to Mr. Dong Hua’s Weibo and ask for a replacement!”

…

When Xia Xue heard those words, tears welled up in her eyes.

Brother Cao looked at Xia Xue’s pitiful appearance and frowned. He said, “Every concert Mr. Dong Hua performs is world-class, so all the requirements are perfect. Your standard…”

Although Brother Cao didn’t finish his sentence, everyone understood that Brother Cao wouldn’t allow Xia Xue to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician.

Lu Nian stood calmly at the side. He didn’t speak, but his gaze involuntarily fell on Qiao Nian.

Xia Xue naturally understood what Brother Cao meant. She was extremely flustered. She kept taking deep breaths, trying to remain calm, but she still couldn’t hide the fear in her heart.

Xia Xue glanced at Gao Lin, who was also standing rooted to the ground in shock. She didn’t know what to say, nor how to salvage the situation.

Xia Xue’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face again. Her eyes suddenly lit up. She had found an excuse. She looked at Brother Cao, who was standing at the side, and said gently, “Brother Cao, I’m really sorry. I was too nervous this time. With everyone looking at me with anticipation, I won’t make such a mistake again.”

Without waiting for Brother Cao to speak, Wang Xuan asked impatiently, “Senior Xia Xue, do you mean that our presence here has affected your performance?”
