916 Big Plan

At this moment, the ringtone of her phone interrupted her thoughts.

Qiao Nian looked at her phone not far away and walked over. Seeing that it was Lu Zhu, she picked up.

“Sugar!”

Lu Zhu’s voice was as gentle as ever.

!!

Qiao Nian felt a warmth in her heart. Thinking of Lu Zhu’s comforting words in the past, her lips curved up involuntarily. “Brother!”

“What are you doing now? Do you have time?”

“I just finished making the pills. I’m fine now.” Qiao Nian gripped her phone tightly. She guessed that Lu Zhu had already asked her mother for information. Pursing her lips, she asked, “Brother, have you asked Mom?”

“After you told me, I went to ask Mom. She said that you’ve never donated your bone marrow to anyone else!”

Lu Zhu’s answer confirmed Qiao Nian’s thoughts. Back then, those people must have kidnapped her to do a bone marrow transplant for Song Man.

If that was the case, it would be difficult to investigate this matter. After all, she didn’t have memories of that time.

“Then did Mom investigate the other tissues on the broken arm back then?” Qiao Nian asked solemnly.

“I investigated everything. It was precisely because all the results were your DNA that Mom was sure that you were killed!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, her frown deepened. Indeed, it was as she had guessed. The person who had kidnapped her back then was near her family.

“Looks like someone tampered with the sample when Mom was doing the DNA test!” Qiao Nian said thoughtfully.

“Yes.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually turned cold. She continued, “Looks like that person is by our parents’ side. Back then, when I was kidnapped, it wasn’t just a simple kidnapping. That person probably wanted my bone marrow transplanted into Song Man’s body.”

Lu Zhu sat in front of his desk. With a tired expression, he took off the gold-rimmed glasses on his nose and threw them on the table. His voice instantly turned cold. “I thought so too, so I investigated the patients who had bone marrow transplants in various hospitals, but I didn’t find anyone who matched Song Man’s DNA.”

Qiao Nian sighed slightly and said, “I haven’t found anything here either. I met Song Man’s grandmother, Wang Yue, today. Song Man seems to have been adopted! If I’m not wrong, Song Man’s illness is congenital. Her family might have been planning this since a long time ago.”

“You’re saying that Song Man was deliberately sent out. In that case, even if we find out that you were kidnapped and your bone marrow was donated to Song Man, we won’t be able to find any information about her biological parents.” Lu Zhu’s eyes instantly turned cold as he continued, “I think the other party had planned this long ago. Perhaps we won’t be able to find any clues. Do you think Song Man has interacted with those people?”

“Brother, Song Man should have been just a baby at that time. She shouldn’t have known about this either. After she was sent out, I guess she found out about her background later. However, I’m not sure how much she knew. She’s already dead and her corpse has been cremated. I still have her DNA information. Those people probably think that I don’t know about Song Man’s DNA and want to cremate her corpse as soon as possible. That way, they can hide everything from the past!”

“I have a bold guess. If she knows that you’re the mother of Gu Qi and Xiao Shi, it means that what happened that night five years ago has something to do with her.” Lu Zhu paused for a moment and continued, “Moreover, she used your bone marrow. Her blood is the same as yours, which means that it’s very likely that she knows that you’re the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”

Qiao Nian felt a chill run down her spine, and her eyes instantly turned cold. “From the beginning, she wanted to replace everything I had. She didn’t even want to have a child. She used me to give birth and wanted to become Madam Gu openly.”

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes. Those people wanted to erase her existence and let Song Man replace her.

Song Man was the greatest beneficiary.

Lu Zhu also realized all of this. He said with a serious expression, “Don’t worry, I’ll investigate the people around Mom. Sugar, you’re in danger now. Those people all know that you’re still alive. Now that Song Man is dead, they might blame you for her death. You have to be careful!”
