Jiang Yue raised her hand to wipe her tears. She sniffled and questioned, “I told you I wasn’t lying. You clearly hate the eldest daughter of the Lu family to the core. You were the one who did this!”

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue calmly. She felt that it wasn’t a big deal for her to know that Gu Zhou had been engaged to the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

She didn’t think of hiding it anymore. She nodded and said, “Grandma did tell me about this!”

Qiao Nian believed that Grandma would never tell Jiang Yue about this.

Jiang Yue had been chased out of the Gu family villa. Then where had Jiang Yue heard this news?

Could it be that one of the servants was Jiang Yue’s spy?

Or were all the servants on Jiang Yue’s side?

Although Qiao Nian didn’t know how Jiang Yue knew about the Gu family’s villa, she was certain that Jiang Yue had always been concerned about the Gu family.

Jiang Yue had been hiding in the dark, looking for an opportunity to return to the Gu family.

Song Yu, who was standing at the side, glanced at Qiao Nian and asked in confusion, “What does that mean?”

When Jiang Yue heard Song Yu’s words, she knew that Song Yu believed her. She hurriedly said, “Sister Song Yu, actually, everyone can be jealous. No matter how well Qiao Nian hides it, she will still be jealous of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. You have to know that the eldest daughter of the Lu family and Brother Ah Zhou were once engaged!”

At this point, Jiang Yue paused for a moment and continued, “For the past two years, Qiao Nian has been embroidering blessing bags for the eldest daughter of the Lu family. They’re too small. As long as she thinks of embroidering blessing bags for her love rival, she’ll definitely feel uncomfortable.”

After Jiang Yue’s words, Song Yu instantly realized that Qiao Nian liked Gu Zhou.

Song Yu’s gaze landed on Lu Nian’s face. Seeing that Lu Nian was staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, she frowned imperceptibly.

At that time, Jiang Yue had even said that Qiao Nian liked Lu Nian.

Just now, Song Yu had been paying attention to the interaction between Lu Nian and Qiao Nian.

For some reason, she felt that Qiao Nian didn’t seem to have any feelings for Second Brother. Instead, Second Brother had been staring at Qiao Nian.

Just now, Second Brother had also spoken up for Qiao Nian.

Song Yu’s frown deepened. Could it be that Second Brother had really fallen for Qiao Nian?

Her heart trembled slightly. Frantically, she looked away distraught.

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Yue’s words, she said in admiration, “Miss Jiang’s ability to make up stories is as amazing as ever. I wonder how true this story is?”

Wiping her tears, Jiang Yue’s thin body trembled slightly. She said carefully, “I’m not lying. I’m telling the truth.”

“In this world, evidence is everything. Then show me the evidence!” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue and said calmly.

“Evidence? Sister Qiao Nian, your medical skills are so brilliant. Even if you casually tampered with the blessing bag, you can’t be unaware.” Jiang Yue sniffled, her eyes red-rimmed. “How would I know what you did?”

Qiao Nian smiled and asked, “Since you know that my medical skills are brilliant and that I’m capable, I’ll definitely do whatever I want without anyone knowing, much less add sulfuric acid to the blessing bag. How could I have made such a low-level mistake?”

Jiang Yue was stunned by Qiao Nian’s words. She immediately said, “It’s dark under the lights. You added something to the blessing bag on purpose. That way, no one will suspect that you did it.”

“You’re right, but I won’t do such a thing.” Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly, her gaze landing on Jiang Yue’s bag.

The corrosiveness of sulfuric acid was very strong. This meant that when Grandma and Lu Qi took the blessing bag, it should not have been tampered with.

After that, she wasn’t sure.

In other words, the blessing bag had been tampered with in the Buddhist hall.

If that was the case, one of them would definitely still be carrying sulfuric acid, because none of them had left the Buddhist hall. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Even if that person didn’t have sulfuric acid with him, they should be able to find the sulfuric acid nearby.

However, she felt that that person probably wouldn’t throw away the sulfuric acid, because there were too many people nearby. It would be too obvious to lose something.

Qiao Nian knew what to do. She stared unblinkingly at the bag in Jiang Yue’s hand. Of everyone present, only Jiang Yue had brought her bag.
