1071 Bad Mouth

“Bam!”

The clear slap interrupted Xu Qiu!

A clear palm print suddenly appeared on Xu Qiu’s face!

Xu Qiu was stunned on the spot!

!!

She was dumbfounded by this slap!

She had never expected Qiao Nian, this little vixen, to dare to slap her face!

Xu Qiu had been the luckiest woman in their village since she was young. In the words of the people in their village, she had a round body and a big face. Even the heavens liked blessed people like her!

In the past, everyone in their village used to think that being fat was beautiful. Being fat meant that they were rich. That meant that they were lucky!

Back then, Xu Qiu was the fattest person in their village!

Xu Qiu thought that she was the most beautiful flower in their village!

No one had ever slapped her face before. She had really been slapped silly!

Xu Qiu covered her face, her eyes wide with anger. She yearned to kill Qiao Nian with her gaze!

She raised her hand, preparing to hit her back!

Then, before the slap could ring out, Xu Qiu’s wrist was grabbed!

Xu Qiu was slightly stunned. She turned to look at the person holding her hand. This man was really good-looking!

Just as Xu Qiu was infatuated, she felt a pain in her wrist. She couldn’t help but scream.

When the man let go of her hand, she hurriedly grabbed her right wrist and took two steps back in fear. She looked at the man in front of her with fear.

This man was very handsome. It was his cold eyes that made her shiver.

Just as Xu Qiu was about to say something, she saw the man move his wrist slightly. She took two steps back in fear!

Xu Qiu panted heavily, trying hard to ease the pain in his wrist!

Qiao Nian looked at the man in front of her. The coldness in her eyes gradually disappeared, leaving only joy. Her lips curved up.

“Shen Hao, you old fart. I’ve been bullied now. Why are you standing behind me like a piece of trash? What kind of man are you? Hurry up and help me hit him!” Xu Qiu howled.

Shen Hao was a country bumpkin. He usually worked in the fields and was full of strength!

But now, facing this man who was exuding a cold aura, Shen Hao instantly cowered.

Shen Hao swallowed. That man had only taken a glance, but he was already trembling in fear. He had never seen anyone with such a ruthless aura.

Xu Qiuyi pushed Shen Hao forward and scolded angrily, “You old fart. Hurry up and beat him up!”

“No, no, no…” Shen Hao almost bumped into the man in front of him. When he looked up, he met the man’s murderous gaze. He was so frightened that his legs trembled. He hurriedly took two steps back. He did not dare to fight this man!

Shen Hao bumped into Xu Qiu!

Xu Qiu did not expect Shen Hao to retreat. She staggered two steps back and lost her balance, falling to the ground!

She was already very fat. Now that she had fallen to the ground, she felt that her bones had shattered. It was so painful that she almost couldn’t breathe!

What angered Xu Qiu the most was that not only did Shen Hao not come over to comfort her and help her up, but he also ran behind her! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xu Qiu was so angry that she couldn’t breathe. She lay on the ground and cried loudly, “Someone, come and take a look. Someone is going to kill someone!”

Shen Hao was about to run back to the Qiao family villa when he heard Xu Qiu’s voice. He stopped in his tracks.

No matter what, Xu Qiu was his wife!

Suppressing his fear, he walked to Xu Qiu’s side and reached out to help her up!

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with sparkling fox-like eyes. Her red lips curved up slightly, and her voice became much gentler. “Didn’t you say that you were busy with the company? Why are you here?”

Gu Zhou’s expression was indifferent. He took out a tissue and wiped his hand, which had just touched Xu Qiu’s. He looked at Qiao Nian gently, and the coldness in his body instantly disappeared. “I’m afraid you’ll be bullied!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with smiles. She said softly, “I won’t!”

“You’re too soft-hearted!” As Gu Zhou spoke, he glared daggers at Xu Qiu.

Xu Qiu was helped up by Shen Hao. She cried out in pain, like a pig about to be killed!

In the Qiao family villa.

Su Xue had been preparing food for Qiao Shan and Qiao Xin in the kitchen. When she heard the commotion outside, she stopped what she was doing and walked out curiously.

Su Xue had just walked out of the villa when she saw Qiao Nian from afar. Hatred instantly welled up in her heart.
