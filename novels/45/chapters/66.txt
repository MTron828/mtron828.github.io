Chapter 67: Aggrieved

With that, Qiao Nian left. She didn’t want to waste any more time on Su Yan.

Su Yan stood there alone, looking dejected. As he thought about Qiao Nian’s words just now, his mind became more and more jumbled.

“Brother Su Yan.” Seeing that Su Yan was standing alone, Qiao Xin walked over. “Shouldn’t we leave as well?”

Su Yan heard Qiao Xin’s voice and turned to look at her. His eyes met Qiao Xin’s innocent face. Immediately, he recalled Qiao Nian’s words. He frowned and coughed. “Okay.”

Qiao Nian must be lying to him. Qiao Xin was clearly so innocent and lovable. How could she be someone like that?

Su Yan looked up at Qiao Xin and hesitated. “Did you know that your sister…”

Qiao Xin shook her head, looking troubled. “Brother Su Yan, Sister didn’t grow up in the Qiao family when she was young. She only came to the Qiao family after she began studying at university. She doesn’t go home often either, so…”

At this, Qiao Xin’s brow furrowed deeper and deeper. She sighed and continued, “Although I didn’t grow up with her, I’m still her blood-related sister, but she…”

As Qiao Xin spoke, she looked more and more aggrieved, and her eyes turned red. Her voice was choked with emotion.

Su Yan instantly understood. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian had never said anything.

Although Qiao Xin had said in front of him that Qiao Nian liked him, Qiao Xin must have heard some rumors from other students. That could be the only reason why Qiao Xin would say those things to him.

He used to think that he knew her very well, but even now, he still didn’t know what kind of person Qiao Nian was.

Su Yan’s gaze fell on Qiao Xin’s face. He had been together with Qiao Xin for years, and he knew her better than anyone else.

Qiao Xin must have mentioned Qiao Nian because Qiao Xin had always felt that being with him was betraying Qiao Nian.

Looking at the dejected Qiao Xin, Su Yan pulled her into his embrace and comforted her gently. “It’ll be fine.”

Qiao Xin was such a good person. All this time, Qiao Xin had never spoken ill of Qiao Nian in front of him.

“Did your sister really kill…”

Su Yan didn’t finish his sentence.

Qiao Xin looked flustered, as though she had just recalled something. She glanced around and said, “Brother Su Yan, let’s not bother ourselves with the past. Sister is the principal now, so don’t bring up the past.”

Su Yan glanced at Qiao Xin’s anxious expression and instantly understood.

There was a fine line between genius and insanity.

Perhaps Qiao Nian was an insane genius. She was smart and capable, but she wouldn’t be aware if she had done something wrong.

Su Yan glanced at the gentle and charming Qiao Xin in front of him, and lowered his gaze.

Qiao Xin was the best.

He should never have believed the words of a lunatic.

Su Yan pulled Qiao Xin into his embrace again, giving a gentle murmur of assent.

“Brother Su Yan, you’re the best.” Qiao Xin leaned into Su Yan’s embrace and heaved a sigh of relief.

She didn’t understand. How could Qiao Nian, that wild lass who had returned from the countryside, be better than her?

She had to knock Qiao Nian off her perch so that everyone would see Qiao Nian’s true colors.

Su Yan and Qiao Xin walked out side by side. Before long, they saw Wang An walking towards them.

Wang An walked up to Su Yan and said calmly, “Student Su Yan, the school has selected your PhD thesis to represent An University in a competition. Come with me, we will discuss your thesis.”

The gloom in Su Yan’s eyes vanished in an instant. He felt that he would be able to achieve glory for the school through his hard work.

“Congratulations, Brother Su Yan.” Qiao Xin looked at Su Yan happily, then at Wang An.. After some hesitation, she asked, “Principal, may I come with the two of you?”
