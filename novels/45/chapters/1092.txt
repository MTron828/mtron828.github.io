1093 Your Father Has Gone Crazy!

“Qiao Yu, your father has gone crazy! You have to…”

“Enough!” Qiao Yu closed his eyes and interrupted Su Xue angrily.

Qiao Yu was usually gentle and refined. Qiao Shan and Su Xue had never seen him angry.

Qiao Yu turned back to look at Su Xue, then at Qiao Shan. He pursed his lips slightly, his eyes filled with anger. “Are you done fooling around?”

!!

“Sister has just been arrested and sent to the police station. I wonder how she’s doing now. Dad, are you going to kill Mom and get the police to arrest you? When that happens, not only will there be an instigator of a crime in the Qiao family, but there will also be a murderer. The Qiao family won’t even need anyone to do anything. We’ll be over!” Suppressing his anger, Qiao Yu slowly lowered his gaze. “How long do you plan to continue causing trouble?”

Qiao Yu’s words exploded in Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s minds like a bomb.

The two of them were so preoccupied with each other that they had completely forgotten about the current situation of the Qiao family.

Qiao Shan glared fiercely at Su Xue. He was really unlucky. He had actually found a lewd woman who loved to cheat on him!

However, Qiao Yu was right. He should be thinking about how to survive the Qiao family’s crisis.

Qiao Shan took a deep breath. His gaze fell on Qiao Yu’s face and he said, “Qiao Yu, you’re right. What should we do now?”

At the thought of Qiao Xin, Su Xue felt both sad and heartbroken. So many things had happened to her most beloved daughter. Naturally, her heart ached for her daughter, but she had never expected her daughter to betray her!

Su Xue coughed twice before asking, “Qiao Yu, do you have a way to get your sister out of the police station?”

Qiao Shan, who was sitting in the wheelchair, had already ignored Su Xue. However, when he heard Su Xue’s voice, his anger surged. If not for the fact that he was still rational, he would have stepped forward and killed Su Xue long ago.

Qiao Shan pointed at the door and said angrily, “Get lost, b*tch. I’ve divorced you long ago. Don’t stay in my house shamelessly. You’re not allowed to step foot into the Qiao family again, or I’ll take one of your legs!”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Shan’s words, her face turned pale with fear. At the thought of how she had almost suffocated to death just now, she couldn’t help but shiver.

If Qiao Shan could say it, he would definitely do it.

In the past, whenever she shed a few tears, Qiao Shan’s heart would ache and he would change his words.

But she knew very well now that Qiao Shan would not soften just because she was crying.

Qiao Shan looked away from Su Xue’s face in disdain. He felt dirty just by looking at such a lewd woman!

If he had known, he would have listened to his mother back then and not married that b*tch Su Xue!

Qiao Yu looked at Su Xue, who was behind him. Su Xue was of no help now. Instead, she would anger Qiao Shan. He said in a low voice, “Mom, go back first!”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Yu’s voice, she looked at his face in shock. Her son’s intentions were obvious. Only Qiao Shan had the ability to save Qiao Xin.

Su Xue pursed her lips tightly. For the sake of her daughter, she could only leave for the time being.

After Su Xue left the study, the anger on Qiao Shan’s body gradually dissipated. He felt that his breathing was smoother. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qiao Shan looked up at Qiao Yu and asked expectantly, “Qiao Yu, have you thought of a way to get your sister out of prison?”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Shan’s words, he shook his head gently and said seriously, “Dad, I’m sorry. I couldn’t save her.”

When Qiao Shan thought of how pitiful Qiao Xin looked when she left, the light of hope in his eyes gradually dimmed. He sat in his wheelchair dispiritedly, his expression dejected. “Is your sister’s life ruined?”

When Qiao Shan thought of how pitiful Qiao Xin looked when she left, the light of hope in his eyes gradually dimmed. He sat in his wheelchair dispiritedly, his expression dejected. “Isn’t your sister’s life ruined?”

Qiao Shan’s eyelids drooped as he said weakly, “It’s all my fault. If I hadn’t… Sigh, I really didn’t expect her to suffer so much this time. I’m really useless. I couldn’t protect her well.”
