1190 Sadness

Gu Zhou sat down beside Qiao Nian. The sunlight shone on Qiao Nian’s face, accentuating her fair skin. Her entire face was as fair and soft as a peeled egg.

Thank you readers!

Her lips were like ripe cherries, making one want to kiss them.

With this thought in mind, he did so. He moved closer to Qiao Nian’s mouth and kissed her lightly.

Qiao Nian had been resting with her eyes closed. Sensing that she had been kissed, she looked up and met Gu Zhou’s eyes, which were as deep as the sea. Her mouth was a little dry as she licked her lips and asked, “What’s wrong?”

“Are you tired?”

“It was fine.”

“Why don’t we take a shower first?” As Gu Zhou spoke, he lifted a little of her hair and twirled his index finger. Her hair wrapped around his index finger like a ring.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s bewitching voice, Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. Before she could speak, Gu Zhou had already moved closer to her ear.

The breath he exhaled gushed into her earlobe. That hot, wet breath was like a feather tugging at her heartstrings.

The temperature in the room suddenly rose.

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly into Gu Zhou’s eyes. Swallowing, she said softly, “I’ll take a shower.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s slightly red earlobes, and the smile in his eyes grew more and more obvious. He moved closer to Qiao Nian and pressed his forehead against hers, saying softly, “Why don’t I help you?”

“Huh?”

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s mind went blank.

Before Qiao Nian could react, Gu Zhou had already picked her up in his arms.

In a panic, she wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck. Only then did she realize what Gu Zhou had meant.

“I’ll shower myself,” Qiao Nian said uncomfortably, her face red.

Gu Zhou was helping her take a shower?

Just thinking about it made her feel shy.

“I’ll help you,” Gu Zhou said.

After entering the bathroom, Qiao Nian was about to get off Gu Zhou when she sensed that his skin was a little hot. She frowned slightly and looked at Gu Zhou worriedly. “Are you feeling unwell? Do you have a fever?”

As she spoke, she placed the back of her hand on Gu Zhou’s forehead, wanting to test his temperature.

She tested the temperature of her forehead again and frowned. “You have a fever.”

“It’s fine.”

“How can you be fine?” Qiao Nian instantly became nervous. She hurriedly said, “Put me down. I’ll take your pulse and see what medicine you should take.”

Qiao Nian’s mind raced. She immediately said, “We’re meeting Mr. Chen tomorrow. He’s like a sly old fox. We have to be fully alert.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned unhappily. However, he still carefully placed Qiao Nian in the bathtub and asked, “Why are you so concerned about Mr. Chen?”

“I’m not concerned about him.” Qiao Nian sat in the bathtub and looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips slightly and said disapprovingly, “When you woke up that day, your mind was filled with him. Now, you’re still talking about him. Nian’er, you’ve ignored me for a long time.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s aggrieved expression and was slightly stunned. She blinked in confusion. “When did I ignore you?”

How was Gu Zhou ignored?

He even looked aggrieved?

Had she really neglected him recently?

“We’ll talk about this tomorrow. Let’s discuss what happened today,” Gu Zhou said domineeringly.

Qiao Nian couldn’t bring up Mr. Chen anymore. She looked at Gu Zhou worriedly and said, “But you have a fever now. I’m very worried about your health now. I’ll take your pulse…”

With that, Qiao Nian reached out to feel Gu Zhou’s pulse.

Gu Zhou pulled his hand out of Qiao Nian’s grip and looked at her with a burning gaze. “I’m just a little horny.”

Qiao Nian was stunned.

“I went to the Lu family with you. After you reunited with your parents-in-law, you’ve been busy with other things. I don’t have time alone with you anymore.” Gu Zhou looked straight into Qiao Nian’s eyes, his low voice carrying a trace of resentment. “You’ve thrown me to the back of your mind.”

Qiao Nian had indeed been busy with other things for the past two days. She didn’t dare to look at Gu Zhou and looked away. “Did I?”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
