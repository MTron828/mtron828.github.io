1375 Something Happened

She crawled into the driver’s seat and lowered the back of the chair.

If it weren’t for the fact that there were stones on both sides of the front door, they could have gotten out through the front door.

Fortunately, there were gaps on both sides of the door at the back of the car, so they could still open the door and leave.

Qin Chuan could move now. Suppressing the pain, he moved to the back seat bit by bit. He pushed open the door on the left and held onto it as he struggled to get out of the car.

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi in the front row and said in a low voice, “Qi Qi, come here.”

Lu Qi saw that Qin Chuan had already left. Just as she was about to climb into the back seat of the car, the roof seemed to be unable to withstand the pressure of the stone and fell a little.

Creak!

Lu Qi immediately shrank back and looked at the roof of the car in fear, hesitating to climb out.

Qin Chuan could tell that Lu Qi was hesitating. He coaxed softly, “Don’t worry, everything will be fine now. Come over.”

Lu Qi wanted to refuse, but when she saw Qin Chuan’s concerned gaze, she slowly climbed into the car seat and quietly crawled towards the back seat. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She had just taken two steps when the sound of something pressing against the roof of the car came again. Her heart jumped to her throat. She looked up and met Qin Chuan’s gentle eyes.

Qin Chuan reached out to Lu Qi.

Everything around her no longer seemed to matter. Lu Qi only had eyes for Qin Chuan.

She wanted to go to him.

Lu Qi quickly moved her body. When she reached the back seat of the car, she placed her hand on Qin Chuan’s with a smile.

His hand was so big that it seemed to be able to hold her entire hand.

His hand was very warm, like the winter sun, making one involuntarily want to get close to him and trust him.

Seeing Lu Qi come out, Qin Chuan’s lips curved up slightly. He held Lu Qi’s hand tightly. He wanted to praise Lu Qi, but when he saw her smile, he didn’t know what to say.

Lu Qi was still holding her cell phone in one hand. The cell phone was still emitting a weak light, which could only illuminate a little of the area around them.

Holding her phone in her left hand, Lu Qi looked around. Her surroundings seemed to be blocked by stones. Worry was written all over her face. “Senior Brother, the surroundings are blocked. We can’t leave at all.”

With that, Lu Qi was about to walk forward to see if there was another way out. She had just taken a step when she noticed that her right hand was holding Qin Chuan’s left hand.

Lu Qi’s face instantly turned red. Silently, she wanted to retract her hand, but Qin Chuan’s grip was too tight. For a moment, she couldn’t leave.

Qin Chuan noticed Lu Qi’s actions and saw that she was staring at their hands. He pursed his lips slightly and gently let go of her hand.

Lu Qi felt a little empty in her heart. She retracted her hand unnaturally and looked around. She asked seriously, “Senior Brother, are we close to the exit or the entrance?”

“The exit should be close.” Qin Chuan clutched his chest and said with difficulty.

Lu Qi watched as Qin Chuan clutched his chest. She knew that he was not feeling well, so she hurriedly helped him to the side to sit down. With a serious expression, she said, “Senior Brother, sit down and rest for a while. I’ll go somewhere else to see if there’s an exit.”

Qin Chuan sat on the stone, panting heavily. He looked up at Lu Qi and said, “Be careful.”

Lu Qi smiled and walked towards the exit with her phone.

…

“Cut! Song Yu filmed very well this time. The crying scene is very infectious. We’ll film here this afternoon. Everyone, rest!” Director Li smiled at Song Yu and took the lead in applauding.

The staff around them applauded as well.

There were still tears on Song Yu’s face. She lowered her head and took a tissue from her assistant to wipe her face. After wiping her face clean, she smiled and bent down to thank everyone.

Song Yu walked to Director Li’s side and discussed the contents of the afternoon shoot with him. Only then did she thank him and go to the dressing room to change her clothes. After that, she entered the huge van.

Filming was not a simple matter. Song Yu was a perfectionist. She hoped to film better scenes. She did not want to be a celebrity. She wanted to be a good actress.

The assistant handed the phone to Song Yu and said, “Sister Xiaoyu, there are more than ten WeChat messages on your phone. Someone even called you more than ten times.”

“Thank you.” After thanking her, Song Yu saw her assistant get out of the huge van and opened her cell phone WeChat.

Song Xue said, “Lu Qi is dying!”
