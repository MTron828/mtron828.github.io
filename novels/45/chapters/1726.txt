Chapter 1727 - 1727 Introduction

To Grandpa Qin, if the children could learn to take care of Nian Nian and dote on her, they would have grown up.

Gu Zhou stood not far away. Seeing Qiao Nian acting like a spoiled child in front of Grandpa Qin, the light in his eyes grew brighter and brighter, and his mood improved.

Indeed, back then, his brother wanted Old Master Qin to treat her illness.

However, at that time, everything happened so suddenly. His brother, Chang Feng, and Old Master Qin came to MY and hid their identities here.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was hugging her master tightly, Chang Feng reminded her gently, “Sit down and talk slowly.”

After all, they could have a good chat tonight. Their master was getting old, and standing was not good for his waist.

When Qiao Nian heard Chang Feng’s words, she came back to her senses. She hurriedly let go of Grandpa Qin and helped him towards the sofa. “Grandpa, let me tell you, I just realized that I’m not a child of the Qiao family. I even found my biological parents. I have four brothers, three children, and a husband.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face not far away. Then, she retracted her gaze and looked at Grandpa Qin. “There are many people who love me. I feel so happy now.”

Her eyes turned red again. She held Grandpa Qin’s hand tightly and said seriously, “I really hope you can return to An City so that I can introduce you to all of them.”

Qiao Nian only said that she was happy. As for those unhappy things, she didn’t want to say them, nor did she want her grandfather to worry about her.

Grandpa Qin looked at Qiao Nian gently and lovingly. He still remembered the first time he saw Qiao Nian. At that time, Qiao Nian was wearing thin clothes and squatting outside alone, washing clothes pitifully.

It was winter, and she was wearing so little. It was already impressive that she wasn’t sick from the cold.

He still remembered how that family had treated Qiao Nian like a vampire. They yearned to squeeze every bit of value out of Nian Nian.

He couldn’t stand it anymore, so he took Nian Nian under his wing.

Although Nian Nian wasn’t his biological granddaughter, in his heart, Nian Nian was no different from his biological granddaughter.

Previously, he was worried that Nian Nian was having a hard time. Now that he saw Nian Nian’s happy expression, he was relieved.

“I’m relieved that you’re doing well.” Grandpa Qin held Qiao Nian’s hand gently with a loving expression.

“Grandpa, how are you doing here?” Qiao Nian looked at Grandpa Qin worriedly. This was MY, not Country Z. Their life habits were worlds apart. Grandpa Qin might not be used to the lifestyle here.

Grandpa Qin smiled lovingly. He was not someone who pursued an extravagant life to begin with. He only hoped that the people he loved the most could live good lives.

Especially Nian Nian.

He was most the worried about Nian Nian. Nian Nian had been living a hard life since she was young. He just hoped that Nian Nian could live happily like a little princess.

Qiao Nian’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red again. She sniffled.

Gu Zhou watched as they reunited, then walked out.

He was about to open the door and leave when Chang Feng suddenly appeared in front of him.

A trace of surprise flashed across Gu Zhou’s face.

Chang Feng smiled and asked, “Where are you going?”

Gu Zhou said calmly, “I’ll leave this place for you to catch up.”

When Chang Feng heard Gu Zhou’s words, he could roughly guess that Gu Zhou wanted to leave this space for them to catch up. After all, Gu Zhou was considered an extra person here.

“Second Young Master, this is the first time you’ve seen Grandpa, right? According to etiquette, you should greet him first,” Chang Feng said with a smile.

Actually, it wasn’t that Gu Zhou didn’t want to greet him, but time was tight. He felt that the master and disciple definitely had a lot to say. It was a little redundant for him to be here.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Gu Zhou subconsciously looked at Old Master Qin not far away and saw him staring at him solemnly.

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Qiao Nian didn’t notice how sharp Grandpa Qin’s gaze was. Smiling, she walked up to Gu Zhou and said gently, “Ah Zhou, let me introduce you to my grandfather.”
