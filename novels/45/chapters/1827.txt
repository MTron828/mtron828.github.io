The smile on Qiao Nian’s face gradually disappeared. The atmosphere became heavy.

“Yes, he has always been alive. The Daddy Xiao Bao talks about is Brother Gu. All these years, he’s been secretly protecting the Gu family and the Lu family because Mark has always wanted to deal with us.”

Lu Zhu frowned as well, his eyes filled with admiration. “He was still young when he left. He already had such courage at that time. As expected of someone from the Gu family.”

As the three of them were talking, footsteps came from the door. Auntie Cao walked in with a dark expression. When she saw Qiao Nian, her eyes were filled with ruthlessness.

However, when they looked at her, Auntie Cao had already restrained the expression in her eyes. There was a gentle smile on her face as she greeted gently, “Eldest Young Master and Second Young Master, when did Eldest Miss come back? Have you eaten? Why don’t I prepare food for you?”

Auntie Cao saw that there were two young masters here. In order to hide her identity and for the future plan to go smoothly, she pretended to be very enthusiastic.

Qiao Nian could naturally tell that Auntie Cao was lying. She held the cup in her hand and slowly finished her water before placing the cup on the table. “There’s no need.’

Qiao Nian looked at Auntie Cao indifferently and asked tentatively, “It’s already so late. Why isn’t Auntie Cao resting?”

Auntie Cao noticed Qiao Nian’s scrutinizing gaze. At this moment, she did not feel guilty at all. She said very frankly, “l just went over to give Sixth Miss some calming soup. When she fell asleep, I wanted to come over and check if the kitchen appliances were all turned off.”

Hearing Auntie Cao’s words, Lu Zhu frowned and asked worriedly, “Is her insomnia better?”

A trace of comfort flashed across Auntie Cao’s eyes. Although Song Yu was not the real daughter of the Lu family, the Eldest Young Master was still very concerned about her. “Sixth Miss’s current condition is still a little bad. She still drank the soup and slept.”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Lu Zhu thought of Song Yu’s situation and said in a low voice, “It seems that I have to specially go to a hospital to find a relevant doctor and see if there’s a better way to treat Song Yu.”

Lu Zhu knew that Song Yu liked to film. If Song Yu was dependent on the medicine for a long time, it might hurt her body and affect her acting career.

Qiao Nian saw the worry in Lu Zhu’s eyes and suggested, “Brother, have you forgotten something important?”

Lu Zhu was puzzled.

“I’m a doctor too. Why don’t I treat my sister and prescribe her a few sets of medicine?” Qiao Nian said with a smile. She didn’t have much feelings for

Song Yu in the past, but what Song Yu had done last time made her feel that Song Yu was not bad and she was willing to help her.

Before Lu Zhu could speak, Lu Nian’s eyes instantly turned cold. He said, “You’ve just returned from Europe. Rest well for the next few days. Even without you, someone else will treat her!”

As Auntie Cao listened to Lu Nian’s words, her hatred for Qiao Nian increased.

Why did Lu Nian treat his two sisters differently? Song Yu had clearly stayed by Lu Nian’s side for longer.

Auntie Cao pursed her lips tightly and tried to suppress the dissatisfaction in her heart.

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian and sighed helplessly.

Qiao Nian knew that Lu Nian seemed to have a knot in his heart because of

Song Yu. At this moment, it was not appropriate for her to mention treating

Song Yu. “Thank you for your concern, Second Brother. It’s getting late. Let’s go back and rest.”

Lu Nian t s eyes were filled with a gentle smile. He reached out and patted Qiao

Nian t s head, as if he was treating a doting child. His eyes were filled with love. “Sugar, I’m your second brother. Aren’t you treating me like an outsider by saying ‘thank you’ to me? Also, why didn’t you go through the main door when you came home this time? We’re all family. We all hope you can come home early. You didn’t even tell us when you came back.”

Hearing Lu Nian mention this, Qiao Nian smiled in embarrassment and said,

“Actually, what happened tonight was an accident. We planned to let Eldest Senior Brother secretly meet Xiao Bao. I originally wanted to meet you after

Eldest Senior Brother left.”

Lu Nian stared at Qiao Nian intently, as if he wanted to engrave Qiao Nian’s appearance in his mind..
