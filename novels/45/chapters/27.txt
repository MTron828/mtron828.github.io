Chapter 28: Misunderstood

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian did not seem to have heard him speak. Her gaze was still slightly lowered as she toyed with the ring on her finger. Her nails were pink and glossy. The whole image made one feel warm, as if all the chaos had nothing to do with Qiao Nian.

Su Yan frowned when he saw that Qiao Nian was paying him no heed. He stepped forward and said, “Qiao Nian, I know that you’ve come out from a mental hospital. I advise you to quit Teacher Wang’s project as soon as possible. Otherwise, it won’t look good for you if your past is exposed!”

Everyone in the banquet hall gasped when they heard Su Yan’s words. Many of them were here for Dr. Wang’s project. Some of them wanted to join the project, some wanted to invest in the project, and others wanted to discuss other projects with Dr. Wang.

Su Yan’s words made it clear to everyone that Qiao Nian was a lunatic who had already been selected by Doctor Wang.

“So this person is actually from a mental hospital!”

“How can Dr. Wang work with such a person?”

“If Dr. Wang brings her into the project, I’m worried that my investments might go down the drain!”

…

Qiao Nian didn’t even bat an eyelid as she listened to the discussion taking place around her. Scornfully, she strutted over to Su Yan in her high heels and looked straight into his eyes. As if the matter was of little importance, she spoke. “Classmate Su, do you think I’m not fit to participate in Teacher Wang’s project?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Zhou Xue didn’t bother waiting for Su Yan to respond. Haughtily, he replied, “At least you know your place. I advise you to leave this project as soon as you can. If anything happens in the future, you won’t be able to bear the consequences!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian’s beautiful eyes narrowed slightly, her gaze lingering on Zhou Xue’s face as she spoke. “Haven’t you learnt your lesson by now? Do you still want another slap?”

“You were only in university for half a semester and you didn’t even get your diploma! What right do you have to join Dr. Wang’s project?” Su Yan glared at Qiao Nian coldly. The more he looked at her, the more disgusted he felt. He hoped that he would never see her again in his life.

Su Yan had just finished speaking when a sweet-looking girl with two symmetrical ponytails stepped forward. She glanced at Qiao Nian and sneered. “You must be Senior Qiao Nian. I’ve heard your name everywhere since I entered university. I heard that you slept with many men in your class, and you’re a sex addict. Aren’t you mentally ill as well? You didn’t even get your diploma. How are you qualified to participate in Teacher Wang’s project?”

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Wang Tian continued her interrogation. “Or did you use other unsavory means to secure a place? For example, your body?”

The people crowding around were looking at Qiao Nian differently now. It was impossible for a mentally ill patient to become a doctor.

Doctor Wang had been discussing the project with a friend in a corner of the room. When he heard the commotion, he walked over and asked, “What happened?”

Su Yan had always prided himself on being a humble gentleman. He hesitated to speak up.

But Zhou Xue was different. Zhou Xue hated Qiao Nian’s guts for sending her to the police station, so she immediately stood up and explained the situation. “Teacher Wang, Qiao Nian has only attended one semester of classes. She was locked up in the mental hospital after that, and she was just released a short while back. You can’t let someone like this participate in your project!”

When Wang Tian heard Zhou Xue’s words, she immediately nodded in agreement. “Grandfather, you must not let a mentally ill person join our projects. If anything goes wrong with this project, then everyone else’s efforts will be wasted!”

As Wang Tian spoke, she gave Qiao Nian a vicious glare.

“Yes, Teacher Wang. Qiao Nian is still mentally ill. She has never even studied medicine before, not properly. You can’t let her participate in your project. If she makes a mistake, it will bring harm to your entire team!” Zhou Xue quickly added.

In the past, Dr. Wang had only heard from Teacher Liu that Qiao Nian was talented in the field of medicine. He didn’t know Qiao Nian very well either. After listening to what everyone around him had to say, he frowned and asked, “Qiao Nian, is all this true?”

“Actually, I already have a P—”

“Sister.” Qiao Xin cut in, looking at Qiao Nian with teary eyes. She sniffled and said in a shaking voice, “Let’s go home. Do stop fooling around!”

Although Qiao Xin didn’t say explicitly that Qiao Nian was mentally ill, every word she spoke made it clear to everyone present that Qiao Nian had a mental illness!

Qiao Nian turned to look at Qiao Xin and frowned slightly. Just as she was about to explain the situation to Dr. Wang, she heard Dr. Wang say coldly, “Qiao Nian, don’t follow me around anymore!”

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened slightly as she explained, “Teacher Wang, I’ve already graduated with a PhD!”

When Zhou Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, the corner of her lips curved up slightly. She laughed scornfully and said, “Qiao Nian, you’d better go back to the mental hospital and recuperate properly, lest you come out and embarrass yourself!”
