Chapter 272: Debut

It was clearly because Xia Xue was afraid of letting the cat out of the bag that she had hidden herself away to practice in secret. That wasn’t called being humble or keeping a low profile. It was called having a guilty conscience.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t seen Mr. Dong Hua at noon today, nor played the violin in front of him, the school would have agreed with Xia Xue’s suggestion to close practice room 23. Then, Qiao Nian would probably never know that someone had stepped on her to reach the peak of her life!

At this moment, many students rushed over. They were all here for Xia Xue.

Qiao Nian looked through the gap in the door and saw those people walking over. Her lips curved up slightly. The time had come.

It wasn’t easy for those students to find Xia Xue. One by one, they hurriedly asked all the questions they wanted to ask.

“Senior Xia Xue, we’ve finally found you. How did you get in touch with Mr. Dong Hua?”

“Senior Xia Xue, you must have met Mr. Dong Hua, right? How old does he look? What’s his personality like?”

“Senior Xia Xue, Mr. Dong Hua has taken a liking to the song you played. What did he think of you?”

“Senior Xia Xue, since you’re already Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician, can you tell Mr. Dong Hua to let our school attend the concert?”

…

Xia Xue was surrounded by those people. She was also confused by their questions.

In the past, she had been very well-known in school and had received a lot of attention, but she had never been the center of attention like she was now.

Xia Xue glanced at the classmates surrounding her. She felt as if she was the center of attention. Their eyes were filled with anticipation.

At this moment, Xia Xue’s heart, which had been calm for a long time, suddenly rippled.

Was this what it was like to be doted on by fans?

Xia Xue enjoyed being flattered.

Xia Xue’s heart was beating wildly. She swore to herself that she would definitely become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. Her name would be recorded in history.

Gao Lin, who was standing beside Xia Xue, looked at her classmates in shock. She knew that Brother Cao’s Weibo post would definitely excite everyone, but she didn’t expect it to be so effective.

Gao Lin looked up and saw a sea of people. There were also many people lining up, all wanting to see the female musician Mr. Dong Hua had personally selected.

Gao Lin couldn’t help but sigh. Sister Xia Xue had reached the peak of her career.

Gao Lin quickly came back to her senses. She hurriedly shielded Xia Xue behind her and said loudly to the students, “Seniors, juniors, don’t get too excited. Sister Xia Xue is from our school. It’s our school’s honor that Mr. Dong Hua personally selected her as his female musician. Sister Xia Xue will also benefit our school. However, Mr. Dong Hua has always kept a low profile. He doesn’t like anyone disturbing his life, so he hasn’t made his identity public. It’s not convenient for us to reveal any information about him here. Please forgive us.”

When the students heard Gao Lin’s words, they became even more curious and hurriedly asked.

“Senior Xia Xue, don’t worry. We won’t leak anything you say. We just want to know what kind of person Mr. Dong Hua is!”

“Senior Xia Xue, you’re so beautiful and kind. Just tell us!”

“Senior Xia Xue, Mr. Dong Hua is also our idol. Can you tell us a little about our idol?”

…

When Gao Lin heard her classmates’ words, she immediately smiled and said, “When Mr. Dong Hua wants to make his identity public, he will naturally make his appearance. Everyone, don’t be anxious!”

Xia Xue, who was standing at the side, finally came back to her senses. She nodded slightly, agreeing with Gao Lin’s words. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Actually, it wasn’t that she didn’t want to disclose information about Mr. Dong Hua. It was just that she had never seen Mr. Dong Hua in person. She couldn’t possibly spout nonsense!

“Senior Xia Xue, then you must have made an appointment with Mr. Dong Hua to practice the music at the concert, right? Where do you usually practice? In school?”

“Senior Xia Xue, what instrument are you going to use?”

“Senior Xia Xue, what song are you practicing this time?”

…

The students outside chased after him relentlessly.

Qiao Nian stood in the room, picked up the violin, and began to play.
