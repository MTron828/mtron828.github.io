1000 Uncle, you’re the best!

“Uncle, you’re the best. You’re actually willing to give birth to a younger brother or sister for me!” As Xiao Shi spoke, she ran to Lu Jiang happily. She looked up and asked innocently, “Strange, why isn’t Uncle’s stomach big? Are all babies so small?”

Lu Jiang looked at Xiao Shi in confusion. What did this have to do with his big stomach?

Lu Qi did not understand what Xiao Shi was talking about either. She walked up to Xiao Shi and squatted down, asking gently, “Xiao Shi, why did you ask why Uncle’s stomach isn’t big?”

Xiao Shi didn’t understand, so she blinked. She didn’t understand such simple logic. Why didn’t Aunt understand either?

!!

“In the past, I heard that only people with big stomachs can give birth. Then, Uncle said that he wanted to give birth. Why isn’t Uncle’s stomach big?” Xiao Shi was puzzled.

At this moment, Lu Jiang finally understood how naive children were. He tried hard to remain calm. He was someone who had seen the world.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s silence was golden.

Lu Qi squatted in front of Xiao Shi. Seeing Xiao Shi say something unbelievable with a serious expression, she couldn’t help but laugh. However, she was afraid of hurting Fourth Brother’s dignity, so she could only cover her mouth and suppress her laughter.

If someone else had said this to Fourth Brother, they would probably have been beaten black and blue.

Qiao Nian smiled helplessly and explained, “Xiao Cheng, that’s not what happened. Men and women have different physiological structures. About giving birth…”

Lu Jiang waved his hand, indicating for Qiao Nian to stop explaining!

Anyway, Xiao Shi was in front of him now, so he could hug her as he pleased.

Lu Jiang bent down and picked Xiao Shi up. He smiled and said, “My stomach will only grow bigger when the baby is about to be born!”

Lu Qi had been holding back her laughter. Now that she heard Lu Jiang’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “This is really too funny. Fourth Brother, to think that you would have such a day! If you don’t give me hush money, I’ll definitely spread this matter…” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lu Jiang rolled her eyes at Lu Qi and sat on the sofa with Xiao Shi in her arms. He said lightly, “You’re no longer as adorable as you were when you were young!”

“I have to tell Third Brother about this. Third Brother will definitely laugh at you!” Lu Qi snorted and sat down on the sofa.

“Whatever.” When Lu Jiang said this, his phoenix-like eyes raised slightly in a lazy manner. “I think if Third Brother knew about this, he would definitely be envious to death. After all, I got to hug my niece before him!”

Lu Qi was instantly speechless. She actually felt that Lu Jiang was right.

“You’re right. Why don’t we do this? Fourth Brother, how do you plan to bribe me? When the time comes, I’ll tell Third Brother more about how you look when you hug your niece.” Lu Qi thought that no matter what the outcome was, she would definitely make a profit. Moreover, there was still a show to watch.

“I don’t have anything to bribe you with anymore. I’ll start preparing the dowry for Xiao Shi!” Lu Jiang said solemnly. Then, he seemed to have thought of something and looked at Lu Qi. “Speaking of which, it’s strange. How did you become so stingy?”

Lu Qi felt that she was no longer the sister her brothers doted on the most.

However, this was fine. She had wanted to ask her brothers for more money to prepare Xiao Shi’s dowry.

Of course, Lu Qi would not say these words.

She pouted and said unhappily, “I really didn’t expect Fourth Brother to become so stingy now!”

Then, Lu Qi looked at Xiao Shi happily and said softly, “Xiao Shi, come and hug me!”

Xiao Shi was about to get off Lu Jiang when Lu Jiang hugged her even tighter.

Before she could speak, she heard Lu Jiang say, “Let me tell you, Xiao Shi likes me the most now. Go away!”

“Fourth Brother, you’ve been hugging Xiao Shi for a long time. Just let me hug her for a while!”

“We’ll talk about it later!” As Lu Jiang spoke, his gaze fell on Xiao Shi’s face. As expected of his sister’s child. She was so cute. She would probably be as good-looking as his sister in the future.
