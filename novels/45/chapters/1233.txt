1234 Stupid

It was Mommy!

He recognized Mommy!

His father had given him photos of his mommy before. At that time, he had always hidden his mommy’s photo under his pillow. Every day, when he woke up and slept, he would fantasize that his mommy was by his side and say good morning and good night to his imaginary mommy.

He had always hoped to see his mommy as soon as possible. He did not expect to see her this time.

Although he could only see his mommy’s side profile, she looked really beautiful, like an angel.

Xiao Bao wanted to take a few more glances at his mommy, but the car beside him moved, and so did their car. Xiao Bao said eagerly, “Uncle Zhao, hurry up and follow the car beside us. Don’t let them discover us.”

“Okay.” Butler Zhao didn’t think too much about it and drove after the car.

Qiao Nian glanced impatiently at the watch on her wrist. The car had been driving for almost an hour.

Although she didn’t know the way, she estimated the itinerary and felt that she could arrive in half an hour. In the end, it was almost an hour.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze and frowned slightly. She looked at the man driving and asked, “How much longer?”

“Miss Qiao, we’ll be there soon. There’s still ten minutes.”

Qiao Nian frowned. The last time she went to save her brother, it had taken her an hour to drive from the MY Hotel to the Ghost City. This time, the coffee shop was between the hotel and the Ghost City. Logically speaking, she should have arrived in half an hour.

Even if there was a traffic jam, forty minutes should be fine!

Qiao Nian had a bad feeling about this, but she still put on a calm expression and asked casually, “Why did Mr. Jiang invite me over this time?”

The chauffeur smiled and said politely, “Mr. Jiang knows that Miss Qiao is the queen of stone gambling. He invited you this time to consult you about stone gambling.”

The chauffeur spoke very gently and his tone was calm. He did not look like he was lying at all.

Qiao Nian’s heart instantly sank. If she didn’t know that Jiang Chi was going to investigate Jiang Cheng, she would have believed the chauffeur’s nonsense.

This chauffeur was definitely not Jiang Chi’s subordinate. Even if Jiang Chi’s subordinate came to look for her, he would definitely say something about Jiang Cheng.

Stone gambling.

Heh!

Qiao Nian glanced at the speed of the car. The speed of the car was now at 80 km/h. If she jumped out of the car, she would probably lose her life. Now, she could only pretend not to know anything. She wanted to see where that man was taking her.

She really didn’t know which blind person had bumped into her. She didn’t have a good temper and she would resolve this potential danger when the time comes. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian completely calmed down. She leaned back in her seat and said lazily, “I’ll sleep for a while. Call me when we arrive.”

“Yes.”

After the man finished speaking, he saw in the rearview mirror that Qiao Nian had already closed her eyes to sleep. He heaved a sigh of relief and raised his hand to wipe the cold sweat off his head.

This woman was so stupid. She didn’t even realize that he wasn’t driving to the Ghost City.

When he came, Miss Jiang reminded him repeatedly to be careful. She even said that Qiao Nian was smart.

Now, it seemed that Qiao Nian was an idiot.

When they arrived at their destination, the man parked the car and turned to look at Qiao Nian, pretending to be respectful. “Miss Qiao?”

Qiao Nian opened her eyes, her expression as calm as ever. After getting out of the car, she glanced around.

This wasn’t Ghost City.

It looked more like a suburb. There were many villas around.

The man quickly walked over to Qiao Nian and said respectfully, “Miss Qiao, please follow me.”

Qiao Nian glanced at her cell phone casually. She was still in contact with Gu Zhou.

She knew in her heart that the person who had tricked her here would definitely install something to block the signal around the villa. She casually took a photo and sent it to Gu Zhou before stopping the location sharing.

She followed the man into the villa.

This villa was quite big. After she followed the man into the living room, the man immediately locked the door. Then, he looked at Qiao Nian cunningly, his lips filled with a smug smile. There was no trace of respect at all.

“You…” The man had just said a word when he saw that Qiao Nian was still calm. His eyes were filled with confusion.
