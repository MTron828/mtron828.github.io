1453 Beauty

When Wright met Gu Zhou’s snake-like cold eyes, his mind went blank for a moment, but he quickly reacted.

This was Europe, not Country Z. So what if it was Gu Zhou? He was not afraid.

Wright mustered his courage and stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. With a calm expression, he questioned, “Mr. Gu, Lina is my cousin. My own cousin is injured. Is there a problem with me sending her to the hospital? Why are you interfering in our family matters?”

Wright stood up straight. He was the son of the Earl, so he naturally had a noble status. Someone like Gu Zhou should kneel and worship him.

Wright was about to see Gu Zhou’s admiration of him, but Gu Zhou was still expressionless, as if he was not moved at all by his identity.

Qiao Nian looked at Wright’s smug expression, as if she was looking at a clown. She pursed her lips slightly and said indifferently, “As long as she’s unwilling to leave with you, don’t even think about taking her away!”

Qiao Nian’s voice was clear and a little cold.

Wright looked over. When he saw Qiao Nian’s face, he gasped.

Just now, Qiao Nian’s face was covered in blood. Wright hadn’t seen Qiao Nian’s face clearly at all. Now that he saw Qiao Nian’s charming and perfect face, his eyes were filled with amazement.

Oh my god, there was actually such a beautiful woman in this world?

Previously, Wright had listened to his father and pursued Lina. Actually, he liked Lina a lot himself.

Lina had a mix of European blood and Oriental blood. She looked gentle and charming, completely different from other European women. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, the woman in front of him was different. She was like a gentle guest. Her beautiful fox-like eyes were a little charming, as if they were soul-stirring.

How great would it be to have such a beauty?

With this thought in mind, Wright couldn’t help but take a few more glances at Qiao Nian. His mind began to think about those messy things.

However, in the next moment, Wright seemed to feel a cold gaze on him. It was as if a sharp blade had instantly pierced through his chest and his heart.

Wright was so frightened that his forehead was covered in cold sweat. He followed her gaze and saw Gu Zhou, who was standing beside the woman, looking at him.

A man had to be manly in front of the person he liked.

With this thought in mind, Wright clenched his fists tightly. He looked at Qiao Nian sinisterly, trying hard to control his trembling legs. He deliberately said viciously, “If you want to interfere, you have to consider your own abilities. If you don’t hand Lina over to me, you won’t have a good life in Europe in the future!”

Gu Zhou couldn’t even be bothered to look at Wright. He left with his men, as if Wright’s ruthless words were just a fart that no one would notice.

After those people left, only Wright and his bodyguards were left. He was so angry that he kicked the bodyguards standing beside him. He looked at the bodyguards coldly and said angrily, “All of you are idiots. You’re useless at critical moments!”

The bodyguards lowered their heads in silence.

Wright walked towards his car with the bodyguards. When the chauffeur drove away, he got into the car with a dark expression.

The chauffeur got into the car and twisted the car key. Only then did he frown. He glanced at Wright in the rearview mirror and said fearfully, “Prince, um, our tires seem to be pierced!”

“What?” Wright frowned.

“The tires have been deflated, and the fuel in the car seems to have been drained!” the chauffeur said weakly.

Wright felt terrible. Gu Zhou would really take drastic measures.

Exasperated, he got out of the car and was about to get into the other cars when he was told that the tires of the other cars were broken too. There was no more gas.

“Gu Zhou!” Wright shouted through gritted teeth. He yearned to tear Gu Zhou into pieces.

At that moment, Wright’s phone rang. He took it out and looked at the caller ID. His expression darkened. “Hello!”

“Prince, I saw Gu Zhou’s car. Are we still chasing after them?”
