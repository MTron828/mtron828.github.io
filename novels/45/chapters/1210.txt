Qiao Nian had seen photos of Gu Yue in the past, but Mr. Chen didn’t look like Gu Yue.

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Gu Zhou continued, “Just now, Jiang Chi also said that Mr. Chen’s gaze was very similar to Big Brother’s.”

Human sixth sense was very accurate. Qiao Nian thought of what Gu Zhou and Jiang Chi had said, and how Jiang Cheng had taken a photo comfortably beside Mr. Chen. She said thoughtfully, “You’re right.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked even more excited.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was about to chase after him, Qiao Nian grabbed his hand and comforted him softly. “Don’t go. If Mr. Chen is really Big Brother and he didn’t acknowledge us just now, it means that the time isn’t right. Let’s not go.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he calmed down. He nodded, took out his phone, and called Chen Qing.

The call went through quickly.

“Second Young Master, what can I do for you?”

Gu Zhou frowned and said solemnly, “I want detailed information on Mr. Chen. The sooner, the better.”

“Alright, Second Young Master.”

After Gu Zhou hung up, he looked at the road not far away. He felt empty and especially uncomfortable.

He was also afraid that the information he would find would disappoint him.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang. Without thinking, she turned on her phone.

“Mr. K, someone wants to investigate Mr. Chen of HH Corporation.”

Gu Zhou inadvertently saw the contents of Qiao Nian’s cell phone. His dark eyes flashed, and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Qiao Nian was about to reply when she sensed Gu Zhou’s burning gaze on her. She immediately locked her phone screen and placed it in her pocket. She looked at Gu Zhou guiltily.

For the first time, Qiao Nian, who had always been good at communication, didn’t know what to say. She touched her nose.

Gu Zhou had been a little sad because of Gu Yue. Now that he saw Qiao Nian, he had mixed feelings.

After a while, Gu Zhou asked in a low voice, “Mrs. Gu, have you spent the billion yuan I gave you last time?”

Qiao Nian felt even more awkward. She lowered her head. “This…”

Back then, when she had just married into the Gu family, Gu Zhou had sent someone to investigate her. She had casually asked for a billion yuan, but she did not expect the other party to really give it to her. Hence, she had casually sent some information.

Later on, the two of them became closer and closer. She often contacted Chen Qing and even helped Gu Zhou investigate a lot of information.

At this moment, a voice came from above. “Huh?”

Qiao Nian sighed helplessly. It seemed that if she didn’t say a few words about this matter, Gu Zhou would get to the bottom of it. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

A sweet smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She looked up at Gu Zhou, but there was still a hint of guilt in her eyes. She said softly, “I-I haven’t finished spending it. Second Young Master is so generous. Of course I can’t spend all that money.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, a trace of surprise flashing in his eyes. This was the first time he had seen a lackey like Qiao Nian. His mood improved, and he couldn’t help but smile. He asked, “Mr. K, how much do you need to investigate this time? Your husband can afford it.”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

She looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. He wasn’t angry?

She had even lied to him previously.

Gu Zhou was actually willing to give her money?

As Qiao Nian was thinking, she heard Gu Zhou’s voice.

“How much is suitable?”

His voice was low and hoarse, with a hint of temptation.

The heat from his mouth gushed into her ear, making it itch.

Qiao Nian gave a playful smile and shrank back. She blinked and said jokingly, “Second Young Master, do you think a billion yuan is okay?”

Gu Zhou picked Qiao Nian up in his arms and whispered in her ear, “Do you think I’m worth a billion yuan?”

Qiao Nian subconsciously said, “You’re worth more than a billion yuan.”

“Yes, thank you for your appreciation. I’ll work harder today!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned, not understanding what Gu Zhou meant.

Gu Zhou lowered his head and whispered into Qiao Nian’s ear, “Excuse me, what position do you want to be in today?”

Qiao Nian was shocked.

Her face instantly turned red.
