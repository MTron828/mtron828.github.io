Chapter 694: Strange

As she spoke, Qiao Nian turned around and walked into the villa.

She had just taken a step when her wrist was grabbed.

She turned around and looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “What’s wrong?”

“I’ve already asked Chen Qing to bring the blessing bag to the car.”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief, a bright smile appearing on her face. She pulled her arm out of Gu Zhou’s grip and walked out with him.

Gu Zhou looked at his empty palm and felt an inexplicable sense of loss.

When the two of them walked to the entrance of the villa, Chen Qing had already prepared the car.

Chen Qing handed an exquisite wooden box to Qiao Nian and smiled. “Madam, this is your blessing bag.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Her gaze was attracted to the wooden box. She carefully took it from Chen Qing.

This wooden box was made of rosewood. There was a phoenix engraved on it, and emerald green jade beads were inlaid around the box.

Qiao Nian carefully touched the phoenix on it. This box must be expensive.

She had never expected Gu Zhou to be so meticulous as to prepare such a good box for her to store the blessing bag.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said in admiration, “I was still thinking about which box to use to store the blessing bag. I chose three or four boxes, but I wasn’t satisfied. Only the box you prepared for me is good!”

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, which was filled with a happy and bright smile.

That showed that Qiao Nian was telling the truth. She really liked this box.

Gu Zhou couldn’t help but frown. He narrowed his eyes slightly, his gaze even deeper. His thin lips pursed into a pale line.

Chen Qing, who was standing at the side, looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. He wondered if Madam would still be smiling so happily if she knew about the relationship between the eldest daughter of the Lu family and Second Master.

He was just an outsider. He shouldn’t say anything else.

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. In the end, he asked, “Do you no longer remember what I told you last night?”

Qiao Nian blinked, her beautiful fox-like eyes sparkling. She said innocently, “I remember.”

Gu Zhou’s Adam’s apple bobbed. His voice became even colder. “Sure.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion, not knowing why Gu Zhou was unhappy.

“What’s wrong? Did I say something wrong?”

“No.”

As Gu Zhou spoke, he opened the car door and got in.

Puzzled, Qiao Nian watched as Gu Zhou got into the car from the other side. She sat in the back seat and smiled. “Thank you for helping me prepare such a beautiful box!”

She didn’t understand how this man could be so petty. She had just forgotten to thank him, and he was already angry.

For some reason, she felt that Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Seeing Chen Qing get into the car, Gu Zhou said coldly, “Are you waiting for me to drive you?”

Chen Qing immediately straightened his back, stiffly buckled his seatbelt, and hurriedly started the car.

He hadn’t done anything. Why was Second Young Master angry again?

Second Young Master was still in a good mood this morning. Why had his mood suddenly changed?

The man’s mood changed like the weather in June.

He drove silently, not daring to say another word.

At the Lu residence.

At this moment, Matriarch Lu was sitting on the sofa in the living room with a miserable expression. Her eyes were dim as she looked at the busy servants, but her mind was filled with thoughts of her eldest granddaughter.

At this moment, Lu Qi was standing at the side with a serious expression instructing the servants.

The Lu family was shrouded in deep sorrow, except for the two people in Lu Zhu’s study.

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian were especially happy today because their sister would be coming over today.

At the thought of their sister, the two of them couldn’t help but smile.

Lu Nian smiled but could no longer smile. He walked to Lu Zhu’s side and asked in a low voice, “Brother, are we really not going to tell Grandma? If Grandma finds out that our sister is still alive and we’re still hiding this, she’ll definitely be angry. She might even use the family law!”

“It’s just breaking a leg. It’s not a big deal. When the time comes, the two of us will stay in the hospital together and take care of each other in the ward, right?” Lu Zhu said casually, looking indifferent.
