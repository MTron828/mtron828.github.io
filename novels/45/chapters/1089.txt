1090 Framed!

A clear palm print instantly appeared on Su Xue’s face!

She knew that it was inconvenient for Qiao Shan to move around. She hurriedly crawled back a few steps and explained in a panic, “Qiao Nian wants our Qiao family to fall apart. If you believe Qiao Nian’s nonsense now, you’ll fall into her trap!”

Su Xue covered her swollen face and looked at Qiao Shan with red-rimmed eyes.

Qiao Shan looked like he wanted to kill Su Xue. He looked at Su Xue sinisterly, not saying a word.

Su Xue was frightened by Qiao Shan’s gaze. She pretended to shed a tear and said tearfully, “Qiao Nian has always hated us for throwing her into the mountains. Now, she can’t wait for our family to die. Hubby, you shouldn’t believe her. Nine out of ten of her words are fake!”

“Are you saying that Qiao Nian wants to frame you?” Suppressing his anger, Qiao Shan raised his eyebrows slightly and questioned!

“Of course. I could tell long ago that Qiao Nian, that little b*tch, wasn’t a good person. That’s why I sent her to the countryside back then. Now, it seems that I was right!” Seeing that Qiao Shan had taken her words to heart, Su Xue continued to lie to him!

She had long cursed Qiao Nian’s ancestors in her heart!

“Do you really think Qiao Nian was the one who said all of this? Do you think Qiao Nian was the one who told you about the embezzlement twenty years ago?” Qiao Shan looked at Su Xue with hatred written all over his face. It was as if this was the first time he had seen Su Xue, and also the first time he had met the person closest to him.

He had been with Su Xue for about thirty years. All these years, Su Xue had hidden it too well. He had not discovered Su Xue’s true nature at all!

If he had known that Su Xue was such a licentious woman, would he have married her?

“Previously, I had embezzled public funds. At that time, I lent the money to my brother. My brother still needed more than a million yuan to buy a house. Many people were fighting over that house, so I lent the money to him for emergencies!” Su Xue thought to herself. She would call her brother later and tell him about this. He would definitely be willing to help her perjure herself. As long as Qiao Shan was no longer angry, everything would be fine in the future!

“Is that so?” Qiao Shan still didn’t believe Su Xue!

Su Xue was so anxious that tears were about to fall. She nodded vigorously and said solemnly, “Of course. Later on, when Brother returned the money to me, I returned it to the company.”

“Why didn’t I realize before that you were so good at lying? Can I still believe anything you say?”

“Hubby, believe me. I’m really not lying!”

“After you adopted Qiao Nian, the company’s accounts were filled up. Didn’t Qiao Nian’s appearance make up for that sum of money?” As Qiao Shan spoke, he pushed his wheelchair in front of Su Xue and looked down at her. He could see the fear and unease in Su Xue’s eyes!

Without waiting for Su Xue to speak, Qiao Shan continued, “I forgot to tell you. Qiao Nian didn’t tell me about this!”

Su Xue was stunned on the spot. If Qiao Nian didn’t say it, who did?

Qiao Shan threw the letter Qiao Xin had written him at Su Xue’s face and said mockingly, “Is this how you usually take care of your children? You even want to meet your lovers when you’re taking care of your children!”

What?

It was as if she had been struck by lightning. She sat rooted to the ground in a daze!

Did Qiao Xin say that?

Trembling, she picked up the letter from the ground. When she saw the contents, her entire body turned cold, as if she was in a cold cellar.

Su Xue had never expected Qiao Xin to be the one to expose her!

Qiao Xin had indeed written this letter. She had raised Qiao Xin, and she remembered Qiao Xin’s handwriting clearly!

Qiao Xin’s every word was like a silver needle, stabbing viciously into his heart. Her heart was riddled with holes, and she was in so much pain that she wanted to die, but she couldn’t die immediately!

Qiao Xin was torturing her, taking revenge on her, and making her suffer alive! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qiao Shan looked at Su Xue coldly and said, “Back then, you couldn’t wait to send Qiao Nian to the countryside. Wasn’t it because you took a lot of money from Qiao Nian, but you didn’t want her to say it?”
