1673 Apologizing
Although Second Young Master’s other personalities had yet to appear, he felt uneasy.

Chen Qing pursed his lips and said seriously, “Today is the engagement ceremony of the European royal family. Logically speaking, I should be careful on such a grand occasion. I can’t make any mistakes, or it will bring danger to you and Second Young Madam.”

Chen Qing paused for a moment and continued, “But just now…”

Thinking of the situation back then, Chen Qing frowned and clenched his fists. His throat felt as if it was being strangled by a hand, and he could barely breathe.

“I-I just saw Wright forcefully kiss the Seventh Princess. My mind was in a mess. When I reacted, I had already taken action.” Chen Qing was telling the truth. He really didn’t expect himself to do a series of actions without thinking. Moreover, after he realize what he did, he didn’t feel any regret.

He didn’t want Lina to be hurt in any way.

Although he had already helped Lina out of the situation, Mark seemed to have already placed all his hostility on Second Young Master and the Second Young Madam.

“If I hadn’t lost my composure, you and Young Madam wouldn’t have been threatened,” Chen Qing said with a pained expression. He hadn’t done what he should have done and caused Second Young Master and Second Young Madam to be hurt.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Chen Qing’s face. He recalled the bet Qiao Nian had made with him previously. Although the bet wasn’t official, he still looked at Chen Qing with interest and said seriously, “I’m 100% confident and that’s why I brought Nian’er here.”

“Second Young Master, I know your ability, but if I hadn’t been rash this time, there wouldn’t have been so much trouble,” Chen Qing said guiltily.

Gu Zhou recalled that Chen Qing had been with him for a long time. Thinking of Qiao Nian’s words, he couldn’t be bothered to listen to Chen Qing’s apology anymore. He asked seriously, “I’ve already taught you many times in the past. Since it’s already happened, let it pass. Don’t keep dwelling on it. Then tell me, what was your motive for rushing forward back then?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Gu Zhou’s words were like a bolt of lightning that struck Chen Qing.

Chen Qing stood rooted to the ground, clenching his fists uneasily. His voice trembled as he said, “I-I just don’t want the Seventh Princess to be forced. I don’t want her to be bullied. I…”

Gu Zhou looked at Chen Qing’s helpless expression and asked seriously, “You’ve been by my side for so long. When would I do such an abnormal thing in the past?”

Chen Qing knew Gu Zhou well. When he heard Gu Zhou’s words, he said without hesitation, “Of course it’s because of Second Young Madam!”

What Second Young Master cared about the most was the safety of Young Madam. As long as Second Young Madam was safe, Second Young Master didn’t care about anything.

“For you.” Gu Zhou handed a key to Chen Qing.

Chen Qing took the key and looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “This is…”

“Of course it’s the key to the Seventh Princess’s room,” Gu Zhou said very naturally. He looked at Chen Qing’s sparkling eyes, which were like those of a dog. “Nian’er prepared a spare key in advance. I thought it might be useful.”

Chen Qing looked down at the key in his hand, and his lips curved up involuntarily.

This must have been specially prepared for him by the Second Young Madam. How could she let Second Young Master go to the Seventh Princess’s room?

He looked at the key and his heart was filled with joy. However, when he thought about how much danger he might cause if he really went, he hesitated.

“Second Young Master, do you really not blame me for being rash?”

Gu Zhou patted Chen Qing’s shoulder and said with a smile, “Not only are you my subordinate, but you’re also my good brother. Moreover, you’re a man!”

Chen Qing’s eyes were hot. He looked at Gu Zhou, momentarily speechless.

Seeing how emotional Chen Qing was, Gu Zhou looked around and said in a low voice, “They’re angry today. If you want to go there, I’m afraid you have to be more careful.”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, his lips curved up slightly. He said in a low voice, “It’s my fault for making Second Young Master worry about my safety.”

He was just a guard, and the last thing his master needed was to worry about the safety of his guard.

However, Second Young Master still took him to heart.
