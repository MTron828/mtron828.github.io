1360 Give Birth?

She got up and sat up. She was about to pick up the photo album under her pillow when she realized that it was gone.

Gu Zhou must have put it away. Qiao Nian casually took the cell phone and picked up the call.

“Old Qin?”

“Nian’er, I’m your senior brother. Can you call me senior brother? Don’t you think Old Qin is saying that I’m old?” When Qin Chuan said this, his tone carried a trace of grievance and resentment.

“You’ve always called me that. Why change your name?”

“I heard that you’re going to Europe?” Qin Chuan said seriously.

“I do have a plan but I haven’t confirmed the time yet.” Qiao Nian grabbed a handful of her hair and got out of bed. She pulled open the curtains and looked out at the bright sun. She was in a good mood.

“I’m going back to An City soon. I’ll go with you,” Qin Chuan said.

Qiao Nian recalled her brother’s words. With Qin Chuan around, she would be of some help. “Okay.”

“By the way, there’s something else I want to tell you.”

“What?”

“I helped Grandpa take in a disciple.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She asked in surprise, “Why are you helping Grandpa take in a disciple?”

“I’m taking your sister in as Grandpa’s little disciple,” Qin Chuan said.

Qiao Nian’s face was filled with surprise.

Back then, her grandfather had long said that she was his last disciple. In other words, her grandfather no longer planned to take in another disciple.

Why had Qin Chuan taken the initiative to take in a disciple for his grandfather?

“Why?” Qiao Nian asked in confusion.

“I plan to take Qi Qi to pay respects to our ancestors when we return to An City and settle this matter.”

Qiao Nian frowned.

Qi Qi.

“Did you call to specially tell me about helping Grandpa take in a disciple?” Qiao Nian asked.

Qin Chuan said, “I think I have to tell you about this.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Qiao Nian was speechless.

He was just informing her. It was useless for her to say anything.

Qiao Nian thought that it wasn’t a bad idea for Lu Qi to study with Qin Chuan, but it was very cold on the spiritual mountain. She continued, “Alright, then. Go and take good care of Lu Qi. It’s cold on the mountain. Bring more clothes.”

“I understand.”

Qin Chuan exchanged a few more words with Qiao Nian before hanging up.

Qiao Nian had just finished washing up and was about to go downstairs when Gu Zhou walked in.

“You…” Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she saw Gu Zhou’s pale face and asked in a low voice, “Your wound…”

“My wound is fine now. Don’t worry.” Gu Zhou moved slightly closer to Qiao Nian’s face and kissed her. In a voice that only the two of them could hear, he said, “Let’s do it again. I’ll be fine too.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, her ears instantly turned red.

Why was this man still thinking about those things in broad daylight?

Whenever she thought of the ambiguous scene last night, her face turned redder and redder. She looked down.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s shy expression, Gu Zhou recalled Qiao Nian’s situation last night. He raised his hand and tucked Qiao Nian’s hair behind her ear, saying in a low voice, “Let’s continue tonight!”

“Don’t…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou continued, “But I sent the children to school this morning. They said that they wanted a younger brother or sister.”

Qiao Nian’s pupils dilated. “I…”

“Xiao Shi said that you were willing to give birth to a few more.”

Qiao Nian said, “No.”

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly.

Qiao Nian hurriedly said, “Don’t spout nonsense. Let’s take care of the three children first. They’re still young. Three children is already a lot.”

“Is it a lot?”

Qiao Nian nodded seriously and said solemnly, “We have to raise the children well. We can’t just have more.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “The children haven’t received parental love well in the past. We should let them enjoy a happy childhood.”

Gu Zhou nodded in agreement. “We do have to raise our children well.”

“Yes,” Qiao Nian said.

Gu Zhou continued, “But the three children want us to give birth to more children the most. Let’s satisfy their small wishes first.”

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly.

Gu Zhou reached out and hugged Qiao Nian’s waist, saying gently, “If we still want a child, we don’t need to use contraception in the future. When the time comes, we’ll do it three times a night. You should be able to get pregnant soon!”
