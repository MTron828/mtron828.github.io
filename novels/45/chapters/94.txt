“Jiang Yue, after I left the medicinal room yesterday, did you enter the medicinal room?” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue intently. When she spoke to Zhao Qian yesterday, she had vaguely sensed that someone was outside.

Jiang Yue frowned. She said angrily, “Qiao Nian, you’re trying to frame me. I’m telling you, Grandma has raised me since I was young. How could I do such a thing?”

Holding the fruit knife, Qiao Nian stepped towards Matriarch Gu. She sneered when she heard Jiang Yue’s words. “You know very well whether you did it or not.”

“I didn’t do anything.” Jiang Yue argued loudly. Seeing Qiao Nian pick up the fruit knife, she took two steps back in fear. When she saw that Qiao Nian wasn’t about to rush at her with the knife, she hurriedly stepped forward again to stop Qiao Nian. “W-What are you going to do with the knife?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Tm going to save Grandma’s life. You’d better go somewhere else. Don’t interfere with my work!” Qiao Nian reached out and pushed Jiang Yue’s arm away.

Jiang Yue hurriedly grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand, her eyes full of vigilance. “You won’t need a knife to save Grandma!”

“Let go of me!” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue, practically speechless with frustration. Without hesitation, she mercilessly dislocated one of Jiang Yue’s arms.

The pain was so great that Jiang Yue screamed, instantly turning pale.

Qiao Nian walked over to the bed. Seeing Gu Zhou looking at Matriarch Gu worriedly, she comforted him. “Grandma will be fine. I’ll start letting some of Grandma’s blood now…”

“You’re spouting nonsense! Who treats patients like this?!” Right now, Jiang Yue had more on her mind than just the pain. She couldn’t even be bothered to scream about it any longer. Instead, she shouted, “I’ve already called 120. The ambulance will be here soon!”

Seeing that Gu Zhou trusted Qiao Nian, Jiang Yue grew so anxious that tears began to stream down her face. “Second Brother, you mustn’t believe what she’s saying. She has always been a suspect in this incident. We can’t let her torment Grandma anymore, unless she can prove her innocence.”

Gu Zhou did not speak. He lowered his gaze, seemingly in thought.

“I don’t need to prove anything, If we miss the optimal window for treatment, that will be a big problem for Grandma.” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and said calmly, “Moreover, Jiang Yue is clearly full of nonsense. She’s not thinking of how to stabilize Grandma’s condition. Instead, she wants to sow

discord at this critical moment. She likely has other intentions.”

Gu Zhou glanced at the butler and said impassively, “Tie her up and throw her out!”

Jiang Yue thought that Gu Zhou was going to throw Qiao Nian out of the room. She looked toward Qiao Nian with arrogance, but when the butler walked up to her, she was completely stunned.

“What are you doing? Why are you tying me up? Second Brother asked you to throw Qiao Nian out, not me!” One of Jiang Yue’s arms had been dislocated, and she was in a lot of pain. Seeing that the butler was still trying to tie her up, she turned red from exertion and anxiety.

The butler did not speak. Instead, he swiftly tied Jiang Yue up. Although Jiang Yue was Matriarch Lin’s god-granddaughter, Second Young Master’s words were the imperial edict.

‘As Jiang Yue was led out of the room by the butler, she turned back to glare resentfully at Qiao Nian.

Grandma trusted Qiao Nian!

Gu Zhou trusted Qiao Nian!

Even Zhao Qian, who liked Gu Zhou, was beginning to trust Qiao Nian!

How was this fair?

‘Why did everyone believe Qiao Nian? Why not her?

‘When Jiang Yue had been taken out, the room fell silent.

Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian and said coldly, “If you don’t make a move now, I’ll believe for the time being that this has nothing to do with you. If you make a move now, but fail to save Grandma, you won’t be able to live either!”

Qiao Nian’s dark eyes were fixed intently on Gu Zhou. She knew very well that Gu Zhou was testing her.

Moreover, she knew that Gu Zhou was not joking. If she did not manage to save Grandma, he would kill her without hesitation.

Qiao Nian gripped the fruit knife in her hand tightly. Lowering her gaze, she cut open her grandmother’s hand without hesitation.

Blood gushed out instantly, dying the bedsheets crimson. It was a ghastly sight!

Qiao Nian was using an action to answer Gu Zhou’s question.

If Grandma lived, she would live. If Grandma died, she was willing to die with Grandma!

Everyone was stunned by Qiao Nian’s actions.
