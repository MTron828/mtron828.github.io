Qiao Nian knew in her heart that Gu Zhou was definitely not joking. He was seriously considering this matter.

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. She pursed her lips. “Don’t, I…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou placed her on the sofa in the living room.

Gu Zhou walked to the water dispenser at the side, filled a cup with hot water, and handed it to Qiao Nian. “Drink some water to calm yourself down.”

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou, her eyes a little red. She took the cup from Gu Zhou and said softly, “Thank you.”

After drinking some hot water, Qiao Nian finally recovered. Everything that had happened just now replayed in her mind. She wished she could find a hole to hide in.

“I’m sorry. Just now, I…”

“It’s my fault. I didn’t know you were afraid of the dark,” Gu Zhou interrupted her coldly.

Qiao Nian froze. She had clearly done something wrong tonight, but Gu Zhou had already apologized to her three times.

She was slightly stunned, but she didn’t know how to answer.

She was not afraid of the dark.

No matter how familiar the environment was, darkness had no effect on her.

However, when she was in an unfamiliar environment, the darkness would always remind her of that night five years ago. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t get rid of the nightmare. Then, she would do some unimaginable things uncontrollably.

Only she and Qin Chuan knew about this.

If Gu Zhou had not brought her here tonight, she would not have done such a thing.

However, she still didn’t understand. Had she said something wrong? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Why had he suddenly left?

“Are you feeling better?” Gu Zhou asked softly.

“I’m fine. Let’s go back. I wonder how Gu Qi is now. Is he better?” Qiao Nian gave a faint smile.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, remaining silent.

The two of them walked out of the villa. Gu Zhou drove the other car back with Qiao Nian.

When they arrived at the Gu family’s main residence, it was already past three in the morning. Most people had already entered the house to rest, and there was no one outside.

Just as they reached the second floor, they saw Gu Qi walking out of the house barefooted, dragging a pillow with one hand.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She quickly walked over and hurriedly picked Gu Qi up, casually tossing the pillow in Gu Qi’s hand to Gu Zhou.

Before she left, there were servants guarding Gu Qi’s room. Why had all of them disappeared?

Qiao Nian hugged Gu Qi and touched his forehead, then his feet. His forehead was no longer burning, but his feet were still a little cold.

Gu Qi noticed Qiao Nian’s small actions and didn’t say anything. His little fingers twirled around Qiao Nian’s long hair, and his eyes gradually lit up.

He liked being hugged by Qiao Nian like this. It was very warm and comfortable.

Afraid that they would disturb Grandma, Qiao Nian hurriedly carried Gu Qi back to his room and placed him on the bed. She said softly, “Little Qi, you still have a cold. You can’t get out of bed casually, especially your feet. You can’t catch a cold. Most of the time, people fall ill because their feet catch a cold.”

Gu Qi sat on the bed with his head lowered, not speaking. His fingers were still wrapped around Qiao Nian’s hair. He looked like an obedient child.

As for Gu Zhou, who had followed Qiao Nian in with a pillow, he was completely stunned. He had never expected Little Qi to accept Qiao Nian’s embrace. One had to know that Little Qi had always been very resistant to others touching him.

Gu Zhou placed the pillow back on the bed and took out his phone to send Chen Qing a message. “Check how many times Qiao Nian and Little Qi have met.”

After sending the message, Gu Zhou calmly turned off his phone and stood calmly at the side. Qiao Nian brought over a basin of water and helped Gu Qi wash his feet.

Gu Qi was sitting by the bed, looking at Qiao Nian with sparkling eyes.

Gu Qi’s gaze was something Gu Zhou had never seen before.
