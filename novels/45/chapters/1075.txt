1076 Disappointment

She had never expected Shen Hao to really be lustful towards Qiao Nian back then!

She was clearly the best-looking person in the village, but Shen Hao actually had designs on a bean sprout like Qiao Nian!

A trace of despair gradually appeared in Xu Qiu’s eyes.

Gu Zhou looked at Shen Hao calmly and said, “Of course I’ll be angry!”

Not far away, Su Xue was slightly stunned when she heard Gu Zhou’s words!

If she had known that Gu Zhou minded Qiao Nian being with another man, she would have told Gu Zhou about what happened to Qiao Nian six years ago!

This way, Gu Zhou would never like Qiao Nian again!

Su Xue’s eyes were filled with schemes. She had to make Qiao Nian die without a burial ground! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, before Su Xue could speak, Gu Zhou’s next words were like an invisible hand slapping her face mercilessly!

“I’ll only be angry that I didn’t protect her back then and didn’t marry her sooner!”

Cold sweat broke out on Shen Hao’s face. He could not believe that Gu Zhou would say such a thing.

No man could accept his woman being with another man!

Unless that man loved his woman dearly!

Shen Hao frowned. He felt that the man in front of him was an idiot!

Hence, he enunciated each word clearly. “You have to know that she made you a cuckold in the past. Aren’t you angry at all? What if she still wants to make you a cuckold in the future?”

Shen Hao felt that he had made himself clear this time. He only hoped that this man would dump Qiao Nian as soon as possible so that he could return all the humiliation he had suffered to Qiao Nian!

Gu Zhou said coldly, “Even if what you said is true, it’s because I didn’t treat her well enough!”

What?

Shen Hao felt that there was something wrong with his ears!

After a long while, Shen Hao finally realized what Gu Zhou was talking about.

Shen Hao’s eyes widened as he looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. He did not believe that such a man existed in this world!

Xu Qiu and Su Xue were also stunned!

They could not believe that there was actually a man in this world who doted on his wife without any limits!

Su Xue thought of Qiao Shan again.

Although she had made Qiao Shan a cuckold, that was only because she was too lonely!

Qiao Shan was a workaholic. He usually didn’t have time to accompany her. So what if she wanted to have some fun herself?

If Qiao Shan really loved her, he should take the initiative to reflect on his own problems when Qiao Shan found out that she was with another man, not beat her up.

Could it be that Qiao Shan didn’t love her enough?

Su Xue’s eyes gradually turned red. There were probably not many men in the world who doted on their wives like Gu Zhou.

Su Xue tried hard to suppress her dissatisfaction with Qiao Shan.

At this moment, Xu Qiu seemed to have been struck by lightning. She stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. Just now, she had been angry because Gu Zhou had bullied her man, but now, she really hoped that her man would be like Gu Zhou!

Xu Qiu closed her eyes in despair. She had yet to get over the fact that her man wanted to betray her.

Gu Zhou turned around and walked towards Qiao Nian. He gave Chen Qing a look, indicating for him to do as he saw fit!

Chen Qing gave the two bodyguards a look and gestured. The two bodyguards immediately let go of Xu Qiu and dragged Shen Hao, who was lying on the ground, away.

“Where… where are you taking me?” Shen Hao shouted anxiously. Endless fear surged in his heart. He didn’t want to leave with the bodyguards. He was afraid!

Then, he was dragged by two bodyguards. His pants were already frayed. He wanted to struggle free, but the two bodyguards were holding on too tightly!

“Honey, save me, honey!” Shen Hao looked at Xu Qiu for help and shouted!

When Xu Qiu heard Shen Hao’s voice, she glanced at him coldly before looking away!

She didn’t even know how to face Shen Hao now!

She couldn’t help but suspect that Shen Hao had cheated on her long ago. Yet, she still trusted him like a fool!

Seeing that Xu Qiu was ignoring him, Shen Hao’s gaze fell on Su Xue’s face again. He said loudly, “Sister Su Xue, save me!”

Su Xue frowned. She could finally tell that Qiao Nian would never let them off. She asked, “What are you doing?”
