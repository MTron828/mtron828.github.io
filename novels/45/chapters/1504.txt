1505 Excited

The President’s eyes lit up as he looked at the car approaching not far away. He clenched his fists nervously.

The car stopped steadily in the parking space. Seeing this, the president quickly walked over. Before he reached the car, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou got out.

Gu Zhou was holding two pots of Falling Autumn Grass.

The president’s footsteps quickened. He walked up to Gu Zhou and greeted politely, “Young Master Gu and Madam Gu.”

All his attention was on the Falling Autumn Grass in Gu Zhou’s hand. The pot on the left was the one Annie had brought over previously. There was only a new seedling on the right, but that leaf was clearly the leaf of the Falling Autumn Grass.

“It’s really… it’s really Falling Autumn Grass!” The usually calm president’s voice trembled.

Lina smiled and took Qiao Nian’s arm. She said excitedly, “Nian Nian, you’re really amazing. You actually cultivated Falling Autumn Grass!”

Qiao Nian smiled, her expression calm, as if cultivating Falling Autumn Grass was just a simple matter. Her gaze fell on the President’s face. “Mr. President, can we go and see Madam President?”

When Qiao Nian said this, she was a little flustered. She really wanted to confirm if Madam President was Professor Shen’s daughter.

The president had been immersed in the excitement of being able to cultivate Autumn Grass on his own in the future. When he heard Qiao Nian’s words, he hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, yes, yes. Go and see my Madam. Come, this way.”

The president asked the captain of the guards to carry the two pots of Falling Autumn Grass. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and his eyes were filled with surprise. He really hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to really do it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Everyone walked towards Madam President’s room. The journey was very quiet.

What puzzled the President the most was that his brother could actually remain calm and bide his time.

Soon, they arrived at the door of the room the president had asked Madam to stay in.

Qiao Nian gave Gu Zhou a reassuring look before following the president in. Qiao Nian could vaguely see a woman behind a screen not far away. Before she entered, she had been very nervous, but when she saw the woman sitting on the dressing table, the uneasiness in her heart had completely disappeared.

The woman’s figure was thin, as if a gust of wind could blow her away!

The president looked at Qiao Nian and said in a low voice, “Madam Gu, wait for me. I…”

Before the president could finish speaking, the woman behind the screen stepped out.

Qiao Nian met Madam President’s amber eyes, and a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

Madam President’s double eyelids were very European. They seemed to be carved from the same mold as Lina’s eyes.

Qiao Nian remembered very clearly that Professor Shen’s daughter had a pair of beautiful phoenix eyes.

Professor Shen’s daughter had a gentle oval face, but the Madam President in front of her was too thin. There was no flesh on her face, and her bones were well-defined.

There was no mole on the tip of Madam President’s nose.

It seemed that Madam President was not the daughter of Professor Shen they were looking for.

Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly. She really hoped that the woman in front of her wasn’t Madam President, but just a servant in the palace.

However, the president’s next words were like a basin of cold water, pouring over Qiao Nian from head to toe and instantly waking her up.

The President wrapped his arm around Madam President’s waist and looked at her lovingly. His voice was extremely gentle. “You haven’t recovered yet. Why are you up?”

Madam President gave an “I’m fine” smile. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Her eyes were slightly unfocused, but she looked at Qiao Nian persistently.

Her body twitched uncontrollably, but she quickly returned to normal.

Just this action had already exposed the difference between Madam President and ordinary people.

The President gently planted a kiss on Madam President’s lips. Following her gaze, he said seriously, “Darling, this is the doctor I specially found for you. Her surname is Qiao.”

“Qiao,” Madam President said softly.

“Yes, you can call her Doctor Qiao.” The President’s lips curved up slightly. There was a smile on his face, and his eyes were filled with love for Madam President.
