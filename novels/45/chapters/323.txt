Chapter 324: Reply to the Message

Wang Xuan looked at the hooligan’s message and frowned. She handed the phone to Qiao Nian and asked, “Someone is cursing very badly. Do you want to scold him back?”

“There’s no need.”

Qiao Nian took the phone from her, then quickly entered a code on the phone with her fingers. She clicked send.

In an instant, a loudspeaker jumped out of the game hall.

As the player “hooligan” has insulted and attacked other players, from today onwards, he will be muted for 9,999,999 days.

After this loudspeaker was sent out, the entire Internet fell silent.

What was going on?

The officials had actually made an appearance.

It had been so many days. Wouldn’t that hooligan never be able to lift the ban for the rest of his life?””

…

The netizens were all extremely shocked. This was the first time they had seen an official player using a megaphone to silence others.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s actions, Wang Xuan was stunned. She looked at Qiao Nian in a new light. “How exactly did you do it?”

“That’s not important. See if the first place in the national server has replied to your messages.” Qiao Nian handed her phone to Wang Xuan.

......

Wang Xuan took the phone and nodded. She opened her private message and shook her head in disappointment. “No.”

“Wait a little longer.”

If the first place in the local server really owed money, he would definitely contact Wang Xuan’s game account.

On the other side, Gu Qi was sitting casually on the sofa. He casually scrolled through his private messages, but he didn’t recognize any of the amounts written on them. After scrolling for a while, he finally found one he was satisfied with.

[Boss, I’m just a poor student. Can I play with you for fifteen yuan a round? I really don’t have much money!]

Fifteen yuan?

Wasn’t this the money he owed Auntie?

Just as Gu Qi was about to reply, he saw the notification on the loudspeaker on the front page. So the hooligan had been muted.

He briefly scrolled through the chat history and saw that someone had placed a bid of 20 million per round. That hooligan was furious and directly cursed on the public channel. That was why he was banned.

There was a person who directly insulted hooligans. The netizen’s name happened to be Xuan.

Wasn’t this the netizen who had just sent him a private message?

Gu Qi returned and was about to send a message when the netizen named Xuan sent another message.

“Mr. Q, you should set the price. It doesn’t matter how much it costs.”

Gu Qi blinked his beautiful fox-like eyes. Then, he looked at Xuan’s profile picture in satisfaction. This person seemed to be quite reliable.

With this thought in mind, Gu Qi replied to her private message.

On the other hand, Wang Xuan waited for a long time before she finally received a private message from Mr. Q.

She jumped up in joy and said to Qiao Nian excitedly, “Nian Nian, the great god has replied to my message!”

With that, Wang Xuan handed the phone to Qiao Nian. “Take a look. What did the great god reply?”

Mr. Q wrote: “Any price?”

Seeing this, Wang Xuan looked at Qiao Nian worriedly and asked carefully, “Nian Nian, do you think he’ll ask for a higher price? If he does, won’t it be too extravagant? It won’t be worth it.”

“Just say yes. Let’s see what he has to say,” Qiao Nian said calmly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After Wang Xuan replied, she received a reply in less than half a minute.

“Is 15 okay?”

Wang Xuan looked at her phone in disbelief. She rubbed her eyes. She was very sure that she was not seeing things.

Could it be that the huge sum of money the Almighty had mentioned was fifteen yuan?

Qiao Nian was also a little stunned.

Didn’t he almost agree to a huge sum of money?

This…

Wasn’t 15 yuan a little too little?

One had to know that the number of people the Great God was leading now basically numbered in the hundreds or thousands.

Wang Xuan looked at the chat box on her phone in surprise and said, “It’s really just fifteen yuan, not twenty million!”

At the mention of fifteen dollars, Qiao Nian thought of Gu Qi. Gu Qi still owed her fifteen dollars.

However, Gu Qi had yet to send her a message. She wondered if she would have a chance to see that child again.

Wang Xuan was still in a daze. She turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked, “How do you think I should answer?”
