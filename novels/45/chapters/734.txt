Gu Zhou’s words were reasonable and precise. She could not refute him.

Initially, Qiao Nian had thought that she wouldn’t be able to hide it from Gu Zhou for long. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to discover so much in just one morning.

Qiao Nian fell into deep thought. The Gu and Lu families were very close. She also believed that Gu Zhou would never harm her. She wondered if she should tell Gu Zhou that she was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment and said, “When did you discover this?”

“I’ve always felt this.” At another red light, Gu Zhou stopped the car again. He turned to look at Qiao Nian and said seriously, “Back at the hospital, I realized that there was something wrong with the way Lu Zhu looked at you.”

Qiao Nian’s pupils dilated involuntarily, then she smiled helplessly. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to be so observant.

“In the beginning, Lu Zhu’s attitude towards you wasn’t good. I originally thought that it was because of what happened to the two of you at Jiang Chi that Lu Zhu’s attitude towards you changed. It wasn’t until I saw the same look in Lu Nian’s eyes that I understood what Lu Zhu meant by looking at you.”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly, not daring to look into Gu Zhou’s eyes. This person was too observant.

Gu Zhou tapped his hand gently on the steering wheel and looked at Qiao Nian without blinking. His expression gradually turned serious. “You should be the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian!”

Qiao Nian suddenly looked up at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

She had not expected Gu Zhou to deduce it so quickly.

Gu Zhou was simply too amazing. He could even be a detective.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s expression and instantly understood.

Indeed, his judgment was correct.

When Gu Zhou had just left the Lu family, he had sent Chen Qing back alone.

He wanted to be alone with Qiao Nian because he wanted to ask her clearly.

When he got an affirmative answer, he heaved a sigh of relief.

No wonder Qiao Nian had told him that she would never be with Lu Zhu.

How could biological siblings be together?

Gu Zhou felt a little emotional. He had not expected that after more than twenty years, he would still end up with the fiancée he was engaged to. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Ah Nian and Lu Zhu care about the eldest daughter of the Lu family the most. Moreover, it’s impossible for them to be filled with love and concern for an unfamiliar member of the opposite sex. They did this because the person they’re facing is their family!”

Qiao Nian had long known that Gu Zhou was a smart person, but she hadn’t expected him to be so smart. He could actually associate her with the deceased eldest daughter of the Lu family.

No one would casually associate a living person with a dead person.

Gu Zhou smiled self-deprecatingly and said, “They disregarded our many years of friendship and cared for and doted on you. Other than the fact that you’re their family, I can’t think of any other reason.”

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze. Seeing that the red light had turned green, he started driving again.

Back then, when he first saw Qiao Nian, he had found her familiar. At that time, he hadn’t remembered it. Why did he find Qiao Nian familiar?

Later on, when Lu Nian returned, he realized that Qiao Nian’s eyes were exactly the same as Lu Nian’s. The only difference was that Lu Nian had single eyelids, while Qiao Nian had double eyelids.

Gu Zhou still remembered what Grandma had told him. Last year, when Grandma had brought Qiao Nian to the Lu family, Song Yu had looked at Qiao Nian’s back and directly recognized her as Madam Lu. In other words, Qiao Nian looked very similar to Madam Lu’s back.

Some time ago, Gu Zhou had taken out a photo of Madam Lu. Only then did he realize that Qiao Nian’s face looked very similar to Madam Lu’s.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. After a long while, she said, “You’re right. I’m the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian.”

When Qiao Nian admitted this, Gu Zhou’s heart instantly calmed down.

In the past, Gu Zhou did not believe in fate, but now he did.

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly. He recalled the first time he had seen her when he was young. At that time, he had bitten her face and tortured her until she cried.
