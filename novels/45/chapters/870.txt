871 Strange Data

She really wanted to tell Xiao Shi that she didn’t want to return to Hai Cheng at all. She just wanted to stay in An City and marry Gu Zhou.

However, she knew in her heart that Xiao Shi’s emotions were very fragile now and she would break down easily. If she said such things again, Xiao Shi might take things too hard. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

But now, Xiao Shi’s survival was the most important. If Xiao Shi was gone, all her plans would be useless.

Song Man reached out and held Xiao Shi’s hand, comforting her gently. “Xiao Shi, Mommy already understands what you mean. Mommy will never force you again!”

Xiao Shi’s eyes gradually lit up. Mommy actually listened to her.

“Actually, Mommy didn’t give you the sleeping pills to do anything to you. It’s not that I don’t like you. I just hope you can sleep well. All these years, you’ve been painstakingly taking care of Mommy. That’s why Mommy asked you to sleep well!”

Xiao Shi knew in her heart that her mommy was lying to her. Her mommy probably wanted to use her to be with her daddy, but she was afraid that she would say something inappropriate beside her so she gave her sleeping pills to make her sleep.

After Song Man finished speaking, she recalled how Xiao Shi had always mocked herself for being a burden. She frowned and continued, “Also, you’re not a burden. You’re Mommy’s only daughter. Mommy cares about you the most. Have you ever thought about how Mommy will live if you’re no longer around? Mommy won’t want to live at all!”

When she heard Song Man’s words, the sadness in her heart instantly disappeared.

She didn’t know if her mommy was lying to her, but she was willing to trust her mommy again.

“No matter what happens in the future, don’t think about committing suicide. Xiao Shi, you have to live well!” Song Man said earnestly.

Xiao Shi’s gaze landed on Song Man’s face and she nodded obediently.

Mommy really cared about her.

She had to work hard to earn money in the future and let her mommy live a better life.

“You just came out of the operating theater. Rest well now!”

Xiao Shi nodded and closed her eyes.

Song Man sat beside Xiao Shi and looked at her with her eyes closed. Her heart was in a mess.

Xiao Shi’s morals were too strong. Even with their blood ties, Xiao Shi would not help her at all. She could only think of other ways.

…

At this moment, in the appraisal room.

Chen Qing followed Gu Zhou’s instructions and followed closely behind Doctor Xu. He was afraid that something would go wrong with the sample, and that there would be other problems when Doctor Xu did the DNA test. He stared unblinkingly at Doctor Xu.

Doctor Xu looked up at the time on the wall clock. It was about time to take out the test report.

This machine had been imported from overseas. Not only could it be used for DNA testing, but it could also be used for more subtle examinations of blood.

Initially, the person who developed this machine wanted to examine the genetic diseases of everyone who did a DNA test. Later on, many people were willing to buy this machine mainly because they wanted to take the opportunity to see if there were any lesions in their blood. Then, they would do a paternity test and blood test openly.

Doctor Xu took out the test report. He glanced at the contents and frowned slightly.

This was the first time he had seen such a test.

Doctor Xu hesitated for a moment. He turned to look at Chen Qing and asked, “This examination report is a little strange. I wonder if the owner of the DNA sample has had a blood-type illness before?”

When Chen Qing heard Doctor Xu’s words, he frowned. “I’m not sure about this. I’ll investigate.”

When Doctor Xu heard Chen Qing’s words, he understood. He didn’t want to participate in this matter, but this blood was a little strange. If he didn’t raise this question, the Gu family might really take this report seriously.

Doctor Xu handed the report to Chen Qing and said, “It’s possible for human blood to change!”

With that, Doctor Xu smiled and said, “I have other things to do now. Please pass this test report to Young Master Gu.”

Chen Qing nodded. He had seen Doctor Xu’s every move just now. This report was also typed by Doctor Xu. It was indeed Song Man and Xiao Shi’s DNA paternity test.
