Chapter 327: Refusal

When Gao Lin heard Qiao Nian’s words, she gasped and no longer dared to speak. She knew that Qiao Nian meant what she said.

Qiao Nian hung up and put her phone aside. The smile on her face faded a little.

Wang Xuan stood at the side. She had heard everything Qiao Nian had said on the phone just now. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief and said, “I’ve never seen anyone as brazen as Gao Lin.”

“I’ve never seen it either,” Qiao Nian said honestly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Will she continue causing trouble?” Wang Xuan looked up at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Yue shook her head gently and frowned. “I don’t know about that, but I’m certain that she won’t disturb me again!”

Wang Xuan heaved a sigh of relief and nodded. “That’s good!”

At the entrance of the stadium.

Gao Lin stood at the side, looking at the people entering the venue with envy. Her expression darkened.

It seemed that she would never have the chance to attend Mr. Dong Hua’s concert again.

She had already been abandoned by this world. The school did not allow her to step into the music industry either. Her music dream had come to an abrupt end.

At the thought of this, Gao Lin felt terrible. Her eyes turned blank, and tears welled up in her eyes.

She didn’t understand why she was so unlucky.

......

She had clearly done nothing wrong.

In the beginning, she purely trusted Ye Ran. After that, she just wanted to help Xia Xue stabilize her status. That was why she kept targeting Qiao Nian.

But she had never expected Qiao Nian to be a true big shot.

If she had stood on Qiao Nian’s side from the beginning and protected her in every way, she might have been able to get in now.

However, this was all an assumption.

“Look, isn’t that Gao Lin?”

A woman’s voice interrupted Gao Lin’s thoughts.

Gao Lin looked over and saw Ye Ran wearing a black and sexy outfit. She was holding a baseball bat in her right hand. Smiling, she walked towards Gao Lin and said mockingly, “Aren’t you quite good at sucking up to others? Why aren’t you entering Mr. Dong Hua’s concert?”

Ye Ran was accompanied by a few female delinquents and hooligans. Their hair was colorful, and it was obvious that they were not good students.

Gao Lin turned pale in fear. Fear surged in her heart, and she retreated step by step.

However, her back was against the wall. There was no way out.

Gao Lin shuddered involuntarily and swallowed. “What do you want?”

“What do I want to do?” Ye Ran raised her eyebrows slightly and asked in amusement, “What do you mean by what do I want to do? Do you have amnesia? Previously, when you discovered that my tickets were fake, you, Liu Yu, and the others surrounded me and beat me up. You even injured my face. Have you forgotten about that?”

When Gao Lin heard Ye Ran’s words, fear rose in her heart. She tried hard to remain calm and said, “Ye Ran, think about it carefully. Actually, we can work together. Qiao Nian is the one who harmed us. Qiao Nian is our match. Let’s cripple her together, okay?”

“Don’t worry, none of you will be able to escape. I was waiting for Qiao Nian, but I didn’t expect you to come first.” Ye Ran crossed her arms and looked at Gao Lin. “I didn’t expect you to be expelled from school as well. For the sake of the past, I’ll give you a reminder. My parents had many connections but because Qiao Nian is the principal of An University, no university is willing to take me in. I can only say that I’m going to a vocational school!”

“My face has been ruined by you vicious women. My life is over. I will never let you off!”

As Ye Ran spoke, she approached Gao Lin.

Gao Lin looked at Ye Ran, her legs trembling. She screamed, “Don’t do anything rash. This is the downtown area. If you dare to do anything rash, you’ll go to jail in the future!”

“What’s there to be afraid of in jail? My future is already ruined. Why would I be afraid of going to jail?” Ye Ran looked at Gao Lin in amusement. Then, she said to the people around her, “Go, strip her naked and hit her hard. I’ll give 100,000 yuan to whoever hits her hard.”
