Chapter 1555 Accessory?

Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Although Cui Qi didn't understand what Qiao Nian had done to him, he was very dissatisfied with her actions.

He was the great general of Europe. Although he had been unwilling to appear on camera in the past, no one who knew him would treat him like Qiao Nian did.

It wasn't embarrassing if he couldn't beat Gu Zhou, but it would be utterly embarrassing if he couldn't beat a woman.

Qiao Nian retracted her hand casually, a trace of mockery in her eyes. She said coldly, "Since you don't know how to speak, don't."

Fortunately, she had used a poison that could numb one's nerves. Otherwise, Cui Qi would have already become a corpse.

Cui Qi's eyes widened uncontrollably.

This time, he had received a special order to kill Qiao Nian.

Initially, he hadn't taken Qiao Nian seriously at all. He just felt that Qiao Nian was a friend of the Seventh Princess and Gu Zhou's woman. She was just an accessory.

He had never expected Qiao Nian to have such ability.

Cui Qi knew in his heart that even if he died, his subordinates would still do their best to complete the mission. Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were definitely dead.

However, he was panicking. It was as if something was out of his control. He looked at Qiao Nian in front of him and felt that she should be quite skilled.

Gu Zhou glanced around unblinkingly. Not far away, there were still people surrounding him.

It seemed that Cui Qi had really brought many people with him this time.

Gu Zhou fired a shot into the sky, startling the birds in the forest.

At this moment, Cui Qi's heart was in his throat, but he quickly regained his composure. His mind raced as he thought about how to escape.

Gu Zhou looked at Cui Qi expressionlessly. His gaze fell on Cui Qi's face, and his voice was as cold as an icicle that was stabbed into a person's chest in winter. "General Cui, do you want to live or die?"

The gunshots made Cui Qi's men turn their attention to Gu Zhou. All the guns were aimed at Cui Qi.

Gu Zhou removed the silver needle from Cui Qi's face. If the silver needle was still inserted into Cui Qi's face, he would probably be speechless.

Cui Qi's lips trembled a few times. He glared fiercely at Gu Zhou and gritted his teeth. "At most, we'll die together!"

"Die together?" Gu Zhou sneered. He did not expect Cui Qi to be so unyielding. He glanced at Cui Qi's men and continued, "Including these people on the mountain and the 632 people from the Cui family? If General Cui has no objections, I'll let them die with you."

With that, Gu Zhou fired two more shots that hit Cui Qi's legs.

Cui Qi lost his balance and knelt on the ground. Two holes appeared where he had been hit, and blood flowed out.

Cui Qi's lips trembled slightly. He hurriedly raised his hand and said to his subordinates, "Stop!"

Cui Qi really hadn't expected Gu Zhou to attack. After giving orders to his own people, his red eyes stared fixedly at Gu Zhou. He was so angry that his chest heaved violently. "Are… are you threatening me?"

Gu Zhou looked down at Cui Qi with a faint smile on his face, but there was no trace of a smile in his eyes. He said calmly, "General Cui, your words were incorrect. I'm not threatening you. I'm just having a discussion with you."

Cui Qi looked into Gu Zhou's cold eyes. He knew in his heart that Gu Zhou was asking him to agree obediently.

His legs had already been shot. If no one was supporting him, he wouldn't be able to stand up for the time being. He looked up at Gu Zhou. He hadn't expected Gu Zhou to investigate so thoroughly.

There were a total of 632 people in the Cui family. Gu Zhou's meaning was very simple. He wanted his entire family to be exterminated!

Cui Qi's chest heaved violently. He couldn't help but cough twice. He looked at Gu Zhou viciously, picked up a branch from the ground, and stood up in a sorry state.

Cui Qi looked at Gu Zhou in front of him and tried hard to remain cold. "W-What do you want to talk to me about?"

Gu Zhou stared at Cui Qi and said coldly, "Leave with your men now. That way, nothing will happen to your family. Otherwise…"

He paused for a moment and said lightly, "If your family accompanies you in the afterlife, you won't be alone."
