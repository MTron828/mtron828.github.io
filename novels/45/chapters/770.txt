771 Expressing Individuality

It was probably normal for her to dye Gu Qi’s hair green.

Qiao Nian hurriedly took out her phone and sent Lin Tao a WeChat message.

“Don’t corrupt Gu Qi. Don’t dye his hair!”

Soon, Qiao Nian received a WeChat message from Lin Tao. “Okay!”

After seeing the reply, Qiao Nian smiled and said to Xiao Shi, “Alright, I’ve already instructed her. She won’t dye Xiao Qi’s hair!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Xiao Shi heaved a sigh of relief.

Qiao Nian drove towards the Gu residence.

In the beginning, Xiao Shi looked around curiously. However, when she looked at the navigation map on Qiao Nian’s phone and realized that they were almost at the Gu residence, she couldn’t help but feel nervous.

When the red light turned red, Qiao Nian stopped the car.

She turned to look at Xiao Shi. Just as she was about to speak to him, she realized that Xiao Shi looked nervous and did not look well.

Qiao Nian smiled and reached out to hold Xiao Shi’s hand. She said softly, “Don’t be afraid. Your daddy will definitely like you very much!”

The warmth in Qiao Nian’s hand gradually calmed her restless heart. When she looked up at Qiao Nian, her eyes were slightly red.

“Auntie Nian Nian!” Xiao Shi called out excitedly.

“What’s wrong?” Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi in confusion, her expression as gentle as ever.

“Thank you for being willing to accept me!” Xiao Shi said gratefully. She had always lived at the bottom of Hai Cheng and knew all about deception.

She had a good friend called Xiao Yu. Xiao Yu’s mother was gone, and Xiao Yu’s father had found a new mother for Xiao Yu. Xiao Yu’s new mother would hit Xiao Yu every day, and she refused to let Xiao Yu go to school. She was also unwilling to buy clothes for Xiao Yu and did not feed him!

It was precisely because of this that she had a resistance to all her stepmothers. She felt that her stepmothers had ulterior motives.

If her brother hadn’t told her how Auntie Nian Nian was, she might have stayed away from her as well.

Moreover, she felt that she would definitely not resist Auntie Nian Nian.

Auntie Nian Nian was really too gentle. One couldn’t help but get close to her.

Just like now, she felt that Auntie Nian Nian seemed to be even gentler than Mommy.

If only her mommy could be like Auntie Nian Nian.

As soon as this thought appeared, a trace of guilt flashed across Xiao Shi’s face.

How could she let other aunties be her mommy? Mommy had worked so hard to give birth to her. Mommy was the person who treated her the best in this world. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Auntie Nian Nian, thank you for being willing to accept me!” Xiao Shi said sincerely. She knew that her father would marry Auntie Nian Nian in the future, and Auntie Nian Nian would be her mommy.

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, her heart skipped a beat. Xiao Shi was just a five-year-old child, but she was so sensible and knew how to be grateful.

However, in today’s society, such an obedient and adorable child would be easily bullied.

At this moment, the red light lit up.

Qiao Nian started the car again, but this time, she drove very slowly.

“Xiao Shi.”

“Yes?”

Looking at her current age, Qiao Nian could almost see herself back then. Back then, her life was also hit with bad luck and she wanted to get warmth from others.

But later on, she realized that some roads could only be walked by her, because no one would accompany her.

She didn’t want Xiao Shi to stay in the pit she had once stepped in.

“Xiao Cheng, you’re already the eldest daughter of the Gu family. Just lead a carefree childhood. Just like other children, don’t think about adults. You just have to do your best!”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment before continuing, “You should live freely, not put other people’s needs first!”

She didn’t want Xiao Shi to grow up with such an inferior personality. She hoped for Xiao Shi to be happier.

The heavens would always favor girls who liked to smile. She hoped that she would be blessed by the heavens .

Back then, no one had told her these things, which was why she had stepped into a huge pit. It was precisely because of this that she had learned these principles through bloody lessons. She hoped that she would not be trapped in the nightmares of the past like her .
