Chapter 213: Take a Bath With Me

Although the wind wasn’t cold this time of year, Gu Zhou’s body was relatively weak. It wasn’t suitable for him to be exposed to the wind for too long.

Chen Qing watched all of this with his mouth agape. His mouth was open wide enough to fit an egg.

In his lifetime, he had never expected to see Second Young Master acting like this with his own eyes.

If Second Young Master regained consciousness and recalled what had happened today, would he dig out Chen Qing’s eyes in a rage?

Chen Qing felt a chill run down his spine, and his body began to tremble involuntarily.

Qiao Nian helped Gu Zhou into the house. When they were inside, Gu Zhou looked down at the shirt he was wearing and brought his sleeve to his nose. He instantly frowned in disdain. “Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou is stinky!”

Qiao Nian: ...

To be honest, she was used to seeing Gu Zhou’s cold demeanor. Now that she was facing such an adorable, child-like Gu Zhou, she felt a little awkward. She asked tentatively, “Gu Zhou, can you speak like a normal person?”

Qiao Nian was just making a kind suggestion. However, Gu Zhou immediately pouted unhappily. His face filled with sadness, and tears welled up in his eyes. “Nian Nian, please don’t be fierce to Zhou Zhou?”

Qiao Nian felt as if she had been struck by lightning.

Oh my god!

Just strike her dead!

She really couldn’t understand why she had slapped Gu Zhou just now.

If she hadn’t hit Gu Zhou, Gu Zhou wouldn’t have become a three-year-old child!

If Gu Zhou hadn’t turned into a three-year-old child, he wouldn’t be acting cute in front of her! He wouldn’t be acting like a spoiled child right now!

Qiao Nian decided to surrender. She tried hard to put on a gentle smile. “Okay, okay, okay. You can speak however you want!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he instantly beamed with joy. “Nian Nian is the best!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qiao Nian forced a smile and turned to look at Chen Qing. “Is there a bathroom here? A bathtub?”

“Yes.” Chen Qing hurriedly nodded. To be honest, he was yearning to disappear, but he had a duty to stay by Gu Zhou’s side.

“Go fill the tub with hot water. He’ll have to take a bath later!” Qiao Nian instructed.

Chen Qing answered, “Yes, ma’am.” He hurriedly walked towards the bathroom.

Qiao Nian walked up to Gu Zhou and reached out to unbutton his suit jacket. She helped him take it off and removed the leaves in his hair, tossing them aside.

Gu Zhou stood obediently in front of Qiao Nian, looking at her with utmost seriousness. He asked uneasily, “Nian Nian, I want you to take the bath with me. Is that okay?”

Once again, Qiao Nian felt as if she had been struck by lightning. It was as though the lightning had burnt her into a crisp.

“Wh-what?” Qiao Nian accidentally bit her tongue.

“Nian Nian doesn’t like Zhou Zhou?” Gu Zhou lowered his head aggrievedly, looking especially sad. “Then Zhou Zhou can only bathe alone!”

Qiao Nian tried hard to remain calm. She looked at Gu Zhou and coaxed, “I’ll get Chen Qing to help you take a bath, okay?”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. He tilted his head and asked, “Why?”

Qiao Nian felt like she was trying to raise a child. She explained patiently, “Because you’re both boys. I’m a girl. It’s improper for men and women to touch each other.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou pursed his lips. “But I don’t like Chen Qing.”

Qiao Nian’s heart silently ached for Chen Qing for three seconds.

Gu Zhou lowered his head and thought for a long time. After mustering his courage, he said, “Then I’ll wash myself!”

Qiao Nian was truly thankful. She heaved a sigh of relief and said softly, “Alright. You’re so brave!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his lips curved up involuntarily.

“Come here.” Qiao Nian pulled Gu Zhou to a chair and sat down. She opened the medicine box and took out a box of silver needles. After disinfecting them, she brought the box of silver needles to Gu Zhou’s side and prepared to administer acupuncture to his head.

However, Gu Zhou dodged nimbly. His clear eyes were filled with hurt as he asked pitifully, “Nian Nian, did Zhou Zhou do something wrong? As long as Nian Nian says it, Zhou Zhou will listen to you and correct his mistakes.”
