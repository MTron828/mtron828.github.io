1345 Reminder

“I heard from Fourth Brother that you’re filming a period drama this time. Is it tiring?” Qiao Nian said politely, calmly sitting down opposite Song Yu.

“I like filming.” As Song Yu spoke, she handed the tablet to Qiao Nian. “Sister, what do you want to eat?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian ordered two dishes and handed the tablet back to Song Yu. “Is there anything you want to eat?”

Song Yu took the tablet and added two more dishes before submitting the order.

Qiao Nian couldn’t figure out why Song Yu had called her out. Just as she was thinking, she heard Song Yu speak.

“I heard that Sister and the three children are especially obedient and adorable. I like them so much when I look at photos. I wonder if I can visit the children at the Gu residence when I have time?”

“Of course. If you’re free today, you can visit too.” Qiao Nian smiled and said, “I still want to bring the children back to the Lu family this weekend.”

“I’m afraid we won’t have time today. The gifts I’ve prepared for the children haven’t arrived yet.” Song Yu smiled. Seeing that Qiao Nian’s cup was empty, she stood up and poured her a cup of water. In a low voice, she said, “I’m afraid I’m not the only one who likes these three children.”

When Qiao Nian heard Song Yu’s words, she vaguely felt that something was wrong, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.

Song Yu sat back down on the chair and looked at Qiao Nian with a smile. “Sister, are you planning to take care of the children yourself?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian had a nagging feeling that Song Yu was implying something.

Song Yu smiled and nodded. “It’s better to take care of the children yourself. I read a report a few days ago. I think a mother kept staring at her phone when she was taking her child out to play. She didn’t pay attention to her child, and her child was taken away. Her child hasn’t been found yet.”

Song Yu didn’t care about Qiao Nian’s dark expression. When the attendant entered, she warmly invited Qiao Nian to eat together.

Qiao Nian felt that Song Yu was acting a little strange today. In her impression, Song Yu treated everyone very well, but what Song Yu was saying to her made her uncomfortable.

After the meal, Song Yu took Qiao Nian’s arm and left. She opened the door and saw that there was no one else at the door. She lowered her voice and reminded her, “Keep an eye on the children. Even acquaintances might take them away.”

When Qiao Nian heard Song Yu’s words, her heart skipped a beat. She turned to look at Song Yu and saw her smiling at her like a flower. “Sister, it’s settled then. I’ll look for you to play with the children another day. I have something to do on set. I’ll go get busy first. Goodbye.”

As Song Yu spoke, she stepped forward and hugged Qiao Nian, gently patting her back. “Sister, be careful.”

“Yes, okay. You’re welcome to come and visit anytime.” Qiao Nian cooperated with Song Yu. After the two of them parted ways, they walked out chatting and laughing.

Song Yu got into the huge van and left. Qiao Nian sat back in her car, her eyes darkening. She turned the car key and drove home.

Could Song Yu have discovered some clues?

Perhaps that group of people had already targeted Song Yu, but Song Yu didn’t dare to text her directly to tell her about this. She could only remind her to be careful during dinner.

Qiao Nian drove to the entrance of the Gu family villa. She sat in the car and arranged for Qin Chuan’s men to take care of Song Yu before getting out.

She looked at her cell phone as she walked towards the living room. Just as she reached the living room, she saw Matriarch Gu sitting on the sofa, looking at a photo album.

“Grandma.” Smiling, Qiao Nian sat down beside Matriarch Gu. She glanced at the photo curiously and saw a photo of the three little ones.

“You’re back.” Matriarch Gu placed the photos of the three little ones into the photo album and looked at Qiao Nian gently.

“Yes, I had lunch with Song Yu at noon. She looks thinner than before. I heard that it’s to look good on camera.” Qiao Nian saw Matriarch Gu close the photo album and place it on the sofa.

“Yes, the thinner they are, the better.” Matriarch Gu slowly stood up and said to Qiao Nian, who was supporting her, “The weather is good today. Let’s go for a walk.”

Matriarch Gu walked very slowly. She looked at the grass and trees around her. With a faint smile in her eyes, she said, “In the past, the house was cold. Ever since you arrived, the house has become lively.”
