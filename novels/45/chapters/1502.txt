1503 Really Beautiful

Just as Qiao Nian was about to say something, she heard Gu Zhou say, “How about three days?”

Qiao Nian hadn’t reacted at first. When she realized that Gu Zhou was referring to the two of them having sex in bed for three days, her entire body turned red.

Pretending to be fierce, she glared at Gu Zhou, signaling him not to spout nonsense outside.

He suddenly smiled. His smile was as bright as the moon.

At this moment, Qiao Nian felt her heart skip a beat. She stared unblinkingly at him.

Her smile was really beautiful.

“This matter is pending. Let me think about it slowly.” Qiao Nian coughed and cleared her throat, pretending to be serious.

When Gu Zhou heard this, he nodded. “At the Queen’s command.”

Qiao Nian almost lost her balance. Fortunately, Gu Zhou was quick to support her. She looked up at Gu Zhou. For some reason, she felt that she had betrayed herself.

“Be careful.”

“I know.” Qiao Nian blushed and naturally took Gu Zhou’s arm.

…

After Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou returned home, Qiao Nian went straight to the medicinal room.

Not only were the renovation facilities of this house identical to the Lu family villa in An City, but even the facilities inside were the same. There was also a medical room. Qiao Nian went straight to work.

When Qiao Nian was young, she studied medicine with her grandfather. At that time, her only joy was cultivating plants. Even her grandfather said that she was talented in cultivating plants.

Although cultivating the Falling Autumn Grass was very difficult, the most difficult part was the ancient method used during the cultivation process. There could not be any mistakes during cultivation, and it had to be very careful.

Even though she knew how to cultivate the Falling Autumn Grass, she did not dare to let her guard down and continued to monitor it closely.

In the blink of an eye, it was the third day. When Qiao Nian saw that green shoots had already sprouted in the soil of the flower pot, her heart, which had been in her throat, finally relaxed.

The cultivation was successful!

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She stood up and walked out of the medicine room.

Chen Qing had been guarding the entrance of the medicine room. Seeing Qiao Nian come out, he heaved a sigh of relief and stepped forward. “Second Young Madam, Second Young Master is waiting for you in the bedroom.”

“I understand.” Qiao Nian nodded and walked towards the main building. As if she had thought of something, she continued, “Go and prepare the car. We’ll go to the palace now.”

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes lit up. He said respectfully, “Madam, Second Young Master has already prepared a car.”

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, Qiao Nian instructed him to keep an eye on the Falling Autumn Grass in the medicinal room. No one was allowed to enter.

Qiao Nian had been guarding the Falling Autumn Grass for the past three days, afraid that something would happen in between. Fortunately, everything had been resolved, so she wanted to go back and tidy up.

She went to the bedroom first and knocked on the door. Seeing that there was no response, she pressed the handle and pushed it open.

The moment she opened the bedroom door, the light inside was blinding. Qiao Nian subconsciously raised her hand to shield her eyes and narrowed her eyes.

After a while, her eyes adjusted to the glare.

There was no one in the room. From the bathroom came the sound of running water.

Qiao Nian walked towards the bathroom and knocked on the door.

“Come in.” Gu Zhou’s voice came from the bathroom.

Qiao Nian pushed open the bathroom door and entered. The bathroom was filled with mist.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Gu Zhou smiled at her and said softly, “Lift your leg.”

Puzzled, Qiao Nian obediently raised her left foot and saw Gu Zhou reaching out to take off her shoes.

She subconsciously retracted her foot, but Gu Zhou forcibly took off her shoes and socks.

“The other one.” Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian, his voice low.

Qiao Nian had no choice but to hand her other foot to Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou helped her take off her shoes and socks.

Her feet were bare on the carpet as she looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou bent down and picked her up in his arms, then walked in.

When they reached the bathtub, Gu Zhou put Qiao Nian down and said with a smile, “You can take a bath now.”

Qiao Nian was about to take off her clothes when she saw Gu Zhou standing there. Perhaps it was because of the steam in the bathroom, but her face was slightly red. She asked, “Aren’t you going out?”

“I’ll help you shower.”

Qiao Nian was speechless.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
