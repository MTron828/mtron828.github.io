722 Strange

Song Yu stood at the side. From the corner of her eye, she glanced at Lu Nian, who was standing not far away, her heart filled with confusion.

How odd.

Second Brother usually cared about his sister’s things the most.

Why didn’t Second Brother react when his sister’s urn was damaged this time? Second Brother didn’t blame her or flare up at her.

She still remembered that when she was in Second Brother’s piano room, she had only touched the stool that her sister had once sat on. Second Brother had flown into a rage.

In the past, Second Brother would have been furious before Third Brother could speak.

Second Brother would definitely not only attack Jiang Yue, but also ground her.

Could it be because Second Brother had fallen for Qiao Nian?

Second Brother wanted to appear gentler in front of Qiao Nian.

No, Second Brother had once said that the person he cared about the most was his sister.

What made Song Yu feel even stranger was that her brother was also very abnormal today.

In the past, Big Brother would definitely have gotten someone to attack Jiang Yue.

Today, not only was Big Brother not angry, but he also did not attack Jiang Yue, as if this matter had nothing to do with him.

Today, Big Brother and Second Brother had been looking at Qiao Nian.

It couldn’t be that both of them were in love with Qiao Nian!

If Big Brother and Second Brother both liked Qiao Nian, the atmosphere between the two of them shouldn’t be so harmonious. After all, when love rivals met, their eyes would turn red.

What had gone wrong? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Song Yu silently suppressed the doubts in her heart.

Lu Rao lit three incense sticks and stood in front of the memorial tablet of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. He bowed three times solemnly before inserting the incense sticks into the incense burner.

Lu Rao’s heart ached when he saw his sister’s urn corroded by sulfuric acid.

He was really useless. He didn’t even take good care of his sister’s urn.

If it weren’t for the anniversary of his sister’s death, he might have asked Jiang Yue to apologize to her personally.

It was precisely because today was his sister’s death anniversary that Lu Rao did not want to be ruthless in front of his sister. At the same time, he wanted to accumulate merit for his sister and wish her a happy reincarnation.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Rao’s sad back. She could feel his pain and sorrow.

At this moment, Lu Rao was completely different from the Lu Rao she had seen before.

When she first saw Lu Rao, he was like a suave young master, attracting everyone’s attention.

Whenever Qiao Nian thought about how the Lu family had been sad on her death anniversary every year for the past twenty years, she would have mixed feelings.

Seeing that Lu Rao was about to wipe the urn with his hand, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but say, “Don’t wipe it with your hand!”

When Lu Rao heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he turned to look at her, his eyes dim and confused.

When Qiao Nian met Lu Rao’s gaze, her heart ached slightly. Lu Rao’s energetic eyes had already lost their luster and were now dull.

Putting herself in Lu Rao’s shoes, if she were Lu Rao and something like this happened to her biological sister, she would not be in a good mood either.

Qiao Nian’s lips parted slightly. She had a thousand things to say to Lu Rao, but she couldn’t say a word.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Gu Zhou stood beside Qiao Nian. He could clearly sense Qiao Nian’s emotions, and he could tell what she was feeling from her eyes.

At this moment, Qiao Nian seemed to be restrained by something. She wanted to say something, but didn’t dare to.

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes slightly.

Previously, he had already realized that there was something wrong with Qiao Nian’s relationship with Lu Zhu and Lu Nian. Moreover, Qiao Nian was looking at Lu Rao the same way she was looking at Lu Zhu and Lu Nian.

Gu Zhou clearly realized that this gaze had nothing to do with love between men and women.

If he wasn’t wrong, Qiao Nian looked at Lu Rao as if she was looking at her family.

Gu Zhou glanced at Lu Zhu and Lu Nian. Seeing the two of them looking at Qiao Nian nervously, he had already guessed what was going on.

Previously, he just couldn’t believe his guess, but at this moment, he was completely sure.

At this moment, Lu Zhu and Lu Nian were also looking at Qiao Nian nervously. Their hearts were beating faster and faster, as if their hearts would jump out of their chests in the next moment.

This was the first time Lu Zhu was so nervous. His palms were covered in sweat, and his throat involuntarily moved. His frown deepened.
