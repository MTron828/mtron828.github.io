Chapter 1724 - 1724 Forced (2)

Wright met Lina’s gaze, his eyes filled with disdain. He let go of Lina’s chin. “Since you like to court death so much, fine. I’ll fulfill your wish. Don’t even think about asking your father to come and save you. He can’t even protect himself now.”

Lina sniffled and took a step back. “Are you threatening me?”

“How would I dare? My princess, I’m just reminding you that you’re just a little chick that can be slaughtered by anyone. Why? Do you still want to turn the world upside down? Who do you think you are?” Wright completely ignored Lina’s pain and said sarcastically, “Stop crying. Your tears are worthless to me.”

Actually, Wright originally liked Lina’s beautiful face a lot, but Lina and Qiao Nian repeatedly disrupted his plans and embarrassed him at the engagement banquet. He no longer had eyes for Lina.

He only wanted to have sex with Lina just to tarnish her and take revenge on the president and Chen Qing.

Lina looked weak and easy to bully in front of him. If he didn’t bully Lina, who would he bully?

Wright grabbed Lina’s hand and threw her onto the bed.

Lina lay on the bed in a sorry state. She looked at Wright angrily. “Are you crazy?”

Wright unbuttoned his shirt slowly and looked at Lina calmly. “I’m crazy? Lina, you’re wrong. I just see the reality clearly. You’re just my plaything now. Why? Do you still think you’re a high and mighty princess?”

Plaything?

Lina pursed her lips. Tears welled up in her eyes.

Wright had used this word to describe her. Although it was unpleasant to the ear, she seemed to have lost her choice from the moment she agreed to marry Wright.

But this didn’t mean that she was a plaything.

She had her own identity. Even if she wasn’t a princess, she was definitely not a plaything.

Moreover, she was born a princess!

“How dare you!” Lina stood up again and looked at Wright coldly. She raised her hand and slapped Wright hard, her tone low. “Who do you think you are? You’re just a dog!”

“Bang!”

Once again, Lina was pushed violently onto the bed by Wright. She looked stubbornly at Wright.

In a rage, Wright tried to hit Lina, but a female voice stopped him.

Wright looked over and saw Via standing at the door. She was holding a kitchen knife and walking in shakily. “Stay away from the Seventh Princess. You’re not allowed to use violence against her.”

Seeing Via enter, Lina’s eyes were filled with worry. She hurriedly said, “Via, leave quickly. Don’t come over!”

Lina wanted to use the knife to threaten Wright before he arrived, but she had already lost the initiative. They definitely couldn’t use the knife to deal with Wright anymore.

Moreover, Wright had brought more than ten burly men with him this time. She had never even practiced what to do with Via before. How could she be their match?

If only she could fly over roofs and walk on walls like Nian Nian and casually defeat many people.

She was indeed the noble Seventh Princess, but in such a dangerous situation, her identity was useless. She could not protect herself or her friends.

If only she had known Nian Nian in the past. That way, she could learn martial arts from her and not have to be afraid of Wright.

As Lina thought about this, she felt more and more useless. She couldn’t even take good care of herself.

She looked at Via not far away and said loudly, “This is an order. Leave quickly!”

Seeing that Via had not left, Lina immediately said loudly, “Hurry!”

“Seventh Princess!” Via looked at Lina worriedly, her voice trembling.

Wright took off his shirt and glanced at the guards he had brought in from the corner of his eye.

Two of the guards walked up to Via, snatched her knife away, and held her up.

Lina’s heart sank to the bottom. She looked worriedly at Via, who was not far away.

Wright took out the gun from his waist and loaded it slowly.
