Chapter 1542 Rain

Lina came back to her senses and saw Chen Qing's meticulous and serious expression. She realized that Chen Qing seemed to have the same expression these past few days. Could it be that Chen Qing had been in trouble recently?

She knew that even if she asked, Chen Qing would not tell her, so she nodded and followed Chen Qing to find a suitable path.

At first, walking up Cliff Mountain was still alright. Holding a climbing stick, Chen Qing cleared the weeds in front of him and finally created a small path.

Later on, the route became steeper. Lina climbed up. There was a flat piece of land above, and she could circle to the back of the mountain through the forest.

Lina held the topographic map of the cliff mountain in her hand. As she looked at the route, she compared it to the photos of the Colorful Fungus and Flowing Tree.

According to Nian Nian, under normal circumstances, Colorful Fungus grew beside the trunk of a Flowing Tree. Therefore, as long as one found the Flowing Tree, it was very likely that they would find Colorful Fungus.

Lina focused on finding the Flowing Tree. Chen Qing was in charge of clearing the obstacles in front.

Cliff Mountain was really filled with birdsong and the fragrance of flowers and soil.

At some point in time, the wind had gradually grown stronger. The branches were rustling, and even the grass could not stand up.

Lina rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand. Only then did she notice that the sky had darkened. She looked up and could only see lush leaves. The leaves had already blocked most of the sky.

She glanced at the time on her wrist. It was already one in the afternoon. She invited Chen Qing for lunch.

She sat down beside Chen Qing and saw that his pants were torn. Just as she was about to speak, she heard Chen Qing say, "Seventh Princess, we have to speed up. We've only walked a third of the way."

"You…" As Lina spoke, her gaze fell on the back of Chen Qing's hand. She saw that it was already bleeding. "You're injured."

As she spoke, Lina subconsciously held Chen Qing's hand.

"I'm fine." As Chen Qing spoke, he retracted his hand calmly and narrowed his eyes, looking into the distance.

Lina looked at Chen Qing's hand and slowly lowered her gaze. She stopped talking and ate silently.

After dinner, the two of them continued walking in.

The deeper they went, the lusher the trees became.

After walking for an unknown period of time, suddenly, thunder rumbled in the sky.

Lina frowned. Was it going to rain?

No sooner had this thought occurred to her than the rain began to fall in sheets, followed by an even louder clap of thunder. The rain grew heavier.

Lina hurriedly put the things in her hand into the waterproof bag.

Chen Qing looked around. He swiftly climbed onto a two-meter-tall rock and stood on it to look around.

Dark clouds pressed down on them. All they could see was desolation.

Chen Qing took the opportunity to pluck the banana leaf. The banana leaf was big and could block the rain.

He jumped down from above and handed Lina a banana leaf, keeping one for himself. "Seventh Princess, do you plan to continue searching, or find a place to hide from the rain?"

Lina's hair was already drenched, sticking to her scalp and face. Her eyes were extremely clear, like the sky after rain. "Continue searching."

Everything she was doing now was for her mother's sake. It was just a little rain. How could she back down?

Her mother had been ill for more than twenty years. She sincerely hoped that her mother would recover soon. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, she understood that her father did not want her mother to go to Country Z. If she could find Colorful Fungus on Cliff Mountain, her father would not have to worry.

"Okay," Chen Qing replied. Then, he continued to clear the way in the rain.

The sky grew darker and darker. Lina could only use her flashlight to illuminate the area ahead.

Time passed bit by bit, and the sky grew darker and darker.

The rain poured down, causing the leaves and branches to crack. It was like setting off firecrackers. It was so noisy that even Chen Qing and Lina, who were only a meter away, had to speak loudly.

Lina gripped the flashlight tightly and stared carefully at her surroundings. The visibility of the flashlight was too low. She could only see about a meter away. She could only keep bending down.

Time passed bit by bit. The rain pattered on the ground. Lina straightened up and accidentally slipped.

"Ah!"

Lina screamed in fear.
