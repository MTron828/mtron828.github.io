Chapter 1832 - 1832: Pinky swear

Translator: Atlas Studios    Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou noticed that Xiao Shi’s expression was not good. He lowered his head slightly and whispered into her ear.

Xiao Shi’s frown instantly disappeared. Her eyes curved into crescents of joy, and her lips curved up slightly. “Yes, if that’s the case, I’ll agree on Mommys behalf now! ”

With that, Xiao Shi extended her little finger to Gu Zhou and said with a smile, “Daddy, pinky swear.”

Gu Zhou reached out his hand dotingly and hooked Xiao Shi’s little finger with his. It was a loving sight.

Xiao Shi said happily, “Daddy, since we’ve already made a pinky promise, you have to keep your word.”

“Of course.” Gu Zhou smiled and agreed.

Qiao Nian watched the two of them interact. Curious, she moved closer to Xiao Shi and asked softly, “Xiao Shi, can you tell Mommy what you just said to Daddy?”

Xiao Shi smiled and leaned into Gu Zhou’s arms. Her eyes were filled with laughter, and she looked mysterious. “Mommy, I can’t tell you about this because I’ve already promised Daddy that I would keep it a secret.”

At the side, Xiao Bao and Gu Qi were also very curious about what had just happened. Gu Qi was usually calm. He only looked at Xiao Shi curiously, but Xiao Bao was different.

Xiao Bao had a straightforward personality and couldn’t help but ask directly,

“Sister, you actually have a secret with Dad. Then can you tell Second Brother? Second Brother promises that he won’t tell anyone else.”

Gu Qi looked at Xiao Shi with sparkling eyes.

Xiao Shi thought for a moment and hurriedly said, “Alright, I’ll tell Brother and Second Brother later, but we can’t let Mommy know about this. Can you promise me that?”

Gu Qi and Xiao Bao hurriedly nodded.

At this moment, Qiao Nian finally understood. Other than her, no one else could know this secret.

She looked sharply at Gu Zhou beside her and raised her eyebrows slightly. “l really didn’t expect you to form a gang on the first day we got home. Hurry up and tell me. What’s the secret between the two of you?”

Seeing that Xiao Shi wanted to sit on a stool at the side, Gu Zhou calmly placed her on it. His voice was cold. “Why don’t you think about the question 1 asked you today? You’ll know what I told them tonight.”

What Gu Zhou didn’t say was that Qiao Nian t s answer tonight had to be satisfactory to him.

One by one, the others sat down at the table.

Matriarch Lu was sitting at the front. She was wearing a red Tang outfit and exuded a gentle and loving aura.

Next to Matriarch Lu was Lu You. He was wearing a black shirt and a dark red tie today, giving off a calm and refined aura.

Su Yan sat next to Lu You. Her crescent-white cheongsam outlined her perfect figure. Her hair was tied up behind her head with a jade hairpin. She was as gentle as water, making one involuntarily take a few more glances.

Her gaze swept across the children on the table, then lingered on Qiao Nian’s face for a while longer.

Qiao Nian sensed Su Yan’s gaze and looked up. She met Su Yan’s worried gaze and felt a little uncomfortable.

To her mother, finding her daughter, who had been missing for more than twenty years, was a happy thing. However, their family had not been together for long before she went to Europe because of the kidnapping more than twenty years ago. Her mother did not have time to enjoy family life with her.

Her mother had probably been on tenterhooks during the time she was in Europe,VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart was filled with guilt and heartache. She looked up at Su Yan and said in a low voice, “Mom, I’m really sorry.” Su Yan was slightly stunned when she heard Qiao Nian’s words.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze and said guiltily, “I’m sorry. My trip to Europe made you all very worried. Did you not rest well? Actually, I…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Su Yan laughed. She grabbed Qiao Nian t s hand, her eyes filled with love. She said softly, “Silly child, you shouldn’t apologize at a time like this.”

When Su Yan said this, she felt a little sad. Qiao Nian must have had a hard time all these years, which was why she was so sensitive..
