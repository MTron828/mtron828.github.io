Chapter 1557 I admit defeat

Cui Qi and his subordinates were all disarmed and tied up.

Cui Qi had been shot three times. He looked at the special forces soldiers in disbelief, his frown deepening.

No, he had clearly controlled Gu Zhou's people at the foot of the mountain. Why were there still others?

What terrified Cui Qi the most was that although there were only six helicopters, these were not ordinary helicopters. These helicopters were equipped with weapons and a single helicopter could raze an entire mountain to the ground.

Qiao Nian looked at the leader's Western face. She hadn't expected him to be so good at Chinese.

It seemed that these people were all Gu Zhou's most secret S-rank mercenaries in Europe. Her heart, which had been in her throat, finally settled back down.

Gu Zhou was really smart. He had actually predicted everything.

Gu Zhou looked at Cui Qi, who was tightly tied up. He slowly looked at the gun in his hand, then loaded it. He glanced at Cui Qi coldly and said, "General Cui, I really didn't expect you to be so stupid as to go all the way."

Seeing that his people had already been taken away, the light in Cui Qi's eyes gradually disappeared. He looked into the distance blankly.

Not only had his mission failed, but he had also lost his elites.

If he had left with his subordinates previously, would the current problem not have happened?

Cui Qi pursed his lips tightly and looked at Gu Zhou. He could maintain his general posture and fight Gu Zhou at all costs, but his actions were futile.

Cui Qi took a deep breath, as if he had understood something. He looked at Gu Zhou and said, "I hope you'll let my family off."

Gu Zhou's cold gaze fell on Cui Qi's face again. He raised his eyebrows slightly and said, "General Cui, it's not that I won't let you off now, but that your superiors won't let them off."

When Cui Qi heard Gu Zhou's words, his expression changed drastically. He lowered his head in vain. What else could he say?

Right at this moment, orderly footsteps came from afar. There were about a thousand people.

Cui Qi looked at those people and looked up again. If only they had arrived earlier. Then, they would have taken down Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian long ago.

However, Cui Qi looked at those people. He looked up at Gu Zhou and said, "Second Young Master Gu, why don't we discuss it again?"

The thousand-odd people all aimed their weapons at Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian, and the others. The leader beside Gu Zhou raised his hand, and the people around him surrounded Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, each holding a submachine gun.

The helicopter, which had been observing the situation in midair, immediately switched to combat mode.

"Discuss?" Gu Zhou smiled disdainfully and asked, "Do you think there's a need to have a discussion now?"

When Cui Qi heard Gu Zhou's words, he was about to speak when he saw the mercenary leader, who had been standing beside Gu Zhou, take out his walkie-talkie. "Intimidate."

As soon as the mercenary leader finished speaking, a silver light streaked across the sky. Then, the ground shook, and everyone lost their balance.

The soldiers who had just rushed over from Cui Qi's side were sent flying to the ground. They got up from the ground covered in injuries.

Cui Qi knelt on the ground and looked at the soldiers with heartache. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Those soldiers had followed him everywhere. He still wanted everyone to retire safely.

Cui Qi's eyes turned even redder. He looked at Gu Zhou angrily, as if he wanted to cut Gu Zhou into pieces.

"General Cui, you don't have a chance to discuss this now," Gu Zhou said. He glanced at the soldier not far away. "You don't care about your family, but you care about your soldiers."

Cui Qi pursed his lips tightly. No matter how many soldiers he had, how could he defeat a helicopter flying in the sky?

This war was not on equal footing to begin with. He had just naively thought that he could negotiate with Gu Zhou.

He sighed helplessly and lowered his head slightly. Reluctantly, he had no choice but to admit defeat. "I admit defeat!"

Gu Zhou knew that Cui Qi was a stubborn person. He would not surrender until the last critical moment.

Now that Cui Qi had surrendered, he glanced at Cui Qi's soldiers and frowned slightly.
