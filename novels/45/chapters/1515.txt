1516 Eating Soil

Qiao Nian nodded slightly and said seriously, “Not only can the Teng Yang Flower cause hallucinations, but it’s also nourishment for Hypnotic worms.”

“Many Hypnotic worms like the poison of the Teng Yang Flower.” Seeing the blood drain from Annie’s face, Qiao Nian knew that her guess was right. “I really didn’t expect Earl Mark’s castle to have so many good things!”

“Qiao Nian, I’m warning you. Don’t lie to the public here. It’s impossible for me to have a Hypnotic worm in my home. I don’t know what you’re talking about. Get out of here now. I don’t want to see you again! I’m a princess. You have to listen to me!” Annie pointed in the direction of the palace door and said loudly.

“You don’t know about the Teng Yang Flower?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and glanced at the soil in her hand. “How about this? Take a bite and I’ll believe you. Do you really know that there’s no Teng Yang Flower here?”

“You’re too presumptuous. I’m the princess of Europe. Why should I eat dirt!” Annie’s face was red with anger. She no longer wanted to confront Qiao Nian. Just as she was about to turn around and leave, she was stopped by the servants.

Qiao Nian gave Chen Qing a look. Chen Qing kicked Annie in the knee.

Annie lost her balance and fell to her knees.

Chen Qing tied Annie’s hands behind her back. He was not from Europe, and he would not be as polite to Annie as other foreigners.

Annie’s hair was in a mess. She looked at Qiao Nian, who was getting closer and closer to her, with a ferocious expression. She shouted, “You b*tch, get lost quickly. I don’t want to see you!”

Chen Qing naturally dislocated Annie’s hands. Annie knelt on the ground in a sorry state. Her arms were already dislocated. She screamed in pain, her miserable voice echoing throughout the palace.

Qiao Nian stood in front of Annie. Her gaze fell on Annie’s face and she smiled. “Didn’t you say that there’s nothing wrong with this soil? Since there’s no problem, why don’t you dare to eat it? If you dare to eat it, it proves that what you said is true. Then I’m willing to apologize to you and let you do whatever you want with it. How about that?”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian had already handed a speck of soil to Annie.

“No, I won’t eat it. I won’t eat it!” Annie shouted in fear and unease, desperately moving back, as if Qiao Nian wasn’t holding soil in her hand, but a ferocious beast.

Annie knew very well that the juice of the Teng Yang Flower was highly poisonous. If she smelled it, she might fall into an illusion, but if she ate it, she would immediately die! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In Annie’s opinion, nothing was more important than her life!

The president, who was being supported by Lina, slowly stood up straight. If what Qiao Nian had said previously was just a theory, then all of Annie’s actions proved that Qiao Nian was right!

The president slowly pushed Lina’s hand away and walked towards Annie. He walked up to her and looked down at her.

When his father was still around, he had a good relationship with his eldest brother’s family. In the past, when he went to his eldest brother’s house, he often hugged Annie.

That innocent and adorable child back then had already become very vicious.

The president trembled with anger. He looked at Annie in disappointment and slapped her hard. “Who gave you the guts? How can you do this?”

Every word the president said came out as if through gritted teeth. He tried hard to control himself from strangling Anne immediately.

She had never expected her father’s good plan to be seen through by a woman.

When Annie heard the President’s words, her body trembled uncontrollably. She said fearfully, “Uncle, you can’t do this to me. I’m my father’s only daughter!”

“If he comes, I won’t let him off!” The president’s voice was loud and clear, like a hammer smashing into the hearts of everyone present, making them panic!
