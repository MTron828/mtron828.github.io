Mark's gaze fell on the framed photograph on the floor.

In the frame was a photo of Annie riding on a servant. In the photo, Annie was smiling innocently, as if she could illuminate the entire world.

Mark stared unblinkingly at the photo frame. In a daze, he recalled how Annie had looked when she was young, wearing a princess dress and a crown. At that time, Annie really looked like his grandmother.

The butler followed Mark's gaze and saw that he had been staring at the broken photo frame on the ground.

Something so big had happened to Princess Annie, and she had embarrassed the Earl completely.

The Earl was the greatest Earl in their European country in the past hundred years. Princess Annie was the only black spot on the Earl's resume.

The butler stole a glance at Mark. Seeing his dark expression, he glared fiercely at the servant in front of him.

This servant couldn't even do a small thing well. She should be fired as soon as possible.

The butler looked at Mark in fear and swallowed nervously. He walked towards Mark and hurriedly said, "Lord Earl, I'll pack these things now. I won't…"

However, just as he reached Mark's side, he was pushed aside by Mark and fell to the ground in a sorry state. He did not dare to speak and looked at Mark not far away in fear.

Wright noticed Mark's abnormality and walked over to him. He saw Mark bend down and pick up the photo frame with Annie's photo.

A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.

Mark stared unblinkingly at the photo. His fingers gently caressed Annie's bright smile. His hands were covered in glass shards, and blood dripped to the ground.

Wright narrowed his eyes slightly, hiding the complicated emotions in them.

Strange.

What was wrong with his father?

In the past, his father cared about him far more than his biological daughter, Annie.

When he went to court today, his father was calm and even talked to him about the future development of Europe. Even when Annie admitted to murdering Madam President and assassinating Seventh Princess Lina, his father was expressionless.

Even though their father had seen Qiao Nian when they came out of the court, he seemed to be very interested in her.

It was at that time that he felt that his father didn't care about Annie at all.

That made sense. He had been by his father's side since he was a child. He had been with him much longer than Annie.

Although he had always been by his father's side, he still couldn't tell what his father was thinking.

But at this moment, he realized that his father still cared a lot about Annie. He recalled how Annie had risked everything to take the blame in court.

Although he didn't usually like Annie, he was still frightened by her madness. There was only one thought in his mind. Annie would really die to protect his father.

If he was close to Annie, would she protect him like this?

Even though their relationship was usually cold, at that moment, he was still moved.

Wright moved slightly closer to his father and said in a low voice, "Father, when we succeed, we can bring Annie home."

His gaze fell on his father's face. His father was still engrossed in the photograph of Annie, as if she were his entire world.

At this moment, someone hurriedly walked in.

The man noticed that Mark was in a bad mood. He just stared unblinkingly at Wright, as if he wanted to speak to him alone.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wright walked towards the person. The person whispered in Wright's ear.

Wright's body trembled slightly, his pupils constricted, and his eyes were filled with surprise.

At this moment, Mark was staring at Wright's face and taking in his expression. His voice was calm and indifferent. "What's going on with Annie again?"

When Wright heard Mark's words, he looked at Mark in disbelief. When he was talking to his father just now, his father seemed unwilling to say anything, but now his father had taken the initiative to speak.

"H-How did you know that it was Annie who sent the news?" Wright frowned slightly.

"Let me ask you again, what happened to Annie!" Mark's voice was suddenly raised. His voice was as cold as ice, scaring everyone present except Wright to kneel on the ground.
