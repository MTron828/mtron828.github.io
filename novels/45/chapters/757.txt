758 Want to See Mommy

“Mommy is doing very well now. I came to An City this time to look for Grandpa and Grandma. When I find them, I can bring Mommy over!” Xiao Shi sat there obediently and gave a sweet smile.

“Why didn’t Mommy come with you this time?” Gu Qi was still very vigilant. In his opinion, it was very dangerous for a child to go out alone.

He was not sure if his younger brother would encounter bad people and be bullied by them.

“Mommy still has something to do at home and can’t come yet.” Xiao Shi didn’t mention that her mommy was sick. She didn’t want Brother Xiao Qi to worry about her, and it wouldn’t be long before her mommy came to An City. “Brother Xiao Qi, where have you been all these years? My mommy has been looking for you too. Mommy often says that she misses you, and I’ve always missed Brother!”

!!

Gu Qi’s heart skipped a beat, and his eyes lit up.

Xiao Shi’s words were like a beam of light, illuminating Gu Qi’s lonely and dark heart.

He had always thought that his mommy didn’t want him.

Gu Qi hesitated for a moment and asked again, “Are you looking for me?”

Xiao Shi nodded vigorously, sniffled, and said with a sobbing tone, “Sometimes, I’ll be woken up by Mommy’s cries in the middle of the night. When I ask Mommy, she says that she’s thinking about you. Mommy and I searched all over Hai Cheng, but we couldn’t find Brother Xiao Qi.”

“Back then, I asked Mommy why Brother wasn’t around. Mommy said that after she gave birth to us, she was really too tired and fainted. She didn’t know who took Brother Xiao Qi away!”

At this point, Xiao Shi lowered her head guiltily. “It’s just that we’re too poor. If we had money, we could post more missing persons posters. That way, Brother Xiao Qi and I could meet sooner!”

Gu Qi’s uneasy heart gradually calmed down.

He was not a child abandoned by his mommy.

His mommy was also alive in this world.

His mommy had been thinking about him in another place.

He was also someone who had his mommy’s love.

Gu Qi tried hard to suppress the emotions in his heart and hurriedly asked, “Is Mommy in Hai Cheng now? How is she doing now? I heard that life will be very difficult without money.”

Xiao Shi hesitated for a moment. She didn’t want Brother Xiao Qi to worry about Mommy’s condition. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Brother Xiao Qi, don’t worry. I’ve been taking good care of Mommy during this period of time. Mommy misses you very much.”

Gu Qi couldn’t wait to see his mommy. He asked, “Xiao Cheng, can we go look for Mommy now? I want to see her and bring her back now!”

“Brother Xiao Qi, I just told you that we have to find Grandpa and Grandma first. Then, we’ll bring Grandpa and Grandma to pick her up. At that time, Mommy will definitely be happier when she sees Grandpa, Grandma and Brother!” she said like a little adult.

Gu Qi thought for a while and finally nodded.

She was right.

If he went to find Mommy with his grandparents, Mommy would definitely be happier.

Xiao Shi retracted her hand slightly and placed her hands on her knees. She grabbed her pants uneasily. “Brother Xiao Qi, is Daddy in An City now?”

Her words pulled Gu Qi back from the joy of seeing his mommy.

Only then did Gu Qi realize that his father had never mentioned about Xiao Shi to him since he was young.

Was it because her father had never known about Xiao Shi, or because he didn’t like her?

Gu Qi was very worried. If he brought his younger brother to his father now, what if his father was unhappy and frightened his younger brother?

It seemed that he had to probe in advance.

“Xiao Shi, I want to give Dad a surprise too!” Gu Qi looked at Xiao Xian happily and asked, “What do you think?”

Xiao Shi’s eyes lit up. She nodded vigorously.

“It’s getting late. Are you hungry? Why don’t we go eat first, then discuss how to surprise Dad?” Gu Qi coaxed her like he was coaxing a child.
