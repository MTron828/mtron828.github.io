Chapter 1760 - 1760 Waiting patiently

Qiao Nian’s expression gradually turned serious. It seemed like they had to plan Lina’s wedding well.

The president lowered his eyes slightly. He sat calmly on the sofa and said nothing.

In fact, part of his nervousness just now was because he was cooperating with the show. Another part was because he was really worried about Lina. As a father, he was worried about his daughter.

The President thought of Lina’s state just now and frowned. His voice was low. “Lina looks awful.”

Could it be that Mark had tortured Lina?

Otherwise, why would Lina become like that?

When Qiao Nian heard the president’s words, she thought of Lina just now, her eyes filled with self-reproach.

She knew that Lina was extremely afraid of Mark. Although Lina had already mustered up her courage to overcome her fear, this kind of thing could not be done overnight.

“Actually, when I went to Mark’s Castle, I could have gone alone. Lina was worried about my safety. She was afraid that I won’t have enough status and would be killed of Mark catches me. That’s why she asked to follow me.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. It was precisely because of her identity as the princess of Europe that Lina could escape death from Mark through a marriage alliance.

Lina must have thought about all of this before and pushed her out of the window.

Qiao Nian looked at the President with a firm gaze and a serious expression. “President, don’t worry about the rest. When you let Wright go, I’ll follow him to Mark’s manor and help him treat his injuries.”

This time, she would never let go of Lina’s hand again, nor would she let Lina suffer any harm.

When the President heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of surprise flashed across his eyes. He asked in confusion, “You still want to go to Mark’s manor?”

After asking, he subconsciously looked at Gu Zhou, who was sitting beside Qiao Nian. Gu Zhou’s expression was calm, as if he had no intention of stopping Qiao Nian.

One had to know that Mark Manor was definitely filled with danger. He was now in control of Lina’s life and death. If Qiao Nian went over, she might also be bullied by Mark.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian dotingly. He knew very well that Qiao Nian would definitely not change her decision based on her rational judgment. He also believed that Qiao Nian could protect herself.

Qiao Nian smiled at the President in front of her and said, “Now that we’ve agreed to Mark’s suggestion, he should be preparing for the wedding now. He probably won’t have time to look for us again. Besides, she needs a bridesmaid for the wedding.”

Qiao Nian was very grateful to the President for thinking for her.

Just as she finished speaking, a male voice sounded from the side. “The Seventh Princess still needs a personal bodyguard.”

Chen Qing stood at the side, his dark eyes filled with anger. He pursed his lips tightly, as if he wanted to go over even if no one agreed.

The President looked at Qiao Nian and Chen Qing’s determined eyes and finally nodded. “Alright, when you get there, you have to be extremely careful. If there’s danger, withdraw first.”

The president knew in his heart that Mark would not kill Lina, but he might not show mercy to Qiao Nian and Chen Qing.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The three of them left and went straight to a nearby hotel.

Gu Zhou sat in the back of the car and supported his head with one hand as he looked at the scenery outside. His long and narrow eyes were slightly lowered, and his eyelashes covered his eyes.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s troubled expression and reached out to hold his hand. She said softly, “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.”

“Yes.” Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand and turned to look at her. “Is there any news from them?”

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou was asking about Brother Gu and Eldest Senior Brother. She shook her head gently and said in a low voice, “They haven’t contacted me yet. Let’s wait patiently.”

Qiao Nian didn’t dare to take the initiative to send them a message, afraid that she would accidentally expose her brother and senior brother’s identities.

Gu Zhou frowned and said in a low voice, “We’re already prepared here. I wonder how things are going on their side. This is our only chance.”
