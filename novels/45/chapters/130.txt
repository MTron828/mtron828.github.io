Chapter 131 Investigation

Qiao Nian opened her eyes. Her gaze was now tinged with coldness. She said icily, “Mom, if there’s anything, just tell me over the phone!”

Su Xue’s voice was filled with anger. “You utter wretch! I’m ordering you to go home right this instant! If it weren’t for you, your sister wouldn’t have been humiliated!”

Although Qiao Nian kept the phone pressed to her ear, Su Xue’s voice was so loud that it was as though Qiao Nian had put the phone on speaker. Su Xue’s hysterical roar reverberated around the entire car.

Chen Qing’s grip on the steering wheel tightened involuntarily. He stared straight ahead, silently committing Su Xue’s every word to memory. Qiao Nian gripped her phone tightly, her eyes gradually turning colder. She noticed that Su Xue had used the words “go home” instead of “come home”. Her eyes flickered. “Since you’re not at home, why should I go back?” With that, Qiao Nian hurriedly opened WeChat and sent a text to Old A.

(Please get me the location of the person who’s currently speaking to me on the phone. I’ll need it now.)

Su Xue was clearly gritting her teeth as she spoke. “Are you sure you have the time to ask me where I am? Let me tell you, if you don’t apologize to your sister with enough sincerity, I will never forgive you! I will never let you off the hook, you wretched girl!”

Chen Qing’s frown deepened. He was going to tell Second Young Master Gu everything he had heard, word for word.

Qiao Nian’s expression didn’t change. She was already used to Su Xue’s insults. If she cared about what Su Xue said, she would just end up in a bad mood. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

In fact, Qiao Nian had no desire to continue talking with a lunatic like Su Xue. However, in order to buy time, she continued speaking. “Apologize? Why should I apologize to her? She’s the one who should apologize to me!” “You… you’re a beast!” Su Xue was livid.

“If I’m a beast, then you must be a beast as well. Sometimes, I even wonder if I’m your biological daughter. Otherwise, why would you treat me as your enemy?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, her heart skipped a beat. With a tinge of guilt in her voice, she cursed, “You wretched girl! Aren’t you getting too big for your boots? You aren’t even taking us to be your parents!”

Qiao Nian continued staring at her WeChat. Right then, a notification appeared. She opened the message and saw that she had just received Su Xue’s current location.

“I think my suspicions are well-founded. Why don’t we do a paternity test some other day?” Qiao Nian said, sarcasm dripping from her words.

“I’m very disappointed in you. When you get home, I’ll definitely teach you a lesson!”

With that, Su Xue hung up without hesitation.

Sitting in the back seat of the car, Qiao Nian turned to look out of the window, her eyes narrowing slightly.

In the past, she had always thought that she was her parents’ biological daughter, and that they had only treated her the way they did because they didn’t like her. But now, she was a little unsure.

Because Su Xue had panicked.

Although Qiao Nian hadn’t grown up with Su Xue, Su Xue had always been calm and composed when Qiao Nian had seen her. This was the first time she had seen Su Xue panic. “Chen Qing, send me to Feng Yun Gym!” “Yes, ma’am.”

Chen Qing turned on the GPS. Feng Yun Gym was not far away. They arrived in ten minutes.

From the car, Qiao Nian looked at the words on the building: Feng Yun Gym. Her beautiful eyes narrowed dangerously.

In fact, Qiao Nian hadn’t decided to seek out Su Xue on a whim. Previously, because of the Suranne Grass incident, she had ordered people to keep an eye on Su Xue and Qiao Xin. What puzzled her was that Su Xue often visited this gymnasium.

From the impression Qiao Nian had of Su Xue, Su Xue wasn’t someone who liked to work out.

Qiao Nian gripped her bag tightly. She wanted to see what Su Xue was doing in the gymnasium.

“Wait for me in the car.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Qiao Nian got out of the car and walked into the gymnasium. Immediately, a fitness instructor bulging with muscles came up to greet her warmly, inviting her to apply for a membership.

“I’m sorry, I’m not here to work out. I’m here to look for someone.” Qiao Nian smiled. Her voice was gentle, like springtime sunshine.
