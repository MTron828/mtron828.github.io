1041 Taking Action

The more Qiao Xin thought about it, the more excited she became. She continued, “When that happens, everyone in the world will know what kind of person Qiao Nian is. If only we could start a live broadcast. That would be even more exciting.”

Qiao Xin’s mind was filled with thoughts of how miserable Qiao Nian could be. As long as Qiao Nian was in trouble, she would be in a good mood.

He Cheng was driving. When he heard Qiao Xin’s words, his eyes were filled with smugness. Fourth Master Lu had made it very clear that he would treat Qiao Xin the same way Qiao Xin planned to treat Qiao Nian.

He really hadn’t expected Qiao Xin to have so many thoughts in her mind.

He smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll have fun first. I’ll let those people have fun later!”

“Sure. If she takes that medicine, she’ll be a loose bitch. She’ll definitely beg you. When the time comes, you can play with her however you want!” Just the thought of Qiao Nian kneeling on the ground and begging He Cheng like a dog made Qiao Xin laugh. As she laughed, her head grew heavier and heavier. She leaned back in the front passenger seat and said, “How strange. I don’t know what’s wrong with my head, but I’m a little dizzy.”

After Qiao Xin finished speaking, she realized that He Cheng wasn’t driving her home. She asked weakly, “Where are we going?”

“To my house, of course!” As He Cheng spoke, he stopped the car and carried Qiao Xin out of the car, who had collapsed into a ball. He walked towards the elevator.

“Let go of me!” Qiao Xin sensed that something was wrong with He Cheng and struggled to escape.

“I advise you not to move around. Otherwise, I’ll do you in the elevator!” He Cheng gave a lewd smile and looked at Qiao Xin lecherously, as if he could strip Qiao Xin of her clothes with just his gaze.

Qiao Xin’s head felt heavier and heavier. She wanted to jump down, but she heard He Cheng speak again.

“You’re not a good person either. You keep talking about things between men and women. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely serve you well!” He Cheng smiled lewdly.

No matter how Qiao Xin struggled, He Cheng held Qiao Xin steadily until he reached home.

Qiao Xin was thrown onto the bed by He Cheng. She glared at He Cheng and questioned, “How dare you do this to me?”

“Why wouldn’t I dare? Besides, if I didn’t do this, the Lu family said that the two of us would go to jail.” As He Cheng spoke, he swiftly took off his clothes and threw them to the ground. “It’s not like you don’t know. I’m timid. How could I turn myself in? That’s why I thought that we should do this together. It’ll be great. If you enjoy it, I’ll enjoy it too!”

Qiao Xin felt her body heat up. “If… if you let me leave, I’ll guarantee that you’ll be fine!”

“Qiao Xin, do you think you have the ability?” He Cheng raised his eyebrows slightly and said sarcastically, “The Qiao family is far inferior to the Lu family. Besides, if you really had the ability, would you have been caught by Lu Zhu?”

“My brother can protect us,” Qiao Xin said weakly. She couldn’t help but want to take off her coat now. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“There’s no need.” He Cheng smiled even more happily. As he took off his clothes, he walked towards Qiao Xin. “The medicine has already taken effect. Are you especially hot now and really want to take off your clothes? Come on, I’ll help you!”

He Cheng walked up to Qiao Xin and reached out to take off her clothes.

“Get lost! Don’t touch me!” Qiao Xin flung He Cheng’s hand away forcefully.

“Oh, this is even more exciting.” He Cheng’s eyes were filled with smiles. Without hesitation, he tore open Qiao Nian’s jacket and looked at Qiao Xin’s gradually exposed skin. His eyes were filled with smiles. “Fight back. The more you fight back, the more exciting it’ll be.”

“Shameless!”

“Don’t you want me to be shameless?” He Cheng’s smile grew brighter and brighter. Without hesitation, he pounced on her.

Qiao Xin still wanted to resist, but the medicine in her body had already begun to take effect. Her mind was a little blank, and the places He Cheng had touched were a little cold.

“No.” Qiao Xin twisted her body, but she couldn’t help but move closer to He Cheng.

“Look, you can’t help it anymore! Even if I don’t move, you can’t wait to stick to me,” He Cheng said smugly.

Qiao Xin bit He Cheng’s shoulder hard, the metallic taste spreading in her mouth.

“It hurts!” He Cheng frowned and slapped Qiao Xin hard in the face. “You b*tch, how dare you bite me!”
