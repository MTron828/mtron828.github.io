Chapter 1793 - 1793 Fantasize

Cui Huai could only defend passively. He frowned and looked at the young man in front of him. He said with a dark expression, “You still want to save him from me? You’re simply fantasizing!”

The president quickly whispered, “You can’t beat him now. You…”

“It’s precisely because you’re not as skilled as me that you want to kill me and my entire family!” Cui Huai interrupted the president mercilessly and looked at him angrily.

He had never figured out why the president had killed him and his entire family.

However, the president’s words just now made him realize something.

The president must be jealous of him and his skills. He was worried that he would snatch the president’s seat, so he made the first move to kill him.

When the President heard Cui Huai’s words, he frowned and looked at Cui Huai in disbelief. He did not understand what Cui Huai meant by these words. “What nonsense are you talking about?”

“Bastard, you’re still quibbling.” Cui Huai looked at the president’s confused expression and was furious.

Perhaps he had been deceived by the president’s gentle and harmless appearance back then and felt that the former president had made the right choice. He had helped the president at all costs.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

But in the end?

The president was a beast with a human face and a beast’s heart. He had killed his entire family.

The President retracted his gaze from Cui Huai’s face and looked at Chen Qing beside him. He said with a serious expression, “Chen Qing, this matter has nothing to do with you anymore. There’s no need for you to get involved, let alone lose your life because of this.”

When Cui Huai heard the president’s words, he sneered and said, “Have you been using this hypocritical appearance to win over your court officials for so many years?”

Chen Qing frowned and said, “Mr. President, everything I’m doing now is out of my own volition. It has nothing to do with anyone.”

Chen Qing gripped the handle of the knife in his hand tightly and looked coldly at Cui Huai, who was standing opposite him. If anything happened to the President, Lina would definitely be very sad.

Cui Huai looked at Chen Qing’s ungrateful appearance and prepared to kill Chen Qing with a single slash. Then, he would kill the president and avenge the entire Cui family.

Although Cui Huai was not young anymore, he had been living in resentment for so many years. He practiced hard every day so that he could kill the president with his own hands one day.

Cui Huai used 70% of his strength to slash at Chen Qing, but he did not expect Chen Qing to cleverly dodge. He looked at Chen Qing with a complicated expression.

This person looked very young. He originally thought that Chen Qing was as easy to deal with as the weak and incompetent guards around the president, but Chen Qing’s skills seemed to be far superior to those guards.

Cui Huai had to get serious. As long as he killed Chen Qing, he could kill the president.

At this moment, Chen Qing was injured, but even so, he still exchanged 10 blows with Cui Huai. However, more and more blood seeped out of his wound, and his stamina gradually collapsed.

The more Cui Huai fought, the braver he became. He could tell that Chen Qing was about to die. Just as he was about to end Chen Qing with a knife, a clear male voice came from behind.

“Stop!”

“Put down your knife.”

Cui Huai paused and felt a chill on his neck. He looked down and saw a knife pressed against his neck.

He looked at Chen Sheng’s face reflected on the cold knife and his expression froze slightly. His mind raced. In the end, he seemed to have thought of something and looked back at Chen Sheng.

“Put down the two knives in your hands.” Chen Sheng’s voice was no longer as gentle as usual. Instead, it was so cold that it made people shiver. “I’ve been with you for many years. I know very well what cheap tricks you have.”

Cui Huai threw down the long knife in his right hand, then threw the short knife in his left sleeve to the ground.

The sound of the short knife falling to the ground seemed to have drawn a perfect ending for Cui Huai’s revenge this time. He was so angry that his temples throbbed. He looked at Chen Sheng with hatred and gritted his teeth. “It’s really difficult for you to pretend to be by my side for so many years!”
