1014 Thank You, Ah Qi

Song Yu’s mind raced. Then, she smiled at Lu Qi and pretended to be surprised. “Thank you for the flowers, Ah Qi.”

With that, Song Yu stepped forward to pick up the flowers.

Of course, she was the only one Lu Qi could call sister.

If she didn’t step forward now, the rest of the Lu family might guess that she had long known that Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Lu Qi was slightly stunned. When she realized that she had made a mistake, she hurriedly shielded the flower in her arms and shook her head, explaining, “Sister Song Yu, you’ve misunderstood. These flowers were prepared for my biological sister, the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian.”

Seeing Song Yu’s disappointed expression, Lu Qi hurriedly said, “Next time, I’ll choose other flowers for you.”

Song Yu smiled.

Lu Qi walked up to Qiao Nian and handed the flowers to her with both hands. She smiled sweetly and said, “Sister, welcome home!”

Song Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Matriarch Lu’s eyes widened in disbelief. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

What?

Qiao Nian was Sugar?

For a moment, Matriarch Lu’s mind was in a mess.

Smiling, Qiao Nian took the flowers from Lu Qi. She was very touched, and her eyes flickered.

She looked down at the hyacinths in her hand. This was her favorite flower. She extended her arms and hugged Lu Qi.

Lu Qi hugged Qiao Nian tightly. Smelling Qiao Nian’s fragrance, her eyes turned slightly red.

Sister!

She had finally met her biological sister.

Previously, someone had wanted to kidnap her. It was her biological sister who had saved her.

In the past, she had heard from others that her sister was always the closest to her. Although she had a good relationship with Song Yu, she felt that there was a gap between the two of them. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, when she hugged Qiao Nian, her heart began to race. It was clearly winter, but her heart felt warm.

This was something Sister Song Yu could not give her.

“Sister.” Lu Qi couldn’t help but hug Qiao Nian tightly.

Holding Lu Qi in her arms, Qiao Nian gently patted her back, as if silently comforting her.

Lu Rao and Lu Jiang also walked out. When they saw Qiao Nian and Lu Qi hugging, they laughed in unison.

Their sister had finally arrived.

Matriarch Lu finally calmed down. Lu Qi and Lu Zhu’s actions just now, as well as Lu Rao and Lu Jiang’s gazes, made her realize something.

They all treated Qiao Nian as the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

She still remembered that when Sugar was born, her son and daughter-in-law had been looking forward to having a daughter. It wasn’t easy for them to have a daughter, and they were so happy that they couldn’t stop smiling.

Sugar gradually grew up and looked soft and cuddly. She was smart and always followed behind her brothers. She would even follow behind her and call her “Grandma” in a childish voice, acting cute.

Matriarch Lu could still remember how adorable Sugar looked. In a daze, she returned to when she was young and Sugar was still alive.

Matriarch Lu’s eyes turned red. She felt that Lu Qi might have been mistaken. That was why she treated Qiao Nian as Sugar.

Sigh.

She now suspected that it was really wrong to let everyone in the family remember Sugar. Otherwise, Lu Qi wouldn’t have treated Qiao Nian as her sister.

Qiao Nian sensed that Lu Qi’s body was trembling slightly. She couldn’t help but recall that when she reunited with Lu Qi, Lu Qi’s body had also trembled when she cried.

“Ah Qi, don’t cry,” Qiao Nian said gently. She looked at Lu Qi in her arms, her gaze extremely gentle. “Sister will always be here in the future. Be good!”

Gu Zhou stood beside Qiao Nian. He could see the gentleness in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Her voice was also extremely gentle, as if it carried a magic that could calm one’s heart.

The coldness of winter seemed to have dissipated a lot, making one feel as if they were bathing in a spring breeze.

However, Qiao Nian’s tone sounded a little familiar. Where had he heard it before?

Was it the time Qiao Nian comforted Gu Qi and Xiao Shi?

It didn’t seem so.

In a daze, Gu Zhou seemed to see a bathtub, and he was sitting in it.
