Chapter 442: Revenge

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At this moment, Mr. Chen walked up from the other side of the stage.

Mr. Chen was wearing a black windbreaker that made him look even taller. There was still a gentle smile on his face.

When Mr. Chen came out, he instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

Looking at his refined appearance, he still gave off a strong sense of oppression and suffocation.

At this moment, Qiao Nian walked to the middle of the stage.

Mr. Chen extended his hand towards Qiao Nian in a gentlemanly manner.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Mr. Chen’s hand. His hand was slender and long, and the back of his hand was smooth. If one looked at his hand alone, they might think that he was a young man.

Qiao Nian noticed that there was a layer of yellowed calluses on the palm of Mr. Chen’s hand. If she wasn’t wrong, these were probably calluses from holding a gun for a long time.

Qiao Nian looked up at Mr. Chen. Although he was smiling, she still felt a chill around her.

Mr. Chen smiled and said, “Congratulations, Miss Qiao!”

On the surface, he was congratulating Qiao Nian, but in reality, he was giving her a reminder.

Qiao Nian shook his hand. With a gentle squeeze, she let go.

Mr. Chen also let go. He walked over to the gift bearing lady and took out the prize. Then, he handed the jade box to Qiao Nian with both hands.

......

Qiao Nian smiled and took the jade box. She felt that it was heavy and thanked him politely.

Mr. Chen smiled and said, “Miss Qiao, you’re too polite. I hope you have fun for the rest of the journey!”

“Got it.”

Thunderous applause sounded from below the stage. Everyone was celebrating the fact that Qiao Nian had obtained the Moon Goddess. At this moment, she was the focus of everyone’s attention.

Initially, many people looked down on her, but now, they were very respectful to her.

In everyone’s eyes, the current Qiao Nian was a true beauty.

Song Yue, who was standing below the stage, bit her lip tightly. She left the hall silently and called someone when she reached the balcony.

“Mr. Jiang, I’m Song Yue. I…”

“I already know!” Before Song Yue could finish speaking, Jiang Chi interrupted her without hesitation.

Song Yue glanced back at the hall, her gaze landing on Qiao Nian, who was on the stage. She had been wearing a Bluetooth earpiece and had been keeping in touch with Jiang Chi. Moreover, there was a small camera on the corsage of her gown.

Through this camera, Jiang Chi could see everything that was happening.

Actually, Jiang Chi had also taken a fancy to that stone, so he had asked Song Yue to get it. However, he had never expected Qiao Nian to get it first.

Song Yue felt very uncomfortable. She could have gotten the Moon Goddess, and slapped Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian in the face on the spot, but she hadn’t expected that she would be one step behind.

Jiang Chi’s gaze landed on the monitor. Without taking his eyes off Qiao Nian, he said meaningfully, “Qiao Nian.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Song Yue sensed danger from Jiang Chi’s words. A scheming look flashed across her eyes as she asked tentatively, “Mr. Jiang, now that we haven’t obtained the Moon Goddess, what should we do next?”

On the other side of the earpiece, Jiang Chi did not answer Song Yue’s question. Instead, he asked, “Do you want to marry Lu Zhu?”

A trace of shyness flashed across Song Yue’s face as she replied without hesitation, “Yes.”

“In that case, I’ll hand Lu Zhu over to you tonight. However, you need to hand Qiao Nian and the Moon Goddess over to me. My men will support you later!”

Upon hearing Jiang Chi’s words, Song Yue heaved a sigh of relief. The depression she had felt from being suppressed by Qiao Nian over the past two days was swept away.

“Okay!” Song Yue agreed without hesitation.

Song Yue really hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to have so much money. She seemed to see Qiao Nian standing on the stage, looking down on her.

After tonight, she would pull Qiao Nian down from the pedestal and let everyone know that Qiao Nian was just a plaything for Jiang Chi.
