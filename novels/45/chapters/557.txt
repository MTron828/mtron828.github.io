Chapter 558: Illegitimate Child?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The atmosphere in the room instantly turned awkward.

A thought flashed in Qiao Nian’s mind. She recalled Jiang Yue’s words and looked up at Gu Zhou.

She recalled Gu Zhou’s worry when Gu Qi fell ill, and what Gu Zhou had told her previously.

Gu Zhou did not look like a father at all.

Although many fathers did not usually take care of their children, when their children had a fever and fell ill, their fathers would definitely step forward to take good care of them. They would not be like Gu Zhou, who seemed to be at a loss as to what to do, as if this was the first time he had seen a sick child.

Could Jiang Yue have misunderstood?

Or could it be that Jiang Yue had other motives for coming here?

Qiao Nian couldn’t quite understand. She pursed her lips and said, “Jiang Yue came by today!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou’s eyes turned cold. “How did she get in? What was she doing here?”

“I think she came back to get something, but she said some strange things.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, not interrupting her. He let her continue.

Initially, Qiao Nian didn’t intend to tell Gu Zhou about this, even though it was related to their marriage.

Qiao Nian knew very well that neither she nor Gu Zhou had approved of this marriage.

They just had to be together because of some relationship.

But before they got a divorce, Qiao Nian didn’t want anyone else to interfere in their affairs either.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with a burning gaze and said in a low voice, “He told me that you had another woman outside. Moreover, you and that woman already have an illegitimate child!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze slightly, a trace of panic flashing in his eyes. It was as if a white horse had flashed past the gap and disappeared in an instant. His body exuded a cold aura. He looked up at Qiao Nian and asked, “Then do you believe her?”

“I don’t know your past, and I don’t want to comment. I just want to hear it from you.”

She believed that Gu Zhou would not lie to her.

Gu Zhou had no feelings for her in that way at all, and there was no need to lie to her about such things.

If Jiang Yue said that all of this was true, then it was no big deal. She would leave Gu Zhou and give up this position. When the time came, she would give that illegitimate child a complete family.

Gu Zhou didn’t speak immediately. He looked at the indifference in Qiao Nian’s eyes. There was no sadness, no sadness, and no hysteria. There was only calmness and a desire to know the truth.

Gu Zhou’s fists, which had been clenched in his pants, slowly relaxed. He looked up at Qiao Nian and said calmly, “I don’t have any wild women outside.”

From now on, Gu Qi’s mother would be his first wife, Qiao Nian. Hence, she was not a wild woman.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

For some reason, when Gu Zhou said the words “wild women”, she felt an inexplicable urge to laugh.

Qiao Nian didn’t interrupt Gu Zhou. Instead, she waited for him to continue.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Gu Qi’s small face again. The coldness in his eyes dissipated a little, replaced by warmth. However, his voice grew deeper. “As for the illegitimate child she mentioned…”

Gu Zhou pursed his lips. He looked into Qiao Nian’s serious eyes and said calmly, “I think she’s talking about Gu Qi!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Gu Qi was actually his child?

Jesus.

How could that be?

Didn’t he say that Gu Qi was just the child of a friend of his?

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but frown. If Gu Qi was his child, why would Gu Zhou lie to her?

If Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s child, why did Gu Zhou let Gu Qi grow up alone?

Didn’t he know that Gu Qi had autism?
