853 It’s Fine

She innocently even found an excuse for Qiao Yu, thinking that the person who had harmed her was Qiao Xin and had nothing to do with Qiao Yu.

Qiao Xin didn’t like her, which was why she wanted to harm her.

When Qiao Xin told Qiao Yu that she didn’t have any self-respect and was with other indecent men, Qiao Yu didn’t listen to her explanation at all and slapped her.

Qiao Nian was stunned. Only then did she realize that Qiao Yu trusted Qiao Xin the most, not her.

!!

Later on, when the Qiao family found out that she was pregnant, Qiao Yu only looked at her with anger and disappointment.

It was precisely because of this that she no longer wanted to have anything to do with Qiao Yu.

Moreover, in the past five years, Qiao Yu had never visited her. It was as if she didn’t exist.

It was at that time that she was very disappointed in Qiao Yu.

She had finally seen through it. The Qiao family was all selfish.

Hence, Qiao Nian wasn’t angry at all. If she was still angry, it meant that she still cared about them. But now, she didn’t care at all.

Qiao Nian said coldly, “Perhaps in the past, I would still take care of these things and blame you. We’re clearly family. Why are you so heartless to me!”

“But now I understand. We’ve never been family from the beginning to the end, and we have nothing to do with each other. It’s only right that you treat me badly. Besides, these things have already happened. Can I go back to the past and change them?”

“If I had that ability, how could I have been bullied?”

“Let bygones be bygones. President Qiao should understand!”

Qiao Nian smiled at Qiao Yu and raised her eyebrows slightly.

Qiao Yu was panicking. He had a feeling that if he didn’t explain himself clearly now, he probably wouldn’t be able to.

“Nian’er, actually, I…”

“Whatever happens to you has nothing to do with me!” Qiao Nian interrupted Qiao Yu mercilessly and said coldly, “But don’t call me that anymore. It sounds a little disgusting!”

Qiao Yu’s lips moved, but he had no choice but to swallow the words.

“I’m sorry!”

Qiao Nian stood up, looking indifferent. “I don’t want your apology, and you don’t have to apologize to me!”

With that, Qiao Nian turned to leave without hesitation.

Actually, she still felt a little uncomfortable.

In the past, she had always treated Qiao Yu as her biological brother. Even though she knew that Qiao Yu was not related to her by blood, she still wanted to treat him as her brother.

All these years, she only wanted to hear Qiao Yu apologize to her.

But when she really heard this word, she realized that she no longer needed Qiao Yu’s apology.

At this moment, she only wanted to see Gu Zhou.

She had arranged to meet Gu Zhou at the Dongjiang villa at half past three. If she rushed over now, she would be in time.

Qiao Xin had been standing at the door. When she saw Qiao Nian coming out, her gaze fell on her.

Qiao Nian wasn’t holding the proposal. She knew in her heart that the negotiation had failed.

Thinking about it, Qiao Nian couldn’t wait for the Qiao family to be ruined. Why would she hand such a good project to the Qiao family?

Qiao Xin suppressed her anger. This was a wild girl from the countryside. Now, she had learned to use her power on others!

Qiao Nian couldn’t even be bothered to look at Qiao Xin. Ignoring her, she brushed past Qiao Xin and walked towards the door.

“Qiao Nian!”

Qiao Xin really couldn’t stand Qiao Nian’s attitude. She stopped her coldly.

The current Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to talk to the Qiao family at all. She didn’t stop and walked towards the door.

Qiao Xin jogged over to Qiao Nian and blocked her path.

When Qiao Nian saw the Qiao family, it was as if she had seen something dirty. She said impatiently, “Move aside!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Qiao Xin frowned. In the past, she had always thought that Qiao Nian was just a country bumpkin.

But she couldn’t understand how a country bumpkin could be related to Nanshan Corporation.
