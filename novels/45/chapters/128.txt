Chapter 129: Research Director Qiao

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Without hesitation, Director Lin nodded.

“Congratulations, Research Director Qiao Nian.”

“Congratulations, Director Qiao!”

“Director Qiao is truly deserving of her reputation!”

…

The others hurriedly congratulated her, showering her with compliments.

Seeing this, Qiao Xin found the situation extremely ironic.

Those people were simply fence-sitters! What a fickle lot!

Hatred flashed in Qiao Xin’s eyes. She didn’t know how Qiao Nian, that wretch, could possess so much good fortune. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Qiao Nian was clearly inferior to her in every way.

She could not take this lying down!

She simply couldn’t!

Meanwhile, Su Yan had never expected the project he had been optimistic about to disappear just like that.

If he could secure this big project, he would be able to bring the Su family to greater heights.

Moreover, before he came, he had already sworn to his family that he would get this project without fail. But now, this project had been snatched away by Qiao Nian.

Su Yan’s chest burned with rage, and his mind raced. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. “Director Lin, Research Director Qiao won’t be able to provide medical equipment. Shouldn’t you find another partner?”

Su Yan’s thought process was simple. Even if he couldn’t be the leader of this project, he should find some way to join the project. That way, he would have something to say when he got back to his family.

Director Lin glanced at Su Yan with a complicated expression, but remained quiet.

Qiao Nian stood at the side and sighed.

“Why are you sighing?” Su Yan asked in confusion.

Qiao Nian gave Su Yan a disdainful look. “1 just think that your skin is thicker than the city walls.”

Su Yan’s anger was obvious. He clenched his fists so tightly that his nails dug into his palms. Blood coated his fingernails, but he didn’t seem to feel a thing. ‘You…’

Qiao Nian cut Su Yan off mercilessly. Her gaze fell on his face as she raised an eyebrow. “Are you an idiot?”

Su Yan’s face flushed red with embarrassment. To be humiliated by Qiao Nian in public!

“Qiao Nian, you’ve gone too far!” Su Yan bellowed.

“Please watch your manners.” Qiao Nian smiled at Su Yan and continued, “I’m the first partner. As for who is willing to provide medical equipment to us, the choice is mine. Mr. Su, do you think I’ll let you work with me? Do you think I’m a fool, or is it you who’s stupid? Do you think I’ll allow someone who slanders me to work with

Without waiting for Su Yan to reply, Qiao Nian continued, “With all the mud you slung at me just now, how can I be sure that you won’t betray me in the future?”

Director Lin stood at the side and nodded seriously. “Qiao Nian is now the director of the research institute. From now on, she will be in charge of everything to do with the institute.”

Director Lin’s words implied that he agreed with Qiao Nian.

How could Su Yan not tell? His expression was livid, but he had to secure the contract for medical equipment. Otherwise, his life in the Su family would be terrible from now on.

Su Yan knew very well that Qiao Nian was angry at him mainly because he had been protecting Qiao Xin. Qiao Nian was probably filled with jealousy and resentment.

After some time had passed, he would say some nice things to Qiao Nian. With Qiao Nian’s fondness for him, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to secure the partnership.

Su Yan was about to take the opportunity to leave when he heard Qiao Nian speak.

“Second Young Master Gu, I remember you mentioned the collaboration as well just now. Are you still interested?”

Qiao Nian walked up to Gu Zhou and looked at him intently.

Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s gaze, his gaze lingering on her cherry-red lips. His eyes darkened a few shades, the expression in them undefinable.

Everyone turned to look at Gu Zhou, waiting for his reply.

Su Yan gritted his teeth and glared at Gu Zhou with a ferocious expression.

Gu Zhou’s thin lips opened slightly. “It will be my honor to work with Director Qiao Nian!”

His voice was as cold as ever, carrying a refined gentlemanliness.

Many of the women present were watching Gu Zhou speak affectionately to Qiao Nian, One by one, their hearts all surged with emotion.

Oh my god!

This man was so handsome!

His voice was so pleasant to the ear!

How great would it have been if he wasn’t sick!

It doesn’t matter if he’s ill. I’m willing to continue taking care of him! I’m willing to give birth to his child!

Su Yan was livid when he heard the infatuated voices of the women.

This was his first time attempting to enter the business world, but he had suffered such a huge setback, and was even utterly humiliated.

The more Su Yan thought about it, the angrier he became. He turned around and walked out..
