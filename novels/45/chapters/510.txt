Song Yue met Qiao Nian’s gaze. Qiao Nian looked at her as if she was looking at a dead person.

Song Yue felt a chill on her back and her surroundings were cold.

She was a little afraid of the current Qiao Nian.

Song Yue suppressed her fear. She would never allow a country bumpkin like Qiao Nian to step on her head.

She was a high and mighty heiress.

She was the most suitable woman for Brother Lu Zhu.

Song Yue questioned, “Qiao Nian, don’t change the topic. Do you think I won’t know if you don’t tell me? From the beginning, I suspected that you were in cahoots with Jiang Chi. Otherwise, why would Jiang Chi let you leave? The facts prove that I was right!”

Qiao Nian felt that Song Yue was getting more and more ridiculous.

She believed that her brother would never believe Song Yue’s nonsense.

Qiao Nian asked, “Weren’t you the one who cooperated with Jiang Chi and told his men to take my life? It hasn’t even been a week. Does Miss Song have amnesia? Have you forgotten all about this? You said that I’m not my brother’s sister. Do you have any evidence?”

Towards the end, Qiao Nian’s voice became colder and colder. She was about to lose her patience.

Qiao Nian looked at Song Yue threateningly, as if warning her not to spout nonsense.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Song Yue snorted coldly and said disdainfully, “You won’t give up until you see death!”

After Song Yue finished speaking, her gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face. She said ingratiatingly, “Brother Lu Zhu, when you were in the operating theater, Qiao Nian gave you 500 milliliters of blood because you lost too much blood. If she’s close to you, the doctor wouldn’t have used her blood. This can only mean one thing. She only has the same blood type as you. You two aren’t related by blood.”

Lu Zhu did not speak. His gaze became colder and colder.

Qiao Nian frowned. She hadn’t expected Song Yue to know about her blood donation. Moreover, Song Yue had used this matter to prove that she wasn’t Lu Zhu’s biological sister.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, Song Yue thought that she had hit Qiao Nian’s sore spot and became even more arrogant.

“Qiao Nian, you’re really vicious. Your blood was transfused into Brother Lu Zhu’s body. When the two of you do a paternity test, the results will definitely show that the two of you aren’t related by blood. You’re really scheming. You’ve done so much just to get close to Brother Lu and the Lu family. Tell me, what exactly do you want to do?”

When Qiao Nian heard Song Yue’s question, she wished she could give her a thumbs up. She looked at Song Yue disdainfully and mocked, “Your imagination is running wild. You described it so vividly. If you’re so good at making things up, why don’t you become a screenwriter?”

Lu Zhu sat by the bed and looked at Song Yue quietly. Song Yue’s face was filled with seriousness, as if she was not lying.

Even though Song Yue sounded serious and flawless, Lu Zhu still believed that Qiao Nian was Sugar. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lu Zhu did not know why he would believe that Sugar was her so unconditionally.

Song Yue saw that Qiao Nian was silent. Like a judge in court, she said righteously, “Qiao Nian, the evidence is in front of you now. I’ve exposed all your lies. What else do you have to say? I advise you to tell the truth early!”

Qiao Nian smiled coldly and asked, “Who told you that I donated blood?”

When Song Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she laughed maniacally and said sarcastically, “Qiao Nian, I think you’re the one with Alzheimer’s. You’re already spouting nonsense. All the doctors and nurses know that you donated blood to Brother Lu Zhu. Moreover, Li Na even said that you donated 500 milliliters!”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She didn’t want her brother to hold a grudge against her because of Song Yue.
