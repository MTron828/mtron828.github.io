Everyone entered the house. Just as Song Man was about to pour them some water, she heard Qin Chuan speak.

“Miss Song, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. It’s getting late. Why don’t you pack up early? We’ll take you to An City together, and you’ll be able to see Xiao Shi soon.”

An City.

When Song Man heard the words “An City”, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

!!

After so many years, she could finally go back. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

She no longer had to live in Hai Cheng. She could return to An City in glory.

At the thought that she was about to find her family, tears of joy fell uncontrollably.

Song Man raised her hand to wipe the tears from her eyes and looked at Qin Chuan expectantly. “Mr. Qin, has Xiao Shi found my parents?”

Qin Chuan said without changing his expression, “Xiao Shi has already found her family!”

When Song Man heard Qin Chuan’s words, she thought that she had really found her parents. She couldn’t help but smile and say with relief, “Alright, that’s good. She won’t have to suffer with me anymore!”

Qin Chuan nodded. “Let’s leave early!”

Qin Chuan was suspicious of Song Man’s words.

If Song Man was really poor, how could she afford such an expensive perfume?

However, these things were not within his consideration.

Song Man nodded eagerly. “Okay, Mr. Qin, wait for me.”

Song Man walked to her room, took out her suitcase, and placed her usual things in it.

Actually, she didn’t want to pack at all.

She knew that when she found her parents, they would definitely prepare more things for her, such as clothes, shoes, and handbags.

After all, the Lu family was extremely rich.

Her good days had arrived.

However, Song Man still pretended to pack some things. After filling a suitcase, she walked to the living room and smiled at Qin Chuan. “Mr. Qin, I’ve already packed up. Let’s go now!”

One of Qin Chuan’s subordinates took the box with great foresight.

Song Man sat in the back seat of the Rolls-Royce. She looked out of the window.

She could finally leave the slums of Hai Cheng, a place where even flies and rats were unwilling to stay for long.

She never wanted to come back again.

Although she had lived here for a long time, she had no feelings for this place.

All she wanted to do now was leave this nauseating place.

Song Man’s exquisite and beautiful face was reflected in the car window. Her lips curved into a mocking smile.

…

The next morning.

When Qiao Nian woke up, she inadvertently placed her hand beside the bed. When she opened her eyes, she realized that Gu Zhou had already woken up.

The bedding beside the bed had already turned cold. It seemed that Gu Zhou had woken up early.

Qiao Nian recalled what Gu Zhou had told her last night.

Strangely enough, she really couldn’t remember when she had seen Gu Zhou.

It seemed that he could only find the results from her diary.

Qiao Nian took out her phone. It was already eight in the morning. She had another text from Qin Chuan at twelve last night.

—I’ve already picked her up. She’ll arrive at noon tomorrow.

When Qiao Nian saw this message, her expression grew more and more serious. She had a strange feeling.

She recalled the calluses on Xiao Shi’s hands. She really wanted to see her mother.

She had to plan everything carefully.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and moved her fingers. Then, she sent a text to Qin Chuan. “How’s Xiao Shi’s mother?”

Qin Chuan replied very quickly.

“Not bad. She looks like a pampered young lady!”

When Qiao Nian saw these words, her frown deepened.

Xiao Shi had worked so hard. Why did she look like a pampered young lady?

Qiao Nian grew wary of Xiao Shi’s mother. It seemed that there would be a lot of trouble in the coming days.

Qiao Nian recalled what she had asked Qin Chuan to investigate previously and sent another message. “I asked you to investigate the disappearance of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. How’s your investigation going?”

Initially, Qiao Nian hadn’t told Qin Chuan her true identity. However, she thought that even if she didn’t tell Qin Chuan, he might still find out her true identity. Hence, she told him her true identity.
