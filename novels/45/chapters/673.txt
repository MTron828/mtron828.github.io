Chapter 674: Playing the Piano with Four Hands

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This was a very healing song.

Later on, when he found out that his sister had already passed away, he changed the rest of the song.

The second half of the song changed from being warm and healing to miserable. This song was about his sister’s life.

Every time it was almost Sugar’s death anniversary, he would play the song “Light” written for Sugar again, trying hard to recall when Sugar was still at home.

At that time, Sugar was still young and couldn’t speak properly, but she kept pestering him to listen to him play.

Happy times were always short-lived.

Lu Nian recalled that in the past, he wanted to see how Qiao Nian was like all grown up. He was in a daze.

He walked over to Qiao Nian and sat down beside her.

Qiao Nian nimbly moved over. Without needing Lu Nian to speak, she saw Lu Nian’s yearning gaze and knew that he wanted to play a duet with her.

Lu Nian placed his hands on the keyboard and turned to look at Qiao Nian.

He still remembered Sugar telling him in a soft voice in the past.

“Second Brother, when I grow up, I want to play the piano with you!”

The soul of “Light” could only be perfectly reflected when the bass and high notes were combined.

The two of them looked at each other and played at the same time.

It was the same tune as before.

However, when Qiao Nian and Lu Nian played it together, the tune they played was perfect.

Lu Zhu closed his eyes and admired the music the two of them were playing. In a daze, he seemed to have returned to when Sugar was acting cute towards them.

When Lu Nian played, his gaze couldn’t help but fall on Qiao’s face. All kinds of things from the past surfaced.

“Second Brother, I want to hear you play a song!”

“Second Brother, can I play with you now?”

“Second Brother, why is the piano sound I’m playing now different from yours?”

“Second Brother, write a song for me too!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

…

Sugar’s gentle voice echoed in his ears. Lu Nian slowly closed his eyes and couldn’t help but recall the happy times he had with Sugar when he was young.

When the song ended, Lu Nian sat in front of the piano in silence for a long time before looking up.

When he saw that Qiao Nian was still reminiscing about the music just now, his lips curved up involuntarily.

It was good that his sister was still alive.

Lu Nian looked at Qiao Nian and thought of Sugar in the past. It was as if the pain of more than twenty years had instantly disappeared.

At this moment, applause rang out.

Lu Nian and Qiao Nian turned their heads and saw Lu Zhu smiling. His eyes were shining brightly.

The entire piano room instantly felt like it was illuminated.

Lu Nian smiled. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face again and he said gently, “I wrote this song for you. I really didn’t expect you to still remember it after so many years.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, her heart skipped a beat.

She finally understood why Second Brother had started questioning her if she had entered this small room when she walked in just now. Moreover, Second Brother had looked angry at that time.

It turned out that this song meant an extraordinary amount to Second Brother. Second Brother had written this song specially for her and did not allow anyone else to touch it. This should be Second Brother’s bottom line.

The displeasure in Qiao Nian’s heart instantly disappeared. A bright smile appeared on her face as she continued, “Second Brother, when I was a musician at your concert previously, I was a little nervous. Brother Cao specially played the first half of this song for me, but I only heard half of it. However, I remembered it. When I came here today, some inexplicable score suddenly appeared in my mind, so I tried to play it.”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Lu Nian’s face. She continued, “I didn’t expect those to be memories of my childhood.”

When Lu Nian heard Qiao Nian’s words, he nodded slightly and said, “No wonder you couldn’t answer when I asked you where you got the score.”
