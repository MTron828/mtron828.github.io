1032 Thank You, Fourth Brother

Sugar liked to read. Other than reading, she usually liked to stick to Lu Nian.

Lu Nian was so obsessed with playing the piano that he couldn’t extricate himself. She was worried that Lu Nian would be angry with Sugar for causing trouble, but later on, she realized that she was wrong.

Sugar followed Lu Nian to the piano room. Sugar would sit obediently beside Lu Nian and listen to him play the piano. Occasionally, she would play a duet with Lu Nian.

Matriarch Lu retracted her thoughts and sighed. Just as she was about to speak, she heard Qiao Nian speak.

“Yes, yes. I have time!” Qiao Nian agreed eagerly.

The smile on Matriarch Lu’s face grew brighter and brighter. She said, “Alright, you siblings, go quickly. We won’t disturb you anymore!”

“Thank you, Grandma,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

Qiao Nian smiled at Lu Nian. Not only did she like music, but Lu Nian was also her idol. Of course she wanted to hear Second Brother’s new song.

Song Yu followed behind Old Madam Lu. Seeing Lu Nian and Qiao Nian chatting and laughing, she was slightly dazed.

She still remembered Jiang Yue telling her in the past that Second Brother’s attitude towards Qiao Nian was different. Moreover, Qiao Nian seemed to like Second Brother too.

Now she finally understood.

Second Brother and Qiao Nian were biological siblings. The two of them were related by blood, so they couldn’t help but get close. This was normal.

Song Yu looked at Qiao Nian enviously. When Second Brother saw Qiao Nian, his eyes were filled with love. She wondered when Second Brother would look at her like this.

Lu Jiang’s voice interrupted Song Yu’s thoughts.

Song Yu turned around and saw Lu Jiang handing a fruit plate to her. There were cherries on the fruit plate.

“What were you thinking about just now? I called you twice, but you didn’t respond. Hurry up and try these cherries. They taste quite good. I remember that you like cherries the most.”

Song Yu looked at Lu Jiang, who was as handsome as a nobleman. She had to admit that the Lu siblings were both very good-looking.

“It’s nothing.” Song Yu took out the cherries from the fruit plate and turned back to look at Qiao Nian, who was not far away. She said, “I just thought that Sister had lived alone outside for more than twenty years. It really wasn’t easy. Now, our family is finally reunited.”

When Lu Jiang heard Song Yu’s words, he looked at Qiao Nian not far away. At this moment, Qiao Nian was chatting and laughing with Lu Nian. The smile on Qiao Nian’s face was very bright, making everything around her pale in comparison.

“Yes, it’s indeed not easy for her,” Lu Jiang said as he took the fruit plate in front of Song Yu. “Take more.”

“Thank you, Fourth Brother.” Song Yu smiled and took a few more cherries.

Lu Jiang looked at Song Yu with concern and asked, “I heard that you’re going to film again in a few days?”

“Yes, the contract has been signed. The filming will start in a week.”

“Then take good care of yourself when the time comes. Call home if you need anything.”

“Okay.” Song Yu nodded. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Fourth Brother had always treated her very well and cared about her very much. If only Second Brother could treat her the same way.

At the thought of this, Song Yu couldn’t help but look at Qiao Nian and Lu Nian.

Qiao Nian was talking to Lu Nian when she sensed that someone was staring at her. She turned around and saw Fourth Brother and Song Yu looking at her.

Fourth Brother looked doting.

However, Song Yu’s gaze was a little strange, and she looked a little confused.

At this moment, Lu Jiang was holding a fruit plate and inviting everyone to eat cherries.

“Let’s go to the piano room now!” Lu Nian said with a smile.

Qiao Nian nodded vigorously. She couldn’t wait to hear her second brother’s new song.

She turned to look at everyone and asked, “Does everyone want to listen to Second Brother’s new song together?”

Lu Rao was talking to Lu Qi. When he heard this, he said, “If you go, we’ll go.”

The others nodded.

Seeing them like this, Lu Nian felt a little helpless.

In the past, only Lu Qi was willing to listen to his new song. No one else was willing to listen at all.

Now that their sister was back, they wanted to follow her.

Qiao Nian noticed that Song Yu had been standing there with her head lowered. In a daze, she seemed to recall herself when she was in the Qiao family. At that time, she felt that she didn’t belong in the Qiao family.
