She slowly sat up, took the clothes from the side, and put them on. Her eyes were red, but she was stubbornly unwilling to shed a tear.

She had to ask clearly if her mother had given her to Lu Zhu on purpose!

She hoped her mother didn’t do it.

After Qiao Xin put on her clothes, she ran towards the door. Fortunately, He Cheng hadn’t locked it. She could open it from the inside.

Qiao Xin’s leg hurt terribly. Supporting herself against the wall, she limped out. Worried that others would see her face, she put on her hat and let her hair fall over her face.

From now on, she would never be soft-hearted!

Qiao Xin suddenly recalled something. Previously, her mother had suggested that she and He Cheng deal with Qiao Nian again. It was precisely because of this that she had asked He Cheng out.

At that time, her mother had also sent her a lot of money.

She couldn’t go home now. Qiao Xin hailed a taxi and went straight to the house she had rented.

The house she rented was near the school. Sometimes, when she studied late in the school library, she would stay there.

Qiao Xin arrived at her place and tidied herself up briefly, covering all the injuries on her face. However, the injuries on her leg seemed to have worsened. She went to the hospital to bandage her leg again.

After Qiao Xin settled everything, she recalled that the people He Cheng had contacted for her were already in the earth temple in the west of the city. Her eyes darkened, and she thought to herself that she had to get those people to kill Qiao Nian.

She was a little worried about He Cheng. Worried that he would betray her again, she took a taxi to the Earth Temple.

She was a little worried about He Cheng. Worried that he would betray her again, she took a taxi to the Earth Temple.

She had just gotten out of the taxi and taken two steps towards the earth temple when a man leaned over.

“Miss, do you need any help?”

The man smelled like a garbage dump. He was wearing a tattered cotton shirt. The shirt was falling apart, but he didn’t seem to care.

“There’s no need!” Leaning on her walking stick, Qiao Xin walked towards the temple.

The beggar glanced at the taxi that had already left. He picked Qiao Xin up in his arms and said lecherously, “Little beauty, why are you so stubborn? Aren’t you comfortable with me hugging you?”

Qiao Xin’s expression changed. She immediately shouted, “Stupid beggar, put me down!”

A trace of anger flashed in the man’s eyes, but it was quickly washed away by the thought of tasting a woman. He said happily, “Brothers, that chick is here. Everyone, come out!”

There were a total of six beggars in the Earth Temple. All of them were dressed sloppily and emitted an unpleasant stench. Not only that, some of them were surrounded by many flies because they had not taken a shower for a long time.

“Oh, I really didn’t expect Brother He to send a little beauty over. This little beauty is really good-looking. We’re in luck!”

When Qiao Xin heard one of the beggars’ words, her expression changed.

Brother He?

She was right. These people were all hired by He Cheng.

“Put me down. I’m your employer!” Qiao Xin calmed down. These people were all paid to do things. “I’m here to remind you of something!”

The beggar carrying Qiao Xin chuckled and said, “Employer? Who are you fooling? It’s true that we’re beggars, but we have brains!”

“That’s right,” another beggar said. “Brother He said that our target is a good-looking woman. Don’t worry, you’re so good-looking. We’ll definitely serve you well!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Xin’s face turned pale!

Although she liked to be praised for her beauty, she really didn’t want those people to praise her now.

What did these people mean!

They didn’t care who it was. Did they plan to use force?

Realizing this, Qiao Xin pursed her lips. “I told you, I’m the employer. If you dare to touch me, I won’t give you a single cent!”

“The employer is clearly Brother He. What kind of employer are you!”

“Exactly, exactly!”

“I’ll give you money!” Qiao Xin shouted in fear.
