Chapter 58: Lunatic

“Excuse me, I’ll go take a look.” Su Yan gave Shen Xing a smile.

He was genuinely worried that Qiao Nian would suddenly fall back into her old ways and set fire to another school building. Then, it would be meaningless to have the graduation banquet.

With that, Su Yan walked past the surrounding juniors and strode towards Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin didn’t want to go, but when she recalled how Su Yan had gazed unblinkingly at Qiao Nian the night before, she felt her heart skip a beat in fear. She quickly followed suit.

From afar, Qiao Nian saw Su Yan and Qiao Xin walking towards her. She said to the man next to her, “Do as we’ve discussed. Go ahead!”

“Yes, Miss Qiao.” With that, the man turned and walked out.

At that moment, Su Yan walked up to Qiao Nian, not bothering to hide the disgust in his eyes. Suppressing his anger, he said, “Let’s talk.”

Qiao Nian surveyed her surroundings. Only after seeing that there was no one else around did she acknowledge that Su Yan was speaking to her. She sneered. “I’m sorry, I have nothing to say to you.”

“Qiao Nian, you must know your place!” Su Yan glared at her, frowning.

If Su Yan wasn’t worried that Qiao Nian would do something crazy again, he wouldn’t have lowered himself to the level of speaking to her.

“You’re crazy!” Qiao Nian turned to leave, but she was stopped by Su Yan. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Five years ago, I already made it clear to you that I don’t like you. Why are you still chasing after me?” Su Yan’s hands clenched involuntarily into fists. If only he could get the security guards to throw Qiao Nian out of campus.

“Su Yan, what do you mean by that? Are you saying that I’m pursuing you?” Qiao Nian finally understood what Su Yan meant. Sneering, she glanced at him as if he was a pile of shit.

Su Yan met her gaze, his brow involuntarily furrowing.

“I’m really sorry, Su Yan. I’m not interested in human excrement at all.” Qiao Nian gave a bright smile.

“Sister, stop.” Seeing that the situation was worsening, Qiao Xin hurriedly stepped forward to pull Su Yan back, speaking gently to Qiao Nian as she did so. “I know you’re still interested in Brother Su Yan. Brother Su Yan knows that you’re rejecting him to hide your feelings, but he’s already my boyfriend. Can you please stop having any ideas about him?”

Su Yan had almost lost control of his anger. Fortunately, Qiao Xin had stopped him. Otherwise, if he were to lose his temper here tonight, his name would be trending on the Internet the next day.

Su Yan’s gaze softened as he looked at Qiao Xin. Qiao Xin was such a sensible girl.

Qiao Nian glanced at the couple in front of her and smiled. “The two of you are a perfect match for each other. A maggot belongs with human excrement.”

With that, Qiao Nian turned and left without hesitation.

Su Yan stood rooted to the ground, his face flushed red with anger. He couldn’t think of a way to get back at Qiao Nian.

Excrement?

How dare she say that to him!

She was simply a lunatic!

He had to find a chance to humiliate her.

Qiao Xin could tell that something was wrong with Su Yan’s expression. Worried that he would lose his temper, she carefully took hold of his hand and said gently, “Brother Su Yan, don’t get too angry. My sister used to be warded in a mental hospital, and there are some problems with her brain. She’s different from normal people like us. Seeing as she’s my sister, don’t blame her anymore, okay?”

Yes, Qiao Nian was a lunatic!

He could not stoop to the level of a lunatic.

At the thought of this, Su Yan’s expression grew considerably brighter. He smiled at Qiao Xin and said gently, “I understand. For your sake, I won’t be angry with her.”

Back when he courted Qiao Xin, Qiao Xin had always been unwilling to be with him because of Qiao Nian.

It hadn’t been easy for the two of them to get together, but he had never expected Qiao Nian to disregard the sisterhood between her and Qiao Xin.

Qiao Nian was truly an awful person..
