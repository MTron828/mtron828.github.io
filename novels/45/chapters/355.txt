Chapter 356: Bad Intentions

Song Yu’s skin was very fair and looked almost transparent.

She also brought four security guards and her manager with her. These people protected her tightly. Ordinary people could not get close to her. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Mr. Qin is so generous. He even invited a popular celebrity.”

“Her new drama is not bad.”

“Are you referring to the Quality of the Empress?”

“Yes, yes. She’s even more beautiful in person than on television.”

“Looks like Mr. Qin has prepared a lot of good things tonight.”

However, what made everyone even more curious was who Song Yu had just called.

Under everyone’s stunned gazes, Song Yu walked up to Lu Nian step by step, a bright smile on her face. “Brother, I didn’t expect to meet you on such an occasion.”

Lu Nian instantly sensed the gazes of the people around him. Most of them were confused.

He had never liked being stared at. His beautiful phoenix-like eyes narrowed unhappily. “Yes.”

He replied coldly. Everyone around him could tell.

Song Yu’s smile bloomed like a flower, but she didn’t pay much attention to it. Her gaze inadvertently fell on Gu Zhou. She had wanted to greet him, but she didn’t want Gu Zhou to be in the headlines tomorrow, so she didn’t say anything.

“Who exactly is that man? He’s too beautiful!”

“I’ve never seen him before. I don’t know whose family he belongs to.”

“If this man enters the entertainment industry, he will definitely become a top celebrity in an instant!”

…

Qiao Nian stood at the side. She had a feeling that Lu Nian didn’t like Song Yu.

Weren’t the two of them siblings?

While the others were curious about Lu Nian’s identity, the host, Zhang Lei, spoke up. His voice was rich and magnetic.

Everyone looked over and found it unbelievable. Their eyes widened.

Qin Chuan was truly amazing. He had actually invited the most famous host in the world over.

This host had hosted “Five Thousand Years of China”. That program was very popular. Even now, its viewership ratings were still far ahead of others.

“Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I, Zhang Lei, have been waiting for you for a long time. I’m sure everyone knows that all the funds for the auction will be sent to the poor mountainous areas tonight to build a school for the children there. I’m sure everyone has come with a pure heart. I’ll thank you on behalf of those children!”

After the host finished speaking, the people below hurriedly applauded.

“Next, we’ll invite the first item to be auctioned. The starting price is 50 million!”

When everyone heard the price, they were all stunned.

They had not expected the first item to be so expensive. It seemed that Qin Chuan had prepared a lot of good things.

They were very curious about what the first treasure was!

Zhang Lei smiled and said, “Next, let’s show our first auction item!”

As soon as he finished speaking, all the lights in the auction hall went out.

The sudden darkness made everyone a little uncomfortable.

Qin Lu’s eyes lit up. She walked towards Gu Zhou.

As long as she threw herself onto Gu Zhou, when the lights came on, everyone would realize that she was hugging Gu Zhou.

When that happened, she would openly admit that she was Gu Zhou’s girlfriend. Then, she would insist and Gu Zhou would never be able to clear his name.

At the thought of this, Qin Lu’s lips curved into a sinister smile.

When there was about a meter left, Qin Lu couldn’t help but speed up.

Qiao Nian had heard the sound of high heels from the beginning. As everyone was standing on the spot and looking towards the stage, this sound was especially abrupt.

Qiao Nian had always had good hearing, and she was much more vigilant than most people.

Qiao Nian raised her hand. In the next moment, a woman’s cry of pain rang out.

Qiao Nian didn’t let go.

At this moment, the stage suddenly lit up.

Everyone’s exclamations happened to cover Qin Lu’s painful cries.
