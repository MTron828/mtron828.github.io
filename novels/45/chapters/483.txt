Chapter 484: The Identification Results Are Out

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the ward.

Lu Zhu had just woken up but because his body was very weak, he quickly fell asleep again.

Qiao Nian tilted her head and looked at Gu Zhou, who was sitting on the sofa. At this moment, Gu Zhou had also fallen asleep.

Gu Zhou’s frown was clear, as if he was having a nightmare.

Qiao Nian suddenly remembered something. Ever since she left Ghost City and saw Gu Zhou, she had noticed that he looked a little tired.

It was unknown what Gu Zhou had been busy with recently. Qiao Nian thought of the wound on Gu Zhou’s back and frowned.

Gu Zhou must be exhausted from running around with such serious injuries.

Qiao Nian silently took out her phone from her pocket.

Her phone had vibrated earlier, but she did not want to look at it in front of Gu Zhou, so she did not take it out.

Now she finally had a chance.

It was a text from Doctor Sha.

Qiao Nian hurriedly opened it. When she saw the message, her heart was in her throat.

—The results of Dr. Joe’s appraisal are out. They’re with me now. Are you coming over to get them?

Qiao Nian swallowed nervously, her palms covered in cold sweat.

Her heart beat faster and faster, and she was unable to calm down.

Fortunately, Lu Zhu and Gu Zhou were already asleep, so no one saw the strange expression on her face.

Qiao Nian got up quietly and walked towards Doctor Sha’s office.

When Qiao Nian reached the door of the ward, she saw Chen Qing standing guard at the side.

“Chen Qing.”

“What’s wrong, Second Madam?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Go to the nurse’s station and ask for a new quilt. Second Young Master is already asleep now. You can cover him with it so that he won’t catch a cold!”

A smile flickered across Chen Qing’s face.

“Okay.” Chen Qing agreed readily.

This was great. Second Young Madam finally knew how to care about Second Young Master!

Then he wouldn’t be forced to stack tiles because Second Young Master was in a bad mood!

Although tiling looked easy, it was a lot of work. Now he could be addressed respectfully as an old master by his peers.

However, it was so tiring that his back ached every time he stacked the the tiles. The most important thing for a man was his waist. He did not want to lose his waist before he could marry a wife!

As long as Second Young Master was in a good mood, becoming rich overnight was not a dream.

With that thought in mind, Chen Qing walked downstairs happily.

After Chen Qing left, Qiao Nian glanced at the time on her wrist and walked towards Doctor Sha’s office.

When she reached Doctor Sha’s office door, she knocked.

“Please come in!”

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and tried her best to remain calm before walking in.

Seeing Qiao Nian enter, Doctor Sha handed her a brownish-yellow folder.

Qiao Nian looked at the document in her hand with mixed feelings.

She clenched the file in her hand and didn’t open it.

When she had donated blood for Lu Zhu previously, she knew that there was hemolysis between her and Lu Zhu’s blood. She understood that she might be related to Lu Zhu by blood.

But now she felt even more timid.

At this moment, she was holding the identification certificate in her hand and her heart was in a mess.

Qiao Nian felt like she was dreaming.

As long as she opened this folder, she would know how close she was to Lu Zhu.

Based on this result, she would soon be able to zero in on her immediate family.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s nervous expression, Doctor Sha comforted her. “Doctor Qiao, when the results of the appraisal are out, my colleague had already sealed it. I don’t know what the results are. Why don’t I go out first and you take your time alone?”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian nodded, her gaze fixed on the document in her hand.

After Doctor Sha left, Qiao Nian was the only one left in the room.

The room was so quiet that she could hear her heartbeat.

She carefully tore open the sealed file. The sound of it being torn apart broke the silence of the room. She was on edge now.

Qiao Nian took out the evaluation report. She didn’t bother reading the first half of the report, but looked at the bottom.
