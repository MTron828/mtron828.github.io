784 Doubts

In the past, she had only felt that her mother was a little strange. She did not seem like her biological mother. Now, it seemed that there might really be something wrong with her mother.

Although Qiao Nian had never taken care of a child, she had interacted with many mothers during her time in the hospital.

Those who were new mothers would keep their children by their side because they could not sleep well. Every night, they would get up again and again to check on their children, afraid that they would be uncomfortable.

Children didn’t know anything. They might kick the blanket and catch a cold when they fell asleep, or they might fall to the ground because they were crawling around. At this moment, their mothers would have to spend more effort caring for them.

That woman didn’t care about Xiao Shi at all. She let Xiao Shi come here alone and didn’t even take care of Xiao Shi. Was this really something a biological mother would do?

What if that woman was really forced to give birth because of the scheme back then? Then, she would harbor resentment towards the child!

But that didn’t make sense because a person would know when they were three or four months pregnant. She could have taken the opportunity to abort the child. Then she wouldn’t have to raise it.

Since she had chosen to give birth to the children, why did she only take Xiao Shi away, but leave Gu Qi behind?

Could something else have happened after that?

Only after Xiao Shi brought her mother over would she know what had happened.

Qiao Nian and Xiao Shi lay facing each other. Qiao Nian patted Xiao Shi’s back gently and said, “Do you want to hear a bedtime story?”

When he heard Qiao Nian’s words, his heart began to race uncontrollably. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In the past, she had heard from Sister Lingling that there would be bedtime stories before bedtime. At that time, she was especially envious of Sister Lingling. She also wanted her mommy to tell her bedtime stories.

However, when she saw her mommy’s face with tears every day, she no longer dared to make her request.

It had not been easy for Mommy to give birth to her and raise her up. How could she ask for more?

Xiao Shi stared unblinkingly at Aunt Nian Nian. She felt warmth and care from Aunt Nian Nian.

She could especially understand Brother Xiao Qi.

Auntie Nian Nian was too nice, and she was especially gentle. No child would be able to walk away from Auntie Nian Nian’s gentleness.

Qiao Nian thought for a while and suddenly recalled the first time she had met Eldest Senior Brother. That had been especially funny.

At that time, she liked to watch television dramas very much when she was five years old. Her favorite television drama was called Ji Gong.

Every day, Ji Gong would walk around the martial world with an old fan. When Ji Gong encountered someone who was sick, he would put his hand in his sleeve and rub it hard. Soon, a pill would appear. If Ji Gong gave the pill to the patient, the patient would be cured.

Eldest Senior Brother had been sent to the countryside by his family and asked his grandfather to treat his illness. Since he had nothing to do, Eldest Senior Brother had also learned medicine from his grandfather.

One day, she was watching television in her room when she suddenly heard a commotion outside. She hurriedly ran out and saw Eldest Senior Brother lying on the ground.

Eldest Senior Brother’s old illness was acting up again. Someone was giving him first aid.

When Eldest Senior Brother’s asthma flared up, he found it difficult to breathe.

At that time, she recalled the medicine that could cure all illnesses. She hurriedly rolled up her sleeves and began to rub her arms.

She had always thought that the pill made by Ji Gong was just the dust on his arm, so she did the same.

At that time, she had already tried very hard to rub the dust, but she didn’t manage to make any pill.

In the end, she made a small ball of dust. Although this small dust ball was much smaller than Ji Gong’s, the effect should be the same.

Just like that, she walked to Eldest Senior Brother with the small dust ball and prepared to feed it to him. In the end, Eldest Senior Brother fainted.

At that time, she was about to stuff the little dust ball into Eldest Senior Brother’s mouth when her grandfather saw her. He pulled her away and asked her to stand in the courtyard as punishment.

Later on, her grandfather even reprimanded her for a long time because of this.

When Xiao Shi heard this, she laughed happily.
