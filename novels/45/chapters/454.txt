Chapter 455: Cruel Means

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In less than eight minutes, the four men had been paralyzed by the poisonous snakes. One by one, they fell to the ground, their eyes rolling back in their heads as they convulsed.

The people standing at the side couldn’t bear to watch anymore and lowered their heads even more.

This punishment was the punishment that everyone in the ghost city feared the most.

It had to be known that once one was poisoned by a snake, it was equivalent to walking through hell and suffering all kinds of torture in the eighteen levels of hell.

This was nothing. If he died, it would be easier.

However, when the victim was about to approach death, Jiang Chi would still give him the antidote.

He would let them be dragged straight back from the eighteenth level of hell. Let them remember for the rest of their lives what it meant to be in so much pain that they wished they were dead.

Some people would say that it was better to just die. However, when a person really experienced death and came back to life, they would cherish the opportunity to come back to life.

Jiang Chi looked at Xiao Qing that was slithering towards him with satisfaction. Those people were really stupid. They were not as smart as his Xiao Qing.

Jiang Chi’s gaze landed on the woman not far away. The woman instantly understood. Then, she walked to the four of them with a small leather suitcase and took out a syringe to inject the antidote for the snake poison into their bodies.

The four people who had been twitching instantly stopped twitching. Their eyes gradually focused. If they wanted to return to normal, they would need to recuperate for a while.

Although they had been detoxified after being poisoned, every rainy day and winter in the future, their entire bodies would hurt so much that they would wish they were dead.

It was the price for them to disobey Jiang Chi.

Jiang Chi gently stroked Xiao Qing’s head and raised his eyebrows slightly. His gaze landed on Song Yue, who was behind the screen.

“Miss Song, was this scene exciting?”

The servants at the side immediately removed the screen, and Song Yue faced Jiang Chi.

Song Yue was so frightened that her legs went limp. She sat on the ground and looked at Jiang Chi in fear.

This man was simply a demon. He was too terrifying!

Jiang Chi’s gaze landed on Song Yue’s face. It was as if he was not looking at Song Yue but at a piece of trash. He asked, “Now it’s your turn. How do you think I should punish you?”

Song Yue immediately got up and knelt down in front of Jiang Chi. Her eyes were filled with fear as she said with pale lips, “I’m sorry, Mr. Jiang. It’s all my fault. I just wanted to help you bring the Moon Goddess over…”

“And then use my people at will to get rid of a thorn in your side? Hmm?”

Jiang Chi’s last word rose slightly as he looked at Song Yue coldly.

Song Yue was so frightened that her face turned pale. She had not expected Jiang Chi to be such a terrifying person. Actually, she was also very innocent. She just wanted to snatch her man back. What was wrong with that? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If she was wrong, she should have killed Qiao Nian herself, not asked Jiang Chi’s men to do it.

However, Song Yue did not dare to say it out loud.

She knew in her heart that if she said it, all that awaited her was death.

“I’ve already said before that my people have to listen to me. Otherwise, they can only be punished!”

Jiang Chi spoke calmly, as if he had no intention of threatening Song Yue at all.

However, Song Yue was already extremely afraid. Her gaze landed on the green snake in Jiang Chi’s hand, and she was so frightened that tears were flowing out.

Jiang Chi nodded gently at Xiao Qing.

Xiao Qing, who had eaten its fill and was about to rest, suddenly opened her eyes and looked into Song Yue’s eyes.

Song Yue was immediately frightened. Before she could cry out, she saw the green snake slithering towards her.

When the green snake bit Song Yue, it did not attack her hand, but directly bit her lower body.

The tearing pain immediately spread, and Song Yue fainted.
