Chapter 136 Women Aren’t Inferior to Men

Chen Qing’s heart jumped to his throat. He was worried that Qiao Nian would be injured, and even more worried that she would be disfigured.

However, to Chen Qing’s surprise, Qiao Nian had already moved in front of Qiao Shan in the blink of an eye.

Qiao Nian grabbed hold of Qiao Shan’s hand. In a burst of strength, Qiao Shan’s hand was neatly dislocated with a sharp crack. It was so painful that he couldn’t move.

Qiao Shan was in so much pain that he dropped the whip in his hand. His face had gone pale, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.

Chen Qing, who was standing not far away, heaved a sigh of relief. Only then did he remember how Madam had dealt neatly with everyone at Matriarch Shen’s birthday banquet.

Madam was truly a heroine! She was the epitome of the statement: Women aren’t inferior to men.

Qiao Xin, who was standing not far away, was utterly stunned by this scene. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief, muttering, “Qiao Nian, are you crazy? How dare you hit Mom and Dad? Aren’t you afraid that the heavens will punish you? You’ll be struck by lightning!”

“Why won’t I dare to hit them?” Qiao Nian glared daggers at Qiao Xin, frightening Qiao Xin so much that she took two steps back. “Even if the gods choose to dole out punishment, the rest of you will be the first to be struck by lightning. You don’t deserve to be a parent if you didn’t bother raising your own children. From now on, I’ll no longer have anything to do with you!”

In terms of science, she probably wasn’t a biological daughter of the Qiao family!

In terms of kinship and affection, the other members of the Qiao family had always treated her extremely coldly. They had never cared for her.

Suppressing his pain, Qiao Shan put on his head-of-the-house voice and roared, “How dare you?”

“Why not?”

A cold voice rang from the side, the tone raising at the second word. The contempt was very obvious.

Everyone looked over and saw Gu Zhou walking over, wearing a well-fitted suit. Gu Zhou had arrived!

Chen Qing looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. Previously, on the phone, Second Young Master hadn’t seemed to care much about Madam’s affairs, yet he had rushed over in such a short time. This was simply unbelievable!

Gu Zhou walked up to Qiao Nian, shielding her behind him. His eyes swept coldly across everyone present as he said, “Let’s see who dares to go against anything I say today.”

It was just a simple sentence, but Gu Zhou’s aura was so powerful and overbearing that one couldn’t help but feel afraid. His voice made one feel as if submission was the only option.

Qiao Shan’s hand was aching terribly, but at this moment, he was so frightened by Gu Zhou’s aura that he forgot about the pain. Fury burned in his chest, and his expression darkened to the extreme.

Gu Zhou was clearly looking down on the Qiao family.

Holding a tissue, Su Xue wiped the dust and mud off her face. Her face turned pale, and she couldn’t say a word of rebuke.

Qiao Xin stood not far away, her body trembling non-stop. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to protect Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou smelled faintly of medicinal herbs. For some reason, that aroma was strangely pleasing

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to arrive so soon either. She looked up at Gu Zhou and asked, “Have you finished discussing all the details regarding the research institute?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he turned to look at her. Instead of answering her immediately, he studied her carefully.

Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s concerned gaze, and a warm smile appeared in her eyes.

Gu Zhou raised his hand and gently removed a leaf on Qiao Nian’s head. In the next moment, he turned around, his expression dark. He glared coldly at Qiao Shan and his wife, his brow furrowed. “What have you done to my wife? How dare you bully her when I’m not around?”

Qiao Xin: “?”

Su Xue: “?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Shan: “??!!!”

Heavens, who exactly was bullying whom?

Chen Qing, who was standing not far away, forcibly repressed his laughter. In the end, he simply couldn’t hold back any longer. He turned to the side and secretly laughed.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Actually, Qiao Nian really wanted to say that she wasn’t a porcelain doll. She wasn’t that delicate or fragile.

When she fought with Qiao Shan just now, she had already gotten what she wanted.

Su Xue stepped forward with a smile. Her face was dirty, but even so, there was a flattering smile on her face.

Now that Qiao Nian had married into the Gu family, she didn’t want to lose this money tree.

“Second Young Master, you’ve really misunderstood us. We just had a small conflict just now. I spent ten months pregnant with Nian Nian before giving birth to her. How could I bully her? Don’t misunderstand.”
