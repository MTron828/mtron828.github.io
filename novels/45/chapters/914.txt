915 Facing Difficulties

Xiao Shi had heard Song Man mention this before. She nodded and said, “I think Daddy and Mommy were schemed against and got together. After that, the two of them separated. That was when Mommy had us in her stomach!”

Gu Qi roughly understood why his mommy didn’t acknowledge them. He sighed helplessly and said, “Mommy might hate Dad!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When she heard Gu Qi’s words, she gasped. She grabbed Gu Qi’s hand and asked impatiently, “Brother, what should we do? We have to let Daddy and Mommy be together.”

“We should let Mommy forget the pain of the past and walk out of it. That way, when Dad and Mommy are together, our family will be reunited!” Gu Qi said seriously.

!!

Xiao Shi felt that Gu Qi’s words made sense and nodded seriously. She had to make her parents happy together. That way, their family of four could live happily together.

“Brother, what should we do now?” Xiao Shi asked eagerly.

When Gu Qi heard Xiao Shi’s words, he frowned again. After thinking for a long time, he said, “How about this? Let’s keep Mommy at home first. Only then will Dad have a chance to talk to Mommy properly. The two of them might be able to bury the hatchet!”

“Yes!” Xiao Shi nodded solemnly, as if she was about to face a life-and-death matter.

Gu Qi said with a serious expression, “As long as we keep Mommy here, not only will we have a father, but we will also have a mother. We will be the happiest children in the world, so we have to work hard to keep Dad and Mommy!”

Xiao Shi nodded in agreement. The two little heads leaned together and began to discuss the specific plan.

…

Qiao Nian walked into the medicinal room. She took out her phone and sent Qin Chuan a message.

“How’s the investigation on Song Man’s family?”

Soon, Qin Chuan replied, “We’ve found out that Song Man was adopted. The person who adopted her is called Wang Yue.”

When Qiao Nian saw the words “Wang Yue”, she was slightly stunned. Could it be that Qin Chuan was referring to the old lady she had seen at the cemetery today?

“Anything about Song Man’s adoptive parents?” Qiao Nian looked curious.

“Wang Yue’s son and daughter-in-law had been together for five years, but they had no children. The two of them often quarreled. In order to ease their relationship, Wang Yue brought back a baby from somewhere else. That baby was Song Man. Not only did Song Man’s appearance not make her son and daughter-in-law reconcile, but it also made her son and daughter-in-law have a divorce. After her son and daughter-in-law divorced, they married other people. After that, Song Man no longer had anyone to take care of her, so Wang Yue took her in.”

Seeing this message, Qiao Nian’s expression darkened.

According to the information Qin Chuan had found, Song Man had no status at all with her adoptive parents. Only Wang Yue cared about her.

It seemed that it was impossible for such adoptive parents to help Song Man with a bone marrow transplant.

Qiao Nian’s mind raced. It seemed that she had to investigate Song Man’s biological parents.

“Go and investigate Song Man’s biological parents.” After Qiao Nian sent the message, she put her phone aside.

She walked to the medicine cabinet and began to organize the herbs.

Matriarch Gu and Gu Zhou’s pills were almost done. She had to prepare them in advance.

By the time she was done, three hours had passed.

Qiao Nian placed the pills she had made into white porcelain bottles and labeled each bottle in case she made a mistake.

She stood in front of the experiment table and looked at the remaining herbs on the table in a daze.

Now, Xiao Shi’s issues had been resolved and Gu Qi no longer refused to communicate with others.

Everything was going well.

Other than her relationship with Gu Zhou.

She didn’t know how to face Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Logically speaking, she should hate Gu Zhou.

However, Gu Zhou had saved her in the past. Moreover, when that incident happened, Gu Zhou was a victim.

She couldn’t help but be in a difficult situation.
