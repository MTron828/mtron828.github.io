1162 Disobeying her?

Lu Jiang continued, “She’s still our sister. She can live however she wants. Even if she causes a huge disaster, our Lu family will still take responsibility for her. What has this got to do with you? You’ve always been a servant hired by the Lu family to help our family. How can you speak in the ancestral hall?”

The ancestral hall was very quiet. One could hear the sound of candles burning and everyone breathing!

Auntie Cao looked at Lu Jiang with red-rimmed eyes. In the past, Fourth Young Master respected her the most. Now, Fourth Young Master had actually disobeyed her for Fifth Miss and said such ugly words!

Auntie Cao’s heart instantly turned cold. She had personally raised these young ladies and young masters. When she was young, they would still call her Mother Cao.

She really treated Young Master and Young Mistress as her own children. She had sacrificed so much, but she did not expect them to want to fall out with her now.

Auntie Cao said with red-rimmed eyes, “I’m clearly doing this for Fifth Miss’s sake. Indulging her blindly isn’t good for her. I hoped that Fifth Miss could bear the responsibility of being the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Why is it actually my fault now?”

She had been thinking for the sake of the Lu family, but they were scolding her!

Auntie Cao’s eyes grew even redder. Tears welled up in her eyes.

Lu Rao raised his eyebrows slightly and crossed his arms. He questioned lazily, “You followed Xiao Yu to the production team a few times. Do you think you can be an actress now? You even added many scenes for yourself!”

Auntie Cao looked at Lu Rao in despair. She could understand every word he said, but why couldn’t she understand when she connected them?

Auntie Cao looked at Song Yu for help, but she realized that Song Yu was also frowning at her, as if she was unhappy.

She still didn’t understand what she had said wrong. Everyone was dissatisfied with her!

Lu Rao stood there and continued, “Ever since we were young, you’ve brought us up. We also respect you very much and treat you as an elder. All of this is because you took care of us and treated Grandma well”

Lu Rao’s eyes gradually darkened as he enunciated each word clearly. “But it’s your duty to do things well. You’re taking the Lu family’s salary, and you’re just a servant of the Lu family. We respect you because we know how to be grateful, but it doesn’t mean that you can be our elder without restraint and lecture my sister. You should recognize your identity!”

Auntie Cao’s heart instantly sank. Did Lu Rao mean that they would never respect her again?

Why could she control them when they were young, but not now? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She had still not changed. Only the young masters had changed!

However, Auntie Cao was a little flustered. She explained anxiously, “Third Young Master, you’ve misunderstood. Actually, I’m not”

Auntie Cao shook her head and said in a panic, “I didn’t”

“But in my opinion, you did. You said that the eldest daughter of the Lu family doesn’t know the rules. Who dares to say that our eldest daughter doesn’t know the rules? We want her to do whatever she wants. Girls should live more freely. Otherwise, they might be bullied by someone like you who takes advantage of their seniority! If you don’t want to work here anymore, just get lost immediately!”

Auntie Cao’s tears fell sadly. Lu Rao’s words were like a dagger stabbing into her heart. It hurt terribly, but it was also like a slap to her face.

Auntie Cao explained tearfully, “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry. I really didn’t mean that. I didn’t want to”

“Third Brother has already made it very clear. Don’t you understand human language anymore?” Lu Nian asked with a dark expression.
