“Sister Qiao Nian, I’m just a little smart.” Lu Qi lowered her head, looking terrified.

Qiao Nian had just heard Lu Qi call him “Brother”. She didn’t know which brother Lu Qi was referring to. Everyone only knew that there was Young Master Lu Zhu in the Lu family. As for the other young masters of the Lu family, others had heard of them but never seen them.

Coupled with Lu Qi’s frightened expression, Qiao Nian felt that Lu Qi was frightened.

Lu Qi had never encountered such a thing in the past, so she was terrified. If Lu Qi’s fear did not dissipate now, she would probably have nightmares often in the future and develop a mental illness.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian parked the car by the roadside and gently held Lu Qi’s hand. “Don’t be afraid. The bad person has already been chased away. You’re very safe now!”

You’re safe now!

These words dissipated some of the uneasiness in Lu Qi’s heart. She looked up at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s simple and crude method made He Cheng fall flat on his face, and made him flee.

Lu Qi’s eyes turned red uncontrollably, and tears welled up in her eyes.

She was already eighteen years old. After almost experiencing a kidnapping, she was terrified and trembling!

Fortunately, Sister Qiao Nian appeared and saved her from the bad people!

But what about her sister, who had been kidnapped at the age of three?

Lu Qi’s tears fell uncontrollably.

She was young. After she was born, she had always heard from her family that she had a sister who had been kidnapped and killed by bad people.

Her sister was only three years old at that time. She had experienced such a terrifying thing.

Before she was kidnapped, she felt that her sister was very pitiful. She missed her sister, but she had never been in her shoes. She had never thought about how terrified and desperate her sister must have been back then.

If only a hero like Sister Qiao Nian had appeared back then. It would have been fine as long as she could get Sister out of the hands of the bad people.

But there were no ifs.

Lu Qi lowered her head. Her tears fell uncontrollably, drop by drop onto the back of her hand.

The thought of her sister being locked up in a small black room and dismembered alive made her heart ache unbearably.

Seeing that Lu Qi was crying, Qiao Nian picked up a tissue and gently wiped her tears. She comforted her gently, “Don’t be afraid. It’s in the past. No one can hurt you. You’re very safe now.”

“Sister Qiao Nian.” Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian with teary eyes and said tearfully, “I miss Sister…”

Qiao Nian instantly thought that Lu Qi was thinking about Song Yu.

Qiao Nian felt a trace of loneliness, but she quickly understood.

In Lu Qi’s opinion, Song Yu had accompanied her for eighteen years, so it was normal for Lu Qi to miss Song Yu when something happened.

Qiao Nian couldn’t bear for Lu Qi to be too sad. She hurriedly suggested, “Why don’t you call Miss Song?”

Lu Qi shook her head, her high ponytail swaying left and right with her movements. She sniffled hard and said with red-rimmed eyes, “Am I talking about Sister Song Yu?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She thought that Lu Qi was talking about the cousins of the Lu family. She didn’t know much about the Lu family, nor did she know about them. “Then call her?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Sister Qiao Nian.” Lu Qi sniffled, tears hanging on her eyelashes. She tried hard to remain calm. “I’m talking about my kidnapped sister, the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian…”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat, then began to race. She had never expected Lu Qi to be thinking about her.

After Lu Qi finished speaking, she instantly cried again. Her nose was a little red and swollen. “Sister Qiao Nian, you saved me this time, so I can sit here safely. But what about my sister? She was only three years old when she was kidnapped. She didn’t know anything. At that time, was she very helpless and afraid? Before she died, was she in despair?”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, her heart ached. Lu Qi had brought her into the picture, which was why she was so sad.

“Why did those bad people do that? My sister was only three years old. She’s at the age of innocence. Why did those bad people treat her like that? Why weren’t any good people around there to save her? I…”
