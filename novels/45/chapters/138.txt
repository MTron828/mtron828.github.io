Chapter 139 Qiao Xin Wants to Fight Back

Hatred flashed in Qiao Xin’s eyes as she glared viciously at Qiao Nian. If looks could kill, Qiao Nian would have died a thousand times over.

The sound of the slap rang out, so loud that it might have reached the ends of the earth. Su Xue’s heart began to race. She hurriedly pulled Qiao Xin over and said with heartache, “Oh my god! Xinxin, turn around. Let Mom take a look!”

Qiao Xin stood rooted to the ground, glaring at Qiao Nian with resentment written all over her face.

She was the precious daughter of the Qiao family. In the past, her life had always been smooth-sailing. However, this morning, Qiao Nian had ruined her reputation in front of all the big shots in the medical field. Now, she had even slapped her in public.

The humiliation was so great that she couldn’t even cry. She could only glare at Qiao Nian indignantly, full of rage.

Qiao Nian stood there calmly. She gently blew on her palm and looked up, the epitome of casualness. “If you’re indignant, then hit me back.”

Qiao Xin clenched her fists tightly. How could Qiao Nian hit and scold her whenever she wanted? Qiao Nian was clearly a bastard child. That’s right, Qiao Nian was a bastard!

Qiao Nian’s mother was a country bumpkin, a woman who amounted to nothing!

The more Qiao Xin thought about it, the angrier she became. She was the precious daughter of the Qiao family. She belonged among the elite, while Qiao Nian was just a contemptible woman of low status. Why should she allow Qiao Nian to bully her?

Qiao Xin’s eyes burned with rage. She raised her hand and aimed a slap at Qiao Nian’s face.

Then, her hand was grabbed by Gu Zhou in midair.

Gu Zhou exerted strength with his ten fingers.

Crack!

Immediately following that was the sound of a wrist being dislocated, followed by Qiao Xin’s tragic scream Gu Zhou let go with a disdainful expression.

Qiao Xin staggered back in pain, almost passing out from the agony.

When Qiao Shan and Su Xue heard Qiao Xin scream, their hearts ached. They yearned to bear the pain in Qiao Xin’s stead.

Gu Zhou took out a tissue and wiped his hands slowly. Then, he threw the tissue aside in disdain, as if there was something dirty on it.

There was a dangerous glint in Gu Zhou’s eyes. His gaze swept over the three members of the Qiao family. Turning to Qiao Nian, he said, “Go on.”

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, the three Qiao family members stood rooted to the ground in fear, not daring to move.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Chen Qing’s heart surged with emotion. He felt that Second Young Master and Madam were simply carved from the same mold.

The two of them were truly a well-matched couple!

Just now, Madam had also dislocated Qiao Shan’s wrist, displaying her powerful personality.

For the rest of his life, he would refuse to take anyone else to be Young Madam Gu!

Seeing Qiao Nian flex her wrist, as if she was really going to hit everyone, Qiao Shan couldn’t help but panic.

If Qiao Nian really slapped him, he would be thoroughly embarrassed today.

This wouldn’t do. This wouldn’t do at all. He had to take control of the situation. He would deal with Qiao Nian slowly when he had the chance in the future.

At the thought of this, Qiao Shan’s tone softened. A flattering smile appeared on his face as he spoke, attempting to persuade her. “Nian Nian, does your hand hurt? We’re all family. How can we hurt each other? By the law of action and reaction, your hand will hurt when you hit other people! Be good, listen to Dad. Don’t hit anyone again. By the way, you won’t have to move those plants back home anymore.”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Shan’s words, she snorted. “Those plants had nothing to do with you in the first place. You took my things, yet you’re pretending to be generous. If not you, who else would I hit?”

“Nian Nian, listen to Dad. Dad won’t harm you. You…”

Before Qiao Shan could finish speaking, Qiao Nian slapped him hard across the face.

Qiao Shan’s eyes widened. He touched his burning cheek and looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

Oh my god. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qiao Nian was truly rebelling.

His legs gave way. How dare Qiao Nian hit him, her father!

This was the first time in Qiao Shan’s life that he had been slapped by someone. Moreover, it was by Qiao Nian, this wretched, worthless girl.
