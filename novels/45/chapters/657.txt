Chapter 658: Sophistry

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Stealing was immoral to begin with.

Su Sheng didn’t want to say anything more, but Qiao Nian had gone too far. She couldn’t help but ask coldly, “Miss Qiao, you’ve really disappointed me. I thought that you were also a fan of Mr. Dong Hua and that the two of us could be good friends, but I never expected you to do something so despicable as stealing.”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Sheng’s words, she looked at him coldly and asked, “You said that I stole something. Then what did you see me steal? Without any evidence, I can sue you for slander.”

Su Sheng was a psychiatrist. Sometimes, she would help the police judge cases. Her role was to observe the interrogated prisoners so that she could determine if they were telling the truth.

She had seen many prisoners, and she had seen some like Qiao Nian, who looked calm and didn’t admit to the mistakes she had made.

It wasn’t until the police brought the evidence to them that the prisoners had to admit their past mistakes.

Su Sheng gasped and questioned, “Didn’t you play this song just now? If you didn’t steal Mr. Dong Hua’s score, how could you have played it?”

Hearing Su Sheng’s words, Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her eyes filled with confusion.

Gu Qing stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. For some reason, she felt that Qiao Nian wasn’t lying. Moreover, she didn’t think Qiao Nian was the kind of person who stole things.

If Qiao Nian really stole something, as long as Ah Nian pulled up the surveillance video, there would be evidence of Qiao Nian stealing.

Since Qiao Nian wasn’t afraid of the surveillance video, it could only mean one thing. Qiao Nian hadn’t stolen anything at all.

If Qiao Nian didn’t steal anything, how did she play Ah Nian’s tune?

Could there be a misunderstanding?

Gu Qing frowned slightly.

She seemed to have heard the song Qiao Nian had played somewhere before, but she couldn’t remember where.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, Su Sheng thought that she had stepped on Qiao Nian’s tail. She snorted. “What else do you have to say? I’ll call the police now and send you to the police station!”

“Shut up!”

Su Sheng was slightly stunned. He looked up and saw Lu Nian looking at her with a dark expression. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lu Nian’s voice was not gentle at all, not giving Su Sheng any face.

Su Sheng was stunned. She had never expected Mr. Dong Hua to look at her with such disgust. The thief was clearly Qiao Nian.

What had she said wrong? What had she done wrong?

She had clearly been helping him!

Why would Mr. Dong Hua be fierce to a true fan of his for a thief like Qiao Nian?

Su Sheng felt a little uncomfortable. Her nose felt sore, and her eyes were a little red. She asked in disbelief, “Mr. Dong Hua, actually, I…”

“Do you not understand human language? Or is your intelligence limited?” Lu Nian’s eyes grew colder and colder, interrupting Su Sheng mercilessly.

Tears welled up in Su Sheng’s eyes, and her face turned as pale as paper.

She felt very aggrieved.

She was a true fan of Mr. Dong Hua and had always sought justice for him. However, she had never expected Mr. Dong Hua to mock her for Qiao Nian.

Su Sheng finally understood. Qiao Nian didn’t have any other abilities, but her ability to seduce and steal was top-notch.

That made sense. No one would let others insult their girlfriend.

Su Sheng understood this and sneered. She turned to the side and wiped the tears from her eyes.

Although she had lost, she didn’t feel embarrassed. Qiao Nian had used her body to rope in those men. This kind of behavior was what she hated the most.

Men were all animals who thought with their lower bodies. However, Su Sheng’s fantasy of her idol, Mr. Dong Hua, was completely shattered.

She had thought that Mr. Dong Hua, who could see through the coldness and warmth of the world, would be more self aware.

So that was all.

She had decided that she would never like Mr. Dong Hua again. She only liked Mr. Dong Hua’s music.
