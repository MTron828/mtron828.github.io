Seeing that the conversation had ended, Qiao Nian secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Hence, she asked, “What do you want to eat at noon? I’ll get someone to prepare it now.”

“Anything is fine.”

Gu Zhou looked at Lu Zhu meaningfully and said, “I’m not picky.”

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face. She couldn’t help but add, “You need to recover now. You can’t eat random food. You need to eat something nutritious. That way, your body will recover better.”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian gently. His voice was very gentle as he said, “Okay, I’ll listen to you.”

Qiao Nian nodded and smiled. “Okay.”

Gu Zhou looked at the two of them and the strange feeling in his heart became more and more obvious. The two of them interacted very naturally as if they had been together for a long time.

He frowned slightly. He clenched his fists so hard that his knuckles showed. Frustrated, he walked out of the ward.

As soon as he walked out of the ward, he saw Chen Qing walking over from afar. When Chen Qing walked up to him, he asked, “Is everything done?”

Chen Qing noticed that the Second Young Master’s voice was very low and cold. He involuntarily tensed up and tried his best to suppress his trembling heart. He nodded and said, “Yes, it’s all done.”

Today, Second Young Master was in a bad mood and not to be trifled with!

Gu Zhou said, “Book a flight back to An City now!”

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. Was it that urgent?

Moreover, Second Young Master had previously said that he would wait for news from MY. Should he go back now?

Did Second Young Master not care about Eldest Young Master’s news anymore?

Seeing that Chen Qing had not moved, Gu Zhou frowned and asked, “What are you waiting for?”

Chen Qing quickly took out his phone and started to buy plane tickets online. He was worried that if he was any later, he might be left behind at MY to put up tiles.

“And Lu Zhu’s plane ticket!”

“Yes.”

Chen Qing was very efficient. Two minutes later, Chen Qing said respectfully, “Second Young Master, the flight is at four this afternoon. After Mr. Lu is discharged, we can go straight to the airport!”

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, his brows furrowed even more tightly, as if he was not satisfied with this result. He frowned, and his eyes were filled with coldness as he asked, “According to you, we still have to have lunch before we can leave?”

Chen Qing was speechless.

How anxious was Second Young Master? He was not even willing to wait for lunch?

Chen Qing swallowed nervously and said carefully, “Second Young Master, Doctor Sha said that Mr. Lu can only be discharged at that time. If you really want to go back early, why don’t I change our flight timing and leave in an hour?”

Gu Zhou gave Chen Qing a cold look and questioned, “Are we going to leave her and Lu Zhu alone happily?”

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. For some reason, he felt that Second Young Master’s words had another meaning.

Of course, Chen Qing went along with Gu Zhou’s words. If he said anything wrong, he would have to stay at MY and put up tiles. “Then, then we’ll go back with Mr. Lu!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he received the Second Young Master’s cold gaze and heard his slightly angry voice.

“I think you’re more suited to put up tiles!”

Chen Qing’s eyes widened uncontrollably as he looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. Then, he lowered his head and did not dare to speak anymore.

Nothing will go wrong if he talked less!

As long as he didn’t say anything, he probably wouldn’t be sent to put up tiles…

It was time for lunch.

The attendant brought over all the takeout.

Qiao Nian hurriedly called out to Lu Zhu and Gu Zhou. Smiling, she said, “Brother Zhu, Gu Zhou, Chen Qing, come and eat!”

Standing at the door, Chen Qing’s eyelids twitched uncontrollably, and he felt slightly uneasy.
