“Yes,” Chen Qing said nervously.

Qiao Nian’s eyes darted around as if she had thought of something. She asked, “Is the place you’re living in close to me?”

Chen Qing said without thinking, “Not far. About 20 kilometers.”

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Since Gu Zhou had already returned, why hadn’t he come looking for her in the first place?

She recalled what Chen Qing had just said. Gu Zhou was in a bad mood and had been cooped up in the house.

So what happened?

Previously, Gu Zhou left because he saw the video of someone knocking Qiao Xin unconscious and taking her away. Could it be related to that man?

Qiao Nian knew that she wouldn’t be able to figure it out even if she thought about it this way. Hence, she frowned and said, “Alright, send me your location now. I’ll look for you.”

“Yes, ma’am,” Chen Qing said, nodding.

After Qiao Nian hung up, her heart was in a mess. Worried that something would happen to Gu Zhou, she took out her phone and called him.

Beep—

Beep—

Beep—

After three rings, a cold female voice suddenly came from the phone.

“I’m sorry, the number you have dialed is unavailable. Please try again later!”

When Qiao Nian heard this voice, she suddenly panicked. Unwilling to give up, she called Gu Zhou again. However, it was still a cold female voice.

She prayed that Gu Zhou would be able to answer the call and suppress his personality as Zhou Zhou and wake up.

She quickly put on her clothes and prepared to leave. Her phone was still switched off.

Qiao Nian didn’t give up. As she continued making calls, she put on her clothes and shoes and went out. When she reached the door, she opened it and saw Gu Zhou sitting dejectedly by her door.

He was soaking wet and curled up in a ball. His hair was wet. Water dripped onto the floor and quickly disappeared.

Qiao Nian hurriedly walked up to him and saw that his head was buried in his knees. The phone screen in his hand was broken and covered in rain water.

“Gu… Zhou Zhou?” Qiao Nian called out.

She didn’t even know when Gu Zhou arrived at her place. Why didn’t he knock?

Hearing Qiao Nian’s voice, Gu Zhou raised his head and stared at her intently. He closed his eyes, and the rainwater from his eyelashes slid down his cheeks.

His lips were pale and he looked in terrible shape.

He blinked, a hint of fear appearing in his eyes. He hesitated for a moment before saying, “Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou wants to make a call, but the phone isn’t obedient.”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback.

Gu Zhou handed the phone to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s heart ached when she saw this. She held Gu Zhou’s hand hesitantly, her voice filled with gentleness. “Why didn’t you knock?”

Gu Zhou didn’t say anything. He just held Qiao Nian’s hand.

Qiao Nian was really helpless. She had no way of explaining to Gu Zhou’s second personality what had happened.

He probably doesn’t even know how he got here. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

At this thought, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but hold Gu Zhou’s hand tightly, wanting to warm his cold hand.

Fortunately, Gu Zhou was fine, and she gradually felt more at ease.

Qiao Nian pulled Gu Zhou inside and said with a smile, “Alright, go in and take a shower. Don’t catch a cold again.”

She pulled him toward the room, then closed the door. Automatically, she released his hand and headed for the bathroom.

At this moment, Gu Zhou quickly walked forward and hugged Qiao Nian from behind.

Qiao Nian was stunned. She could feel Gu Zhou’s muscles through his clothes.

She didn’t move again.

Although Zhou Zhou spoke and acted like a child, he was still a normal man.

After a while, Qiao Nian said tentatively, “Zhou Zhou, I’m…”

“Nian Nian, don’t leave the Zhou Zhou again!” Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian.
