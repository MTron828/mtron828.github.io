“Stop right there. Who are you and what do you do?” One of the Interpol officers asked coldly.

Cui Yong looked at him calmly and said, “I’m here to change my patient’s dressing.”

Interpol sized up Cui Yong carefully, then checked Doctor Wen Song’s work pass. They asked Cui Yong to take off his mask. Seeing that his work pass was identical to his, they turned their attention to the medical cart.

They examined the car inside and out, but found no dangerous items or guns. They continued to examine Cui Yong.

Cui Yong asked in confusion, “Do police officers have to be so strict? I’m his doctor. I’m just here for a ward round.”

“This is a special situation. If someone wants to kill the victim, we can only follow the rules and procedures!” the Interpol officer said calmly. They did not find any guns or dangerous items on Cui Yong’s body, so they opened the door and let him in. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Cui Yong smiled and said, “You’ve worked hard.” Only then did he push the medical cart into the ward. The moment he entered, he saw Gu Zhou on the hospital bed not far away. There was also a woman lying on the small bed beside Gu Zhou.

Cui Yong frowned. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be in the ward as well. Fortunately, Qiao Nian was sleeping now, so he could take the opportunity to do something.

He placed the small cart at the door and held a syringe in his hand. He walked in quietly. When he walked to the bed, he looked at Gu Zhou’s face and smiled smugly.

He really hadn’t expected him to complete such a difficult task so easily. If Old Master Cui knew that he had personally killed Gu Zhou, he would definitely reward him. He might even pull him into the core.

He inserted the needle into the IV bottle.

“What are you doing?”

A female voice suddenly came from the side.

His hand trembled, and he tried hard to remain calm as he looked at Qiao Nian. In Doctor Wen Song’s voice, he said, “I want to add another medicine to the patient.”

With that, he injected the medicine in the syringe into Gu Zhou’s IV bottle.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed. She pulled out the needle in Gu Zhou’s hand and kicked Cui Yong to the side. She pointed a pistol at Cui Yong. “Who exactly are you? Who asked you to come?”

Cui Yong’s heart was in a mess. He didn’t understand what was wrong with him. Why did Qiao Nian know at a glance that he wasn’t a doctor?

When the two Interpol officers outside heard Qiao Nian’s voice, they hurriedly walked in. When they saw Qiao Nian pointing a gun at the doctor, their eyes were filled with confusion.

“I’m Doctor Wen Song,” Cui Yong said calmly, slowly standing up.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s vigilant expression, the police officer who had just examined Cui Yong hurriedly explained, “Miss Qiao, this is Mr. Gu’s attending doctor, Doctor Wen Song. Hurry up and put down the gun.”

Cui Yong didn’t know what flaw he had, but he immediately ran out.

Without hesitation, Qiao Nian shot Cui Yong in the leg. Cui Yong screamed.

“Ah!”

Cui Yong’s scream was so loud that it seemed to wake up all the patients and family members on the entire floor. A few nurses ran over from outside.

Qiao Nian walked up to Cui Yong, took out a silver needle, and knocked him out.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s series of actions, the Interpol officer was stunned.

The young Interpol officer, Allen, walked up to Qiao Nian and said seriously, “Miss Qiao, you shot someone casually. This is against the law.”

Without even looking at Allen, Qiao Nian took off the mask on Cui Yong’s face. When he saw the unfamiliar face, he understood.

Those people must have refused to give up and wanted to disguise themselves as doctors to sneak in and kill Gu Zhou.

Suppressing her anger, Qiao Nian said to Allen coldly, “This person isn’t Doctor Wen Song at all. He’s pretending!”

Allen looked at Qiao Nian in confusion, then at the doctor lying on the ground. “But the photo on his work pass is identical to his.”
