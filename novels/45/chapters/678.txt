Chapter 679: Investigation

No, Gu Zhou might really like her. It might be similar to the friendship between good friends.

Like and love were very different.

After thinking this through, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She pointed at the villa and said, “Let’s go in!”

The two of them walked side by side towards the villa.

Although Qiao Nian understood what Gu Zhou meant, she was still extremely nervous. She pursed her lips tightly.

She stole a glance at Gu Zhou, who was standing beside her.

Under the moonlight, he seemed to be enveloped in a layer of soft light, looking much gentler.

It felt like time had passed peacefully.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.

She turned to look at Gu Zhou.

If only.

If she hadn’t experienced that despairing night five years ago, she might really have fallen for Gu Zhou.

But there were no ifs in this world.

That night five years ago was like a parasite, wrapped tightly around her.

She was struggling in pain, but she couldn’t free herself.

She needed time now. Only when she got over the trauma of five years ago could she start a relationship.

From the corner of his eye, Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian. She looked very depressed.

His frown deepened. She must want to leave him because of Gu Chuan.

At this moment, Gu Zhou’s phone began to ring.

He took out his phone and saw that it was a call from Chen Qing.

Gu Zhou stopped in his tracks. Seeing Qiao Nian walk into the house, he turned around and walked in another direction before answering the call.

“Second Master.”

“Shoot.”

“I didn’t dare to rest during this period of time. I finally found information about Gu Chuan,” Chen Qing said respectfully.

Gu Zhou walked to the small pavilion in the garden and sat down. His eyes lit up slightly.

He wanted to see who would dare to have designs on his woman.

“I found out about the first person named Gu Chuan. He was fifty-two years old this year and already had a grandson. However, he died in a car accident the day before yesterday.”

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, he raised his eyebrows slightly. His voice grew colder and colder as he said angrily, “I think you still want to clean the toilet!”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, his expression changed slightly.

He hadn’t done anything. He just wanted to use the elimination method to help Second Young Master eliminate Second Young Madam’s sweetheart!

Chen Qing hurriedly said, “There are four others. Their ages match.”

“Yeah.”

“The first person called Gu Chuan is a teacher. He’s 30 years old this year and has never been married. Someone once said that he often goes to gay places!”

Gu Zhou took a deep breath, his expression instantly turning cold. He asked, “Do you think she’s willing to be with him?”

Chen Qing was so frightened that he broke out in a cold sweat. He explained. “I heard that this Gu Chuan used to have a girlfriend. Later on, he seemed to be pursued by his good friend, so he dumped his girlfriend and got together with his good friend. I just think that when he didn’t like men in the past, it’s very likely that he knew Second Young Madam!”

Chen Qing felt that Second Master was looking for trouble. Perhaps Madam had just casually said a name back then, but Second Master had remembered it.

“The other Gu Chuan is 26 years old this year and is a doctor. Two years ago, he already married his childhood sweetheart!”

Gu Zhou drummed his fingers on the table impatiently. “Do you think she’s willing to be a mistress?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“There’s more, there’s more.” Worried that he would clean the toilet for the rest of his life, Chen Qing hurriedly said, “There’s also another Gu Chuan. He’s 25 years old this year. He’s a graduate student in medicine and is single.”

A graduate student in medicine?

Twenty-five?

Single?

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes. It seemed that this person was very likely to be the person in her heart.

“However, I found out that he once plagiarized Second Young Madam’s thesis. He was even sued by Second Young Madam!” Chen Qing continued.

“Do you think she’ll take a liking to someone who’s inferior to her and stole her results?” Gu Zhou’s patience was about to run out.

Chen Qing shrunk his neck and said carefully, “There’s also someone else called Gu Chuan, but I don’t think he’s the one. He’s a playboy who likes both men and women. I think he was diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease some time ago!”
