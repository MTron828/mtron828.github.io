Chapter 179 Complimenting Me?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian felt that Gu Zhou was really too shallow. He clearly didn’t know the importance of art and music in cultivating one’s mind and soul. Moreover, he wasn’t aware of the value of an acceptance letter to the music academy.

She gave Gu Zhou a disdainful look and said, “You’re an outsider of the music field. You don’t know anything. You’re not qualified to give your opinion!”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. He stood up and left the room. When he returned, he handed a document to Qiao Nian.

Puzzled, Qiao Nian took the document from him and opened it, still gazing at Gu Zhou in confusion. However, when she saw a graduation certificate from An City’s Academy of Music, she felt as if she had been struck by lightning

Damn!

This weak, delicate husband of hers was actually an academic tyrant!

What Qiao Nian found most unbelievable was that Gu Zhou had specialized in the guqin as well. She was so shocked that she couldn’t move. This was her favorite instrument.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou’s hands. His fingers were long, slender and well-defined. Indeed, they were suitable for playing the guqin. “Why don’t I give you a recommendation?” As Gu Zhou spoke, he put the certificate away and looked at Qiao Nian with interest.

Qiao Nian sat there. While she looked calm, tumultuous waves of emotion were rising and crashing in her heart.

Outstanding graduates of the Academy of Music were all qualified to recommend someone to study at the academy.

Gu Zhou happened to have this privilege.

Silently, Qiao Nian shifted closer to Gu Zhou, staring unblinkingly at the certificate in Gu Zhou’s hand. If she had a tail, it would definitely be wagging excitedly.

Qiao Nian was now nearly leaning against Gu Zhou. Fortunately, she knew her limits. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face and she smiled in a fawning manner. “Yes please!”

If she had Gu Zhou’s recommendation, coupled with Lu Zhu’s recommendation letter as the principal, the chances of her getting accepted into the music academy would increase significantly. However, Qiao Nian was still rational. She tried hard to calm down and asked, “There… there aren’t any conditions, are there?”

Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s starry eyes. His mouth was dry, and he found himself swallowing involuntarily. In a low voice, he raised his tone slightly. “What can you give

me?!

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

With that, Gu Zhou left.

Qiao Nian gazed at Gu Zhou’s retreating back. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to be willing to help without asking for anything in return.

Since there were no conditions attached, she was relieved.

The next day.

Qiao Nian drove to the Huangtian Hotel. As soon as she stopped the car, she took off her sunglasses and took out her phone. She skillfully typed a string of code, then typed out a text and sent it.

Su Xue suddenly received a message from Qiu Nan.

“Sister Xue, I miss you. I’m in the suite on the top floor of the Huangtian Hotel. I’ve already specially prepared a unique fitness training plan just for you. Can you come now?”

When Su Xue saw this message, her lips curved up involuntarily. Her body began to heat up. She yearned to fly to the hotel right now to do some wonderful aerobics with Qiu Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Nan.

Su Xue quickly replied, then deleted the message.

Qiao Nian, who had been sitting in the car, received a message from Su Xue not long after.

“Little Nan Nan, wait for me. I’ll be there soon!”

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up coldly. She turned to look at Gu Zhou, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Smiling, she asked, “Do you want to make a bet?”

Gu Zhou looked away from the phone and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. His eyes lit up. “Yes?”

“Do you think Qiao Shan will hit Su Xue when he comes to the hotel and finds out everything?” Qiao Nian said, looking extremely excited.

Gu Zhou was slightly amused by the smile on Qiao Nian’s face. He thought for a while and said, “A man shouldn’t hit a woman.”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face deepened. Her red lips parted slightly. “A friendly reminder. Not every man is a gentleman. Many men are beasts!”

“Mrs. Gu, are you complimenting me? Am I a gentleman?” Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes, his words tinged with humor!

Qiao Nian: Man, you’re missing the point!

However, this didn’t interfere with Qiao Nian’s understanding of Gu Zhou. She nodded solemnly, a bright smile on her face. “Of course. Mr. Gu is definitely a gentleman!”
