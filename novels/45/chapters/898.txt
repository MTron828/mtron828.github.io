899 Scared

Gu Zhou noticed Qiao Nian’s messy footsteps and narrowed his deep eyes.

After Qiao Nian walked out of the Gu family villa, she walked to her car.

The servants in the Gu family villa were packing up the things in the courtyard. The courtyard was extremely lively. She sat alone in the car, her eyes filled with panic.

How?

Why had it become like this?

Although she did not ask Gu Zhou about the situation in detail, she had a feeling that the man that night was really Gu Zhou.

She still remembered the faint fragrance of the man’s body and his voice.

Although the man’s fragrance was a little similar to Gu Zhou’s, their voices were different.

Qiao Nian’s hands were cold. She placed her hands on the steering wheel and buried her head in it, her body trembling uncontrollably.

The events of that night lingered in her mind.

“No…”

“Please…”

“Let me go…”

…

Qiao Nian’s ears rang with the sound of her begging for mercy that night, but her begging was useless.

Qiao Nian suddenly opened her eyes and suppressed the thoughts in her mind. She seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly took out her phone, calling Lu Zhu with a trembling voice. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lu Zhu’s call quickly connected.

“Sugar.”

Lu Zhu’s voice was as gentle as ever.

Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart calmed down a lot. She took a deep breath and asked carefully, “Brother, do you have time now?”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s low voice, he frowned slightly. “Did something happen?”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s concerned words, her eyes instantly turned red. She tried hard to remain calm and said, “I-I just wanted to see you.”

It felt good to have a family.

Qiao Nian felt that the trauma of her childhood would take a long time to heal.

It seemed that she had to take better care of Xiao Shi in the future. That way, she wouldn’t be traumatized after she grew up.

Lu Zhu naturally recognized Qiao Nian’s nasal voice. He frowned. Since Sugar wanted to meet, it didn’t matter how late it was.

Lu Zhu glanced at the time. It was already ten in the night.

Sugar had called him out so late at night, which meant that she was really sad.

Lu Zhu hesitated for a moment and asked, “Sugar, do you want me to pick you up?”

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and tried her best to pretend that she was fine. “Brother, just send me a location.”

“Okay,” Lu Zhu replied. After hanging up, he sent his location to Qiao Nian.

He stood up, walked to the hanger next to the office, and put on his suit jacket.

Lu Rao, who was sitting at the side, had also heard the conversation between Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian. He immediately stood up and said happily, “Brother, I’ll go with you. I haven’t seen my sister in a long time!”

Lu Zhu’s hand, which was putting on his clothes, paused for a moment. He looked at Lu Rao indifferently and said firmly, “No!”

“Why? Sister didn’t say that she wouldn’t let me go. Can’t I go see her?” Lu Rao muttered unhappily. “Do you think it’s appropriate for you to monopolize Sister alone?”

“It is.” As Lu Zhu spoke, he walked to the office door. Just as he was about to leave, he seemed to have thought of something and stopped. He turned back to look at Lu Rao. “By the way, the documents on my desk have to be signed today. Help me take a look.”

Lu Zhu’s thoughts were very simple. If Lu Rao worked overtime here, Lu Rao would no longer have the chance to secretly follow him to see Sugar.

Lu Rao looked at Lu Zhu in disbelief. His brother was actually so shameless. He gritted his teeth and said, “These are all your jobs.”

Lu Zhu smiled gentlemanly and said, “We’re brothers. My business is your business!”

Lu Rao’s eyes darkened. He pursed his lips.

When he met his sister, they were no longer brothers.

When he was asked to work, he would be indiscriminate.

Heh…

Far Mountain Coffee.

The cafe Lu Zhu had found was very close to Gu Zhou’s villa. After Qiao Nian arrived at the cafe, she sat by the French window and looked at the scenery outside. Her eyes gradually became empty.

The world was huge. In the past, Qiao Nian felt that she might not be able to find her biological parents in this lifetime.

But now, she felt that the world was very small.
