Chapter 1825 - 1825 Ruining Reputation

Song Yu took the soup from Auntie Cao and said softly, “Thank you for your concern, Auntie Cao.”

She placed the soup on the table at the side and asked in confusion, “You just said something about being scheming. What do you mean…”

Song Yu’s heart was in a mess. She had never spoken to anyone about her second brother.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Auntie Cao had been by her side for so many years. She was worried that Auntie Cao would discover her thoughts.

Auntie Cao’s expression instantly turned serious as she looked at the balcony with a cold expression. “Eldest Miss is too scheming. It’s as if the entire world belongs to her and should serve her. She even relied on her three children to win over everyone.”

Song Yu looked out of the window and saw that the few of them had already carried the children into the villa. She looked at Auntie Cao again and said coldly, “Auntie Cao, don’t say such things again in the future.”

Auntie Cao’s face froze. Seeing that Song Yu had lowered her head and was about to drink the soup, she suppressed her anger. “I didn’t say anything wrong. She left the three children behind and left. This time, she came back. She didn’t use the main door and climbed over the wall. What’s this!”

Song Yu placed the bowl back on the table and looked at Auntie Cao with a frown. She said solemnly, “This is also Sister’s house. Sister can leave and come as she pleases. This is normal. If she has to greet us when she returns home, won’t she be an outsider?”

When Auntie Cao heard Song Yu’s words, she looked at her helplessly, as if to say, “You’re too naive. How can you speak up for Eldest Miss?”

In the end, Auntie Cao sighed and pulled Song Yu to the sofa at the side to sit down. She said earnestly, “Sixth Miss, you can’t be so stupid anymore. You were bullied because you were too kind.”

“Auntie Cao.” Song Yu took her hand out of Auntie Cao’s and said seriously, “No one in this family bullied me. I’m doing very well.”

Auntie Cao looked at Song Yu with heartache and sighed again. “Sixth Miss, I know you’re kind-hearted and think positively of everyone, but there’s such people in this world. She has ulterior motives and keeps scheming against others.”

“Ever since Eldest Miss came home, the few young masters in the family have been fooled by her. Not only did they help her raise her children, but they also helped her take care of Matriarch Gu. Now that she’s home, in order to attract the attention of others, she specially climbed over the wall.”

“If she climbed over someone else’s wall today, does that mean she’s a thief?”

Song Yu’s expression became uglier and uglier. Just as she was about to speak, Auntie Cao held her hand again.

“Sixth Miss, you haven’t encountered those dark things before. You don’t know how sinister people are. How about this? Let me ask you a question. Do you remember Jiang Yue?” Auntie Cao asked.

When Song Yu heard Auntie Cao’s words, she nodded. “I remember.”

“Why did Jiang Yue leave the Gu family? When Eldest Miss wasn’t in the Gu family, Jiang Yue was still the eldest daughter of the Gu family. However, Eldest Miss was jealous of Jiang Yue, so she tried to chase her out of the house,” Auntie Cao said.

Song Yu pulled her hand out of Auntie Cao’s and said coldly, “You’re wrong. At that time, it was because Jiang Yue framed Sister that the Gu family couldn’t tolerate Jiang Yue. Auntie Cao, let me say it again. Sister is very good. Don’t speak ill of her in front of me.”

“My Sixth Miss, can you not be so innocent? Ever since she returned to the Lu family, everyone in the family has been accommodating her. Matriarch, Old Master, and Madam can’t wait to stick to her. I know they want to make up for what they owe Eldest Miss for so many years, but they’re a little too good to her. I’ve never seen them treat you and Seventh Miss like this. Eldest Miss must have used some tricks.”

Seeing that Song Yu’s expression was getting uglier, Auntie Cao’s eyes darted around and she continued, “When you came back injured this time, they didn’t care much about you.”

Song Yu took a deep breath and said seriously, “Auntie Cao, are you sowing discord?”
