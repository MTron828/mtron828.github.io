Chapter 646: Refusing Goodwill

Her eyes were sparkling like the stars in the night sky.

However, Qiao Nian’s impression of Su Sheng instantly dropped. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Of course, good friends could share things with each other, but strangers…

This was the second time she had met Su Sheng. The two of them were not very familiar with each other, but when Su Sheng said that she would give her an album, it felt like charity.

Qiao Nian finally understood why Su Sheng hadn’t offered to give her an album when she was at the Gu residence.

Moreover, Su Sheng didn’t even want to give her an album. She was clearly just showing off.

If she hadn’t come here today, she wouldn’t have seen Su Sheng. If she hadn’t seen Su Sheng, Su Sheng probably wouldn’t have suggested giving her the album.

If she was not wrong, no matter who was standing in the elevator today, Su Sheng would give that album to them.

Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually turned cold. She didn’t like this kind of show-off charity. Her gaze fell on Su Sheng’s face and she continued, “Thank you for your kindness, Miss Su. Miss Su, you should keep that album for yourself. After all, I don’t deserve anything.”

Su Sheng looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. Her brow gradually furrowed as she asked in confusion, “Miss Qiao, did I say something wrong? Why have you suddenly become like this? I’m doing this out of goodwill. I’m also thinking about Little Qi’s illness. If I really said something wrong, you can tell me. I’ll apologize to you.”

“Thank you, but there’s no need.”

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, the elevator door opened with a ding. She took the lead and walked out.

Su Sheng frowned slightly as she looked at Qiao Nian’s back. The confusion in her eyes became even more obvious.

She clearly meant well and wanted to treat Little Qi’s illness.

She had even given Qiao Nian a limited edition album. She was so generous. She really didn’t understand why Qiao Nian was angry.

Was Qiao Nian angry because she could listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s new song?

Su Sheng walked out of the elevator slowly. Suddenly, an idea flashed in her mind and she instantly reacted.

Qiao Nian must be jealous of her.

Previously, in the car, Qiao Nian had been very envious of her for having Mr. Dong Hua’s limited edition album. Now, she was telling Qiao Nian that she was here to listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s new song.

No matter how good Qiao Nian’s upbringing was, it would be ruined by jealousy.

This world was just so unfair.

Rich people shouldn’t be with poor people. If they were, the poor would only treat the gifts given by the rich as charity.

Her environment was different from Qiao Nian’s, and their values were also different. It was normal for Qiao Nian to be jealous of her.

She was now a famous psychiatrist in the country, but Qiao Nian was an unknown doctor.

However, she really wanted to give the album to Qiao Nian. She wanted Little Qi to recover as soon as possible.

Forget it. Not everyone would accept this calmly.

Perhaps that limited edition album was very valuable to Qiao Nian, but she had more of Mr. Dong Hua’s albums.

She really wanted to give the item to someone who needed it more. This was to make the best use of it. It would also allow Mr. Dong Hua’s music to play a greater role in one’s life.

It should be because she had said that she could hear Mr. Dong Hua’s new song. This made Qiao Nian jealous.

Actually, she really just wanted to share her joy. Moreover, she wanted to get closer to Qiao Nian.

But it had backfired.

Forget it. She wouldn’t think about this anymore.

If she gave Qiao Nian a copy of Mr. Dong Hua’s new album, Qiao Nian would calm down and think things through. Then, the two of them would definitely be able to reconcile.

In her opinion, good friends had to share good things.

… .

Qiao Nian walked forward in her high heels, deliberately distancing herself from Su Sheng.

She finally understood that her previous feelings were not wrong.

In the past, she had treasured many of Mr. Dong Hua’s albums, but those albums were only lent to good friends to listen to. She was never willing to give them away.

Moreover, every time Mr. Dong Hua released an album, she would buy two copies. One would be used for collection, and the other would be used for daily listening.
