Chapter 321: Continue Investigating

“Speak.” Gu Zhou poured the brewed milk into a cup and turned to look at Chen Qing.

“Before Zhang Yi died, she refused to say anything. Young Master ran out because of his physical punishment. However, she insisted that Young Master was possessed because he went to the funeral hall for a few hours.”

Gu Zhou clenched his fists. He frowned, his expression darkening.

After about five seconds, Gu Zhou calmed down. He turned to look at Chen Qing and said coldly, “There are no ghosts in this world!”

“Of course I know that there are no ghosts in this world.” Chen Qing voiced his concerns hesitantly. “I’m just very curious as to why Young Master would go to a funeral parlor. According to my previous investigations, every time Young Master goes missing, he’s very likely to go to a funeral parlor. This is really unbelievable!”

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. He seemed to recall something and said, “Last year, I told him that his mother had already died.”

“But what does this have to do with the funeral parlor?” Chen Qing looked puzzled.

“Previously, I told him that his mother has been staying at the funeral home because the funeral home is the door to another world,” Gu Zhou said calmly, his brow furrowed.

“Could it be that Young Master went to the funeral parlor to accompany his mother?” A trace of surprise flashed in Chen Qing’s eyes. He continued, “But Young Master was only three years old last year. Can he remember what happened when he was three years old?”

Gu Zhou frowned. He had rarely spoken to Gu Qi in the past, so he wasn’t sure.

However, when Gu Zhou thought about how Gu Qi might remember what happened when he was young, and how Zhang Yi had once harmed Gu Qi, his breathing grew heavy. He did not speak. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that Gu Zhou didn’t look well, Chen Qing said carefully, “But according to the DNA test, Wang Lin isn’t Young Master’s mother. In that case, Young Master’s mother might still be alive. As long as we can find Young Master’s mother, we might be able to make up for the maternal love Young Master once lacked.”

Gu Zhou’s expression improved a little. He continued, “Investigate this matter thoroughly. I don’t believe that there aren’t any traces of what happened back then!”

At this point, Chen Qing suddenly recalled something and hurriedly said, “Second Young Master, I’ve found some information. I heard that a week before you stayed at that hotel, Eldest Young Master stayed there for a month.”

Gu Zhou’s eyes lit up. “My big brother?”

“Yes.”

“Then why didn’t you say so earlier?” Gu Gu’s expression darkened as he questioned coldly.

Chen Qing hurriedly explained, “The security guards only confirmed that Young Master had stayed there after seeing his photo. However, Young Master didn’t use his own identity card back then.”

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, Gu Zhou fell into deep thought. Could it be that what happened back then was also related to Big Brother?

Not long after the incident that night during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Big Brother went missing in a car accident. It had been five years since then, but there was still no news of him.

What was Big Brother’s motive back then?

If Big Brother was behind that incident, it would be normal for him to not find anything after so long.

However, he hoped that this had nothing to do with Big Brother.

“Follow this lead and continue investigating!” Gu Zhou said coldly.

“Yes, sir.”

As soon as Chen Qing finished speaking, the two of them heard footsteps.

Gu Qi went downstairs sleepily. At this moment, the long curly wig on his head had disappeared, revealing his fine hair and clean, young face.

Chen Qing was used to seeing Young Master wearing a wig, so he didn’t react for a moment.

Gu Zhou walked calmly towards Gu Qi and said in a low voice, “Have you washed up?”

Gu Qi nodded obediently, his eyes sparkling as he looked at Gu Zhou.

This was great. His father was home!
