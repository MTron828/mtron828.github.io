Chapter 310: Falling to the Bottom

In the beginning, Gu Zhou, who had never posted anything on Weibo, cleared Qiao Nian’s name. Then, the mysterious genius composer, Mr. Dong Hua, invited Qiao Nian to be his female musician.

Everyone on the field glanced at Xia Xue, then at Qiao Nian.

The former was someone Brother Cao had taken a liking to, while the latter was personally invited by Mr. Dong Hua!

The difference between them was simply too great!

Xia Xue held her phone with trembling hands. She looked at the contents of Weibo in shock. What little rationality she had left was instantly shattered. She looked up at Qiao Nian. “When did you meet Mr. Dong Hua? Why did he choose you to be a female musician? I’m clearly his female musician!”

Gao Lin stepped forward and grabbed Xia Xue’s arm, signaling for her to stop arguing. She said firmly, “Qiao Nian, don’t be too smug. Mr. Dong Hua just said that you’re his female musician, which means that you’re his backup musician. Our Sister Xia Xue is Mr. Dong Hua’s true female musician!”

Liu Yu nodded in a daze and continued, “Yes, that’s right. Mr. Dong Hua only said that you were his female musician, and he didn’t say that you were his only female musician!”

When Wang Xuan heard the words of the three of them, she instantly felt as if her worldview had been refreshed. These three people were truly thick-skinned. They simply wouldn’t shed a tear until they saw their coffins.

“Are you sure you’re Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician?” Qiao Nian asked, raising her eyebrow slightly.

“Of course. Brother Cao has already posted on Weibo!” Xia Xue said firmly.

Qiao Nian looked down at her phone and swiped her finger twice. Finally, she looked at Xia Xue casually and smiled. “But why do I see that Brother Cao has already deleted that Weibo post?”

Xia Xue’s heart instantly sank to the bottom. She held her phone with trembling hands, her tears falling onto the screen one by one. It wasn’t easy for her to find Brother Cao’s Weibo, but the Weibo post about her had already been deleted.

How could this be?

Impossible. It was impossible for Brother Cao to delete it.

It must be because Weibo was too jammed!

With this thought in mind, Xia Xue refreshed Weibo several times, but the results were the same.

Gao Lin stood beside Xia Xue. She looked at Brother Cao’s Weibo and her heart sank.

Xia Xue’s face was covered in tears. She muttered, “How is this possible? How can this be?”

Xia Xue couldn’t believe that Brother Cao had deleted the Weibo post about her. When she refreshed the page again, she saw that Brother Cao had just posted a new Weibo post.

“I’m sorry, everyone. I made a mistake previously. The only female musician we invited is Qiao Nian. I hope to see Miss Qiao Nian’s outstanding performance!”

Xia Xue’s grip loosened and the phone fell to the ground, shattering the screen.

Liu Yu was instantly flustered. She asked uneasily, “What should we do? What should we do?”

Gao Lin’s last hope had vanished. She couldn’t believe what she had just seen on Weibo. She shook her head vigorously and repeated, “How could Brother Cao do this? He previously agreed to let Sister Xia Xue be a female musician. Why did he change it just like that?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s words, she found them especially laughable. She asked, “Why can’t I change it? Xia Xue clearly stole my position! Why can’t I take it back openly?”

Xia Xue looked up at Qiao Nian and raised her hand to wipe her tears. Her beautiful peach blossom eyes were filled with hatred as she looked at Qiao Nian. Her body couldn’t help but tremble. It was as if all the strength in her body had been sucked out. She felt as if a knife was constantly stabbing into her heart, making her want to die.

There were several times when Xia Xue almost fainted from anger.

Gao Lin stood there in a daze. All her hopes were on Xia Xue. She had never expected her hopes to be dashed so quickly.

Why had it become like this?

Qiao Nian was clearly a country bumpkin!nnn

Qiao Nian was clearly a shameless mistress who had been kept by old men.

How did it suddenly turn into a discussion about building a gymnasium with Gu Zhou?

She, Gao Lin, was clearly the daughter of a rich family. How had she become an ugly duckling?

What should she do?

What should she do now?

She had even posted some indecent photos of Qiao Nian on the Internet. How should she deal with this?
