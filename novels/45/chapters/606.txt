Chapter 607: My Feet Hurt

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But Qiao Nian only wanted to escape.

The possessiveness in the man’s eyes grew more and more obvious. He opened his mouth slightly and said, “Come here.”

Qiao Nian really wanted to escape. Gu Chuan’s personality was too terrifying.

If there were no guests today, she might have run away.

She had specially invited Doctor Su over today because she wanted Doctor Su to treat Little Qi.

So she couldn’t escape.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, she saw the man frowning. Her mind raced, and she hurriedly bent down, pretending to be pitiful. “Oh my, my feet hurt. I might have sprained them when I came in. I have to sit down.”

With that, she carefully moved towards the sofa.

The man frowned and walked towards Qiao Nian. His footsteps were clearly faster than when he had gone downstairs.

When she saw the man approaching, she was about to accelerate when the man picked her up like a princess.

At this moment, the butler, who had just passed by, looked at this scene in disbelief. His jaw dropped to the ground.

The butler watched as Second Young Master carried Second Young Madam up and walked towards Second Young Master’s guest room.

Oh my god!

Had he gone senile? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In the past, he had always felt that Second Young Master and Second Young Madam treated each other with respect. Now, it seemed that he had misjudged. Just now, Second Young Master had looked at Second Young Madam with love.

That strong love seemed to want to tear Second Young Madam apart.

Could it be that the two of them had entered the room to make babies?

It seemed that the old lady’s wish to have a grandson would be fulfilled soon.

With this thought in mind, the butler saw that the cleaning servant was about to go upstairs. He chased the servant away and asked them to come back later to clean.

He quickly walked towards Matriarch Gu’s room and knocked on the door. When he heard Matriarch Gu say, “Come in,” he pushed the door open and entered.

“Matriarch, this is good news! Great news!” The butler said excitedly.

When Matriarch Gu heard the butler’s words, her eyes lit up. She asked, “Has Young Master returned?”

The butler was slightly stunned. This was not the good news he had wanted to tell her.

Matriarch Gu looked at the butler’s expression and knew that she had guessed wrongly. She asked again, “What good news?”

The butler hurriedly recounted everything he had seen downstairs in detail. In the end, he repeated, “Second Young Master couldn’t wait to hug Second Young Madam and return to his room.”

“Really?” When Matriarch Gu heard that the two children had never consummated their marriage, she felt very upset. She felt that she had been deceived. However, when she heard the butler’s words, her lips curved up uncontrollably. “Did you see it with your own eyes?”

“Yes, I’m definitely not wrong. Second Young Master was personally carrying Second Young Madam. I was also shocked at that time, but when I thought about it, it made sense. Second Young Master and Second Young Madam’s relationship is getting better and better every day. This is the first time I’ve seen Second Young Master looking at someone so intently!” The butler smiled until his face was covered in wrinkles. He was looking forward to Second Young Master and Second Young Madam having a few more children. “Looks like there will be a new Young Master in the family soon.”

Matriarch Gu’s smile grew even brighter. Although her heart ached for Gu Qi, this child was not of the Gu family’s legitimate bloodline. She still hoped that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian would have a child together.

At this moment.

The man carried Qiao Nian back to her room. He even kicked the door shut.

She was placed on the bed by the man. She sat up straight and saw the man walk to the medicine box beside the wardrobe and bring it to her.

Qiao Nian instantly understood that he wanted to help her apply medicine. She hurriedly said, “This is a small matter. I’ll do it myself.”

The man lowered his head and looked into Qiao Nian’s face. In an instant, his eyes were filled with coldness. His voice was low and hoarse. “Nian’er, why won’t you listen to me?”

Gu Chuan was standing very close to her. Qiao Nian could hear his every breath, and could clearly see his every eyelash. She could also see the displeasure and frustration in his eyes. He seemed to want to imprison her.

“I didn’t.” Qiao Nian could only calm him down for the time being.

“Is that so?” The coldness in the man’s words was even more obvious.

“Gu Chuan, my feet hurt,” Qiao Nian said pitifully.
