Chapter 1561 Fainted

The president opened his mouth slightly, but his touched words were stuck in his throat.

Seeing that the president was staring at her, Qiao Nian was about to take the initiative to speak when her body fell back uncontrollably.

The president's heart was in his throat. He wanted to reach out and catch Qiao Nian, but Gu Zhou, who was standing beside her, had already picked her up immediately.

"Nian'er!" Gu Zhou called out nervously.

Under the light, Qiao Nian's palm-sized face was frighteningly pale. Her clothes were still a little damp, and she looked disheveled and haggard.

The president hurriedly said loudly, "Quick, someone, call Olly over!"

Worried that it would take too much time for the servants to go back and forth, the President hurriedly led Gu Zhou to the treatment room at the back.

About a minute later, when they arrived at the treatment room, the president called out, "Ollie, Ollie."

Ollie immediately ran out. Just as he was about to speak, he heard the president say, "Miss Qiao has fainted. Hurry up and examine her."

Olly hurriedly nodded and gestured for Gu Zhou to walk towards the independent ward, asking him to place Qiao Nian on the bed.

Gu Zhou exuded a cold aura, as if he wanted everyone around him to back off. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, as if Qiao Nian was the only one left in his world.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was unwilling to place Qiao Nian on the hospital bed for a long time, Ollie carefully reminded him, "Second Young Master, please place Miss Qiao on the hospital bed so that I can examine her body.

Qiao Nian's heart skipped a beat. Instead of opening her eyes, she gently held Gu Zhou's finger with her small hand.

Gu Zhou sensed Qiao Nian's actions. Only then did he gently place Qiao Nian on the bed and look at her with a burning gaze.

Qiao Nian opened her eyes slightly and gave Gu Zhou a "don't worry" look, then closed them again.

Gu Zhou noticed Qiao Nian's expression. He roughly understood what Qiao Nian meant.

He bent down and covered Qiao Nian with the blanket before standing to the side. Looking at Ollie, who was pushing the medical instrument in, he said coldly, "She was drenched in the heavy rain. Although she changed into dry clothes on the way back, she might have been drenched in the rain for too long and caught a cold." Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ollie's hand, which was adjusting the instrument, paused for a moment. He turned back to look at Gu Zhou and saw him looking at Qiao Nian solemnly, his eyes filled with worry.

Ollie thought of what Qiao Nian had done today and was a little moved.

If it weren't for Madam President, Miss Qiao wouldn't have looked for Colorful Fungus on the mountain in the heavy rain. She didn't have to do this.

Ollie still remembered the first time he had seen Qiao Nian. He had seen Qiao Nian use a silver needle to control the bleeding in Princess Lina's shoulder. At that time, he had felt that Qiao Nian's medical skills were very good.

However, at that time, he didn't know who Qiao Nian was. He thought to himself that if Qiao Nian could join his team, his team would definitely be stronger.

Later on, when he found out Qiao Nian's true identity, he knew in his heart that it was impossible for someone like Qiao Nian to join his team, so he didn't mention it to her.

A doctor was benevolent.

He was benevolent to every patient, but at Qiao Nian's age, he would never go to extremes for a patient.

On the mountain, Qiao Nian encountered Mark's men and almost died under the hail of bullets.

There was a thunderstorm on the mountain. How could a girl like Qiao Nian withstand it?

Cliff Mountain was an undeveloped mountain. This meant that there were countless insects, mosquitoes, and wild beasts on this mountain. It was extremely dangerous.

Doctor Ollie nodded and said, "Mr. Gu, don't worry. I'll take good care of Miss Qiao."

Gu Zhou gently tucked Qiao Nian's hair aside. He looked at her reluctantly before leaving.

Seeing Gu Zhou leave, Doctor Ollie heaved a sigh of relief. He looked at Qiao Nian, whose face and lips were pale. She must be quite ill.

He used the instrument to examine Qiao Nian carefully. The instrument showed that the results were normal.

A trace of confusion flashed in Dr. Ollie's eyes, and he frowned slightly.

Strange.

What was going on?

Suddenly, Dr. Ollie had a bad feeling.
