798 Revenge

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “I’m here today to see how you’re doing. I’m very concerned about you.”

“How could you be so kind? Don’t be so hypocritical! Let me tell you, if it weren’t or you, how could I be in such a miserable state!” Su Xue glared at Qiao Nian angrily. She was originally Madam Qiao, but because of Qiao Nian’s previous schemes, she had already been kicked out of the house by Qiao Shan.

She could no longer live an easy and happy life like before. Now, she thought about how to please Qiao Shan every day and return to the Qiao family.

“How can you say that? I’m still very concerned about you.” Qiao Nian pretended to be hurt. She crossed her right leg over her left and said calmly, “I’ve always cared about you. Seeing that you’re not doing well, I’m relieved!”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she suppressed her anger. Her breathing was heavy, and she yearned to slap Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian had gone too far.

She had ruined her reputation and caused Qiao Shan to go to prison. Qiao Nian was like a demon from hell, taking revenge on everyone in the Qiao family.

“Get lost now. You’re no longer a member of the Qiao family.” Su Xue pointed at the door and said angrily.

“Don’t be angry. No one will feel sorry for you if you get angry and ruin your health.” Qiao Nian smiled gently, looking gentle and harmless. “No, I was wrong. Your little lover will definitely feel sorry for you.”

Su Xue’s expression changed.

Little lover!

Qiao Nian’s words pulled Su Xue back to the day she had been caught with her little lover in the hotel. She had never expected her little lover to betray her.

Su Xue thought for a long time and finally understood.

That incident must have been set up by her little lover and Qiao Nian.

What had happened was already in the past. She had no time to dwell on what had happened before. She had to please Qiao Shan now and remarry him.

When she became Madam Qiao again, Qiao Nian would die.

“Shut up. Get lost now! I don’t want to see you again!” Su Xue said angrily, panting.

“Some things aren’t up to you.” Qiao Nian’s smile was sweet. In an instant, her expression turned cold, as if she were a demon from hell. Her entire body emitted a cold aura. “When do you plan to tell me the truth about my background?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, her expression froze. She shouted unhappily, “What nonsense are you spouting? I didn’t lie to you. I’m telling the truth!”

Qiao Nian smiled coldly and slowly stood up. She walked up to Su Xue and looked at her with a dark expression.

Su Xue felt a little uncomfortable under Qiao Nian’s gaze. She silently took a step back and stammered, “I’m telling you, don’t scare me. I-I wasn’t raised in fear!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Actually, she was extremely terrified now.

She didn’t know why she was afraid of Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian clearly didn’t threaten her now. Perhaps it was because of the trauma Qiao Nian had left her with.

Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue without changing her expression. Su Xue took two steps back and staggered to the sofa.

“You still refuse to tell the truth?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly, looking impatient.

“I’m telling the truth. I’m not lying to you. If you don’t believe me, you’re maligning me!” Su Xue hurriedly sat up straight and said unhappily.

Qiao Nian looked down at Su Xue, her voice as cold as ice. “I’ve already investigated what you said previously. That incident was fake at all. Moreover, you didn’t take me away from the hospital. Tell me, when exactly did you bring me to the Qiao family?”

Su Xue still wanted to stand up and confront Qiao Nian, but when she saw Qiao Nian’s cold fox-like eyes, she gave in. She sat on the sofa and said firmly, “I took you away from the hospital. You’re a wild child that people don’t want. If you don’t believe me, I can take you to my attending doctor!”

At this point, Su Xue hardened her stance again. She stood up and looked at Qiao Nian coldly, saying angrily, “If it weren’t for me back then, you would have died long ago. How would you have had the chance to stand here?”
