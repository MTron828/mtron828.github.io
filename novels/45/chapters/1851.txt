Translator: Atlas Studios       Editor: Atlas Studios

When Lina heard Qiao Nians words, she smiled and nodded. However, the smile on her face gradually faded as she said, Nian Nian, Im sorry.

Whats wrong?

l want to be by Moms side recently. Today, Grandpa Qin said that he could treat Moms illness. My mind is filled with Moms matters. Im afraid Towards the end, Lina looked like she wanted to say something but hesitated.

Seeing Lina like this, Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. l know you have something on your mind. You wont be able to have fun. You should rest early. If nothing happens, Grandpa will treat Madam President tomorrow. Youre

Madam Presidents spiritual pillar. You cant fall.

Lina smiled shyly. Nian Nian was always so understanding.

Qiao Nian reached out and hugged Lina, gently patting her back. She said gently, Dont worry, itll be fine, Everything will get better.

Qiao Nians words seemed to have a magical power, gradually calming Linas uneasy heart. Lina smiled and nodded, agreeing softly. Okay.

At the same time, in the Lu family.

Lu Zhu walked out of the study and saw two servants passing by. He happened to see the Chinese medicine in their hands. Wait.

The two servants hurriedly stopped. When they saw Lu Zhu, the servant standing in front hurriedly smiled. Eldest Young Master.

Lu Zhu glanced at the magnolia-bark and frowned slightly. Put these two pots in my study.

When the two servants heard Lu Zhus words, they were slightly stunned.

Song Yu was very popular in the Lu family. The servants of the Lu family had also watched Song Yu grow up. When they found out that Song Yu had a strange illness, they were all extremely worried. Later on, they found out that Eldest Young Master had found magnolia-bark, who could treat Sixth Misss sleep disorder. They were also happy for Sixth Miss.bender

Eldest Young Master, when are you going to give it to Sixth Miss?

When Lu Zhu heard the servants question, his expression instantly darkened, and a trace of melancholy flashed in his black eyes. Youre so talkative. Although Lu Zhu had only said three words, the two of them could sense the pressure emanating from him. They immediately lowered their heads and did not dare to say anything else. They hurriedly sent the Chinese medicine into Lu Zhus study.

Lu Zhu watched as they left magnolia-bark behind and walked into the study alone. Then, he closed the study door and sat down on a chair. He looked at the two pots of herbs and gradually fell into deep thought.

Qiao Nian drove very quickly. It didnt take her long to reach the Lu family home. It was supposed to be a two-hour journey, but she only took an hour.

When the guard saw Qiao Nian return, a bright smile appeared on his face. Eldest Miss, welcome home!

Qiao Nian nodded slightly as a greeting. Then, she quickly walked into the villa. Just as she reached the villa, she went straight to Lu Zhus study. Lu Zhus study was on the second floor. When she went up the stairs, Qiao Nian heard two servants muttering at the corner of the second floor.

Eldest Young Master had originally asked us to put the herbs he had found for Sixth Miss in her room. Why did he suddenly change his mind?

l dont know. Lets not get involved in Masters matters. Sigh, Sixth Miss hasnt slept well for a few nights.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Alright, stop talking. Go to work!

When Qiao Nian heard the words of the two servants, her expression froze for a moment. Then, she walked towards Lu Zhus room.

In Song Yu e s room.

Auntie Cao walked in with fruits. When she saw Song Yu sitting on the sofa in the room and reading a script, her eyes darted around and she said, Sixth Miss, I just heard that Eldest Young Master has already found a herb to treat your insomnia.

When Song Yu heard Auntie Caos words, a trace of a smile flashed in her eyes.

She ate a grape and said, Brother has always been very concerned about me. Ill thank Eldest Young Master later.

Sixth Miss, I think youre happy too early. Originally, Eldest Young Master wanted to send the herbs to your room, but for some reason, he got someone to bring them to the study. Auntie Cao thought of what the two servants had said and pretended to be serious. Perhaps Eldest Young Master thinks that those herbs are too valuable and doesnt want to give them to you anymore..
