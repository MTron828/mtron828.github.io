When Cui Si heard the president’s words, a bitter smile appeared on his face. He said in a low voice, “Back then, the old president secretly told me that he wanted to pass the position to you. At that time, I had already observed you. You’re a kind-hearted person. Such a president is the blessing of the people. However, when the Cui family was wiped out, Mark was too ruthless. He found someone to disguise as you and killed my eldest son in front of me. I didn’t even have a chance to look for you, let alone ask you why you did it.”

“I know you still treat me as a friend, but today’s matter is too big. I’m afraid no one else can tolerate me.” Cui Si had long thought it through. He sighed helplessly.

He had no intention of returning alive today.

When the president heard Cui Si’s words, he couldn’t help but smile and say, “You’re no longer General Cui Si. You’re just Cui Si, a citizen of MY who was deceived by Mark. As for your people, they’re also innocent. As the president, I still have tolerance. When the time comes, you can just bring your people back to MY.”

After the President finished speaking, his gaze landed on Cui Qi’s face not far away. He continued, “Cui Qi is still a general. Cui Qi is a motivated child. As long as he’s willing to work hard, the Cui family will definitely regain its former glory.”

Cui Si’s eyes turned red when he heard the president’s words. For a moment, he felt extremely complicated.

He did not expect the president to be so thoughtful. He slowly put down the gun in his hand and finally sighed. “You’re indeed a benevolent ruler that the old president thought highly of.”

If the president at this moment was Mark, Mark would definitely kill him.

Back then, Mark’s daughter, Princess Annie, had shot Cui Qi in court. At that time, Cui Si felt uncomfortable, but Mark said that Annie had been bewitched by the president to do that. He had to accept this explanation.

Now that he thought about it, Mark actually made up all kinds of lame reasons to deceive him every time. If he checked carefully, he might be able to find out the truth.

Mark was taken into custody by the president’s men, and the other guards began to clean the hall.

The president and Cui Si walked to the side to catch up.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Cui Qi walked up to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. He looked at Gu Zhou and asked, “Mr. Gu, can I speak to Miss Qiao alone?”

“Okay,” Gu Zhou replied and walked to the side.

Qiao Nian looked at Cui Qi who was in front. She had a warm smile as she asked. “Is your body feeling better?”

“Thank you for your concern Miss Qiao, I’m already almost recovered. I really have to thank you sincerely today. I didn’t have a chance to do so in the past.” As Cui Qi spoke, he bowed deeply in front of Qiao Nian and then stood upright. “Thank you.”

Qiao Nian was stunned by Cui Qi’s unexpected action. Then, she smiled and said, “It’s fine. It’s nothing.”

Cui Qi smiled slightly. He looked at Qiao Nian in front of him and continued, “Actually, I’ve unintentionally thought of some things from the past these past few days, so I thought I would tell you when I had the time. However, I didn’t expect to see you again at this time.”

When Qiao Nian heard Cui Qi’s words, her eyes instantly lit up. She asked curiously, “What did you think of?”

“Mark has a mistress. I think her name is Song Ling. I’ve seen her a few times before.” Cui Qi tried to think about what had happened before and said with a serious expression, “At that time, I didn’t have a good relationship with Mark. My father was still alive. I saw Song Ling sitting alone in the garden in a daze, looking at a photo. It seemed to be a little girl.”

Qiao Nian blinked slightly and said, “She had a child?”

“I think so, but the little girl in the photo is obviously not of mixed blood. She looks very similar to Song Ling.” Cui Qi thought about it seriously and said, “At that time, I thought she was a woman snatched by Mark.”

Qiao Nian smiled. “Your memory is so good. You can actually remember such a small matter.”
