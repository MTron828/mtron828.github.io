1239 It Hurts

Takeda naturally didn’t think too much about it. If he let Qiao Nian off, Jiang Yue might attack him directly. The only thing he could do was protect himself.

Takeda was about to tie Qiao Nian’s arm with a rope when Qiao Nian grabbed his arm before his hand could touch hers.

“Huh?” Takeda was slightly stunned. The world spun, and he fell heavily to the ground. “Ah!”

Jiang Yue was so frightened that she took two steps back before barely managing to stabilize herself. She looked at Qiao Nian, who was lying on the ground and moaning in pain, and a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

Qiao Nian was quite skilled. Had she specially practiced this?

Qiao Nian threw Takeda over her shoulder. She had the upper hand.

“It hurts, it hurts!” Takeda was writhing on the ground in pain, his brow furrowed.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with coldness. Without hesitation, she stepped on the back of Takeda’s hand.

There was a crisp crack, followed right on the heels of Takeda’s scream of pain. “Ah!!!”

Jiang Yue’s expression instantly darkened. It seemed that not only had Qiao Nian practiced martial arts before, but she had also trained well. She had casually crushed the bones in his hands.

After Qiao Nian finished dealing with Takeda, who was lying on the ground, she raised her eyebrows and looked at Jiang Yue. With a cold expression, she said, “Have you heard of this saying?”

“W-What did you say?”

“You’ve lured a wolf into your house. It’s still not certain who will be victorious today!” Qiao Nian moved her shoulders slightly, preparing to make a move.

Jiang Yue panicked, but she still pretended to be calm.

She had kidnapped Qiao Nian here behind Boss Jin’s back. She didn’t believe that Boss Jin would really offend the Gu family for her.

Jiang Yue initially wanted to find an opportunity to take revenge on Qiao Nian in the future. Last night, Boss Jin had a good time and transferred ten million yuan to her as pocket money.

At the thought that she could only earn ten million yuan after being humiliated for a night, she was no different from a hooker outside. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The only difference was that Boss Jin was generous to her. Ordinary people could not earn so much.

Jiang Yue had spent a lot of money to hire these people. She didn’t expect Takeda to be beaten to the ground by Qiao Nian. She cursed angrily, “Trash.”

She retracted her gaze from Takeda and her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing Qiao Nian’s calm expression, she yearned to step forward and tear her apart.

She raised her hand and clapped three times. At this moment, six bodyguards walked out of every corner of the room.

Jiang Yue had long learned her lesson from the past. Now, she had already learned to prepare a few back up plans, lest something went wrong with one plan and she lost the entire game.

Even so, she wouldn’t let Qiao Nian off. She wanted Qiao Nian to experience the pain of having her limbs cut off. She wanted Qiao Nian to beg for death.

Qiao Nian glanced coldly at the bodyguards, then at Jiang Yue’s face. She raised her eyebrows slightly. “It’s still not certain who will win!”

Jiang Yue thought that Qiao Nian was pretending to be calm. She smiled and said, “You don’t have to pretend to be calm in front of us. I know you’re very afraid. If you kneel down to me now, I’ll consider letting you live.”

“Let me live? Would you be so kind?” Qiao Nian didn’t think Jiang Yue would be so kind.

Jiang Yue raised her head high and smiled at Qiao Nian. “Second Sister-in-law, what are you saying? No matter what, you’re still my Second Sister-in-law. If you kneel down and beg me for mercy now, I’ll let you off on account of our past relationship.”

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Jiang Yue continued, “Second Sister-in-law, aren’t you going to kneel?”

Jiang Yue sat back down on the sofa and looked up at Qiao Nian with a disdainful smile. “Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone about you kneeling here and begging for mercy today. Brother Ah Zhou and Grandma won’t know what you’ve done either.”

“If you don’t beg for mercy, don’t blame me for being impolite.” Jiang Yue glanced at the bodyguards she had brought out and said smugly.
