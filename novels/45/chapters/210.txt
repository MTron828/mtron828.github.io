Chapter 211: Nian Nian Hit Me!

Chen Qing’s eyes flashed. He looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

Could it be that Second Young Master subconsciously didn’t want to ruin his date with Second Young Madam?

Second Young Master must have thought that it was fine to smash the other things he had prepared. He could just set it up again when Second Young Madam arrived.

However, Second Young Master had taken a lot of effort to specially purchase a crystal cup.

Had Second Young Master fallen for Second Young Madam?

Qiao Nian stood at the side. This was the first time she had seen Gu Zhou squatting in a corner helplessly, like a young child who needed help.

Qiao Nian’s heart instantly softened. She squatted down beside Gu Zhou and stroked his back, comforting him gently. “Gu Zhou, you’ll be fine. Take a deep breath. You’ll get better, I promise. Listen to me. Breathe in, then slowly breathe out…”

Gu Zhou’s eyes grew redder and redder, and his head began to ache terribly. He didn’t want anyone to see him like this. He turned to glare at the woman beside him, gritting his teeth. “Get lost!”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, he was so worried that cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He explained anxiously, “Second Young Madam, don’t mind him. Second Young Master can’t recognize anyone at this moment. He has nothing against you!”

Qiao Nian glanced at Chen Qing, then her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. She clenched her fists involuntarily, her mind racing. After a beat, she raised her hand and slapped Gu Zhou’s face.

The anger and hatred in Gu Zhou’s expression gradually dissipated, and his eyes no longer looked so red.

Chen Qing was shocked by Qiao Nian’s actions. He stammered, “Second… Second Young Madam, isn’t… isn’t this too violent?”

Qiao Nian’s attention was all on Gu Zhou. Frowning coldly, she berated, “Gu Zhou, I’m not just your wife. I’m also your doctor!”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian blankly.

“You’ve fallen ill. I have to stay with you until you recover!” Qiao Nian said coldly.

She didn’t know if Gu Zhou could hear her or understand what she was saying, but right now, she could only use this method to get Gu Zhou to cooperate with the treatment. Otherwise, in Gu Zhou’s crazed state, she wouldn’t be able to perform acupuncture on him!

One had to know that any procedure involving acupuncture required the patient’s full cooperation. If anything went wrong during the acupuncture process, Gu Zhou might become mentally retarded!

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou nervously. She had thought that Gu Zhou would regain consciousness, but he only paused for a moment. Then, he buried his head in his knees and hugged himself fiercely, curling into a ball. His whole body was shaking involuntarily!

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Chen Qing’s heart ached so much that tears welled up in his eyes. He said anxiously, “Second Young Madam, what should we do?”

Qiao Nian had never seen anything like this before either. She was extremely anxious. Her mind raced as she ran through every symptom she had seen in her career.

At this moment, Gu Zhou suddenly looked up.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou nervously and asked in a soft voice, “Are… Are you okay?”

The coldness on Gu Zhou’s face had disappeared. His phoenix-like eyes were filled with a childlike blankness as he looked at Qiao Nian innocently.

Qiao Nian looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes. She had a bad feeling about this.

Gu Zhou pouted, his phoenix-like eyes gradually turning misty. He looked at Qiao Nian pitifully and complained pathetically, “Nian Nian hit me!”

His voice was soft and childish, like a kid whining for attention.

Qiao Nian: ???

Chen Qing: !!!

Chen Qing ran to Gu Zhou in a panic and looked at him with wide eyes.

Oh my god!

Had Second Young Madam turned Second Young Master into a dunce just with a slap?

Trying hard to remain calm, Qiao Nian asked softly, “Gu Zhou, how do you feel now?”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian pitifully, sadness written all over his face. He spoke, “It hurts. Nian Nian hit me. My face hurts. Nian Nian, blow on it. Blow, blow. The pain will fly away!”

Qiao Nian: ...

Qiao Nian opened her mouth, but still couldn’t find anything to say.

Looking at Gu Zhou’s current state, Chen Qing was as anxious as a cat on a hot tin roof. He couldn’t help but ask, “Second Young Madam, what’s the situation now? Could Second Young Master… He won’t be like this for the rest of his life, will he?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
