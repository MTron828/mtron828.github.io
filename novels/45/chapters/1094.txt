1095 Triplets

Qiao Nian had been thinking about how to speak. When she heard Gu Zhou’s words, she smiled and led Gu Zhou to the sofa to sit down. She looked at Gu Zhou solemnly.

Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s serious gaze, and his expression involuntarily turned serious.

“I gave birth to triplets back then,” Qiao Nian said calmly, staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou’s face.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked at her in disbelief. His pupils dilated uncontrollably, and his voice trembled slightly. “Triplets?”

!!

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded slightly and said seriously, “Some time ago, I regained my memories of when I was pregnant. At that time, I took my pulse. I was pregnant with triplets, and…”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment before continuing, “I once tested Su Xue and Qiao Xin. Both of them knew that I gave birth to triplets. They even said that my three children were lost the moment they were born.”

“I believe them because my memories also tell me that I’m pregnant with triplets. Gu Qi and Xiao Shi are still alive. In other words, my third child is also alive, but he’s wandering outside now.” Qiao Nian’s expression became more and more serious as she voiced her thoughts.

Gu Zhou swallowed.

Qiao Nian had given him a huge surprise. At the same time, he felt very nervous.

Qiao Nian had given birth to triplets and had a wandering child outside. Gu Zhou preferred to look at evidence. “Are you sure the third child is still alive?”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s question, Qiao Nian shook her head gently and pursed her lips slightly. She sighed helplessly and said, “Actually, I’m not sure. I just think the chances of the child being alive are very high.”

“At that time, after you gave birth, where was the child beside you?” Gu Zhou asked.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her lips parted slightly. She sighed and said, “That night, Qin Chuan came to me to take care of me. He was also the one who arranged for the funeral of the two babies…” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Gu Zhou’s expression changed drastically. He was very happy to hear that Qiao Nian had given birth to three children, but there were two dead babies. “Could one of those two dead babies be…”

Before he could finish speaking, Qiao Nian interrupted Gu Zhou and shook her head. “No, I think our child is still alive.”

Worried that Gu Zhou wouldn’t believe her, Qiao Nian reached out and grabbed his hand. She said impatiently, “Think about it from another perspective. The dead baby beside me that night was sent over by someone else. If I gave birth to triplets, logically speaking, they should only have prepared one dead baby. It’s impossible for them to take two of my children away and leave only one behind.”

“I’m a doctor. During my pregnancy, I was recuperating. I’m very sure that my three children are very healthy. Their pulses are all strong. I don’t believe that I’ll give birth to a stillborn child!” With that, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou expectantly.

Gu Zhou nodded thoughtfully. Although he felt that Qiao Nian was right, he was thinking that if Qiao Nian gave birth to two living babies and a dead baby, those who had exchanged the babies would feel that there was no need to take the dead baby away. It was only right for them to leave the dead baby behind.

However, Qiao Nian was right about one thing. She was a doctor. Since she recalled her memories of when she was pregnant and remembered that the pulses of the three babies were normal, she would think that their physical conditions should be about the same.

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou said, “Alright, I’ll go investigate now. I think the three of them should look alike. Use Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s photos to find that child.”

Seeing that Gu Zhou believed her, Qiao Nian nodded and said, “I’ve also gotten someone to look for the child. I believe that the child will definitely live well. He must still be waiting for us to bring him home!”

Gu Zhou reached out and hugged Qiao Nian, gently patting her back. He comforted her gently, “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. We’ll definitely work hard to find the child.”

Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart gradually calmed down. She slowly closed her eyes and smelled Gu Zhou’s unique fragrance. Gradually, she felt comfortable and stable.
