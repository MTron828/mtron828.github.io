1028 Overeating

“As long as you like it and want to eat it, tell me.” Lu Nian smiled gently, his eyes sparkling. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When Lu Qi heard Lu Nian’s words, she said to Song Yu, who was sitting at the side, “Sister Song Yu, Second Brother is really too biased. He has never made anything delicious for us!”

Song Yu smiled and did not speak. She had only eaten Second Brother’s Imperial Feast once, and she had never eaten it again.

When Lu Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, he raised his eyebrows and said, “You don’t have to eat so much!”

“Second Brother!” Lu Qi had a little baby fat. Every time Lu Nian was unwilling to make an Imperial Feast for her, he would use an excuse to say that she was fat. “I’m clearly not fat at all. I just have baby fat!”

“Babies are all chubby,” Lu Nian said mercilessly.

Lu Qi was on the brink of tears. “Even if you don’t cook for me, why don’t you prepare an Imperial Feast for Sister Song Yu!”

“She’s an actress. She has to control her weight,” Lu Nian said calmly.

Song Yu’s eyes lit up. In the past, she had always thought that Second Brother didn’t like her, so he wasn’t willing to hold an Imperial Banquet for her.

It seemed that Second Brother was thinking about her career.

When Lu Nian looked at Qiao Nian, his gaze was so gentle that water could drip from it. “Sugar, what dishes do you want to eat? Tell Second Brother in the future. Second Brother will specially make them for you later.”

Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian pitifully and said coquettishly, “Sister, if I want to eat it in the future, can you help me tell Second Brother?”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh.

Matriarch Lu looked at Lu Qi helplessly and said, “Child, you specialize in making coincidences happen.”

“Grandma!”

Lu Nian said, “Don’t worry, if you appear, I won’t cook anymore.”

Everyone at the table instantly laughed.

Matriarch Lu was laughing so hard that tears welled up in her eyes. She said, “Alright, stop spouting nonsense. Let’s eat!”

After starting to pick up her chopsticks, Qiao Nian finally understood why Lu Nian was unwilling to cook for Lu Qi. It was because Lu Qi swiftly scooped three plates of dishes for her. Then, with lightning speed, she immediately finished all the dishes.

That’s right, they were all eaten.

Not only that, but Lu Qi also picked up three more plates.

Lu Qi ate at least a fifth of the entire table.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi’s round stomach. This was the first time she had seen Lu Qi so unattractive.

Second Brother was a good cook, but Qiao Nian didn’t have much of an appetite. She stopped eating when she was almost done.

Lu Nian silently remembered the dishes Qiao Nian had eaten.

After the meal, everyone went to the living room. Auntie Dong served everyone a cup of hawthorn water. This was helpful for digestion.

Lu Qi couldn’t sit down at all. She stood in the living room and walked back and forth, placing her right hand on her waist, like a pregnant woman.

Lu Nian really couldn’t bear to look at Lu Qi. He said, “Lu Qi, can’t you behave like a lady when you’re eating?”

“Second Brother, if you made me an Imperial Feast every day, I wouldn’t have eaten so much at once,” Lu Qi said matter-of-factly. “The dishes you make are like limited edition luxury goods. I can only eat them once in a while. Of course, I eat them with all my might.”

Seeing Lu Qi like this, Auntie Dong smiled. However, she suddenly recalled something. She looked at Matriarch Lu and asked, “Matriarch Lu, when will you tell Master and Madam that Eldest Miss has returned?”

When Lu Zhu heard Auntie Dong’s question, he hesitated for a moment before saying, “Auntie Dong, I’ve thought about this matter. I plan to tell Mom and Dad on my birthday. When the time comes, I’ll tell them about this surprise myself.”

Auntie Dong smiled. “That’s good too. There’s still a week.”

Matriarch Lu smiled at Auntie Dong and said, “Let the children worry about these things. It’s better to say the surprise in person.”

“Yes, Matriarch is right,” Auntie Dong agreed with a smile.

Song Yu walked in, holding a pair of walking sticks.

Matriarch Lu looked at Song Yu in confusion and asked, “Little Sixth, why are you holding a walking stick?”

Before Song Yu could answer, the walking stick in her hand was taken away by Lu Qi. Lu Qi smiled at Matriarch Lu and said, “Grandma, I’m quite tired from standing. I wanted to save my strength with the walking stick.”

Everyone: I can’t bear to watch!
