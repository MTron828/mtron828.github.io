Chapter 285: Not Afraid

Xia Xue’s heart jumped to her throat. She turned to look at Wang Xuan and pretended to be weak as she said gently, “It’s not like that. It’s mainly because Brother Cao is here too. I’m a little nervous. Of course, I believe someone like Qiao Nian will also be nervous in front of a big shot like Brother Cao, right?”

Gao Lin, who had been silent at the side, instantly understood. She hurriedly nodded and said, “That’s right. Not to mention Sister Xia Xue, even our university’s professors will feel nervous if they see a big shot like Brother Cao here. After all, Brother Cao is Mr. Dong Hua’s manager and the most famous musician in the world!”

When the other students heard Gao Lin’s words, they nodded in agreement. If it were them, they would also feel very nervous.

Qiao Nian gave Gao Lin and Xia Xue an indifferent glance, then took out her violin again.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s actions, Xia Xue was so nervous that her heart was about to jump out of her throat. She asked in surprise, “Student Qiao Nian, what are you trying to do?”

“I don’t want to do anything. I just want to see if I can perform at my normal level in front of Brother Cao.” Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and began to bow the strings.

She had no intention of playing Missing anymore.

This time, Qiao Nian chose a more complicated song.

The Dance of the Bees. This song was filled with energy and passion. It was only a little slower at the end.

When the music began, everyone was stunned.

Gao Lin and Xia Xue looked at Qiao Nian in shock.

How dare she?

How dare she play such a difficult song in front of Brother Cao? Wasn’t she afraid of making a mistake?

Wang Xuan knew that Qiao Nian was very talented, but she didn’t expect her to be so amazing. She could even play the song “The Dance of the Bees”.

Seeing Qiao Nian play the violin without restraint, Wang Xuan looked envious.

When the other students heard this song, their hearts jumped to their throats in excitement.

“Oh my god, this is actually The Dance of the Bees?”

“Who exactly is Qiao Nian? How can she play such a tune?”

“Is that really the legendary treasure girl? That’s amazing!”

The others didn’t dare to speak further, afraid that they would disturb Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian’s playing was simply too pleasant to the ear.

No one had expected a freshman to be able to play such a beautiful tune.

Brother Cao listened to the song seriously. Qiao Nian was quite talented, but she was a little arrogant and an eyesore to Mr. Dong Hua.

What a pity! What a pity!

If this little girl didn’t think of climbing into Mr. Dong Hua’s bed!

If this little girl didn’t offend Mr. Dong Hua!

He had to recruit this little girl under his name. When the time came, he would nurture her well. Then, he would be able to use her as a money tree.

However, Mr. Dong Hua could not tolerate even a speck of sand. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Brother Cao sighed silently. He could almost see his money saying goodbye to him.

The song ended!

Only then did Qiao Nian put down the violin. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly as she looked unblinkingly at Xia Xue and asked, “Senior Xia Xue, you’re Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. Why don’t you use your professional judgment to give me a score for this performance? Is that okay?”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and smiled brightly at Xia Xue. She remembered that Xia Xue wanted to vomit blood.

As Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician, Xia Xue had a supreme honor.

If she hadn’t played the violin just now, or if she had played the violin perfectly, Xia Xue could still accept this title calmly.

But now, Xia Xue felt that this form of address only embarrassed her.

Gao Lin, who was standing at the side, glared daggers at Qiao Nian. She didn’t know how to describe her current feelings. She clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms. She tried hard to maintain her composure.

Although she didn’t want to admit it, she had to admit that Qiao Nian was truly amazing.

Qiao Nian knew everything.

But Qiao Nian was clearly a country bumpkin, a self-taught talent. How could she know the zither and violin? Moreover, how could she know so many famous songs?

What surprised Gao Lin was that every piece Qiao Nian played was comparable to the original composition.
