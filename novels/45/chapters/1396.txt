Song Yu was an actress. She knew how to put on a sincere expression.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. After some thought, she nodded. “I understand what you mean. I’ll find more people to take care of Qi Qi. I won’t let Qi Qi be hurt.”

With Qiao Nian’s assurance, Song Yu smiled in relief and said, “That’s good. I’ll guard the door of the ward today.”

“Just get the doctor to arrange a bed for you to sleep in the same ward as Qi Qi,” Qiao Nian said with a smile. She really treated Song Yu as someone close to her now. As long as Song Yu didn’t do anything inappropriate, she didn’t mind having another sister.

Song Yu shook her head and said, “There’s no need. I’ll be outside. I can keep an eye on the situation outside. If a stranger really wants to enter Qi Qi’s room, I’ll get someone to stop him immediately.”

“Thank you for your hard work.” Qiao Nian gave Song Yu a few more reminders and said, “I’ll go take a look at Qin Chuan first. Take good care of Qi Qi.”

Song Yu nodded.

Qiao Nian turned around and entered Qin Chuan’s ward. Thinking of what Song Yu had just said, her eyes were filled with complicated emotions.

Just now, Song Yu had said that she had helped Qi Qi find someone to divination reading. She learnt that Qi Qi might suffer a calamity soon. She did not believe such a thing.

However, those people from Europe would definitely not let the matter rest. It was always good to have another person take care of Qi Qi. She wondered if her brothers had found the traitor. Seeing Qiao Nian enter, Qin Chuan looked up at her and asked, “Did you pass by Qi Qi’s ward just now? Is Qi Qi asleep now?”

Qiao Nian smiled at Qin Chuan and raised her eyebrows slightly. She teased, “You’re really concerned about her.”

Qin Chuan smiled calmly and didn’t say anything.

“You should be asleep. If there’s anything, we’ll talk tomorrow. Rest well today,” Qiao Nian said. “Are you hungry now?”

“A little.” Qiao Nian was about to order takeout when there was a knock on the door.

“Come in.” As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, she saw Gu Zhou push the door open. A trace of surprise flashed in her eyes as she asked in surprise, “It’s already so late. Why are you still here?”

Gu Zhou nodded and glanced at Qin Chuan, who had already woken up. Only then did he look at Qiao Nian and say, “I’m bringing you back to rest.”

“There’s no need. I’ll just stand guard here,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou frowned slightly and said, “Let Chen Qing stay here. It’ll be more convenient for him to take care of him than you.”

Chen Qing followed Gu Zhou in. Holding a lunch box in one hand and a basket of fruits in the other, he smiled at Qiao Nian. “Hello, Madam. Hello, Mr. Qin.”

He had just bought fruits at the entrance of the hospital. Second Young Master had turned around and disappeared. He hurriedly ran over and realized that Second Young Master had rushed to the ward first. Second Young Master must be anxious to see Second Young Madam.

Qiao Nian looked at the sweat on Chen Qing’s forehead. She was now 100% certain that Chen Qing was really omnipotent. He could do anything.

Qiao Nian felt that if Qin Chuan went to the bathroom, it would be more convenient if Chen Qing was around. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Now that Qin Chuan was awake, she was relieved.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian nodded and said, “Alright!”

Gu Zhou smiled at Qin Chuan and said softly, “Mr. Qin, if you need anything, just instruct Chen Qing to do it.”

Qin Chuan looked at Gu Zhou and nodded.

Seeing Qiao Nian walking over, Gu Zhou reached out and took her hand, leading her out.

After the two of them entered the elevator, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and asked seriously, “Did you find anything when you went to the Lu family?”

Qiao Nian’s expression was serious as she waited quietly for Gu Zhou to answer.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he frowned imperceptibly. Without hesitation, he pressed Qiao Nian against the elevator wall. His bottomless eyes stared unblinkingly at her.

Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s eyes and couldn’t help but feel nervous. Seeing his cold expression, she asked in confusion, “What’s wrong?”

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened, and he pursed his lips unhappily. Only then did he ask, “If I didn’t pick you up, were you planning to stay here and take care of him for the night?”
