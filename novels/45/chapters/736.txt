737 Mrs. Gu, Please Get Out of the Car!

“Gu Chuan?” Gu Zhou murmured.

This person had never existed in his memory.

But why did Qiao Nian say that he was Gu Chuan?

At the thought of this name, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but have a headache.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian hurriedly unbuckled her seatbelt and moved closer to Gu Zhou. She gently massaged Gu Zhou’s temples and said gently, “If you can’t remember, don’t think about it. Actually, it’s fine. Don’t worry too much about this.”

Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian, inadvertently meeting her gentle eyes.

The way she looked at him was gentle, like spring sunshine. It instantly soothed his uneasy heart. He calmed down.

Chen Qing took a taxi back himself. He was about to open the door for Second Young Master and Second Young Madam when he saw Second Young Madam approaching Second Young Master through the windshield.

Oh my god!

Had they kissed?

Chen Qing’s lips curved up involuntarily.

It seemed that Second Young Master and Second Young Madam had gotten closer.

With this thought in mind, Chen Qing silently walked to the side. It was better not to disturb Second Young Master and Second Young Madam’s loving relationship.

At this moment, Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in front of him. In a daze, a strange scene flashed across his mind.

He walked alone in the stormy night. Everything in front of him swayed, and he couldn’t see clearly.

The scene changed. He seemed to have pressed Qiao Nian against the wall, asking her in a low voice if she remembered him.

Strange.

Where did this memory come from?

Gu Zhou tried his best to take in his surroundings. If he remembered correctly, this should have happened at the MY Hotel.

Another scene appeared in front of him. He seemed to see himself picking Qiao Nian up in his arms and throwing her onto the bed, biting her lips mercilessly.

He seemed to be able to understand the bitterness, sadness, and displeasure in his heart at that time.

These images gradually became clearer. Gu Zhou’s heart sank, but he felt even more uneasy.

Gu Zhou had heard from others in the past that this was called multiple personalities. In other words, there was another personality in his body, Gu Chuan.

He vaguely realized that Gu Chuan was very possessive of Qiao Nian. He yearned to integrate Qiao Nian into his blood.

Gu Zhou looked up, his gaze landing on Qiao Nian’s lips.

There was a small cut on Qiao Nian’s lip.

At that time, he had even asked Qiao Nian what was wrong with her lips. Qiao Nian had said that she had accidentally knocked into something.

So he was the culprit.

Seeing Gu Zhou looking at her, Qiao Nian asked, “How are you now? Are you feeling better?”

Gu Zhou raised his hand to touch Qiao Nian’s lips. His thumb gently touched the wound on her lips and asked softly, “Does it still hurt?”

Qiao Nian didn’t understand why Gu Zhou would ask this. She said honestly, “It doesn’t hurt anymore. It’s not a big deal!”

Gu Zhou continued asking, “Did I hurt you?”

Qiao Nian smiled.

Although Gu Chuan was a terrifying person, Gu Zhou did not do these things.

She heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Gu Zhou did not reject Gu Chuan.

Initially, she was worried that Gu Zhou would be especially angry when he found out about Gu Chuan’s personality. Now, it seemed that she was overthinking.

Wait, she seemed to have discovered something.

“It’s fine. It doesn’t hurt anymore.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. The reason why she had recognized Gu Zhou as Gu Chuan just now was not only because Gu Zhou had called her Nian’er, but also because of his gaze. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

At that time, Gu Zhou’s gaze was very similar to Gu Chuan’s. That was why she had exposed her mistake.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly.

Could it be that Gu Chuan was someone Gu Zhou had been suppressing?

Then why was Gu Zhou showing Gu Chuan’s expression now?

Qiao Nian thought for a long time, but couldn’t figure out the key. She smiled at Gu Zhou and said, “Let’s go back!”

Gu Zhou’s eyes were filled with laughter. His voice was low and magnetic, and his lips curved up slightly. “Okay.”

Gu Zhou got out of the car first. He walked to the front passenger seat and opened the door.

He made a gesture of holding a bouquet of flowers and handed it to Qiao Nian, his voice laced with joy. “Mrs. Gu, please get out of the car!”
