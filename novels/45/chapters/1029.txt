1030 Thank You

Although Qiao Nian hadn’t finished speaking, Gu Zhou already understood what she meant. He said, “I’ll accompany you to visit Grandma Qiao’s grave tomorrow.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she smiled and said, “Okay.”

At this moment, Qiao Nian realized that she was already used to Gu Zhou being by her side.

Ever since she had married Gu Zhou on behalf of Qiao Xin, Gu Zhou had been by her side, guarding her.

!!

She hadn’t noticed this before. She had only just realized it.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She called out, “Gu Zhou.”

“Hm?”

The tips of Qiao Nian’s ears turned slightly red as she stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. Recalling everything that had happened in the past, she smiled and said, “Thank you.”

Thank you for always protecting me!

Thank you for always treating me well!

There was a smile in Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes. His lips curved up slightly as he asked mischievously, “How do you want to thank me? You should take some practical action!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to say such a thing. She had a bad feeling about this. Puzzled, she asked, “How do you want me to thank you?”

“Why don’t we go to the Dongjiang villa tonight?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

In the end, her mind was filled with thoughts of going to the Dongjiang villa.

After a long while, she asked calmly, “Other than that, do you have any other normal thoughts in your mind?”

“How is this idea abnormal?” Gu Zhou asked with a smile.

Qiao Nian asked, “Then what do you think is normal?”

“We’re just going to live in a Dongjiang villa. Besides,” Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “Many people go away to live alone after they get married.”

“But we’re not like them—”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she heard footsteps from afar. She turned her head and saw Lu Zhu walking out.

Lu Zhu smiled at Qiao Nian and asked gently, “What are you talking about?”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but swallow her words. She couldn’t tell her brother where she and Gu Zhou were going!

If she really said it, Gu Zhou would probably be beaten up by his brothers.

Qiao Nian hurriedly threw those messy thoughts to the back of her mind. She smiled at Lu Zhu and said, “It’s nothing.”

Gu Zhou’s expression was a little ugly. He looked at Lu Zhu unhappily.

Qiao Nian had always been by Gu Zhou’s side, so she naturally knew his every thought.

Gu Zhou must be feeling uncomfortable because he had not received her answer.

Lu Zhu was in a good mood and did not notice Gu Zhou’s expression at all. He said, “Sugar, I have something to tell you.”

Qiao Nian’s expression turned serious. “Brother, what’s the matter?”

Lu Zhu took out his phone, found the surveillance cameras, and handed them to Qiao Nian.

Puzzled, Qiao Nian took the cell phone. When she saw the video, her expression faltered slightly.

Qiao Xin was alone in a bedroom, hugging a pillow in a daze. She didn’t look well, as if she was in shock.

Lu Zhu swiped to the left and another video appeared. In the video, He Cheng was knocking heavily on the metal window with a stick, as if he wanted to escape through it.

Qiao Nian turned back to look at Qiao Xin, as if she had thought of something. She looked up at Lu Zhu and asked, “Brother, did you tie them up?”

“Yes.” Lu Zhu nodded without hesitation and asked, “I’ll leave the two of them to you.”

It felt good to have her brother dote on her.

Qiao Nian looked down at Qiao Xin in the video. She still remembered that every time Qiao Xin looked for her, Qiao Yu would always speak up for her.

At that time, she really hoped that she had a brother who doted on her.

Perhaps God had really heard her prayers and now gave her four brothers.

Smiling, Qiao Nian returned the phone to Lu Zhu and said happily, “Thank you, Brother. However, let me think about how to deal with them.”

“Yes, we’ll go over together later.” Lu Zhu smiled.

“Okay.” Qiao Nian’s mind was in a mess. She hadn’t thought of a solution.

“Sugar.”

At this moment, Matriarch Lu walked out.
