Chapter 643: Explain It to Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and asked with a smile, “Gu Zhou, are you suspecting that I have an improper relationship with Lu Zhu?”

Gu Zhou turned to glance at Qiao Nian and asked, “Hm?”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Gu Zhou still cared about these things. She hurriedly explained, “Gu Zhou, you have to believe us. He’s your brother. He won’t do anything to betray you. We’re legally husband and wife. I won’t betray you either. I just treat Lu Zhu as my older brother.”

They were legally husband and wife.

When Gu Zhou heard this, he frowned slightly.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s explanation, he felt much happier. However, when he heard that he and Qiao Nian were only legally married, his expression darkened.

Gu Zhou’s eyes flickered. Suppressing his displeasure, he asked, “Are you trying to explain yourself to me?”

The man’s voice was as low and hoarse as ever, carrying a bewitching allure.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Then, she said honestly, “Yes, I just didn’t want you to misunderstand.”

When Gu Zhou heard this, he felt much happier. He said indifferently, “I’ve never misunderstood.”

“Yes, I misunderstood then,” Qiao Nian said calmly, silently rolling her eyes.

He had even said that there was no misunderstanding. Wasn’t he the one who had been angry just now?

Qiao Nian really couldn’t understand why Gu Zhou didn’t like her. Moreover, they were only legally married, but Gu Zhou was very possessive of her. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was better to avoid trouble. Qiao Nian felt that it was better not to do anything that would cause Gu Zhou to misunderstand.

After all, it was not a big deal if Gu Zhou got angry. If Gu Chuan ran out again, things would get out of hand.

Soon, they arrived at Yong’an Building.

Qiao Nian unbuckled her seatbelt and heard Gu Zhou ask, “Should I pick you up later?”

Huh?

Was Gu Zhou so free today?

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou in confusion. There was a hint of a smile in his eyes.

His eyes were very bright, just like Gu Qi’s when he looked at her. They were sparkling, making one unable to look away.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. For some reason, she felt that Gu Zhou and Gu Qi looked a little alike.

She must be overthinking.

How could Gu Zhou be related to Gu Qi?

Perhaps it was because Gu Zhou wasn’t as cold as he usually was that she had an illusion.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze and smiled. “There’s no need. Stay at home with Little Qi. I’ll take a taxi home.”

Gu Zhou thought for a while and said, “Then I’ll get my brother to send you back.”

Lu Nian was sending her home?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart began to race.

It seemed to be a good feeling to be sent home by her brother.

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Okay.”

Actually, Gu Zhou was quite reasonable.

Qiao Nian got out of the car and leaned forward slightly. Through the window of the passenger seat, she said to Gu Zhou, “Be careful on the road.”

Gu Zhou’s eyes flickered and he nodded.

“Bye.” Qiao Nian waved at Gu Zhou and walked into the Yong’an Building.

At this moment, there were still many people on the street. Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s back. He recalled Lu Zhu’s attitude when he spoke to Qiao Nian, and the way Qiao Yu looked at her.

His gaze fell on the passers-by again. Many men were looking at Qiao Nian greedily.

He gripped the steering wheel involuntarily, his knuckles turning white.

When Qiao Nian’s back disappeared into the Yongan Building, his heart felt a little empty, as if he had lost something important.

Gu Zhou’s Adam’s apple bobbed slightly, and his breathing became erratic.

Right now, he just wanted to bring Qiao Nian home and hide her well.

At that time.

Only he could see her.

When Qiao Nian walked into the Yongan Building, the burning gaze that had been fixed on her disappeared. She heaved a sigh of relief and turned back to see Gu Zhou’s car still parked in the same spot.

Strange.

What was wrong with Gu Zhou today? Did he want to eat her up?
