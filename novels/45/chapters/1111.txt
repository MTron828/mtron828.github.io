1112 Unlocking Luban

As the butler spoke, he placed the small cardboard box by the desk.

“Thank you!” Qiao Nian smiled at the butler.

“Young Madam, you’re too polite. Go ahead! Call me if you need anything!”

“Alright.”

!!

After the butler left, he didn’t forget to close the door.

Qiao Nian took out a wooden box made of Luban locks from the paper box. This wooden box wasn’t big. From the gaps exposed, she could tell that there was a notebook inside. It should be Jiang Cheng’s diary!

She hoped that she could find some promising clues in the diary. With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian began to unlock the Luban locks seriously!

She had played with many Luban locks in the past. This lock was not difficult for her at all.

Those who had never come into contact with a Luban lock might not have a clue!

About ten minutes later, Qiao Nian unlocked the Luban lock and took out the diary.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and flipped to the first page.

[Sunday. 2.26. The weather is overcast.

Seven years ago, on this day, my mother passed away from an illness. Today, I received the medical report of Big Brother and me. I realized that Big Brother had the same illness as my mother. So that illness is a genetic illness! Big Brother is very busy with work and often stays up all night. This will accelerate the reproduction of the virus in his body. I have to study medicine well. When the time comes, I’ll treat Big Brother’s illness. I won’t let him leave me early!]

When Qiao Nian saw this, her expression faltered slightly. She had seen Jiang Chi before, but his expression was as usual. He didn’t seem to have a genetic disease. Could it be that the virus in Jiang Chi’s body had temporarily stabilized?

From Jiang Cheng’s diary, it could be seen that Jiang Cheng cared a lot about Jiang Chi. No wonder Jiang Cheng chose to study medicine. He probably didn’t like to study medicine, but to save Jiang Cheng.

Qiao Nian turned to the next page.

[Monday, 2.27. The weather is clear.

The weather today is very good, but Big Brother’s health isn’t good. His illness flared up. Fortunately, I was by his side at that time and saved him in time. If I hadn’t been by Big Brother’s side, would that genetic illness have taken him away from me again? I can’t wait any longer. I have to operate on Big Brother as soon as possible!]

[Tuesday, 2.28. It’s drizzling.

I can’t let him find out. I have to be careful…]

When Qiao Nian saw the diary entry on the 28th of Feburary written by Jiang Cheng, she was puzzled. Was the “he” referring to Jiang Chi?

Qiao Nian temporarily suppressed the confusion in her heart and flipped to the next page. When she saw that the date was written on April 6th, she was stunned!

[Thursday, 4.6. The weather is clear.

That’s great. If Big Brother’s surgery is successful, he won’t die!!!]

Qiao Nian could tell from the many exclamation marks in Jiang Cheng that he had been very happy!

Her face was filled with confusion. Why hadn’t Jiang Cheng written in his diary in March?

The number on this diary was twelve. In other words, this was the twelfth diary in Jiang Cheng. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

How could someone who had written twelve diaries not have written for more than a month?

If Jiang Cheng had been preparing to perform surgery on Jiang Chi during that period of time, he should have noted down the progress of the surgery.

Qiao Nian temporarily suppressed the doubts in her heart and continued reading!

[Friday, 4.7. It’s raining.

So it was so painful when my illness acted up. Big Brother was really brave in the past. He didn’t even frown. I don’t know how long I can live now, but as long as Big Brother can survive, I’m very happy!!!]

When my illness acted up?

What did Jiang Cheng mean by this?

The person with hereditary illness was Jiang Chi, not Jiang Cheng. Why did Jiang Cheng say that he felt very uncomfortable when he was sick?

Could it be that Jiang Cheng had experienced the pain of Jiang Chi’s relapse?

Or could it be that Jiang Cheng had already transferred Jiang Chi’s genetic illness to him?

Qiao Nian’s mind was filled with confusion. She continued reading.

[On Saturday, 4.8, heavy rain.

Today, when I was drinking coffee at the cafe, I bumped into Brother Gu Yue. He also saw me. Seeing that I didn’t look well, he even asked a few more questions. Just as Brother Gu Yue was about to leave, he even asked why I was in the same state as Big Brother? Could it be that Brother Gu Yue has discovered that there’s something wrong with my health? I just hope he won’t tell Big Brother. I don’t want him to know the truth!
