1099 Jealousy

Qiao Nian walked out of the house leisurely. When she saw the woman lying on the ground in pain, she finally recognized her. She smiled and said, “It’s not even the new year yet. Why are you giving me such a big bow? I have to make it clear in advance. I can’t give you any New Year’s money!”

When Shen Fang heard this voice, she was slightly stunned. She looked up and saw Qiao Nian standing beside Gu Zhou. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Qiao Nian was wearing a long white sweater that barely reached her knees. Underneath, she was wearing a pair of brown boots. Her seaweed-like hair fell over her shoulders, and the cold wind swayed her pearl earrings, making her face look even fairer.

She hadn’t seen Qiao Nian in six years. Qiao Nian looked even prettier than before, and she exuded an air of arrogance!

In the past, she had never liked Qiao Nian’s arrogance. They were clearly all from the village. Why did Qiao Nian have that sense of superiority?

Ever since she was young, she had hated Qiao Nian the most!

Initially, she was the best-looking person in the village, but because of Qiao Nian, she could only be second.

Later on, everyone found out that Qiao Nian had been admitted to the mental hospital. She had become the most beautiful person in the village again!

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and frowned slightly. “Do you know her?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded. She sneered at Shen Fang and asked, “How can I not know Xu Qiu’s daughter, Shen Fang?”

Xu Qiu?

Xu Qiu’s two-hundred-pound body appeared in Gu Zhou’s mind. He stepped even harder, wishing he could crush Shen Fang’s hand!

After all, he hated the Shen family the most now!

Shen Fang screamed in pain. She was now completely certain that the bones in her hand might have been broken!

Shen Fang was in so much pain that tears streamed down her face. She looked at Qiao Nian pleadingly, having no choice but to beg for mercy from the person she hated the most. “Sister Nian Nian, I beg you, please make Brother Ah Zhou let go of me. My hand hurts…”

Shen Fang was now completely certain that Gu Zhou had been brainwashed by Qiao Nian. In the past, Qiao Nian liked to brainwash the boys in their village, making all the boys in their village think that Qiao Nian was the most beautiful!

Qiao Nian said lightly, “This is his business, not mine. Nothing I say will work! This matter mainly depends on his own decision!”

Qiao Nian remembered very clearly that when she was in the Shen family in the past, Shen Fang had spread all kinds of rumors. Shen Fang even said that she had seduced a man and had an abortion!

Actually, that was not the case at all. At that time, Shen Fang had a crush on her Eldest Senior Brother. Eldest Senior Brother had never been willing to interact with Shen Fang, nor was he willing to speak to her. However, Eldest Senior Brother took good care of her!

Previously, Shen Fang forced her to leave Eldest Senior Brother. She even said that if she did not leave Eldest Senior Brother, her reputation would be ruined!

In the beginning, she just wanted to ruin her reputation. Later on, Shen Fang found Xu Cai in the village to rape her!

At that time, Xu Cai had drunk a lot of wine. He barged into her room, wanting to make love with her!

Shen Fang had even deliberately invited Eldest Senior Brother over to catch them in the act!

However, what Shen Fang did not expect was that she had already beaten Xu Cai to the ground.

When Eldest Senior Brother came, she told him that Xu Cai wanted to bully her. Eldest Senior Brother mercilessly beat Xu Cai up again!

Now that Shen Fang had angered Gu Zhou, how could she speak up for her and ask Gu Zhou to let her go?

Shen Fang was still as innocent as ever!

To be precise, Shen Fang was as stupid as ever!

Shen Fang had never expected Qiao Nian to be so heartless. She now understood that it was useless no matter how much she begged Qiao Nian. She could only beg Gu Zhou.

Shen Fang looked at Gu Zhou with teary eyes and said pitifully, “Brother Ah Zhou, I really accidentally bumped into you just now. Only you can let me go!”

Shen Fang said these words breathlessly. Her body was very weak now, as if she would faint in the next moment!

“If you dare to come here again, don’t even think about saving your other hand!” Gu Zhou said coldly, the impatience in his eyes obvious.
