1067 Idol

Holding the photos of Qiao Nian when she was young, Matriarch Lu rambled on and on, arranging for her eldest grandsons to prepare gifts for Qiao Nian!

She had a nagging feeling that the preparations at home for Qiao Nian’s return were too shabby!

It was not until ten at night that Matriarch Lu let everyone rest.

Lu Qi heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly ran towards her room, afraid that she would be caught by Grandma if she was a step slower. Then, she would have to listen to his sister’s story when she was young.

After Lu Qi returned to her room, the light in her eyes gradually dimmed. She looked at the computer screen in a daze.

After a long time, Lu Qi moved the mouse to a word. She pursed her lips and finally sent the document out by email.

The inbox was an overseas address. After she sent it, she heaved a sigh of relief, her eyes filled with stars.

At this moment, Jiang Chi, who was far away in MY, received an email.

Jiang Chi glanced at his inbox and seemed to have thought of something. He couldn’t wait to open his email.

He thought that Qiao Nian had sent him the email from An City.

However, when he saw the name of the email, disappointment flashed across his eyes. This wasn’t an email from Qiao Nian, but an email from a netizen called “Qi Qi”?

The content was: “Mr. Jiang, I’ve already completed the question you posted online. Please take the time to take a look.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Jiang Chi frowned slightly. After opening the document and reading its contents, his eyes gradually darkened.

Jiang Chi stood up and walked to the safe at the side. He took out an old laptop.

He opened his notebook, which was a little slow to boot up. He sat there calmly, then opened a document on the table. This document was the answer to the online question.

Jiang Chi began to compare the answers…

After sending the email, Lu Qi lay on the bed anxiously and waited. She wondered if Mr. Jiang would reply to her.

Mr. Jiang was a genius doctor. His email must be filled to the brim. It was normal for him not to be able to see her email for a moment.

When would she be able to meet the genius Doctor Jiang?

Just as Lu Qi was wondering when Doctor Jiang would reply to her message, her computer rang.

She turned on her computer and saw that it was an email from Doctor Jiang!

Lu Qi’s eyes lit up. She didn’t expect Dr. Jiang to reply to her message so quickly. She was overjoyed and hurriedly opened her email.

There were a total of twenty questions, but she had only gotten one wrong!

Although her grades were so good, it had taken her seven years to solve them.

She had consulted many people about these questions.

She was just an ordinary hardworking person. She was really envious of a genius like Doctor Jiang!

Seven years ago, she was still a junior high student. At that time, she liked to read books about medicine. Later on, she accidentally saw Mr. Jiang’s post and found out that he studied medicine.

Mr. Jiang’s insights were very unique, and the content of his post was also very interesting. He told her about boring medicine, making her involuntarily like medical knowledge more.

Mr. Jiang had posted many posts. She liked Mr. Jiang’s views very much. She would read Mr. Jiang’s posts seriously, and she admired him more and more!

She was very curious now. What exactly did Mr. Jiang look like?

Lu Qi had a nagging feeling that a genius like Mr. Jiang must be very handsome!

Lu Qi clenched her fists involuntarily, her palms covered in nervous sweat. She hesitated for a moment before sending an email.

[Mr. Jiang, if I can solve the last question, can we meet?]

Jiang Chi was about to turn off his computer when he saw the new email. He subconsciously opened it and took a look.

Not many people read his posts, because some things were more profound. No one who wasn’t a professional was willing to read them.

However, under the post, this netizen called Qi Qi often expressed her opinions. It was obvious that she was a crazy fan.

Jiang Chi’s eyes darkened. Unfortunately, the person Qi Qi wanted to see was no longer around!

These posts were all published by his younger brother, who had long passed away!

In the past, his brother had even said that he was willing to marry whoever could answer his questions!

Unfortunately, his brother would never be able to fulfill this wish!
