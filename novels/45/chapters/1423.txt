1424 Love Rival?

Gu Ting stopped drinking his red wine and continued, “The things here are almost done. During the new year, I’ll go home to visit Grandma.”

Gu Ting had already arranged the rest of the trip. After the new year, he would urge Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian to hold their wedding ceremony. He didn’t want Sugar to suffer after marrying into the Gu family.

However, before the new year, he had to settle the matter between him and Bai Hui. He couldn’t delay it forever.

Qiao Nian smiled, her eyes curving into crescents. “If Grandma finds out about this, she’ll definitely be very happy.”

Seeing the bright smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Gu Ting was also infected. His lips curved up slightly.

Every time he saw Sugar, he couldn’t help but think of his eldest daughter with Bai Hui.

If their daughter survived, would she smile as sweetly as Sugar?

Gu Ting’s thoughts gradually drifted away.

At this moment, a voice interrupted Gu Ting’s thoughts.

“Mr. Gu!”

The girl’s voice was gentle and crisp.

Qiao Nian looked over and saw a girl in a Chinese cheongsam. Her long brown hair was tied up high, and there was a white jade hairpin in her hair. Her facial features were deep, and her eyes were a beautiful blue.

Her red lips curved up slightly, giving off a sunny and confident feeling.

Qiao Nian looked at the girl in front of her, a trace of familiarity flashing in her eyes. She seemed to have seen her before, but she couldn’t remember.

Gu Ting, who was sitting opposite Gu Zhou, stood up and said very politely, “Seventh Princess.”

When Qiao Nian heard how Gu Ting addressed that girl, she suddenly remembered. She had seen her in the newspapers before. She was the daughter of the European President and his third wife. She was the seventh child in the entire family. Everyone called her the Seventh Princess. Her name was Lina Smith.

No wonder she found the woman in front of her familiar.

At this moment, discussions broke out around them.

“Oh my god, the Seventh Princess really went over!”

“When those two people appeared at the airport previously, the Seventh Princess even liked their photos!”

“Looks like the Seventh Princess has taken a liking to that man!”

…

There was a gentle smile on Lina Smith’s face. Her beautiful blue eyes sparkled like sapphires under the light. “Mr. Gu, thank you so much for what happened before!”

As she spoke, she glanced at Gu Zhou from the corner of her eye, and her breathing hitched.

This man was even more handsome than in the photos. She had been born into the royal family. Although she had seen many handsome men, those men seemed to pale in comparison to this man.

His fingers were long and slender as he gently touched the pendant with his big thumb. His gaze fell on the window, as if he was thinking about something.

In the past, she had heard from others that an Asian man’s face was relatively flat and not good-looking at all. However, this man’s side profile seemed to be the most perfect masterpiece in heaven.

He had a high nose bridge and thin, sexy lips. One really couldn’t take their eyes off him. The typically description of an Asian man didn’t look like him at all.

Sensing Lina Smith’s gaze, a trace of displeasure flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes. His expression instantly turned cold, and he exuded a cold aura. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Sensing Gu Zhou’s displeasure, Lina Smith hurriedly retracted her gaze. It was very impolite to stare at a stranger for a long time. She looked at Gu Ting and asked, “Mr. Gu, can I eat with you?”

Gu Ting gave a gentlemanly smile. “Of course…”

Gu Zhou interrupted Gu Ting mercilessly. “I mind very much!”

Lina was stunned. She was the daughter of the president of Europe and was a high and mighty princess. She had been pampered since she was young. No one would reject her.

This man was the first to reject her.

Gu Ting was slightly stunned. Gu Zhou should know very well how he had addressed Lina just now. In other words, Gu Zhou clearly knew that Lina was the Seventh Princess, but he still rejected her so bluntly.

Gu Zhou’s cold personality was exactly the same as when he was young.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang. She looked down at her cell phone and had a thought.
