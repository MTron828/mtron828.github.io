1176 Shut up!

“You don’t have to worry about this. I’ve already done a match test before. Her bone marrow is completely compatible with my daughter’s bone marrow. All you have to do here is perform the surgery!” the woman said happily, as if she could already see her daughter getting better.

Thank you readers!

Shen An frowned and asked, “Where did you get Lu Nian’s blood?”

If they wanted to do a bone marrow transplant, they needed to test if their venous blood matched.

Lu Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, and many people around her took care of her. How did this woman get Lu Nian’s intravenous blood? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Could it be that you’re a member of the Lu family, or that you’ve already planted your spies in the Lu family?” Shen An asked impatiently. He wanted to investigate who had done such a crazy thing.

“Don’t even think about getting information out of me. Some things can only be kept a secret by the dead. If you want to live with your daughter, then shut your mouth. Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask!” The woman’s voice grew colder and colder.

“I understand!” Under such circumstances, Shen An had no choice but to shut up.

The sound of high heels behind her grew further and further away. The woman left. The bodyguards walked up to Shen An and untied him. Then, they put a blindfold on him. After walking for about five minutes, Shen An was brought to a room.

The bodyguard took off his blindfold. This was the operating theater, and everything was there.

Shen An’s mind raced. Then, he picked up the anesthetic needle.

The bodyguard looked at the anesthetic needle in Shen An’s hand and asked with a frown, “Just tie her up here later and give her anesthesia!”

“She knows me.” Shen An gripped the anesthetic needle in his hand tightly and said with a serious expression, “If we forcefully anesthetize her, what if something goes wrong midway?”

Before the bodyguard could speak, he heard Shen An continue, “If a person is anesthetized in a stable state, the chances of the surgery being successful are higher!”

The bodyguard frowned. Just as he was about to say something, Shen An continued, “Anyway, you’re all guarding by the side. Where can I run to with the child? Besides, my daughter is also in your hands. I can’t leave her alone!”

The bodyguard put his earpiece in his ear. There seemed to be an order coming from the earpiece. He nodded slightly and said, “Okay,” to the person on the other side of the earpiece. Then, he looked at Shen An. “Okay!”

The bodyguard brought Shen An to the room next door. He pushed the door open and pushed Shen An in.

Shen An immediately saw the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian, lying on the ground. She was small and curled up in a ball. Her clothes were dirty, and there were still tears on her face. She must have fallen asleep from crying.

There were still a few clear palm prints on her fair face, and there was a scab on her forehead. It was obvious that she had been beaten up.

Shen An thought of his daughter again. His heart ached as he walked to the girl’s side. Just as he bent down and was about to pick Little Lu Nian up, the girl suddenly opened her eyes.

“Go away. Don’t touch me. Don’t hit me. I want my father and mother. Sob, Brother! There are bad people who want to bully me… Sob…”

When Shen An saw her like this, his heart ached so much that his eyes turned red. He said softly, “Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid. It’s your Grandpa Shen, your mother’s teacher. I even gave you red packet money. Do you remember?”

When the little girl heard Shen An’s words, she immediately stopped crying. She raised her hand to wipe her tears and looked at him timidly. When she recognized that the man in front of her was someone familiar, she immediately rushed into Shen An’s arms and cried!

“Grandpa Shen, Sugar doesn’t want to be here. Sugar wants to go home.” The more the little girl spoke, the more aggrieved she became. Her tears couldn’t help but fall. “They’re all big baddies. They even said that I’m a little bastard. I’m clearly the child of my father and mother, but they still scolded my father and mother. Sob… Sugar is so afraid!”
