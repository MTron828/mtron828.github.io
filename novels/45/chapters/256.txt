Chapter 257: Olive Branch

When the other students heard Gao Lin’s words, they nodded in agreement. “Gao Lin is indeed on good terms with Senior Xia Xue. I also see that she often comes to visit Gao Lin. Looks like Gao Lin will rely on Senior Xia Xue to reach the peak of her life in the future!”

“Oh my god, I’m so envious of Gao Lin. If only I were her!”

“Gao Lin, when you get rich in the future, don’t forget that we’re all classmates!”

…

Chen Xue stood at the side. Seeing that her classmates were all praising Gao Lin, she fell into deep thought. She felt that her classmates’ flattery was too poor.

Chen Xue hurriedly walked over, took Gao Lin’s arm, and started her advanced bootlicking strategy. She said, “Gao Lin, we’re the closest. Just now, we were discussing how to teach Ye Ran a lesson! We’re both so close. Can you think of a way to let me listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert? Then, I’ll be able to witness your performance with Senior Xia Xue at the concert!”

Gao Linlin had always liked to be flattered by others. When she heard Chen Xue’s words, the corners of her mouth curved up slightly. She nodded and said, “I’m afraid this will be a little difficult. Not just anyone can enter Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. The only reason I’m able to enter this time is because Senior Xia Xue has become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. But believe me, when I get familiar with all the members of Mr. Dong Hua’s orchestra, it will definitely be easy for me to bring you in!”

When Chen Xue heard Gao Lin’s words, her eyes lit up. She nodded excitedly. “Alright, alright. Gao Lin, you’re truly my best sister. I’ll go whenever you want, as long as you don’t forget me!”

When the others heard that Gao Lin would bring Chen Xue in, they all stepped forward excitedly to flatter Gao Lin, hoping that she would agree to bring them in immediately.

At this moment, Gao Lin felt the treatment of a queen.

She seemed to understand now why many people liked to be flattered. It turned out that being flattered was such an enjoyable thing. No wonder Ye Ran used Mr. Dong Hua’s fake tickets to cheat others.

Gao Lin smiled at the students around her. Her gaze finally landed on Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan, and her lips curved into a disdainful smile.

She felt that Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan were like rats that everyone wanted to beat up. They hid at the side, not daring to meet anyone.

Qiao Nian was teaching Wang Xuan how to compose music when her phone suddenly rang. Seeing that it was Grandma, she hurriedly picked up the call and placed the phone next to her ear.

“Grandma,” Qiao Nian said softly.

“Oh, my darling girl, Nian Nian!”

Gao Lin smiled and chimed in with her classmates. Her attention had been on Qiao Nian the entire time. Seeing that Qiao Nian was on the phone, she hurriedly pricked up her ears to eavesdrop.

Matriarch Gu’s happy voice came through the phone. “Nian Nian, are you busy? Are you free to go home for lunch?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. This was the first time Grandma had called her to ask her to come home for lunch. It seemed that something had happened at home. She asked tentatively, “Grandma, is there anything special?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The smile on Matriarch Gu’s face grew brighter. She said mysteriously, “There’s an important guest at home today. I wanted to invite you back for lunch. I think you’ll want to see him very much.”

Qiao Nian asked curiously, “Who is it?”

“There won’t be any surprises if I tell you. You’ll know when you come back!”

Qiao Nian glanced at Wang Xuan, who was sitting next to her. After some thought, she said, “Grandma, I’ve already discussed something with my friend. I’ll be teaching her at noon today. I don’t want to go back on my word, so I wanted to ask if you could bring her home for lunch. It’ll be easier for us to study together.”

“Okay, okay. Of course. I haven’t met your friend yet. Grandma would like to meet your friend too.”

“Thank you, Grandma. Then we’ll get ready to go home now.”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gao Lin could vaguely guess that Qiao Nian was planning to go home for lunch. Thinking that it wasn’t anything important, she couldn’t be bothered to ask.

After all, Qiao Nian was just a spectator at Mr. Dong Hua’s concert, and her Sister Xia Xue was the main character. At the thought of this, Gao Lin’s mood instantly improved.

However, Gao Lin didn’t expect Wang Xuan to still be standing with Qiao Nian.

Gao Lin looked at Wang Xuan and asked benevolently, “Wang Xuan, I’ll give you a chance now. As long as you distance yourself from Qiao Nian, I’ll think of a way to bring you along for the performance. What do you think?”
