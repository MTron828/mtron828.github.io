795 Too Cute

Xiao Shi looked at Qiao Nian happily and nodded vigorously.

Holding Xiao Shi’s hand, Qiao Nian walked towards the living room. She smiled at Matriarch Gu. “Grandma!”

Matriarch Gu stood up and said, “Breakfast is ready. Come and eat with us!”

During the meal, Qiao Nian prepared a sandwich for Xiao Shi before eating it herself.

Xiao Shi looked at the sandwich on the plate in front of her, her eyes filled with envy.

It seemed that Auntie Nian Nian had been taking care of Brother Xiao Qi during dinner. She was really envious of Brother Xiao Qi and liked Auntie Nian Nian even more.

Auntie Nian Nian was kind, beautiful, and knew how to take care of others. When she was by Auntie Nian Nian’s side, she felt very safe.

This was a sense of security her mother had never given her.

Qiao Nian was about to eat when she saw Xiao Qi staring at the sandwich in a daze. She smiled and said softly, “What’s wrong, Xiao Qi? Don’t you like it?”

Xiao Zheng shook his head and said with a smile, “I like it!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’ll send you to school after you eat.” Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Shi and said gently.

Xiao Shi smiled when she thought about how she was about to meet Brother Xiao Qi.

After dinner, Qiao Nian held Xiao Shi’s hand and walked towards the parking lot.

When they reached the parking lot, Qiao Nian opened the door of the front passenger seat and carried Xiao Shi in, not forgetting to fasten her seatbelt.

When she was done, Qiao Nian walked to the driver’s seat.

She fastened her seatbelt, twisted the car key, and drove out of the Gu residence.

When they left the Gu residence, Xiao Shi looked disappointed. Smiling, Qiao Nian said, “Do you want to hear good news?”

Xiao Shi’s eyes lit up. She tilted her head and looked at Qiao Nian, asking in confusion, “What good news?”

“Your mommy will be here at noon today! You’ll be able to see her soon!” Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi dotingly for a year.

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes lit up. She said happily, “Really?”

“Of course it’s true!” Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

As Xiao Shi listened, her face was filled with smiles.

If Mommy came here, she would definitely be very happy to see her brother. That way, their family could be reunited.

It had been a long time since she had seen her mommy smile.

Her mother must have been sad because she had not seen her brother.

Her mommy could be happy forever.

In her happiness, her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

This was the first time she had seen someone as warm as Auntie Nian Nian.

Xiao Shi said sincerely, “Auntie Nian Nian, thank you for taking care of me for the past two days. This is also the happiest time for me!”

The red light turned red. Qiao Nian stopped the car and rubbed Xiao Shi’s head. She said gently, “You’ll be happier in the future!”

To be honest, such a good life would have been unimaginable in the past.

She really liked Auntie Nian Nian and wanted to be with her forever.

However, Xiao Shi knew in her heart that she still had to take care of her mommy. Her mommy needed her to take care of her.

The car started again.

Xiao Shi looked at the scenery outside the window and kept retreating. The faces of Matriarch Gu, Gu Zhou, and Gu Qi flashed across her mind. In the end, her eyes gradually became firm.

She wanted to persuade her mommy not to think about being with her daddy again.

She just didn’t know if Mommy was willing.

Although Xiao Shi was very happy to see her mommy, she couldn’t help but sigh when she thought of what would happen next.

When they arrived at the Dongjiang villa, Qiao Nian dropped Xiao Shi off at the villa. When she met her sparkling eyes, Qiao Nian’s heart softened involuntarily.

“Xiao Shi, hang out with Brother and Auntie Lin later. Auntie Nian Nian still has something on today, so she won’t be able to accompany you!” Xiao Shi nodded obediently.

At this moment, Lin Tao held Gu Qi’s hand and walked out of the villa.

When Qiao Nian and Xiao Shi saw Gu Qi, they were both stunned.

Her mouth was wide open. After a while, she sighed. “Oh my god, Brother, you’re really beautiful. You’re so cute!”
