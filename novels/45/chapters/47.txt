With that, Qiao Nian looked down at Zheng He, who was by her feet, and asked coldly, “Do you want to apologize? Or do you want me to break every single one of your bones?”

Qiao Nian’s voice was as gentle as ever, but the words she spoke made one feel as if they were in the dead of winter, chilling to the bone. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zheng He looked at Qiao Nian in fear. The Zheng family had never apologized, and would never do so.

“In your dreams! Pft! I’m telling you, I’m definitely getting my family’s mercenaries to kill you!” Zheng He said viciously, his face livid.

If Zheng He had not been crying, Qiao Nian would have thought that he was still a man. But Zheng He was bawling like a baby in front of her. It was truly disgusting.

“Mercenaries?” Qiao Nian looked at Zheng He with a faint smile on her face. “Do you think I’m afraid of you?”

The onlookers had thought that Qiao Nian would quit while she was ahead. They didn’t expect Qiao Nian to continue provoking Zheng He.

Although the spectacle today was satisfying, they couldn’t help but worry about Qiao Nian.

The Zheng family’s mercenaries carried firearms.

No matter how skilled Qiao Nian was, how could she dodge a bullet?

“Alright, then do you dare to wait here until my father arrives?” Zheng He wiped the tears off his face and said, sniffling.

“Why wouldn’t I dare to?” Qiao Nian sneered. She really looked down on Zheng He. Apart from calling for reinforcements, this good-for-nothing had no other abilities. “If your father can’t beat me, will you call your grandfather over?”

The people around them couldn’t stop smiling. They felt that Qiao Nian had a very good point.

Zheng He and Zheng Xiang looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. They had never seen such an arrogant and despotic woman in their lives.

Zheng He took out his phone from his pocket shakily. Just as he was about to make a call, he heard a cold voice from afar.

“Are you done fighting?” Gu Zhou stepped past the crowd and walked elegantly towards Qiao Nian.

His gaze toward Qiao Nian was very gentle, so gentle that it wouldn’t be surprising if water was flowing from his eyes.

Qiao Nian turned to glance at Gu Zhou. Her red lips curved up slightly. “Not bad. I just started warming up.”

“They’re quite dirty. Don’t dirty your hands,” Gu Zhou said gently to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin, who was standing not far away, looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. She had not expected this cold man to be so gentle with Qiao Nian.

Everyone around them was also stunned. The Second Young Master Gu was rumored to be as cold as ice. The word “gentle” simply wasn’t in his dictionary.

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She seemed to agree with Gu Zhou.

When Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian stood side by side, they looked like the male and female leads in a manga. The man was handsome and suave, while the lady was petite and exquisite.

Gu Zhou gave Zheng He a disdainful glance, as if taking another look would cause his eyes to sting. His voice was as cold and low as ever. “Mr. Zheng, I have a debt to settle with you.”

Zheng He’s knees were aching terribly. He could only stand up after the people around him helped him up.

However, no one understood why Gu Zhou would say that. The Gu and Zheng families were arch-enemies, and the two families had never had any business dealings with each other.

Zheng He had long since sobered up. He looked up at Gu Zhou, then at Qiao Nian, who was standing beside Gu Zhou. His face was pale.

Oh my god, he had angered Gu Zhou’s woman!

Zheng He still remembered what his father had told him. As long as he didn’t offend the Gu family, he could do whatever he wanted.

“Chen Qing.”

Chen Qing, who had been standing in the crowd, walked over.

“Chop off one of his hands!” Gu Zhou said expressionlessly.

Gu Zhou’s words stunned everyone around him. They looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. At this moment, they realized that Qiao Nian was someone they couldn’t afford to offend.

Because Qiao Nian was under Gu Zhou’s protection.
