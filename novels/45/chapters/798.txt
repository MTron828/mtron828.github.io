At this point, Su Xue hardened her stance again. She stood up and looked at Qiao Nian coldly, saying angrily, “If it weren’t for me back then, you would have died long ago. How would you have had the chance to stand here?”

At this moment, Su Xue was standing on the moral high ground, criticizing Qiao Nian for all kinds of wrongdoings!

Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue coldly and pursed her lips. “Su Xue, you’d better tell me everything about bringing me back to the Qiao family now. Otherwise, I’ll go to the police station and say that you’re a child trafficker!”

Previously, she had no memories of Xiao Shi.

She had always thought that her warm and sweet dreams were just dreams, but she did not expect them to really happen.

However, she now knew clearly that she had left the Lu family when she was three years old. However, Su Xue had lied to her, saying that she had arrived at the Qiao family home as soon as she was born. This clearly didn’t match.

Su Xue, who was sitting on the sofa, turned paler and paler. Suppressing the uneasiness in her heart, she said firmly, “I can swear to God that I didn’t kidnap you! Moreover, you don’t have any evidence to prove that I did!”

This time, Qiao Nian understood that everything Su Xue had said to her at the hotel was a lie.

It seemed that it was impossible to deal with Su Xue without using some powerful medicine.

“You really won’t shed a tear until you see the coffin!” Qiao Nian smiled coldly.

Su Xue’s expression changed. She recalled what Qiao Nian had said previously. Previously, Qiao Nian had said that she would definitely send Qiao Shan to prison. In the end, Qiao Shan stayed in prison for a long time before coming out.

The current Qiao Nian was no longer the Qiao Nian of the past.

Qiao Nian was very vengeful and kept her word.

Moreover, Gu Zhou was helping Qiao Nian.

She really didn’t understand why Gu Zhou would take a liking to a little b*tch like Qiao Nian!

Qiao Shan had been locked up in prison previously. That was why Qiao Shan hated her so much and was unwilling to be with her.

Last night, she was the one who secretly drugged Qiao Shan. The two of them were together again.

Today happened to be her thirty-year anniversary with Qiao Shan. Originally, Qiao Shan had been unwilling to let her come back.

During this period of time, she had been begging and trying to please Qiao Shan. That was why Qiao Shan was willing to let her spend the night with the Qiao family.

She still wanted to take advantage of tonight to bury the hatchet with Qiao Shan and get back together.

But she had never expected Qiao Nian to come again.

She was simply a lingering ghost.

She could tell that Qiao Nian had ill intentions this time.

If she allowed Qiao Nian to stay here, she was afraid that she and Qiao Shan would fall out again. Her return to the Qiao family might be far away.

Su Xue felt that she had to bite the bullet. Anyway, it was impossible for Qiao Nian to find out about what happened when she was an infant.

“You’re the illegitimate child of a rich businessman who was left behind by a rural woman. I’m not lying to you. If you don’t believe me, investigate it yourself!” Su Xue paused and said seriously, “You have to investigate carefully. What are the intentions of the people who lied to you previously?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Su Xue was best at diverting trouble.

Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue expressionlessly, mercilessly exposing Su Xue’s lie. “I remember when I was two years old, so I’m completely sure that I wasn’t abandoned when I was a baby.”

Su Xue almost choked on her own saliva.

She looked at Qiao Nian in shock.

What was going on?

Qiao Nian could actually remember what happened when she was two years old.

How was that possible?

Could it be that Qiao Nian was tricking her on purpose to make her tell the truth?

It was basically impossible for ordinary people to remember what happened when they were two years old.

But Qiao Nian was not an ordinary person at all.

For a moment, Su Xue didn’t know what to say. She sat on the sofa in silence, her frown deepening.

Qiao Nian walked to the sofa of the three of them and sat down. She said lightly, “I know you’re getting old and your memory isn’t good. You might not be able to remember the past, but I have plenty of time. When Qiao Shan returns, I’ll ask him again. Perhaps he’ll be able to remember the past.”

Seeing Su Xue looking at her in fear, Qiao Nian smiled and continued, “By the way, I’ll tell him that your gigolo is still thinking about you. A day apart feels like three years. He misses you so much that he’s lost weight. He even said that he had to marry you and spend the rest of his life with you. He even planned to have two more children with you, a son and a daughter…”
