“Miss Su, I heard that you’re the head designer. No wonder you give off a simply outstanding aura.”

“Miss Su, you seem to be quite eligible, just barely worthy of me. I won’t ask much of you. I just want you to stay at home after we get married to take care of your husband and children.”

“Miss Su, after we get married, I’ll be in charge of the external affairs, while you’ll be in charge of the internal affairs. I’m not young anymore, and I need to have a child soon. If possible, we’ll go for a fertility examination soon.”

“Miss Su, before we get married, our assets have to be fairly divided. Whats

yours is mine, and what’s mine is still mine.

Qjao Nian frowned. She thought to herself that if Su Xiao had come, she would

have slapped this man long ago.

She sat up straight and smiled at the man. Seeing that the man was stunned,

she pursed her lips.

Just then, the service staff arrived with two steaks.

Qjao Nian smiled at the service staff and said in fluent English, “Hello, can I

have a cup of warm water? I would also like a pair of chopsticks.”

Li Yuan, who was sitting directly across from Qjao Nian, had never expected

her to be so unsophisticated.

Wasn’t she the head designer? How could she not know that one had to use a

knife and fork to eat steak?

Didn’t she know that one didn’t ask for warm water in Western restaurants?

Didn’t she know that the employees of this Western restaurant were all from

Country M?

Li Yuan did not want to be looked down upon by the service staff. He quickly

said in English, “Im sorry, she doesn’t need chopsticks or wam water. She

wants a glass of ice water.”

Seeing that the service staff was about to leave, Qjao Nian repeated her request.

The service staff nodded and left.

After the service staff left, Li Yuan could no longer stand it. He turned to Qjao

Nian coldly and said, “Miss Su, you have to use a knife and fork to eat steak,

not chopsticks!

“Also, there’s only ice water here, not warm water,” Li Yuan said fimly.

Qjao Nian threw her fork and knife onto the table, instantly attracting

everyone’s attention, including Zhao Qian and Li Kun.

Only then did Li Kun realize that the man was actually his third uncle.

Li Yuan sensed that other people were now staring at him. When he thought

about how he had been embarrassed by the woman in front of him, he

slammed the table in a rage and stood up. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You look like a decent human being, but I didn’t expect you to be so stubbornly

old-fashioned!” The more Li Yuan thought about it, the angrier he became.

“When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Don’t you understand? Were in a

Western restaurant, so we have to follow the rules of Western cuisine.”

“All I know is that we should do whatever is comfortable. Why can’t we use

chopsticks hen we’re eating steak?” Qjao Nian sat there calmly, looking

fearlessly at Li Yuan. “Everyone values cultural integration. Why are you the

exception?

Li Yuan was at a loss for words. She was right. Everyone valued cultural

integration these days.

Qjao Nian continued, “You want me to be a full-time stay-at-home wife, and

you want all my money to belong to you. Where in the world can you find such

a good nanny for free? Oh right, if you manage to find one, do recommend one

to me. I need a nanny to make money for me!”

Li Yuan was so angry that his face turned green. He raised his hand, preparing

to hit Qjao Nian, but someone grabbed his hand in midair.

Li Yuan turned his head and saw that it was Li Kun. His expression turned ugly.

He said furiously, “Let go of me!”

His nephew had seen him on a blind date. How embarrassing!

“Third Uncle, remember that you’re a gentleman,” Li Kun said resignedly.

There’s no need for grace. Let go of me!” Lee Yuan was livid. “Im going to beat

this b*tch to death!”

Qjao Nian looked at Li Yuan’s face, full of rage and humiliation, and frowned.

“Is the middleman of this blind date a human or a dog? How could he make me

go on a blind date with a beast?”

Li Yuan’s expression darkened further. It was now so dark that one could

practically see ink dripping off his face.

“Let go of me! Im going to beat this b*tch to death!” Li Yuan had never been

insulted like this in his life, and he was livid.

Hearing Li Yuan’s words, Qjao Nian gave a faint smile and continued, “The only

words that come out of your mouth are swear words. If you’re not a beast, then

what else could you be?”
