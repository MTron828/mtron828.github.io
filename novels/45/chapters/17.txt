Chapter 18: Marriage Contract

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the more she felt that he was a pervert. Humiliated tears welled up in her eyes and she glared daggers at Gu Zhou, unblinking.

Gu Zhou, meanwhile, was laser-focused on what was happening outside the room.

“Madam, maybe we should leave!”

Judging from the voice, it was Butler Zhao who had spoken.

“Stop that nonsense. Let me listen carefully. Has the deed been done?”

This voice belonged to Matriarch Gu.

Slowly, Qiao Nian began to stop struggling. So Gu Zhou was putting on an act. She looked at Gu Zhou carefully and saw that his eyes were clear and emotionless. She realized that she had been over-thinking.

After a while, Qiao Nian heard the sound of footsteps leaving. When Gu Zhou removed his hand from her mouth, she let out a sigh of relief.

Gu Zhou tugged at his tie and glanced at Qiao Nian coldly, asking, “Did you tell tales?”

The man’s hoarse voice held a trace of sexiness. There was a hint of ridicule in his words, and it was hard to tell if he was questioning or mocking her.

Qiao Nian gave Gu Zhou an expressionless glance-over. She said casually, “I’m not so free. If you don’t have any evidence, don’t spout nonsense.”

With that, Qiao Nian picked up her book and walked towards the door.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou’s brow furrowed slightly. He said, “Sleep here tonight.”

Qiao Nian stood dumbfounded for a moment. She recalled the servant saying that Gu Zhou didn’t like other people entering his room. Could it be that Gu Zhou was planning to sleep somewhere else himself?

Qiao Nian thought she understood. She was about to get into bed when she saw Gu Zhou walking over.

“Second Young Master, if nothing else is the matter, you should rest early!” Qiao Nian said as she glanced toward the door. It was obvious that she was inviting him to leave.

Gu Zhou calmly loosened his tie and lowered his gaze. Qiao Nian couldn’t see the look in his eyes, but she could sense his displeasure.

Glancing at the bed, Qiao Nian instantly understood. Gu Zhou must have wanted to sleep in his own bed. She said, “Why don’t I get the servants to move your bed to another room?”

Before Gu Zhou could reply, Qiao Nian added, “I haven’t touched your bed, so you don’t have to worry!”

Gu Zhou was silent for a moment, his eyes darkening. The expression on his face was intriguing. After a bit, he said, “There’s nothing to worry about.”

In other words, he didn’t mind if she touched his bed.

Qiao Nian was stunned for a brief moment before she came back to her senses. It was true that they appeared in this room at the same time. Gu Zhou must had seen that she didn’t touch the bed. She spoke, “Oh, that’s right, you were the one who brought me here. Alright, I’ll get someone to move the bed out and bring a new bed in!”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she walked towards the door, preparing to call for the servants.

“Do you want Grandma to know that we’re sleeping in separate rooms?” Sitting by the bed, Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian calmly.

Qiao Nian’s steps came to a halt. She turned back to look at Gu Zhou. Ignoring the impassiveness in his eyes, she continued speaking. “You don’t like me, do you? My departure should suit you just fine.”

After a pause, Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou with a strange expression. Thinking about how Gu Zhou had pretended to consummate their marriage just now, she asked, “Why did you let Grandmother misunderstand what we were doing in the room?”

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes slightly, his expression indecipherable. He stood up and stepped towards Qiao Nian, looking down at her with a commanding air. “Can you cure my illness?”

Qiao Nian looked up, her long hair falling naturally onto her shoulders. She looked at the man in front of her and said, “I’m only 70% certain.”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian finally understood what Gu Zhou meant. Her eyes lit up, and she gave a sly smile. “Second Young Master, let’s sign a contract!”

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly, looking at Qiao Nian in confusion.

Qiao Nian quickly walked to the side and took out the contract that she had prepared beforehand. She handed it to Gu Zhou and said, “We’ll have a marriage by contract. For one year.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, his expression unpleasant. In spite of himself, his hands clenched into fists. He stared at Qiao Nian coldly and did not speak for a long time.

“For this one year, we won’t interfere with each other’s private lives, and I’ll treat your illness. After a year, we’ll get a divorce and let each other go.” Qiao Nian spoke slowly, a bright smile in her eyes.

Gu Zhou looked straight into Qiao Nian’s eyes. The sparkle in those eyes irritated him.

Qiao Nian held the contract in one hand and a pen in the other. She handed both items to Gu Zhou. “Sign it!”

Upon hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou took the contract from her, taking his time. With a calm expression, he ripped the contract in half, then tossed both pieces of paper away with an arrogant air.

The two halves of the contract fell to the ground gently, almost like snowflakes.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. She frowned slightly, puzzled. “What do you mean by this?”

Qiao Nian continued to stare at Gu Zhou enquiringly.. She didn’t understand what kind of tantrum Gu Zhou was throwing. Why did he tear up the contract? Shouldn’t he have signed the contract without hesitation?
