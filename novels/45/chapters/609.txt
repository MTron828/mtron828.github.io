Chapter 610: Aggrieved

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The man’s eyes gradually cleared. There was still blood on her lips.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, the man stuck out his tongue and licked the blood off his lips. He looked at Qiao Nian with an invasive gaze.

Was he a pervert?

Who in their right mind would drink blood?

Qiao Nian met the man’s eyes. His gaze was complicated. It was stubborn, domineering, and filled with pain and reluctance.

Strange. He had clearly done something bad to her. Why was he pretending to be aggrieved? What was there to be sad about?

Could it be that the two of them had really been together in the past?

Had she forgotten about him?

How was this possible?

Although she knew that this was impossible, she couldn’t help but feel sad for him. She looked up at him and asked softly, “What have I forgotten?”

As soon as she finished speaking, the man’s weak eyes closed and he fell onto her.

“Ahem.”

Qiao Nian almost couldn’t breathe. For some reason, her heart felt empty.

“Gu Chuan?” Qiao Nian looked at the sleeping man, whose breathing was steady. He seemed to be completely asleep.

It seemed that he had fallen asleep.

Qiao Nian’s gaze inadvertently fell on his thin lips. When she thought of how he had kissed her just now, the blood in her entire body began to heat up involuntarily. The numbing pleasure spread from her tailbone to her brain. Fascinated, she approached his lips.

Just as their lips were about to touch, Qiao Nian suddenly came back to her senses. She was still thinking about that kiss.

She looked at Gu Zhou worriedly. Gu Zhou’s condition was already very serious. She could not delay any longer.

With great effort, Qiao Nian pushed him away from her. Usually, Gu Zhou looked thin and weak, but he wasn’t light at all.

After much effort, she finally managed to move Gu Zhou away from her. Pulling the blanket over, she covered him with it.

It seemed that Gu Chuan’s obsession was that she had not remembered him. Perhaps if she started with his obsession, it would be easy to cure his personality.

If there was a chance, he could ask Gu Qing to hypnotize Gu Zhou and see if he could find any clues from his memories.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Thinking that she still had to get Su Sheng to treat Gu Qi’s illness, she turned around and walked out.

She had just taken a step when she vaguely heard the man talking in his dream.

“Nian’er…”

Qiao Nian stopped in her tracks. Something strange seemed to be brewing in her heart. She turned her head and saw the man frowning, as if he was looking for her in his dream.

Pursing her lips, Qiao Nian sighed softly and walked out.

After she left, she gently closed the door, as if she was afraid of waking him up.

She went downstairs to the living room on the first floor before calling Chen Qing.

“Doctor Qiao.”

Chen Qing’s voice came through the phone.

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s greeting, her lips curved up in a satisfied smile. She asked, “Where are you and Doctor Su now?”

“We’re in the garden now.”

Qiao Nian said, “Alright, I’m already out. Come to the living room.”

Less than five minutes after hanging up, Chen Qing walked in with Su Sheng.

Smiling, Qiao Nian walked up to welcome him. “I’m really sorry, Doctor Su. I’ve kept you waiting. I hope you don’t mind.”

When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou’s cold eyes flashed before her eyes. Thinking about it now, she broke out in a cold sweat.

That man was truly terrifying.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t said anything back then, she would have run away in fear.

Chen Qing recalled Gu Zhou back then and looked at Second Young Madam worriedly. He was worried that Second Young Master would attack Second Young Madam, but when he saw that Second Young Madam’s lips were cut, he was slightly stunned.

This…

This…

Second Young Master and Second Young Madam had kissed?

No, Second Young Master had bitten Second Young Madam’s lip?

Chen Qing was a little confused. He looked at Second Young Madam in confusion. Could this be Second Young Master’s punishment?

Why was his punishment so strange?

No, no, no. What was he thinking?

Couldn’t Second Young Master punish him by praising Second Young Madam a little more?

Chen Qing thought pitifully.
