Although Gu Zhou’s car hadn’t left, it didn’t follow her. Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She couldn’t be bothered to think about Gu Zhou anymore. She walked towards the elevator.

Ding dong.

The elevator chimed and the door opened.

When the door opened, Qiao Nian saw that Su Sheng’s long pink hair was draped over her shoulders. She was wearing a white dress, and looked extremely gentle and beautiful.

“Miss Qiao.” Su Sheng greeted Qiao Nian with a smile. She didn’t expect to see Qiao Nian here.

“Miss Su, what a coincidence.” Qiao Nian stepped into the elevator.

Su Sheng looked at Qiao Nian’s meticulously dressed appearance and thought of Little Qi, who didn’t want to talk or meet outsiders. She thought that Qiao Nian knew that her senior sister had returned and wanted to ask her about Little Qi. She smiled and said, “My senior sister is in the office. I’ll take you there!”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Sheng’s words, she shook her head gently and said, “No.”

Actually, Qiao Nian kept a low profile. She was here to see Mr. Dong Hua, and Su Sheng was also a fan of Mr. Dong Hua. If Su Sheng knew that Mr. Dong Hua was here and that she was here to see Mr. Dong Hua today, she might think that she was showing off.

Qiao Nian had a good impression of Su Sheng, so she didn’t want to cause unnecessary trouble.

Su Sheng was slightly stunned. Then, she smiled and nodded. There were many companies in the entire Yongan Building. Perhaps Qiao Nian was here to look for someone else.

Su Sheng thought of Gu Qi’s situation and said with a smile, “Miss Qiao, my senior sister has just returned today. If you’re worried about Little Qi’s health, why don’t you ask her to take a look at him again? After we confirm Little Qi’s condition, we can treat his illness. By then, Little Qi will recover faster.”

Su Sheng’s eyes darted around. Back at the Gu residence, Qiao Nian didn’t seem to believe her judgment. Now, she was very curious about what Qiao Nian was thinking.

“Thank you, I understand.” With that, Qiao Nian recalled how Gu Qing had said with certainty that Gu Qi wasn’t sick. She asked curiously, “Miss Su, did you tell Doctor Gu about Little Qi’s condition?”

“Yes, I did.” Su Sheng looked to the lower right corner.

Qiao Nian asked curiously, “What did Doctor Gu say?”

Su Sheng said, “My senior sister said that she felt that her judgment in the past might not be accurate. She planned to take a look in person before coming to a conclusion!”

Hearing Su Sheng’s words, Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. A trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. “Doctor Gu also thinks that Little Qi has autism?”

Su Sheng hurriedly comforted her. “Miss Qiao, don’t be anxious. My senior sister just said that she was observing.”

Qiao Nian smiled gently, then looked to the side and fell silent.

She felt that Doctor Gu Qing wouldn’t say that she was observing. According to her interactions with Doctor Gu Qing, Doctor Gu Qing definitely wouldn’t say that Gu Qi had autism.

When she explained Gu Qi’s situation to Doctor Gu Qing, Doctor Gu Qing was immediately certain that Gu Qi was just looking for attention.

Why did Su Sheng say that?

Qiao Nian quickly understood. Perhaps Su Sheng was afraid that she would be embarrassed if she made a mistake, so she said that!

Previously, she had a good impression of Su Sheng, because she was a sweet and adorable girl. Moreover, she had a lively personality. No matter how one looked at her, she was outstanding.

No one would dislike such an outstanding, adorable, and approachable child.

However, Qiao Nian felt a little uncomfortable now. Her good impression of her instantly disappeared.

She didn’t know why this was happening.

Su Sheng gave her the feeling that she liked to control everything.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Was she mistaken?

Seeing that Qiao Nian had her head lowered, Su Sheng asked curiously, “Miss Qiao, which floor are you going to?”

Qiao Nian glanced at the numbers on the elevator and smiled. “I’ll go to the first floor with you.”

The smile on Su Sheng’s face instantly froze. She looked at Qiao Nian suspiciously and said with a fake smile, “What a coincidence.”

“Hm.”

Su Sheng’s eyes darted around. Smiling, she moved closer to Qiao Nian and said, “Miss Qiao, I remember this floor is for music.”

A trace of confusion flashed across Qiao Nian’s face.

Su Sheng continued, “There are many music studios on this floor. Is Miss Qiao also interested in music?”
