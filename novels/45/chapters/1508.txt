1509 Killing Intent

A trace of killing intent flashed in Annie’s eyes. As long as there was a chance, she would definitely kill Qiao Nian.

Annie walked towards them in her twelve-centimeter high heels. She was wearing a tight dress today. When she walked, she swayed and looked very charming.

When the president saw Annie coming over, his expression darkened. Suppressing his displeasure, he said, “Annie, as a princess, why are you making a scene outside? Do you think this is a garden that you can enter and leave as you please?”

Annie tucked her hair behind her ear and looked at the president charmingly. Smiling, she said, “Uncle, we’re family. I was worried that you would be deceived, so I risked everything to barge in. I was just being kind.”

With that, Annie’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She raised her eyebrows slightly and said with interest, “You said that you know how to cultivate Falling Autumn Grass. I’m here today to see the Falling Autumn Grass you cultivated.”

Annie’s eyes were filled with smugness as she said lightly, “Or are you just lying to my kind and innocent uncle!”

The smile on Annie’s face grew even more pronounced. She licked her lips slightly and looked at the president as if she was watching a show.

The president’s expression darkened. He pressed his eyes and pursed his lips into a straight line.

Annie’s gaze inadvertently swept over the flower pot in Lina’s hand. When he saw the seedlings emerging from the pot, she burst out laughing.

“Uncle, how can you be so naive? How can anyone lie to you? You’re too easy to fool.” Annie pointed at the flower pot in Lina’s hand and mocked loudly, “Is this Falling Autumn Grass? This is too funny!”

The president looked at Annie with a sinister expression. He was so angry that his temples were throbbing. He wanted to kill her.

Qiao Nian walked over to Lina and took the flower pot from her. Then, she walked up to Annie. Her gaze was calm as she asked unhurriedly, “Princess Annie, isn’t this Falling Autumn Grass?”

When Annie heard Qiao Nian’s words, she raised her eyebrows slightly. Only then did she look at the flower pot in Qiao Nian’s hand.

When she saw the seedling in the flower pot clearly, she was slightly stunned. Her pupils dilated uncontrollably.

The person who cultivated the Falling Autumn Grass lived in the castle. She often went to the garden to look at it.

Just now, she was a little far away, so she couldn’t see clearly what Lina’s seedling looked like. When Qiao Nian brought it closer, she realized that it was really Falling Autumn Grass.

Annie looked at Qiao Nian in shock. Just as she was about to ask, she suddenly thought of something and her expression turned indifferent.

Annie chuckled and said frivolously, “Alright, let’s say this is Falling Autumn Grass. Go and try it and see how my aunt will react after using it.”

Annie was clearly mocking Qiao Nian, but it also proved one thing.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. Falling Autumn Grass couldn’t stabilize Madam President’s condition at all. In other words, there was something else that had stabilized Madam President’s condition during this period of time. Falling Autumn Grass was just a cover.

The president frowned slightly. Only then did he realize how stupid he had been to be played by his brother.

The president calmed down and recalled what had just happened carefully.

Whether it was him, Lina, or Qiao Nian, none of them had any strange reactions when they saw the Falling Autumn Grass. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Why did Madam have such a strong reaction when she saw the Falling Autumn Grass?

From Annie’s reaction just now, Qiao Nian had indeed cultivated Falling Autumn Grass. Logically speaking, if the Falling Autumn Grass didn’t work, Madam shouldn’t have resisted.

The President’s frown deepened. He couldn’t understand what had gone wrong.
