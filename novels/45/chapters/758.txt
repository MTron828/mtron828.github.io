759 I Only Want Xiao Shi

“Okay!” Xiao Shi did not think too much about it and hurriedly nodded.

In her childhood, her father would definitely miss her and Mommy at night.

The two little ones walked side by side towards the roadside. Xiao Shi’s gaze landed on Gu Qi’s right hand.

She recalled that Brother Da Hai from next door often held his sister’s hand. At that time, she was especially envious of Bell.

She also wanted to walk hand in hand with her brother.

Xiao Shi tilted her head to look at her brother and asked, “Brother Xiao Qi, can you hold my hand and walk with me?”

Gu Qi’s heart couldn’t help but race. He smiled brightly at Xiao Qi and looked down to see Xiao Qi’s hand reaching over. His ears were red as he held Xiao Qi’s hand.

He was very nervous, and his grip on Xiao Shi tightened involuntarily.

Xiao Qi kept her head lowered, her eyes filled with struggle. After a long time, she asked, “Brother Xiao Qi, do you want a younger brother or a younger sister?”

Without thinking, Gu Qi said, “I just want Xiao Shi.”

When she heard Gu Qi’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh.

Her brother was as gentle as Brother Da Hai. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She would also be as happy as him and have her brother’s love.

When they walked to the side of the road, Gu Qi raised his hand and hailed a car. When the car stopped in front of them, Gu Qi opened the door of the back seat and let Xiao Shi sit in first.

Xiao Shi obediently got into the car.

Only then did Gu Qi get in as well. Seeing that Xiao Shi had not fastened her seatbelt, he did not speak. He leaned over and helped Xiao Shi buckle her seatbelt.

Xiao Shi looked down at Gu Qi, as if he was seeing Brother Da Hai tying her shoes with bells again.

“Brother Xiao Qi, you’re the best!”

A smile flashed in Gu Qi’s eyes. After sitting up straight, he buckled his seatbelt and said to the driver, “Let’s go to Dongjiang now!”

Before he moved to the Gu family, he had been living in Dongjiang. After he moved away, that villa became empty. It was just right for Xiao Shi to stay there first.

His heart was in a mess. He didn’t know if his father was willing to accept Mommy.

In his opinion, Xiao Shi was his father’s child. His father couldn’t abandon Xiao Shi.

But Mommy…

However, Gu Qi quickly got over it.

His father seemed to like Auntie Nian Nian more now. His father had even said that he wanted to marry Auntie Nian Nian.

He felt that Auntie Nian Nian would definitely be able to live with Mommy.

Auntie Nian Nian was so good, and so was Mommy. There was no one better than them in this world.

When they arrived at Dongjiang, Gu Qi held Xiao Shi’s hand and walked towards the villa.

Gu Qi turned to look at Xiao Shi and said seriously, “Xiao Shi, I’ll introduce you to the best auntie in the world later!”

Xiao Shi tilted her head and looked at Gu Qi in confusion, as if she didn’t understand what Gu Qi meant.

“Dad isn’t in good health. He has a private doctor. I usually call her Auntie Nian Nian!” Gu Qi felt that there were some things that he had to let Xiao Shi know, and he had never thought of hiding it from her. “Dad used to be alone. Now, he’s close to Auntie Nian Nian.”

Although she was young, she had gone out to work previously and seen many people, so she understood things. She naturally understood what Brother Xiao Qi meant.

Xiao Shi hesitated for a long time before asking, “Then is Dad going to be with Auntie Nian Nian?”

Gu Qi nodded seriously.

Xiao Shi’s eyes instantly turned red. She didn’t know what to do.

Daddy was with someone else now. What about Mommy?

Previously, she had heard from her mommy that she had been schemed against, which was why she and her brother were born. Although that was the case, she could sense that her mommy liked her daddy a lot.

But Daddy didn’t seem to like Mommy.

Perhaps Daddy had already forgotten about Mommy.

When she was young, she often heard from others that once someone had a new lover, he would forget her old love.

Xiao Shi pursed her lips and tried hard to suppress the pain in her heart. “Brother Xiao Qi, I know that Daddy and Mommy have been separated for a long time, and that there’s an auntie who can take care of Daddy. I’m very grateful that auntie can take care of him!”

Gu Qi looked at her sad face and asked in confusion, “Why are you sad?”
