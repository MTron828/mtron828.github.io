1271 Her hand slipped!

Holding the phone with both hands, Gu Zhou looked at the image on the cell phone. He hesitated for a moment before controlling the hero on the cell phone to follow the others out.

He didn’t know what was going on either, but in a daze, he gave away his first life.

The screen dimmed a little. He looked at his little figure lying enchantingly on the ground and looked at Qiao Nian’s computer screen awkwardly.

Qiao Nian’s screen was filled with rows of red codes. Although he wasn’t a hacker, he more or less knew about codes.

The hero in Gu Zhou’s cell phone game had been resurrected again. Just as he was about to control the hero to leave, a series of question marks appeared on the left side of the screen.

Baby Xiao Bao: ??? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just as he was about to reply, he fell to the ground again.

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Xiao Bao sat cross-legged on the bed, his small head filled with questions.

Strange, had something happened to Mommy? Was she lying on the ground again?

Xiao Bao handed the phone to Chang Feng and asked in confusion, “Uncle Feng, look. Mommy is dead again. What’s going on?”

Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao’s phone. Seeing that Qiao Nian’s account was still in the midst of dying, he said casually, “Her hand might have slipped!”

With that, Chang Feng saw a message from the left side of the screen.

Shi Shi: Mommy, why are you dead again? Don’t you know how to play this hero?

At this moment, Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi’s innocent question on the phone and frowned. He instantly felt embarrassed.

After Qiao Nian finished typing the last line of code, she realized that Baby Xiao Bao’s account was logged in from a villa area in MY. She checked the ownership of the villa and realized that it was under Mr. Chen’s name.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou, who was working hard in the game. She said, “The login address of the game is in the villa area under Mr. Chen’s name. The firewall of this villa is very likely to have been created by Eldest Senior Brother. I’ll give it a try.”

She had grown up with Eldest Senior Brother and knew the password he used very well. She entered the first password directly. In an instant, the surveillance video of the entire villa appeared on her screen.

She searched for these videos and finally found Eldest Senior Brother in the second bedroom on the left on the second floor.

Eldest Senior Brother was not playing with his phone now. Instead, he looked down at the child beside him playing the game. That child had his head lowered as he played with his phone. From his size, he should be five or six years old.

Five or six years old?

Qiao Nian thought of the two children at home again. A crazy thought flashed across her mind.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She gasped and stared unblinkingly at the child, her eyes involuntarily turning red.

Instinctively, she approached the computer screen and gently placed her fingers on the child.

At this moment, the child in the surveillance cameras looked at Chang Feng happily, as if he was saying something.

“Ah Zhou.” Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at the child’s face. Her voice trembled as she said, “Come and take a look!”

Gu Zhou put down the game in his hand. He had already died six times, but he had yet to obtain an assist, let alone a head.

He walked up to Qiao Nian and looked at the child on the screen. His breathing hitched, and he couldn’t believe his eyes.

“Doesn’t he look a lot like you?” As Qiao Nian spoke, her eyes were still fixed on the child’s face. Her lips curved up slightly. “Do you think he’s our third child?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he hesitated for a long time before saying, “I think he looks more like Big Brother when he was young.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her expression faltered slightly. She looked at the child in surprise and said hesitantly, “Do you think this child belongs to Big Brother?”

“I don’t know.” Gu Zhou looked at the child and said solemnly, “We’ll only know about this after asking Big Brother.”

“I believe that he’s our child.” Qiao Nian grabbed Gu Zhou’s hand anxiously, her eyes a little red. She explained, “If he’s Big Brother’s child, then Eldest Senior Brother doesn’t have to lie to us. As long as Eldest Senior Brother says that he’s the son of a good friend, we’ll also take this child to play games with us. But in order to hide the existence of this child, Eldest Senior Brother told me that he was the one playing the game.”
