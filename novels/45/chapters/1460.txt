1461 Tell Me Slowly

He had no idea that there were so many mercenaries in his territory.

He walked towards the mercenaries step by step, exuding the pressure of a superior. When he reached the middle of the army, he stopped.

“Protect the President!” A bodyguard beside the President shouted.

The military immediately protected the president in the middle. They raised the guns in their hands and looked nervously at the exit of the hospital building.

Seeing this, the mercenaries immediately picked up their guns and aimed them at the army without any fear.

Gu Zhou walked out of the building. He was tall and had a lion-like kingly aura, causing fear in the hearts of the European army.

When the European army saw Gu Zhou, they instinctively picked up their guns and aimed them at him.

At this moment, the situation had already reached the point where swords were drawn.

Gu Zhou stopped when he reached the mercenary.

Under the sunlight, everyone could see his face clearly. His perfect facial features were as if they were the most perfect work of God. There were no flaws.

Gu Zhou raised his hand slightly, his obsidian-like eyes locked tightly on the European President’s face. With an indifferent expression, he gestured.

Seeing this, the mercenaries lowered their guns one by one.

The European President’s gaze was fixed on Gu Zhou’s face. If he wasn’t wrong, the person who had looked at him in the building just now was this young man in front of him.

The president narrowed his eyes and raised his hand slightly, signaling for the people around him to lower their weapons.

The president and Gu Zhou stood facing each other.

“Gu Zhou.” The president’s voice was thick, but also as cold as ice. “You’re really bold.”

Gu Zhou’s expression did not change. He slowly tidied his sleeves and said calmly, “Mr. President, why don’t we sit down and talk slowly?”

The president’s expression changed slightly. Panting heavily, he suppressed his anger and questioned, “Talk slowly? What else is there to say between you and me? Return my daughter to me!”

When the army heard the president’s words, they all gripped their guns tightly. They didn’t expect the man opposite them to be so bold as to challenge their president!

Gu Zhou ignored the president’s anger and said lightly, “Mr. President, your daughter is still here, so you have no choice but to agree to my suggestion, right?”

Gu Zhou’s tone was very calm, as if he was saying something very ordinary.

The President gritted his teeth in anger. He took the gun from the person beside him, opened the safety catch, and aimed it at Gu Zhou. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As long as he pulled the trigger, he could take Gu Zhou’s life!

The president gripped the gun so tightly that his knuckles turned white. However, after a long time, he did not pull the trigger. With a dark expression, he questioned, “How dare you threaten me?”

When Chen Qing heard the president’s words, his face suddenly turned pale. He swallowed nervously and silently gripped the pistol in his hand, preparing to attack at any moment.

Gu Zhou raised his hand slightly, signaling for the mercenaries to make way. He walked to the front of the mercenaries with a serious expression. “This is my sincerity.”

His voice was low, hoarse, and magnetic. His tone was calm, as if he wasn’t facing a gun.

Seeing Gu Zhou’s reckless actions, a trace of confusion flashed in the President’s eyes.

Although he had never officially met Gu Zhou, he had seen news about him in the past. Moreover, Gu Zhou was a member of the Gu family in An City.

The president lowered the gun in his hand and asked in confusion, “What do you mean now?”

Gu Zhou met the president’s eyes fearlessly. His thin lips parted slightly as he said, “I’ll be your hostage here. The Seventh Princess is in the hospital now, but I can’t hand her over to you now. She’ll return to you in ten hours.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as calm as ever, and his expression was calm, without a trace of fear.

Seeing Gu Zhou’s calm expression, the President’s lips curved up slightly.

Although he was afraid of An City, he cared a lot about the Gu family.

Gu Zhou would not dare to make a move easily just because he was the head of the Gu family. He had been wondering why the Gu family had kidnapped his daughter. Now, it seemed that there was more to the matter.
