837 Blame

“When did you meet Brother? How long have you lived here?” Gu Zhou continued to ask.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and lowered her gaze, remaining silent.

Song Man was extremely smug. From the corner of her eye, she glanced at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian’s head was lowered, she couldn’t see her expression.

She felt that Qiao Nian should be in a lot of pain and sadness now.

Previously, Qiao Nian had shamelessly occupied the position of Mrs. Gu. Qiao Nian probably couldn’t accept the fact that she had become an ordinary person now.

Song Man pretended to be innocent as she stood rooted to the ground.

Xiao Shi let go of Song Man’s hand. They said that her father would look at her gently, but when her father saw Auntie Nian Nian, he seemed to be very unhappy.

Was Daddy blaming Auntie Nian Nian?

Realizing this, Xiao Shi felt terrible. She hurriedly took a step forward and asked, “Daddy, are you angry with Auntie Nian Nian now?”

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi’s question, a trace of maliciousness flashed in her eyes.

She didn’t understand what was so good about Qiao Nian. Auntie Nian Nian had grown on her.

Xiao Shi asked uneasily, “Daddy, are you blaming Auntie Nian Nian for not telling you that Mommy and I are here too?”

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Xiao Shi. When he heard the word “Daddy” from Xiao Shi’s mouth, he was completely certain that the person who had pestered him to tutor his homework that night was Xiao Shi.

So Qiao Nian already knew, but she was hiding it from him.

Suppressing the emotions in his heart, Gu Zhou reached out and patted Xiao Shi’s head. His voice was as gentle as ever. “You can…”

As he spoke, Gu Zhou glanced at the woman standing beside Xiao Shi and looked away expressionlessly. When he looked at Xiao Shi again, his eyes were filled with gentleness. “Stay here with your mommy for now. Daddy has other things to do now. I’ll visit you later.”

Xiao Shi nodded.

Song Man couldn’t understand why Gu Zhou had looked away after just glancing at her.

Didn’t Gu Zhou have anything to ask?

Didn’t Gu Zhou want to know what kind of environment she and Xiao Shi lived in? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Song Man wanted to ask Gu Zhou to stay, but when she thought of how she had pretended not to know Gu Zhou previously in order to maintain her current persona, she could only suffer in silence.

Gu Zhou didn’t even look at Song Man. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian, who was standing not far away. His eyes were dark and his voice was hoarse. “Let’s go!”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Seeing that Gu Zhou had already gotten into the car, she retracted her gaze and looked at Xiao Shi.

At this moment, she was looking at her worriedly.

Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Shi, indicating that she didn’t have to worry about her. She walked towards Gu Zhou’s car, but stopped after taking two steps.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Xiao Shi’s face again. Then, she looked at Chen Qing and said, “Stay here and accompany Young Miss.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Chen Qing was overjoyed.

Just now, Second Young Master’s expression was very ugly. He didn’t need to think to know that Second Young Master and Young Madam might have an argument later. He didn’t want to participate in the war between the two of them.

“Okay, Young Madam.” Chen Qing hurriedly nodded.

When Song Man heard the words “Young Madam”, her expression changed slightly, but she quickly regained her composure.

Before long, Mrs. Gu would be her. She had to chase Qiao Nian out of the Gu family.

Song Man clenched her fists tightly.

Xiao Shi was still worried as she watched Qiao Nian leave. She frowned.

Qiao Nian realized that Gu Zhou was sitting in the driver’s seat, so she got into the front passenger seat.

Gu Zhou started the engine and drove away from the Dongjiang villa.

The weather in the early winter was very cold.

The car window opened a crack, and a bone-chilling wind blew in, causing Qiao Nian’s face to hurt.

Qiao Nian closed the window and frowned. She glanced at the car, which was already speeding up to 200 kilometers per hour. Even though she realized that Gu Zhou didn’t look well, she still said, “Slow down!”

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, she realized that not only did the car not stop, but he was driving even faster.
