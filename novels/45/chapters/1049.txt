1050 Despair

The incident with Qiao Xin just now was the last time in his life he could exercise his right as a man!

Allen looked at He Cheng’s despairing expression and quickly stepped forward, dislocating both of his arms!

He had never seen such a dirty man!

How dare he have designs on the eldest daughter of the Lu family!

He even wanted to kidnap the young lady of the Lu family!

This person was not worthy of being a man!

He Cheng lay on the ground, unable to move. He looked at the ceiling in despair.

Seeing He Cheng like this, Lu Jiang gestured for Allen to stop!

Lu Jiang walked towards He Cheng step by step, his footsteps as steady as ever!

When Lu Jiang reached He Cheng, he stopped.

He Cheng’s eyelids moved slightly, and his gaze fell on Lu Jiang’s face.

He had heard of Fourth Master’s name before!

Fourth Master was very skilled. He would take revenge!

However, he had never expected Fourth Master to be so sinister!

Lu Jiang looked down at He Cheng as if he was looking at trash. His voice was as cold as a demon from hell. “I’m not interested in what you and Qiao Xin are thinking at all. What you wanted to do just shows what you’re afraid of. Only by using such a method to deal with you will I feel relieved!”

Lu Jiang paused for a moment and continued, “Besides, if you didn’t have such thoughts, how could you have become a scapegoat? Moreover, I didn’t find those men in the Earth Temple. Didn’t you specially find them?”

“You have to pay it back sooner or later. I hope you can correct yourself in prison in this life and be a good person in your next life!”

When He Cheng heard Lu Jiang’s words, he trembled in fear and looked at Lu Jiang in disbelief.

Qiao Xin’s innocence had been ruined!

He had also lost the right to be a man!

Not only that, but Lu Jiang also knew that he was the one who had found the men in the Earth Temple!

He Cheng frowned and asked shakily, “How do you know this? You shouldn’t know about the Earth Temple!”

Lu Jiang said lightly, “I didn’t know at first, but when she went there, I found out about her plan! The two of you looked pretentious, but I didn’t expect you to be so despicable. How dare you attack my sister? Don’t blame me for being impolite!”

He Cheng looked at Lu Jiang in despair. It seemed that Lu Jiang knew everything. He pursed his lips tightly, thinking that the more he said, the more mistakes he would make!

Lu Jiang had already investigated everything. He had never thought of getting information out of He Cheng at all. He said with interest, “I just wanted to see what she wanted to do. I didn’t expect her to give me such a big surprise. She let everyone know about her filth without any effort. Moreover, I asked those people, and they told me everything in detail!”

He Cheng couldn’t help but shiver. He knew about Qiao Xin, but he hadn’t expected Lu Jiang to send someone to follow them.

It was over. All of this was over! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The older, the wiser!

Fourth Master was still Fourth Master after all. He could not compare!

He regretted it now!

If he hadn’t colluded with Qiao Xin back then, he wouldn’t have ended up like this today!

What made He Cheng the most indignant was that Lu Jiang had instructed him to do all of this, but Lu Jiang’s hands were clean. He had done all the dirty things, and in the end, he was the one who reaped the consequences!

He Cheng didn’t want to go to prison!

He admitted that he could not compare to Fourth Master!

He Cheng looked up at Lu Jiang and endured the pain. He said pitifully, “Fourth Master, I already know my mistake. You’ve already ruined me. I can’t be a man anymore. Then can you let me off?”

“I’m sorry, I’m afraid it won’t be as you wish!” Lu Jiang gave Ai Lun a look!

Allen grabbed He Cheng’s leg and walked towards the elevator.

The three of them had just come out of the basement when the police sirens outside the villa began to sound!

He Cheng looked at Lu Jiang in despair and questioned, “You… you’ve already called the police!”

“What else?” Lu Jiang asked.

He Cheng slowly closed his eyes. He had done everything wrong. Lu Jiang had done nothing, and he managed to throw him into prison!

He Cheng had heard from others in the past that the most despised people in prison were rapists!
