Chapter 1725 - 1725 Reunion (1)

Before she could finish speaking, she saw Wright looking at her coldly with the gun pointed at her.

Via’s heart jumped to her throat. She didn’t even dare to breathe.

Wright stretched his neck slightly and said with a cold smile, “You are the one who wronged me. I wouldn’t dare to point a gun at the Seventh Princess.”

Via pursed her lips, her pupils trembling with fear.

“I still know my limits. I’m just aiming the gun at you.” Wright lowered his gaze slightly, deep in thought. “There are… too many servants in the residence. I can’t count them all. Without you, no one will probably notice.”

Lina immediately stood up and grabbed Wright’s arm. Her eyes were filled with panic as she said in a terrified voice, “Don’t, don’t be like this. She’s just a servant. She didn’t do anything to offend you. Don’t attack her.”

When Wright heard Lina’s voice, his eyes were filled with laughter. He said, “Seventh Princess, did you say something wrong?”

Lina’s eyes were filled with confusion.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Wright continued, “I’ve never thought of targeting her, nor have I thought of attacking her. I just want to deal with you.”

Lina blinked in confusion and gradually came back to her senses. Wright wanted to threaten her with Via’s life.

Via was the only person who mattered to her here.

Lina snorted. Wright was really despicable and shameless. He used all kinds of despicable methods.

Wright aimed the gun at Via, who was not far away. With a lazy smile on his face, he said, “Take off your clothes yourself. If you don’t, I’m afraid your loyal maid might never see the sun tomorrow.”

At first, Via didn’t understand why Lina had asked her to leave, but she finally understood now.

It was a brave act for her to barge in alone. However, she would not be able to help the princess at all. Instead, she would become a burden to her.

Viya said tearfully, “Seventh Princess, it’s all my fault for not doing this. If I hadn’t come over, I wouldn’t have dragged you down. I’m not afraid of death. Don’t listen to him!”

Lina pursed her lips and slowly lowered her gaze to hide the complicated emotions in her eyes. Her lips were pale as she said weakly, “I understand. I’ll take them off. Let her go now!”

“No, Seventh Princess, you can’t do this!” Via shook her head in tears, her voice trembling. “I’ve lived long enough. Just let me die!”

She was just a servant. How could she let the princess sacrifice so much for her?

What the princess would take off was not just her clothes. It was the dignity and nobility of a princess.

Via’s face was covered in tears. She sensed that the grips of the two people holding her had loosened a lot. Without hesitation, she slammed her body towards the door, wanting to die!

As long as she died, the princess would not be threatened by Wright!

But before she could run to the door, she was grabbed by Wright’s men.

Via knelt on the ground in pain. She wanted to die now but when had death become a luxury?

Lina didn’t look at Via. She just stood there calmly, reaching out to unbutton her shirt.

Actually, she had already gotten what she wanted.

It didn’t matter now…

MY.

The night gradually darkened. The waves surged, and the sea breeze turned cold.

Qiao Nian leaned slightly on Gu Zhou’s shoulder and pursed her lips, her eyes filled with confusion. “Didn’t Eldest Senior Brother say that he had gone to pick someone up? It seems to have been a long time.”

Gu Zhou looked down at the stopwatch on his wrist and said calmly, “It has been around 30 seconds.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she immediately sat up and pouted. “You’re mocking me!”

Gu Zhou smiled, his eyes filled with doting love. Just as he was about to say something, footsteps came from outside.

At this moment, the door opened and Chang Feng walked in, supporting an old man.

Qiao Nian followed Gu Zhou’s gaze, and her eyes gradually lit up. She stood up uncontrollably, staring unblinkingly at the old man’s face.
