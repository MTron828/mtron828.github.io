Chapter 416: The Past

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Yu took a few steps back. Looking at Qiao Nian’s back, his frown deepened.

In a daze, he remembered his childhood again.

At that time, Qiao Nian had always liked to follow behind him, constantly calling him Brother Qiao Yu…

Qiao Yu’s throat involuntarily moved. His eyes behind his glasses narrowed slightly as he tried his best to suppress the frustration in his heart.

Qiao Yu pursed his thin lips and clenched his fists tightly.

The little girl had grown up and was no longer obedient.

Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu walked to the dining room. There were fewer people here, so she heaved a sigh of relief.

Now that the auction had yet to begin, the scene just now had already attracted a lot of resentment.

Especially from those women who liked Lu Zhu and Qiao Yu. They probably wanted to kill her directly!

Recalling the nasty words those people had said just now, Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian worriedly and said, “Those people are just spouting nonsense. Don’t take it to heart!”

Qiao Nian smiled indifferently and said, “I’m fine.”

Actually, Qiao Nian was already used to those bad comments. She had always been too lazy to fuss about them. If those people really dared to attack her, she would definitely take revenge ten or a hundred times over.

Lu Zhu was slightly stunned. Seeing how calm Qiao Nian was, it seemed that she really wasn’t affected by what those people had said.

For some reason, Lu Zhu recalled Qiao Nian’s speech at the medical school.

At that time, Qiao Nian had calmly faced those bad critics and directly gave a beautiful speech.

A trace of curiosity flashed across Lu Zhu’s eyes. Qiao Nian had a carefree personality, but why did she always give him a strange look every time she saw him?

Just as Lu Zhu was about to ask about Qiao Nian’s personality, he saw that she had already returned to her usual self.

Lu Zhu suddenly remembered the way Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Nian. It was a possessive look that a man had when he looked at a woman. Almost subconsciously, he asked, “Is Qiao Yu your biological brother?”

“No, I have nothing to do with him,” Qiao Nian said without thinking.

She had long wanted to cut ties with the Qiao family, even if it was only in name.

Lu Zhu was speechless.

She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so honest.

Lu Zhu finally understood Qiao Yu’s hidden intentions.

Seeing that Lu Zhu was looking at her, Qiao Nian explained, “I’m a child adopted by the Qiao family. I heard from Su Xue that my biological mother was abandoned by a wealthy businessman. She couldn’t afford to raise me, so she abandoned me too.”

Lu Zhu listened to Qiao Nian’s calm voice, as if this matter had nothing to do with her. It was as if she was describing the weather today.

Lu Zhu suddenly remembered that he had found out about Qiao Nian previously. She used to live in the countryside, but was only brought to the city when she went to university. However, for some reason, she was sent to a mental hospital.

He had heard from Gu Zhou that Qiao Nian was getting married on behalf of her younger sister.

At this moment, Lu Zhu couldn’t help but pity Qiao Nian.

The best thing that the Qiao couple had done in their lives was to let her marry Gu Zhou.

His heart ached inexplicably.

Lu Zhu was slightly stunned.

To him, Qiao Nian was just a stranger. To put it nicely, she was Gu Zhou’s wife.

But for some reason, when he saw Qiao Nian like this, he felt terrible.

His chest tightened too.

Lu Zhu didn’t even dare to think about it. If his sister, Lu Qi, had been wandering outside and had experienced the same thing as Qiao Nian, he would have wanted to kill those that hurt her.

In Lu Zhu’s opinion, girls should grow up happily. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, Qiao Nian did not notice Lu Zhu’s expression. She calmly picked at her food, as if she did not care about what she had just said.
