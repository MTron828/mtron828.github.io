869 Burden

Xiao Shi coughed non-stop, and her tears fell again. After a long time, she recovered and said, “Xiao Shi is indeed a jinx and a burden. It’s because of Xiao Shi that your life has become so terrible now.”

Song Man was stunned. She frowned and said, “What nonsense are you spouting? What has this got to do with you?”

“It’s all Xiao Shi’s fault.” Xiao Shi cried and wiped her tears, not listening to Song Man at all.

If only she hadn’t appeared.

This morning, she wouldn’t have seen her father angry. This was the first time she had seen her father angry. It was scary.

She had thought that her father had always been a gentle person.

But she was wrong.

Initially, Auntie Nian Nian had good intentions, but Daddy misunderstood Auntie Nian Nian and lost his temper at her.

Auntie Nian Nian was very innocent. Auntie Nian Nian had clearly done nothing wrong.

When she went to see her father, she deliberately pretended to be her brother. It was also a solution she and her brother had thought of. Auntie Nian Nian was just cooperating with her.

However, his father lost his temper at Auntie Nian Nian without distinguishing between right and wrong.

After Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian left, Mommy was also angry when she returned home.

At the thought of this, Xiao Shi felt even sadder. She muttered softly, “If Mommy and I hadn’t come to An City, we wouldn’t have met Brother and Daddy. Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian wouldn’t have gotten into an argument.”

“Mommy won’t think of ruining the relationship between Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian. That way, Mommy won’t be angry often. If we return to Hai Cheng, although life might be very hard every day, Mommy won’t be angry. Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian will reconcile. Mommy, I’ve grown up a lot more than before. I can always take care of Mommy for the rest of my life!”

The light in her eyes gradually disappeared because she recalled that Song Man did not like her. She said dejectedly, “Whether it was in the past or now, I’m redundant. I…”

“What nonsense are you spouting!” Song Man shook off Xiao Shi’s hand in exasperation and said angrily.

Xiao Shi’s hand went limp. Her heart seemed to have been stabbed hard. She looked at Song Man in disbelief.

She didn’t understand what she had said wrong. Why was Mommy angry again?

Song Man was really angered to death by her cowardice.

Xiao Shi was her child, the child she had painstakingly raised.

How could Xiao Shi be so cowardly and unambitious?

Who still advocated kindness these days? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Whoever was kind would be bullied!

She no longer wanted to return to that slum in Hai Cheng, nor did she want to live a cowardly life there.

She clearly could have a better future. Why should she give up all of this?

She wanted to take back everything she had lost!

She had to become the most respected woman in the world!

Song Man sat by the bed with her head lowered and her eyes filled with hatred.

When Xiao Shi saw Song Man’s hand lowered to the side, she hesitantly reached out. She seemed to have thought of something and silently retracted her hand.

Xiao Shi looked up at Song Man and asked seriously, “Mommy, if you don’t think I’m a burden, why did you give me water with sleeping pills?”

Song Man instantly looked up at Xiao Shi in disbelief.

Xiao Shi knew? How was that possible?

She had clearly done it very discreetly.

This morning, Gu Zhou came to the Dongjiang villa, but he didn’t care about her at all. Instead, he left very quickly.

At that time, she was very angry. She felt that Gu Zhou did not take her seriously at all.

She had painstakingly raised Gu Zhou’s child for five years, but Gu Zhou was actually so cold to her.

She was so angry that after returning to her room, she smashed everything in the room.

At that time, Xiao Shi had been standing in a corner.

Xiao Shi was still comforting her not to be too sad. Xiao Shi even said that she would take care of her forever.

However, Xiao Shi did not know that she was targeting Gu Zhou from the beginning.

She had done all of this to be with Gu Zhou.
