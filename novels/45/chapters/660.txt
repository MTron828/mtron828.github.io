Chapter 661: Guest

Lewd?

Using her body to climb up the ranks?

When Lu Nian realized that Su Sheng had used such a word to describe Qiao Nian, he could no longer suppress the anger in his heart.

Although Qiao Nian wasn’t related to him by blood and wasn’t his biological sister, in his opinion, Qiao Nian looked a lot like his biological sister.

The two of them had similar personalities and tastes.

He had always treated Qiao Nian as his confidant.

Now, someone was actually criticizing Qiao Nian in front of him.

Lu Nian couldn’t take it anymore.

He had always had a sharp tongue and usually tried his best to control himself, but now he didn’t want to control his words and actions.

He had never been one to show mercy to others, nor was he one to show mercy to the fairer sex.

“Qiao Nian is an esteemed guest I’ve specially invited over. It’s not up to a rat like you to say anything about my relationship with her. You’re just an extra Sister Gu Qing brought over. What right do you have to judge my esteemed guest?”

Guest?

How was that possible?

How could Qiao Nian be Lu Nian’s distinguished guest?

Lu Nian was the most outstanding genius composer in the world.

How could he treat a gold digger and lewd woman like Qiao Nian be an esteemed guest?

“No… this is absolutely impossible… Qiao Nian can’t be a distinguished guest…” Su Sheng was dumbfounded, muttering to herself.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, she had a strange feeling. She looked up at Lu Nian and smiled.

At this moment, Su Sheng looked at Qiao Nian. Her lips parted slightly, but she couldn’t say a word.

At this moment, Gu Qing could already tell that Lu Nian was angry. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She had grown up with Lu Nian since she was young, so she naturally knew his personality.

Lu Nian thought so highly of Qiao Nian. Previously, Lu Zhu had also asked her to treat that child.

It seemed that Qiao Nian, Lu Zhu, and Lu Nian had a good relationship. Her status shouldn’t be as simple as Miss Qiao.

Gu Qing smiled and walked forward, pulling Su Sheng back. She said, “I just remembered something. We seem to have an appointment with a patient tonight. You guys are busy, so we’ll leave now!”

Gu Qing was really worried that Su Sheng would anger Lu Nian.

“I’m not leaving!” Su Sheng shook off Gu Qing’s hand and shouted.

If a lewd person like Qiao Nian could become Mr. Dong Hua’s distinguished guest, why couldn’t she become his distinguished guest?

She was here today to listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s new song.

It was impossible for her to leave without hearing Mr. Dong Hua’s tune.

Moreover, she had to make Mr. Dong Hua realize that she was the most suitable woman for him. A woman like Qiao Nian was not worthy of being with Mr. Dong Hua at all.

Gu Qing looked at Su Sheng in disbelief. She had never expected that her lively and cheerful junior sister would break down so easily, disregarding her image.

Gu Qing knew that if Su Sheng continued to stay here, who knew what would happen.

She liked Su Sheng a lot. She didn’t want Su Sheng to disappear from An City because of what had happened today.

“Su Sheng, it’s getting late. Come back with me!” Gu Qing said loudly, her expression cold.

“Senior Sister!” Su Sheng felt terrible. Her senior sister, who had always doted on her the most, was also on Qiao Nian’s side.

“If you don’t want to make things worse, leave with me immediately!” Gu Qing said sternly, her expression cold.

Seeing Gu Qing like this, Qiao Nian knew that she was angry. She frowned slightly and her gaze fell on Su Sheng’s face again.

Qiao Nian could tell that Gu Qing was helping Su Sheng.

However, when she was in the elevator, Su Sheng was still slandering Gu Qing’s professional abilities.

Su Sheng really didn’t deserve a senior sister like Gu Qing.

Of course, Qiao Nian wouldn’t say such a thing.

Su Sheng looked at Gu Qing in disbelief. Her eyes were slightly red as she said pitifully, “Senior, you’ve always been by my side. You know that I like Mr. Dong Hua a lot. Why won’t you help me?”

Gu Qing opened her mouth to speak, but she did not expect Lu Nian to speak first.

“I find it disgusting to be liked by someone like you.”

Lu Nian’s words were as cold and cruel as ever.
