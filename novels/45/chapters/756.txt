757 Meeting an Online Friend

Gu Qi’s face instantly darkened. The latest message was an hour ago. He got into the car with a worried expression.

As soon as he got into the car, he hurriedly told the driver the address and looked worriedly at the scenery outside the window.

Gu Qi was very nervous.

This was the first time he was meeting an online friend.

!!

Xiao Shi was also his first good friend.

It was precisely because he was going to meet a good friend that he was so nervous.

About twenty minutes later, the driver stopped the car by the side of the road and turned to look at Gu Qi. “Little kid, this is the parasol forest you mentioned!”

Gu Qi took out his phone and scanned the payment code of the driver’s phone. After paying, he got out of the car.

Parasol Tree Forest Street was a four-lane asphalt road. Parasol trees were planted on both sides of the road. When a gust of wind blew, yellow leaves fell with the wind, and the ground seemed to be covered in a layer of gold.

Not far away, the lake water was sparkling.

Gu Qi looked around and his gaze landed on the seat beside a sycamore tree beside the lake.

There was a child sitting in the seat.

The child’s back was facing the sunlight from the lake. She seemed to be wrapped in a dazzling light, making it impossible to see her appearance clearly.

A trace of confusion flashed in Gu Qi’s eyes. He walked towards the seat. When he was about to reach it, he called out tentatively, “Xiao Shi.”

When the child heard his voice, she immediately looked up. “Brother Xiao Qi…”

The child had just called out as she sat there in a daze.

Gu Qi walked forward and finally saw what she looked like.

He stood rooted to the ground in a daze, staring at Xiao Xian in disbelief.

He had never expected that there would be someone who looked exactly the same as him in this world.

When he stood in front of Xiao Shi, it was as if he was looking in a mirror. The only difference was their clothes.

For a moment, Gu Qi was so shocked that he couldn’t speak.

How was this possible?

Xiao Shi, who was standing opposite Gu Qi, couldn’t believe that she looked exactly like Gu Qi.

“Brother Xiao Qi, are you my biological brother?” Xiao Shi looked at Gu Qi in surprise and asked in confusion.

From a young age, only family members would look alike.

Actually, Gu Qi didn’t know if he and Xiao Shi were family. His eyes darted around as if he had thought of something. He grabbed Xiao Shi’s hand and asked anxiously and excitedly, “Do you live with your mommy?”

Xiao Shi nodded quickly and asked expectantly, “Brother Xiao Qi, are you living with Daddy?”

When Gu Qi heard Xiao Shi’s words, his eyes lit up.

He had always wanted to find his mommy, but he did not expect happiness to come so suddenly. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He looked at Xiao Shi enviously. How happy was it to be able to live with his mommy? He wanted to live with his mommy since he was young!

Xiao Shi also looked at Gu Qi enviously. It was such a wonderful thing to be able to live with her father. That way, she could be well protected by her father.

Xiao Shi looked up at Gu Qi and asked expectantly, “Brother Xiao Qi, what kind of person is Daddy?”

In the past, when she was in Hai Cheng, she often fantasized that her father would find her and bring her and Mommy home.

Her imaginary father was tall, big, and especially gentle. He would even give her a sweet smile and buy her candy. She would be the happiest child around the house.

When Gu Qi heard Xiao Shi’s words, he thought about it carefully and said, “Daddy is a very good person. He takes good care of me and will protect me!”

Xiao Shi’s eyes lit up. Her father was exactly as she had imagined. She was a little glad that she had met Brother Gu Qi this time because she had also found her father and her brother.

Gu Qi looked at the smile on his face when he was young. He thought for a while and said again, “But Daddy is usually very busy.”

When Xiao Shi heard Gu Qi’s words, she nodded and said, “Brother Xiao Qi, Daddy must be so busy to earn money to support you!”

“How’s Mommy now?” Gu Qi asked expectantly as he pulled Xiao Shi to a seat.
