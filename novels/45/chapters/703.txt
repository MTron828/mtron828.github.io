Chapter 704: Flower Symbolism

Jiang Yue sighed slightly and said, “The purple hyacinth is filled with sorrow, jealousy, and melancholy. The eldest daughter of the Lu family is just a three-year-old child. She’s at the age of innocence. How can she have these emotions? Or do you want her to have these emotions? I mean, who do you want her to be jealous of?”

Seeing that Qiao Nian’s expression didn’t change, Jiang Yue thought to herself that Qiao Nian was quite persistent. This time, she wanted to see how Qiao Nian would quibble.

“The blue hyacinth represents chastity. The eldest daughter of the Lu family is still young. She’s not suitable for dating at her age, but why do you use the word chastity to describe her? Or do you want her to…”

Jiang Yue didn’t finish her sentence. She changed the topic and continued, “Pink hyacinths represent admiration and romance. Usually, this is used to describe love! It represents how a girl feels when she has a crush on a boy.”

Jiang Yue explained the flower symbolism. Her gaze finally landed on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that Qiao Nian was still unmoved, she knew in her heart that Qiao Nian was already terrified.

“Sister Qiao Nian, you’re deliberately giving her something that’s not suitable for the eldest daughter of the Lu family. You’re letting an innocent child like her have some messy thoughts. You’ll ruin her,” Jiang Yue said bitterly.

Seeing that Jiang Yue had no intention of saying anything else, Qiao Nian looked at her coldly.

Hehe!

In order to deal with her, Jiang Yue deliberately made a mountain out of a molehill, then pinned all the strange accusations on her.

Jiang Yue was simply unscrupulous.

If she were in the Gu family instead of the Lu family, she would have asked someone to chase Jiang Yue out long ago.

Lu Qi looked at the pouch in her hand in disbelief. She had never expected such beautiful hyacinths to have such a bad meaning.

How was this possible?

In Lu Qi’s world, she felt that the most beautiful things should match the best meaning.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was glaring at her without saying anything, Jiang Yue knew that she had angered Qiao Nian. She pretended to be kind and defended Qiao Nian.

“Sister Qiao Nian, I don’t think you know the meaning of hyacinths. That’s why you embroidered them.”

Hearing Jiang Yue’s words, Matriarch Lu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Lu Zhu, who was standing at the side, frowned. He looked at Jiang Yue with a complicated expression and regretted not getting someone to chase her out just now.

Song Yu stood beside Jiang Yue, her expression unchanged. Her gaze landed indifferently on Lu Nian’s face.

Jiang Yue glanced at everyone in the room. When she saw that Lu Nian was angry, she felt a trace of smugness.

Now that Brother Ah Nian was angry, it meant that he already believed her.

However, she felt that Brother Ah Nian’s eyesight was a little bad. He shouldn’t be glaring at her, but at Qiao Nian. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It seemed that her excuse just now had already convinced everyone present.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, Gu Zhou, who was standing beside her, spoke first.

“You are your thoughts. It means that your perception of things shows that your thoughts are dirty.” Gu Zhou’s voice was as cold and low as ever.

He toyed with the pendant on his thumb, exuding a cold aura.

When Song Yu heard Gu Zhou’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She had never expected Gu Zhou to explain for Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to say that either. Her face instantly turned pale in fear, and her voice trembled as she said, “Brother Ah Zhou, don’t misunderstand. Actually, that’s not what I meant. I just wanted to remind Sister Qiao Nian to…”

“Do I need you to remind me?” Qiao Nian interrupted Jiang Yue mercilessly. She raised her eyebrows slightly, her beautiful fox-like eyes filled with disdain.

“You—”
