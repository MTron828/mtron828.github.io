Chapter 696: Declaring Sovereignty

Oh no.

Now, every time she came into close contact with Gu Zhou, she would think of some messy things.

Chen Qing, who had been standing behind Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, saw Second Master’s actions. He opened his mouth slightly, then silently closed it.

His Second Young Master was so domineering today, as if he was announcing that Second Young Madam was his wife.

Sigh.

Didn’t the Lu family already know that Second Young Master was married?

Second Young Master was probably doing this to warn Eldest Young Master Lu not to think about Second Young Madam anymore.

However, he was a little puzzled.

Second Young Master was here today to attend the death anniversary of his ex-fiancée, the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Now, not only did he bring his current wife to attend the death anniversary, but he also pretended to be intimate with her.

Would the Lu family really not care?

Gu Zhou walked in with Qiao Nian in his arms. Chen Qing walked behind with the box in his hand.

When the three of them walked to the middle of the Lu family garden, Lu Zhu and Lu Nian walked out of the room.

When the two of them saw Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, they were both stunned.

Lu Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s hand, which was wrapped around Qiao Nian’s waist. His eyes were filled with surprise.

Had Second Brother recovered from his phobia of women?

Or could it be that their Sugar was so charming that she directly cured Gu Zhou’s illness?

Lu Nian’s mind raced, and he didn’t know what to say.

Lu Zhu looked at Gu Zhou hugging Qiao Nian’s waist and frowned slightly. Gu Zhou was clearly taking advantage of Sugar!

Qiao Nian didn’t think too much about it. A sweet smile appeared on her face as she greeted, “Brother Zhu, Brother Ah Nian!”

She had just greeted them when she was pulled into Gu Zhou’s arms. She looked up at Gu Zhou in confusion and met his deep eyes.

His eyes seemed to speak, silently warning her not to get too close to other men.

Qiao Nian blinked innocently, looking helpless.

She sensed Gu Zhou’s hand holding her waist and his thumb rubbing her waist, making her feel a little itchy. She couldn’t lose her temper.

For some reason, she felt that Gu Zhou was jealous.

She slowly lowered her gaze, her heart in a mess. She recalled Gu Zhou saying that he liked her that night.

“Sister Nian!”

“Sister Nian!”

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian shouted at the same time.

In order to protect Sugar’s identity, the two of them didn’t dare to call Qiao Nian “Sugar” outside.

The two of them sounded exceptionally happy. They didn’t look sad at all.

Gu Zhou glanced at Lu Zhu and Lu Nian indifferently. His gaze finally landed on Lu Zhu’s face, and his eyes darkened.

Lu Zhu met Gu Zhou’s gaze. His expression was calm as he said, “Come in!”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian followed her in.

At this moment, a young girl stood not far from the garden. She was wearing a white dress, and her hair was disheveled. Her gaze was fixed on Gu Zhou’s hand, which was wrapped around Qiao Nian’s waist. She frowned.

She clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms.

After a long while, she let go and pinched off a rose in anger.

She tore off the petals of the roses one by one and threw them to the ground.

She watched as Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian left, her eyes red with anger.

The pitiful petals of the roses had all been removed. She stepped on them.

It seemed that Brother Ah Zhou had long forgotten about her.

She had been by his side for so long, but he had never taken her seriously.

Brother Ah Zhou was especially good at lying. He clearly said that he had an aversion to women and didn’t allow anyone to approach him. Now, he had taken the initiative to hug that little b*tch’s waist, completely ignoring the gazes of others.

Why?

What was wrong with her?

She had given up everything for Brother Ah Zhou, but she had lost everything.

At this moment, she felt the air around her thin. It was a little suffocating. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

What pained her the most was that when Brother Ah Zhou and Qiao Nian stood together, they were really a handsome man and a beautiful woman. They were a perfect match.

If the person standing beside Brother Ah Zhou was her, they would definitely be more compatible.

How could Qiao Nian, that little b*tch from the countryside, be able to meet Brother Ah Zhou, while she could only live like a rat?
