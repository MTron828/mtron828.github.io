Chapter 695: She’s Here

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Lu Nian’s expression froze for a moment. Then, he seemed to have thought of something and his eyes lit up. “Yes, when that happens, Sister can come and take care of us often!”

At that time, he would have more time to interact with his sister.

Lu Nian really regretted it. If he had found his sister earlier, he could have been with her often.

Who asked his sister to marry Second Brother?

Lu Nian’s eyes darted around. He suddenly realized something. He could move directly to the Gu family. At that time, he could spend time with his sister.

Let Big Brother suffer from missing his sister alone!

If his leg was really broken in the future, he would have even more reason to be with his sister for a long time.

At this moment, there was a knock on the study door, followed by the butler’s voice.

“Eldest Young Master, Second Young Master, Second Young Master Gu and Miss Qiao have arrived!”

When Lu Nian heard the butler’s voice, he immediately stood up and hurriedly said, “Got it. Go ahead!”

When Lu Nian heard the footsteps outside fade away, he heaved a sigh of relief. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Lu Nian walked to a mirror beside the study and straightened his clothes. He straightened his hair.

Lu Nian turned to look at Lu Zhu not far away and asked, “Brother, how do I look?”

Lu Zhu put the signed document aside and stood up to walk up to Lu Nian. He glanced at him from head to toe and said indifferently, “You’re dressed very well, but shouldn’t you suppress the smile on your face?”

Lu Nian looked into the mirror and pursed his lips. He felt that he was almost done practicing. Just as he was about to call Lu Zhu to leave with him, he suddenly thought of something and asked in confusion, “If I remember correctly, Second Brother seemed to have set a time limit for Sugar?”

“Yes.” With Lu Nian’s reminder, Lu Zhu remembered.

Lu Nian’s tense mouth instantly curved up as he said happily, “I’ve already called him Second Brother for so many years. What goes around comes around. Now, let’s wait for him to call me Second Brother!”

Since his sister had married him, Gu Zhou would address him as his sister did.

Lu Zhu looked at Lu Nian’s excited expression and reminded him again, “I think you want Grandma to break your legs today!”

Lu Nian’s face instantly fell. With a cold expression, he followed Lu Zhu out.

At this moment, at the entrance of the Lu family villa.

Qiao Nian got out of the car. Her gaze fell on the door of the Lu family villa, and her heart began to race.

When she first came here, she had wanted to accompany Matriarch Gu to celebrate the anniversary of the Lu family’s eldest daughter’s death.

At that time, she had thought that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was really pitiful. Those people who kidnapped the eldest daughter of the Lu family were really evil to the core. They did not even let a child off.

The first time she came here, she sympathized with the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

This time, when she stood at the door, she sighed.

She had never expected her to be the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

If her brother hadn’t been injured in MY, she probably wouldn’t have been able to find her family for the rest of her life.

It was impossible for the Lu family to search for a dead person everywhere.

Qiao Nian looked at the Lu family’s door. She felt a vague sense of familiarity, and a sense of belonging.

“Hand.”

Gu Zhou’s low and hoarse voice came from the side, interrupting Qiao Nian’s thoughts.

Qiao Nian came back to her senses. She turned her head and saw Gu Zhou with his left hand in his pocket, his right hand raised slightly, as if asking her to hold his hand.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly.

Today was the anniversary of Eldest Miss Lu’s death. This wasn’t a wedding. Why did they have to hold hands?

Besides, shouldn’t such an occasion be more serious?

Qiao Nian was about to ignore Gu Zhou’s small actions and enter when her waist suddenly tightened. By the time she came back to her senses, Gu Zhou had already pulled her into his arms.

When her body collided with Gu Zhou’s, her heart began to race. The image of Zhou Zhou kissing her last night flashed across her mind again.

Her mind was filled with that image now, and she couldn’t help but blush
