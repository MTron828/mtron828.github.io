Chapter 708: Mr. Gu…

Jiang Yue’s face was pale. She bit her lip. She felt as if a slap had landed on her face.

Brother Ah Zhou meant that she was no longer allowed to call him Brother Ah Zhou.

Jiang Yue’s heart felt as if it had been stabbed by a sharp blade.

Gu Zhou ignored Jiang Yue’s pitiful gaze. His voice was chilling.

“Do you need me to repeat myself?”

Jiang Yue’s eyes instantly turned red, and tears welled up in her eyes. She cried out pitifully, “Mr… Mr. Gu…”

At this moment, Jiang Yue could feel her heart, which was riddled with holes, shattering into countless pieces that fell to the ground.

Lu Zhu glanced at Jiang Yue, then his gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face again. He nodded approvingly.

At this moment, Lu Nian was stunned.

He had always lived in the Gu family in the past. He had the most contact with Gu Zhou.

He knew that Second Brother had an aversion to women and disliked to interact with any woman.

He was already very shocked when he saw Second Brother hugging Sugar’s waist.

However, he had never expected Second Brother, who kept a low profile, to protect Sugar in public.

Could it be that Second Brother had really fallen for Sugar?

Realizing this, Lu Nian’s eyes were filled with smiles.

Song Yu was so shocked that her heart was about to jump out of her mouth.

She often went to the Gu residence to play and knew Gu Zhou well. In the past, her brothers had never allowed her to interact with Gu Zhou. They even said that Gu Zhou had an aversion to women. If she approached Gu Zhou, it would be bad if Gu Zhou fell ill.

However, she had never expected Gu Zhou to be so close to Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian was only his private doctor.

Song Yu looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes. She was completely certain that Gu Zhou had a strong desire to protect Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou spoke again. “Apologize!”

When Jiang Yue heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyes widened involuntarily. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

Grandma Lu had already stopped pursuing her mistakes. Why was Brother Ah Zhou still…

“Apologize to her now!”

Jiang Yue’s pupils instantly dilated. She didn’t expect Brother Ah Zhou to be so persistent.

“Ah…”

Jiang Yue had just called out when she was suddenly frightened by Gu Zhou’s cold gaze. She hurriedly corrected herself. “Mr. Gu, I really didn’t do it on purpose this time.”

When Gu Zhou heard Jiang Yue’s words, he raised his eyebrows slightly and narrowed his eyes. If looks could kill, Jiang Yue would have died a million times over.

“That means you did it on purpose.”

When Lu Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, he casually added, “Since you did it on purpose, apologize!”

Lu Zhu glanced at Lu Nian, who was not far away. In the past, Sugar had the best relationship with Lu Nian. This time, Lu Nian was the first to speak up for Sugar. Sugar would then have a better impression of Lu Nian.

This wouldn’t do. He was the first to find his sister. He had to leave a particularly good impression on her.

“If you don’t apologize, get out,” Lu Zhu said coldly.

Jiang Yue had never expected Lu Zhu, Lu Nian, and Gu Zhou to be forcing him to apologize.

For a moment, her face turned pale. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

She felt as if she had been cut into pieces. Even this couldn’t ease the pain in her heart.

It was clearly just between her and Qiao Nian.

She could understand why Brother Ah Zhou was helping Qiao Nian.

That was because Qiao Nian was his wife. Brother Ah Zhou definitely cared about his face, so he wasn’t willing to embarrass Qiao Nian.

But why were Lu Zhu and Lu Nian also helping Qiao Nian?

The two of them clearly had nothing to do with Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue felt the air around her become more and more suffocating, and she couldn’t breathe.

Song Yu, who was standing at the side, was also completely stunned. She had never expected her brothers to help Qiao Nian.

She had never received such favor from her brothers.

Lu Qi stood there. She was already a little displeased that Jiang Yue had said that the hyacinth wasn’t good. When she thought about how Jiang Yue seemed to be looking for trouble on purpose, she said, “Sister Jiang Yue, didn’t you hear what my eldest brother, second brother, and Brother Ah Zhou said? Hurry up and apologize to Sister Qiao Nian. Why are you still standing there?”

When Jiang Yue heard Lu Qi’s words, her face instantly turned pale. She had never expected Lu Qi to speak up for Qiao Nian.

Why?

Everyone was biased towards Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue felt that Lu Qi was the easiest to talk to. She looked at Lu Qi pitifully and said aggrievedly, “I just saw Hyacinth’s flower symbolism on the Internet. I’m just telling the truth. I really didn’t target her on purpose!”
