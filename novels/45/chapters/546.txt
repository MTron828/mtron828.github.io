At this moment, a Bentley drove over from afar. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Matriarch Gu looked up. Through the windshield, she saw Chen Qing sitting in the driver’s seat.

Her frown finally eased and she hurriedly walked towards the roadside.

With a smile on his face, the butler said, “Madam, Second Young Master and Second Young Madam have finally returned!”

Matriarch Gu nodded lovingly and said, “Yes, I saw everything!”

When the car stopped, a group of people hurriedly greeted them.

The car door opened. Chen Qing was the first to get out of the car. He walked to the back door and opened it.

When Qiao Nian was in the car, she saw Matriarch Gu standing at the door, looking up expectantly.

When she got out of the car, she immediately met Matriarch Gu’s eyes. Perhaps it was because she was old, but the whites of her eyes had started to turn yellow, and her pupils gradually turned chestnut gray.

When Matriarch Gu saw Qiao Nian, her expression relaxed, and her eyes were filled with smiles.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. A warm current seemed to flow through her heart that heated her entire body. Tears welled up in her eyes.

In her impression, other than her grandfather, this was the first time she had felt this cared for when she went on a long trip. When she returned home, someone at home actually missed her dearly.

She was very touched that she was valued.

She could tell that Matriarch Gu really treated her like her own granddaughter, because the love in her eyes could not be faked.

At this moment, Qiao Nian felt that the heavens had treated her quite well. What she had lacked when she was young, the heavens had slowly made up for it.

She had a grandmother who was not related to her by blood and doted on her very much. She had even found her brother. She also knew where her home was. She would be even happier in the future.

After Qiao Nian got out of the car, she jogged over to Matriarch Gu and took her arm. Pursing her lips slightly, she suppressed the gratitude in her heart and said softly, “Grandma, you haven’t recovered yet. You can’t stand the wind now. Hurry up and go in!”

Matriarch Gu gently patted the back of Qiao Nian’s soft hand. Only then did her heart, which had been in her throat, relax. With a satisfied smile, she said, “It’s just that I haven’t seen you guys in a long time. I’ve been feeling uneasy, so I wanted to see you sooner.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she was a little touched. She gently patted the back of Matriarch Gu’s hand, as if silently comforting her.

Judging from the smile on Matriarch Gu’s face, she probably didn’t know what had happened to them in MY.

Matriarch Gu retracted her gaze from Qiao Nian’s face and looked at her grandson, who was following behind her, with a gratified expression.

Then, her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face again. She asked softly, “You must have encountered a lot of danger this time!”

“No.” Qiao Nian smiled, then took Matriarch Gu’s hand and walked in.

Actually, Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but regret when Qiao Nian went to MY with Lu Zhu.

Although she had watched Lu Zhu grow up, Lu Zhu was still an outsider and a boy. It was very likely that it would be very inconvenient for him to be with Nian Nian.

So that day, when Gu Zhou returned from the company, she told him about this matter.

In her heart, she thought that if the couple went together and came back together, they might be able to improve their relationship. This was what she wanted to see.

However, two days ago, she had been unable to contact Nian Nian and Ah Zhou. She had always thought that something had happened to them. She started to eat vegetarian meals and prayed for their safe return.

Fortunately, the two of them had returned safely.
