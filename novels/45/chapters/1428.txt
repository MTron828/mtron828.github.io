Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly and watched as Gu Ting left. For some reason, she felt that Gu Ting was still very gentle. It was just that Gu Ting wasn’t good at expressing himself.

In some ways, Gu Zhou was really similar to Gu Ting. With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and happened to see his gaze on Gu Ting.

Gu Zhou was indeed not good at expressing himself.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Ting not far away and called out, “Dad!”

Gu Ting stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Qiao Nian with a gentle gaze.

Out of the corner of her eye, Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou and saw that he had already moved his gaze away from Gu Ting.

Gu Zhou was as depressed as ever, unwilling to say anything.

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Dad, have you been busy?”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she took Gu Zhou’s hand and walked towards Gu Ting, a smile in her eyes.

Gu Ting looked at the smile on Qiao Nian’s face and felt only warmth. He recalled the eldest daughter he and Bai Hui had lost.

Everyone said that daughters were their parents’ darlings.

Although he didn’t have a daughter, he still had Sugar as his daughter-in-law. He could feel her concern for him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I’ve been fine recently.” Gu Ting couldn’t help but lie.

Actually, he was very busy, but he couldn’t bear to reject Qiao Nian.

“I wonder if Dad is free for a meal the night after tomorrow?” Qiao Nian asked with a smile, her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowing slightly.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Ting nodded.

Qiao Nian glanced at the clock on the hotel and said, “Dad, it’s getting late. Why don’t we get Chen Qing to send you back?”

Gu Ting shook his head. His gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. Gu Zhou still looked calm. Of course, she couldn’t guess what he was thinking.

“There’s no need. I’ll go back myself!”

After so many years, he was already used to living alone. He was also not used to having others around him.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Ting’s expression. She could sense that Gu Ting wasn’t lying, nor was he being polite. Gu Ting was really used to being alone.

Qiao Nian smiled and waved at Gu Ting. “Dad, take care. Go back and rest early!”

Gu Ting’s heart warmed. He smiled. “Yes, you too. I’m leaving!”

Gu Ting turned around and strode away.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Gu Ting’s back again. He pursed his thin lips and looked at Qiao Nian. “Let’s go back!”

“Okay.”

On the way back, Gu Zhou leaned against the window. His gaze fell on the traffic outside, and his eyes were filled with complicated emotions.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou worriedly. It was rare for Gu Zhou to be so silent. She couldn’t help but hold his hand tightly.

Gu Zhou sensed Qiao Nian’s movements. He turned to look at Qiao Nian, a faint smile on his face.

Qiao Nian knew that she couldn’t interfere in the matter between Gu Ting and Bai Hui. Moreover, she didn’t want Gu Zhou to be sad, so she changed the topic and asked, “By the way, Chen Qing didn’t look well at the hotel just now. Did something happen?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he lowered his gaze slightly and said in a low voice, “It’s not a big deal!”

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Chen Qing had always been calm and steady. How could something that would make Chen Qing anxious be a small matter?

Moreover, she had seen it clearly at that time. Chen Qing’s expression had changed.

Could there be something wrong with the Gu family’s company?

But that wasn’t right either. If something happened to the Gu family’s company, Gu Zhou usually wouldn’t hide it from her.

Then there was only one possibility. Something was wrong with Bai Hui.

Qiao Nian thought to herself that this wasn’t a place to talk, so she didn’t ask further.

Gu Zhou took out his phone and sent Qiao Nian a message.

After sending the message, Gu Zhou pretended to continue playing with his phone.

Qiao Nian’s phone vibrated slightly. She took it out of her pocket. When she saw the content, she frowned slightly.

Gu Zhou: Someone is keeping an eye on my mother.

Although Gu Zhou had only sent a few words, it was like a bomb had exploded in Qiao Nian’s mind.

When they returned home, Qiao Nian felt at ease. The two of them returned to their room. When there was no one else in the room, she looked at Gu Zhou.
