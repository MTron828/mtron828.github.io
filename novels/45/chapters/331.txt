Chapter 332: Familiar

However, Qiao Nian could no longer remember the appearance of the young man in white in her dream.

Perhaps this was just an unimportant dream. Then, a similar song appeared, which made her feel a strange sense of familiarity and closeness with Lu Nian.

Qiao Nian closed her eyes to suppress this strange emotion. When she opened her eyes again, her expression had already returned to normal.

However, that dream was simply too realistic.

The sunlight in her dream, the people in her dream, the music in her dream. Everything felt so real…

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and said, “I think I’ve heard something similar before.”

Lu Nian raised his eyebrows slightly. “Huh?”

He didn’t quite understand what Qiao Nian meant.

Qiao Nian met Lu Nian’s surprised eyes and smiled. “Perhaps I remembered wrongly. Don’t take it to heart.”

If she told Lu Nian about her past dream, Lu Nian might find her childish and dislike her.

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t want to say anything else, Lu Nian fell silent.

After another two minutes, Lu Nian turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked, “It’s time to go on stage. Can you do it?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “I’m always ready.”

The next piece was played together with a violin and cello. Qiao Nian wanted to play the cello.

This song was the theme song for Song Yu’s new movie, Chess Soul. However, the movie had yet to be released, and this song had only been released for a short while. This concert was the first time this song would be played.

If this happened to anyone else, they might feel a little pressured, but Qiao Nian wouldn’t feel any pressure.

Qiao Nian flicked her fingers, and a pleasant tune resounded throughout the entire stadium.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Although Qiao Nian was tall, she looked exceptionally petite in front of the cello. When she closed her eyes and immersed herself in playing the cello, she looked like girl who was not familiar with the world.

Some people were immersed in the music, and their eyes closed as they enjoyed the image brought about by the music.

Of course, there were not only musicians in the stadium, but also some producers and managers. All of them looked at Qiao Nian with burning eyes, as if they were looking at a mountain of gold.

If they could work with Qiao Nian, they believed that Qiao Nian would become the most dazzling person on screen in less than a year.

At this moment, Brother Cao naturally noticed their gazes. He glared fiercely at them, his eyes seemingly spitting fire.

Qiao Nian belonged to him!

No one could snatch her from him!

The two-hour concert ended very quickly. When Qiao Nian walked down from the stage, her hands were already numb. She sat lazily on the sofa.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Lu Nian recalled how valiant and heroic Qiao Nian had looked when she played the violin on stage. He smiled and asked, “Are you tired?”

Qiao Nian nodded. “Yes.”

“Then you’ll have to work harder later. There’s a celebration banquet tonight!”

Qiao Nian’s little face instantly fell. She blinked her fox-like eyes in confusion and asked pitifully, “Can I not go?”

Her voice trailed off, giving off the impression that she was complaining.

After that song, she had already treated Lu Nian as the young man in white in her dream. She couldn’t help but feel closer to him.

Music had such a magical effect. It would allow two unfamiliar people to approach each other slowly. It would also allow the two of them to have a tacit understanding.

Of course, Qiao Nian didn’t realize that her tacit understanding had already become cordial.

Lu Nian was slightly stunned when he saw Qiao Nian’s face. There was a hint of doting in his eyes. So this little fox knew how to behave in a spoiled manner.

He had a feeling that Qiao Nian treated him like her older brother. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Brother Cao had been with Lu Nian for some years. Seeing Lu Nian like this, he instantly knew what he meant. Just as he was about to stop him, he heard Lu Nian say, “Then we’ll cancel the banquet!”
