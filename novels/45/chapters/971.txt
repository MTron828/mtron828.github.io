972 Awake?

She was a little stunned!

Gu Zhou was clearly an invalid. How could he be so strong?

She had really miscalculated!

Qiao Nian had just stretched her arm out of the blanket and was about to sit up again when the man reached out and pulled her into his arms.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian was stunned for a moment. She turned her head and saw Gu Zhou lying beside her.

Gu Zhou raised his head slightly and planted a gentle kiss on Qiao Nian’s forehead. Only then did he look at Qiao Nian. His eyes were like the vast starry sky.

“Nian’er, are you awake?”

His voice was just like when they had just made love. It was low and sexy, making one’s ears pregnant.

What embarrassed her the most was that he had insisted on calling her name back then. He had even forced her to respond and asked her to respond. He had even asked her not to be shy.

God damn it, don’t be shy?

Now that she thought of how she had interacted with him so closely, her face turned red uncontrollably. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At that time, she didn’t feel tired or in pain. Now, she couldn’t move at all.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said, “I…”

Uh.

Her voice had gone hoarse!

It was all this brazen man’s fault.

She couldn’t move or speak now!

Qiao Nian lay flat on the bed and silently moved to the side!

Gu Zhou sensed Qiao Nian’s small actions and asked with concern in a low voice, “Where are you going now?”

“I…” Qiao Nian’s voice was hoarse. She coughed and said hoarsely, “I think I have to apply some pain medication and eat some pills…”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes were filled with laughter. He gently pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and bit her earlobe. Only then did he say, “Looks like you still have strength. Why don’t we continue?”

Continue?

Qiao Nian was extremely tired now. She didn’t want to continue at all. She turned to look at Gu Zhou. “No, I want to… um…”

Without hesitation, Gu Zhou kissed Qiao Nian’s lips and pressed himself against her.

After a long while, Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian. Looking at Qiao Nian’s flushed face, his eyes were filled with smiles. “What should I do? You’re too delicious.”

“Ahem.” Qiao Nian coughed and said solemnly, “Um, Mr. Gu… um!”

Gu Zhou gave Qiao Nian a light kiss on the lips. After letting go of her, he said seriously, “You called me by the wrong name. This is a small punishment for you!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

“Gu Zhou, you… Oh!”

“Wrong again!

“Ah Zhou, don’t. Oh!”

Qiao Nian really didn’t want to continue arguing with Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou had been the one doing the work just now. Why did he have so much strength?

“Hub…” Qiao Nian called out halfway, but she couldn’t say the word “hubby” no matter what, let alone look into Gu Zhou’s expectant gaze.

“If you do this, your body will weaken!”

“I won’t!”

“I’m a doctor!”

“I’ve been waiting for you all these years!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

This man had really planned to have her for a long time.

The next morning, at the hospital.

Qiao Shan and Su Xue ate breakfast in silence.

After breakfast, Su Xue stood up and hurriedly put away the dishes. She lowered her head in silence.

The entire ward was very quiet. One could vaguely hear the commotion outside.

After Su Xue was done, Qiao Shan looked up at her and said, “Are you really willing to do that?”

Su Xue stood rooted to the ground, looking at Qiao Shan from afar. She pursed her lips and nodded. Afraid that Qiao Shan would be worried about her, she said, “I know what to do.”

Su Xue had already thought of a foolproof plan.

She left Qiao Shan’s ward and went straight to Qiao Xin’s. She closed the door and saw Qiao Xin’s dark expression.

Su Xue was about to speak when she heard the people standing at the door of Qiao Xin’s ward muttering.

“Have you heard? It’s the woman in this ward who personally broke her father’s leg!”

“I’ve long heard that Qiao Shan is really pitiful. The daughter he painstakingly raised broke his leg. How horrible is that!”

“What an ingrate!”

“This kind of woman doesn’t deserve to live!”

...

… .

Su Xue sat in Qiao Xin’s ward. Both she and Qiao Xin heard everything the people outside said clearly.
