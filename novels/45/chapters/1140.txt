Chapter 1141: Guest?

Under the gentle light, her beautiful black hair fell behind her like a waterfall. Her face was smooth, and there was a trace of sternness on her oval face.

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating like a drum. Her body stiffened slightly as she stood rooted to the ground, staring unblinkingly at the woman.

She was her mother, Su Yan.

She had known before that her mother was already in her fifties. She had thought that no matter how well her mother took care of herself, she might be able to see the traces of time on her face.

But she was wrong.

Su Yan’s face was as if she had never experienced the passage of time. She looked like a beautiful woman in her thirties.

She exuded a dignified aura that was a little terrifying.

Qiao Nian had thought that her mother was a gentle mother. Now, it seemed that her mother was a strict mother.

Previously, Gu Zhou had said that her mother was very gentle, but why did she feel that her mother seemed to be especially amazing!

Qiao Nian recalled Bai Hui whom she had seen before. Bai Hui was also a very strict mother!

The only difference was that Bai Hui still exuded an overbearing aura, while Su Yan exuded a dignified aura that made one admire her wholeheartedly!

Perhaps it was because Qiao Nian’s gaze was too hot, but Su Yan also noticed Qiao Nian!

When Su Yan saw Qiao Nian, she was slightly stunned. She frowned and glanced coldly at her sons, her tone filled with displeasure. “There are guests at home. Why didn’t you tell me in advance?”

As she spoke, Su Yan tidied her pajamas slightly, as if to express her courtesy to a guest!

At this moment, everyone from the Lu family’s gaze fell on Lu Zhu’s face, signaling for him to introduce Qiao Nian to Su Yan.

Su Yan naturally noticed the children’s gazes. A trace of surprise flashed in her eyes, but she quickly regained her composure and asked, “Is this lady your girlfriend?”

When everyone heard Su Yan’s words, they were all stunned on the spot! What was going on in her mind!

Lu Qi was clearly holding Qiao Nian’s arm. If Mom wanted to suspect something, she should suspect that Qiao Nian was Lu Qi’s friend!

How could his mother have thought that Qiao Nian was Big Brother’s girlfriend?

At this moment, Gu Zhou walked over and greeted very politely, “Auntie Su, long time no see!”

When Su Yan heard this voice, her eyes instantly softened. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and her lips curved up slightly. She quickly walked to the door. “Xiao Zhou, come over and let Auntie take a look at you. How have you been these past few years?”

At this point, Su Yan seemed to have thought of something. She looked at Qiao Nian and smiled. “Is this lady your girlfriend?”

Gu Zhou had a gentle smile on his face, looking like a humble and polite gentleman. He began, “I heard from Big Brother that Auntie had returned today, so I wanted to bring my wife to visit. Did I disturb Auntie?”

“How can you be disturbing me? You look much better than before. It’s cold outside. Hurry in!” Su Yan knew that Gu Zhou’s health wasn’t good. It wouldn’t be good if he caught a cold!

Su Yan couldn’t help but sigh in her heart!

Gu Zhou was a good child!

If her eldest daughter was still around, Gu Zhou would be her son-in-law!

Fate really made fools of people!

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian. Lu Qi subconsciously hurriedly let go of Qiao Nian and stood obediently on the other side.

“Auntie Su, her name is Qiao Nian. She’s my wife!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Let’s talk as we go in!” Su Yan gestured for Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian to walk in. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. When she saw Qiao Nian’s eyes, her heart skipped a beat!

Perhaps it was really a coincidence that Gu Zhou had not become her son-in-law, but Gu Zhou’s wife looked very similar to the Lu family’s daughter.

Especially Qiao Nian’s eyes. They were exactly the same as hers.

She still remembered that her eldest daughter’s eyes were the same as hers. If her eldest daughter grew up, she would probably have the same eyes as Qiao Nian’s.

For some reason, she felt that this girl looked especially amiable. Then, she looked at Gu Zhou and said gently, “The two of you are really a match made in heaven. You look very compatible.. I wish you a happy marriage for a hundred years!”
