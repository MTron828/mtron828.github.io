1107 Your family’s…

Seeing that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were deep in thought, Qin Chuan comforted them. “Don’t worry, we’ll definitely find the child!”

Qin Chuan only hoped that that child would have an easier time and not have a bad childhood like Xiao Shi!

“Yes, we’ll investigate this matter according to the enemies of the Gu family and the Lu family.” Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment and continued, “At the same time, we’ll investigate which hospital did a HLA examination in.”

“Are you saying that before your accident, someone matched your bone marrow transplant with Song Man’s?” Qin Chuan said with a frown.

“Yes, that person must have confirmed that my bone marrow matched Song Man’s, so he kidnapped me! If you’re not wrong, my role for those people is to be Song Man’s bone marrow donor,” Qiao Nian said solemnly.

Qin Chuan clenched his fists involuntarily. At that time, Qiao Nian was only three years old. How could those people be so heartless?

Qin Chuan finished the last bit of coffee in his cup. He was a little frustrated, but he couldn’t show it in front of Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou. He said, “I have other things to do now. I’ll go get busy first. You called me over today. You’ve really delayed my date. You have to make it up to me later!”

Qiao Nian tilted her head and looked at Qin Chuan. Then, she smiled and said seriously, “I’ll definitely make it up to you. When the time comes, I’ll definitely help you find a serious girlfriend, lest you tire yourself out!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Qin Chuan pursed his lips in disapproval. When he smiled, there was a roguish look on his face. “Your misunderstanding of me is really too deep. Every girlfriend I have is very serious, okay?”

“Is that so? Are you two very serious? Why can’t I tell?” Qiao Nian smiled and teased, “Then which serious girl have you taken a liking to recently?”

Qin Chuan smiled until his eyes curved up. His long eyelashes lowered slightly, hiding the seriousness in his eyes.

Your family’s…

“Take a guess!” Qin Chuan glanced at his watch and stood up. “Alright, I’ll leave first!”

Qiao Nian knew that Qin Chuan wasn’t a decent man. He was almost thirty years old, and he was still acting like a child!

She wondered who Qin Chuan would be with in the end. She wondered which woman was so charming that she could make Qin Chuan, this player, behave himself!

After Qin Chuan left, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou returned to the private room and sat down!

Gu Zhou took a slow sip of coffee and said with a complicated expression, “To be able to count the families that have existed for more than twenty years, those who can do so much must have a complicated family background!”

“Our search area has narrowed significantly.” Qiao Nian thought about it carefully and said in confusion, “I just don’t understand. Why would those people attack your brother and grandfather?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou seriously and asked, “Do you think he’s an enemy of our families?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he lowered his gaze thoughtfully. “The same people attacked us. They should be dissatisfied with both our families!”

“That’s what I thought. When the time comes, we can get rid of the families our families have been friends with for a long time. That way, the search area will be narrowed down again.” After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she vaguely felt that something was wrong.

“No, the person who attacked us might be beside us. They’re familiar with our every move. Back then, Song Man needed a bone marrow transplant. They discovered that my bone marrow matched hers. That means that they are very close to our family!”

“Let’s confirm the scope again,” Gu Zhou said with a serious expression. “Uncles and aunties of the Lu family announced to the public that they only had Lu Zhu as their only child. Very few large families know of your existence. The doctors and nurses who delivered your child when you were born also know your identity. They might be able to get your biological information.”

“I think we can find those people related to this, then investigate everyone they came into contact with. The child is around three years old.” Qiao Nian said eagerly. What had happened more than twenty years ago had already happened. She would have plenty of time to settle scores with those people in the future, but the most important thing now was to find their child first!
