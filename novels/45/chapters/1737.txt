Chapter 1738 - 1738 Dreaming

When did so many suspicious people appear in Europe?

At this moment, from the corner of his eye, Wright saw a figure flash. It was obvious that it was Chen Qing. He took out his gun and shot at the figure without hesitation.

However, the bullet did not hit that person.

Seeing this, Wright snorted and said angrily, “I’ve let you hide again. You’re like a rat, hiding everywhere. You can’t see the light of day.

As soon as he finished speaking, he was knocked down.

At this moment, Wright understood that Chen Qing had deliberately moved just now to distract him so that the person who had ambushed him would succeed.

Even though Wright had already thought everything through, he could no longer dodge because he had already been kicked to the ground. His bones were about to fall apart.

Wright looked at the person who had kicked him away with a dark gaze. When he saw that it was Gu Zhou, he was stunned.

“Why is it you?” Wright frowned. His men had been monitoring Gu Zhou in the hospital. Gu Zhou had been staying in the ward. When did he come out?

Wright’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s leg. Previously, when he fought with Gu Zhou, he had injured Gu Zhou’s leg. He had only suffered a small injury to begin with. He did not expect his people to say that Gu Zhou’s leg was seriously injured and he needed to be hospitalized for surgery.

Could it be that Gu Zhou had only pretended to be injured previously?Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Could Gu Zhou be up to something again?!

With this thought in mind, Wright slowly stood up. His gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face and he smiled disdainfully. “What’s wrong? Haven’t I beaten you up before?”

Although he had never hit Gu Zhou before, Gu Zhou was still injured, especially the bandaged wound on Gu Zhou’s face. He was the one who had injured him.

At this moment, Wright’s white shirt was in tatters, and his body was covered in blood from the knife wounds. He looked like a bloody man. Even so, he was still fearless.

“Are you dreaming?” Gu Zhou said disdainfully, sizing Wright up. “Loser!”

Wright glanced at the people behind Gu Zhou. His eyes darted around and he questioned, “Gu Zhou, you’re really bold. You brought so many people to Europe. Why? Do you want to take Europe down?”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Wright laughed wantonly and said, “But you’ve made a mistake. Do you think you can take down Europe so easily? You’re dreaming!”

When Lina rushed over, she saw Gu Zhou and Wright facing each other. Beside Gu Zhou were Qiao Nian and Chen Qing.

Seeing Chen Qing standing there unscathed, she heaved a sigh of relief.

Wright’s sharp eyes saw Lina approaching and he subconsciously grabbed her.

Qiao Nian noticed Wright’s intentions. Wright was a crazy dog. In such a critical situation, it was very likely that Wright would use Lina to threaten them. She hurriedly said, “Ah Zhou, don’t let Wright touch Lina!”

Chen Qing was already exhausted. When he heard Qiao Nian’s words, he subconsciously rushed over. However, after dodging bullets for a long time, his body was almost at its limit. At this moment, he didn’t have the strength to go over at all. He staggered and almost fell.

Qiao Nian’s sharp eyes noticed that Chen Qing was weak. She hurriedly helped him up.

At this moment, Gu Zhou had already rushed up to Wright and kicked him away. Then, he gestured for Lina to go over to Chen Qing.

Lina walked over to Chen Qing. Seeing how weak Chen Qing was, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

She had heard so many bullets just now and was really afraid that Chen Qing would be hurt. However, now that she saw Chen Qing again, she heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Chen Qing was fine.

Lina glanced at Gu Zhou’s men, who had already subdued all of Wright’s guards. She was no longer afraid of Wright. Supporting Chen Qing, she looked at the disheveled Wright. “Wright, you brought this upon yourself. Let me tell you, I’ve already contacted my father. Just wait for him to send you to prison!”
