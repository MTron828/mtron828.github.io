1114 Died For Me

[Thursday, 4.20. Thunderstorm.

Those people are too sharp. They actually realized that I had already discovered that Brother Lu Zhu’s sister was not dead. Moreover, the eldest daughter of the Lu family is actually in An City. They want to kill me. This won’t do. I have to bring Brother Lu Zhu’s sister to him so that I can repay Brother Lu Zhu for saving my life.]

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red uncontrollably. She pursed her lips, trying hard to suppress the sorrow in her heart.

[Friday, 4.21. Sunny.

They’re chasing after me now. I don’t dare to look for Brother Lu Zhu’s sister, afraid that those people will also attack Brother Lu Zhu’s sister. I think I might die.]

Jiang Cheng’s diary stopped on April 21st.

From Jiang Cheng’s diary, it could be seen that he had already found her. Moreover, he wanted to help her return to the Lu family.

However, Jiang Cheng was outnumbered and was killed by those people!

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with hatred. Who exactly was the “they” Jiang Cheng was referring to?

Jiang Cheng had not been in An City for long. He had only stayed in the Lu family for a day and went out to play with Lu Qi.

The letter from Jiang Cheng had also mentioned that someone had called and mentioned the eldest daughter of the Lu family. This meant that that person was a guest at the Lu family on April 18th.

Jiang Cheng had died for her. As long as she handed this diary to Jiang Chi, he would believe that Jiang Cheng was not killed by Lu Zhu.

Qiao Nian flipped back to the first page of the diary, preparing to capture every diary entry by Jiang Cheng.

At this moment, the study door opened.

Gu Zhou walked in. He had thought that Qiao Nian would just make a call and would quickly return to take care of the children with him.

However, Qiao Nian had never returned. Now that he had finally coaxed the children to sleep, he came to look for Qiao Nian!

Qiao Nian took a photo of a notebook with her phone. Her expression was serious, as if she hadn’t noticed him entering.

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and bent down slightly. He hugged Qiao Nian from behind and gently placed his chin on the top of her head. He asked gently, “What are you busy with?”

Gu Zhou’s voice was low and hoarse. It was magnetic, as if there was a magic in it that soothed Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, she looked up at him and said with red-rimmed eyes, “This is Jiang Cheng’s diary. I’ve found new clues!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s red eyes and kissed her forehead with heartache. “If you’re sad, I’ll be sad too!”

“Jiang Cheng died for me!” Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly and said in pain, “Those people changed my life. I do hate them very much. No matter what reason they have, I can’t forgive them! But when I found out that Jiang Cheng died for me, I suddenly realized something. Perhaps many people were killed by them because of me. I don’t know how to make it up to them!”

“This isn’t your fault. It’s those people’s fault.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he took the diary from Qiao Nian. “Let me take a look!”

Qiao Nian’s emotions were complicated now. Initially, she had only wanted to settle scores with those people in a hurry to find her child. But now, she felt that her responsibilities were even greater!

Gu Zhou flipped through the diary from beginning to end. He read it very quickly. Qiao Nian could notice that he was holding the diary tightly, frowning and looking serious. She thought that Gu Zhou must have seen the diary entry about Gu Yue.

Gu Zhou took a deep breath. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. His eyes were very bright like the stars in the sky in the darkness, shining with hope.

“My brother is still alive.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and said, “Perhaps he’s someone who looks like him. Jiang Cheng also said that Gu Yue didn’t recognize him!”

Gu Zhou shook his head and said disapprovingly, “Jiang Chi and Big Brother have a good relationship. Big Brother has always been with Jiang Chi in the past. Big Brother watched Jiang Cheng grow up. It’s impossible for Jiang Cheng to be mistaken!”

Qiao Nian said eagerly, “Then let’s go to MY immediately!”

“Yes.” Gu Zhou continued reading. When he saw the last part of the diary, his eyes were filled with killing intent!
