1128 Why did you shoot?

When Jiang Chi saw Qiao Nian, his gaze fell on her face. Back then, when he saw Qiao Nian in the Ghost City, she was wearing a tight-fitting outfit and looked valiant and heroic!

Now, Qiao Nian was wearing a long white dress and red high heels. She was wearing a white wool coat, and her hair was draped over her shoulders. There was a pentacle diamond hair clip in her hair, making her look like a doll.

This was the first time he had seen such a quiet and beautiful Qiao Nian. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s clenched hands. He frowned and looked at Gu Zhou sinisterly.

Gu Zhou noticed Jiang Chi’s gaze. He met his gaze coldly, as if announcing that Qiao Nian was his woman!

Qiao Nian’s heart was focused on Lu Qi. She subconsciously let go of Gu Zhou’s hand, not noticing the small movements between Gu Zhou and Jiang Chi. She quickly walked to Lu Qi’s side and grabbed her hand, asking worriedly, “How are you? Are you injured? Are you frightened?”

When Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s concern, the grievance in her heart instantly surged. However, because there were outsiders present, she was too embarrassed to cry.

Suppressing her tears, Lu Qi glanced at Qin Chuan beside her and said to Qiao Nian, “Sister, I’m fine. It’s just that Mr. Qin’s face is injured!”

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze from Lu Qi’s face and her gaze fell on Qin Chuan’s face. When she saw the blood on Qin Chuan’s face, she frowned. She looked at Jiang Chi coldly and questioned, “Why did you shoot? What exactly are you doing here?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Jiang Chi couldn’t be bothered to explain these things anymore. He didn’t answer Qiao Nian’s question. Instead, he asked, “Where are the clues? Or were you just patronizing me on the phone? Actually, you didn’t find any clues! Or perhaps you didn’t investigate this matter at all!”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Chi’s words, her expression instantly darkened. A chill ran down her spine. Suppressing her anger, she said, “It’s been two years, but you haven’t found out anything about your brother. Do you think I can find out something so easily?”

Qiao Nian glanced at Lu Qi and pulled her behind her. She questioned, “Are you threatening me with my sister? If Old Qin hadn’t come today, what would you have done to my sister? Kill her? Huh?”

“You’re thinking too much,” Jiang Chi said lightly. He glanced at Lu Qi, then at Qiao Nian. The two of them indeed looked alike. “She’s my sister-in-law. As long as she listens to me obediently, I won’t let her suffer at all!”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Chi’s words, a trace of surprise flashed across her face. Lu Qi was still so young. How could she have married Jiang Cheng?

Could it be that Lu Qi was engaged to Jiang Cheng?

Qiao Nian felt dizzy. She recalled Jiang Cheng lying in the ice coffin and said coldly, “She’s my sister. When did she become your sister-in-law?”

“Lu Qi solved the ten questions my brother left behind. Before my brother left, he said that if the person who solved the ten questions he wrote was a woman, he would marry that person. I came here today to bring Lu Qi to get married with my brother!” Jiang Chi said impatiently. He had already repeated these words a few times. He wanted to throw up!

Lu Qi grabbed Qiao Nian’s clothes and added, “Sister. he said that if I wasn’t willing, he would kill me and let me die with Brother Jiang Cheng!”

With her sister around, Lu Qi felt very safe.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, her pupils dilated. She was a little afraid!

Back in the Ghost City, Qiao Nian had realized that Jiang Chi’s way of thinking was different from others. It was always unexpected.

Most of the time, after a person died, their relatives would choose to bury them in the ground for peace. Jiang Chi was very simple. He placed them in an ice coffin.

Just like how Jiang Chi treated disobedient people and casually took that woman’s uterus. This was more serious than any punishment.

Now, Jiang Chi insisted on helping Jiang Cheng marry Lu Qi because of a casual sentence he had said when he was alive. Ordinary people would not have the same thought.
