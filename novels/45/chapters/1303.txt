1304 Pain

The incident at the amusement park was really an accident. No one had expected Cui Huai to send so many people to assassinate her and Gu Zhou.

It must be because she and Gu Zhou had not met Mr. Chen as promised that Cui Huai was suspicious.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, she suddenly felt a wet and hot feeling in her palm. A numbing feeling spread throughout her body through her blood.

Qiao Nian’s ears turned red involuntarily. Instinctively, she retracted her hand and asked in a low voice, “Does it still hurt?”

Gu Zhou nodded and said softly, “It hurts.”

Perhaps it was because his body was too weak, but his voice was weak. Coupled with his magnetic voice, it was like a feather teasing Qiao Nian’s heart.

Qiao Nian’s heart itched. Looking into Gu Zhou’s lustful eyes, she suddenly recalled how Gu Zhou had looked in bed.

Every time she slept with Gu Zhou, he would always look at her like this.

Could this man still be thinking about that kind of thing!

“Nian’er.”

Qiao Nian’s heart was in her throat. For some reason, she felt a little nervous. His voice was exactly the same as when he had called her name in bed.

She swallowed and asked seriously, “What’s wrong?”

“You have to blow on it so it won’t hurt.”

Qiao Nian’s expression froze for a moment. In a daze, she seemed to see Zhou Zhou.

Zhou Zhou would act like this every time. Every time, she was helpless against him.

She came back to her senses and looked at Gu Zhou seriously. “What you need now is rest. The wound has already been bandaged for you.”

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly, a trace of a smile in his eyes. “I heard that kissing can relieve pain. Why don’t we give it a try?”

Qiao Nian pulled her hand out of Gu Zhou’s grip and carefully covered him with the blanket. She said softly, “You should lie on the bed and sleep obediently. Don’t think about such nonsense.”

Qiao Nian was about to sit back down when she saw Gu Zhou’s pitiful eyes. She sighed helplessly and stood up to move closer to Gu Zhou. Her ears were red, and she closed her eyes, gently kissing Gu Zhou’s lips.

She had only wanted to give Gu Zhou a light kiss. Just as she was about to leave, Gu Zhou held the back of her head tightly with one hand and deepened the kiss.

Gu Zhou frowned and let go of Qiao Nian reluctantly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qiao Nian tucked her hair behind her ear. Looking at Gu Zhou, who was still licking his lips, she instantly blushed.

This man was really despicable!

Gu Zhou said to the door, “Come in.”

Chen Qing walked in with a bento box. When he saw Gu Zhou, his eyes lit up and he asked with concern, “Second Young Master, how do you feel now? Are you feeling better?”

“Yes,” Gu Zhou said in a low voice.

Chen Qing quickly walked up to Gu Zhou and helped him roll up the bed so that Gu Zhou could sit down and eat.

Chen Qing bought food for two people. There were two bowls of porridge and four dishes.

Qiao Nian handed the disposable chopsticks to Gu Zhou and looked up at Chen Qing. “Have you eaten?”

“I ate outside,” Chen Qing said.

Gu Zhou was about to eat his porridge when he paused and looked at Chen Qing. “How’s the matter going?”

“Second Young Master, I’ve already handed over the evidence of Kan Shan’s assassination of you to Interpol. Kan Shan is receiving treatment in the next room now, but he woke up early. Interpol has already taken his statement.” At this point, Chen Qing paused and said in a low voice, “However, Kan Shan only said that he has a personal grudge against you. He didn’t mention anything about Cui Huai.”

Gu Zhou slowly ate a spoonful of porridge before picking up a piece of cabbage. He asked thoughtfully, “What did the Interpol say?”

“They seem to have been investigating Cui Huai. They also know that Kan Shan is Cui Huai’s subordinate. Their attention has already shifted to Cui Huai.” Chen Qing told Gu Zhou everything he had heard. In order not to let the Interpol officers guarding the door hear him, he deliberately lowered his voice. “Second Young Master, I’m afraid we can’t convict Cui Huai this time.”
