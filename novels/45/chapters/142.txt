Chapter 143 Touched

Gu Zhou waved at Chen Qing, who was in the car not far away.

Chen Qing hurriedly drove over. After parking the car, he hurriedly got out and opened the door.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. Seeing that Gu Zhou had defended her today, she decided not to make a fuss. Hence, she got into the car.

Chen Qing was sitting in the driver’s seat, driving. He snuck a glance at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian in the rearview mirror. His lips curved up slightly. It seemed that Master Gu’s feelings for his wife had changed. In the past, Master Gu had never been one to chase after women…

When Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian returned to the Gu family villa, Qiao Nian was called away by Matriarch Gu immediately. Matriarch Gu said that there was something very important.

Matriarch Gu brought Qiao Nian to her office and said excitedly, “Come in quickly. I have a huge matter to discuss with you!”

Qiao Nian saw that there was a lot of fabric in Matriarch Gu’s office. There was also a sewing machine and a workbench beside it. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Matriarch Gu smiled at Qiao Nian and said gently, “Nian Nian, you’ve arrived at the right time. Come over quickly, I’ll help you take your measurements.”

Zhao Qian, who had been standing at the side, froze for a moment. After a beat, she smiled at Qiao Nian. “Second Sister-in-law, good evening.” Smiling, Qiao Nian greeted Zhao Qian.

“Qian Qian, where’s the tape measure?” Matriarch Gu smiled at Zhao Qian.

Zhao Qian hurriedly brought the tape measure over.

Matriarch Gu was in a very good mood. With a smile on her face, she said, “I knew your figure the moment I saw you. However, in order to make a gown that will fit you better, I plan to take your measurements more precisely.”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, a trace of emotion flashed in her eyes.

Before Matriarch Gu retired, she had been a world-renowned fashion designer. Celebrities would fight among themselves just to get their hands on a dress Matriarch Gu had designed.

Moreover, there were rumors that Matriarch Gu had once helped her daughter-in-law make an embroidered wedding gown. The value of that gown had skyrocketed to an immense amount.

Not only that, but that wedding gown had become the favorite of people all around the world, and still retained that status today.

Seeing Matriarch Gu taking her measurements seriously, Qiao Nian felt a warmth in her heart. She said, “Grandma, you haven’t recovered yet. Don’t go to so much trouble. It will consume too much of your energy. It won’t be good for your health.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she said with emotion, “My darling child, I knew you would say that. You’re just too concerned about me.”

Matriarch Gu paused for a moment, then continued, “After what happened the last time, I’ve learned one thing. When one is alive, one should not leave behind any regrets. I want to make a perfect gown for you in my lifetime.”

“Grandma, I don’t attend banquets. I don’t need evening gowns,” Qiao Nian said gently.

“Child, you’re really humble. I heard from Ah Zhou that you’ll be giving a speech at the Second Academy of Medicine as a lecturer. It’s such an important event! You can’t continue keeping a low profile there. I hope that you’ll wear the gown I’ve made for you. When the time comes, you’ll be the center of attention, and everyone will know how outstanding you are,” Matriarch Gu said earnestly. When Qiao Nian heard this, her eyes grew hot. If she had felt some warmth in her heart before, she was even more touched now.

Although Matriarch Gu was not her biological grandmother, she took Qiao Nian to be her own granddaughter and treated her so well.

Qiao Nian’s thin lips moved slightly. “Grandma.”

She still wanted to thank Matriarch Gu, but the words were stuck in her throat. Her eyes were a little watery as she smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll listen to Grandma. I’ll definitely surpass everyone else in beauty at the lecture. I’ll stun everyone!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she smiled so happily that her eyes curved into crescents.
