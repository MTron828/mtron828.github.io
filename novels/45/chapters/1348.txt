1349 Preparing the Wedding Dress

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she shook her head gently and said, “Grandma, I’m very happy to marry into the Gu family. Don’t say that. You’re flattering me.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Matriarch Gu gently patted Qiao Nian’s hand and said gently, “Child, you only know how to be humble. However, sometimes, it’s not good to be too humble.”

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian smiled helplessly. She was an atheist, so she naturally didn’t believe in God.

“Alright, I have to design a wedding dress for you.” Matriarch Gu really wanted to go to Old Master Gu’s grave and tell him about these good things, but she was afraid that someone with ulterior motives would know that Gu Yue was still alive. “I’ll get back to work.”

Matriarch Gu was very grateful to Qiao Nian for everything she had done. She wanted to make a unique wedding dress for Qiao Nian.

Matriarch Gu left in a hurry. No matter what their wedding date was, the wedding dress had to be prepared early.

Qiao Nian watched Matriarch Gu leave, her lips curving up slightly. Grandma was still swift and decisive.

Ring, ring, ring…

Qiao Nian heard her phone ring. She took it out of her pocket. When she saw that it was Gu Zhou calling, her eyes were filled with smiles.

After she picked up the call, she placed the phone to her ear.

“Hello?”

“Honey.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as low as ever, but his voice was filled with gentleness. It was like a gentle feather brushing across Qiao Nian’s heart.

Qiao Nian smiled and lowered her gaze. The sunlight fell on her face, and she seemed to be enveloped in a golden light. She was so beautiful that it was suffocating.

When Matriarch Gu walked to the second floor, she pulled open the curtains and saw Qiao Nian on the phone. After some thought, she took out her camera and took a photo of Qiao Nian.

She looked at the photo in the camera. Qiao Nian was like a fairy who had descended from the sky. She was so beautiful that one couldn’t take their eyes off her.

An idea flashed across Matriarch Gu’s mind. She knew what kind of wedding dress to prepare for Qiao Nian.

In the pavilion in the garden.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the flower buds not far away. Her eyes were filled with smiles as she asked softly, “What’s wrong?”

“I miss you.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was very soft, but Qiao Nian’s heart seemed to be beating like a huge drum.

She had never expected to hear the words “I miss you” from Gu Zhou’s mouth. Her heart was filled with joy.

The first night she returned, she missed him a little.

“How are you now? Do you feel better?” When Qiao Nian spoke, her voice couldn’t help but soften.

“The doctor said that I’m much better.” Gu Zhou’s voice was as gentle as ever. “My wound healed very quickly. What about you? What are you doing now?”

“I sent the three children to school in the morning and had lunch with Song Yu.” Qiao Nian recalled Song Yu’s words and didn’t tell Gu Zhou about Song Yu’s reminder directly. She didn’t want Gu Zhou to worry about the four of them while he was recuperating. “I just got home and wanted to make some pills later. By the way, how are things on your side?”

“Some people have already begun to relent, but their statements can only prove the fact that Kan Shan has committed a crime. Kan Shan seems to be relenting now. As long as Kan Shan relents, the Interpol will keep an eye on HH Corporation.” Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “Now, we’re just waiting for HH Corporation to be forced into desperation. However, public opinion doesn’t seem to be friendly to HH Corporation. Now, HH Corporation’s shares have been falling again. Fortunately, Mr. Chen has stepped forward to stabilize the shareholders. Cui Huai trusts Mr. Chen even more now.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou say the words “Mr. Chen”, she knew that Gu Zhou was trying to hide his brother’s identity.

Although the two of them were on the phone, Gu Zhou was still in MY. If someone overheard Gu Zhou’s call, Big Brother would be in danger.

She smiled and asked, “Are you coming back after Kan Shan relents?”

Gu Zhou hesitated for a long time before saying, “I want to go back after meeting him.”

She knew in her heart that the “he” Gu Zhou was referring to was Gu Yue, Gu Zhou’s eldest brother.

Qiao Nian frowned tightly and said worriedly, “This is really too dangerous!”
