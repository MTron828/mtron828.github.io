Gu Zhou’s throat tightened, and his voice choked. His hands, which were in his pants, trembled involuntarily, and his eyes turned red.

When Gu Qi heard his mother’s voice, his brow gradually relaxed. His eyelashes trembled as he tried to open his eyes to see his mother’s face clearly. However, his eyelids were too heavy, and he couldn’t open them.

Gu Qi’s heart ached terribly. He really wanted to see his mother’s face clearly. Once again, he spoke.

“Mommy.”

Gu Qi’s eyes were closed, but they were still moist. Tears welled up in his eyes, and a tear fell onto the back of Qiao Nian’s hand. His tears were actually hotter than Gu Qi’s.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi with heartache. She knew that it was wrong of her to impersonate Gu Qi’s mother, but she didn’t want Gu Qi’s beautiful dream to be ruined. She wanted to give Gu Qi some motivation to recover as soon as possible.

Qiao Nian lowered her head slightly and gently planted a kiss on Gu Qi’s forehead. In a gentle voice, she said, “Gu Qi, be good. Don’t cry. Mommy is here. Be good!”

“Gu Qi is very obedient. Gu Qi didn’t cry either. Stay with me, okay?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi with teary eyes, her lips trembling. “Okay.”

Gradually, Gu Qi lost consciousness again and fell into a deep sleep. His small face relaxed, and the corners of his mouth curved up slightly. He looked blissful.

It was as if Gu Qi really thought that his mommy had returned.

Qiao Nian felt her heart ache. The pain was so real that she couldn’t breathe.

Her heart really ached for this child…

After Gu Qi fell into a deep sleep, Qiao Nian carefully placed him on the bed and covered him with the blanket.

Gu Qi left Qiao Nian’s embrace. For a moment, he felt a little uncomfortable. He looked very insecure. His small body kept twisting, as if he was looking for a comfortable and safe sleeping position.

Qiao Nian reached out to hold Gu Qi’s hand and said softly, “Xiao Qi, Mommy is here!”

When Gu Qi heard that gentle voice in his sleep, he finally relaxed and fell asleep in peace.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but sigh.

The moment she thought about how all of this was just a dream to Gu Qi and how he would still be the child who had not found his mommy when he woke up again, her heart could not help but ache.

This was simply too cruel for Gu Qi!

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but grip Gu Qi’s hand tightly, giving him all her love.

“He really likes you. Perhaps subconsciously, he already thinks of you as his mother.”

Gu Zhou, who had been sitting silently at the side, spoke. His voice was very soft, but also very heavy.

Qiao Nian had been paying all her attention to Gu Qi. When she heard his voice, she jumped in fright. Her heart jumped to her throat.

Qiao Nian looked up and inadvertently met Gu Zhou’s dark eyes. His eyes were filled with helplessness.

Qiao Nian sighed softly and gradually retracted her gaze. Her gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face again and she said, “He’s very lonely, and he misses his mother very much!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou recalled the girl who had trembled in his arms that night.

How strange. Why couldn’t he find her?

Gu Zhou stood up and walked up to Qiao Nian. In a commanding tone, he said, “Go and rest first. I’ll watch him!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her gaze fell on Gu Qi’s small hand. Gu Qi’s hand was very warm, and she couldn’t bear to let go. She said softly, “I’m not tired now. I’ll stay with him for a while longer!”

Seeing Qiao Nian’s heartache for Gu Qi, Gu Zhou glanced at Gu Qi’s sleeping face. He opened his mouth slightly, but didn’t say anything else.
