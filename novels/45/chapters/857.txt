858 Self-awareness

Gu Zhou said coldly, “At least you know your limits!”

Song Man was speechless.

Gu Zhou really ended the conversation. He did not give her a chance to speak at all.

At this moment, Qiao Nian had already walked over with the medical kit.

!!

Song Man’s heart began to race.

It was obvious that Gu Zhou had a good impression of Qiao Nian. At this rate, she might not have a chance to marry into the Gu family.

The only thing she could rely on was the two children. As long as the two children were willing to be with her, Qiao Nian would have no chance.

By accident, Xiao Shi actually liked Qiao Nian a lot. This was something she hadn’t expected.

If she continued to be reserved and did not take the initiative, she might lose Gu Zhou forever.

At the thought of this, Song Man sighed deeply and said, “I really didn’t expect it to have been more than five years. No, it should be said that almost six years have passed. What happened that night is still vivid in my mind!”

Seeing that Gu Zhou was unmoved, Song Man continued, “Although I can let Xiao Shi grow up in a relaxed and happy environment alone, it’s still a little tiring. Xiao Shi often clamored to see her brother and her father. Her greatest wish is to be able to reunite with her father. I hope the family can live together!”

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. He could naturally tell what Song Man was saying. He hated such people the most, so he said, “If you think it’s hard on you, just leave the child to me. You won’t have to work hard in the future!”

Song Man was about to vomit blood!

Gu Zhou’s way of thinking seemed to be different from ordinary people.

Her main point was clearly that she hoped that the family could be together. It was not that it was hard on her.

“I’m saying that Xiao Shi hopes that our family can…”

“Nian’er, have you found the syringe?” Gu Zhou interrupted Song Man mercilessly.

Previously, he had thought that Song Man might be the girl from five years ago, but now that he heard Song Man’s words, he was completely certain that Song Man was not that girl at all.

Although he had not interacted much with that girl five years ago, he could sense that she was a very kind girl.

Song Man was full of schemes.

Perhaps others didn’t understand such things, but he had experienced it himself. He had also come into contact with that girl.

That was why he was certain that Song Man was not Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s mother.

After searching for a while, Qiao Nian finally found a syringe. She looked at Gu Zhou and nodded. “I’ve already found it!”

Gu Zhou said calmly, “Go and draw Miss Song’s blood!”

Song Man’s face suddenly turned pale. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. She had never expected Gu Zhou to be so wary of her.

She believed that there was nothing wrong with her blood, but she still couldn’t accept Gu Zhou’s attitude towards her.

She asked sadly, “Why do you have to do that?”

Actually, Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to want to investigate Song Man and the two children’s genes so openly. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, since Gu Zhou had said so, she naturally had to do as he said. Qiao Nian walked up to Song Man and raised her eyebrows slightly. Smiling, she said, “Miss Song, please pull up your sleeve. I’ll draw a little blood. It won’t hurt much. Please cooperate!”

Although Song Man believed that she was the mother of two children, Gu Zhou’s actions made her a little disappointed. She looked at Gu Zhou with teary eyes and asked, “Are you suspecting me?”

“Wasn’t what I did obvious enough? I believe you’re definitely not the mother of the two children. They’re not that stupid!” Gu Zhou said lightly.

At this moment, Song Man’s chest ached from the rebuttal. She could not say a word.

For the first time, Qiao Nian realized that Gu Zhou was so eloquent. She couldn’t help but want to laugh.

To be honest, Gu Zhou was simply a straightforward man.

“Gu Zhou, how can you do this to me? No matter what, we had a one-night stand. I risked my life to give birth to your child, and all these years, I had to endure the pain of being separated from you. I worked hard to raise her alone. It wasn’t easy for me. If the child hadn’t motivated me to survive, I would have…”
