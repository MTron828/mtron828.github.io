Chapter 184: Clear My Name

Qiao Shan paused and turned to look at Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin was crying so hard that her whole body shook. Qiao Shan’s heart ached as if it had been pricked by a thousand needles. He looked at Su Xue in rage, his hand trembling as he pointed at her. “Look at what you’ve done!”

Seeing Qiao Xin cry so hard, Su Xue’s heart ached for her. She, too, cried until she was out of breath.

The more Qiao Shan thought about it, the angrier he became. He shouted angrily, “You’ve done such a humiliating thing. Our children are already grown. Now that the matter has been exposed, this child is still pleading for you. Do you mean to force Qiao Xin and Qiao Yu to keep their heads lowered in public for the rest of their lives?”

Su Xue sobbed. A trace of determination flashed across her face as she wiped her tears away. She couldn’t open her swollen, bruised eyes. Turning to glance at Qiu Nan, who was not far away, she said awkwardly, “Hubby, I know my mistake now. Please forgive me. I won’t do anything like this again. This is all Qiu Nan’s fault. It has nothing to do with me. Now, we have to think about how to keep this matter a secret. If word of this gets out, the Qiao family will be finished!”

Su Xue’s mind raced. Suddenly, her eyes lit up. She pointed at Qiu Nan and said loudly, “Hubby, I’ve thought of something. Let’s hurry up and send him to prison. That way, no one will know about this!”

Qiu Nan looked at Su Xue in shock and said angrily, “Su Xue?!”

Qiao Shan stood there with a dark expression. He did not speak. In his heart, he was wondering if this course of action was feasible.

Seeing Qiao Shan’s hesitation, Qiao Xin hurriedly said, “This man is a scourge on society. If it weren’t for him, Mom wouldn’t have become like this. Let’s send him to prison, quickly. As long as he stays in prison, our Qiao family will be at peace!”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s words, she sneered.

“Heh!”

This family was truly shameless to the extreme.

Only when Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s voice did she notice her presence. Her heart skipped a beat, and she grew so nervous that her heart jumped to her throat.

She had been with Qiu Nan for more than a year, but she had never let any hint of their relationship slip. Yet, she had actually been caught this time.

Moreover, she remembered being very confused when she had arrived. How had Qiu Nan afforded such an expensive room?

Su Xue recalled how Qiu Nan had hugged her when she arrived, pressing her against the door and kissing her wildly.

Before long, Qiu Nan carried her to the bed and the two of them began to make love.

Therefore, she had been wholly immersed in the romantic surprise and had not noticed the danger at all.

Now that she thought about it, it seemed like someone had deliberately planned all of this. They had deliberately gotten Qiao Shan to come and catch them in the act. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian!

It had to be Qiao Nian!

Su Xue finally came back to her senses. She jumped up from the ground and pointed at Qiao Nian’s face, scolding angrily, “You did this!”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Xue’s words, her lips curved into a faint smile. She leaned against the wine cabinet and said lazily, “Looks like you’re not that stupid after all.”

Su Xue’s eyes widened. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to admit it so bluntly. Her face flushed red with anger as she scolded, “B*tch, I’ve raised you for so many years for nothing. How dare you treat me like this? Do you still have a conscience? I’m your… Ah!!”

Qiao Nian walked up to Su Xue. Just as Su Xue was about to say the last few words, Qiao Nian gave Su Xue a vicious slap. That slap was enough to cut off whatever Su Xue was about to say. The words remained lodged in her throat.

“You’re not worthy!”

Qiao Nian’s hand ached terribly. This slap had taken all her strength.

Su Xue’s face was swollen. She collapsed onto the bed, unable to get up for a long time.

Qiu Nan, who had been curled up at the side, was stunned.

He had not expected the daughter to hit her mother in public. This was the first time he had seen such a thing.

It seemed that Qiao Nian was not one to be trifled with.
