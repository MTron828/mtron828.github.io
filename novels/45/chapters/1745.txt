Chapter 1746 - 1746 Change

The president brought his men straight back to the palace, leaving only a portion of them to protect Lina.

Qiao Nian walked to Lina’s side and looked at the wound on her hand. She asked worriedly, “I’ll get Dr. Ollie to prescribe you some painkillers. That way, it won’t hurt anymore.”

Lina’s heart beat violently, and her eyes turned red uncontrollably. She forced a smile and shook her head gently. “Nian Nian, don’t trouble yourself. Actually, I’m already much better after applying your medicine.”

The wound was painful, but this pain could be endured. Moreover, this pain could not compare to the pain in her heart.

“Lina, thank you so much.” Qiao Nian looked at Lina intently. If it wasn’t for the fact that she had to cooperate with her plan so the president could continue to deal with Mark, there was no need to let the cat out of the bag so quickly and Lina could also leave Wright’s clutches. “Thank you for believing me. If it weren’t for the fact that you believe me, the president might not have agreed to our plan.”

“Nian Nian, we’re good friends. Don’t explain so much,” Lina said sincerely. If not for Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou, her mother might have been killed by Mark long ago. “Actually, this matter is also beneficial to us.”

Qiao Nian smiled and looked at Lina’s face. She paused for a moment before saying, “Lina, we haven’t seen each other for a few days. You seem to have changed.”

When Via, who was packing the first aid kit, heard Qiao Nian’s words, she said softly, “The Seventh Princess is very similar to Miss Qiao in some aspects.”

Via’s words were like a bucket of cold water that poured over Chen Qing’s head. He sobered up.

He looked up at Lina, who was not far away, with a hint of sadness in his eyes. He felt that Lina had become strange recently, and now he finally understood.

Lina no longer acted according to her original thoughts. Her tone was like Young Madam’s, and her eyes were like Young Madam’s.

When Lina heard Via’s words, she smiled and said, “I just want to be like Nian Nian. No matter how dangerous it is, she can remain calm and solve everything well.”

If she had half of Qiao Nian’s ability, she would have been able to help her father regain his power from Mark long ago.

Qiao Nian’s eyes darkened slightly. She looked at Lina with heartache and held Lina’s uninjured hand tightly. She said in a low voice, “Lina, you were good from the beginning. You’re unique. Only by being unique will you shine.”

How could it be called growth when one person became another?

Lina didn’t care about what Qiao Nian said at all, because if she had had the ability earlier, she could have solved many problems. She only hated herself for not meeting Qiao Nian sooner.

“I can’t believe the two of you are still wearing your previous clothes. Take a break. I’ll arrange something else and go back later,” Lina said and left with Via.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou looked at each other. They could see the fatigue in each other’s eyes. The two of them had been working non-stop. Even if their bodies were made of iron, they wouldn’t be able to take it.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Gu Zhou said, “We do need to rest well. It’s going to be a tough battle.”

Qiao Nian sat beside Gu Zhou and leaned her head gently on his shoulder. As she watched Lina leave, she looked up at Chen Qing. “Are you alright?”

Chen Qing had already applied the medicine and said, “I’m fine.”

Gu Zhou looked up at Chen Qing. His dark and impure eyes looked at Chen Qing, and the corners of his lips curled up slightly. He asked with interest, “Were Wright’s injuries your doing?”

Only then did Qiao Nian remember what Wright looked like. Wright was covered in blood. She looked at Chen Qing intently, her eyes filled with smiles. “Impressive.”

Chen Qing looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s eyes and hurriedly avoided their probing gazes. If he said more, they would definitely get to the bottom of it. “I-I’ll go take a shower first. Have a good rest.”

With that, Chen Qing turned around and left.
