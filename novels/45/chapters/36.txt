Chapter 37: Refutation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The mental hospital?

The onlookers were stunned.

Even Matriarch Gu was stunned. She would never believe that her darling child had come out of a mental hospital. She quickly said, “Miss Shen, you’re clearly in the wrong, yet you still want to drag my granddaughter-in-law into this. When we arrived, Qiao Nian wasn’t even here!”

As soon as Matriarch Gu said this, the people who had suspected that Qiao Nian was the culprit instantly fell silent. Indeed, they hadn’t seen Qiao Nian.

“No, it’s not like that at all!” Shen Xing screamed like a shrew, her hair disheveled. “Qiao Nian drugged me. She’s the one who caused me to end up like this!”

Glaring daggers at Qiao Nian, Shen Xing roared hysterically, “You’re a lunatic. You killed your good friend Li Chun and caused my sister to disappear off the face of the earth. Now, you’re even trying to harm me! You’re a demon from hell. You deserve to die and go to the eighteenth level of hell!”

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian doubtfully, narrowing their eyes. Qiao Nian looked like a fairy maiden, innocent and gentle. At the thought that she could have killed someone in the past, they couldn’t help but take a step back in fear.

Li Chun was dead?

Qiao Nian’s face was expressionless, but her heart was already surging with emotions. She had never managed to find Li Chun. Why did Shen Xing say that Li Chun was dead?

Qiao Nian walked gracefully to Shen Xing. Her gaze finally landed on the adulterer. She asked curiously, “Miss Shen, who is this person?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s voice, everyone’s gaze landed on the adulterer. Previously, they had only wanted to watch the show, and had completely forgotten about the adulterer.

“Isn’t he the Shen family’s gardener?” A socialite who was not on good terms with Shen Xing said bluntly.

“Oh, I see. So he’s the gardener of the Shen family,” Qiao Nian said casually, her beautiful eyes shining with a strange light. There was an aura of power around her. “This is my first time coming to the Shen family. How did I collude with the gardener of the Shen family and let him ruin Miss Shen’s innocence?”

She was clearly only a young lady in her twenties, but her aura was not in any way weaker than that of Shen Ming, who had been in the business world for thirty years.

Qiao Nian’s casual words easily extricated herself from Shen Xing’s accusations. There wasn’t a single person present who didn’t admire Qiao Nian.

Seeing the challenge in Qiao Nian’s eyes, Shen Ming walked in front of her and questioned, “Aren’t you a sharp-tongued girl? You’ve been plotting behind our backs—there’s no way you would admit to your deeds out loud!”

Qiao Nian hadn’t wanted to continue pursuing the matter, but after hearing Shen Ming’s words, she knew that Shen Ming was trying to smear her reputation on purpose.

Her beautiful eyes narrowed slightly as she raised her brows and retorted, “You’re spouting nonsense without any evidence. Shen Xing, let me ask you. When did I drug you?”

Before Shen Xing could speak, Qiao Nian continued, “I didn’t speak to you the entire night. How could you have fallen into my trap?”

At this moment, a man hurried over from afar. It was none other than Shen Mo.

Shen Mo had been helping Qiao Nian investigate Shen Yue’s whereabouts. When he sneaked out of Shen Ming’s office, he saw that there was no one left in the hall.

Shen Mo took out his phone and saw that the WeChat group chat was already in an uproar. He could hear Shen Xing accusing Qiao Nian from afar. He could not help but frown.

Shen Mo walked up to Qiao Nian and shielded her behind him. He said, “Uncle, Miss Qiao is not that kind of person!”

With the appearance of Shen Mo, those who initially believed in Qiao Nian’s innocence began to doubt her as well. Qiao Nian had said that she wasn’t familiar with the Shen family. Wasn’t this a direct contradiction?

Shen Ming was already very angry. He looked at Shen Mo with a surly expression and raised his hand to slap Shen Mo. However, Shen Mo dodged the blow.

“Uncle, let’s call the police!” Shen Mo said without changing his expression. He had faith that Qiao Nian was not that kind of person.

Shen Ming found himself at a disadvantage. Even though Shen Xing’s reputation had been completely ruined, he was still worried that the Shen family’s reputation would be ruined as well. He shouted sternly, “Shen Mo, how dare you help an outsider! Get out of my way! I’m going to make this vicious girl suffer the consequences of her own actions!”

“Mr. Shen sure is arrogant!”

Gu Zhou’s deep voice resounded from the back of the crowd, his voice rising slightly.

Upon hearing his voice, everyone was stunned for a moment. They turned their heads and looked over. Most people did not recognize Gu Zhou and began whispering to one another.

Gu Zhou had a hand in his pocket. With two bodyguards behind him, he walked elegantly from the crowd to Shen Ming.

There was a faint coldness at the corner of his lips and his eyes were slightly narrowed. He had a natural sense of alienation and indifference, and his entire body emitted a cold aura.

When Shen Ming saw Gu Zhou, a trace of astonishment flashed across his face. Frowning, he silently took a step back.

Su Yan had coincidentally seen a photograph of Gu Zhou in the past.. Seeing Gu Zhou approach, he knew that this farce would definitely end with the defeat of the Shen family.
