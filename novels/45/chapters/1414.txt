Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing and asked, “Is Qi Qi in Qin Chuan’s room?”

“Yes, clueless Young Madam.” Chen Qing hesitated for a moment before saying, “The two of them are having breakfast inside.”

“Let’s go over!” Qiao Nian said.

The group walked towards Qin Chuan’s ward. When they reached the door of Qin Chuan’s ward, Chen Qing said, “Mr. Qin, Second Young Master, Second Young Madam, and Miss Song have come to visit you.”

When Lu Qi heard Chen Qing’s voice again, she suddenly came back to her senses. Only then did she notice that Qin Chuan’s left hand was holding her right hand. She hurriedly retracted her hand and stood up awkwardly. Her red face gave off a feeling that she was trying to hide something.

Qin Chuan was as calm as ever. He looked at Lu Qi gently, then his gaze landed on the door.

Chen Qing opened the door and everyone walked into Qin Chuan’s ward.

When Lu Qi saw who it was, she placed her hands behind her back and greeted uncomfortably, “Sister, Sister Song Yu, and Brother-in-law.”

Gu Zhou nodded lightly and naturally walked to the sofa to sit down.

Qiao Nian and Song Yu walked over to Lu Qi. Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi worriedly and asked, “There was something wrong with your voice just now. Are you feeling unwell?”

Song Yu placed the back of her hand on Lu Qi’s forehead and frowned slightly. “It seems to be a little hot. Do you have a fever? How about this? I’ll call the doctor over.”

When Lu Qi heard this, she hurriedly grabbed Song Yu’s arm and said in a low voice, “Sister Song Yu, I’m really fine. I’ll be fine in a while. I might have just eaten some porridge. That’s why I’m a little hot.”

Hearing Lu Qi’s stumbling words, Qiao Nian turned to look at Qin Chuan and narrowed her eyes. Could it be that Qin Chuan…

Qin Chuan didn’t avoid Qiao Nian’s gaze. His lips curved up slightly as he smiled at Qiao Nian, looking happy.

Qiao Nian had been worried that Qin Chuan would bully Lu Qi, but Lu Qi wasn’t a fool. If Qin Chuan really bullied Lu Qi, Lu Qi would definitely tell her.

Qiao Nian had just retracted her gaze when she noticed Lu Qi stealing a glance at Qin Chuan. Lu Qi was still looking down shyly.

“We’ve also brought soup for you. It happens to be pork ribs soup. You should drink some too!” As Qiao Nian spoke, she placed the food on the coffee table. Seeing that Song Yu seemed to be about to leave, she said, “Song Yu, you have a share too.”

“Thank you, Sister,” Song Yu agreed calmly. She said, “There’s also food I bought in Qi Qi’s room. I can bring it over to eat with you.”

With great foresight, Chen Qing brought all the food on the bed to the coffee table beside the sofa.

Qin Chuan sat between Gu Zhou and Chen Qing, and Lu Qi sat between Qiao Nian and Song Yu.

Gu Zhou turned to look at Qin Chuan and asked worriedly, “How do you feel?”

Qin Chuan’s beautiful phoenix-like eyes raised slightly as he said, “Don’t worry, I’m fine. Someone like me will definitely live to a hundred years old.”

When Lu Qi, who was sitting opposite Qin Chuan, heard his words, she subconsciously looked up and inadvertently met his eyes. Her face turned red uncontrollably, and she lowered her head silently.

Qiao Nian took in all the interactions between Qin Chuan and Lu Qi. She lowered her head thoughtfully and ate.

Gu Zhou nodded slightly, his obsidian-like eyes filled with seriousness. With a serious expression, he said, “We’ve already found out that the Europeans were behind the tunnel explosion. Their goal is also very clear. They want to target the Lu family directly.”

Qin Chuan looked at Gu Zhou beside him. Chen Qing had also told him what he had found out. He looked up at Lu Qi. In the entire Lu family, Lu Qi was the weakest.

Back then, those people had kidnapped Nian Nian. Now, they had chosen Lu Qi. It seemed that those people specialized in picking on the weak.

Qin Chuan narrowed his phoenix-like eyes, his expression becoming more and more serious. He tightened his grip on his chopsticks. Those people were going to die. With him around, he wanted to see who could hurt Qi Qi.

When Song Yu heard their words, her mind was in a mess. From what Song Xue said, Song Xue’s family was also involved in this matter. Why did they say that the Europeans were also involved?FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
