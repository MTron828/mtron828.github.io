Chapter 1796 - 1796 Father

After Qiao Nian fed Chen Qing the life-saving medicine, she looked at Gu Zhou, who was not far away. The two of them looked at each other and smiled.

At first, Qiao Nian couldn’t be sure who would win this battle, so she didn’t let Dr. Ollie and Cui Qi come out.

If Cui Qi had appeared at the beginning and Mark stopped rebelling, the president would not have been able to get evidence of Mark’s rebellion.

Therefore, she first got Dr. Ollie to give Cui Qi a coma medicine and asked Dr. Ollie to keep watch over Cui Qi.

Cui Qi opened his eyes sleepily and saw many guards lying on the ground in front of him. There were also some people in suits, all holding guns.

What was going on?

Cui Qi frowned slightly. His gaze landed on Gu Zhou and the president’s faces, and a trace of confusion flashed across his eyes. Then, his gaze landed on the face that often appeared in his memories.

There were already many wrinkles on his face, and he looked much older than before.

Cui Qi looked at the face in disbelief. He blinked and slowly stood up from the wheelchair.

That face was so familiar. That person’s aura was exactly the same as his father’s.

“Father?” Cui Qi called out in a low voice. He took a slow step forward and could not help but stop, worried that all of this was just a dream.

Cui Si looked at Cui Qi and pursed his lips tightly. He looked at Cui Qi intently.

Cui Qi was a general of Europe, so Cui Si often saw Cui Qi’s appearance in other reports. Therefore, he knew that the person in front of him was his youngest son.

But his youngest son was clearly dead.

However, Cui Qi’s revival was a huge surprise to Cui Si.

Seeing this, Chen Sheng had already retracted the knife in his hand.

Cui Qi staggered towards Cui Si. He did not know what was going on and did not have time to understand this. He just wanted to confirm personally if this was a dream and if that person was his father.

At this moment, Mark’s voice resounded throughout the hall not far away. “Shoot!”

Everyone’s gaze fell on Mark, who immediately said, “Cui Si is my man. I order you now to kill the president and Cui Qi, who has long betrayed us. Those who shoot will be heavily rewarded!”

Hearing Mark’s voice, Cui Qi stopped in his tracks. He looked over and his expression instantly darkened. He said angrily, “Mark, you still have the cheek to spout nonsense. Back then, you were the one who deliberately framed the Cui family. I even found out that you got someone to pretend to be the president who had already gone overseas to kill my brother. Even now, you’re still twisting the truth and trying to sow discord between the Cui family and the president!”

Cui Qi’s eyes turned red. After he was shot by the Third Princess, he pretended to be dead and secretly investigated what had happened back then.

He had trusted Mark unconditionally in the past, so he had never thought of investigating what had happened back then. Now that he investigated carefully, he realized that there were many strange things about what had happened back then.

Cui Qi clenched his fists tightly. Knowing the truth, he wished he could cut Mark into pieces.

Mark’s expression changed when he heard Cui Qi’s words.

At that time in court, Cui Qi had clearly lost so much blood and would definitely not come back alive. He did not expect Cui Qi to still be alive and appear in front of him.

Mark looked at the people with guns below. They were all Cui Si’s men and only listened to him.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

If Cui Si knew the truth, wouldn’t he take revenge on him directly?

With this thought in mind, Mark subconsciously looked at Cui Si, who was not far away, and saw him standing there with a dark expression.

“Shoot him. Hurry up and kill the president. This is your mission today!” Mark shouted hysterically and struggled wildly. The long knife cut through his collar.

Chang Feng’s expression darkened slightly as he stood beside Mark. He held a long needle in his hand and stabbed Mark’s mute acupuncture point without hesitation. Mark instantly lost his voice.

Cui Si stood rooted to the ground in a daze. When he heard Cui Qi’s words, his eyes were filled with surprise. Then, he walked up to Cui Qi and looked at his face intently. His voice trembled as he said, “Qi’er?”
