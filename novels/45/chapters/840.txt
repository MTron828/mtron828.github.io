841 Violence?

Gu Zhou recalled how obedient and adorable Xiao Shi had been. He still remembered asking him to tutor her. She clearly knew everything, but she pretended not to know anything.

This was how she got close to him.

Gu Zhou’s heart gradually softened. His frown slowly relaxed, and his voice softened. “Yes.”

Just this word alone showed Gu Zhou’s happy mood.

!!

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou was unhappy because Xiao Shi was neglected as a child. She heaved a sigh of relief. Now, she felt that the harm Gu Zhou had suffered in his childhood was very likely to be healed by the two children.

Gu Zhou continued, “In the afternoon, I’ll get a lawyer to draft a document for you to get back the custody rights. When the time comes, I’ll give Song Man some compensation.”

Qiao Nian nodded. This would do.

Gu Zhou took the paternity test report from Qiao Nian.

He read it very carefully, not missing a single detail from the first page. As if he had thought of something, he looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “Are you sure this is Song Man and Xiao Shi’s DNA test?”

“Yes!” Qiao Nian nodded and said, “When I first saw Xiao Shi, I asked Xiao Qi to do an appraisal to prove that the two of them are indeed biological siblings. Moreover, this sample isn’t exactly the same as Xiao Shi’s, so it should be Song Man’s!”

“How did you get Song Man’s DNA?” Gu Zhou asked curiously.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and said, “When Song Man was angry, she seemed to have broken many things. There was still her blood on the porcelain pieces of the vase.”

“Break something?” When Gu Zhou heard this, he frowned.

A mature and stable adult shouldn’t lose his temper casually. Even if he was angry, he wouldn’t smash things directly.

Would someone who threw a tantrum and smashed things have a tendency to domestic violence?

Unexpectedly, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but worry about Xiao Shi.

If she had been by Song Man’s side for the past five years, had she been beaten up? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qiao Nian didn’t know what Gu Zhou was thinking. She nodded and agreed. “Yes, I had an argument with her yesterday, so she was very unhappy.”

At the mention of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. She continued, “Let me tell you, Xiao Qi called me Mommy!”

Gu Zhou seemed to be infected by Qiao Nian’s happy mood. There was a smile in his eyes. “He likes you a lot to begin with!”

“I’m very surprised.” In her joy, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but say a few more words.

To be honest, Qiao Nian really hadn’t expected Gu Qi to be willing to let her be his mother after seeing his biological mother.

This was because some children were willing to be with their biological mothers no matter how badly their biological mothers treated them. This was because they were blood-related.

“That’s because you’re good!” Gu Zhou said calmly. His gaze fell on the DNA report again.

Qiao Nian smiled and didn’t speak.

After Gu Zhou finished reading the DNA report, he looked at Qiao Nian and said, “She’s not their mother!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Gu Zhou in surprise and asked, “This is their paternity test report. How can you say that she’s not their mother?”

“Although I was drugged that day, I clearly remember that girl having all four limbs.”

Qiao Nian frowned and said, “Perhaps you remembered wrongly?”

“If you told me that there was something wrong with one of her eyes or ears, I think I might have remembered wrongly. If she was really disabled, I should have noticed it that night.” At this point, Gu Zhou’s expression turned even more serious. “Even if she’s not the girl from five years ago, she’s more or less related to that girl.”

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “As long as we follow her lead, we might be able to find clues about that girl.”

In the past, Gu Zhou would definitely be worried that Qiao Nian would leave because of the appearance of the biological mother of the two children. But now, he was no longer afraid.

But now, he knew very well that no matter who the mother of the two children was, Qiao Nian would never leave him.
