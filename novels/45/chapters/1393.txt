1394 Qi Qi

Qin Chuan had just seen the girl he was desperately protecting in the car. The girl was also wearing a white down jacket.

He looked at the white down jacket, his heart racing.

He didn’t know why he had such a strange feeling.

Doctor Lin was about to leave when he thought of Lu Qi next door. He reminded her, “Miss Qiao, I’m preparing to prescribe some more medicine for Miss Lu. I need to sign it. Come to my office later.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Okay.”

Before Doctor Lin left, he didn’t forget to close the door.

Qin Chuan naturally understood what Doctor Lin meant. His gaze landed on Song Yu’s face and he asked, “Are you feeling unwell?”

Song Yu met Qin Chuan’s concerned gaze, and a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She said, “Mr. Qin, I’m not feeling unwell.”

Qiao Nian glanced at Song Yu and recalled that she had told Qin Chuan that Song Yu was the precious daughter of the Lu family. She explained, “Senior, the Miss Lu the doctor was talking about just now is the seventh daughter of the Lu family, Lu Qi, from the ward next door.”

Qin Chuan lowered his gaze and repeated “Lu Qi” in a low voice.

Just by thinking Lu Qi’s name, his heart began to race, as if his heart would jump out of his throat in the next moment.

Qin Chuan felt his breathing tighten. The image of the young lady covering her ears helplessly and wearing a white down jacket flashed across his mind.

Seeing Qin Chuan’s strange expression, Song Yu wanted to tell Qiao Nian something, but she didn’t know what to say.

“Who was the person trapped in the tunnel with me?” Qin Chuan asked, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian’s fox-like eyes, which seemed to be able to see through people’s hearts, narrowed slightly. She said slowly, “The person trapped in the tunnel with you is Lu Qi.”

Qin Chuan pursed his lips tightly. The memory fragment in his mind just now was that the person he had risked his life to save in the tunnel. That was Lu Qi!

Hence, he liked Lu Qi.

No wonder his heart was beating wildly when he saw the white down jacket, but when he saw Song Yu’s face, he calmed down.

Regardless of whether he had memories or not, his heart would always race when it came to the person he liked.

After Qin Chuan came back to his senses, his eyes were filled with worry. He asked, “How… how is she now?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Chuan’s worried gaze and recalled that if Qin Chuan hadn’t saved Lu Qi, they might not have been able to see her. She said gratefully, “Senior Brother, it’s all thanks to you for protecting Qi Qi. She wasn’t injured, but she was shocked. We wanted her to be hospitalized.”

When Qin Chuan heard Qiao Nian’s words, his tense heart slowly relaxed. He seemed to have thought of something and looked up at Qiao Nian. Once again, he asked seriously, “Can you take me over to see her?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned when she met Qin Chuan’s sparkling eyes.

Lu Qi had just fainted. If they went over, would they wake her up?

She was about to refuse, but when Qiao Nian saw the light in Qin Chuan’s eyes, she couldn’t bear to refuse. She hesitated for a moment. “Alright!”

When Song Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes were filled with disapproval. Instinctively, she wanted to protect Lu Qi. Lu Qi needed to rest well now. She couldn’t help but say, “Mr. Qin, your body is very weak now. You should rest well. Qi Qi has been guarding your bed. She couldn’t take it anymore, so she went back to rest. Let her rest for a while more!”

Qin Chuan was about to get up, but when he heard Song Yu’s words, his heart jumped to his throat. He looked at Song Yu impatiently and asked, “Has she been guarding me?”

Qiao Nian looked at Song Yu. Song Yu still seemed to be very concerned about Lu Qi. She said, “Previously, you were seriously injured in order to save her. Qi Qi has always been very grateful to you and blames herself. She stayed by your side. Later on, she fainted, so I sent her back to rest.”

Qiao Nian had never expected Qin Chuan to wake up as soon as Qi Qi fainted.

Qin Chuan sat there with his head lowered. It was as if two despicable people were arguing in his mind.

The little person on the left: Go and see her. I can only be at ease if I see with my own eyes that she’s fine.

The little person on the right: I can’t visit her. If I do, I’ll wake her up. She won’t be able to rest well. It’s not good for her health.
