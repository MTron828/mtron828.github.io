Chapter 1745 - 1745 Important Person

When the President heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “It’s Mark’s lover, Song Ling. However, I only found a little information about her.”

“I originally thought that Mark only used Song Ling as his lover, but that night, I noticed that Mark really seemed to care about her. He cared about her far more than he cared about Wright.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “She’s not from Europe, but An City. Logically speaking, her identity should be easy to investigate, but we haven’t found much about her in the country. She’s been with Mark for so many years. There’s definitely something wrong.”

Seeing that the President was a little puzzled, Qiao Nian continued, “If there’s nothing wrong with Song Ling, she won’t think of any way to hide her biological information and DNA.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, she frowned and asked in confusion, “Nian Nian, what do you mean?”

Qiao Nian told the president and Lina about the abnormal DNA in Song Ling’s hair.

The president reacted quickly and said, “Song Ling deliberately didn’t want anyone to find out about her.”

“Yes, I suspect that she might have done more. In order to hide her identity, she hid her DNA.” Qiao Nian knew that she still knew nothing about Song Ling. “But I’m sure that Song Ling lives in the basement. I want to stay in Mark’s manor with Lina. When that time comes, I can catch her.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, she immediately reacted and hurriedly said, “That’s why you want me to stay in Mark’s manor.”

“Yes, Mark lost the gold rooms. He cares about Song Ling the most now. I want to kidnap Song Ling. When that time comes, Mark will panic.” Qiao Nian nodded seriously and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t let you face danger. I’ll accompany you. Chen Qing is also here. Don’t worry.”

Moreover, Wright, who was the greatest threat to Lina, had already been locked up by the president. No one should be threatening Lina anymore.

When the President heard Qiao Nian’s words, he knew that Qiao Nian’s plan could allow him to obtain the control of the entire country as soon as possible. However, if he did as Qiao Nian said, he could not bring up the matter of breaking the engagement.

His daughter had been injured by Wright. This could be regarded as domestic violence. At that time, even if Mark said anything, as long as his attitude was firm, he could let Lina leave Wright’s clutches.

The key person in this matter was Lina. However, Lina was like an outsider. She did not seem to be sad or afraid at all. One had to know that she was a little sad before her engagement.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

But now, a bright smile appeared on Lina’s face and she said happily, “Dad, don’t worry. Actually, I’ve already planned to marry Wright before, and I’ve never thought of breaking the engagement. When Dad gets what he wants, I’ll leave.”

The President looked at Lina’s face and felt extremely sad.

“Dad, the sooner I settle everything, the sooner I can go home, right?” After Lina finished speaking, she saw that the President was still very sad. “Dad, actually, I’ve thought about marrying Wright. From another perspective, I can balance your relationship.”

Lina didn’t even dare to look at Chen Qing when she said these words. She was afraid that if she looked at Chen Qing, she wouldn’t have the courage to marry Wright, because he was the person she loved the most.

After everyone had formulated their plans, Qiao Nian and Lina stayed in Mark’s manor.

The president was worried that an accident might happen. He gave a walkie-talkie and firework signal to Lina and Qiao Nian, thinking that they could use these things to contact his people.

As for him, he planned to stay in the villa and let the army guard Mark’s manor.

The President also got someone to strictly check the customs to prevent Song Ling from leaving the country.
