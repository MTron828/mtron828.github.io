Chapter 1785 - 1785 Ignorant

Mark’s gaze fell on the diamond ring at his feet. He bent down and picked it up. He stared carefully at the diamond ring in his hand and said word by word, “This diamond ring is the last work of the famous jewelry designer, Bella, before she died. The diamond on it is also the best quality diamond ring.”

He looked up at the President standing not far away, his eyes filled with anger. He held the diamond ring tightly in his palm and gritted his teeth as he looked at the President not far away. “I got someone to forge this diamond ring when Annie was 18 years old. I thought that she could use it when she got married. But now, my daughter was ruined by you!”

The president’s eyes narrowed slightly as he saw the anger in Mark’s eyes. The last time he was in court, Mark didn’t even look at Annie and it was as if he didn’t care.

It seemed that he was suppressing his anger at that time. Mark just didn’t show it.

It was not easy for his brother to be angry. He always thought that his brother was heartless.

Mark looked viciously at Lina, who was standing on the stage, and a cold smile appeared on his face. “I mercifully gave you this diamond ring as a wedding gift, but you still dare to not want it now. You simply don’t know what’s good for you!”

Lina met Mark’s openly angry eyes and tried her best to control the trembling of her body. Although she didn’t understand why Nian Nian didn’t allow her to wear the ring, she believed in Nian Nian. Nian Nian would never harm her.

Lina took a deep breath. She was the princess of Europe. She had to maintain her composure now and try her best to suppress the fear in her heart. She could not fumble the ball.

She had done a lot of mental preparation. Now, not only did she have her father, but she also had Nian Nian and Chen Qing by her side. She shouldn’t be afraid. She should be brave and express her thoughts.

“I don’t care about this lousy ring at all…”

Before Lina could finish speaking, Qiao Nian immediately pulled Lina behind her and stood in front of her to protect her.

Qiao Nian’s exquisite and beautiful face turned cold. She narrowed her eyes dangerously and questioned Mark, “There are many people in the hall today. These people are your people who were transferred here because you wanted to force the president into a corner. You’re just waiting for Lina to put on the ring!”

Qiao Nian smiled coldly and said, “If I’m not wrong, wearing the ring is part of your order.”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just now, those people were all staring at the ring. Qiao Nian could see it clearly. They were all waiting for the order to act!

When Mark heard Qiao Nian’s words, his expression darkened slightly. Having a smart opponent was really a headache. He looked at Qiao Nian in front of him and said sarcastically, “So what if you know all of this? What can you change?”

Mark looked at the president beside him, as if he could already see the president kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy to give up the throne. He said, “You should see your situation clearly. You can’t escape now.”

To Mark, the order to wear the ring was to take action when no one on the president’s side noticed. Since this order had already been interrupted by Qiao Nian, there was nothing to be afraid of. He was the commander-in-chief of those people. As long as he asked, those people would act obediently.

Mark looked at the president standing not far away with a cold smile in his eyes. His voice was deep and resounded throughout the hall.

“Attack. I want the President and the Seventh Princess alive. As for the others, kill them all!”

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou exchanged glances. The President listened to Mark and looked at Gu Zhou beside him.

For the president, what he wanted was for Mark to personally give the order. This way, he could directly confirm that Mark was planning a rebellion. When he caught Mark, he could bring him to justice.

Gu Zhou nodded. When he came in, he had installed a miniature camera and recording equipment on his collar clip to catch Mark.

Of course, this video would be sent directly to his email after Gu Zhou pressed the save button.

Gu Zhou gestured to Qiao Nian and the President, indicating that the video had been saved and sent. Everything was fine.
