Chapter 146 Calm

Qiao Nian wasn’t too concerned about the speech she would have to give in a few days. She spent most of her time in the garden with her plants. Occasionally, she would go to the research institute to teach Lin Tao how to cultivate plants and conduct experiments.

Qiao Nian stood at the side. Under her guidance, Lin Tao had already transplanted a potted plant. Lin Tao’s face was now speckled with dirt.

After washing her face, Lin Tao smiled at Qiao Nian and asked curiously, “You have a speech tomorrow. Are you nervous?”

Qiao Nian jotted down some data in her notebook, then closed it and looked up at Lin Tao. “What’s there to be nervous about? I’m just going to give them some tips on how to cultivate plants.” Lin Tao looked at Qiao Nian like she was looking at a monster. “That’s the Second Academy of Medicine you’re talking about.” “So what?” Qiao Nian looked at Lin Tao in confusion. “Will there be mutants present?”

“I’m afraid not,” Lin Tao said. “But all the big shots in the medical field will be at the lecture. Aren’t you nervous at all?”.

“I’m not nervous.” Qiao Nian glanced at the potted plant. “By the way, this plant doesn’t quite like water. Don’t water her for the rest of the week.”

“Got it. I’ll remember everything,” Lin Tao said with a smile.

Qiao Nian carefully inspected the other plants. Seeing that there was nothing wrong with them, she said, “Alright, I’ll head home first. If you need anything in the future, call me.”

“Alright, take care.”

When Qiao Nian left the research institute, she received a call as soon as she got into her car.

When she heard from the other end that someone was investigating her, a trace of confusion flashed across her face. “Who’s investigating me?” Qiao Nian asked, frowning “Liu Hai.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She had never heard this name before. “What does he do?”

“He’s just a nobody in the hacker world. Do you want me to interfere?”.

“Don’t worry about it. Any information he’ll be able to find is information I’m willing to let others know.” Qiao Nian’s eyes flashed. She continued, “Take note of who he’s giving the information to.”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she drove home.

Qiao Nian had just arrived home when the butler greeted her. “Second Young Madam, Matriarch Gu wants you to visit her study.”

Qiao Nian nodded and walked directly to Matriarch Gu’s study. She knocked on the door. “Grandma, it’s me.”

“Come in.” Matriarch Gu’s voice came from inside. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian pushed the door open and entered. She immediately saw the gown on the counter.

With just one look, Qiao Nian was stunned.

Matriarch Gu hurriedly pulled Qiao Nian over and urged her to put it on.

Holding the gown, Qiao Nian walked into the fitting room. She stepped out wearing the gown. This gown showed off every inch of Qiao Nian’s lovely figure, and even set off her unique aura. Elegant, refined, exquisite, and luxurious.

The gown exuded an air of wild sultriness, yet retained a sense of cold refinement. It was incredibly alluring…

What surprised her the most was that the diamonds sewn into the gown did not look tacky at all. It was as though she was wearing the resplendent night sky.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. This gown was truly beautiful.

It was indeed a gown designed by a designer well-known all over the world. Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian in the gown, her eyes filled with satisfaction. She couldn’t help but smile. She had designed many clothes in her lifetime, and all kinds of models had worn her clothes, but none of them had been able to express her designs perfectly.

However, after Qiao Nian put on the gown, she expressed the beauty of the gown exactly how Matriarch Gu wanted. Not only that, but this gown also set off her aura.

Oh, wow.

Her grandson was truly blessed!

To be able to marry such a drop-dead gorgeous beauty like Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked at herself in the fitting mirror. She had to admit that this was the most beautiful and comfortable gown she had ever worn. Even though she had yet to style her hair or do her make-up, the person in the mirror already looked very beautiful.
