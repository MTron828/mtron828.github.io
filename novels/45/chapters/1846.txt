At the mention of Song Ling, Qiao Nian’s first reaction was to see her face. She had seen Song Ling in Mark’s basement. She was smart and cunning, and her skills were not inferior to hers.

At that time, if she hadn’t been careless, she definitely wouldn’t have let Song Ling slip away from her.

Later on, when she saw Song Ling again, she was a corpse in Mark’s room.

Later on, she thought about the entire sequence of events. Logically speaking, Mark had no reason to kill Song Ling. From Wright, she knew that Mark valued Song Ling a lot. Why would he kill Song Ling because of them?

If he really wanted to use a dead person to frame them, he could just use an ordinary person.

Hence, she had a nagging feeling that Song Ling wasn’t really dead.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and said sternly, “It seems that we have to find Song Ling now. Only she can tell us the truth.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of confusion flashed in her eyes. Puzzled, she asked, “Nian Nian, isn’t Song Ling already dead? We saw it with our own eyes that night. Moreover, I saw a knife inserted into her abdomen.” Lina was 100% sure that Song Ling was really dead.

Qiao Nian’s brow relaxed slightly. With a serious expression, she said, “You’re right. She was indeed dead at that time.”

Lina felt that Qiao Nian’s words were a little strange. She looked at Chen Qing, who was sitting beside her.

At this moment, Chen Qing didn’t understand what Qiao Nian was talking about either. What he was thinking was that if a person died, they were dead. It was impossible for them to be resurrected. This wasn’t a novel or movie.

Qiao Nian knew that they didn’t understand what she meant, but her grandfather hadn’t allowed them to tell outsiders about that matter in the past, so she looked at him.

Old Master Qin noticed Qiao Nian’s gaze and knew what she was thinking. His eyes were clear as he looked at Qiao Nian lovingly. “You can say it.”

Qiao Nian nodded gently. Only then did she look at the others and continue, “In Country Z, there’s a mysterious forbidden technique. One of the forbidden techniques is a prescription for a secret medicine that’s not allowed to be made. That secret medicine is called Fake death medicine.”

“Fake death medicine?” Lina’s eyes widened in disbelief. Didn’t such things only appear in novels and movies?

“Yes, a person who takes the medicine to fake his death will die within three hours. The victim’s heartbeat and breathing will stop, and all the organs in his body will stop. He was no different from a real dead person.”

Lina’s mouth fell open in shock. Although she trusted Nian Nian a lot, what Nian Nian was saying now was too unbelievable. This was already beyond her understanding.

However, Lina still tried her best to accept Qiao Nian’s words.

Seeing Lina like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile and ask, “What are you thinking about?”

“Nian Nian, I’m just thinking. If all her organs stop working, will her organs still operate automatically after the medicine wears off?” The more Lina thought about it, the stranger she felt. “I just don’t understand this part.” Qiao Nian thought about it seriously before saying, “Let me give you an analogy. Many animals choose to hibernate in winter. They sleep for the entire winter without eating or drinking because they lower their body’s metabolism. Many organs are operating slowly. We said that the person who took the fake death medicine looked as if she was dead. Or perhaps it was because her organs were operating very slowly that people would mistake her for being dead.”

Lina was still extremely surprised. She said, “In that case, I understand. Country Z is really a magical country. It has everything.”

“This fake death medicine has been passed down from ancient times,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

“Oh my god, this is amazing!” Lina’s mother, Shen Mei, was from Country Z, so she had always yearned for life in Country Z. She had even heard many historical stories about Country Z.

If it weren’t for her special identity, she would have gone to visit Country Z long ago.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “These forbidden techniques are not allowed to be used, but if she really wants to use them, she might really not survive unless the person who gave her the Fake Death Medicine back uses acupuncture needles to save her..”
