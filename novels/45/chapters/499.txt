Chapter 500: Brother

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The fireflies made Qiao Nian look even more beautiful, like an otherworldly fairy.

Qiao Nian’s red lips curved into a faint smile. Her beautiful fox eyes curved into crescents. They were so beautiful that one forgot to breathe.

His interactions with Qiao Nian during this period of time flashed across his mind like a movie. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The two of them had gone through life and death together. This feeling touched him.

Lu Zhu looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes. Unknowingly, Qiao Nian was like a ray of light that illuminated the darkest part of his heart.

Lu Zhu’s lips moved slightly.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu’s handsome face and recalled the first time she had gone to the Lu family. Lu Zhu was standing at the door of the Lu family’s eldest daughter’s room, but he didn’t dare to enter.

In that case, Lu Zhu must have loved his sister so much that he was unwilling to face the death of the Lu family’s eldest daughter…

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart seemed to be gripped tightly by an invisible hand. Even breathing became difficult.

Her lips moved slightly, and her voice cracked. “Brother.”

She had been suppressing this form of address for several days. Today, she finally managed to say it.

Suddenly, tears filled her eyes.

At this moment, she clearly realized that she had a family. She had not been abandoned.

It wasn’t that her family hadn’t sought her out before. They’d been lied to. They’d been consumed by the pain of her death.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, his body stiffened, and his pupils involuntarily dilated. He looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. After a long while, he asked, “What did you call me just now?”

Qiao Nian walked towards Lu Zhu step by step. The fireflies in the bottle spread out bit by bit.

When Doctor Sha saw this situation, he was a little moved for a moment, and his eyes involuntarily turned red.

It turned out that Qiao Nian didn’t plan to acknowledge Lu Zhu in the evening. Instead, she appeared at the right time after catching these fireflies.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was getting closer and closer, Doctor Sha silently took a few steps back and gradually moved away, leaving this space to Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu.

When Qiao Nian approached him, Lu Zhu finally saw the dust on Qiao Nian’s face. It must have been accidentally dirtied when she caught the fireflies previously. She looked like a house kitten.

Lu Zhu swallowed and said uncertainty, “W-What did you just call me?”

Qiao Nian met Lu Zhu’s gaze. Without any hesitation, she said word by word, “Brother.”

Qiao Nian had already thought of many scenarios where she would reunite with Lu Zhu. She had also mentally prepared herself. However, when this moment arrived, she was still very nervous.

Lu Zhu stood rooted to the ground, looking at Qiao Nian in confusion. For a moment, he actually treated Qiao Nian as his sister.

Although Lu Qi often called him brother, when Qiao Nian called him brother, his heart trembled violently.

Lu Zhu’s breathing involuntarily sank, and he was a little surprised.

After a while, Lu Zhu remembered that Qiao Nian had once told others that he was her sworn brother.

A trace of sadness flashed across Lu Zhu’s eyes as he eased the pressure in his heart. His voice was still gentle as he said, “Miss Qiao, if we get married, we’ll officially hold a banquet when we return to An City.”

Qiao Nian wasn’t surprised that Lu Zhu would say that. After all, no one would believe that their sister, who had died twenty years ago, would stand in front of them again.

Qiao Nian shook her head gently. Her beautiful fox-like eyes stared unblinkingly at Lu Zhu as she said, “You’ve misunderstood. I don’t intend to marry you because you’re my biological brother.”

“Biological brother?” Lu Zhu asked with a frown.

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded and continued, “Although you might not believe what I’m about to say, this is the truth. Do you remember the questions I asked you after you woke up from the surgery?”
