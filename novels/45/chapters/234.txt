Chapter 235: Jealousy

When Wang Xuan heard Ye Ran’s words, she laughed in anger. She said speechlessly, “Is there something wrong with your brain? What right do you have to slander us? You didn’t even have any evidence to search through our things. Now, you’ve made such a mess of our things. I’m going to call the police! You’ve violated my privacy!”

Ye Ran’s lackeys said, “So be it. You’re clearly the ones who stole it. Let the police investigate!”

“That’s right, that’s right. One look and I can tell that the two of you are country bumpkins from god knows where. The two of you must have never seen anything so good. That’s why you stole it!”

“Yes, yes, yes. That’s right. You stole it!”

Ye Ran nodded. She felt that it was true and it was definitely the two of them who had stolen her tickets.

But so what if they didn’t? She had to find someone to take the blame for what had happened today. Otherwise, she would feel uncomfortable no matter what.

Ye Ran sized Qiao Nian up brazenly. Her gaze fell on the violin bag in Qiao Nian’s hand.

Ye Ran’s eyes darted around. She recalled that when they went to rummage through Qiao Nian’s desk just now, Qiao Nian had taken the violin away and carried it on her back.

This proved that Qiao Nian cared a lot about this violin.

Could the tickets be in the violin bag?

With this thought in mind, Ye Ran arrogantly walked up to Qiao Nian and extended her hand. With a cold expression, she ordered, “Give me the violin bag.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She gripped her violin bag tightly and said coldly, “Ye Ran, I’ll give you one last chance to be a decent human. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

“You’re welcome. How do you want to be impolite?” Ye Ran burst into laughter. She had never seen anyone who dared to threaten her. A thief who had stolen her things still wanted to threaten her. This was simply the funniest joke in the world. “By being a thief?”

When the lackeys around Ye Ran heard Ye Ran’s words, they nodded in agreement and looked at Qiao Nian mockingly.

Ye Ran took a step forward and her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She continued, “Qiao Nian, do you not know the strength of our Ye family? How dare you threaten me! Tell me, what exactly does your family do?”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, Ye Ran asked, “Why? Don’t you even know what your father does?”

The lackeys around Ye Ran immediately couldn’t stop smiling.

“Qiao Nian is really too funny. She didn’t even receive any guidance from a music teacher. How dare she come to our school on her own?”

“If you ask me, her family must be poor. Otherwise, why wouldn’t she be able to afford a teacher and attend a professional class?”

“I guess it’s because her family is poor that she doesn’t want others to have anything good.”

“Despicable to the bone.”

“It’s better if we stay away from such people. Perhaps our things will be stolen as well.”

When the other students heard Ye Ran’s good friends’ words, they couldn’t stand it anymore.

“You can’t say that about Qiao Nian. Moreover, this matter hasn’t been investigated thoroughly yet. We’re all classmates in the same class. We’ll go through thick and thin together.”

“Yes, yes. We’ll decide after we investigate thoroughly!”

“Although Qiao Nian hasn’t officially and systematically studied music, the fact that she can play beautiful music means that she’s very talented in music. She’s better than most of us.”

After all, this was the most famous music academy in the country. Most of the students here were of high quality.

As the saying went, a rat’s poop ruined a pot of soup.

Ye Ran and her friends were truly evil.

Wang Xuan looked at Ye Ran coldly and said sarcastically, “I think some people are just too jealous. They’re jealous that others are better than them, so they’re slandering others for having bad character. They’re simply evil!”

Wang Xuan’s words were like stepping on Ye Ran’s tail. Ye Ran was so angry that her face turned green. “You!”

Ye Ran took a few deep breaths, and her expression was much better. Only then did she say to her friends, “The few of you, help me snatch Qiao Nian’s violin!”
