Chapter 374: Genius (2)

Qiao Nian nodded slightly, then said, “If I write the words ‘copy’ on this painting, it will just be an ordinary painting. I wonder if you’re still willing to accept it?”

Old Master Jiang Qi was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. He hurriedly nodded. “Yes, yes. I’m more than willing!”

The surrounding people instantly looked at Qiao Nian with starry eyes.

“This is the temperament of a genius painter!”

“Although there’s no commercial value in copied works, Miss Huang Shi’s copied works still have value. This is something that many people can only dream of!”

“Miss Huang Shi is so good to old people.”

…

Under everyone’s praise, Qiao Nian took out a small square box. She opened it and took out a seal made of Hetian jade. The surface was exquisitely carved.

Everyone saw Qiao Nian holding the seal and placing it heavily on the bottom right corner of the stone wall.

Everyone wanted to take a look at Miss Huang Shi’s seal, but they realized that there was no trace of it on the stone wall painting.

Had Miss Qiao Nian just been struck by something?

Old Master Jiang Qi was also puzzled. He said politely, “Miss Huang Shi, you didn’t use any ink on your seal just now.”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the copied stone wall drawings. Smiling, she explained, “I think every drawing is a complete work. I don’t want this work to be superfluous, so my seal can only be verified by UV light.”

......

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, he was suddenly enlightened. No wonder Miss Huang Shi’s previous works were not signed or stamped.

When Old Master Jiang Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he said, “Actually, as long as we take out the fake money detector and scan them, we can confirm which of the two paintings is the real one.”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded.

Everyone hurriedly took out their phones and found a function to check the authenticity of banknotes. Then, they scanned the two paintings on the table.

There was no seal on the piece Song Yu had brought.

On the painting Qiao Nian had brought with her, there was a seal at the bottom right corner.

Huang Shi.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the seal. He frowned slightly, his fingers gently caressing the jade ring on his hand. His eyes sparkled, and an intriguing smile appeared on his face.

His guess was right.

Qiao Nian indeed had a simpler way to prove that the painting it had brought was authentic. However, Qiao Nian didn’t choose that method. Instead, she chose to step forward and expose her identity.

After some hesitation, Qiao Nian chose to reveal her identity.

Gu Zhou narrowed his beautiful phoenix-like eyes.

“No wonder I couldn’t find the signature on Miss Huang Shi’s painting. So that’s the reason.”

“Miss Huang Shi really loves painting and calligraphy. She doesn’t want her painting to have any flaws at all.”

“I’m still a little confused. I really can’t believe that an eight or nine-year-old girl can draw such a beautiful painting.”

“This is simply unbelievable, but everything in front of me tells me that this is real.”

“Do you know where Miss Huang Shi studied?”

“We don’t understand the world of geniuses. Some time ago, didn’t you say that a four-year-old child could solve a high school physics problem?”

…

Just as everyone was marveling at Qiao Nian’s talent, a low and gentle voice made their hearts tighten.

“Miss Song, shouldn’t you explain where you got this forgery?”

Everyone looked over and saw Gu Zhou looking at Song Yu expressionlessly.

Song Yu’s heart jumped to her throat.

She knew very well that Gu Zhou was defending Qiao Nian.

Only then did everyone come back to their senses and recall this matter.

Just now, everyone had almost bought a fake version of the stone wall painting. If it was really sold at a high price, not only would it violate Miss Huang Shi’s rights, but it would also be illegal.

“Miss Song, did you bring a fake painting on purpose?”

“Miss Song, how can you slander Miss Huang Shi?”

“Miss Song, where did you get the fake?”

…

For a moment, Huang Shi’s fans pushed Song Yu to the center of attention.
