Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu had just entered their rooms when they heard a charming voice.

“Seriously, why are we here? It’s so dirty. How annoying!”

That delicate voice revealed a lot of dissatisfaction, instantly attracting the attention of everyone present.

The person who spoke was none other than Boss Jin’s new favorite model, Ah Miao.

Boss Jin, who was beside Ah Miao, was talking to Mr. Chen.

Mr. Chen naturally heard what Ah Miao said, and the smile on his face deepened.

Qiao Nian silently took in this scene.

Ah Miao didn’t seem to realize anything yet. She frowned at the carpet under her feet and said, “This carpet is really rotten. It’s really lame!”

As Ah Miao spoke, she gently leaned into Boss Jin’s arms. Her coquettish expression was adorable.

Many men liked such women.

Mr. Chen took out a cigar from his pocket and handed it to Boss Jin, then reached out to Ah Miao.

Ah Miao looked at Mr. Chen’s hand, and a hint of disdain flashed across her eyes. Without hesitation, she slapped Mr. Chen’s hand away and said sweetly, “Stupid man, take your hand away quickly. Don’t touch me!”

When Boss Jin heard Ah Miao say this, his face instantly darkened. He quickly pushed Ah Meow away and apologized to Mr. Chen with a terrified expression.

Mr. Chen was very magnanimous and quickly shook his head.

Qiao Nian silently retracted her gaze. She pursed her lips slightly and said, “It seems that this model called Ah Miao has offended Mr. Chen!”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, a look of disdain flashed across her face. She said nonchalantly, “Are you thinking too much? He’s just a secretary. Do you have to make such a fuss?”

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground and only smiled, not saying another word.

Was the person who could make Lu Zhu and Qiao Yu afraid really just an ordinary secretary?

Moreover, she had investigated Mr. Chen before, and she had gained nothing.

The more she couldn’t find anything, the more dangerous he was.

Moreover, her goal here today was the Moon Goddess, so she needed to conserve her energy now.

At midnight.

Qiao Nian was woken up by the noise outside. Instantly, she was no longer sleepy. She glanced at the time. It was two in the morning.

Qiao Nian grabbed her bathrobe and put it on. When she opened the door, she saw everyone rushing in one direction. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A trace of confusion flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes. She stopped a girl who was running in that direction and asked in confusion, “Miss, what happened? Why is everyone running in that direction?”

“I think a little girl drowned in the lake!” The young girl quickly followed the rest.

Qiao Nian walked in the opposite direction of the crowd. She walked to the end of the corridor on the second floor. There was a window here, and she could see the lake of the hotel.

At this moment, the police cars had also arrived and pulled out the cordon. The commotion downstairs was very loud.

Qiao Nian stood on high ground and saw the corpse that the police had fished out. When the light landed on the corpse’s face, her breathing tightened.

That corpse was none other than Ah Miao, who had hit Mr. Chen today.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel nervous. At this moment, she suddenly heard footsteps.

Before she could turn around and see the man’s face, she realized that he had covered her with his windbreaker like a gentleman.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to take off the windbreaker, she suddenly smelled a familiar scent.

At this moment, a gentle voice came from above. “Night time in MY is very dangerous. It’s better for girls not to dress so dangerously!”

Qiao Nian’s heart jumped to her throat. This, this voice…

For some reason, she thought of Mr. Chen again.

She looked up and saw Gu Zhou’s handsome face. The uneasiness and panic in her heart gradually disappeared.
