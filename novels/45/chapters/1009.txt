1010 Nervous

“Are Xiao Shi and Xiao Qi going too?” Matriarch Gu asked with a loving smile.

Qiao Nian didn’t know what was going on with the Lu family either, so she didn’t plan to bring the two children over this time.

“Grandma, I want to bring them over next time,” Qiao Nian explained with a smile.

“Okay.” A gentle smile appeared on Matriarch Gu’s face. Previously, on the anniversary of the death of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Song Yu had mistaken Qiao Nian for Madam Lu. She had suspected that Qiao Nian was related to the Lu family.

But later on, because she was too busy, she forgot about it.

It seemed that Ah Zhou and Qiao Nian were fated. The two of them were destined to be together.

After dinner, Qiao Nian exchanged a few more words with Matriarch Gu and instructed the two children to behave at home. Only then did she leave with Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian sat in the front passenger seat and was about to fasten her seatbelt when Gu Zhou took the initiative to lean over.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Just as she was about to ask, she saw Gu Zhou helping her fasten her seatbelt.

Gu Zhou was really considerate now.

“Thank you,” Qiao Nian said subconsciously.

When Gu Zhou heard this, he frowned slightly. He moved closer to Qiao Nian’s forehead and kissed her lightly.

“Why did you kiss me?” Qiao Nian frowned slightly, feeling especially nervous. She hoped that everything would be perfect. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She hurriedly took out her makeup from her bag and prepared to touch up her makeup.

“To punish you.”

Qiao Nian paused in her actions. Puzzled, she asked, “Why?”

“You and I shouldn’t thank each other!” Gu Zhou said seriously. In his opinion, only strangers would thank each other. He and Qiao Nian were husband and wife. The two of them were one to begin with. Since they were one, there was no need to be so polite.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She remembered that Gu Zhou had also told her not to thank him vefore. So Gu Zhou had already taken a liking to her back then.

“I understand.” Qiao Nian touched up her makeup and fell silent. Thinking that she was about to reach the Lu family, her heart couldn’t help but race.

Seeing that the Lu family was getting closer and closer, Qiao Nian instantly tensed up, her heart in her throat.

Although she had already thought of facing such a large family, she was still very nervous when she really had to face them.

She didn’t know what to say at first.

Just as Qiao Nian’s thoughts were running wild, her phone rang. She suddenly came back to her senses and took out her phone. When she saw that it was Lu Zhu, she became even more nervous.

“Brother.”

“Sugar, where are you now?”

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou’s phone GPS and said, “I’ll be there in ten minutes!”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he frowned imperceptibly and asked tentatively, “Sugar, are you very nervous?”

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and tried hard to remain calm. “Yes, a little.”

“Sugar, actually, you don’t have to be nervous. You’ve been here before. Just be the same as before.” At this point, Lu Zhu added, “Moreover, we siblings have already met and acknowledged each other. Don’t worry.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian thought so too. She had already reunited with her brothers and sister. This time, she was mainly reuniting with Grandma. It was just one person. She shouldn’t be nervous. “Brother, did you tell Grandma that I’m still alive?”

“Not yet. We all want to wait for you to come and tell your grandmother about this surprise personally.”

This was the result of Lu Zhu’s discussion with the others.

Surprise?

A trace of worry flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She was a doctor and knew that Grandma wasn’t in good health. Worried, she asked, “If that’s the case, will Grandma be agitated?”

“No, don’t worry. Grandma is in good health now. Besides, it’s a good thing that we have to tell Grandma. How can she be agitated?” Lu Zhu chuckled. His heart felt warm because Qiao Nian cared about Grandma. “If we had told Grandma a few days ago, Grandma would definitely have arranged for you to go home without eating or drinking. She definitely wouldn’t have been able to sleep. At that time, you would definitely have been under pressure. Grandma wouldn’t have been able to sleep well either.”
