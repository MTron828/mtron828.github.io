Chapter 1735 - 1735 I'll Sign

Most importantly, the way he looked at her was gentle, and he seemed to be filled with love.

Lina recalled Chen Qing’s confession last night and couldn’t help but blush.

Wright’s curse brought Lina back from her sweet thoughts. She glanced at Wright, whose eyes were filled with malice. She felt that if Wright had the ability to fight back, he would definitely kill her with a knife.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Lina initially wanted Chen Qing to be gentler. On second thought, forget it. Let Wright suffer.

She looked at Chen Qing and nodded in agreement, preparing to write a new contract.

For the next half an hour, Chen Qing only used the dagger to randomly cut Wright’s body. Wright’s arms, chest, and back were covered in knife marks.

Wright was in so much pain that he wanted to die. He shouted, “Alright, I understand. I’ll sign it, I’ll sign it!”

Wright couldn’t take it anymore. He was cut all over, and half of his left ear had fallen off.

He felt that Chen Qing wouldn’t kill him. He was right. In order to avoid trouble, Chen Qing wouldn’t kill him. He would only torture him.

Sometimes, torture was even more painful.

Wright’s hand, which was holding the pen, was intact. He looked at the contract Lina had rewritten and signed it with a frown.

This farce ended with Wright’s signature.

Lina put away the contract very seriously. This was also Wright’s guarantee. She had to keep it well. This was leverage against Wright.

Lina smiled at Chen Qing and said, “Let him go. There’s no point in keeping him.”

Via grew bolder now. She looked at Wright and said fiercely, “You have to return our phones to us and restore the Internet. There’s a royal meeting this morning. If the Seventh Princess doesn’t attend it, the president will definitely settle scores with you!”

When Chen Qing heard Via’s words, he was slightly stunned. Only then did he realize that Wright had cut off the Internet in order to torture Lina.

His eyes were filled with coldness. Wright was really too despicable. He actually used such a method to bully Lina. His gaze was like a knife, scaring Wright so much that he shivered.

Wright sat there trembling, his entire body covered in scratches and blood. He shrank his neck and said, “I just cut the net for two hours. I would have restored it long ago.”

When Chen Qing heard Wright’s words, if it weren’t for the fact that he couldn’t kill Wright now, he really wanted to kill him directly. He kicked Wright’s shoulder and said angrily, “Get lost!”

Wright immediately got up from the ground with difficulty and staggered out. He was injured now, and every step was difficult.

With great effort, he unlocked the door and walked out. Looking at the guards at the door, he scolded angrily, “Why are you all standing there like idiots? Come and help me up!”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

The guards hurriedly swarmed forward.

Via secretly walked to the door and watched as the guards took Wright away. She immediately locked the door, clutched her chest, and said with a smile, “Seventh Princess, you should have taken a good look at Wright just now. He fled like a stray dog. Now that the princess has Wright’s contract guarantee, he’ll definitely tuck his tail between his legs in the future.”

With that, Via saw the light drain from Lina’s eyes. It was as if all her strength had drained out of her. She leaned back against the table.

“Seventh Princess!” Via called out anxiously, stepping forward quickly.

Chen Qing noticed that something was wrong with Lina’s expression and quickly walked over to her. Her face was pale, and his heart ached uncontrollably. He said in a low voice, “You’re safe now. Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. Rest early.”

“Seventh Princess, I’ve only treated your injuries briefly. Why don’t we call Doctor Ollie over to take a look at you?” Via said worriedly.

“There’s no need. I’ve already contacted Dr. Ollie. He’ll be back in a while.” Chen Qing looked at Lina worriedly.
