Chapter 119 Go On Fabricating

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Xin’s mind raced. As long as she could calm Qiao Nian down right now, they could still discuss the collaboration between Su Yan and Director Lin some time later.

If anyone else found out that Qiao Nian was the one who had cultivated the Suranne Grass, her reputation would be ruined. Not only would Su Yan be angry, but Gu Zhou would also be displeased with her.

“Sister, the opening ceremony is starting soon. Don’t spout nonsense. Let’s go home, okay?”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrow slightly, speaking in a cold voice, “Forget about the opening ceremony for now. Answer my question first!”

After Qiao Nian spoke, everyone was even more certain that Qiao Nian was a lunatic. No one in An City would dare to cause trouble at Director Lin’s grand opening ceremony.

Everyone looked toward Director Lin. They saw that he wasn’t angry at Qiao Nian’s words. Instead, he was listening to the gossip with anticipation.

Everyone was a little curious. They recalled that Director Lin had previously addressed Qiao Nian as Nian Nian. For a moment, they were all curious about their relationship.

Qiao Xin’s heart was beating faster and faster. Her mind was in a mess, and she didn’t know what to say.

“Qiao Xin, the Suranne Grass is already beginning to wilt. Are you sure you know how to cultivate it?” Qiao Nian said impatiently. “If you can take good care of my Suranne Grass, I won’t say anything, but right now,

you’re essentially trampling on it!”

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, their gazes fell on the Suranne Grass.

The Suranne Grass was indeed beginning to look a little listless.

Qiao Xin had also noticed something strange about the Suranne Grass, but at this moment, she had to refuse to admit that Qiao Nian had cultivated this pot of Suranne Grass. “Sister, you’ve indeed taken care of this pot

of Suranne Grass for a few days, but I’ve cultivated it since the beginning. I know you like Brother Su Yan, but he’s my boyfriend now. Today is the opening day of Director Lin’s research institute. If anything is the

matter, we can talk when we get back, okay?”

Clap! Clap! Clap!

Qiao Nian clapped for Qiao Xin. That mouth of Qiao Xin’s truly knew no bounds!

Qiao Nian sneered. “Do go on fabricating!”

This was such a trivial matter, but Qiao Xin was relentlessly adding fuel to the fire. Now, she was even trying to sow discord between her and Gu Zhou. She was just pretending to be an obedient and innocent girl!

Qiao Xin’s eyes were now filled with tears, and she looked extremely pitiful. The onlookers all felt that Qiao Xin was being bullied.

In this situation, it was clearly Qiao Nian who was causing trouble for no reason!

Everyone spoke one after another. They all wanted Qiao Nian to leave as soon as possible, lest she continue stirring up trouble on purpose.

At this moment, Gu Zhou, who had been silent all this while, spoke.

“Since the matter has already blown up, let’s make things clear now. Otherwise, others might think that Director Lin has bullied a young lady to the point of tears!”

Qiao Xin looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to speak up for Qiao Nian. Did Gu Zhou not mind the flirtatious relationship between Qiao Nian and Su Yan at all?

When Director Lin heard Gu Zhou’s words, he nodded in agreement. “That’s right, that’s right. The truth of this matter must be made clear!”

Lin Tao, who had been standing in the crowd, stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. She believed that Qiao Nian would definitely handle this matter well.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Qiao Xin’s face again. She narrowed her beautiful crescent-shaped eyes and questioned again, “Are you sure you cultivated this pot of Suranne Grass?”

Qiao Xin could naturally tell that Qiao Nian was angry. She nodded obediently and said, “Sister, it’s getting late. Let me take you home to take your medicine!”

“Qiao Xin, I’ll repeat myself one more time. If you don’t take out the Suranne Grass, it will really wither!” Qiao Nian enunciated each word clearly.

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, they all felt that she was looking for trouble. One by one, they sneered at her.

They glanced at Qiao Nian and then at Qiao Xin. They were both children of the same parents. One was both a troublemaker and a lunatic, while the other was so sweet and capable. One didn’t have to think hard to Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

know that Qiao Xin was right.

If they were Qiao Xin’s parents, they would probably favor Qiao Xin as well..
