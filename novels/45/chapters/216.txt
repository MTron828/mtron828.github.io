Chapter 217: Split Personality?

Could it be that Gu Zhou had a split personality?

Otherwise, why would Gu Zhou have no memory of what had just happened?

Qiao Nian opened her mouth to explain, but Gu Zhou said angrily, “Get out!”

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened. Standing up, she threw a towel at Gu Zhou. Without another word, she left with the medicine kit, not forgetting to slam the door shut.

Gu Zhou was left alone in the bathroom.

The mist lingered in the air. The fragrance of the shower gel was overpowering. He really hated this smell.

His memory had stopped at the doorway. He had no recollection of when Qiao Nian had arrived, or how he had ended up in the bathroom.

Had he actually been unconscious for so long in front of Qiao Nian?

Gu Zhou stood up. Seeing that he was still in his boxers, the anxiety in his heart lessened a little. After washing up briefly, he walked out in his bathrobe.

Gu Zhou had just come out when he saw Chen Qing standing trembling at the bathroom door.

“Where is she?”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s voice, he was slightly stunned. His scalp went numb. Why did he feel that Second Young Master didn’t remember what had just happened?

Seeing that Chen Qing was staring at him without answering, Gu Zhou frowned.

Chen Qing immediately lowered his head and said in a subservient manner, “Madam went to the front hall.”

Gu Zhou’s expression turned even colder. His gaze seemed to be scrutinizing Chen Qing. “When did I arrive in the bathroom?”

Chen Qing opened his mouth slightly. After thinking for a long time, he still didn’t know what to say. In the end, he lowered his head and silently apologized to Qiao Nian. “Madam knows very well.”

Gu Zhou retracted his cold gaze from Chen Qing and strode towards the front hall.

Qiao Nian was taking out the crystal cup from the medicine box and placing it on the table. Since Gu Zhou had woken up, it was time to return the cup to its rightful owner.

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and looked at the cup in her hand, his phoenix-like eyes filled with confusion.

Why did he lose all his memories? When did he give the cup to Qiao Nian?

Qiao Nian heard footsteps and turned around. Seeing Gu Zhou, she handed the crystal cup to him. “I’m returning this to its rightful owner!”

Gu Zhou looked at the crystal cup in Qiao Nian’s hand. Her hand was fair and slender, and there was something faintly alluring about it. Thinking of the scene in the bathroom just now, he threw the embarrassing thought to the back of his mind. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he said calmly, “This was meant for you in the first place.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked at him in surprise. Confusion was written all over her face.

Wasn’t he himself now? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Why was he still intending to give her the cup?

Did he know what giving a cup meant?

Qiao Nian felt that there were some things she had to make clear. “You…”

Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian indifferently. “You drink red wine every night. Good red wine requires a good glass. Ordinary wine glasses won’t give justice to your red wine.”

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. She had never expected Gu Zhou to have noted that detail. She heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Gu Zhou didn’t mean anything further than that.

That made sense. Gu Zhou was such a cold person. No matter how one looked at him, he didn’t seem to be a romantic person.

Moreover, the way Gu Zhou had looked at her when he woke up in the bathroom just now made her completely certain that he was still wary of her.

Qiao Nian looked down at the crystal glass in her hand. Using this glass to hold red wine was truly a waste of the crystal glass.

Seeing that Qiao Nian seemed to be thinking hard, Gu Zhou thought that she was musing about his illness just now. He asked, “What happened just now?”

Qiao Nian placed the crystal cup back on the table and looked up at Gu Zhou, asking seriously, “Do you really not remember anything that happened just now?”

Gu Zhou shook his head.

“Come here. Sit on the sofa.” Qiao Nian motioned for Gu Zhou to sit down on the sofa with her, then took his pulse.

Gu Zhou’s pulse was still erratic. It would alternate between racing and slowing down. It was as if he had been poisoned.

Qiao Nian’s eyes darkened, and her brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

She knew very well that Gu Zhou was not poisoned. Instead, his condition had worsened.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Gu Zhou had indeed suffered from a split personality just now. Under the torment of his illness, he had split into an innocent, naive personality, temporarily forgetting about his illness.
