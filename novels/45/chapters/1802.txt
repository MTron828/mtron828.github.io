Chapter 1803 - 1803 Silly

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Lina heaved a sigh of relief. The huge rock that had been pressing down on her heart seemed to have lightened a lot. She raised her hand to wipe her tears. “Yes.”

“I think he might wake up in a while. Stay with him. I’ll go busy myself,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

Lina nodded and quickly walked towards Chen Qing’s bed.

Seeing Lina enter, Gu Zhou turned around and went straight to Dr. Ollie’s office.

Only Lina and Chen Qing were left in the ward. Lina sat by the bed and her eyes could not help but turn red. She seemed to have thought of something and stood up. She lowered her head and placed her ear on Chen Qing’s chest. She listened to Chen Qing’s rhythmic heartbeat and blushed.

Lina sat on the chair again and her gaze landed on Chen Qing’s face. At this moment, Chen Qing’s face and lips were frighteningly pale.

Fortunately, Chen Qing’s breathing was normal, and his heartbeat was normal.

In the past, she wanted to find a good-looking man of equal social status.

However, she couldn’t control her feelings towards Chen Qing.

On the stage today, those enemies rushed up one after another. Every time, she thought that she would be hurt, Chen Qing protected her very well and she did not suffer any harm.

The danger she faced on the stage was slowly reduced. Later, when she saw that Cui Si was going to kill her father, she was stunned.

It was Chen Qing who gave her a knife to protect herself and told her to hide.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Chen Qing ran towards his father without hesitation and blocked Cui Si’s knife for him.

She was very happy that her father was not injured.

However, Chen Qing was injured. At that time, she was so sad that she was almost frightened to death.

Lina reached out and held Chen Qing’s hand. Thinking of the situation at that time, she said in a low voice, “I still remember you telling me that when all of this is over, we should reconsider our relationship. You still want to know my answer, right?”

Lina smiled helplessly and looked at Chen Qing intently. “Why are you so stupid? My answer hasn’t changed. The person I like has always been you. How can I leave you?”

“Liking you is the best thing that has happened in my life. Thank God for letting me meet you. You’re like a hero to me.”

“Do you still remember when you told me to bite your hand if I was afraid of pain?”

“I was thinking at that time. Won’t it hurt if I bite your hand?”

“But reality told me that even if I bit your hand, it will still hurt.”

“Chen Qing, how can you be so stupid? You don’t even understand such a simple logic.”

“Although I’m a princess, there’s a huge difference between a real princess and a fairytale princess. I can’t do whatever I want but I don’t have to marry a prince.”

“I only hope to marry you, because in my eyes, you’re my hero.”

At this point, Lina gently held Chen Qing’s hand. Thinking of the bits and pieces of their past, the corners of her mouth involuntarily curled up.

“Your Highness, are you willing to marry him?”

A hoarse voice sounded from the side of the bed, interrupting Lina’s thoughts.

Lina looked at Chen Qing on the bed in disbelief and saw that Chen Qing had already woken up. There was a smile in his eyes, and her heart beat violently.

“Ah!”

Lina was so frightened that she let go of Chen Qing’s hand. Her face instantly turned red, and she did not dare to look into Chen Qing’s eyes. She looked to the side and whispered, “Why are you awake so quickly? Nian Nian said that you have to sleep more?”

Lina frowned. She thought that Chen Qing had already fallen asleep and could not hear her voice, so she said everything that was on her mind.

H-how did he wake up so early?

God, was there a hole in the ground for her to crawl into? She was about to die of embarrassment.

Lina was a little uneasy. Even if there was no crack in the ground, there was a door and she had the urge to leave!

With this thought in mind, Lina stood up and was about to leave.
However, Chen Qing seemed to understand what Lina was thinking. He grabbed Lina’s hand and pulled her back.

Lina turned to look at Chen Qing and stammered, “You want water, right? Shall I get you some water?”
