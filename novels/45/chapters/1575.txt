Qiao Nian nodded and continued, "If that person wants to spread the information, he must have his own channels. When he does those things, he definitely has to do it behind your backs. If you noticed that something was wrong, you can tell us."

When Amon heard Qiao Nian's words, his expression turned serious. He said seriously, "I'll think about it."

Qiao Nian smiled and said softly, "There's no hurry. Take your time."

Amon nodded. He thought for a moment before saying, "Dhaka often asked me to help him with work previously. I don't know what he's busy with."

"Is that so?" Qiao Nian asked, pretending to be curious.

Lina frowned slightly and pretended to be calm. She picked up a teacup and took a sip.

They had already confirmed that Amon was the traitor. Now that Amon was naming other people without hesitation, it seemed that he really did not care about their relationship as colleagues at all.

"Yes." Amon nodded and continued, "There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the others."

"Alright, you can go back first," Qiao Nian said calmly.

Amon stood up and walked out. When he walked out of the room, his eyes were filled with fear and unease. He clenched his fists and tried hard to remain calm.

Lina waited for Amon to leave before she moved closer to Qiao Nian and asked in a voice that only the two of them could hear, "Nian Nian, why didn't you arrest him?"

Qiao Nian smiled gently and said, "Don't you want to know what he'll do after this?"

Lina's eyes were filled with confusion.

"We can take the opportunity to catch all of them in one fell swoop!" Qiao Nian's voice instantly turned cold. She had come this time to alert the enemy on purpose. She wanted to see what Amon would do next.

According to Amon, Qiao Nian had already locked the soldier called Dhaka up in another room.

After finishing her work here, Qiao Nian followed Lina to see Madam President.

When Shen Mei heard that Qiao Nian had fainted yesterday, she was so anxious. Now that she heard from the servant that Qiao Nian had arrived, she hurriedly stood up and walked out.

She walked to the door and saw Qiao Nian and Lina standing together.

Seeing that Shen Mei had come out, Lina smiled and walked over to her. Holding Shen Mei's arm, she said gently, "Mom, how do you feel? Are you feeling better?"

Shen Mei nodded, then her gaze fell on Qiao Nian's face. She sized her up from head to toe. Seeing that Qiao Nian was really fine, she heaved a sigh of relief. "Are you alright?"

"Thank you for your concern, Madam. I'm fine now." Qiao Nian smiled and followed Shen Mei and Lina in. She looked at Shen Mei beside her. "Madam, how did you feel yesterday? Are you feeling better?"

Hearing Qiao Nian's question, Shen Mei pondered for a moment before saying, "I-I'm much better."

Shen Mei knew that Qiao Nian had gone to the mountains to pick herbs for her yesterday. "Nian Nian, thank you."

"Madam, you're my patient. It's only right for me to take care of you." Qiao Nian looked at Shen Mei gently. Seeing that Shen Mei was looking well, she said, "Let me take your pulse."

Shen Mei handed her arm to Qiao Nian. She looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze and seemed to be very concerned about her. She glanced at Lina and asked, "I want to eat some snacks."

"Then I'll get it." Lina smiled and stood up. After nodding at Qiao Nian, she stood up and left.

Seeing that Lina had left, Shen Mei looked at Qiao Nian and said unhurriedly, "Nian Nian, I-I'm fine. Don't do anything dangerous next time."

"Okay." Qiao Nian smiled and agreed. The Gu worm in Shen Mei's body had already been controlled. Now, as long as the time was right, she could take out the Gu worm in Shen Mei's body.

"Yes, you… you're still young. I'm old. You have to be fine."

Although Shen Mei's words were staggered, Qiao Nian still understood what she meant.

You're still young. I'm old. Don't risk your life for me. You have to live well.

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at Shen Mei and said softly, "Madam, it's not dangerous at all. Don't worry, you'll recover from your illness soon."

Shen Mei's eyes lit up. When she smiled, she looked innocent. "Thank you, Nian Nian."
