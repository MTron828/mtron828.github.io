Chapter 1753 - 1753 Caught

Qiao Nian frowned. She subconsciously took out the silver needles from her pocket and was about to check if Song Ling was really dead when footsteps came from outside.

When Lina heard those footsteps, she instantly reacted.

If this was Mark’s plan, did it mean that Mark wanted to frame her and Nian Nian for this woman’s death?

Seeing that Qiao Nian was about to examine the corpse, Lina frowned and hurriedly held Qiao Nian’s hand. “Nian Nian, you can’t stab her with the needle. He just wants to frame us for this woman’s death. We should leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, we won’t be able to explain ourselves.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, she instantly reacted. “You’re right!”

“Then let’s escape now. Let’s not waste any more time!” With that, she pulled Qiao Nian towards the window!Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

A cold wind blew in from outside.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on the corpse, her brows furrowed.

In order to investigate what happened 21 years ago, they came to Europe. It was not easy for them to find out about Song Ling. They had a new clue, but Song Ling was dead.

The clues were cut off just like that. Qiao Nian felt a little uncomfortable.

“Nian Nian, stop looking. They’re coming soon. Let’s run!” Lina was extremely anxious. She wished she could push down the window and jump down to escape!

Qiao Nian stood on the windowsill and looked at the ground. Mark was like a pervert. Although this was only the second floor, it was about 10 meters from the window to the ground.

It was fine for her to jump down, but what about Lina?

Qiao Nian looked at Lina worriedly and whispered, “We can’t jump out of the window. We have to think of another way!”

Qiao Nian was about to turn around and enter the room when the door was kicked open by the guards.

Seeing those people rush over, Lina pushed Qiao Nian back with both hands and did not forget to remind her, “Be careful!”

“Lina!” Qiao Nian looked at Lina in disbelief.

She only saw Lina standing in front of the window and looking down. She saw the smile on her face and frowned tightly.

When Qiao Nian landed safely, Chen Qing, who had been hiding in the dark, hurriedly rushed over and supported Qiao Nian, preparing to take her away!

Qiao Nian subconsciously pushed Chen Qing away and walked towards the main door. She wanted to save Lina. She could not let Lina be in danger!

Her and Gu Zhou’s original plan was that even if they were caught, she and Lina would be caught by Mark together.

Her and Lina’s identities were more sensitive. If Mark caught them, he would only lock them up.

This little girl, Lina, was too stupid. She had pushed her out and was about to face Mark alone even though she was so afraid of him.

Chen Qing grabbed Qiao Nian and lowered his voice. “Young Madam, it wasn’t easy for you to escape. Don’t go in. Mark is ruthless and cunning. It’s too dangerous for you to go in.”

Qiao Nian frowned, her eyes filled with worry. “No, Lina is still inside.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Chen Qing, who had been stopping her, quickly ran towards the main door.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but frown. She grabbed Chen Qing. Chen Qing really cared about Lina, which was why he was so worried about her.

“Chen Qing, don’t go. Your status isn’t enough to negotiate with Mark. You’ll only be sending yourself to death.”

Chen Qing looked at the main door anxiously and quickly said, “Young Madam, I’ll go. General Lin and the others won’t let you in again.”

Chen Qing was strong and dragged Qiao Nian forward.

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, she immediately reacted and hurriedly said, “We’ll inform the president now and get him to come and save her. No matter what, Mark won’t hurt Lina now.”

The reason why Mark forced Wright and Lina to marry was so that he could legitimately take over the entire royal family and naturally become the new president.

Everything Mark had done was so that he could leave a good reputation in history.
