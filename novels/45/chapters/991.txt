992 Old Master Qin?

“Do Big Brother and Second Brother know about these things too?” Lu Jiang looked up at Qiao Nian and asked thoughtfully.

“Before Song Man appeared, I thought that the people who kidnapped me back then did not know of my existence, so Big Brother and I thought that we should not alert the enemy first. I won’t return to the Lu family first. Under such circumstances, we investigated for a long time, but we still found nothing.”

When Qiao Nian thought of Song Man, her expression turned even more serious. “But Song Man’s appearance made me realize that I’ve always lived under those people’s noses. Now that Song Man is dead, I’m afraid those people won’t be able to sit still.”

“It would be better if they gave themselves away. Then, we can investigate the ins and outs of the matter.” Lu Jiang paused for a moment and said, “What exactly do they want to do? If they started planning twenty years ago, they should have obtained a portion of what they want.”

Gu Zhou sat there expressionlessly and said in a low voice, “I think they wanted Old Master Qin and Qiao Nian’s children six years ago.”

Qiao Nian looked up abruptly, slightly stunned. She asked uncertainly, “Did you just say Old Master Qin?”

“Yes, my brother said that he would help me find the best doctor. His name is Old Master Qin. With Old Master Qin around, my illness will definitely recover,” Gu Zhou explained.

Qiao Nian frowned. “Are you talking about Old Master Qin, the Ghost Doctor?”

“Yes.”

“But that’s not right…” Qiao Nian lowered her head and muttered.

“What’s wrong?” Gu Zhou asked.

“Old Master Qin is the grandfather who raised me since I was young. He was also the one who taught me since I was young. I learned my medical skills from him. When Grandpa was young, he would treat people. Later on, when he got older, unless it was his disciple, he wouldn’t treat people.” Qiao Nian explained in detail, “What puzzled me even more was that on the day you and I were schemed against, Grandpa had already disappeared for half a year.”

Gu Zhou frowned and said, “Are you sure he disappeared?”

“Yes, Grandpa usually goes on a long trip. He’ll be back in a month at most. That time, when he didn’t return for three months, my brother and I went out to look for them. My brother said that Grandpa had planned to go to An City previously, and then my brother and I came to An City.” The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the more she felt that something was wrong, but she couldn’t put her finger on it. “I’ve been looking for Grandpa in An City for more than three months, but I couldn’t find him.”

Lu Jiang and Lu Qi fell into deep thought.

Only Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression and asked, “Your brother?”

“Yes, Qin Chuan,” Qiao Nian explained seriously. “My brother organized the charity auction previously. You should have seen him there too!”

Gu Zhou recalled the situation carefully. At that time, all his attention was on Qiao Nian, so he didn’t have a deep impression of Qin Chuan. “I remember that he was also the one who helped you in MY?”

“Yes, indeed.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Gu Zhou tried hard to recall what had happened at the charity auction. At that time, he seemed to have clinked glasses with a well-dressed young man. At that time, he only felt that the owner of the auction was quite young.

However, he had never expected that person to be Qin Chuan.

Qin Chuan was actually Old Master Qin’s grandson?

In large families and under normal circumstances, it was the duty of the descendants to inherit their fathers’ legacies.

Elder Qin was the Ghost Doctor and his medical skills had reached the point of perfection.

The Ghost Doctor, as the name suggested, was a doctor who could snatch people from death. Even the miracle of rejuvenation was not enough to express Elder Qin’s brilliant medical skills.

Why was Qin Chuan in the business world?

If Qin Chuan inherited all of Old Master Qin’s medical skills, he would definitely be sought after by the various large families.

Lu Jiang’s eyes flickered as he asked, “Does the Nanshan Group belong to him too?”

Gu Zhou was slightly stunned. Previously, he had been investigating the background information of the Nanshan Group, but he had not found anything.

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “Yes, my brother is very talented in business.”

Lu Jiang nodded in agreement and said, “I have a lot of information on famous people. Qin Chuan’s background is substantial. The businesses under his name are already all over the world. His Chinese medicine industry accounts for 80% of the market in the country.”

Lu Qi was stunned. She exclaimed, “How amazing. Just the Nanshan Group alone has already made many people envious. He also has holdings in so many other industries.”

“It’s like this. Qin Chuan is really rich.” Lu Jiang knew that the topic had gone astray, so he changed the topic again. “Then did you find Old Master Qin when you arrived in An City?”
