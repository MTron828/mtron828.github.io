836 Meeting

Qiao Nian hurriedly ran out of the car, still holding the DNA test report. She had just taken a few steps when she realized that Gu Zhou and Xiao Shi were standing face to face!

Qiao Nian frowned and slowed down. The air became suffocating, and she couldn’t breathe.

She had wanted to come before Gu Zhou saw her, but she did not expect the two of them to have already met. She was still a step too late.

Sometimes, things were fated. If there was no time in life, one should not force it. It seemed that all of this was fate.

Qiao Nian sighed sadly.

Qiao Nian walked towards Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou turned to look at Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian looked travel-worn, and her eyes were a little dark. It seemed that she hadn’t slept all night.

Qiao Nian was still holding a document in her hand. Her face was a little pale.

Gu Zhou seemed to have thought of something. His eyes darkened, and there was a thick fog in them.

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened, and his expression darkened.

Chen Qing, who was standing at the side, looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. He didn’t understand why Second Young Master was angry.

Xiao Shi had never expected her father to become so cold. She was stunned and did not know what to do.

The air grew heavy.

It was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

Chen Qing’s gaze fell on Li Qing’s face. In order to break the deadlock, he smiled and said, “What a coincidence, Young Madam. We meet here!”

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t reply, Chen Qing laughed a few more times to ease the awkwardness.

Chen Qing stopped laughing. It was too awkward to laugh alone.

Gu Zhou’s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a bone-chilling coldness. He pursed his lips tightly. “Unfortunately, she chased after me. She was just afraid she wouldn’t make it in time!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she sighed silently in her heart. She lowered her gaze in disappointment. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She was still a step too late.

She had never expected to confess this to Gu Zhou in such a way.

She looked away in disappointment.

Now that their family was reunited, she was like a sinner who had stopped them from reuniting.

At this moment, Song Man walked out. When her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s well-defined side profile, she felt that Cupid’s love arrow had already pierced her heart.

She had seen Gu Zhou five years ago. At that time, Gu Zhou was also very handsome, but the current Gu Zhou was even more handsome and charming than before.

Gu Zhou was like a cold young master in a comic book. He exuded a noble aura, like a flower on a high mountain. No one dared to touch him, afraid that they would blaspheme him.

Song Man lowered her gaze slightly, her lips curving up slightly. According to Gu Zhou’s intelligence, he should have known who she was long ago!

He didn’t expose her. Only then could he give Qiao Nian a fatal blow.

Song Man walked to Xiao Shi’s side and gently held her hand. A gentle smile appeared on her face, and her tone was slightly distant. “Sir, why are you here so early?”

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the woman’s face. He inadvertently saw her broken arm and made a decision.

Although his memories of that night were a little blurry, the only thing he was sure of was that the girl was healthy.

Song Man’s heart was beating rapidly, as if it would jump out of her mouth in the next second.

She had never seen such a handsome man. At the thought that she would become his wife in the future, her heart raced.

Being able to marry Gu Zhou was the greatest honor of her life.

Thinking about it this way, the pain she had suffered in the past no longer mattered.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Song Man was about to ask more when she saw that Gu Zhou was already looking at Xiao Shi.

When Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi, his eyes softened. “Xiao Shi?”

Xiao Shi looked at Gu Zhou with a red face and nodded.

Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi’s face gently. This face was exactly the same as Gu Qi’s. He could vaguely see himself as a child.

“Has Xiao Shi already seen her Brother?”

Xiao Shi nodded and said, “Yes!”
