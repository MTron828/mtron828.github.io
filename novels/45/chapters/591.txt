Chapter 592: Emphasis on Bloodline

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After Matriarch Gu spoke, she seemed to remember something and asked, “If there’s something wrong with your health, you should go and get a check up quickly so I can get a great-grandson soon.”

When Gu Zhou heard Matriarch Gu’s words, he frowned and said, “There’s nothing wrong with me. We haven’t slept together.”

“What?” Matriarch Gu was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. She instantly exploded. “Why? Nian Nian is such a good young lady. How can you do this?”

“It’s not a good time to have a child,” Gu Zhou said in a low voice.

“I’m not saying that you should have a child now. Even if the two of you don’t want a child, you should still consummate the marriage. Do you know that by doing this, you’re treating Nian Nian coldly?” The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the angrier she became. With her grandson’s actions, if Nian Nian found out the truth, things would be troublesome.

“Treating her coldly?” This was the first time Gu Zhou had heard this.

“In marriage, if there’s no sex, you’re being cold. It’s also a form of domestic violence.” The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the more stifled she felt. She hurriedly said, “It’s better to make things clear to Nian Nian as soon as possible. No matter what Nian Nian chooses, you should accept it.”

“Okay,” Gu Zhou agreed.

Matriarch Gu couldn’t say much either. She knew that Gu Zhou knew what he was doing. If she said too much, it would be counterproductive.

Gu Zhou followed Matriarch Gu out of the house, but he recalled how Qiao Nian had been frightened on the mountain last night. Something big had happened to her in the past.

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened.

Qiao Nian came out of the kitchen. The servants had already prepared the food. She prepared to go upstairs and call Gu Qi, Grandma, and Gu Zhou down for dinner.

Just as she reached the stairs on the second floor, she saw Matriarch Gu and Gu Zhou enter Gu Qi’s room. Smiling, she walked over.

When Matriarch Gu saw Gu Qi, she felt as if a huge rock was pressing down on her chest. She walked up to Gu Qi. “Little Qi.”

Gu Qi lowered his gaze and said nothing.

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Qi and frowned. Little Qi had not been like this before.

Previously, Gu Zhou had vaguely realized that Gu Qi was pretending to be autistic, but he could not expose him directly. He lowered his voice and said, “He doesn’t speak much now.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Qiao Nian walked in and said with a smile, “Grandma, the food is ready. We can eat now.”

Seeing that Gu Qi was motionless, Matriarch Gu frowned and sighed helplessly.

“Little Qi, let’s go downstairs for dinner!” Qiao Nian walked over to Gu Qi and said gently.

Gu Qi looked up and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He nodded solemnly.

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Qi in surprise.

Qiao Nian naturally took Gu Qi’s clothes over and helped him put them on. Only then did she help him put on his shoes and get out of bed.

Qiao Nian led Gu Qi to the front, followed by Gu Zhou and Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu frowned at Gu Zhou and asked in a low voice, “The two of them…”

“Little Qi likes her very much.”

Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian’s back with heartache. Sigh, she could only blame herself for being soft-hearted and agreeing to let Gu Zhou marry the daughter of the Qiao family.

Qiao Nian was so obedient and kind. She would only acknowledge Qiao Nian as her granddaughter-in-law in her life. If Gu Qi’s mother returned, she would have no choice but to chase her out.

Sometimes, one had to choose without hesitation.

When she arrived at the hall on the first floor, Matriarch Gu saw Qiao Nian sitting beside Gu Qi, smiling as she picked up some food for him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Matriarch Gu had also taken care of Gu Qi for a period of time. Gu Qi didn’t like to speak and didn’t seem to have any energy to do anything.

But now, Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian with sparkling eyes. He really liked Qiao Nian.

Forget it, let nature take its course!

At the thought of this, Matriarch Gu’s heart ached even more for Qiao Nian. Her grandson was really not worthy of Nian Nian!
