1018 Escape Lu

Lu Zhu was helpless.

Back then, when he found Sugar in MY, he wanted to bring her home directly. However, there were many doubts about Sugar’s kidnapping and murder. He couldn’t bear to put her in danger.

Moreover, how great would it be to be able to speak to his sister in private? He wanted to monopolize her for a while.

Sugar was like a little angel to Lu Zhu.

However, to Lu Zhu, Lu Qi was a mischievous child.

They had the same parents. How could they have two sisters with such different personalities?

Lu Zhu glared at Lu Qi. “You’re really something. When you need me, you’re my biological sibling. We’ll share blessings and hardships together. When you need someone to take the blame, you’ll push me out to block the disaster. You’re really my good sister.”

When Lu Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, his eyes were filled with laughter. He said, “Brother, have you forgotten that everyone calls her Escape Lu because she’s the first to escape every time something happens?”

Lu Qi simply threw all the problems at them. She did not bear any responsibility.

The brothers were dissatisfied with Lu Qi’s shameless actions. She had gone too far, so they had no choice but to give her a nickname. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lu Qi raised her arrogant little face and snorted unhappily. “Brother, I advise you to confess. This was your fault to begin with. Moreover, I only just found out that Sister is still alive.”

Lu Qi’s eyes darted around and she quickly walked to Matriarch Lu’s side. Holding Matriarch Lu’s arm, she began to act like a spoiled child again. “Grandma, actually, Big Brother didn’t hide this matter on purpose. The reason why he didn’t tell you was because he wanted to give you a surprise. At the same time, he wanted Sister to slowly accept us. Grandma, on account that Big Brother found Sister, don’t be angry with him, okay?”

Lu Rao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Has the sun risen from the west today? You actually know how to say something humane!”

“Third Brother, you’ve gone too far!” Lu Qi pouted at Lu Rao and complained unhappily, “This is really too unfair. I protest, but you keep saying that I’m Escape Lu. Why does Sister’s nickname sound so good? Even if my name isn’t Sugar, I can still be called Sweet. You guys don’t treat me with love at all!”

Matriarch Lu was initially a little angry, but when she heard Lu Qi’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh in anger.

Lu Qi was a clown and a happy person.

“You’re really good with words!” Matriarch Lu smiled at Lu Qi.

“Grandma, give me a nice nickname. Sister’s nickname is Sugar, and Sister Song Yu’s nickname is Yu Yu. I want a nice and cute nickname too.” As Lu Qi spoke, she glanced at Song Yu.

When Song Yu received Lu Qi’s gaze, her heart warmed and her lips curved up slightly.

When Qiao Nian and Matriarch Lu reunited just now, she felt like an outsider. If a reporter were here and saw her speechless, he would definitely not believe that she was the smooth-talking Song Yu.

Seeing their entire family gathered together, she realized how different a family member was from an outsider.

Even though she had grown up in the Lu family and had been with them for more than ten years, she was no match for Qiao Nian, who had just returned home.

Was blood relations really that powerful?

Song Yu lowered her gaze and thought of Song Xue’s face.

Logically speaking, she and Song Xue were biological sisters and were related by blood. They should be a real family. Why did she feel that Song Xue was unfamiliar and terrifying?

Song Xue couldn’t figure out their relationship.

She smiled at Qiao Nian.

When Auntie Cao heard Lu Qi’s words, she glanced at Qiao Nian. Her frown deepened as she questioned, “Eldest Young Master, is Miss Qiao Nian really the eldest daughter of the Qiao family? Recognition is not a small matter. Shouldn’t you show evidence? You have to convince the public.”

As soon as she said this, everyone’s gaze fell on Auntie Cao.

Matriarch Lu was slightly stunned. Auntie Cao was an elder of the Lu family. Auntie Cao had raised all the children of the Lu family.

Song Yu noticed that everyone in the Lu family had changed their expressions, especially her eldest brother. Her eldest brother was frowning.
