Chapter 120 Greatly Wronged

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Hence, most people stood on Qiao Xin’s side. One by one, they began to criticize Qiao Nian.

“Qiao Nian, you can’t bully your sister just because she’s kind!”

“Isn’t that so? I think Mr. Su doesn’t want to be with Qiao Nian because she’s arrogant, domineering, and crazy.”

“Qiao Nian, you said that you cultivated the Suranne Grass. You have to provide evidence. Forget it, there’s something wrong with your brain. You probably don’t even know what evidence is!”

When Qiao Xin heard that everyone was speaking up for her, her eyes instantly turned red. Her tears fell one by one, and she looked at Su Yan with tear-stained cheeks. “Brother Su Yan, please convince Sister. Don’t let

her delay Director Lin’s opening ceremony just because she wants to get your attention.”

Su Yan had never liked Qiao Nian to begin with. Seeing how Qiao Nian was flinging her weight about in an inappropriate situation, he was so angry that he nearly vomited blood. “Qiao Nian, look at yourself. In what way Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

do you think you can compare to Qiao Xin? You’re like a shrew right now. You don’t even look like a daughter of a high-class family. Hurry up and get lost. Don’t embarrass yourself here!”

Director Lin, who was standing at the side, frowned. He had watched Qiao Nian grow up. How could he let her be bullied by outsiders?

With a dark expression, Director Lin said coldly, “Mr. Su, before we investigate this matter thoroughly, you still have to watch your words!”

Su Yan froze when he heard Director Lin’s words, his expression faltering. He had never expected Director Lin to speak up for Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian was a lunatic. Everyone present knew about this. Why was Director Lin still defending a lunatic?

However, he couldn’t afford to offend Director Lin. He could only control his temper and say, “I’m sorry, my heart ached for Qiao Xin just now. I couldn’t help it!”

Qiao Xin looked at Su Yan, touched. She gently consoled him. “Brother Su Yan, don’t worry. I’ll be fine. I’m used to it. Don’t offend Director Lin over such a small matter.”

“And you!” Director Lin frowned, his expression displeased. “I’m opening my research institute today. Why are you crying?”

Qiao Xin bit her lip, aggrieved. One by one, her tears fell in silence.

Lin Tao was amused by Qiao Xin’s pretentious, pitiful manner. She stepped forward and said, “Dad, why are you being so fierce? If Miss Qiao Xin sues you for scaring her and asks us for compensation, what should we

do? But she’s right. No matter what happens, evidence is important. As long as we have evidence, we’ll know if Miss Qiao Xin has been wronged.”

With that, Lin Tao gave Qiao Nian a reassuring look.

Qiao Nian smiled but didn’t say anything.

Qiao Xin bit her lip. She wasn’t a fool. How could she not tell that Director Lin’s precious daughter was on Qiao Nian’s side?

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Director Lin looked at Qiao Nian gently and said, “Nian Nian, think about it. Is there anything that can prove that you were the one who cultivated the Suranne Grass?”

Actually, Director Lin was already certain that Qiao Nian was the one who had cultivated the Suranne Grass. However, he couldn’t favor Qiao Nian so blatantly in front of everyone. As long as Qiao Nian could provide

evidence, the bad reputation Qiao Nian had gained today would be forgotten. The onlookers would no longer think that she was a lunatic who bullied her younger sister.

“There’s no need.” Qiao Xin wiped her tears and stepped forward, tears swirling in her eyes. “Since Sister said that she cultivated the Suranne Grass, then she must have done so. As long as Sister is happy, it’s fine if I

suffer a little!”

Qiao Nian’s expression turned cold. Qiao Xin’s casual words had confirmed that Qiao Nian was a lunatic, as well as made clear the accusation that Qiao Nian had stolen her Suranne Grass.

Su Yan’s heart ached when he heard Qiao Xin’s words. “Xinxin, you’re always so kind. Although she’s your older sister, that doesn’t mean that you have to give in to her in every way!”

The surrounding guests looked at Qiao Xin’s aggrieved expression and nodded in agreement.

Qiao Xin didn’t speak. She just stood there with her head lowered, looking extremely dejected.

Everyone looked at Qiao Xin with heartache, each feeling that she had been greatly wronged. They despised Qiao Nian even more!
