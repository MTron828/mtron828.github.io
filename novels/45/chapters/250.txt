Chapter 251: Imposter

Brother Cao almost vomited blood. He said disapprovingly, “Can you not speak so harshly? The young lady said that her arm wasn’t feeling well, so she didn’t perform well. I think she’ll definitely be able to play a better tune next time.”

Dong Hua shook her head in disapproval. He was now very certain that she wasn’t the one who had played the violin that day.

“Dong Hua, let me tell you something serious. The concert is coming up soon, and the position of the female musician can’t be left empty. I’ve gone to look for others, but there are very few female musicians who can meet your requirements. To be precise, there aren’t any,” Brother Cao said helplessly.

Seeing that Dong Hua remained silent, Brother Cao continued to persuade him. “In my opinion, let’s use her for now. Let her practice for a while, and make do with what she has for now. If it really doesn’t work out, then let’s find someone else. Although this young lady has some ulterior motives, she doesn’t have any ill intentions. Let’s give the young people a chance!”

When Dong Hua heard Brother Cao’s words, he pursed his thin lips and frowned involuntarily. He said unhappily, “Am I someone who can make do with what I have? She doesn’t have any ill intentions? Isn’t she harboring ill intentions by impersonating someone else?”

Brother Cao was speechless. He walked out.

However, after taking two steps, Brother Cao recalled that Xia Xue had only come to the training room after changing her clothes. He gradually stopped in his tracks.

If he wasn’t wrong, Xia Xue should already know his identity.

In that case, did Xia Xue really do it on purpose?

Brother Cao suppressed his anger. Dong Hua had never taken music lightly, which was why he could create many perfect songs. This was also why tickets to Dong Hua’s concert were so difficult to come by.

Brother Cao turned to open the door of the box and asked Dong Hua who was playing the violin. “Since you’re not satisfied with her, what should we do?”

Dong Hua played the violin twice, as if recalling the tune he had heard yesterday afternoon. He said softly, “Since she wants to be my female musician so much, let her be. Tell her now.”

Brother Cao almost vomited blood. Was he hallucinating?

“What did you say? You want her to be your female musician?” Brother Cao’s temples were throbbing. He was so angry that his head hurt!

“Yes, she’ll do!”

“Actually, I think she’s not suitable either. Why don’t we look for the girl again in the school?” Brother Cao asked with a smile.

Dong Hua put away his violin. His gaze fell on Brother Cao’s face and he said with certainty, “She’ll do.”

“Why? Weren’t you unwilling just now?” Brother Hao felt that he was understanding Dong Hua less. He said uneasily, “If there’s something wrong with her character, and this matter gets exposed, it won’t be good for your reputation. Moreover, you’ve already said that she doesn’t even meet your standards. She’s an imposter…”

Dong Hua nodded.

“You already know that she’s an impostor. Why did you still choose her?” Brother Cao was even more confused.

Dong Hua’s phoenix-like eyes flashed. He said calmly, “I believe that she will definitely help us find the person I want!”

Brother Cao instantly understood. Then, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he said with a smile, “You’re really something. So this is what you’re planning. You don’t tell me everything clearly every time and let me guess for a long time.”

After complaining, Brother Cao looked at Dong Hua worriedly. “But I’m a little worried. The concert is about to begin. There’s not much time left. What if we can’t find the violinist?”

Dong Hua said calmly, “It’s precisely because time is tight that she will do everything she can to find that person. We just have to wait for good news.”

Brother Cao nodded. He would do as Dong Hua said.
