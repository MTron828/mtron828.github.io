As Su Sheng thought about this, she recalled that she had been a little fierce to Qiao Nian previously. She wondered if Mr. Dong Hua would dislike strong girls.

Su Sheng’s heart was racing. She looked at Mr. Dong Hua uneasily. Seeing that Mr. Dong Hua was neither speaking to his senior sister nor looking at her, she heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that Mr. Dong Hua was not angry with her.

Seeing Mr. Dong Hua walking towards Qiao Nian, Su Sheng’s lips curved into a mocking smile.

It seemed that Qiao Nian was going to be in big trouble this time.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Nian like this. Her breathing softened, and her eyes were filled with gentleness. When Lu Nian walked up to her, she called out softly, “Brother Ah Nian!”

When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian speak to Lu Nian, she frowned. She had a bad feeling.

Could it be that Lu Nian and Qiao Nian were close?

Su Sheng thought of Lu Zhu again. He addressed Qiao Nian as Nian Nian.

She instantly understood. Qiao Nian must have relied on her looks to befriend those rich and powerful men.

Su Sheng despised women who had multiple partners.

She had also noticed Mr. Dong Hua’s expression just now. If Mr. Dong Hua really treated Qiao Nian as his sister, he definitely wouldn’t be angry because Qiao Nian had touched the piano.

However, Mr. Dong Hua was indeed angry just now. This meant that he didn’t take Qiao Nian seriously.

Lu Nian’s gaze lingered on Qiao Nian’s face. His narrow phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, and finally landed on the piano.

The expression in his eyes grew more and more complicated. His slender fingers gently pressed on the keyboard.

The piano made a low sound, which seemed especially abrupt.

Seeing Lu Nian’s actions, Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Was Second Brother worried that she would damage the piano?

She was just playing the piano. How could she ruin it?

“Why did you enter that room?” Lu Nian’s gaze was fixed on the piano. He narrowed his eyes slightly, then looked up at the wooden door not far away.

Qiao Nian looked in the direction Lu Nian was pointing. A trace of confusion flashed in her eyes.

Previously, when she stood at the door, she had a faint strange feeling. Moreover, that door seemed to be very attractive, attracting her to push it open and enter.

But in the end, rationality prevailed. She didn’t push the door open.

She could sense that behind that door was definitely Second Brother’s most precious item.

Everyone had a secret in their hearts. She didn’t want her secret to be exposed, so she felt that Second Brother definitely didn’t want his secret to be discovered by others.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Nian. His tone was very certain, as if he was very sure that she had already entered that room.

Qiao Nian said calmly, “I didn’t enter that room.”

“No?” Lu Nian’s voice rose slightly. It was obvious that he didn’t believe Qiao Nian’s words.

“Yes, Brother Ah Nian’s piano room should have surveillance cameras. Why don’t you pull up the surveillance cameras and take a look? Then you’ll know if I’m lying.” Qiao Nian didn’t understand why Lu Nian insisted that she had entered that room. She pursed her lips slightly and said seriously.

When Lu Nian heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes. He frowned slightly.

He knew Qiao Nian well and knew that she wasn’t lying.

He had specially written this song for Sugar more than twenty years ago, and no one knew about it.

Then how did Qiao Nian know?

Strange.

Could something have gone wrong? Had his song been leaked?

Su Sheng stood at the side, her gaze fixed on Lu Nian’s face. Her eyes were filled with obsession. She could tell that the song Qiao Nian had played just now should have been newly composed by Mr. Dong Hua, but Qiao Nian had played it first.

She glanced at the door not far away.

Since that song was new, the score was probably behind that door. Qiao Nian must have memorized the score after entering the room and came out to play it on the piano.

Qiao Nian had actually stolen Mr. Dong Hua’s score.

Su Sheng pursed her lips tightly. Even if she hadn’t fallen in love with Mr. Dong Hua, she was still a fan of Mr. Dong Hua. She would never tolerate Qiao Nian stealing the score!
