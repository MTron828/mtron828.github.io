1198 Unwilling

When Jiang Yue met Boss Jin’s gaze, a flirtatious smile appeared on her face. She shook her head. “Godfather, I only want to be with you for the rest of my life!”

Thank you readers!

A trace of a smile flashed in Boss Jin’s eyes, but it quickly disappeared.

The onlookers looked at Jiang Yue sympathetically.

The conversation between Boss Jin and Jiang Yue just now was often heard in such circles, but in the end, all women were sent out by men.

To men in the circle, women were just toys. As long as they had brains, everyone was willing to use a toy to obtain greater benefits.

Although Jiang Yue had curried favor with Boss Jin, she would probably suffer in Ye Sen’s hands.

Boss Jin turned to look at Ye Sen, the smile on his face unchanged. He said, “Mr. Ye Sen, I’m afraid I won’t be able to do as you wish. Yue’er isn’t willing to do this.”

Ye Sen picked up a tissue and wiped the saliva from the corner of his mouth. He casually threw the tissue onto the plate in the waiter’s hand and said casually, “Master Jin, doesn’t your woman listen to you? How dare she say that she refuses? As long as you’re willing to ask her to come over, she’ll definitely come over obediently!”

Ye Sen’s attention was all on Jiang Yue’s face, as if she was already his.

Ye Sen couldn’t help but reach out to grab Jiang Yue’s hand.

However, before Ye Sen’s hand could touch Jiang Yue’s, a cold light appeared. A cold dagger pierced into Ye Sen’s palm and pierced through his entire hand.

For a moment, Ye Sen lost control and screamed, “Ah!”

Ye Sen hurriedly retracted his hand. Looking at the dagger in his palm, he was in so much pain that tears were about to fall.

How dare someone hurt him?

This person really didn’t care about his life!

Ye Sen looked at Boss Jin angrily and said, “Boss Jin, how dare you stab me? You don’t want to work with me anymore!”

Ye Sen’s mind raced. When he returned, he would definitely cancel his collaboration with Boss Jin. He would never work with Boss Jin again

At that time, even if Boss Jin knelt in front of him and begged for mercy, he would never be soft-hearted!

Boss Jin didn’t seem to see the coldness in Ye Sen’s eyes. He looked at him coldly and asked, “She’s my woman. No one is allowed to touch her. Even if the collaboration between our two families is ruined, I can still work with others!”

This was simply outrageous!

Ye Sen had already become a local tyrant in the east district. He was fearless. This time, he encountered someone who disobeyed him. He was so angry that his expression changed.

“You…” Ye Sen was so angry that his mouth was trembling. He panted heavily. “Someone!”

Boss Jin stood calmly on the spot and glanced coldly at the people around him. He did not take them seriously at all.

Jiang Yue stood rooted to the ground with a cold expression, as if she was not afraid at all.

Lu Jiang frowned, his eyes cold. With one hand in his pocket, he walked over. His gaze landed on Ye Sen’s face, and there was an undeniable sense of oppression in his eyes, making Ye Sen shiver. “Mr. Ye Sen, today is the stone gambling banquet I’m hosting. I’ve always advocated peace, but if anyone insists on causing trouble, I’ll definitely cause trouble with you to the end.”

Cold sweat broke out on Ye Sen’s back. He did not dare to look into Lu Jiang’s eyes at all, but when he thought about how Boss Jin, that fat pig, had caused today’s incident, he glared at him angrily. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That damn fat pig started it!” Ye Sen said, raising his right hand, which had been pierced by Boss Jin. “Look, I’m injured!”

Lu Jiang glanced at Boss Jin and Jiang Yue indifferently. He looked at Ye Sen again and said, “You touched his woman, and he only retaliated. It’s very fair!”

Fair?

How was that fair?

Ye Sen suddenly stood up straight and pointed at Boss Jin’s face not far away. “I clearly…”
