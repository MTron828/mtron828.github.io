Chapter 335: Aggrieved

Qiao Nian hurriedly nodded. All she wanted now was to get Gu Qi back.

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. He reached out and snatched Qiao Nian’s phone away.

Qiao Nian reached out to snatch the phone away, but Gu Zhou avoided her hand. She looked at Gu Zhou unhappily and frowned slightly. “Why are you taking my phone?”

“You should rest early. There’s an auction tomorrow that I need you to attend.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “What auction?”

Moreover, in her memory, Gu Zhou had never liked such occasions.

Gu Zhou seemed to be able to read Qiao Nian’s mind. He said unhurriedly, “It’s just a charity auction. Grandma has always been a philanthropist, so she has accepted the invitation from the organizers. However, she’s not in good health. I want to attend on her behalf.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she lowered her gaze slightly, thinking seriously.

Charity…

Could it be that Qin Chuan had held the auction she had prepared for in advance?

That shouldn’t be possible.

She remembered that the auction should be next month.

At this thought, Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and asked, “Who’s the organizer?”

“Qin Chuan!”

It was really him.

What the hell was Qin Chuan doing? Didn’t he say that he would wait until the sixth of next month?

She had been preparing for this auction for two whole years, and there were still some priceless items that she had yet to prepare. Why had Qin Chuan started early?

“Aren’t you going?”

Just as Qiao Nian was thinking about why Qin Chuan had brought forward the auction, she heard Gu Zhou’s question. She said, “I’m just thinking about what my identity will be when I attend it.”

“Then what identity do you want to have?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Gu Zhou in surprise.

Had she gone silly just now? Why did she ask that?

Fortunately, Gu Zhou did not dwell on her question. He continued, “This auction is different from the previous ones. Everyone can take out a precious item for auction. Of course, you have to prepare one yourself.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian smiled. “Alright, I understand.”

Just as Gu Zhou was about to return the phone to Qiao Nian, he accidentally saw a familiar WeChat profile picture on her phone.

His brow furrowed slightly. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian noticed Gu Zhou’s gaze and hurriedly stood up to snatch the phone back from him. Smiling, she said, “Since it’s getting late, you should rest early!”

Gu Zhou didn’t answer Qiao Nian immediately. Instead, he was still thinking about the WeChat profile picture he had just seen.

That profile picture was identical to Gu Qi’s.

He didn’t think it was Gu Qi.

It was impossible for Gu Qi to add Qiao Nian on WeChat. Even if Gu Qi had accidentally added Qiao Nian on WeChat, it was impossible for Gu Qi to call Qiao Nian on WeChat. Gu Qi had autism and rarely spoke to outsiders.

More importantly, Gu Qi had never called him on WeChat. He was the closest person to Gu Qi.

Perhaps that person just had Gu Qi’s WeChat profile picture.

Gu Zhou no longer hesitated. He picked up his bathrobe and walked towards the bathroom.

When Qiao Nian snatched her phone back, she realized that Gu Qi had already added her. She heaved a sigh of relief and couldn’t help but smile. Then, she sent an aggrieved emoji.

Soon, Gu Qi replied.

“Auntie, I wasn’t the one who deleted you just now.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and asked, “Then what happened?”

Actually, she was also puzzled just now. Gu Qi was a little boy who was willing to treat her to a meal. How could he delete her WeChat just because she didn’t reply immediately?

Moreover, even if Gu Qi was on guard, he was an honest child. Even if he deleted her WeChat, he would return the money to her first.

At this moment, Gu Qi replied.

“Just now, when the teacher saw me playing with my phone, she got very angry. She said that I didn’t want to play with my friends because I didn’t want to improve myself. She said that she wanted to help me correct my bad habits, so she took my phone and deleted all my friends on it. I just got my phone back.”
