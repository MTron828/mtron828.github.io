Chapter 303: Lesson

Gao Lin gave Qiao Nian a sidelong glance, her eyes filled with disdain. She pretended to fan the air in front of her nose.

“Oh my, why does it smell so bad? No wonder I smell like a fox. So it’s the woman who is relying on an old man. How disgusting. Qiao Nian, how many men do you have to take care of every day?”

Wang Xuan frowned. Just as she was about to scold Gao Lin, Qiao Nian stopped her.

Qiao Nian stepped towards Gao Lin.

Gao Lin looked at Qiao Nian, suddenly frightened by her aura. “You… you want to do…”

Bam!

The crisp sound of the slap reverberated throughout the classroom.

All the students in the classroom were stunned.

Even Gao Lin, who had been hit, could not regain her senses for a long time.

Qiao Nian straightened her back and her gaze fell on Gao Lin’s face. She raised her eyebrows slightly and said coldly, “It’s useless to speak up when dealing with people like you, who are full of shit. I have to attack directly.”

Wang Xuan looked at Qiao Nian with starry eyes.

Wow!

Qiao Nian was too cool!

She had really learned something!

Gao Lin had never suffered such humiliation before. She was so angry that her eyes turned red. She wanted to hit Qiao Nian back, but when she thought of how Qiao Nian had defeated four classmates last time, she instantly chickened out.

Gao Lin sniffed and questioned, “Are you angry out of humiliation? Are you desperate? If you have the ability to do it, don’t be afraid of others saying it. You’re a whore, yet you still want to set up a memorial arch!”

Bam!

Qiao Nian gave her another slap.

The entire class was so shocked that their eyes were about to fall out of their sockets. At this moment, they were all shocked by Qiao Nian’s cold aura.

Oh my god, Qiao Nian was so bold!

How dare she?

One had to know that if one hits someone in school, they would be expelled.

Wasn’t Qiao Nian afraid of being expelled?

“How dare you hit me?” Gao Lin looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief, her tears falling uncontrollably. If looks could kill, Qiao Nian would have died a thousand times over.

Qiao Nian took out a tissue and gently wiped the hand that hit Gao Lin. She said casually, “So what if I hit you? What can you do?”

Gao Lin stomped her foot and said angrily, “Just you wait. I’ll go look for the dean now. You’ll definitely be expelled!”

“Then go! We’ll see who gets expelled first.”

Gao Lin’s eyes widened in anger. She said furiously, “I’ll go to the dean with this face. I’m injured. He’ll definitely believe me!”

Gao Lin took a step forward and continued, “Don’t think that just because those old men who are supporting you are all powerful, you can do whatever you want in An City. Let me tell you, this school is run by Principal Lu. No one in An City dares to go against him!”

Qiao Nian crossed her arms and raised her eyebrows slightly. She said, “If you didn’t mention it, I would have forgotten. If Principal Lu finds out that the three of you casually slandered your classmates and said that their private lives were indecent, wouldn’t such a person be expelled?”

Gao Lin was stunned.

Three?

How did Qiao Nian know that there were three of them? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If she remembered correctly, Qiao Nian had never seen Liu Yu before.

All the onlookers turned to look at Gao Lin. They could smell gossip.

A trace of a smile flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. She continued, “Oh, right, I remember now. Did you lie to Brother Cao and snatch someone else’s place?”

“What nonsense are you spouting!” Wang Lin roared in exasperation.

“Why are you throwing a tantrum? Let me tell you, on account that we were classmates, I’ll give you twenty minutes to go to the radio room with Xia Xue and Liu Yu. Then, you’ll apologize to me in front of the entire school. Moreover, you’ll have to make Xia Xue admit that she stole someone else’s position as Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. You’ll also have to admit to everything you’ve done outside the school!”
