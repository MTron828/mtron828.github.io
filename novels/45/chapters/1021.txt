1022 Apologizing

The Lu family’s own paternity test center was one of the authoritative paternity test centers in the country. Aunt Cao naturally did not doubt the authenticity of the report, but could this report have been tampered with?

With Gu Zhou’s ability, it was very likely that he would change the data before the appraisal report was released, causing the results to be inaccurate.

Aunt Cao narrowed her eyes slightly. Qiao Nian was definitely not a simple person. To be able to make Gu Zhou fall head over heels for her, she was also a capable person.

Why was Qiao Nian pretending to be the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

!!

Could it be that there was something in the Lu family that Qiao Nian wanted?

Auntie Cao handed the phone to Lu Zhu and said calmly, “Matriarch, I think Eldest Miss might still be alive. I wonder where Miss Qiao Nian got Eldest Miss’s sample from. Or has Miss Qiao Nian already privately changed the test results?”

“Enough!” Matriarch Lu’s expression was ugly as she interrupted Auntie Cao angrily. She did not expect Auntie Cao to say such ugly words.

Auntie Cao bit her lip slightly, but she still braced herself and continued, “Matriarch, I really don’t think it’s Miss Qiao Nian. Miss Qiao Nian clearly has all four limbs, and back then…” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Enough!” Matriarch Lu interrupted Auntie Cao unhappily again. Qiao Nian was her granddaughter. She believed that Lu Zhu wouldn’t lie to her. If she looked carefully, she could vaguely see Sugar’s expression on Qiao Nian’s face. “Are you questioning her? You’re clearly making things difficult for her. Previously, when you didn’t see any evidence, you said that she wasn’t Sugar. Now that she’s already shown evidence, why are you still saying that she isn’t Sugar? Are you only satisfied if my granddaughter dies?”

When Auntie Cao heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she knew that she was angry. She said with a terrified expression, “That’s not what I meant. It’s just that Eldest Miss lost an arm back then. Now that Miss Qiao Nian has all four limbs, I just think we have to figure this out!”

“How can I not recognize my granddaughter?” Matriarch Lu questioned coldly.

When Auntie Cao heard Matriarch Lu’s words, a trace of surprise flashed across her face, but she couldn’t say anything now. She knew very well that Matriarch Lu hoped that the eldest daughter of the Lu family could return the most.

Auntie Cao sighed slightly. It was useless for her to say anything now, because Matriarch Gu only had Eldest Miss in her heart.

It seemed that she had to keep a close eye on Qiao Nian. She didn’t know what Qiao Nian wanted to do to the Lu family.

“Shouldn’t you be apologizing now?”

Gu Zhou’s cold voice interrupted Aunt Cao’s thoughts.

Auntie Cao’s face turned slightly pale. She had worked for the Lu family for more than 30 years, and the masters of the Lu family respected her very much.

Now, she had to apologize to Qiao Nian in front of these people. She couldn’t bring herself to do so. After all, she was also a reputable person in the Lu family.

If she apologized to Qiao Nian now, how could she have the face to stay in the Lu family in the future?

Auntie Cao frowned slightly. Her gaze landed on Matriarch Lu. She had a good relationship with Matriarch Lu. Now, she only hoped that Matriarch Lu could help her out.

When Matriarch Lu received Auntie Cao’s gaze, she silently looked away. She had already said that Qiao Nian was her granddaughter, but Auntie Cao was still criticizing her. She was clearly cursing her eldest granddaughter to die!

Auntie Cao looked away from Matriarch Lu in disappointment. She looked at the young masters and young ladies of the Lu family, but no one was willing to stand up for her.

She felt abandoned by everyone.

Auntie Cao felt as if she had been slapped hard in the face. She wished she could find a hole to hide in.

“I’m sorry, Eldest Miss. I misunderstood you just now. Please forgive me.”

Qiao Nian glanced at Auntie Cao and lowered her eyes slightly, her expression cold. “I’m a magnanimous person. Auntie Cao, remember to write those words with a brush and hand them to me. You’re an old figure in the family. With you around, I don’t think anyone else in the family will dare to question my identity!”

Auntie Cao was slightly stunned. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.
