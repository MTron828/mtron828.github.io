Chapter 329: Dead

Ye Ran raised the bat and looked at Gao Lin. She was about to hit her again when she saw Gao Lin’s legs twitch a few times. Soon, there was no reaction.

Seeing this, Ye Ran didn’t hit her. Instead, she kicked Gao Lin’s shoulder and mocked, “Hey, why are you pretending to be dead? I haven’t even started!”

Gao Lin remained motionless on the ground.

The others turned pale with fear.

In the crowd, someone asked in fear, “Is… is she dead?”

Uneasiness and fear enveloped everyone.

A bold hooligan moved closer to Gao Lin and placed his hand under her nose. She fell to the ground in shock and said in a panic, “She’s… she’s dead. She’s really dead…”

When Ye Ran heard this, her muddled mind instantly cleared. Only then did she see that the person lying on the ground was not Qiao Nian, but Gao Lin. “Read more on newn 0vel`o rg”

Ye Ran’s breathing quickened and the baseball bat in her hand fell to the ground. She was so frightened that her face turned pale.

Gao Lin deserved to die too!

What a bootlicker!

At this moment, in the stadium.

Holding a violin, Qiao Nian walked calmly to the curtain. The person behind the curtain was Lu Nian. She turned her head and saw Lu Nian sitting not far away.

......

Lu Nian sat next to the piano like a prince. He placed his slender hands on the piano and moved slightly, like the gentle waves in the morning.

He narrowed his eyes, enjoying the feeling the stage gave him.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s entire world was illuminated.

Lu Nian no longer looked as lazy as he usually did. Instead, he looked calm.

Suddenly, Lu Nian opened his eyes. His beautiful phoenix-like eyes were shining. He turned to look at Qiao Nian and nodded gently.

Qiao Nian understood. She stood up and bowed to the audience.

She had tied her hair up in a bun today, revealing her beautiful facial features. Her fox-like eyes were smiling. Under the contrast of the white gown, she looked pure and charming, making one unable to look away.

At this moment, the entire venue erupted.

“Oh my god, is she the legendary Qiao Nian?”

“I think so.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I heard that she’s a country bumpkin!”

“She doesn’t look rustic at all. Looks like the countryside is still the best. The air is fresh, and she’s simple. She has such a good temperament!”

“I heard that she’s also the principal of An University.”

“For her to be chosen by Mr. Dong Hua, she must be outstanding in some way!”

“I’m suddenly looking forward to her performance.”

“I wonder if she’s better than the female musician who was announced previously!”

“She’s so young, yet she can stand here so calmly. Her courage is commendable!”

…

When Qiao Nian heard everyone’s words, her heart warmed.

These were Mr. Dong Hua’s true fans. They were well-educated and outstanding!

At this moment, the sound of the piano was heard. Qiao Nian picked up the violin in her hand and closed her eyes. She followed Mr. Dong Hua’s rhythm, enjoying the beauty of the music.

Everyone closed their eyes to admire the music. They felt as if they had returned to their childhoods. Then, they saw themselves busy building their careers. After that, they saw their outstanding selves.

It was as beautiful and pleasant as water.

Moreover, the sound of the violin combined with the music of the piano was simply breathtaking!

When the song ended, everyone present began to clap happily.

“Oh my god, she’s really a treasure. She’s simply breathtaking.”

“To have such ability at such a young age, she’s simply a replica of Mr. Dong Hua!”

“Her music has its own style, but it doesn’t disrupt Mr. Dong Hua’s music just to show off her own style.”

“Oh my god, what should I do? I actually feel that these two people are a good couple. Am I sick?”

“No, I think they’re a couple too!”
