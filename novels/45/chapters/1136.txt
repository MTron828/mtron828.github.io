1137 She is so beautiful today!

Qiao Nian was very nervous. In the end, she put on her makeup three times before changing and following Gu Zhou downstairs.

Winter days were very short. When she went downstairs, the sun was already setting. Gu Zhou had brought the two children home!

Qiao Nian glanced at the time. It was already five in the evening.

When the father and children saw Qiao Nian, they were all stunned!

!!

Qiao Nian was wearing a light purple short down jacket with a white sweater underneath. A white cashmere scarf hung around her neck. Standing under the afterglow of the setting sun, she looked even gentler than before, giving off a peaceful feeling!

She was wearing a pair of black jeans that perfectly displayed her straight and slender legs!

Xiao Shi looked at Qiao Nian in a daze. She felt that her mommy was like a fairy who had walked out of a painting!

Seeing that Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were silent, Qiao Nian smiled and walked up to them. She squatted down and kissed each of their foreheads. Smiling, she asked, “Why didn’t the two of you call Mommy?”

“Mommy, you’re so beautiful today!” A sweet smile appeared on Xiao Shi’s face as she exclaimed, “You’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen! I was stunned just now.”

Gu Qi came back to his senses and nodded seriously.

Mommy was so beautiful!

Indeed, his mommy was the best mommy in the world!

“Mommy, you’re dressed so well. Are you taking me out to play?” Xiao Shi looked at Qiao Nian expectantly and asked happily.

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she felt a little guilty. After she found the two children, she had never had time to go out with them. Every time, she could only accompany them in the Gu family villa.

Children were playful by nature, and she still didn’t fulfill her duty as a mother.

Holding Xiao Shi’s hand, Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly and said guiltily, “Xiao Shi, after Mommy is done with this, Mommy will bring you and Xiao Qi out to play, okay?”

Xiao Shi nodded obediently. “Mommy, are you going out?”

“Yes, I’m going to see my mommy now.” Qiao Nian moved closer to Xiao Shi’s face and kissed her chubby little face.

“Mommy is going to see Grandma? Then can Xiao Shi and Brother go together? Xiao Shi also wants to see Grandma and Grandpa. When the time comes, we can also see Uncle and Aunt!” Xiao Shi said happily. She glanced at Gu Qi and saw that her brother was also excited.

Xiao Shi’s voice was soft when she talked about her Grandma. Qiao Nian couldn’t refuse.

However, she didn’t know what would happen in the Lu family either. She felt worried if she brought the child over.

Gu Zhou also noticed the yearning gazes of the two children. Smiling, he picked them up and said gently, “Xiao Shi and Xiao Qi, this is the first time your mommy will be seeing her mommy. She’s very nervous now. I’ll bring you along next time I have time, okay?”

“Okay.” Xiao Shi recalled the first time she had seen her father and couldn’t help but feel nervous. She grabbed her mommy’s hand and said seriously, “Mommy, don’t be afraid. Grandma must like you very much. After all, you’re her daughter. Xiao Shi will cheer for Mommy at home.”

“Thank you, Xiao Shi.” Qiao Nian smiled and patted Xiao Shi’s head. Although she was gratified that Xiao Shi could stay at home obediently, her heart still ached for her.

Gu Qi walked up to Qiao Nian and hugged her. Xiao Shi silently took a step back and stood to the side.

Smiling, Qiao Nian hugged Gu Qi tightly and said gently, “Be good. Be good at home.”

Gu Qi rested his chin on Qiao Nian’s shoulder and said softly, “Mommy, congratulations!”

Qiao Nian’s thoughts instantly returned to when she had pretended to be Gu Qi’s Auntie to see Gu Qi at kindergarten. At that time, she had just gotten to know Gu Qi and was chatting with him. She even wanted to help Gu Qi find his mommy.

After so long, Gu Qi still remembered what the two of them had said.

“We’ve all found our family!” Gu Qi said softly.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but hug Gu Qi tightly. At that time, neither she nor Gu Qi had ever thought that she was his biological mother.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
