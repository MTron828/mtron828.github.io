Chapter 362: Giving Her A Way Out

“I also believe Miss Song’s words.”

“Is there a need to think about such things? An City is only so big. I’ve never seen Miss Qiao at any of these auctions in the past, but Miss Song is at every charity auction, so I believe that her painting is definitely real.”

“Young lady, I know you want to ride on Miss Song’s coattails, but what you’re doing will make people hate you!”

…

Qiao Nian wasn’t angry at all when she heard their words. She could even understand what they were saying.

In the past, Song Yu had done a lot of charity work, and she had helped many children from poor mountains. She had changed her fate, and she didn’t deny that.

Moreover, she had never appeared in the upper-class circle of An City before, so it was normal for everyone to be suspicious of her.

However, this didn’t mean that the painting in Song Yu’s hand was real.

A trace of a smile flashed in Song Yu’s eyes. She pursed her lips and gave Qiao Nian a way out. “Miss Qiao, did the person who gave you this painting lie to you? Or did the person who gave you this painting not know that this painting is fake?”

Qiao Xin had initially believed Qiao Nian, but seeing Song Yu’s calm demeanor, she couldn’t help but believe her.

Qiao Xin’s lips curved up slightly. Qiao Nian had met her match this time. There would be a good show to watch.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. Her gaze fell on Song Yu’s face and she said with a smile, “Miss Song, you can also think carefully. Have you been deceived by someone?”

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, everyone present sighed.

......

Qiao Nian was truly a shameless person.

“Has water gone into this Qiao’s brain? She doesn’t know what’s good for her!”

“How dare she suspect that our Goddess Song is a fake? Who is Goddess Song? She’s a woman who stands at the top of the pyramid. How can she be deceived? Qiao Nian doesn’t even know how to speak properly. She should think about it!”

“Everyone, don’t stoop to her level. She’s just a doctor. She hasn’t seen much of the world!”

“She was on the trending searches two days ago. How can she be so stupid?”

“I know. She’s a female musician personally invited by Mr. Dong Hua.”

“I went to the concert too. She’s indeed a musical genius, but her EQ is a little low!”

“Alright, everyone, don’t be so calculative. No one is like Miss Song. Not only is she good-looking, but she’s also very smart!”

“That’s true. She’s just an ordinary person. Unfortunately, she has such good looks!”

…

Lu Nian’s phoenix-like eyes swept across everyone, and a trace of coldness flashed in them. His voice was slightly cold as he said, “The matter hasn’t been concluded yet. Isn’t it a little too much for everyone to make such a casual conclusion?”

Hearing Lu Nian’s words, Song Yu’s breathing quickened. She looked at Lu Nian in disbelief.

Second Brother…

Why would Second Brother speak up for Miss Qiao?

Song Yu pursed her lips.

Suddenly, a different voice sounded. Everyone looked over.

When the socialites present saw that man, they all blushed.

Oh my god, there was actually such a beautiful man in this world!

Unparalleled. This word had already paled in comparison to him.

When Song Yu’s fans saw such a good-looking man, their expressions instantly darkened. They hurriedly retorted.

“What do you know?”

“Yes, Miss Song would never malign him!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Just look at how arrogant he is. If I didn’t know better, I would have thought that he was Mr. Nan Chuan!”

…

Gu Zhou’s expression instantly darkened. His deep voice echoed throughout the banquet hall. “We should take out Doctor Qiao’s stone wall painting and let professionals appraise it at the same time. We shouldn’t be judging the authenticity of the painting without any evidence!”
