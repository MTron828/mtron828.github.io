Chapter 292: I Don’t Mind

Qiao Nian’s face was a little red. Silently, she looked away.

Was her question just now really ambiguous?

Just as Qiao Nian was beginning to doubt herself, she heard Gu Zhou say unhurriedly, “If you want to pay attention to other aspects of my life, I don’t mind.”

Qiao Nian was shocked.

Oh my god!

Qiao Nian felt a little suffocated.

Gu Zhou was truly bold.

How could he say such vicious words?

Qiao Nian coughed and sat up straight. In all seriousness, she said, “There’s really no need. I’m your doctor. I just need to pay attention to your health!”

“Mrs. Gu, you’re my wife. You can also try my body to see if you’re satisfied?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Qiao Nian’s ears turned red.

What? Try his body?

How could he have the nerve to say such a thing?

Chen Qing, who was driving, felt a chill run down his spine when he heard Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s words. Shouldn’t such intimate words between husband and wife be whispered in the room?

What did Second Young Master mean by this?

Was he bullying him for being single?

Chen Qing’s heart collapsed.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath. She didn’t want to talk about such ambiguous topics anymore. Casually, she asked, “You and Mr. Dong Hua are as close as brothers. Will you attend his concert as well?”

Gu Zhou didn’t answer. Instead, he took out a ticket from his pocket and handed it to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian took it and looked at it. Only then did she notice the serial number on the ticket.

521!!!

Qiao Nian looked shocked.

Gu Zhou said lightly, “I’ll sit next to you!”

Only then did Qiao Nian realize that Matriarch Gu had been planning this for a long time!

“Are you going?” Qiao Nian asked with mixed feelings.

Gu Zhou pondered for a moment and said seriously, “You’ve already said that we’re like brothers. It won’t be good if I don’t go!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

She retracted her gaze and looked ahead. Her gaze fell on the familiar streets and she hurriedly stopped Chen Qing. “Stop for a moment.”

Chen Qing pulled the car to the side and turned to look at Qiao Nian. “Madam, what can I do for you?”

A trace of a smile flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. She said, “There’s a restaurant selling spicy duck necks that I haven’t eaten in a long time. I wonder if it’s still open.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned. “Is the spicy duck neck edible?”

Qiao Nian asked, “Can’t I eat instant noodles?”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Chen Qing sat in the driver’s seat, suppressing his laughter. If he were to laugh, his year-end bonus would be in jeopardy.

Without another word, Qiao Nian got out of the car.

She had just taken a few steps when she heard the car door open again. She turned around and saw Gu Zhou walking towards her.

Qiao Nian stopped in her tracks. When Gu Zhou walked up to her, she smiled and said, “The spicy duck neck is really delicious!”

This was an alley leading to An University. All kinds of snacks were placed on both sides of the alley.

This was the famous food street of An University.

Qiao Nian really hated herself for not having two more stomachs. Otherwise, she would have eaten the entire street.

She was going to save her stomach for her favorite spicy duck neck.

From afar, Qiao Nian could see that the shop was still open. Her fox-like eyes instantly narrowed to a line. Her lips curved up slightly as she ran over quickly, saying excitedly, “Boss, I want a spicy duck neck for fifty yuan. Thank you.”

Gu Zhou walked over and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He had rarely seen Qiao Nian so happy. Suddenly, he was curious about what kind of delicacy the spicy duck neck was.

Gu Zhou followed Qiao Nian’s gaze and saw a cabinet filled with duck necks of several flavors. However, these items looked a little dirty.

Gu Zhou frowned. Was this thing edible?
