897 Buttoning

Gu Qi pulled Xiao Shi towards the stairs. When he passed by Gu Zhou, he pursed his lips and smiled, saying nothing.

Only Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were left in the living room.

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. She was extremely nervous, but she didn’t show it on her face.

She didn’t know why she was so nervous. She had been alone with Gu Zhou in the past. At that time, she had always been very calm and wasn’t so impatient.

Could it be that Gu Zhou had become even more alluring than before?

Qiao Nian had always been the kind of person who faced difficulties head-on.

Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. In her high heels, she walked towards him.

When she walked up to Gu Zhou, she looked up at the man in front of her.

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, as if Qiao Nian was a delicious snack that he yearned to eat in one bite.

Qiao Nian pretended to be calm. She raised her hand and naturally tidied Gu Zhou’s collar.

“Actually, just unbuttoning one button is enough!” As Qiao Nian spoke, she was about to help Gu Zhou button up the second button.

However, when her hand inadvertently landed on Gu Zhou’s collarbone, there were still some sparkling water droplets on his collarbone. Perhaps he had just taken a shower.

His collarbone was a little cold. Qiao Nian’s hands were trembling.

Her trembling hands wanted to button Gu Zhou up, but they trembled even more. The button seemed to be going against her as well, and she couldn’t button it no matter what.

For a moment, Qiao Nian didn’t know what to do. If she retracted her hand now, would Gu Zhou think that she was deliberately taking advantage of him?

At this moment, Gu Zhou grabbed her right hand.

His hand was big enough to completely cover hers.

Qiao Nian wanted to pull her hand away, but halfway through, she saw Gu Zhou holding her fingers tightly.

While Gu Zhou was staring unblinkingly at her, his lips gently planted a kiss on the back of her hand.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.

Although Gu Zhou’s skin was a little cold, his kiss on the back of her hand was as hot as a fire.

His deep eyes were fixed on her. There was no trace of desire in them, only love.

Qiao Nian felt the heat on the back of her hand flowing through her blood. Her entire body was burning, and her heart was beating rapidly. Her mind was in a mess.

Gu Zhou didn’t let go of Qiao Nian’s hand. Instead, he held her hand tightly and interlocked his fingers with hers.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was a little distracted, he gently scratched her palm.

Although his movements were very light, his presence was especially strong.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and raised his eyebrows slightly. “Mrs. Gu, what were you thinking when you saw me just now?”

Not only was the man good-looking, but his voice was also pleasant to the ear. He also emitted a faint fragrance. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

It was simply a feast for the eyes!

If she didn’t bite, she would be letting herself down.

Qiao Nian had been too embarrassed to voice her thoughts, but when she thought about how the two of them had already almost slept together in the hospital, she realized that there was no need to hide anything!

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian’s clear and seductive fox-like eyes met Gu Zhou’s. Her red lips parted slightly. “Of course I’m reminiscing about our time on the hospital bed…”

Not only was Gu Zhou not angry, but his eyes were also filled with smiles. He smiled slightly and said proudly, “It seems that Mrs. Gu and I really have a connection!”

His eyes gradually dimmed and were filled with lust.

Qiao Nian looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes, feeling her mouth go dry. Her gaze gradually moved down, staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou’s lips.

She didn’t expect this man to be so good at flirting.

She looked at his lips in a daze. Thinking of the pleasure of kissing in the ward, she licked her lips.

Gu Zhou seemed to have read Qiao Nian’s mind. He asked gently, “Mrs. Gu, why don’t we revisit what happened in the ward?”

Qiao Nian looked at his thin lips, which were opening and closing. Deep down, she was willing. Gradually, she stood on her tiptoes and raised her head slightly. When her lips were about to touch Gu Zhou’s, her heart began to race.

“Second Young Master!”

Chen Qing’s anxious voice came from the stairs again.
