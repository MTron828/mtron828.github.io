“Nian Nian is a good girl. When she got married, we didn’t prepare a grand wedding for her either. If the master hadn’t said that you needed to keep a low profile for the wedding, I would have let Nian Nian marry into the Gu family in a glamorous manner no matter what.” Matriarch Gu thought of the previous situation and frowned. She said unhappily, “After Nian Nian married into the Gu family, she took good care of us. Previously, Jiang Yue bullied her so much, but she endured it!”

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze and listened calmly to Matriarch Gu’s scolding.

“After Nian Nian married into the Gu family, under her care, your health has gradually improved.” Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Zhou’s face, which was slightly flushed. He was much better than before. “Little Qi was an accident back then. We should have made things clear to Nian Nian instead of hiding it from her. She’s so good to you. How can you bully her? You can’t even be honest with her?”

Gu Zhou pursed his lips tightly, turning pale.

“Ah Zhou, I know you want women. Those women will come over with a wave of your hand, but have you ever thought about why those women are following you? It’s either for you or for the Gu family’s assets.” The more Matriarch Gu spoke, the more uncomfortable she felt. “But Nian Nian is different. I can tell that she’s not the kind of girl who can’t live without love. She’s very independent. She won’t care about the Gu family’s assets. It’s your blessing to marry her!”

Gu Zhou had not expected Grandma to like Qiao Nian so much.

He naturally understood what Grandma meant. It was precisely because he understood very well that he didn’t dare to take the risk.

Seeing that Matriarch Gu’s breathing was getting more and more rapid, Gu Zhou hurriedly helped Matriarch Gu ease the tension in her back.

“Grandma, don’t be angry.”

“How can I not be angry?” When Matriarch Gu was agitated, she couldn’t help but cough twice. She turned to look at Gu Zhou. “You might not like what I’m about to say, but listen to Grandma. It’s definitely right.”

“I was very dissatisfied with what your mother did back then. If she had listened to me, our family wouldn’t have become like this.” Matriarch Gu frowned, her expression dim. “I’m old, and I’ve experienced more things than you have. Listen to Grandma. Some things shouldn’t be hidden…” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Grandma.” Gu Zhou naturally knew what Matriarch Gu wanted to say next. He said calmly, “Help me hide this matter first.”

Gu Zhou knew that although Matriarch Gu liked Gu Qi, she did not think highly of him. This was because Gu Qi was not of the orthodox bloodline. In ancient times, Gu Qi could be considered the son of a concubine. It was already a great blessing that he could be raised in the Gu family villa.

Moreover, he and Qiao Nian were a married couple. Even if they didn’t hold a wedding, in Grandma’s eyes, Qiao Nian was the official wife. His and Qiao Nian’s child was the child of the Gu family who was from the legitimate bloodline.

However, in Gu Zhou’s opinion, Gu Qi was innocent. His birth was not his and Gu Qi’s biological mother’s fault, but those behind the scenes.

All these years, Gu Qi had been living outside and could not stay in the Gu family villa. Not only that, he had not been by Gu Qi’s side in the past. Gu Qi had been alone, and his body and mind had been hurt.

He recalled how the nanny had mistreated Gu Qi, and his heart couldn’t help but ache.

He didn’t want Gu Qi to live alone like before.

“Then are you planning to keep it a secret forever?” Matriarch Gu raised her eyebrows in disapproval.

When Gu Zhou heard Matriarch Gu’s words, he said, “I’ll leave the rest to time.”

Matriarch Gu wanted to say something, but no matter how she thought about it, she didn’t know what to say. She felt very upset.

Previously, she had also been very conflicted. She thought that Gu Zhou should be the one to speak about this, so she remained silent.

Gu Zhou spoke again. “I didn’t have the time to take good care of Little Qi in the past either. This time, I want to make it up to him.”

Matriarch Gu lowered her gaze and said indifferently, “I want to see your and Nian Nian’s child as soon as possible.”
