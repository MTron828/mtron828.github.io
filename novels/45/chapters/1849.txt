Qiao Nian had just noticed that her grandfather looked like he wanted to say something but hesitated. Now that she heard her grandfather’s words, she understood and asked, “Grandpa, are you talking about magnolia-bark?”

One of the effective medicinal ingredients for treating cerebral palsy was magnolia-bark. However, the magnolia-bark’s living conditions were harsh, and it was difficult to cultivate artificially. Coupled with the excessive use by humans in the early years, there was not much magnolia-bark left now.

Most importantly, wild magnolia-bark was more effective. It was best to use wild magnolia-bark for Madam President’s illness.

Although the Lu and Gu families were powerful, medicinal herbs like wild magnolia-bark could only be chanced upon by luck, unless some people were really willing to sell them for money.

Although Madam President’s cerebral palsy could be cured soon, it couldn’t happen without medicinal ingredients.

Qiao Nian knew that Madam President had definitely seen Song Lings subordinates. Perhaps she could find information about Song Ling from those people. When that happened, she would be able to capture Song Ling and the others.

Only when there were no enemies would they be truly safe.

Now it was just the calm before the storm.

Old Master Qin continued, “I just took her pulse and realized that she’s been in a good mood recently. She’s in the most suitable state for acupuncture. If we can find all the medicinal herbs, she’ll probably be cured of her cerebral palsy in two days.”

Hearing Old Master Qin’s words, Qiao Nian nodded slightly.

Madam President’s emotions were more erratic. Perhaps a small matter would make her feel low. Although she wouldn’t show her displeasure, a low mood wasn’t suitable for acupuncture.

Hence, what Grandpa meant was that if they couldn’t find the medicinal ingredients now, it would take a long time if Madam President’s emotions to change,

When that happened, it would be very difficult for them to investigate the remaining clues.

Qiao Nian couldn’t wait to know the truth, so she agreed immediately.

“Grandpa, I’ll try my best to bring magnolia-bark over tomorrow morning.”

When Old Master Qin heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. Puzzled, he asked, “Do you have magnolia-bark?”

Old Master Qin couldn’t help but laugh. He said gently, “Nian Nian, these medicinal herbs are all relatively precious. I don’t know when you’ll be able to find them. Take your time. Don’t give yourself too much pressure.” “Grandpa, why would I make things difficult for myself?” Qiao Nian would act like a little girl in front of Old Master Qin. She blinked mischievously.

“No,” Qiao Nian said firmly.

“Although I don’t have magnolia-bark, I still have four brothers. I think my brothers might have one. Besides, even if they don’t have magnolia-bark, as long as they work hard to find it, they’ll be able to.”

When Old Master Qin heard Qiao Nian’s words, he laughed out loud. His Nian Nian was as mischievous as ever. “You’re as mischievous as when you were young. Alright, I’ll stay here and help Madam President treat her illness as soon as possible. Tell Ah Chuan that he doesn’t have to pick me up.”

“Yes.” Smiling, Qiao Nian took Old Master Qin’s arm and leaned her head gently on his shoulder. “Grandpa, thank you. I’ll bring the good wine over later and let you drink to your heart’s content.”

Old Master Qin didn’t have many hobbies. He just liked to drink wine.

“Okay,” Old Master Qin agreed lovingly.

Qiao Nian had a lot of good medicinal ingredients, but she didn’t have any good wine. However, she knew where to find a lot of good wine.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face not far away.

Gu Zhou looked down at his phone with a serious expression.

Qiao Nian noticed that something was wrong with Gu Zhou’s expression. She immediately stood up and walked towards him.

Before she could walk to Gu Zhou’s side, he had already locked his phone.

“What happened?” Qiao Nian asked tentatively. Gu Zhou frowned slightly. It was obvious that something was ffffong.

“It’s just a small matter,” Gu Zhou said casually. When his gaze fell on Old Master Qin’s face, a smile appeared in his eyes. ‘Grandpa wants to drink wine, right? I’ll go back and get it now.”

Qiao Nian felt that Gu Zhou was very sensible. She smiled and nodded.

“Alright, I’ll go back and settle that matter first. When I come over later, I’ll bring you the wine,” Gu Zhou said very calmly..
