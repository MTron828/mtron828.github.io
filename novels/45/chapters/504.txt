Chapter 505: Lying!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Song Yue frowned.

How could that be?

This couldn’t be happening!

Relatives were not allowed to donate blood. Qiao Nian donated blood to Lu Zhu, so Qiao Nian must have been lying just now.

Qiao Nian was too sinister.

Qiao Nian must have deliberately pretended to be Lu Zhu’s sister to get close to him.

When the time came, Qiao Nian would stand up and confess that she and Brother Lu Zhu were not siblings. By then, Lu Zhu might have long fallen in love with Qiao Nian and chosen to be with her.

This wouldn’t do!

She couldn’t let Brother Lu Zhu be manipulated by Qiao Nian.

She had to find a suitable time to let Lu Zhu understand that this was all Qiao Nian’s scheme. When that time came, Lu Zhu would definitely fly into a rage and chase Qiao Nian away.

She could take the opportunity to comfort Brother Lu Zhu. Brother Lu Zhu would definitely change his opinion of her and be with her.

Thinking of this, Song Yue felt happy.

… .

Qiao Nian held Lu Zhu’s arm and entered the elevator.

Recognizing her family was only the first step in her plan. If she wanted to return to the Lu family openly, she would have to investigate the kidnapping case back then.

Qiao Nian had a feeling that since the kidnappers had been able to kidnap her so easily back then, it meant that someone must be helping them. Moreover, it was very likely that this person was still in the Lu family.

At this thought, Qiao Nian turned to look at Lu Zhu and asked curiously, “Brother, did you catch that kidnapper back then?”

Lu Zhu was also thinking about this matter. If his sister was still alive, it meant that the kidnapping back then was not that simple. It must have been premeditated.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s question, Lu Zhu said thoughtfully, “Back then, we caught the kidnappers. They also admitted to all the crimes they had committed. The court also sentenced them to death. Those three people have already been shot to death. The money on them has also been recovered.”

As Lu Zhu spoke, his expression darkened. At that time, even though the three kidnappers had been captured, his sister was no longer around.

Fortunately, his sister was still alive!

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Why did she feel that this matter was a little strange?

If the kidnappers really only wanted money, why fake her death?

However, what puzzled Qiao Nian was that since she wasn’t dead, why had she become the Qiao family’s daughter?

What was the Qiao family’s involvement?

What puzzled Qiao Nian the most was that if those people had deliberately brought her out of the Lu family, they must have had other motives.

However, in all these years, she had not been pressured by any major powers.

Could it be that the person behind this really thought she was dead?

That was why she had survived death.

It was the only possibility.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s breathing deepened, and cold sweat broke out on her back. She was a little worried.

Seeing Qiao Nian frown, Lu Zhu knew that Qiao Nian had guessed what had happened back then.

Those people must have thought that Qiao Nian was dead, so they didn’t continue to attack.

If Qiao Nian returned to the Lu family now, those people would definitely kill her again.

The moment Lu Zhu thought about losing Qiao Nian again…

His heart lurched. He couldn’t bear to think about it.

Twenty years ago, he was a child that was too young to protect his sister.

But now, he was an adult. Even if he had to give up his life, he had to protect his sister from any more harm. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lu Zhu knew that it was impossible for him to stay by Qiao Nian’s side 24 hours a day. Hence, he didn’t dare to risk Sugar’s life.

He couldn’t afford to gamble. He couldn’t afford to lose Sugar again.

In that case, he would have to give up the thought of spending more time with Sugar for now.

“Sugar, if someone schemed to kill you back then and you return to the Lu family now, you will be in danger. Our operations have to be more secretive. I don’t think we can reveal your identity yet,” Lu Zhu said.
