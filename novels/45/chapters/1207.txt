1208 Nervous

Qiao Nian was a cautious person. Since Mr. Chen had nothing to do with that matter, there was no need for her to ask. After all, the fewer people who knew about her background, the better.

“Mr. Chen.”

Just as the atmosphere in the room was extremely awkward, Gu Zhou called out.

Everyone’s gaze was attracted to Gu Zhou. They looked at him in confusion.

Mr. Chen took the last drag of his cigarette, then shook his hand and placed the cigarette butt in the ashtray.

“What can I do for you, Mr. Gu?” Mr. Chen looked at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou’s dark eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze darkening. He looked at Mr. Chen and asked tentatively, “Mr. Chen, do you know my brother, Gu Yue?”

Mr. Chen leaned back on the sofa casually, his right leg crossed over his left. There was a faint smile on his face. “Mr. Gu Yue is very well-known. Many of his businesses are in MY. Previously, we were lucky enough to work with Mr. Gu Yue and have interacted with him many times.”

Gu Zhou did not speak. He just stared unblinkingly at Mr. Chen, as if he was not satisfied with his answer.

However, from another perspective, if Mr. Chen really had nothing to do with his brother, then whatever he was right.

How many powerful people in the world didn’t know his brother?

He had a nagging feeling that Mr. Chen’s actions were similar to his brother’s, but he knew in his heart that Mr. Chen had been by Old Master Cui’s side for more than twenty years. He was not someone who had appeared out of thin air, let alone someone who could disguise himself casually.

“Mr. Chen, have you seen my brother in the past two years?” Gu Zhou asked, unwilling to give up.

Mr. Chen had been playing with the lighter in his hand. When he heard Gu Zhou’s question, he stopped what he was doing. “If I remember correctly, Mr. Gu Yue should have disappeared seven years ago.”

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze, feeling a little uncomfortable.

Mr. Chen put the lighter into his windbreaker pocket and stood up to tidy up his clothes. “Everyone, if there’s nothing else, I’ll leave first.”

Everyone stood up and watched as Mr. Chen left.

Mr. Chen walked to the door of the room and reached out to open it. He looked back at Gu Zhou with a complicated expression, but he quickly retracted his gaze and walked out.

After Mr. Chen left, only four people were left in the room.

Gu Zhou sat there in disappointment. He had never been an emotional person, let alone sentimental.

In the past, he had always thought that everything was his brother’s fault, but later on, he realized that he had always misunderstood his brother. His brother had always cared about him and even wanted to find Old Master Qin to treat his illness.

He really hoped to find his brother as soon as possible so that he could reconcile with him.

Qiao Nian sat down beside Gu Zhou. She could feel the sadness emanating from Gu Zhou. She reached out and held his hand, comforting him in a low voice. “Don’t worry, we’ll definitely find Big Brother in the future.”

Gu Zhou retracted his thoughts. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he nodded seriously.

…

Rolls-Royce.

Mr. Chen sat in the back seat. He turned to look out of the window. His hands were trembling slightly, and his heavy breathing indicated that he was uneasy.

He clenched his fists tightly and closed his eyes to hide the turbulence in them. He heaved a sigh of relief.

When he opened his eyes again, they were calm. They were no longer as turbulent as before. He looked as if he had seen the vicissitudes of life like an old man.

The man sitting on Mr. Chen’s left said, “It’s indeed been a long time since we last met.”

“Yes.” Mr. Chen’s lips curved up slightly, but it quickly disappeared. He turned to look out of the window. The hotel kept retreating and quickly disappeared from his sight.

Mr. Chen sighed. In the blink of an eye, six years had passed. He said in a low voice, “He looks much more mature than before. He actually looks like a human.”

Mr. Chen still remembered the person from his youth. He looked cold and lifeless. If he didn’t still have a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, he would have suspected that he was a walking corpse.

He paused for a moment and continued, “It’s all because of Nian’er’s efforts that he’s like this now.”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
