Chapter 382: Hatred

?s

Qin Lu clenched his fists tightly and pounced at Qiao Nian.

However, before Qin Lu could get close to Qiao Nian, Gu Zhou kicked her three meters away.

Qin Lu lay on the ground in a sorry state. Her hands were covering the spot where Gu Zhou had kicked her. She felt extremely uncomfortable in her stomach. She had almost vomited everything she had eaten tonight.

Neither Jiang Yue nor Chen Qing had expected Gu Zhou to make a move. They were both stunned.

Jiang Yue frowned slightly as she looked at Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou had actually taken the initiative to attack. For a moment, she felt as if Gu Zhou’s kick had landed on her. Her body trembled involuntarily.

Qiao Nian was also stunned.

Qin Lu finally recovered from the shock. She curled up on the ground and looked at Gu Zhou unhappily, complaining, “You’re too tasteless. You’re a man, yet you hit a woman.”

“Are you a woman?” Gu Zhou glanced at Qin Lu indifferently, his voice cold.

“By calling you a beast, I’ve tarnished the word beast,” Qiao Nian said indifferently.

Just as Qin Lu was about to curse, she met Gu Zhou’s eyes. She trembled in fear at the cold killing intent in Gu Zhou’s eyes, and no longer dared to speak.

This man was truly terrifying!

For some reason, Qin Lu felt that if she got any closer to Qiao Nian, she might die without a burial ground.

Qin Lu bit his lip and looked at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over his face. He said, “Qiao Nian, you caused me to lose my job at An City Kindergarten first. Later, when I entered the charity auction, you caused me to lose face in front of everyone. Now, you’ve caused me to lose the most precious thing I have. Let me tell you, I’ll remember all of this. I’ll never let you off for treating me like this.”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Lu’s words, she didn’t seem to be afraid at all. She shrugged slightly and said, “Children are all flowers of the future, and the hope of the country. You actually abused and bullied children from ordinary families in school. Losing your job as a kindergarten teacher was already a very light punishment. Now that you’ve lost your virginity, you’ve brought this upon yourself. It has nothing to do with me.”

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. An City Kindergarten?

.....

Wasn’t that where Young Master went to school?

Gu Zhou’s eyes narrowed and darkened. He suddenly recalled the time he went to school to look for Gu Qi.

At that time, Gu Qi’s WeChat contacts had all been deleted by the teacher.

At that time, he had gone to the kindergarten to look for Gu Qi. Gu Qi had said, “Teacher Qin has already been expelled.”

Teacher Qin?

Qin Lu?

Gu Zhou glanced at Qin Lu coldly, then at Qiao Nian’s face, deep in thought.

“Miss Qiao, are you alright?”

At this moment, a gentle voice rang out from the side, interrupting Gu Zhou’s thoughts.

Gu Zhou looked over and saw Li Kun leaning against the wall, holding his chest as he walked over from another room.

He remembered that there was nothing wrong with Li Kun’s body. How could he be so weak?

When Qiao Nian heard Li Kun’s voice, her gaze fell on his face. She said worriedly, “You haven’t recovered yet. You need to rest well. You should quickly go back!”

When Li Kun heard Qiao Nian’s words, he shook his head gently. His eyes were filled with so much gentleness that they could overflow. “Thank you for performing acupuncture to save me. I’m already much better than before. Moreover, I’m also a victim in this matter.”

When Gu Zhou heard the words “performing acupuncture”, he felt a little uncomfortable. No wonder he hadn’t seen Qiao Nian downstairs. So Qiao Nian ran upstairs to treat someone.

When Qin Lu saw Li Kun, her eyes instantly lit up. It was as if a person who had always been in the dark had suddenly seen light and hope. “Cousin, you’ve come at the right time. Let me tell you, I’ve been wronged. Moreover, I was knocked out by Qiao Nian and ruined by someone else. Hurry up and help me. Qiao Nian, that b*tch, wants to kill me!”

Gu Zhou’s expression turned cold. How dare she scold Qiao Nian? She must be tired of living.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
