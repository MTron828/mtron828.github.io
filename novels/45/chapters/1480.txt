1481 Losing His Balance

With this thought in mind, Wright stepped forward and reached for Lina’s arm.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She really hadn’t expected Wright to be so crazy. Seeing that Wright still wanted to pull Lina away, she couldn’t take it anymore. She kicked him away.

Wright was kicked to the ground by Qiao Nian. He frowned and snorted, looking at Qiao Nian sinisterly.

Qiao Nian kicked Wright’s assistant. Before the assistant could react, he fell to the ground, screaming. The wooden box in his hand fell towards Wright.

The heart in the box smashed into Wright’s face. Wright hurriedly raised his hand to block the heart, but the bloody heart still dirtied his face.

Wright’s face was covered in blood. He looked at Qiao Nian with a dark expression and casually threw the heart to the assistant. He stood up coldly and said angrily, “Do you know who I am? How dare you treat me like this?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian looked at Wright, her lips curving up coldly. With an innocent expression, she asked, “Aren’t you the one who lost your balance?”

“You…” In a rage, Wright pointed at Qiao Nian’s face.

“What about me?” Qiao Nian glanced at the heart, which was already stained with mud. She said regretfully, “Seriously, why didn’t you send the heart over as soon as possible? A living heart has medical research value. This heart has long lost its research value. You should take care of it yourself!”

A living heart?

Even the cruel Wright was shocked by Qiao Nian’s words.

Only then did he remember the results of his investigation. Qiao Nian was a doctor. Doctors must have done medical experiments on countless corpses.

No wonder Qiao Nian wasn’t frightened!

Wright narrowed his eyes slightly and said darkly, “Qiao Nian, you attacked me. Haven’t you thought of the consequences?”

“None of the people of Country Z are afraid of trouble. Moreover, I’m a dignified person. Why would I be afraid of a beast?” There was a hint of a smile in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She raised her eyebrows slightly. “Don’t you think I’m right?”

The assistant got up from the ground in a sorry state, his legs trembling in fear. This was a human heart. He really didn’t dare to touch it. Holding the wooden box just now had already exhausted all his courage.

The assistant stood up and hurriedly handed a tissue to Wright.

Wright stared at Qiao Nian sinisterly. He took the tissue from the assistant and wiped the sticky stains off his face without hesitation. A bloodthirsty smile appeared on his lips.

A woman like Qiao Nian was like a poppy flower. She was beautiful and alluring, but she was also covered in poison. He knew that he would be injured if he got close to her, but she was fatally attractive.

Wright’s eyes darkened. He took out the pistol from his pocket, flicked off the safety, and aimed it at Qiao Nian’s forehead without hesitation.

The beautiful poppy should die, not appear in front of him.

Qiao Nian stood there calmly, with no intention of dodging.

However, everyone around Qiao Nian, including Chen Qing, aimed their guns at Wright’s face.

Qiao Nian stood there with a smile. There were two deep dimples on her cheeks. Her voice was cold but very firm as she said. “You died because we were protecting the Seventh Princess. I think the President will let you and your father give the President and the Gu family an explanation.”

Wright’s hand, which was holding the gun, trembled slightly. His face grew paler. For the first time, he felt how terrifying this woman was.

Where exactly did she get the guts to not even be afraid of death?

Smart and fearless.

Such a woman was a threat.

Wright narrowed his eyes. Qiao Nian must have known that he didn’t dare to kill her. After all, the entire European country knew that Qiao Nian had saved the Seventh Princess’s life. If Qiao Nian died at his hands, he would probably anger everyone.

Wright was so angry that he put away his pistol and glared at Qiao Nian. “Qiao Nian, you’re quite bold.”

This feeling of being unable to control everything made Wright very uncomfortable. He had no other choice but to be bold.

“Thank you for the compliment.” Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with smiles as she looked at Wright calmly. She liked that Wright couldn’t stand her but couldn’t get rid of her.
