1003 Heartache

When Lu Jiang heard Lu Qi’s words, his lips curved up slightly. When he thought of Xiao Shi’s face, his eyes softened. “Xiao Shi is enough!”

Lu Qi frowned slightly and sighed sadly. “But Xiao Shi is Brother Ah Zhou and Sister’s child. It’s definitely impossible for them to pass Xiao Shi to you!

When Lu Jiang heard Lu Qi’s words, he frowned.

Although he knew that Qiao Nian was Nian’er and the eldest daughter of the Lu family,

But Qiao Nian was already married.

In the past twenty years, he had never interacted with Qiao Nian. His sister had yet to accept his love as her brother, but she had already married into someone else’s family.

At the thought of this, Lu Jiang’s heart ached so much that he could barely breathe.

Xiao Shi’s appearance dissipated a lot of the pain in his heart.

Xiao Shi was still a child around five years old. She was innocent and very adorable.

Subconsciously, he treated Xiao Shi as Nian’er when she was young.

However, she was not Nian’er after all.

Fortunately, Gu Zhou really liked Nian’er. Otherwise, he would definitely have brought her home today.

Moreover, he had also noticed the way Nian’er looked at Gu Zhou. Her eyes were filled with stars. It was obvious that she was very happy.

For his sister’s happy life in the future, he could not attack Gu Zhou either.

Lu Jiang let out a long sigh. He took out his phone and called Lu Zhu.

The call went through very quickly.

Lu Qi looked at Lu Jiang curiously, not knowing what he was thinking.

“What’s wrong?”

Her brother’s voice came through the phone. Lu Qi silently moved closer to Lu Jiang.

Lu Jiang gripped his phone tightly. His voice was cold and his eyes were filled with dissatisfaction. “Have you never thought of telling us that your sister is still alive?”

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Jiang’s tone, he instantly understood.

“I didn’t want to hide this matter, but you weren’t in An City, so I didn’t have time to tell you!”

Lu Jiang smiled disdainfully and asked, “We’re brothers. Do you think I don’t know what you’re thinking?”

Lu Qi, who was sitting at the side, knew that Fourth Brother must be angry.

To be honest, she was still a little angry with her brother.

Why didn’t Big Brother tell her about this?

She was clearly in An City!

Lu Zhu frowned slightly and said with a serious expression, “Lu Jiang, I think you know very well that Sugar is still alive. In other words, the three of them were scapegoats back then. The other party has the ability to kidnap someone in the Lu family, which means that the other party’s strength is definitely not inferior to ours! Of course, the fewer people who know about this, the better. I don’t want her to be in any danger. If it were you, you would probably make the same choice as me and put Sugar’s safety first!”

Lu Zhu continued, “Moreover, do you think everyone in the family will accept a family member who suddenly appeared? What do you think Sugar will think?”

Lu Jiang’s pupils instantly dilated. He had seen many reports in the past about kidnapped children who found their relatives after more than ten or twenty years, but their relatives did not welcome them.

Their relatives were all worried about the children getting a share of the inheritance.

Moreover, the children who had been found did not want to meet their families either.

This meant that the child’s originally peaceful life would be broken. All the relatives he was familiar with in the past would leave.

Lu Jiang recalled that he had wanted to bring Sugar home today, but when he thought of Sugar’s feelings for Gu Zhou and how the two of them had two children, he couldn’t bear to bring Sugar home.

If he forced Sugar to go home today, Sugar would only feel uncomfortable and might even dislike him.

He just wanted to leave a good impression on Sugar.

Lu Jiang’s tone relaxed. “I’m sorry.”

He had been too anxious just now.

He had thought that his brother only wanted to monopolize Sugar.

That was why he was unwilling to tell them about Sugar’s existence.

Lu Zhu’s voice was as calm as ever as he said, “I can understand your current feelings very well. Back then, I couldn’t wait for her to return to the Lu family, but for various reasons, I could only postpone this plan. Fortunately, we’ve already found Sugar. In the future, we can slowly build a good foundation with her. I believe she’ll like us in the future. At that time, our family will really be reunited!”

“Yes!”
