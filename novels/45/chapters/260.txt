Chapter 261: Big Brother

When Qiao Nian walked downstairs, she saw Matriarch Gu chatting with Wang Xuan.

The two of them chatted harmoniously. No matter what Matriarch Gu said, Wang Xuan would always continue the conversation.

Matriarch Gu liked Wang Xuan a lot. She felt that she was an experienced young lady.

Qiao Nian looked around and didn’t see anyone else. Smiling, she sat down next to Matriarch Gu and asked curiously, “Grandma, didn’t you say that there were guests? Why haven’t I seen them?”

At this moment, footsteps came from the stairs.

Matriarch Gu smiled lovingly at the stairs and said, “Speak of the devil. Look, isn’t he here?”

Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan followed Matriarch Gu’s gaze.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She hadn’t expected the distinguished guest Grandma was talking about to be the beautiful man she had just met in the room.

Sitting at the side, Wang Xuan couldn’t help but gasp.

She had never seen such good-looking men in her life!

She even saw two of them at once!

One of them should be Qiao Nian’s husband, who was rumored to be in poor health.

However, both of them seemed to be in high spirits. She didn’t know which one of them was him.

Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu and saw the love and indulgence in her smiling eyes.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Could that man be the missing eldest young master of the Gu family, Gu Yu?

Just as Qiao Nian was guessing who this person was, the man walked over and smiled at Matriarch Gu. “Grandma!”

When Qiao Nian heard the man call her that, she instantly understood. So this person was the eldest young master of the Gu family, Gu Yu.

Matriarch Gu nodded in agreement. She smiled at Qiao Nian and said happily, “Nian Nian, he’s the distinguished guest Grandma told you about!”

Qiao Nian looked up at the man and greeted politely, “Brother.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was stunned.

Gu Zhou frowned as well.

Qiao Nian was sensitive enough to sense that the atmosphere in the room was a little off. She seemed to have mistaken him for someone else, but her words were like spilled water. There was no taking them back.

The flirtatious-looking man smiled. “I’m sorry. This is our first meeting. I accidentally took advantage of Sister-in-law.”

When Qiao Nian heard the man’s words, she smiled lightly and spoke to resolve the awkwardness. “I’m still young. How can I be taken advantage of by calling you big brother?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, the man couldn’t help but glance at her.

This young lady had a high EQ and knew how to speak. Her eyes, in particular, were like those of a cunning fox. When she smiled, she looked like the little fox he had raised at home.

“Sister, you have a point,” the man said with a smile.

In a simple sentence, they had temporarily acknowledged each other as sworn siblings.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. Why wasn’t Qiao Nian usually so obedient?

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. He looked at Matriarch Gu and reminded her, “Grandma, it’s time for the introductions.”

A bright smile appeared on Matriarch Gu’s face. She didn’t expect Nian Nian to be in sync with him. She introduced formally, “Nian Nian, he’s the Second Young Master of the Lu family, Lu Nian. You’ve met his older brother, Lu Zhu, before.”

When Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan heard Matriarch Gu’s words, they were both stunned.

There was another Second Young Master in the Lu family?

They had never heard of it before.

Matriarch Gu seemed to know what they were thinking. She explained, “Ah Nian wasn’t in good health when he was young. Like Ah Zhou, he grew up with me, so not many people in the outside world know about him. This is normal.”

“I see,” Qiao Nian said thoughtfully. No wonder Matriarch Gu had looked at Lu Nian with such gentleness and affection.

No wonder Lu Nian called Matriarch Gu “Grandma” so easily.

Matriarch Gu smiled at Qiao Nian and said, “There’s something else you didn’t expect!”

Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu in surprise.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
