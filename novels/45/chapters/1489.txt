1490 Something’s Wrong

Dr. Ollie moved closer to Qiao Nian and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “In the past, when Madam President flared up, the President would coax her for a while. But this time, Madam flared up so badly that the President had no choice but to get someone to inject a tranquilizer.”

Dr. Ollie frowned. Madam had been injected with sedatives many times. He wondered if Madam’s relapse had something to do with the sedatives.

The bed was surrounded by white curtains. Qiao Nian could vaguely see a person lying on the bed, but she couldn’t see Madam President’s face clearly. She could still see the President sitting in the bed.

Dr. Ollie walked forward and said respectfully, “President, Madam Gu is already here.”

The president’s low and hoarse voice came from behind the bed curtains. “Madam Gu, I’m really sorry. It’s not convenient for my Madam to receive guests in her current condition. Under such circumstances, can you still treat her?”

The president asked uneasily.

Qiao Nian still remembered the president she had seen in the hospital. It was really hard for her to imagine that the president would speak in such a tone. It seemed that Madam President, who was lying on the bed, was the president’s weakness.

Deep down, she hoped that the president was unaware of the kidnapping twenty years ago.

Qiao Nian nodded, then walked to the bed and sat down on the chair by the bed. She said softly, “I’ll take Madam’s pulse first. Please hand over Madam’s hand.”

“I see.”

The president nodded. Then, the bed curtains moved slightly. Qiao Nian saw a slender hand appear by the bed.

The skin on her wrist was pale and vaguely purple.

Qiao Nian took a closer look at her wrist and frowned imperceptibly.

Dr. Ollie, who was standing at the side, saw Qiao Nian frowning, and his heart began to race nervously. He had some knowledge of Chinese medicine. He had heard that doctors in Country Z would place their hands on the patient’s wrist to take their pulse. Why wasn’t she placing her hand there?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and placed her hand on Madam President’s wrist.

Dr. Ollie placed his fingers on his wrist in a practiced manner, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly, listening to her pulse. Her expression grew more and more serious, and her frown deepened.

Dr. Ollie couldn’t be bothered to learn the way Qiao Nian took her pulse anymore. He looked at Qiao Nian uneasily, his heart in his throat.

The president sensed that Qiao Nian had been taking her pulse for a long time. His breathing involuntarily intensified, and he was so nervous that he wanted to get off the bed.

Qiao Nian’s hand was still on Madam President’s wrist. After some thought, she asked in a low voice, “President, are you sure Madam has cerebral palsy?”

His eyes darkened. It had been more than twenty years. Every doctor who had treated Madam had confirmed that she had cerebral palsy. It was impossible for this to be wrong.

Qiao Nian’s dark eyes dimmed, and she frowned.

However, her pulse just now was a little strange.

Qiao Nian frowned. Previously, she had taken the pulse of a patient with cerebral palsy. It definitely didn’t resemble Madam’s.

Moreover, Madam’s skin was a little purple. This was clearly not a normal situation.

She had not seen Madam with her own eyes now, so she could not be sure of her condition.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian asked, “Have you changed the things around Madam? Or have the people around her changed them?”

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s question, he said, “Half a month ago, we encountered an assassination in the villa area. I felt that there was a huge security problem there, so I brought her back to the palace.”

The president paused for a moment before saying, “But Yan’er still lives in the villa area because of school. I told her and she didn’t doubt my words back then.”

Qiao Nian smiled. Previously, they had heard that the president’s villa was in their neighborhood. Today, they were treating Madam President and realized that she was in the palace. So it was because they had encountered an assassination in the villa area.

However, Madam President’s illness was probably not that simple.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
