1521 Similarity

The president’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that Qiao Nian was thinking of her patient, he nodded. “Okay.”

At this moment, Lina walked over with the President’s wife. She happened to hear the President agree to Qiao Nian’s request and asked in confusion, “Dad, what are you talking to Nian Nian about?”

“It’s nothing.” The President walked over to Madam President. Seeing that Shen Mei’s collar was crooked, he reached out to help her straighten her collar and tuck her hair behind her ear. He looked at Shen Mei gently.

Shen Mei looked up at the president affectionately. She was already used to the president taking gentle care of her. She leaned against the president like a little bird, taking the initiative to rub her face against his hand like a kitten.

Qiao Nian’s gaze lingered on the president and Shen Mei’s faces. When the two of them stood there and looked at each other, one could sense that their relationship was very deep.

The information Qiao Nian had found was that the President of Europe was related to the kidnapping of her twenty years ago, but she wasn’t sure if this was done by the President of Europe or someone related to him.

She hoped that the European president did not do this. She did not want to become enemies with them.

When she saw the President and Madam President, she felt the strong love between the two of them.

If Madam President knew that her father, Professor Shen, had been threatened, would she feel at ease? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Soon, Qiao Nian dismissed the thought. Previously, Madam President had cerebral palsy. Even if Madam President’s cerebral palsy had been cured, it had been too long since the past. Perhaps Madam President no longer remembered.

A gust of wind blew past, and Shen Mei couldn’t help but shiver.

Seeing this, the European President hurriedly took off his jacket and draped it over Shen Mei’s shoulders. He said softly, “Let’s go back!”

“Okay!” Madam President agreed softly and obediently followed the president to her room.

The President and Madam walked in front, with Lina and Qiao Nian following behind.

Holding Qiao Nian’s arm, Lina glanced at her mother, then lowered her head and whispered into her ear, “Nian Nian, it might be hard on you to stay with us for the time being. I’m also worried about you going back. If Uncle and the others attack you, I’m afraid I won’t be able to protect you in time.”

Annie had already been locked up by them. The people outside only knew that Annie had entered the palace and not left.

But the president’s brother, Earl Mark, must have known that Annie was locked up by the president, because Earl Mark’s men were still in the palace.

Before Qiao Nian could respond, Lina’s phone rang. She took it out and looked at it. Her expression changed drastically. She turned to Qiao Nian and said, “An army suddenly appeared outside the palace. It should be Earl Mark’s men!”

Lina hated Earl Mark now. She was no longer willing to call her Uncle.

Lina closed her cell phone and said solemnly, “It’s safer for you to stay in the palace for now!”

Although Lina was very innocent, she also knew in her heart that since things had already developed to this point, their family would definitely fight Earl Mark head on!

A trace of confusion flashed in Lina’s eyes. Puzzled, she asked, “Do we look alike?”

Lina frowned slightly and thought for a moment before saying, “I’ve always thought that I look more like Dad. I don’t look like Mom at all. Actually, I want to look like her.”

Perhaps it was because her mother was from Country Z, but she had always hoped that she could look like her mother. She had always liked the looks of Asian beauties.

“I’m talking about your expression and your back view.”

Qiao Nian knew that Lina and Shen Mei’s faces didn’t look alike at all, but from behind, Lina and Shen Mei still looked alike.
