1426 Falling

Lina told Qiao Nian all the places around Bear Mountain Falls that she should visit. At the same time, she recommended the delicious restaurants nearby to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian listened to Lina’s words seriously. Her eyes were filled with yearning, as if she really wanted to go to Bear Mountain Falls.

Lina had initially thought that Qiao Nian was just giving her an out. However, seeing that Qiao Nian really wanted to go to Bear Mountain, a gentle smile appeared on her face. “Madam Gu, if you want to go to Bear Mountain, you can let me know. I can go with you!”

“It would be great if we could go together. I was worried that the place would be so big that I wouldn’t be able to find my way.” Qiao Nian smiled.

“The electronic map over there is indeed a little inaccurate. I’ve been there several times, and I’m already very familiar with it.” With that, Lina glanced at Gu Zhou, who was sitting beside Qiao Nian. Thinking of her actions just now, she said guiltily, “Mrs. Gu, I’m really sorry about just now. I thought your husband was still single. I hope you can forgive me for being rude.”

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Lina to say it so openly. She liked straightforward people. She glanced at Gu Zhou, then smiled at Lina and teased, “For my husband to be favored by the Seventh Princess, it means that my taste is very good. I still want to thank the Princess for doing an inspection for me!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, a sincere smile appeared on Lina’s face.

Gu Ting sat beside Lina and naturally took in all the Seventh Princess’s thoughts. He knew very well that the Seventh Princess liked Sugar a lot now.

Sugar’s EQ was really high. She was already on good terms with the Seventh Princess.

Lina’s blue eyes sparkled. With a bright smile on her face, she said, “From now on, don’t call me Princess. Just call me Lina.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Qiao Nian.”

Qiao Nian and Lina even exchanged contact information. As the two of them ate, they chatted about the culture and customs of Europe. Most of the people at the dining table were talking to each other.

Dinner was about to end. Lina glanced at the watch on her wrist and said, “It’s getting late. I’ll go back first. Let’s go hiking and look at the waterfall tomorrow.”

Qiao Nian smiled and stood up. “Okay.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qiao Nian was about to send Lina out when Lina hurriedly waved her hand and said, “Don’t send me off. The bodyguards are outside. Take your time eating.”

Qiao Nian didn’t stand on ceremony. Smiling, she said, “Be careful on the road.”

“Yes, yes,” Lina replied and left.

Qiao Nian smiled as she watched Lina leave. Her eyes narrowed slightly, and her lips curved up slightly.

Now that she had a good relationship with the Seventh Princess, she would probably be able to get close to the President after getting along slowly. The truth of the kidnapping twenty years ago would be revealed very soon.

She liked people with the temperament of the Seventh Princess very much. If the kidnapping case was not directly related to the European President, she and the Seventh Princess would definitely become very good friends.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly, hiding the complicated emotions in her eyes.

“Oh my!”

The Seventh Princess’s scream came from the door.

Qiao Nian turned around and saw the Seventh Princess falling to the ground, her face pale. Frowning, she stood up and walked towards the door.

Gu Ting and Gu Zhou also saw the Seventh Princess fall. They hurriedly stood up and walked over.

Qiao Nian was the first to walk over to Lina. She bent down and helped her up. She looked up and saw Chen Qing standing at the side. She frowned. “Chen Qing?”

Chen Qing looked at Qiao Nian, at a loss.

Gu Zhou walked over. When he saw Chen Qing, he frowned. “Why are you so rash?”

Chen Qing came back to his senses. He looked at Lina, who was being supported by Qiao Nian, and said apologetically, “I’m sorry.”

With that, Chen Qing walked over to Gu Zhou and whispered.

Gu Zhou’s expression changed.

Qiao Nian also noticed Gu Zhou’s expression. Her heart skipped a beat. She had a bad feeling. Could something big have happened?

Gu Ting, who was standing at the side, naturally noticed Gu Zhou’s expression. A trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

Lina had an easygoing personality. Seeing that the person who had knocked her down knew Qiao Nian, she didn’t intend to make a fuss. With Qiao Nian’s help, she sat down on a chair.

After taking a few steps, her forehead was covered in cold sweat.
