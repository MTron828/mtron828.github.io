1240 Have fun

“There’s no need. Why don’t the few of you attack together?” Qiao Nian’s words were filled with provocation, completely disregarding the bodyguards.

Jiang Yue was so angry that she frowned. She tried hard to remain calm and said to the bodyguards, “The few of you, attack. Don’t shoot. You have to catch her alive. I want to have fun with her!”

Guns?

A trace of cunning flashed in Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes, then she narrowed them.

She had to end this quickly and take their guns away. Only then could she have the upper hand.

If Jiang Yue wanted to court death, then don’t blame her for being impolite.

The people around her rushed over from all directions. Holding a silver needle in her hand, Qiao Nian looked at the people around her coldly.

When those people approached, Qiao Nian immediately took out the silver needles from her bag. When those people approached, she took the initiative to stab the first man who rushed up with the silver needles, inserting them into the numb acupoint on his arm.

Before the man could react, he covered his arm in a daze. Qiao Nian kicked his leg, and he couldn’t stand up again.

At this moment, Qiao Nian had already stabbed the silver needle into the leg of the second person. Not only did the second person not hit Qiao Nian, but he also fell to the ground in a sorry state because he lost his balance.

The other four people wanted to pounce on Qiao Nian. When they saw the two of them fall to the ground inexplicably and groanin pain, they immediately took a few steps back.

They didn’t know what strange technique that woman had used to make their companions fall to the ground.

What puzzled them the most was why their companion, who was the first to charge at the woman, was holding his arm when the woman had clearly kicked him in the leg.

Neither him nor his second companion had been hit by the woman. They fell to the ground and rolled around, hugging their legs.

Both of their faces were pale as they lay on the ground, howling in pain.

The four of them looked at each other. One of them stammered, “W-What kind of evil technique did you use?”

Qiao Nian’s cold gaze swept across the four of them, scaring them so much that they took another step back. “I’m just using medical skills. You don’t have to be afraid!”

When the four of them heard Qiao Nian’s words, they looked at each other and began to discuss.

Jiang Yue was stunned. She was a top student in the medical school. Although she majored in Western medicine, she had more or less come into contact with Chinese medicine. She knew that there were many acupuncture points in the human body. As long as she inserted a silver needle, those acupuncture points would be triggered.

If she pricked the right acupuncture points, it might bring the patient back to life. Otherwise, it might kill him.

Qiao Nian hadn’t killed them directly just now, so the bodyguards would only roll on the ground in pain.

Jiang Yue’s beautiful eyes narrowed dangerously. She had always known that Qiao Nian’s medical skills were good, but she hadn’t expected Qiao Nian’s acupuncture skills to have reached the point of perfection. Even when the other party was moving or wearing clothes, Qiao Nian could accurately insert a needle into his acupuncture points. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Yue pursed her lips tightly. Qiao Nian was a stumbling block in her life. If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, she would still be the high and mighty young lady of the Gu family.

However, Qiao Nian had stolen everything from her. Qiao Nian had made her leave the Gu family dejectedly like a stray dog.

How could she let Qiao Nian off?

What should she do?

At this moment, Jiang Yue was in a dilemma.

At the same time.

On a big tree not far from the villa, Xiao Bao was looking at the situation in the villa in surprise.

Half a minute ago, he had looked worried, but now he looked excited.

Oh my god!

Mommy was really amazing!!!

His mommy was beautiful and valiant. She was simply too handsome!

He still didn’t understand. Mommy had only gently touched the two bodyguards. Why had they fallen to the ground?

Xiao Bao looked down at Butler Zhao, who was standing under the tree, and asked curiously, “Uncle Zhao, do you know what this type of martial arts is called? You only have to gently touch anyone else and they will roll on the ground in pain.”

When butler Zhao heard Xiao Bao’s words, he looked up at him and said seriously, “Little Master, there’s no such martial arts in this world!”
