1012 Outrageous

Although Song Yu said that, she was still thinking if Matriarch Lu knew that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was still alive. Would there still be a place for her in the Lu family?

It had to be known that none of the brothers of the Lu family seemed to like her very much. Only Lu Qi treated her decently well.

As for Matriarch Lu, she glanced at her. She treated her averagely.

“This is getting more and more outrageous! If I find out who did this, I’ll definitely chase them out of the Lu family!” Matriarch Lu said with a dark expression.

!!

Although Matriarch Lu was old, her legs were still quite agile. She quickly walked to the entrance of the courtyard and saw Lu Zhu, Gu Zhou, and Qiao Nian standing together from afar.

“Who set off the fireworks? Don’t you know the rules?” Matriarch Lu said with a dark expression.

When Qiao Nian heard that slightly dignified old voice, she looked up and saw Grandma walking over with a dark expression.

She recalled that on the last birthday of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Grandma was also angry when the urn of the eldest daughter of the Lu family was corroded by sulfuric acid.

Qiao Nian suddenly felt as if she had been caught red-handed. For some reason, she felt a little nervous.

Song Yu looked at Qiao Nian, her eyes flashing. She still remembered Song Xue’s words.

It would be even better if she could chase Qiao Nian out of the Lu family!

Song Yu’s mind raced. She wondered if she could do this. After all, Qiao Nian wasn’t an easy person to deal with.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Song Yu, who was beside Matriarch Lu. Song Yu was the same as before. She had a gentle expression and exuded a gentle aura.

A few days ago, Song Yu had been the headline on all the major websites. Song Yu had just won three Best Actress awards, and now the entire Internet was praising her.

Perhaps it was because she was in a good mood, but Song Yu was also in a good state. She looked even more beautiful.

Lu Zhu was slightly stunned. He remembered that Grandma should have gone to the temple to offer incense and pray for Sugar today. Why was she at home now?

He had initially wanted the siblings to interact more with Sugar first. When Grandma returned in the afternoon, he would let Sugar acknowledge Grandma.

Lu Zhu looked at Song Yu in confusion.

Song Yu glanced at Matriarch Gu and explained, “Brother, this morning, before Grandma left the house, she felt a little stuffy in her chest, so she didn’t go to the temple. I accompanied Grandma to the Buddhist hall to pray for Sister, but I didn’t expect to hear the sound of firecrackers and fireworks.”

When Lu Zhu heard Song Yu’s words, he looked worried. He looked at Matriarch Lu with concern. “Grandma, I’ll invite the doctor over and ask him to examine your body!”

Matriarch Lu’s expression softened a little. She shook her head and said, “This is just an old illness. It’s nothing serious.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Matriarch Lu’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian again. She looked at the two of them in surprise, thinking that something had happened to Matriarch Gu. She hurriedly asked with concern, “Ah Zhou and Nian Nian, why didn’t your grandmother come with you?”

“Grandma is resting at home today,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

Matriarch Lu understood. It seemed that nothing had happened to Matriarch Gu. She heaved a sigh of relief. “Then are you here today for something urgent?”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s question, she instantly became nervous, not knowing how to answer.

She could usually do anything, but the only thing she didn’t know how to do was deal with kinship.

She had no idea how to get along with the Qiao family in the past.

Later on, that incident happened six years ago. She had completely fallen out with the Qiao family. After that, she didn’t know how to get along with them.

Qiao Nian wasn’t good at dealing with kinship. After all, she had never enjoyed kinship in all these years.

Gu Zhou naturally understood what Qiao Nian was thinking. He held her hand tightly. Seeing that she was still so nervous that she couldn’t speak, he tugged at her hand.

Only then did Qiao Nian come back to her senses. Smiling, she said, “Grandma, we’re here…”

She wanted to say that she was here to visit Grandma, but when she thought of how empty their hands were, she began to hesitate again.

“Grandma Lu, we’re here to visit you.” Gu Zhou also knew that Qiao Nian was nervous and couldn’t speak, so he spoke up for her.
