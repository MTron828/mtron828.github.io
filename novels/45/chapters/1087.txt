1088 Embezzlement

Qiao Shan thought that Qiao Xin had written him a letter. Filled with anticipation, he opened the folder. However, when he saw the contents, he was stunned. The document in his hand fell to the ground!

The expression on Qiao Shan’s face gradually turned ferocious, and his eyes were filled with anger. He hurriedly took out his phone and called the company’s finance department!

Qiao Shan was so angry that his entire body was trembling. The veins on the back of his hand bulged ferociously, and he was panting heavily. He was like a volcano that was about to erupt!

After the call went through, Qiao Shan said coldly, “Go and investigate the company’s accounts from twenty years ago. Focus on whether anyone embezzled funds!”

!!

Qiao Shan could no longer control his emotions. He yearned to know the truth immediately, not willing to wait a moment longer!

The company’s finance manager said respectfully, “Alright, Mr. Gu. I’ll investigate now, but it’ll take some time. After I find out, I’ll send the document to your email. Is that okay?”

“Yes!”

After Qiao Shan hung up, he looked at the letter on the ground with hatred in his eyes!

Qiao Xin’s letter was very simple. Qiao Xin said that when she was six years old, she had once seen a man coming out of Su Xue’s room in a disheveled state. At that time, she was still young and didn’t understand what she meant.

But now that she had experienced sex, she understood what it meant!

If she wasn’t wrong, that man should be Su Xue’s lover.

Moreover, she had once read Su Xue’s diary. That was twenty years ago. Su Xue seemed to have fallen for a man then.

In order to make that man happy, Su Xue had spent a lot of money on that man that belonged to the company. Later on, that man ran away with the money. Su Xue was worried about money every day!

Later on, Su Xue seemed to have thought of another way to return the money!

When Qiao Shan saw this, he completely believed Qiao Xin’s words. Qiao Shan roughly understood why Su Xue had picked Qiao Nian up back then. Su Xue must have used Qiao Nian’s money!

Moreover, Qiao Shan was very sure that Qiao Xin wasn’t lying. The embezzlement of public funds wasn’t a small matter. This matter could be investigated!

What Qiao Shan found most unbelievable was that Su Xue was actually with a male technician from the beauty salon. If he remembered correctly, Su Xue had indeed been addicted to beauty salons in the past.

Qiao Xin had written very clearly that Su Xue went to the beauty salon two or three times a week. She often saw several handsome men enter a room with Su Xue!

At that time, in order to dispel Qiao Shan’s suspicions, Su Xue would also take Qiao Xin with her. Qiao Xin would do her homework in the hall outside. When Qiao Xin finished her homework and wanted to call Su Xue over, she would stand at the door of Su Xue’s beauty room. She could still hear some ambiguous voices coming from inside.

Qiao Shan’s expression darkened. He finally understood how lewd Su Xue was. Previously, he had caught Su Xue having an affair. That man should only be one of Su Xue’s lovers.

Holding the handle of the wheelchair with one hand, Qiao Shan struggled to pick up the letter from the ground. It was just a small matter of picking up a document. He was so tired that he was sweating profusely.

Qiao Shan held the letter with a trembling hand. It was hard for him to imagine that Su Xue, who he had always thought was a good woman, was actually so lewd!

He didn’t know if Qiao Xin was lying or not. As long as he found out if Su Xue had embezzled public funds more than twenty years ago, he would be able to confirm if Qiao Xin was lying!

At this moment, Qiao Shan’s phone rang. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Shan took out his phone and answered the call. He placed the phone to his ear. “How’s the investigation going?”

“President Qiao, there was indeed a strange expense in the accounts twenty years ago. At that time, Madam transferred out more than a million yuan from the company, but at the end of the year, Madam paid it back!”

Qiao Shan’s hand, which was holding the cell phone, trembled. Qiao Xin wasn’t lying. Su Xue had betrayed him!

Qiao Shan was so angry that his temples were throbbing. He tried hard to take deep breaths to control his emotions. After a long time, he said, “Give me a screenshot of the details!”

“Yes!”

After Qiao Shan hung up, he received a WeChat message from the finance department.

The finance department sent two photos. One was of Su Xue embezzling public funds, and the other was of Su Xue sending the money back.
