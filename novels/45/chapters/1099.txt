After Gu Zhou stepped on her left hand, Shen Fang loosened her grip a little and hurriedly nodded. “Alright, alright. I promise you that I won’t come again!”

When Shen Fang realized that Gu Zhou had let go of her foot, she hurriedly retracted her hand and slowly sat up.

“Brother Ah Zhou, my parents…”

Before Shen Fang could finish speaking, she was sent flying by Gu Zhou’s kick. She lay in the middle of the road in a sorry state, coughing twice in pain. Only then did she say, “Brother Ah Zhou, can you let my father go?”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and looked at Shen Fang with interest. This was the first time she had realized that Shen Fang loved her parents so much. She had already been beaten up so badly by Gu Zhou, but she was still thinking about her parents.

Shen Fang was really filial.

When Gu Zhou heard Shen Fang’s words, he recalled that Shen Fang had once touched his hand. He almost vomited in disgust. “I don’t have a sister. If you continue to cling onto me, I’ll sue you for trespassing!”

Shen Fang’s expression changed slightly. She tried her best to stand up.

She had thought that all men liked filial women, so she pretended to be especially filial.

However, she could not see any emotion in Gu Zhou’s eyes. In other words, Gu Zhou did not care if his woman was filial at all.

Shen Fang staggered to her feet and took a few steps awkwardly. She looked at Gu Zhou and smiled brightly. “Gu Zhou, as long as you divorce Qiao Nian, I’m willing to marry you!”

Gu Zhou held onto Qiao Nian’s waist, and his mood gradually improved. However, Shen Fang’s words instantly made his good mood disappear.

“What did you say?” Gu Zhou suppressed his anger. He had never seen such an shameless woman.

Qiao Nian looked at Shen Fang’s stubborn face and smiled gently. Shen Fang had been arrogant since she was young. Shen Fang would never know what humility was.

In Shen Fang’s eyes, she was the only good person in the world. Everyone else was trash.

Shen Fang didn’t even look at Qiao Nian. She stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou and said affectionately, “I’m willing to marry you. I don’t want a betrothal gift. I’ll give birth to many children for you! They all say that my butt is big enough and suitable to give birth.”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Shen Fang continued, “I’m the prettiest girl in our village, and the smartest girl in our village. If you’re with me, we’ll be working together. The children we give birth to will be both smart and adorable. They’ll definitely…”

“Ah!”

Shen Fang was kicked by Gu Zhou again. She flew out and fell to the ground in a sorry state.

Shen Fang’s internal organs were already starting to hurt. She couldn’t help but throw up. Looking at the bright red blood on the ground, she was stunned.

Had she vomited blood?

Shen Fang shivered. Could it be that she had an incurable disease like Lin Daiyu and would vomit blood and die in the future?

She remembered that Lin Daiyu lived because of Jia Baoyu, but did she live for Gu Zhou?

Shen Fang looked at Gu Zhou with love in her eyes. She felt that her request just now might have been a little too much. If she had kicked Qiao Nian out from the beginning, she wouldn’t have been able to take revenge on her!

If she wanted to take revenge on Qiao Nian, she would make sure that she couldn’t make a comeback.

Shen Fang felt as if she was the female lead in a script. She looked at Gu Zhou and coughed a few times before saying, “Brother Ah Zhou, I’m willing to follow you without any status. Please don’t chase me away!”

Shen Fang had read many novels in the past. In many novels, the female lead stayed by the male lead’s side in the early stages. Only in the later stages would the male lead fall in love with the female lead.

She believed that as long as Gu Zhou interacted with her more, he would definitely fall in love with her.

Shen Fang was confident.

Gu Zhou was so angry that his temples were throbbing. Was this woman a lunatic? What kind of nonsense was going on in her mind?

Asking him to divorce Qiao Nian?

She was also willing to follow him without a name.

Where did she get the courage?

He walked up to Shen Fang step by step and stepped on her stomach. He looked down at Shen Fang, the disgust in his eyes obvious. “There’s a path to heaven, but you didn’t take it. You barged into hell!”

Gu Zhou exerted more strength. Shen Fang was in so much pain that she could barely breathe. She looked at Gu Zhou, her eyes filled with desire. “Believe me, I’m your true love.”
