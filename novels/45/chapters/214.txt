Chapter 215: The Pain Will Fly Away

Floating in midair were many soap bubbles. The floor of the bathroom was also covered with colorful bubbles.

Gu Zhou had fallen completely into the bathtub. He was struggling non-stop, spilling water everywhere.

Chen Qing and Qiao Nian walked quickly into the bathroom.

Because the tiles were too slippery, Chen Qing slipped and fell. Lying on the floor, he struggled to get up.

Stepping carefully, Qiao Nian moved next to the bathtub and touched it. The bathtub was slippery. No wonder Gu Zhou couldn’t get a good grip of the edges and sit up.

With one hand pressed against the wall next to the bathtub, Qiao Nian hurriedly pulled Gu Zhou up with her other hand.

Gu Zhou sat in the bathtub, panting heavily. He raised his hand to wipe his eyes, but the more he wiped, the more his eyes hurt.

“Don’t touch your eyes.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she hurriedly brought the showerhead over. After turning it on, she adjusted the water temperature before squatting down to help Gu Zhou wash his face.

After finally washing the soap off Gu Zhou’s face, Gu Zhou opened his eyes. They were red-rimmed. Seeing how worried Qiao Nian was about him, he began to complain pitifully, “Nian Nian was bad. Nian Nian didn’t help Zhou Zhou take a bath. Then Zhou Zhou drank a lot of water!”

Qiao Nian had never expected Gu Zhou to cause an accident just by trying to take a bath. She sighed helplessly. “Okay, okay. I’ll help you to take a bath!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Gu Zhou turned to look at Chen Qing, who had just gotten up from the ground. He frowned in disdain and said, “You, get out!”

Chen Qing couldn’t wait to leave. He turned around and quickly walked out. Once again, he slipped and stumbled. Fortunately, he didn’t fall this time.

Chen Qing walked out of the bathroom, not forgetting to close the door. He stood outside silently, waiting.

Seeing that he and Qiao Nian were the only ones left in the bathroom, Gu Zhou smiled. He scooped up the foam in the bathtub with both hands and blew at it, causing a dozen more bubbles to appear and float away. He said, “Nian Nian, look. There are so many bubbles. Smell them. They smell so good!”

Qiao Nian stood there, trying hard to suppress her rage. It was as though a line of crows was flying over her head. She took a deep breath to calm herself down and asked, “So, you poured the entire bottle of shower gel in?”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian innocently and blinked. “Yes!”

Qiao Nian: ...

What could she say?

Why did she feel that he was as pure and innocent as a white lotus flower?

To be honest, the current Gu Zhou was just like a naive child. She couldn’t even scold him.

At this moment, she suddenly understood why so many men liked to date white lotus flowers. Even she, a woman, liked the type!

“Is Nian Nian angry with Zhou Zhou?” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian innocently, his voice filled with confusion.

“No.” Qiao Nian said softly, “You have to be careful when you take a bath alone in the future. Don’t pour too much shower gel. What if you slip and hurt your head?”

An innocent smile bloomed on Gu Zhou’s face. He nodded obediently. “Alright, Zhou Zhou understands.”

Qiao Nian knew she had to help Gu Zhou change the water in the bathtub. If Gu Zhou had been a child, she wouldn’t have minded.

However, although Gu Zhou’s mind was like that of a child, his body was that of an adult.

When Gu Zhou regained consciousness after this, he would remember that she had seen him naked. That might have dire consequences.

However, Gu Zhou was now looking at Qiao Nian innocently. He said sadly, “Nian Nian, the water is cold!”

Qiao Nian was a little worried that things would become worse if Gu Zhou fell ill again. She gritted her teeth and closed her eyes, preparing to help Gu Zhou change the water.

“Nian Nian, why did you close your eyes?”

“My eyes hurt.”

Gu Zhou’s face was instantly filled with worry. He said, “Then I’ll help you blow on them. The pain will fly away!”

Blowing?

Fly away?

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she felt unwell.

She tried hard to maintain her composure. When she heard Gu Zhou stand up, she immediately pushed him back down. “Sit down quickly. My eyes will stop hurting very soon.”
