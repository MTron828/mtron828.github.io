Chapter 452: The Third Young Master of the Lu Family

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Jiang Chi!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

The name seemed familiar. She had heard it somewhere before.

“He’s a legendary figure here and the person behind the monopoly of the Black Market. He can do whatever he wants here. If you want to save Eldest Young Master with your own abilities, it’s ridiculous!”

After hearing Chen Shi’s words, Qiao Nian finally remembered.

Jiang Chi was the Black Hell King of MY.

Most people wouldn’t dare to provoke him.

However, he was the one who had provoked her first.

A trace of coldness flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes. “Tell me his phone number!”

When Chen Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked impatient. He felt that Qiao Nian was the kind of young miss who stayed in her room. She had simply watched too many police dramas and didn’t know anything. Yet, she was still fooling around!

Chen Shi was a little annoyed by Qiao Nian’s words, so he gave her the number.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and quickly wrote a string of codes. Then, she entered Lu Zhu’s phone number.

Soon a map appeared on the page. On the map was a red dot moving in the opposite direction from them.

......

Qiao Nian tried her best to remain calm. She pointed at the red dot on the screen and said, “This is Lu Zhu’s location. Let’s go after him now!”

Chen Shi was slightly stunned. Previously, he had thought that Qiao Nian was just asking for it casually. He had never expected that Qiao Nian would really be able to track down Eldest Young Master’s location.

Qiao Nian’s heart beat faster and faster. She tried her best to remain calm and analyzed, “I think they definitely won’t take a corpse away. That would be harmful to him, so Lu Zhu must still be alive!”

“I’ve heard that Jiang Chi is the Black Hell King here. If I’m not wrong, these people should have followed Jiang Chi’s orders to take Lu Zhu away. I guess Jiang Chi had other arrangements. In that case, Lu Zhu shouldn’t be in danger. However, his injuries…”

Towards the end, Qiao Nian’s voice choked up a little, and it became difficult for her to breathe. She tried her best not to cry.

Chen Shi had also calmed down now. He had been too agitated just now.

Chen Shi tilted his head and glanced at Qiao Nian, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so smart.

Now was not the time to start an internal conflict. Their goal was the same: saving Lu Zhu. Therefore, he had to let go of his prejudice against Qiao Nian.

Chen Shi said solemnly, “I’d better contact Third Young Master first. Third Young Master controls all of the Lu family’s power in MY!”

Qiao Nian was a little stunned. She looked at Chen Shi in surprise and asked, “There’s still a third young master in the Lu family?”

It had to be known that she was already very shocked when she heard that there was a second young master in the Lu family. Now, there was another third young master for some reason. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You don’t know?” Chen Shi asked, frowning slightly.

“Do I know the Third Young Master of the Lu family?” Qiao Nian looked at Chen Shi suspiciously.

Chen Shi pursed his lips, looking impatient. It turned out that Qiao Nian didn’t know anything.

In his opinion, the Third Young Master of the Lu family was a high and mighty god. He shouldn’t have lowered himself to be Qiao Nian’s bodyguard. This was really embarrassing for the Lu family.

However, at that time, Third Young Master had said that he had been entrusted with something by someone he was loyal to.

Chen Shi sighed. If not for the special situation, he definitely wouldn’t have told Qiao Nian about this.

However, saving Eldest Young Master was more important now.

After thinking about it, Chen Shi still said, “It’s that Ah Rao who came all the way here to be your bodyguard. He’s the third young master of our Lu family, Lu Rao!”

Qiao Nian was stunned.

She really did not expect Ah Rao to be the young master of the Lu family.

Gu Zhou had actually invited the Third Young Master of the Lu family to protect her.

Ah Rao actually agreed.

Moreover, Ah Rao had actually protected her well.

What shocked her was that there was really a Third Young Master in the Lu family. She had actually not found any information about this person before.
