Chapter 506: Things Became Complicated

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu’s face darkened and his eyes were filled with frost. “After I go back, I’ll go to the police station to investigate the case file from back then and see if there are any other clues about this kidnapping twenty years ago.”

At this point, Lu Zhu’s heart ached.

The gods had been kind to him. Now that he had found his sister, he had a chance to make amends.

However, when Lu Zhu thought about how he could not bring his sister home immediately, he felt very sad.

Qiao Nian agreed with Lu Zhu’s point of view. She nodded and said, “Yes.”

Of course, she would use her contacts to look into the matter.

At that time, she was just a three-year-old child, but she had to suffer such cruelty.

Someone with a motive had to be behind this, but she didn’t understand why.

As long as she did not return to the Lu family now, those vicious people might still think that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was dead and lower their guard. They might even expose themselves.

At that time, she would definitely find all the people who had caused her to leave the Lu family. She would settle the score with them one by one and make them beg for death.

Seeing how quiet Qiao Nian was, Lu Zhu’s breathing tightened, and he felt a tightness in his chest.

He knew his sister had said yes because she understood he was saying it to protect her.

However, what made Lu Zhu uncomfortable was that Qiao Nian accepted everything he said so obediently and calmly. He couldn’t help but feel his heart ache.

If it was Lu Qi, she would definitely cry and want to go home.

Lu Zhu really hoped that Sugar would make a fuss too and be able to express her emotions in front of him.

“Sugar, I’m really sorry. I can only let you suffer for now. Believe me, after we catch those people, I’ll definitely bring you home. Our family will never be separated again!”

Qiao Nian could hear the forbearance in Lu Zhu’s voice. Lu Zhu should be very angry now. She comforted him. “Brother, there’s no need to be too anxious about this matter. In order to avoid alerting the enemy, we should take it slow. Mr. and Mrs. Lu are both very powerful people. All these years, they’ve been kept in the dark. It’s obvious that the person behind this is very powerful!”

Lu Zhu knew that Qiao Nian was right. He could only make plans at a distance. However, his sister would have to suffer.

What made Lu Zhu uncomfortable was that when Qiao Nian addressed her parents as Mr. and Mrs. Lu, he had a strange feeling in her heart.

Lu Zhu understood that it wasn’t Qiao Nian’s fault.

Qiao Nian’s parents had never interacted with her in the past twenty years. To Qiao Nian, her parents were just strangers who were related by blood.

It seemed that it would take some time for Qiao Nian to integrate into this big family again.

If he hadn’t come here with Qiao Nian this time, or experienced the unforgettable events in Ghost City with her, Qiao Nian probably wouldn’t have been close to him.

From the looks of it, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were still quite close.

Gu Zhou…

Lu Zhu’s heart trembled involuntarily.

He had just found Sugar, but she had already grown up and gotten married.

As a brother, he didn’t give his sister much company.

At this moment, the elevator door opened, instantly pulling Lu Zhu back to reality.

Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian came out of the elevator together. He turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked, “Sugar, how does Gu Zhou treat you?”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback.

She did not know if it was her imagination, but she felt that when her brother mentioned Gu Zhou, he seemed to be very serious and stern. He did not look as happy as before.

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “He treats me quite well.”

After saying this, Qiao Nian continued, “Brother, you have to remember what I said before. We can’t be too anxious about this matter. Besides, I don’t want you to be in danger. Since we’ve already acknowledged each other, we just have to investigate slowly. It’ll only take a word for us to go home in the future. It’ll be fine as long as we’re united.”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
