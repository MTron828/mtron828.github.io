Chapter 267: Joy

Lu Nian placed the violin on his left shoulder and played it gently. After tuning it, he began to play seriously.

A gentle tune came from the strings of the violin, instantly bringing everyone into a warm atmosphere.

After the pitch gradually rose, the rhythm suddenly became very brisk, like a child surrounding his grandmother.

Gradually, the rhythm of the violin slowed down. It was like the warmth of the afternoon sun, making one feel as if they were enjoying the embrace of a loved one. It was gentle and comfortable, and one would be unable to extricate themselves from it.

At the end of the song, it softened as if it was filled with helplessness and sorrow, but also with a healing warmth.

After the song ended, Matriarch Gu’s eyes welled up with tears. She understood what Lu Nian meant.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian gently patted Matriarch Gu’s back, silently comforting her.

Matriarch Gu said with a moved expression, “This song is really nice. I like it very much.”

“It’s good that Grandma likes it.” Lu Nian smiled. He looked at Matriarch Gu, and his gaze inadvertently fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He could see the admiration for his idol in her eyes. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lu Nian had seen his fans before, but this was the first time he had seen such a sincere fan. His eyes flickered as he asked, “I heard from Grandma that you’re studying at the music academy now?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded.

Lu Nian recalled that when he first met Qiao Nian, she was holding this violin. He asked tentatively, “Then do you know how to play the violin?”

“Yes!”

“Can you play a segment?”

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up. Previously, she had been thinking about how to consult Mr. Dong Hua. Now, she finally had a chance.

“Sure!” Qiao Nian took the violin from Lu Nian.

At the same time, Gu Zhou sat up straight without anyone noticing.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue smiled at Qiao Nian. She was a little curious about how talented Qiao Nian was.

She stole a glance at Gu Zhou, who was sitting not far away. Seeing that there was nothing wrong with his expression, she thought to herself that if Qiao Nian didn’t play well, then Gu Zhou would definitely not like Qiao Nian anymore, because Qiao Nian had stolen the violin that Grandma had treasured for many years.

Qiao Nian straightened her back and placed the violin on her left shoulder. She slowly closed her eyes and began to play.

Seeing that Qiao Nian’s posture was not bad, Jiang Yue snorted in her heart. Qiao Nian must have pretended to steal Grandma’s violin!

Suddenly, a pleasant sound rang out from the strings.

When Lu Nian heard this familiar sound, he was stunned.

This familiar melody pulled him back to the music he had heard in the practice room that afternoon.

Lu Nian stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, his expression slightly complicated.

Jiang Yue, who was sitting at the side, looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She had never expected Qiao Nian to know how to play the violin. “Missing” was one of the more difficult songs in violin music.

Even though Jiang Yue was an outsider, she knew that without more than ten years of cultivation, it was impossible for Qiao Nian to perform this song perfectly.

Qiao Nian played the violin calmly. She had handled every detail perfectly. Her rhythm was very good.

At times, she would frown slightly, and at other times, her brow would relax. It was as if she was already deeply immersed in the song. She exuded an aura unique to artists, even though she was only a young girl in her early twenties.

Lu Nian sat at the side and slowly closed his eyes. This song was identical to the one he had heard in the training room that day. In fact, it was even more pleasant to the ear.

His eyes flew open, filled with joy.

He was completely certain that Qiao Nian was the female musician he had been looking for!
