Chapter 586: Let Her Stay

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou’s heart ached. His eyes stung from Gu Qi’s expectant gaze. His eyes darkened as he said softly, “Yes. If you live here in the future, I’ll be able to take care of you.”

Gu Qi’s eyes were sparkling like stars in the night sky.

Gripping his pants tightly, he stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. “Will Auntie stay here forever?”

Actually, he preferred to live with Auntie alone.

Gu Zhou had an indescribable feeling in his heart. Thinking of how Qiao Nian had hidden their marriage yesterday, his thoughts changed. Pretending to be casual, he asked, “Do you like her a lot?”

Gu Qi hesitated for a moment before nodding.

“If you like it, I’ll let her stay at home forever,” Gu Zhou said softly.

When Gu Qi heard Gu Zhou’s words, he was only happy for a moment, but his eyes quickly darkened.

“Aren’t you happy?”

“No.” Gu Qi lowered his head and said softly, “What if Auntie doesn’t want to live here anymore? She’s an adult. If she wants to leave, we won’t be able to stop her!”

Leave?

Gu Zhou’s heart suddenly stopped.

Qiao Nian seemed to have wanted to leave this place before.

Perhaps she had never thought of staying here forever?

Realizing this, Gu Zhou’s heart ached even more. He felt a little uncomfortable.

“Dad?” Gu Qi tilted his head and looked at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou’s thoughts were pulled back to the present. He gently stroked Gu Qi’s head and said, “It’s impossible for her to leave.”

Gu Qi blinked. “Why?”

“There aren’t so many whys in this world,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

Gu Qi still didn’t understand. Thinking of what the kindergarten teacher had said, he asked, “Dad, why don’t you marry Auntie? That way, we can live together forever, and Auntie won’t have to leave!”

The more Gu Qi thought about it, the more he felt that his idea was good. He looked at Gu Zhou intently and said, “Dad, why don’t you marry Auntie sooner?”

Gu Zhou did not answer. He just looked at Gu Qi.

Previously, that overconfident nanny had said that his son was a fool who knew nothing.

His son was clearly smart and logical.

Could it be that Gu Qi had been pretending to be stupid in the past?

Seeing that Gu Zhou was staring at him silently, Gu Qi blinked. “Dad?”

Gu Zhou pursed his lips and asked softly, “Little Qi wants Daddy to marry her?”

When Gu Qi thought about how his aunt might leave, his heart felt empty.

When Auntie took care of him, he felt that she was so warm and loved being with her.

“Yes, I want Dad…” Before Gu Qi could finish his sentence, he frowned. “If Dad marries Auntie, what will happen to my mommy?”

“If Dad marries her, she’ll be your mommy from now on,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

Gu Qi looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief, his eyes filled with panic.

“Are you willing to let your aunt be your mommy?” Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened.

Gu Qi gradually lowered his head and his long eyelashes drooped, as if he had been thinking about this question.

He liked Auntie very much. When Auntie took care of him, she made him feel warm and at ease.

But Mommy might still be looking for him somewhere.

With this thought in mind, Gu Qi pursed his lips and asked carefully, “Can I have both Auntie and Mommy? When the time comes, the four of us will live together. Is that okay?”

Gu Zhou didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “Just now, you said that Auntie would leave on her own, didn’t you?”

Gu Qi came back to his senses and began to fall into a dilemma again.

Seeing Gu Qi’s conflicted and helpless expression, Gu Zhou roughly understood why Gu Qi was like this. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He was still young and didn’t know that one couldn’t have everything. In the future, he would have to make a choice.
