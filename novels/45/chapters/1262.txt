1263 Neglected

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. He walked towards Qiao Nian and sat down beside her.

Qiao Nian placed her phone between the two of them and smiled at Gu Zhou. “I’m on the phone with them.”

“Daddy!”

“Dad!”

Xiao Shi and Gu Qi’s voices came through the phone. Gu Zhou’s eyes were filled with smiles as he looked at the two children. Just as he was about to speak, Xiao Shi’s obedient and adorable voice came through the phone again.

“Mommy, Brother has something to tell you!” Xiao Shi handed the phone to Gu Qi. Although it was her brother’s home ground, she still had to look at her mommy and daddy on the phone.

Gu Zhou smiled helplessly. He sat at the side and looked at the two children on the phone.

“Mommy,” Gu Qi called out.

“Sigh.” Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with smiles as she looked at Gu Qi gently.

Gu Qi’s face was filled with seriousness as he asked seriously, “Mommy, I remember you saying that you know how to hack, right?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, her expression turned serious. She nodded. “Yes.”

When Qiao Nian had known Gu Qi in the past, she wanted to help him find his biological mother. It was also at that time that she told Gu Qi that she knew hacking.

“Help me check someone’s game ID. I’ll send you his game account later.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, the smile on her face gradually disappeared. She frowned and asked, “What happened?”

Gu Qi told Qiao Nian about how that person had persistently added him and his sister as friends in the game. “Mommy, don’t worry. Sister and I have blocked him. I was worried that he was a bad person, so I wanted Mommy to help me investigate,” Gu Qi said seriously.

Ever since Gu Qi found out that his mommy had been kidnapped when she was young, and that the people who had kidnapped her were powerful, he had been very careful about everything. He was worried that they would be kidnapped by those people!

Qiao Nian heard everything clearly. With a bright smile on her face, she praised, “Xiao Qi has really grown up. He already has a sense of security and knows how to protect his sister. Awesome!”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, the tips of his ears turned red. He pursed his lips and remained silent.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Xiao Shi’s face. She praised, “Xiao Shi is also an obedient sister. She knows how to listen to her brother and has a sense of precaution. Awesome!”

Xiao Shi stood beside Gu Qi and smiled at Qiao Nian. She puffed out her chest proudly. “Yes, Xiao Shi is amazing now! Brother said that we’re going to study now. Mommy, we won’t say anything else. I’m hanging up!”

“Bye. After reading your book, take an early shower and sleep.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi and Xiao Shi and said gently.

“Goodbye, Daddy and Mommy.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The video call ended.

Before Gu Zhou could speak, the two children hung up. He frowned, his eyes filled with disappointment.

He never expected neither of the children to take the initiative to speak to him!

What was wrong with reading later?

Was reading that important?

Gu Zhou’s chest felt stuffy!

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s cell phone vibrated. She opened it and saw that Gu Qi had sent a screenshot of that person’s homepage.

Game ID: [Baby Xiao Bao]

Looking at the familiar game interface, Qiao Nian knew that this was a game called Honor of Kings. Gu Qi seemed to have played this game before. At that time, she and Gu Qi were just friends. She wanted to know Gu Qi’s name, but Gu Qi wanted to keep it a secret, so she didn’t ask further.

But now, no matter how she thought about it, it felt strange.

She was Gu Qi’s mother, and Gu Qi was her son. Of course, a mother wanted to know her son’s game ID.

This was a strategy game. There were many hero characters in the game, and the skills of every hero were different. In the game, the skill sets of the hero, the hero’s equipment, and the situation in the game were different at all times. One had to be alert and quickly make a judgment.

This game should be very complicated for a five-year-old child. The fact that Gu Qi could persist until now meant that he was not bad at it!

After all, players who played too poorly did not have a good gaming experience, so they were naturally unwilling to play anymore.

Qiao Nian sent Gu Qi a voice message. “Be good. When Mommy gets home, we’ll play a duo battle!”

Gu Qi replied very quickly.

“Okay.”
