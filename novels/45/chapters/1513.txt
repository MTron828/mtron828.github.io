1514 Proud

Initially, Annie had looked flustered, but when she heard Qiao Nian’s words, she relaxed and gestured for the servants beside her to push her away.

She heaved a sigh of relief and raised her head proudly again. With a smug expression, she said, “Uncle, I’ve said it before. This woman is problematic. Let me tell you, if you beg me now, I’ll consider sending Autumn Grass to Aunt in the future. Otherwise…”

“How dare you!” The president’s expression changed drastically in anger, just like when a tsunami struck. Dark clouds gathered. “Annie, do you really think that Europe belongs to you?”

Annie looked up slightly and asked with a smile, “Uncle, there’s no point in saying that. We’re family. Why don’t you consider Aunt’s sickness? We can choose not to send the Falling Autumn Grass over.”

Once again, Annie said, “I know how important Aunt is to you, so my father and I have always provided you with Falling Autumn Grass. No matter what, we have worked hard even if we didn’t contribute.”

The weather was very good today, and the sun was shining brightly. Annie looked at Qiao Nian. Someone like Qiao Nian could only be a vase. Such an idiot was not even worthy of being her stumbling block.

Annie looked at Gu Zhou not far away with a smile. With affection in her eyes, she said gently, “Brother Gu Zhou, I’ll give you a choice now. First, if you come with me, you have to be separated from that woman. At that time, you can only have eyes for me. Second, if you stay with her, the two of you will be the ones who assassinated the princess. My father will never let you off.”

Annie’s tone was firm. Her eyes were filled with viciousness as she looked at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked calm, but Lina, who was standing not far away, was so angry that her face was flushed red.

Lina really didn’t understand how Annie had the cheek to seduce Gu Zhou. A woman like Annie who had been with countless men was not worthy of Gu Zhou at all.

Moreover, Gu Zhou was Nian Nian’s man. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lina was furious. She quickly stepped forward, subconsciously wanting to argue.

At this moment, Gu Zhou spoke. “Will you give me everything I want?”

When Annie heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyes were filled with surprise. She took a step forward, but when she saw the soil by her feet, she subconsciously stopped in her tracks and nodded vigorously. “Of course. I’ll give you whatever you want.”

Gu Zhou looked at Annie coldly, as if he was looking at a corpse. His voice was as cold as ice. “I want your life.”

The smile in Annie’s eyes instantly dissipated. She said angrily, “What did you say?”

Lina liked to see Annie suffer. She covered her mouth and laughed. “Sister Annie, Mr. Gu said that he wants your life. Are you going to give it to him?”

Annie looked at Lina with a knife-like gaze.

Lina met Annie’s eyes fearlessly, her expression calm. She finally understood why Nian Nian hadn’t been worried about Gu Zhou. Now, it seemed that it was mainly because Nian Nian had a reliable husband.

Annie glared at Lina angrily. She looked at the stone by her feet and bent down to pick it up. Without hesitation, she threw it at Lina.

She couldn’t bear to hurt Gu Zhou, but who did Lina think she was? How dare she mock her?

“Lina!” The president’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to rush over, but he was a little far from Lina.

“Lina!” Qiao Nian called out. Instinctively, she tried to stop the stone in the air, but it was too fast. It had already flown in front of her.

Lina looked at the flying rock and saw that it was about to hit her head. She was so frightened that she closed her eyes.

Right at this moment, Chen Qing grabbed the stone.

Lina sensed someone behind her move. She slowly opened her eyes and saw a man standing in front of her.

Chen Qing’s body rose and fell slightly, as if he had hardened from intense exercise.

Chen Qing turned to look at Lina and asked in a low voice, “Seventh Princess, how are you? Are you injured?”

Lina stared unblinkingly at Chen Qing and shook her head in a daze. She lowered her head in embarrassment, her gaze inadvertently landing on Chen Qing’s injured and bleeding hand.

Lina looked up at Chen Qing in a panic and said worriedly, “Your hand…”
