1336 I’m Just Informing You

“I’m just informing you that I’ll definitely take the two children away. I won’t let you take them away,” Qiao Nian said mercilessly. If it weren’t for the fact that Bai Hui was Gu Zhou’s mother, she wouldn’t have bothered to speak to someone like Bai Hui.

Bai Hui frowned and said coldly, “What kind of children do you think you can raise? Are you going to let your children play games for the rest of their lives? The children of the Gu family have their own responsibilities. Playing games is just wasting their time!”

Qiao Nian looked at Bai Hui in front of her, a trace of surprise flashing in her eyes. She asked, “Do you think your educational method is right?”

Bai Hui raised her chin slightly and said proudly, “They’re still considered outstanding now because I…”

“What do you mean by ‘considered outstanding’?” Qiao Nian interrupted Bai Hui mercilessly and said coldly, “You brought up two children. Did the two of them grow up in an ice-cold family? Did you make them not know what family warmth is? Did you make them almost turn against each other?”

Bai Hui’s face was pale. She clenched her fists tightly and tried hard to remain calm. “I…”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and looked at Bai Hui coldly, as if she couldn’t believe that Bai Hui would dare to say that she knew how to educate her children. “What right do you have to take Gu Zhou’s children away and raise them?”

Bai Hui looked at Qiao Nian, suppressing her anger. She looked at Qiao Nian coldly.

However, Qiao Nian didn’t seem to notice Bai Hui’s anger. She continued, “What did I say wrong? You’re planning to make my two children lose their childhoods, their happiness, and their bond.”

“Enough!” Bai Hui said sternly.

“It’s not enough!” Qiao Nian met Bai Hui’s gaze fearlessly and said coldly, “Do you think just giving them material goods is enough to raise a child? Let me tell you, what you said is far from enough. You don’t have the ability to protect my children at all!”

Although Bai Hui was very dissatisfied with Qiao Nian’s words, she still grasped the main point. She frowned. “What right do you have to say that I can’t protect them?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Even now, you still don’t know that there’s a dark force that has been trying to devour the Gu family. The two children might be captured by them at any time. How are you going to protect them? With the security officer at your door or your role as a teacher?”

At this point, Qiao Nian sat forward and looked at Bai Hui coldly. “If you really treat them as your grandchildren, you’d better return them to me. I have enough capabilities to protect the child. I don’t want to fall out with you! If you insist on refusing, I can only make a move. When the time comes, there will be no benefits to you!”

Towards the end, Qiao Nian gradually calmed down. Bai Hui was a smart person, so she naturally knew what to do.

Bai Hui looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes intently, trying to see the weakness in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

However, Qiao Nian looked calm. She didn’t look like she was lying at all.

She sat there in silence, and the atmosphere in the room froze again.

Qiao Nian raised her hand and glanced at the time. The second hand had run two rounds. She was getting impatient. She stood up and was about to fall out with Bai Hui, planning to snatch the children back.

Suddenly, messy footsteps came from the courtyard.

“Mommy!”

Xiao Shi’s excited voice came from the courtyard. When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s voice, she stood up and quickly walked out.

When Xiao Shi saw Qiao Nian, she ran towards her. Gu Qi had wanted to leave quickly, but when he saw Qiao Nian, he couldn’t help but run.

Qiao Nian was so happy that her eyes turned red. She squatted down, and the two children threw themselves into Qiao Nian’s arms happily.

Qiao Nian felt their soft bodies and gently touched their backs. Tears welled up in her eyes.

When she was in MY, she called them every day. Although she could see the two of them in the video, she felt happier when she saw them in person.

Qiao Nian lowered her head and kissed each of the two children on the forehead before hugging them tightly.
