Chapter 458: Risking Her Life

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jiang Wen was right.

At the side, Chen Shi’s heart was in a mess. This was simply a stalemate!

What should she do now?

Chen Shi looked at Jiang Chi’s villa worriedly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“I can save him!” Qiao Nian said without hesitation.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Chen Shi’s eyes reddened.

He had always looked down on Qiao Nian, but he had never expected that at such a critical moment, Qiao Nian would risk her life for Eldest Young Master!

Jiang Wen smiled gently and said, “That’s for the best. Mr. Lu will be saved!”

Su Han knew that no one could change Qiao Nian’s mind, so he stopped persuading her. His gaze landed on Jiang Wen’s face, and he threatened coldly, “Butler Jiang, please tell Mr. Jiang that if our Miss Qiao is harmed in any way, Master Qin will definitely flatten the Jiang family!”

Jiang Wen agreed calmly.

Qiao Nian knew very well that if she went in now, it might be very dangerous, but there was no other way.

She could only bet that Jiang Chi was afraid of Qin Chuan.

If Lu Zhu died because of her, she would never be able to eat or sleep in peace for the rest of her life as she would be living in guilt.

Qiao Nian followed behind Jiang Wen and walked into the resplendent palace.

At this moment, Chen Shi’s phone rang. When he saw that it was Gu Zhou, he quickly picked up. “Second Young Master.”

“Where’s Qiao Nian?”

The man’s voice was hoarse with anxiety.

Chen Shi wasn’t aware of the relationship between Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. He said, “In order to save our Eldest Young Master, Miss Qiao entered the Ghost City alone.”

For some reason, Chen Shi felt that the silence on the phone was a little suffocating. He did not dare to make another sound.

“How long has she been in there?” On the phone, Gu Zhou’s voice was hoarse, as if he was enduring it.

Chen Shi’s heart was in his throat. He pursed his lips slightly and said, “It hasn’t been five minutes since she entered.”

“Alright, what’s the situation now?” Chen Shi explained everything that had just happened.

Gu Zhou thought for a moment and said, “There’s no signal on her phone now. If she doesn’t come out or contact you in another half an hour, just fire! I’ll be there soon!”

When Chen Shi heard Gu Zhou’s words, his breathing tightened. He didn’t understand why Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were so decisive.

However, when Chen Shi thought of how Gu Zhou was about to arrive, he felt at ease.

Jiang Chi could offend one family, but he couldn’t offend the Lu, Qin, and Gu families at the same time.

It was three to one. Jiang Chi had no chance of winning.

At this thought, Chen Shi’s uneasy heart gradually relaxed.

Without hesitation, he replied, “Okay!”

In the Ghost City.

As soon as Qiao Nian entered the Ghost City, she realized that there was no signal on her phone. Something must have interfered with the signal, preventing her from contacting the outside world.

Although she was a good hacker, she did not have the time or energy to crack the firewall of the Ghost City now.

Qiao Nian glanced around. This place was heavily guarded, and there were mercenaries in almost every corner. It would be difficult to escape. If she brought the seriously injured Lu Zhu with her, it would be even more difficult!

However, after entering, Qiao Nian’s heart gradually calmed down.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that Qin Chuan would never let anything happen to her. She also believed that Gu Zhou would definitely come and help her!

Qiao Nian followed Jiang Wen to the most luxurious room. There was a sandalwood fragrance everywhere, making one feel as if they were in a paradise.

Jiang Chi really had the time and energy to build luxurious rooms here.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw a chair with dragon patterns engraved on it.

Qiao Nian felt that if this was ancient times, Jiang Chi would be a tyrant and a king who dominated an area.

“Miss Qiao!”

She heard a gentle, gentlemanly voice.

Qiao Nian tilted her head and saw a handsome man.
