1378 Unconscious

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan with a pale face and quickly ran towards him. Before she could run to his side, she saw Qin Chuan’s body go limp and fall to the ground.

“Senior!” Lu Qi wanted to run to Qin Chuan’s side quickly, but she accidentally fell to the ground. She got up from the ground in a sorry state.

“Senior!” Lu Qi helped Qin Chuan up, who was already half unconscious. She saw that Qin Chuan was still vomiting blood from the corner of his mouth. She tried her best to wipe the blood off his mouth, but the blood at the corner of his mouth couldn’t be wiped clean no matter what.

“Senior, wake up. You can’t sleep. Don’t sleep!” Lu Qi’s tears fell one by one like broken pearls, her voice filled with tears.

Sunlight filtered through the hole, shining on Lu Qi and Qin Chuan.

Qin Chuan glanced at Lu Qi through the gap in his eye. Lu Qi’s back was facing the sunlight, and she emitted a gentle glow.

Gradually, the white gentle light grew larger and larger. All that was left in front of him was whiteness.

…

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian stood on the ruins. The two of them walked towards the tunnel exit according to the predicted distance, wanting to see if there was a hole to enter and check on the situation.

“Chen Qing said that the explosion squad has arrived. I believe they’ll be able to defuse the bombs in the tunnel very soon. Chen Qing has already brought people over.” Gu Zhou hung up and said to Qiao Nian.

“I hope the two of them are safe.” Qiao Nian’s heart was in a mess. Every minute and second was very tense.

As soon as she finished speaking, she seemed to hear voices. She quickly walked up to Gu Zhou and gestured for him to keep quiet.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Senior!”

“Senior, wake up!”

…

Lu Qi’s sobbing voice came from afar.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou and hurriedly said, “It’s Qi Qi. It’s Qi Qi’s voice. They’re still alive!”

Gu Zhou’s heart skipped a beat. Seeing that Qiao Nian was already running towards the source of the sound, he quickly followed.

Qiao Nian looked over. When she saw a two-square-meter hole, she looked down and saw Lu Qi supporting Qin Chuan.

“Qi Qi! Qin Chuan!” Qiao Nian hurriedly called out.

When Lu Qi heard the voice above her head, she looked up at Qiao Nian. Her tears were like a flood that had broken through the dam. She couldn’t stop them no matter what. Her voice trembled as she said, “Sister, Senior… Senior doesn’t seem to be able to hold on much longer. What should I do? What should I do?”

Lu Qi had never encountered such a thing. She was really frightened to death.

“Qi Qi, don’t be anxious.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she saw that Qin Chuan’s face was pale, his lips were purple, and his mouth was covered in blood.

Seeing the situation below, Gu Zhou frowned. Just as he was about to call Chen Qing, he heard Qiao Nian say, “Ah Zhou, help me. I’m going down now.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian worriedly and said, “I’ll get Chen Qing to bring someone over to save them.”

“It’s too late. I have to stop Old Qin’s bleeding first. His condition doesn’t look good now.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she placed the needle bag in the pocket of her down jacket into her jeans pocket. Casually, she took off her down jacket and threw it under her. “Pull me up so that I can jump down later.”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian chose to stay away from Lu Qi and Qin Chuan. Gu Zhou stood at the side and held Qiao Nian’s hand. When he was already lying on the side, he said to Qiao Nian, “Can I let go now?”

Qiao Nian glanced at the distance below and looked up at Gu Zhou. “Alright.”

Gu Zhou let go, and Qiao Nian jumped down.

Fortunately, this height was not high. She would not be hurt if she jumped down.

Qiao Nian picked up her down jacket and quickly walked up to Lu Qi and Qin Chuan.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi and asked worriedly, “How are you now?”

Lu Qi said with teary eyes, “Sister, I’m fine. Senior Brother’s condition isn’t good now. Take a look at him.”

Qiao Nian gestured for Lu Qi to lay Qin Chuan flat on the ground.

She took Qin Chuan’s pulse. His pulse was very weak, as if it would disappear in the next moment.

Lu Qi raised her hand to wipe her tears and looked at Qiao Nian nervously. Seeing Qiao Nian frown, tears welled up again.
