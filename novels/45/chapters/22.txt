“What?” Zhou Xue had been feeling frustrated, but upon hearing Qiao Xin’s words, she narrowed her eyes and asked coldly, “Li Zheng liked her?”

Qiao Xin’s breath caught. She looked toward Zhou Xue in a panic, and quickly explained, “Don’t… Don’t think too much. It’s not like that. Li Zheng did nothing w-with her…”

The more Qiao Xin explained, the more anxious she became. Cold sweat began to break out on her forehead. In the end, she sighed helplessly and looked at Zhou Xue with red-rimmed eyes. She said in a soothing tone, “Xue’er, let’s leave!”

From Zhou Xue’s point of view, Qiao Xin’s actions made it more obvious that she was trying to cover something up. She looked toward Qiao Nian, who was standing at the cashier counter, with a sour expression. Zhou Xue’s eyes were burning with anger.

Her best friend had been bullied, and her boyfriend had once liked that bitch.

Zhou Xue had always valued her friendships. At this moment, she was so angry that she could have vomited blood. She straightened her back, pushed Qiao Xin’s hand away, and walked towards Qiao Nian without hesitation.

“Qiao Nian, you’re too shameless!” Zhou Xue walked up to Qiao Nian with her hand raised, ready to slap her.

Qiao Nian frowned, a little annoyed by Zhou Xue’s behavior. She turned and said to the staff, “This person is causing trouble. Please call security!”

The sales assistant looked at the pile of clothes in front of her. Her sales performance this month would definitely be the best among all the employees. Smiling, the assistant picked up the phone, preparing to call security.

Naturally, Zhou Xue saw the salesperson’s actions. She put down her hand angrily and glared at Qiao Nian, livid. With malice written all over her face, she said, “Qiao Nian, you impudent bitch. You stole your sister’s boyfriend and now you’re stealing her shares. Have you no shame at all?!”

At Zhou Xue’s words, Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Qiao Xin, who was standing not far away. Qiao Xin had donned a worried facade, looking like an innocent little bunny. The pretense was obvious!

“The bill, please.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she swiftly took out a black card, glancing at Zhou Xue with contempt. “Zhou Xue, I advise you to be aware of what exactly you are doing.”

A black card?

The sales assistant took the black card from Qiao Nian reverently. There were only a handful of people in this city who owned such black cards. So the young woman in front of her was a rich person!

The people around them, who were watching the spectacle unfold, immediately understood. Why would someone who could afford a black card even care about the small amount of shares in other people’s hands?

Such a rich and pretty young lady could just wave her hand, and a bunch of handsome men would probably fall to her feet!

“This young lady is really rich. That Zhou Xue must be slandering her!”

“Exactly. Everyone knows that a black card holds more wealth than a small country!”

“Why would a rich young lady lack a boyfriend? What a joke!”

…

Zhou Xue’s expression grew darker and darker as she heard the mutterings of the people around her. Her gaze fell on the black card in Qiao Nian’s hand. Her eyes bulged and she shouted, “You are a thief! Tell me, where did you steal that black card from?”

The sales assistant had just swiped the black card. Smilingly, she indicated for Qiao Nian to carry out fingerprint authentication. Qiao Nian casually placed her finger on the device.

Zhou Xue’s eyes were fixed on the fingerprint machine in the sales assistant’s hands. The error report she had pictured did not appear.

“Miss Qiao, this is your card!” The black card displayed the owner’s surname on the screen. The sales assistant smiled and handed the black card to Qiao Nian respectfully.

Qiao Nian calmly placed the black card back into her bag. Her movements were unhurried, and the people crowding around her saw that there was another black card in her bag!

Everyone was stunned. It was all their first time seeing someone who owned two black cards.

“Excuse me.” Qiao Nian spoke to the sales assistant beside her. “Miss Zhou Xue here has framed me for stealing. Please call the police!”

The sales assistant smiled and nodded. However, before she did so, she still called the security guards over. She waited for the security guards to subdue Zhou Xue before she called the police.

Within 15 minutes, the police would arrive! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Zhou Xue flew into an instant panic. She was a nurse in the First Hospital. If the people in the hospital knew that she had slandered someone, they might chase her out of the hospital.

Zhou Xue turned to look at Qiao Xin, who was standing not far away. In desperation, she cried out, “Xin Xin, save me! I can’t be arrested!”

Even if she hadn’t committed any crime, her future would be ruined as long as she was arrested!

Qiao Xin had initially wanted to take the opportunity to slip away, but when she heard Zhou Xue calling her, she hesitated. For a long moment, Qiao Xin stood rooted to the ground, unmoving. In the end, she hardened her resolve and turned to leave.

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin’s departing figure and gave a faint smile. She walked to a nearby stool and sat down, crossing her legs elegantly as she waited for the police to arrive. She glanced at Zhou Xue and asked, “Where did your good friend go?”

At this moment, Zhou Xue felt as if the sky had collapsed. She looked at Qiao Nian in a daze, bit her lip and said fiercely, “Qiao Nian, you framed me. You will die a horrible death!”

Qiao Nian looked at the unrepentant Zhou Xue and silently took out her mobile phone to send a message to Old A.
