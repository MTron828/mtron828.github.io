1005 Alert

“Sister, actually, you don’t have to be so wary of me. I won’t do anything to you.” Song Xue’s voice was as sweet as ever.

However, Song Yu didn’t believe Song Xue at all. She said coldly, “Let’s meet again.”

“Sure, Sister. I have so much to tell you.” Song Xue sounded very happy.

The venue was set by Song Yu.

!!

When Song Yu arrived at the Western restaurant, Song Xue had already arrived and was looking at the menu.

Song Yu sat opposite Song Xue and said to the waiter, “Just give me a medium-well steak set meal. Thank you.”

When Song Xue heard Song Yu’s words, she pointed at a set meal and said, “This will do. Thank you.”

“Alright, please wait a moment.” With that, the waiter took the menu and left.

Song Yu looked at Song Xue. Although she knew that Song Xue was her biological sister, she still had no feelings for her. There was only unfamiliarity.

“Sister, actually, what Dad asked you to do is very simple. Just keep an eye on Qiao Nian.”

Song Yu frowned slightly and asked, “Why?”

Song Yu had also heard from her grandmother that Qiao Nian was just an unloved daughter of the Qiao family. She had married Gu Zhou in order to congratulate him.

Although Qiao Nian was a very capable person, her family background wasn’t good. Why was the Song family paying attention to her?

“Sister, I think the less you know, the better. What do you think?” When Song Xue smiled, her eyes curved into crescents.

For some reason, Song Yu thought of Lu Qi again.

Every time Lu Qi smiled, her eyes would curve into crescents. However, Lu Qi’s gaze was innocent and his gaze towards her was complicated.

Song Yu smiled and nodded.

She had to find out what had happened. Moreover, she wanted to know why the Song family had not acknowledged her back then.

Song Yu had a terrible meal.

When Gu Zhou woke up, he saw Qiao Nian lying beside him. He turned to look at her.

In a daze, he recalled what had happened last night.

Qiao Nian was really too sweet. One couldn’t help but eat her again and again.

Her biological clock woke her up. In a daze, she opened her eyes and met Gu Zhou’s deep eyes.

“Good morning, Nian’er!” Gu Zhou moved closer to Qiao Nian’s forehead and kissed her lightly.

“Good morning!” Qiao Nian said. When she heard that her voice was a little hoarse, she recalled what had happened last night and glared at Gu Zhou.

This man really did not know how to control himself.

Wasn’t he afraid that he would die from exhaustion?

Gu Zhou didn’t seem to notice Qiao Nian’s gaze. He looked at her gently, his voice still hoarse from just waking up. “From now on, I’ll stay with you in the Lu family.”

For a moment, Qiao Nian was a little confused. What was Gu Zhou talking about?

However, she quickly understood. Perhaps it was because her brother had said yesterday that he wanted to bring her home, and Gu Zhou was a little afraid.

Before she could speak, Gu Zhou reached out and pulled her into his arms.

Gu Zhou’s strong heartbeat rang in her ears. She could tell that Gu Zhou was very nervous.

Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes and reached out to hug Gu Zhou in response. She said gently, “Don’t worry, I won’t leave.”

Gu Zhou’s heart skipped a beat.

Yesterday afternoon, he had watched Qiao Nian play with the two children. His mind was filled with images of Qiao Nian leaving him.

He didn’t want to lose Qiao Nian again. He had only lived for a few decades, and it wasn’t easy for him to have the person he loved the most. All he wanted to do now was protect Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou rested his chin gently on Qiao Nian’s head. “Nian’er.”

His voice was a little hoarse, but it was like mellow red wine, leaving an aftertaste.

Qiao Nian’s heart stirred.

When she lived on the spiritual mountain in the past, her grandfather and senior brothers all called her Nian’er.

Everyone called her Nian’er. This form of address had accompanied her for more than ten years.

She had thought that she would no longer like this form of address.

However, when Gu Zhou said this name, she felt something else. That numbing feeling seemed to spread from her tailbone to her entire body.
