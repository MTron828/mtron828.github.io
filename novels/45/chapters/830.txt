831 It’s Not Suitable Right Now!

However, the only person who could fight for the custody of these two children was Gu Zhou. She decided to go home and discuss this with Gu Zhou.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian printed out Song Man and Xiao Shi’s DNA test report.

Holding the printed report, Qiao Nian rushed back to the Gu family villa.

…

At this moment, in the Gu family villa.

Gu Zhou sat at his desk, looking down at the documents in his hand. At this moment, his phone rang.

When he saw the caller ID, his expression faltered slightly. Just as he was about to pick up the call, the little snake moved closer.

The little snake wrapped itself around Gu Zhou’s wrist and rubbed its head against his hand.

However, its owner gave no indication. Its owner had been staring at the phone. It seemed that its owner was in a bad mood.

Gu Zhou picked up the phone. Thinking of what had happened at the Lu family, his eyes turned cold.

“When do you plan to bring Nian’er home?”

When Lu Zhu heard Gu Zhou’s question, he hesitated for a moment before saying, “It’s not appropriate now.”

Gu Zhou’s fingers gently tapped on the table. His gaze inadvertently fell on a photo not far from the desk.

That photo was a photo of An City more than ten years ago.

Gu Zhou recalled Qiao Nian’s previous painting.

Previously, Qiao Nian couldn’t remember how they had met. He wondered if she had found an answer this time.

Gu Zhou’s eyelashes slowly lowered. Qiao Nian should have given him an answer yesterday, but it was already five in the morning. He was still waiting for Qiao Nian’s answer, but she had yet to return home.

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. He said slowly, “She’s been alone outside for too long…”

When Lu Zhu heard Gu Zhou’s words, his heart seemed to be clenched tightly by a hand. It hurt so much that he could barely breathe.

He recalled that in MY, he had clearly sensed that Qiao Nian was both yearning and afraid of kinship. Her eyes were filled with unease.

He had also investigated Qiao Nian’s previous life.

The Qiao family didn’t treat Qiao Nian well at all. They left her in the countryside to fend for herself. Later on, they locked her up in a mental hospital for four years!

How many four years could one have in life?

Yet his sister had to stay in a mental hospital for so long.

At the thought of this, Lu Zhu felt that the air was a little suffocating.

His most precious sister was actually treated like trash by the Qiao family.

“But what happened back then involved a lot of people. It involved the person closest to me, so I’m worried…”

“Do you think your worry will work?” Gu Zhou interrupted Lu Zhu mercilessly and asked, “Do you think she can’t figure it out?”

Lu Zhu’s expression suddenly changed, and his eyes were filled with fear and unease. He pursed his lips and asked, “She… she found out?”

“She’s meticulous. No matter what it is, she’ll think it through carefully. She’ll consider everything carefully. With her ability, she’ll be able to find out,” Gu Zhou said. He recalled the first time he had seen Qiao Nian in the Gu family villa. Qiao Nian had calmly grabbed the little snake.

She was so calm. There was no trace of panic on her face.

Even when she came out of the Jiang Chi Ghost City, she did not panic at all. She was only calm.

In the past, he didn’t understand why Qiao Nian was so calm and ruthless. Now, it seemed that if she couldn’t protect herself, she might be eaten up by those people until not even her bones were left.

“Is… is she worried…” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“She’s panicking!”

Lu Zhu frowned, his face turning paler and paler. His hand, which was holding the phone, trembled.

“Then, did she say anything to you?” Lu Zhu asked uneasily. He had called Gu Zhou today to ask how far Qiao Nian had investigated.

“Nothing, but I’m not a member of the Lu family, and I don’t know what exactly happened between the two of you back then. However, what exactly did your mother do…”

When Lu Zhu heard Gu Zhou’s words, he understood. He sighed heavily and said slowly, “Back then, my mother did the DNA test herself. It was precisely because our mother was firm that we all believed that something had happened to our sister!”

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. What had gone wrong?
