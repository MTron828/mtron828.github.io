Chapter 74: Bridal Carry

Was he apologizing?

Apologizing to whom?

Perhaps this was why his illness often flared up.

Qiao Nian wanted to retract her hand and leave, but his grip was too tight. She gave up.

After an indeterminate amount of time, Qiao Nian grew sleepy and fell asleep on her side.

The servants in the house were also afraid of waking them up, so they did not dare to approach.

Slowly, night fell.

In a daze, Gu Zhou opened his eyes. All he could see was darkness.

He had just moved his hand when he felt a faint softness in his palm. Under the moonlight, he saw that he had been holding Qiao Nian’s hand. His expression changed and he hurriedly let go.

Qiao Nian casually took her hand aside. In a daze, she fell asleep again.

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. Had he actually fallen asleep on the sofa with Qiao Nian?

How was this possible?

How could he let his guard down around an outsider?

At this moment, footsteps could be heard from outside. Following that, the lights in the living room were switched on.

Gu Zhou instinctively squinted his eyes. When he got used to the brightness, he saw Zhao Qian walking in, supporting Grandma.

On the way here, Matriarch Gu had heard from someone that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were sleeping side by side. She was so happy that her smile had nearly split her face apart. Now, in a low voice, she said dotingly, “Ah Zhou, quickly carry Nian Nian back to her room to sleep. Don’t let her catch a cold.”

Carry Qiao Nian?

Zhao Qian frowned slightly and quickly said, “Grandma, Second Brother…” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Zhao Qian was about to say that Gu Zhou had a fear of women when she saw Gu Zhou pick up Qiao Nian in a bridal carry and walk towards the second floor with an indifferent expression.

The light in Zhao Qian’s petal-shaped eyes gradually faded until her eyes had turned completely dark.

Oh, right.

When Second Brother was with Qiao Nian, he lost his fear completely.

Matriarch Gu looked at Zhao Qian in confusion. Seeing that her mind was somewhere else, she asked, “What’s wrong? What did you want to say just now?”

“I’m fine,” Zhao Qian said insincerely.

How was this fair?

How was it that Second Brother no longer feared women only when he was with Qiao Nian?

This wasn’t fair.

She had clearly known Gu Zhou for a longer time than Qiao Nian had. Why wouldn’t Gu Zhou touch her?

Matriarch Gu had no idea what Zhao Qian was thinking. She walked to the sofa and sat down. When she thought of how Gu Zhou had carried Qiao Nian, her eyes filled with joy.

This child, Gu Zhou.

Ever since he was a child, he had never liked to talk. Neither did he like to interact much with the opposite sex. After that incident five years ago, he immediately contracted a phobia of females.

The only woman he hadn’t been afraid of was her, his grandmother.

Sigh.

As his grandmother, she was really worried about his marriage—the biggest event in his life. She was truly afraid that Gu Zhou would be alone for the rest of his life.

Zhao Qian sat down beside Matriarch Gu and glanced at the bandages on the coffee table. Her eyes darted to the side, and she said, “Grandma, Second Brother’s hands seem to be…”

When Matriarch Gu heard Zhao Qian’s words, she pursed her lips in annoyance and said, “His hands must have suffered some small injury, nothing more. What’s there to be afraid of? Would he be unable to carry his wife just because of some cuts? Surely that would be too melodramatic of him!”

Zhao Qian was speechless.

She looked at Matriarch Gu in disbelief. In the past, whenever Gu Zhou did something, Grandma would always be worried sick over him.

“Grandma, should we still tell Second Brother about what happened today?” Zhao Qian asked hesitantly. She had only taken one glance at Second Brother today.

“There’s no need.” At the thought of Gu Zhou picking Qiao Nian up, Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but smile. It seemed that the Gu family would gain a grandchild very soon. “Nothing is more important than him providing company for his wife. Alright, take me back to my room!”

Matriarch Gu returned to her room. Seeing that Zhao Qian was about to leave, she hurriedly called Zhao Qian over and said, “Qian Qian, come and take a look at this.”

Zhao Qian looked at Matriarch Gu in confusion and took the photograph from her. There were many young and handsome men in the photograph.. “Grandma, I don’t know any of these people!”
