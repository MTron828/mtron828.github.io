1286 Doubts

“Cui Huai has sent many people to surround the villa. It seems that he still suspects that we deliberately let Gu Zhou go previously.” Chang Feng pursed his lips and continued, “On the surface, he arranged for us to deal with Gu Zhou, but in reality, he’s already gotten someone else to deal with Gu Zhou. Not only that, he’s getting someone to keep an eye on us now. It’s obvious that he’s worried that we’ll save Gu Zhou!”

When Mr. Chen heard Chang Feng’s words, he clenched his fists tightly. The veins on the back of his hands bulged ferociously. He subconsciously wanted to walk out, but he quickly realized that if he saved Gu Zhou now, his many years of hard work would be ruined!

Chang Feng walked to Mr. Chen’s side and said in a low voice, “Sir, Cui Huai must suspect us, but he doesn’t have any evidence yet. If we leave now, it’ll be equivalent to handing the evidence to Cui Huai.”

Mr. Chen’s frown slowly relaxed. “Yes.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Chang Feng continued, “Even if we save Gu Zhou, Cui Huai will definitely attack us. Then our plan will all fail.”

“I know.” Mr. Chen pursed his lips tightly and finally heaved a sigh of relief. His expression was calm. “Where are his people?”

“They probably already crossed paths with Gu Zhou,” Chang Feng said with a frown.

Mr. Chen walked towards the kitchen and slowly began to grind the coffee beans.

Every time he was distracted, he liked to grind his coffee to kill time. It seemed that he won’t be sleeping tonight.

Actually, Chang Feng was also worried about them, but they couldn’t make a move.

Mr. Chen ground his coffee beans and said softly, “He’s not young anymore. There are some things he needs to face himself. All we can do is trust him.”

He thought of the young Gu Zhou and his lips curved up slightly. He really hadn’t expected that cold young man back then to have already gotten married and had children.

“Yes.” Chang Feng nodded.

…

In the amusement park theater.

Many people followed them into the 5D theater. As soon as they entered, water poured down from the ceiling, drenching them all. Only then did they notice that there was a lot of water on the ground.

Just as they were feeling puzzled, a blue light suddenly lit up in the theater. Before those people could react, they trembled from the electric shock and fell to the ground.

Gu Zhou hugged Xiao Bao and frowned.

Qiao Nian said in a low voice, “Don’t worry, I’ve already planned the timing. You have to believe in my grasp of time. I believe that more than half of them have already been electrocuted and are lying there, unable to move.”

Gu Zhou nodded. The props in the theater building had already been set up by Qiao Nian in layers of checkpoints. Although they couldn’t kill those people, they could still make them tremble in fear. They could not stay in the theater anymore.

Gu Zhou walked out of the theater with Qiao Nian and Xiao Bao and went straight to the photography building not far away.

There were different scenes in the photography building. Not only that, but there were also many dressing rooms and bathrooms. It was very suitable for hiding.

When they arrived at the photography building, Gu Zhou arranged for Qiao Nian and Xiao Bao to stay in a prop room. He pulled a moving hanger in front of Qiao Nian and Xiao Bao, wanting to block their figures.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was about to leave, Xiao Bao subconsciously tugged at his clothes and asked in a panic, “Dad?”

“Hm?”

“Aren’t you coming in?” Xiao Bao looked at Gu Zhou worriedly.

Gu Zhou moved closer to Xiao Bao and kissed Qiao Nian’s forehead. Then, he kissed Xiao Bao’s forehead and said in a low voice, “Just hide here. I’ll go outside and watch over you!”

“Let’s hide together.” Xiao Bao gripped Gu Zhou’s shirt tightly, his starry eyes filled with worry. “Someone will definitely save us.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou worriedly, her eyes filled with reluctance. In the past, she would definitely have fought alongside Gu Zhou at all costs. But now, she still had to take care of Xiao Bao. She didn’t want Xiao Bao to be hurt at all.

Gu Zhou raised his hand and patted Xiao Bao’s head reluctantly. He said gently, “Xiao Bao, Dad is a superhuman. No one is my match. Hide here with Mommy. Don’t let anyone find out.”

“But Dad…” Xiao Bao’s small eyes were filled with worry.

“Xiao Bao, can you lend Dad your gun?” Gu Zhou said with a smile, as if he was talking about something very ordinary.
