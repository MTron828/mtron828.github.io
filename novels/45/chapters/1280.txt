1281 Disappointment

Those people Mr. Chen was referring to were none other than the people who had been taking care of Xiao Bao.

“I’ve already instructed them.” Butler Zhao paused for a moment and said, “But Little Master’s teachers have all been sent out.”

Back then, when Butler Zhao searched for someone to be Xiao Bao’s teacher, he made sure the person was tight-lipped. As for the people taking care of Xiao Bao in the villa, they were all Mr. Chen’s trusted aides. He just had to give them a few instructions.

“Pay more attention to the people around them.” Mr. Chen paused and said, “Otherwise, they might be threatened.”

“Yes.” Butler Zhao nodded.

Mr. Chen pushed the document forward and said, “Get someone to give this document to Mr. Cui!”

Butler Zhao walked to the desk and picked up the documents. Mr. Chen noticed that Butler Zhao’s eyes were red. He pursed his lips and pretended not to see anything.

After Butler Zhao left, Mr. Chen was left alone in the study. He sat there quietly.

…

In the President’s office of HH Corporation.

When Cui Huai saw the document in his hand, he threw it in front of his subordinate in exasperation. He said angrily, “Why are you so useless? I asked you to take down the Sagu Corporation. What have you done? All of you are extremely stupid. You’re really useless!”

The ten people standing in the office were so frightened that they didn’t dare to make a sound. They lowered their heads and stood there.

Seeing how they were pretending to be dead, Cui Huai was furious. He picked up the cup on the table and threw it at them in exasperation. “I’m talking. Don’t you understand?”

The person standing at the front said shakily, “Mr. Cui, our subordinates were all incompetent. We did follow Mr. Chen to the agreed location, but Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian didn’t attend the appointment. Our people didn’t kill them.”

When Cui Huai heard this, he grew even angrier. “How dare you say that? Have you investigated thoroughly? Where’s Chen Quan? Why isn’t he here?”

“Mr. Chen wanted to come over directly, but a waiter dirtied his clothes. He went back to change his clothes.”

When Cui Huai heard that person’s explanation, the anger in his eyes intensified. He chased the person out.

About half an hour later, Mr. Chen brought Chang Feng into Cui Huai’s office.

When Cui Huai saw that Mr. Chen had arrived, he did not even look at him. He sat at his desk and continued working. It was obvious that he was ignoring Mr. Chen. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Mr. Chen and Chang Feng exchanged glances and stood rooted to the ground in silence.

Mr. Chen stood there with his head lowered, saying nothing.

“I heard that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian didn’t go because they found their son?” Cui Huai’s tone was sinister. His triangular eyes were fixed on Mr. Chen.

Mr. Chen stood there calmly and said, “It’s like this. They took their son to the amusement park!”

“Are you all useless!” Seeing Mr. Chen’s calm expression, Cui Huai flew into a rage. Anger instantly surged in his heart as he roared, “It’s been so long since their son was in MY, but you didn’t even realize it. If you had caught their child earlier, we wouldn’t have been so passive now. All of you only eat and don’t do anything. What use do I have for you!”

Mr. Chen lowered his head and did not speak. It seemed that giving Xiao Bao away was a good choice.

All these years, Cui Huai appeared to believe him very much, but in reality, he had long begun to doubt him.

This time, not only did he find a good reason for Gu Zhou not to attend the appointment, but he also got rid of the suspicion that he was colluding with Gu Zhou.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Cui. I was incompetent and didn’t notice anything wrong with Gu Zhou coming to MY!”

The anger in Cui Huai’s eyes dissipated a little. He thought that Gu Zhou had come to MY to annex HH Corporation. Previously, he had also gotten someone to kill Gu Zhou, but Gu Zhou had escaped every time.
