1174 I’m Sorry

“My daughter was kidnapped. On the fifth day after the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian, disappeared, those people blindfolded me and brought me to an operating theater.”

Thank you readers!

Shen An frowned and clenched his fists tightly. The veins on the back of his hands bulged ferociously. “That group of people is simply crazy. They… they asked me to transplant the bone marrow of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian, to a young lady.”

“A bone marrow transplant is a big surgery to begin with. It’s very likely that accidents will happen during the surgery. Usually, people choose adults to transplant bone marrow. Adults have better health than children, but they actually let a three-year-old child undergo a bone marrow transplant.”

Shen An spoke very fluently about medicine.

“I didn’t want to do the bone marrow transplant, but they said that if I didn’t do it, they would kill my daughter.” At this point, Shen An’s eyes gradually became unfocused. He looked at the camera blankly and continued, “I had no choice but to do it.”

Shen An sat there in a daze, his eyes becoming more and more unfocused. After a long while, he said, “When I was preparing for the surgery, I accidentally heard them say that they were going to kill Yan’er and your child later. At that time, I injected a large amount of anesthesia into her. After the surgery, I said that Sugar had died in an accident. I had to deal with the corpse myself to avoid being discovered by the police.”

“When they realized that Sugar wasn’t breathing, nor was there a pulse, they agreed.” Shen An grabbed his hair, as if he was trying hard to recall what had happened previously. He continued, “They wanted to deal with Sugar, but I refused. At that time, I said that I was a forensic doctor. I knew how to avoid the police finding Sugar’s body.”

After Shen An finished speaking, tears fell from his eyes in pain. He said with a pained and ferocious expression, “Su Yan, I know I’ve let you down, but there’s nothing I can do. The only thing I can do is let Sugar live well and not let her down.”

Shen An frowned. Although his frown suddenly relaxed, he said impatiently, “I remember now. I remember everything. I’ll tell you slowly from the beginning.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He sat there and told her everything about the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family back then.

He was also very worried about Su Yan’s daughter. He wanted to find some connections and see if he could save Little Lu Nian as soon as possible.

On the fifth day of the disappearance of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, he received an unknown call.

The call was from a man who had called to threaten him. He said that if he wanted to save his daughter, he had to go to North Mountain Park.

When he arrived at North Mountain Park, he saw a black car parked by the road. He wanted to remember the license plate number, but he realized that the black car didn’t have a plate number.

Two men in suits got out of the car. The men were wearing sunglasses and masks. He couldn’t see their faces at all.

The two men escorted him straight to the car. Once inside, they blindfolded him.

He was a forensic doctor and was sensitive to time. Before getting into the car, he glanced at the time. When the car stopped, the two men removed his blindfold. He glanced at the time. Three hours had passed since he had gotten into the car.

He was taken to a house by the men. He was tied to a chair and sat facing the wall.

At this moment, the sound of high heels came from behind.

He immediately became nervous. Just as he was about to turn around, he heard the woman’s slow voice. “Doctor Shen, if you turn around, your daughter will be killed in the next second.”

When Shen An heard the woman’s words, he immediately sat down and stopped looking back. He said nervously, “I’ve already prepared the money. Please let my daughter go!”

“Doctor Shen, I invited your daughter over first because I wanted you to come over and do me a small favor.” The woman’s voice was very gentle.

Shen An frowned. He was just a small forensic doctor. How could he help?

What made Shen An the most uneasy was that this woman had done so much and it was not for money. She must be after greater benefits!
