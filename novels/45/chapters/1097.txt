Oh my god!

If she had such a good-looking man, she would be willing to die!

The woman couldn’t help but touch the back of Gu Zhou’s hand. Was this really the back of a man’s hand? The back of his hand was too smooth!

As a woman, she felt a little ashamed of herself!

!!

She was really too shameless!

The woman swallowed. If she could sleep with such a man and be touched by his hand, how exciting and comforting would that be…

With this thought in mind, the woman couldn’t help but grip Gu Zhou’s hand tightly.

She could already imagine how to take off the man’s clothes and throw him onto the bed!

At the thought of this, the woman’s saliva flowed down the corner of her mouth, but she didn’t feel anything!

Gu Zhou had goosebumps all over his body. He could see desire in the woman’s eyes. This woman yearned to eat him up!

Gu Zhou frowned. Being seen as a sex object by a drooling woman made him feel so disgusted that he wanted to throw up.

Gu Zhou suddenly retracted his hand, and a vicious aura instantly surged from his body.

However, the young woman did not notice that Gu Zhou was angry. She lowered her head shyly and clenched her fists in front of her, twisting her body. She said delicately, “Brother Ah Zhou, I came to look for you today to tell you something. Can you let my father go…”

Before the woman could finish speaking, she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen. Gu Zhou kicked her away.

The woman screamed loudly and fell to the ground. She clutched her stomach in a sorry state and looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief!

What was Gu Zhou doing? Why had he kicked her?

If it were any other man who had kicked her, the woman would have scolded him long ago. However, the person in front of her was Gu Zhou, a man she loved the most. She could not say anything harsh!

She watched as the man slowly walked out and stood beside her.

She knew that the man would definitely like her. She was the most beautiful woman in her village!

There was no one better-looking than her in the surrounding villages!

Moreover, she was the most outstanding woman in her village. There were so many women in their village, but none of them had gotten into university. She had gotten into a university!

At the school promotion banquet, her father had invited many people!

The woman lay on the ground in a delicate and pretentious manner. She blinked hard and asked pitifully, “Brother Ah Zhou, how can you kick me? Doesn’t your heart ache if you kick me?”

Hearing the woman’s sharp voice, Gu Zhou felt his scalp go numb. He stared fixedly at the woman’s left hand, which had touched his hand. The woman’s left hand was on the ground. He walked over and stepped on the back of her left hand!

“Ah!” The woman screamed loudly!

She felt that the back of her hand had already been crushed. This pain traveled from her hand to her heart. This must be becuase the nerves of the fingertips were linked with the heart!

Gu Zhou stepped on the back of the woman’s left hand and crushed it. His expression was sinister, and his voice was like the Grim Reaper from hell. “How dare you touch me!”

The woman cried out in pain, not having the strength to answer Gu Zhou.

Seeing this woman in such a sorry state, Gu Zhou was still angry.

He was with Qiao Nian, but all of this had been disturbed by this crazy woman!

As the woman screamed, she looked up at Gu Zhou. She was a little stunned. Why would such a good-looking man have a tendency to domestic violence?

Besides, she had only touched his hand!

There were many men in her village who wanted her to touch their hands, but she was unwilling to!

Could this man have some kind of idea?

Qiao Nian must have brainwashed this man!

She regretted it. She should have listened to her mother and left quickly, not knocked on the door!

But it was too late now!

At the door of the living room, Qiao Nian had already seen everything. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. If she wasn’t wrong, Gu Zhou’s aversion to women had appeared again!

Gu Zhou’s aversion to women had almost disappeared, and now it had appeared for no reason. Could it be because that woman had held Gu Zhou’s hand just now?CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
