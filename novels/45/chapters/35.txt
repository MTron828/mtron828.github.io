Chapter 36: Outrageous

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Matriarch Shen and Matriarch Gu had always been close. At Matriarch Gu’s words, Matriarch Shen’s expression turned ugly as well.

Shen Xing stood rooted to the spot, stunned. Her face was extremely pale, and her lips were trembling. She swallowed nervously.

What was Matriarch Gu trying to say? Was she trying to say that she was framing Qiao Nian?

Shen Xing was about to take a step forward, but sensed that any movement would lead to a wardrobe malfunction. She had no choice but to stand on the spot, glaring at Qiao Nian viciously. She had initially wanted to harm Qiao Nian, but she had never expected that she herself would end up getting into trouble!

She knew very well that if she didn’t cast the blame on Qiao Nian, her future would be ruined.

“Qiao Nian, are you the one who drugged me? If you have any courage at all, then step forward!” Shen Xing yelled. She was determined to make sure that Qiao Nian was utterly destroyed. If she couldn’t ruin Qiao Nian, then her name wasn’t Shen Xing.

Once again, everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. There was no one present who didn’t know who Qiao Nian was. The moment Qiao Nian made her appearance at the banquet, she immediately became familiar to everyone present.

Qiao Nian stood there calmly, her lips pursed into a straight line. Looking at Shen Xing coldly, Qiao Nian began to walk towards her. Wherever she walked, the crowd parted automatically.

Qiao Nian met Shen Xing’s resentful gaze fearlessly, her red lips curving upwards. It was as though she was telling Shen Xing that if she committed any more unjust acts, she would bring about her own destruction!

Shen Xing looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes, and a tinge of panic flashed through her mind. She gripped the sleeves of the suit jacket uneasily, her heart beating wildly.

At this moment, Matriarch Shen’s eldest son, Shen Ming, arrived at the scene as well. Shen Ming was Shen Xing’s biological father.

Shen Ming stood rooted to the ground. Behind his gold-rimmed glasses, his dark eyes were filled with shock. He had no idea how to react.

That was his youngest daughter. She had been pampered and spoiled ever since she was young, but he never expected Shen Xing to do something so shameless in public.

In Shen Ming’s pocket, his right hand clenched into a tight fist. He willed himself not to explode.

Shen Xing saw that her father was at the scene as well. She had been on the verge of breaking down, but now her emotions quietened. Her tears fell uncontrollably, glittering strangely under the streetlights. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Father.” Shen Xing gripped the suit tightly, still uneasy. The suit had been given to her by Butler Shen. Without Butler Shen’s help, she could only stand there naked.

The socialites who were usually on good terms with Shen Xing silently distanced themselves from her. They were afraid that they would be labeled as Shen Xing’s good friend. If their reputations were affected by any gossip related to Shen Xing, it would be difficult for them to get married in the future.

Because of Shen Ming’s arrival, the surrounding people no longer dared to gossip carelessly. After all, the status of the Shen family was clear to everyone. Who would dare to challenge the Shen family? If they did, it would be impossible to even remain in An City.

“What on earth did you do?!” Shen Ming’s voice trembled with rage. He had never expected Shen Xing to do something so despicable.

Shen Xing looked at her father as though she was looking at her life savior. Tears of grievance fell as she said, “Father… it… it was Qiao Nian who set me up!”

Shen Xing’s words were like an explosive bomb, causing everyone to be dazed with shock. All the onlookers turned to look at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s expression was calm. She stood there nonchalantly, as though she were a lotus flower which had sprouted from mud, yet remained wholly untainted. It was as if everything happening around her had nothing to do with her.

Shen Ming and Matriarch Shen turned to look at Qiao Nian, their twin glares like a pair of sharp swords.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned cold. It seemed like the Shen family wanted her to be a scapegoat in order to clear Shen Xing’s name.

Following the other gentlemen, Su Yan arrived at the scene and saw Qiao Xin sitting at the side, her face pale. He walked towards her and asked worriedly, “Xin Xin, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

Qiao Xin looked up and shook her head gently. She turned to look at Qiao Nian, who was standing in the middle of the crowd some distance away. Adding fuel to the fire, Qiao Xin said, “Sister is in big trouble. Shen Xing doesn’t seem to like her at all.”

Before Su Yan arrived, he had already seen the comments in the group chat about how Qiao Nian had caused Shen Xing to lose her virginity. Now that he heard Qiao Xin’s words, he was even more certain that Qiao Nian was indeed the culprit.

Fortunately for him, he didn’t get together with Qiao Nian back then. What a vicious woman!

Su Yan glanced at Qiao Nian. She still looked pure and innocent. Looking at her face, he felt nauseous.

“Father,” Shen Xing sobbed. “You have to believe me… It really was Qiao Nian. I…” Shen Xing cried until she was out of breath, but did not forget to direct blame.

Shen Ming looked at Shen Xing, who was sobbing heart-wrenchingly. Shen Xing had been born in her parents’ later years, and Shen Ming had always doted on her the most. He looked toward Qiao Nian furiously and shouted, “Qiao Nian!”

Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. She stepped forward and said, “I refuse to believe that my granddaughter-in-law could be someone so despicable!”

Shen Xing could no longer care about her status as a socialite.. She took a step forward and pointed at Qiao Nian. “She’s escaped from the mental hospital!”
