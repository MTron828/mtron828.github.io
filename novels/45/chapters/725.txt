726 The Table Storm

In Lu Nian‚Äôs opinion, it was Qiao Nian who had helped Sugar repair the urn. Lu Nian was grateful to Qiao Nian, which was why he was sitting beside her.

During the meal, Gu Zhou picked up a piece of pork rib for Qiao Nian. Seeing Gu Zhou‚Äôs actions, a smile flashed in Lu Nian‚Äôs eyes.

Second Brother usually did not get close to women, and he did not allow any woman to approach him.

However, looking at the way Second Brother looked at Qiao Nian and his attitude towards her, Lu Nian was certain that Second Brother had fallen for Qiao Nian.

Sigh.

The sister he had just found was already his wife.

Every time he thought of this, Lu Nian felt very sad. If he had gone to look for his sister earlier, he might have reunited with her long ago.

As Lu Nian thought about this, he saw that Qiao Nian had been eating broccoli. He picked up a piece and placed it in Qiao Nian‚Äôs bowl.

Not far away, Song Yu had been secretly paying attention to Lu Nian. When she saw Lu Nian picking up food for Qiao Nian, she couldn‚Äôt help but tremble when she held her chopsticks. Soon, she regained her composure.

Song Yu had never expected Jiang Yue‚Äôs words to be true.

She thought that Jiang Yue wanted to use her feelings for Lu Nian to make her attack Qiao Nian.

She said that Qiao Nian and Lu Nian were on good terms.

At that time, she felt that even if Qiao Nian liked Lu Nian, it didn‚Äôt mean anything. After all, Second Brother didn‚Äôt like Qiao Nian.

But now, Song Yu felt that she had been wrong.

Song Yu tried her best to remain rational. As a bystander, she was now very certain that Gu Zhou and Lu Nian had extraordinary feelings for Qiao Nian.

What magic did Qiao Nian have to make so many people like her?

Song Yu lowered her gaze and ate silently, trying her best to ignore what she had just seen.

She knew very well now that if she attacked Qiao Nian like Jiang Yue, she might end up like Jiang Yue.

Lu Zhu, who was sitting not far away, had a cold expression. If only he could sit beside Sugar, he could pick up more of Sugar‚Äôs favorite dishes.

But now, such a good chance had been snatched away by Lu Nian.

If he had known, he wouldn‚Äôt have let Lu Nian and Sugar reunite.

That way, he could do such intimate things to Sugar without restraint.

Seeing Lu Nian‚Äôs attitude towards Qiao Nian, Matriarch Lu frowned slightly.

She was old, but she was not muddle-headed.

Second Brother had a cold personality and had never taken outsiders seriously.

Song Yu had lived in the Lu family for so many years, but her second son had never been so close to her.

Thinking of intimacy, Matriarch Lu glanced at Lu Qi again. Lu Qi and Lu Nian were quite close, and Lu Qi was Lu Nian‚Äôs biological sister.

Even so, Lu Nian had never been so intimate with Lu Qi. Follow the latest novels ùíêùíè nùíê/velbin(.)com

Could it be that Lu Nian liked Nian Nian?

When she realized this, Matriarch Lu couldn‚Äôt help but frown.

She knew Qiao Nian‚Äôs identity very well. If she remembered correctly, Lu Nian should also know Qiao Nian‚Äôs identity.

Was it really okay for Lu Nian to do this?

Wouldn‚Äôt Gu Zhou be angry?

Matriarch Lu‚Äôs gaze fell on Gu Zhou‚Äôs face again. Seeing how calm Gu Zhou was, and how he was still calmly picking up food for Qiao Nian, Matriarch Lu was stunned.

Didn‚Äôt Gu Zhou care about what Lu Nian had done?

No, no.

Matriarch Lu suddenly recalled that Gu Zhou and Lu Nian had grown up together. The two of them were especially close.

Could it be that Lu Nian felt that someone in the Lu family looked down on Nian Nian, so he was helping Gu Zhou take care of her?

After thinking through the key points, Matriarch Lu heaved a sigh of relief. Smiling, she instructed everyone to eat more.

After the meal, Qiao Nian was about to leave, but she recalled Jiang Yue‚Äôs words. She looked at Matriarch Lu and asked carefully, ‚ÄúMatriarch Lu and Miss Song, before Jiang Yue left, she said that she would leave something for me. Can I take a look?‚Äù

With that, Qiao Nian looked at Song Yu.

At the mention of Jiang Yue, Song Yu‚Äôs expression darkened. She had never expected Jiang Yue to take advantage of the relationship between them.

Seeing Matriarch Lu looking at her, Song Yu nodded.
