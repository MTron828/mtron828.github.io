Chapter 268: Imposter

After finishing the last note, Qiao Nian slowly opened her eyes, looking as if she hadn’t had enough. She seemed to be still immersed in the song.

Wang Xuan had been immersed in her thoughts. When she came back to her senses, she looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief and said in amazement, “Nian Nian, even your violin skills are better than our violin teacher’s. I think your violin skills are even better than your zither skills! You’re simply too amazing!”

Qiao Nian gave a faint smile and said, “There are many people who can play the violin better than me. This is nothing!”

“Okay.” Wang Xuan nodded. She understood that not every musician was as humble and polite as Qiao Nian. This was probably why Qiao Nian had been improving non-stop.

Because of Qiao Nian’s personality, she had a good impression of her.

After all, no one would dislike outstanding people.

Wang Xuan had heard Xia Xue play the violin at the welcoming banquet, but the difference between Xia Xue’s violin and Qiao Nian’s was too great.

Xia Xue played the violin like a toddler.

Qiao Nian played the violin like an outstanding model.

Wang Xuan turned to look at Lu Nian and found that his eyes were filled with surprise and amazement. It seemed that Mr. Dong Hua also liked Qiao Nian’s violin music.

Wang Xuan’s eyes darted to the side. She mustered her courage and turned to look at Lu Nian, asking curiously, “Mr. Dong Hua, I heard from the officials that you invited Senior Xia Xue from our faculty to participate in your concert. I want to know if Senior Xia Xue is better at the violin, or if Nian Nian is better.”

Wang Xuan’s question was very direct. In her opinion, Xia Xue’s violin skills could not compare to Qiao Nian’s at all.

Hearing Wang Xuan’s question, everyone looked at Lu Nian. They wanted to hear Lu Nian’s answer.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Li nervously. She was curious about what flaws her violin playing had. Moreover, she was also curious about how good Xia Xue was at the violin.

At this moment, Lu Nian didn’t answer Wang Xuan directly. Instead, he looked at Qiao Nian intently and asked, “Did you go to training room 23 yesterday afternoon?”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly and took out her phone from her pocket. Yesterday, for the sake of peace and quiet, she had specially chosen a relatively remote training room.

She opened the school map on her phone and found the training room. Looking at the number 23 written on the training room, she nodded and said, “I’ve been there.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“What time?” Lu Nian asked.

Qiao Nian thought for a while. Her memories of yesterday were a little blurry. She said, “I can’t remember the details, so I played a song in the training room and rushed back before class.”

Wang Xuan recalled how Gao Lin had strutted around in front of them this morning. Moreover, Gao Lin had also mentioned that Brother Cao had heard Xia Xue playing the violin in that training room. That was why he had asked Xia Xue to be the female musician at Mr. Dong Hua’s concert.

Suddenly, Wang Xuan’s heart began to race uncontrollably. She had a bold thought.

Could it be that Xia Xue had impersonated her yesterday afternoon?

At the thought of this, she hurriedly helped Qiao Nian recall the past. She said, “Nian Nian only had a 4.30 p.m. lute lesson yesterday afternoon. Did you walk back to the classroom on your bicycle or on foot?”

“Walk.”

Wang Xuan lowered her gaze and calculated the distance from the classroom to training room 23. She said, “If you walk, the journey will take at least half an hour. If you have class at 4:30 p.m., that means you’ll leave that training room at 4:00 p.m. at the latest.”

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement. After Wang Xuan’s reminder, she suddenly recalled something and said, “After I finished playing the violin, I took a look at the watch on my wrist and realized that it was already 3:28 p.m.. I left the training room in a hurry and prepared to return to class.”
