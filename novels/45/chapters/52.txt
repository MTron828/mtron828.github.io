Her eyes were like those of a nervous little deer, innocently confused. It made one’s heart race.

“I’ve brought you the silver needles.” Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and handed her the silver needles.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou, her gaze gradually losing focus. Slowly, she closed her eyes and fell asleep.

Seeing that Qiao Nian looked a little strange, Gu Zhou began to lift her out of the bathtub. However, he soon discovered that Qiao Nian was burning hot. She seemed to be having a fever.

Gu Zhou hurriedly picked up a towel and wrapped it around Qiao Nian before lifting her up, then carried her to the bed.

Carefully, he placed Qiao Nian on the bed. After some hesitation, he called his attending doctor, Lu Yan.

When Lu Yan walked into the bedroom, he saw that the floor was covered in water. Seeing that Gu Zhou was drenched as well, he almost fell to the ground in shock.

What was going on?

Wasn’t Gu Zhou afraid of women?

Was he actually having fun with a woman?

Had they been fooling around in the shower?

Looking towards Gu Zhou, Lu Yan gave him a friendly reminder. “Ah Zhou, you should be wearing a bathrobe.”

Gu Zhou frowned slightly, looking at Lu Yan in confusion.

“If you’re fooling around in the shower, shouldn’t you be wearing a bathrobe?”

As Lu Yan spoke, he pictured Gu Zhou together with a mysterious woman in the bathroom. He couldn’t help but smile.

“Ah Zhou, don’t tell me you’ve gotten rid of that young lady?” Lu Yan smiled at Gu Zhou, his eyebrows raised. He said maliciously, “You have to learn to be gentle with the fairer sex…”

Upon hearing Lu Yan’s words, Gu Zhou frowned. “What nonsense are you spouting? Come here! Treat her!”

Lu Yan walked to the bed and saw a young lady with a towel wrapped around her. The young lady’s hair was wet and she was soaked to the bone. She looked quite like a sleeping beauty from a fairy tale.

Lu Yan looked at the young lady. She looked a little familiar, but he didn’t think he had seen her before. After all, no one would forget a good-looking young lady.

“You must have been ramping it up. In the future, you shouldn’t make the young lady faint.” Lu Yan took out his medicine box and began to examine the patient.

“Put away your dirty thoughts.” Gu Zhou sat at the side coldly, looking at Lu Yan with disdain.

“What do you mean by dirty? How can the relationship between a man and a woman be considered dirty? It’s clearly called making love!” Lu Yan glanced at Gu Zhou and teased, “I remember in the past, if a young lady happened to brush your hand, you would wash your hands for nearly half an hour. Have you recovered from your phobia of women?”

Upon hearing Lu Yan’s words, Gu Zhou recalled the incidents in the past. He really didn’t like being touched by women.

However, Qiao Nian was an exception.

“I’ve gotten married,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

When Lu Yan heard this, he was astonished.

He had thought that Gu Zhou would be alone and single for the rest of his life.

He had never expected Gu Zhou to get married before him.

It took him a long time to recover from the shock.

“Did your grandmother force you to get married?” Lu Yan felt that only Grandma Gu had the ability to force Gu Zhou to get married.

“You’re spouting quite a bit of nonsense today.” Gu Zhou looked up at Lu Yan, frowning.

“By the way, who are you married to?” Lu Yan asked as he finished examining Qiao Nian’s health. He began to put her on an IV drip.

“The lady on the bed.”

Lu Yan glanced at the young lady on the bed, then looked at Gu Zhou with a sly smile. “Have you fallen for her looks?”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to reply, Lu Yan continued, “I think you’re quite compatible with her. The two of you have quite compatible good looks too!”

Upon hearing Lu Yan’s words, Gu Zhou snapped, “When will she wake up?”

“She’ll wake up around the second half of the night. By then, her fever should have subsided,” Lu Yan said with a serious expression.

“I don’t want anyone else to know about what happened today,” Gu Zhou said, his face blank.

“Why not? Marriage is a joyous occasion.” Lu Yan did not see Gu Zhou’s face turn darker and darker, and continued to dance on the fine line between life and death. “If you ask me, I think you should announce your marriage to the public. That way, you can let the outside world know that the Second Young Master Gu is very handsome, and not the ugly wretch he’s rumored to be!”

“Do you still remember the way home?”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Lu Yan was stunned. It wasn’t as if he had a poor sense of direction. How could he not know the way home?

However, in the next moment, Lu Yan realized that Gu Zhou was commanding him to leave.
