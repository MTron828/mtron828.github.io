Chapter 423: Cutting

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened. She asked, “Is it because this stone is cheap that you can cut it casually? Are you really a qualified cutter?”

A trace of impatience flashed across Zhang Yong’s face as he said angrily, “It’s impossible for such a cheap stone to have good jade. A layman like you shouldn’t talk nonsense if you don’t understand!”

Qiao Nian walked up to Zhang Yong and said coldly, “Then I’ll cut it myself!”

When the others heard Qiao Nian’s words, they were all stunned.

Even Lu Zhu and Qiao Yu, who had rushed over from afar, were a little surprised.

They hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to know how to cut raw stones.

Ah Rao’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face, and the corners of his lips curled up slightly. He hadn’t expected the employer Brother Ah Zhou had arranged for him to be so interesting.

“Look at her. She’s pretending again. She thinks she’s a master!”

“Sigh, she’s too good at showing off. Seeing how confident she is, I think there might be imperial green jade in here!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Apart from bragging, she’s nothing!”

… .

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Zhang Yong said angrily, “You know how to use my cutting machine?”

At this moment, the cutting master called out coldly, “Ah Yong!”

......

Zhang Yong reluctantly retreated to the side.

The old master could tell that this young lady might really be capable. She might really be an expert in stone gambling. Not to mention anything else, her bodyguard did not look like an ordinary person.

Zhang Yong stood at the side and did not say anything. One had to know that even Mr. Chen had to give his master some face. He did not expect to be insulted here!

Zhang Yong said coldly, “Since you know how to cut, do it!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on the old master’s face. She smiled gently and said politely, “Thank you!”

“Miss, you’re too polite. Call me if you need anything!”

Qiao Nian nodded and calmly put on her gloves.

More and more people gathered around, looking at Qiao Nian as if they were watching a show. They were waiting for Qiao Nian to make a fool of herself in front of everyone. When she did, they would then humiliate and mock her.

Qiao Nian calmly turned on the light. As she didn’t see any icy colors, she brushed the dust off the surface of the stone.

When the old master saw Qiao Nian’s technique, his eyes lit up slightly. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to use such a high-level method to cut a stone. It had to be known that usually, people who used this method would cut raw materials that were worth millions.

Zhang Yong really hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to know such a cutting method, and he was also learning it.

When the others saw Qiao Nian’s expression, they only felt that she was putting on an act.

Just as everyone felt that Qiao Nian was especially good at bragging and was about to leave, they saw that Qiao Nian had cut the stone.

Everyone was stunned.

God, she actually knew how to cut.

Not only that, but the others could also see the icy color on the surface of the material.

Although only a little of it was exposed, it was enough to shock everyone.

This lousy stone that cost two hundred yuan actually had ice jade?

When Gao Hong saw this, she sneered and mocked, “It’s normal for there to be icy colors in this stone. I reckon it can be worth dozens of yuan!”

When Gao Hong said that, the others calmed down.

“The raw stones that were sent over today must have been brought over from the Emerald Mountains. It’s only natural that they could be cut to reveal ice jade.”

“That’s right. Besides, there’s only so little ice jade. What’s so strange about it!”

“Maybe it’s just a coincidence that the entire stone has this small amount of ice jade!”

“Great minds think alike. That’s what I thought!”

“Let’s wait and see how she acts!”
