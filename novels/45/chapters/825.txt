826 I Promise!

Song Man looked at how obedient and adorable Xiao Shi was. This was how she had been since she was young. The difficult times in the past had all been spent with her.

She met Xiao Shi’s injured eyes and nodded. “Xiao Shi, don’t worry. Mommy will never hit you again!”

Xiao Shi couldn’t help but smile. She looked at Song Man’s face and said softly, “Mommy, the person I loved the most in this world is you. I loved you much more than you loved me. You are the only one in my world!”

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi’s words, she nodded with red-rimmed eyes.

Xiao Shi’s eyes grew redder and redder. She sniffled and explained, “I know that before Mommy gave birth to me, you had your own life. Your life must have been simple and happy. Because of me, Mommy drew a line between herself and the past. But ever since I was born, there was only Mommy!”

“When Mommy hit me, my body didn’t hurt, but her heart ached. I would be very sad!”

Hearing Xiao Shi’s words, Song Man’s heart jumped to her throat.

She had always known that Xiao Shi loved her. She cared about Xiao Shi too. Xiao Shi was the one who had brought her out of the dark world.

Although she had apologized every time, she had never thought that Xiao Shi would feel terrible.

She understood that the pain in her heart was harder to heal than the physical pain.

She had always felt that she was an unfortunate person.

The world owed her that.

However, in the face of Xiao Shi’s unconditional reliance and pure love, she felt the air gradually thin. She was suffocating.

“When I was young, it was always Mommy…”

When she was young, her eyes were like black grapes. She looked at Song Man with sparkling eyes and asked expectantly, “Mommy, the past is in the past. Mommy will never hit me again, okay?”

Song Man nodded solemnly. “Okay!”

When she heard Song Man’s words, a happy smile appeared on her face.

Seeing that Xiao Shi was in a good mood, Song Man thought of Qiao Nian’s face and hesitated for a moment before asking, “Xiao Shi, can you promise Mommy something?”

“Huh?” Xiao Shi looked at Song Man in confusion.

Song Man touched Xiao Shi’s face. Even if it wasn’t her plan, she didn’t want Xiao Shi to get too close to Qiao Nian.

Xiao Shi was hers. She couldn’t let Qiao Nian snatch her away.

“Xiao Shi, can you not speak to Qiao Nian in the future?” Song Man asked carefully.

In this world, only Xiao Shi had the purest form of love for her.

The others were all fake.

When she heard Song Man’s words, the smile on her face gradually froze, and her eyes were filled with confusion.

Why didn’t Mommy let her speak to Auntie Nian Nian?

Auntie Nian Nian was so gentle and kind. She even told her bedtime stories!

She really wanted to speak to Auntie Nian Nian.

She felt that Auntie Nian Nian was really gentle and warm.

Xiao Shi bit her lip. She did not want to lie to her mommy about such things. She shook her head. “Mommy, I…”

“Xiao Shi, I know you’re still young. There are some things you don’t understand!” Song Man could tell what Xiao Shi wanted to say and interrupted her without hesitation. Without waiting for Xiao Shi to speak, she held his hand and walked into the house. “Actually, Xiao Shi is also the most important to Mommy!”

When Xiao Shi heard Song Man say this, her eyes lit up. She looked up at Song Man and met her smiling eyes.

At this moment, she felt so happy.

Xiao Shi followed Song Man into the house. Just as she was about to speak, she saw that the living room was in a mess. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Mommy used to like to smash things when she was angry.

In the past, every time Mommy broke the bowls and chopsticks, she still had to think about earning money to buy new bowls and chopsticks.

The things in this villa might be very expensive. She wondered when she would be able to repay what her mommy had smashed.

Mommy must have been very angry just now.

Xiao Shi frowned. Her gaze inadvertently fell on the blood-stained fruit knife. Her expression instantly became nervous as she asked anxiously, “Mommy, are you injured? Where are you injured? Let me take a look!”
