Chapter 340: Apologizing

“Oh, my dear Young Mistress, calm down. I’ll issue a notice to fire her right now! Don’t be angry. Don’t ruin your health!”

Qiao Nian gave an indifferent reply. Just as she was about to hang up, she heard Qin Chuan ask, “Miss, did you ask me to reschedule the charity auction to tonight because of this?”

“What else could it be?”

Qin Chuan smiled and said, “Alright, I understand now. Don’t be angry anymore!”

“Find a teacher with better morals to teach the children of this class. Don’t send any animals to this class!” Qiao Nian said indifferently.

When Qin Chuan heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was slightly stunned. He asked curiously, “May I ask who’s in this class? Why are you so nervous?”

“Just do as I say!” With that, Qiao Nian hung up without hesitation.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Qin Lu’s face. She narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes. “There’s only one type of person in this world who is the lowest of the low, and that’s someone who doesn’t have a shred of respect for anyone.”

When Qin Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, her expression froze and her eyes darkened. She hated the word “lowly”.

She had no choice but to choose her family background. If she had been the daughter of an ordinary family, she would not have been so delusional. However, her mother’s family was a well-known family in An City, but her mother’s family was unwilling to acknowledge her.

Only the auntie took pity on her, so she arranged for her to teach here.

She was used to seeing upper-class people. She really wanted to become one.

“Who are you scolding?”

Qiao Nian gave a cold smile and continued, “One idiot just can’t hold her breath. Why would she still ask such a stupid question? Looks like your IQ isn’t that high either. Do you want me to send you to a disabled school? The teachers there will teach you well!”

When Qin Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she got up from the ground in a rage and raised her hand to hit her.

Without hesitation, Qiao Nian kicked Qin Lu away.

Qin Lu fell to the ground again, her face pale from the pain. Just as she was about to curse, her phone suddenly rang.

Qin Lu took out her phone and realized that the call was from the auntie. Tears of grievance rolled down her face as she said tearfully, “Auntie, come over quickly. There’s a parent in our school who’s hitting me right now. You have to help me…”

However, Qin Lu did not hear her aunt’s comforting voice. “Tell me, did you provoke some big shot?”

Qin Lu stopped crying. “No, I didn’t provoke anyone. He’s just a brat with no background!”

The person on the other end of the line was stunned. She said meaningfully, “Are you out of your mind? Do you think a child who can attend this kindergarten doesn’t have a powerful background? Do you know that the less obvious a child’s background is, the more influential he is? I worked hard to get connections and send you here so that you can work hard. I didn’t do this for you to offend people!”

“Auntie really doesn’t have any background. His father seems to be a security guard in a neighborhood.”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Lu’s words, she was completely certain that Qin Lu was only doing this because of the children’s background. Such a snobbish person should have been kicked out long ago.

No wonder Qin Lu had deleted the WeChat contact on Gu Qi’s phone yesterday and scolded Gu Qi today. It seemed that she felt that Gu Qi had no background.

“Shut up. I told you to apologize. Hurry up and apologize!” Qin Lu’s aunt said in exasperation.

“But she hit me. I’m in so much pain now. She should be the one apologizing to me!”

Qin Lu’s aunt also knew what kind of person Qin Lu was. She couldn’t be bothered to say anything else. “Do whatever you want. Just wait and see!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

When Qin Lu heard this, his expression froze. “Auntie, what do you mean?”
