Chapter 491: He’s Protecting Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Xin was talking about the first night she came here. In other words, Gu Zhou had come to look for her at that time. Moreover, Gu Zhou had told her not to tell anyone else, saying that he didn’t want to expose his whereabouts.

Could it be that Gu Zhou secretly did it?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian walked back to the door of the ward. She gently opened the door and whispered to Gu Zhou, “Gu Zhou, can you come out for a moment?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou stood up and walked out, closing the door behind him.

Qiao Nian went straight to the point. “Did you knock Qiao Xin out and send her back to An City?”

Gu Zhou gave Qiao Nian a puzzled look and shook his head. “No.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian was stunned. Then, she briefly mentioned Qiao Xin’s disappearance to Gu Zhou.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s question, Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly. “Why do you think so?”

“Because you said that night that you didn’t want anyone to know that you were here. I thought that you were afraid that Qiao Xin would expose your whereabouts, so you sent her back.”

Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually darkened, and his voice deepened as he asked, “Are you sure she saw me coming here?”

“Yes, but she didn’t recognize you yet. She wanted to secretly take a photo and send it to you,” Qiao Nian said. She could hear the nervousness in Gu Zhou’s voice. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gu Zhou quickly took out his phone and made a call. “Help me check the surveillance video of the corridor on the second floor of the hotel after Ah Miao’s death. Send it to me.”

With that, Gu Zhou hung up.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. She felt that his reaction was a little strange.

Actually, Qiao Nian had wanted to rely on her hacking skills to check the hotel’s videos. But since Gu Zhou had done so, could it be that he had already guessed who had done it? He just wanted to confirm it again.

Within fifteen minutes, the surveillance video was sent.

Qiao Nian looked over. She wanted to see who had knocked Qiao Xin out.

In the video, she and Gu Zhou entered the room one after another.

Not long after, Qiao Xin appeared in the corridor. Qiao Xin sneaked into the room beside her, and a man in black followed her.

Just as Qiao Nian had expected, Qiao Xin didn’t recognize Gu Zhou.

The man in black behind Qiao Xin also entered Qiao Xin’s room. Not long after, the man in black carried Qiao Xin out.

Qiao Nian noticed that when Gu Zhou was watching this video, his hands were clenched so tightly that his knuckles turned white.

Could it be that Gu Zhou knew this man?

He seemed to have an unusual relationship with this man?

The man in the video kept his head down. The surveillance cameras didn’t capture his face. From the video, he looked to be about six feet three.

As everyone’s attention was on the dead Ah Miao, no one noticed that Qiao Xin had gone missing.

Gu Zhou’s face darkened as he pressed the black screen.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. Seeing that he was frowning deeply, she asked, “He seems to be protecting your whereabouts. Who is he?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his throat moved slightly. A glint flashed across his eyes, and his voice was a little hoarse. “Do you mean that he’s protecting me?”

Qiao Nian could sense that Gu Zhou was in a bad mood.

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “At that time, you told me that it wasn’t convenient for you to expose your whereabouts. Moreover, you were injured at that time. It’s obvious that you were in a dangerous situation. If Qiao Xin spread the news of you being in the hotel, the consequences would have been unimaginable.”

Qiao Nian continued, “This man helped you solve this problem. In my opinion, he’s just silently protecting you.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes, and there was a complicated look in them.
