859 Straightforward Man

Gu Zhou felt that Song Man was really too noisy. Her voice gave him a headache. His gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face and he asked, “Do you need me to help you stabilize her?”

Song Man’s tears instantly fell.

Qiao Nian said awkwardly, “There’s no need. I can do it myself!”

Qiao Nian looked at Song Man and saw that she was crying pitifully. She said, “Miss Song, no matter what, we need a DNA report to acknowledge our family. Are you really not going to cooperate?”

Song Man knew that it was useless to pretend to be weak. She looked at Gu Zhou. “Are you suspecting Xiao Shi?”

“I’m just suspecting you!” Gu Zhou said mercilessly.

Song Man felt terrible.

After Qiao Nian finished drawing Song Man’s blood, she nodded at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou looked at Song Man, his eyes cold. He said coldly, “The Gu family values blood ties very much. I have to be 100% sure who the mother of my child is. So let me tell you, whether you’re Xiao Shi’s mother or not, I’ll bring Xiao Shi back to the Gu family!”

“If you’re not Xiao Shi’s mother, then you should think about how you’ll live in the future!” Gu Zhou said coldly. The way he looked at Song Man was like winter frost.

Song Man gasped. She had never expected Gu Zhou to say such a thing.

She had always thought that Gu Zhou was just a cold-faced but warm-hearted person. But now, it seemed that he was like an emotionless machine, no different from a cold-blooded animal.

That wasn’t right.

Song Man glanced at Qiao Nian, who was standing not far away. Just now, at the entrance of the villa, Gu Zhou had looked at Qiao Nian as if he wanted to eat her up. His gaze was as passionate as fire, as if Qiao Nian was the only one in Gu Zhou’s entire world.

After Qiao Nian sorted out the samples, she stood up straight and looked at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou nodded slightly and asked casually, “Xiao Shi?”

Song Man sniffled, her eyes turning redder and redder. She took out a tissue and silently wiped her tears. “She’s still sleeping!”

Hearing Song Man’s words, Qiao Nian frowned.

It was already four in the afternoon.

According to Lin Tao, Xiao Shi slept from one to two in the afternoon.

Logically speaking, Xiao Shi should have woken up long ago.

Xiao Shi was so obedient and sensible. How could she have slept for so long?

When she was in Hai Cheng, she had to work every day. How could she have slept for so long during her lunch break? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but worry.

At this moment, Song Man began to panic. She looked at Gu Zhou with teary eyes and asked anxiously, “Aren’t the results of the appraisal not out yet? Are you going to take her away now?”

Gu Zhou said coldly, “I think you should see a neurosurgeon. I made it very clear just now. No matter what the results are today, I’ll take Xiao Shi away!”

Song Man pursed her lips.

The reason why she could stay in the Dongjiang villa fearlessly was entirely because of Xiao Shi.

Xiao Shi was her protective umbrella.

Xiao Shi was also her bargaining chip with the Gu family.

If she was brought back to the Gu family, how would she negotiate with Gu Zhou in the future? How would she marry Gu Zhou?

“No, absolutely not. I won’t allow you to take Xiao Shi away. Xiao Shi is my daughter. She has to stay by my side,” Song Man said anxiously.

Seeing Gu Zhou’s indifferent expression, Song Man continued, “Children can’t leave their mother’s side. If you forcefully take her away, it might affect her life!”

All of Gu Zhou’s patience disappeared. He looked at Song Man coldly, as if he was looking at trash. “If I let Xiao Shi stay by your side forever, it will be even worse for her growth!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Song Man’s expression changed. Could it be that Gu Zhou already knew about Hai Cheng?

Therefore, Gu Zhou was taking revenge on her.

Actually, Gu Zhou had already asked Chen Qing to keep an eye on the Dongjiang villa.

Even though Song Man had performed well in the Dongjiang villa and would take the initiative to help, in Gu Zhou’s opinion, the person who took the initiative had always been Xiao Shi.
