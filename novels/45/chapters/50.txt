Chapter 51: Flaring Up

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Her entire body felt weak. Stumbling, she fell backwards.

Gu Zhou had long since sensed that something was wrong with Qiao Nian’s expression. He followed behind her.

Seeing that she was about to fall, he quickly stepped forward to support her.

The familiar scent of ambergris wafted towards her. In a daze, she opened her eyes, her gaze landing on the man’s face. In a soft voice, she murmured, “Gu Zhou…”

Gu Zhou bent down and picked Qiao Nian up in his arms, bridal style.

Chen Qing, who was standing to the side, was completely stunned.

Didn’t the Second Young Master have a phobia of women?

When did he recover from that illness?

Why wasn’t he aware?

Gu Zhou took two steps forward. Seeing that Chen Qing was still standing there blankly, he frowned.

“Drive to the hospital!”

Chen Qing came back to his senses and quickly nodded. “Yes, sir.”

Once they got into the car, Gu Zhou’s eyes flashed. He ordered, “Head straight home!”

Chen Qing glanced in the rearview mirror. Qiao Nian was in Gu Zhou’s arms, and her face was flushed red, as if she had a fever.

Why didn’t the Second Young Master ask him to send Qiao Nian to the hospital?

Chen Qing could not figure it out, but he did not dare to ask.

Looking at the woman in his arms, who seemed to be in extreme discomfort, Gu Zhou began to grow anxious as well.

Qiao Nian opened her eyes slowly, her gaze unfocused. She asked, “Gu Zhou, how long will it take to get home?”

Her voice was no longer as cold as it usually was. Instead, it seemed a shade more alluring than usual.

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. He looked up at Chen Qing. “Pull up the rear view mirror. Turn the volume of the music up to the loudest.”

Although Chen Qing didn’t know what Gu Zhou meant to do, he still obeyed.

Qiao Nian’s face grew redder and redder. Her eyes seemed to glaze over as she tossed and turned restlessly in Gu Zhou’s arms.

But to Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian seemed to be trying to seduce him.

He lowered his head and glanced at Qiao Nian. Her face was covered in sweat, and there was a unique fragrance surrounding her. He felt as if he had previously smelled this fragrance somewhere, but at that moment, he couldn’t remember where.

Qiao Nian reached out and grabbed his tie, her fingers climbing further up. She loosened his tie and casually tossed it aside, then reached out to unbutton his shirt.

Her hand inadvertently touched his skin. Immediately, she felt a chill. This chill was clearly capable of quenching the overwhelming heat in her body.

Qiao Nian sat up, her fingers sliding under Gu Zhou’s shirt, which she had begun to unbutton.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s bold actions, Gu Zhou’s brow furrowed deeper and deeper. When he saw that they had reached home, he immediately took off his suit jacket, covering Qiao Nian with it without hesitation. Then, he carried her into the villa. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When they arrived at his room, Gu Zhou kicked the door open. He lowered Qiao Nian into the bathtub and turned on the showerhead.

The cold water ran down her head and over her entire body. Qiao Nian shivered once from the cold, and found that she was suddenly a lot more awake.

Although the water was a little cold, soaking in it actually helped to relieve her discomfort.

After a long while, Qiao Nian finally opened her eyes. When she saw Gu Zhou leaning against the bathroom door, she gave a sweet smile.

She leaned weakly against the side of the bathtub, her gaze landing on Gu Zhou’s face. “Thank you, Young Master Gu, for saving me.”

At Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou found himself suddenly recalling how she had touched his chest just now. He said expressionlessly, “There’s no need to thank me.”

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She was completely soaked in water. Her evening gown clung to her body, and her long hair clung to her back. She made a charming picture.

“Do you still want to seek revenge?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she laughed.

How could the enmity between her and the Qiao family be resolved so easily?

Of course, she wanted revenge, but beyond that, she wanted to ruin them.

Qiao Nian naturally wouldn’t tell him. Sensing that the heat in her body had dissipated, she looked toward Gu Zhou helplessly. “Young Master Gu, I should be able to get up now.”

Gu Zhou walked up to Qiao Nian and bent down to pick her up. She was still soaked.

Qiao Nian obediently wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck.. If she hadn’t sealed her acupoints beforehand, she wouldn’t have been so physically weak right now.
