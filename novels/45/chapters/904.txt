905 Lying

This time, Qiao Nian understood. Gu Zhou must have asked Gu Qi to make this call. It was already three in the morning, but Gu Zhou had actually woken Gu Qi up. Did Gu Zhou know that children had to sleep early at night?

Qiao Nian sighed helplessly and said, “There’s really no need. After I’m done, I can go home by myself!”

There was no more movement on the other side of the phone.

Seeing that the call was still connected, Qiao Nian called out in confusion, “Xiao Qi?”

“Nian’er, it’s me.” Suddenly, Gu Zhou’s low and hoarse voice came through the phone.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, the blood drained from her face.

The events of that night surged into her mind, catching her off guard. Fear instantly surrounded her.

Qiao Nian’s entire body was cold. Her phone trembled slightly, as if it was being gripped tightly by an invisible hand. She couldn’t say a word, immersed in the memories of that night.

At this moment, Gu Zhou’s voice came through the phone again.

“Xiao Shi just woke up from her dream. I don’t know how to coax her. Can you come back early to coax her?”

Qiao Nian gradually came back to her senses. Thinking of Xiao Shi’s adorable face, she hesitated for a moment before answering, “Yes.”

Xiao Shi had seen Song Man jump down from the window with her own eyes. If she could not help Xiao Shi tide through this crisis, she might be covered in this shadow for the rest of her life.

She couldn’t let Xiao Shi live in fear forever, like her.

“How… is she now?”

“I don’t think she’s too good.”

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She had completely forgotten the fear of that night. Her mind was filled with Xiao Shi.

She could no longer sit still. She said, “I’ll go back now!”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Qiao Nian hung up and walked out.

…

When Qiao Nian returned to the Gu family villa, it was already half past four in the morning.

She parked the car and looked at the brightly lit Gu family villa with a complicated expression. She got out of the car and walked in.

The dolls and balloons in the garden had already been put away and returned to their usual calm.

Qiao Nian walked in step by step. She recalled how she had held Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s hands just now. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The scene changed. She recalled the first time she had seen Gu Zhou.

Back then, Gu Zhou had been very wary of her. She had spent a lot of effort to get Gu Zhou to lower his guard against her.

For some reason, she recalled Gu Zhou’s confession to her.

The sweet memories and the pain of the past were mixed together. Qiao Nian’s frown deepened.

The most important thing now was to comfort Xiao Shi.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian quickly walked in. When she walked into the living room, she saw Gu Zhou leaning against the sofa.

When Gu Zhou saw Qiao Nian enter, he put down the book in his hand and looked up at her, his gaze gentle and deep.

Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s gaze and recalled what had happened that night. She couldn’t help but feel nervous. She clenched her fists tightly.

Gu Zhou didn’t seem to notice that something was wrong with Qiao Nian’s expression. He stood up and walked towards her.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly. Every step Gu Zhou took seemed to be walking on her heart. When Gu Zhou stood in front of her, she felt as if Gu Zhou was already holding a knife to her heart.

If Gu Zhou casually moved his knife, she might die without a burial ground.

Qiao Nian took a step back. She didn’t want to be so close to Gu Zhou. Only when the two of them were far apart would she feel safe.

Gu Zhou pretended not to notice Qiao Nian’s small actions and asked calmly, “How’s the investigation going?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s question, she shook her head gently and said, “The other party hid it very well. We haven’t found anything yet.”

“Are you feeling unwell? You look terrible.” Gu Zhou took a step forward and reached out to touch Qiao Nian’s forehead.

However, before Gu Zhou’s hand could touch Qiao Nian’s forehead, Qiao Nian took another step back. She looked away and said, “How is Xiao Shi now? Let’s go see her!”
