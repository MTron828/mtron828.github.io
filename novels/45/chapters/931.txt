932 Threat

The Lu family stood at the top of An City.

The Lu family could make the Qiao family disappear from An City with a flick of their fingers.

Previously, she had been feeling smug. Thinking about how Qiao Nian had killed Song Man, she felt that Qiao Nian would definitely be torn to pieces by the Lu family. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But now she understood that she was just a clown.

!!

Qiao Nian should have known about her identity as the eldest daughter of the Lu family long ago. No wonder Qiao Nian had looked at her with disdain when she left.

At that time, Qiao Nian probably didn’t expose her on purpose because she wanted her to embarrass herself.

Qiao Nian was really heart-wrenching!!

Lu Zhu’s gaze instantly turned cold. His gaze was like an ice blade in the winter, bone-chilling. His thin lips parted slightly. “When did you meet Song Man? How well do you know her? You’d better answer my question honestly!”

Qiao Xin met Lu Zhu’s eyes and shivered in fear. She felt as if there were thousands of arrows aimed at her. It was like if she said anything wrong, thousands of arrows would pierce her heart.

Lu Zhu’s questions were similar to Qiao Nian’s. She finally understood why Lu Zhu was willing to meet her. He should be investigating the truth of the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Song family more than twenty years ago.

Qiao Nian’s blood flowed in Song Man’s body, so they felt that Song Man might be related to that incident more than twenty years ago.

She still remembered the first time she saw Song Man.

Song Man exuded a faint fragrance. Her movements were elegant, and she exuded a noble aura.

At that time, Qiao Xin thought to herself that Song Man was indeed the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Even though she had been wandering outside for many years, the elegance she exuded was still not something that the daughters of ordinary large families could compare to.

Now that she thought about it carefully, Song Man was definitely not a simple person. What Song Man had said to her was just to make use of her again. She had never thought of getting along well with her.

Lu Zhu frowned slightly. Seeing that Qiao Xin had no intention of speaking, his patience ran out. He took out a pistol from his waist and aimed it at Qiao Xin’s forehead!

Qiao Xin screamed in fear, her body trembling. She swallowed nervously.

She knew in her heart that if her answer did not satisfy Lu Zhu, he might really kill her.

Although murder was a crime, the Lu family was extremely powerful. Lu Zhu would not be harmed at all.

Was she really going to die?

No, as long as she told the truth, she wouldn’t die.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin swallowed and said eagerly, “I didn’t take the initiative to find Song Man. Song Man did.”

Qiao Xin saw that Lu Zhu was considering her words seriously. She was afraid that his hands would tremble.

“I don’t know where she got my contact information either. At that time, I thought she was a liar. Only after she showed me her DNA report did I believe her. She seemed to know very well about what had happened between Qiao Nian and me, and that I knew you. She wanted me to introduce her to you…” Qiao Xin said fearfully. “This happened half a month ago. In the past, I really didn’t know her!”

Qiao Xin stood there trembling, not daring to look into Lu Zhu’s eyes.

However, when Qiao Xin heard the sound of the pistol being loaded, she was stunned. She looked at Lu Zhu in fear and subconsciously took a step back.

She had really told him everything. Why did Lu Zhu still want to kill her?

When she felt Lu Zhu’s pistol pressed against her forehead, her legs couldn’t help but tremble.

Lu Zhu said coldly, “Introduce her to me?”

Qiao Xin’s legs trembled even more. She could clearly sense that Lu Zhu really had the intention to kill her.

“She… she wants to acknowledge the Lu family…” Qiao Xin’s voice was filled with tears. “Mr. Lu, that’s all I know. I don’t know anything else. Actually, I’m also a victim. I was deceived by her. If you don’t believe me, you can investigate. I dare to swear that everything I say is true!”

Lu Zhu narrowed his eyes. Recalling what Qiao Xin had done to Sugar, he continued, “So, you want to join forces with her to deal with Qiao Nian, right?”
