Chapter 1823 - 1823 Undoing the Knot in His Heart

His heart ached as he looked at Xiao Bao in front of him. He could not help but raise his hand to comfort him like before and pat his little head. However, he seemed to have thought of something and retracted his hand helplessly.

Xiao Shi looked at Chang Feng’s actions and her eyes could not help but turn red. She could feel from Chang Feng’s words and actions that he cared a lot about Xiao Bao.

Xiao Shi sniffed and reached out to hug Lu Nian’s neck. Her voice was a little choked. “Uncle, I feel so sad to see Uncle Chang Feng like this.”

Lu Nian tilted his head and looked at Xiao Shi beside him. His eyes were filled with a doting smile. He gently rubbed his forehead against Xiao Shi’s and said gently, “Be good.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Qiao Nian noticed Chang Feng’s actions. She wanted to stop Eldest Senior Brother. If Eldest Senior Brother touched Xiao Bao, he might be agitated again.

Seeing that Xiao Bao refused to communicate with Eldest Senior Brother, Qiao Nian felt that she couldn’t let Xiao Bao misunderstand him anymore. She could take this opportunity to let them reconcile.

Eldest Senior Brother and Xiao Bao clearly cared about each other very much. Why did they have to misunderstand each other and torture each other by enduring the pain?

Chang Feng took a deep look at Xiao Bao and turned to leave.

At this moment, a sobbing voice shouted hysterically, “Uncle Chang Feng!”

Chang Feng stopped in his tracks.

“You want to leave me behind again. If I hadn’t discovered you, would you not have planned to see me?” Xiao Bao cried aggrievedly.

Everyone present looked at Xiao Bao.

Chang Feng turned to look at Xiao Bao, not hiding his surprise.

He originally thought that Xiao Bao was angry with him and would not speak to him again.

At that moment, he thought that he had heard wrongly, but he was sure that he had not heard Xiao Bao’s voice wrongly.

There was a glint in his eyes as he looked at Xiao Bao, who was in Lu Zhu’s arms. Xiao Bao’s face was red from crying, and his tears were still on his face. His eyes were filled with grievance, fear, and a little anger.

Xiao Bao met Chang Feng’s eyes. He was really afraid that Uncle Chang Feng would leave this time and he might never see him again.

Xiao Bao sobbed and reached out to Chang Feng. He said in a childish voice, “Hug.”

He wheedled domineeringly.

Lu Zhu looked at Xiao Bao in her arms and a trace of surprise flashed across his eyes.

During the time Xiao Bao was in the Lu family, he usually played with Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. He would even do the horse stance every day. He had always felt that Xiao Bao was an independent child. When he was at home, he had never taken the initiative to ask for a hug.

Before Lu Zhu could come back to his senses, Xiao Bao, who was in his arms, disappeared.

Xiao Bao hugged Chang Feng’s neck tightly and buried his head beside Chang Feng’s neck. He cried until his body trembled.

Even though Xiao Bao was out of breath from crying, he did not forget to mutter, “Uncle Chang Feng, you can’t lie to me anymore in the future. Otherwise, I’ll be angry. You have to always be by my side. Even if you go out, you have to tell me.”

Chang Feng stroked Xiao Bao’s back with heartache and helped him calm down.

Xiao Bao sobbed a few times and continued, “I won’t be naughty anymore. I’ll listen to you and Daddy. You’re not allowed to abandon me in the future!”

Chang Feng lowered his head slightly. Smelling the milky fragrance on Xiao Bao, his heart softened. “Xiao Bao, we never thought of not wanting you.”

“I’ve been waiting for you for so long, but you never came. You’re here this time, but you still didn’t want to see me!” The more Xiao Bao spoke, the sadder he became.

Chang Feng’s eyes were also a little red. He gently pressed his forehead against Xiao Bao’s forehead. He could clearly see the tears on Xiao Bao’s eyelashes and his heart ached. “Okay, I’ll always be with you in the future.”

Xiao Bao looked up as he cried. He looked at Chang Feng in front of him and sniffed. “Alright, pinky promise!”

With that, Xiao Bao pulled Chang Feng’s other arm.

Chang Feng naturally stretched out his pinky and pinky promise Xiao Bao.

They used to make agreements like that.

Xiao Bao was satisfied now. He stopped crying and smiled brightly at Chang Feng.

Chang Feng was infected by Xiao Bao’s emotions. There was a smile in his eyes as he gently helped Xiao Bao wipe the tears off his face.
