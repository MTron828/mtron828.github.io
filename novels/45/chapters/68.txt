Chapter 69: Confession

Qiao Nian performed acupuncture on Gu Zhou once more. After she put the needles away, she heard a knock on the door.

The butler’s voice came from outside the door. “Second Young Master, Second Young Madam, Miss Qiao has arrived.”

“Got it,” Gu Zhou replied impassively.

After dismissing the butler, Gu Zhou turned to see Qiao Nian packing up the silver needles with her head lowered. He said with a serious expression, “Every time you help me perform acupuncture, I feel much better. When will I be able to fully recover from my illness?”

After Qiao Nian finished packing up her silver needles, she looked up at Gu Zhou and smiled. She said, “Second Young Master Gu, you’re too impatient. Treating illnesses takes a long time.”

“Let’s head out first.” Gu Zhou put his arm around Qiao Nian’s waist and smiled at her.

When Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou went downstairs, they saw Qiao Xin sitting on the sofa, tapping on her phone.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up in a cold smile. She was curious about what brazen things Qiao Xin would do tonight.

Every time, she would shoot down Qiao Xin, often humiliating her in public. Yet, with the way Qiao Xin acted, it was almost as if Qiao Xin herself wanted to be embarrassed. Qiao Nian didn’t understand it at all.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou sat side by side, their gazes landing on the pendant on the coffee table.

Under the gentle lighting, the color of the pendant was distinctive and clear. One could tell with a single glance that it was not an ordinary pendant.

Seeing that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had come down, Qiao Xin looked at them happily. In an excited manner, she asked, “Sister, Brother-in-law, will we really be able to find the owner of the pendant today?”

Qiao Nian didn’t reply.

Qiao Xin continued, “If only we could find him. Then we could find the person who ruined your innocence.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She didn’t expect Qiao Xin to say something like that.

The atmosphere in the room grew more and more tense. Qiao Xin didn’t seem to sense it at all. She continued, “Brother-in-law, I know it’s my fault for only telling you the truth now. I just thought that since the two of you are now husband and wife, there shouldn’t be any overnight enmity between you two. You would empathize with Sister, wouldn’t you?”

When Qiao Xin had entered the room, she had seen a man with white hair sitting in the next room. She had heard from the servants that this man was the owner of the pendant.

Therefore, she planned to tell Gu Zhou directly that the pendant belonged to Qiao Nian. Firstly, Gu Zhou would definitely no longer be willing to be with Qiao Nian. Secondly, Qiao Nian would soon be forced to be with that old man.

Two birds would be killed with one stone.

As Qiao Xin thought about this, her lips curved up involuntarily. She might be able to marry Gu Zhou in the future.

Qiao Nian didn’t expect Qiao Xin to disclose what had happened in the past. She said in astonishment, “You…”

“Sister.” Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian and said meaningfully, “Husband and wife should be honest with each other. I know you don’t dare to say it. This time, I’ll tell Brother-in-law for you. I believe Brother-in-law will definitely forgive you.”

As Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian’s panicked expression, her lips began to curve up slightly. She said smugly, “Brother-in-law, you’ll forgive Sister, right?”

At this moment, the butler led a young and handsome man with gold-rimmed glasses into the room.

The man’s good looks were on par with Gu Zhou’s. He had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes. He had a tall and broad figure, and was practically a dragon among men.

“Lu Zhu, the owner of the pendant,” Gu Zhou said impassively.

Qiao Xin’s eyes widened. In disbelief, she stared at the man named Lu Zhu, biting her lip.

She had clearly heard from the butler that the man with the white hair was the owner of the pendant.

Lu Zhu. He was an incredibly well-known celebrity, and the direct heir to the Lu family, a rich family from the upper class.

Lu Zhu’s fans often encouraged Lu Zhu to do well in his acting career. If he did not do well, he could only return home to inherit the family business.

There were countless women who wanted to marry Lu Zhu. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She herself was also a fan of Lu Zhu.

At the thought, Qiao Xin’s frown grew deeper.

Qiao Xin’s eyes grew red. She glared at Qiao Nian in a rage..
