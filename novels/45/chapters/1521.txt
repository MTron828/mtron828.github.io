However, she was still a little puzzled. Under normal circumstances, children would inherit their parents’ looks, but Lina didn’t look like Shen Mei at all.

Lina thought about it seriously. Someone had said that she looked a little like her mother’s back view. “In the past, when someone took photos of Mom and me, many people couldn’t tell the two of us apart.”

Qiao Nian smiled, her narrowed eyes hiding the cunningness in them.

The President had already sent Madam President to her room and was walking out in a hurry.

When the president saw Qiao Nian, he said, “Mark is here. I’ll deal with him first. Wait for me to return.”

“Yeah.” Qiao Nian nodded.

About an hour later, the president came in from outside. He finally managed to chase Mark away, but Mark said harsh words and asked him to let Annie go within three days.

The president’s expression was very dark, but when he saw Qiao Nian, he still smiled gently and said, “Miss Qiao, let’s treat Madam now.”

Qiao Nian had already prescribed a prescription for Madam President to recuperate. Just as she was about to speak, Gu Zhou and Chen Qing walked over from afar.

There was a bowl on the tray in Chen Qing’s hand. He looked at Qiao Nian and said respectfully, “Second Young Madam, everything is ready.”

Qiao Nian lifted the lid of the bowl. There was a light blue sticky liquid in the bowl, and it emitted a pleasant fragrance.

The people standing beside Qiao Nian could all smell the fragrance. All of them felt that their minds were much clearer, and their eyes were much clearer.

Qiao Nian smiled at Chen Qing and covered the bowl again. “It’s been hard on you.”

Qiao Nian looked at the president and said, “Mr. President, let Madam drink this bowl of Chinese medicine first!”

“Thank you.” With just a sniff, the president knew that this bowl was something good. He personally took the tray from Chen Qing. “Miss Qiao, when will you start the treatment?”

There was a hint of a smile in Qiao Nian’s eyes as she said, “President, in Madam President’s current condition, she can’t take medicine casually. This medicine is only elementary to nourish her body. When you’ve prepared Madam President’s past medical files, I’ll officially treat her. We have other things to do, so we’ll take our leave first.”

The president looked at the tray in his hand. Was this bowl of medicine just a beginner’s tonic?

Just by smelling the medicinal fragrance, he felt comfortable.

If it was a high-level tonic, wouldn’t Shen Mei recover faster?

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, she took her arm worriedly and said, “Nian Nian, are you going back now? It’s too dangerous outside. Why don’t you stay in the palace?”

Lina was really worried that Earl Mark would attack Qiao Nian. Although the Gu family’s strength couldn’t be underestimated, there was a saying in Country Z that a strong dragon couldn’t suppress a local snake.

Qiao Nian smiled and held Lina’s hand. She knew that Lina was really worried about her. She smiled and said, “It’s fine. They won’t attack us for the time being.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Chen Qing nodded politely at the president and Lina before escorting Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian warily.

Lina’s gaze fell on Chen Qing’s back. In her mind, she thought of how Chen Qing stood in front of her and grabbed the stone Annie had thrown at him. Her heart skipped a beat.

The president turned around and walked towards Shen Mei’s room. Seeing Shen Mei sitting at the table reading, he smiled and placed the medicine in his hand in front of her. “This is a tonic specially made for you.”

Shen Mei frowned slightly. She didn’t like to take medicine.

The President lifted the lid of the bowl, and a strange fragrance filled the room.

Shen Mei’s eyes flickered. She looked up at the president and said softly, “It smells so good.”

“Yes, it smells good.” The president looked at Shen Mei gently and said softly, “Drink it quickly!”
