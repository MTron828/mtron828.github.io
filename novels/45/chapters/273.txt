Chapter 274: Scheming B*tch

Xia Xue smiled slightly at all her classmates and said humbly, “Thank you for your affirmation of me, everyone. Mr. Dong Hua chose me, and I will definitely study twice as hard to not embarrass him. Every one of us will meet our own Bo Le [1. A historical figure known for his good judgment of horses]. Every one of us is our own protagonist, so we don’t have to envy anyone else. We just have to work hard ourselves!”

In the piano room, Wang Xuan frowned when she heard Xia Xue’s hypocritical voice. She whispered with disdain, “Why do I feel that she’s giving an award speech? Is there something wrong with her brain? If she didn’t take your place, would she be where she is now? She’s simply shameless!”

Qiao Nian smiled gently and said, “Indeed!”

The people outside were still talking at once.

“Senior Xia Xue, since Mr. Dong Hua came to our school to practice with you, why don’t you invite him out so that we can meet him in person?”

“Yes, yes. Senior Xia Xue, hurry up and invite Mr. Dong Hua out. We want to hear a few words from him.”

“Senior Xia Xue, I’m begging you!”

…

When Xia Xue heard her classmates’ words, she looked troubled. Now, she just wanted to perform well in front of Mr. Dong Hua, so she explained, “Students, I’m really sorry. I can’t go against Mr. Dong Hua’s wishes. Mr. Dong Hua has always kept a low profile. He doesn’t want to appear in public. If I invite Mr. Dong Hua out, won’t it go against his original intentions?”

Seeing that her classmates had stopped talking, Xia Xue continued, “If everyone really likes Mr. Dong Huang, then please pay more attention to his works. The music of the concert will also be made into an album. Please purchase and collect it. This is the greatest support for Mr. Dong Hua.”

Qiao Nian stood in the piano room, listening to Xia Xue’s righteous speech. Her lips curved into a cold smile.

If Xia Xue hadn’t replaced her, and if she were really Mr. Dong Hua, she would definitely think that Xia Xue was an obedient and sensible girl. However, there were no ifs in this world.

Qiao Nian placed the violin into the case and walked towards the door with Wang Xuan.

When the people outside heard footsteps approaching, they held their breaths nervously and stared unblinkingly at the door of the piano room, waiting quietly for Mr. Dong Hua to appear.

Qiao Nian opened the door to the piano room. Under the watchful gazes of her classmates, she walked out with the violin on her back.

Wang Xuan followed closely behind Qiao Nian.

When everyone saw Qiao Nian, they were all stunned. Confusion was written all over their faces.

Qiao Nian received everyone’s gaze and looked puzzled.

At this moment, Gao Lin was completely stunned. She had never expected Qiao Nian to walk out of the room.

What was going on?

How could the person in the piano room be Qiao Nian?

Hadn’t Qiao Nian already returned home? Why was she in the piano room?

Gao Lin clenched her fists tightly, glaring at Qiao Nian.

Xia Xue sensed that something was wrong with Gao Lin. She turned to look at Gao Lin and realized that Gao Lin seemed to know that girl.

Gao Lin recalled that Sister Xia Xue had once reminded her not to let Qiao Nian enter this music training room. She thought that Qiao Nian had returned home, so she didn’t pay Qiao Nian any attention!

Whatever she feared would happen. Qiao Nian had actually come to this music training room! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Gao Lin secretly blamed herself. She remembered now. Qiao Nian must have heard from her that Sister Xia Xue had met Brother Cao here. Qiao Nian ran over to pretend to meet Brother Cao by chance, and wanted the opportunity to snatch Sister Xia Xue’s position!

She was simply a scheming b*tch!

With this thought in mind, Gao Lin took a step forward and questioned coldly, “Qiao Nian, what are you doing here?”
