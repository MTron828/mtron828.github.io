Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Sugar.”

Lu Zhu’s voice suddenly rang out, interrupting Qiao Nian’s thoughts. Like a spring breeze, it warmed Qiao Nian’s heart and reduced her uneasiness.

Qiao Nian felt much more at ease. She smiled at Lu Zhu, her eyes filled with joy. She followed Lu Zhu into the office.

Lu Zhu told Qiao Nian to sit down to talk. Seeing how uneasy Qiao Nian looked, he couldn’t help but worry. “Are you asking Gu Qing about Gu Zhou’s illness?”

Previously, he had also discovered that Gu Zhou was a little mentally ill. At that time, he had recommended Gu Qing to Gu Zhou.Gu Zhou insisted that he was not ill, so he no longer insisted.

“No.” Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said honestly, “He’s a child of Gu Zhou’s friend. He seems to have autism, so I came to consult her.”

Gu Zhou’s friend?

Lu Zhu’s expression turned serious. Logically speaking, he should know all of Gu Zhou’s friends. The children of his friends all looked lively and cheerful, and did not seem to be autistic.

“What’s his friend’s name?” Lu Zhu asked.

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and continued, “He didn’t say anything about that. I just told Doctor Gu about the child’s condition, but Doctor Gu said that the child might not be autistic. He might just be pretending to be autistic in order to seek attention.”

At this point, Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She pursed her lips and said, “But I don’t think that child is like Doctor Gu said.”

Qiao Nian didn’t think too much about who Gu Qi’s biological father was. A man who could only lie unconscious in a hospital bed was indeed unable to take good care of his child.

Moreover, Gu Zhou had not specifically mentioned this matter.

It made sense. If Gu Zhou told her who Gu Qi’s biological father was, she would definitely reprimand him. In the end, she had to think of a way to take good care of Gu Qi.

After all, in her opinion, Gu Qi’s health was the most important.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he didn’t think too much about it. Instead, he said, “Don’t worry, there will definitely be a way.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian pursed her lips. Although she said that, she couldn’t help but worry about Gu Qi.

At this moment, Lu Zhu’s phone rang.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was still frowning, Lu Zhu pursed his lips and took out his phone. Seeing that it was an unknown number, he picked up the call and placed the phone to his ear. “Hello.”

“Is this Mr. Lu?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“And you are?”

The woman’s voice was very gentle and polite. “Hello, Mr. Lu. I’m Gu Qing’s junior, Su Sheng. May I know if Miss Qiao is by your side?”

Su Sheng?

Lu Zhu had heard this name from Gu Qing before. Su Sheng was Gu Qing’s junior sister and was outstanding.

“She’s here. I’ll put her on the phone now.” Lu Zhu handed the phone to Qiao Nian. Covering the receiver with his hand, he said softly, “Gu Qing’s junior, Su Sheng.”

Qiao Nian took the phone and greeted, “Hello, Miss Su.”

“Miss Qiao, I’m Gu Qing’s junior. She just called and asked me to look for you. She asked me to follow you to meet your friend’s child. Is this a good time?”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. Her gloomy mood instantly lightened. She had been worried about Gu Qi. Now that a professional will take a look at his illness, she should be able to confirm his condition.

“Yes.” When Qiao Nian said this, her voice sounded much more relaxed.

“Alright, where can I find you now?”

“Yongan Building.”

“Alright, Miss Qiao. Is it convenient for you to leave your phone number? I’ll be there in a while and I can contact you.”

“Alright, thank you,” Qiao Nian said politely.

Qiao Nian hung up and took out her phone to send a message to Su Sheng. After sending the message, she smiled and handed the phone to Lu Zhu.

“I’ve been thinking of finding a suitable time to let Lu Nian and Lu Rao meet you.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes sparkled as she nodded vigorously. She really looked forward to meeting her brothers.

She and Second Brother had already acknowledged each other as siblings. At that time, she still didn’t know about her relationship with Second Brother. She just didn’t know if Second Brother would feel surprised if he knew about their relationship.
