Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Her gaze fell on the man’s face as she enunciated each word clearly. “I told you, I’m not willing.”

The man instantly looked troubled. Then, he looked at Qiao Nian pitifully and said humbly, “Miss Qiao, if you don’t go, I’m afraid I’ll lose my arm. Please.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

With Jiang Chi’s stubborn temper, it was probably really possible for him to dislocate that man’s shoulders.

Qiao Nian nodded in the end and followed the man towards the door.

There was a black Maybach parked outside the door. The man opened the back seat door in a gentlemanly manner, and Qiao Nian walked in.

After getting into the car, she looked down at her cell phone and sent Qin Chuan a message.

“Old Qin, I’ve already seen Eldest Senior Brother.”

After Qiao Nian sent the message, she looked out of the window in disappointment.

She had just met Eldest Senior Brother, but she had no choice but to leave him. This feeling was really uncomfortable.

Qin Chuan replied very quickly. “Where are you?”

Qiao Nian lowered her head and replied, “In MY.”

Qin Chuan said, “That’s great! I’ll go over now!”

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Chuan’s message. She could sense his joy in his words.

However, when she saw the second half of the sentence, the smile in her eyes gradually disappeared. She told Qin Chuan in detail about Eldest Senior Brother’s current situation and even told him that her grandfather was not with Eldest Senior Brother.

Qin Chuan sent two sad emojis, then a paragraph of text.

“I’ll go to MY now. Don’t worry, I won’t disturb Eldest Senior Brother. I’ll think of other ways to help him. I won’t let those people notice.”

Qiao Nian typed, “You have to be secretive. If that old man finds out, things will be troublesome. Eldest Senior Brother might even be in danger.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll definitely be careful. I won’t let Eldest Senior Brother fall into danger.”

“Okay!”

After Qiao Nian sent the message, she sighed slightly. She had only wanted to investigate what had happened more than twenty years ago, but she hadn’t expected to discover something else during the investigation.

“By the way, have you asked Eldest Senior Brother about your child? When you gave birth, Eldest Senior Brother instructed me to help you change the memories of your pregnancy and childbirth. Do you think he knows the whereabouts of your child?

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Chuan’s message and fell into deep thought.

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up, and her heart began to race. “The next time I see Eldest Senior Brother, I’ll ask him.”

“Now that we have news of Eldest Senior Brother, we might have news of Grandpa soon. At that time, our family can be reunited!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes softened. She didn’t know when their family would meet again!

In her memories before she turned eighteen, she, her grandfather, Qin Chuan, and Eldest Senior Brother were a real family.

When she turned eighteen, their family was broken up!

Now that they had Eldest Senior Brother’s whereabouts, as long as they found their grandfather, this family would be complete.

Qiao Nian sent a happy emoji. “Our family will definitely be reunited!”

She turned off her phone and turned to look at the scenery outside the window. Her eyes were filled with hope. The future was filled with endless hope.

From time to time, the driver would look into the rearview mirror, as if observing Qiao Nian’s current state. Seeing that Qiao Nian was staring out of the window, he pursed his lips and remained silent.

His palms were covered in cold sweat. He stepped on the accelerator and the car accelerated.

He only hoped that he could bring Qiao Nian over as soon as possible and successfully complete the mission.

Sunlight shone on the surface of the sea. The surface of the sea was sparkling. From afar, it looked beautiful.

There was a villa not far from the sea. Mr. Chen was sitting on a recliner with his eyes closed.

Chang Feng walked in from outside the courtyard. He walked towards Mr. Chen and called out in a low voice, “Sir.”

Mr. Chen opened his eyes and looked at Chang Feng. “Did you see her?”

Chang Feng nodded.
