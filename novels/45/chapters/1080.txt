1081 Making Things Clear

Qiao Xin got up from the ground in a sorry state. Her leg was still injured, so she could only support herself against a big tree.

She coughed twice and looked at Gu Zhou mockingly. “I didn’t expect Second Young Master Gu to be so infatuated. He’s even willing to take in such a dirty woman! I’m curious about what Qiao Nian gave you to make you so tolerant of her!”

Adult love was a combination of benefits. How could there be true love?

In the past, Qiao Xin had always wanted to marry someone rich and powerful. That way, the Qiao family would rise to a higher level. If she could be loving with her future husband, that would be even better!

In the past, Qiao Xin had completely looked down on lowly men like beggars and hooligans. But ever since the incident at the Earth Temple, she had changed her mind. It turned out that some men only needed to rely on their own abilities to attract women!

What Qiao Xin didn’t understand was that to men, women were usually all the same when the lights were turned off. Why was Gu Zhou so tolerant of Qiao Nian?

“Just because she’s Qiao Nian and she’s my wife. I was also the one she slept with six years ago!” Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes, his voice as cold as ice.

When Qiao Yu heard Gu Zhou’s words, he was stunned. He looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian in disbelief!

The man from six years ago was actually Gu Zhou?

Qiao Yu’s heart was empty. If it weren’t for that incident six years ago, he and Qiao Nian might have been together!

Qiao Xin’s mouth fell open in shock. She stood rooted to the ground like a statue.

How was that possible? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Xin remembered very clearly that she had arranged for an old man for Qiao Nian back then. That old man had even told her that the mission was completed and that she had specially given the old man the balance.

However, Gu Zhou had been very serious when he said that just now. He didn’t look like he was lying at all!

No, that was absolutely impossible!

How could Qiao Nian be so lucky?

Qiao Nian must have lied to Gu Zhou!

That was right!

Qiao Nian must have lied!

He didn’t know that he had been deceived by Qiao Nian!

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin said, “Gu Zhou, you’ve been tricked!”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Qiao Xin continued, “I know Qiao Nian very well. Qiao Nian is the best at lying. You think Qiao Nian treats you sincerely, but you’re wrong. She’s coveting the glory and wealth of the Gu family. That’s why she brainwashed you and said that you were the one who was with her six years ago!”

The more Qiao Xin thought about it, the more she felt that she was right. She looked at Qiao Nian with disdain and said, “Qiao Nian, am I right?”

“I can only say that your imagination is very rich!” Qiao Nian said lightly. “You don’t have to believe this, because whether you believe it or not won’t change the truth!”

Qiao Xin’s face instantly turned pale. She swallowed and shook her head, muttering to herself, “No, don’t try to lie to me. I won’t believe your nonsense!”

“We don’t intend for you to believe us either. However, you only need to know one thing. You’re about to lose your freedom!” Qiao Nian smiled.

Lose her freedom?

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, she frowned. She had a bad feeling about this. “What do you mean by losing my freedom?”

“Literally,” Qiao Nian said nonchalantly, shrugging slightly.

“Explain yourself!”

“Don’t worry, you’ll find out soon enough!” Gu Zhou’s voice grew colder.

How could Gu Zhou let Qiao Xin off the hook? Qiao Xin had tried to kill Qiao Nian for her own selfish reasons. A vicious person like Qiao Xin should be punished by the law!

“Qiao Nian, tell me clearly what you’ve done!” Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in fear, refusing to give up!

Qiao Nian thought for a moment and said, “Actually, we didn’t do anything. It’s just that He Cheng told us everything that happened. You should understand the rest, right?”

Qiao Xin’s face was as pale as a sheet of paper. She had a bad feeling about this. Frowning, she looked at Qiao Yu for help and said, “Brother, you have to help me. The two of them bullied me!”
