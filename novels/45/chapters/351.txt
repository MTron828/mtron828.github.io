Chapter 352: Apologizing

Qiao Nian had initially thought that since this was her own event, she didn’t want to blow things up.

However, so what if she made a scene? Someone actually called Mr. Dong Hua a gigolo in front of her.

She could not tolerate this.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s gaze grew colder and colder. “Qin Lu, I advise you to behave yourself. If you want to attend this banquet smoothly, you’d better shut your filthy mouth. If I can make you lose your job, I can naturally make you disappear from An City!”

Qiao Nian didn’t ask Qin Lu to get lost because she wanted to give the Qin family some face.

Qin Lu’s aunt, Qin Dong, was an antique dealer and a famous figure in the circle.

Qin Dong had also prepared many treasures for this auction.

If Qin Lu didn’t know when to stop, then don’t blame her for being impolite. After all, without Qin Dong’s treasures, this charity auction would still be held!

Qin Lu flew into a rage out of humiliation. In school, no one knew that she had been beaten up, but here, everyone had seen her being beaten up. This was too embarrassing!

The more Qin Lu thought about it, the angrier she became. She couldn’t take this lying down.

Qin Lu raised her hand to hit her back.

An angry female voice rang out.

Qin Lu was slightly stunned. Reluctantly, she retracted her hand.

Lu Nian’s clenched fists relaxed.

Qiao Nian turned her head and saw Qin Dong and Li Kun walking over.

Li Kun was Qin Dong’s son.

Standing beside Li Kun was Jiang Yue.

The person who had called Qin Lu’s name was Qin Dong.

Li Kun had recently taken over the family business. His career was thriving, and he had been in the limelight recently.

Compared to before, Li Kun was now more composed.

Qin Lu walked up to Qin Dong aggrievedly and complained, “Auntie, she was clearly the one who spoke rudely to me. She’s arrogant and conceited. I just wanted to teach her a lesson!”

“Haven’t you caused enough trouble recently?” Qin Dong looked at Qin Lu coldly.

When Qin Lu heard Qin Dong’s words, she instantly felt wronged. She didn’t understand why Auntie was helping outsiders bully her.

At the thought that she had lost all her face, Qin Lu’s tears of grievance fell. “But…”

“If you dare to say another word, get lost!” Qin Dong said coldly.

Qin Lu had no choice but to lower her head.

At this moment, Li Kun walked up to Qiao Nian. His eyes sparkled as he said, “Miss Qiao, I’m really sorry. Qin Lu offended you just now. I apologize on his behalf. I’ll definitely teach her a lesson later!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Li Kun’s face. She suddenly recalled that Li Kun had once helped her argue with a blind date. She wanted to give Li Kun some face. Smiling, she said, “Mr. Li, you don’t have to say anything. Actually, I attacked just now too!”

“Let’s go!” Qin Dong urged.

When Qin Dong and the others left, Jiang Yue and Qiao Nian looked at each other and followed.

Qiao Nian could still hear Qin Dong and Li Kun talking.

“Who’s that girl? I think you’re a little interested in her.”

“A friend.”

After that, Qin Dong began to educate Qin Lu.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze, took Lu Nian’s arm, and walked in.

This time, she was still stopped.

Qiao Nian’s patience instantly vanished. She narrowed her eyes slightly, her entire body exuding a cold aura. “Wang Hua, right? If you have a brain today, then let us in. Otherwise, don’t blame me for ruining your bright future!”

Wang Hua was angered by Qiao Nian’s arrogant attitude.

He had never expected someone who didn’t even have an invitation to be so arrogant.

Although he didn’t know why Li Kun wanted to help Qiao Nian, as part of the organizing team, he absolutely couldn’t let arrogant, domineering and troublesome people in. He couldn’t afford it if she caused trouble inside.

“I’ll say it again. Please show me your invitation!” Not to be outdone, Wang Hua glared at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked at Wang Hua indifferently, a trace of anger flashing in her eyes. It seemed that Wang Hua was deliberately making things difficult for her!
