1191 You are not allowed to look at others!

“Nian’er, you don’t even dare to look at me anymore.”

Thank you readers!

Gu Zhou’s voice sounded even more aggrieved, and his eyes looked even more plaintive.

Qiao Nian looked back and was caught off guard. She met Gu Zhou’s eyes and looked at his aggrieved expression. “I didn’t. I was just thinking…”

“You’re not allowed to look at others!” Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian domineeringly and added, “You have to keep looking at me today.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou worriedly and found an excuse. “I was just wondering if we had brought cold medicine. Also, it’s just the two of us now. How can I look at the others?”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Qiao Nian smiled gently and gently kissed him on the lips. Only then did she retract her gaze and say with a smile, “No one looks better than you!”

Only then did Gu Zhou begin to fill the bathtub with water in satisfaction.

The warm water soaked their clothes. Seeing that Gu Zhou had yet to leave, Qiao Nian said uncomfortably, “I’ll take a shower myself. You can leave first!”

“Nian’er, we’ve already agreed.” Gu Zhou placed his hand on Qiao Nian’s shoulder, refusing to let her leave. “I’ll help you take a shower.”

For some reason, Qiao Nian felt a little nervous. Her heart couldn’t help but race. Although she was very shy, she was looking forward to Gu Zhou’s next actions.

Gu Zhou filled the bathtub with water and stepped into it. Seeing that Qiao Nian’s head was lowered, he reached out to unbutton her clothes without saying anything.

The temperature in the bathroom grew higher and higher, and Qiao Nian’s face grew redder and redder. Although she had already done those things with Gu Zhou, she was still very nervous at this moment.

“Nian’er.” Seeing Qiao Nian’s shy expression, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but swallow. He moved closer to her and kissed her without hesitation.

Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes. Although it had only been two or three days since she had slept with Gu Zhou, she felt as if a long time had passed. All the strength in her body seemed to have been drained by him.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to suffocate, Gu Zhou finally let go of her. He looked at Qiao Nian’s flushed face and said in a hoarse and dazed voice, “Nian’er, after we find out the truth, we’ll hold another grand wedding and let the entire world know that you’re married to me. I’m your husband, and you’re my wife!”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly. “Okay.”

“We’ll go on our honeymoon then.”

When Qiao Nian heard about the “honeymoon”, her heart was filled with anticipation.

“When the time comes, I’ll bring you around the world. Everywhere we go, we’ll take a set of wedding photos and leave our traces,” Gu Zhou said.

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up, and her lips curved up involuntarily. “This idea is great!”

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s face was as red as a cooked prawn.

When did this man learn to flirt so well?

Qiao Nian subconsciously wanted to escape, but Gu Zhou’s grip was too strong, not allowing her to.

“Those men are all staring at you. I really want to dig out their eyes.” Gu Zhou’s voice became even more domineering.

Qiao Nian was speechless. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gu Zhou frowned, his expression cold and charming. His thin lips parted slightly. “I want to dig out Jiang Chi’s eyes the most. I don’t like him looking at you.”

Qiao Nian’s face turned slightly red. Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, her heart couldn’t help but race.

Oh no, she had almost forgotten that Gu Zhou was a paranoid person. Clearly, Gu Zhou already hated Jiang Chi.

“Nian’er, why don’t we stay in the room for the rest of our lives? That way, I can keep an eye on you, and no one will see you.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he had a faint smile on his face. His hand caressed Qiao Nian’s cheek. “I finally understand the saying ‘From now on, the king won’t attend morning court’. Nian’er, you’re the little vixen who made me unwilling to leave.”

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. Gu Zhou looked very strange now. She didn’t even know how to respond to him.
