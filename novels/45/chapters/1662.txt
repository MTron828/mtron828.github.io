Chapter 1663 Persevere

At this moment, Qiao Nian, who was the makeup artist, also received Gu Zhou's message. Her eyes flickered as she turned to look at Lina, who was sitting in the middle.

The light had gone out of Lina's eyes, as if her soul had been sucked out of her like a puppet on a string.

Qiao Nian walked up to Lina and squatted down. Her gaze fell on Lina's face and she called out softly, "Lina."

"Huh?" Lina looked up at Qiao Nian, her expression blank.

"It's about to begin. Now, it's your turn to show up." Qiao Nian held Lina's hand tightly and reminded her, "You have to perk up now. Things have already come to this point. There's no room for retreat."

When Lina heard Qiao Nian's words, her eyes gradually lit up.

She wasn't really married to Wright. She was just engaged to him. Today's engagement was just to give her father a chance to investigate Mark.

She couldn't fumble the ball at the critical moment. She had to work hard to do everything well.

Lina's eyes gradually hardened. She smiled at Qiao Nian and said, "Nian Nian, you're right. We still have a lot to do tonight. I have to persevere."

When Qiao Nian heard Lina's words, her heart ached. She said in a low voice, "Yes."

Lina stood up and looked at herself in the mirror. She said silently, "Good luck."

She and Qiao Nian walked towards the banquet hall.

When the two of them appeared in the banquet hall, the lights shone on them. Everyone fell silent. This was simply a visual feast.

Standing at the front was Princess Lina. She was wearing a white wedding dress. Her hair was tied up high, and the veil draped down her back. She looked like a holy fairy, making no one dare to blaspheme her.

Every step she took was very elegant and stable. She exuded an amazing aura.

Qiao Nian, who had been standing beside Lina, was wearing a purple gown. Her face was breathtakingly beautiful. Her fox-like eyes were sparkling and charming. However, her eyes were clear, and she gave off a righteous aura.

She was really charming and not ordinary.

What amazed everyone the most was that even though she had already restrained her dressing, she was still not inferior to the princess.

"Oh my god, I really didn't expect the Seventh Princess to be so beautiful!"

"As expected of a princess of Europe!"

"She used to be too low-profile. That's why no one saw her beauty."

"The bridesmaid is also so beautiful. I wonder who she is."

…

Everyone's attention was attracted by Lina and Qiao Nian. Everyone felt the same way about their beauty. It was hard for them to imagine that there were such beautiful people in this world. They were so beautiful that they didn't seem like ordinary people.

The entire banquet hall became even more magnificent because of their beauty.

Mark took an elegant sip of red wine and looked at Lina and Qiao Nian not far away with a burning gaze. He was extremely satisfied.

Wright was standing beside Mark. He had just seen Lina in the dressing room. He knew that Lina was beautiful, but under the spotlight, she seemed to be indescribably beautiful.

To have such a beautiful woman become his wife, especially since she had stunned so many guests, those people must be very envious of him.

After all, only he could marry Lina.

Mark turned to look at Wright, then his gaze fell on the president's face not far away. He said disdainfully, "Hurry up and pick up your wife. Everyone is still waiting to congratulate you at the wedding banquet." FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The president naturally noticed Mark's gaze, but he retracted his gaze and his gaze fell on Lina again.

He really wanted to be like other fathers and give his daughter his blessings by personally handing her over to the person she loved the most.

But he couldn't.

He had let her down. He couldn't give her the happiness she wanted. He could only let her make sacrifices for him.

At this moment, Wright had already walked up to Lina. He stared at her with a burning gaze, as if Lina was the only one left in the world.

Lina looked at Wright and wanted to throw up, but today was her engagement ceremony with Wright. She couldn't be rude, so she gave a polite and distant smile.
