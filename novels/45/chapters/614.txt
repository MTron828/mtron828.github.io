When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s question, she said with a serious expression, “People in our line of work are the best at reading people. I didn’t follow you in immediately just now because I realized that he had already begun pulling the blanket over his face when he saw me.”

“The way he avoids me, and the way he doesn’t want to see my eyes. He only relaxed after I left. This shows that he’s very afraid of interacting with strangers, and he’s unwilling to interact with strangers. Not only that, he’s also resistant to interacting with strangers.” Su Sheng thought of Gu Qi’s situation and frowned slightly.

Su Sheng stood rooted to the ground. Seeing that Qiao Nian had remained silent, she asked thoughtfully, “Don’t you believe my judgment?”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Sheng’s words, she sighed heavily and said, “Your judgment is different from your senior sister’s, but as someone close to Little Qi, I naturally hope that he’s not sick.”

When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked at her face. After a long while, she smiled and said, “I understand how you feel. No one wants the person they care about to fall ill. I’ll tell my senior sister everything I’ve seen later.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly and said gratefully, “Alright, thank you so much for this time.”

“I’m a doctor. This is my job. If Little Qi still needs treatment, you can look for me again. Of course, you can also be firm about your thoughts. Don’t be restrained by my words,” Su Sheng said considerately.

“It’s almost noon. Doctor Su, why don’t you stay for a meal?” Qiao Nian smiled at Su Sheng and said gently.

When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s words, her heart skipped a beat. She had heard that the Gu family’s chefs were all hired at a high price. The food here was even better than that of a five-star hotel.

She really wanted to stay for dinner, but when Su Sheng thought of Gu Zhou’s gaze, she said without hesitation, “There’s no need. I have to visit other patients in the afternoon.”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Then I won’t keep you any longer. Thank you so much for coming over.”

“Miss Qiao, you don’t have to be so polite. I’ll leave first!” Su Sheng said with a smile.

The two of them walked out. Qiao Nian sent Su Sheng to the entrance of the courtyard and watched as Su Sheng left. Then, she saw Chen Qing walk out. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Chen Qing looked around. There was no one else around. He said, “Second Young Madam.”

“Where are you going?” Qiao Nian asked in confusion.

“To supervise the construction site,” Chen Qing said uncomfortably.

To put it nicely, he was a supervisor.

To be honest, that was just sticking tiles.

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She didn’t expect Chen Qing to do such a thing. She smiled and said, “It’s like this. Help me buy a few herbs.”

Chen Qing hurriedly agreed.

Qiao Nian turned around and walked in. When she reached the living room of the villa, she saw Gu Zhou sitting on the sofa, his sharp gaze fixed on her face.

To be precise, it was the lips on her face.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips. The smell of blood instantly spread across her lips. She recalled how when he had pressed her down domineeringly, her blood had boiled uncontrollably. Her eyes flashed.

This man seriously bit her.

This was too much!

When Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s gaze, she didn’t dare to look him in the eye. Her gaze gradually shifted to the side.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s guilty expression and frowned.

“Are you afraid of me?” Gu Zhou went straight to the point.

“No, I was just thinking that I should let Chen Qing take care of you all the time. I shouldn’t have asked him to buy medicine for me. I was afraid that I would delay your work,” Qiao Nian said uncomfortably.

“Is that so?” Gu Zhou’s voice rose slightly. He clearly didn’t believe Qiao Nian’s words.

“Yeah.” Qiao Nian nodded.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was still staring at her, Qiao Nian thought that he had discovered something wrong with her. Just as she was about to say something, she heard Gu Zhou ask, “What conclusion did she reach?”
