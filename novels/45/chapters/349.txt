Chapter 350: Meeting Enemies on a Narrow Road

When the others heard Gu Zhou’s words, they instantly understood what was wrong.

It turned out that there was something wrong with the way Gu Zhou was looking at Qiao Nian. He didn’t look like a patient looking at a doctor at all. Instead, he looked like a man looking at a woman.

Could it be that this woman was seducing the Second Young Master of the Gu family? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

One had to know that the Second Young Master of the Gu family was not in good health. It was said that he would not live for long. Now that the Eldest Young Master of the Gu family had disappeared for so many years, logically speaking, after the Second Young Master of the Gu family died, all the assets of the Gu family would belong to the Second Young Madam of the Gu family.

With this thought in mind, these people began to stir.

The others looked at Gu Zhou with burning eyes. They had heard that Second Young Master Gu had married a mentally ill woman as his wife. However, this was only a rumor. They had not heard him admit it himself.

They were a little worried but this was a rumor.

With this thought in mind, some people began to plan.

At this moment, the person in charge of the banquet, Wang Hua, walked out and said politely, “Mr. Gu, please come in!”

Gu Zhou walked in and glanced at Qiao Nian casually, as if to say, “Hear that?”

Only strangers would call him that.

Gu Zhou walked in slowly.

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground, speechless.

Had her imagination run wild just now?

But she didn’t think so.

When Wang Hua saw Lu Nian and Qiao Nian, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. He had never seen these two people before. After some thought, he remembered that woman. She seemed to be his female musician at the concert.

How could an extra be qualified to be here?

With this thought in mind, Wang Hua cleared his throat and said, “Please show me your invitation.”

Invitation?

Qiao Nian frowned.

She really didn’t have one.

The theme of this charity event was that as long as one could take out something valuable, they could auction it at the banquet. Therefore, anyone could come.

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes, feeling a little uncomfortable.

How did Qin Chuan’s subordinates do things?

Was he that unreliable?

However, this was her place after all. Qiao Nian didn’t want to interfere. She turned to look at Lu Nian. “Where’s the invitation?”

Lu Nian also had the same expression. They looked at each other.

Lu Nian narrowed his phoenix-like eyes and looked at Assistant Cheng. “Didn’t you say that it’s fine as long as you have an item to auction?”

Wang Hua sneered and said angrily, “According to you, doesn’t that mean that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can get in?”

This was referring to them by name.

Lu Nian narrowed his phoenix-like eyes. His aura was cold, as if ice could freeze someone to death.

Wang Hua had a bad feeling about this. Indeed, he hadn’t heard what the two of them were saying to the Second Young Master of the Gu family just now. However, from the looks of it, they didn’t seem to be familiar with each other.

Moreover, how could a person without any background be qualified to argue with him? He was simply courting death.

Just as Wang Hua was about to reprimand her, a slender figure appeared at the side. She waved the invitation in her hand as if she was showing off. She deliberately walked past Qiao Nian and handed it to Wang Hua.

“Miss Qin, please come in.” Wang Hua looked at Qin Lu ingratiatingly, his eyes smiling until they were only slits.

“Mr. Wang, long time no see.”

The girl’s gentle voice rang out from the side.

Qiao Nian felt that this voice was a little familiar. She turned her head and saw Qin Lu wearing a pink gown. There were even dimples on her face. She looked like an innocent little princess.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned slightly cold.

It was indeed a coincidence. Enemies were bound to meet on a narrow road.

She didn’t expect to see Qin Lu here.

Qin Lu’s gaze fell on the face of the man beside Qiao Nian. Her eyes lit up.

What a beautiful man!
