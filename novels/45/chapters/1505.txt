1506 Madness

Madam President looked at Qiao Nian and tried hard to put on a smile. She nodded.

“Hello.” Qiao Nian gave a polite smile and took a few steps forward. When she reached Madam President, she extended her hand. “This is the first time we’ve met. I hope we get along well.”

The closer she was to Madam President, the more she felt that she was good-looking.

Madam President’s beautiful almond-shaped eyes were clear, as if she could see through her heart at a glance.

Her nose bridge was small and slightly raised, and her lips were beautiful and suitable for kissing.

When Madam President was awake, she gave off the impression of an ignorant child.

Madam President’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s hand, then on her own. She stiffly raised her hand to shake Qiao Nian’s.

Qiao Nian realized that Madam President was walking normally, but her hands looked a little stiff. “Doctor.”

After shaking hands, Madam President naturally retracted her hand.

“Doctor Qiao is very outstanding and especially amazing. Let her take a look.” As the president spoke, he helped Madam to the bed and sat her down.

As for the two pots of Falling Autumn Grass that the president had just carried in, he had already placed them on the bedside table.

Madam President’s hand twitched again, and so did the corner of her mouth.

Qiao Nian sat on a stool by the bed and took Madam President’s pulse again. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Madam President stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian was taking her pulse, she turned to look at the president inch by inch, as if she didn’t understand what Qiao Nian was doing.

The President sat down beside Madam President and said in a low voice, “This is to take your pulse. It’s one of Doctor Qiao’s best treatment methods.”

Madam President looked enlightened.

“Stick out your tongue. Let me take a look at you.” Afraid that Madam President wouldn’t understand her, Qiao Nian demonstrated by sticking out her tongue. “Ah!”

Madam President mimicked Qiao Nian’s actions and stuck out her tongue. She even let out an “Ah” and stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

Seeing Madam President like this, Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Alright, you can close your mouth.”

Madam President retracted her tongue and sat there obediently.

Madam President’s tongue was also a little purple. Qiao Nian roughly understood Madam President’s current situation and frowned imperceptibly.

In order to confirm her judgment, Qiao Nian said, “Madam President, can you lie down? I’ll perform acupuncture on you.”

“Yes, only by performing acupuncture can I be 100% sure of my thoughts,” Qiao Nian said seriously. She met the president’s worried eyes. “The situation is special now.”

The president recalled how Qiao Nian had administered acupuncture to Lina that night. She had inserted many needles into Lina’s body, and Lina had vomited a few mouthfuls of blood. She had recovered completely.

“Okay.” The President nodded seriously. He looked at Madam Shen Mei and held her hand tightly. He coaxed softly, “Darling, lie down, okay?”

Qiao Nian had just taken out the silver needles from her bag. When Shen Mei saw the silver needles, her pupils trembled slightly, and she subconsciously took a step back.

When Shen Mei saw Qiao Nian approaching, she made a gurgling sound. In the end, she covered her ears with both hands and screamed, “Ah!”

The president frowned slightly. Seeing Shen Mei’s huge reaction, he immediately stepped forward and hugged her. He asked anxiously, “What’s wrong?”

However, Shen Mei didn’t seem to hear what the president was saying at all. She stared unblinkingly into the distance, her body trembling. She struggled with all her might, trying to escape the president’s embrace.

Seeing that Shen Mei had flared up again, the president’s expression darkened. He reached out and hugged Shen Mei tightly, saying anxiously, “Shen Mei, take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. Gradually, you’ll calm down. You’ll be fine. You’ll be fine.”

Shen Mei grabbed hard and tore at the president’s face, leaving a bloody scratch.
