1221 True Love

In the past, Boss Jin only knew how to live an unbridled life. He had countless women by his side, but those women were all after his money.

Even if he was sick, those women wouldn’t do anything else except cry.

Boss Jin was curious about the woman who had saved him. After he was discharged from the hospital, he found the woman who had saved him. In order to express his gratitude for saving his life, he invited that woman to dinner.

This was the first time Boss Jin had simply eaten with a woman. When the two of them chatted, he realized that their values were very similar, and their hobbies were the same. This made him feel as if he had found a soul mate.

As time passed, he fell in love with Jiang Yue uncontrollably.

As the two of them got closer and closer, Jiang Yue gradually opened her heart to him, telling him about her pitiful background and why her face was disfigured.

At that time, Boss Jin already liked Jiang Yue a lot, so he specially spent a lot of money to find a plastic surgeon to help Jiang Yue regain her looks.

Back then, when he had a heart attack at the airport, just by looking at half of Jiang Yue’s face, he felt that she was as beautiful as an angel. When Jiang Yue’s injuries were completely healed, he was shocked.

There was actually such a beautiful person in this world!

Jiang Yue was not only his private doctor, but also the person he loved the most!

Since he knew that Qiao Nian was the person who had ruined Jiang Yue’s face, how could he let Qiao Nian off?

Boss Jin didn’t want to tell Jiang Yue about these dark things. He only hoped that Jiang Yue would always be a beautiful and innocent goddess.

Boss Jin hugged Jiang Yue tightly and said softly, “Be good. After we return to Nancheng, I’ll get a divorce first, then we’ll get married!”

Jiang Yue obediently stayed in Boss Jin’s arms. She wrapped her arms around Boss Jin’s waist and replied obediently, “Okay.”

Jiang Yue’s slightly lowered eyes were filled with schemes.

Although she would never be able to marry Gu Zhou in her life, it seemed to be a good thing to marry Boss Jin and be Mrs. Jin.

Boss Jin’s strength was not inferior to the Gu family’s. Boss Jin was not young anymore. He would definitely pass away before her in the future.

At that time, she would be above everyone else. Everyone else would have to submit to her.

As for Qiao Nian, she was getting old. How could she compare to the young and beautiful her?

When that happened, she would never let the Gu and Lu families off. She wanted to destroy those who had bullied her one by one. She wanted those people to kneel at her feet and beg for mercy!!!

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue’s shy gaze and smiled. He moved closer to Jiang Yue’s face and bit her lightly. “Be good. Hubby will dote on you.”

Jiang Yue grew even shyer. Her face was flushed red, and she covered her face with her hand.

Boss Jin became even more excited. He had been with Jiang Yue for so long. Every time they made love, she would always look so shy. He couldn’t stop himself.

Old Master Jin turned around and pressed Jiang Yue onto the sofa. He took the silk rope from the side and raised her hand above her head. He tied it up and said excitedly, “Yue’er, let’s do something more exciting.”

Jiang Yue was very afraid, but she still looked shy. She lowered her gaze and called out gently, “Hubby~”

Her voice was soft, and Boss Jin’s bones went limp. He stared at Jiang Yue like a wolf staring at meat.

The next morning, Gu Zhou still asked Jiang Chi for the number of Mr. Chen’s assistant.

Gu Zhou thought that even if he couldn’t acknowledge his brother, it was good to say a few more words.

He wanted to use a collaboration with Mr. Chen to communicate more with him.

The call went through immediately.

“Hello, who are you looking for?”

The male voice on the other end of the line sounded a little familiar. Gu Zhou couldn’t remember where he had heard it before.

At this moment, Gu Zhou’s mind was filled with Mr. Chen. He said, “Hello, I’m Gu Zhou. I wonder if Mr. Chen is free these two days. I have a project to discuss with you.”

The man on the other end of the line was silent for a few seconds. Then, the man said, “Second Young Master Gu, I’ll pass this matter on to Mr. Chen. I’ll reply to you when he responds.”

“Okay!”
