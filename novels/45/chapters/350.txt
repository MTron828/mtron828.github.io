Chapter 351: Gigolo

That man was dressed very casually. It was impossible for such a man to be a young master of a wealthy family, especially when he was standing with a lowly person like Qiao Nian. It was even more impossible for him to be a young master of a wealthy family.

A trace of ridicule flashed in Qin Lu’s eyes. She said sarcastically, “Oh, Miss Qiao is here too. Why don’t you go in?”

Wang Hua stood at the side and said coldly, “The two of them don’t have an invitation. It’s very likely that they’re here to cause trouble, so they can’t enter.”

Qin Lu raised her eyebrows slightly and said with a smile, “Mr. Wang, you can’t say that. I heard that Mr. Qin Chuan has been preparing for such a grand charity auction for several years. It will definitely attract some people with ill intentions. Mr. Wang, your work is really too tiring.”

Qin Lu’s words were filled with humiliation for Qiao Nian and Lu Nian.

When Wang Hua heard Qin Lu’s words, he became even more certain of what he was thinking. He said, “Those without an invitation cannot enter!”

When Qiao Nian heard Wang Hua’s words, her eyes instantly turned cold.

Qin Lu’s lips curved up in a smug smile. She felt extremely happy. She had finally taken revenge for when she was beaten up in school.

Qin Lu moved slightly closer to Qiao Nian and gave her a sweet smile. “Miss Qiao, I know that you’re very interested in this charity auction. If you want to enter, it’ll be very easy. With my relationship with Mr. Wang, I can use my invitation to bring you in. As long as you don’t walk around, talk, or cause trouble, and just stay put!”

Lu Nian frowned and looked at Qin Lu coldly. “Get lost!”

This woman actually wanted him and the little fox to be her followers. She simply overestimated herself!

Qin Lu had never expected this gigolo to scold her in public. The sense of superiority she had just regained instantly disappeared. She frowned and said angrily, “You gigolo, what right do you have to speak here?”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Lu’s words, her expression instantly darkened. However, she quickly regained her composure.

......

In the next moment, Qiao Nian raised her hand and slapped Qin Lu’s face without hesitation.

Bam!

A crisp slap rang out, startling everyone nearby.

Qin Lu was also stunned. Her eyes instantly turned red, and tears welled up in her eyes. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

She had never expected that a country bumpkin without an invitation would actually dare to strut around and attack her. She simply did not know the immensity of heaven and earth.

The onlookers were also stunned.

Could it be that Miss Qiao had something against Qin Lu?

Although Qin Lu’s mother had long separated from the Qin family, Qin Lu was still a member of the Qin family. Everyone would still give Qin Lu some face.

Lu Nian’s lips curved up slightly.

Unexpectedly, this little fox was simply beautiful and valiant.

Moreover, the little fox was helping him slap her.

Realizing this, Lu Nian’s mood improved.

Qin Lu looked at Qiao Nian angrily. “Qiao Nian, are you done? How dare you hit me?”

Qiao Nian took out a piece of tissue and slowly wiped her hands. She casually threw the tissue at Qin Lu’s face and asked, “Why wouldn’t I dare? This isn’t the first time I’ve hit you!”

As long as she felt uncomfortable seeing Qin Lu, she would hit her every time she saw her. Moreover, she would never allow anyone to insult Mr. Dong Hua.

She had prepared this charity auction. Previously, she didn’t know Mr. Dong Hua’s identity, so she didn’t invite him. The main reason was that Mr. Dong Hua was too mysterious. Even if she wanted to invite him, she might not be able to.

Although she was very well-informed, Mr. Dong Hua was too low-profile. She did not manage to find out Mr. Dong Hua’s identity, nor did she know that the Lu family had a Second Young Master.
