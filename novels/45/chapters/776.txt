777 I Want to Be His Mommy

Initially, Matriarch Gu felt that Qiao Nian was no longer fated with their family. However, when she heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

Matriarch Gu hurriedly said with a serious expression, “Of course I’m telling the truth! How could I lie to you about such a thing? Xiao Qi did tell me that!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian’s heart was in a mess.

Although she was very happy that Gu Qi could say that, she didn’t know what to do now.

Back then, Gu Qi had said that because he had yet to find his biological mother.

She remembered that when Gu Qi was sick, he kept calling her Mommy.

She knew in her heart that Gu Qi yearned to find his mommy.

She still remembered Gu Qi’s voice. It was soft, like a piece of sweet bread.

For a moment, she felt that Gu Qi was calling her.

So Gu Qi really wanted her to be his mother.

Matriarch Gu noticed Qiao Nian’s conflicted expression and said sincerely, “Nian Nian, don’t feel pressured. If you’re willing to accept Xiao Qi, that would be great. If you’re unwilling to accept Xiao Qi, it’s actually nothing. I’ll make things clear with him.”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she hurriedly shook her head. “Grandma, there’s no need…”

A trace of surprise flashed in Matriarch Gu’s eyes. She looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

“Grandma, actually, I’m willing to be Xiao Qi’s mother!” Qiao Nian said firmly.

When Qiao Nian finished speaking, she heaved a sigh of relief. Actually, she didn’t know why she said that. She only knew that she really wanted to be Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s mother.

Before meeting Gu Qi and Xiao Shi, she had always thought that she could not accept other children.

After her children was gone, it was hard for her to accept other children.

As long as she saw other children, she would think of her two children who had long passed away. All that was left in her heart was sadness.

However, Gu Qi and Xiao Shi gave her a different feeling.

They reminded her of her own children, and she couldn’t help but think of them as hers.

Just now, when she heard Matriarch Gu say that Xiao Qi was very willing to let her be his mother, she was very happy. It was as if she knew that her child was still alive.

This feeling was very strange.

Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian lovingly and smiled gently, but there was still a trace of sadness in her eyes.

Although the ending seemed to be perfect, Nian Nian had to suffer.

Matriarch Gu was a person who valued tradition very much. Since Qiao Nian was already willing to acknowledge Gu Qi, they should hold a ceremony.

She pondered for a moment and asked, “Nian Nian, when do you think we can hold the ceremony?”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she shook her head gently and continued, “There’s no hurry in this matter. Since Xiao Qi is willing, I want to ask him personally later. The ceremony isn’t important!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded in agreement. “Alright, we’ll do as you say!”

Seeing that Qiao Nian still looked troubled, Gu Zhou’s face flashed across Matriarch Gu’s mind. She asked nervously, “Do you still mind that Ah Zhou hid the truth from you?”

“No!”

“Did Ah Zhou treat you badly?”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. “Grandma, don’t worry. He treats me very well.”

“Then what were you thinking about just now?” Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but ask.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Matriarch Gu’s face. She had already sent someone to pick up Gu Qi’s biological mother. She just didn’t know if all of this would change when Gu Qi’s biological mother returned.

However, she could not tell Matriarch Gu about this directly. Hence, she smiled and said, “Grandma, I’m just thinking about work.”

Matriarch Gu heaved a sigh of relief. She had thought that Qiao Nian was still a little dissatisfied with Gu Zhou. Now that she heard Qiao Nian’s words, she smiled and said, “You shouldn’t be too tired. There’s no end to your work. Rest more!”
