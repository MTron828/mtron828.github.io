Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

With this thought in mind, Qiao Xin stepped forward and gave a gentle smile, asking politely, “Excuse me, sisters, where are you moving these plants to?”

“The Gu family’s villa.”

The smile on Qiao Xin’s face froze. The Gu family’s villa. Wasn’t that where Qiao Nian lived?

Did Qiao Nian ask these people to move the plants?

“Are you moving all of these over?” Qiao Xin asked with a smile.

“Just these few.”

Qiao Xin’s gaze swept across the garden. These plants should belong to Mr. Fang. Qiao Nian definitely wouldn’t dare to move all of them away.

However, why was Qiao Nian taking away some of the plants?

Could there be a secret hidden in these plants?

At this moment, the nurses got into the van and prepared to leave.

Qiao Xin stepped forward quickly and smiled at one of the nurses. “Sister, please wait.”

The two young nurses looked at Qiao Xin in surprise.

Qiao Xin gave a sweet smile and said, “Sisters, my name is Qiao Xin. A while back, my sister said that she would give me a potted plant. I came here today to pick one. I’l bring it home tonight myself, in case my sister asks someone else to send one over again.”

The two nurses looked at Qiao Xin warily. Their gazes finally landed on Yang Ze’s face, as if questioning if that was the case.

Yang Ze nodded and introduced, “This is the Qiao family’s Second Young Mistress.”

The two nurses were instantly enlightened, and fawning smiles appeared on their faces. One of the nurses said, “In that case, Second Young Mistress Qiao, please choose any pot you want!”

Qiao Xin smiled and thanked them. She walked to the truck and took a few glances, then selected one of the plants at random. She thanked them again and left.

Although Qiao Xin didn’t recognize this pot of greenery, she had a strange feeling that this plant was very important.

After Qiao Xin drove home, she moved the pot into the house.

‘When she placed the green plant on the table in the courtyard, panting heavily, she finally realized that she had really moved a potted plant home herself.

She must be out of her mind.

Otherwise, why would she move a random pot home?

Su Xue came out of the house and saw Qiao Xin standing next to a potted plant, panting heavily. She said, “You’re the Young Mistress of the Qiao family. Moving potted plants is such a simple matter; why not ask someone to do it for you? Why would you need to do it yourself? Oh dear… this is…”

Before Su Xue could finish her sentence, she froze, staring at the green plant in disbelief. Her eyes were as wide as saucers.

“Mom, what’s wrong?” Qiao Xin asked casually, panting heavily.

“Daughter, tell me, where did you get this plant?” Su Xue’s voice was trembling with excitement. She stepped forward quickly and grasped Qiao Xin’s dirty hand.

Qiao Xin looked at Su Xue in surprise. Su Xue had always liked to be clean. “Mom, my hands are still dirty.”

“My dear daughter, tell me!” Su Xue looked at Qiao Xin excitedly.

Qiao Xin’s gaze fell on the pot of greenery. Puzzled, she asked, “Mom, what’s wrong?”

“Tm fine. Let me tell you, this is an extremely rare specimen of Suranne Grass. It’s hard to come by even in a hundred years!” As Su Xue said this, she was practically jumping in excitement.

Qiao Xin gasped in shock. Stunned, she stood frozen to the spot.

Suranne Grass.

Although Qiao Xin wasn’t a medical student, she still knew a little about top-grade herbs. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Three years ago, a mysterious buyer had bought a stalk of Suranne Grass for fifty million dollars.

Now that three years had passed, it was rumored that the price of Suranne Grass had already increased by more than 30 times.

Qiao Nian, this country bumpkin, could actually cultivate Suranne Grass?

How was this possible?

Yes, this had to be impossible!

Qiao Nian couldn’t have known that this was Suranne Grass.

“Mom, are you sure? Actually, this is just an ordinary plant. Perhaps it just looks like Suranne Grass!” Qiao Xin said, frowning.

“Daughter, have you forgotten? I studied Chinese medicine in the past. How could I be mistaken about this medicinal herb?”

Qiao Shan, who had just come out of the house, heard everything Su Xue and Qiao Xin said.

Qiao Shan quickly walked over and said excitedly, “Honey, are you sure that this is Suranne Grass?”

“I swear, this is definitely Suranne Grass!” Without hesitation, Su Xue raised three fingers and swore. After that, she looked anxiously at Qiao Xin. “Where exactly did this Suranne Grass come from?”

Qiao Xin felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She was utterly stunned. She had never expected this to truly be a priceless pot of Suranne Grass..
