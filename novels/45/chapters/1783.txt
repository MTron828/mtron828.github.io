Chapter 1784 - 1784 Strange Ritual

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze from Gu Zhou’s face and glanced at the others in the hall. All of them looked at the president fiercely, as if they were going to swallow him alive in the next second.

Mark glanced at Qiao Nian and frowned. He recalled how he had seen Qiao Nian in court previously and stared at her meaningfully.

To be honest, if Qiao Nian wasn’t his enemy, he really hoped to rope her to his side.

This was the last time he would tolerate Qiao Nian!

If Qiao Nian continued to be unrepentant, then don’t blame him for being rude.

At this moment, he could not blow things up. There were still members of the royal family and foreign friends outside the hall. Mark wanted to succeed the president naturally and did not want to leave a stain.

After thinking for a moment, Mark casually waved his hand and gestured for the emcee to let Wright personally put a ring on Lina.

Everyone who had been sitting outside watched as the bride, the Seventh Princess, walked straight into the hall. their eyes filled with confusion.

It was strange. They looked at the venue at the front. This was clearly the wedding event location. Why did the bride walk into the hall?T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Not only that, but they were sitting outside and could not see the emcee hosting the newlyweds at all.

“That’s strange. Have European weddings always been like this? On the day of the wedding, we don’t see the emcee hosting the newlyweds.”

“I don’t know. I’ve attended other weddings before, but this hasn’t happened.”

“Perhaps the newlyweds are more shy. After the ceremony inside, she will come out to do the ceremony.”

“Who knows? I keep feeling that something is wrong.”

Gu Ting, who was sitting at the ambassador’s table in Country Z, slowly took a sip of red wine. As he listened to the words of the people around him, he lowered his eyes slightly to hide the turbulence in them.

He quickly regained his composure and glanced at the media not far away from the corner of his eye. It seemed that Mark was really prepared to make a move today.

However, he did not know what was going on inside. Gu Ting took another sip of red wine and looked at the door of Mark’s manor with a complicated expression.

The emcee stood beside Wright and raised his hand. He placed the wedding ring on the tip of Wright’s index finger and thumb. He held Wright’s hand and was about to help Lina put on the ring.

Wright stood there in a daze like a marionette. He was controlled by the emcee and had no thoughts of his own.

From the corner of her eye, Qiao Nian glanced at Cui Huai, who was sitting in the first row on the left. Cui Huai’s hand was already on his waist. His blue eyes gradually turned red as hatred overlapped bit by bit.

Cui Huai’s gaze never landed on Lina and Wright from the beginning. He was staring intently at the President. He appeared here today to kill the President.

Qiao Nian glanced at Chen Sheng, who was sitting beside Cui Huai. Chen Sheng had his head lowered. His long eyelashes were lowered, hiding the turbulent waves in his eyes.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and her gaze landed on the faces of the others. Everyone looked nervously at the diamond ring in Wright’s hand.

She looked away, surprise flashing in her eyes.

If those people were attending the wedding this time to rebel, why were they so focused on seeing if Lina was wearing a ring?

Unless?

Wearing a ring was a signal?

Qiao Nian saw that the diamond ring was getting closer and closer to Lina, as if it would be on her hand in the next second.

She frowned and pulled Lina’s arm back. “No,” she said anxiously.

Lina looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. She still didn’t understand what had happened, but she knew very well that Qiao Nian would never harm her.

Qiao Nian subconsciously wanted to pull Lina behind her, but she did not expect the emcee to grab Lina’s hand and take the ring from Wright’s hand. She was about to forcefully put the ring on Lina.

Lina frowned and wanted to retract her hand, but the emcee’s grip was too strong. Her hand was red.

Qiao Nian took a step forward and shook off the emcee’s hand. The diamond ring the size of a pigeon’s egg drew a beautiful arc in the air before landing at Mark’s feet.
