Chapter 454: Beg for Mercy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jiang Chi lived on the highest mountain in MY. Standing in front of the French windows in the living room, he could look down on the entire MY.

This villa was about the same size as the Gu family’s residence in An City. The only difference was their renovation style.

The Gu family’s villa was decorated in a luxurious and modern European style.

However, when Jiang Chi’s villa was entered, it gave off a dazzling feeling. It had a very strange name: Ghost City.

Jiang Chi was the ruler of Ghost City.

Jiang Chi walked to the middle chair and sat down. It was a chair made of pure gold and engraved with dragon patterns. The dragon patterns were lifelike and intimidating.

Jiang Chi sat there calmly, his phoenix eyes narrowed slightly. He looked down on everyone like a high and mighty king.

At this moment, the leader walked in with the three of the robbers. They no longer looked as majestic as before. Their eyes were filled with fear as they said shakily, “Master Jiang, I’m sorry regarding Moon Goddess. We didn’t manage to get it back this time. Qiao Nian ran away…”

Jiang Chi placed his hand gently on the railing and tapped it twice. A snake crawled out from behind the chair.

The little snake lay quietly in Jiang Chi’s palm, flicking its tongue from time to time.

“This time, you guys caused quite a commotion!”

Although Jiang Chi’s tone was calm and sounded like he was talking about something that had nothing to do with him, the killing intent in his eyes was obvious.

The leader and his three subordinates were so frightened that their legs trembled and they knelt on the ground.

The leader said fearfully, “Chief Jiang, it’s our fault. Qiao Nian is too cunning. We didn’t expect her to…”

“Did you shoot?” Jiang Chi interrupted the leader mercilessly.

The four men were slightly stunned and looked at each other. For a moment, they did not know what Jiang Chi meant by asking this!

Their orders were to bring the Moon Goddess over, regardless of anyone else’s life or death.

What made them feel strange was that after Lu Zhu was injured, their orders were to bring Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian back alive.

When they received this order, they had a bad feeling.

They had almost killed Qiao Nian.

If they really killed Qiao Nian, even if she didn’t die, Jiang Chi would skin them alive.

The leader pursed his lips slightly and said carefully, “Chief Jiang, our orders are to get the Moon Goddess and kill Qiao Nian!”

During this period of time, they had arranged to listen to Song Yue.

Hearing the leader’s words, a cold glint flashed across Jiang Chi’s eyes, and his hand involuntarily tightened around the green snake.

At this moment, the green snake’s body tensed up in pain and it spat out its red tongue. Even though it was in so much pain, it did not dare to bite Jiang Chi.

The temperature in the room instantly dropped.

“Have you forgotten who your master is?!” Jiang Chi glanced at the four of them coldly.

The four of them were not idiots. When they heard Jiang Chi’s words, they instantly realized that Song Yue must have deliberately spread the news, causing them to make a mistake.

“Master Jiang, it’s all our fault. Please spare us!”

The leader prostrated himself on the ground devoutly, begging desperately.

The other three lay on the ground, not daring to look up.

Jiang Chi completely ignored what they were saying. His gaze landed on the green snake in his hand and he said, “Xiao Qing, have you been starving recently?”

With a gesture from Jiang Chi, Xiao Qing climbed down from the chair and slithered towards the four people kneeling on the ground.

When Xiao Qing came to the four of them, its eyes stared greedily at the food in front of it.

The four of them instantly understood. They suppressed the fear in their hearts and handed their hands to the green snake.

The green snake bit down without hesitation. The venom between its teeth entered a man’s body through the wound. Its eyes narrowed slightly as it tried its best to swallow a man’s blood.

The green snake was not greedy. After a while, it bit another person.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
