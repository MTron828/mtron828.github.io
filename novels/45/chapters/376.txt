Chapter 377: Incomparable

Qiao Xin sighed and continued to complain. “Although Mom and Dad aren’t her biological parents, our family has raised her for so many years. How can there be such a heartless person in this world?”

Qiao Yu finally reacted. His expression turned stern as he said in a low voice, “Xin Xin!”

“Huh?” Qiao Xin was slightly stunned.

This was the first time she had seen her brother so serious. She was not used to it.

“The Qiao family has never raised her,” Qiao Yu said calmly with a trace of displeasure in his tone.

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, her face instantly turned pale. Had she heard wrongly? Her brother was defending Qiao Nian.

A trace of grievance flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

Qiao Xin felt terrible. Her brother was actually criticizing her for Qiao Nian’s sake.

What was so good about Qiao Nian?

Qiao Xin was about to list out Qiao Nian’s shortcomings one by one, but after thinking for a long time, she couldn’t find any.

Qiao Xin felt even worse.

...

Seeing Qiao Xin like this, Qiao Yu gently stroked her head. His expression softened as he comforted her. “Alright, let’s go home now!”

The displeasure in Qiao Xin’s heart gradually dissipated. She obediently took Qiao Yu’s arm and nodded. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Indeed, her brother still doted on her the most. As long as she was sad, her brother would comfort her.

It was her greatest honor and pride to have a brother like Qiao Yu.

Her greatest hope now was that her brother would get married a little later. That way, her brother would be able to dote on her for a few more years.

Previously, her good friends had all said that as long as her brother got married, her brother would only have eyes for his little wife. There would be no need for him to have a younger sister.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin felt a little upset. She asked tentatively, “Brother, is there anyone you like now?”

Qiao Yu didn’t speak. He just stared at Qiao Nian’s back, unable to come back to his senses for a long time.

Qiao Xin’s lips curved up slightly. Since her brother didn’t say anything, it meant that he didn’t like anyone.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin’s mood instantly improved.

The auction in the banquet hall was in full swing.

Jiang Yue stood in a corner and watched as the wealthy businessmen enthusiastically bid for the items they wanted in order to build a school for children in the poor mountains.

The banquet hall was clearly very lively, but Jiang Yue’s heart seemed to have fallen into a winter icehouse. It was bone-chilling.

Today, she had also seen the legendary stone wall painting.

This stone wall was exactly the same as the photo she had seen in Gu Zhou’s study when she was young.

The only difference was that the photo in Gu Zhou’s study was only seven inches wide, while the stone wall was drawn.

Jiang Yue’s beautiful eyes narrowed involuntarily.

She was very curious now. What was the relationship between this painting and Brother Gu Zhou’s photo? Why would Brother Gu Zhou spend so much money on it?

What surprised Jiang Yue the most was how Qiao Nian had managed to draw a picture of Brother Gu Zhou back then.

Jiang Yue had thought that Qiao Nian was just a country bumpkin. She had never expected her to be the famous artist, Miss Huang Shi.

She had thought that she was not much inferior to Qiao Nian, but now, she felt that she was in the wrong. Perhaps she would never be able to compare to Qiao Nian in her life.

At this moment, a girl in work clothes walked in from the side. Her sweet voice interrupted Jiang Yue’s thoughts. “Miss Jiang, these are the tea leaves you wanted!”

The girl handed a beautiful porcelain tea box to Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue smiled and took the tea box. “Thank you.”

A sweet smile appeared on the girl’s face. “Miss Jiang, you’re too polite. If you need anything in the future, you can call me again.”
