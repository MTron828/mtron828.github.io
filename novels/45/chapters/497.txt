Doctor Sha’s office.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu’s report.

From the report, the wounds around Lu Zhu’s heart had already healed. All that was left was to slowly recuperate.

Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart finally relaxed. She heaved a sigh of relief and said with relief, “That’s great. It’s finally healed.”

Doctor Sha nodded in agreement, and the tension in his heart gradually relaxed. Lu Zhu’s condition had stabilized, and his life would not be in danger anymore.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said, “You can give me the paternity test now!”

Doctor Sha took it out of the safe and handed it to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian took the report, her eyes filled with anticipation. After a long while, she asked, “Can you do me a favor?”

“Yes.”

“There are three hours to nine p.m. I want you to take my brother to the back garden of the hospital by then. I want to surprise him.”

Doctor Sha smiled. “It would be my honor to witness your reunion with your brother!”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Thank you.”

8:50 P.M.

Doctor Sha personally applied the medicine and bandaged Lu Zhu’s wound. His expression was serious as he said, “Mr. Lu, the bullet caused a lot of damage to the area around your skin this time. Fortunately, you recovered well and there was no infection. However, there will be a scar here in the future.”

When Lu Zhu heard Doctor Sha say this, he looked indifferent. “I’m still alive. This injury is nothing.”

When Doctor Sha heard Lu Zhu say this, he smiled and said, “Then I’m relieved.”

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on the door of the ward. His eyes narrowed slightly. Qiao Nian had not come over since evening.

Lu Zhu asked casually, “Where did Doctor Qiao go?”

When Doctor Sha heard Lu Zhu say this, he sighed and said, “Doctor Qiao has been watching over you in the ward during this period. I saw that she didn’t look too good, so I let her go back to the hotel to rest first.”

Hearing Doctor Sha’s words, Lu Zhu recalled how Qiao Nian had been sleeping by his bed this morning. Her eyes were dark and she looked haggard.

Actually, he had asked Qiao Nian to return to the hotel to rest this morning, but she only smiled and didn’t agree.

During this period of time, Qiao Nian took good care of him. He was very grateful to her.

Doctor Sha glanced at the watch on his wrist. It was almost time for his appointment with Qiao Nian.

“Mr. Lu, you should exercise more now. Why don’t I go out with you for a walk and tell you some things to take note of later so that there won’t be any repercussions?”

Lu Zhu did not think too much about it. He nodded and said, “Thank you, Doctor Sha!”

‘It’s no more than my duty.”

Doctor Sha walked to Lu Zhu’s right and prepared to support him.

However, Lu Zhu rejected him very politely.

“I feel better now, Doctor Sha. You don’t have to hold me.”

Doctor Sha nodded. “It’s good if you can move on your own.”

Then the two of them walked out of the ward side by side. After entering the elevator, Doctor Sha became involuntarily nervous.

He was a little worried that Lu Zhu could tell that he was nervous and did not mention it directly.

When they reached downstairs, a refreshing breeze blew past their faces. It was mixed with the fragrance of flowers, making them feel happy!

Lu Zhu had been lying in the ward for a long time. Now that he felt the aura of nature, he felt much more relaxed.

“Doctor Sha.”

“Yes?”

“How are Song Yue’s injuries now?” Lu Zhu asked calmly.

Doctor Sha couldn’t tell if Lu Zhu was concerned about Song Yue or if he had other thoughts, so he answered truthfully, “Miss Song Yue’s uterus was severely injured, so we can only remove her uterus. She’s fine, but the only bad thing is that she can’t be a mother anymore.”
