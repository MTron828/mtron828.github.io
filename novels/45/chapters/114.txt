Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Now, all the members of the elite in An City were staring at him and Qiao Xin. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Su Yan had never felt so superior in his life. In that instant, he was overwhelmed with a wave of pride. He raised his head arrogantly, gazing at Qiao Xin with deep affection.

“This pot of Suranne Grass was given to me by my girlfriend, Qiao Xin. She cultivated it herself.”

Everyone was stunned by his words.

The smile on Qiao Xin’s face didn’t change. She stole a glance at Qiao Nian and heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that Qiao Nian had no other expression on her face.

“Miss Qiao Xin is truly a lady of great capability. She actually managed to cultivate Suranne Grass!”

“Theard that even expert herbalists in our country can’t cultivate such a valuable plant!”

“Qiao Xin? Why haven’t I heard of the daughter of the Qiao family before?”

“Then you must be ill-informed. I heard that Miss Qiao Xin has always kept a low profile!”

“By the way, I remember something, At Matriarch Shen’s last birthday banquet, there was someone named Qiao Nian. I think she’s also a daughter of the Qiao family?”

“That’s right, that’s right. I know about that. Qiao Nian was locked up because of a mental illness. I heard that she grew up in a village. She’s not even worth mentioning, She clearly can’t compare to Qiao Xin!”

“That’s right, that’s right. It’s really surprising that Qiao Xin can cultivate Suranne Grass. Perhaps the government will even hire her to specially cultivate Suranne Grass!”

Su Yan listened to the discussion around him and felt immensely proud of himself.

He was really glad that he was together with Qiao Xin. Although Qiao Nian was the principal of An University, so what? Qiao Xin was miles ahead of her!

Today, Qiao Xin was wearing a light green dress with shoulder straps. Beneath the lace was a fishtail skirt, accentuating her curvaceous figure.

Qiao Xin had a sweet, round face, which made her look approachable.

Today was the grand opening of the research institute. Director Lin had invited many members of the press. Now that they knew that Qiao Xin had cultivated Suranne Grass, they all aimed their cameras and microphones at Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin smiled gently, feeling immensely proud of herself. So this was what it felt like to be at the top.

Those reporters longed to record every move Qiao Xin made, thinking that once the news got out, they could earn a lot of money through publicity.

An excited reporter stepped forward and aimed the microphone at Qiao Xin, asking in admiration, “Miss Qiao Xin, it’s said that Suranne Grass is extremely difficult to cultivate. How did you cultivate it?”

When the big shots of the medical field heard the reporter’s question, they all stared unblinkingly at Qiao Xin. Some even took out pens and notebooks, preparing to write down every word Qiao Xin said.

“The living conditions of Suranne Grass are quite specific. It has to be kept at a constant temperature of 26 degrees Celsius. It has to be placed in sunlight in the morning for three hours a day, and in the afternoon, it has to be placed in a dark room. Its growth period is three years: one year for

germination, and two years for maturation. During this period, there are still many details to take note of. If anything goes wrong, the Suranne Grass might wither,” Qiao Xin said with a smile.

Actually, she wasn’t clear about the cultivation method of Suranne Grass either. She had only found this information from Baidu’.

“Oh my god, this Suranne Grass sounds so troublesome to cultivate!”

“No wonder no one can keep Suranne Grass alive. Such meticulous care really tests one’s patience!”

“Every generation brings forth a talent. I really didn’t expect Young Mistress Qiao Xin to be able to cultivate Suranne Grass at such a young age!”

“Let me tell you, I heard that back then, the Gu family wanted Qiao Xin to marry Second Young Master Gu to get rid of the Gu family’s bad luck. Fortunately, the Qiao couple asked Qiao Nian to marry into the Gu family instead. Otherwise, Miss Qiao Xin’s entire life would have been ruined!”

“Yes, Second Young Master Gu is not in good health. Miss Qiao Xin would definitely have become a living widow if she married him!”

“Oh my god, is that true?”

“Isn’t that so? Don’t you think Second Young Master Gu regretted marrying Qiao Nian when he came here today? Perhaps he’s planning to propose to Qiao Xin again, and beg her to marry him!”

Listening to the words of those people, Qiao Nian truly felt that gossip was a fearful thing, If these rumors were repeated often enough, they would soon be accepted as truth!

Those people had made her sound so despicable with just a few words. They even said that Gu Zhou was Qiao Xin’s fawning dog. Their imaginations truly knew no bounds. It was a pity that they weren’t screenwriters!
