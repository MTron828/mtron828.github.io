Chapter 160 Solve the Riddle

The gown reached her ankles, but there was a slit about ten centimeters above her knees. Such a design was quite proper and formal, and she wouldn’t embarrass herself by accident. However, for some reason, when Gu Zhou looked at her like that, Qiao Nian felt as if she was naked.

At this moment, the ceremony began. The emcee was the president of the student union of the Second Academy of Medicine. He walked to the center of the stage and spoke into the microphone, giving a long string of polite opening remarks. Then, his gaze fell on Qiao Nian, who was standing not far away. He said, “Next, let’s invite Professor Qiao Nian to give a speech for us!”

At this moment, the people around them began to whisper.

“This is the person who stole Senior Jiang Yue’s spot as the first lecturer. I want to see what she’s capable of.”

“Not only did she steal Senior Jiang Yue’s spot, but she also tried to steal Senior Jiang Yue’s gown. She’s simply too shameless.”

“In a while, during the Q & A session, we’ll ask more complicated questions, so that she won’t be able to answer them. Then, she’ll embarrass herself in public.”

Amidst all kinds of criticism, Qiao Nian walked on stage. She walked to the microphone and said, “Let me start off with a riddle. Everyone, do try and guess the answer.” When the people below heard Qiao Nian’s words, their eyes widened.

“Is she retarded?”

“This is such a serious occasion. Does she think that riddles are suitable?”

“Does… does she not know what to say at all?”

Qiao Nian completely ignored their words and continued, “One night, a man was driving through the countryside when he suddenly had a stomachache. He took a few pieces of paper from a stack of paper on the passenger seat. Taking them to a field in the middle of nowhere, he suddenly laughed, then cried. The next day, he died. May I know how the man died?”

At this moment, the entire hall fell silent. Some people were contemplating the answer, while others were looking at her with ridicule.

A faint smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She raised her eyebrows slightly. With just one sentence, she had heightened the atmosphere of the ceremony considerably.

“If anyone can answer correctly, I’ll give them a pot of Suranne Grass worth tens of millions, no matter who it is.”

At this moment, the entire hall was in an uproar.

“How is this possible? How can she have Suranne Grass?”

“She must be spouting nonsense.”

“Hurry up, go and investigate her background.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When Liu Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked at Jiang Yue with some uncertainty and asked, “Yue Yue, did Qiao Nian take the precious medicinal ingredients in your house, and bring them here as gifts?”

Jiang Yue didn’t speak. She clenched her fists involuntarily, her nails digging into her palms.

Jiang Yue knew that Qiao Nian wasn’t boasting without basis. Moreover, she knew that Qiao Nian did own such expensive medicinal plants.

Jiang Yue had never expected that the Suranne Grass given to Qiao Nian by either Grandma or Brother Gu Zhou would be taken out of the house by Qiao Nian, just to get in the crowd’s good books.

This was simply too much.

If Grandma knew about this, she would definitely be very upset.

With this thought in mind, Jiang Yue turned to look at Gu Zhou, who was sitting not far away.

Gu Zhou was sitting at the back with the Lu siblings. At this moment, Gu Zhou was leaning lazily against his chair, his beautiful eyes slightly narrowed. He was staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with an emotion she couldn’t read.

However, what surprised Jiang Yue even more was that Lu Zhu was also looking at Qiao Nian. He seemed to be very interested in this riddle. Jiang Yue’s breathing quickened. How was this possible?

Lu Zhu was actually interested in a riddle!

Lu Zhu was like an otherworldly immortal. How could he be interested in a riddle given by Qiao Nian?

Jiang Yue narrowed her eyes, and the smile on her face froze. She lowered her head in silence.

Qiao Xin, who was sitting not far away, heard Qiao Nian announcing the giving away of Suranne Grass. She grabbed Qiao Yu’s hand and squeezed it involuntarily.
