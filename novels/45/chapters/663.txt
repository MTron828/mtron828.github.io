Chapter 664: There Must Be Something Hateful About Pitiful People

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Su Sheng’s legs felt a little weak. If her senior sister hadn’t been supporting her, she would have knelt on the ground long ago.

Gu Qing nodded and said, “Yes, I’ll take her out now!”

With that, Gu Qing grabbed Su Sheng’s arm and walked out.

When Gu Qing brought Su Sheng to the door, she saw Lu Zhu standing there.

At this moment, Lu Zhu was emitting a cold aura, like a demon from hell.

Su Sheng’s tears welled in her eyes.

She had already been abandoned by Lu Nian, but so what? If someone like Lu Zhu knew that Qiao Nian was two-timing, he would definitely hate her even more.

It seemed that Qiao Nian was in deep trouble.

Just as Su Sheng was about to complain, she couldn’t help but meet Lu Zhu’s cold eyes.

How should she describe it? Lu Zhu looked at her as if he was looking at a dead person.

How had this happened?

Lu Zhu should hate Qiao Nian.

She still remembered that Lu Zhu had looked at her gently just now. Why was he looking at her like this now?

Could it be because she had told the truth?

Su Sheng gasped. That made sense. Rich men all cared about their dignity. What she had just said was the truth. Perhaps Lu Zhu hated Qiao Nian to the core, but what Lu Zhu cared about the most now was his dignity.

Su Sheng’s breathing involuntarily intensified.

At this moment, Lu Nian and Qiao Nian, who were in the piano room, both noticed Lu Zhu.

Lu Nian stood there calmly. It was rare for him to see his brother look at others so fiercely, and his eyes were filled with confusion.

He recalled what he was tols previously, and his eyes gradually darkened. Could it be that Big Brother had really fallen for Qiao Nian?

Lu Nian’s frown deepened.

Seeing her brother like this, Qiao Nian had a bad feeling.

It seemed that her brother was really angry. Su Sheng was going to be in big trouble this time.

“Just now, you said that Nian Nian had an improper relationship with me?” Lu Zhu’s voice was low and hoarse. Every word seemed to have been tempered in an icehouse.

When Lu Nian heard the words Nian Nian, his narrow eyes narrowed slightly.

Su Sheng’s body trembled uncontrollably, and her mind went blank.

After a long while, Su Sheng came back to her senses. She didn’t understand what had happened at all.

Why had things turned out like this?

First, she was hated by Mr. Dong Hua, and now, she was questioned by Lu Zhu.

Who was Lu Zhu? He was the eldest young master of the Lu family in An City.

Someone like Lu Zhu could kill her with a casual sentence.

At this moment, Su Sheng was truly afraid. Her lips trembled, and she was so frightened that she could not speak.

Su Sheng looked at Gu Qing in fear, tears welling up in her eyes.

Gu Qing met Su Sheng’s eyes and sighed helplessly.

Su Sheng was too competitive. As long as someone was more outstanding than her, she would always pick on others.

She had discovered this problem with Su Sheng in the past.

But in her studio, other than her, Su Sheng had the most power.

At that time, Gu Qing felt that Su Sheng had some foresight and wouldn’t spout nonsense.

But today, Gu Qing realized how wrong she was.

Su Sheng had gone too far today. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Moreover, she had already interrupted Su Sheng several times, but Su Sheng was still stubborn.

Gu Qing sighed slightly. Although Su Sheng had made a huge mistake today, she had promised her parents, who had long passed away, that she would take good care of Su Sheng.

Gu Qing’s gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face. Only then did she realize that Lu Zhu already wanted to kill Su Sheng.

Gu Qing narrowed her eyes slightly. She hurriedly pulled Su Sheng behind her and looked up at Lu Zhu. With a sincere expression, she said, “Ah Zhu, Su Sheng has indeed said a lot of things wrong today. I’ll apologize to you, Ah Nian, and Miss Qiao on her behalf. I’ll definitely discipline her well in the future.”

At this point, Gu Qing turned back to look at Su Sheng.

At this moment, Su Sheng was no longer as arrogant as she usually was. All that was left was unease. Su Sheng stood there trembling like a drenched chicken in the rain. She looked extremely pitiful.

As the saying went, there must be something hateful about pitiful people.

If Su Sheng had kept quiet today, the situation would not have been so awkward.

What made Gu Qing curious was what relationship Qiao Nian had with Lu Zhu and Lu Nian. Why would those two take such good care of Qiao Nian?

Although she had a lot of questions in her mind, she understood one thing. The less she knew, the better.
