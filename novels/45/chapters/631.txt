Chapter 632: Compensation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Matriarch Gu thought that she would have a good talk with Gu Zhou later. She couldn’t let Qiao Nian continue to misunderstand things.

After dinner, Qiao Nian was about to bring Gu Qi to the garden to sit for a while when Matriarch Gu stopped her.

“Nian Nian, come up with me first.”

“Okay, Grandma.” Seeing this, Qiao Nian nodded. She squatted down slightly and said to Gu Qi, “Little Qi, can you wait for me in the garden for a while?”

Gu Qi’s beautiful eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian. They flickered. He shook his head and glanced at the sofa in the living room.

The meaning in his eyes could not be clearer.

Gu Qi probably wanted to say that he wanted to sit on the sofa in the living room and wait for her.

Holding Gu Qi’s hand, Qiao Nian led him to the sofa and Gu Qi sat down.

She said gently, “Then Little Qi will wait for me here, okay?”

Gu Qi nodded.

“Our Little Qi is such a good boy.” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi dotingly, then stood up and walked towards Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu retracted her gaze from Gu Qi indifferently. She frowned slightly.

If Qiao Nian found out the truth in the future, she might hate Gu Zhou and this child.

It seemed that only she could give Qiao Nian more compensation.

Seeing Qiao Nian walk over, Matriarch Gu smiled brightly and said gently, “Nian Nian, come with me to my room.”

“Okay,” Qiao Nian replied. She followed Matriarch Gu towards the stairs. After taking two steps, she turned back to look at the sofa and met Gu Qi’s beautiful eyes. The two of them smiled at each other.

Matriarch Gu’s attention had been completely on Qiao Nian just now. She had seen all of Qiao Nian’s small actions.

Due to this, Matriarch Gu’s heart ached even more for Qiao Nian.

Ever since Qiao Nian married into the Gu family, she had been working hard every day.

A few days ago, Qiao Nian had just returned from MY. She hadn’t been able to rest for a day, yet she had begun to take care of Gu Qi again. She even had to comfort her, a sad old woman.

After returning to her room, Matriarch Gu invited Qiao Nian to sit on the sofa and wait for her.

Qiao Nian sat down obediently on the sofa and looked at Matriarch Gu in confusion. “Grandma?”

“Wait for me.” Matriarch Gu smiled at Qiao Nian, then walked towards the dressing table. She opened the top drawer and took out a silver jewelry box.

Matriarch Gu walked over to Qiao Nian and sat down. She placed the jewelry box in her hand into Qiao Nian’s palm.

“Grandma, you…” Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu in confusion.

“You’re usually too plain. You don’t even have any accessories on you. Hurry up and open it to see if you like this.” Matriarch Gu smiled lovingly.

“Grandma, thank you. You’re so good to me,” Qiao Nian said sincerely.

Previously, other than her grandfather and a few senior brothers who treated her sincerely, no one else had ever treated her so well.

Later on, she reunited with her brother. Her brother treated her quite well, but that was only between family members.

“Child, I just hope that you can live a happier life.” When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, her heart was filled with guilt.

She was clearly the one who had let Qiao Nian down, but this child was genuinely good to her.

“Nian Nian, I hope that you won’t divorce Gu Zhou because you’re angry with him in the future. There are some things that he has no choice but to do.” After Matriarch Gu finished speaking, she felt that she was making things difficult for her. She sighed and said, “Forget it. No matter what you do, I’ll support you.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Seeing the guilt in Matriarch Gu’s eyes, Qiao Nian felt a trace of doubt.

She felt that something was wrong with Matriarch Gu’s expression. She asked worriedly, “Grandma, did something happen at home?”

“No, don’t let your imagination run wild.” Matriarch Gu put away the guilt in her eyes and looked at Qiao Nian dotingly. She really hoped that this child would lead a happier life.

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She felt that Matriarch Gu might be sad because of her eldest son.
