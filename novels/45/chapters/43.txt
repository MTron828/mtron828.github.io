Chapter 44: Did You Bring a Gun?

Qiao Nian glanced at the public bench beside her and calmly walked over to sit down. Seeing Zheng He approach, she said impassively, “How did all that laughter feel?”

Zheng He stopped in his tracks. His pants were still damp. He had laughed for too long, and now his face felt extremely stiff.

“Hmph, who’s afraid of who?” Zheng He stood leaning against a tree, gazing into the distance with a calm expression. Deep down, he was puzzled. How did Qiao Nian have the guts to just sit there?

Chen Qing, who was standing not far away, observed Qiao Nian’s composed demeanor. His heart surged with emotion.

His Second Young Madam was indeed something else!

Chen Qing moved closer to Gu Zhou and said in a low voice, “Second Young Madam is truly both beautiful and valiant!”

“Did you bring a gun?”

Chen Qing’s good mood dissipated. His Second Young Master was exuding a frigid aura, and looked as cold as ice.

Qiao Xin stood not far away, her eyes red-rimmed. She looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. After a beat, she tugged at Su Yan’s arm helplessly. “Brother Su Yan, will my sister be alright?”

Su Yan frowned when he heard Qiao Xin’s words. “Qiao Xin, you’re too kind!”

Qiao Xin blinked at Su Yan, her expression full of distress. She whispered, “If Second Young Master Gu had been willing to help my sister, surely things wouldn’t have turned out this way!”

At Qiao Xin’s words, Su Yan glanced at Gu Zhou, who was standing not far away.

Gu Zhou stood there expressionlessly. There was no trace of light in his dark eyes. It was as if he was a mere spectator, and the happenings had nothing to do with him whatsoever.

However, what bothered Su Yan was that Gu Zhou’s gaze never left Qiao Nian’s face.

He was a little unsure of what Gu Zhou was thinking.

“Qiao Nian has committed so many evils. She deserves to be bullied. Don’t feel worried,” Su Yan consoled.

When Qiao Xin heard Su Yan’s words, she felt more at ease. She knew that Su Yan wouldn’t interfere, so she didn’t say anything else.

She looked toward Gu Zhou, who was standing not far away. Gu Zhou didn’t seem to have any intention of interfering. If that was the case, there would be another good show soon.

Tonight, Qiao Nian’s reputation would be ruined.

Just as everyone was filled with anticipation, eight muscular men walked into the Shen residence.

The man at the front was wearing a suit, and had a thick gold chain around his neck. His collar was unbuttoned all the way to his abdomen, so his abs could be seen faintly. He roared, “Who dared to bully my younger brother? Come out right now!”

With one hand in his pocket, Zheng Xiang gave off a ruthless aura.

Qiao Nian looked at him, her expression blank.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian and said uneasily, “Sister seems to be frightened. What should we do?”

Su Yan didn’t reply, merely gazed quietly at Qiao Nian.

The people who attended the banquet today were all people with status and power. None of them liked Zheng He, but what could they do? Zheng He’s status made them all afraid to do anything.

“Qiao Nian is definitely going to lose badly this time. Zheng Xiang is a Class C in the Zheng family. Usually, he handles extremely important missions. On every mission he handles, there will be blood!”

“I think Qiao Nian’s innocence will be in jeopardy.”

“Second Young Master Gu wanted to protect her just now. If she hadn’t insisted on leaving, this wouldn’t have happened!”

…

“Who is it? Who dared to bully my brother? Show your face! Otherwise, if I catch you, I’ll wring your head off and use it as a urinal!” Zheng Xiang roared impatiently.

“It’s me.” Qiao Nian sat there, her expression unchanged. Her voice was unhurried, and her eyes were slightly narrowed. There was no hint of fear in her voice.

Zheng Xiang was taken aback.

What?

A woman?

Zheng Xiang couldn’t quite believe Qiao Nian’s words. He turned to look at Zheng He with questioning eyes.

Zheng He had initially wanted his brother to help, but for some reason, he felt embarrassed. He hadn’t even managed to handle a woman. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
