Chapter 149 Paternity Test

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly. He was in an excellent mood, but when he spoke, his words dripped with sarcasm. “What right? Qiao Yu, you think too highly of yourself.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

With that, Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Yu and whispered something into his ear.

No one knew what Gu Zhou had said, but everyone saw Qiao Yu’s face turn pale in an instant. His brow furrowed deeply.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned when she saw Qiao Yu’s expression change. This was the first time she had seen someone who could make Qiao Yu turn pale. Qiao Xin was sensitive enough to sense that something was off with the atmosphere. Worried that Gu Zhou and Qiao Yu would start fighting, she tried to change the subject. Qiao Xin’s eyes darted to the cake not far away. After a beat, she looked at Qiao Yu, speaking in the manner of a spoiled child. “Brother, I feel like eating cake. Will you go with me now?”

Qiao Yu gave Qiao Nian a meaningful look, then patted Qiao Xin’s head dotingly. “Okay.”

With that, Qiao Yu left with Qiao Xin.

Qiao Nian had always known that Qiao Yu loved spoiling his younger sister, and would accede to her any request. It was just that Qiao Yu didn’t like Qiao Nian one bit.

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and his gaze fell on her face. “Where’s your gown?”

“It’ll be here in a while.” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou curiously and asked in confusion, “What did you say to him just now?”

“It doesn’t matter.” Gu Zhou didn’t want to let Qiao Nian know what he had said.

Qiao Nian didn’t ask further. She turned back to look at Qiao Yu’s retreating back, her breathing a little uneven.

“Qiao Nian.” Gu Zhou called her by her full name, his voice low and hoarse.

“Yes?” Qiao Nian turned back to look at Gu Zhou, her eyes filled with confusion.

Gu Zhou reached out and patted Qiao Nian’s head. In a calm voice, he said, “If you don’t want to hold back, don’t. You don’t have to tolerate this. If you face any trouble, I’ll help

you.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in surprise, momentarily forgetting to speak. She had wanted revenge for a long time. She believed that Gu Zhou had always known about this.

But she had never expected Gu Zhou to be willing to help her.

Qiao Nian’s heart gave a violent jerk. After a long while, she said, “You…”

However, the rest of the sentence got lodged in her throat. Qiao Nian didn’t know what to say.

Out of habit, Gu Zhou straightened his tie and said unhurriedly, “The results of the paternity test are out.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. She had kept this matter a well-guarded secret. How did Gu Zhou know?

Without waiting for Qiao Nian to speak, Gu Zhou continued, “I’m in charge of operations at the paternity test center.”

Qiao Nian: …

Qiao Nian froze for a moment, then frowned. Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian intently, taking in all of her emotions. Instead of announcing the results immediately, he waited for her to speak.

“What were the results?” After hesitating for a moment, Qiao Nian decided to ask.

“Congratulations, your intuition was very accurate. You’re not Qiao Shan’s biological daughter.” Gu Zhou’s voice turned cold.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile.

The taut string in Qiao Nian’s heart finally slackened. All the tension drained from her shoulders.

She hated those people from the Qiao family, and hated herself for having anything to do with the Qiao family. It made her feel dirty to the extreme.

Su Xue was having an affair. Qiao Nian knew in her heart that this was definitely not the first time Su Xue had an affair. Someone who had cheated before would definitely cheat again. How could someone as dirty as Su Xue be her relative?

Back when she was living with the elderly grandfather who had taken her in, Qiao Nian had thought that she was an orphan. Although they had been poor, she lived a happy life in the countryside!

But after that, she was brought to the Qiao family. For no reason, she gained a brother and sister, and for no reason, she suffered unfair treatment.

Everyone told her to take good care of her younger sister, Qiao Xin.

They also wanted her to listen to her older brother, even if her brother did those things to her.

Their family was worse than a pack of beasts. What right did they have to treat someone else’s daughter like she was less than human?
