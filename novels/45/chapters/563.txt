Chapter 564: Is That Possible?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This…

Was this possible?

If Second Young Madam had just arrived at the Gu residence, Second Young Master would definitely chase her out for Little Master.

But now.

Back in MY, Second Young Master had used that power for Second Young Madam and even went against Jiang Chi.

Would Second Young Master really chase Second Young Madam out?

Chen Qing asked tentatively, “Should we let Second Young Madam know…”

“Are you teaching me how to do things?” Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. His eyes were like deep pools without a trace of warmth, but they seemed to carry the aura of death. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I wouldn’t dare. I… I just don’t know what to do.” Chen Qing hurriedly begged for mercy.

To be honest, he was really curious about Second Young Master’s attitude towards Second Young Madam.

Gu Zhou looked at the snake in his hand indifferently, his thoughts drifting away. He recalled the first time he had seen Qiao Nian.

At that time, he was in the study investigating that person. The snake, which had been obediently staying by his side, suddenly rushed out like an arrow.

At that time, he had also chased after it. He saw the snake attacking Qiao Nian.

At that time, he had thought that Qiao Nian would definitely die.

However, he had never expected Qiao Nian to catch the snake so easily. The snake was so frightened that it no longer dared to move.

He was the Second Young Master of the Gu family. Many people were keeping an eye on the Gu family. When he saw this, there was only one thought in his mind. Qiao Nian’s motive for coming to the Gu family was not simple.

However, what happened next was beyond his expectations.

Qiao Nian had devoted herself wholeheartedly to the Gu family and had even taken good care of Grandma. Her illness was also alleviated because of her.

She had risked her life for Lu Zhu alone.

With so many things happening, he realized that Qiao Nian might really have been forced to marry him.

Gu Zhou’s gaze darkened. His voice was hoarse as he said thoughtfully, “Jiang Yue has just left. Zhao Qian is also going overseas to study. If she leaves again, Grandma might not be able to take it!”

Chen Qing was speechless.

Chen Qing lowered his head and didn’t speak. He didn’t know if Matriarch Lin couldn’t handle this, or if Second Young Master couldn’t.

Second Young Master was too difficult to test.

As Chen Qing was thinking, he heard Second Young Master say coldly, “Do you want to lose your job?”

He suddenly looked up and saw Second Young Master talking to the snake. He immediately cowered and hurriedly said, “Second Young Master, I’ll get on with my work!”

With that, Chen Qing quickly walked out, afraid that the snake would swallow him if he was a step slower.

He had thought that Second Young Master would give him more year-end bonuses now that he had Second Young Madam and Little Master. He didn’t expect Second Young Master to stop him from laying the tiles, and instead make him a meal for the snake.

Sigh.

When would he be able to live a stable life?

If it didn’t work out, he would really be sent to lay tiles.

… .

In Gu Qi’s room.

Gu Qi was still unconscious, her long eyelashes drooping. She looked extremely obedient and adorable, just like a little angel.

One of Qiao Nian’s hands was held by Gu Qi. From time to time, she would touch Gu Qi’s forehead with her other hand, paying attention to his temperature.

Fortunately, Gu Qi’s temperature had dropped.

Qiao Nian’s phone suddenly vibrated. She opened it and saw that it was a message from Doctor Li.

“Miss Qiao, the results of the appraisal are out. The sample Miss Jiang Yue brought is not related to that child by blood.”

When Qiao Nian saw this message, she was slightly stunned. She frowned, and her breathing became a little irregular.

So they really weren’t related by blood.

Although she had guessed this beforehand, she still felt very uncomfortable when she heard the results.

Her rationality told her that Gu Qi could not be her child.

But emotionally, she couldn’t help but treat Gu Qi as her child.

Sigh.

She had really missed her child so much that she had gone crazy. That was why she treated someone else’s child as her own.
