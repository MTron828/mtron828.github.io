Qiao Nian sat in the front passenger seat and turned to look out of the window. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The sun was shining brightly outside, and the lake water was sparkling. It shone into her heart. She recalled the dream just now. In the dream, her warm light was pulled out of the deep sea.

She retracted her gaze and looked at Gu Zhou beside her. Gu Zhou was sitting in the driver’s seat, driving seriously.

His eyes were as cold as ever, just like the people in the painting. They were delicious.

!!

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but swallow. The car stopped at the traffic light.

Caught off guard, she met Gu Zhou’s gaze.

Qiao Nian’s face turned slightly red. She hurriedly retracted her gaze, pretending to have inadvertently seen Gu Zhou.

“It’s normal to look at your husband!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

This person was too much!

What was so good about her gaze?

Gu Zhou noticed Qiao Nian’s embarrassed expression. This was the first time he had seen her like this. He couldn’t help but smile. “If you don’t think you can see clearly, why don’t we park the car at the side so that you can look at me properly?”

Qiao Nian kept staring ahead, ignoring Gu Zhou’s teasing. She said, “Alright, alright. The light has turned green. Get ready to drive.”

Seeing Qiao Nian’s red ears, Gu Zhou gradually retracted his gaze and continued driving.

The car drove forward for a while, then turned into a street.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She had bought the spicy duck neck here previously.

Ah!

At the mention of spicy duck neck, she couldn’t help but drool.

She was not a foodie, but in front of spicy duck neck, she had no resistance.

Gu Zhou turned to look at Qiao Nian. Seeing Qiao Nian staring ahead with starry eyes, he knew that he had come to the right place.

He liked to see a different side of Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian looked more vivid like this.

Qiao Nian was like an insatiable kitten, elegant and arrogant.

A few days ago, Qiao Nian had something on her mind, and her eyes were no longer as clear as usual. After that, they were dark and melancholic.

At that time, he still didn’t know what had caused Qiao Nian to become like this. Now, he was completely clear.

In the past, he had realized that Qiao Nian liked to eat this restaurant’s spicy duck neck. He had asked Chen Qing to instruct the boss to send spicy duck neck to the Gu family villa every day.

However, the good times did not last long. Gu Zhou heard that this spicy duck neck restaurant had closed.

Later on, he asked Chen Qing to buy duck neck from other shops. He had eaten it a few times, but the taste was never as good as this boss’s.

Today, Boss Li had reopened the spicy duck neck store, so he brought Qiao Nian over.

Gu Zhou stopped the car and whispered to Qiao Nian, “Wait for me in the car.”

Qiao Nian was a little dissatisfied with Gu Zhou’s slow movements. She hurriedly urged, “Hurry up, then.”

With that, Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly ahead, her mind filled with thoughts of eating spicy duck neck.

The moment Gu Zhou got out of the car, he instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

His appearance and the noble aura he exuded were completely different from everything around him, as if he shouldn’t have appeared here.

When men saw him, they marveled at his noble temperament.

When women saw him, they were completely impressed by his face. They wanted to kneel under his suit pants.

Qiao Nian saw Gu Zhou arrive at a porridge shop. Her lips curved up slightly.

“Wow, is this a domineering CEO coming to such a food street to buy food for his beloved wife?”

“That’s possible. This car seems to be especially expensive!”

“If only I were that wife!”

… .

In the car, Qiao Nian could vaguely hear their words. Her expression froze for a moment. Only then did she realize that Gu Zhou’s appearance here was indeed unusual.

After buying a bowl of porridge, Gu Zhou got into the car and handed it to Qiao Nian. He said gently, “Have some porridge first. Nourish your stomach.”

Qiao Nian took the porridge and was slightly stunned. When she thought of what the students had said just now, her heart warmed.

To be honest, other than what Gu Zhou had done wrong that night six years ago, he had treated her quite well.

When she was six years old, it was Gu Zhou who had risked his life to save her.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou. Only then did she realize that Gu Zhou had only bought a bowl of porridge. Puzzled, she asked, “What about you?”
