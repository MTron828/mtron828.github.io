Chapter 91: Poisoned

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Doctor Su lowered his head and stammered, “Matriarch Gu’s pulse… She seems to have been poisoned.”

Qiao Nian’s heart jumped to her throat.

Jiang Yue seemed to have been severely provoked by Doctor Su’s words. She immediately stepped forward and pushed Qiao Nian aside, looking at Doctor Su anxiously.

“Doctor Su, you just said that my grandmother only has a cold. How could she have been poisoned?” Jiang Yue asked, her words piercing the air like firecrackers.

Jiang Yue’s words echoed everyone’s thoughts.

At that moment, Doctor Su became even more afraid.

He had never seen anything like this in his twenty-odd years as a doctor. Matriarch Gu clearly only had a cold. Why did her pulse suddenly indicate symptoms of poisoning after she took some cold medicine?

He could not help but doubt himself. Had he misread her pulse?

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She had a nagging feeling that something was wrong.

Gu Zhou clenched his fists involuntarily. The veins on the back of his hands bulged in a sinister manner. He said coldly, “Purge the poison now!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

‘When Doctor Su heard Gu Zhou’s words, he grew even more afraid. He lowered his head like a child who had done something wrong.

“Speak!” Gu Zhou’s tone turned even colder.

“Tm afraid… I’m afraid there’s no hope lett..” Doctor Su mustered his courage and spoke.

Gu Zhou’s breathing faltered. His eyes were filled with coldness as he stared unblinkingly at Doctor Su.

At that moment, Zhao Qian passed out from the shock. Fortunately, a servant caught her in time. At the butler’s signal, the servant helped Zhao Qian out of the room.

Jiang Yue’s face was filled with pure shock. She staggered back, almost passing out, but managed to hold onto a cabinet for support just in time. Her mind was in a mess, and she only came back to her senses after a long while.

“Qiao Nian!” Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian as if she was the murderer. She said furiously, “It was you! You were the one who poisoned Grandma! You must have wanted to kill Grandma!”

Jiang Yue’s words made everyone in the room turn to look at Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened and his expression turned cold. Ignoring Jiang Yue’s words, he walked to Matriarch Gu’s bed and looked at her intently, his gaze tinged with sorrow.

Jiang Yue glanced at Gu Zhou from the corner of her eye. Seeing that Gu Zhou didn’t attack Qiao Nian, her mind raced.

Jiang Yue knew that this was the best time to bring Qiao Nian down.

Seeing Qiao Nian walk towards the bed, Jiang Yue quickly stepped forward to stop her.

“Qiao Nian, what exactly do you want?” Jiang Yue’s eyes were red, and her expression displeased. She began to fire accusations at Qiao Nian. If you didn’t give Grandma the medicine you made, why would Grandma have vomited blood and fainted?”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was staring fixedly at Matriarch Gu, Jiang Yue used her body to block Qiao Nian’s view. In tears, she questioned, “Just now, you also read Doctor Su’s prescription. There’s nothing wrong with his prescription. Now, Grandma is poisoned because of the poison in the medicine you gave her!

Grandma treats you like her own granddaughter. Why do you want to harm her?”

Jiang Yue’s forceful questions made everyone cast resentful gazes on Qiao Nian, pushing her to the forefront of the matter.

By now, Gu Zhou understood the situation. His dark eyes were fixed intently on Qiao Nian. No one could be sure if he believed Jiang Yue’s words.

The atmosphere in the entire room turned very tense.

Qiao Nian stood there calmly. She looked at Jiang Yue, as if she was holding back something, Her voice was cool as she said, “There’s nothing wrong with my medicine. As long as I take Grandma’s pulse, I’ll know why she was poisoned!”

Upon hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Doctor Su frowned and said without hesitation, “Second Young Madam, are you implying that I’m harming Matriarch Su? Or that my medical skills are not good enough?”

Qiao Nian gave Doctor Su an indifferent glance. Her medicine did not come into conflict with the medicine Doctor Su had just prescribed. Logically speaking, Matriarch Gu should not have vomited blood after taking both kinds of medicine.
