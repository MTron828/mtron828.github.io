1382 Finding the Truth

At the entrance of the emergency room.

Lu Qi walked over weakly, holding onto the IV stand. She asked worriedly, “Sister, how is Senior now? What did the doctor say?”

Qiao Nian quickly walked towards Lu Qi. Looking at Lu Qi’s pale face, she said softly, “Qi Qi, you’re still very weak. I’ll send you back to the ward. I’ll take care of Qin Chuan.”

Seeing that the lights in the operating theater were still on, tears welled up in Lu Qi’s eyes. Suppressing her tears, she looked at Qiao Nian. “Sister, I’m really fine. I want to stay here and watch over Senior.”

The others joined them.

Just as Lu Zhu was about to speak, he saw Lu Qi’s voice choking with emotion. “When the tunnel collapsed, Senior Brother drove to a corner and protected me in a triangle. After that, a stone hit the roof of the car, and Senior Brother protected me in his arms, so I was safe. But now, Senior Brother…”

Lu Qi’s tears blurred her vision. She turned her head slightly and raised her hand to wipe her tears. She was really useless. Other than crying, she could not help Senior Brother at all.

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian looked at each other. They did not expect Qin Chuan to risk his life to save Qi Qi.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that Qi Qi wouldn’t go back to rest. She helped Qi Qi to a chair and sat down. Smiling, she said, “Qi Qi, you don’t know this, but Qin Chuan and I played in the mountains when we were young. His skin is really thick. He’ll be fine even if he falls from a tree. Don’t worry, Qin Chuan will be fine.”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian carefully wiped Lu Qi’s tears with a tissue. “Be good. Don’t cry.”

Lu Qi nodded, her tears still falling uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian comforted Lu Qi softly. About ten minutes later, she saw that Lu Qi had calmed down. She asked softly, “Qi Qi, did you tell anyone that you were going to pay respects to your ancestors?”

Lu Qi lowered her head in disappointment. When she heard Qiao Nian’s words, her bright eyes were filled with confusion. She sensitively noticed that everyone was looking at her.

Lu Qi blinked in confusion, her mind racing. Fragments mixed together. Her expression suddenly changed, and she asked with red-rimmed eyes, “Sister, did those people blow up the tunnel because of me?”

Qiao Nian held Lu Qi’s hand tightly. Lu Qi had to face some things eventually. She nodded and said, “A person who knew that you were going to pay respects to your ancestors is very likely to leak this news to the killers.”

Qiao Nian told Lu Qi about the results of the police investigation. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s really because of me.” Lu Qi frowned in disbelief. She lowered her gaze and recalled that Qin Chuan had been seriously injured because of her. “Previously, I only told my family about me going to pay respects to my ancestors. My family is very good. How could there be a traitor among them? Is there a mistake?”

“Qi Qi.” Qiao Nian gently put her arm around Lu Qi’s shoulder and patted her comfortingly. She said gently, “One can’t judge a book by its cover. Actually, we don’t know who leaked it either, but we’re still investigating. Of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that they accidentally let it slip and others heard it. No matter what, we have to catch the person who wanted to harm you. Otherwise, they’ll harm our family next time.”

Lu Qi looked up and met Qiao Nian’s gentle eyes. Her gaze gradually hardened. She didn’t want her family to be hurt again. Those who did something wrong should be punished.

With this thought in mind, Lu Qi nodded solemnly.

“Yes, think hard. Who did you tell?” Qiao Nian coaxed in a low voice.

Lu Qi thought back to the day she found out that she was going to pay respects to her ancestors. She muttered softly, “That day, Senior Brother called me and said that he wanted to pay respects to his ancestors. I was choosing a gown with Sister Song Yu, so I told her.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, she recalled how Song Yu had treated her to a meal. She narrowed her eyes slightly. Could it really be Song Yu who had told her?

Song Yu?

When Lu Nian heard this name, his eyes instantly turned cold. His right hand in his pocket clenched into a fist, and his expression darkened.
