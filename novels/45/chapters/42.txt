Chapter 43: Taken Advantage

If she didn’t leave quickly to take a shower, she would probably end up like a cat in heat, just like Shen Xing.

“Hey, gorgeous, why are you leaving so fast?” Breaking into a small jog, the man caught up with Qiao Nian and grabbed her hand. He smiled as he said, “Don’t go! Come on, let’s have fun!”

Seeing that the man had moved closer again, Qiao Nian’s expression darkened. Without hesitation, she gave the man a punch, knocking him to the ground.

The man staggered to his feet. He stumbled twice before managing to stand.

Qiao Nian took out a silver needle. Without hesitation, she inserted it into the man’s neck, aiming for his laughter acupoint. She watched as the man sat there like a big fool, laughing non-stop. When she turned to leave, she was stopped by the onlookers who had crowded round.

They wanted to see who had the guts to target Gu Zhou’s date. When they saw Zheng He, they were no longer surprised.

Zheng He was a foreigner who had grown up overseas. Within his family, many were mercenaries, and every one of them was a ruffian.

Therefore, even though everyone was displeased with Zheng He, they didn’t dare to say anything. They just turned a blind eye.

Zheng He was laughing so hard that he’d wet himself. This was the first time he had been so humiliated. His tears flowed uncontrollably. He clearly wanted to cry, but he couldn’t help but laugh.

He glared at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over his face, but there was nothing he could do. Pulling the needle out of his body, he casually tossed it aside.

Gu Zhou had heard from Chen Qing that someone was harassing Qiao Nian. When he hurried over, he saw Zheng He looking humiliated. His gaze fell on Zheng He as he pulled out the needle.

Zheng He raised his sleeve to wipe his tears and glared in the direction Qiao Nian had left in. “If I catch you later and don’t manage to kill you, my name won’t be Zheng He!”

“Kill who?” Gu Zhou asked coldly. “I’d advise you to stop wetting yourself before you try to throw down any threats!”

Immediately, the onlookers began to laugh.

Zheng He’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. He immediately took out his phone and said arrogantly, “Brother, someone’s bullying me. Get a few brothers out here, quickly. I’m in the Shen family’s courtyard.”

Chen Qing frowned slightly and looked at Zheng He with a face full of worry. He moved closer to Gu Zhou and whispered, “Second Young Master, should we escort Madam out?”

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. Her face seemed to be extraordinarily flushed. “She should be able to handle this.”

Chen Qing looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. He felt that his Second Young Master had to be joking.

Zheng He looked at Qiao Nian and said coldly, “B*tch, just you wait. Even if I don’t kill you today, I will kick you out of Country Z. You’ll stay in hell forever!”

Matriarch Shen rushed over when she heard the commotion. Seeing that it was Qiao Nian who had caused the trouble, she frowned unhappily. However, she couldn’t really let anything happen to Qiao Nian here. Just as she was about to speak, she heard Qiao Nian’s voice.

“Don’t.” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and said, “If you can’t kill me today, I won’t consider you a man. Get out of Country Z and never come back. Stay in hell forever too!”

Wow.

This woman was too arrogant!

How dare she challenge the Zheng family!

She clearly overestimated her own abilities!

Although everyone felt that Qiao Nian was being arrogant, they sincerely hoped that Zheng He would leave Country Z.

At this point, Matriarch Shen shut her mouth. She felt that there was no need to speak anymore. She might as well watch Qiao Nian suffer the consequences. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Zheng He heard Qiao Nian’s words, he laughed out loud in anger. He retorted, “Is there something wrong with your brain, or are you just mentally retarded? What makes you think you can chase me out of Country Z?”

Qiao Nian could feel her body gradually heating up, but she didn’t want anyone to see that she was feeling uncomfortable. With a cold expression, she lowered her voice as much as possible. “I’m just repeating what you said.”

Zheng He looked at Qiao Nian’s gown with disdain. He retorted, “There are tons of people who rely on their bodies to make a living, like you. You’re just a piece of trash meant for other people to play with.. How dare you make a scene in front of me? Are you tired of living?”
