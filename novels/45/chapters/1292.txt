1293 Injured

Qiao Nian’s eyes instantly turned red. She watched as the blood on Gu Zhou’s hand stained her hand red, and her hand trembled.

She had been hiding in that room. The decoration of the movie building was not good, and she could hear the commotion downstairs clearly.

When she heard Qin Chuan’s voice, she came down with Xiao Bao. When she first came out, she saw the blood at the corner of Gu Zhou’s mouth from afar. At that time, she was stunned. She wanted to ask Gu Zhou about his condition immediately, but she was afraid of scaring Xiao Bao, so she could only put Xiao Bao in the car before looking for Gu Zhou.

“How do you feel now? You’re bleeding so much. Hurry up and treat it. Why aren’t you getting into the car? What’s there to say to someone like Kan Shan?” Qiao Nian’s voice trembled, and her nose felt sore. Tears welled up in her eyes.

“I’m fine.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. Sensing that her hand was cold, he frowned slightly. “Why are your hands so cold? Is it because you’re wearing too little?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she slowly closed her eyes, tears flowing down her face.

“Didn’t you say that you wouldn’t be injured?”

Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and gently patted her back. He comforted her gently, “Honey, I’m really fine. Don’t be afraid!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s voice, Qiao Nian couldn’t suppress the tears in her eyes at all. She pushed Gu Zhou away, but she was afraid that she would hurt him. She said tearfully, “Let’s go to the hospital now.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she felt a wet and hot touch on her forehead. Only then did she realize that Gu Zhou had kissed her forehead.

“I’ll protect you like this in the future. I won’t let you be hurt in any way again, let alone leave you alone.”

Gu Zhou’s soft murmur came from above her head. Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. Everything around her no longer seemed to matter. Gu Zhou was the only one left in her eyes.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, Gu Zhou pressed the back of her head and pulled her into his arms. “I…”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she tried to push Gu Zhou away. Gu Zhou’s hoarse voice came from above her head again. “I want to hug you for a while longer.”

“Nian’er.”

“Hm?”

“Don’t be afraid!”

“I’m not afraid anymore.”

Qiao Nian stood there quietly. Suddenly, Gu Zhou collapsed on top of her.

“Gu Zhou!”

“Gu Zhou!”

Qiao Nian called out three times in a row, but Gu Zhou still didn’t respond. Only then did she realize what Gu Zhou meant. He knew that he was going to faint and told her not to worry.

Qiao Nian hurriedly called Chen Qing over and said, “Chen Qing, let’s send him to the hospital quickly. By the way, arrange for a reliable person to send Xiao Bao to the hotel. Don’t let Xiao Bao see Gu Zhou like this. He’ll be afraid.”

“Yes, Young Madam,” Chen Qing agreed.

Qiao Nian and Chen Qing were about to help Gu Zhou into the car when Qiao Nian saw Xiao Bao standing not far away. Xiao Bao was staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed. She hurriedly asked Chen Qing to help Gu Zhou to the car and said softly, “Send Gu Zhou to the car first.”

“Yes,” Chen Qing replied.

Qiao Nian quickly walked up to Xiao Bao and squatted down. She looked at him gently and asked in a low voice, “Xiao Bao, didn’t Mommy ask you to be in the car?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xiao Bao watched with red-rimmed eyes as the car left with Kan Shan in it. He clenched his fists and pursed his lips tightly, not saying anything.

Seeing that Xiao Bao was staring at the car, Qiao Nian reached out to block his view. Seeing that he was looking at her, she took his hand. “Xiao Bao, go back to the hotel first, okay?”

Xiao Bao looked at Qiao Nian and asked softly, “Mommy, was the uncle who was just taken away Kan Shan?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. “Do you know Kan Shan?”

Although Qiao Nian didn’t answer Xiao Bao’s question directly, Xiao Bao already understood. There were tears in his eyes as he muttered, “No way.”

Qiao Nian noticed that something was wrong with Xiao Bao’s expression. She reached out and held his hand, saying gently, “Xiao Bao, what happened? Can you tell Mommy?”

Xiao Bao’s long eyelashes trembled like butterfly wings. He pursed his lips tightly, unwilling to speak.
