Chapter 402: Only You

When Qiao Nian heard Old Madam Gu’s words, she shook her head and said, “Grandma, this matter has nothing to do with you. She’s actually already an adult. She’s already capable of taking legal responsibility. You can’t blame yourself! for her mistakes”

When Old Madam Gu heard this, she was so touched that her eyes turned red. If Yue Yue could be so sensible, she wouldn’t have been chased out.

At the thought of Jiang Yue, Old Madam Gu’s heart ached again.

Actually, the reason why Qiao Nian was so determined to chase Jiang Yue out was mainly because Jiang Yue had once poisoned Old Madam Gu. She didn’t want Old Madam Gu to be hurt again.

Qiao Nian held Old Madam Gu’s hand tightly and comforted her softly. “Grandma, don’t worry. Don’t be sad anymore!”

When Old Madam Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded slightly. She looked at Qiao Nian, wanting to say something but hesitated.

Seeing Old Madam Gu’s expression, Qiao Nian knew that she had something to say. She smiled and asked, “Grandma, is there anything else you want to tell me?”

Old Madam Gu was slightly stunned. A trace of hesitation flashed across her eyes, but she still asked directly, “Nian Nian, do you know about stone gambling?”

Qiao Nian nodded. She just hadn’t expected Old Madam Gu to play this game too. “A little. Grandma, what’s wrong?”

Old Madam Gu heaved a sigh of relief and asked with a smile, “Have you heard of a necklace called the Moon Goddess?”

Qiao Nian nodded. Back when the Moon Goddess necklace had first appeared, she had also paid attention to it. However, she hadn’t been able to find it for a long time.

“Grandma, do you want this necklace?” Qiao Nian asked.

Old Madam Gu nodded and said, “I originally wanted Jiang Yue to help me get it, but now that I’ve already chased her out, it’s impossible for me to ask her to help again. I also wanted Zhao Qian to go, but she doesn’t know anything about stone gambling. I’m also afraid that she’ll be deceived! You also know that with Gu Zhou’s health, he won’t be able to go that far.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian immediately understood what Old Madam Gu meant. She smiled and said, “Grandma, perhaps I can try to find the necklace. However, do you know where it is?”

“In MY country. It’s a country where stone gambling culture is prevalent. And I heard from my friend that the Moon Goddess necklace is also there.”

Old Madam Gu paused for a moment before continuing, “The CEO of HH Group is preparing to hold a stone gambling banquet in MY country. The first prize winner will receive the Moon Goddess.”

Qiao Nian had heard of the famous CEO of HH Group before. He was obsessed with stone gambling.

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected the Moon Goddess to be in his hands.

Old Madam Gu’s frown deepened. She sighed and said, “That place is very messy. There are people from all walks of life. Initially, I didn’t want you to take the risk, but I really couldn’t find anyone to entrust it to…”

Old Madam Gu paused, her gaze landing on Qiao Nian’s face. With a serious expression, she said, “I only have you!”

“Don’t worry, Grandma. I’ll work hard to get you the moon goddess.”

Old Madam Gu heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “It just so happens that Lu Zhu is going there too. The two of you can go together so that you can take care of each other on the way.”

Qiao Nian recalled the first time she had seen Lu Zhu. Lu Zhu seemed to be a little dissatisfied with her. After a moment’s hesitation, she quickly said, “Grandma, actually, I can take care of myself…”

“Nian Nian, I know that you’re very outstanding and capable of taking care of yourself, but I’ll still worry about you if I let you go there alone.” Old Madam Gu held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and interrupted her gently.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and did not insist further.

When Qiao Nian arrived at the airport, her phone rang. She opened it and saw that it was a message from Gu Qi.

“Auntie, do you have time today? I want to pay you back what I owe you?”

When Qiao Nian saw this message, the corners of her lips curled up involuntarily. She immediately replied.
