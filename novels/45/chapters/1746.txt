Chapter 1747 - 1747 It's Not Like I Haven't Seen It Before

After Chen Qing left completely, only Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were left in the living room. The smile in Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually disappeared, and her eyes darkened.

Gu Zhou noticed Qiao Nian’s gaze and turned his head slightly to kiss her forehead. His voice was low, hoarse, and pleasant to the ears. “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Nian lowered her eyes, her long eyelashes covering her worried eyes. She pursed her lips slightly and said, “I didn’t expect things to go so smoothly. I can’t believe it’s true.”

Qiao Nian sighed and continued, “Our original plan was to discuss cooperation with the President and get him to stand on our side. From the beginning, he did not seem willing. Actually, I understand the President’s thoughts. He’s just worried that we’ll break the contract and Europe might fall into our hands.”

“But Lina’s words changed the President’s mind. In just an hour, we were able to work well with the President.” Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and said softly, “It’s very easy on our side, but it might be very difficult on their side.”

Gu Zhou’s fingers gently lifted Qiao Nian’s chin. He rubbed his thumb gently against Qiao Nian’s lips and asked in a low voice, “Are you worried about them because you think this mission is very difficult?”

Qiao Nian reached out and pushed Gu Zhou’s hand away.

“Or are you worried because of your Eldest Senior Brother?” Gu Zhou asked jealously.

Qiao Nian frowned unhappily. Just as she was about to speak, Gu Zhou lowered his head and kissed her lips.

She reached out to push Gu Zhou away, but Gu Zhou let go of her lips.

“You…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she heard Gu Zhou say in a low voice, “I’m a little tired.”

She thought about how Gu Zhou wasn’t in good health and was about to check on him. Unexpectedly, Gu Zhou kissed her collarbone densely.

“Stop fooling around. This is the living room.”

Qiao Nian said in a low voice.

Gu Zhou looked around and bent down to pick Qiao Nian up. He walked towards a bedroom. After entering the room, he did not forget to lock the door.

On the other side.

Lina finally arranged things and could not help but yawn.

She had not slept all night last night and was really sleepy now.

Via looked at Lina’s tired expression and helped her into the villa. She said softly, “Seventh Princess, it doesn’t matter if we go back later. Anyway, the villa is only half an hour away from Mark’s manor by car. You should rest early and recuperate. I’ll stand guard outside.”

They walked into a bedroom and Via made the bed.

Lina sat on the bed and felt sleepy. She quickly said, “Don’t guard me. The villa is very safe. Go to the next room and rest.”

After Via left, Lina went into the bathroom and wanted to take a shower before sleeping.

She was about to push open the door when she saw the bathroom door open from the inside.

Suddenly, a strong and powerful chest filled with water droplets appeared in front of her. She subconsciously looked up and saw that Chen Qing’s hair was still dripping with water.

His facial features were strong. Perhaps it was because he had just taken a shower, but he looked much gentler than usual.

Lina’s mind was instantly stunned. She looked at Chen Qing in front of her in disbelief. Her gaze gradually lowered before she noticed that Chen Qing was only wearing a towel around his lower body.

Lina looked at Chen Qing again and saw that his eyes were filled with confusion.

Chen Qing naturally wiped his hair with a towel and looked at Lina in confusion. “Seventh Princess?”

He did not understand why Lina would come to his room. He took a step forward. “Is something the matter?”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I’m fine.” Lina turned around with a red face and heartbeat. Her breathing began to speed up. She pursed her lips and tried to adjust her breathing.

Was she a fool?

Why did she have her back to Chen Qing?

She had clearly seen his body before.

She should take a few more glances this time. Otherwise, she might not be able to see it in the future.
Lina was too embarrassed to turn around and look at Chen Qing, afraid that Chen Qing would think that she was not reserved.

How should she explain herself to Chen Qing?

Lina frowned.
