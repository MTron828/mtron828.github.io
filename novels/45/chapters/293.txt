Chapter 294: Temptation

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze indifferently and gently twirled the pendant in his hand, as if he was thinking about something.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. She realized that Gu Zhou seemed to be in a daze. He didn’t seem to be in a good mood.

Qiao Nian recalled the look in Gu Zhou’s eyes when he saw the child just now. She hesitated for a moment, then pretended to ask casually, “Do you like children a lot?”

“I don’t.”

Gu Zhou answered without hesitation.

Qiao Nian was a little surprised by Gu Zhou’s answer. She had thought that Gu Zhou liked children. If Gu Zhou didn’t like children, why was he staring at the lady boss’s child?

Qiao Nian saw that Gu Zhou looked troubled.

Since Gu Zhou didn’t want to tell her, she wouldn’t ask further. The entire journey was quiet. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Half an hour later, they arrived home.

Qiao Nian picked up the duck neck excitedly, and forgot about her unhappiness.

The duck neck was simply a delicacy!

Qiao Nian had just walked into the living room when she eagerly took out the duck neck. In an instant, the spicy fragrance filled the entire living room.

Qiao Nian put on a pair of disposable gloves and hurriedly picked one up, placing it in her mouth.

The fragrant and numbing taste spread in her mouth. Qiao Nian couldn’t help but swallow. She picked up the cup Gu Zhou handed her and took a sip of water.

Spicy!

So spicy!

The familiar taste was simply too nostalgic.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, whose face was flushed red from the spiciness. There was a faint layer of mist in her eyes. He didn’t understand. If she couldn’t eat spicy food, why did she have to eat such spicy food?

“Thank you.” After Qiao Nian finished her drink, she put the cup aside and smiled at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou said, “Since it’s so spicy, don’t eat it!”

“This is what makes it delicious! You won’t understand!” With that, Qiao Nian moved on to the second duck neck.

This smell was simply irresistible.

Just by smelling it, Gu Zhou could tell that it was very spicy. He saw that Qiao Nian was still eating one after another. Her lips were a little red and swollen from the spiciness, as if they had been ravaged. He couldn’t help but want to ravage her again.

At this moment, Qiao Nian stuck out her tongue and gently licked her lips. Then, she opened her mouth slightly, making a panting sound.

Gu Zhou’s cold eyes narrowed slightly. His throat moved involuntarily, and his breathing became erratic. He wanted to kiss her hard!

Gu Zhou closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them again, his eyes were cold. He swiftly closed the food box and said coldly, “You’re not allowed to eat anymore!”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. She frowned slightly, resistance written all over her face. “Why?”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s red lips and for some reason, had the urge to bite them.

Gu Zhou looked away indifferently and said coldly, “Eating too much spicy food isn’t good for your stomach!”

“No, my stomach is fine. This little spice is nothing.” Qiao Nian shook her head and explained seriously, “Besides, I’m a doctor. I know how to take care of myself.”

Before Gu Zhou could speak, his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She said, “Just let me have a little more!”

Qiao Nian’s voice trailed off. Her voice was soft, giving off the impression that she was acting spoiled.

Actually, Qiao Nian wasn’t acting spoiled. The duck neck was simply too spicy, and her voice had changed as well.

“Isn’t it spicy?” Gu Zhou asked, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.
