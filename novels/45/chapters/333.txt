Chapter 334: Ambiguous

The young man in white carried her into a music room and placed her on the sofa, away from the piano. He said gently to her, “Second Brother will play the piano for you, okay?”

This voice was extremely gentle, and it warmed her heart.

Then, a familiar melody began to play.

This melody seemed to be played by Mr. Dong Hua, but it also didn’t seem to be. There was no trace of sadness in this song, only happiness and hope.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Was this really a dream?

For the first time, she could not distinguish between reality and a dream. Anxiety and panic welled up in her heart. She wanted to open her eyes and see the young man sitting beside the piano clearly, but she could only see his thin lips curving up slightly.

Qiao Nian instantly grew anxious. She felt her body move.

Suddenly, she smelled Gu Zhou’s unique scent.

Vaguely, she felt as if she was climbing the stairs. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Then, Qiao Nian seemed to hear the door open.

Then, she felt herself being placed on a comfortable bed. Only at this moment did she realize clearly that she was not dreaming.

Suddenly, Qiao Nian felt a burning glow on her face.

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race.

Why did he keep staring at her face?

Was it because there was something dirty on her face?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s body tensed up involuntarily.

In the next moment, Qiao Nian felt his hand land on her eyebrow, caressing it again and again.

The atmosphere was too strange. It made one feel uncomfortable.

His hand trailed down the bridge of her nose and finally landed on her lips.

The touch of his hand reminded Qiao Nian of that night five years ago…

For a moment, she felt that that person was exactly the same as him.

Qiao Nian’s heart jumped to her throat.

Qiao Nian could vaguely sense that he was getting closer and closer to her. His light breath landed on her face.

At this moment, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but open her eyes.

She raised her hand to push the person away, but the man was one step ahead of her. He pulled away from her.

Qiao Nian looked up and met Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes.

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly. He looked at Qiao Nian with interest and asked, “Are you no longer pretending?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

At this moment, Qiao Nian finally understood. The man had known for a long time that she was awake, so he had been teasing her.

Just now, she had thought that Gu Zhou was going to kiss her secretly, causing her to feel a little uneasy.

Qiao Nian sat up in bed and coughed lightly. She glanced around and realized that she was already home.

“How long have I been asleep?” Qiao Nian skipped the sensitive topic.

“About four hours.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she asked, “Then why didn’t you wake me up?”

“Is there anything important?” Gu Zhou asked.

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and continued, “No, I just slept for too long!”

Qiao Nian didn’t mind at all. Instead, she stretched lazily.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Gu Zhou suddenly felt that Qiao Nian looked like a cat.

Gu Zhou felt his mouth go dry. He looked away indifferently and handed Qiao Nian’s bag to her, saying calmly, “I think someone called you on WeChat just now!”

Qiao Nian took out her phone and saw several WeChat calls. She hurriedly turned on her phone. So it was Gu Qi.

She hurriedly typed a paragraph. “I’m sorry, Gu Qi. I was busy just now!”

Then, an exclamation mark appeared in her chat box. This meant that she had not sent the message. The other party might have blocked or deleted her.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

This child’s temper was too bad.

Seeing Qiao Nian frowning and typing non-stop, completely ignoring him, Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. “Is it a very important call?”
