1117 King of Stone Gambling

The girl frowned slightly and said unhappily, “Let go of me!”

Liang Sheng broke the girl’s hand mercilessly!

“Ah!” The girl screamed in pain. She covered her fingers and squatted on the ground, looking at Liang Tu in fear.

Tears welled up in the girl’s eyes. She looked at the man in the Maybach. He didn’t even glance at her.

She had thought that the man was just joking, but she did not expect him to be telling the truth.

Liang Tu got into the car, changed the door, and drove off!

The girl squatted on the spot, trembling. She looked at the car in surprise as tears of despair rolled down her face. She just wanted that handsome man’s WeChat. That handsome man was too cruel!

The onlookers were also shocked by Jiang Chi’s actions. This was the first time they had seen such a terrifying man. All of them stood rooted to the ground in a daze, not daring to step forward to help the girl whose hand had been broken.

At this moment, someone in the crowd suddenly shouted, “Oh my god, I remember now. That person is Jiang Chi!”

“Who’s Jiang Chi?”

“The king of stone gambling in MY!”

“Oh my god, he’s actually the king of stone gambling!”

“No wonder his aura is so terrifying!”

They recalled Jiang Chi’s appearance again and couldn’t help but shiver. Fortunately, they hadn’t hit on him just now. Otherwise, they would have been the ones who would have broken hands!

The Maybach gradually disappeared from their view. The airport returned to normal, but the girl, who had been squatting on the ground, cried until she was out of breath.

Jiang Chi sat in the Maybach and raised his wrist. He glanced at his watch. It was already half past one.

He hated being late the most!

Moreover, the person he was about to meet was very important to him. He didn’t want to leave a bad impression on her. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“How long until we get there?”

Liang Tu said, “Three minutes.”

Jiang Chi leaned back in his chair and slowly closed his eyes!

On the other side.

Qin Chuan was originally dealing with work. He wanted to end things here and go to MY to look for his grandfather as soon as possible.

At this moment, he suddenly received a WeChat message on his phone.

Qin Chuan casually opened WeChat. So his assistant had sent him a photo!

In the photo, Jiang Chi appeared in front of An City’s airport with a shy girl standing there.

Assistant: President Qin, Jiang Chi has already arrived in An City. He broke a girl’s hand at the airport!

Qin Chuan’s peach blossom eyes narrowed slightly, and he frowned.

Ever since Jiang Cheng died, Jiang Chi had said in the past that he would never step into An City again. Now that Jiang Chi had appeared in An City, could it be that there was something important in An City that Jiang Chi needed to do himself?

Qin Chuan recalled that Qiao Nian had previously said that Jiang Chi hoped that Qiao Nian could help him find the cause of Jiang Cheng’s death.

Could it be that Jiang Chi was here to look for Qiao Nian?

Qin Chuan frowned. He hurriedly took out his phone and called Qiao Nian.

—I’m sorry, the number you’ve dialed is unavailable. Please try again later!

He had to figure out why Jiang Chi had come to An City!

Qin Chuan stood up, took his jacket, and put it on. Then, he called his assistant!

“Help me investigate where Jiang Chi is preparing to go now.”

“Yes!”

Lu Qi stood in front of the cafe. After a moment’s hesitation, she walked in.

Before Lu Qi arrived, she had wanted to call Qiao Nian, but she had received a message from her sister. Her sister seemed to have gone straight to MY.

She felt that her sister must be especially tired after a night on the plane. She might still be resting and didn’t want to disturb her.

“Sister, Mr. Jiang, who posted those ten questions, came to An City today. I’m going to see him at the Venus Cafe now!”

After Lu Qi sent it, she even sent a smiling emoji!

She walked towards the cafe. The attendant immediately greeted her and told her the number of the private room.

“Miss, Mr. Jiang is already waiting for you!”

“Thank you. Please lead the way!” Lu Qi smiled. She was extremely excited. When she saw Mr. Jiang later, should she ask him to sign an autograph for her first?
