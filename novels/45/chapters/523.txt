Chapter 524: Men and Women Should Not Touch Each Other

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At this moment, Gu Zhou was no longer as cold and domineering as he usually was. He was like an obedient and adorable curious child, his face filled with curiosity.

Qiao Nian gave a gentle smile and explained to Gu Zhou seriously, “Zhou Zhou is a boy, and I’m a girl. Boys and girls can’t shower together!”

“Why can’t you shower with me if I’m a boy and you’re a girl?”

“Because men and women shouldn’t touch each other!” Qiao Nian tried her best to speak in a gentle voice.

“What do you mean by that? But we’re very close!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian thought for a while, then gave an easy answer. “This saying applies to two people of different genders. Usually, when you interact with each other, you have to keep a certain distance. You can’t be too close.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s face and seemed to understand something. He frowned slightly and asked suspiciously, “Nian Nian, are you saying this because you don’t want to sleep with Zhou Zhou?”

“Of course I’m not!”

He still didn’t seem to understand what Qiao Nian was talking about. He tilted his head slightly, looking confused. He asked again, “Then why isn’t Nian Nian willing to take a shower with Zhou Zhou?”

Qiao Nian had never taken care of a child before, and she didn’t have much patience. This time, when she heard Gu Zhou’s words, she said impatiently, “The books say that I can’t, so I can’t. There’s no need for so many questions!”

Gu Zhou was instantly stunned. He bit his lower lip aggrievedly, his eyes instantly filled with tears. “Nian Nian is fierce to me again!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with an aggrieved expression. He asked angrily, “Nian Nian, you said you wouldn’t be fierce to me. Why are you being fierce to me again?”

“I… I didn’t!”

“You just did!”

“I really didn’t!”

“But you clearly did!”

“I—”

“If Nian Nian doesn’t want to take a shower with Zhou Zhou, then don’t. Why must she be so fierce to Zhou Zhou? Hmph, Zhou Zhou will shower by himself!” Gu Zhou’s temper flared up. He looked at Qiao Nian unhappily, pouted, and began to unbutton his shirt.

After Gu Zhou finished speaking, he began to unbutton his shirt. He unbuttoned the first button of his shirt, revealing his exquisite and sexy collarbone. It connected with the line of his Adam’s apple and was very seductive.

He lowered his head and continued to unbutton the second button. His sexy and muscular chest was clearly visible.

Finally, he reached down and unbuttoned all the buttons on his shirt. He took off his shirt unhappily and threw it on the ground.

Qiao Nian looked at the sexy mermaid line on his stomach and felt her face heat up. His figure was simply too amazing!

Seeing that he was still reaching out to undo his belt, Qiao Nian blushed even more.

Although this man had Zhou Zhou’s personality, his body was still Gu Zhou’s! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This figure was not something ordinary people could compare to.

Qiao Nian turned around, her face flushed red. Her breathing involuntarily became heavier.

It was the first time she had felt so helpless.

How could she face an adult man with three personalities calmly?

She was going mad now!

Just as Qiao Nian was deep in thought, she heard the bathroom door close and the sound of water flowing.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief.

This evening was really about to kill her.

She felt extremely tired after being tortured by Gu Zhou. She took out her phone and quickly sent Chen Qing a message to tell him that she had already found Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian casually placed her phone on the bedside table and changed into her pajamas. She sat by the bed and thought about what had happened tonight.

She closed her eyes slightly, and Gu Zhou’s third personality appeared in her mind.

The gaze of Gu Zhou’s third personality was a little paranoid and even a little sickly. She recalled his last words and felt a chill on her back. She could not help but shiver.
