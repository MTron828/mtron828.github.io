893 Welcome Home

It was supposed to be night and it was very dark.

However, the courtyard of the Gu family villa was brightly lit.

There were many dancing cartoon dolls in the courtyard.

Beside the floor lamp were many colorful balloons. The balloons also had all kinds of cartoon characters and neon lights.

!!

The entire Gu family had become a fairy tale.

At this moment, with a swish, fireworks flew into the sky and exploded, spelling out the words “Welcome Home”.

After that, many fireworks exploded in the air one after another, illuminating the night sky.

A bright smile appeared on Xiao Shi’s face, and her eyes were filled with joy. Her pupils were filled with beautiful fireworks. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After the fireworks ended, a cheerful nursery rhyme played in the courtyard.

Qiao Nian walked in with the two children. Under her feet was a red carpet. She felt as if she had transmigrated to a fairy tale world. Her lips curved up involuntarily.

At this moment, Gu Zhou was wearing a black tuxedo and a top hat. He walked up to Xiao Shi and gave them an elegant greeting. Then, he took off his top hat and said gentlemanly, “Welcome home, my princess and prince!”

After Gu Zhou finished speaking, all the balloons in the courtyard flew into the night sky freely, and fireworks erupted again.

Xiao Shi’s face was red as she stared blankly at the fireworks in the sky.

In the past, when she was in Hai Cheng, she had seen fireworks in the rich district.

She felt that fireworks were the most beautiful thing in the world. At that time, she thought that when she grew up, she would buy many, many fireworks for Mommy to see. That way, Mommy would be very happy.

Later on, Grandma next door told her that fireworks were especially expensive. Some large fireworks could cost tens of thousands.

Tens of thousands?

How many games would she have to play to earn so much money?

However, now, the especially expensive fireworks seemed to be free. They bloomed in the night sky one after another, and the words “Welcome Home” were written on them.

Xiao Shi’s eyes watered.

Qiao Nian stood beside the two children. She looked up at the fireworks in the night sky, then at the sky full of balloons. Her maiden heart surged.

When the fireworks ended, Xiao Shi and Gu Qi threw themselves into Gu Zhou’s arms.

Xiao Shi’s lips curved into a bright smile. She looked at Gu Zhou with her wet eyes. It felt so good to have her father dote on her.

“Daddy!” Xiao Shi called out happily.

Gu Zhou squatted down and hugged Xiao Shi and Gu Qi. He looked at Xiao Shi gently. “Welcome home.”

Xiao Shi’s tears welled up in her eyes, and a warm current welled up in her heart.

She was extremely touched.

At this moment, she completely believed Auntie Nian Nian’s words.

So those who really liked her and doted on her would not let her be hurt at all.

Tonight, she would go home and feel her father’s love for her.

She had never even dared to dream of such a happy life in the past.

Seeing the three of them hugging, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh.

She finally understood why the doctor had said that Xiao Shi could be discharged early. Gu Zhou had said that there was an urgent matter. As he made a call, he walked out.

At that time, she believed that Gu Zhou really had something urgent to do, so she hadn’t thought too much about it.

Now, it seemed that Gu Zhou was just preparing to welcome Xiao Shi home early.

Gu Zhou really wanted Xiao Shi to become the princess of the Gu family.

In the past, no matter what she did, Xiao Shi had to listen to others. Moreover, she had to take care of others.

But Xiao Shi’s life was different now.

She was the eldest daughter of the Gu family.

She could be as innocent as a child. Besides, she should have lived a happy life like a little princess.

She hoped that she would grow up with sweet love and be able to forget the unhappiness of the past and live a happy life.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou was wearing a tuxedo. Under the spotlight, he looked like a high and mighty prince.

Qiao Nian still remembered what Gu Qi had told her previously.

At that time, Gu Qi had always felt that his father was very busy and did not come home at all, so he did not care about him.
