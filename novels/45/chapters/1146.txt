Lu Nian actually had his own selfish motives. Actually, when he found out that his sister was still alive, after their analysis, it was indeed good for his sister to hide her identity. Secondly, he only wanted to dote on his sister alone.

Su Yan looked at Lu Nian in disbelief. Lu Nian was usually the most obedient and would never lie.

Lu Rao placed his hands behind his head and leaned back lazily in his chair. He said, “Mom, actually, other than Fourth Brother and Escape Lu, Big Brother and Second Brother know about this. If I remember correctly, the family law punishment is sixty hits. The three of us will each take twenty hits!”

Lu Rao had always trained his body and was not afraid of being beaten up at all. He was a thick-skinned young hunk!

Su Yan breathed heavily. She was really furious. “You’re really good at planning!”

“Mom, I’m not wrong either. You should praise the three of us for having a good relationship. Didn’t you teach us since we were young that we should go through thick and thin together? I learned what you taught me perfectly!” Lu Rao said with a smile, as if he was not afraid of being beaten up at all.

“I’ll definitely break your mouth first!” Su Yan’s eyes were filled with anger. Although Lu Qi didn’t want to be severely punished, every time something happened, she would think of helping her brothers reduce the punishment. She said, “Mom, I heard that a young lady is wooing Third Brother. If you break his mouth, what if she doesn’t want Third Brother anymore? Why don’t you hit his butt!”

When Lu Rao heard Lu Qi’s words, he silently gave Lu Qi a thumbs up.

Escape Lu was still a little like a biological sister.

Su Yan glanced at Lu Qi. After some thought, she said, “That makes sense. It won’t be good if we scare that young lady…”

None of her four sons had found a girlfriend!

Lu Rao was speechless.

The others were also stunned. This was the first time they had seen their mother so easy to talk to.

Su Yan was originally very angry, but when she thought about how her sons still had to find a wife, she was a little less angry. She thought about how to punish them. Not only would she teach them a lesson, but she would also not let them damage their reputation. He would still be able to seduce a few young ladies!

Qiao Nian hurriedly explained, “Mom, actually, you can’t blame our brothers for this. This matter is a little complicated. The reason why our brothers did that was to protect me.”

“How is that for your own good?” Su Yan’s anger surged. She glared fiercely at her unreliable sons and said, “Don’t be fooled by them.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“No, Mom. Actually, I’ve already acknowledged my ancestors,” Qiao Nian said sincerely.

Su Yan’s anger shot into outer space like a rocket. She glared fiercely at her three sons. “You… you’re really bold. Your wings have hardened. You actually hid such an important thing from me!”

For the first time, Qiao Nian realized that she was a loose tongue. No matter how she explained, the more Su Yan listened, the angrier she became. She hurriedly picked up a piece of meat for Su Yan and said, “Mom, actually, this matter is very complicated. More than twenty years ago, I should have died, but by chance, I survived. If I returned to the Lu family like this, those people might think of other ways to deal with me. At that time, I thought that that would be too dangerous, so I suggested hiding my identity!”

When Su Yan heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes grew redder and redder. She looked at Qiao Nian with heartache.

Qiao Nian continued, “I’m not sure if those people really want me to die, but the only thing I’m sure of is that the three kidnappers who were killed back then were just sacrificial lambs or scapegoats pushed out by those people. The real kidnappers are still in the dark. My brothers only agreed to my suggestion because they wanted to protect my safety. Don’t be angry.”

Qiao Nian made it very clear. Seeing the anger on Su Yan’s face gradually dissipate, she said, “Mom, I was really afraid that everyone wouldn’t be able to pretend that I was still dead. I was afraid that I would alert the enemy, so I didn’t tell you. Don’t be angry.”

“Sugar, you’ve really suffered.” Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian with heartache.

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said coquettishly, “Later on, we realized that the other party had long known that I was still alive. My brothers asked me to acknowledge my ancestors. However, you were overseas at that time and I wanted to meet Mom face to face, so I didn’t ask my brothers to call you.. Mom, don’t be angry and don’t hit my brothers, okay?”
