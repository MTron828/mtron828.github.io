878 Don’t Look

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man. Before she could react, Song Man pushed her away with all her might.

Gu Zhou was the first to rush to the window. He hugged Xiao Shi and shielded her in his arms.

When Qiao Nian ran to the window, she saw Song Man falling.

“Mommy!” Xiao Shi struggled to find Song Man.

!!

At this moment, Song Man was about to land on the ground.

Qiao Nian hurriedly covered Xiao Shi’s eyes with her hand and said softly, “You’re still young. Don’t look!”

Before Qiao Nian covered her eyes, she still saw Song Man fall to the ground in a sorry state.

Tears fell uncontrollably. Xiao Shi cried until her body trembled.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi in front of her, her heart aching terribly. Xiao Shi was just a child, but she had received so much information in one day. She even had to accept the death of the mommy who had raised her for five years.

She regretted it.

Actually, they knew that Song Man was not the mother of the child. So what?

They could just treat Song Man as an idle person. Anyway, what they lacked the most was not money.

Why did they have to force Song Man to her death? That way, Xiao Shi would live in discomfort for the rest of her life.

However, on second thought, it was fortunate that Song Man had told the truth before she died. Otherwise, Xiao Shi might have lived a life filled with hatred for her and Gu Zhou for the rest of her life. It was them who had appeared and forced Song Man to death.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi’s pitiful expression and sighed helplessly. She had to treat Xiao Shi well in the future to make up for the hurt in her heart.

There was a commotion downstairs, and not long after, the sound of a police car.

Xiao Shi laid in Gu Zhou’s arms and cried until she was out of breath. Whenever she thought of how Song Man had held her hand gently just now, she could not stop her tears.

Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi in his arms with heartache. He shielded her in his arms and carried her back to the bed.

At this moment, Qiao Nian let go of Xiao Shi’s eyes. Looking at Xiao Shi’s pale face, she frowned slightly.

It was a mess below. There were all kinds of sounds. Chen Qing hurriedly closed the window, blocking out the sounds, as if the soul-stirring incident had never happened.

Xiao Shi cried silently, her tears falling like rain.

Gu Zhou’s lips moved to Xiao Shi’s forehead and he gently kissed it. He said guiltily, “Xiao Shi, I’m really sorry. Daddy has been absent for so many years and hasn’t been able to take good care of you. Daddy will definitely take good care of you in the future.”

Xiao Shi did not speak. Tears welled up in her eyes, and her eyes were filled with sorrow.

Seeing Xiao Shi like this, Qiao Nian gently tucked her hair behind her ear and said softly, “If you really feel too uncomfortable, then cry. Just cry!”

However, Xiao Shi could not listen to what others were saying at all. Her mind was filled with bits and pieces of her interactions with Song Man.

In her heart, Song Man was the person closest to her. She had always only had eyes for Song Man.

Although she knew that Song Man had a bad temper and that she was missing an arm, she still loved her very much. Song Man was her entire world.

However, Xiao Shi could not believe that Song Man was just using her and had never liked her.

If Song Man really hated her, why didn’t she pull her along when she died? Instead, she pushed her back to the ward and let her live?

Xiao Shi’s eyes were filled with tears. She knew that Song Man liked her, even if she refused to admit it.

She missed Song Man very, very much…

Gu Zhou still wanted to comfort Xiao Shi, but he realized that she had fainted. He panicked. “Xiao Shi!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’ll call the doctor!” As Chen Qing spoke, he walked out anxiously.

“Let me take a look. Put Xiao Shi on the bed first.” Qiao Nian hurriedly helped Gu Zhou place Xiao Shi on the bed.

Chen Qing stopped in his tracks. He was so concerned that he had forgotten that Young Madam was a doctor.

Xiao Shi was placed on the hospital bed. Qiao Nian carefully examined Xiao Shi’s body before saying, “Xiao Shi had just fainted from sadness. Let her rest well. She’ll be fine soon!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief. His heart ached as he looked at Xiao Shi on the bed.
