Chapter 128: Rather Destroy It Than Let It Fall Into Your Hands

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Su Yan heard Song Hua’s words, he couldn’t help but frown. After some thought, he realized that that was indeed the case.

Qiao Xin knew that Song Hua was giving her an out. The only thing she could do was to step out and say pitifully, “Sister, I’m sorry. I didn’t do it on purpose.”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew even brighter. She said disdainfully, “You say that you didn’t do it on purpose. If it really wasn’t on purpose, you wouldn’t have asked Mr. Song to vouch for you!”

Qiao Xin swayed on the spot. This time round, her reputation was truly in tatters. Being young, she couldn’t help but burst into tears again.

At this moment, everyone who had spoken up for her previously looked at Qiao Xin from a distance, without a trace of sympathy or pity in their eyes.

Qiao Nian looked meaningfully at Qiao Xin and said, “Qiao Xin, I’d already given you a chance. I told you to think carefully about whether you could afford to keep my Suranne Grass around.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Tears continued rolling down Qiao Xin’s cheeks. Her hands trembled as she took out the key to the display cabinet containing the Suranne Grass. Handing the key to Qiao Nian, she begged pitifully, “Sister, it’s all my fault. I just wanted Brother Su

Yan to clinch this partnership. Now, I know that what I did was wrong. I won’t do it again. Can I return the Suranne Grass to you? Please, please don’t tell anyone about this, otherwise I...”

“You’ve already dirtied the Suranne Grass by handling it. I don’t want anything you’ve touched!” Taking a step back, Qiao Nian retorted coldly.

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of cunning flashed in her eyes.

Although she had humiliated herself in front of everyone, she could still make a lot of money by selling this pot of Suranne Grass on the market.

But Qiao Xin had never expected Qiao Nian to take the key from her hands, open the display cabinet, and take out the pot of Suranne Grass.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. Didn’t Qiao Nian think that this pot of Suranne Grass was dirty? Why would she take it out?

Just as everyone was feeling puzzled, they saw Qiao Nian raise the pot of Suranne Grass high up in the air and smash it viciously onto the ground.

The sound of the ceramic pot shattering resounded throughout the hall.

Everyone watched as the broken ceramic shards cut through the roots of the

Suranne Grass. From the roots, the Suranne Grass began to gradually wither until it turned completely black. Its life-force had completely disappeared.

Qiao Xin felt as if a knife had been stabbed viciously into her chest. It was as if her heart was dripping with blood. She couldn’t breathe.

Tens of millions were gone just like that.

Not only was she utterly humiliated today, but she had also lost tens of millions!

When the onlookers saw this, they were all stunned.

Oh my god!

Qiao Nian had actually ruined that pot of Suranne Grass. But that was Suranne Grass! It was worth tens of millions!

Qiao Nian took out a tissue and gently wiped the dust off her hands. She said impassively, “Since this is something I don’t want, there’s no need to keep it

around any longer!”

Seeing this, the others were practically in tears. Qiao Nian’s personality was simply too powerful.

Su Yan and Qiao Xin were now both looking extremely grim.

Song Hua felt as if Qiao Nian had given him a vicious slap in the face. He didn’t dare to say anything more. Reaching into his pocket for his phone, he pretended that he had to take a call, and left the room quickly.

Now, Song Hua’s image among the crowd had been severely tarnished.

Lin Tao walked over to Qiao Nian. She gave Qiao Xin and Su Yan a vicious glare, then took Qiao Nian’s arm, smiling. “Nian Nian, do come over and comfort my father. I’m a little worried that he might have a heart attack!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Director Lin. Her smile was warm and bright. “Uncle Lin, if you hadn’t taught me how to cultivate plants in the past, I wouldn’t have been able to cultivate so much Suranne Grass and Moonlight Grass. For your opening ceremony today, I thought that you might be missing some plants and flowers, so I moved some over.’

“Plants and flowers?” Director Lin felt like his heart was about to jump out of his chest.

In a moment, Director Lin recalled that Qiao Nian had just offered to work with him. Her only request was to grow the plants and flowers she liked.

Several acres of valuable plants...

When the onlookers thought of this, they nearly suffocated.

Qiao Nian’s gaze lingered on Su Yan’s face for a moment, then she smiled at

Director Lin. “Uncle Lin, what do you think of using that piece of land to cultivate these plants?”

None of the other people who wanted to work with the Director dared to speak up, because they were completely certain that Director Lin would decide to work with Qiao Nian.

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian with envy. It seemed that Qiao Nian was going to be the new director of the research institute..
