Chapter 346: Illegitimate Child

How was this possible?

Gu Zhou could only send another friend request.

But there was no response from the other end.

Gu Zhou looked up at Chen Qing’s face and said, “Chen Qing, take a look. Did Gu Qi delete you from his WeChat?”

Chen Qing hurriedly followed Gu Zhou’s instructions and sent an emoji. It was followed by a red exclamation mark.

“Deleted.”

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, his heart sank.

“Second Master, do you think Young Master deleted us on WeChat because he didn’t want to talk to us?”

“No.” Gu Zhou pondered for a moment and frowned. “I suspect that something has happened to him in school!”

“I’ll go take a look at the school immediately!” Chen Qing said as he walked out.

Gu Zhou felt uneasy. He stopped Chen Qing and said, “I’ll go with you.”

With that, Gu Zhou picked up his suit jacket and walked out.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Chen Qing felt that Young Master was becoming more and more concerned about his child.

When the two of them went downstairs, they saw Qiao Nian walking in.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s hand, which was holding an empty folder.

Qiao Nian saw that Gu Zhou’s expression was serious, as if he had something especially important to settle.

She seemed to remember Gu Zhou looking like this every time he went out.

Gu Zhou hadn’t seen Qiao Nian for the entire morning. Thinking that Qiao Nian had gone to prepare the items needed for the auction, he asked, “Have you prepared the items for the auction tonight?”

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said, “Everything is ready. Don’t worry!”

“Yes.”

Gu Zhou nodded lightly and brushed past Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s back in confusion. After a while, she looked away and took out her phone to make a call.

As Qiao Nian made the call, she walked towards her room. “Chief Wang, I’d like to send a document over. Are you in the office now?”

“I’m here.”

When Qiao Nian heard Chief Wang’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. When she recalled what had happened to her, she couldn’t help but ask, “Chief Wang, I would like to ask if there have been any developments in my background check?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Qiao Nian heard Section Chief Wang sigh.

“Xiao Qiao, there have been many people looking for relatives who match your parents’ ages. I’ve compared their DNA with yours. None of you match. We have to let nature take its course.”

A trace of disappointment flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She thanked him politely and hung up.

After hanging up, Qiao Nian’s eyes darkened. Disappointment welled up in her heart.

In that case, her parents had never thought of looking for her. She could only hope that Gu Qi’s mother would not be like this.

Qiao Nian sighed heavily and turned to walk downstairs.

Jiang Yue walked out from a corner and looked thoughtfully at Qiao Nian’s retreating back.

Her eyes had always been very good. If she wasn’t wrong, the folder contained a child’s nails!

Jiang Yue recalled what Qiao Nian had said on the phone just now.

Could it be…

Was Qiao Nian going to do a paternity test?

At the thought of this, Jiang Yue’s eyes widened uncontrollably.

Could Qiao Nian also have an illegitimate child?

Oh my god?

Qiao Nian and Brother Ah Zhou each had an illegitimate child?

If that was the case, the two of them would definitely not be able to continue on.

A smug smile appeared on Jiang Yue’s face.

An City Prison.

Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin stood outside, waiting.

Qiao Xin had been very well-behaved during this period of time. All she could think about was how soon her father would be released from prison. Then, her father would reconcile with her mother, and their family would be able to be together.

During this period of time, the Qiao family’s business had suffered many crises. The Qiao family’s share price had also plummeted. Qiao Yu had spent a lot of effort to barely stabilize the share price.

“Qiao Yu, Qiao Xin.”

A meek female voice rang out.

Su Xue stood there timidly.
