Chapter 157 Quibbling

Mr. S was far inferior to Elena!

Jiang Yue breathed in carefully. She did not dare to make any big movements now. Her face was livid as she looked at the alluring gowns. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

She really hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to have the ability to get Elena to design a gown for her.

Liu Yu’s face turned pale, but she still wouldn’t believe that these dresses were designed by Elena. She said relentlessly, “Words are useless. Perhaps you’re lying?”

“Yes, I heard that Elena only makes clothes for the royal family. I’ve never heard of her designing clothes for socialites in this country.”

“That’s right, that’s right. Although we’ve never interacted with Elena, we all know her preferences.”

At this moment, a young lady walked out of the crowd. Her gaze fell on the onlookers and she said, “This lady is right. Stop talking. None of you know anything, and you’re just spouting nonsense! This is really very embarrassing!” This girl looked especially young. She seemed to be a freshman.

She hadn’t wanted to step forward initially, but seeing how those people began to slander Qiao Nian without distinguishing between right and wrong, she couldn’t hold back any longer. Taking out her phone, she walked to a gown and scanned the QR code there before saying, “All the dresses designed by Elena are marked. Just scan it and you’ll know if it’s real. Look, this is an authentic product, and an original design by Elena!”

The girl showed the page on her phone to everyone. The dress code and certificate were displayed.

Those who had mocked Qiao Nian for getting people to send over fake gowns were all so embarrassed that they yearned to find a hole to hide in.

Liu Yu stepped forward, unwilling to go down without a fight. She scanned the codes on the remaining nine dresses. All of them were authentic. Her breathing quickened, and her face turned red with embarrassment. Tears welled up in her eyes.

She was so angry that she began to cry!

How was this possible? Qiao Nian was clearly a lunatic. How could she be wearing a gown designed by Elena?

Apart from designing clothes for the royal family, Elena only designed clothes for people she liked. Moreover, she would investigate that person’s character. If her character was not up to standard, she would not design clothes for that person either.

Jiang Yue’s expression was the darkest. She bit her lip. She had always wanted to own a gown designed by Elena, but she had never expected Qiao Nian to be one step ahead of her.

At this moment, Jiang Yue seemed to hear the sound of fabric tearing.

Jiang Yue was so anxious that her entire body was flushed red. She hurriedly held her breath, trying hard to suck in her stomach. This was the first time she had been in such a sorry state.

At this moment, Jiang Yue’s mind was still very clear.

Although Grandma was getting on in years, every time Grandma made a gown for her, she would never make a mistake in her size.

Yet this gown did not seem to be her size.

Could it be that this gown was really made for Qiao Nian?

No. It couldn’t be true!

Grandma knew that she liked diamonds the most. Why would she give her favorite diamond to an outsider?

Liu Yu wiped her tears away and glared at Qiao Nian angrily, still unconvinced. “There’s something wrong with Qiao Nian’s character. Girls, you should tell designer Elena that she…” From the corner of her eye, Jiang Yue saw Gu Zhou walking over. Carefully, she walked to Liu Yu’s side and said in a low voice, “Alright, stop.”

“Yueyue, you…”

Sucking in her stomach, Jiang Yue tried hard to maintain a smile on her face. She said reasonably, “Sister Nian Nian is a guest of our family. Although Sister Nian Nian and I had a misunderstanding previously, the lecture will begin in a while. Let’s not make a scene over such a small matter.”

Jiang Yue’s voice was as gentle as ever. Her words were logical and made perfect sense.

The onlookers felt that Jiang Yue was right. Hence, they didn’t say anything else. Although Qiao Nian could wear a gown made by Elena this time, that didn’t mean that Qiao Nian would have a chance to continue doing so in the future.

Liu Yu glared daggers at Qiao Nian. If looks could kill, Qiao Nian would have died a thousand times over.
