Chapter 187: Paternity Test

Not only that, Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin would also be criticized relentlessly. They would never be able to hold their heads high again.

At the thought of this, Su Xue broke down in tears. She cursed, “Qiao Nian, you…”

Before Su Xue could finish speaking, she sensed the coldness around her. Her gaze inadvertently fell on Gu Zhou’s face. When she met Gu Zhou’s icy gaze, she immediately swallowed her words.

Su Xue was so angry that she was panting heavily. With a cold expression, she questioned, “Qiao Nian, do you have no sense? If you call the police, you’ll only bring shame to the Qiao family!”

Qiao Shan was so angry that he could barely feel anything. If murder wasn’t illegal, he would have shot that b*tch, Su Xue, dead.

Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue in confusion. She asked languidly, “Before you did this, why didn’t you think that you would bring shame to the Qiao family?”

Qiao Nian sighed slightly and looked at Qiao Xin with a pained expression. She said softly, “Brother has already begun to take over the Qiao family’s business. I don’t think anyone will dare to say anything in front of him, nor gossip behind his back. I’ve already married into the Gu family, so I don’t think anyone will dare to spout nonsense about me either. However, I pity Qiao Xin. She’s still a student. If her schoolmates in An University find out about this, how will Qiao Xin deal with those gossip mongers in school? Even if she manages to graduate, people will still talk behind her back when she goes out to look for a job. People will say that she has a mother who doesn’t know her place and who cheats on her husband.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment, then continued, “In the future, when Qiao Xin gets married, the groom-to-be and his family are sure to be hesitant. They might be worried that Qiao Xin would do something like her mother, something that will bring shame to the family!”

Qiao Xin couldn’t help it. With a shriek, she burst into tears.

Su Xue’s face was bright red with anger. She questioned furiously, “Qiao Nian, do you have a conscience? How dare you call the police? Qiao Xin is your biological sister, and I’m your mother. How can you be so heartless as to ruin your sister’s life, and mine?”

Qiao Nian glared at Su Xue coldly, a trace of anger flashing in her eyes. She gripped the dagger in her hand tightly. “Shut up!”

Su Xue was startled by the cold aura Qiao Nian was exuding.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes and spoke icily, “I’ll cut off your tongue if you dare to call yourself my mother one more time!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

All Su Xue could think about right now was finding a scapegoat, so the blame on her would lessen. Hence, she tried to place all the blame on Qiao Nian. She said fearlessly, “What did I say wrong?”

Qiao Nian snorted. Su Xue was truly a stubborn mule of a person. She took out a folder she had stuffed into her bag and flung the results of the paternity test at Su Xue’s face.

Fuming with rage, Su Xue opened the folder. When she saw the contents, her eyes widened in disbelief. “How… How could you do a paternity test?”

A trace of shock flashed across Qiao Shan’s face.

Looking down at Su Xue with condescension, Qiao Nian enunciated each word clearly as she spoke. “If you don’t want to go to jail, sure. In that case, tell me who my biological parents are.”

As soon as Qiao Nian said this, everyone in the Qiao family was stunned.

Walking up to Su Xue, Qiao Shan forcefully took the paternity test from her. When he saw the results, his expression changed. He turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked in confusion, “How did you suspect that you’re not our biological daughter?”

Qiao Nian found Qiao Shan’s words especially amusing. She asked sarcastically, “You’ve made it so obvious. How can anyone not be suspicious?”

Qiao Shan’s expression darkened as he recalled what had happened in the past.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She really hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so clever.

In fact, Qiao Xin had also thought of chasing Qiao Nian out of the house in the past, just so she could look forward to seeing Qiao Nian beg for mercy on her knees.

However, Qiao Xin had never expected Qiao Nian to discover the secret of her birth.

“Sister…”

“Shut up.” Qiao Nian interrupted Qiao Xin coldly, her expression filled with disgust. “I’m not your sister. I’m not related to you by blood at all. I’m not even remotely related to the Qiao family. Moreover, no mother of mine is such a shameless, disgusting person.”
