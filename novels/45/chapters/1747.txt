Chapter 1748 - 1748 You Are Very Outstanding

Lina’s heart was beating so violently that it was about to jump out of her throat.

She turned around with the force of that hand and saw Chen Qing looking at her injured right hand with a focused and heartbroken expression.

The hot temperature of his hand spread throughout her body. She felt hot and stood rooted to the ground in a daze.

“You’re very afraid of pain. You even bit my hand when you were injured previously.”

Chen Qing’s words pulled Lina back to her senses. When she thought of what the two of them had experienced before, her violently beating heart slowly calmed down, and sadness surged in her heart.

Lina pursed her lips and said calmly, “I was too weak in the past, but now, I’m no longer afraid of these things.”

People had to grow up. No one could always protect themselves.

Lina took a deep breath. She still had many things to do. She could not stay attached to love forever.

With this thought in mind, Lina was about to retract her hand.

However, Chen Qing held Lina’s hand very tightly. He was worried that he would hurt Lina’s hand, so he simply held her wrist and gently held her hand with his other hand.

Lina looked up at Chen Qing. Chen Qing’s eyes were lowered, and his eyelashes covered his eyes. She could not see his eyes clearly. She tilted her head to the side and said softly, “I…”

Chen Qing said, “Actually, you don’t have to be like Young Madam.”

Lina’s body stiffened involuntarily. When she looked at Chen Qing again, she met that gentle gaze with determination.

Chen Qing looked at Lina and said seriously, “The Second Young Madam is indeed not an ordinary girl. I respect her very much. However, your original appearance is even cuter. You’re pure and understanding. You always look at everyone with a gentle gaze. You’re willing to sacrifice yourself to protect others in the face of big matters. You’re very outstanding.”

Lina looked at Chen Qing intently. She had always felt that she was weak and easy to bully, so she wanted to become like Nian Nian.

However, the person she loved praised her so much in front of her. Her heart rippled. She did not expect him to say that about her.

Lina’s eyes involuntarily turned red. Thinking of what had happened before, she lost her confidence. Her voice was slightly low as she said, “Actually, I know you’re comforting me. I…”

“I’m not comforting you.” Chen Qing shook his head gently and looked into Lina’s eyes firmly. “I’m speaking from the bottom of my heart. You’re like this in my eyes. The person you cherish are very lucky. I also…”

I also want to be the person you really love.

However, Chen Qing did not say this.

Tears welled up in Lina’s eyes. She looked up at Chen Qing in front of her. She had a lot to say to Chen Qing, but she could not say anything. In the end, she sighed helplessly.

She slowly lowered her eyes and asked softly, “Why didn’t you say so before?”

She tried to test him so many times before, but he always disappointed her.

He was like a stone, cold and without any warmth.

What was the point of him telling her so much now? They were about to miss their chance together.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lina sensed that Chen Qing’s grip had loosened, and she slowly retracted her hand.

Chen Qing’s hands were empty, and his heart was also empty. He lowered his eyes and said in a low voice, “I was sent for training when I was young. I only had one goal, and that was to protect Second Young Master and take care of him. I’ve never known how to express my thoughts. I…”

Chen Qing frowned slightly. He had always prioritized Second Young Master. As for other matters, they had nothing to do with him.

He had never understood what his feelings for Lina were. He thought about it for a long time before reacting.

He liked her.

However, he reacted too slowly. By then, it was too late.

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s words, she looked up at him, her eyes filled with heartache.

The two of them were very similar. They had been thinking for the others and had not thought about their needs at all. Neither of them had thought about themselves.

People like them needed to be loved.
