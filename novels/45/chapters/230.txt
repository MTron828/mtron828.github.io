Chapter 231: Little Lan

“Grandma believes that in your hands, this violin will shine again!” Matriarch Gu said dotingly.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with fondness. Touched, she said happily, “Grandma, thank you.”

“I’m your grandmother. Why are you being so polite?” Matriarch Gu said with a smile. “Alright, you must be exhausted after a day of school. Go back and rest!”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian nodded. She placed the violin in the violin case and walked out with it. She couldn’t wait to try out this violin.

Qiao Nian walked to the bedroom door and turned back to look at Matriarch Gu. The lights in the room reflected off her sparkling fox-like eyes, making her look sincere and gentle.

“Grandma, when I’m familiar with the violin, I’ll play it for you.”

The smile on Matriarch Gu’s face grew even more benevolent. She nodded gently and said, “Alright, go!”

She liked Nian Nian. Nian Nian had always kept her in her heart. Nian Nian would remember her little kindnesses, and repay her tenfold or a hundredfold.

One had to know that in high society, many young people were already so intoxicated by the extreme extravagance and luxury of their lives that they no longer knew what it meant to be grateful. There weren’t many children who were as obedient and sweet as Nian Nian.

When Qiao Nian returned to her room, the snake quickly slithered over. It happily slithered up her leg to her wrist, flicking its tongue.

Qiao Nian looked at the snake in confusion. Why was it here? She looked up and saw Gu Zhou not far away, looking at his tablet.

“Good girl.” Smiling, Qiao Nian spoke gently to the snake on her wrist. Only then did she put the violin aside and gently stroke the snake’s head.

For some reason, Qiao Nian recalled how it had attacked her the first time she came to the Gu residence. At that time, she had still been thinking of boiling the snake alive to make medicine!

“Lan?” Qiao Nian called the snake’s name softly.

The snake flicked out its tongue happily, taking the initiative to rub its head against Qiao Nian’s hand.

Qiao Nian felt that this name was a little awkward. She said, “I’ll change your name in the future.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The snake tilted its head and looked at Qiao Nian, as if waiting for her to give it a name.

“Little Lan?” Now, Qiao Nian realized what had felt odd. A one-syllable name was always slightly awkward to voice aloud. “I’ll call you Little Lan from now on.”

When Gu Zhou, who had been sitting at the side, heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned in disapproval. “It’s not young anymore.”

“That’s fine. It’s just a name.”

“It’s very old.”

“It’s okay. In my eyes, it’s just a little baby.” Qiao Nian looked down at the snake and said gently, “Little Lan, don’t you think so?”

Little Lan circled Qiao Nian’s wrist excitedly, as if it agreed wholeheartedly with Qiao Nian’s words.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and said with a smile, “Look, Little Lan likes this name. Anyway, it’s already mine. I’ll follow my preferences.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he didn’t reply. He lowered his head and continued looking at the tablet in his hand. The screen on the tablet displayed Gu Corporation’s plans for the next year.

Qiao Nian sat on the bed and played with Little Lan for a while before reluctantly sending it back to the pet room.

By the time she returned, Gu Zhou had already taken a shower and was lying on the bed.

After cleaning herself up, she poured herself a glass of wine as usual, and sat lazily on the sofa to drink.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the wine glass in Qiao Nian’s hand. He frowned imperceptibly. “Why didn’t you use the crystal glass?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was slightly stunned. She recalled how Zhou Zhou had given her the crystal cup. She couldn’t be sure if Gu Zhou would change his personality again in the future.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian asked tentatively, “Gu Zhou, how are you feeling today? Do you feel anything odd?”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she stood up and walked to the wine cabinet. She replaced the glass in her hand with the crystal glass and poured more red wine into it.
