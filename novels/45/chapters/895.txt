896 Heartache for Xiao Shi

Qiao Nian sighed slightly and looked at Xiao Shi, who was standing not far away, with heartache.

Gu Zhou, who was standing beside Xiao Shi, happened to see the heartache in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

Qiao Nian inadvertently met Gu Zhou’s gaze. She didn’t say anything. She placed her phone in her pocket and walked towards them.

Matriarch Gu pulled Gu Qi and Xiao Shi towards the living room. When they reached the living room, she smiled at the two children and said in a low voice, “The two of you, wait a moment. I’ll go change my clothes. We can eat later!”

Seeing Gu Qi and Xiao Shi nod obediently, Matriarch Gu brought the servant upstairs. It was very inconvenient to wear a European-style dress. She had to change into her usual clothes.

Chen Qing walked in and gave Gu Zhou a look. The two of them went upstairs together.

Qiao Nian sat on the sofa with the two children.

Xiao Shi sat on the sofa uneasily. Although she had been here once before, she had used Gu Qi’s identity that time. Her appearance in the Gu family was a little like a performance.

But now, she was using her identity to come to the Gu family. Although her great-grandmother and father welcomed her, she was still a little restrained and didn’t know what to do.

Gu Qi stood in front of the coffee table and peeled an orange, then handed it to Xiao Shi.

Xiao Shi’s eyes were filled with gratitude. She instinctively wanted to thank him.

But then she remembered that her brother didn’t like her saying “thank you”, so she just smiled.

After Gu Qi gave Xiao Shi an orange, he stood in front of the coffee table and continued to peel it. Then, he handed the orange in his hand to Qiao Nian. “Mommy, eat it too!”

When Xiao Shi heard the word “Mommy”, her body stiffened and she subconsciously looked at Qiao Nian.

She saw Qiao Nian smiling at Gu Qi gently.

That gentle gaze was like the winter sun, warming one’s heart.

In the past, she had dreamed that Song Man looked at her like this. In her dream, she felt that she was very happy.

Qiao Nian took the orange from Gu Qi and broke off one piece. She placed it in Gu Qi’s mouth first, then took another piece and placed it in her own mouth.

After Qiao Nian finished eating, Gu Qi asked expectantly, “Mommy, does the orange taste good?”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Of course the oranges Xiao Qi peels are the best. They’re especially sweet!”

Gu Qi, who had been praised, had a happy smile on his face!

When Gu Zhou walked down the stairs, he saw the smile on Gu Qi’s face. He stopped in his tracks.

The current Gu Qi looked like a normal child. He was completely certain that the Gu Qi in front of him was Gu Qi, not Xiao Shi in disguise.

Ever since Gu Qi really treated Qiao Nian as his mommy, Gu Qi had changed completely. He had become even brighter.

When Qiao Nian heard footsteps, she looked up. Gu Zhou’s expression was much better than before. He no longer looked sickly.

He was wearing a white shirt. The first two buttons of the shirt were unbuttoned, and through the gap, one could vaguely see his sexy collarbone. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

With one hand in his pocket, he walked down the stairs elegantly, like a noble young master in a comic book.

At this moment, Qiao Nian realized why many girls liked two-dimensional men.

This was because two-dimensional men were really too handsome, especially when two-dimensional men they looked like real people. Not many women could resist this temptation.

Qiao Nian felt her mouth go dry. She swallowed. The scene of her and Gu Zhou in the hospital ward suddenly flashed in her mind.

The two of them were entangled on the hospital bed.

If Gu Qi hadn’t come in back then, the two of them might have slept together on the hospital bed.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s face turned even redder.

She really didn’t mean to think about this. Her mind was completely out of control. Who asked Gu Zhou to be so beautiful?

If Gu Zhou stepped into the entertainment industry, there would probably be no other male celebrity left.

Qiao Nian didn’t understand how this man could be so good-looking.

Gu Qi’s gaze lingered on Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s faces. He noticed the ambiguity between the two of them. Then, he walked up to Xiao Shi and reached out to hold her hand.

Xiao Shi looked at Gu Qi in confusion.

Gu Qi smiled and said, “Sister, there are many toys in my room. I’ve always wanted to play with you. Let’s go over and play now!”

Xiao Shi nodded.
