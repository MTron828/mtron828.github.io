1486 Third Earl?

Qiao Nian frowned at Gu Zhou and said in a low voice, “According to you, are we going to expand our investigation again?”

Qiao Nian came back to her senses and nodded. She took a bite of her food and asked, “The wife of the Third Earl is…”

“The big star Su Wan from more than twenty years ago. I heard that the Third Earl also had a chance to become the president back then, but because he married someone from the entertainment industry, the previous president was very dissatisfied, so he passed the throne to the current president.” After Gu Zhou said that, he continued, “However, the Third Earl’s family is happy and harmonious. His children are all very healthy, and the eldest child is two years younger than you.”

“Looks like we can eliminate the Third Earl.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she took out her phone and scrolled through the photos of the Third Earl’s wife. She frowned slightly. “You didn’t say before that his wife was from Country Z. I might not have thought too much about it. Look, doesn’t his wife look a little like Song Man?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he took the cell phone and took a closer look. Only then did he say, “I will start investigating the Third Earl.”

When they went to bed at night, Gu Zhou realized that Qiao Nian had been tossing and turning. He reached out and pulled her into his arms, saying softly, “Don’t worry, we’ll just wait for news quietly.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she narrowed her eyes and said helplessly, “I just think this matter is very complicated. I don’t know when I’ll be able to investigate it thoroughly. My father originally called to see me, but because Lina was here, I rejected him.”

Gu Zhou patted Qiao Nian’s back gently and said in a low voice, “Don’t meet Father-in-law for the time being. Those people will definitely be wary of him, but not of us.”

“Don’t they know that I’m still alive?” After Qiao Nian asked, she couldn’t help but laugh again. “I’m a little confused. They know that I’m still alive, but they don’t know that I already know that I’m the eldest daughter of the Lu family.”

“Yes, one is in the open and one is in the dark. It’ll be easier to investigate. Later, tell your father what we know and exchange information.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he leaned over and kissed Qiao Nian’s forehead. “Go to sleep. It’s getting late. You still have to treat Madam President tomorrow.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes. The faces of the three children suddenly appeared in her mind, and her lips curved up slightly.

The next morning, after breakfast, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou took a car to the president’s palace.

The president’s palace was very far away. It took two hours to drive there, and there were many checkpoints on the way.

Lina sat in the car in front to clear the way, while Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian sat in the car behind.

When the guards at the checkpoint saw Lina, they immediately opened the door and let her in.

Soon, they arrived at the front of the palace.

The majestic palace made one involuntarily feel its reverence.

Lina was the first to get out of the car. In her high heels, she walked happily towards the car behind her. Seeing Qiao Nian get out of the car, she immediately took her arm and said happily, “Nian Nian! Let’s go. My mother was very happy after finding out that she will be seeing you today. I’ll take you to see her.”

When the president found out that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were coming, he was already standing at the door, waiting. Seeing Lina’s innocent and lively expression, he couldn’t help but say, “Lina.”

Lina looked at the president in confusion.

The president smiled helplessly. His daughter was like a child, innocent and pure. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he asked, “You’ve been in the car for so long. Are you tired? Why don’t you go in and rest for a while?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
