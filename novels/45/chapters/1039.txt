1040 Drugged

He Cheng really didn’t expect the Lu family to be so considerate as to give him back his car.

Qiao Xin blushed slightly. During the time she had been locked up, she hadn’t eaten or drunk anything. That was why her stomach was growling. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She nodded slightly and smiled. “Thank you.”

With that, Qiao Xin got into He Cheng’s car.

!!

He Cheng opened the door of the front passenger seat and drove straight to KFC.

The two of them chose their main courses. Qiao Xin sat in the waiting area, while He Cheng queued up with a group of people, preparing to collect the burgers and Coke.

When He Cheng took the order, he walked to the side. After a moment’s hesitation, he placed the white pills he had gotten previously into Qiao Xin’s Coke.

After everything was done, He Cheng brought the food to Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin sat there, her mind filled with thoughts of the relationship between Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu.

She still felt that it was impossible for Qiao Nian to be the eldest daughter of the Lu family. They must have pretended to be siblings to hide their indecent relationship.

Sigh.

Poor Sister Song Man had actually been killed by Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin sighed helplessly, her eyes gradually darkening. If Sister Song Man were still around, Qiao Nian wouldn’t have had a say.

When Qiao Xin saw He Cheng coming over with food, she immediately picked up the Coke near her and took a sip. After taking a bite of her burger, she asked, “He Cheng, if Gu Zhou finds out about Qiao Nian’s despicable behavior, will he divorce her?”

Back then, she should have been the one to marry Gu Zhou. If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, she would have been the Young Madam of the Gu family by now.

Qiao Nian had stolen her glory and wealth. She wanted to snatch everything back bit by bit.

At this moment, He Cheng was also starving. Seeing that Qiao Xin had drunk the drugged cola, he felt a little restless. He munched on his burger and casually echoed, “I don’t know.”

When Qiao Xin heard He Cheng’s words, she frowned slightly. Right now, she only wanted to hear others insult Qiao Nian. She didn’t want to hear anything else.

Although she didn’t want to admit it, she couldn’t. Qiao Nian was really smart and lucky.

Qiao Xin frowned slightly and said, “As a man, can you accept a wife who is willing to marry anyone?”

He Cheng smiled and said, “Miss Qiao, how many clean women are there now?”

“What do you mean?” Qiao Xin felt offended. She felt that He Cheng had gone too far. How dare he say that no woman was good?

“Aren’t women nowadays all pretending to be innocent?” He Cheng smiled and said, “If you really want to find a clean woman, won’t you have to go to kindergarten to find one?”

“That’s just prejudice. There are many good girls. You spend all your time in those messy places. How can you meet any good girls?” Qiao Xin couldn’t be bothered to argue with He Cheng anymore. She lowered her head and ate silently. Why should she argue with a scumbag?

After dinner, Qiao Xin prepared to take a taxi home. She didn’t want to take that broken van anymore.

“You promised me that you would attack Qiao Nian. Are you still going to do it?” Qiao Xin raised her eyebrows slightly and questioned coldly.

He Cheng wiped his mouth haphazardly with a tissue and casually threw it on the table. “Of course. I’ve already received money. How can I not do it?”

“Alright, I’ll go home and wait for your good news!” As Qiao Xin spoke, she stood up and prepared to leave.

The world spun. She couldn’t stand steadily. She hurriedly held onto the table and barely stood up.

“Strange, what’s wrong with me?” Qiao Xin pressed her temples, looking so weak that she could fall at any moment.

“Are you alright?” As He Cheng spoke, he stepped forward to support Qiao Xin. “Are you feeling dizzy because you were starving?”

Qiao Xin didn’t think too much about it. She let He Cheng hold her and said with a frown, “I might have low blood sugar.”

“Let me send you home!” He Cheng said.

Qiao Xin thought about it. That was the only way.

Qiao Xin sat back down in He Cheng’s car. She turned to look at He Cheng and asked, “The medicine I prepared for you is still with you, right?”

“Yeah.”

“That medicine can turn a woman into a slut.” Qiao Xin’s lips curved up slightly as she said happily, “Record all of it and post it online.”
