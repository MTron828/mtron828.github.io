Chapter 1822 - 1822 Apologize

Heartache appeared in his eyes. He was about to ask about what happened in Europe when Xiao Bao’s cries interrupted his thoughts.

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Xiao Bao’s face and he looked worried. “Is Xiao Bao injured? Let me take a look.”

Lu Nian naturally hugged Gu Qi and Xiao Shi, who were standing at the side. He gently touched the two children’s faces and felt the temperature of their faces. When he noticed that they were not cold, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Lu Nian’s gaze landed on the man not far away. The man’s suit was straight, and his eyes were filled with worry, as if he was very worried about Xiao Bao.

He had a strong perception of his surroundings and could sense that that person was not an ordinary person.

Seeing that Lu Zhu was about to examine Xiao Bao, Qiao Nian hurriedly shook her head with a smile and said, “Brother, don’t worry. Xiao Bao isn’t injured.”

At this moment, Lu Zhu and Lu Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Lu Zhu looked at Xiao Bao, who was sobbing, and asked worriedly, “Then why is he still…”

Gu Qi leaned into Lu Nian’s ear and briefly explained what had just happened.

Lu Nian looked at the man in the distance in confusion. He frowned slightly and said in a low and hoarse voice, “Then do you know who he is?”

Xiao Shi said obediently, “Mommy said that he’s Mommy’s eldest senior brother. Second Brother even said that he’s Uncle Chang Feng.”

Eldest Brother?

When Lu Nian heard the two children’s words, he roughly guessed something and gradually let down his guard.

Previously, Sugar had said that Xiao Bao had grown up with her eldest senior brother.

Qiao Nian handed Xiao Bao, who was still sobbing softly, to Lu Zhu. She stood up and walked towards Chang Feng. She said helplessly, “Eldest Senior Brother, I didn’t expect Xiao Bao…”

When Chang Feng heard Qiao Nian’s words, he shook his head gently and looked at Xiao Bao, who was in Lu Zhu’s arms.

He and Gu Yue had raised Xiao Bao personally. He knew Xiao Bao’s personality very well.

“I’m fine.” Chang Feng retracted his gaze from Qiao Nian’s face and looked at her gently. “Actually, it’s my fault for what happened today.”

If he had controlled himself and did not appear in front of Xiao Bao tonight, Xiao Bao would not have been sad.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Xiao Bao is still young. Even though he knows what happened back then, he still can’t accept it emotionally.” Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao not far away gently, his eyes filled with reluctance.

Qiao Nian looked at Eldest Senior Brother with heartache, then turned to look at Xiao Bao, who was not far away.

Although she had not interacted with Xiao Bao for long, she roughly knew his temper.

Xiao Bao had a stubborn temper. He was feeling aggrieved and unhappy now. He definitely wouldn’t let Eldest Senior Brother carry him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have pushed Eldest Senior Brother away just now.

Initially, Eldest Senior Brother only wanted to secretly look at Xiao Bao and not let him discover him. Since Xiao Bao had already seen Eldest Senior Brother, there was no need for Eldest Senior Brother to hide anymore.

“Eldest Senior Brother, let’s go in and talk. I’ll comfort Xiao Bao later. When the time comes, you and him…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish, she was interrupted by Chang Feng.

“There’s no need.” Chang Feng had a gentle smile on his face. He narrowed his eyes slightly to hide the loneliness in them and said softly, “I have other things to do. I’ll just say a few words to him.”

To Chang Feng, he would not be sad if Xiao Bao misunderstood him. He knew very well that everything he had done previously was for Xiao Bao’s own good. As long as Xiao Bao was fine, he was satisfied.

Chang Feng walked behind Xiao Bao and watched as Xiao Bao buried his head in Lu Zhu’s arms, looking like he did not want to see him.

Chang Feng glanced at Lu Zhu and nodded slightly. When he and Gu Yue were still in the Gu family, he had met Lu Zhu a few times.

When Chang Feng walked over, Lu Zhu remembered who Chang Feng was and nodded as a greeting.

“Xiao Bao.”

When Xiao Bao heard Chang Feng’s familiar voice, his body stiffened slightly, and tears of grievance welled up in his eyes again.

Uncle Chang Feng’s voice was as gentle as before. It was so gentle that he could not help but want to throw himself into his arms.

“It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have lied to you back then.” Chang Feng thought of the situation at that time and pursed his lips. He hesitated for a moment before saying again, “The situation at that time was very critical. Your Daddy and I couldn’t guarantee your safety, so we had no choice but to send you away.”

“This matter has made you sad. It’s all our fault. We really never thought of abandoning you. Xiao Bao, can you understand what your Daddy and I are thinking?”
