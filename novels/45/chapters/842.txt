843 Who Exactly Was It?

Gu Zhou was not joking with her.

Qiao Nian clenched her fists nervously.

No, other than her and her grandfather, Brother White Shirt also knew about that matter.

Could Gu Zhou be Brother White Shirt? How was that possible?

She remembered very clearly that the person who had saved her back then was Qiao Yu.

Later on, Qiao Yu often went to look for her and even specially taught her how to draw.

At that time, her stone wall painting showed the scene in the photo Brother White Shirt had given her. At that time, that painting had made her famous.

Why didn’t these things add up? Did she recognize the wrong benefactor? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. Her beautiful fox-like eyes were fixed on Gu Zhou. After a long while, she said, “I want to confirm something first. I’ll give you an answer later. Is that okay?”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian calmly. He had already waited for Qiao Nian for more than ten years. A few more days wouldn’t make a difference, so he nodded.

“Okay!”

Gu Zhou spoke slowly, his expression calm. Although there was a trace of dominance in his voice, it did not make one feel uncomfortable.

Gu Zhou fastened his seatbelt again and drove towards the Gu family villa.

Qiao Nian was right. No matter who Song Man was, what he had to do now was to take over Xiao Shi’s custody.

The two of them returned to the Gu residence.

Qiao Nian heard from the servants that Matriarch Gu had fainted. She and Gu Zhou hurriedly rushed over.

At this moment, Doctor Wang was already examining Matriarch Gu.

Gu Zhou’s phone had run out of battery, so he had not received a call from the servant.

Qiao Nian’s phone had been switched to silent mode, so she didn’t receive any calls.

Gu Zhou looked at Doctor Wang and asked, “Doctor Wang, how’s Grandma’s condition now?”

Doctor Wang frowned slightly and said uncertainly, “Matriarch Gu’s condition is a little strange now. I don’t know what’s wrong with her either. I want to use an instrument to examine her.”

When Gu Zhou heard Doctor Wang’s words, he frowned. He looked at Matriarch Gu, who was lying on the bed.

At this moment, Qiao Nian had already walked over to Matriarch Gu and was taking her pulse.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. If she wasn’t wrong, Matriarch Gu had been poisoned again.

Seeing that Qiao Nian seemed to have made a diagnosis, Gu Zhou asked the servants to send Doctor Wang out first.

Hence, only Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were left.

Gu Zhou sat down beside Qiao Nian and asked solemnly, “How’s Grandma now?”

“Someone poisoned Grandma.” Qiao Nian frowned and retracted her hand. Carefully, she placed Matriarch Gu’s hand under the blanket. “Grandma’s health hasn’t been good to begin with. That person was very careful with the poison. Every time, he added a little more. If I’m not wrong, that person should have poisoned her yesterday!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his expression changed.

In the past two to three days, Qiao Nian had been busy with Xiao Shi and Song Man, so she was often not at home.

For the past two to three days, he had been thinking about that piece of land. He mainly wanted to avenge Qiao Nian, so he didn’t stay at home for long.

Perhaps it was because he and Qiao Nian were not at home that the evildoers had an opportunity.

Who exactly was hiding in the Gu family?

It seemed that he would be busy again.

“I’ll concoct an antidote for Grandma!” As Qiao Nian spoke, she glanced at Gu Zhou with a complicated expression. In the end, she turned around and left without saying anything.

Qiao Nian walked out of Matriarch Gu’s room.

For the past two days, she had been so busy that her feet had not touched the ground. She had not returned home. Now that Matriarch Gu had been poisoned, she could not help but think of Song Man.

When Song Man appeared, something happened to Matriarch Gu again.

Instinctively, Qiao Nian wanted to combine the two cases. Who exactly was Song Man?

Qiao Nian recalled that when she saw Song Man yesterday, she had a faint fragrance.

That fragrance was very familiar, but she couldn’t remember where she had smelled it before.

Qiao Nian entered the medicinal room. An hour later, she walked towards Matriarch Gu’s room with a bowl of the antidote.

Gu Zhou had been guarding Matriarch Gu. Seeing Qiao Nian enter, he stood up to give up his seat.

Qiao Nian helped Matriarch Gu up and carefully fed her medicine.
