Chapter 495: Probing

Qiao Nian continued, “If there are no changes to the jadeite, it can only mean one thing. The soul of the dead is wandering the world. It has never been at peace.”

Qiao Nian asked, “Do you believe in these things?”

When Qiao Nian first heard of this, she was stunned. Although she was in awe of reincarnation, there was no scientific basis for it yet. To her, it was just a fantasy.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, a bitter smile appeared in his eyes. “This is just a form of comfort for the living.”

Just as Qiao Nian had thought, he didn’t believe in reincarnation. He only wanted the Moon Goddess because he missed his sister.

Qiao Nian looked calmly at Lu Zhu. After a while, she said, “Have you ever thought that your sister isn’t actually dead?”

Lu Zhu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and his breathing quickened. His hands gripped the bedsheets tightly. After a long while, when he calmed down, he asked, “Why do you think she’s not dead?”

Qiao Nian said calmly, “Miss Lu’s body wasn’t found, was it?”

At this point, Qiao Nian’s heart involuntarily tensed up, and her breathing became cautious.

This answer was very important to Qiao Nian.

Since the corpse of the Lu family’s eldest daughter was not found, it meant that she was very likely alive. But why didn’t the Lu family continue to look for her?

“Actually, I found part of it.”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. She asked in disbelief, “What do you mean by a part?”

Seeing Qiao Nian’s pale face, confusion flashed in Lu Zhu’s eyes. However, he quickly regained his composure.

Why did he feel that Qiao Nian seemed especially concerned about his sister’s death?

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and said, “Could it be that it was dismembered…?”

Lu Zhu nodded in pain. This matter was very heavy for him. He did not want to recall this matter for the rest of his life. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

If it hadn’t been for the hard evidence, he wouldn’t have believed that his sweet and clingy sister had just died.

“How can you be sure that that body part must belong to Eldest Miss Lu?”

When Lu Zhu heard this, his eyes instantly turned red. His eyes were filled with pain, and his temples throbbed.

He tried to suppress his irritable emotions, but his rapid breathing still revealed his current mood. He was very agitated.

Qiao Nian had only wanted to probe. She hadn’t expected Lu Zhu’s condition to suddenly become so bad when she mentioned this.

Qiao Nian was a little worried about Lu Zhu. If Lu Zhu continued like this, it was very likely that he would tear his wound. Lu Zhu’s wound was near his heart. If he became emotional, the consequences would be unimaginable.

“Don’t think about this for the time being…” Qiao Nian hurriedly comforted him.

“At that time, the police deployed all their forces, but they only found a section of my sister’s forearm. And after a forensic paternity test, it was completely confirmed that the arm belonged to my sister.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she gasped. She felt as if there was a thick fog in front of her, and she couldn’t clear it no matter what.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t taken her and Lu Zhu’s hair samples for a paternity test, she would never have guessed that she was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Why had it come to this?

Back then, the forensic doctor confirmed that the arm belonged to the eldest daughter of the Lu family, but her arm was intact!

If not for the fact that she was born on the same day as Eldest Miss Lu, and if not for the paternity test, she might have really believed that Eldest Miss Lu was already dead.

Therefore, it could only mean one thing. That arm belonged to someone else.
