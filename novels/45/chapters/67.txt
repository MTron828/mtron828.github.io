Chapter 68: Acting Innocent

Wang An didn’t even bother granting Qiao Xin a look of glance as he said, “Are you sure you’ll be able to understand?”

Qiao Xin’s face burned with embarrassment.

In the past, whenever Su Yan was working on projects with his mentor, she would often tag along as well. She genuinely hadn’t expected to be rejected this time round. Her composure was shaken.

Wang An’s gaze lingered on Su Yan’s face as he spoke coldly. “Take care of your personal matters. When you’re done, come to the Vice Principal’s office to look for me.”

With that, Wang An left without looking back.

Su Yan’s face turned pale. This was the first time he had been reprimanded by Principal Wang, and his expression instantly darkened.

Su Yan turned to look at Qiao Xin, his eyes clouded with irritation. Qiao Xin was too clingy. That must have been why she had grown too big for her britches.

Qiao Xin could tell that Su Yan was displeased, and her small face turned pale in fear. Her tears began to fall uncontrollably.

“Brother Su Yan.” Qiao Xin lowered her head and sniffled. “I’m sorry for causing you trouble!”

Qiao Xin’s words successfully quelled Su Yan’s anger.

“Did someone say something to Principal Wang? Do we have to gain their approval just to graduate?”

Qiao Xin looked up at Su Yan with tears swirling in her eyes, looking utterly pitiful.

Su Yan looked at Qiao Xin’s pitiful manner and recalled what she had said. He also recalled how Principal Wang had treated him just now. With those thoughts in mind, he formed a theory.

Qiao Nian must have spoken ill of him in front of Principal Wang. That must have been why Principal Wang had treated him so coldly.

Su Yan clenched his fists in a rage. Gritting his teeth, he growled. “It must be Qiao Nian!”

“It can’t be Sister!” Qiao Xin shook her head. More and more tears fell, and her voice was choked with emotion. “Although Sister wants to be with you, she definitely won’t do anything to hurt you.”

Su Yan snorted coldly when he heard Qiao Xin’s words.

He was now completely certain that Qiao Nian was playing hard to get.

Qiao Nian must have seen that he hadn’t taken the initiative to chase after her. She must have set up a trap so that he would be forced to chase after her.

Only if he fawned over Qiao Nian, would she allow him to graduate without a hitch!

Qiao Nian was truly despicable!

In order to possess him, she was unscrupulous.

“Qiao Xin, don’t cry.” Su Yan carefully wiped her tears away and said gently, “I will definitely protect you. I won’t let you suffer any grievances.”

“Brother Su Yan, you’re the best,” Qiao Xin said, her eyes red-rimmed.

Su Yan leaned over and gently kissed Qiao Xin’s forehead, then straightened up. “Alright, you can leave first. I’ll go to the principal’s office.”

“Okay.” Qiao Xin nodded obediently.

Su Yan looked at Qiao Xin’s manner and liked her even more. Surely there could be no one who didn’t like such a sweet and obedient girl! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After Su Yan left, Qiao Xin silently wiped her tears away. As she gazed coldly at his retreating back, a smug smile appeared on her face.

Tonight, she would know who the owner of the jade pendant was. If that person had a higher status than Su Yan, and he was the type she liked, she could openly snatch him away from Qiao Nian.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin heaved a sigh of relief. There would come a time when she won against Qiao Nian.

Holding her bag, Qiao Xin walked out of the school elegantly in her ten-centimeter high heels.

Qiao Xin drove directly to the Gu family villa.

She parked her car at the entrance of the Gu family’s villa. Looking at the majestic, towering doors of the grand entrance, the thought that she would soon meet the person from five years ago struck her. Her heart began to beat faster and faster.

Qiao Xin had just walked to the door when the butler greeted her..
