Chapter 345: Understanding

When Qiao Nian heard this, she felt a lump in her throat. For a moment, she couldn’t speak.

“Could it be that Mommy doesn’t want me because I’m not obedient?”

Qiao Nian really didn’t know what to say. However, when she saw Gu Qi holding her hands uneasily, she hurriedly said, “Don’t let your imagination run wild. How can your mommy not love you? How can she not want you?”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, his frown deepened. He really couldn’t understand why his mother didn’t visit him when she was clearly still alive.

Qiao Nian suddenly thought of herself. Her family was also a mess. However, after she grew up, she realized that those people weren’t her family at all. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But Gu Qi was different. He was still a child and needed his mother’s company. Only then could he grow up healthily and happily.

When she was young, she had sat in the field every day, thinking about when her parents would visit her.

However, the anticipation grew weaker and weaker. Towards the end, it gradually turned into disappointment.

Of course she didn’t want Gu Qi to be like her.

Qiao Nian squatted in front of Gu Qi and held his hand. With a serious expression, she said, “Gu Qi, there are too many things one can’t do in this world. You’re still young, and you might not understand it, but when you grow up, you’ll realize that many things are beyond one’s control. Perhaps your mother had her own difficulties back then, so she couldn’t get together with you. But I believe that since she was willing to endure the pain of childbirth for ten months, it means that she must have loved you very much.”

Actually, she was not only saying these words to Gu Qi, but also to herself.

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes gradually lit up. He asked seriously, “Does Mommy really love me?”

“Of course,” Qiao Nian replied with certainty. “Who wouldn’t like such an obedient and adorable child like Gu Qi?”

Gu Qi asked seriously, “Will we definitely find our mommies?”

“Of course!”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, a bright smile appeared on his face. He felt much better.

“Alright, let me send you back to school!” Qiao Nian said.

Gu Qi nodded and obediently followed Qiao Nian towards the school.

Just as the two of them were about to reach the school gate, Qiao Nian suddenly recalled Gu Qi’s solitary personality in front of outsiders. She was a little worried that this would happen again.

“Gu Qi, why aren’t you willing to speak to others?”

Gu Qi didn’t speak. He didn’t know why he was doing this either, so he didn’t answer Qiao Nian’s question.

Qiao Nian looked at the silent Gu Qi. She felt that something must have happened to Gu Qi when he was young, or perhaps he was alone when he was young, which was why he was unwilling to communicate with others.

Perhaps because of this, Gu Qi was a little reclusive.

Gu Qi’s condition was still alright. He needed to be taken good care of.

If Gu Qi was not taken good care of, his condition would only worsen. In the end, he might not even be willing to communicate with the people closest to him.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi and said, “Remember to pay me back in the future.”

If Gu Qi was willing to talk to her, she would spend more time with him. Most importantly, she would help him find his mommy.

Gu Qi nodded. “I’ll definitely return it.”

Qiao Nian left after sending Gu Qi to the classroom. She still had to prepare the items for the private auction.

…

At the Gu family villa.

Gu Zhou was sitting in his office chair. He took out his phone and opened Gu Qi’s WeChat.

He recalled the WeChat profile picture on Qiao Nian’s phone last night. That person’s profile picture was identical to Gu Qi’s.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly and sent a text. “How’s school?”

After Gu Zhou sent the text, a dazzling exclamation mark appeared beside the text.

Gu Zhou was slightly stunned. Had Gu Qi deleted him?
