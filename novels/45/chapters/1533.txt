1534 Missing Medicinal Ingredient

The president handed the folder to Qiao Nian and said, “Doctor Qiao, this contains my Madam’s medical records.”

Right on the heels of that, a servant’s voice came from outside. “Mr. President.”

The president glanced at the door and couldn’t help but grip Shen Mei’s hand tightly. He wanted to talk to Shen Mei for a while longer, but he was too busy. He said to the person outside, “I understand.”

The President retracted his gaze that fell on Shen Mei’s face. In the past, when Shen Mei was awake, he rarely had time to accompany her. He looked at Shen Mei, his eyes filled with guilt. “I’ll go get busy first. I’ll visit you later.”

Shen Mei smiled and nodded. “Okay!”

Shen Mei was mentally young, but she knew everything.

If the president accompanied her now, he might have to get up in the middle of the night to read documents. She didn’t want him to work so hard.

The president looked at Shen Mei and said gently, “Rest more. Doctor Qiao and I will go out for a chat.”

“Okay,” Shen Mei agreed, lowering her gaze. She put down the cup in her hand and walked towards the bed.

The president hurriedly held Shen Mei’s arm. After Shen Mei lay down, he covered her with the blanket and walked out, signaling for Qiao Nian to follow him.

After the two of them left, the president closed the door. After confirming that Shen Mei couldn’t hear anything, he looked at the servant and asked with a frown, “What happened again?”

He had been really busy for the past two days. He had not stopped working at all.

When the servant heard the president’s words, he lowered his head in embarrassment and said, “Mr. President, there’s a medicinal ingredient in Doctor Qiao’s prescription that can’t be bought. Moreover, we can’t get any information.”

The situation was serious, so the servants did not dare to delay and immediately ran over to report.

“What do you mean you can’t buy it?” the president questioned, frowning.

“That medicinal ingredient seems to be especially rare. No one in the country has seen it,” the servant said, pursing his lips.

“What is it called?”

“Colorful fungus.” The servant handed the prescription to the president. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian’s prescription was written in English, so the president naturally understood.

When Qiao Nian heard the servant’s words, she frowned slightly, her expression turning serious.

If it were any other medicinal ingredient, she might be able to find a substitute, but Colorful Fungus was the most important medicinal ingredient in this prescription. It could not be replaced.

Qiao Nian frowned and shook her head gently. “I don’t have any Colorful fungus there either. Even if we find Colorful fungus in Country Z, the living conditions of Colorful fungus are harsh. If we accidentally touch the roots, they will immediately wither. The leaves have to be picked and brewed into medicine within four hours. The medicine has to be drunk within an hour. Otherwise, we won’t be able to bring out the effects of Colorful fungus.”

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s words, his expression changed slightly.

If Colorful Fungus was so precious, even if someone in Country Z had it, they would probably not be willing to take it out. Even if they were willing to give it to them, the situation on the plane was unstable. If Mark attacked the plane, they would not be able to get it at all and would suffer a big loss.

The president’s expression darkened. He said firmly, “Even if we have to turn the entire European country upside down, we have to find the Colorful Fungus!”

Lina walked over from afar and happened to hear the president’s words. Her face turned pale. She seemed to have thought of something, and her eyes gradually hardened. She called out, “Dad! Don’t worry, we’ll definitely find the Colorful Fungus.”

With that, Lina looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “Nian Nian, what does the colorful fungus look like? Do you have a photo?”

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment, then turned on her phone, found a photo of the Colorful Fungus, and sent it to Lina.

Colored Fungus was very precious, but it was not very rare. This fungus grew on the steep mountain cliffs in the northwest, so it was not easy to transplant and pick. Hence, it was rare.
