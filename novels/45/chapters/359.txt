Chapter 360: Taunt

Qiao Xin’s mind was in a mess.

Gu Zhou shouted, “One billion!”

When this number was called out, everyone present was stunned. They were all so frightened that they didn’t dare to speak.

This was simply an astronomical figure.

Their net worth might not even be this high.

Qiao Xin felt uneasy. She hurriedly grabbed Qiao Yu’s arm, signaling for him to stop. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, what puzzled Qiao Xin was that her brother wasn’t looking at her. Instead, he was looking at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin said uneasily, “Brother, we…”

“1.1 billion,” Qiao Yu called out.

Qiao Xin almost fainted from shock.

Her brother had really gone crazy!

How could he spend so much money on a painting?

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Seeing that Gu Zhou was about to raise the price, she hurriedly interrupted him and said, “Stop bidding for now. I think there’s something wrong with this painting!”

......

These words exploded like a bomb, stunning everyone present.

Song Yu frowned slightly. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and she said aggressively, “Miss Qiao, what do you mean by this? Are you doubting me?”

Everyone was slightly stunned. They didn’t expect Song Yu to have such a strong sense of oppression.

Qiao Nian didn’t seem to be afraid at all. Her beautiful fox-like eyes met Song Yu’s sharp ones. She opened her mouth lazily and said, “Miss Qiao, I’m questioning this painting and not you. Why are you inserting yourself in it?”

Song Yu raised her eyebrows.

This little girl was quite eloquent. No one could refute her.

Song Yu retracted her gaze indifferently. Her gaze fell on the painting and she asked, “Miss Qiao, what’s wrong with this painting?”

Song Yu’s words echoed everyone’s thoughts. Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. They all wanted to know the answer.

Qiao Nian said unhurriedly, “The real painting is in my hands.”

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, they were in an uproar.

They looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

How was this possible?

Once again, their gazes fell on the painting. The person and objects in the painting seemed to be walking out. It was exactly the same as the stone wall painting they had seen.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes flickered. He looked at Qiao Nian. Although it was only a moment of surprise, it quickly turned into trust.

He believed her.

As long as she said it, he would believe her.

Even Gu Zhou himself did not sense this unconditional trust.

Qiao Yu frowned. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. For a moment, he looked at her with a gentle expression.

Qin Lu was the first to step forward and say, “Miss Song was clearly the one who brought the stone wall painting over, and she’s a living creature on stage right now. How are you going to prove it?”

Qiao Nian glanced at Qin Lu coldly. “Miss Qin, that phrase is used to describe animals. If you don’t know how to use words, please start learning again from elementary school!”

Qin Lu’s face turned red. He clenched his fists tightly and said angrily, “Miss Qiao, I think I know you want to ride on Miss Song’s coattails.”

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered with an idiot like Qin Lu. Her gaze fell on Zhang Lei’s face on the stage, and her tone softened. “Mr. Zhang, please take a look at the auction list. Is the last item on the list the stone wall painting?”

When Qiao Nian said this, everyone present was stunned.

They all looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

“What’s going on? How does she know the order of the items being auctioned?”

“Then is she related to the organizers?”

“How can you believe that? Are you stupid? I think she must be bragging!”

“Let me tell you, there are many people who want to be in the limelight. I’ve seen too many of them!”

“For the sake of fame, she doesn’t care about her face!”

…

Many people were mocking Qiao Nian.
