808 Swear

His son was also a famous genius in An City. Now that the Qiao family’s company was in Qiao Yu’s hands, it had taken another step forward.

The Qiao family was so outstanding. How could there be a scum like Su Xue?

If it weren’t for Su Xue, how could the Qiao family have lost all face?

All the hard work he and his son had put in their entire lives had been trampled under Su Xue’s feet.

Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words and looked at Qiao Shan’s darkening face. She knelt in front of Qiao Shan and begged pitifully, “Hubby, don’t listen to Qiao Nian’s nonsense. I really didn’t do anything to let you down. Didn’t I tell you everything in detail wherever I went in the past?”

“Hubby, please believe me. I really won’t do anything to let you down again. I…”

However, before Su Xue could finish speaking, Qiao Shan kicked her to the ground.

Su Xue’s expression changed drastically. She looked at Qiao Shan in fear.

Previously, Qiao Shan had hit her in the hotel. She was really afraid that Qiao Shan would use violence on her again.

Su Xue lay on the ground, trembling.

It was all Qiao Nian’s fault. If Qiao Nian hadn’t spouted nonsense, Qiao Shan wouldn’t have hit her.

At the thought of this, Su Xue glared at Qiao Nian angrily. Gritting her teeth, she said, “Qiao Nian, you b*tch. You’re spouting nonsense. How dare you throw cold water at me!”

Qiao Nian shrugged nonchalantly and said calmly, “I just said that I wouldn’t call the police, but I didn’t say that I wouldn’t tell Qiao Shan.”

With that, Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Shan gently and continued, “I thought that since the two of you are husband and wife, you would definitely want the other party to be honest with you. Moreover, I was just helping you out of kindness. You don’t have to thank me too much!”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, her face filled with despair. She watched as Qiao Shan walked towards her step by step. She could feel the anger radiating from Qiao Shan. She hurriedly got up from the ground and kowtowed to Qiao Shan. “You have to believe me. I really didn’t use money to keep a gigolo. I used it all on our family’s daily expenses. Hubby, if I betray you, I’ll be struck by lightning and die a horrible death!”

In Su Xue’s opinion, swearing was like farting. It didn’t mean anything.

However, Qiao Shan didn’t believe Su Xue at all. His mind was filled with thoughts of Su Xue fooling around with other men. The woman he liked the most was using his money to pay for other gigolos.

“B*tch, you actually lied to me for more than twenty years. Twenty years ago, a million yuan was a huge sum. How dare you take the money to keep a gigolo? Tell me, where did you put this million yuan!”

“Hubby, I really didn’t. Just believe me this once, okay? I really didn’t betray you!” Su Xue said tearfully.

Bam—

The crisp sound of the slap resounded throughout the room.

Qiao Shan gave Su Xue a vicious slap, causing blood to flow from the corner of her mouth.

“Ah!” Su Xue screamed in pain!

Qiao Shan’s mind was filled with images of Su Xue sitting on that gigolo. His eyes grew redder and redder, and he gradually lost his mind.

He stepped forward and kicked Su Xue hard in the stomach, sending her flying a meter away.

Su Xue’s back hit the pillar hard, and her face turned pale from the pain. She felt as if she was about to die.

Qiao Shan walked up to Su Xue and punched and kicked her.

Regardless of whether there was evidence, he felt that Su Xue had already taken a million yuan to keep a gigolo more than twenty years ago.

The one million yuan from twenty years ago was a huge sum. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At that time, his company only had five million yuan.

At that time, he often felt sad that he had not been able to get an investment.

However, Su Xue was a scheming girl. She used the money to keep other people as her boy toy.

If he had that million yuan back then, the Qiao family would definitely have risen to a higher level.

The more Qiao Shan thought about it, the more hatred he felt. He tightened his grip.

Qiao Nian stood coldly at the side. Seeing Qiao Shan hit Su Xue, her lips curved into a mocking smile.

Regardless of whether Su Xue had cheated on him back then, in Qiao Shan’s eyes, Su Xue had already cheated on him.

To Qiao Shan, Su Xue’s words could not be trusted.

Qiao Nian didn’t want to watch the two of them fight either. She retracted her gaze and walked upstairs, not knowing if the notebook she had hidden was still there.
