Chapter 477: Doubts

Qiao Nian had already woken up. Xu Qian thought that there was no need for her to stay here any longer. She walked towards the operating theater, wanting to go in and help.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s pale face and narrowed his eyes. “You…”

“Lu Zhu became like this because he wanted to save me. If anything happens to him, I definitely won’t forgive myself.” Qiao Nian subconsciously interrupted Gu Zhou. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian felt that she had let her guard down at the hotel, which was why Song Yue had seized the opportunity to attack her. However, she had caused Lu Zhu to be injured.

Moreover, Lu Zhu was still unconscious and was not out of danger.

Qiao Nian hated owing favors, even if that person was Lu Zhu, who was related to her by blood.

Seeing how unstable Qiao Nian was, Gu Zhou didn’t want to bring up what he had just said anymore. He comforted her softly, “Lu Zhu will definitely be fine.”

“I hope so.”

At this moment, in the operating theater.

Xu Qian carefully packed up the tools she had used after the surgery. This was something that had to be done for every surgery. This was because some medical supplies would produce bacteria after use and needed to be treated in time.

When Xu Qian was almost done packing, she walked towards the medical trash can. Just as she was about to throw a blood bag inside, she realized that there was a blood bag missing.

This was no small matter, as lesions could become infected after a blood bag has been used, so it needed to be dealt with immediately.

Xu Qianwei frowned. She searched the operating theater and did not find any other used blood bags.

Xu Qian looked at the blood bag in her hand in confusion. In the past, she had been part of so many surgeries, but this had never happened before.

She had three bags of what must have been the hospital blood bank’s previous stock, and two bags of blood from her colleagues.

Strange. Where had Qiao Nian’s blood bag gone?

Xu Qian frowned. Why couldn’t she find it?

Xu Qian threw the five blood bags into the medical trash can and looked around, but she still couldn’t find it.

Suddenly, an idea flashed across Xu Qian’s mind. She had a bold guess.

The reason why there were only five blood bags was very likely that Qiao Nian hadn’t donated blood at all.

However, Xu Qian was a little puzzled. Why didn’t Qiao Nian donate blood? Why did her colleagues say that Qiao Nian donated blood?

Xu Qian took out the blood donation file and checked it. The latest blood donor was Qiao Nian.

Xu Qian’s intuition told her that Qiao Nian had definitely not given Lu Zhu a blood transfusion. Everyone else was lying.

Why was Qiao Nian unwilling to transfuse blood to Lu Zhu?

She remembered that before she left the operating theater, Qiao Nian had even vowed to donate blood.

Li Na had said as much outside.

Xu Qian felt that this matter was not that simple. There must be some unspeakable secret.

With this thought in mind, Xu Qian silently put the blood donation file back and pretended not to know anything as she left the operating theater.

After half an hour, Xu Qian felt that it was time to change Song Yue’s dressing, so she took the medicine to Song Yue’s ward.

At this moment, Song Yue was lying on the bed, pale and colorless. Even so, it could not hide her beauty.

Xu Qian looked away enviously. If only she was so good-looking.

Previously, when she donated blood, Gu Zhou even suggested that she drain Song Yue’s blood to provide blood for Lu Zhu.

If Song Yue’s blood was really sucked dry, she would definitely die.

She didn’t know what Song Yue had done to offend Gu Zhou, but she was almost tortured so badly.

Fortunately, Gu Zhou did not draw Song Yue’s blood.

Song Yue had also undergone a surgery. Now, as long as Song Yue had a good rest, she would be fine.

However, Song Yue’s uterus had been destroyed. Her body seemed to have been poisoned before. Although the poison had been detoxified, it was still very harmful to her body.
