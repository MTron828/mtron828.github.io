727 Stop Right There!

Seeing that Song Yu had no objections, Matriarch Lu nodded. Just as she was about to agree, she recalled what Jiang Yue had done previously and said solemnly, “That child, Jiang Yue, might have placed something in Song Yu’s room that can hurt you. Do you really want to go take a look?”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Matriarch Lu, don’t worry. I’ll definitely be especially careful and protect myself.”

Lu Rao thought of Jiang Yue’s vicious methods and said, “I’ll go with you!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Rao’s words, she looked at him intently. She nodded warmly and said, “Thank you.”

“My pleasure.” Lu Rao smiled at Qiao Nian.

With a faint smile on her face, Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Lu and said respectfully and politely, “Matriarch Lu, we’ll go over now.”

When Matriarch Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded. “Then go. Be careful when the time comes. Don’t get injured.”

Song Yu’s gaze landed on Matriarch Lu’s face. She said softly, “Grandma, I’ll bring Miss Qiao over.”

“Yes!” Matriarch Lu patted the back of Song Yu’s hand gently.

Song Yu let go of Matriarch Lu’s hand and walked towards Qiao Nian. She smiled and said, “Miss Qiao, please follow me.”

“Thank you for your trouble, Miss Song.” Qiao Nian thanked her.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Song Yu smiled and shook her head. “Miss Qiao, just call me Song Yu from now on!”

Song Yu and Qiao Nian walked in front, while Lu Rao followed behind them. At this moment, Gu Zhou also followed.

Lu Nian subconsciously followed.

Matriarch Lu understood why Gu Zhou had followed her. After all, Qiao Nian was Gu Zhou’s wife.

Why did Lu Nian want to follow her?

What did this have to do with Lu Nian?

Matriarch Lu stopped Lu Nian without hesitation. “Second Brother, where are you going?”

Only then did Lu Nian realize that his actions were a little strange in Matriarch Lu’s eyes.

He stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Matriarch Lu. “I want to follow her and take a look. She might need my help!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, she turned to look at him.

Song Yu, who was beside Qiao Nian, also looked at Lu Nian. She lowered her gaze slightly, understanding that Second Brother really cared about Qiao Nian.

Matriarch Lu recalled that at the dining table, Lu Nian had been picking up food for Qiao Nian. Now, her expression instantly darkened. She said sternly, “Stop right there!”

Lu Nian stopped reluctantly.

Matriarch Lu felt that Lu Nian really couldn’t tell how close they were.

However, Lu Nian had always treated Qiao Nian so well. What if Gu Zhou suspected that Qiao Nian had an improper relationship with Lu Nian?

The reason why the Gu and Lu families could get along so well was firstly because both families knew their limits. Secondly, everyone knew each other’s taboos.

Matriarch Lu had also heard from Matriarch Gu how much Gu Zhou liked Qiao Nian. If Lu Nian interfered and ruined the marriage, that would be a huge problem.

Lu Nian walked to Matriarch Lu’s side, his eyes lowered, looking unhappy.

Seeing that Qiao Nian and the others had left and that there were no outsiders around, Matriarch Lu said, “Don’t get so close to Nian Nian in the future.”

Lu Qi stood at the side in silence, but she also liked Sister Qiao Nian a lot. However, Second Brother had really gone too far this time.

Previously, she didn’t know what relationship Sister Qiao Nian had with Gu Zhou, but now she understood. The two of them were a couple. Why would Second Brother go up with them? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Seeing that Lu Nian was silent, Matriarch Lu thought that he did not take her words to heart at all. She asked, “Did you hear what I said?”
