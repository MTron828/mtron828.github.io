Gu Zhou’s phone rang. He took it out and glanced at it. It was a message from Qiao Nian, probably about Grandma being in a bad mood.

His Adam’s apple bobbed.

For some reason, he recalled how Qiao Nian had gently blown on the gauze last night when she was changing it for him.

He could sense Qiao Nian’s meticulous care for him.

After marrying into the Gu family, she seemed to have no other requests.

She had done too much for him and the Gu family. If it weren’t for Grandma’s request, she wouldn’t have been in danger when she was in MY.

Gu Zhou replied, “I’ll be there in a while.” Then, he put his phone away.

Qiao Nian was really good!

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi. His gaze was gentle, and his voice softened. “Little Qi, you’re still young. You can’t think clearly, so don’t think about it for the time being.”

Gu Qi’s eyes turned red. He asked worriedly, “Will Auntie leave?”

“She’s Dad’s secretary. She still has to work for Dad. She won’t leave for the time being,” Gu Zhou said softly.

When Gu Qi heard that Qiao Nian wouldn’t be leaving for the time being, he heaved a sigh of relief and nodded.

Actually, Gu Qi had another question for his father. In his opinion, his father was much smarter than him.

If he only found his mommy when he grew up to be as old as Auntie, could he let Auntie be his mommy first?

No, no!

If Mommy came back and Auntie had to leave, Auntie would definitely be sad.

Would Mommy be sad too?

No!

He should think about finding Mommy sooner!

That’s right. Perhaps he would find Mommy tomorrow!

In Matriarch Gu’s room.

While pouring water, Qiao Nian sent Gu Zhou a message before handing the cup to Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu looked much more pale than before. She sat by the window. The autumn leaves had fallen, and the sunlight shone on her, making her look even more lonely.

Holding a teacup, Qiao Nian walked over to Matriarch Gu and sat down. “Grandma.”

Matriarch Gu took the teacup and took a sip. Only then did her body warm up. She placed the teacup on the coffee table. “This is Ah Zhou and his brother when they were young.”

Qiao Nian leaned over to take a look. In the photo, Gu Zhou looked to be only six or seven years old. Beside him was a boy slightly taller than him.

The two of them looked very similar. Qiao Nian thought that this should be Gu Zhou’s eldest brother!

She had heard that the eldest young master of the Gu family was missing.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. With the Gu family’s capabilities, the eldest young master of the Gu family had actually gone missing. It seemed that the eldest young master had left on his own accord.

“He’s Ah Zhou’s older brother, Gu Cheng.”

Qiao Nian knew that Matriarch Gu wanted the Moon Goddess because she wanted to know more about Gu Cheng.

She was an atheist, but she had thought of using the Moon Goddess to take a look at her dead child. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, she still controlled herself. When she saw Matriarch Gu, she had already guessed the answer.

Matriarch Gu gently caressed Gu Cheng’s face in the photo. She sighed heavily and said, “The Moon Goddess has already turned red, but I still haven’t seen him. I’ll have to trouble you to make a trip to MY.”

“Grandma, it’s fine,” Qiao Nian said softly. Her gaze was still on the photo.

In the photo, Gu Zhou’s expression was dark. He did not smile at all, as if he was living in a dark hell.

However, Gu Cheng was different. There was a faint smile on his face and his eyes were mature. He looked like someone who didn’t like to reveal his emotions.

This gaze was a little familiar. For a moment, Qiao Nian couldn’t remember where she had seen it before.

“Nian Nian, do you think he’s still alive?” Matriarch Gu turned to look at Qiao Nian. Her eyes were red-rimmed and filled with fatigue.

Qiao Nian’s heart ached a little when she saw this. The smell of blood still lingered in the air, so she couldn’t answer Matriarch Gu’s question. Instead, she comforted her. “Grandma, if Brother were at home, he definitely wouldn’t want to see you so sad.”
