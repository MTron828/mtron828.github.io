882 Incomprehension

The current Gu Qi had already walked out of that dark life and was gradually communicating more with others.

What Qiao Nian hoped for the most now was that Xiao Shi wouldn’t live in the past forever. She hoped that Xiao Shi could be lively and cheerful forever. She hoped to leave a beautiful image of Song Man in Xiao Shi’s heart. That way, Xiao Shi would be much happier.

After all, she did not want Xiao Shi to go to the extreme like Song Man.

The fact that she had swallowed more than half a bottle of sleeping pills proved that she would really go to the extreme.

!!

Qiao Nian comforted Xiao Shi a few more times and finally coaxed her to sleep.

This time, Xiao Shi did not frown in her sleep, proving that she did not have any more nightmares.

Qiao Nian covered Xiao Shi with the blanket and walked towards the window.

Song Man had jumped down from this window just now.

Qiao Nian had never understood why Song Man insisted on jumping off a building.

Gu Zhou had clearly said that he would not pursue Song Man’s matter.

However, Song Man still jumped down without hesitation.

Previously, Song Man had thought of ways to enter the Gu family with Xiao Shi. That meant that Song Man wanted a better life.

Although there was a mistake now and it was impossible for Song Man to enter the Gu family, the Gu family would definitely give Song Man a large sum of money.

Song Man could still live a carefree life, so why did she have to die?

Could it be that Song Man had always wanted Gu Zhou?

If Song Man really wanted Gu Zhou, she should have pretended to be pitiful in front of him. She shouldn’t have said anything harsh.

In the past five years, Song Man had lived in Hai Cheng with Xiao Shi. According to Xiao Shi, their lives had been very difficult.

Qiao Nian could tell that Xiao Shi had a hard time. She had to work every day.

However, Song Man’s life was not hard. She did not do any chores.

That left only one possibility.

Song Man did not want them to know who Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s biological mother were.

This matter was actually very simple. Gu Zhou had promised not to pursue Song Man’s matter, so Song Man could live a happy and stable life. Even if they found out who the mother of the child was, it initially had nothing to do with Song Man.

Could it be that if Song Man died, they wouldn’t investigate her past?

Song Man was too naive.

At this moment, Gu Zhou pushed the door open.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou. Seeing Gu Zhou gesture for her to come out, she walked out.

Qiao Nian walked out and looked at Gu Zhou uneasily. She asked, “Has the matter been settled? Did the police contact Song Man’s family?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s question, he frowned slightly and said solemnly, “The police have only found out that Song Man has been living in Hai Cheng for the past five years and hasn’t interacted with any outsiders. However, the police have said that they will continue to investigate Song Man. If there are any new clues, they will tell us!”

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly.

If she wasn’t wrong, Song Man should have known long ago that Xiao Shi’s father was Gu Zhou.

Why hadn’t Song Man brought Xiao Shi to An City in the past? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

What exactly was Song Man doing?

Qiao Nian was a little glad now. If she wasn’t a medical student, she might not have noticed anything wrong with the paternity test report. Then, Song Man would naturally become Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s biological mother.

“How is Xiao Shi now?” Gu Zhou asked.

“Her emotions are still unstable. She just woke up once, and now she’s asleep again.” Thinking of Xiao Shi’s state, Qiao Nian frowned again. She wondered if Xiao Shi would really listen to her comforting words.

Gu Zhou nodded. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s furrowed brow. He reached out and gently smoothed her brows.

Qiao Nian’s expression faltered. She looked up at Gu Zhou and inadvertently met those deep eyes.

His gaze was very gentle.

Before Qiao Nian could regain her senses, Gu Zhou had already retracted his hand.

“You’ve worked hard!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s gentle voice and looking into his gentle eyes, Qiao Nian recalled the first time she had seen him.

At that time, Gu Zhou had been wary of her, as if she had been sent by someone else to deal with the Gu family. Gu Zhou’s eyes were very cold. Being stared at by Gu Zhou was like being stared at by the Grim Reaper.
