Chapter 165 Goodwill

“I think Jiang Yue is more important to Matriarch Gu. It’s only when educating their own flesh and blood do parents show no mercy.”

“I really didn’t expect Jiang Yue to steal someone else’s gown!”

“No wonder the gown she’s wearing seems a little strange!”

“We’ve all been fooled by her innocent appearance. We really thought that Professor Qiao was trying to snatch her gown!”

Jiang Yue’s face grew paler and paler as she listened to the sarcastic comments around her. She clenched her fists tightly, swaying on the spot.

Qiao Nian was very worried that Matriarch Gu’s heart disease would flare up again. Hurriedly, she rubbed Matriarch Gu’s back gently and said in a comforting voice, “Grandma, don’t be angry anymore. Your health is the most important thing. Why didn’t you tell me beforehand that you were coming?”

Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian carefully. Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t seem to be angry at all even after her gown had been stolen, Matriarch Gu blamed herself even more. She said uneasily, “I stayed up all night yesterday because I hoped that both of you would be able to wear the most perfect gowns here today.”

One by one, Jiang Yue’s tears fell without a sound, falling onto the diamond pieces embedded in the gown. She felt as if the gown she was wearing was mocking her.

Qiao Nian was very touched by Matriarch Gu’s words.

She disliked Jiang Yue greatly. If it weren’t for Jiang Yue’s vanity, Grandma’s good intentions wouldn’t have been ruined.

Matriarch Gu gave a soft sigh and said, “I knew that both of you would be going on stage to give a speech. How could I not have attended such a momentous event? I was just too tired, so I asked Zhao Qian to bring the gowns over first. I never expected such a situation to happen. If I had known this would happen, I would have left early on my own.”

As Matriarch Gu finished speaking, her gaze inadvertently fell on Jiang Yue, who was still standing at the side. She frowned and said, “Why are you still standing there? Hurry up and change out of the gown! Look at the state of you! Wearing someone else’s gown…”

Jiang Yue looked at Matriarch Gu in disbelief. She had not expected Matriarch Gu to be so insistent on changing her gown.

Jiang Yue’s heart sank, and she felt a wave of hurt. Biting her lip, she hesitated for a long while before saying, “Fine, I’ll take it off. But even so, this gown can only be worn once. She can’t wear it again for the rest of her life!”

As Jiang Yue spoke, she looked resentfully at Qiao Nian.

When Matriarch Gu heard Jiang Yue’s words, her temper flared up again. She had initially wanted to protect Jiang Yue’s dignity to some extent, but her anger had now extinguished her rationality. “Don’t tell me you think you’re the first person to wear this gown!”

When Jiang Yue heard this, her heart skipped a beat. She felt a chill run down her spine, and an ominous feeling rose in her heart. She watched as Matriarch Gu took out her phone.

Matriarch Gu pulled up the photographs she had taken of Qiao Nian on her phone. She handed the phone to Jiang Yue and said coldly, “You’re wrong there. You’re the one who’s wearing someone else’s gown.”

Many people had already gathered around. One by one, they leaned forward and looked at Matriarch Gu’s phone curiously.

In the photograph, Qiao Nian was wearing the diamond-encrusted gown, standing elegantly by a window. SHe was bathed in sunlight, and her entire body was glowing bright gold. Even her hair was shining.

When everyone saw this photograph, they were all stunned!

Qiao Nian was like a fairy, while Jiang Yue was like a servant waiting on a fairy.

They were wearing the same gown, yet the resulting effects were like night and day.

Jiang Yue’s heart sank to her stomach. She looked at the photograph in disbelief.

She had known that she and Qiao Nian would look different wearing this gown, but she had never expected the difference to be so overwhelmingly great. Qiao Nian looked like she belonged in heaven, while Jiang Yue looked plain and ordinary.

Jiang Yue’s mind was in a mess.

Matriarch Gu retracted her phone and said in mild annoyance, “Take off that gown now. You have to know that a gown can only be worn once, and can only be loyal to one owner. Change into the other gown.”

With great foresight, Zhao Qian took out the other gown from the box. This gown stunned everyone present.
