Su Xue couldn’t breathe from Qiao Nian’s words, and her expression grew uglier and uglier. If she had known this would happen, she would have thrown this little b*tch further away, never to return.

Back then, she was too kind.

Qiao Nian said eloquently, “Let me calculate now. The one million yuan from back then should be three million yuan now!”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she took out a card from her bag and placed it on the coffee table. Smiling at Su Xue, she said, “You only have five minutes to consider. If I don’t have an additional three million yuan in my account, we’ll go to the police station to discuss your fraud!”

Back then, in order to take away a million yuan privately, Su Xue adopted a child, but in the end, she abandoned that child in the mountains and forests.

Even if the law couldn’t punish Su Xue, Su Xue would still be criticized by everyone. Su Xue would also be expelled from high society. There would probably be no place for Su Xue in An City anymore.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, her face turned pale with fear.

She didn’t understand how Qiao Nian had calculated it. What kind of algorithm had one million yuan turned into three million yuan in the blink of an eye?

She said that it had been more than twenty years since he had adopted Qiao Nian. However, that place was a poor village. What happened more than twenty years ago would definitely not leave any evidence.

Even if she had told Qiao Nian that she had accepted a cheque for a million yuan, there was no evidence. Qiao Nian couldn’t do anything to her.

Even if this matter reached the police station, there would be no problem.

However, what Su Xue was most worried about was that if this matter blew up, Qiao Shan would also know that she had received money back then. Perhaps he would find out that she had been having an affair.

Qiao Shan was no longer willing to believe her because she had cheated on him.

It had not been easy for her to ease the tension between her and Qiao Shan, so she could not let Qiao Shan find out about the past.

She still wanted to be Madam Qiao again. As the saying went, old people were better than new people. She could only live a good life with Qiao Shan.

Besides, she couldn’t bear to part with her two children.

Although Su Xue was unwilling to transfer money to Qiao Nian, she had no choice but to fork out this sum of money. She wanted to get rid of Qiao Nian as soon as possible. All of this was so that she could marry Qiao Shan again.

Qiao Nian sat there calmly. Seeing Su Xue transfer the money eagerly, she frowned slightly.

Strange. How could someone as stingy as Su Xue transfer money to her so readily?

The sun had risen from the west.

Could it be that Su Xue was hiding something important?

Before Qiao Nian could think clearly, her phone rang. She took it out and saw that there was an additional three million yuan in her account.

Su Xue handed the bank card to Qiao Nian. Frowning, she hurriedly said, “I’ve already said everything I needed to say. I’ve returned the one million yuan with interest. We’re no longer related. We don’t owe each other anything now. Hurry up and leave. I don’t want to see you at home anymore!”

“We don’t owe each other anything?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly, tapping her fingers on the coffee table. With a cold expression, she questioned, “The three million yuan was mine to begin with, and you’ve ruined my life for the past twenty years. Not only that, but my two children are also dead! How can this be called not owing each other anything?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was stunned. She frowned in confusion.

Back then, Qiao Nian had clearly given birth to three children. Why did she only say that she had given birth to two?

No, Qiao Nian had just said that two children were already dead.

Could it be that the remaining child was still alive?

At the thought of this, Su Xue frowned and said, “Actually, when you gave birth back then, I…”

Before Su Xue could finish speaking, she heard footsteps at the door. She turned around and saw Qiao Shan walking in.

Oh my god!

Why was Qiao Shan back now?

Su Xue also glanced at the time on her phone. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Wasn’t he getting off work in forty minutes?

Su Xue had wanted to send Qiao Nian away before Qiao Shan arrived, but Qiao Shan had returned so early. She couldn’t continue talking to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue in confusion. Just now, Su Xue seemed to know about her childbirth.
