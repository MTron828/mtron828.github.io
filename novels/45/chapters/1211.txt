1212 Is It Suitable?

Was it really appropriate to discuss that kind of thing in public?

Qiao Nian felt that everyone around her was looking at them. She struggled for a moment, wanting to get off Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou reached out and gripped Qiao Nian’s waist tightly, his fingertips gently brushing across her waist.

That itchy feeling almost made Qiao Nian exclaim. If she screamed, she would probably attract more attention. Helpless, she could only hug Gu Zhou’s neck obediently.

Hugging Qiao Nian, Gu Zhou walked into the hotel and into the elevator. There was no one else in the elevator. Just as the elevator door was about to close, he lowered his head and kissed Qiao Nian’s lips without hesitation.

He did not close his eyes. From the corner of his eye, he looked at Jiang Chi not far away.

Gu Zhou kissed Qiao Nian’s lips lightly, his gaze landing outside the elevator.

Qiao Nian was a little shy. Seeing Gu Zhou looking at the door, she subconsciously looked over and saw Jiang Chi standing outside the elevator with a malicious expression.

In the next second, the elevator door closed.

The elevator rose slowly.

Qiao Nian glared at Gu Zhou, but Gu Zhou acted as if nothing had happened. He kept watching the elevator floor rise.

When the elevator stopped, the doors opened. Gu Zhou carried Qiao Nian towards his room.

“Did you do that on purpose just now?” Qiao Nian felt a little helpless against Gu Zhou’s childish declaration of sovereignty.

She had no other thoughts about Jiang Chi. Gu Zhou was really declaring his sovereignty all the time.

“You’re looking at him again.” Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian. His eyes were as gentle as lake water, making one want to sink into them. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qiao Nian blinked and came back to her senses. She said helplessly, “You were looking at him just now. I was just following your gaze. I didn’t want to look at him on purpose. You were clearly looking at him on purpose.”

Gu Zhou didn’t look too good. Qiao Nian recalled that Gu Zhou had found out that she was Mr. K. She wondered how Gu Zhou would bully her when she returned to her room. She said coquettishly, “I’ll only look at you next time, okay?”

When Qiao Nian said the last few words, her voice rose slightly, as if she was acting spoiled.

Gu Zhou wasn’t angry to begin with. When he heard Qiao Nian’s voice, his eyes were filled with possessiveness. He couldn’t help but hug Qiao Nian tightly. “Mrs. Gu, are you seducing me?”

Gu Zhou pretended to be innocent, like a little white rabbit. Instead, the man-eating person had become Qiao Nian.

Forget it. She was in the wrong today. She would just go along with Gu Zhou.

“Of course I only wheedled with Mr. Gu.”

As he spoke, Gu Zhou had already walked to the door. Qiao Nian reached out and opened it. Gu Zhou carried Qiao Nian in and kicked the door shut.

As soon as they entered, Gu Zhou placed Qiao Nian on the ground, pressed her against the wall, and kissed her without hesitation.

Qiao Nian wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck and swiftly kicked her high heels to the other side. When their lips parted, she jumped onto Gu Zhou without hesitation, wrapping her legs around his waist.

Sensing Qiao Nian’s initiative, Gu Zhou kissed her lips again. He walked to the bed and fell onto it with Qiao Nian, pulling her tightly into his arms. His voice was hoarse. “Honey.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and tucked her hair behind her ear. Smiling, she said, “Yes?”

“You’re so beautiful.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he gently kissed Qiao Nian’s forehead. He turned over and lay on the bed, letting Qiao Nian lie on top of him.

Qiao Nian wanted to get off him, but Gu Zhou stubbornly hugged her. When she met Gu Zhou’s burning and loving gaze, she couldn’t help but blush. She covered her face and looked to the other side.

Gu Zhou reached out and pulled Qiao Nian’s hand down. In a low voice, he asked, “Are you shy?”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze, still too embarrassed to look at Gu Zhou’s face. This man was too evil. He clearly knew that she was shy, but he still bullied her on purpose.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw the smile in Gu Zhou’s eyes. She lowered her head and kissed Gu Zhou’s lips.
