That was why she had written the word Chuan behind that photo as her alias.

However, these things were already in the past. She didn’t want to have anything to do with Qiao Yu anymore.

This was also why she had been unwilling to appear as an artist.

Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly and there was a dark glint in them.

Others might not know, but he understood what Chuan meant.

Early this morning, before Qiao Nian woke up, Qiao Yu called again.

At that time, Gu Zhou had realized that Qiao Nian had only taken a glance at the caller ID. She had immediately hung up and gone back to sleep.

Qiao Yu…

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes and the corners of his eyes curving up slightly. He exuded a dangerous aura.

The others sensed Gu Zhou’s aura and retreated in fear.

“Chen Qing.”

“Second Young Master, what can I do for you?” Chen Qing walked up to Gu Zhou and asked respectfully.

“The Qiao Corporation is a little too free!” Gu Zhou gave Chen Qing an intriguing look.

Chen Qing naturally understood what Gu Zhou meant. Second Young Master didn’t like the Qiao Corporation, so he said, “Some time ago, someone tore the Qiao Corporation apart. In addition, Qiao Shan spent a month in prison. The Qiao Corporation is on thin ice. However, the Qiao Corporation has been developing well in Qiao Yu’s hands. His career has been thriving.”

“Yes?”

Chen Qing continued, “Qiao Yu has taken a liking to the land in An City’s North District. That piece of land is in a good location, and it’s suitable for the construction of a villa. As long as we wait for the funds to return, the Qiao Corporation’s losses will be made up. The profits alone can reach two to three billion!”

Gu Zhou frowned and said in a low voice, “I think that piece of land is more suitable for an orphanage!”

Hearing this, Chen Qing was stunned.

Many feng shui masters said that that piece of land was a treasure of good feng shui. The people who lived on that piece of land would be rich and well-liked. If they used it to build a villa, it would be especially easy to make money.

However, it would be different if an orphanage was built.

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly, his voice tinged with joy. “Give the order now. I want that piece of land.”

Chen Qing looked shocked.

Oh my god, that was a treasure land with good feng shui. It was worth hundreds of millions. It would have been fine if Young Master wanted to build a villa area, but he was planning to build an orphanage!

Second Young Master was deliberately making things difficult for Qiao Yu.

Second Young Master was so arrogant. He knew how to play! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Chen Qing immediately nodded. “Yes.”

He heaved a sigh of relief. Since Second Young Master had already arranged for him to do other things, it meant that he no longer had to put up the tiles.

Qiao Nian walked in front. As there were more people at the airport exit, it was noisy. She didn’t hear Gu Zhou’s plan.

Although the people around her were praising her, when she heard them talk about her, she couldn’t help but feel frustrated. This was because this alias had something to do with Qiao Yu.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and sent Qin Chuan a WeChat message. “What do you think we should do with the land north of An City?”

“Of course build villas. That piece of land is now very popular!” Qin Chuan replied instantly.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. She did a simple calculation. Based on the current situation, it was more cost-effective to build a villa there. It would also allow the funds to be recovered quickly.

After Qiao Yu returned to An City, he began to pursue various careers.

She had never expected that while Qiao Shan was in prison, Qiao Yu had already begun to build up his business empire.

Moreover, the shares of the Qiao Corporation were constantly rising. They were ranked 58th in An City.

It was time to start suppressing Qiao Yu.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. She immediately sent a message. “I want this piece of land. I’ll definitely get it.”

The Qiao family must be very pleased with themselves now. What she had to do was to let the Qiao family walk step by step into a dead end.
