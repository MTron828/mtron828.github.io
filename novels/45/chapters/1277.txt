1278 I am your Mommy

Xiao Bao hugged Qiao Nian’s neck and buried his head in her chest. Smelling her scent, his eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

This was Mommy’s smell.

Mommy smelled as good as he had imagined.

“Mommy.” Xiao Bao’s voice choked. “I’m Xiao Bao!”

He was clearly a man who could protect his mommy. He didn’t know why he wanted to cry when he saw his mommy.

Feeling the warmth of Xiao Bao’s body and smelling his fragrance, Qiao Nian’s tears fell uncontrollably. She let go of Xiao Bao slightly and lowered her head to plant a kiss on his forehead.

It was true.

Her gut feeling was right. This was her and Gu Zhou’s child.

“Xiao Bao.” Qiao Nian hugged him tightly again and said softly, “I’m your Mommy.”

Xiao Bao wiped his tears with his small hand. His father had said that a man could not cry. A crying man could not protect his mommy.

He felt so happy that he could finally hug his mommy instead of looking at her photos all day.

Gu Zhou walked up to them and pulled Qiao Nian and Xiao Bao into his arms.

Xiao Bao sensed Gu Zhou’s arrival. He looked at him and hesitated for a moment before calling out, “Second Daddy, I’m Xiao Bao!”

Gu Zhou was slightly stunned.

Why did he call him “Second Daddy”? Shouldn’t he call him “Daddy” directly?

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Bao’s words, a trace of confusion flashed in her eyes. She gently voiced Gu Zhou’s doubts.

Xiao Bao’s lips curved up slightly, and a bright smile appeared on his face. He said happily, “Xiao Bao has a daddy, so I can’t call him Daddy. I can only call him Second Daddy!”

Although Xiao Bao’s words were unclear, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian both understood. Xiao Bao called another man “Daddy”, so he could only call Gu Zhou “Second Daddy”.

Xiao Bao was obedient, and his eyes were filled with stars. He said seriously, “He’s the best daddy in the world, and the person who treats Xiao Bao the best.”

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou exchanged glances. Qiao Nian asked gently, “Are you talking about Mr. Chen?”

Xiao Bao opened his mouth slightly and was about to speak when he recalled what Uncle Feng had told him previously.

Uncle Feng often said not to tell strangers that his father was Mr. Chen.

Strangers.

Mommy and Second Daddy shouldn’t be considered strangers, right? They were all family!

With this thought in mind, Xiao Bao nodded solemnly. “Yes, but don’t tell anyone about this! If bad people find out, it will be bad for Daddy and Xiao Bao!”

Qiao Nian smiled. Previously, Xiao Bao had been by Mr. Chen’s side. It was normal for Xiao Bao to treat Mr. Chen as his father.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. Unfortunately, Gu Zhou could only be his second daddy.

Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Bao deeply.

Xiao Bao’s beautiful eyes flickered as he looked at Gu Zhou.

The father and son looked at each other. Neither of them spoke.

After a long while, Gu Zhou asked, “Can you call me Daddy directly?”

Xiao Bao pouted and shook his head stubbornly. “No.”

Xiao Bao’s eyes gradually dimmed. He said sadly, “If I call you Daddy, won’t I be disrespecting my daddy?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xiao Bao pouted and finally said with certainty, “I can’t disrespect my daddy!”

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Bao in her arms and her lips curved up slightly. This child was quite stubborn.

Gu Zhou reached out and rubbed Xiao Bao’s head. He said helplessly, “As long as you’re happy!”

When Xiao Bao heard Gu Zhou’s words, his eyes lit up. He felt that his little father was a good person and immediately agreed. “Okay!”

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Bao’s milky voice and her heart softened. She couldn’t help but kiss Xiao Bao’s face again. This little face was extremely soft. She couldn’t help but kiss it again.

Smiling, Xiao Bao wrapped his arms around Qiao Nian’s neck, his eyes filled with joy.

He liked Mommy so much.

Qiao Nian looked into Xiao Bao’s eyes, and her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She pursed her lips tightly.
