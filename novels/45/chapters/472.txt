At that moment, a nurse walked in.

Nurse Xu Qian smiled and said, “There are three all-purpose O-bloods in our hospital’s on-call room. There’s also a girl who came with you. She also has type A blood and can help donate blood.”

In Qiao Nian’s memory, other than her, everyone who came today should be men.

“By the way, Mr. Gu also said that if it’s really not enough, we can just drain her blood dry.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she instantly remembered.

The girl the nurse was talking about should be Song Yue.

If Song Yue had not colluded with Jiang Chi, Lu Zhu would not have become like this.

When Lu Zhu woke up, she would hand Song Yue over to him.

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t want Lu Zhu to use Song Yue’s blood. Song Yue’s blood was too dirty. Just thinking about it made her feel disgusted.

At this thought, Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on the nurse’s face. “Use the blood of your hospital staff. After the blood transfusion, I’ll compensate them.”

“There’s no need. Mr. Gu has already given the gratitude money. Now, they are also doing the cross-match. If there’s no problem, we can use it directly,” Xu Qian said with a smile.

The remaining people had received their bonuses, so they were silent now.

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “It’s good that it has already been arranged and the blood transfusion has already begun.”

Xu Qian looked at the hanging blood bag and knew what to do.

Now that the problem of the blood transfusion had been resolved, all that was left was to retrieve the bullet.

Whether Lu Zhu could survive or not could only be left to fate.

The chief surgeon walked to Lu Zhu’s side and immediately unbuttoned his clothes to prepare for disinfection.

Lu Zhu’s wound seemed to have started to worsen. Qiao Nian stood at the side and watched.

She was anxious and uneasy, but she didn’t dare disturb the doctor.

She still did not know what relationship Lu Zhu had with her, but she was already worried about his safety.

The blood bond was suffocating her now.

Lu Zhu, I hope you’re fine!

Qiao Nian stood at the side, feeling the air freeze. It was getting harder and harder to breathe. Then, her vision darkened.

The chief surgeon carefully removed the bullet with his tool.

Even though Lu Zhu had been injected with anesthetic, he still groaned in pain and frowned tightly.

Suddenly, the machine at the side made an urgent beeping sound. This meant that Lu Zhu’s situation was not good.

Blood spurted instantly.

The chief surgeon frowned. There was a hint of urgency in his words as he said, “Hemorrhage! Prepare for blood transfusion!”

Qiao Nian’s face turned pale, and her eyes instantly turned red.

Bag after bag of blood was poured into Lu Zhu’s body, but his chest was still bleeding.

At this rate, the hospital would not have enough blood!

Qiao Nian looked at the remaining six hundred milliliters of blood. Sweat dripped down her face.

A nurse stepped forward and hurriedly wiped Qiao Nian’s sweat. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The chief surgeon anxiously helped Lu Zhu stop the bleeding.

Qiao Nian saw that the situation was critical. Lu Zhu’s heart seemed to have stopped beating for a moment. If he was still bleeding so much, there was probably no way to stop it. All the attending doctor was doing now was to let Lu Zhu die a little later.

Qiao Nian knew that if this continued, Lu Zhu would definitely die.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath. Finally, she gritted her teeth and said, “Give him a suture!”

When the chief surgeon heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes were filled with surprise. He looked at Qiao Nian in shock. “This won’t do. The bleeding hasn’t stopped yet. What if the bleeding affects the other blood vessels during the stitching? Wouldn’t that be…”

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t know if this would work or not. However, this was the only way. She pursed her lips and said solemnly, “If this continues, it’s impossible to save him. The only thing we can do now is to do as I say. Continue the blood transfusion first, then stitch him up!”

The chief surgeon frowned, his face pale with fear. He knew that what he was doing was futile, but he still hoped for a miracle.

However, as time passed, Lu Zhu’s life was also ending.
