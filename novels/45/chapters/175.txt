Chapter 176 Encounter

Wang Miao clenched her fists tightly, biting down on her lower lip.

Five years ago. He had paid their family a visit. Back then, she had fallen in love with him at first sight.

When her older sister had died in childbirth, she had been very upset. However, seeing how upset he was, she yearned to have died in her sister’s stead.

She had heard from Chen Qing that he seemed to have fallen into someone’s trap during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Because of that, he had spent a long time searching for the woman he had spent a night with. That woman was her older sister.

Seeing how devoted he was to his sister, she had sworn to herself that she would marry him in the future.

She wanted to stand by his side and take care of his family on behalf of her sister, so that he would never be sad again.

For all these years, she had worked hard at her studies, and tried to grow up as fast as she could. She wanted to become more outstanding. Only then would she be qualified to marry him and heal his broken heart.

However, Wang Miao had never expected to be one step too late.

How could he forget her older sister?

How could he marry another woman?

At the thought, Wang Miao felt even worse.

Wang Miao walked downstairs. Before long, she saw Qiao Nian holding the materials one would need to make a blessing bag.

Wang Miao’s expression faltered slightly. Her eyes were red as she stared at the items in Qiao Nian’s hand. Her brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

Seeing that something was wrong with Wang Miao’s expression, Qiao Nian expressed some polite concern. “Are you feeling unwell? I can help you take your pulse if you’d like.”

Wang Miao shook her head. Her voice trembled as she spoke, “I… I just didn’t sleep well last night. Are you going to make a blessing bag?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded. She looked down at the silk, needles, and thread in her hand, thinking that she should send the materials to the temple for a longer period of time. The materials could absorb the good fortune of the temple, and she would make the blessing bag then.

“Young… Young Madam, you’re such a good person.” Wang Miao gazed at Qiao Nian, sounding dazed. “No wonder Second Young Master likes you so much.”

Qiao Nian thought to herself, “Young lady, are you blind? How can he possibly like me?”

Qiao Nian felt that if she wasn’t skilled at medicine, Gu Zhou would have left her for dead long ago.

Like her?

This was utterly impossible!

Qiao Nian gave a perfunctory response. “If you didn’t sleep well, rest early today. I’ll head out first. I have other things to do today.”

With that, Qiao Nian turned and walked out.

Wang Miao stood rooted to the ground, staring at Qiao Nian’s retreating back. Her eyes grew even redder. Second Young Master must have known that Qiao Nian was making a blessing bag for him, which was why he wasn’t willing to take hers.

Wang Miao looked down at the blessing bag in her hand. It was embroidered with lotus flowers. She had labored over the bag for a month before she had managed to complete the embroidery.

The lotus flowers symbolized them coming together for one hundred years of happiness. They would be together forever.

She wanted to be with Gu Zhou for the rest of her life and never be apart.

But she was well aware of the disdain in Gu Zhou’s eyes.

Wang Miao clenched the blessing bag in her hand involuntarily, her brow furrowed. She threw the blessing bag into the trash can.

Baohua Temple.

Qiao Nian went directly to the inner hall and donated some money to the temple. She then placed the silk fabric and thread she had prepared under Buddha’s knees. Then, she knelt in front of Buddha to pray for Miss Lu.

To Qiao Nian, death was like the extinguishing of a lamp. Once one died, one would no longer know anything.

The reason why living people prayed for the dead was just to seek some peace of mind. This was also a spiritual pursuit.

Qiao Nian gave three sincere kowtows before getting up.

When she was locked up in the mental hospital, she had already made up her mind to live a good life for herself.

Qiao Nian was about to leave when a girl with a bright smile walked towards her.

“Professor Qiao!” When Lu Qi saw Qiao Nian, she smiled and jogged up to her, her voice crisp. “So you believe in Buddhism too!”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
