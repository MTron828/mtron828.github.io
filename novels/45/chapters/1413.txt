1414 Marriage Proposal!

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, she stared unblinkingly at his face. After a long while, she asked tentatively, “Senior, could it be that…”

“Because…”

Lu Qi stammered for a long time, but in the end, she was too embarrassed to say the words “like me”.

“Yes, I like you because of that incident,” Qin Chuan admitted very frankly.

Lu Qi instantly turned red, like a cooked prawn. She didn’t know what to look at.

She had initially thought that Senior had saved her because of her sister. Now that Senior had lost his memory, he had mistakenly thought that the person he had saved with his life was the person he liked.

Now, it seemed that she had misunderstood. Senior Brother liked her because of what had happened in high school. He liked her sincerely. He protected her desperately because he liked her.

So it was really because he liked her.

Lu Qi recalled that she had previously called Senior Brother her Uncle. At that time, Senior seemed to mind that she called him Uncle. It seemed that Senior had already begun to plan at that time.

She didn’t know if she should say that he was infatuated, or that he was cunning.

Even though she knew that her senior brother was approaching her on purpose, her heart was beating faster and faster, as if it was about to jump out of her mouth. She could feel the sweetness in the air.

It felt good to be carefully cared for.

Lu Qi lowered her head, her eyes turning red again. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Chuan sat opposite Lu Qi. Looking at her delicate appearance, his lips curved up involuntarily. As long as he saw her and thought of her, he would feel very happy.

Her innocence and kindness made him feel the beauty of this world.

When he fell asleep last night and thought of this, he only hoped that he could remember all his memories of her when he woke up. He didn’t want to miss anything between them.

Seeing that Lu Qi was crying, Qin Chuan raised his hand and gently wiped the tears from her eyes with his fingers. “When I remember everything, I’ll thank my savior and tell you why I became a beggar.”

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in front of her and still couldn’t associate him with that little beggar. After all, the difference between the two of them was too great. She couldn’t help but laugh out loud and say, “Senior Brother, you’ve saved me a few times. It was nothing for me back then. Don’t thank me alone.”

It was nothing?

Although Qin Chuan couldn’t remember why he had become a beggar, he still remembered his feelings back then. At that time, he was completely disheartened and no longer had the desire to live.

He looked at Lu Qi in front of him and his lips curved up slightly. His phoenix-like eyes were filled with Lu Qi’s face, and a fire burned in his heart. He lowered his voice slightly and said meaningfully, “This won’t do. Of course I have to thank you properly.”

Although Lu Qi didn’t understand why Senior Brother insisted on apologizing, since he had said so, she smiled and agreed. “Yes, Senior Brother, then you have to recover as soon as possible. Only then can you remember the past.”

The gentleness in Qin Chuan’s eyes could overflow. He stared unblinkingly at Lu Qi and said in a low voice, “I still want to go to your house to propose marriage.”

Lu Qi was slightly stunned.

For some reason, the atmosphere in the room became ambiguous. Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan’s handsome face, and her heart began to race.

When Song Yu came out of the bathroom, the ward was already empty. She looked around in confusion and finally walked out of the door. Just as Song Yu walked out of the ward, she saw Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walking towards it from afar.

“Sister and Brother-in-law,” Song Yu called out in a low voice.

Gu Zhou nodded slightly in greeting.

Qiao Nian smiled at Song Yu and asked, “Where’s Qi Qi? Is she awake now?”

“She’s awake. After I came out of the bathroom, she wasn’t in her room anymore. I think Qi Qi might have gone to Mr. Qin’s room.” Song Yu walked beside Qiao Nian and said in a low voice.

When Qiao Nian heard Song Yu’s words, she was slightly stunned. She looked at Chen Qing, who was at the door of Qin Chuan’s ward.

Chen Qing walked over. “Second Young Master and Second Young Madam.”
