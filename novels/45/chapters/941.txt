942 Regret

Qiao Yu smiled self-deprecatingly. “If I grew up by your side, would I have become such a selfish person?”

“Qiao Yu, that’s not what happened. Actually, back then…” Su Xue also wanted to explain herself, but she didn’t know how to say it, because she had indeed done so much wrong.

Qiao Yu looked at the Qiao family in disappointment and said, “Fortunately, I grew up by Grandma’s side, so I’m different from you!”

Qiao Yu’s heart seemed to have been dug out. Six years ago, Qiao Nian was ruined. At that time, Qiao Nian should have been the most vulnerable and helpless. What had he done?

He had trusted Qiao Xin, which was why he had hurt Qiao Nian’s heart.

At that time, Qiao Nian was still a child who had just reached adulthood. How desperate and helpless must she have been?

Actually, at that time, part of the reason was that he didn’t know how to face Qiao Nian. He had never treated Qiao Nian as his sister, but…

Qiao Yu closed his eyes in pain. No wonder Qiao Nian had spoken in that tone when he called her back then.

From the beginning to the end, the Qiao family had let Qiao Nian down. Qiao Nian was an innocent victim.

Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Yu’s expression and roughly knew what he was thinking. He said angrily, “Are you going to criticize us for Qiao Nian’s sake, or do you want to cut ties with us?”

In the past, Qiao Shan had always been the pillar of the Qiao family. He was used to being high and mighty, but now, he was no longer that pillar. His authority was threatened. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Shan calmly and didn’t answer his question. Instead, he changed the topic and said, “After Qiao Nian left the mental hospital, she gave us a chance. You’ve always thought that Qiao Nian was just a pet, so you didn’t treat her as a human at all. Her last hope for the Qiao family has disappeared.”

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Yu’s words, he lowered his head in silence.

Su Xue didn’t dare to speak either. She didn’t want to hear the name “Qiao Nian” at all. She was very worried that her affair more than twenty years ago would be exposed.

Qiao Xin sat on the hospital bed and said unhappily, “So what? She’s just a country bumpkin…”

Before she could finish speaking, she was so frightened by Qiao Yu’s gaze that she didn’t dare to speak.

“She should have already acknowledged Lu Zhu as her family by now.” At this point, Qiao Yu’s cold gaze landed on Su Xue’s face. “According to how worried the Lu family is regarding the eldest daughter of the Lu family, what do you think the Lu family will do to the Qiao family to comfort the eldest daughter of the Lu family who they lost and found after years?”

Qiao Yu glanced at Qiao Shan and Su Xue. Seeing that their faces were pale, he continued, “Every year, the Lu family holds a death anniversary for the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Every year, they prepare clothes and jewelry for her. I heard that her things are stored in a separate villa.”

“From this, it can be seen that the Lu family really cares about the eldest daughter of the Lu family. The eldest daughter of the Lu family they have missed for more than twenty years is standing in front of them alive. Will they really not do anything?” Qiao Yu said calmly, his hand in his pocket.

Although Qiao Yu’s voice was very calm, it still frightened Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin really hadn’t thought too much about it back then. She looked at Qiao Yu, her eyes instantly turning red.

If the Qiao family was gone, her rich life would be gone too. Then, she would never be unable to live a luxurious life again.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin’s tears fell uncontrollably. “I’m sorry for implicating you. It’s all my fault…”

Seeing Qiao Xin like this, Qiao Yu no longer looked as arrogant as before. Instead, she looked more like a young lady.

No matter what, Qiao Xin was his sister, his only sister.

The coldness on Qiao Yu’s face faded a little as he said, “Don’t take matters into your own hands in the future, and don’t do anything stupid again. I’ll protect the Qiao family!”

The Qiao family was just a small family with assets in An City. They could not compare to the Lu family, which was second to none.

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Yu’s words, he looked at him with a complicated expression.

At this moment, he realized that his son had already grown up. He was no longer a child who needed protection. There was indeed something wrong with his upbringing of Qiao Nian. If Qiao Xin hadn’t always targeted Qiao Nian, and if he had asked Qiao Nian to live at home back then, would they already be on good terms with the Lu family and the Nanshan Corporation now?
