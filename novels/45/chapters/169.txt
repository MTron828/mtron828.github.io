Chapter 170 Infertility

Jiang Yue felt a chill run down her spine. She stopped in her tracks for a moment before she continued walking after the group.

Did Qiao Nian already know that Liu Yu’s uncle was investigating her?

Since Qiao Nian was so capable, did that mean that Qiao Nian also knew that she had agreed to the investigation?

Jiang Yue felt extremely uneasy. After a long while, she said, “Second Sister-in-law, did… did you misunderstand?”

“Is that so?” Qiao Nian gave Jiang Yue a meaningful look, then retracted her gaze and followed Matriarch Gu towards the door.

Jiang Yue’s brow furrowed deeper and deeper. She was now completely certain that Qiao Nian knew about those things. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Goodness, what should she do?

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned cold. She didn’t think there was any misunderstanding. Liu Yu and Jiang Yue’s reactions just now had already explained everything.

She had already heeded Grandma’s words. For Grandma’s sake, although she didn’t like Jiang Yue, she was still willing to give Jiang Yue a chance to turn over a new leaf.

She was curious. Would Jiang Yue, who often probed her and tried to trip her up behind her back, and even hired an outsider to investigate her, really be able to turn over a new leaf?

In any case, Qiao Nian didn’t believe that she would. Her eyes grew colder and colder.

When they arrived at the car, Chen Qing hurriedly opened the door to the backseat and helped Matriarch Gu into the car. Qiao Nian got in from the other side.

Just as Jiang Yue was about to get into the car, Gu Zhou stepped forward unexpectedly and closed the door of the backseat.

Jiang Yue was slightly taken aback. She saw Gu Zhou getting in the front passenger seat, and heard him instruct Chen Qing to begin driving

Just like that, the car flew past her.

Jiang Yue was utterly stunned.

Matriarch Gu sat in the backseat. Through the rearview mirror, she glimpsed Jiang Yue’s pale and helpless little face. She felt a tinge of heartache.

She had raised Jiang Yue since she was a little girl.

“Ah Zhou, Jiang Yue is alone…”

“Grandma, I have a phobia of women,” Gu Zhou said earnestly, looking back at Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu was at a loss for words.

“She can just come home with Zhao Qian,” Gu Zhou said impassively. “I won’t accept anyone of the opposite sex taking my car.”

Qiao Nian had been musing about Jiang Yue and Liu Yu. When she heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked up at him in confusion.

Was he subtly referring to her?

Was Gu Zhou trying to say that she wasn’t a woman?

Matriarch Gu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She seemed to have thought of something, and her brow furrowed deeper and deeper. “What nonsense are you spouting? Let me tell you, Nian Nian is your wife. The phobia you’re talking about can’t include her!”

Gu Zhou sat up straight and said nothing.

Matriarch Gu’s gaze once again fell on Qiao Nian’s stomach. Her frown grew deeper and deeper. After a beat, she looked at Gu Zhou with dissatisfaction and said angrily, “The two of you have been married for so long. Why hasn’t there been any news? Nian Nian’s tummy looks the same as ever. Is there something wrong with your health?”

Gu Zhou found himself speechless.

Chen Qing almost let go of the steering wheel in shock.

The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the more she felt that she was right. Frowning, she said in a considerate manner, “This won’t do. I’m worried. Let’s go to the hospital now. Go and examine your body. By the way, for this issue, which department of the hospital should you be visiting?”

Gu Zhou’s expression turned black as thunder. Annoyance flashed in his eyes, and he had to interrupt her. “Grandma, there’s nothing wrong with my health!”

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Zhou worriedly. After some hesitation, she said, “What if you’re infertile?”

It was as if Gu Zhou had turned to stone in an instant.

When Chen Qing heard this, he had to hold back his laughter. As expected of Gu Zhou’s own grandmother!

“Chen Qing, go to the hospital now!” The more Matriarch Gu spoke, the more she felt that there might be something wrong with Gu Zhou. She was extremely anxious.

“Drive home.” Gu Zhou looked a little helpless as he spoke. “We have our own way of life. Don’t let your thoughts run wild.”

“I’m not overthinking. Your health has never been good to begin with, so it’s expected that you might be infertile!” Matriarch Gu said seriously. “It’s what you’re saying that’s strange. You’re only starting to get better now, and that’s only because Nian Nian has been helping to treat your illness.”

Gu Zhou could think of nothing to say in response.
