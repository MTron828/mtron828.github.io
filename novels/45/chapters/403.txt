Chapter 404: Ignorant

Qiao Nian’s gaze made Song Yue very uncomfortable. However, now that Song Yue had left with Lu Zhu, even though she was unhappy, she still followed. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

On the plane, Qiao Nian turned off her phone and leaned lazily against her seat. She tilted her head to look out the window, and her gaze inadvertently landed on Lu Zhu’s face.

Lu Zhu’s facial features were well-defined, and his thin lips were pursed tightly, as if he was thinking about something serious.

When he was quiet and did not speak, he was like an otherworldly god that no one could disturb.

“Have you seen enough?”

Lu Zhu’s voice was cold.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. When she regained her senses, she looked away awkwardly.

For some reason, she felt that his tone sounded like Gu Zhou’s.

She hadn’t seen him since she had gotten angry at Gu Zhou last night.

Qiao Nian felt that the atmosphere was a little awkward, so she changed the topic. “Mr. Lu, when we get off the plane later, please send me to my hotel. Thank you.”

Lu Zhu tilted her head and looked at the intense gaze sitting beside her. It was as cold as ice. “I want to go there too.”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Puzzled, she asked, “Hasn’t that hotel already been fully booked? The people inside are all there to participate in the stone gambling competition three days later. Could it be that you’re also preparing to participate?”

On the other hand, when Song Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. She asked, “Why else do you think we are going there?”

......

Without even looking at Song Yue, Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu uneasily and asked, “Mr. Lu, are you doing this for the Moon Goddess?”

Lu Zhu nodded calmly and asked, “Do you have the same goal as me?”

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu’s determined expression and frowned, not saying anything.

Previously, her grandmother had told her to go to MY with Lu Zhu, saying that she could let Lu Zhu take care of her. However, she had never expected that the person taking care of her would actually become her competitor.

This was a little awkward.

She really did not expect Lu Zhu to participate in stone gambling for the Moon Goddess. Could it be that Lu Zhu also believed in the legend of the Moon Goddess?

The so-called Moon Goddess was also known as the Goddess of Thought.

The magical thing about this necklace was that it had a special ability. As long as one placed the items of the person they missed beside it, they would be able to see their current situation in about a month.

If it was a dead person, they could also see that person’s future.

It was precisely because of this rumor that the Moon Goddess necklace had become much more mysterious.

The reason why Grandma wanted this necklace was to know about Eldest Young Master Gu’s current situation.

The reason why Lu Zhu wanted this necklace was probably related to the eldest daughter of the Lu family who had died early!

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian felt a strange feeling in her heart.

She also wanted to obtain this necklace previously because she wanted to see if her child had reincarnated.

She was a medical student, so she shouldn’t have believed in ghosts and gods. However, missing her child made her feel reverence for ghosts and gods.

Qiao Nian smiled and looked at Lu Zhu calmly. “I’ll work hard to get the Moon Goddess!”

Lu Zhu wasn’t angry when he heard Qiao Nian’s words, because he could understand Old Madam Gu’s eagerness to use the Moon Goddess to find Eldest Young Master Gu.

Besides, he wouldn’t give up on the Moon Goddess necklace. Regardless of whether the rumors were true or not, he had to try.

When Song Yue heard Qiao Nian’s impudent words, a trace of disdain flashed across her eyes.

A fool was a fool.

A faint smile appeared on Song Yue’s lips. Her gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face as she said, “Miss Qiao, aren’t you a little too arrogant? Do you think it’s easy to gamble on stones? There are many people participating in the stone gambling competition this time. Even entering the finals is more difficult than ascending to the heavens! You actually dare to boast that you want to obtain the Moon Goddess. You don’t know your limits! Can you have some self-awareness?”
