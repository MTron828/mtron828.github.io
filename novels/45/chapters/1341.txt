1342 It’s good that you’re back!

“I understand.” Lu Zhu narrowed his eyes slightly. No matter who wanted to deal with his family, he would never let them off. “Let’s go in first!”

Matriarch Gu was sitting on the sofa in the living room fretting. She sighed again and again. She didn’t know if Qiao Nian would be able to bring the children back. Bai Hui had a stubborn temper and wouldn’t listen to anyone else.

“Great-grandmother!”

“Great-grandmother!”

The soft and sweet voices of the two children came from the living room door. She looked up and saw the two children walking hand in hand.

A trace of surprise flashed in Matriarch Gu’s eyes. She had been Bai Hui’s mother-in-law for more than ten years. She knew Bai Hui’s personality and knew how difficult it was to snatch someone from her!

Nian Nian was really amazing. As soon as she appeared, she actually brought the two children back! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Holding hands, Gu Qi and Xiao Shi ran to Matriarch Gu. Matriarch Gu was overjoyed. She wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes imperceptibly and reached out to hold the hands of the two children. She said happily, “Alright, alright. It’s good that you’re back!”

Xiao Shi nodded obediently.

Matriarch Gu sized up the two children carefully. They seemed to have lost a little weight. She asked worriedly, “Did… did your Grandma treat you well?”

Xiao Shi raised her head and thought about it seriously before saying, “Grandma isn’t a bad person. However, we haven’t interacted much because after Grandma brought us back, she went to class!”

When Matriarch Gu heard this, she heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the two children were fine. “Alright. By the way, where’s your mommy?”

Xiao Shi smiled at the courtyard door and said, “Mommy is behind. She’ll be here soon.”

Matriarch Gu looked up and saw Qiao Nian walking in.

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian walked over to Matriarch Gu and sat down.

Matriarch Gu glanced at the living room door again and asked in confusion, “Didn’t you leave with Ah Zhu? Where is he?”

“Brother still has something on. He left after sending us back.”

“Oh my, no matter how busy you are, you should still think about eating. We’ve already prepared a meal. Why don’t you call him and ask if he wants to eat before he goes back to work?” Matriarch Gu said with concern.

The Gu and Lu families had a good relationship, so the elders of the two families treated their children very well.

“Grandma, there’s no need to call him. Before Big Brother left, he said that he would eat on the way.” After Qiao Nian explained, she looked around but didn’t see Xiao Bao. She asked, “Grandma, is Xiao Bao awake?”

“Not yet.” Matriarch Gu shook her head gently. She said gently to Qiao Nian, “I was afraid that he would be tired from the flight, so I didn’t wake him up. The food is ready. Go upstairs and call Xiao Bao. I’ll get the servants to put the dishes on the table. Let’s eat together as a family.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian thought that Xiao Bao had slept for a long time. She should indeed wake him up. Otherwise, Xiao Bao might not be able to sleep at night because he was too energetic.

Xiao Shi took Gu Qi’s hand and sat on the sofa. She said softly, “Brother, I’m a little nervous.”

When Gu Qi heard Xiao Shi’s words, his heart ached as he gripped her hand tightly. He looked at Xiao Shi firmly and said seriously, “He will definitely like you. Don’t worry.”

Even if Xiao Bao didn’t like Xiao Shi, Gu Qi would definitely make him like her.

When Xiao Shi heard Gu Qi’s words, a sweet smile appeared on her face. She said happily, “Brother is the best!”

Gu Qi held Xiao Shi’s hand tightly. Her hand was still rough. When he thought of how Xiao Shi had suffered by Song Man’s side, he felt a little uncomfortable.

“Mommy~”

A soft voice instantly attracted everyone’s attention. Everyone looked over.

Xiao Bao walked down the stairs step by step with sleepy eyes. His feet were bare on the stairs, and he was rubbing his eyes.

Seeing that Xiao Bao had woken up, Qiao Nian quickly stood up and walked towards the stairs. When she reached Xiao Bao, she picked him up. “Mommy is here!”

Before Xiao Bao could open his eyes, he closed them and wrapped his arms around Qiao Nian’s neck.
