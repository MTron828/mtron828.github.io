Chapter 1805 - 1805 Explanation

Lina walked very slowly. She was thinking about how to make her father accept Chen Qing. Unknowingly, she walked up to the president. “Father, Chen Qing…”

Before she could finish, the president hugged her.

Lina leaned against her father’s broad chest as the uneasiness in her heart gradually disappeared. He was about to speak when her father’s gentle voice came from above.

“Lina.”

Lina’s heart skipped a beat. Just as she was about to speak, she heard the president speak again.

“You’re the princess of Europe. You have to straighten your back and express your needs. You don’t have to consider what others think or what I think. You just have to consider yourself.”

Lina’s pupils trembled. She couldn’t believe she was hearing this. As she thought back to what the president had just said, her eyes turned red uncontrollably and she silently hugged her father.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the past, she had to be careful about what she did. She represented the face of the royal family and her father. If she took a wrong step, Mark would take advantage of it as her father’s weakness.

But now, her father could already shelter her from the wind and rain. She no longer had to worry about anything else.

“You and Chen Qing are in love and you want to be with him. After Mark’s matter is over, I’ll announce to the world that you’re divorced. At that time, you’ll be able to be with Chen Qing in peace during the trial of Wright’s past mistakes.”

Tears welled up in Lina’s eyes, and her voice choked. “I-I was worried that you didn’t like Chen Qing.”

Everyone in the world knew that the role of a princess was to marry. Previously, when people of status from other countries proposed to her, her father was always picky. In the end, he rejected all of them.

Therefore, she always thought that her father wanted to find a particularly outstanding person for her and his family had to be especially good.

The president looked at Chen Qing, who was not far away. Chen Qing looked very weak, but Chen Qing’s eyes were always on Lina. He seemed to see himself from many years ago.

At that time, he also looked at his wife like this.

“I’ve always wanted to find someone who truly loves you. That person has to be kind. As for the external conditions, they’re actually not that important.”

The president knew that Chen Qing was a person who was willing to give up everything for Lina.

Moreover, with such a skilled person by Lina’s side, he did not have to worry about Lina’s safety.

As for wealth and status, his daughter did not lack these things. Even if his son-in-law did not, it did not matter.

Chen Qing noticed the president’s gaze and felt that he should say something now. He opened his mouth slightly but did not know what to say. After all, anything he said was insignificant now.

In Chen Qing’s opinion, it was better to prove everything with actions.

The president seemed to be able to tell what Chen Qing was thinking, so he did not say anything. He looked down at Lina in his arms and gently pushed her away.

“Lina, since you’ve decided to be together, go back and pack your things. Follow him to Country Z!”

Lina had been extremely touched by the president’s words just now. Now, it was as if a basin of cold water had been poured over her head. She was wide awake.

Lina pouted slightly and said with an aggrieved expression, “Dad, I want to be with him, but how can you chase me away? Don’t you want me anymore?”

Chen Qing was a little stunned on the hospital bed. Just as he was about to speak, he could not help but cough.

He hadn’t done anything and the president had agreed?

It was like a dream!

The President gently rubbed Lina’s face and said with a smile, “Why are you letting your imagination run wild? You’re my daughter. How can I not want you? I just want you to go to Country Z with him, not stay in Country Z forever.”

Lina blinked in confusion and looked at the president in confusion. “Then you…”

“I just went to see your mother. She’s much better now than before. Besides, so much has happened recently. I’ve told her all about it.”

When Lina heard the president’s words, she frowned and asked worriedly, “Mother…”
