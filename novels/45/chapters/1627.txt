Chapter 1628 I'm Not Tired

Holding Qiao Nian's hand, Gu Zhou walked out of the prison. The moon was in the sky and stars were sparse. The night sky was beautiful today, as if everything was moving in a good direction.

The two of them walked to the car. Qiao Nian was still looking up at the bright starry sky. Thinking of Cui Qi, and then of Mark, who was wandering freely outside, a trace of sadness flashed in her eyes. "After coming here, I realized that things had already far exceeded our imagination."

At that time, she only wanted to investigate the truth of the matter, but she didn't expect so much of the past to be involved.

Just thinking about everything Mark had done made her hair stand on end.

How did Mark plan this for twenty years without batting an eyelid? What kind of attitude did he put on to pretend to be Cui Qi's savior?

The two of them were just a step towards Mark's ascension to the throne. There were probably many people like Cui Qi around Mark. They had always treated Mark as the closest person to them, but Mark was probably just using them.

Gu Zhou reached out and wrapped his arm around Qiao Nian's shoulder, pulling her into his arms. He no longer had his coldness. He looked down at Qiao Nian slightly, his gaze gentle. In a low voice, he said, "Are you a little tired because you've been too busy?"

During this period of time, not only did she have to investigate the kidnapping more than twenty years ago, but she also had to help Madam President recuperate. She was spinning non-stop like a small spinning top and had no time to rest.

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou's heart ached for her. She gently wrapped her arms around his waist and looked up at Gu Zhou. In a gentle voice, she said, "I'm not tired. With you by my side and so many people helping me investigate that matter, I'm really not tired at all."

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, Gu Zhou's eyes sparkled. Without hesitation, he kissed her bewitching red lips.

It was rare for him to hear Qiao Nian say these words so bluntly. In his memory, Qiao Nian had always expressed everything very subtly. His eyes gradually softened. He hugged Qiao Nian tightly and said in a low voice, "Nian'er."

"Huh?" Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou.

Moonlight fell on him and bathed him in it. He looked a little unreal, like a person in a painting. It was as if he would disappear from this world in the next moment.

Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou's eyes. At some point, his eyes had been tinged with lust. She stood on her tiptoes and kissed Gu Zhou lightly on the lips before leaving.

Qiao Nian said in a low voice, "Alright, we should go back."

With that, Qiao Nian pushed Gu Zhou away and was about to leave when she was forcefully pulled back by Gu Zhou.

"You…"

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou had already kissed her lips.

After an unknown period of time, when Qiao Nian was about to suffocate, Gu Zhou let go of her reluctantly.

The lust in his eyes intensified. He said seriously, "That's what kissing is."

Qiao Nian sensed his hand moving down her back. She hurriedly pushed Gu Zhou away and took a few steps back. With a serious expression, she said, "You have to pay attention to your image in public. Alright, drive back quickly. We still have to appear in court tomorrow morning."

Seeing Qiao Nian enter the front passenger seat, Gu Zhou smiled faintly and got into the driver's seat.

Qiao Nian fastened her seatbelt. The car sheltered them from the cold outside. She looked at the quiet road ahead and pursed her lips helplessly. "I shouldn't have come over again today. Actually, Cui Qi has already told me the truth."

"I'll be more at ease if you come." Gu Zhou turned the car key and placed his hands on the steering wheel. Thinking about what was about to happen tomorrow, he frowned and said sternly, "It should be fine. Even if something happens, it will come later."

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou's words, she frowned slightly.

Gu Zhou was right. Cui Qi would definitely tell the court everything tomorrow, but Cui Qi would also take revenge on them.

Cui Qi was like a poisonous snake hiding in the dark. No one knew when he would start to bite them.

Qiao Nian thought of Mark, who had been living a carefree life. She pursed her lips and said, "I wonder if I can bring Mark down this time."

Qiao Nian's heart suddenly began to race. She felt vaguely uneasy.
