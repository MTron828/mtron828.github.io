1254 Trap

Gu Zhou tried hard to calm himself down. After a long while, he looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “Did you say anything else?”

“They said that they didn’t want us to go to the appointment this weekend, because going to the appointment was a trap in itself. Old Master Cui specially set a trap for you. If you go, they’ll kill you, and they’ll definitely instruct Big Brother to kill you.”

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened, and his heart was in a mess.

She wondered how her brother had spent the past six years.

His brother’s appearance and voice had also changed. If he hadn’t discovered something wrong with his brother’s smoking, he might have been deceived by him too!

“Ah Zhou…”

Qiao Nian’s voice pulled Gu Zhou back to reality. He nodded slightly, indicating that he was fine. “Don’t worry, I’m fine now. As long as I know that Big Brother is still alive, I’m relieved.”

Qiao Nian nodded and replied softly.

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes and thought for a while before saying, “In that case, don’t investigate HH Corporation first. Try to keep a distance from them.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“This time, we won’t be attending the appointment. We have to find a good excuse. Otherwise, Cui Huai will definitely suspect us.” Gu Zhou’s fingers gently tapped on the knee of his right leg, and his eyes darkened. “Looks like we have to pretend to be very busy.”

Qiao Nian nodded. She agreed with Gu Zhou very much.

Mr. Chen probably had the same thought.

No, he shouldn’t be Mr. Chen anymore. He should be called Gu Yue.

They were indeed biological brothers. It was easy to guess what the other party was thinking.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou had come to MY not only to find the murderer of Jiang Cheng, but also to find Gu Yue.

Now that the clues of the murderer of Jiang Cheng had been cut off and they had found Gu Yue, logically speaking, they should be able to return to the country.

“Let’s stay for a few more days. Investigate the source of the steel bullet first.” Gu Zhou was very curious about who was protecting Qiao Nian behind the scenes.

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She also wanted to know who was protecting her.

…

Xiao Bao lowered his head and sat in the front passenger seat. He stole a glance at Butler Zhao, who was sitting at the side. After hesitating for a long time, he called out pitifully, “Uncle Zhao!”

“Uncle Zhao, can you help me keep this a secret?” Xiao Bao looked at Butler Zhao expectantly, his voice soft and adorable.

When Butler Zhao heard Xiao Bao’s words, he frowned. Xiao Bao usually only acted cute when he asked for help. Other times, Xiao Bao would not be like this.

Seeing that Butler Zhao was frowning, Xiao Bao hurriedly said, “Uncle Zhao, you’ll definitely help me, right? I know that I shouldn’t see Mommy and Daddy today, but if I didn’t appear, Mommy would have been killed by bad people. If Daddy finds out that I went to save Mommy, he’ll definitely punish me.”

Butler Zhao frowned. He looked at Xiao Bao and said meaningfully, “Little Master, you were really too willful this time. Master risked a lot to raise you. He didn’t want you to be hurt, and didn’t trust others. In order to protect you…”

When Xiao Bao heard Butler Zhao’s words, his beautiful eyes lit up. He crossed his arms and pretended to speak normally. He continued, “Sir has put in a lot of effort for you. Don’t let him down. This matter is too important. You should take the initiative…”

At the red light in front, Butler Zhao stopped the car and looked at Xiao Bao. This child had been smart since he was young and had already begun to learn how to speak like him.

Seeing Butler Zhao looking at him, Xiao Bao smiled and said, “Uncle Zhao, I know Daddy did everything for my own good, but can you think of a new description?”

Pursing his lips, Butler Zhao sighed helplessly and said in a low voice, “I’ve…”

“I’m doing this for your own good.” Pretending to be Butler Zhao, Xiao Bao took over from what he was about to say.

Butler Zhao: You’ve said everything I wanted to say. What else can I say?

Butler Zhao looked at Xiao Bao helplessly.

“Uncle Zhao, the light has turned green!” Xiao Bao pointed at the traffic light in front of him and said with a smile.
