“About Wang Lin’s relatives.” Gu Zhou summoned Lan to his side. Lan instantly wound itself around his wrist obediently. “How are they now?”

Gu Zhou sat on the sofa casually, his hand brushing over Lan’s head every now and then.

Chen Qing had not expected Gu Zhou to ask this.

Back then, when he had found Wang Lin, Second Young Master Gu had never believed that Wang Lin was the girl from five years ago because the jade pendant wasn’t in her possession.

Moreover, Master Gu had always believed that the girl from back then had not died. Hence, he merely gave Wang Lin’s family some benefits, so that the Wang family would not have to worry about money for the rest of their lives.

“The Wang family is living in comfort. However, they have a small request,” Chen Qing said hesitantly.

Upon hearing Chen Qing’s words, Gu Zhou looked up at him. He said, “Wang Lin’s younger sister, Wang Miao, has just graduated from university with a degree in management. She would like to find a better job. Is that it?”

Gu Zhou fed Lan another piece of rabbit meat and asked Chen Qing, “Do you have any suggestions?”

“About that…” Chen Qing hesitated for a moment, then said, “One of our housekeepers here at the villa has just resigned. A position has just opened up.”

‘The meaning behind Chen Qing’s words was as clear as day.

“Okay,” Gu Zhou said impassively. “You may leave.”

Chen Qing understood Gu Zhou well, so he nodded in agreement. He turned around and prepared to leave.

“and.”

Chen Qing stopped. He tumed back, looking up at Gu Zhou.

“Ask her to keep her mouth shut. She’s not to mention what happened back then ever again,” Gu Zhou said coldly.

Chen Qing naturally understood what Gu Zhou meant. If the Wang family knew their place and did not cross the line, Master Gu would still take care of the Wang family. However, if they were greedy and asked for more, Master Gu would no longer care about Wang Lin. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The next morning.

Qiao Nian checked all the medicinal herbs before putting them into the medicine jar, preparing to brew the medicine.

After a busy morning, Qiao Nian finally managed to tum these herbs into medicinal pills.

She called for the servant and brought the medicine to Matriarch Gu’s room.

At this moment, Matriarch Gu was painting. Zhao Qian was grinding pigments at the side.

“Second Sister-in-law.” When Zhao Qian saw Qiao Nian, she smiled and greeted her.

Qiao Nian greeted Zhao Qian, then looked toward Matriarch Gu and greeted, “Grandma.”

“What did you bring?” When Matriarch Gu smelled the medicinal fragrance, her eyes lit up. “Is this medicine for Ah Zhou?”

“This is medicine I’ve prepared for Grandma’s heart disease.” Qiao Nian smiled at Matriarch Gu and explained, “I saw that Grandma didn’t look well, and I felt your pulse as well. I’ve made this medicine specially for you.”

At this moment, Jiang Yue, who had just walked in, heard Qiao Nian’s words. She lowered her gaze, hiding the strange look in her eyes.

Yesterday afternoon, she happened to hear Qiao Nian and Zhao Qian mention that they wanted to make some medicine for Matriarch Guj

“Oh, my darling child.” Matriarch Gu hurriedly beckoned Qiao Nian to her side and said gently, “Child, you didn’t even come out for lunch. You’ve been so busy with this. You must be tired. In the future, just get the servants to handle such trivial matters.”

Matriarch Gu pulled Qiao Nian to sit down with her.

Qiao Nian smiled and hurriedly grabbed hold of Matriarch Gu’s hand. She called the servant over. “Grandma, try one first.”

Qiao Nian took out one pill and handed it to Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu’s eyes lit up when she smelled the unique medicinal fragrance.

She took the pill and put it into her mouth. The pill tasted a little of Chinese medicinal herbs, but that bitterness was tempered by the flavor of sweet butter-cream. The flavor was just right too, and wasn’t so rich that one would easily get sick of it.

“Second Sister-in-law, this smells so good.” Smiling brightly, Zhao Qian praised Qiao Nian. “Those who don’t know better might think that this is candy!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Zhao Qian’s words, she nodded in agreement. She was so touched that her eyes grew red-rimmed. “My darling child, you’re truly wonderful. It’s Ah Zhou’s fortune to be able to marry you..”
