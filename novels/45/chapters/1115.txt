1116 Cut off her hand!

Everyone’s gaze fell on the man’s face. His skin was very fair, and his facial features were well-defined. His eyes were as deep and blue as the sea. He had one hand in his pocket and looked lazy. From time to time, he would look at the expensive watch in his hand!

This person was none other than Jiang Chi, whom Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were looking for!

The young ladies near the airport looked at Jiang Chi with love in their eyes. They covered their mouths with both hands, afraid that their hearts would jump out of their mouths!

“Oh my god, is this our new idol?”

“He’s too handsome! What’s his stage name? I want to pay attention to him!”

“I don’t think he’s my idol. His temperament is much better than my idol’s, and my idol is especially approachable. However, this person gives off an unapproachable feeling!”

There was a bold young girl. A bright smile appeared on her face as she said, “I think he might be using this method to hide his shyness. Ah, a shy man is really too seductive. I’ll get his WeChat!”

The other girls looked at the bold young girl curiously. If that young girl could get the man’s WeChat, they would ask for it too!

The girl raised her head and puffed out her chest. Under everyone’s gaze, she walked shyly to Jiang Chi.

She had been far away just now and could only see Jiang Chi’s approximate appearance. When she got closer, she realized that the skin on Jiang Chi’s face was delicate. She couldn’t even see his pores.

Even though she was standing in front of Jiang Chi, his attention was still on his cell phone. He did not even look at her.

The girl gently tugged at the corner of Jiang Chi’s shirt. When Jiang Chi looked at her, a bright smile appeared on her face. “Brother, you’re really too handsome. Can we add each other on WeChat?”

Jiang Chi did not speak. He lowered his gaze slightly, his long eyelashes covering his blue eyes. His gaze fell on the girl’s hand, which was holding the corner of his shirt!

Jiang Chi frowned and took a step back. He pulled the corner of his shirt back from the girl’s hand and unbuttoned his suit jacket one by one!

The girls around them were so excited that their faces turned red. They loved to see handsome men take off their clothes!

The girl in front of Jiang Chi stared at him with shining eyes. She could vaguely see the outline of his chest muscles. She licked her lips slightly!

Not only was this man good-looking, but his figure was also superb!

Such a top-notch man was definitely not a little idol of those entertainment companies!

Jiang Chi casually threw the jacket to his subordinate and glanced at the girl expressionlessly. Then, he said, “Liang Tu, cut off her hand!”

“What?” The girl standing in front of Jiang Chi looked surprised and pretended to be afraid. “Do all young men like to make such bloody jokes? I’m so afraid.”

Then, the girl smiled at Jiang Chi with a sweet smile on her face. She tilted her head and looked at Jiang Chi. “Brother, how was my acting just now?”

At this moment, a Maybach drove over.

Jiang Chi retracted his gaze from the girl’s face indifferently and walked towards the Maybach!

When the girl saw the Maybach, her eyes lit up. This man was both handsome and rich! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The girl hurriedly jogged after Jiang Chi. If she could be with this handsome man, she would be too happy!

Jiang Chi bent down and got into the car!

Seeing this, the girl reached out to pull Jiang Chi.

However, her hand was blocked by someone.

The girl looked at the man in front of her unhappily. This man was the man who had just followed the handsome man. His name seemed to be Liang Tu.

The girl immediately gave a smile.

So there were so many rules for rich people.

She should indeed be more reserved and wait for Liang Tu to invite her into the car.

The girl had wanted to wait for Liang Tu to speak, but seeing that he did not speak, she smiled and said, “Actually, you don’t have to be so polite. I just want that handsome man’s WeChat!”

With that, the girl walked around Liang Tu and prepared to get into the car.

Liang Tu grabbed the girl’s hand expressionlessly. It was the hand that the girl had used to pull the corner of Jiang Chi’s shirt.
