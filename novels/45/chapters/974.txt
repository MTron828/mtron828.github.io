975 Meeting Once

“Yes.” As Lu Zhu spoke, he took out his phone and searched.

When Lu Jiang heard Lu Zhu’s words, he frowned imperceptibly. Was his brother really obsessed with a married woman?

“I found it!” Lu Zhu said.

Lu Jiang stood up and walked towards Lu Zhu. When he saw Lu Zhu’s phone screen, he was slightly stunned.

In the photo, Qiao Nian was wearing a red dress. She stood there with a smile, her eyes sparkling, as if everything around her no longer mattered.

She had a noble aura and was charming.

Lu Jiang frowned slightly and was stunned. “It’s her?”

Lu Zhu looked at Lu Jiang in confusion and asked with a smile, “Have you seen her before?”

“We met once.” Lu Jiang’s emotions were a little complicated. “I told you about a good-looking girl being blocked by a few hooligans.”

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Jiang’s words, he immediately reacted and said, “She’s the one you saved?”

Lu Jiang nodded in agreement.

When Lu Zhu heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh.

Some things were really predestined.

Lu Zhu recalled what happened that night and frowned slightly. He asked, “Are you saying that He Cheng wants to bully her?”

“Yes,” Lu Jiang replied casually. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face in the photo, and he frowned slightly.

For some reason, the more he looked at Mrs. Gu, the more he felt that she looked familiar, as if he had seen her somewhere before.

Right, she looked a lot like his face.

How strange. Why did the two of them look alike?

Just as Lu Jiang was still puzzled, Lu Zhu’s phone screen suddenly turned into the caller ID page.

When Lu Jiang saw the words “Qiao Nian” on the phone, and Lu Zhu’s gentle expression, he asked in confusion, “Brother, who is Qiao Nian?”

Lu Zhu did not answer Lu Jiang. His lips curved up slightly as he walked towards the balcony with his phone, as if he did not want Lu Jiang to hear the conversation on the phone. When he walked to the balcony, he did not forget to close the door.

This was the first time Lu Jiang had seen his brother pick up a woman’s call so gently.

In the past, Big Brother only smiled like this when he picked up Grandma, Mom, and Little Sister’s calls.

The moment he saw the name “Qiao Nian”, he knew that the caller was a woman.

Could it be?

Was Big Brother in love?

He had thought that his brother would be with Sister Gu Qing in the future. After all, they had grown up together. His brother treated Sister Gu Qing differently from other women.

She didn’t expect this “Qiao Nian” to get there first! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

What kind of woman was she to be liked by an old cadre like Big Brother?

Lu Jiang looked meaningfully at the balcony. Just as he was about to walk over, he saw Lu Zhu standing on the balcony and looking back.

Seeing this, Lu Jiang could only sit back down.

Lu Zhu picked up the call and asked with concern, “Sugar, your voice is hoarse. Are you sick? Why don’t I get a private doctor to visit you?”

At this moment, Qiao Nian was sitting on the bed. Listening to the sound of Gu Zhou taking a shower in the bathroom, she recalled the hot and intense scene last night. The tips of her ears were slightly red.

Qiao Nian said uncomfortably, “I just have a cold. Brother, you don’t have to worry about me. I’ll just take some cold medicine later.”

“How about I send you medicine?”

“I’ve already bought it.” Qiao Nian was still very shy. She only hoped that there was a delete button in her brain to delete everything that had happened yesterday.

“That’s good. It’s cold now. You have to take good care of yourself.” Lu Zhu wanted to hire the private doctor to take care of Qiao Nian just now because he was too worried about her. Now that he had calmed down, he remembered that Qiao Nian was a doctor herself.

“Okay!” After Qiao Nian agreed, she hurriedly changed the topic. “Brother, I heard from Gu Zhou that Lu Qi’s birthday is coming up. I want to prepare a birthday gift for her, but I don’t know what to prepare.”

When Lu Zhu heard Sugar’s words, his expression instantly softened.

Their Sugar was the best girl in the world. She was gentle and kind. Now that Lu Qi’s birthday was coming up, she had already begun to think of preparing a gift for her.
