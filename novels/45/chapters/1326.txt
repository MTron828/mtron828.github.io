1327 Missing Daddy

Xiao Bao sat up and shook his head. The more he thought about it, the sadder he became. He wailed sadly, “I miss Daddy. I miss Uncle Feng. I want to go back.”

In a panic, Qiao Nian took a tissue from the side and carefully wiped Xiao Bao’s tears.

“But they don’t want me anymore. Sob…”

Seeing Xiao Bao like this, Qiao Nian’s heart ached.

Xiao Bao had grown up with Gu Yue and Eldest Senior Brother. He was too young to understand that people would be separated eventually. He had gone to an unfamiliar place alone. Even though she was his mommy, he had never interacted with her in the past.

Hence, when Xiao Bao woke up, he would miss the person closest to him.

Holding a tissue, Qiao Nian carefully wiped Xiao Bao’s tears and said gently, “Xiao Bao, it’s not what you think. It’s not that your Daddy and Uncle Feng don’t want you anymore. They like you very much and care about you especially. They’re sending you to Mommy now because it’s safer to be by my side.”

Xiao Bao sniffled hard and said sadly, “But I’ll wait for Daddy and Uncle Feng at home obediently. I won’t let them worry about me. I’ll always be obedient.”

“Xiao Bao, do you still remember Kan Shan?” Qiao Nian said gently. “Kan Shan is a traitor by your Daddy’s side. He’s working for someone else. Your Daddy and the others have to focus on dealing with the bad people now. If you stay with them, they’re worried that they won’t be able to protect you, so they want to send you over. When they catch all the bad people and send them to prison, our family will be reunited. You’ll always be with your Daddy and your Uncle Feng.”

Qiao Nian wasn’t just comforting Xiao Bao, but also herself. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

In the morning, she had wanted to ask Xiao Bao about Eldest Senior Brother’s current whereabouts, but now she realized something. If she went to look for Eldest Senior Brother now, those people would probably attack him.

All she could do now was pray that Eldest Senior Brother was safe and sound?

For the first time, Qiao Nian felt so incompetent.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s comforting words, Xiao Bao’s cries gradually softened. He obediently lay in Qiao Nian’s arms and looked up at her. He asked softly, “Mommy, do Daddy and Uncle Feng really like me?”

“Of course. They love Xiao Bao the most. That’s why they asked him to go to the safest place. They protected Xiao Bao like heroes.”

Xiao Bao sniffled and nodded. “Then I’ll be happy.”

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Bao and asked softly, “Xiao Bao, are there any very powerful doctors around your Daddy and Uncle Feng?”

“Mommy, are you talking about great-grandfather?” Xiao Bao looked up at Qiao Nian, his eyes wet like those of a deer.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she asked, “Who is your great-grandfather?”

“My great-grandfather! He is amazing. His medical skills are especially good. He’s Daddy’s private doctor!” Xiao Bao said in a childish voice. He sat up.

When Qiao Nian heard the word “grandfather”, she subconsciously thought of her grandfather and asked curiously, “Then do you know what your great-grandfather’s name is?”

Xiao Bao pouted and thought about it seriously before saying, “I heard Uncle Zhao call Great-grandfather Uncle Zhang!”

Uncle Zhang?

Qiao Nian frowned. It seemed that her brother Gu Yue’s private doctor wasn’t her grandfather.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly and sighed helplessly. She wondered where her grandfather was now.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s sad expression, Xiao Bao reached out and held her hand. “Mommy, is Daddy or Uncle Feng sick?”

“Your Uncle Feng is sick. I’m worried about your Uncle Feng’s injuries…” At this point, Qiao Nian’s gaze inadvertently fell on a photo at the side. An idea flashed across her mind. “Xiao Bao, you used to live in that villa. No one knew of your existence. Then can you tell me where you used to live?”

Since Big Brother had been able to hide it from Xiao Bao for many years, those people wouldn’t discover it if she went to the villa Xiao Bao had lived in before.

She would disguise herself as someone else. Those people probably wouldn’t recognize her, let alone follow her.

That way, she could get rid of the people following her and look for Eldest Senior Brother.

This way, she could see Eldest Senior Brother and not have to worry about him being discovered by others. This was really a good idea to kill two birds with one stone.

“I used to live in…”
