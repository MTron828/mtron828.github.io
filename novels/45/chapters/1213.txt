Jiang Chi took out his phone and called the butler, Jiang Wen.

“Young Master, what can I do for you?”

“How’s the investigation of the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family?” Jiang Chi massaged his temples and asked in a low voice.

Jiang Wen’s humble voice came from the cell phone. “I’m sorry, Young Master. I still don’t have any other clues.”

Suppressing his displeasure, Jiang Chi asked, “Who was Jiang Cheng close to in An City?”

Jiang Wen had been by Jiang Chi’s side for many years and was already used to his style of handling matters. He told him the information he had found in the morning. “When Second Young Master was in An City, he was relatively close to Miss Lu Qi. The two of them studied medicine and often went to the library to study.”

When Jiang Chi heard Jiang Wen’s words, his eyes couldn’t help but turn red. He could almost see Jiang Cheng and Lu Qi reading in the library.

All these years, he had been working hard to let Jiang Cheng live an ordinary life and not let him come into contact with the darkness of this world. However, he did not expect his actions to harm Jiang Cheng’s life.

Jiang Chi tried hard to suppress the pain in his heart and said in a low voice, “Send an email!”

With that, he hung up without hesitation.

In less than a minute, Jiang Chi’s phone rang. He glanced at the email Jiang Wen had sent him.

He opened the email. What was written was what Jiang Cheng had done in An City. There were also a few photos at the bottom.

In the photo, Jiang Cheng was standing in front of a girl. The girl was wearing a white dress with the hem above her knees, revealing her slender legs. She was wearing white canvas shoes, and she looked playful and adorable.

Jiang Cheng looked at the girl in a daze, his eyes flashing with a strange light.

This was the first time Jiang Chi had seen Jiang Cheng looking at someone like this. Only then did he realize that Jiang Cheng really liked that girl.

However, that girl only had one side profile. Jiang Chi narrowed his eyes. It was Lu Qi.

Jiang Cheng really liked Lu Qi!

When Jiang Chi realized this, he couldn’t help but grip his phone tightly.

In the past, when Jiang Chi knew that he would not live long, he hoped that Jiang Cheng could get married and have children as soon as possible. That way, he could still attend Jiang Cheng’s wedding.

Hence, when Jiang Cheng was twenty years old, he began to arrange blind dates for him.

At that time, Jiang Cheng had been red-faced and unwilling to go on blind dates, nor did he want to get married early.

Later on, his health recovered. It had already become a habit for him to urge Jiang Cheng to get married. He still hoped that Jiang Cheng could get married as soon as possible.

Although Jiang Cheng had gone to An City, the brothers still called often. He suddenly recalled what Jiang Cheng had told him in An City.

“Brother, can I stay in An City in the future?”

Could it be that Jiang Cheng wanted to stay in An City because of Lu Qi?

Jiang Chi looked at Jiang Cheng’s face on the phone. In the past, he could have killed Lu Qi without hesitation and forced her to accompany Jiang Cheng.

However, when he saw Gu Zhou hugging Qiao Nian today, he had a strange feeling.

He would never let the person he liked suffer any grievances.

His brother should think the same. If he really killed Lu Qi, Jiang Cheng would probably never forgive him for the rest of his life!

Jiang Chi continued scrolling down to look at the photos. Some of them were taken by cameras, while others were taken by someone else’s phone camera and the main focus was not Jiang Cheng.

Jiang Chi flipped through the photos when a photo suddenly attracted his attention.

In the photo, Jiang Chi looked flustered as he hurriedly walked out of the garden. The wine in the wine glass had even spilled, but he didn’t seem to care at all.

Jiang Chi glanced at the photo time and frowned. If he remembered correctly, Jiang Cheng should be participating in the Lu Corporation’s team-building event. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jiang Chi hurriedly took out Jiang Cheng’s diary and quickly flipped through it. When he saw April 18th, his movements slowed down.

[Tuesday, 4.18. Cloudy.

That person mentioned the eldest daughter of the Lu family when he called? I didn’t dare to get too close, afraid that I would be discovered.]
