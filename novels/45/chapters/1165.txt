1166 Don’t be afraid

Thank you readers!

Without another word, Gu Zhou bent down and picked Qiao Nian up in his arms. He carried her into the room, not forgetting to kick the door shut. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian subconsciously wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck. With a smile on her face, she stared unblinkingly at him.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian, who was in his arms. Qiao Nian was very light, and her body was very soft. When he hugged her, he could still smell her unique fragrance. His empty heart was filled with her.

Gu Zhou couldn’t help but hug Qiao Nian tightly, unwilling to let go for a moment. He quickly walked towards the bed!

He had been in a hurry to open the door for Qiao Nian, so he didn’t have time to turn on the lights.

The room was very dark. In the past, Qiao Nian would have been very afraid of such a dark and sealed environment. Now, she wasn’t afraid at all.

Staying in Gu Zhou’s arms, she only felt at ease!

Gu Zhou was hugging Qiao Nian when he accidentally tripped over a sofa. He staggered, and the sofa made a sound.

Qiao Nian gasped, her heart in her throat. She had already sneaked into Gu Zhou’s room, feeling guilty.

“Be careful. It’s not appropriate to wake them up,” Qiao Nian said in a low voice.

If her parents found out that she had spent the night in Gu Zhou’s room, they might criticize her again.

Her face turned red uncontrollably. She and Gu Zhou were clearly husband and wife, but now they had to meet secretly.

The affair was really exciting.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s guilty voice, Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly in the darkness. Holding Qiao Nian in his arms, he stood rooted to the ground and looked down at her face.

Perhaps it was because his eyes were always in a dark state, but his eyes had already adapted to the darkness. He could vaguely see Qiao Nian’s face.

Seeing how nervous she was, Gu Zhou lowered his head and planted a gentle kiss on Qiao Nian’s forehead. In a low voice, he said, “Don’t be afraid.”

“You Oh my!” Qiao Nian blushed. Just as she was about to refute Gu Zhou, she fell onto the soft bed with him.

Gu Zhou trapped Qiao Nian in his arms and brought her to his lips. He kissed her lightly, then let go. Looking at her bright little face, he said in a low voice, “Will you accompany me tonight?”

His voice was gentle, as if he was coaxing a child.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she hesitated for a moment. Soon, she shook her head and said, “No, if I sleep here and they find out later, I’ll be so embarrassed.”

“We’re husband and wife. It’s only right for us to live together.” Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian tightly. He moved his lips closer to Qiao Nian’s face and kissed her gently. “Moreover, your sister already knows that you’re here. You smell like me. If you go to your sister’s side now, won’t it be inappropriate?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Although Gu Zhou was right, she felt that something was wrong.

Gu Zhou was getting better and better at fooling people.

She looked up at Gu Zhou and said indignantly, “Then I’ll go over after taking a shower!”

“I’ve been hugging you the entire time. Even if you take a shower, you’ll still smell like me.” Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly. He lay on his side on the bed and pulled Qiao Nian into his arms, letting her press against his chest. He gently patted her back and said gently, “Go to sleep!”

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and frowned. “This isn’t good. I’m going to”

“Don’t worry, I won’t do anything.” Gu Zhou placed his hand on the back of Qiao Nian’s head and pressed her against his chest. His voice was low, as if he was acting spoiled. “I just want to hug you to sleep!”

Qiao Nian had rarely seen Gu Zhou like this. When she heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart softened. Just as she was about to sleep obediently, she felt a restless part of his lower body.

Half of Qiao Nian’s sleepiness dissipated. She frowned helplessly.

“Nian’er?”

“Huh?” Qiao Nian felt that the two of them still couldn’t sleep together. Just as she was about to get up and leave, she stopped when she heard Gu Zhou’s next words.

“Do you think our third child will be a girl or a boy?”
