Chapter 1761 - 1761 Action

These words were not only to comfort Gu Zhou, but also to comfort herself.

They were betting heavily this time. She only hoped that everything would go smoothly.

Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes. She hadn’t slept well last night and was too tired.

MY.

Cui Huai had begun to summon all the troops back the day Mark’s gold rooms were snatched away by the President. He had desperately asked people to train their troops and even called back everyone who was doing missions outside.

At this moment, many people were quite free. They were all chatting in Cui Huai’s company.

Even Chen Sheng and Chang Feng were waiting in the company’s lobby.

Sha He had always been doing missions outside. As long as it was a mission he accepted, no matter how difficult it was, he could complete it perfectly without making any mistakes.

When doing missions, Sha He was always cold and did not say much.

However, in private, Sha He could not stay idle and chatter endlessly.

The last time Sha He saw Chen Sheng was at Chen Sheng’s villa. That night, Chang Feng was severely injured and Cui Huai even personally dealt with the traitor, Dao Wen.

Since then, Sha He had been very interested in Chen Sheng. Now that everything was fine, he walked towards Chen Sheng with two glasses of red wine.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He walked up to Chen Sheng and handed him a glass of wine before sitting beside him. “Chen Sheng, you’re our boss’s favorite. You usually talk to him a lot. Do you know what he’s been busy with recently?”

Not far away, Ba Song, who was playing a game, heard what Sha He had said. He silently leaned towards him. He was also very curious about what the higher-ups were up to.

Actually, they all knew that there was someone above Cui Huai, but no one knew the identity of the person above him.

Chen Sheng slowly took a sip of red wine. His entire body exuded a cold and noble aura. He looked up slightly with a lazy expression.

Sha He looked at Chen Sheng with stars in his eyes. He liked Chen Sheng’s temperament. This kind of temperament was not something ordinary people could learn.

Chen Sheng was usually lazy and noble, but when he was doing missions, his methods were more vicious than anyone else’s.

Sha He was not in a hurry. He waited for Chen Sheng to speak.

Chen Sheng shook his head gently and said in a cold voice, “Boss didn’t mention it. He probably doesn’t want us to know too much. We’ll just follow orders.”

A few days ago, Cui Huai brought his trusted aide to see someone and returned quickly. When he returned, he had a radiant feeling, as if he was about to be reborn.

Cui Huai did not say who that person was. He guessed that the only person who could change Cui Huai’s mood was Mark himself.

Looking at how Cui Huai was training his troops, he reckoned that it would not be long before Cui Huai could return to Europe.

When Sha He heard Chen Sheng’s words, he sighed slightly and said discouragedly, “Let’s just have a casual chat in private. Just say what you have to say. Don’t talk like an official. It’s tiring.”

Sha He looked at Ba Song and kicked his butt, almost knocking him to the ground. “Do you know who Boss is meeting?”

Ba Song immediately moved to the side and said impatiently, “How would I know?”

Chen Sheng sat there calmly. From the corner of his eye, he looked at Cui Huai’s office. The door to Cui Huai’s office was closed, but from the gap under the office door, he could see that the original light inside was gradually disappearing, as if someone was standing at the door to block the light.

He rolled his eyes and looked at Sha He beside him. He said in a low and hoarse voice, “I heard something interesting previously. I heard that he seems to be from the same country as you. That person seems to be a general. What’s his name again…”

Sha He was from Europe. When he heard Chen Sheng’s words, he immediately understood. “Don’t tell me you’re talking about the old General Cui Si!”

“Yes, I think he’s called General Cui,” Chen Sheng said with a look of realization.

“I guess you’re talking about him too. After all, he’s the most famous general in Europe and the one with the most tragic past. The Cui family has been wiped out. Why did you suddenly bring him up?”
