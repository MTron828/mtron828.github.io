919 Planning

In the past, she might have taken Gu Zhou’s identity into consideration and not attacked Qiao Nian.

However, Song Man planned to ruin Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s marriage.

Song Man was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, and she had been engaged to Gu Zhou in the past.

Now that Song Man had arrived, the marriage between the Lu and Gu families would definitely take place again. At that time, Qiao Nian would be an unwanted wretch.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin’s eyes were filled with smiles.

What Qiao Xin didn’t understand was why Song Man didn’t return to the Lu family directly to acknowledge them.

From Song Man’s words, it seemed that she wanted to be with Gu Zhou first.

Song Man must have taken a liking to Gu Zhou, so she went to look for him first.

In the past, Qiao Xin had heard from others that the Lu family especially cared about the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Every year, on the anniversary of the death of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, the Lu family would hold a grand ceremony. Every month, the Lu family would prepare many gifts for the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin felt a little envious of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. If she were the eldest daughter of the Lu family, she would have endless wealth and love. She would have won without putting in any effort.

Resigned to her fate, Qiao Xin took out her phone and called Lu Zhu.

“Hello.”

A cold male voice came through the phone. This voice was very pleasant to the ear.

Qiao Xin’s heart skipped a beat. She sighed with emotion. Song Man was really lucky to have a particularly capable and handsome brother with a pleasant voice.

However, Qiao Xin quickly composed herself. She said gently, “Hello, Mr. Lu. I’m Qiao Xin, Qiao Nian’s younger sister. We met once at the Gu family villa.”

Lu Zhu frowned slightly and hesitated for a long time. “Qiao Xin…”

“Yes,” Qiao Xin replied with a smile, remaining silent.

Lu Zhu quickly remembered who Qiao Xin was. His expression instantly darkened.

He had investigated Qiao Xin’s background. Qiao Xin seemed to be especially jealous of Sugar. She had even caused Sugar many troubles.

Lu Zhu’s eyes instantly turned cold. The coldness in his eyes deepened as he said, “So you’re Mrs. Gu’s sister. What can I do for you?”

Qiao Xin gave a bright smile, a trace of cunning flashing in her eyes. She asked gently, “Mr. Lu, I heard that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was kidnapped and you only found a part of her arm?”

“What are you getting at?”

Qiao Xin could tell that Lu Zhu’s voice was very cold. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Indeed, everyone in the Lu family cared a lot about the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Qiao Xin maintained the smile on her face. “Mr. Lu, do you want to see your sister?”

Lu Zhu instantly became vigilant. He frowned slightly and asked, “What exactly do you mean?”

“Mr. Lu, I’ve already found out that the eldest daughter of the Lu family is still alive, but I’m not sure if Mr. Lu wants to see her.”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Xin’s words, he frowned slightly. He recalled what Qiao Nian had said previously and suspected that Qiao Xin was talking about Song Man.

Fortunately, he was prepared. Otherwise, he would have given himself away.

However, he was very curious. Song Man and Qiao Xin were actually related. Did Song Man really want to replace all Qiao Nian’s identities when she came here from Hai Cheng?

Lu Zhu found Qiao Xin disgusting. Qiao Xin had really put in a lot of effort to deal with Qiao Nian.

Lu Zhu pretended to be very nervous and asked, “Is what you said true?”

When Qiao Xin heard Lu Zhu’s words, she knew that he believed her. Her lips curved up slightly as she said with a smile, “At eleven tonight, I’ll take the eldest daughter of the Lu family to the Red Bar. When the time comes, Mr. Lu can come over to acknowledge his family member.”

“Okay!”

After Lu Zhu hung up, a trace of killing intent flashed in his eyes. He clenched his fists tightly.

How had Sugar grown up in the Qiao family?

His heart really ached for Sugar.

He found out that five years ago, in order to deal with Sugar, Qiao Xin had sent her to the bed of an old man in his fifties.

However, by chance, Sugar was with Gu Zhou that night.

Since Qiao Xin was so unafraid of death, he had to treat her well. He had to let Qiao Xin have a taste of ruin.

How could any Tom, Dick, or Harry bully the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

After hanging up, a bright smile appeared on Qiao Xin’s face. She ran happily towards her room, humming a popular song.

So what if Qiao Nian was amazing?

In front of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Qiao Nian had to wag her tail and beg for mercy.
