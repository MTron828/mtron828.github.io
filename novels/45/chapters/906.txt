907 Comforting Her

When Qiao Nian followed the servant to the corridor on the second floor, she could hear Xiao Shi crying from afar.

Qiao Nian turned to look at the servant and said in a low voice, “I won’t return to my room tonight. I’ll sleep with Xiao Shi.”

“Yes!” The servant nodded.

Qiao Nian walked to the door of Xiao Shi’s bedroom. She placed her hand on the handle and was about to push the door open when she heard Xiao Shi’s hysterical cries. Her entire heart seemed to be clenched tightly by a hand.

Qiao Nian pushed the door open and walked in. The moment she entered, she saw Xiao Shi sitting on the bed, crying hysterically. Her face was red, and she looked very pitiful.

When she returned to the Gu residence at night, she saw a garden filled with dolls, balloons, and beautiful fireworks. At that time, she was very happy.

However, when she fell asleep, the shadow of Song Man’s death would linger around her.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that it was difficult for a child to withstand the death of a adoptive mother who had raised her for five years.

“Xiao Shi.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she walked to the bed and sat down.

Xiao Shi raised her hand to wipe her tears. She looked at Qiao Nian and cried until she was out of breath. “Auntie Nian Nian… I just dreamed of her. She was covered in blood…”

Qiao Nian’s heart ached as she hugged Xiao Shi in her arms. Her eyes turned red. Xiao Shi had suffered greatly by Song Man’s side.

Xiao Shi hugged Qiao Nian tightly. It was as if this was the only way she could feel loved and feel that she wasn’t alone.

Qiao Nian gently patted Xiao Shi’s back. She looked at Xiao Shi in her arms guiltily. If she had taken care of Xiao Shi back then, Xiao Shi would definitely have lived better.

Guiltily, she apologized. “Xiao Shi… I’m sorry. Mommy didn’t take good care of you!”

When Qiao Nian finished speaking, she was stunned. Xiao Shi was still unwilling to be her daughter. If she took the initiative to say that she was Xiao Shi’s mommy, would Xiao Shi think of Song Man and be even sadder?

But since she had already said it, she couldn’t say anything.

Xiao Shi had been nestled in Qiao Nian’s arms. When she heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked up at her.

When she met Qiao Nian’s red eyes, she could clearly see her reflection in them. She could also see guilt and self-blame in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

“Mommy?” Xiao Shi called out in confusion.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi’s face, tears welling up in her eyes. She forced a smile and nodded vigorously. “Yes, Auntie Nian Nian will be Xiao Shi’s mommy in the future, okay?”

Worried that Xiao Shi would be disgusted, Qiao Nian added, “If Xiao Shi is willing…”

Xiao Shi looked up at Qiao Nian. She could clearly see that Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with sincerity. For some reason, she felt that Qiao Nian’s eyes were both sad and gentle.

Xiao Shi nodded. If Auntie Nian Nian became her mommy, she would really be willing. She reached out and hugged Qiao Nian’s neck, leaning her head against Qiao Nian’s collarbone. With a satisfied expression, she said, “Thank you. I’m willing to be your daughter.”

Qiao Nian’s heart suddenly skipped a beat, then began to race. She hugged Xiao Shi tightly, tears welling up in her eyes. She was extremely touched.

She was really happy that Xiao Shi was willing to be her daughter, but her heart ached for the grievances she had suffered in the past.

“Xiao Shi, it’s Mommy’s fault. Mommy didn’t protect you well in the past and made you suffer. I’m really happy that you’re willing to let me be your mommy.” Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes, tears falling silently.

If she hadn’t come to An City and if Song Man didn’t want to be Madam Gu, she might never have known that Gu Qi, who had been raised by her, was her child.

She might be immersed in the pain of losing her children for the rest of her life. She would spend time with her own child, but she would never be able to acknowledge him.

It was Xiao Shi’s arrival that enabled her to know the truth of the matter, and prevented her from suffering because of the loss of her child.

Xiao Shi didn’t know what Qiao Nian was thinking. She hugged Qiao Nian’s neck and fell silent for a moment. She asked carefully, “Mommy, I…”

Xiao Shi stopped after saying a few words, hesitating if she should continue.
