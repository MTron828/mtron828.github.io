Chapter 311: Counterattack

Qiao Nian’s cold voice and sarcastic gaze fell on the three of them. “By the way, I have a big gift for you!”

With that, Qiao Nian opened Weibo again and posted the video she had prepared beforehand.

Gao Lin had a bad feeling about this. She opened Weibo and saw that Qiao Nian had posted another indecent video.

The number of video hits increased exponentially.

Gao Lin looked at the accompanying text in disbelief.

“The video below is to clarify the evidence of Xia Xue, Gao Lin, and Liu Yu slandering me. This Weibo post will be deleted in ten minutes.”

Curious, everyone played the video.

A man’s heavy breathing and a woman’s satisfied moans came from each phone.

Immediately, Weibo exploded. It took two minutes for it to recover.

The private parts of the people in the video had all been pixelated, but it was as if the video had not been pixelated at all. One could vaguely see the specific parts of the video.

The person in the video was clearly the school belle, Xia Xue, whom everyone admired and respected.

The people from the music school recalled the indecent photos on Tieba and saw the contents of the video. They instantly understood. Someone had replaced Xia Xue’s head with Qiao Nian’s head, framing Qiao Nian and making everyone think that Qiao Nian was the one who had done those dirty things.

However, she did not expect Xia Xue to be the culprit.

The video was the best proof.

Xia Xue looked at the video in Gao Lin’s hand, and the blood was drained from her face.

In the second half of the video, Liu Yu sat seductively on the lap of a fifty-year-old man with white hair, kissing him. The man’s hand even reached into Liu Yu’s clothes.

The scene was extremely exciting. Her clothes were taken off bit by bit, making one blush and their hearts race.

Everyone was stunned.

How could there be such a brazen woman in this world!

In order to steal the position of a female musician, they had actually framed Qiao Nian for all the despicable things they had done.

Qiao Nian was clearly the true female musician!

Liu Yu looked at the video on her phone and felt like dying. She fell to the ground and started crying.

This video was the final straw for Xia Xue and Liu Yu.

Xia Xue had been certified as the belle of the faculty on Weibo because of her good looks. She often took selfies and had more than 200,000 fans.

Previously, after Brother Cao posted that Xia Xue was Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician, her Weibo followers skyrocketed to one million.

Xia Xue’s comments section was originally filled with praise. When the video was released, the comments section was filled with hatred.

“F*ck, I can’t take it anymore. What the hell have I fallen for?”

“This is so disgusting. She committed so many evil deeds, and even framed someone else for it. She even wanted to ruin someone’s life. No human being would do such a disgusting thing!”

“Birds of a feather flock together. These three are birds of a feather. Although there’s no video of Gao Lin, I guess she’s not a good person either!”

“I think I’ve vomited. This won’t do. I have to go to the hospital!”

…

Xia Xue glared at Qiao Nian with resentment written all over her face. Gritting her teeth, she said, “Are you trying to ruin us completely?”

When Qiao Nian heard Xia Xue’s question, she smiled and admitted openly, “Yes, did you just realize that? You’re as stupid as a pig.”

“You’re simply too vicious!” Xia Xue roared.

“Vicious?” Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. She retorted, “How can you say that? After all, you’re the least qualified person to say that.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia Xue froze.

“I learned it from you. You only took a photo of me getting into Gu Zhou’s car. Then, you began to make a big fuss on the school’s Tieba forum. The posts slandering me were even posted on various social media platforms. At that time, you wanted to ruin me. When you did these things, why didn’t you say that you were vicious?”

When Liu Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she cried and roared, “You posted a video. We only posted pictures!”
