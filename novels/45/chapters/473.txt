Chapter 474: Out of Danger

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The chief surgeon had failed to save Lu Zhu. Now, he could only listen to Qiao Nian’s suggestion. Without hesitation, he said, “Needle!”

When the nurse heard Qiao Nian’s words, she hurriedly brought the needle and thread over. After disinfecting them, she handed them all to the chief surgeon.

Seeing that the chief surgeon was stitching, Qiao Nian asked, “Do you have silver needles?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s question, Xu Qian hurriedly said, “Yes.”

“Bring them over for me. The more, the better.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she looked at Lu Zhu worriedly. As if she had thought of something, she looked up at another nurse. “I remember when I came here, I saw that you have Chinese medicine here?”

The nurse said quickly, “Yes, there is.”

“Are there Chinese doctors on duty now?”

“There are.”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the blood bag. There was still time. This time, she was going to snatch him from the hands of the King of Hell. She tried her best to remain calm and said, “Go and find a Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor now. Then, ask him for a set of Chinese medicine. Silvery wormwood, Crinis Carbonisatus, Cogon grass…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, the nurse was so anxious that her forehead was covered in sweat. “Doctor Qiao, I-I can’t remember anything!”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Do you have a pen and paper? Hurry up and bring them over!”

The nurse brought over a pen and paper and handed it to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian hurriedly wrote everything down and handed the note to the nurse. “Come back quickly!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, the chief surgeon was still carefully stitching up the wound. He was especially careful with every stitch, afraid that he would cause a new wound.

Soon the nurse brought the silver needle and sterilized it.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She walked over to Lu Zhu, holding a silver needle in her hand.

When the chief surgeon saw Qiao Nian holding the silver needle, confusion flashed across his eyes. “You want to suture him?”

Qiao Nian said calmly, “To assist you, of course. Don’t stop!”

The chief surgeon paused for a moment, then continued what he was doing.

Qiao Nian took out the silver needle and began to insert it in his body.

The first needle she inserted was to stop Lu Zhu from continuing to bleed. The most important acupuncture points were mainly used to treat coughing, coughing blood, and some inflammation.

Qiao Nian only hoped that this matter would be of some use!

Qiao Nian took out a second silver needle and inserted it into Lu Zhu’s acupoint below his toenail.

The chief surgeon was stunned by Qiao Nian’s actions. This was the first time he had worked with acupuncture during an operation.

He was a Western doctor and had read many Chinese medicine books. Naturally, he knew the acupuncture points that Qiao Nian targeted.

However, he felt that Chinese medicine was a little mysterious. Hence, he still doubted if Qiao Nian’s actions would be useful.

Lu Zhu was suffering from external injuries. Only by bandaging him up could the bleeding be stopped. Was it really okay to puncture his acupoints?

The chief surgeon couldn’t help himself. “Is it really working?” he asked.

“I don’t know either.” Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly and said calmly, “Even if it’s useless, it won’t do any harm.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she continued to insert silver needles.

At this moment, Xu Qian brought in the Chinese medicine soup.

Qiao Nian said, “Feed him. Only a little at a time.”

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian even soaked the silver needle in the medicine before inserting it into Lu Zhu’s body.

The chief surgeon was also almost finished.

After Qiao Nian finished inserting the needle, she could only wait quietly. She only hoped that Lu Zhu would be safe.

As everyone waited quietly, a look of surprise flashed across the chief surgeon’s eyes. He hurriedly said, “The bleeding has stopped!”

Everyone hurriedly looked over and was so nervous that they did not dare to breathe. They looked at Lu Zhu’s wound expectantly. They could see that Lu Zhu’s wound was bleeding less now.

Although no one knew if it was because Lu Zhu’s wound had been stitched up or because of the acupuncture, this was still something worth celebrating.

At least, Lu Zhu’s injuries had temporarily stabilized and his life was not in danger.
