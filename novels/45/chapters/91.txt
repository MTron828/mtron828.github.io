Now, Matriarch Gu’s condition had worsened. What exactly was going on?

“I’s good that you’re aware of it,” Qiao Nian said calmly. Her gaze was as cold as ice.

Doctor Su was so angry that he could barely breathe. If his medical skills were not good, how could he have become a private doctor of the Gu family?

Indeed, the fact that made Doctor Su the most displeased was that he was being questioned by such a young, inexperienced lass.

This young lass clearly overestimated her own abilities.

Frenzied with rage, Doctor Su said, “I’ve eaten more salt than you have rice. Your years of experience can barely compare to mine. How dare you…”

“Quiet!” Qiao Nian gave Doctor Su an indifferent glance, then looked at Gu Zhou and said, “If you want Grandma to survive this ordeal, bring me all of Grandma’s previous medical records. All useless people are to leave! You are not to disrupt my treatment of Grandma!”

With that, Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Doctor Su and Jiang Yue’s faces. She fell just short of calling them by name.

This was the first time Doctor Su had seen someone so brazen. He had been in the medical field for more than twenty years, and this was the first time he had been questioned by anyone so young.

This young lass still dared to show off in front of him. She really overestimated her own abilities. He had been worried that if Matriarch Gu died, the Gu family might blame him. Now, someone was willing to take the blame. He was overjoyed.

At the thought of this, Doctor Su’s mood improved. However, he did not dare to show any of his happiness on his face.

“Second Young Madam, if you can cure Matriarch Gu today, I vow to never treat anyone else ever again,” Doctor Su said with utter seriousness.

“It’s a deal.” Qiao Nian said mercilessly. “In that case, you’ll have to quit the medical field very soon.”

Doctor Su stood at the side and did not speak. He had already taken Matriarch Gu’s pulse just now. Matriarch Gu was already deeply poisoned. Coupled with the fact that her body was already on the verge of collapse, it would be useless even if he were to pump her stomach right now. It would only make

Matriarch Gu suffer more.

Sometimes, death wasn’t so scary. What was much scarier would be suffering greatly while staying alive.

At the thought of this, Doctor Su became much calmer.

Qiao Nian walked to the bed and was about to take Matriarch Gu’s pulse when she was pushed aside by Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue’s face was dripping with tears as she sobbed. “Qiao Nian, what have you done? You were clearly the one who poisoned Grandma, yet you’re still putting on an act…”

“shut up!” Gu Zhou glared at Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue was startled by Gu Zhou’s voice. Frightened, she looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief and asked hesitantly, “Second Brother, do you believe her? She clearly…”

“Let her treat Grandma.” Gu Zhou retracted his gaze indifferently. It was akin to giving Jiang Yue an affirmative answer.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. She didn’t expect Gu Zhou to believe her.

Right now, Matriarch Gu’s condition wasn’t great. She reached out to push Jiang Yue away and walked towards the bed. For just a moment, there was a murderous glint in her eyes, frightening Jiang Yue so much that she began to tremble.

Jiang Yue walked to the side unwillingly and lowered her gaze slightly to hide the dissatisfaction in her eyes. She wouldn’t mind seeing what Qiao Nian could do to bring a dead person back to life.

Qiao Nian sat by the bed and took Matriarch Gu’s hand, beginning to feel her pulse.

At this moment, Matriarch Gu’s pulse was extremely weak, as if her heart would stop beating at any moment.

Indeed, Matriarch Gu had been poisoned.

This was very strange.

Neither the medicine she had given Matriarch Gu nor the medicine Doctor Su had prescribed would poison Matriarch Gu.

Qiao Nian’s brow furrowed. She turned to look at Doctor Su and asked, “Doctor Su, are you sure that Grandma just had a cold when you first took her pulse?”

Doctor Su had already cursed Qiao Nian and all her ancestors many times over in his heart, but he didn’t let it show on his face. He said calmly, “Even if my medical skills aren’t good enough, I’ve never misread anyone’s pulse. The first time I took Matriarch Gu’s pulse, she was indeed only suffering from a

cold..”
