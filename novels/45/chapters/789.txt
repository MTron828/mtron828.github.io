790 Can’t Remember

Had this really happened?

Qiao Nian frowned. But if that really happened, why didn’t she remember?

She remembered very clearly that her life on the spiritual mountain had been filled with disasters.

She fell ill every other day, or perhaps she encountered something unlucky. In any case, she was in deep trouble every day. There was no one else in the world who was as unlucky as her.

!!

Back then, her grandfather had saved her, her senior brothers had saved her, and Qiao Yu had also saved her…

Although many things had happened in the past, she basically remembered everything.

Could it be that she had forgotten many things like Gu Zhou?

Qiao Nian suddenly remembered. Previously, on the spiritual mountain, her grandfather had instructed her to keep a diary every day. Later on, when she returned to An City, she had placed her diary in the Qiao family’s house.

Perhaps her memory would be wrong, but she kept a diary every day. It was impossible for her to forget what had happened that day quickly.

Although she had already hidden the diary, she was not sure if it had been found by the Qiao family. She hoped that her diary had not been discovered by the Qiao family yet.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and said calmly, “I can’t remember why you suddenly asked me this. I’ll think about it tomorrow, okay?”

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that Qiao Nian looked sincere and didn’t seem to be lying to him, he said, “Okay!”

Qiao Nian seemed to have thought of something. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and asked, “Why did you go to the spiritual mountain previously?”

“You also know that my health isn’t good. Grandpa also brought me there to find Doctor Ming to treat my illness!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was slightly stunned.

The Doctor Ming Gu Zhou was referring to was not only her grandfather, but also her master.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. She was completely certain that Gu Zhou hadn’t found her grandfather back then.

If Gu Zhou really found his grandfather, Gu Zhou’s health would improve. Gu Zhou should also be his grandfather’s disciple, because his grandfather no longer allowed outsiders to see him and only treated his disciples.

It was precisely because of this that Eldest Senior Brother stayed behind to study medicine with his grandfather.

“Are you Doctor Ming’s disciple?”

In the past, Gu Zhou had always wondered why Qiao Nian’s medical skills were so superb at such a young age.

If Qiao Nian was Doctor Ming’s disciple, he would understand why Qiao Nian’s medical skills were good.

A great teacher produced a brilliant disciple.

“Yes,” Qiao Nian replied honestly. She felt that there was no need to hide anything.

“Chang Feng too?”

“Yes! He’s my eldest senior brother!”

With that, Qiao Nian felt the pressure on her increase. She reached out to push Gu Zhou away, but Gu Zhou’s steady breathing entered her ears.

Gu Zhou had fallen asleep.

Qiao Nian recalled that Gu Zhou had taken a pill she had specially prepared for him. That pill was specially designed to treat Gu Zhou’s insomnia. The medicine in it had a calming effect.

Qiao Nian carefully pushed Gu Zhou aside, then took the blanket and covered him with it. She lay down beside Gu Zhou and stared unblinkingly at his face. She really hadn’t seen Gu Zhou when she was younger.

She had to return to the Qiao family as soon as possible. She had many things to ask.

…

Hai Cheng.

Qin Chuan stood in front of a slum. He took out the address he had been given when he was young and carefully compared it to the house number.

Slum 250.

It was already eleven in the evening.

Most of the lights in the rooms had been turned off. Those people must have gone to bed.

Just as Qin Chuan was about to knock on the door, he suddenly smelled the fragrance of lilies.

His brow furrowed slightly.

The fragrance of lilies was mixed with the fragrance of jasmine and lily of the valley. This fragrance seemed a little familiar.

Qin Chuan frowned.

If he remembered correctly, this should be the third perfume released by MK. It was said that this perfume could make one feel happy.

This perfume was a limited edition of 500 bottles worldwide. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

According to the rich fragrance of the perfume now, if he wasn’t wrong, the people in the room were using this perfume.
