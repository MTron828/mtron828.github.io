When he asked Chen Qing, Chen Qing said that he had helped him back to his room to rest. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But from Gu Qi’s words, it seemed that he had returned to his room on his own. Why was he carrying Qiao Nian back to the room?

If Little Qi didn’t have a deep impression of what had happened, then Gu Qi couldn’t have remembered what had just happened wrongly.

What exactly was wrong?

Could it be that the person who looked exactly like him was in this villa?

Something was wrong.

If he was a stranger, how could he have returned to the bedroom from the study?

Gu Zhou’s mind was in a mess.

At this moment, he heard Gu Qi say pitifully, “When Auntie came here just now, her lips were also broken. You must have done it in the room!”

Gu Qi continued, “Auntie is so gentle and kind. How can you treat her like this?”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

He actually didn’t know how to refute him.

At this moment, Gu Zhou clearly realized that Gu Qi was no different from a normal person. Moreover, his logic was far more meticulous than that of children his age.

Gu Qi could even fool a psychiatrist into thinking that he was born with autism. In that case, Gu Qi should be exceptionally smart. Just as Qiao Nian had said, he was a little genius.

As a father, he had thought that his child was born with autism. He had thought that it would be difficult for Gu Qi to survive in the future.

But at this moment, he clearly knew that his child was a little genius.

Joy instantly filled his chest.

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi gently, then met Gu Qi’s dissatisfied face.

“Only a lover would bite their love’s lips. Hmph!” Like a judge, Gu Qi made the final decision with a single sentence.

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Gu Qi stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou, waiting for his response. He just didn’t understand why his father wasn’t saying anything.

Just now, Dad had clearly carried Auntie into the room and even bit her mouth. From what others had said, Auntie might have Sister Nian’er soon.

For a moment, Gu Zhou just didn’t expect to receive so much information. His mind was in a mess.

It seemed that Gu Qi was right. He had mentioned Nian’er on his third birthday.

But at that time, he and Nian’er had never met. How did he know the name Nian’er?

He clearly remembered that he had drunk too much that night and fell asleep from the alcohol. As for everything else, he had no recollection of it.

Gu Qi’s words caught his attention.

Gu Qi was a child and would not lie. Moreover, even if Gu Qi was lying, it was impossible for him to lie as if it was the truth. This proved that Gu Qi was telling the truth.

Only then did Gu Zhou realize that Gu Qi had liked to wear female clothes previously. It was probably because of what he had said previously. He had deliberately changed into female clothes and disguised himself as a young lady.

That quack doctor actually said that Gu Qi had gender cognitive impairment.

However, he didn’t remember anything Gu Qi had said.

His heart ached for Gu Qi. He pulled Gu Qi into his arms and placed his head gently on Gu Qi’s head. “I’m sorry.”

Gu Qi felt a wave of warmth envelop him. His eyes grew hot. He tried hard to raise his head to stop his tears from falling. His body tensed up, and he remained silent.

Her father’s embrace was so warm.

This was the only thing Gu Qi felt.

“I’m sorry, Little Qi. Dad might be sick. He doesn’t know what he’s saying at all. Dad only has you. Dad likes you the most. He doesn’t want any Nian’er.” Gu Zhou’s heart ached even more for Gu Qi.

Gu Qi blinked innocently, his brow furrowing deeper and deeper. The grievance in his eyes was obvious. “But Dad, when you were dreaming, you kept calling for Nian’er. For the entire night.”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Gu Qi’s words made Gu Zhou realize something. When did he know someone called “Nian’er”? Why would he even call her in his dream?

Moreover, he had no impression of it at all.
