719 Ah Rao Is Here

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Yue’s words, she sneered and asked, “So you schemed to make everyone in the Lu family my enemy. You wanted me to be chased out of the Lu family and live a life worse than death?”

Jiang Yue tacitly agreed.

At this moment, a casual and gentle voice came from the door.

That voice was filled with killing intent.

“Since your plan has already failed, have you thought about how to walk out of here alive?”

Everyone looked over.

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up.

It was Ah Rao!

Ah Rao, who had always protected her in MY, was also her third brother.

He was wearing a suit, but he exuded a wanton aura.

He had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes. Under his high nose bridge, his thin lips curved up slightly, filled with killing intent.

Ah Rao’s gaze landed on Jiang Yue’s face. His cold gaze was like thousands of small knives cutting off Jiang Yue’s flesh.

Jiang Yue felt as if she was being cut into pieces.

Qiao Nian looked at Ah Rao, just like the first time she had seen him. Her heart couldn’t help but race.

The first time she saw Ah Rao, she thought that she had fallen for him.

Now, she finally understood. It was because she had the same blood as Ah Rao that Ah Rao’s appearance affected her heart.

Seeing Qiao Nian look at Ah Rao, Lu Zhu and Lu Nian couldn’t help but feel jealous. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Gu Zhou’s gaze had originally landed on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that there was something wrong with the way Qiao Nian was looking at Ah Rao, he was about to block her gaze when he realized that Lu Zhu and Lu Nian seemed to be a little jealous.

Gu Zhou’s expression changed. He had an answer.

No one knew when Ah Ruo had arrived. When they heard Ah Rao’s cold voice and saw the anger in his eyes, they guessed that he must have arrived very early.

In other words, Ah Rao already knew that Jiang Yue had destroyed the urn of the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

At this moment, Ah Rao did not know that the urn contained the ashes of others. He had always thought that it contained his biological sister’s ashes, and his body was burning with anger.

His most precious biological sister. When she was alive, she was kidnapped and dismembered. After she died, her urn was splashed with sulfuric acid.

He hated himself for not being able to protect Sugar in the past. That was why he had let Sugar die early.

But now he had the ability to protect Sugar’s urn.

He would never let Jiang Yue off.

The killing intent on his face intensified.

He walked towards Jiang Yue step by step, like a demon who had walked out of hell. His entire body emitted a world-destroying anger.

Seeing Ah Rao like this, Jiang Yue took two steps back in fear.

Her body trembled involuntarily, and her mind went blank.

When Jiang Yue took a few more steps back, there was a big tree behind her, and further behind her was the garden.

She had no way out.

“Brother Ah Rao, I’m really not…”

“Shut up!” Lu Rao interrupted Jiang Yue coldly. He walked up to Jiang Yue and looked down at her with a vicious gaze.

Jiang Yue trembled in fear. She had known in the past that Brother Ah Rao was the fiercest person in the Lu family.

Usually, Ah Rao looked like he was chatting and laughing and was very gentle with people, but he was very crazy deep down, like a wolf in the forest.

Ah Rao was not an ordinary wolf. He was the alpha wolf of the wolf pack.

Ah Rao’s ruthlessness made him the top bodyguard that everyone feared.

Qiao Nian noticed Ah Rao’s gaze. He didn’t look at Jiang Yue like a person at all. Instead, it was as if he looked at the most disgusting thing in the world.

Ah Rao walked over and inadvertently saw the perfume bottle on the ground. A trace of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

He bent down and picked up the perfume bottle.

Jiang Yue’s legs gave way and she fell to the ground. She looked up at Ah Rao and said with a trembling voice, “W-What are you doing?”

“I didn’t want to do anything,” Ah Rao said. He looked at the perfume bottle in his hand and looked at Jiang Yue coldly. “You deliberately ruined my sister’s peace today. I will ruin your appearance, so we’re even.”
