Chapter 135 Are You Worthy?

Qiao Nian tucked her hair behind her ear and said unhurriedly, “Is that so? I’ve really never witnessed you raising me. I always thought I was an orphan!”

Qiao Shan was so angry that he choked. Livid, he raged, “You…”

“What about me?” Qiao Nian interrupted Qiao Shan’s words without hesitation. Her tone dripping with ridicule, she said, “I was sent to live in the countryside with a distant relative, at an age too young to remember anything. What sort of family does that? Did you even pay any child support fees? I don’t think so. If the elderly man who lived next door didn’t take pity on me, and didn’t raise me painstakingly as a child of his own, I would have died a long time ago. You keep saying that you’ve raised me, but when have you ever even taken care of me? You have the nerve to mention that you’ve raised me. You’re truly shameless!” Qiao Shan’s expression contorted with rage, his face alternating between shades of green and white. He said furiously, “You ingrate! Did I bring up any of that? I’m talking about those expensive plants and how you bullied your sister today. Your sister usually treats you so well! She even gave you her shares. Yet you’ve embarrassed her today!”

Qiao Shan rattled off so much in one breath that he nearly couldn’t breathe. Taking a deep breath, he said, “Do you know that after what you’ve done today, your younger sister has become a joke in An City? Don’t you know how to act like an elder sister? Don’t you know how to take care of your younger sister?” Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. No matter what, Qiao Shan was still harping on those expensive plants and Qiao Xin’s reputation.

“Forget about those plants. As long as it belongs to me, Qiao Nian, it has nothing to do with the Qiao family,” Qiao Nian said expressionlessly.

At this moment, Su Xue returned. The moment she got out of the car, she heard Qiao Nian’s words.

At this moment, Su Xue no longer cared that Qiao Nian was the Young Madam of the Gu family. She pounced on Qiao Nian, ready to hit

her.

But before Su Xue could get close to Qiao Nian, Qiao Nian kicked her away, causing her to fall flat on the ground.

Seeing Su Xue lying on the ground in a sorry state, Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Mom, did you do something shameful outside? Is that why you came back looking so apologetic?”

Su Xue, who was lying on the ground, felt her heart skip a beat, but she quickly calmed down. She spat out the mud in her mouth and stood up, wincing from the pain.

“You wretch! How dare you hit me? Are you no longer taking me to be your mother?!” Qiao Nian’s gaze instantly turned icy. A cold smile appeared on her face as she asked, “Are you worthy?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes widened to the size of dinner plates. She thought she was hallucinating. “What… what did you say?”

At this moment, Qiao Xin was also stunned. Qiao Nian seemed to be acting a little strange today. Did Qiao Nian already know that she wasn’t her parents’ biological daughter?

This was impossible!

No one else knew about this.

But Qiao Nian was indeed a little strange today.

In the past, Qiao Nian would still acknowledge that she was Su Xue’s biological daughter, at least on the surface level. But now, Qiao Nian no longer bothered even putting on a facade of respect.

Qiao Nian glared at Su Xue coldly. Thinking of what she had heard in the gym just now, she felt a wave of nausea. She questioned, “How are you fit to be a mother? When have you ever educated me? When have you ever provided for me? If you haven’t, then don’t speak to me as an elder! You’re just a woman who’s several decades older than me!”

Su Xue stood there in a daze, staring at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to say anything like that.

Qiao Shan’s lips trembled in anger. “You’re rebelling! I’ll beat you to death!” This time, Qiao Shan didn’t show any mercy. Using all his strength, he swung the whip in his hand towards Qiao Nian! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qiao Shan’s strength was immense, and he acted extremely quickly. Chen Qing, who was standing not far away, had no time to react.
