Chapter 1476 Unexpected Encounter!

“Get lost!”

Ye Yuan’s face fell as he yelled coldly to those few fiend race women.

An icy-cold killing intent spread out. Those fiend race women all turned white as a sheet, involuntarily retreating.

If it were before, they would definitely not take Ye Yuan’s berating seriously, but go over and flirt instead.

But now, Ye Yuan killed Lang Ge with two sword moves. Who would still dare to not take him seriously? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

All the girls made way. Ye Yuan slowly walked past from the middle, heading toward the city gates.

Fiend race territory, killing people on the streets, this sort of thing, was very common. Those capital city guards could not even be bothered to give it a glance.

The fiend race was this kind of place; it was where the weak were prey to the strong until it was terrifying.

As long as you were strong enough, you could obtain respect.

If you were too weak, either submit or die; it was that simple.

Hence, Ye Yuan did not have the least bit of psychological burden regarding killing Lang Ge.

Ye Yuan was just about to enter the city when an old man suddenly blocked his path.

“Little Brother, our family’s master sees that your skills are pretty good and wants to invite you to join the Fan Family. I wonder what do you think?” The old man went straight to the point.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over him and said coolly, “Oh? What are the terms?”

Inside the fiend race cities, martial artists had to join a faction. Otherwise, they would be devoured until not even dregs remained.

Entering the city today, their corpse might be strewn on the streets tomorrow.

Two fists were no match for four hands. No matter how powerful one’s strength was, it could not match people’s numbers too.

In the capital city, there was no lack of Origin Deity Realm powerhouses. Even if it was Ye Yuan who ran into them, it would be certain death too.

The old man smiled and said, “Little Brother’s strength is outstanding, able to kill grand completion Two-star while being at middle-level Two-star. This level of strength, it’s naturally much better than other guest retainers. Our family’s missus said, as long as you agree to join the Fan Family, your treatment will be twice that of ordinary grand completion Two-star guest retainers!”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised, but his gaze turned toward Li Ji who was on the fierce beast.

Li Ji seemed to have been paying attention to the commotion over here all along. Seeing Ye Yuan raise his head, a hint of a smile actually flashed across her face.

That look, that boldness, fieriness, fervor, made people unable to refuse!

“Tsk tsk, this fiend race woman really has another charm when she smiles!” Ye Yuan sighed emotionally in his heart.

Ye Yuan had to admit, this Li Ji was also not the slightest bit inferior compared to the human race’s unrivaled beauties.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said with a nod, “Deal! But I still have a condition!”

The old man smiled and said, “What condition is there, feel free to mention it.”

Ye Yuan said coldly, “I want five slaves!”

The moment the old man heard, he chuckled and said, “I was wondering what condition it was, even if you don’t mention this matter, we’ll also prepare it for you. The Fan Family’s guest retainers will each be assigned with three slaves. As for little brother, you, five is naturally no issue.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and pointed to a middle-aged man in Li Ji’s squadron, saying, “Okay, but ... this person, I want him!”

The old man turned around to look, his face could not help revealing a difficult look as he said, “This ... Although he’s a slave, he’s one of Miss Li Ji’s guards and is deeply trusted by the young lady. This probably ... isn’t appropriate, right?”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Heh, is this the sincerity you speak of? I know that your Fan Family’s strength is very powerful, but it’s also not to the extent where I have to go! Can’t meet eye to eye, so long!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan waved his hand and was about to enter the city.

Suddenly, a figure stopped Ye Yuan’s path. It was precisely Li Ji.

Her pair of beautiful eyes stared at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “A mere demon race slave, what’s the harm in gifting to Sir? Since Sir likes him, just take him.”

In the fiend race, humans and demons could only be reduced to the lowest-ranking slaves, regardless of how powerful their strength.

Ye Yuan laughed loudly and said, “It’s still Miss Li Ji who is straightforward! Miss Li Ji, rest assured. You get what you pay for, Source Night won’t disappoint the young lady! It’s just that I got to have some errand boys under me and need a capable and experienced fellow to manage.”

Source Night was the fiend race name that Ye Yuan gave himself. It was just reversing the name Ye Yuan[1].

Ye Yuan this name was too different from the fiend race’s.

Li Ji smiled and said, “Li Ji understands! Sir’s strength indeed makes Li Ji very surprised. In the future, I’ll have to rely on sir more.”

Ye Yuan swept a glance around and said with a big laugh, “Did Miss Li Ji see their looks? For me to be able to do things by Miss Li Ji’s side, they are endlessly envious! Source Night is a guy too; to be able to serve Miss Li Ji, it’s my honor!”

But Li Ji was all smiles when she heard and said, “Sir Source Night really knows how to speak. Then let’s return to the Fan Family.”

The fiend race admired the strong. The strength that Ye Yuan displayed just now was taken into Li Ji’s sight fully. Plus, Ye Yuan’s looks were handsome, her fiend race woman’s personality also showed itself.

That cold beauty was like a blooming flower at this time.

The gazes that the surrounding people looked toward Ye Yuan with were full of envy.

In the entire Capone Capital City, those able to make Miss Li Ji laugh so happily were not many!

Clearly, Ye Yuan made her mood very good.

To be able to talk in a jovial manner with Miss Li Ji, even if they died, they were willing too!

Li Ji came before that demon race slave and said coolly, “In the future, you’ll follow Sir Source Night!”

The slave bowed and said, “Yes, Miss Li Ji. Long Zhan pays respect to Master[2]!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, a hint of an indiscernible smile appearing at the corners of his mouth.

Li Ji forced out a mark from her glabella, struck it towards Ye Yuan, and said, “This is Long Zhan’s slave seal. In the future, he’s yours.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks for Miss Li Ji’s generosity. This chap looks rather smart. I settled on him at a glance.”

Li Ji smiled and said, “Sir Source Night has such sharp eyes. Among my guards, he’s the smartest.”

Ye Yuan had a pleased look too, accepting it calmly.

In the fiend race, modesty and whatnot would never be regarded as a virtue but would be beneath contempt instead.

With strength, then one could be arrogant, one could be lawless!

With strength, one could accept other people’s praises!

Strength was everything!

Ethical code and moral principles, these things, were all rubbish in the fiend race territory.

“Sir Source Night, let’s go back to the Fan Family!”

Li Ji rode the fierce beast and brought the group of people back to the Fan Family.

The Fan Family was one of Capone Capital City’s four great families. The clan’s strength was immense.

Li Ji was the Fan Family’s beloved daughter, Capone Capital City’s top-rate beauty, admired by countless fiend race men.

However, Ye Yuan naturally wasn’t really charmed by Li Ji that he agreed to join the Fan Family.

In reality, Ye Yuan killing people in rage outside the city gates was deliberately displaying his strength for Li Ji to see.

Sure enough, after Li Ji saw his strength, she came to solicit him.

And the reason for Ye Yuan doing so was for this slave: Long Zhan!

When Long Zhan approached him, the Sacred Dragon Token reacted.

In the Heavenspan World, who could make the Sacred Dragon Token have a reaction?

The answer was already self-evident!

Ye Yuan did not think that coming to Capone Capital City, he could actually meet a person who could make the Sacred Dragon Token have a reaction!

[1] Although the pinyin looks the same, the characters are different. They just have the same pronunciation. In order to not confuse anyone, I decided to go for an English name rather than going Yuan Ye and Ye Yuan back and forth. This way, it’s clearer when he’s being addressed as a fiend.

[2] The Long in Long Zhan is dragon, hint hint.
