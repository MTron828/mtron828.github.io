Chapter 1962: Emperor Bone

“Since I must agree, what’s the difference between asking or not? It’s just that, Senior threatening me with a Jian Family’s member made this Ye broaden his horizons,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The meaning of his words was: Your esteemed self’s shamelessness, this Ye Yuan has seldom seen it in all my life.

No matter how good Ye Yuan’s relationship with Jian Hongxiao was, Jian Hongxiao was a Jian Family’s member in the end.

As the Jian Family’s senior, Jian Sutao actually used a Jian Family’s member to threaten an outsider. This kind of action was truly utterly contemptible.

Jian Sutao did not seem to be embarrassed. He just said coolly, “You have the right to choose.”

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Sutao and said calmly, “Why me?”

Jian Sutao said, “It’s naturally because you’re a child of destiny. Such a monstrous destiny like yours, it’s still this empyrean’s first time seeing.”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly, quietly waiting for him to continue.

“The Ancient God Battlefield is a mystic realm that my Jian Family controls. Legend says that very, very long ago, an earth-shaking ancient god war happened before in the Ancient God Battlefield. The strength of those ancient gods, the weakest was at least at the Celestial Deity Realm. In that unparalleled great battle, there were countless True Gods, even Empyrean powerhouses, that perished in it. There were even many Heavenly Emperor level powerhouses.”

Ye Yuan was slightly startled in his heart. He did not think that this Ancient God Battlefield actually even had Heavenly Emperor powerhouses in it.

What kind of heaven-shocking degree did that kind of war reach?

Although the present Heavenspan World still had endless disputes, it was still relatively calm on the whole, with all kinds of levels very strict.

It was very hard for such a terrifying battle to happen.

“Inside the Ancient God Battlefield, there are countless soul treasures. Every ten thousand years, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets will personally open up this Ancient God Battlefield and send a batch of destiny children inside. Those lucky ones can obtain heaven-defying lucky chances, breaking out of the cocoon and becoming a butterfly. They will be soaring to the sky with one leap. Of course, the Ancient God Battlefield is extremely dangerous. Ancient battle souls, ancient grand arrays, crisscross inside. Also, there are variant species bred during these countless years. It could be said to be beset with danger. Even emperor surmounting auras, those that perish inside each time were also not in the minority,” Jian Sutao explained.

“In that case, those entering the Ancient God Battlefield from Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, it will not just be me alone?” Ye Yuan said.

Jian Sutao nodded and said, “For ten thousand years, this empyrean naturally sought out a batch of destiny children. Whether they are entering inside or not, it is also up to their own decision. But this kind of opportunity is hard to come across in a thousand years. So very few people will refuse.”

Of course, no one would refuse.

Ye Yuan reckoned that those people able to be chosen at least had imperial aura too.

People with this degree of destiny, if they did not even dare to challenge a mystic realm, that was also too cowardly.

Moreover, although this Ancient God Battlefield was perilous, massive lucky chances also went along with it.

Once they obtained some ancient relics, their destinies would be more exuberant, and their future prospects would also have more room.

Perhaps some imperial auras could even break through to the emperor surmounting aura after entering the Ancient God Battlefield.

These children of destiny were the candidates for future Empyreans and Heavenly Emperors.

Honestly speaking, Ye Yuan was indeed quite moved.

“What do you want me to help you retrieve?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jian Sutao said, “Emperor beast divine bone!”

Emperor beast, as the name suggested, was a Heavenly Emperor level divine beast!

This level of a divine beast, each one was a supreme existence of heaven and earth, their strength being fearsome to the extreme.

Even if they had died for many years, the energy contained inside the divine bones was also extremely terrifying.

But Ye Yuan was very clear about it. The place where the emperor beast divine bone was at must be extremely dangerous, far surpassing the limits of his current abilities.

Otherwise, Jian Hongxiao also would not be worried for him.

It was also no wonder that even Jian Sutao, this level of Empyrean powerhouse, would also be moved by it.

“More than 100 thousand years ago, that batch of destiny child entered the Ancient God Battlefield and accidentally discovered a Qilin emperor bone. It’s just too bad that no one could obtain it. Over the past 100 thousand years, this Empyrean had sent people inside each time, wanting to obtain this emperor bone. But sadly, it was all for naught,” Jian Sutao said.

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Sutao and said with a cold smile, “I’m afraid that for the sake of this Qilin emperor bone, quite a few children of destiny all died inside, right?”

Children of destiny had exuberant destinies?

No matter how thriving it was, it was also merely just a reservist force.

While that Qilin divine beast was a genuine Heavenly Emperor powerhouse when it was alive!

Even if it died, how could its dignity be what a junior can blaspheme?

Jian Sutao did not have the intention of concealing, saying with a nod, “The children of destiny who went to retrieve this emperor bone, none of them came back. However ...”

Ye Yuan stopped the other party with a hand gesture and said in a cold voice, “You want to say that you feel very optimistic about me, feeling that I can succeed? Heh, are you treating this Ye to be a three-year-old kid? You rest assured, I’ll take on this task. But whether it succeeds or not, that will depend on your fortune!”

Jian Sutao’s good fortune was naturally obtaining the Qilin emperor bone.

As for Ye Yuan’s fortunes ... it was returning alive.

Jian Sutao originally thought that at Ye Yuan’s age, he should be very easy to control.

But he discovered that he was wrong, this kid was shrewd and cunning, not acting in accordance with the scheme that he planned.

...

Time flew by quickly. Five years passed in a blink of an eye.

But inside the World Suppressing Stele, 50 years had already passed for Ye Yuan.

On this day, the Stellar Hall’s powerhouses gathered together.

Up to the elders, down to the disciples, no one was absent.

“Elder Zhonghui, do you know what City Lord called us here for this time?” Jian Hao asked an elder.

Jian Zhonghui shook his head and said, “How can City Lord’s thoughts be what the likes of us can guess? But the line-up this time is indeed a little big and a little too grand. Could it be that some important figure is coming to our Extreme Luck?”

Ever since Jian Hongxiao returned to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, Jian Hao had always been feeling ill at ease.

Especially recently, this kind of feeling became even stronger.

But he performed a divination for himself but failed to divine anything.

Starting from this morning, Jian Hao had been having the jitters all along, the ominous feeling becoming more and more apparent.

Right at this time, City Lord suddenly summoned all of the Stellar Hall’s disciples. This made Jian Hao’s mood become heavier.

At this time, an awe-inspiring voice echoed out inside the hall, “Suyan, is everyone here?”

Jian Suyan gave a bow and said, “Reporting to City Lord, there’s still one person who isn’t here.”

Jian Sutao fell silent for a moment and opened his mouth and said, “He should be on his way. Let’s start then. Calling you all here today, there’s something to announce. Starting from today, the Stellar Hall will add a new elder. So Jian Hao ... I’ll have to inconvenience you and have you retire to the protector’s seat for the time being.”

Jian Sutao’s voice reverberated inside the hall. But every word that he said was like a clap of thunder, exploding in Jian Hao’s ears.

His seat of elder was ... was gone just like that?

Jian Hao’s expression became extremely ugly. He did not dare to fly off the handle and could only bow. He then said, “City Lord, inside this Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, apart from a few Stellar Hall elders, there shouldn’t be anyone whose strength can compete with mine in the Dao of Divination, right?”

“Originally, there wasn’t. But today ... there is,” Jian Sutao said slowly.

Right at this time, a figure entered the Stellar Hall.

When Jian Hao saw the arrival, he was immediately petrified.
