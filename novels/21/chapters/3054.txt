Chapter 3053: Hegemons Appear!

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone’s hair stand on end.

A living grand array!

A living grand array left behind by a Great Beyond powerhouse!

“This … Heavenly Saint Ye, then what should we do?” Someone panicked.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Take things one step at a time then! Everyone, remember; if there are any more of such treasures, make sure not to act rashly without careful consideration. If you see anything strange, don’t let your curiosity cause trouble!”

Everyone was fearful, nodding their heads one by one as they answered yes.

Compared to treasures, it was naturally life that was more important.

The party continued moving forward. Sure enough, many treasures appeared along the way again.

Some treasures could even help them step into Hegemon Realm.

But, no one dared to move anymore.

As for Ye Yuan, he ignored those treasures without exception.

His thoughts were fully on this grand array.

To him, no treasure was as important as this grand array.

Moreover, wanting to leave this grand array, one had to understand it first!

Several days later, they finally bumped into other teams. It was Kong Tan and Yu Ran’s party.

These two teams had roughly over 3000 people. Now, less than half were remaining!

Clearly, they sustained rather heavy casualties for the sake of treasures.

Seeing Ye Yuan this group of people, Kong Tan and Yu Ran’s pupils could not help constricting.

“This group of people actually did not suffer much loss!” Kong Tan said in a sour tone.

Yu Ran said, “How is this possible? Could it be that none of them took the treasures?”

Kong Tan frowned and said, “I don’t believe that someone can be completely unmoved when facing these treasures!”

When Yang Qing saw Kong Tan’s expression, he laughed loudly and said, “Boy, you can’t make the cut! It’s just been a few days, and half of the people around you have died! Hey, are you all idiots? You’re still following him?”

Kong Tan’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Yang Qing, you’re courting death!”

Yang Qing smiled and said, “Come on, is your Grandpa Yang scared of you? Is the fiend race very remarkable?”

Kong Tan’s expression changed, and he said in a cold voice, “Yang Qing, don’t be smug! After getting out of the Labyrinth Divine Palace, I’ll definitely request Ancestor to act, and make a trip to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

Yang Qing laughed loudly and said, “Then you’ll have to be able to get out of the Labyrinth Divine Palace first too!”

Kong Tan nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

Going on this trip into the Labyrinth Divine Palace, he had mustered everything up, preparing to make an all-out effort.

Suppressing geniuses from all heavens, seizing this position of inheritance.

But, who knew that from the Vertical Heaven Stairs until now, he was suppressed by people all the way. He really felt oppressed to the extreme.

Suddenly, waves of terrifying auras came out of the nearby forest.

The powerful light pricked until people could not open their eyes.

Kong Tan revealed a look of wild elation. A precious treasure came into being!

Only to see a fire-red long spear hanging on the treetop.

A sword was hanging on another tree.

Also, the bell that Ye Yuan they all saw previously was on the ground. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Three chaos heavenly treasures!

A thousand feet away, a stalk of spirit grass was growing on the ground, emitting a shocking undulation.

When Ye Yuan saw it, his pupils constricted too!

Chaos grade heavenly medicine!

As the name implied, this was a heavenly medicine that only Hegemon Realms could take!

This kind of heavenly medicine, even if it was a single stalk, it was a priceless treasure too!

When origin realm powerhouses consumed it, they might be able to break through the fetters in one stroke, reaching the realm of Hegemon!

Apart from these, several items were even scattered in the grass.

With this, even those people behind Ye Yuan could not help but be moved too.

This was intruding upon a group of treasures!

Any one of these things was an existence that drove people crazy.

“Snatch!” Kong Tan yelled, his figure sweeping past swiftly.

Beside him, the feather race and fiend race powerhouses made a move one after another too.

Even if so many people died, they did not care in the slightest too.

When were there no deaths when snatching treasures?

But, on Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven this side, not a single person moved.

Kong Tan and Yu Ran were extremely surprised. They were all on alert against Ye Yuan and his group. In the end, none of them moved.

Puu, puu, puu!

Not far away from Kong Tan, more than ten fiends instantly exploded, deader than dead.

But no one hesitated.

Yu Ran’s movement technique was extremely fast and was actually in front of Kong Tan.

In a blink of an eye, she was going to touch that red long spear!

The undulation emitting from this long spear was extremely strong. It already faintly reached the power of a middle grade chaos heavenly treasure.

Clearly, this was the most important one out of these treasures!

Kong Tan’s pupils constricted and he cried angrily, “Yu Ran, you dare!”

Yu Ran laughed charmingly and said,?“Hehehe,?treasures of heaven and earth are obtained by those who are fated. Why would I not dare?”

No one could remain composed in front of benefits.

Yu Ran this kind of peerless fairy maiden was the same too.

But right at this time, a large group of people dashed out of the dense woods again. It was shockingly the likes of Wang Ningyan and Qin Baichuan.

Precious treasures coming into being, all parties gathered together once again!

It looked like Yu Ran was about to score the long spear.

In the fiend race, a fiend figure suddenly erupted, shouting coldly, “Stinking lass, the Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear isn’t what you can encroach upon!”

This sudden change made everyone dumbstruck with shock.

Hegemon Realm!

A Hegemon Realm actually appeared among the fiends!

“Humph!?Kong Hai, with your paltry skills, you also want to get the Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear?” Before his voice faded, a powerful aura also erupted from the feather race.

Another Hegemon Realm!

“What a joke! Such a precious treasure, when is it your turn?”

“Hahaha,?Kong Hai, Yu Xian, just the likes of you probably can’t get the Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear!”

“Get lost! Otherwise, I’ll kill you all right now!”

… …

On humanity’s side, the auras of five Hegemon Realms erupted at the same time.

Five people appeared all at once!

Wang Ningyan, Qin Baichuan, and the rest were all stunned.

They were completely kept in the dark previously!

Seven Hegemon Realms appeared in an instant. How could they not be surprised?

Originally thought that this was a battle of inheritance.

Who knew that there would be Hegemon Realms involved?

Did Hegemon Realms’ still need Hegemon Heavenless’ inheritance?

Seven great Hegemons instantly gathered together from seven different directions.

But very soon, the seven people’s expressions suddenly changed.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

The sound of seven explosions echoed out. The seven great Hegemons were directly blasted away, flying out.

Clearly, they had triggered the array formation again just now!

However, Hegemon Realms were Hegemon Realms. They were clearly not so easy to be killed.

The seven people got up from the ground, expressions all very unfriendly.

“Martial Aunt Yun Xiang, why are you here?” Wang Ningyan said in pleasant surprise.

With a Hegemon Realm around, she suddenly felt a lot more confident.

Among humanity’s three great Hegemons, there was one that was the Purple Extreme Heaven Pavilion’s female Hegemon, Hegemon Yun Xiang.

Hegemon Yun Xiang had a dark look as she said, “Do you really think that Heavenless that old ghost will give you guys the inheritance? You brats are too naive!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed drastically.

Wang Ningyan said in surprise, “Martial Aunt Yun Xiang, what do you mean?”

Hegemon Yun Xiang said, “Old Man Heavenless’s methods are exceedingly formidable. Back then, when all the heavens joined forces, it did not even kill him completely! This kind of wildly ambitious person, do you think that he’ll give you all the inheritance? This Labyrinth Divine Palace is merely a scheme; that’s all!”

Wang Ningyan said in surprise, “Then why did Ancestor still let us come?”

Yun Xiang said, “The Labyrinth Divine Palace has once gathered treasures from all heavens! This is a huge lucky chance!”
