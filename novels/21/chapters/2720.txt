Chapter 2726: Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Wei Yu only felt his head spin, his eyes full of stars.

When he got to his feet, there was shockingly a hoof print on his face, looking extremely garish.

When many people saw this scene, they all could not resist laughing.

But at the same time, they were shocked by Big Yellow’s power.

There was clearly no divine essence fluctuation, but he could knock Wei Yu away with a kick. This was not what ordinary true spirits could do.

And Big Yellow truly looked like an unbelievably ordinary large yellow bull.

“Heh,?you all think that what I, old taoist, takes fancy on, can be ordinary stuff? This large yellow bull is a chaos aberrant. Every movement and action carries rule undulations. With some slight training, stepping into Saint Sovereign Heaven in the future isn’t impossible either! It’s just that, landed in this brat’s hands is really a bright pearl being cast into darkness!:

Taoist Wu Fang showed off while shaking his head and sighing.

It was just that he did not know that Big Yellow was not some chaos aberrant at all, but a genuine Saint Exalt true spirit!

If not for him deliberately hiding his strength, that kick earlier would have directly burst Wei Yu’s head.

Wei Yu got to his feet and shook his head hard, only then recovering some lucidity.

“Damn punk, to actually dare provoke my Seven-star Heavenly Sect! Everyone, attack together, as long as you kill this boy, I, Wei Yu, owe him a favor!” Wei Yu glared at Ye Yuan and bellowed.

The moment this was said, everyone was moved.

Wei Yu had virtually already locked-in the next Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s sect master.

His favor was rather valuable!

Hence, they could not resist taking action.

The dozen over middle and upper Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses present, the commotion could be seen at a glance.

But Ye Yuan still instructed very calmly, “Big Yellow, step on them.”

Bang, bang, bang?…

Big Yellow kicked his hooves like lightning, each move hitting its mark.

In a few breaths, each person’s face had a large ox hoof imprinted on it.

Of course, Wei Yu’s face had another one imprinted on it.

While Zong Rui had a shocked face, instantly having a feeling of having his face slapped.

He was previously still ridiculing that Ye Yuan was imitating others and losing his own individuality.

But who knew that this unassuming large yellow bull was actually so formidable.

More than ten Jade Sovereign Heavens were taken care of by him with two to three kicks.

“Big Yellow, come on.” Ye Yuan ignored everyone’s shocked gazes, pulling Big Yellow and slowly leaving.

While Taoist Wu Fang’s two eyes emitted light.

He liked this Big Yellow more and more.

Seeing Big Yellow, he currently felt that those true spirits in his bag of holding were simply a bunch of trash!

Wei Yu struggled to his feet, wanting to stabilize his figure.

In the end, his body swayed and he fell down again.

He shouted, “Punk, what capability is it to rely on your mount that’s powerful? If you have the guts, fight with me yourself!”

Ye Yuan turned his head and said coolly,?“Oh,?is that so? Why don’t you say this to Taoist Wu Fang?”

When Wei Yu heard that, he could not help choking.

Taoist Wu Fang would never make a move himself when he fought and killed people.

But no one dared to say that he was no good.

Wei Yu gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Punk, if you have the capability, don’t run! We’ll settle this score again!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Alright, I’ll wait for you.”

Taking two steps, Ye Yuan’s footsteps suddenly stopped.

His gaze looked towards a stall in the marketplace.

“Heh,?Big Yellow, your luck is pretty good! Didn’t expect to actually encounter a stalk of Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower here!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Big Yellow’s entire body trembled, his bull eyes going wide and his entire body trembling excitedly.

He did not know what Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower was, but he knew that since Ye Yuan said so, then it must be a heavenly pill suitable for him!

Sure enough, following Master Ye would have meat to eat!

No, wait, it was pills to eat!

The stall owner was a geezer. Seeing Ye Yuan lead Big Yellow over, he could not help sizing Ye Yuan up very interestedly.

This small-scale marketplace was on the road that must be passed through when going up or down the mountain.

Therefore, that was why there would be so many people here.

Just now, when Big Yellow had a grand display of invincible might, the geezer naturally saw it too.

“Fellow Daoist, wonder how you’re selling this Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower?” Ye Yuan said.

Before the geezer could speak, Wei Yu already arrived next to him and shouted, “Shi Yue, I’m buying this Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower!”

Ye Yuan frowned, already having killing intent aroused.

He came to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect for other objectives, so he did not want to be conspicuous.

However, this Wei Yu provoked him time and again, did he really think that he did not dare to kill people?

Shi Yue said coolly, “Only exchanging, not selling!”

Ye Yuan said, “What manner of exchange?”

Shi Yue said, “One Four Qi Pill!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower exchange for a heavenly imperial pill, it’s demanding too exorbitant a price, right?”

Shi Yue smiled and said, “What’s rare is expensive!”

Wei Yu laughed loudly and said, “Where did this country bumpkin come from? He’s probably never even seen before a Four Qi Pill, right? Shi Yue, I want this Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower, it just so happens that I have a Four Qi Pill on me!”

The heavenly medicines that grade four heavenly imperial pills required were all extremely precious on Rainclear Continent.

Therefore, grade four heavenly imperial pills were extremely valuable too.

For ordinary martial artists, forget about consuming grade four heavenly imperial pills, they probably never even seen one before.

But a large sect’s disciple like Wei Yu could take out this kind of valuable heavenly pill.

As he said, Wei Yu fished out a heavenly pill, it was precisely the Four Qi Pill.

When bystanders saw this heavenly pill, they naturally had envious looks on their faces.

Who knew that Shi Yue received the heavenly pill and took a look, then returned it to Wei Yu again and said while shaking his head, “Your Four Qi Pill is only upper fourth grade, I want to exchange for seventh grade and above!”

Wei Yu’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Shi Yue, you’re too immoral! A stalk of heavenly medicine, you want to exchange for a seventh grade heavenly imperial pill? Putting aside whether or not it’s worth this price, apart from those few top elders in the Pill Alliance, someone who can refine a seventh grade Four Qi Pill probably hasn’t been born in this world yet, right?”

Shi Yue smiled and said, “Therefore, I’m just trying my luck. If there really isn’t, I don’t mind either. This Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower is a rare commodity in short supply. I am not afraid of being unable to sell it either, isn’t that so?”

Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower was indeed extremely rare on Rainclear Continent.

It might not even be in the Pill Alliance.

This kind of precious heavenly medicine, he naturally did not worry about not being able to sell it.

Wei Yu was originally very angry, but at the thought that since he could not take out a seventh grade, Ye Yuan naturally would not be able to take one out either. He immediately calmed down a lot in his heart.

“Seventh grade is it? That’s not difficult. I can help you refine it. But you must gather the Four Qi Pill’s heavenly medicines yourself,” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Shi Yue shook his head and said, “I’m an itinerant cultivator, I don’t have the Four Qi Pill’s heavenly medicines. If you can’t take it out, let’s not talk at this time.”

He was not fearful of Big Yellow. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After all, he was a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse.

His strength was extremely formidable.

Wei Yu was known for being able to deal with grand completion Jade Sovereign Heavens. But, that was also just ordinary grand completion Jade Sovereign Heavens.

He, Shi Yue, was very extraordinary!

Wei Yu laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Looking at your poor and shabby appearance, I think you can’t gather the Four Qi Pill’s heavenly medicines either!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he could only let out a sigh and said, “Like this huh, then it’s really too regrettable! Since you’re not selling, then I can only make a move to snatch it.”

Shi Yue chuckled and said, “Little Brother, your large yellow bull’s strength is pretty good, it’s just that want to deal with this old man …”

Before Shi Yue finished speaking, a bull hood already arrived in front of his face..
