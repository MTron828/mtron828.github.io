Chapter 2782: Getting Stronger the More He Fought!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Heavenly Dao ... is enraged!’ Big Yellow looked toward the horizon and muttered.

But Luo Yunqing stomped his feet in anxiety and shouted angrily, “This boy is too reckless! Pointing at heaven with the sword, isn’t this seeking death?”

This sword was not an ordinary sword, but Ye Yuan’s Dao sword!

This Dao sword was condensed and formed from Ye Yuan’s lifetime cultivation!

This sword pointing at heaven was questioning the way of heaven!

It was provoking Heavenly Dao!

How could it be tolerated?

Myriad Demons Mountain, Saint Exalt Bull Demon, Saint Exalt Giant Ape, and the rest looked at the firmament from afar, incredibly shocked.

“Is this guy mad?”

“Pointing at the sky with the sword, the firmament is furious! It will probably bring down Dao tribulation again this time, right?”

“Most likely, he’s going to immediately transcend a two-nine Dao tribulation! Tsk tsk, not resigning himself to circumstances and experiencing life and death! Ye Yuan is going to force himself into a desperate situation so that he can risk it all! However ... can he pull through?”

The three great Saint Exalts could not help snickering when they saw this scene from afar.

Confronting Heaven was clearly an act of courting death.

Originally, he could drag out an ignorable existence. However, he insisted on bringing about his own destruction.

Extremely far away, Saint Exalt Waycloud and the rest of the Saint Sovereign Heavens were startled one after another.

They moved out in succession and gathered in the sky above Myriad Demons Mountain.

“Huhu, this kid is indeed a restless one. His last resort should be this, right? That’s good too. Since he’s taking the road to ruin himself, it saves us the trouble of having to take action,” Saint Exalt Waycloud could not help laughing as he said.

Saint Exalt Skyfortune laughed in spite of himself and said, “He really dares to point at heaven with his sword! Asking heaven if it’s unfair? Does he have this qualification?”

Waycloud smiled and said, “Let’s just watch a good show here.”

... ...

Ye Yuan pointed his sword at the sky. Heavenly Dao was enraged and sent down Dao tribulation.

The sensation caused this time was even more terrifying than that time previously.

In less than a year, Ye Yuan triggered a Dao tribulation again. This sort of thing was simply unheard of since ancient times.

Two-nine Dao tribulation; it meant two nine laws Dao tribulations!

This was also to say that the Dao tribulation raining down this time was 18 power of rules!

Nine laws Dao tribulation was already terrifying to the extreme.

The power of a two-nine Dao tribulation was naturally even more terrifying.

But the Ye Yuan who was in the center of the storm seemed to be completely clueless.

He was condensing his own Dao!

The sword in the Tai Chi diagram became larger and larger and increasingly solid! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The aura also became more and more horrifying.

And following the solidification of this sword, the aura coming from above the avoid also became more and more terrifying.

“Kid, you can really stir trouble! A two-nine Dao tribulation is likely no match for this aura! I reckon that it might very likely be straight-up a three-nine Dao tribulation!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Who cares how many nine laws Dao tribulation it is! Regardless of how many that will come, I’ll receive them! I’ll bet my Dao and defy this heaven!”

Mi Tian said with a cold snort, “Don’t blame me for not warning you. This sword is connected to your life now. If the Dao sword shatters, your life will be gone!”

Ye Yuan was not betting his Dao but betting his life!

Condensing Dao sword was giving up on following heaven. In the future, he could only go against heaven and change his fate!

Each step would be a hundred times harder than other martial artists!

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Rather than willingly be ordinary, why not defy heaven and change fate!”

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly got up, looked at the sky from afar, and muttered, “It’s here!”

Boom!

His voice had yet to fade when a clap of thunder sounded in the sky.

The ocean was directly blown apart.

Ye Yuan only felt an overwhelming force, as if going to crush him.

“Three-nine Dao tribulation! This boy really provoked the wrath of heaven!” Saint Exalt Waycloud’s expression changed abruptly as he said.

Even when separated so far away, his heart also jumped fiercely at this sound of thunder clapping.

It could be imagined what kind of enormous pressure Ye Yuan who was located at the center of the storm would have to bear!

Saint Exalt Skyfortune smiled and said, “You all try to guess. How many bolts of Dao tribulation can he make it through?”

“Three!”

“Five!”

“Nine!” Saint Exalt Waycloud glanced at everyone and said smilingly, “Got to say, this boy is a peerless genius, overwhelming the present era! Even if it’s three-nine Dao tribulation, it’s impossible for him to survive nine too!”

“I ask heaven with my Dao! Go!”

Ye Yuan bellowed, his palm pushing toward the sky!

The giant sword pierced right through the sky and met with this clap of thunder!

This clap of thunder was invisible!

27 power of rules was all in this invisible clap of thunder.

Boom!

It was only to hear a loud noise. The ocean was directly divided into two halves, deep until the bottom could be seen!

Ye Yuan gave a muffled groan, fresh blood spurting wildly from his mouth.

Fine cracks actually appeared on his Dao sword!

“Damn it! Three-nine Dao tribulation is too strong. Master Ye can’t hold on at all! At this rate, I’m afraid that when the third Dao tribulation falls, his Dao sword will shatter!” Big Yellow said anxiously when he saw the situation.

Each and every one of the Land of Heavenly South’s powerhouses had solemn expressions.

Suddenly, Luo Yunqing’s expression changed, and he said, “You guys, look! His Dao sword is repairing!”

Big Yellow took a closer look and said in surprise, “He ... He’s using the power of rules in the Dao tribulation to repair the Dao sword and strengthen it!”

When the Dao tribulation landed, it naturally would not return to nothingness immediately.

The rule fragments would scatter around before becoming one with heaven and earth!

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword was absorbing these rule fragments to strengthen itself!

Very soon, not only was Ye Yuan’s Dao sword as good as new, it became even more solid instead!

Ye Yuan raised his head to the sky and howled loudly, “Again!”

As if sensing Ye Yuan’s provocation, another series of Dao tribulation exploded with a loud bang.

Ye Yuan raised his sword and charged again!

Boom!

It exploded again!

Ye Yuan’s entire body was dyed in blood, but he became more courageous the more he fought.

His Dao sword absorbed the rule fragments and solidified again!

“Hahaha ... you want to sever my road of martial arts; I’ll seize your Great Dao rules! So what if it’s the road of defying heaven?”

Ye Yuan stood proudly in the sky, akin to a fiend god, letting out a loud laugh.

Bang, bang, bang ...

Bolts of Dao tribulation lightning landed, the power becoming stronger each time.

But Ye Yuan grew stronger the more he fought!

His cultivation realm also advanced crazily in this Dao tribulation!

Not only did the Dao tribulation not beat him down, it made Ye Yuan achieve success instead.

In the sea of consciousness, Mi Tian was staring dumbfoundedly.

The road of defying heaven could still be walked like this?

Seizing the Dao of heaven and feeding it back to himself!

“This boy ... is really a wonder! The Dao tribulation of divergent cultivators is a lot stronger than ordinary martial artists. Each time, it’s walking on the edge of death. This boy is good, to actually use this kind of method to overcome the tribulation!” Mi Tian was rendered speechless.

But he knew that even if it’s a divergent cultivator, it was virtually impossible to want to achieve this too!

Plundering Dao tribulation fragments, this in itself required an extremely deep understanding of Great Dao.

These fragments could not be grabbed and used but needed to be rearranged.

Randomly absorbing them, not only would there be no benefits, it would cause great harm to oneself instead.

Forget that Ye Yuan was just a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven. Even a Hegemon Realm powerhouse might not be able to accomplish it!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Above the sky, claps of thunder fell, each fiercer than the last.

But Ye Yuan was akin to a stubborn rock, not budging an inch!

Although he was seriously injured, after the baptism of Dao tribulation, his cultivation realm obtained rapid growth.

Finally, the Dao tribulation seemed to be tired too, vanishing into thin air.

Everything returned to tranquility.

And Ye Yuan’s sword was still pointing to the sky proudly!

But his realm improved further and reached middle-stage lower Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Everyone paying attention to Ye Yuan overcoming the tribulation was completely stunned.
