Chapter 1559 Comparing Notes

“Comparing notes? Not interested!”

Some random guy that he did not know wanted to compare notes with him. How could he have so much free time to entertain the guy?

He already cured Little Fatty now and already had no worries. He could choose to not give anyone face.

At the very most, he would hide in the Purple Extreme Hall and run away.

With a true god mystic treasure, even this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s city lord could not breach its defenses too.

Therefore, Ye Yuan had nothing to fear right now.

The old man’s face turned stiff, clearly not expecting that Ye Yuan was so disrespectful.

Even if he did not know him, in this imperial city, mentioning the Pill Tower’s name, he had never been so disregarded before.

But Xuan Yu was good-tempered and did not get angry. He was just about to open his mouth and exchange greetings but saw a group of people come out of the inner hall.

Seeing Xuan Yu, Xiao Feng’s entire body trembled and he said in disbelief, “Could Sir be ... Master Xuan Yu?”

Xuan Yu did not recognize Xiao Feng but was somewhat surprised too. This place actually still had a Four-star Alchemy God.

“Huhu, it’s precisely this old man. Pardon this old man for not remembering if I’ve seen you before, but I wonder who your esteemed self is?” Xuan Yu said with a faint smile.

Xiao Feng gave a bow respectfully and said, “Junior is the Myriad Treasure Tower’s Xiao Feng. The last time the Pill Tower hosted a sermon, Junior was lucky enough to listen to Master’s teachings!”

Xuan Yu smiled and was indifferent to it.

The alchemists who heard him preach on Dao before in this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City were truly too many. He naturally could not remember all of them.

“So that’s how it is! But why would the Myriad Treasure Tower’s alchemist be here?” Xuan Yu asked curiously.

“Master Master Xiao and that guy are old acquaintances. They knew each other very long ago already,” at this time, Ning Siyu suddenly spoke up.

Regarding Xuan Yu’s arrival, she did not feel surprised. It was just that she did not expect that he would come so quickly.

“Master?”

Xiao Feng’s gaze turned intent, looking at Ning Siyu in great surprise.

He completely did not expect that this girl’s background was actually so great.

Xuan Yu was an authority-class figure in the Pill Tower. She was actually Xuan Yu’s disciple!

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised too, not expecting that this old man was actually Ning Siyu’s master.

But this way, it could be explained too. Most likely, the other party saw the Gale Celestial Stone Pill, that was why he would come to find him to compare notes.

“Master Xuan Yu coming here, could it be for Ye Yuan?” Xiao Feng was not stupid either, guessing a trace of inkling very quickly.

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “Yes. I heard that Master Ye’s Alchemy Dao is peerless and specially came to ask for advice.”

Xiao Feng’s pupils constricted. Although he knew that Ye Yuan was very formidable, for even Master Xuan Yu to also respectfully call Ye Yuan ‘master’, it still made him feel extremely uncomfortable.

One had to know that if Master Xuan Yu stomped his feet, this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would quake!

His attainments in alchemy were also far from what the average Four-star Alchemy God could compare to. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Now, he was actually so humble in front of Ye Yuan!

But Ning Siyu came to Xuan Yu’s side in a huff, pulled him away, and said, “Master, don’t exchange notes with this guy anymore. He isn’t worthy! Humph!”

Xuan Yu was somewhat surprised by Ning Siyu’s attitude. This girl lauded Ye Yuan to the skies, so why did it seem like they fell out in a blink of an eye?

He was not pulled away by Ning Siyu, but asked doubtfully, “Lass, what’s wrong?”

Ning Siyu stomped her feet and recounted the matter of Huang Qian uncle and nephew angrily and said, “Master, don’t you think that this guy is infuriating? Not worthy of taking on any responsibility, still call master!”

Xuan Yu looked at Ning Siyu, and then he looked at Ye Yuan again, and suddenly said with a smile, “Lass, what do you know? That uncle and nephew two people are Wu Feng’s subordinates. Wu Feng also had a life-saving grace toward them. Although killing them is rather despicable, others can’t talk behind his back at all! You ask Master Ye to intervene, what identity would he use to go and intervene? There’s no justifiable reason!”

When Ning Siyu heard that Master actually stood on Ye Yuan’s side, she could not help saying angrily, “Why are you like this too, Master? Need what justifiable reason? Directly capture him, will other people still dare to make idle talk?”

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “You lass, so impatient, craving for the world to be plunged into chaos! Master Ye is merely initial-stage Origin Deity, not only is the Deyi Hall’s own strength formidable, but they also have all kinds of connections with the Dongfang Family and the Pill Tower. You asked him to go and intervene, isn’t this sending him into the tiger’s maws?”

Ning Siyu was anxiously and reproved, “Then ... could it be that we’re not going to do anything?”

“Huhu, you lass! Did he say that he’s not caring? Alright, you shouldn’t worry, don’t be concerned about it too much. Otherwise, go back and face the wall for three years!” Xuan Yu said with a smile.

The moment she heard this, Ning Siyu immediately shriveled up.

“Not worrying about it then! Humph!” Ning Siyu made a funny face at Ye Yuan.

But she also felt much more relieved in her heart. She knew that Master definitely saw through something, that was why he would say so.

Ye Yuan was also very surprised. This old man saw it clear as day and seemed to have already seen through him.

Sure enough, this was not a simple old man.

“Turns out that Senior is Siyu’s master. I’ve offended Senior earlier. Since Senior wants to compare notes on Alchemy Dao, then enter the inner hall and chat then,” Ye Yuan said and clasped his hands together.

Xuan Yu could not suppress laughter and said, “I didn’t expect that in this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, this old man actually had to rely on my disciple’s face to achieve my goal one day, haha!”

Wherever Xuan Yu went, there were always many attendants crowding around. Who was not respectful to him?

Who knew that today, an Origin Deity Realm junior actually did not even pay attention to him.

Ye Yuan’s attitude clearly changed because of Ning Siyu. This made him unable to resist mocking himself.

Entering the inner hall, Ye Yuan opened his mouth and said, “I wonder how Senior wants to compare notes?”

Xuan Yu had clearly long thought about it and immediately said, “Make it pill refining then!”

Ning Siyu immediately spoke up, “Master, you’re a Four-star Alchemy God, isn’t this bullying people?”

Xuan Yu pulled a long face and said disgruntledly, “Go to one side and watch! In a while, when Master Ye and I refine pills, you learn properly. It’s sufficient for you to benefit for life! Competing in pill refinement with Master Ye, what we’re competing in are naturally rank three divine pills!”

Ning Siyu muttered to herself and retreated to one side reluctantly.

While Xiao Feng was extremely excited. These two people sparing in pill refinement was absolutely the greatest flourishing moment in the entire history of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

But the audience were only him and Ning Siyu, two people. This was a massive lucky chance!

Chasing away Ning Siyu, Xuan Yu turned to Ye Yuan again and said, “This old man prepared ten kinds of pill formulas and prepared two sets of spirit medicines for each pill formula. Let’s each refine ten of the same medicinal pill, how about it?”

Ye Yuan was naturally indifferent and said with a nod, “Up to your preference!”

Xuan Yu nodded his head and said, “Then I’ll go first! The first kind of medicinal pill, Silvermoon Pointstar Pill.”

For the sake of fairness, Xuan Yu only used a rank three medicinal cauldron too. It was the medicinal cauldron that he used when he was still a Three-star Alchemy God.

The moment Xuan Yu made his move, there was naturally the air of a master.

Condensing the embryo, dowsing, refining the pill, it was done in one go.

Ye Yuan observed from the sidelines and could not help secretly nodding.

As expected, worthy of being an important character that even Xiao Feng admired. This pill refining technique could absolutely count as a master.

“Silvermoon Pointstar Pill, the primary ingredient is Silvermoon Weed, Pointstar Seed, two kinds of rank three spirit medicines. But the key lies in the fusion of supplementary materials ...”

After Xuan Yu started refining the pill, Ye Yuan suddenly started reviewing it softly.

Xiao Feng’s and Ning Siyu’s eyes turned sharp and hurriedly perked their ears up, staring at Xuan Yu with utmost concentration at the same time.
