Chapter 1555 Give Me a Proper Lesson

“Hahaha, you guys finally came!”

When Ye Yuan saw Little Fatty, he immediately gave him a bear hug.

Not seeing him for a long time, Ye Yuan was extremely excited.

Ning Siyu clicked her tongue in wonder looking by the side. In her eyes, Ye Yuan had always had the demeanor of a master. She did not expect that he actually still had such a side.

Xie Jingyi was agitated until his face was somewhat flushed and he said, “Good brother, I missed you to death!”

“B-Big Brother Ye!” Liang Wanru was a little shy but very happy.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Young Sister Wanru, your improvement isn’t small! Haha!”

Liang Wanru smiled and said, “Isn’t it still all thanks to the medicinal pills Big Brother Ye left for me? Otherwise, with Wanru’s talent, how can I break through so fast?”

At this time, Liang Wanru already broke through to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm. It could be said astonishingly fast already.

Ye Yuan had long explained to Liang Wanru that they should address each other as siblings.

Even though the sincere feelings in Liang Wanru’s heart had yet to fade, she could only accept this fact.

By the side, Xiao Feng marveled endlessly and said with a bitter smile, “This old man really didn’t expect that it was you, this punk, who opened this Miracle Hand Parlor! Thinking back now, apart from you, who else dares to claim to grant all requests?”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “It was an action that couldn’t be helped too. The conditions for entering the inner city are too harsh. As a last resort, I can only make the commotion a little bigger and draw you guys over.”

Xiao Feng smiled bitterly and said, “Your commotion isn’t small. Right now, in the inner city, many major forces all know that the outer city has a ‘Will Grant All Requests’ already!”

Ning Siyu’s eyes swiveled around. Only then she understood that it turned out Ye Yuan hanging this signboard was actually in order to draw these three people over!

The first time she saw Ye Yuan, she felt that this guy was unbelievably arrogant.

But getting to know him, she discovered that Ye Yuan was not that kind of arrogant people, and she could not help being somewhat curious why Ye Yuan would hang such a show-off signboard.

She did not expect that it was actually to draw his friends out of the inner city!

Ning Siyu could not help being somewhat speechless. Only Ye Yuan, this kind of big-shot, could use this kind of whimsical method to attain his objective, right?

If it were somebody else, clearly inside a city, but the inner city and outer city could stop them for all their lives!

When Ye Yuan challenged five major factions alone, it was really cool to the max.

The Ye Yuan at that time gave her a feeling, that was invincibility!

Alchemy Dao was invincible!

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “This is also something that can’t be helped. You guys know, I’m actually very low-profile.”

Hearing this, the three people could not help rolling their eyes.

Xiao Feng billowed his beard and glared as he said, “You punk, you nearly turned Wu Meng Capital City upside down, you actually still dare to say that you’re low-profile!”

“Haha, that was an accident!” Ye Yuan laughed and said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xiao Feng was just making a joke and did not continue to make fun of Ye Yuan regarding this matter. He knew that Wu Meng Capital City’s incident was not Ye Yuan’s fault.

Ye Yuan’s high-profile was completely forced out.

“But your nerves are really great, to actually dare secretly return to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City! Qin Xiao still has some power in the Martial Tower, you got to be careful! Once the matter of you returning is known by him, he’ll definitely think of ways to deal with you,” Xiao Feng said.

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said disdainfully, “His dog life, I’ll claim it sooner or later. Even though I can’t deal with him right now, for him to want to kill me again, he can’t do it!”

Xiao Feng’s eyes lit up. It looked like Ye Yuan had quite a few fortuitous encounters again drifting around outside these few years!

Only then did Xiao Feng discover that Ye Yuan’s realm already broke through to the Origin Deity Realm.

This cultivation speed was a little too fast, right?

When he left back then, he was just at the initial-stage Heaven Glimpse Realm!

In merely ten years from start to end, he actually directly broke through a major realm.

“Huhu, you punk can’t be gauged with common sense! Alright, since we found you, go to the inner city together with us then!” Xiao Feng laughed and said.

With the Myriad Treasure Tower’s strength, letting Ye Yuan enter the inner city was naturally a cinch.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No hurry, the reason I urgently used this kind of method to meet you guys is actually that there’s still something more important.”

Xiao Feng said puzzledly, “What is it?”

Ye Yuan took out a jade box and passed it to Xie Jingyi, saying, “Fatty, this is my promise to you! Today, I can fulfill it!”

Xie Jingyi’s entire body trembled and he said in disbelief, “This ... Could this be ...”

He suddenly recalled that back then, when he had just woken up, Ye Yuan told him that he would definitely find a way to help him restore his divine sea!

At that time, Ye Yuan did not care about it at all, thinking that Ye Yuan was just consoling him, that was why he would say so.

Was it possible that ... this guy really did it?

How was this possible?

These few years, Xiao Feng even found the Myriad Treasure Tower’s Four-star Alchemy God to help diagnose him, but nobody could do it!

His divine sea was virtually completely wasted; unable to recover at all.

Xiao Feng even spent a huge price inviting the Pill Tower’s elder to take action and could not get his wish too.

These few years, Xie Jingyi was actually very decadent.

Becoming a cripple, this was not a life that he wanted.

He lost his family, lost the person he loved. Now, even his cultivation was gone. This made him almost despair.

These few years, he practically drowned his sorrows in alcohol everyday.

When Xiao Feng saw him like this, he was powerless too.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Good brother, you only became like this because of me! Not treating you, I’ll feel uneasy for all my life. Don’t be so agitated. Huhu, it’s also thanks to you I guess, that I improved a step further in Alchemy Dao!”

The muscles on Little Fatty’s face were quivering. On the one hand, it was because of excitement. On the other, it was because he was moved.

Getting such a brother, what else did he need?

But the Xiao Feng by the side trembled all over and said in disbelief, “You ... You really did it? Actually, me bringing Xie Jingyi here today is just wanting to try our luck. You punk ... which step did you walk until in Alchemy Dao?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. But ... I seem to have stepped into another realm. As for the specifics, I can’t say for sure too.”

Xiao Feng sucked in a cold breath. He knew that when Ye Yuan was at the Grotto Profound Deity Realm back then, his understanding towards Alchemy Dao was already incomparably profound.

Stepping into another realm now, what kind of inconceivable world was that?!

Alchemists who knew Dao Realm existed were just in the small minority.

Master Xuan Yu only heard of this realm under a very coincidental situation too.

Even Dustless did not know about the Dao Realm, this state.

However, the Ning Siyu by side was incomparably certain at this time and this other state was Dao Realm!

She did not expect that this guy really stepped into Dao Realm!

This guy was too heaven-defying!

“Doesn’t matter! Since I caught you, this brat, you have to give me a proper lesson this time! After breaking through to Four-star Alchemy God, I feel that it’s hard to trudge along. It’s very difficult to have breakthroughs again. Just nice, can find you, boy, to clarify my doubts!” Xiao Feng said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Haha, Brother Xiao is too modest. We definitely should discuss things! Fatty, you go into seclusion then. This Heart Healing Heavenly Mark Pill can definitely help you recover to your peak state. Us brothers will challenge the pugilistic world again!”

Hearing Ye Yuan talked about it heroically, Little Fatty also felt his heart stir, recalling the deed of slapping the little demoness back then.
