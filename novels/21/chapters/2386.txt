Chapter 2392: Giving a Man a Fish Is Not as Good as Teaching Him How to Fish

When Ye Yuan set up formations, he had always accomplished it at one stroke.

The array formation that he set up for five years, it could be imagined how complicated it was.

During these five years, he could be said to have exhausted his mind and body, connecting his comprehensions and source laws to the maximum limit, expending a lot of energy.

These inheritance grand arrays not only contained his own comprehensions, but they also contained the cultivation methods for Five Element Laws as well as lightning law.

Although Ye Yuan did not cultivate the Five Element Laws, he had fought with Wan Zhen before and had his own unique understanding of the balance of the Five Element Laws.

Although his realm was not high, his horizons were extremely far.

It could be said that the height he was standing at now was unmatched by anyone.

He was standing at the height equal to heaven!

There were thousands of Great Daos. Reaching the extreme was arriving at the same destination via different means.

Regardless of which kind of law, what it pointed to in the end was all ‘Dao.’

He did not cultivate the five elements, but it did not hinder him from helping other people cultivate the five elements with array formations.

These inheritance grand arrays were extremely cumbersome, but in the end, there were only 18 grand arrays!

After Ye Yuan finished setting it up, he himself also jumped in fright.

These 18 grand arrays, didn’t it correspond precisely to the 18 grand ancestors later on?

Could it be that the 18 grand ancestors were all nurtured from his grand arrays?

“Didn’t you all want to become stronger? Alright, all go and test it out then. I want to see which of you have the highest talent,” Ye Yuan said with a look of amusement.

Ye Yuan’s expression triggered everyone all at once.

Didn’t you all say that I wasn’t teaching? Now, I’ve built the house. Just see if you guys have the ability to carry it away or not.

Shang Hang gritted his teeth and said, “I’ll go!”

As he said, he plunged head-first into the spatial grand array.

“Pffft!”

Shang Hang just entered the grand array and was immediately bounced back, severely wounded and vomiting blood.

The group of geniuses had shocked faces. How to play like this?

Ye Yuan looked at Shang Hang and said, “Start from the beginning. Don’t reach beyond your grasp! Is your foundation really laid solidly? These grand arrays require you all to start over from the top one step at a time. Rashly rushing the formation will be life-threatening.”

Shang Hang had a gloomy look as he said, “Why didn’t you say it earlier?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “In order to make you suffer a bit.”

Shang Hang rolled his eyes, but he realized that justice was not on his side. He could not say anything either.

Entering the formation again, the geniuses were all very cautious, starting from the beginning.

They chose the inheritance grand array that they were most adept in and entered inside.

The longer Shang Hang stayed in the array formation, the more alarmed he got.

This spatial inheritance grand array seemed to be tailor-made for him.

Ye Yuan did not put his spatial law into the grand array, but he formulated a whole set of training methods!

This kind of training method could let him comprehend spatial law faster and more thoroughly.

In other words, he was teaching you how to grasp spatial law, and not teaching you what was spatial law.

Shang Hang felt alarmed, what kind of height was he standing at, to be able to set up such a heaven-defying array formation?

Heavenly Emperor Wenshui’s horizons were extremely far. He also saw through the inklings very quickly.

His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan immediately became different.

“Your Excellency really made contributions that will remain eternal for generations to come! I think that some of them already have considerable harvests. Your Excellency’s inheritance grand arrays really broaden people’s horizons! This old man has never seen before that power of laws can actually be passed on like this!” Wenshui exclaimed in shock.

Inheritance grand arrays, to these geniuses, they were tantamount to a good rain after a long drought!

Such an advanced training method opened up a door for them. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Entering for the first time would be when they benefited the most.

The effects could be said to be instantly seen!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Giving a man a fish is not as good as teaching him how to fish. Each person’s path is different. The laws that they comprehended will also be different. Although cultivation methods are good, the achievements are limited. Teaching them the way to cultivate and letting them go and fumble their own Dao, this is the king’s way!”

Wenshui exclaimed, “A terrific giving a man a fish is not as good as teaching him how to fish! Lord Profound Secrets indeed has a sharp eye for discovering able people! With Your Excellency being the chief instructor, overthrowing the divine race is right around the corner!”

Ye Yuan smiled and did not speak.

During these five years’ time, his own gains had also been tremendous.

In the past five years, his spacetime law became increasingly profound.

This was also the reason why those geniuses could not see Ye Yuan’s face clearly.

Even if he did not deliberately mobilize the power of spacetime, it was as if he was situated in spacetime too.

Naturally, he could not be seen clearly.

Being able to set up these 18 grand arrays required him to expend tremendous effort in the first place.

This was similarly a systematic training to Ye Yuan.

The angle at which he stood at, it was even more unimaginable for bystanders.

But after these five years, Ye Yuan faintly had a trace of feeling. It seemed like it was not far away from the time he had to leave.

In the end, Wenshui could not resist too, entering the grand array.

Ye Yuan just watched quietly by the side. He was observing these geniuses.

A month later, many geniuses already could not hold on anymore.

When their gains exceeded their abilities, they would not be able to stay in the grand array anymore.

They needed time to digest these improvements.

The earlier one came out, the worse their talent.

The later one came out, the better the talent.

Among these people, it was indeed still Shang Hang who was the last to come out.

The power of law that he comprehended was the hardest, but he was the one who lasted the longest.

It was also no wonder that he could become Grand Ancestor Spacetime in the future.

“Your Excellency, I was wrong!”

After Shang Hang came out of the formation, the first thing he did was not to get excited but to come before Ye Yuan with a look of shame and admit his fault respectfully.

He cultivated for a full half a year’s time in this grand array.

This half a year’s time, his spatial law advanced by leaps and bounds, it was almost comparable to his ten thousand years of effort in the past.

Concerning the power of this grand array, there was already no need for him to say anymore.

He also deeply understood how valuable these grand arrays that Ye Yuan spent five years to build were!

Perhaps the rise of the human race depended on these 18 grand arrays!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Why are you wrong?”

Shang Hang said in shame, “Your Excellency is a celestial being. This disciple shouldn’t have blamed Your Excellency wrongly!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “There’s nothing wrong with your desire to become strong. Previously I was just cracking a joke with you. You and I still have fate in the future. This destined meeting shall span spacetime.”

Shang Hang discerned Ye Yuan’s overtones and said in surprise, “Isn’t Your Excellency leading us to resist the divine race together? With Your Excellency around, the world will be ours in the future!”

He examined his own conscience and felt that his talent was extremely high. But in front of Ye Yuan, what did he count as?

Ye Yuan was the human race’s true future!

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “I also want to fight side-by-side with you all. But it’s just a pity that ... some things can’t be helped! But you rest assured, some things can’t be avoided. No matter where I am, I’ll fight with the divine race to the end!”

The group of geniuses felt baffled as they listened. These words seemed to have the intention of beating a retreat.

Could it be that this chief instructor was scared?

They simply could not understand what Spacetime Reversal Chaos was.

Because even Ye Yuan himself was unable to understand it.
