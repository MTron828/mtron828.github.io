Chapter 2780: Burning the Bridge After Crossing It!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Skyfortune, you’re wrong! The strongest one here isn’t our Seven-star Heavenly Sect, but the Myriad Demons Mountain! Saint Exalt Bull Demon, these fortunes, your Myriad Demons Mountain can take 50% of it! How’s that?” Saint Exalt Waycloud looked toward Saint Exalt Bull Demon and said with a smile.

There were no fools present.

Saint Exalt Waycloud was using 50% of the wealth to buy over the Myriad Demons Mountain!

The strength of the humans was indeed not considered strong, but they were all veteran Saint Sovereign Heavens.

Meanwhile, the vast majority of the Myriad Demons Mountain’s Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses had just broken through not long ago.

If war really broke out, both sides would inevitably suffer heavy casualties.

Both sides had a score about this in their hearts.

And in the wake of Ye Yuan’s road of martial arts being cut off, the disagreements between Saint Exalt Waycloud and co., and the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, became greater and greater.

Clearly, Waycloud these people did not intend to give ascenders a way out.

As for these fortunes, they probably had no plans of giving it to the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect too.

“This ...” Saint Exalt Bull Demon looked at Ye Yuan and could not help revealing a hesitant look.

Got to admit, 50% of the wealth was very tempting!

The wealth that Li Changsheng accumulated over ten thousand years was sufficient to move any Saint Sovereign Heaven.

When Big Yellow saw Saint Exalt Bull Demon hesitate, he could not resist saying, “Lord Bull Demon! Without Master Ye, could our Myriad Demons Mountain have today’s glory? Without Master Ye, could we have resisted the Eight Legions War Generals’ self-detonation? Could it be that at this time, you want to go back on your word and forget your benefactor?”

The moment Saint Exalt Bull Demon heard, he became even more hesitant.

But Waycloud smiled and said, “Fellow Daoist Big Yellow, your words are wrong! Master Ye helped you all refine heavenly pills and created dozens of saint exalts. He harbored selfish motives to begin with! He only wanted to borrow your strength to take revenge on Li Changsheng. Now, the great enmity has been avenged. You guys owe each other nothing. How can it be going back on your word and forgetting your benefactor?”

By the side, Luo Yunqing exploded with anger and berated angrily, “Waycloud, you villain who kicks someone to the curb after they’ve outlived their usefulness! If not for Ye Yuan blocking the Eight Legions War Generals’ self-detonation for us, would it still be your turn to spout a stream of empty rhetoric here? Also, have you forgotten who brought you out of the Labyrinth Divine Palace?!”

The events in the Labyrinth Divine Palace was no secret. Luo Yunqing also heard about it afterward.

But Waycloud did not agree and said, “Everyone was just making use of each other; that’s all. Didn’t he save this exalt in order to borrow this exalt’s strength? Now, his road of martial arts has already been cut off. Distributing this wealth has no use too. So, there’s naturally no need to distribute it either. What do you think, Fellow Daoist Bull Demon?”

In the end, Waycloud still threw the problem to Bull Demon.

This was because his decision was pivotal.

Waycloud also perceived that among the Myriad Demons Mountain’s 38 Saint Exalt powerhouses, there were many who were moved by the wealth.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon was naturally moved too. It was just that it was hard for him to open his mouth owing to Ye Yuan’s face.

In reality, when he was hesitating, it already showed that he had forsaken Ye Yuan.

Someone whose road of martial arts had been severed, the person no longer had any value to exploit.

“Lord Bull Demon!” Big Yellow shouted angrily.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon gave Ye Yuan a glance and discovered that Ye Yuan had an indifferent face.

It was as if he was an uninvolved person with regards to the present situation.

Ye Yuan did not say anything from start to end.

Very clearly, he himself had also given up on himself.

Those present were all Rainclear Continent’s overlord figures. They had seen before God knows how many geniuses.

Ye Yuan this kind of peerless heaven’s chosen was enough to sweep across the contemporary era.

But the road of martial arts being severed would undoubtedly give him a heavy blow.

He was also clear that if Ye Yuan’s road of martial arts was not severed, Waycloud naturally would not dare to make trouble.

In the end, it was still strength!

These few years, under Ye Yuan’s help, Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds. This allowed him to see a greater future!

Perhaps, he could also reach True Sovereign Heaven one day in the future?

Being in possession of so much wealth, he might have some hope!

Saint Exalt Bull Demon nodded and said, “I agree! However, our Myriad Demons Mountain wants 60%!”

The moment these words came out, the faces of the Five Great Heavenly Regions’ Saint Sovereign Heavens changed one after another.

This 60% represented countless wealth!

Waycloud also gritted his teeth and said with a nod, “Okay! 60% it is! The remaining 40%, our Seven-star Heavenly Sect wants 15%, the rest, your various sects divide equally! Do you all have objections?”

When he said this, Waycloud naturally filtered out Ye Yuan and the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect too.

The various sects that he was talking about naturally did not include the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

Saint Exalt Skyfortune thought about it and shook his head and said, “I don’t have objections!”

Saint Exalt Purplesun said, “I have no objections too!”

But when Waycloud saw the situation, he looked toward Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Ye Yuan, we’ve discussed your view! Ascenders are ascenders. What right do foreigners have to gain a foothold in the Five Great Heavenly Regions? However, we’re not unreasonable people either. You’ve rendered great contributions to destroying the Pill Alliance. So, you all, these ascenders, withdraw to the Land of Heavenly South. We won’t make things difficult for you all.”

Waycloud these people clearly came prepared.

They were going to drive all of the ascenders to the Land of Heavenly South.

The Land of Heavenly South’s Saint Sovereign Heavens and Luo Yunqing, these people, all broke through not long ago. Their strength was too lousy.

If they were really unwilling, once a battle broke out, it was likely that Ye Yuan would not be able to protect them at all with his remaining strength.

Therefore, they ascertained that Ye Yuan only had this path, that was to agree.

Furthermore, they did not plan on sharing this enormous wealth with Ye Yuan’s side.

“You all are bullying people too far! Do you really think that we’re scared of you?”

Luo Yunqing could not hold back anymore, and his long sword immediately unsheathed!

Waycloud had a disdainful look and directly smacked a palm over.

At the same time, Big Yellow also gave no chance to explain and kicked a hoof towards Saint Exalt Waycloud.

Bang!

Waycloud only felt a tremendous force transmit over, directly being kicked flying by Big Yellow.

He was not Big Yellow’s match alone.

The present Big Yellow needed at least three to five people joining hands before he could be dealt with.

Big Yellow looked at Waycloud coldly and said in a solemn voice, “All of you ungrateful villains that forget kindness! Do you really think that this exalt is to be trifled with? Today, even if I fight it out till the bitter end, this exalt will also take care of you all!”

In the next moment, Big Yellow erupted with a powerful pressure, making the faces of everyone present change one after another.

Big Yellow’s strength was known to the people present.

Even Saint Exalt Bull Demon was also not his match currently.

If he was to really go nuts, dragging several Saint Sovereign Heavens down was all too normal.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly stepped forward, patted Big Yellow on the shoulder, and said with a smile, “Alright. Big Yellow, let’s go! This wealth is merely worldly possessions. They are useless. Remember, strength is the king’s way!”

Big Yellow’s expression changed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Master Ye, what ... do you mean by this?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Give these things to them. In the future, when they beg to deliver it in front of me, I’ll still have to consider it! There’s also no problem with them making us withdraw out of the Five Great Heavenly Regions. Let’s return to Heavenly South!”

“What?!” Big Yellow and Luo Yunqing said in unison, both surprised to the extreme.

Even Saint Exalt Waycloud and Saint Exalt Bull Demon they all had disbelieving faces too.

Ye Yuan actually really agreed!
