Chapter 1537 Will Grant All Requests

Deyi Hall was the south city’s largest medicinal hall. Wu Feng was the number one person here.

As the south city’s number one medicinal hall, Deyi Hall naturally had unceasing traffic, their business very popular.

“What did you say?! Zhu Yongtian didn’t die?”

Wu Feng looked at the manager opposite, shock filling his eyes.

The manager nodded and said, “Not only did he not die, but he’s also already full of vitality and vigor! He was seen going to a branch hall this morning, talking in a jovial manner. It was like he wasn’t seriously injured on the verge of death at all!”

Wu Feng’s gaze turned intent and he shook his head and said, “Impossible! I personally diagnosed his pulse! His heart meridians were already fully severed, even immortals would be hard-pressed to save him. It’s just three days’ time, so how can he possibly be robust and lively already?”

The manager smiled bitterly and said, “I’ve already sent people to inquire about it. Zhu Yongtian is really already well. Furthermore, the Crimson Fire Bone Corroding Poison in his body is already fully removed.”

Wu Feng’s expression changed, his brows furrowing tightly until creases could be seen and he said in a solemn voice, “Is it possible? Was he really brought back to life by that brat? A brat who’s still wet behind the ears, how can he possibly have such capability?”

The manager was puzzled as he said, “Brother Wu Feng, the kid that you’re talking about is?”

Wu Feng froze, shook his head, and said, “Nothing! Starting from today, Deyi Hall as well as all of the Dongfang Family’s medicinal halls will discontinue all cooperation with the Dragon Slaying Gang, banning the sale of medicinal pills to them! Humph! Since they look down on this old man, then they will have to suffer this old man’s wrath!”

The manager’s expression changed and he said with difficulty, “Brother Wu Feng, this ... the Dragon Slaying Gang is our major client, this isn’t too good, right?”

Wu Feng snorted coldly and said, “Why? Don’t I even have this bit of authority?”

The manager smiled bitterly and said, “Brother Wu Feng is too serious, you naturally have this authority. Alright then, it will be as Brother Wu Feng said!”

Wu Feng’s status in the Dongfang Family was too high. Even though he was Deyi Hall’s manager, he could not offend this great deity.

It was just that he was very curious, who could make the Wu Feng who had always been proud of his success take up arms and go to war?

...

“What did you say? Zhu Yongtian actually didn’t die? How is this possible? My Thunder Chasing Arrow has never failed before!”

When the Sun Moon Gang’s second head, He Xiao, heard this news, his first reaction was to not believe it.

Thunder Chasing Arrow, the momentum was akin to chasing thunder; none could withstand its onslaught!

Although He Xiao was just a grand completion Origin Deity, by relying on the Thunder Chasing Arrow, shooting a half-step Divine Lord dead was nothing difficult.

As long as he was given an adequate opportunity!

The Silverfeather Gang spent a huge price before inviting He Xiao to take action but did not expect for it to fall short of success at the last stage.

Xing Guan was not shot dead. Now, even the Zhu Yongtian who helped him block the arrow actually survived too. How could this not shock him?

“Heh, Zhu Yongtian has already appeared in public, it can’t be faked. Furthermore, there’s an even more explosive news, the Dragon Slaying Gang ... changed names to Thunderclap Gang!” the Silverfeather Gang’s chief head, Luo Yu, said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He Xiao’s expression changed, showing a look of surprise on his face.

What the hell was this Dragon Slaying Gang up to?

“You came to find me today to take about this? I’ve already taken action. Zhu Yongtian not dying, the responsibility of this matter isn’t on me! Could it be that your Silverfeather Gang wants to go back on your word?” After the initial shock, He Xiao recovered the demeanor of a fierce and ambitious person.

Luo Yu smiled and said, “Rest assured, Qianting Three Streets, there’s one for you guys! I came today to find you to discuss cooperation. Once the chief head breaks through to Divine Lord Realm, he can’t interfere with the south city’s matters anymore. Before this, our two gangs should still cooperate sincerely and wipe out the Thunderclap Gang first. What do you think, future chief head?”

Among the three gangs, the Sun Moon Gang’s strength was the greatest.

The Sun Moon Gang’s chief head’s strength was already infinitely close to the Divine Lord Realm and might break through at any time.

These few years, he had always been in the state of closed-seclusion.

And He Xiao’s strength was also virtually on par with half-step Divine Lord.

According to the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s rules, Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were not to intervene in the outer cities’ affairs.

When the time came, He Xiao would be the Sun Moon Gang’s chief head.

He Xiao gave Luo Yu a very meaningful glance and said, “Are you ... making a show of goodwill to our Sun Moon Gang?”

Luo Yu smiled and said, “Fine birds choose the tree to perch on! Our three major gangs have fought in the open and in the dark these few years. But in the eyes of the three great families, we’re merely a bunch of motley crew. Now, we finally produced a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, this also makes us have the feeling of leaning against a big tree!”

When he said this, Luo Yu felt many vicissitudes of emotion too.

The three major gangs’ power being inferior to the three great families was because they did not have a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse as a backer.

The three great chiefs were all competing to see who could break through to Divine Lord Realm first these few years.

Looking at it now, it was naturally the Sun Moon Gang’s chief who was a notch higher.

Even though Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were not to directly intervene in the outer cities’ matters, manipulating in secret was definitely there.

Otherwise, on what basis could the three great families suppress them?

When He Xiao heard this, he could not help saying with a smile: “It’s still Chief Head Luo who recognizes the facts of the situation, unlike that Xing Guan who’s impervious to all reason. But, Xing Guan’s strength is indeed very formidable; not easy to deal with!”

Luo Yu smiled and said, “In the past, he isn’t easy to deal with. But now ... no idea why, Xing Guan offended Master Wu Feng. Now, Deyi Hall and Dongfang Family’s businesses have already utterly boycotted the Thunderclap Gang. Without the Dongfang Family’s protection, could he, Xing Guan, still overturn the heavens?”

He Xiao’s brows raised up and he said, “Is this real?”

Luo Yu smiled and said, “More real than real gold!”

The two people looked at each other and smiled.

...

On Cinnamon Street, a handsome looking youth brought along a young book attendant, and they were currently wandering on the streets[1].

“Mis – Young Master, it’s getting late, we should go back,” the book attendant said.

That youth had refined features and bright eyes, the skin color fair. One look and it was a woman cross-dressed as a man.

But even if it was cross-dressing and not applying makeup, it could not block her beauty too.

The youth glared and scolded, “Little Huan, is your skin itching again? We’re running away from home here! Running away from home, understand? Go back? Go back for what? Walk right into a trap?”

Little Huan pursed her lips and did not dare to say a word more.

Suddenly, the youth raised her head and saw ‘Will Grant All Requests’, four big words, written on a small medicine shop, and could not help revealing a look of disdain.

“Heh, such a small medicine shop probably doesn’t even have a Three-star alchemy god. To actually dare claim to grant all requests. This young la ... young master wants to see how you grant all requests!”

While talking, the youth raised her feet and went straight into the medicine shop.

“Shopkeeper, your front door writes ‘Will Grant All Requests’, can you refine all medicinal pills?” the youth directly opened her mouth and asked.

The shopkeeper hurriedly came out to greet and appeared slightly embarrassed as he said, “This ... should be ... can?”

The shopkeeper seriously could not carry on talking. Yesterday, the chief head brought a young man over, saying that this medicine shop was up to him to take charge.

In the end, the first thing that this young man did was to hang a ‘Will Grant All Requests’ plaque at the entrance.

His sweat poured profusely back then. The tone was a little too big, right?

Even though this young man was an initial-stage Origin Deity, he was too young, too boastful.

You look, this plaque had not been hung for long and someone came over to find fault, right?

“Can? You’re the shopkeeper, you’re asking me? Heh, you all really have such high-sounding sentiments, is this to offend all of your peers?” the youth said with a cold smile.

[1] Book attendants were basically young servant boys who were also study partners to their young masters.
