1582 Blocking the Door and Provoking

“Elder Ye! Protector Lin!”

“Paying respects to Elder Ye! Paying respects to Protector Lin!”

Upon entering the inner city, there were quite a number of people who took the initiative to come up and greet Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan discerned dissatisfaction and disdain from their eyes.

Their greetings always brought Protector Lin up in passing.

Clearly, in their eyes, Lin Dong was even more not to be offended than Ye Yuan this elder.

A mere Three-star Alchemy God, if a wall in the inner city fell and crushed over ten people, there would be three or four Three-star Alchemy Gods among them.

The rest were all Origin Deity Realm martial artists.

Hence, this incomprehensible designation made these people very unwilling to submit to this situation.

The moment Ye Yuan took office, he brought Lin Dong to immediately go and take revenge. Many people had never even seen before this newly-appointed Pill Tower elder.

But they recognized by the fact that Lin Dong had someone beside him, so this ridiculously young fellow must be Ye Yuan.

“Elder Ye, this ...” But Lin Dong by the side was uneasy and said awkwardly.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a faint smile, “Protector Lin doesn’t have to nervous. This kind of situation, I’ve long expected it. How can I vent it on you? The best way to make other people shut up is to use strength to conquer him. Rage, this kind of emotion, will only make others look down on you and can’t make others regard you highly.”

Lin Dong opened his mouth wide, not expecting that Ye Yuan would say such words.

Was this Elder Ye really only a hundred over years old?

Why did he sound so lacking in youthful vigor when speaking? Instead, he was seemingly extremely insightful?

Logically speaking, for Ye Yuan to have such a high status and such means at a young age, he should more or less be somewhat arrogant and flippant.

But he completely could not see this kind of emotion from Ye Yuan.

What he could see, there were only maturity and prudence, holding the pearl of wisdom in his hands.

The group of people walked slowly and arrived at Ye Yuan’s manor in the inner city very quickly.

Suddenly, a large group of people poured out of both sides of the street, blocking the front door tightly.

But among these people, there wasn’t even a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse. They were actually all Origin Deity Realm youths.

Their age were generally the same as Ning Siyu.

Lin Dong’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “Song Qiyang, do you all want to rebel?”

The one in the lead was young and handsome, his strength already half-step Divine Lord.

But Song Qiyang was indifferent and said coolly, “Protector Lin, we know where your duties lie. But, if this person is going to become a Pill Tower elder, I, Song Qiyang, am the first to be unconvinced! Juniors, are you all convinced?”

“Unconvinced!”

“We’re unconvinced!”

“If a Three-star Alchemy God can be an elder, wouldn’t our Pill Tower become a joke?”

“Yeah, I’m a Three-star Alchemy God too, then can I be an elder as well?”

...

The group of people chirped, emotions running high. There were some among them who were agitated until their face reddened to the ears, clearly unconvinced about Ye Yuan to the max.

Legends were legends after all. The inner city, apart from Xuan Yu master and disciples few people, no one had seen Ye Yuan take action before at all.

Hence, to make these Three-star Alchemy Gods believe how formidable Ye Yuan was, it was exceedingly difficult.

The position of an elder was what only some late-stage Divine Lord big shots could take on.

A Three-star Alchemy God brat, on what basis?

Lin Dong was angered until he gnashed his teeth. This bunch of guys was too blatant and brazen, to actually dare come and call an elder into question!

This kind of thing had never happened before in the history of the Pill Tower.

There were no less than a hundred people present. They were all the Pill Tower’s young generation’s most elite geniuses.

There were quite a few people who were even the disciples of the Pill Tower’s elders and deacons.

This Song Qiyang was Head Elder’s personal disciple, and he was also the number one person among the Pill Tower’s Three-star disciples.

His strength could virtually be said to sweep across all those in the same rank.

Rank three divine pills that many others did not even dare to think about, he could refine successfully.

Even Head Elder himself also frequently praised that Song Qiyang was more than a hundred times stronger than when he was young!

Toward this disciple, he was rather satisfied.

Head Elder’s doting also gave rise to Song Qiyang’s condescending personality.

How could ordinary people be able to enter his sight?

Now, he heard that a Three-star Alchemy God actually became a Pill Tower elder. How could he, this fellow who was arrogant at heart and haughty in manner, endure this kind of thing happening?

Of course, Song Qiyang was not a fool either. He knew that rashly offending an elder was a serious crime.

The die was already cast, so he was not allowed to be unbridled.

Hence, he pulled in a large number of rank three disciples and came to block Ye Yuan’s door.

As the saying went, the law did not punish the masses. These disciples who came today, their backers were all rather tough.

Presumably, Ye Yuan did not dare to do anything to them.

“Are you all done making a din?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Song Qiyang sneered and said, “Elder Ye, if you want to become an elder, you have to take out the ability to convince us! Today, I, Song Qiyang, represent rank three disciples to challenge you! Do you dare to accept the challenge or not?”

Song Qiyang was valiant, an appearance of fearing nothing and no one.

The moment these words were said, even Lin Dong’s eyes revealed a hint of interest.

Honestly speaking, the higher-ups sent him to become Ye Yuan’s follower. But he really did not know how powerful Ye Yuan was.

Meanwhile, Song Qiyang was undoubtedly a benchmark figure among Three-star Alchemy Gods.

Using him to set the standard was clearly the best fit. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

With this in mind, Lin Dong immediately realized that today’s matter was probably not that simple.

Ye Yuan as an elder, defeating Song Qiyang was also nothing much.

But if he lost, that was losing all standing and reputation. Even Second Elder would be implicated.

This matter definitely had someone pulling the strings behind it!

He could not help looking at Ye Yuan, wanting to see how he would deal with it.

Who knew that at this time, Ye Yuan just happened to look over toward him and said coolly, “Protector Lin, throw them all out for me. Don’t let them block my path here.”

The moment these words came out, all of the rank three disciples’ faces changed.

Song Qiyang sneered even harder and said, “It turns out that the newly-appointed Elder Ye is merely a pillow with an embroidered case and don’t even dare to accept the challenge of a rank three disciple! This matter, I’ll definitely report it to the Pill Tower and say that the newly-appointed Elder Ye is completely unworthy of his title! Don’t you all say so, juniors?”

The way the other disciples saw it, Ye Yuan’s way of avoiding was clearly already being afraid of getting found out.

“Yeah, a Three-star Alchemy God, what right does he have to become a Pill Tower elder?”

“Don’t even dare to accept the challenge of us disciples, he has a guilty conscience!”

“This guy is simply a liar, to actually even become an elder in a grand manner. The Pill Tower must severely punish him.”

...

Song Qiyang was pleased with himself inwardly. He reached a conclusion after weighing it and felt that he already probed Ye Yuan’s actual ability.

This guy must be afraid of getting found out!

It looked like Deacon Deercry’s analysis was very reasonable. This Ye Yuan was merely a person who Second Elder brought out to divert attention!

“Protector Lin, what are you still waiting for? Could it be that ... you want me to personally take action?” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

Lin Dong’s expression was somewhat conflicted. After all, this guy was Head Elder’s disciple!

Seeing that Lin Dong did not dare to make a move, Song Qiyang was even more smug as he said, “My Elder Ye, do you dare to go to the Elders Association with me to confront each other? Your strength completely isn’t fit for this position as an elder!”

Swoosh!

Song Qiyang was being pleased with himself, but then he saw a blur before his eyes, and he was thrown straight out.
