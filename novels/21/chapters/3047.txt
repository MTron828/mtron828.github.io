Chapter 3046: Grade Eight Comprehending Origin!

“Master Ye, what are you still dawdling for? Hurry up and show your skills. Let rookies like us broaden our knowledge!” Zhou Xianchen said with a cold smile.

“Master Ye can even refine the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill with ease. We really feel ashamed of our unworthiness! Hurry up and show your abilities. Let us take a look!”

“We really didn’t expect that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven actually produced a genius such as yourself!”

Those watching the show did not mind if matters blew up. Chu Fang and Jinnan also kicked up a fuss.

Either way, the one betting with Ye Yuan was Zhou Xianchen. Even if Ye Yuan really won, they would not suffer any losses either.

Of course, they did not think that Ye Yuan could beat Zhou Xianchen.

In alchemy, they were not convinced by anyone but Zhou Xianchen.

The various forces were all waiting to see the joke.

Ye Yuan’s palm moved, nirvanic rebirth fire leaping up, directly enveloping the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill’s heavenly medicines.

Ever since Ye Yuan fused the four great true spirit bloodlines, the power of this nirvanic rebirth fire also rose several levels.

...

Refining heavenly pills became even more accomplished with high proficiency.

However, this move garnered waves of ridicule in the eyes of Zhou Xianchen and the others.

“I was wondering how impressive Master Ye was. After messing around for half a day, you’re only refining an Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill. This kind of heavenly pill, I could refine 30 at the same time when I was Emperor Vast Heaven! If it’s now, refining 300 at the same time is a cinch to me!” Zhou Xianchen could not help laughing as he said.

Chu Fang laughed and said, “Brother Zhou is skilled! This Chu can only refine around 230 pills currently.”

Jinnan nodded and said, “Being able to refine 300, Brother Zhou’s strength is indeed formidable!”

The more heavenly pills that you refined at the same time, naturally the higher the requirements on the heavenly alchemist.

Regarding the control of fire and the amalgamation of heavenly medicines, all required a huge expenditure of energy.

To some extent, the greater the number when refining at the same time, naturally, the stronger the heavenly alchemist’s strength.

The refining difficulty of the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill naturally could not compare to the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill.

Like when Zhou Xianchen, this kind of expert, was refining, it was normally refining many at the same time.

Who knew that Ye Yuan was just refining one at a time. Hence, it ended up as a laughingstock.

But very soon, they could not laugh anymore.

This was because Ye Yuan was really very strong!

When experts made their move, the genuine and the fake would become clear at a glance.

Zhou Xianchen and a few others could be said to be grandmasters in alchemy. They could naturally tell with one glance whether or not Ye Yuan had skills.

“Origin grade realm! This boy actually entered origin grade realm too!” Jinnan cried out in surprise.

In their view, if someone that came out of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven could enter profound grade at this cultivation realm, it was already very good.

They did not expect that Ye Yuan actually entered origin grade!

The talents of Zhou Xianchen and the rest were even stronger than Ye Yuan’s senior apprentice brother, Zhou Pinespring.

Zhou Pinespring only stepped into origin grade after Emperor Sakra Heaven too.

But Zhou Xianchen entered origin grade when he was upper Emperor Vast Heaven.

Meanwhile, Jinnan two people were a level worse, only entering origin grade at grand completion Emperor Vast Heaven.

However, this was already very strong.

The vast majority of heavenly alchemists were stuck in profound grade and were unable to break through.

But who could that thought that Ye Yuan, this rookie who came from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, actually entered origin grade at lower Emperor Vast Heaven Realm?

Didn’t this mean that Ye Yuan’s talent was even greater than theirs?

Zhou Xianchen smiled coldly and said, “I was wondering why this punk was so cocky. It turns out that he entered origin grade! But so what if he entered origin grade? This young master has already pried into the origin of Alchemy Dao!”

He could overpower Chu Fang and Jinnan because he comprehended origin!

This was also what he was proudest of.

He was just lower Emperor Sakra Heaven but already comprehended origin.

In the future, when he reached grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven, it would be much easier to step into the realm of Hegemon.

The path of cultivation, ahead by a step, it meant being ahead at every step. This was not said for fun.

But, as if getting slapped, a surge of origin power was released from Ye Yuan’s body, integrating into the nirvanic rebirth fire.

Alchemy Dao origin!

Actually, Ye Yuan had already understood Alchemy Dao origin when searching for the way out for those bloodline warriors in the Dragon Clan.

There were a million origin seeds in Ye Yuan’s body; cultivating yielded twice the results with half the effort.

No matter how he cultivated, Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao was always at the forefront.

Ye Yuan relied on his powerful alchemy path talent and forcibly broke through the limitations of cultivation realm, comprehending Alchemy Dao origin.

But, when this scene appeared before everyone’s eyes, it was seriously too shocking.

Zhou Xianchen’s face burned fiery hot, wishing to swallow the words earlier back into his stomach.

But the bystanders did not care about his regret anymore.

“Grade eight comprehending origin? This ... This is also too fake, right?” Jinnan said with a look of disbelief.

“Alchemy Dao origin, the difficulty of comprehending is no less than spatial origin, these top origins. How can he possibly comprehend Alchemy Dao origin in Emperor Vast Heaven?” Chu Fang said in horror.

The path of alchemy was far too difficult.

Putting aside that the path of alchemy was complicated to the extreme, even during the cultivation journey, the countless resources that one needed were also not what the average person could afford to consume.

The few of them were able to have a strength that far exceeded their peers at this realm because they had powerful backing.

But even so, they were flung far behind by Ye Yuan too.

Zhou Xianchen was still fine, but Jinnan and Chu Fang were far too lacking.

Even Kong Tan also had a look of shock and said, “Where did this boy pop out from? When did the puny little Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven produce such a monster? Disregarding Yang Qing, a monster that suppressed all the heavens in Alchemy Dao actually appeared too!”

Yu Ran said, “No wonder this kid behaved so arrogantly. It turns out that he really has some ability. But, even if he comprehended origin, it’s very hard to beat Zhou Xianchen too, right?”

Kong Tan nodded and said, “That’s of course! Similarly having comprehended origin, Zhou Xianchen is a grade nine heavenly alchemist after all! Furthermore, there’s even a Great Beyond Realm alchemy path overlord standing behind him. It’s impossible to lose to that kid no matter what.”

Yu Ran said, “Then I’m relieved! If this kid wins, I’ll be angered to death.”

While Yang Qing laughed loudly and said, “This guy is always so trustworthy! Even I also didn’t think that he comprehended origin in Emperor Vast Heaven!”

Time trickled by. Three days passed in a blink of an eye.

Only to hear Ye Yuan yell: “Go!”

A scarlet red heavenly pill flew straight for Yang Qing.

“This is yours!” Ye Yuan said.

“Alright!” Yang Qing caught the heavenly pill and directly swallowed it without another word.

Then he felt a vast power opening up his four limbs and bones.

Behind Yang Qing, the Door of Eternal Life appeared on its own accord!

The power of this medicinal pill directly called forth the Door of Eternal Life!

Yang Qing was shocked!

“My God, the power of this heavenly pill is also a little too terrifying, right?” Yang Qing could not resist complaining.

He felt that this heavenly pill seemed to be very different from the heavenly pills that Ye Yuan refined in the past.

But, in what way was it different, he could not pinpoint it too.

All in all, it was ridiculously strong!

Only to see Yang Qing brandish his long spear, his figure fusing into one with the spear body, turning into a rainbow as he rushed toward the second seal. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In fact, he did not even make preparations.

Boom!

The second seal opened in response!
