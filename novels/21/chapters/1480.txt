Chapter 1484 Dragon Soul Awakens Again

Ka Xin’s expression was grim until it was almost dripping water.

The others were all silent like cicadas in winter. Disregarding Ye Yuan killing Starshine three people, he still wanted to come before Ka Xin to slap his face. This way of doing things seriously made people palpitate with anxiety and fear.

“Take it, this is what you deserve!”

These few words, Ka Xin practically squeezed it out of the crevices between his teeth.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, taking the eight treasures all into his possession.

“If there’s this kind of good thing next time, Your Highness Ka Xin mustn’t forget Source Night.” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

Ka Xin’s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a cold light as he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Relax, definitely won’t forget you!”

Li Ji discovered that the atmosphere was somewhat stiff. He stood up and said with an awkward smile, “Many thanks for Your Highness Ka Xin generous hospitality. We’ll be leaving first.”

A get-together dispersed with ill feelings.

But Ye Yuan did not care. He returned fully loaded.

These eight treasures indeed had quite a number of good stuff.

After everyone left, Lian Hua smiled at Ka Xin and said, “Within this Capone Capital City, it’s been very long since anyone could make you suffer such a huge loss. Hehe ... this Source Night is really interesting.”

Ka Xin said with a solemn face, “For provoking me, he’s dead! Immediately go to the Blood Yama Hall to issue a mission. Post a reward of 30 million low-grade fiend essence stones. I want his head!”

Lian Hua smiled and said, “You really think highly of him. Killing an ordinary middle-level Two-star fiend general only needs three million, but you added a full ten-fold; much more expensive than even a grand completion Two-star Fiend General’s price!”

“Humph! Is he an ordinary middle-level Two-star Fiend General?” Ka Xin said with a cold snort.

...

Returning to the Fan Family, Ye Yuan entered a closed-seclusion state once more, and he startedto take Blackjade Profound Spirit Ointment.

Ye Yuan’s Nine Transformations Golden Body was already stuck at the first transformation for very long and kept failing to break through.

About body-refinement’s breakthrough, the requirement towards resources was more stringent. Ordinary spirit medicines could not have an effect at all.

Nine Transformations Golden Body, each transformation was more difficult than the last.

From the first transformation to the second transformation, the difficulty was many times harder than breaking through from the Grotto Profound Deity Realm to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm.

Ordinary people were unable to shoulder this kind of terrifying resource consumption at all.

If not for Ye Yuan obtaining a One Transformation Profound Gold Pill previously, even grand completion first transformation was very hard to achieve too.

This Blackjade Profound Spirit Ointment was a body-refinement spirit medicine. Inside mixed in many extremely rare body-refinement materials. It was a priceless treasure.

In order to kill Ye Yuan, Ka Xin also put forth blood capital.

It was just that he did not expect that Ye Yuan overcame all the difficulties along the way. In the end, it was obtained by Ye Yuan himself.

Ye Yuan applied the Blackjade Profound Spirit Ointment evenly on his body and started revolving his skill to absorb the medicinal strength.

Very soon, a strong burning sensation came from Ye Yuan’s body.

Along with the passing of time, the burning sensation became stronger and stronger.

Each breakthrough of body-refinement was an extremely tortuous process.

A single mishap and one would even fall into a situation of eternal damnation.

Back then, when Ye Yuan forcefully consumed the Tiger Dragon Creation Pill, that feeling of wishing he was dead was still vivid in his mind to this date.

Now, this kind of pain paled in comparison to that time. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Half a month later, after Ye Yuan withstood the ravaging of wave after wave of ecstasy, he finally broke through to the Nine Transformations Golden Body’s second transformation!

Ye Yuan’s body left behind a pile of fetid order black-colored sludge. That was the impurities extracted from his body after he completed the second transformation.

At this time, Ye Yuan’s body emitted rays of golden light. Compared to the first transformation, it was much brighter.

“Finally broke through! Ever since cultivating to Deity Realm, the progress of body-refinement became slower and slower. Now, it’s already completely thrown to the back by divine essence realm!” Ye Yuan lamented.

“The Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art you cultivate is already gradually getting into conflict with the bloodline power within your body! This cultivation method has excessive defense and lacking offense; violating the dragon race’s tyrannical bloodline power Heavenly Dao. The guy who imparted to you the cultivation method is simply a fool!” Dustless said unhappily.

“Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!”

In the Immortal Grove World, Skydistant sneezed three times in a row and said in puzzlement, “Could there be someone talking bad about me behind my back? Why did I sneeze so hard?”

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “But apart from this cultivation method, I don’t know other body-refinement cultivation methods either!”

It was undeniable, the Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art helped Ye Yuan a lot in the past.

If not for the Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art, he could not even pass through the spatial storm.

But now, this cultivation method was already gradually restricting his cultivation.

The cultivation method did not lie in power, but compatibility with oneself.

This was also the reason why Ye Yuan insisted on creating a cultivation method belonging to himself.

Dustless smiled and said, “The dragon race has their own body-refinement cultivation method. You broke through to the second transformation golden body. Presumably, you should be able to learn it!”

Ye Yuan froze. Suddenly, his head buzzed, and his consciousness was dragged into another space.

“Roar!”

An earth-shaking dragon roar sounded out. An azure dragon phantom circled non-stop around Ye Yuan.

Finally, it submerged into Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness.

When Ye Yuan opened his eyes once more, he realized plenty of new information appeared in his mind, making his face reveal a look of wild ecstasy.

“Waited so long, finally awakened for the second time! Hahaha! Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art’s second level, Voice of the Dragon God’s second level, Universe Dragon Claw, Heavenly Dragon Dharma Body! With the second awakening, I really obtained quite a few good stuff!” Ye Yuan said excitedly.

This second awakening, Ye Yuan grasped four powerful dragon race cultivation methods all at once.

Not commenting about the Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art, after breaking through to the second level, his recovery ability would go up another level.

The Voice of the Dragon God was already Ye Yuan’s sound-wave martial technique that he had not seen for ages. The first level was already of somewhat little value to the current Ye Yuan.

With the second level, as long as Ye Yuan utilised the power of the fleshy body, it would be a major killing tool again.

The Universe Dragon Claw was the second of the dragon race’s three great paramount martial techniques!

Its power was not at all inferior compared to the Voice of the Dragon God.

But what made Ye Yuan the most excited was none other than the Heavenly Dragon Dharma Body, this cultivation method.

Previously, he was still saying that he did not have the dragon race’s body-refinement cultivation method. Now, it came!

Looks like Dustless had long expected it. That was why he would say those words.

Ye Yuan employing the Voice of the Dragon God and Universe Dragon Claw with the Heavenly Dragon Dharma Body, the powerful would be a magnitude greater!

“Heh, the dragon race is also a supreme existence among the Heavenspan World’s demon race! As long as you continuously awaken, it will make you benefit to no end!” Dustless said with a light laugh.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said, “Senior, just what origin is this dragon race’s progenitor? What kind of realm was he?”

Immortal Grove World’s dragon race progenitor’s realm determined the height that Ye Yuan’s Atavism Dragon Soul could reach. Ye Yuan was naturally very concerned.

Dustless said, “Ao Qin that punk was True God Realm! As long as you keep on awakening, reaching the sixth transformation golden body by relying on the power of the fleshy body is no issue!”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted when he heard that. He knew that the dragon race’s progenitor might be very strong, but he did not think that he was powerful to such a degree!

True God Realm, that was an existence that the vast majority of the Heavenspan World’s powerhouses all needed to look up too.

“Senior, where did the Four Symbols Family Clans’ progenitors go?” Ye Yuan said curiously.
