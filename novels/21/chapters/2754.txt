Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Endless World in the depths of the Endless Forest.

Yue Mengli hugged the weak Ye Yuan with a look of tender care.

“Big Brother Yuan, are … are you alright?”

“Fool, can he be okay? He didn’t even want his life anymore in order to save you!” Mi Tian said in a great rage.

Yue Mengli was taken aback and said in surprise, “You … Who are you?”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s origin divinity came out of his body and said to Yue Mengli, “He’s a senior who’s temporarily staying in my body. Li-er, I still have even more important things to do right now. Senior will tell you everything.”

Yue Mengli’s expression turned intent, and she nodded slightly and said,?“Mn,?go on, Big Brother Yuan.”

Mi Tian was even more furious when he saw the situation and scolded, “You stinking brat, really angering Your Father to death! I’ve never seen before someone who messes around like you! Already crippled yourself and you actually still want to use origin divinity to go fight! You’ll die!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s also because there’s no choice. If I don’t go and fight, he’ll definitely destroy the Heavenspan World. Senior, this place will be entrusted to you. I’ll be right back!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan’s chaos origin divinity immediately disappeared from the Endless World.

Mi Tian was stomping his feet in anger, his mouth spewing profanities without stopping for a moment.

Standing from his perspective, there was no way of understanding Ye Yuan’s actions at all.

This girl in front of him was merely a Lower Realms ant.

This guy directly crippled himself from running in order to save her.

To a powerhouse who was about to step into Saint Sovereign Heaven, what kind of woman could he not get?

This boy was really incomprehensible!

Now, he was going in an origin divinity state to find the Yan Jadetrue who might have already broken through to True Sovereign Heaven to risk his life for a world’s ants.

After scolding for a while, Mi Tian also felt helpless and said to Yue Mengli angrily, “Damn lass, bring his physical body and go to the Heavenspan World!”

Yue Mengli said uncertainly, “Senior, what are we going to do?”

Mi Tian said with a cold snort, “What else can we do? To save him! Your Father is still counting him on to send me back home. Will I still harm him? With how he is, after his origin divinity returns, I reckon that he won’t be far from death either! Luckily, the Heavenspan World is connected to the Heaven Fragmented Continent. Otherwise, this brat is dead for sure!”

The moment Yue Mengli heard, she could not help being overjoyed and immediately carried Ye Yuan’s physical body and flew away. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

… …

With Ye Yuan’s origin divinity leaving his body, he returned to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven very quickly!

He had just walked out of the plane passageway when he felt an extremely powerful origin divinity power rushing towards this side.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed. Only then did he know that Yan Jadetrue had just broken through not long ago.

Secretly thinking to himself what a close shave it was, Ye Yuan’s figure moved, and he greeted Yan Jadetrue.

Yan Jadetrue had clearly discovered Ye Yuan too and shouted angrily, “Ye Yuan, you ruined my cultivation base. I’ll definitely make your soul disintegrate today!”

All of a sudden, he saw Ye Yuan’s origin divinity and could not help being taken aback, and immediately laughed loudly and said, “Brat, you actually only left with origin divinity!?Mn??You … Your origin divinity actually broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven already; how is this possible?!”

The loud laughter stopped abruptly. Yan Jadetrue discovered that Ye Yuan’s origin divinity was extremely compact. Furthermore, he already broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!

He was merely only at the level of middle Jade Sovereign Heaven before!

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Could it be that only you’re allowed to scheme against me, and I’m not allowed to plot against you? Before coming out of the Labyrinth Divine Palace, my origin divinity had already been cultivated to Saint Sovereign Heaven! Otherwise, how can I dare to absorb the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation in front of you?”

Yan Jadetrue’s expression changed again and again, and he said in a cold voice, “Ye Yuan, you caused this exalt to fail in my breakthrough. But, even if it’s this half-baked True Sovereign Heaven, it’s sufficient to kill you too!”

He was very careful, but who would have thought that he still got tricked in the end. The fury in his heart could be imagined.

Yan Jadetrue had indeed broken through to True Sovereign Heaven, but the Frivolous Life Like a Dream’s existence had a great impact on his breakthrough.

At this time, his origin divinity was between Saint Sovereign Heaven and True Sovereign Heaven. It neither went up nor down. This drove him incredibly crazy.

“Immortal Exterminating Finger!”

Yan Jadetrue shouted coldly. Pointing a finger out, the wind and clouds changed colors.

The outrageous power of Great Dao combined with a powerful origin divinity attack made this finger sufficient to exterminate immortals!

Ye Yuan’s expression changed slightly. The power of this finger absolutely surpassed the level of Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Even if a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven was here, they would probably be annihilated by a finger too.

Although Yan Jadetrue’s physical body was destroyed, his cultivation base was still there, and he could still borrow heaven and earth spiritual energy to execute powerful martial techniques.

He broke through to True Sovereign Heaven and comprehended the Great Dao rule of True Sovereign Heaven, his power immense.

At this very moment, although Ye Yuan was startled, he did not panic.

Divine Emergence was where Ye Yuan’s confidence lay!

In an instant, Ye Yuan condensed a bow with soul force.

Bending the bow and notching the arrow!

The bow and arrow were extremely solid, looking as if they were corporeal.

When Yan Jadetrue saw it, his pupils constricted too.

“Arrow of God Extermination!”

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan released three arrows in a row, and it actually swept up a horrifying power of rule.

The spiritual energy undulation from the arrow tip was actually not the slightest bit weaker than Yan Jadetrue’s Immortal Exterminating Finger!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Two powerful bursts of soul force exploded above the void.

The two people gave a muffled groan at the same time and flew out backward.

Their origin divinities actually became much dimmer in an instant.

Yan Jadetrue looked at Ye Yuan ferociously and gnashed his teeth in hatred as he said, “What a fierce origin divinity mystic art! It looks like in these short few hundred years, you’ve had an incredibly lucky encounter on the Rainclear Continent again! However, brat, can you beat me by using this kind of mutual destruction fighting style?”

Ye Yuan was not the slightest bit afraid and said in a cold voice, “Won’t you know after trying it?”

Done talking, he did not hesitate in the slightest and bent the bow and notched the arrows again!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The Arrow of God Extermination was released three times in a row again!

Yan Jadetrue’s expression changed wildly. This arrow was released with soul force and was unrivaledly tyrannical. He had no way to evade at all.

He gritted his teeth and pointed a finger out again.

“Immortal Exterminating Finger!”

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The void trembled, the aftershocks of the two people’s battle spread extremely far away, attracting the attention of countless powerhouses.

“What a powerful origin divinity undulation! Who is fighting at Inklight Forest that side?”

“It’s actually two origin divinities that are fighting! What terrifying power, origin divinity mystic arts can actually erupt with such terrifying power!”

“Eh,?one of them seems to be a Saint Exalt powerhouse; the other … is so strong! That origin divinity undulation seems to have already surpassed Saint Exalt!”

“That lower Saint Sovereign Heaven is so strong, to actually fight with the other party until neither can gain the upper hand! But at this rate, the two of their origin divinities will both be annihilated, right?”

… …

Ever since the passageway was connected, Inklight Forest had many powerhouses gathered to begin with.

When they saw Ye Yuan jump realms to battle, each and every one of them was dumbstruck with amazement.

These two origin divinities were not on the same level at all. In the end, they actually fought to a draw.

This kind of battle was too inconceivable.

In virtually a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan released dozens of arrows. His origin divinity was becoming dim at a speed visible to the naked eye.

However, Yan Jadetrue’s origin divinity was no better too.

Divine Emergence’s mystic art, Arrow of God Extermination, was a fighting style that gambled with one’s life.

With their own soul force as a guide, it erupted with an incomparably powerful lethality, obliterating the other party’s origin divinity.

This move was incredibly powerful but also caused self-destruction to kill the enemy.

Ye Yuan was gambling. He was betting that Yan Jadetrue could not hold out first!

This was because there was still the Frivolous Life Like a Dream in Yan Jadetrue’s origin divinity!
