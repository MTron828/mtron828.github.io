Chapter 2546: This Joke is Really Hilarious!

“Master!”

Seeing the arrival, Xie Hua was overjoyed.

At this time, there was only Lin Lan who could suppress Lu Yun.

However, the expressions of Lu Yun and the rest changed wildly.

Even Lu Yun also did not expect that with Lin Lan’s identity, he would actually personally take action for a measly little Tang Family!

It seemed like his desire to destroy Ye Yuan was already as firm as iron.

Lu Yun’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Nation Teacher came forth in person for a measly little Tang Family. It really caught this Lu by surprise!”

Lin Lan smiled and said, “Didn’t Younger Brother Lu also move out in person for a measly little Tang Family? The Tang Family brought chaos upon the alchemy world, causing the atmosphere of the entire imperial city to be foul everywhere. It isn’t considered overboard for this nation teacher to want to take them down, right? Or is it that that one point affinity ascender can really refine heavenly pills?”

The corners of Lu Yun’s mouth twitched slightly, because he had never seen Ye Yuan refine pills with his own eyes before.

There was only Jiang Yu alone who had truly seen him before.

Sometimes, public clamor could melt metals.

When the entire world was denying a person, no matter how much you said, it was useless too.

Lu Yun and Second Prince clearly did not have much confidence in Ye Yuan refining a heavenly pill too.

After all, this was something impossible in the first place.

“This … Whether can or not, we got to witness it before we’ll know!” Lu Yun argued.

Lin Lan smiled and said, “Yeah, indeed need to witness it. It’s just that … this nation teacher feels that that brat has probably long already slipped away! Whether he’s in here or not is already very hard to say. Otherwise, why did he suddenly go into terminal seclusion?”

Lu Yun’s expression became rather ugly.

Indeed, if Ye Yuan really could not refine a heavenly pill, he might very likely have already slipped away now.

How could he be in closed-seclusion here stupidly?

“Big Brother he’s right inside!” Tang Yu vomited blood from his mouth, using a hoarse voice to roar.

After a bout of pummeling, Tang Yu currently had a bloodied nose and swollen face, fresh blood flowing across his body, his appearance incomparably miserable.

When Lin Lan heard this, he still smiled and said, “Child, if he already left, can you discover it with the likes of you?”

Tang Yu choked when he heard that, but immediately said, “Big Brother definitely won’t run away!”

Lin Lan smiled slightly and said, “Whether he left or not, we’ll naturally know after breaking this array formation. If he isn’t here, your Tang Family will have nothing to say anymore, right?”

Tang Yu said stubbornly, “If he isn’t here, want to kill or dismember my Tang Family is up to your disposal!”

In the past, he did not understand Ye Yuan.

But along with the passing of time, his understanding of Ye Yuan gradually grew deeper, only then, discovering that this was someone who valued relationships and loyalty immensely.

Want him to believe that Ye Yuan fled? That was impossible!

Lin Lan smiled and arrived before the door.

The imposing aura of a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum suddenly erupted and Lin Lan smashed a fist towards the grand array.

But right at this time, the door opened from inside with a creak. Ye Yuan’s figure appeared in front of everyone.

“Eh??So many people? So lively! This brother, this Ye doesn’t have grudges nor enmity with you, why did you smash my door?” Ye Yuan asked in puzzlement.

Lin Lan was stunned. Clearly, he did not expect Ye Yuan to leave seclusion at this time.

Let alone did he imagine that Ye Yuan actually really did not leave.

In his view, Ye Yuan dragging it out and not daring to show face was absolutely due to a guilty conscience.

How could this kind of person possibly refine a heavenly pill?

But Lu Yun’s expression changed, and he said, “Ye Yuan, you mustn’t be rude! This is our Eastward Country’s Nation Teacher Lin Lan, Eastward alchemy world’s number one person!”

Ye Yuan had just exited seclusion and had not figured out the situation yet.

However, he already saw that the Tang Family father and son were beaten until they were unrecognizable. How could he still not understand what had happened?

Fury rose from the bottom of his heart.

“Eastward alchemy world’s number one person, is it??Huhu,?then these people were all brought by you?” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

The tone was already rather unfriendly.

Lin Lan nodded faintly and said, “That’s right. You can think of it as they were brought by this nation teacher. The Tang Family brought chaos to the alchemy world and spread rumors, this nation teacher is searching and confiscating the Tang Family’s property. Why? What’s wrong with it?”

Ye Yuan said, “Spread rumors? What rumors? That I know how to refine heavenly pills?”

This kind of thing, use one’s buttocks to think and one would also know.

Lin Lan smiled and said, “Why? You aren’t going to tell this Nation Teacher that you really know how to refine heavenly pills, right?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Why? Can’t I?”

“Hahaha?… a one point affinity pitiful bug. Even if you’re posturing, you also have to pick your target, alright? Posturing in front of Master, aren’t you asking for trouble?” Xie Hua laughed loudly when he heard that.

When others heard it, mocking smiles also came over.

“Really ignorant, already told him that Nation Teacher is the alchemy path’s number one person, he’s still asking for trouble!”

“He hid in this dilapidated house for so long and not dare to come out. To say that he knows how to refine heavenly pills, I won’t believe it even if you beat me to death!”

“The Tang Family was scolded for so long and this guy didn’t even come out to clarify. He clearly has a guilty conscience! Refining heavenly pill? A hilarious joke!”

… …

At this point, no one believed that Ye Yuan knew how to refine pills anymore.

Something that was originally impossible, a six-month long closed-seclusion was enough to deny everything.

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s tough attitude at this time was just looking for a rebuff in the eyes of others.

The Tang Family was destroyed for sure today.

Ye Yuan was also dead for sure today.

Lin Lan could not help laughing as he said, “I heard before that your talent is pretty good. But, it’s impossible for one point affinity to refine heavenly pills!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “If I refine it?”

Lin Lan still shook his head and said, “Absolutely impossible! In the 33 Heavens, no one with one point affinity has refined a heavenly pill!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and changed the topic, “They said that you’re Eastward alchemy path’s number one person?”

Lin Lan smiled and said, “At least so far, no one in Eastward can surpass this nation teacher in Alchemy Dao!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In Eastward this border place, heavenly alchemists were very rare to begin with.

Each heavenly alchemist had extremely venerated status.

But Lin Lan was the most illustrious one, not one of!

Therefore, his words were full of confidence.

When Ye Yuan heard that, he just said coolly, “Since that’s the case, then this Ye will challenge you, this Eastward alchemy path’s number one person! Do you dare accept it or not?”

The moment these words came out, the whole place became deathly silent.

And right away, there was a burst of roaring laughter.

“A one point heavenly alchemist wants to challenge Nation Teacher! This is the most hilarious joke that I’ve heard in the past 100 years!”

“I’m dying of laughter! It’s really killing me! Did this ascender break his brain when he ascended?”

“He had an appearance of seriously challenging Nation Teacher! It’s really scary! Nation Teacher, you mustn’t accept it, I’m scared!”

… …

The ridiculing voices reached their peak.

If a one point heavenly alchemist was a massive joke in itself, then Ye Yuan’s challenge was really going to shatter the firmament with laughter!

Even Tang Yu, Lu Yun, and the rest were also thunderstruck until they were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.

This challenge was really an astonishing move!

Even if Ye Yuan was really a one point heavenly alchemist, this was also the biggest joke since ancient times!

Lin Lan maintained a proper demeanor and said with a slight smile, “Young man, your courage is commendable! It’s just that, you heard it too. This joke is really very funny!”
