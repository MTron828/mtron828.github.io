Chapter 1294: You Guys Are Too Slow!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This blade was undeniably planned. One cut directly severed Liang Wanru’s aorta. Blood immediately gushed out in torrents.

Even though these demonic beasts were Tier 9, they were like the Immortal Grove World’s desolate beasts, savage and yet to become civilized.

Sensing the taste of blood, all of them indeed pounced over towards Liang Wanru crazily.

That instant just now, Ye Yuan almost believed it too!

Did not expect that this Liang Wanrong was actually as venomous as a viper, feeding her elder sister to the tiger’s maws to let herself escape!

Liang Wanrong swept past, her figure already a thousand feet away.

“Zhang Shun, let’s go!”

“Second Miss, this ...”

“What? Do you have the confidence to deal with this beast tide?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Zhang Shun shook his head. This was a certain-death situation!

“Then what are you still waiting for? Doesn’t my good elder sister like that gigolo? Becoming a pair with him and having the same fate, Elder Sister should be thanking me!” Liang Wanrong said with a sneer.

Zhang Shun gave a glance over there pitifully. he let out a sigh and led the group of guards break out of the encirclement.

Over there, Liang Wanru’s and Ye Yuan’s profiles could not be seen already, completely engulfed by the frenzied demonic beasts.

A hint of a smug smile flashed across the corners of Liang Wanrong’s mouth. Finally, that annoying woman die!

Even though the majority of the demonic beasts were attracted by Liang Wanru, there were still quite a number of demonic beasts in the surroundings. It was not that easy for them to want to escape.

The group of guards fought desperately. In the blink of an eye, they broke out several miles away.

“Second Miss, it’s not right! Why do I feel like the demonic beasts are getting more and more, unable to kill them entirely!” Zhang Shun said with a solemn expression.

Liang Wanrong clearly also realized this problem, her expression becoming very ugly.

“It’s all that slut, couldn’t even delay for a moment! Really useless! Don’t be long-winded anymore! Hurry up and charge outside. Otherwise, none of us can escape!” Liang Wanrong said fiercely.

Everyone did not dare to dawdle, making a concerted effort to break through.

Zhang Shun indeed deserved to be a Grotto Profound Deity Realm powerhouse. Walking among these Tier 9 demonic beasts was akin to entering an unpopulated land unobstructed.

However, the demonic beasts’ numbers were seriously too many to kill finish!

“Roar!”

An enormous roar came over. Zhang Shun’s expression suddenly changed.

He could judge from this pressure that it was absolutely a divine beast!

An afterimage flashed past, Zhang Shun’s expression changed drastically and instinctively blocked it.

Boom!

The powerful Zhang Shun was directly knocked flying out, spewing out a mouthful of golden blood.

This was the special hallmark of Deity Realm powerhouses!

“It’s a Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard!” Zhang Shun cried out in shock.

A Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard could be said to be overlord-rank demonic beasts in the forest. Its figure was not large, but its speed was incomparably strange. It was practically two to three times of human martial artists in the same realm!

Once tangled with it, there was virtually no possibility of survival!

Hence, that was why Zhang Shun would be so shocked.

The other people’s faces all revealed looks of despair. With the Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard here, they virtually did not have the possibility of escaping.

Zhang Shun sucked in a deep breath. A hint of ferociousness flashed across his eyes, and he said, “You all protect Second Miss to break through! I’ll cover the rear and deal with this beast!”

This Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard’s strength was very formidable. Battling together with Zhang Shun, it firmly overpowered Zhang Shun.

The party retreated as they fought. The guards were either injured or dead.

This beast tide’s scale was not considered large, but it was also not what a martial artist team of several dozen people could withstand.

After a great battle, Zhang Shun was overpowered by the Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard until he could not catch his breath. Very soon, he was covered all over with wounds.

The guard team was surrounded by large numbers of demonic beasts and already had no way out. The numbers were dwindling.

The originally close to a hundred people team was only left with over 20 people.

Just as everyone lost all hope, the group of demonic beasts suddenly stopped the attacks.

Even the Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard also stopped its attacks against Zhang Shun.

Zhang Shun’s breathing was ragged, dark golden-colored bloodstains everywhere on his body.

Under everyone’s protection, Liang Wanrong was slightly better than the rest. But it was also just a little better.

The current Liang Wanrong was dressed in tattered clothes. Quite a number of places were ripped apart by demonic beasts, just like a beggar.

Although the group of demonic beasts stopped the assault, they surrounded and did not attack, and did not have the intention of letting everyone go.

“Second Miss, are you alright?” Zhang Shun asked.

“I’m still alright. Zhang Shun, what’s this situation?” Liang Wanrong said with a gloomy look.

Zhang Shun shook his head and said, “I don’t know! The demonic beasts in a beast tide are all in a berserk state. Logically speaking, this kind of situation won’t happen. Looking at these demonic beasts’ appearance, a beast king might have appeared.”

Zhang Shun was a veteran and made his own judgment on this situation.

It was just that this judgment made everyone despair.

A Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard was enough for them to choke on already. A beast king that even it had to steer clear of? What would it be like?

Liang Wanrong’s face revealed a look of unwillingness. She did not imagine that that disappointing elder sister could not even delay for a while. What a good-for-nothing!

As for Ye Yuan, she thought even lesser of him.

Just a cripple, he would probably be torn to pieces by those demonic beasts instantly.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

...

The entire Myriad Beast Forest started quaking from these heavy footsteps.

These demonic beasts all trembled incessantly, lowering their proud heads.

A beast king passing through, myriad beasts prostrated in worship!

The faces of Zhang Shun and the rest became even more incredibly ugly. This commotion, there was definitely an even more powerful divine beast appearing!

A giant elephant approached from far away, entering everyone’s line of sight.

Even that Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard also opened up a path, clearly incredibly wary of this giant elephant.

“It’s a Devilheaven Giant Elephant! This Devilheaven Giant Elephant is a late-stage rank one divine beast!” Zhang Shun exclaimed.

That Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard was merely an initial-stage rank one divine beast.

A late-stage rank one demonic beast was sufficient to become the beast king among these demonic beasts already!

No wonder these demonic beasts all submitted in worship.

“Your Excellency, you look on that Devilheaven Giant Elephant’s back, seems like there’s somebody!” a subordinate suddenly said to Zhang Shun.

Zhang Shun was startled and could not help looking over at that elephant’s back. Sure enough, he discovered two silhouettes.

It was just because of the angle, he could not see those two figures clearly.

But without a doubt, there were really people riding on the elephant’s back!

This shock was by no means insignificant!

A late-stage rank one Devilheaven Giant Elephant’s strength was incomparably fearsome.

Even in Jewelhill City, the martial artists capable of rivaling it were not many either.

But now, there was actually someone riding on its back!

Divine beasts and ordinary demonic beasts were different. Each one was incomparably noble.

Even if the martial artist’s strength was stronger than them, it was also impossible to allow the other party to ride on its back!

Unless the martial artist’s strength was powerful to a certain degree and subdued the Devilheaven Giant Elephant to become a mount.

Could it be that the strength of those two people on the elephant’s back was actually so formidable?

Zhang Shun’s face suddenly revealed a look of wild elation, and he said to Liang Wanrong, “Second Miss, perhaps we’re not fated to die!”

Liang Wanrong was thrilled and immediately understood Zhang Shun’s meaning. She shouted in the Devilheaven Giant Elephant’s direction in a clear voice, “Seniors, this junior is the daughter of Jewelhill City’s Liang Family. I, unfortunately, encountered this beast tide when passing through the Myriad Beast Forest. Hope that two seniors can take action to rescue us. The Liang Family will definitely thank the two seniors considerably!”

The Liang Family’s influence in the Jewelhill City area was still very great. Liang Wanrong believed that the other party definitely heard of the Liang Family’s great name before.

At this time, the Devilheaven Giant Elephant came close. A mocking voice came from on top of the elephant’s back, “You guys are too slow. Why have you only walked this far?”
