Chapter 539: Immense Popularity

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Wine cups clanged, and wine flowed freely in the main hall. The guests were already utterly conquered by the Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew long ago.

“Wu Xuan, just based on our friendship, you have got to give me a flask of this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew later. Oh, no, ten flasks!” By Wu Xuan’s side, a Divine Traversing Realm expert slung his arm around Wu Xuan.

“Wu Xuan, our relationship is solid enough, right? If you give him ten flasks, I can’t get lesser than ten flasks no matter what, right?” said another person.

Wu Xuan’s head was already long messed up by these fellows who tried to curry favor. Flinging his hand, he said, “Shoo shoo shoo! Do you all think that this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew is some jug wine by the roadside? With your ways of giving out, no matter how many I have, it will all be given away too! Telling you all honestly, this old man, I, only took these Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew out for everybody to sample because today is Younger Brother Ye’s parents’ wedding day! After today huh, whoever wants it will have to splurge!”

When Wu Xuan brewed the low-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew, he already anticipated today’s situation.

He already discussed it with Ye Yuan to place this low-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew onto the market to sell. It would definitely earn a hefty amount!

Wu Xuan bringing these Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew over today was naturally in order to boost Ye Yuan’s face. But it was not without the intention of promoting this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew either.

Those who could enter the main hall today were all upper echelons in Wu Fang City. They were either wealthy or with connections.

As soon as the Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew rolled out into the market, only these people could afford it.

Fu Yunjing’s Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew definitely had some parts omitted in the brewing process. Hence, the production output had always not been high.

This was also the reason why Fu Yunjing cherished his own belongings all along.

Wu Xuan cleared his throat and said in a clear voice, “Today, everybody could drink this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew all thanks to Younger Brother Ye Yuan. However, this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew wasn’t picked up from the streets. Just the materials expended in brewing the alcohol is a huge sum of money! After today, if everybody wishes to drink this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew, you can go to Drunken Immortal Restaurant.”

With Wu Xuan saying this, everyone came to understand as well.

Why, this Wu Xuan came today to cast a long line to cast a big fish!

But those present were all respected figures. Regarding Wu Xuan’s way of doing things, there was no cause for much criticism.

Such a delicious vintage wine like the Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew was naturally not what some lousy common street-ware could compare to.

Yet, the most important thing was that this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew could actually be mass produced!

“Wu Xuan, you mean that . . . we can all drink such a delicious vintage wine any time in the future?”

Wu Xuan smiled faintly and said, “That might not be the case! Such a vintage brew, the materials needed are extremely precious! Don’t look at how I brought so much here today. Actually, it already expended close to 20% of this old man’s assets! Therefore . . . although Drunken Immortal Restaurant will provide this wine all year round, it’s only limited to ten flasks per day! First come, first serve!”

Everyone all drew a cold breath. Twenty barrels of Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew actually cost Wu Xuan 20% of his assets!

Wu Xuan as an Alchemy Sovereign expert, his assets definitely surpassed ordinary martial artists by a great deal!

20% of his assets was absolutely a huge sum of wealth.

One could see from this just how terrifying the expenditure to brew this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew was!

Originally, those who were still savoring it in large mouthfuls already could not bear to lift their cups now. This wine, drinking a mouthful was one lesser!

Actually, Wu Xuan’s words had areas of exaggeration. He did indeed spend a huge sum of money on brewing this alcohol. But it was naturally impossible to be just twenty barrels.

Furthermore, the most costly expenditure was not this low-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew, but it was the middle-grade.

The middle-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew was on an entirely different level from the low-grade. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The low-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew that Wu Xuan brought here today was just half of what he brewed this time. And adding up the costs of these forty barrels of low-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew, it was not even half of the middle-grade.

The middle-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew was still in the process of brewing. But, the output was merely one barrel.

Such an expenditure, even with Wu Xuan’s massive wealth, it was also somewhat unbearable.

However, with the recipe that Ye Yuan gave, Wu Xuan’s future wealth could be predicted.

Don’t look at how alchemists were all very rich. Actually, their expenditures were immense too.

Following the increase in their strength, the expended essence crystals and medicinal herbs also soared exponentially.

Hence, nobody would complain about having too much money.

“Isn’t ten flasks too little? Wu Xuan, essence crystals are not an issue. This alcohol, I’ll reserve a barrel first. The next time it’s out, give it to our Zhang Family first, alright?” Wu Fang City’s Zhang Family Head yelled out.

Wu Xuan shook his head and said, “Old Man Zhang, not that I, Wu Xuan, am miserly. The process of brewing this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew is extremely troublesome. There’s simply no way of providing a large supply. Otherwise, I wouldn’t limit it to ten flasks daily too. This old man indeed still has some remaining stock. But giving this inventory to you, the other families will shred me up!”

With Wu Xuan saying this, there were immediately people from the other families who were indignant.

“That’s right. Old Man Zhang, are you the only rich one? Our Sun Family can still afford this bit of essence crystals! You want a barrel, this father of yours wants ten barrels!”

“The City Lord Manor hasn’t even spoken yet. What capabilities does your Zhang Family have to dare swallow a barrel all at once!”

“In my opinion, it’s still Wu Xuan’s method that is good. Ten flasks daily. First come first serve. This way, it’s fair to everyone!”

Seeing this scene, Wu Xuan was also secretly delighted in his heart.

Actually, the low-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew really did not have many troublesome aspects. He originally also planned on selling barrel by barrel.

But after he told his plans to Ye Yuan, it was denied by Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s idea was very simple. An object was valued relative to its rarity!

If it were supplied unlimitedly, when everybody drank a ton of it, this Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew would not be valuable anymore either.

But if it was just supplying ten flasks a day, everyone could not drink to their heart’s content each time. Hence, they would all break their heads every day fighting to snatch those ten flasks of wine.

In just a few days, these ten flasks of Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew would be raised to a sky-high price!

This wine, ordinary people and factions simply could not drink it. At that time, it would become a symbol of identity and status.

After waiting for a suitable time, Wu Xuan would then roll out the middle-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew. That way, the middle-grade Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew would become a supreme level of immortal brew. Regardless of how the price was set, it would be up to Wu Xuan’s call.

In a corner of the main hall, Fu Yunjing had a depressed look.

Wu Xuan this old man pestered him daily in the past for the Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew. He himself put on a nonchalant appearance too.

Finally, Wu Xuan paid a very large price before getting six flasks from his place.

Who knew that in a twinkle, this old man produced Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew himself. Not only was the quality much better than his, but it could also actually be mass-produced!

His opening move was twenty barrels! What a big play!

Fu Yunjing himself sampled a mouthful earlier. The taste was indeed much better than his.

Furthermore, he actually did not know that drinking the Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew unexpectedly needed Southern Sandalwood to be the cup!

Just where on earth did this old fellow learn it?

How could Fu Yunjing not wish to mass-produce the Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew? But, the success rate of his brewing was too low and simply had no way of satisfying the market demand.

The source of income which landed in his hands was given away with both hands just like this. Fu Yunjing’s gloominess would be imagined.

He picked up the wine cup and slowly walked towards Wu Xuan.
