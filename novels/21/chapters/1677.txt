Chapter 1681 Sparing None!

“Nirvana Seal!”

Ye Yuan roared. The Nirvana Seal sped like the wind, speeding swiftly towards the Xiang Yunfei in the horizon.

Under everyone’s eyes, this black huge seal tore straight across the sky and landed on Xiang Yunfei.

Rumble!

The Nirvana Seal arrived first despite launching later, striking Xiang Yunfei firmly, directly blasting him into dregs.

Back then, when Ye Yuan was only Origin Deity Realm, he could also use the Nirvana Seal to kill the second-layered heaven Divine Lord Jing Lu.

Now that he broke through to Divine Vortex Realm, the power of this move already could not be mentioned in the same breath.

If Xiang Yunfei did not use that blood escape art, he might still be able to resist a little. But he took the road to ruin by using that move. His condition immediately fell drastically, virtually becoming a living target.

Ye Yuan had witnessed this move of his before, how could he possibly not guard again his move, and give him the chance to escape?

Boss He this group of people was long dumbfounded from watching.

Over a dozen breaths of time, Ye Yuan finished off a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord neatly and tidily!

This kind of strength simply made people despair.

“Just what kind of ... monster did Xiang Yunfei that fellow provoke?!”

Boss He was overwhelmed with terror. He had roamed Riverluck Capital City unhindered for so many years and had never met such a terrifying opponent before.

His guts could not be said to not be big. To dare act against a seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse and even successfully killing the other party.

To others, he was a nightmare-like existence.

But today, he finally encountered his nightmare.

Killing Xiang Yunfei with one move, Ye Yuan looked down from high above, looking at Boss He with his hands behind his back, just like a god of war descending.

Boss He’s entire body shuddered, not daring to meet Ye Yuan’s gaze at all.

“Y-Your Excellency, I ... I was wrong! I beg you, don’t kill me!”

Boss He this kind of person always liked to hide and scheme against people. He was actually very fragile inwardly.

Ye Yuan’s domineering assault already utterly shattered his confidence, giving him an image of invincibility.

Hence, he yielded.

Ye Yuan laughed coldly and said in a cold voice, “Tianping, do it! Spare no one!”

He was genuinely enraged. If not for him making use of the electric snake to temper his fleshy body in the realm fog, he would already be a corpse right now.

This group of guys colluded together with Xiang Yunfei, one look and it was clear that they were not good people.

Not killing was insufficient to calm his fury.

Ning Tianping was similarly like so. Previously, if not for His Excellency’s dragon roar shattering those arrows, he would have long been shot into a sieve.

His anger currently was not the slightest bit less than Ye Yuan’s. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But the combat power that Ye Yuan displayed just now also made him secretly tongue-tied.

Too fierce!

Witnessing Ye Yuan’s fury, how could Boss He still dare to stay? With a loud roar, he turned tail and ran!

It was just that his strength was even worse than Xiang Yunfei’s. So how could wanting to run be that easy?

Over ten people scattered and fled in all directions. Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, his figure moving, shuttling through the void and arriving straight amidst the crowd.

“Roar!”

A dragon roar reverberated throughout the sky. Those Divine Lord Realm powerhouses who were just about to escape, their figures suddenly stopped.

Those who were slightly weaker were directly shattered into dust by the Voice of the Dragon God.

Boss He’s entire body trembled, his eyes full of astonishment.

Only now did he know how terrifying this roar of Ye Yuan’s was!

He, his fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses, was actually unable to control himself under this roar, almost falling down.

One had to know, even if Ye Yuan’s fleshy body reached the peak of initial-stage fourth transformation, it was still a long way off from fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

With just a roar, it was actually able to make him, this fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord, unable to move!

Right at this time, Ye Yuan stopped the Voice of the Dragon God.

Ning Tianping understood tacitly, long sword brandishing, turning into a stream of flowing light and charged towards Boss He.

“Puchi!”

Ning Tianping did not give Boss He the slightest chance, directly killing him.

The remaining people were all shaken by Ye Yuan until they were dazed and confused, unable to differentiate north, south, east, west, at all.

Ning Tianping, one person and one sword, reaped wantonly, virtually wiping out the other side in a few breaths.

After doing this, Ye Yuan was hit with exhaustion, almost unable to stand firmly and dropping down from the sky.

The great battle just now seemed like the wind scattering away wisps of clouds. Actually, to Ye Yuan, the expenditure was immense too.

Employing the Voice of the Dragon God twice in a row and using the Universe Dragon Claw, coupled with the horrifying Nirvana Seal, this kind of expenditure was not what ordinary people could support at all.

After all, he had merely just broken through to Divine Vortex Realm currently too.

Ning Tianping’s expression changed and he cried out, “Your Excellency, are you alright?”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “I’m fine, don’t need to care about me. Go and collect all of their storage rings. This set of array formation is indeed very powerful. Boss He definitely can’t set it up. There should be array flags supporting. Having this set of array formation is also a major card up my sleeves.”

Ning Tianping’s eyes lit up and he immediately acted accordingly.

Sure enough, Ning Tianping found a pile of storage rings on Boss He’s body and found an array flag inside.

Ye Yuan rested and rehabilitated for a while, his complexion also looked much better.

He took the array flag and looked, and said with a nod, “That’s it! This array formation is indeed good stuff! No wonder Boss He could kill a seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse. Caught off-guard, even a seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord will be hard-pressed to block this Wind Breaking Arrow too!”

If not for the Voice of the Dragon God being too tyrannical, their current outcome would also be not much different from that seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord.

This array formation was obtained by Boss He in a mystic realm in his early years. At that time, it was already regarded as a precious treasure.

Sure enough, in these ten thousand years, he could be said to have slaughtered everything in his path by relying on this array formation.

Furthermore, he was low-profile and rarely revealed his real body in front of people; very mysterious.

Therefore, even though his strength was not strong, other people’s faces changed when they heard about him.

Seeing the array flag and Wind Breaking Arrows, Ning Tianping felt lingering fear too.

This thing was indeed too dangerous.

Moreover, Boss He was clearly already familiar with this move. The timing was grasped beautifully, not giving them any chance to react at all.

Fortunately, His Excellency reacted extremely fast, shattering the Wind Breaking Arrows with a roar. Otherwise, the consequences would be too ghastly to imagine.

“Your Excellency, you’re really too extraordinarily brave today! That Boss He was dumbfounded from watching and didn’t react for a long time. I even thought that breaking through to become a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord, I can be Your Excellency’s guard for a period of time. I didn’t expect that I’m already going to hold you back,” Ning Tianping said with a bitter smile.

Ning Tianping’s astonishment in his heart was not the slightest bit less than Boss He’s.

After Ye Yuan broke through, it was also his first time truly seeing Ye Yuan take action.

This was true-blue raw power, without the slightest trickery.

Xiang Yunfei’s strength naturally need not be said.

But under Ye Yuan’s hands, he actually did not even have the strength to retaliate!

His Excellency was indeed still as freakish as before!

When at Origin Deity Realm, he could already annihilate a second-layered heaven Divine Lord.

After breaking through, Ning Tianping did not doubt in the slightest that Ye Yuan was able to defeat third-layered heaven Divine Lords. But he never dreamed that Ye Yuan was actually able to directly annihilate fourth-layered heaven Divine Lords!

One had to know, the gap between Origin Deity Realm and first-layered heaven Divine Lord was far from the disparity between first-layered heaven Divine Lord and fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord!

Ye Yuan patted Ning Tianping’s shoulder and said with a smile, “I had some fortuitous encounters at the Heavenspan Mountain, so my strength increased significantly. Alright, let’s go back to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City!”
