Chapter 1127: Unexpected Turn of Events

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Younger Brother Ji, long time no see. Why are you in such a hurry?”

The Heaven Stabilizing Divine King fanned his paper fan, with the appearance of an elegant young master.

Looked too frail to stand up to a gust of wind, but in reality, he was the most dangerous man in the entire Divine Realm.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed together. Not seeing him for many years, Zhuge Qingxuan’s strength became increasingly unfathomable. This was not a good sign!

The last time he met with Zhuge Qingxuan was more than a hundred years ago.

At that time, the oppressive feeling that Zhuge Qingxuan gave Ye Yuan was far from as powerful as right now.

Looks like over these 20 years, the one who improved was not just him, Ye Yuan, alone!

“Zhuge Qingxuan, put away that act of yours! You’re saying it like this young master is very familiar with you,” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly.

Since he could not run, then there was only a fight.

If it was a frontal-clash, Ye Yuan was not even Cloudsky and Nangong Zifeng’s match, let alone Zhuge Qingxuan who was known as the Divine Realm’s number one.

Ye Yuan also did not think that Zhuge Qingxuan’s speed was actually so fast. He only used an hour and blocked him.

One had to know that with his current speed, even Nangong Zifeng might not be able to catch up.

For Zhuge Qingxuan to be able to catch up was not strange. But this speed was truly a bit too freakish.

Zhuge Qingxuan’s brows raised up, and he said coolly, “Fine then. Since that’s the case, how should the matter of you slaughtering the Holy City today be resolved?”

The Heaven Stabilizing Divine King was calm and collected and did not have much sullen anger mixed inside.

But his words radiated awe without being furious.

“Heh, don’t be so hypocritical, alright? If you covet the divine inscriptions, just say it straight. Those people are merely ant-like existences to you. Don’t tell me that you only chased after because you have compassion for them!” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile

The corners of Zhuge Qingxuan’s mouth curled slightly, and he said with a faint smile, “Huhu, a straightforward person doesn’t resort to insinuations. Hand over the divine inscriptions, and I’ll make it painless for you!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The moment the word ‘painless’ came out of his mouth, a faintly discernible source power instantly spread out.

Ye Yuan instantly felt the entire world crushing down toward him.

A faint Divine Dao power of laws spilling over warded this pressure off outside.

Seeing this scene, the Heaven Stabilizing Divine King’s gaze sharpened slightly, and actually revealed some delight.

“Looks like your extent of shamelessness as the Yu Soul Sect’s number one person in this age is the greatest in the world!” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Zhuge Qingxuan did not get too annoyed and said coolly, “Since you know, it seems like there’s no need for this seat to waste my breath. Are you handing it over yourself, or do you want this seat to personally take action?”

In Zhuge Qingxuan’s eyes, those divine king powerhouses, even void mystic powerhouses, were also merely ant-like existences.

Perhaps Cloudsky and Nangong Zifeng they all would still take to heart their secular status, and care about the life and death of the Holy City’s powerhouses.

But Zhuge Qingxuan would not care at all.

What was truly able to move him was only Deity Realm!

Ye Yuan also smiled lightly and said, “If you have the capabilities, come and take it yourself!”

Swish!

Zhuge Qingxuan folded his fan and put it away, and still had a collected look as he said, “Looks like you’re refusing a toast only to drink to a forfeit!”

Zhuge Qingxuan’s fan pointing out, the entire world collapsed because of it!

Ye Yuan’s eyes turned intent. An oppressive force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas instantly restrained his entire person!

The art of greater teleportation actually utterly lost effectiveness at this instant!

Bystanders completely had no way of imagining how such a sloppy and ordinary attack actually encompassed the might of heaven and earth!

“Your Divine Dao laws are too simple and plain!”

Zhuge Qingxuan had a look of disdain.

In this world, powerhouses able to obtain divine inscriptions could be counted on one’s fingers.

But powerhouses able to comprehend divine inscriptions were in the minority.

But if discussing whose comprehension in Divine Realm laws ranked at the top of the list in the Divine Realm, it was none other than the Heaven Stabilizing Divine King, Zhuge Qingxuan!

Previous life, Ye Yuan had interactions with Zhuge Qingxuan before.

It was just that at that time, Zhuge Qingxuan did not display his true strength before at all.

But today, Ye Yuan finally experienced why Zhuge Qingxuan was able to be respectfully titled the Heaven Stabilizing Divine King!

This fan, Ye Yuan actually had a feeling of being powerless to resolve it.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Ye Yuan sensed that his surrounding space was collapsing due to it.

Along with it, his body also had a feeling of being torn apart by space.

Currently, Ye Yuan was able to feel that the Divine Dao laws which Zhuge Qingxuan comprehended were much stronger than his!

“Puu, puu, puu ...”

Ye Yuan’s powerful fleshy body actually cracked apart inch by inch under the heavy pressure, fresh blood spraying wildly.

Ye Yuan clenched his jaws tightly, feeling like the entire world was crumbling.

This was the true power of Divine Dao laws.

Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao had merely just crossed the threshold.

Facing Zhuge Qingxuan, he was too weak!

“Huhu, when the tiger isn’t in the mountains, the monkey proclaims itself as king! Do you really think that my Holy City is a soft persimmon that anybody can knead?”

Zhuge Qingxuan had plenty of strength to spare and was filled with scorn towards Ye Yuan.

The blood vessels in Ye Yuan’s arms and legs ruptured inch by inch, fresh blood pouring out like a fountain.

He finally knew why the Ten Great Divine Kings were hailed as invincible.

The Divine Realm’s number one was too strong!

Ye Yuan’s greatest reliance was greater teleportation.

It was also precisely because he had this secret art that he dared to dance around with a powerhouse like Cloudsky.

But now, his greater teleportation could not be displayed!

Right at this time, Cloudsky finally rushed over. He was just in time to see the scene of Ye Yuan’s death throes and could not help letting out a wild laugh.

This entire day, he was in a state of extreme breakdown.

Seeing Ye Yuan about to be eradicated, all of Cloudsky’s dejection was released at this moment.

“Ji brat, aren’t you very arrogant? Didn’t you want to wipe out my Holy City’s Dao teachings? Why don’t you wipe it out?!” Cloudsky said with a wild laugh.

Toward Cloudsky’s mocking, Ye Yuan turned a deaf ear to it.

He did not have time to care about Cloudsky’s ridiculing at all!

The current Ye Yuan already entered a mysterious state.

Zhuge Qingxuan’s pressure made his fleshy body sustain tremendous pressure.

But the Vast Heaven Stele in his body actually had a reaction at this time!

Skydistant imparted Ye Yuan the Vast Heaven Chaos Spell. But this kind of profound Divine Dao laws, Ye Yuan had not learned the rudiments yet.

But now, Ye Yuan felt like his head was exploding.

Those divine inscriptions like just like a bunch of bandits, forcefully barging into his sea of consciousness.

After obtaining the Vast Heaven Chaos Spell, Ye Yuan had once taken the initiative to attempt to comprehend it but gleaned nothing.

The hardest thing about divine inscriptions was crossing the threshold. The Vast Heaven Chaos Spell, Ye Yuan could not even cross the threshold.

Currently, it was as if those divine inscriptions had life. Ye Yuan clearly did not go and comprehend them, but they took the initiative to integrate into Ye Yuan’s mind.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled. A pale-yellow light thoroughly enveloped him.

The squashing of space originally was actually blocked outside by this pale-yellow light!

Zhuge Qingxuan’s smile immediately froze on his face.

His Divine Dao laws power was actually unable to advance an inch further!

He could not help increasing his force more, but ... that yellow light did not budge an inch, wrapping Ye Yuan up and protecting.
