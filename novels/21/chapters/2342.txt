Chapter 2348: Comprehending Time Law

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Really died ... What a powerful Heavenly Dao True Word!”

Zhang Lian was full of disbelief. On that beautiful face, it was full of shock.

Under Heavenly Dao True Word, the Battle Xuan Beast King was annihilated by Ye Yuan just like that.

“He was merely just feeling the power of time law just now. That’s why he would get into a dogfight with the Battle Xuan Beast King. If he really took action, he would have long since slain the Battle Xuan Beast King,” Wan Zhen said.

Zhang Lian was already speechless.

He had been observing Ye Yuan the entire time just now and knew that Ye Yuan’s talent could not be underestimated.

But he did not think that Ye Yuan still had such heaven-defying means.

“A freak! Truly a little freak! This boy’s talent is too terrifying. If not for his cultivation realm being lacking, you and I are likely not his match anymore!” Zhang Lian exclaimed.

He finally somewhat understood now why Wan Zhen would specially come to see Ye Yuan.

This kid would become the most threatening person to them!

“Two fellow daoists have watched for so long. Aren’t you showing yourselves yet?”

Right at this time, a voice came over leisurely. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

Zhang Lian was taken aback again and said, “How did this boy know that we were spying on him?”

How could he know that Ye Yuan could even detect Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ spying, let alone them?

Wan Zhen was not too surprised and said indifferently, “Since we’re discovered, go over and meet him then.”

Hearing Wan Zhen two people report their names, Ye Yuan was a little surprised too.

He had never heard of Zhang Lian before, but Wan Zhen’s great name, he already heard no idea how many times these few years that his ears already grew calluses.

These few years, he was constantly being compared to Wan Zhen, not wanting to know also he could not do it.

Wan Zhen’s great name was resounding like the roar of thunder to Ye Yuan.

But upon meeting today, the other party gave him an unfathomable feeling.

Cloudaid City’s number one was indeed not boasted out.

“This Wan has paid attention to you for a long time already,” Wan Zhen said straightforwardly.

Ye Yuan was taken aback, then immediately smiled and said, “Does Brother Wan hope for this Ye to comprehend time law or to fail?”

Wan Zhen thought about it and said, “Both I guess.”

Ye Yuan was taken aback and said with a nod, “Brother Wan is very honest. However, Brother Wan actually hopes that I can comprehend it. This makes this Ye a little surprised.”

The impression that this Wan Zhen gave Ye Yuan was pretty good.

At least, he was not condescending like other geniuses. Furthermore, he was very candid.

The meaning of both was hoping, and also not hoping.

As the number one genius, something that even he could not do, but others achieved it, it was hard for him to avoid feeling uncomfortable in his heart.

This was human nature. Ye Yuan could understand it.

If it were him, he would similarly inevitably feel dejected in his heart.

But, while dejection was dejection, he would not be jealous of the other party with the heart of a despicable villain.

Very clearly, Wan Zhen was also such a person.

As for the reason that he hoped for it, Ye Yuan was rather curious.

“The human race needs a leader who can contend with the divine race!” Wan Zhen said coolly.

“I didn’t expect that Brother Wan is actually concerned about the overall situation. This Ye admires!” Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said.

These two people were chatting ardently, giving Zhang Lian the cold shoulder, making him feel like he became an outsider.

“Brat, your spatial law is so strong. Even if you want to become the human race’s leader, you should also push spatial law to the level of source first! You’re biting off more than one can chew like this! Furthermore, you wouldn’t really think that time law is so easy to comprehend, right? Wan Zhen this guy’s talent isn’t ordinary!” Zhang Lian suddenly spoke up.

When Wan Zhen heard this, he also said curiously, “What Zhang Lian says makes sense. With your intelligence, you shouldn’t do such an irrational thing. Hence, this Wan is also very curious why you’d insist on comprehending time law?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Ye naturally has my own reasons. If I succeed, the two of you will naturally know in the future. If I don’t succeed, it’s useless to talk about it.”

He wanted to increase the human race’s alchemy path strength with time law.

This was a sudden inspiration. Whether or not it could be realized was still hard to say. He was not willing to take it out to get laughed at.

As long as he said it, these two would definitely turn their noses up in disdain and ask him to stop dreaming.

But Wan Zhen’s gaze flickered and he said, “Looks like what Brother Ye is planning isn’t minor! Then this Wan will wish Brother Ye speedy success!”

... ...

After that day, Ye Yuan found a secluded place and laid down many large formations. Then he hid inside himself to comprehend time law.

This small piece of time law was also just a segment of time law.

But this segment was already sufficient for Ye Yuan to comprehend.

Time law was extensive and profound, extremely fleeting and ephemeral.

To the vast majority of martial artists, time was just a concept. There was no way to get started at all.

Where time was, how it operated, and how to measure it; there was no way to ascertain.

Even though Ye Yuan was considered to have learned the rudiments, it was also just a trace of sense from the unseen world. There was no way to get started with comprehending at all.

This small piece of law fragment was actually a key.

How to use this key to open time law this door, was the question that Ye Yuan needed to comprehend.

When he started comprehending the law fragment, he finally experienced the terror of time law.

That sort of feeling was like dredging for a needle in the sea.

Wanting to find an embroidery needle in the vast ocean, how difficult was that?

When he comprehended spatial law back then, that was because his Sword Dao reached the level of drawing parallels from inference, and coincidentally triggered spatial law.

Ye Yuan could continuously comprehend spatial law through Sword Dao.

But, time law was completely independent, there wasn’t the slightest area to do things in an irregular manner or be opportunistic.

Walking along the way, Ye Yuan’s comprehension of the power of laws was still smooth-sailing compared to other martial artists.

But this time, he really ran into a problem.

Time slowly trickled by, the seasons changed, spring left and autumn came.

In a blink, it was already a hundred years later.

On this day, it was the day where the God of War Golden List was announced again. The entire Primeval War Realm was astir.

“Don’t have that kid in the list. It looks like he’s still comprehending time law! What did I say? How can time law be so easy to comprehend?” Zhang Lian found Wan Zhen and said disdainfully.

Wan Zhen nodded and said, “Looks like I overestimated his talent a little! Time law is too difficult. Even if he touches Heavenly Dao, it’s likely very hard to transform it into his own Dao too.”

Heavenly Dao True Word touched Heavenly Dao, its power boundless.

But that was just guiding Heavenly Dao for their own use and not grasping the way to utilize time law.

He was interested in Ye Yuan precisely because of Heavenly Dao True Word.

Looking at it now, he had indeed somewhat overestimated Ye Yuan.

“After that kid returns, he’ll likely become the entire Cloudaid City’s laughing stock,” Zhang Lian said with a smile.

Wan Zhen gave him a glance and said coolly, “Do you think that Ye Yuan will mind? He’s someone with great willpower. So how can he possibly care about what other people think?”

... ...

Time flew like a shuttle, in a twinkle, another 200 years passed.

But merely three years had passed in the outside world.

But in Profound Secrets Heavenly Capital, a mocking voice came over.

An old man said with a disdainful look, “Profound Secrets, this is the human race’s hope that you talked about? Three consecutive seasons of God of War Golden List, he didn’t even enter the top 3000! If the human race were to rely on him, wouldn’t we all be dragged into the ditch?”
