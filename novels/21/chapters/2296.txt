Chapter 2300: Spiritlink Divine Pill, Appear!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“End spirit divine pill! End spirit South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill! My God ...”

“Looking at this quality, it should have reached peak end spirit, right?”

“Truly well-deserving of being Yun Windborne! The South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill is the taboo of Eight-star Alchemy Gods, he can actually reach peak end spirit, it simply reached the acme of perfection already!”

... ...

South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill, that was a legendary medicinal pill.

Being able to refine the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill was a form of honor in itself.

But Yun Windborne’s strength could actually refine it to the limits of peak end spirit.

Having this level of skill, one could virtually roam the Heavenspan World unhindered already.

The major powers that came to the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference, apart from ancestors, they really could not find anyone stronger than him anymore.

At the very most, it was also just being equally matched in strength with him.

People could not help casting sympathetic looks toward Ye Yuan. Yun Windborne already gave him a way out earlier, but he refused to back down no matter what, insisting on looking for abuse.

Yun Windborne looked at Ye Yuan and said with a faint smile, “Second Sage, this Yun asked you to leave earlier; it’s to respect that your talent is outstanding, and I couldn’t bear to deal a blow to your Dao heart. But, you insisted on forcing this Yun to take action, so why bother?”

When Ye Yuan heard, he could not help finding it funny.

This Yun Windborne felt that he won for sure?

Of course, it was not just him. Among everyone present, no one felt that Ye Yuan still had a chance to win.

“Deal a blow to my Dao heart? Just based on you, you’re not qualified enough yet! Don’t you forget, there’s still spiritlink above end spirit!” Ye Yuan shook his head and could not help laughing as he said.

“Spiritlink? Huhu, not that this Yun is looking down on South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill, it’s really that this step is too difficult! The alchemy powerhouses in the same generation as this Yun are at most evenly-matched in strength with this Yun too. Even for the eldest disciple under Sacred Ancestor High Priest, High Priest Shu Yan, it’s also impossible for him to refine the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill to the realm of spiritlink,” Yun Windborne said with an indifferent smile.

In his view, Ye Yuan was merely on his deathbed struggle, gilding gold onto his own face.

Spiritlink divine pills, it was not like he could not refine them.

But he could not refine it for the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill.

Refining the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill to the realm of spiritlink, it would not be successful unless ancestors take action!

But could Ye Yuan reach the strength of ancestors?

Obviously not!

“Huhu, spiritlink South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill, really never heard of it!”

“The talent is there, having an exaggerated opinion of his own abilities is also there.”

“Perhaps this is a true powerhouse. Spiritlink divine pills are merely trash in his eyes.

... ...

The words were not nice.

Everyone worshiped the strong. Yun Windborne refining the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill already became an insurmountable peak.

Hence, with Ye Yuan talking about spiritlink divine pill, that was blaspheming the peaks in their hearts.

Could peaks be scaled as and when you liked?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I already said, you’re just a junior. Don’t be conceited and guess the strength of our generation. You’re not qualified enough yet.”

Everyone’s faces revealed a strange look. Ye Yuan’s demeanor that he was behaving like a senior was really embarrassing!

Did this guy really take himself to be an ancestor?

Yun Windborne smiled and said, “Is that so? Then Second Sage, please condescend to teach.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and pointed repeatedly at the void. A mysterious and profound array formation gradually formed under his fingertips.

The array formation was very profound.

Yun Windborne was a titan of Alchemy Dao, but he did not quite understand array formations.

He only felt that the array formation was very complicated, very profound. But whether or not this array formation could refine medicinal pills, he did not know.

Most likely, it could not refine any pill.

Refining a medicinal pill like the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill with Formation Dao was simply a joke.

Without the enhancement of medicinal cauldron, without exquisite to the pinnacle fire controlling arts, just based on a grand array, you want to refine a divine pill that surpassed peak end spirit?

Nothing more than wishful thinking!

The people present all basically had this opinion.

Not that they were looking down on Ye Yuan. On the contrary, Ye Yuan’s talent truly astounded them.

It was just that the opponent was too strong!

In front of an apex existence like Yun Windborne, Ye Yuan’s talent was not worth mentioning.

No matter how high the talent, there had to be a limit.

And this limit was stopped in front of Yun Windborne, this insurmountable mountain.

No reason other than just because Yun Windborne represented the peak of Alchemy Dao.

This time, the array formation that Ye Yuan set up was more complicated than any one time.

Toward Yun Windborne this opponent, Ye Yuan could not find any problem.

He was indeed powerful!

Through the refinement just now, Ye Yuan even learned many things from him.

It was just a pity that the opponent he ran into was him.

He, Ye Yuan, was not a powerhouse pretending to be ancestor level. He was a genuine ancestor level powerhouse!

This array formation, Ye Yuan set it up for the greater part of a day.

Spiritlink divine pills represented the apex of Alchemy Dao.

So-called spiritlink, actually already touched the source of Great Dao.

Spiritlink divine pills were only a hair’s breadth away from Dao pills.

But this hair’s breadth was as far as the horizon!

There was an incomparably tough yet thin film. You could see through, but you could not touch it.

Yun Windborne, this level of powerhouse, was forever blocked outside the door of Dao pill by this thin film.

Unable to refine Dao pills, they could forever only be disciples.

No matter how strong, they were also just mortal-level strong.

Ye Yuan did not experience late-stage and grand completion Ancestor Realm, these two realms, but he directly reached the source of Alchemy Dao.

But when he turned his head back to look again, the originally incomparably complicated medicinal pills were also merely thus in front of him.

South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill, was a taboo-like existence in other people’s eyes.

But in front of him, it was merely like this. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He could make use of Formation Dao to analyze the medicinal pill bit by bit, then finish refining through Formation Dao according to the prescribed routine.

When he sent the spirit medicines into the array formation, the grand array suddenly released a dazzling light.

A power of Great Dao even stronger than when Yun Windborne refined suddenly descended, pouring into the array formation.

Everyone’s faces all changed at this instant.

“This ... Such a powerful aura of Dao! Could it be that he can really refine a spiritlink South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill? This is impossible!”

Yun Windborne’s expression finally changed drastically. The original indifference was long already replaced by shock.

Even though he had ten thousand disbeliefs that Ye Yuan could succeed in refining, logic told him that Ye Yuan really succeeded!

Reading his level of realm, how could he not understand what this terrifying aura of Dao meant?

Very soon, the array formation dissipated, the medicinal pill condensed.

A wave of aura that made people alarmed instantly spread out.

“Oppressive spiritual energy, I seem to have seen a living thing! Is ... this a spiritlink divine pill?”

“I seem to have seen the Great Dao of heaven and earth!”

“He really succeeded in refining! Just where do his limits lie?”

... ...

Everyone was dumbfounded!

Among them, the vast majority were seeing a spiritlink divine pill for the first time.

This level of medicinal pill only circulated in the hands of top powerhouses.

Even Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouses might not have seen them before too.

Many people looked toward that medicinal pill. Their eyes were red!

Envy!

The medicinal effect of a spiritlink divine pill was simply unimaginable.

“Mu Tiesheng, what are you still in a daze for?” Ye Yuan saw that Mu Tiesheng was still in a trance. So he reminded Mu Tiesheng.

Mu Tiesheng’s entire body trembled, suddenly feeling one murderous gaze after another landing on his body.
