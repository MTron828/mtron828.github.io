Chapter 2836: Your Father Will Beat You to Death!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“What did you say? You impudent brat, you actually refused to be this seat’s disciple? He’s rebelling!”

“AHHH, it’s infuriating this seat to death! Across the heavens and myriad worlds, how many geniuses want to acknowledge this seat as master, this seat didn’t even care about them. Today, I was actually rejected by a Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

“This seat is definitely going to beat him to death! Definitely going to beat him to death!”

Hearing Hegemon Pinespring’s reply, Hegemon Cloudmount was angered until he stomped with rage.

Of course, this scene was actually within Zhou Pinespring’s expectations too.

This master of his valued face the most. When accepting disciples, they absolutely had to be geniuses among geniuses. Ordinary people could not enter his sights at all.

Each of the disciples that Hegemon Cloudmount took in, they were powerhouses whose reputation shook a region.

It had always been his pride and also his capital for showing off.

Honestly speaking, the Hegemon Realm really could not be taught.

Therefore, Zhou Pinespring agreed with Ye Yuan’s words very much.

Of course, he was able to step into the Hegemon Realm. On the one hand, it was because he was amazingly talented. On the other hand, there was indeed an inseparable relationship with Hegemon Cloudmount.

Therefore, even if he had stepped into Hegemon Realm, Zhou Pinespring was still very respectful toward Hegemon Cloudmount.

Hegemon Cloudmount’s conditions for accepting disciples were extremely harsh.

Especially after him, his conditions became even more hair-raisingly harsh.

It was not unexpected. With a precious gem in front of him, Hegemon Cloudmount’s horizons became even higher.

Therefore, Hegemon Cloudmount had already not accepted disciples for more than 100 thousand years.

This time, he took Ye Yuan in as a disciple groundbreakingly, and Ye Yuan actually refused. How could his face remain intact?

“Hahaha, Old Fogey Cloudmount, I didn’t expect that you’ll have this day too. Retribution is really great!” An old voice came from inside the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Hegemon Cloudmount’s face turned black, and he said with a sneer, “Old Fogey Blacksun, stop making wisecracks here! Zhao He that dumbass can’t do it. Even if you mock me for ten thousand years, he can’t make it too! Humph!”

The moment Hegemon Blacksun heard this, he burst into fury and said, “You blind old thing, Zhao He is extremely talented. Even if you don’t take him in, he’s already a grade nine heavenly alchemist currently as well! Don’t think that this seat doesn’t know what you’re cooking. No matter how poor Zhao

He’s talent is, could it be that it can’t compare to a measly grade five heavenly alchemist?”

Hegemon Cloudmount chuckled and said, “Honestly, he really can’t compare at all! I’ve looked at the formula for the Blood of Flame Crystal. It’s absolutely a stroke of wonder! Disregarding other things, even if it’s the current Zhao He, under the circumstances that he has blood race blood essence, he

might not be able to develop it too! This boy has brilliant perception. Otherwise, do you think that this seat will really take anyone in as my disciple?”

“You! Bullsh*t!” Hegemon Blacksun was choked until he could not speak.

Hegemon Blacksun was Thundercry Continent’s hegemon, revered due to his Martial Dao.

Zhao He was Hegemon Blacksun’s descendant. He was not interested in Martial Dao, but he was very interested in Alchemy Dao.

Back then, Zhao He knelt for a month in front of Hegemon Cloudmount’s door, wanting to acknowledge Hegemon Cloudmount as his master, but Hegemon Cloudmount did not take him in too.

Later, Hegemon Blacksun moved out in person, and Hegemon Cloudmount still did not agree.

Hegemon Blacksun had always been brooding over this matter.

However, Zhao He also lived up to expectations later and cultivated to Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm, becoming a grade nine heavenly alchemist!

Hegemon Blacksun felt very relieved and even came to find Hegemon Cloudmount to show off.

But Hegemon Cloudmount turned his nose up at it and straightforwardly said that grade nine was already the limit for Zhao He. It was absolutely impossible to improve any further.

He really wanted to show off. After Zhao He stepped into Hegemon Realm, he would come and show off again!

Hegemon Blacksun got a rebuff and a stomach full of anger. After going back, he spent a great deal of effort to groom Zhao He.

But Hegemon Cloudmount seemed to have foresight. After Zhao He entered grade nine, his improvement became extremely, extremely slow.

Hegemon Blacksun spent a huge price, but the results were very weak.

This face was slapped resoundingly.

This time, seeing Hegemon Cloudmount treated this way, he naturally could not resist coming out to slap his face.

In the end, he got slapped again!

In reality, Hegemon Cloudmount stood at the apex of Alchemy Dao. His horizon was naturally not what the average person could compare to. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Zhao He was also not really a worthless thing. Otherwise, it would also have been impossible for him to step into the realm of grade nine heavenly alchemist. But that was it.

But Hegemon Cloudmount ignored the furious Hegemon Blacksun and calmed down. he asked Zhou Pinespring, “Pinespring, how do you feel after seeing this boy?”

Zhou Pinespring was silent for a moment, and he assessed, “Extraordinary!”

Hegemon Cloudmount said in surprise, “Oh? You’re actually so optimistic about him?”

He knew that this disciple of his also had extremely high horizons. He did not care about ordinary geniuses at all.

It was because he himself was a prodigy that shocked the world!

Being able to be evaluated like this by him, it could be seen that Ye Yuan’s talent was really amazing.

Zhou Pinespring nodded and said, “If not for that he’s a divergent, this disciple feels that he should be able to step into the realm of Hegemon!”

Not just Hegemon Cloudmount, the other Hegemons were shocked too.

Hegemon could not be said casually.

Often, not one Hegemon could be born in several hundreds of thousands of years too!

Across the heavens and myriad worlds, there were many Emperor Sakra Heavens. But the Hegemons were scanty few.

This step was way too difficult!

Being able to be evaluated by Zhou Pinespring like this, Ye Yuan was absolutely up to par.

But, the only thing that was a pity was that … divergent cultivator!

“Then did he reject this seat from the heart or was it intentional?” Hegemon Cloudmount suddenly asked.

This question was somewhat subjective, but Hegemon Cloudmount did not care.

In front of Zhou Pinespring this Hegemon Realm, it was impossible for the slightest fluctuation of Ye Yuan’s emotions to deceive him.

The reason that Ye Yuan gave was very ample, but actually, it was all not counted as reasons.

Hegemon Cloudmount was not an ordinary Hegemon Realm powerhouse.

In alchemy, he was the absolute authority!

Hegemon Blacksun was a super powerhouse on the same level as him, but he also acknowledged Hegemon Cloudmount’s Alchemy Dao. Otherwise, he also would not have made Zhao He enter his tutelage.

Being accepted as a disciple by this kind of overlord, that was countless people’s long cherished goal!

One had to know, even the Extreme Medicine Sect’s sect master did not have the qualifications to enter his tutelage too.

Some people liked to play petty tricks, thinking that this would make them be regarded higher.

Of course, this kind of action was just bumptious. How could they possibly deceive the visual prowess of Hegemon Realms?

Zhou Pinespring said, “This boy’s heart is loftier than the sky. Most likely … he really turns his nose up at Master! He also said that walking all the way until today, it was virtually all him comprehending Dao himself. There’s no difference … who becomes his master.”

Bang!

Absolute Heaven Barrier trembled.

Hegemon Cloudmount was enraged!

“Motherfucker! Your Father has lived to this ripe old age and haven’t met such an arrogant punk before! Your Father is already arrogant enough. This brat is even more arrogant than Your Father! Not agreeing, Your Father will go find him personally! If he still doesn’t agree, Your Father will beat him to

death!”

Whoosh!

A streak of flowing light flew out of the Absolute Heaven Barrier, heading all the way north!

Bang!

Zuo Chen smacked Ye Yuan into the ground with a slap and scolded him angrily, “Are you a pig? Such a fine opportunity, you actually don’t want it? Do you know who Hegemon Cloudmount is? Do you know how many people across the heavens and myriad worlds cry and yell about wanting to

acknowledge him as their master? Angering Your Father to death! Angering Your Father to death! Your Father will definitely beat you, this disappointing thing, to death today!”
