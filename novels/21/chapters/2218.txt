Chapter 2222: Challenging Formation

At Fiendflame Mountain, Jiu Shang Bodhidharma.

Not long before, this place was bustling and was the strongest Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda in the vicinity.

But now, Fiendflame Mountain appeared very withered.

More than a thousand years ago, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang returned, being seriously injured and did not have time to explain anything. He fell into slumber.

Now, Fiendflame Mountain was currently in a state of the mountain pass being sealed off.

In the mountains, more than ten fiend race True God Realm powerhouses were currently patrolling.

A fiend said, “Sigh, this sort of wretched days, no idea when it will come to an end!”

“Isn’t that so! Thinking about back then, how glorious was our Jiu Shang Bodhidharma? Whenever we aren’t happy, we’ll go and capture some slaves to play with from the nearby human areas. Now, we’re almost becoming cowardly turtles!”

“Heh, I heard that Lord Jiu Shang already woke up not long ago! Very soon, we’ll be back out there!”

The moment the others heard, they were immediately incomparably invigorated.

This sort of wretched days, they seriously could not stand it any longer.

“Is it true? Reiter, you mustn’t lie to us!”

Reiter chuckled and said, “Of course it’s true! Actually, Lord Jiu Shang already woke up 200 years ago, but his injuries were too severe. He could not leave the mountain for some time. I even heard that it was a human junior who inflicted those heavy wounds on him. After he recovers his strength, he’ll find that brat to settle the scores!”

“Excellent! These shitty days have finally come to an end!”

The group of fiends was currently thrilled when suddenly, several dozen black dots approached from afar, flying over towards this side.

“Humans! Hiss ... Several dozen Empyreans?! What a terrifying line-up! Q-Quickly go back and report this!” Reiter’s expression changed drastically and he turned around, wanting to flee.

But unfortunately, it was already too late.

A youth in white clothing stepped out of the void and arrived before the fiends.

Reiter’s heart shook wildly, this youth in white was not old, but the pressure he gave him was akin to lofty mountains.

Nowhere to escape, Reiter could only toughen his scalp and bow down.

“Reiter offers greetings to the human race’s Lord Empyrean!”

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and said coolly, “Where’s the entrance?”

Reiter was startled inwardly and said, “Your Excellency, our Fiendflame Mountain is already sealed off ...”

Rumble!

Ye Yuan flicked his finger, several True God Realm fiends by the side directly turned into flying ashes.

Reiter’s expression changed wildly and he said, “Y-Your Excellency, follow me.”

At this time, several dozen Empyreans tore across the sky and arrived with a howl.

A monstrous wave even surged in Reiter’s heart. These Empyreans’ strength, each and every one of their auras was incomparably powerful.

It seemed like ... the arrivals did not have good intentions!

Reiter led the group of Empyreans and arrived at the entrance area of Fiendflame Mountain.

The entire Fiendflame Mountain already activated the mountain protecting grand array, completely sealing shut the entire mountain pass gates.

People from the outside world could not enter it at all.

“Human race Empyreans, please halt! Advance any further and we’ll activate the mountain protecting grand array, and annihilate you all!”

The Empyreans had not arrived in front of the mountain pass gates yet when a warning voice came from within the grand array.

Several dozen Empyreans appearing at the same time, this commotion was seriously too big, wanting to conceal it would not even work.

Reiter cautiously sneaked a peek at Ye Yuan, feeling rather disdainful in his heart.

Fiendflame Mountain’s mountain protecting grand array was the result of Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang expending a huge price to ask a fiend race Eight-star Formation God to lay down. Its power was immense.

This grand array could even block a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, and yet this guy actually barged over so impetuously? Wasn’t this looking for a rebuff?

While talking, the mountain protecting grand array already activated, emitting waves of terrifying pressure.

The group of Empyreans that came together, each and every one of them also revealed looks of surprise.

With rank eight divine rank grand array, wouldn’t eradicating a few Empyreans be easily accomplished?

But just as everyone was in shock, Ye Yuan took a step out and directly entered the grand array without the slightest hesitation.

The Empyreans turned pale with fright and cried out in surprise, “Master Ye!”

Courting death! Reiter sneered coldly in his heart to no end.

Over at the grand array, Empyrean Cloudburst who was maintaining the array formation sneered coldly and said, “Truly a reckless and blind thing! Master Moji’s Black Goblet Sly Fiend Formation, even Lord Jiu Shang himself don’t even dare to clash head-on. A mere Empyrean actually dares to barge in!”

Finished talking, his hand-seals moved rapidly, the mountain protecting grand array started operating frenziedly.

Fiendish energy surged. A pressure that did not lose to a Heavenly Emperor suddenly descended.

Countless streaks of black light suddenly lit up and smashed over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan standing in the grand array alone appeared extremely insignificant.

The grand array surged with fiendish energy as if it had the might of heaven and earth.

That sort of feeling was like Ye Yuan standing on the shore alone, facing a tsunami that came roaring.

Empyrean Cloudburst’s gaze turned intent, and he said with a cold yell, “DIE!”

Empyrean Cloudburst was a Seven-star Formation God himself. Controlling the array formation was naturally done with high proficiency.

Such a large formation, in addition to having someone controlling it, the power could not be imagined.

The human Empyreans’ hearts leaped to their throats. This energy undulation was too terrifying.

Each ray of black light was sufficient to one-shot an Empyrean!

This was a true emperor-level grand array. This was far from what Empyreans were able to resist.

Even though they knew that Ye Yuan’s array formation was formidable, this was a rank eight divine rank grand array after all!

Bang, bang, bang ...

Countless terrifying attacks landed where Ye Yuan was standing.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly moved, taking a step.

Then, those countless berserk attacks instantly turned into nothing!

The sound of the thunder was loud, but the rain was little.

The astonishing momentum turned into smoke curling up in the air!

Empyrean Cloudburst trembled all over. His pupils constricted as he cried out in surprise, “This ... How is this possible? How does he know that that’s the formation eye? Could it be ... a coincidence?”

The human Empyreans were shocked until they broke out into a cold sweat, only then, letting out a long sigh in relief.

They discovered that they still underestimated Ye Yuan!

For Master Ye to dare challenge the formation by himself, he naturally had assurance. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, some Empyreans’ brows also furrowed together.

What was the use of Ye Yuan entering alone?

While at this time, Ye Yuan took out a divine essence stone, then pointed at the void. The divine essence stone turned into a cloud of mist and disappeared.

Following that, he took another step out, moving forward again.

Empyrean Cloudburst’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Impossible! It must be a coincidence! This Empyrean studied painstakingly for over 100 thousand years in order to fully control this set of array formation! But he only took one look and he found where the formation eye is?”

A rank eight divine rank array formation was incomparably difficult to understand, practically already touching Heaven Dao.

Even if he was a Seven-star Formation God, thoroughly controlling this set of array formations expended tremendous effort too.

Even so, he only merely controlled it too.

A rank eight divine rank array formation was not what he could comprehend at all.

Although this brat in front of him was an Empyrean, he was too young. It was simply impossible to see through the array formation with one glance.

Hence, the spells in his hands urged once more, the grand array activated once again.

The clouds and wind surged!

But, when those countless terrifying attacks landed, Ye Yuan took another diagonal stride.

All of the attacks dissipated without a trace once more!

Then, he took out a divine essence stone again and pointed at the void, turning into a cloud of mist once more.

“This ... Just who the hell is this young man?”

“No way, right? Could it be that the mountain protecting grand array actually can’t stop an Empyrean?”

“This brat wouldn’t be Master Moji’s disciple, right?”

... ...

Inside the grand array, the fiend race powerhouses were all unbelievably shocked.
