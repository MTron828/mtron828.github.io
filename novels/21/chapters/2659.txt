Chapter 2665: Subduing Big Shots!

“Isn’t that so! The exalted Head Hall Master, being a peak grade four heavenly alchemist, actually can’t even perfect a grade one heavenly pill! If it were before, no one would question anything. After all, nobody could do it as well. But now, Ye Yuan has truly achieved it. This is simply a huge irony to the two hall masters!” Cui Tong similarly shook his head and said with a sigh.

Without comparison, there would be no harm

Zhao Xun and Wu Jian came for the true grade. In the end, they did not get to see the true grade and were unable to even perfect grade one heavenly pills.

This was too ironic.

“I wonder what the two hall masters think?” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Zhao Xun looked at Ye Yuan with some disappointment and said with a bitter smile, “Looks like Fellow Daoist Ye isn’t planning on letting us see true grade!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Nay! Two hall masters misunderstood! It’s not that this Ye is intentionally making things difficult, but that to reach the realm of true grade, one must first reach ninth grade perfection. If one can’t even accomplish this step, even if I demonstrate it to you a hundred times, a thousand times, you can’t possibly comprehend it too!”

The words made everyone’s hearts turn cold.

It turned out that if you wanted to reach the realm of true grade, ninth grade perfection was the threshold!

Zhao Xun had a look of surprise on his face and said with a bitter smile, “If it were before, this hall master would definitely think that Fellow Daoist Ye is joking. But, only after putting it into practice myself, does this hall master know that wanting to reach ninth grade perfection is truly not easy!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If true grade was so easy to achieve, it also wouldn’t have gone extinct in the Land of Heavenly South. In reality, even if you reach ninth grade perfection, there’s still 108,000 miles away from the realm of true grade! This step is probably not much easier than breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.”

The expressions of Zhao Xun and the rest changed, all revealing a look of astonishment.

Ye Yuan was talking about Saint Sovereign Heaven and not Jade Sovereign Heaven!

In reality, entering Sovereign Realm from Sublime Realm was as difficult as ascending to heaven in the first place.

Otherwise, how could a genius like Jiang Li be pacing back and forth in front of the threshold for a long time?

As for Saint Sovereign Heaven, it was even hair-raisingly difficult!

Disregarding the Land of Heavenly South, even on the entire Rainclear Continent, how many Saint Sovereign Heavens were there?

This kind of difficulty simply made people despair!

However, everyone’s faces revealed disbelieving looks.

If it was so difficult, how did you break through?

Ye Yuan naturally saw through their skepticism. It was just that he was indifferent.

After they broke through to ninth grade perfection, they would naturally know how terrifying true grade was.

If Ye Yuan did not encounter an opponent like Cang Yongning, he would really need god knows how many years to take this step.

Even so, Ye Yuan only finally reached true grade after fighting fiercely for several months.

With Ye Yuan’s talent, this was simply unimaginable.

“Fellow Daoist Ye, this hall master wants to invite you to assume the post of Heavenly South Pill Hall’s Third Hall Master! In Heavenly South Pill Hall, your status will be the same as this hall master and Jian’s, wonder how you feel about it?” Zhao Xun suddenly said.

The moment these words came out, everyone was shocked.

This was a great courtesy to Ye Yuan.

Although they all knew that Ye Yuan was an extremely monstrous person, he was just a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum after all.

Assuming the post of third hall master all of a sudden, it could be said to be suddenly becoming an existence that was not inferior to Heavenly South City Lord!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since Head Hall Master has such sincerity, this Ye will naturally comply with your wishes.”

The moment Zhao Xun heard, he could not help being overjoyed!

… …

The news of Heavenly South Pill Hall welcoming a new hall master spread in Heavenly South City very quickly.

And in order to welcome Ye Yuan, Zhao Zhao planned to hold a grand welcoming ceremony for him and announce it to the entire Heavenly South.

Similar treatment was only given last time when Wu Jian ascended to peak grade four heavenly alchemist back then.

For some time, Heavenly South City was in a stir.

However, after Ye Yuan arrived in Heavenly South City, he was very low-key.

It was not that he was intentionally keeping a low profile, but that Zhao Xun and Wu Jian two people came to him every day to seek advice.

Although Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was low, his horizons were much further than the two. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Coupled with the contrast when he was battling in alchemy with Cang Yongning, the pros of cons during the process of a heavenly alchemist’s pill refinement could be seen even more clearly.

In reality, when testing the two in Calm South City back then, Ye Yuan had long already taken it into his eyes.

Ye Yuan did not hoard anything and imparted the basic cultivation method to the two people, and dissected their questions about the process of pill refinement little by little.

In merely half a month’s time, these two people became enlightened at once.

It was also even more because of so, that they finally understood that wanting to reach ninth grade perfection was a colossal project and could not be achieved in a short time.

Firstly, they had to rebuild their foundations.

Secondly, they had to make good omissions and deficiencies.

Only then were they capable of reaching ninth grade perfection!

Zhao Xun and Wu Jian’s alchemy path foundation could be rated as solid.

It was absolutely no coincidence to be able to reach this step.

But, compared to the likes of Ye Yuan and Cang Yongning, the disparity was too great.

Under Ye Yuan’s guidance, these two people could practically perceive their improvement every day.

“I didn’t expect that the millimeter of difference between upper ninth grade and ninth grade perfection is akin to heaven and earth! This hall master’s ripe old age has really been an utter waste of living!” Zhao Xun suddenly said to Ye Yuan with vicissitudes of emotion.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The path of alchemy is heterogeneous and vast, like a skyscraper. If the foundation isn’t solid, it will be akin to an ivory tower. The taller the tower, the more dangerous it is!”

Zhao Xun nodded and said, “What Fellow Daoist Ye said is extremely right! These few days, although this hall master has been studying grade one and two basic heavenly pills, I feel that the strength of grade four heavenly pills has been improving too. Only then did I understand that it turns out when I was cultivating back then, there were still so many areas that I missed out! Fellow Daoist Ye, if not for your cultivation realm being too low, this hall master will probably cause a shock in Heavenly South. This Heavenly South Pill Hall’s Head Hall Master should be assumed by you!”

Actually, Zhao Xun had long already treated Ye Yuan as half a teacher in his heart.

It was just that due to cultivation realm and status, he could not say it explicitly.

But he was very humble in front of Ye Yuan.

Heavenly alchemists were a bunch of fanatics who were the most convinced by the strong who were capable.

Ye Yuan had long already used his strength to conquer these two great hall masters.

But currently, there were indeed undercurrents surging in Heavenly South City.

Heavenly South City was the capital city of the Land of Heavenly South. It occupied a vast area and there were many experts in the city. The factions were also complicated and confusing.

Currently, inside a secret residence somewhere in Heavenly South, a group of heavyweights was currently gathering.

“Family Head Min, this position of third hall master should have originally been yours. In the end, now, a puny little grade two heavenly alchemist climbed on top of your Min Family’s head,” Deputy City Lord Ironcore said.

Min Nanshan, from one of Heavenly South City’s three great alchemy families, was the Min Family’s family head.

Heavenly South City had three great alchemy families whose strength was incomparably powerful.

The appearance of Heavenly South Pill Hall’s third hall master meant that Heavenly South City’s situation henceforth would change. It was not up to these family heads to not pay attention to it.

Min Nanshan looked at Ironcore and said with a cold smile, “Deputy City Lord Ironcore, you gathering the few of us families here is no more than to make use of us to avenge your enmity! Could it be that the few of us are decrepit and muddle-headed until we can’t even see this?”

But Ironcore did not care and said with a smile, “But didn’t you guys come too? Now, our interests are the same; that is that we can’t let this boy become the third hall master!”
