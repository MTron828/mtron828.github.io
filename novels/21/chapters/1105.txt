Chapter 1109: You Tricked Me!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Clearly, the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo had already reached the brink of eruption.

Ye Yuan’s insincere promise already made him lose the last of his patience.

However, Ye Yuan did not care about his attitude and just said with a faint smile, “Senior, don’t get angry first. Even if you kill me, there’s no benefit to you either. But if you let me go, within 10 years, I’ll definitely offer up the Five-Colored Evergrowing Soil. This transaction, I wonder how Senior feels about it?”

The Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo said solemnly, “That brat’s strength is evenly-matched with me. Back then, the three of us also expended considerable strength before repelling him. Just the likes of you, a brat whose hair isn’t even fully grown, also dare to say this sort of big talk? Aren’t you afraid of your teeth falling out?”

“Don’t bully a young man for being poor, Senior! How would you know that after 10 years, I won’t be Zhuge Qingxuan’s match 1 ?”

Ye Yuan had a calm look. What exuded was thick confidence.

He admitted that Zhuge Qingxuan was strong, very strong. He could even be said to be the Divine Realm’s number one person.

But Ye Yuan had faith to catch up within 10 years, even surpass him!

With the Vast Heaven Stone Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl, if Ye Yuan could not even surpass Zhuge Qingxuan, then he, this son of heaven’s mandate, was also too useless.

Seeing that composed look of Ye Yuan’s, no idea why, the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo actually believe Ye Yuan for that split second.

Because the confidence that Ye Yuan showed was completely different from that sort of wild arrogance.

That was the confidence belonging to a powerhouse!

Every world-shocking powerhouse would have this kind of calm confidence.

“Humph! Talk is cheap! I want to see what kind of means you have to dare say this sort of big talk! I’ll use 50% power to unleash a move. If you can resist it, what’s the harm in promising you?” said the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan said self-assuredly, “Senior, go ahead and make your move!”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s relaxed appearance, the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo could not help being suspicious.

But he was a peerless powerhouse at any rate. He naturally would not show leniency because of this hint of suspicion.

A powerhouse like him, even if it was just 50% power, it was also not what ordinary Void Mystic powerhouses could withstand.

Using 50% strength was plenty to effortlessly cut down Zhao Lingdong, this class of powerhouse.

In the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo’s view, even if Ye Yuan had a divine artifact, it was absolutely impossible to block this blow of his either.

The Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo seriously could not figure out just where this confidence of Ye Yuan’s originated from!

Only to see the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo slowly reach a finger out. All of a sudden, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky, akin to the might of heavenly tribulation.

“Lightning of Punishment!” the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo slowly spat these three words out of his mouth.

Although it was just 50% power, the might of this bolt of lightning was a hundred times as powerful as Ye Yuan’s heavenly tribulation back then!

When Ye Yuan saw that finger, his gaze contracted too.

If 50% power had such might, then wouldn’t 100% power have the ability to destroy the world?

The fame of the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo was indeed well-deserving.

Quick as thought.

In a blink of an eye, this bolt of lightning descended from the sky, smiting right for Ye Yuan!

But no idea when, Ye Yuan’s hand actually had an additional wooden stick.

The Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo was rather satisfied with this Lightning of Punishment move of his, just nice taking it easy, wanting to see how Ye Yuan would respond.

But when he saw that wooden stick in Ye Yuan’s hands, his expression could not help changing drastically.

“Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood! This boy actually has Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood!” the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo exclaimed in shock.

A hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, directly sticking the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood in his hand into the dirt.

That terrifying bolt of lightning landed straight for the top of Ye Yuan’s head. But just as it was about to land on Ye Yuan, it actually deviated a tiny but bizarrely, landing on the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Buzz ...

No earth-shaking exploding sounds transmitted over, but the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood erupted with rays of brilliant light, seemingly incomparably joyful.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Many thanks to Senior for bestowing lightning! My Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood just happened to be on the verge of breaking through. With senior’s lightning, breaking through to middle-stage Tier 9 should be sufficient.”

The last time Ye Yuan transcended tribulation, the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood similarly absorbed large quantities of source power, successfully breaking through to Tier 9.

But just earlier, when the Lightning of Punishment was just about to smite Ye Yuan, the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood absorbed it over instantly, greedily absorbing the power of lightning.

The Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo was a heaven and earth spiritual plant with an extremely powerful lightning attribute. His cultivation realm was far greater than the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood.

Even though it was just a careless attack of the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo, the energy undulations contained within was extremely powerful.

The Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood had long reached the boundary of breakthrough already. With this bolt of lightning, it broke through to middle-stage Tier 9 very quickly.

“Boy, you tricked me!” the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo said with a black face.

He completely did not think that Ye Yuan actually still had such a trump card.

If Ye Yuan had other treasures, the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo had sufficient confidence to directly shatter it using that attack earlier. Even a divine artifact would not cut it either.

But, only the similarly heaven and earth spiritual plant, the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood, could fully absorb his lightning powers!

Because this bolt of lightning was not some heaven-defying attack to the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood. It was the best nourishment.

It was also precisely because of so that Ye Yuan dared to agree to accept the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo’s conditions.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “I didn’t say anything. It was Senior yourself who wanted to test junior’s strength. Moreover, senior also didn’t say that can’t use Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood, right?”

The Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo could not help choking up and was actually at a loss for words.

He felt that he had completely fallen into the trap that Ye Yuan set up.

Looks like this brat had been setting up a trap for him from the very beginning.

If he had long known that it would be like this, might as well directly smite him down the moment he came up. Save the nonsense too.

Although this attack earlier was absorbed by the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood, it still did not mean that Ye Yuan was really immune to the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo.

Earlier, Ye Yuan was scheming against the unwary, only taking out the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood at the last second, resulting in the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo not having time to react at all.

The Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo also had feelings of belittlement towards Ye Yuan. That was why he resulted in such an outcome.

If he unleashed that blow earlier with full power, even with the origin magnetic field, Ye Yuan would have to suffer serious injuries too.

“Hahaha, purple bamboo, you can’t even take care of a little baby, how disgraceful!”

At this time, a voice suddenly transmitted out from within the void, laughing wildly.

A massive figure slowly walked out from within the void. This gigantic figure looked rather like a bull, but it only had one horn.

Ye Yuan practically determined at the first moment, that this should be the Single-Horned Moyun Beast of the Three Great Kings.

When the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo heard this laughter, his face turned black to the extreme.

Ye Yuan lost all of his face with this.

“Squeak squeak, really making your Grandpa Rat die of laughter! An exalted king was actually tricked by a human child.”

Another voice sounded out. A giant rat scurried out from underground and laughed mockingly at the Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo.

Ye Yuan could not help despairing in his heart. The sixth level’s three great kings actually gathered together all at once!

A Heavenly Thunder Purple Bamboo was already extremely hard to deal with. Three appearing all of a sudden, how could he escape?

Ye Yuan’s thoughts flashed like lightning, racking his brain hard for a strategy to escape.
