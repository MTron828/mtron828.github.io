Chapter 2040: Structure Changes

The furnace had yet to be opened, but everyone already had an idea about the results in their hearts.

Before this, no one would feel that Ye Yuan could really defeat all of the Seven-star Alchemy Gods and sit on the seat of grandmaster.

But now, Ye Yuan used his fearsome strength to refresh everyone’s understanding.

“He ... He really did it! Truly inconceivable! A Six-star Alchemy God actually swept across all the Seven-star Alchemy Gods!”

“If Empyrean Pilljade doesn’t make a move, there’s likely no one who can do anything to him in this land of Southern Border, right?”

“Truly terrifying talent! Could it be that this Heavenspan World is really going to produce a second Medicine Ancestor?”

...

Recalling the scenes of Ye Yuan battling in alchemy, everyone still felt like they were dreaming.

That was not some new rising Alchemy Dao star, he was already standing at the summit of the Southern Border’s alchemy world!

Surpassing Empyrean Pilljade was likely just a matter of a twinkling of an eye.

No one doubted that Ye Yuan would step into Ancestor Realm!

Ancestor Realm required countless years of accumulation to others. But to Ye Yuan, it did not seem distant.

Didn’t he also just spend more than a short thousand years’ time to reach this step today?

In the crowd, Yun Yi’s face was full of a bitter smile.

When he heard that Ye Yuan was this season’s Cloudpill Summit’s grandmaster, his first reaction was refusing to accept it.

He, Yun Yi, was Empyrean Pilljade’s great-grandson. His alchemy talent was unparalleled. He only used 3000 years and broke through to the Dao Realm.

Even those Dao Realm geniuses in the Cloudpill Summit this time also used at least 5000 years and above.

All geniuses paled in comparison in front of him.

He believed that the day would come when he would be able to reach Empyrean Pilljade’s height and become the apex of this Southern Border.

But all this pride was crushed into smithereens in front of Ye Yuan.

In front of Ye Yuan, what did Empyrean Pilljade count for?

Those geniuses who had once attempted to challenge Ye Yuan had even more shameful looks because of their unworthiness.

Ye Yuan was not using Ning Siyu as a shield at all. He was really disdainful to take action against juniors.

That was an insult to a grandmaster!

Would Empyrean Pilljade, Empyrean Flutterfeather, Empyrean Chaoyuan, these people, accept the challenge of a junior?

Obviously not!

Ye Yuan’s maidservant, Ning Siyu, was the one in the same generation as them.

While Ye Yuan was a big shot on equal footing with the Southern Border’s pinnacle-most alchemy masters!

“Brother Pilljade, I wonder if this Ye has the qualification to sit in this grandmaster seat now?” Ye Yuan looked at Empyrean Pilljade and said nonchalantly.

Empyrean Pilljade had an awkward look. Forcefully squeezing out a smile, he said, “Of course you’re qualified! Grandmaster Ye really broadened this Empyrean’s horizons today!”

Under the watchful gazes of the people, Ye Yuan slowly sat on the grandmaster seat.

While at this time, his seat was already arranged next to Empyrean Flutterfeather.

Clearly, this represented that his status already towered above the other five great holy lands’ masters!

In the plaza, all gazes were focused on Ye Yuan.

What kind of glory was this!

After Ye Yuan took his seat, Empyrean Pilljade appeared slightly embarrassed as he said, “Cough, cough, Grandmaster Ye’s title is fully deserving. Since Grandmaster Ye has proved his strength, then the Cloudpill Summit this time will officially ...”

“Wait a minute!” Right at this time, Empyrean Flutterfeather suddenly opened his mouth and interrupted Empyrean Pilljade’s words.

Empyrean Pilljade’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Is there something else, Younger Brother Flutterfeather?”

Empyrean Flutterfeather said with a faint smile, “Since this Cloudpill Summit is so lively, why don’t we let it a little livelier? I wonder what’s your opinion, Brother Pilljade?”

Empyrean Pilljade smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “Your words, are you challenging this Empyrean?”

Empyrean Flutterfeather said with a faint smile, “It’s impolite not to reciprocate since Brother Pilljade questioned this Empyrean’s sincerity toward the Cloudpill Summit. Due to this, I, Flutterfeather, naturally have to seek justice for Ye Yuan. Does Brother Pilljade dare to have a battle?”

Talking until the back, the aura on Empyrean Flutterfeather’s body suddenly erupted, like a sharp sword that was about to be drawn; not revealing the sharp edge, but the sharp sword suspending high above carried a powerful confidence of who but myself could do it?

Empyrean Pilljade chuckled and said, “In this land of Southern Border, no idea how many years it has been since anyone has challenged this Empyrean. Fine, as you wish!”

The plaza burst into an uproar!

Empyrean Flutterfeather was actually going to challenge the Southern Border’s kind, Empyrean Pilljade!

Who did not know that Empyrean Pilljade was the only Ancestor Realm powerhouse among the Southern Border’s Seven-star Alchemy Gods?

Where did Empyrean Flutterfeather get the guts?

The Empyreans present also had surprised faces, clearly not expecting that Empyrean Flutterfeather was so resolute.

He was clearly standing up for Ye Yuan. But was he Empyrean Pilljade’s match?

Everyone knew that Empyrean Flutterfeather was a rising star, and he was also once the Southern Border’s number one genius, his light dazzling.

But for so many years, Empyrean Flutterfeather had always been suppressed by Empyrean Pilljade.

As for why, everyone had an idea in their hearts.

Empyrean Pilljade felt threatened!

Suddenly, everyone thought of a possibility. Each and every one of them opened their eyes wide, their faces full of disbelief.

Could it be that this Southern Border’s alchemy world was going to change rulers?

Empyrean Flutterfeather said with a faint smile, “Brother Pilljade agreeing so readily, don’t forget our Southern Border Alliance’s agreement!”

Empyrean Pilljade’s face changed and he said with a cold smile, “Even if you really broke through to Ancestor Realm, would this Empyrean lose to you?”

Empyrean Flutterfeather said coolly, “Talk is cheap. Let’s showcase our true abilities!”

Finished talking, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s figure leaped, landing on the ring.

Empyrean Pilljade gave a cold snort, striding with his hands behind his back, and similarly landing in the ring. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Don’t say that this Empyrean is bullying you. You decide the medicinal pill!” Empyrean Pilljade said with a proud look.

As the Southern Border’s number one person, Empyrean Pilljade had his pride.

Empyrean Flutterfeather said, “Heavenly Center Nine Lives Pill then!”

Empyrean Pilljade’s pupils constricted and he said, “You indeed broke through?”

The refining difficulty of rank seven divine pills was tremendous. Without Dao Realm strength, one could basically only refine level one or two medicinal pills.

And level nine and above medicinal pill, without Ancestor Realm strength, it could not be refined at all.

This Heavenly Center Nine Lives Pill was a kind of level nine medicinal pill!

Empyrean Flutterfeather choosing this medicinal pill clearly showed that he already stepped into the Ancestor Realm!

“Huhu, speaking of which, this still have to thank Younger Brother Ye. Without him, I’m afraid that it will be difficult to break through even if given another 100 thousand years too!” Empyrean Flutterfeather said with a smile.

“What? Empyrean Flutterfeather really stepped into the Ancestor Realm? Then doesn’t this mean that a second Ancestor Realm powerhouse appeared in our Southern Border?”

“Empyrean Flutterfeather stepping into Ancestor Realm is actually related to Ye Yuan!”

“My God, why is this Ye Yuan so monstrous? An Ancestor Realm, a half-step Ancestor Realm, looks like this Southern Border alchemy world’s structure is really going to change.”

...

Hearing this news, the plaza broke out into a commotion!

The Myriad Treasure Tower suddenly having an additional Ancestor Realm and a quasi-Ancestor Realm, their alchemy strength would soar greatly.

This Southern Border alchemy world was no longer the Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s world.

What surprised people, even more, was that Empyrean Flutterfeather breaking through to the Ancestor Realm was actually because of Ye Yuan.

It could be said that Ye Yuan made the Southern Border completely change rules with his power alone!

Empyrean Pilljade gave a cold snort and said, “Even if you broke through to the Ancestor Realm, you also merely just entered the Ancestor Realm. Do you really think that you’ve cornered this Empyrean? This Empyrean will let you take a look at the true strength of the Ancestor Realm!”
