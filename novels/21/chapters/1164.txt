Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Yuan, these people are already devilfied and won’t have the slightest bit of feelings towards you at all! If you continue to be sympathetic, the one who dies in the end will be you!”

Long Teng’s voice sounded beside Ye Yuan’s ear.

“Senior ... could it be that ... there’s really no way of saving them?”

“None! Once devilfied, their outcome is only death! Even if you don’t kill them now, when you kill their master, they still have to die!” Long Teng said with the decisiveness that could chop metal.

Ye Yuan let out a slight sigh and said, “Fine then, I got it.”

Wisps of divine essence quietly entered the Evil Extermination Sword.

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan’s sword energy skyrocketed!

Those sword lights emitted by the sword formation were actually directly crushed by Ye Yuan’s sword energy.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.

Streaks of invisible sword energy were emitted from the Evil Extermination Sword, causing Ye Yuan’s defensive circle to grow larger and larger.

Seeing this scene, Ji Canglan and Bloodsoul’s expression both changed greatly.

“Not good! This brat actually held back strength! Looks like he only couldn’t bear to kill his former fellow disciples just now, and that’s why he was suppressed by the sword formation,” Bloodsoul said with an ugly expression.

Ji Canglan’s gaze stared at the Ye Yuan inside the sword formation with a glimmer as he gritted his teeth and said, “He already cultivated the Evil Extermination Sword Formula to the first level’s great circle of perfection realm. The Evil Extermination Divine Sword’s might is already capable of unleashing 10% of its power!”

“Such terrifying comprehension abilities! He obtained the Evil Extermination Sword Formula for at most one year plus ago, right? In just over one year, he comprehended Divine Dao laws to such an extent!” Bloodsoul said in shock.

“The son of heaven’s mandate is indeed extraordinary! This group of trash couldn’t come in handy as expected. Bloodsoul, time for you all to strike!” Ji Canglan said in a solemn voice. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Yes, Lord Holy Son!” Bloodsoul voiced his assent and left.

Ji Canglan looked at the Ye Yuan inside the battle ring, gaze glinting. It was also uncertain what he was thinking about.

At this time, Ye Yuan turned the sword hilt. A spiral-shaped sword energy spouted out, akin to boring into rocks, directly penetrating the sword lights that came from the sword formation.

Puchi!

The sword energy coming off the Evil Extermination Divine Sword passed through a peak void mystic’s chest without the least bit of hindrance.

This person was the Medicine King Hall’s former reclusive grand elder. His strength was even a notch greater than Sun Man.

Even though Ye Yuan did not have much contact with him, he also knew that he was a kindly senior.

The previous life’s Ye Yuan, even though he focused on Alchemy Dao, toward his fellow disciples, he had never put on the airs of a young patriarch before.

Therefore, among these fellow disciples, Ye Yuan’s popularity was still rather high.

Ye Yuan’s relationship with these people before his eyes was also very harmonious.

But now, he had to personally end these people’s lives. Ye Yuan was still very uncomfortable in his heart.

It only stood to reason that he hated Ji Canglan even deeper to the core!

This guy completely had no bottom line when doing things!

Following this grand elder’s death, the Nine Consummate God Killing Sword Formation’s power naturally became greatly discounted.

Those sword lights were completely unable to break through the 20 feet area in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan sighed lightly and said, “Sorry, everyone! Qingyun is useless and is powerless to save the situation! Qingyun will send you all on your way here. This grudge, Qingyun will definitely help you all to avenge!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure instantly vanished.

Then, one figure after another fell down from the sky.

A hundred powerhouses were slaughtered clean by Ye Yuan very quickly.

Looking at the corpses all over the floor, Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “I’m an alchemy emperor in vain and couldn’t save my fellow disciples. Ji Canglan, our grudge is getting bigger and bigger!”

Ye Yuan knew that if he did not kill these people, they would come and deal with him to no end.

Seeing this sight, Ji Canglan’s eyes also turned slightly intent as he murmured, “This brat matured quite a bit these few years! I even thought that some old familiar faces are able to cause some hindrance to him. I didn’t think that ... he didn’t even bat an eyelid.”

“Ji Canglan, you’ve lost all of your conscience and will die a horrible death!” Ye Yuan looked at Ji Canglan and said in a cold voice.

Ji Canglan smiled and said, “Lost all my conscience? I’m of the fiend race. Don’t you think that it’s laughable to say this kind of words to a fiend? As long as we occupy this Divine Realm, we ... are the heavens! Rather, you personally killed these seniors of the same sect who had once groomed you before. Don’t you have any shame at all? Even if they became fiend slaves, they are at least still alive. But now, even their qualifications to carry on living was personally ended by you!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed. Clearly, he wavered due to Ji Canglan’s sentence.

Toward enemies, Ye Yuan had always been decisive in going for the kill. He would not even bat an eyelid.

But towards the people around him, Ye Yuan had always felt tied down.

Even if these people became fiend slaves.

But right at this time, warning bells suddenly sounded in Ye Yuan’s mind!

Countless blood beads came out from within the void and actually already thoroughly surrounded him unknowingly!

The current Ye Yuan seemed to have fallen into the encirclement of countless land mines. It was as if ... there was already nowhere to hide.

Puu, puu, puu ...

Those blood beads all exploded in an instant!

In an instantly, blood rain sprayed everywhere!

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he instinctively executed greater teleportation.

However, it was still too late!

Some blood beads tainted his Evil Extermination Divine Sword.

There were even some that splashed on him!

Ye Yuan’s clothes and skin could not cause the slightest hindrance to these blood beads.

Once they landed on Ye Yuan’s body, it actually encroached within Ye Yuan’s body.

Ye Yuan’s alarm was by no means insignificant. He hurriedly investigated the change within his body, and his expression could not help changing drastically!

After these blood beads entered the body, they turned into a tuft of blood-red color mist, enveloping Ye Yuan’s essence energy sea.

Ye Yuan revolved essence energy and actually had an intermittent feeling of sluggishness!

Looking at the Evil Extermination Sword again, those blood beads disappeared too. Clearly, it had also corroded to the insides of the Evil Extermination Sword!

Ye Yuan discovered that the power of the Evil Extermination sword seemed to be greatly reduced!

What the hell was those blood beads?

Looking at this scene, Ji Canglan burst into laughter and said, “My good junior brother, you’re too careless!”

After those blood beads exploded, the entire stretch of the sky seemed to be smeared a scarlet red color, looking exceedingly horrifying.

“Hahaha!”

Four figures walked out from within the void, their face having a mocking look.

“Ji Qingyun, the taste of these God Corrupting Blood Beads is still pretty good, right?”

“Stop struggling. These God Corrupting Blood Beads can defile myriad life under the heavens! As long as stained by a tiny bit, your essence energy will be defiled, unable to be used at all.”

“Also, under this stretch of sky, the four of our combat power will increase one-fifth! While you will weaken by one-fifth!”

“Ji Qingyun, you’re indeed powerful, too bad that you’re ... too foolish! Those good-for-nothings were completely useless. If they died, then they died. You actually even had compassion for them. But speaking of which, for them to be able to confuse your mind, it’s also considered putting materials to good use. Now that you’re going to die too, do you think ... they will be moved or not? Hahaha ...”

These four people were precisely four out of the six great protectors under Ji Canglan!
