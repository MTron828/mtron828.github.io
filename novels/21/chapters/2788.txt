Chapter 2794: True Sovereign Heaven Descends!

“Brother Yang, kill!”

Above the void, Ye Yuan suddenly shouted.

Behind him, the army that was chasing them suddenly stopped.

Ye Yuan two people did not have the intention of turning back at all. They fled even faster instead.

Only then did Whalebillow and the rest shout, realizing that they were fooled. Each and every one of their faces reddened to the ears with anger.

“Punk who’s surnamed Ye, Your Father is going to tear you to pieces!”

“Motherfucker! You’ll give birth to a son without an anus!”

“Boy, no matter how big a price we pay today, we’ll make you stay!”

… …

From behind came an exasperated voice.

Ever since Yang Qing joined, Ye Yuan two people could attack when they advanced and could defend if they retreated, toying with all the pursuing troops in the palm of their hands.

And this situation also thoroughly enraged the sea race.

Before, Whalebillow they all were worried about casualties. But now, they were not worried anymore. The Qian Kui Sea Region directly sent a sea race army over.

At this time, it was densely packed with seafolks above the void. Ye Yuan two people could not kill them entirely.

Although these seafolks were not opponents that could last one exchange with them, they could stop Ye Yuan two people’s movements.

“Hahaha,?refreshing! Refreshing! Haven’t killed so refreshingly for a long time! Brother Ye, I have to thank you!” Yang Qing’s long spear danced seamlessly until not even wind could penetrate as he let out a loud laugh and said.

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes.?Are you confused about the situation?

We can’t escape!

Suddenly, his mind stirred, and he shouted loudly, “Stop chasing! Keep chasing and I’m going to transcend my tribulation!”

“Stop! Don’t chase anymore!” The figures of Whalebillow and the others suddenly stopped. They actually really stopped chasing.

Ye Yuan and Yang Qing two people were taken aback. So obedient?

But very soon, they discovered that something was not right.

These people’s faces had an extremely respectful look.

Ye Yuan and Yang Qing exchanged glances, their expressions changing drastically.

“Oh?no! You’re going to get me killed!’ Yang Qing cried out strangely.

The void trembled, and an imposing aura like a sovereign that descended upon the world emerged from the void.

A figure stepped out of the void, akin to a god descending upon the world.

“Paying respects to Sovereign Qian Kui!”

Everyone bowed collectively.

In these few great sea regions, True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were absolutely invincible existences, paramount existences.

A True Sovereign Heaven finally appeared!

Ye Yuan two people stopped running. With a True Sovereign Heaven descending, they could not run away anymore.

Sovereign Qian Kui turned into human form, like a king of the world.

His eyes were locked on Ye Yuan as if he was looking at a dead person.

“Subordinate is incompetent, making sovereign appear in person! Sovereign, please punish!” Whalebillow and the rest were in fear and trepidation, directly kneeling down and admitting fault.

The Qian Kui Sea Region swarmed out in full force just to hunt down one person.

In the end, the person failed to be killed, but they suffered heavy losses.

They had been hunting Ye Yuan for more than half a month, but two of the five great war generals fell, and nine grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens perished!

As for Jade Sovereign Heaven and Limitless Sublime Heaven seafolks, the casualties were countless.

And Ye Yuan was still alive and well now, without any injuries at all.

Whalebillow this group of people were almost vomiting blood.

“Humph!?A bunch of trash!” Sovereign Qian Kui gave a cold snort, Whalebillow and the others were directly shocked into vomiting blood.

Ye Yuan and Yang Qing felt a great pressure too.

Too strong!

One sentence injured a transformation powerhouse.

“True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses perform Dao techniques naturally. Every movement carries the might of Great Dao, as expected!” Ye Yuan said with a solemn expression.

Just now, this cold yell of Sovereign Qian Kui’s caused Great Dao to fluctuate. Ye Yuan could feel it clearly.

He had faced-off against Yan Jadetrue before, but that was just a half-baked True Sovereign Heaven.

This one in front of him now was a true-blue True Sovereign Heaven!

“Dead for sure now! Brother Ye, you’ve harmed me terribly! What to do? What to do?” Yang Qing said in a panic.

Ye Yuan could not resist rolling his eyes and said, “Weren’t you still killing happily just now? Asked you to leave early on, you refused to go. Now, you’re blaming me?”

Yang Qing was taken aback and said,?“Uh,?seems like it! That … Lord Sovereign, the person that you want to kill is him. I don’t know him! I’m just an ant that’s passing by. Treat me as a fart and let me go?”

The desire to live was so strong!

Yang Qing turned his face, wagging his tail and begging for pity shamelessly.

That appearance was totally that of a sycophant. Ye Yuan was dumbfounded from watching.

This guy, when he was killing just now, he had an appearance like he was invincible.

Now, he actually changed face so quickly.

“Hahaha?… Qian Kui, your Qian Kui Sea Region emerged from your nest in full force and couldn’t even take care of a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven. It’s too embarrassing, right?”

Suddenly, a burst of loud laughter suddenly sounded out.

Above the void, another three terrifying auras suddenly descended.

These three people’s auras were not the least bit weaker than Sovereign Qian Kui!

The kings of the four great sea regions had actually all arrived!

Ye Yuan and Yang Qing’s faces changed wildly. Now, there was really nowhere to run.

It was absolutely impossible to escape from the hands of four great True Sovereign Heavens.

The muscles on Yang Qing’s face were already spasming.

Another True Sovereign Heaven said with a laugh, “Qian Kui, I even thought that you died under the true sovereign Dao tribulation. I was prepared to come to take over the Qian Kui Sea Region.”

The third True Sovereign Heaven said with a smile, “Qian Kui, you’d better go and overcome the true sovereign Dao tribulation with peace of mind. This sovereign will help you take care of Qian Kui Sea Region’s awful mess.”

Sovereign Qian Kui snorted coldly and said, “Hollowdark, Sardine, Tian Hui, the three of you stop making wisecracks here! Quite a few of your people died too! If this punk appeared in your sea regions, can you all resist? Didn’t you guys come to kill this brat too?”

Hollowdark was indifferent, looking at Ye Yuan as he said with a smile, “Kid, your face is really big, to actually provoke us four great True Sovereign Heavens to take action!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said helplessly, “I didn’t want to either. Previously, this Ye was holding back in all aspects. It was Qian Kui Sea Region’s people who pressed people too far.”

Qian Kui snorted coldly and said, “Boy, you’re still stubborn when death is imminent!”

But Hollowdark laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… A little interesting! Still able to be so calm when seeing the few of us. Kid, this sovereign gives you a chance. Seek refuge with our Ding Xiang Sea Region. This sovereign will protect your life!”

Before Ye Yuan could speak, Yang Qing hurriedly said, “Lord Sovereign, I’m willing to defect! I’m called Yang Qing. I’m very strong too!”

Ye Yuan was speechless.

This guy immediately became thick-skinned.

Hollowdark had a smile that was not a smile as he said, “Sure, your strength is very strong too. You’re qualified to take refuge with this sovereign! What about you, kid?”

Qian Kui snorted coldly and said, “Hollowdark, are you going to war with this sovereign?”

Hollowdark said smugly, “So what if I am? You’re at the critical juncture of transcending the true sovereign Dao tribulation right now. Could it be that you dare to make a move against this sovereign? Once you bring down the true sovereign Dao tribulation, you’ll probably die without a burial ground!”

Qian Kui’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

However, what Hollowdark said was also true.

It was already his fourth true sovereign Dao tribulation. It was incomparably dangerous. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A single misstep and he would really die, his Dao dissipating.

At this time, it was not appropriate to take action.

“Very good, Hollowdark, this sovereign has remembered you! After this sovereign transcends the true sovereign Dao tribulation this time, you’re going to get it!” Sovereign Qian Kui said in extreme fury.

But Hollowdark ignored him.. Looking at Ye Yuan, he said with a smile, “Kid, have you thought it over?”
