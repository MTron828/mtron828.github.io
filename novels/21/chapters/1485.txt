Chapter 1489 Already Came, Leaving for What?

“Your Highness Ka Xin, please wait!”

Ka Xin brought Lian Huo and just entered the Fiend Medicine Hall when he was stopped by a One-star Fiend Apothecary.

Although Ka Xin’s status in the capital city was very high, in the Fiend Medicine Hall, he did not dare to be unbridled too.

“Ah, Brother Lu He. I made an appointment with Lord Meng Qi ten days ago. There are some important matters to discuss with him,” Ka Xin cupped his fists and said.

Even though the other party was just a One-star Fiend Apothecary, he was Lord Meng Qi’s accomplished disciple. Ordinary people could not afford to offend.

Lu He said, “Apologies, Your Highness Ka Xin. Master he’s currently meeting an important guest in the inner-hall and has already instructed, nobody is to disturb him!”

Ka Xin frowned and said, “Even I’m not an exception too? I’m here representing the City Lord Manor, this matter is likewise no trivial matter! Moreover, I’ve already made an appointment ten days ago.”

“This ...”

Lu He’s face revealed a difficult look. Ka Xin’s status was indeed extraordinary.

Moreover, Ka Xin was not here representing himself. He was representing the City Lord Manor.

Although the Blood Yama Hall did not fear the City Lord Manor, face still had to be given.

“Why not ... Better trouble Brother Lu He to go and pass on a word. Presumably, Lord Meng Qi won’t dismiss me,” Ka Xin said with clasped hands.

Lu He thought about it, nodded, and said, “Alright then, I’ll go and ask Master.”

Lu He turned around and went in. Lian Hua smiled and said, “Wonder what kind of big shot Lord Meng Qi is seeing, to actually even ignore our affairs.”

Ka Xin smiled and said, “To be able to refuse us outside the door, it must be an incredible major figure. I reckon that it might very likely be a Three-star Fiend Apothecary.”

Lian Hua nodded her head, clearly quite in approval of this.

Coincidentally, Fan Yu also entered the Fiend Medicine Hall at this time.

Seeing Ka Xin and Lian Hua, Fan Yu’s heart thumped, secretly thinking not good.

The Fiend Medicine Hall released a batch of medicinal pills recently. They were in very high demand now. Quite a few factions went into action without delay.

Among these, the one with the strongest competitive power was naturally the City Lord Manor.

Although the alchemy strength of Meng Qi and the rest were too trash in front of Ye Yuan, the medicinal pills produced by the Fiend Medicine Hall were indeed very popular in Capone Capital City.

In the fiend race, good Fiend Apothecaries were too few.

The City Lord Manor had long gotten the news. Hence, Ka Xin made an appointment with Meng Qi ten days ago to meet today.

Ka Xin had a smile on his face as he said, “Heh, Brother Fan Yu came a step late. Lord Meng Qi isn’t meeting guests today, better go back.”

Fan Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly as he said with a cold snort, “Your City Lord Manor eating meat, aren’t you even going to leave a mouthful of soup for people to drink? This time, our Fan Family will definitely fight it out with you!”

Ka Xin laughed and said, “Heh, I’m about to go in and finalize this matter with Lord Meng Qi right away, what will you use to fight to the bitter end with me? Haha, want to fight it out, come early next time.”

The muscles on Fan Yu’s face twitched a few times, suddenly feeling powerless.

The four great families’ foundations were still much worse compared to the City Lord Manor!

People had money and power. Each time the price offered, it was 30% higher than the rest. How to discuss things?

At this time, Le He came out of the inner-hall, the expression on his face rather ugly.

When Ka Xin saw Lu He’s expression, his heart involuntarily thumped.

“Brother Lu He, what did Lord Meng Qi say?” Ka Xin said with clasped hands.

Lu He said crossly, “Your Highness Ka Xin, please return! I asked you to go back, but you insisted on me going to disturb Master! Now, just great. I got a good scolding from him right to my face, are you happy?”

Clearly, Lu He was already unable to maintain his original demeanor.

This scolding was not light!

Just now, the moment he entered and just reported Ka Xin’s name, he was scolded angrily by Meng Qi. Even expelling from tutelage, this kind of words, was uttered.

It would be weird if Lu He’s mood could be good!

Ka Xin had an awkward look. Stuffing a storage ring into Lu He’s hands, he said, “Here are 50 thousand low-grade fiend essence stones, just take it as Brother Lu He’s laboring fees. Since Lord Meng Qi is meeting an important guest, then Ka Xin won’t disturb anymore. I’ll come to visit again another day.”

Who knew that Lu He directly pushed the storage ring back and said, “Just now, Master was already very angry and even said expelling me from tutelage, this kind of words! Aren’t you making me take the road to ruin here? Quickly go, quickly go!”

Ka Xin was extremely depressed. He did not know just what kind of important guest Meng Qi was meeting.

Even meeting City Lord, it would not be to an extent where he expelled his own disciple from his tutelage for relaying a message, right? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, he did not hear of any remarkable major figure who came to the city recently!

Later, better inquire about it, and make some appropriate compensation.

If he were to offend the Fiend Medicine Hall because of this matter, the losses would outweigh the gains.

Getting rebuffed, Ka Xin had an unhappy look too.

He glimpsed at the Fan Yu who was unwilling to give up by the side, and he said indifferently, “Come on, didn’t hear that Lord Meng Qi is currently meeting an important guest? Could it be that you want to cause Brother Lu He to be scolded one more time?”

These words had somewhat of an ulterior motive. It was clearly to irritate Lu He!

Lu He was in a bad mood just now and directly ignored the Fan Yu by the side.

Only after Ka Xin saying this did he notice that Fan Yu had already stood at one side for very long.

Lu He took care of many things for Meng Qi throughout the year and was also a smooth and artful figure.

When he saw Fan Yu, his eyes immediately lit up and he went forward to greet with a smile: “Turns out that Young Master Fan Yu came too. Apologies, apologies, Lu He did not entertain well.”

Those words of Ka Xin’s just now actually already made Fan Yu give up.

He did not expect that Lu He actually took the initiative to engage in small talk with him.

One had to know, he did not even give face to Ka Xin earlier!

“What’s Brother Lu He saying? It’s Fan Yu who suddenly paid a visit and imposed on you,” Fan Yu hurriedly said.

Lu He smiled and said, “Young Master Fan Yu coming to the Fiend Medicine Hall, it’s also in order to request an audience with Master, right?”

Fan Yu was slightly embarrassed, but still nodded his head and said, “Fan Yu will leave right away and won’t cause trouble for Brother Lu He anymore.”

Lu He was taken aback with fright and hurriedly pulled him, saying, “Don’t! Already came, leaving for what? I’ll go in to report right away, you wait a minute.”

Done talking, Lu He directly turned around and left.

Ka Xin already walked to the entrance, but forcefully stopped his footsteps.

He looked at Lu He’s departing back view, enraged until his complexion was livid!

What the hell was this?

Since the beginning to end, Lu He never showed him a good attitude.

Even if he agreed to go in and report just now, it was also with a reluctant look.

But now, Fan Yu himself said that he was going to leave, but Lu He took the initiative to hang onto Fan Yu and not let him leave. Lu He even took the initiative to go in and report!

Didn’t he say earlier that Meng Qi even said about expelling from tutelage, this kind of words?

Fan Yu himself also had a baffled look, completely not knowing what happened.

His relationship with Lu He did not seem to be good to this kind of extent, right?

Before long, Lu He came out gleefully and said to Fan Yu, “Master said, let Young Master Fan Yu wait in the side-hall for a while. When he’s done over at his side, he’ll immediately come and see you!”

Happiness arrived too suddenly. Fan Yu completely did not react to it.

What happened?

By the side, Ka Xin’s expression was long already black as the bottom of a wok.
