Chapter 2161: The Things That You Didn’t Expect Are Too Many!

Deep in the night, inside the dungeon.

A faint fragrance tunneled into the noses of the guards.

Thud!

Thud!

Very soon, they fell down one after another.

A man in black entered the dungeon seemingly like a ghost.

“Your Excellency!” When Long Xiao saw the arrival, he had a look of wild elation, directly kneeling down.

The black-clothed man nodded slowly and said coolly, “Mn, today’s performance was pretty good. Indeed you didn’t disappoint this emperor.”

Long Xiao said smugly, “Of course! That brat wanted to make use of this lowly one to deal with you, but how can this lowly one let him have his way? That brat thought himself to be clever. Wasn’t he still toyed with by us?”

This man in black was naturally none other than precisely Ao Xu!

Ao Xu’s brows furrowed slightly, and he asked, “What the hell was with you guys? With your strength, how could you be captured by that kid?”

Upon saying this, Long Xiao’s eyes immediately turned red, and he gritted his teeth and said, “Your Excellency, you have to take revenge for us! This kid, he ... is too formidable. He killed ... all of my brothers!”

Ao Xu’s expression changed wildly, and he said in shock and anger, “How can this be?”

Long Xiao practically recounted the events briefly with reddened eyes.

As Ao Xu listened, he was wildly shocked in his heart.

He thought that he already overestimated Ye Yuan a lot, but did not think that Ye Yuan was even more monstrous than he imagined!

This kind of horrifying spatial law attainments played Long Xiao and the rest to death.

In fact, even Long Xi, this Third Firmament Empyrean, died in the spatial collapse.

At this moment, not only did Ao Xu not regret it, he felt that his way of doing things was very correct instead.

If he let this boy grow up, how would Ao Yu matter anymore?

“This boy is truly a troublesome fellow! Alright, I’ve already put down the guards. You guys can leave! After going out, disappear for ten years. You’re not allowed to appear anymore!” Ao Xu commanded.

Long Xiao nodded his head and said, “Many thanks, Your Excellency! Then that boy ...”

Ao Xu frowned and said, “Is it your turn to come and tell this emperor how to do things?”

Long Xiao was alarmed in his heart and repeatedly said that he dare not.

But he sensed a thick killing intent from Ao Xu.

Clearly, Ao Xu’s killing intent toward Ye Yuan grew even more. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ao Xu pointed at the void, the jail door opened with a sound.

Long Xiao and the rest were overjoyed and gave a thousand thanks to Ao Xu.

“Alright, stop wasting time, if you get discovered by someone, you guys won’t be able to leave even if you wanted to anymore!” Ao Xu said impatiently.

How could Long Xiao and the rest still dare to stay? They hurriedly exited the dungeon.

At the back, a hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Ao Xu’s mouth. Waving his hand, he changed to the elder’s outfit that he normally wore.

Long Xiao and the rest had just gone out of Purpledragon Stronghold when suddenly, flares rose from all directions at the back, someone cried out in surprise.

The few people were frightened out of their wits, hurriedly fleeing like they were flying.

But right at this time, a horrifying aura came from behind.

“Bold Bandit Xiao, to have the audacity to break out of prison and escape, deserve to be killed!” This cry reverberated throughout the night. The entire Purpledragon Stronghold could hear it distinctly.

The faces of Long Xiao and the rest changed wildly, this voice was none other than precisely Ao Xu’s!

At this time, how could they still not understand what happened?

Ao Xu was going to do away with the witnesses!

Ao Xu did not want to let them go at all, but wanted to give himself an excuse to kill them open and aboveboard!

How powerful was the might of a Heavenly Emperor?

When Ao Xu’s palm smacked over, Long Xiao and the rest felt like the sky had fallen down.

But just as they lost all hope, a gentle force suddenly appeared, and actually blocked this strike miraculously.

Ao Xu’s expression changed wildly and he said in alarm and anger, “Who is it?”

Several figures emerged. The person at the front was precisely Dragon Lord!

Beside the dragon lord, Ye Yuan was currently looking at him with a look of amusement.

Ao Xu’s heart thumped, how could he still not know that he had fallen into a trap?

Dragon Lord stared at Ao Xu with a scorching gaze and said in a cold voice, “Ao Xu, you disappoint this lord too much!”

Ye Yuan turned to Long Xiao and said with a smile, “How about it? I didn’t lie to you guys, right? You all are merely pawns of Ao Xu! Now, you guys are useless already. You naturally don’t need to live on this earth anymore.”

Long Xiao was also a fierce and ambitious person of his generation. But at this time, his eyes were full of rage.

They toiled like slaves for Ao Xu, living life on the edge of danger, and served for so many years. What it exchanged for was actually such an outcome.

“Ao Xu, it’s been so many years, even if us brothers didn’t make any contributions, there’s also hard work! You actually struck such a vicious blow! Brother Ye told us that you’ll kill us. But I, Long Xiao, didn’t believe it. I didn’t expect that you really dealt the blow!” Long Xiao gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

At this time, Ao Xu already passed the initial panic and hesitation. His face recovered composure, and he said with a faint smile, “You guys were merely a few dogs in my hands, isn’t your lives still up to my whims? Now, you all are already useless. So you naturally have to die!”

“You!” Long Xiao also did not think that Ao Xu was actually so shameless, directly admitting it.

Ao Xu ignored him and turned to look at Ye Yuan, saying with a smile, “I really didn’t expect it, this emperor has roamed East Suppression Pseudo World unhindered for millions of years, I actually succumbed at the hands of a brat like you who is still wet behind his ears!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The things that you didn’t expect are too many, isn’t it so?”

Ao Xu’s gaze turned cold, seemingly wanting to kill Ye Yuan.

He exhausted every power of his mind and thought that having laid down an astonishing killing trap, it was absolutely impossible for Ye Yuan to escape alive.

In the end, he did not expect that not only did Ye Yuan escape, he even captured Long Xiao.

The secrets that Long Xiao grasped were too many. Once landed in Dragon Lord’s hands, he definitely would not have a good end.

Hence, he willingly braved the risks and let Long Xiao go, and then kill them.

Who would have thought that all this was within Ye Yuan’s calculations?

He schemed all his life and even included Dragon Lord in his calculations, but lost at the hands of Ye Yuan, this brat who just made his world debut!

This was the thing that he did not expect the most.

Ao Xu laughed and said with a nod, “That’s right! It was this emperor who underestimated you!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I originally couldn’t figure it out. I had no grudges nor enmity with you, why would you want to deal a deadly blow towards me? Only all the way until I arrived at Purpledragon Stronghold did I know that your nephew is a Son of the Heavenly Dragon too. It turns out that you took action for his sake.”

Ao Xu’s expression changed and he said with a big laugh, “Brat, what conniving cunningness you have, and what vicious means! When this emperor does something, it’s this emperor doing it. It has nothing to do with Ao Yu! Ao Zhen, I’m unconvinced! Why can you sit on the seat of a dragon lord, but I can’t!”

Done talking, the imposing aura on Ao Xu’s body suddenly erupted, and he went for Dragon Lord.

The horrifying Heavenly Emperor aura crushed until everyone could not catch their breaths.

The strike of a Heavenly Emperor in anger was too horrifying!

If the energy erupted, the entire Purpledragon Stronghold would be reduced to shambles!

Ao Zhen sighed slightly and suddenly reached his hand out and grabbed at the void.

A gentle force instantly compressed the entire space.

Ao Xu’s force was actually unable to transmit out.

Under this power, Ao Xu could not even resist and was directly eradicated.

The might of Dragon Lord was utterly horrifying!

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he was also secretly shocked in his heart.

This was a middle-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

Initial-stage heavenly emperors were simply akin to ants in front of them! They could not even do anything in front of them!

A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse of his generation, Ao Xu, fell here!

In the darkness, Ao Yu looked at this scene with a calm expression and said coolly, “Second Uncle, you won’t die in vain! This grudge, I’ll avenge it for you!”
