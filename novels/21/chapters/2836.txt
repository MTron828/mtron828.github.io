“Listening to you, do you also want to denounce me publicly for crimes?” Wu Jiang looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile.

“Why? Can’t I2” Ye Yuan still said coolly.

Wu Jiang’s expression turned cold, and he said, “Showing you a bit of color and you really opened a dye shop! A mere Saint Sovereign Heaven boasting shamelessly in front of our Extreme Medicine Sect, who gave you

the courage?”

Ye Yuan still did not turn his head back and said coolly, “The Extreme Medicine Sect is one of Heaven One’s only remaining fruits, and it is also the number one alchemy path sect. In the war with the blood race, the

Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples gained great prestige because they fought bloody battles on the battlefield and treated countless wounded. But you all ignored tens of thousands of wounded and stood by as you

watched people die; hearts like stone. The Extreme Medicine Sect’s face has been utterly lost by you all!”

Everyone could not help nodding one after another when they heard it.

The Extreme Medicine Sect’s reputation had indeed reached its peak after the war.

ot only the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples fought at the front lines and had countless casualties, they even healed countless wounded.

n terms of prestige, the Extreme Medicine Sect was currently the well-deserved number one major sect!

But it was also precisely because of this that the Extreme Medicine Sect had many disciples who became conceited and condescending.

Dao Chen and the others from before, and the Wu Jiang and the others too, they were all like this.

To really discuss merits, Wu Jiang these people had meager cultivation realms. How much merit could they have?

But they relied on the Extreme Medicine Sect’s record of merits and damaged the Extreme Medicine Sect’s reputation.

ow that Ye Yuan entered the Extreme Medicine Sect, he could naturally interfere.

Moreover, the likes of Wu Jiang and Qian Nan were incomparably cold-blooded, passively watching these people die without caring about them. This was diametrically opposed to the Medicine Dao that Ye Yuan

upheld. It was not something that he could tolerate.

When Wu Jiang heard, he did not get angry but smiled instead and said, “Oh wow, you, a mere Saint Sovereign Heaven, is bemoaning the state of the universe and pitying the fate of mankind! It’s just that if you want to

posture, did you pick the wrong place to do it? Who the hell do you think you are? To dare lecture this sovereign?”

Everyone felt that Ye Yuan was crazy.

If you lectured the Saint Sovereign Heaven Qian Nan, forget it.

Now, his martial uncle came, and you still lectured him?

These ten over people were all True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

You only had one True Sovereign Heaven here!

Wu Jiang could not be bothered to talk nonsense either, directly making a hand gesture. More than ten True Sovereign Heavens rushed forward.

That commotion was very shocking.

The surrounding people lamented. Asked you to run away long ago, you didn’t run. Now, you can’t escape even if you want to run away!

But right at this time, a figure suddenly blocked the paths of Wu Jiang and the rest.

When Wu Jiang saw the arrival, he could not help being overjoyed and said, “Wu Jiang, pays respect to Martial Uncle Hua Zong!”

“Paying respect to Martial Uncle Hua Zong!”

“Paying respect to Grandmaster Hua Zong!”

Those True Sovereign Heaven and Saint Sovereign Heavens bowed one after another.

Hua Zong was Zuo Chen’s personal disciple.

Although he was only grand completion True Sovereign Heaven Realm, he was the personal disciple of Zuo Chen this big shot. So he was one generation higher than Wu Jiang in terms of seniority.

Of course, Wu Jiang had nothing to complain about either.

Hua Zong would step into Emperor Realm before long!

Emperor Cloud Heaven, even if it was the weakest Emperor Cloud Heaven Realm, it was also not an unimportant character in the sect anymore.

Therefore, Hua Zong’s status in the Extreme Medicine Sect was not low!

Hua Zong nodded slightly, considered to have responded.

But Wu Jiang said in great joy, “Martial Uncle Hua Zong came just in time. This boy is trying to win popular support in front of our Extreme Medicine Sect’s gates, slandering the Extreme Medicine Sect and even

breaking our Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciple’s legs. Martial Uncle, please uphold justice and take this boy down!”

Wu Jiang was a wily old fox too. Since Hua Zong came, this matter would naturally have Hua Zong take charge.

Want to beat or kill, it was all up to him.

Hua Zong did not react. He just said lightly, “Kneel down.”

Wu Jiang and his fellow disciples were taken aback and said, “Martial Uncle Hua Zong …”

Hua Zong’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “Kneel down!”

Wu Jiang naturally did not dare to contradict Hua Zong. He could only kneel down unwillingly and said, “I wonder how this disciple has offended Martial Uncle Hua Zong? Martial Uncle, please make things clear!”

Hua Zong ignored him but turned to Ye Yuan and said, “Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, do you want my help?”

One sentence, and everyone was extremely shocked.

“W-What did he call? He actually called this master … as his junior apprentice brother?”

“No way, right? Although this lord is True Sovereign Heaven, that Sovereign Wu Jiang calls his martial uncle, it can be seen that his status in the Extreme Medicine Sect is extremely high! He’s actually calling a Saint

Sovereign Heaven junior apprentice brother?”

“Like this, wouldn’t that Wu Jiang have to call Master Ye martial uncle too? Amazing! No wonder Master Ye had a lecturing tone all along. It turned out that his identity is actually so frightening!”

“The Extreme Medicine Sect is well-deserving as the present Heaven One’s number one major sect. It’s indeed still of high moral standing and commands universal respect! It’s just that some monks recited the

scriptures wrongly. We’ve blamed the Extreme Medicine Sect unjustly!”

One ‘junior apprentice brother’ immediately caused the entire place to burst into an uproar.

Before this, there was seriously no one who dared to think so.

A mere Saint Sovereign Heaven, what the hell did he count for in the Extreme Medicine Sect?

Although the Extreme Medicine Sect was not a super major sect like the Labyrinth Divine Palace, they still had tens of thousands of Saint Sovereign Heaven disciples.

It could be said that Saint Sovereign Heavens were as plentiful as dogs in Hegemon level sects!

To those upper echelons, they would not go and care about the life and death of Saint Sovereign Heavens at all.

Wanting to stand out from among Saint Sovereign Heaven, there was only defying the heavens all the way, and reaching the Emperor Realm!

If not, one at least had to kill their way to the forefront among True Sovereign Heavens too.

Therefore, no one ever thought that Ye Yuan was the Extreme Medicine Sect’s upper echelon.

Yet, he was!

The moment his identity became clear, the surrounding people also finally understood why Ye Yuan kept on lecturing Wu Jiang and Qian Nan.

These guys brought shame upon the Extreme Medicine Sect’s name!

Ye Yuan could not stand it and was slapping their faces.

One sentence immediately shifted these people’s negative emotions towards the Extreme Medicine Sect completely away.

As for Wu Jiang and the rest, they were completely dumbfounded.

“J-Junior Apprentice Brother? Isn’t Martial Uncle Hua Zong Grandmaster Zuo Chen’s youngest disciple? When did another junior apprentice brother pop out?” Wu Jiang was stunned.

In other words, we were all posturing to our martial uncle earlier?

Just now, I was still scolding, who the hell do you think you are?

Wu Jiang only felt bitterness in his mouth.

In the Extreme Medicine Sect, heavenly alchemists were revered as supreme. Martial artists took second place.

And Zuo Chen was also an extremely strong existence among grade eight heavenly alchemists, his status being extremely high. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Otherwise, even if Hua Zong was a personal disciple, Wu Jiang would not be so respectful either.

After all, he had a master too.

But now, he actually offended Grandmaster Zuo Chen’s disciple!

This was a disaster!

When Hua Zong greeted, Ye Yuan still did not turn back and just said coolly, “Then I’ll have to trouble Senior Apprentice Brother Hua! This junior apprentice brother is currently administering needles and can’t get up

to pay respects to Senior Apprentice Brother. I hope that Senior Apprentice Brother is magnanimous. After healing these wounded, we’ll talk again.”

Hua Zong nodded slightly and said, “As it ought to be! Wounded people, come over to my side!”

Hence, these two people started treating those wounded.

Hua Zong was a peak grade six heavenly alchemist, his strength being extremely formidable. Otherwise, he would not have been taken in by Zuo Chen as a personal disciple too.

He had also just arrived and did not see Ye Yuan treating the rest before.

However, when Zuo Chen summoned him, he told him about some of Ye Yuan’s characteristics. This Xuanji Nine Leaves was one of them.

Therefore, the moment he saw stars revolving around, he knew that Ye Yuan was here.

But, at this time, he divided a portion of his energy to focus on Ye Yuan there and was incredibly shocked in his heart.

What swift and fierce technique!.
