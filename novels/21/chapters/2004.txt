Chapter 2008: Are You Brain-damaged?

“Talking nonsense!”

These two words, Lu Yan practically squeezed them out of the crevices between his teeth.

Deng and Dai two people, both of their eyes became wide-saucers. Their eyes were filled with disbelief. Their entire person was akin to being struck by lightning, turning stiff.

This piece of news was seriously too astounding.

Lu Yan pointed at that black-clothed armored soldier’s nose and roared angrily, “In a tiny little imperial city, the strongest is merely Fourth Firmament True God. This Empyrean sent an army of 100 thousand, and just the Ninth Firmament True Gods are as many as more than a dozen. How can they possibly be completely wiped out? Did you not bring your brain when you come to report?”

Lu Yan’s roar was virtually going to bring down the roof.

The black-clothed armored soldier was practically turning limp on the ground under Lu Yan’s enormous pressure, unable to even speak.

How could the might of an Empyrean be what a puny little soldier can withstand?

At this time, Deng Yunzai was the first to come to his senses. He hurriedly pulled Lu Yan and said, “Brother Lu Yan calm your anger, let him finish saying.”

Done talking, he turned to the black-clothed armored soldier again and said, “Quickly say what in the world had happened!”

How could the black-clothed armored soldier dare to dawdle? He recounted the events of Ye Yuan poisoning several thousand True God powerhouses to death in detail.

Lu Yan three people listened until they stared dumbfoundedly with slack jaws. They never would have thought that what they waited for was actually such a result.

“This ... This ... How can this be? How could it be like this?” Lu Yan took several steps back in a row, face full of disbelief.

The black-clothed armored soldier naturally could not possibly be lying. It was just that he was not willing to believe it himself.

This piece of news made people unable to believe it. He was not willing to believe it at all.

This way, wouldn’t he, this Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s city lord, become a lone general without an army?

This move of Ye Yuan’s was really too ruthless!

Right now, all of the imperial capitals under his command actually all become empty cities.

Without a True God Realm powerhouse holding down the fort, how could an imperial capital still be worthy of being called an imperial capital?

It directly dropped a level, becoming an imperial city!

From great imperial capital directly to imperial capital, wouldn’t he, this great imperial capital’s city lord, become a laughing stock of the world? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Lu Yan was virtually breaking down!

This blade of Ye Yuan’s directly chopped the level of the cities under his jurisdiction in two at the waist.

Deng Yunzai and Dai Chunhao similarly had vacant faces. They exchanged a glance, both seeing incredulity from the other party’s eyes.

“Void Poison Refining Formation, this kind of means is simply inconceivable! Just what kind of freak is this kid!” Deng Yunzai said in shock.

“Rather provoke 3000 powerful enemies than to bully one poison master! Who could have thought that this kid also had such inconceivable attainments in the path of poison?” Dai Chunhao said with a bitter look.

The rule of Empyreans had always been as strong as iron.

Unless it was similarly an Empyrean, otherwise, no one could shake them at all.

But this kind of understanding was clearly not too applicable when used on Ye Yuan.

Suddenly, Lu Yan’s aura turned cold, and he gritted his teeth and said, “Looks like he’s forcing this Empyrean to personally make a move! This time, this Empyrean is going to flay his skin and pull out his tendons, refine his soul alive, make him never be able to reincarnate for all of eternity!”

...

At Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, there was rejoice among the people.

“Heh, Big Brother, since I knew you until now, I really rarely saw you use poison! This battle is to the immense satisfaction of the masses!” White Light said with an excited face.

“Master’s methods are indeed inconceivable. We shouldn’t have doubted you!” Bai Chen also said with an excited look.

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Us alchemists will not talk about bemoaning the state of the universe and pitying the fate of mankind, but we also shouldn’t commit too much slaughter. If not for that Lu Yan pushing people too far, I also wouldn’t be willing to use this poison formation.”

As an alchemist, Ye Yuan had his own stance.

But living two lifetimes, he was also not a foolish person.

Other people already killed to the doorstep, he naturally would not fold his arms and wait for death.

Bai Tong had not exited seclusion yet, he could only use this sort of method to meet the enemy.

Otherwise, the one who died would be him.

These few years, Yu Wenfeng had been in a state of immense shock the whole time.

Toward Ye Yuan’s unfathomable means, he was long already wholeheartedly convinced.

But at this time, his brows were tightly knitted and he said, “Master Ye, this Yu doesn’t want to be a wet blanket. It’s just that ... this way, Empyrean Lu Yan will likely personally take action! Empyrean Lu Yan is a Second Firmament Empyrean expert! Furthermore, Deng Wei and Dai Yang you killed, their two major families’ ancestors are both Empyrean powerhouses!”

Ye Yuan just smiled when he heard it and said, “Many thanks for Brother Yu’s warning. But ... it’s just three Empyreans, so not a big deal.”

Yu Wenfeng felt stifled when he heard that, nearly choking on a breath of air.

Just ... three Empyreans?

Empyreans ... were not a big deal?

This ... This kind of thing, it was really his first time hearing it!

Empyreans already stood at the apex of ordinary martial artists.

Apart from those fleeting and ephemeral Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, no one dared to not take them seriously!

Empyreans, even if First Firmament Empyrean, no one dared to slight them too.

But three Empyreans were actually so beneath contempt coming out of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

Right at this time, a horrifying aura instantly spread throughout the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

“Ye Yuan punk, I give you three breaths of time! Hurry up and get out to die! If you’re late for a second, this Empyrean will directly turn Heavenly Eagle to dust!”

A thunderous furious roar sounded out in every corner of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

This horrifying pressure made some weaker martial artists directly spurt fresh blood wildly, collapsing to the ground.

“Empyrean! It ... It’s an Empyrean powerhouse!”

“My God, an Empyrean powerhouse personally moved into action!”

“This ... What to do here?”

...

The city was in a panic. This powerful pressure made them virtually about to suffocate.

Yu Wenfeng’s face changed, his face instinctively revealing a fearful expression.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “This Lu Yan is really domineering, wanting to annihilate the whole city at a drop of the hat. I’ll go and meet him!”

Done talking, his figure moved, directly disappearing from inside the City Lord Manor.

The others also had visible changes in countenance, hurriedly going out of City Lord Manor, and looking over toward the sky.

Above the void, three figures stood in the air. That horrifying pressure made the world tremble.

Ye Yuan’s figure emerged, facing the three people from far away.

Lu Yan’s pupils constricted, clearly somewhat surprised at Ye Yuan’s spatial law.

But very soon, his surprise was replaced by fury.

“You’re Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan’s face was without fear as he said coolly, “That’s right.”

Lu Yan’s two eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “Do you know your crime?”

Ye Yuan’s eyelids raised slightly and he said coolly, “Don’t know.”

“You! Insolence! You killed my child Ziyi, poisoned my True God army to death; the crimes you committed are too numerous to be recorded! You actually said that you don’t know?” Lu Ziyi was triggered by Ye Yuan’s attitude and could not refrain from saying in a great rage.

Ye Yuan was still calm as he said, “Lu Ziyi killed my citizens indiscriminately, imprisoned my loved ones, and even wanted to send me to Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital to carry out an execution on the spot. Your meaning is that I have to stand here and let her kill? You sent an army of 100 thousand to massacre the city, saying that spare none. Your meaning is also to have me stand here and let them kill? Are you brain-damaged?”

Ye Yuan’s voice spread throughout the entire city, making everyone shudder with fear.

Lord Ye Yuan was indeed well-deserving of being Lord Ye Yuan, these words were ... domineering!
