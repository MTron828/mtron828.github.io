Chapter 2111: Shameless

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Inside the Priest Temple, Ye Yuan sat high above. Below, stood Xin Luo and the rest of the Seven-star priests, as well as Gongyang Lie.

At this time, the Seven-star priests’ faces all had ashamed expressions.

Xin Luo stepped out of the ranks, bowed all the way down, and said in fear and trepidation, “We have offended Lord Second Sage previously and deserve ten thousand deaths!”

Gongyang Lie had an embarrassed look as he said with a bow, “Gongyang Lie has affronted Lord Second Sage. Your Excellency, please deal out punishment.”

The group of Empyreans could not help being secretly tongue-tied. Even Lord Heavenly Emperor actually acknowledged his fault!

They had lived to this ripe old age and it was really their first time seeing such a scene.

But thinking about it, this was also within reason.

The Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred, his status was even above High Priest Redplume. He could take the bow of a Heavenly Emperor.

With the talent and strength that Ye Yuan displayed, surpassing High Priest Redplume in the future was also possible.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said coolly, “This matter ends here. You all were merely made use of by Old Man Sacred Ancestor, why would this sage stoop to your level?”

Everyone exchanged glances, uncertain what it meant.

But everyone also quaked in their boots when they heard it. To dare call Sacred Ancestor High Priest as Old Man Sacred Ancestor, this was probably one of a kind, right?

If it were before, everyone would definitely turn their noses up at Ye Yuan’s words.

But now, they did not dare to butt in at all.

This was a matter between great gods, so it was not their turn to interject at all.

Come one day in the future, Lord Second Sage would likely be able to grow to become an existence like Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

However, be that as it may, Ye Yuan was still rather grateful toward Old Man Sacred Ancestor.

The demon race’s alchemy technique was a unique school of thought and indeed had many areas to glean from.

Ye Yuan also learned many things from these people.

Ye Yuan was never an egomaniac. On the contrary, he attached great importance to every alchemy battle.

While seemingly unconcerned with alchemy battles, Ye Yuan could actually glean knowledge from it every time.

And it was precisely this kind of accumulation that let him improve at breakneck speeds.

And this was also precisely what Sacred Ancestor High Priest wanted to see.

At this time, someone suddenly came to report. The person said, “Lord Second Sage, the Qilin Clan’s Qi Zhen requests an audience.”

The moment Xin Luo heard, his brows could not help raising up as he said, “Qi Zhen? That Qi Zhen which Qi Chen spoke of? Could it be that ... he came to find Lord Second Sage to complete the bet?”

On that day, Qi Chen made a bet with Ye Yuan in front of everyone.

This matter, the people present all knew.

Ye Yuan asked curiously, “Xin Luo, I heard that these legendary divine beast clans mostly stay reclusive and don’t come out. But why did they appear in Westspirit Region this time?”

Xin Luo said, “Actually, this time was High Priest Redplume issuing invitations to the various major pseudo worlds, inviting the strongest juniors in the current era to come out and have an exchange. This Qi Zhen only came because he received the invitation. It’s just that I don’t know why, his journey seemed to have been delayed for a while now. So he only arrived at this time.”

Ye Yuan felt enlightened in his heart and said, “In this case, Crimsonsky is here to take part in the convention this time?”

Xin Luo nodded and said, “Precisely so.”

Ye Yuan said, “Then, the dragon race and other races have also arrived?”

Xin Luo nodded and said, “Yes. In the past, these races were not willing to interact with the outside world. But this time, they agreed and even sent out quite a few juniors.”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he could not help becoming curious.

Arriving at the Heavenspan World for so many, he had never heard of the dragon race’s information.

As a successor of the dragon race, he was also very curious about the dragon clan.

Looks like this time, he could meet the dragon clan’s powerhouses.

“Let him enter,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Before long, a young man with a frost look walked into the hall.

“I pay respects to Second Sage.” Qi Zhen clasped his hands slightly, with his attitude being somewhat haughty.

Gongyang Lie’s face turned cold and he said, “Insolence! Seeing Second Sage, how can you be so impolite?”

Seeing Gongyang Lie, Qi Zhen’s pupils could not help constricting. It was actually a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

However, it was also just a slight surprise.

With his status in the Qilin Clan, he had seen before many Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

“That’s your Second Sage, not my Qilin Clan’s Second Sage. What do you want me to do before it’s considered polite?” Qi Zhen looked at Gongyang Lie and said neither obsequiously nor haughtily.

Gongyang Lie could not help choking when he heard that.

These apex divine beast races, each clan’s foundation was unfathomable.

Not coming into being these countless years, who knew how many powerhouses were hiding inside their pseudo worlds?

Sacred Ancestor High Priest dominated the Demon Divine Region, but it was also just the Demon Divine Region on the surface. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Furthermore, Sacred Ancestor High Priest only had a unique school of thought in Alchemy Dao, and could not truly unify the demon race.

In the demon race, there were still some existences whose strength did not lose to Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

The demon races’ species were numerous. Some races were powerful and not weaker than that of the outside world.

Just as the Qilin Clan, they had the capital to be haughty.

Squeezing Gongyang Lie with one sentence, Qi Zhen turned to look at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “I came here to inform you that the arranged battle between you and Uncle Chen previously, isn’t counted.”

The moment these words came out, the hall immediately burst into an uproar.

“What? Something that has been agreed upon, they actually went back on their word?”

“This ... This is also too shameless!”

“I understand! They must have seen Lord Second Sage’s strength and are afraid of losing to Lord Second Sage, so they don’t dare to compete anymore!”

“The Qilin Clan is really shameless!”

... ...

Each and every one of the priests present was extremely indignant.

This kind of shameless action, the Qilin Clan could actually do it.

They already acknowledged Ye Yuan, this Second Sage, in their hearts. Now, the Qilin Clan actually did this kind of shameless action, they felt like they experienced it for themselves.

Qi Zhen’s face turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “Everyone, you all had better pay attention to your words. My Qilin Clan isn’t what anyone can bully! Uncle Chen and Second Sage’s arranged bet, I wasn’t present. They also didn’t seek my opinion. This kind of agreement was taken too lightly, so how can it count?”

Qi Zhen was merely an initial-stage Empyrean, but his bloodline was noble. Saying these words, it had its own majesty.

Furthermore, the Qilin Clan was incomparably powerful, this was something known to all in the demon race. Really offending the Qilin Clan, it would be hard to clean up the mess too.

Finished talking, Qi Zhen turned to Ye Yuan again and threatened, “Second Sage, you seized my Qilin Clan’s precious treasure, it’s equivalent to becoming enemies with my Qilin Clan. Qi Zhen gives you a piece of advice. You’d better send the emperor bone back to the Qilin Clan. Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was amused.

The Qilin Clan’s shamelessness was really cut from the same cloth!

He looked at Qi Zhen and said with a smile, “Oh? I wonder what kind of consequences there will be?”

Qi Zhen laughed coldly and said, “Second Sage is from the human race and probably isn’t aware of my Qilin Clan’s power yet, right? My Qilin Clan’s strength can rival half of the outside world’s demon races! You, weigh it over yourself then! Farewell!”

Done talking, Qi Zhen turned around and left.

“Halt!” Ye Yuan shouted coldly.”Did I let you leave?”

Qi Zhen turned around and could not help laughing as he said, “What? Based on you, a True God Realm, you also want to make me stay? Or is it that you think they dared to forcefully keep me?”
