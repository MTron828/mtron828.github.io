Chapter 1451 Killing You Is Like Killing a Dog!

Only after several breaths did Chi Fang suddenly quiver, coming back to his senses.

“Impossible! He ... How can he possibly kill Qin Tian?”

Chi Fang muttered to himself, clearly still unable to accept this fact.

But he knew in his heart that Ye Yuan absolutely would not shoot his mouth off.

Actually, the news of Qin Tian hunting down Ye Yuan was already not a secret in Wu Meng Academy.

The two of them went out to train one after another, and also did not return for ten years.

Even a fool could also guess what happened.

But now, Ye Yuan returned safe and sound, but Qin Tian failed to come back. This had to set off numerous speculations.

Of course, it might be that Ye Yuan used some method to shake Qin Tian off, resulting in Qin Tian still being not knowing that Ye Yuan already returned until now.

But it was also possible that Qin Tian had already fallen in the small world.

Actually, the majority of the people still leaned towards the former. After all, Qin Tian’s strength was quite known.

Even if Ye Yuan broke through to the Heaven Glimpse Realm, it was also not possible to be Qin Tian’s match.

Chi Fang as the academy’s teacher, he was naturally clear about Qin Tian’s strength.

But now, Ye Yuan actually personally admitted that Qin Tian was dead!

What in the world happened inside the small world?

Suddenly, Chi Fang was startled, secretly thinking that things were bad.

“This lad is lawless and rampant, he might do something! This matter, better to notify Tower Lord.”

...

Inside a box room in Clearwind Inn, Qin Zheng and the rest were currently chatting away happily.

“That punk is sly and cunning. We expended so much thought and he wasn’t willing to take a step out of the academy. It’s still Senior Apprentice Sister Lin Xiu who is impressive. The moment you make a move, that punk fell for it obediently.”

Wang Song had a delighted look. It was just that the expression of the Jia Chong by the side was rather unnatural.

But he also knew that his disparity with Qin Tian was too great. There was no chance at all.

Lin Xiu who was sitting on the seat of honor still had a cold and prideful appearance, exuding the temperament of a goddess.

Mentioning Xie Jingyi, she had a look of disgust as she said, “Xie Jingyi wants to score above his league, thinking about having a baby with me. He thought he can do as he pleases. If not for Big Brother Tian telling me not to keep him at a distance, I would have long taken action against him.”

Qin Zheng hurriedly said ingratiatingly, “Isn’t that so! That damn fatty is fat and round, with a name like a girl’s. Forget about a proud daughter of heaven like Senior Apprentice Sister, even ordinary women won’t take fancy on him either!”

Qin Pei smiled and said, “Wu Meng Academy, only Big Brother Tian and Senior Apprentice Sister Lin Xiu is a match made in heaven!”

Mentioning Qin Tian, Lin Xiu’s brows suddenly furrowed and she said, “Big Brother Tian going to kill Ye Yuan this time, he’s gone for ten years. He should be back no matter what, right?”

Qin Zheng paid no attention to it as he said with a smile, “Senior Apprentice Sister Lin Xiu is flustered due to concern. Who is Big Brother Tian? This time, him personally taking action, that kid is probably a dead soul under his sword long ago!”

Qin Pei said, “Yeah, Big Brother Tian probably had some fortuitous encounter in the small world, that’s why he would be delayed until now.”

With them saying so, Lin Xiu also finally felt at ease and said, “Makes sense. Thinking about it, that Ye Yuan is merely at the Grotto Profound Realm, so how can he possibly be Big Brother Tian’s match? What’s laughable is that that punk overestimated his own ability, to actually dare oppose the Qin Family. Truly, wouldn’t have died if he didn’t court death!”

“Oh? Is that so?”

Right at this time, an icy-cold voice sounded out outside the box room.

Bang!

The door was directly broken by a powerful force, revealing a figure with a cold face.

“Who is it, to dare ... dare ... Ye Yuan! You ... You didn’t die!”

Wang Song was just about to fly off the handle when he suddenly saw clearly that the one standing doorway was precisely the nightmare-like existence, Ye Yuan!

This shock was by no means insignificant! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Not just him, when everyone in the box room saw Ye Yuan, their faces all became extremely fascinating.

The news of Ye Yuan returning already spread within Wu Meng Academy.

What was coincidental was that these few people were currently having a small gathering in the city and completely did not know about the news of Ye Yuan returning.

If they knew, they definitely would not dare to swagger about in the city leisurely anymore.

“You guys are very disappointed that I didn’t die, right? But since I didn’t die, then your doomsday ... has arrived!” Ye Yuan nonchalantly sentenced these few people to the death penalty.

Lin Xiu and the rest were only surprised and did not take Ye Yuan’s threat seriously at all.

After all, among them, there were even three grand completion Heaven Glimpse.

While Ye Yuan was only initial-stage Heaven Glimpse.

Hang on, initial-stage Heaven Glimpse!

This guy actually broke through!

Lin Xiu looked at Ye Yuan and said icily, “With just the likes of you? Ye Yuan, since you slipped away from Big Brother Tian’s hands, then I’ll take care of you today for him!”

Ye Yuan looked towards Lin Xiu, his gaze cold.

This woman truly deserved death!

Little Fatty was infatuated with her. She actually made use of Little Fatty’s blind love and caused him to become like that.

“Hahaha, Ye Yuan! Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk! Hell has no gate yet you want to barge inside! Since you escaped by luck, you should have been a bit more low-profile and hide in the academy and not come out. But now, you delivered yourself to the door,” Wang Song said with a loud laugh.

“He’s taking up the cudgels for the injustice done to his brother here! Haha, that damn fatty even said repeatedly that day that his brother will help him take revenge. I didn’t expect that you really came today!” Qin Zheng also laughed loudly and said.

“Then we’ll take a look at how this genius Junior Apprentice Brother Ye will find us to take revenge then!” Qin Pei said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan directly ignored their mocking and said coolly, “Gui Yun!”

A faint phantom appeared beside Ye Yuan and said with a bow, “Master!”

The moment Gui Yun appeared, everyone’s expression changed.

Grand completion Two-star!

This evil spirit’s cultivation speed was so quick. He actually broke through to grand completion Two-star already!

The battle with Qin Tian, Gui Yun sustained heavy injuries.

Through over half a year of recuperating, not only did Gui Yun’s injuries recover fully, his strength even advanced a step further, breaking through to grand completion Two-star.

“Those three will be left to you first. Don’t let them come and disturb me,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Yes, Master!” Gui Yun bowed and said.

“Heh, shameless boasting! A merely grand completion Two-star evil spirit wants to take care of three inner-court peak disciples? One has to admit that you’re very naive!” Lin Xiu said with a sneer.

Gui Yun slowly walked in front and said in a cold voice, “Nether Ghostclaw!”

A black large hand suddenly flew out of the void, grabbing toward the three people.

The three people’s expressions all changed when they saw the situation. They did not expect that Gui Yun’s strength was actually so strong.

Very soon, the three people fell into a tangled melee.

Wang Song looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “You let that evil spirit deal with the three of them, looks like you’re very confident in dealing with me?”

Ye Yuan’s eyelids raised slightly, his voice did not carry the least bit of emotion as he said coldly, “Killing you is like killing a dog!”

His voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan’s Sundering Stars suddenly chopped out!

A complete version Sundering Stars went straight for Jia Chong!

“Puhwark!”

Jia Chong had yet to react to what was happening and directly exploded into a cloud of blood mist!

Wang Song’s gaze turned intent, his face revealing a solemn look.

These few years, Jia Chong already broke through to initial-stage Heaven Glimpse too.

But under Ye Yuan’s Sundering Stars, he was actually one-shotted without even having time to react!
