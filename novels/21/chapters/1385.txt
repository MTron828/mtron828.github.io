Chapter 1389 Unexpected

“What a powerful sword art!”

“T-Too strong! Ye Yuan’s aura is actually no worse than Qin Shao’s!”

“But, Ye Yuan just broke through to late-stage Grotto Profound, how can he possibly display such a powerful sword art?”

...

The moment Sundering Stars emerged, everyone’s expression changed. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qin Nantian suddenly stood up, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of horror.

“The Grand Chant Sword Void is already Wu Meng Academy’s pinnacle-most martial technique. Where did this move of his come from?” Qin Nantian said fiercely.

Chi Fang’s surprise was not the least bit lesser than Qin Nantian’s.

In his view, Ye Yuan was just astonishing in alchemy talent. No matter how formidable his own strength was, it also would not be very strong.

All along, Ye Yuan had always been under the Myriad Treasure Tower’s protection. No one had seen before Ye Yuan actually took action.

No one would have thought that the moment he made his move, it was earth-shattering!

“I seemed to have heard Ye Yuan say just now, this move was his own creation! This ... This move, Sundering Stars, is much stronger than the Grand Chant Sword Void!” exclaimed a teacher from the academy.

“Truly terrifying Martial Dao talent, to actually be able to comprehend such a terrifying martial technique! His talent is likely even greater than Qin Tian’s!” another person said.

Qin Tian was also stunned by this sword of Ye Yuan’s. He finally understood at this moment what Ye Yuan was doing in the Sword Tomb back then.

This guy’s comprehension ability was simply too heaven-defying!

The moment Sundering Stars was unleashed, Qin Shao felt tremendous pressure too.

He gritted his teeth and urged divine essence frenziedly.

This sword did not allow him to hold back in the slightest!

“Grand Chant Sword Void! Kill!”

An enormous long sword phantom condensed and stabbed straight for Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, the Evil Extermination Sword chopped down following the momentum.

A power that forcefully cleaved Mount Hua[1]!

This chop was daunting to the extreme!

The powerful Sword Dao laws condensed and did not dissipate, virtually dividing the entire space into two!

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces changed.

Boom!

Two powerful to the extreme power of laws collided together, shaking the protective grand array until it rocked.

The students on the grandstand could hardly stay on their feet.

No one could have thought that the exchange of two Grotto Profound Realm students would actually produce such terrifying might.

Suddenly, Qin Shao’s expression changed, a mouthful of fresh blood suddenly spewed out wildly!

That long sword phantom did not last long under the swiftness and ferociousness of Sundering Stars before dividing into two, then thoroughly dissipating.

Sundering Stars’ residual power still remained, cleaving toward Qin Shao.

“Qin Shao is finished!”

“This move of Ye Yuan’s is too powerful!”

“Sundering Stars! This move is domineering!”

...

The crowd on the grandstand exclaimed in shock, seemingly already seeing the wretched scene of Qin Shao being split into two.

But right at this time, Qin Shao’s figure suddenly became indistinct.

Boom!

Sundering Stars’ remaining power directly chopped on the protective grand array, shocking under everyone on the grandstand swayed once again.

“It’s the God Bewildering Step! My God, Qin Shao even learned the God Bewildering Step!” Someone cried out in shock.

God Bewildering Step was similarly one of the six supreme academy skills, an extremely profound movement technique.

Everyone did not expect that Qin Shao actually learned two supreme academy skills.

In the instant of imminent danger just now, Qin Shao forcefully deployed the God Bewildering Step, narrowly avoiding the power of this chop!

However, Qin Shao’s condition was very bad.

His body was currently teetering on his feet, almost unable to stand anymore.

Although he avoided vital areas, the power of laws spurred by Sundering Stars still severely wounded him.

Qin Shao already did not have strength to fight again!

Crack! Crack! Crack!

On the grand stand, Qin Nantian’s expression suddenly changed, his knuckles cracking.

This sword of Ye Yuan’s could be said to have broken Wu Meng Academy’s two supreme academy skills.

Although it did not kill Qin Shao, there would not be any changes to the conclusion too.

Ye Yuan’s expenditure was immense, but he still had the strength to fight again, while Qin Shao was no different from waiting for death.

This life and death battle, the result was already without the least bit of suspense!

Qin Nantian pinned high hopes on Qin Shao to finish off Ye Yuan in this fight. But did not expect that Ye Yuan’s skill astounded all, overpowering Qin Shao with Sundering Stars.

Three years of waiting turned into naught!

How could this not enrage him?

“Humph! Trash!”

Qin Nantian could not stay anymore. He gave a cold snort and flicked his sleeves and left.

He felt that the Qin Family’s face had been utterly thrown away by Qin Shao!

The Qin Family was like the noonday sun, but ever since running into Ye Yuan, it seemed like they bumped into walls everywhere. This made him very aggrieved.

“What a shame, Qin Shao is so talented, but he actually has to fall here!”

“He’s really a rare genius. If he really carries on cultivating, his accomplishments might not be worse than Qin Tian’s! It’s too bad that ... he ran into Ye Yuan!”

“Ye Yuan is really too heaven-defying! He actually self-created a martial technique, overpowering two supreme academy skills! In Wu Meng Academy’s so many years of history, probably no one has ever been able to accomplish it, right?”

“Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao first-layered heaven laws don’t seem to be at grand completion yet, but he can defeat Qin Shao with Sundering Stars this move. It can be seen that his understanding of Sword Dao is profound to what kind of extent!”

...

Geniuses were respectable, especially Qin Shao, this kind of genius among geniuses.

His defeat made the other students feel great pity.

However, geniuses were sorrowful too. They must kill each other in order to attain Dao.

Alas, Qin Shao ran into Ye Yuan. Otherwise, he could have radiated splendor!

“Do ... Do it. I already ... don’t have strength to fight again! I ... I lose!”

Qin Shao used the last of his strength to stab the long sword onto the ground, forcefully bracing himself and not falling down.

He could lose, but he did not wish to lose in an undignified manner!

At least, these three years, he already did his best.

His feeling back then was right. Ye Yuan was indeed his future formidable foe.

It was just that Qin Shao never expected that this day arrived so quickly!

From the entrance examination until the life and death battle now, a mere five years had passed.

Five years were just a snap of a finger, but Ye Yuan already caught up from behind, utterly surpassing him.

The scene of Qin Nantian flicking his sleeves and leaving, Qin Shao took it into his sights. His heart was already akin to dead ash.

No matter how hard he worked, he could not obtain any of the Qin Family’s high regards.

Ye Yuan put away the Evil Extermination Sword and said nonchalantly, “I won’t kill you. You’re an opponent worthy of respect! Furthermore, you’re different from the other Qin Family members!”

“What did he say? I ... I wouldn’t have heard wrongly, right?”

“Ye Yuan and the Qin Family is long already irreconcilable, how could he let Qin Shao off?”

“Yeah, Qin Shao didn’t hold back in the slightest just now and already aimed to kill Ye Yuan. I didn’t expect that Ye Yuan actually wants to let him off!”

...

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone stunned.

This decision of his exceeded everyone’s expectations.

The rules of life and death battle were all the way until one party died.

But if the victor was willing to spare the other party, the other party could naturally survive.

Except, normally, both parties who arranged a life and death battle were bound to have deep-seated hatred, wishing to kill the other party and then be gratified.

Situations like Ye Yuan and Qin Shao were exceedingly rare.

“H-Hahaha, are you pitying me? I, Qin Shao, don’t need people to pity!”

Qin Shao looked up at the sky and howled, suddenly raising his sword and stabbing down towards his own sea of consciousness.
