Chapter 2394: Both Happy and Tragic!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everyone used expectant gazes to look at Ye Yuan, hoping to get his affirmative answer.

Presently, everyone understood the significance of Ye Yuan’s existence!

He was too important to the human race!

Seeing these expectant gazes, Ye Yuan also could not bear it in his heart.

He knew that these peerless geniuses, including Shang Hang, would not be able to escape the fate of demise in the future.

“Very sorry, I’m afraid that ... I can’t do it.” Ye Yuan sighed quietly and said.

Buzz!

The geniuses present exploded at once.

Originally, this rumor was just some gossip. Many people did not believe it.

But when Ye Yuan personally confirmed it, they could not accept it at all.

“Why? Lord Chief Instructor is the deity in my heart! He ... He’s actually so afraid of risking his neck!”

“With His Excellency around, why worry about not being able to overthrow the divine race? Why? Why is he such a person?”

“My God, the perfect image in my heart has collapsed!”

... ...

Following the appearance of the inheritance grand arrays, Ye Yuan was pushed up the altar.

The growth in strength was visible to the naked eye.

Hundreds of thousands of geniuses growing at the same time, this kind of increase could be rated as terrifying.

Someone as powerful as Jian Rufeng could not endure it anymore as well.

The delight of having growth in strength was something that no one could give to them.

Profound Secrets could shield heaven’s secrets, but it was also just to not let the divine race discover them. It could not make them become stronger.

The person who made them become stronger was Ye Yuan!

This kind of means already surpassed their imagination.

So these few years, Ye Yuan had already been regarded by them as an existence on par with Profound Secrets.

Even a fool could also tell how great the significance of these 18 inheritance grand arrays was.

But now, Ye Yuan who they viewed as a god actually did not dare to face the divine race.

This fact, they were seriously unable to accept it.

“Ji Qingyun! Where did the drive when you wiped out the Sentry Celestial Palaces and faced countless divine race powerhouses by yourself back then, all go to?” Witchcloud shouted angrily and berated painfully. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He was disappointed to the extreme with Ye Yuan’s answer.

Ye Yuan had long already used his strength to conquer him, this alchemy path’s number one person.

But that was all established on the basis of overthrowing the divine race.

Now, he discovered that Ye Yuan was actually such a person. This made him unable to accept it.

Facing the questioning voices that filled the sky, Ye Yuan was just silent.

Only Jian Rufeng was absorbed in thought. Waving his hand, he said in a solemn voice, “Alright, you all don’t have to be like this! No matter how he chooses, that’s his own business! No matter what, Young Friend Ji’s contributions far outweigh his faults! It was him who brought us hope! Even if he chooses to leave, we don’t have the qualifications to question him too!”

Finished saying, he turned to Ye Yuan again and said, “Young Friend Ji, no matter what, this ancestor represents all races and thank you!”

As he said, he gave a deep bow toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was startled and hurriedly returned the bow.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them was dumbstruck with amazement.

Although they were unable to accept it emotionally, they understood that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ words were not wrong.

If not for Ye Yuan’s appearance, this plan that was carefully planned by Deicide might just be an after-meal joke to the divine race.

But with Ye Yuan’s inheritance grand array, everything was different!

After bowing, Jian Rufeng turned to his clansmen, his face revealing a reluctant look, as he choked up and said, “Gentlemen, having you all die together with me today, I, Jian Rufeng, have let you all down! Heavenly Dao samsara, if there’s an afterlife, I, Jian Rufeng, am willing to toil like a slave to repay you all!”

As he said, he also gave a deep bow toward his clan members.

The clan members were greatly alarmed and returned the bow as they said, “Family Head is overwhelming us! Family Head is doing it for the people of the world, we’re willing to follow in death!”

Jian Rufeng’s gaze turned intent and he said in a clear voice, “Good! You all are my Jian Family’s fine sons! Let’s ... get started!”

Everyone said in unison, “We follow Family Head’s orders!”

This conversation did not have any pretentiousness for effect, it was full of a stirring and solemn noble spirit to die.

Hundreds of thousands of hot-blooded men, how fired up with boundless enthusiasm were they?

But at this time, they were already sobbing too much to talk.

These hundreds of thousands of people, many of them were personally scouted by Jian Rufeng.

Jian Rufeng was very heroic and generous as a person, with a leader’s temperament that brought people into submission.

Toward these juniors, he had never put on airs, rather like a brother being long-winded.

Just like with Ye Yuan, after meeting him, Jian Rufeng directly designated him to be the chief instructor.

This kind of breadth of spirit, even Ye Yuan was brought into submission.

The rise of the human could not do without Ye Yuan, much less without Jian Rufeng!

Ye Yuan only left behind inheritances. But this foundation was forged little by little, with Jian Rufeng expending countless years.

To talk about contributions, Ye Yuan really did not dare to take credit.

Why did the Jian Family develop into the Heavenspan World’s number one major family in the future?

This was not unrelated to what Jian Rufeng paid back then.

Regardless of whether it was the human race, or demon race, or fiend race, or other races, they would all give the Jian Family face!

Therefore, the Jian Family’s forces spread throughout the entire Heavenspan World, but no one dared to say anything.

Amidst the sobbing sounds, Jian Rufeng held his palm out, a blazing sun slowly rose in his palm.

That blazing sun shone with boundless radiance, emitting an aura that made people’s hearts palpitate.

The incomparably vigorous aura blotted out the sky and sun as if blocking this heaven and earth.

His gaze swept over the faces of his clan members and he said in a solemn voice, “I need your strength. Who’s first?”

His voice had yet to fade when a middle-aged man who bore some resemblance in looks to Jian Rufeng slowly walked out and said in a clear voice, “Big Brother, I’ll go first!”

Jian Rufeng’s face twitched, but he forced a smile and said, “Haha, good brother, you go first, big brother will follow right after!”

That laughter virtually carried tears.

This person was Jian Rufeng’s younger brother, Jian Ruyun!

Jian Ruyun did not say a word, traces of power gushing out of his body, and merging into the blazing sun in Jian Rufeng’s hand.

Jian Ruyun’s body was also becoming fainter bit by bit, turning lighter.

Finally, it turned into nothingness.

Jian Rufeng’s eyes were long already wet with tears!

A man would not easily shed tears until his heart was broken!

Even for someone as strong as Jian Rufeng, how could he bear it under such circumstances?

After Jian Ruyun, one powerhouse after another from the Jian Family also followed closely behind.

With the members of Jian Family passing away one by one, it moved everyone present greatly!

The originally sobbing sounds gradually turned into wailing sounds.

“The Jian Family is righteous! Even if I, Shang Hang, is dashed to pieces, I’ll also suppress the divine race for all of eternity! Today, I swear in the name of Heavenly Dao, if I shrink back in front of divine race one day, I’ll never reincarnate for all of eternity!” Shang Hang swore to heaven in tears.

“I, Qin Chao, swear to heaven, I’ll definitely expel the divine race in this lifetime, nothing will shake my resolve!” In the crowd, Qin Chao similarly swore.

There was no idea how many swore an oath to heaven like them.

It was also precisely starting from today, that their aspirations became incomparably firm, all the way until the Doomsday Battle erupted.

The blazing sun in Jian Rufeng’s hand became larger and larger, and increasingly hotter.

Finally, the Jian Family’s hundred powerhouses were all dead, while Jian Rufeng’s tears had long already been dried by the blazing sun.

Next, it was his turn!

His gaze looked in Witchcloud’s direction and he said, “Old Friend, I leave everything in your hands!”

As he said, an astonishing aura surged wildly.
