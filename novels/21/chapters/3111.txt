Chapter 3110: Two Great Supremacies Joining Hands, Grand Brightjade in Danger!

Clearly, that palm previously was not Heavenless’ greatest strength. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

But this palm after that was his greatest move!

The current Heavenless seemed like a monarch who was standing high above the masses, ruling over everything!

When a king was enraged, corpses would float for a thousand miles!

He glared and said in a solemn voice, “This damn thing was developed by Ye Yuan that punk, right? This boy is really a freak! However, it ends here too! This ancestor has comprehended Chaos Great Dao and will use this world to establish awe!”

Heavenless turned both palms toward each other, endless saint force poured out from his body.

Some inexplicable power was actually also included in it!

What this power was, nobody knew. But everyone could feel its power.

Clearly, this was something that could only be grasped after reaching Heavenless, this kind of level.

Yi Xue said in alarm and horror, “That seems to be the power of Great Dao! Could it be that Ancestor Heavenless actually grasped the Dao of Chaos? This … What kind of realm is this!”

Chi Hu smiled coldly and said, “Since Ancestor Heavenless can control a Dao, our Progenitor can naturally control a Dao too! However, being able to kill Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven this bunch of bastards, that would be for the best!”

Yi Xue was taken aback and said with a smile, “You’re right! Presumably, Progenitor’s strength won’t be worse than Heavenless’! This time, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven definitely can’t block it! Being able to watch this world be destroyed with my own eyes, it’s also a beautiful thing!”

The blood race repeatedly suffered losses in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. Yi Xue even almost died here.

They were full of unhappiness with this world.

Now, being able to watch it get destroyed with their own eyes, the blood race powerhouses were naturally very satisfied.

“Heaven and Earth Infinity!”

The universe seemed to be flowing between Heavenless’ palms!

Here was heaven and earth!

It was only to see him push both palms. A surge of force that was terrifying to the extreme gushed out.

That feeling was really like the sky had fallen down.

Even the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven started trembling!

The complexions of Mi Tian and the others were deathly pale. The power of this move was much stronger than that palm previously!

Could they still block it?

Right when he was feeling flustered, the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List stirred again!

That feeling of bloodline connection appeared once more!

It was just that this time, the heartbeats that Mi Tian felt, the number far exceeded that one just now!

There seemed to be countless hearts beating in his consciousness.

A power of will that was unimaginably colossal poured toward the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List frenziedly.

“This … This is the power of all beings!” Mi Tian was shocked in his heart as he said.

Different from the previous time, the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List’s summoning this time, the target was all the living creatures of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

Those that flew in the sky, those that swam in the sea, even if their strength was as meager as dust, they participated too.

This was the power of all beings!

At this moment, all living creatures in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, joined hands to resist the enemy!

Mi Tian was unable to describe the shock in his heart. The Chaos Heavenly Spirit List was seriously too amazing.

This item already surpassed his knowledge of any chaos heavenly treasure.

Clearly, the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List determined its attack according to the strength of the opponent.

Becoming stronger when encountering the strong!

An invisible barrier condensed and formed again, covering Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven like a giant umbrella.

Boom!

The barrier collapsed once again, and Heavenless’ figure was actually knocked a hundred steps back!

His expression was ugly to the extreme.

Meanwhile, Yi Xue and the others reined in their smiles, not daring to move.

Even though they really wanted to laugh.

But, in front of Heavenless, they did not dare to do so.

If they laughed, they would die!

They could only pray in their hearts for Progenitor to hurry up and come into being, and help them escape suffering.

Right now, they wanted to leave but did not dare to leave; They wanted to laugh, but they did not dare to laugh.

How bitter!

Heavenless only felt his face burn fiery hot. The big talk that he bragged about was being proven to be bragging time and again!

Someone as powerful as him was actually unable to shake the measly Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

“Good! Very good! This ancestor wants to see how many times you all can block!” The overwhelming aura on Heavenless’ body ran rampant once more. Clearly, he had turned somewhat angry from embarrassment.

Right at this time, a mocking voice sounded out. “Heavenless, you’re only half a step away from transcending the Great Beyond, but you can’t even take down a low-level plane, how disgraceful!”

While talking, an elderly figure stepped out of the chaos.

When Heavenless saw the arrival, his pupils could not help constricting.

“Humph!

Old Dog Samsara, stop making wisecracks here! If you have the ability, destroy this world for this ancestor to see!” Heavenless said with a sneer.

The arrival was precisely Progenitor Samsara!

Different from Heavenless’ overwhelming aura that billowed to the sky, Progenitor Samsara was not so high-profile, looking just like an ordinary old man.

Progenitor Samsara’s disposition belonged to that kind of profoundness that washed away the guise of the secular, making people unable to grasp.

However, nobody dared to question his strength!

Mi Tian had a foreboding feeling!

Heavenless and Samsara had a life-and-death great enmity!

When Heavenless saw Samsara, he actually did not pounce on the spot. What did this show?

This showed that he was very apprehensive of Samsara!

Mi Tian could not see through Samsara, but from Heavenless’ reaction, he guessed that Samsara’s strength likely did not lose to Heavenless!

This was not good news to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

He knew that Ye Yuan had offended three great supremacies badly in the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

If these two people joined hands, then Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven would really suffer a cataclysmic disaster!

At this time, their three-way relationship was very delicate.

The current Mi Tian could only pray that things did not develop in the worst direction.

“So, it’s Brother Samsara. Long time no see!” Mi Tian clasped his hands towards Hegemon Samsara from far away.

Hegemon Samsara and him were virtually born at the same time. However, Hegemon Samsara’s talent was clearly greater than his.

There was also considered some friendship between him and Progenitor Samsara.

Mi Tian’s thoughts stirred, wanting to borrow Hegemon Samsara’s strength.

Samsara gave him a glance and said with a light smile, “Mi Tian, put away your ulterior thoughts! It’s useless to address me as brother here! If it wasn’t Ye Yuan, it would not have been impossible for this progenitor to consider letting the person off! But I must kill Ye Yuan!”

Heavenless glanced at him and said with a loud laugh, “Haha, Old Dog Samsara, you and I have the same idea! It looks like you couldn’t transcend the Great Beyond either, right? You and I are only half a step away from being able to truly transcend Great Beyond and completely control a Dao! If not for Ye Yuan, perhaps we’d have succeeded! This enmity must be avenged! We’ll settle our scores later! Why don’t you and I join hands and destroy this world first? How about it?”

The moment these words came out, the hearts of everyone in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven thumped, yelling inwardly not good.

These two great supremacies joining hands, it was simply deadly!

In front of them, all ulterior thoughts became useless.

Strength was the only reliance.

Progenitor Samsara did not give Mi Tian a chance at all.

Samsara gave Heavenless a look and said meaningfully, “Heavenless, you’re very confident! You’re certain that Bloodstone that fellow can’t transcend Great Beyond?”

Heavenless said indifferently, “You and I have reached this realm. You naturally know how difficult this half-step is! What right does Bloodstone that fellow have to be stronger than you and I? At the very most, it will also be a situation of tripartite confrontation in the future, no?”

Completely controlling a Dao, this meant that they could become the spokesman of Heavenly Dao!

Seemingly like it was half a step away, but it was absolutely worlds apart.

Heavenless and Samsara were both clear about this in their hearts.

This half a step was far too difficult!

They spent countless years and could not take this half-step too.

Samsara glanced at him and said with a smile, “Okay, I agree!”
