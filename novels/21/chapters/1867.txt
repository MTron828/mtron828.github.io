Chapter 1871: The Terrifying Last Three Levels Sword Formation

“Continue!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, choosing to continue challenging.

To others, this Heaven Killing Sword Formation was a life-snatching-like existence.

But to Ye Yuan, this was not considered anything.

Him being able to easily pass the rounds did not rely on spatial law either.

Arriving in the Immortal Grove World was like arriving at home. As long as he released Immortal Grove Heavenly Dao’s aura, it was impossible for this sword formation to attack him.

The Heaven Killing Sword Formation was like this, when plucking the Vermilion Bird true blood, it was also like this.

Ye Yuan possessed the Soul Suppressing Pearl and World Suppressing Stele, two lifeblood spirit treasures. How could the traps Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove laid down possibly cause harm to him?

In the fourth level sword formation, the power suddenly increased.

This time, Ye Yuan finally took action.

It was only to see his fingertip move lightly. Those streaks of sword light were pushed aside effortlessly.

Those horrifying sword lights could not get close to him at all.

“So strong! Ye Yuan cleared the fourth round much more leisurely than Xu Xing!”

“Xu Xing fused three powers of law, and there’s also the augmentation of the White Tiger true blood to be able to do it to this extent. Ye Yuan he ... based on what?”

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan’s casual state, each and everyone extremely alarmed and scared.

The current Ye Yuan did not employ the power of Heavenly Dao. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xu Xing fused three kinds of law powers. It looked very strong, but comprehending three kinds of law powers similarly made his comprehension speed become very slow.

Although Xu Xing’s strength far surpassed powerhouses of the same rank after fusion, if he wanted to do it like Ye Yuan, leaping over two or three minor realms to fight the enemy, that was impossible.

And Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao law was already comprehended to middle-stage fifth firmament. His spatial law was even comprehended to the terrifying peak initial-stage fourth firmament.

After fusion, his combat strength was extremely formidable.

This Heaven Killing Sword Formation did an overall evaluation. To the Third Firmament Celestial Deity Ye Yuan, it was not considered very hard for him to clear the fourth round.

Following that was the fifth round, sixth round, Ye Yuan similarly made it through.

When the transmission array appeared, everyone held their breaths.

Would he choose to continue challenging?

“You can choose to leave now and can also choose to carry on with the challenge!” That voice sounded out once more.

At the far end of the grand array, the Xu Xing who originally already obtained a true god mystic treasure was very pleased with himself.

But now, his expression was very ugly.

He stared fixedly at Ye Yuan, hoping that he would choose to continue.

Because he was certain that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to clear the three rounds at the back.

The last three rounds, no one had seen it before, no one dared to go and attempt as well!

“Continue!” Ye Yuan said very calmly.

Everyone’s minds trembled, no one could have expected that Ye Yuan really dared to continue challenging.

In order to spite Xu Xing, he did not even want his life anymore?

One could tell and when Ye Yuan cleared the sixth round, although it was not as miserable as Xu Xing, it was also quite laborious for him.

The three rounds at the back, the possibility that he could make it through was virtually zero!

The seventh level difficulty did not activate immediately.

A destructive aura gradually crept out in the space.

Puu, puu, puu ...

The few martial artists standing closer were actually blown apart from this terrifying aura!

The countenance of the group of powerhouses suddenly changed, hurriedly retreating.

This seventh level sword formation’s power was actually so horrifying. A hint of aura that randomly effused out blew Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses up.

Then the Ye Yuan in the eye of the storm, his pressure could be imagined.

Everyone’s gaze was focused on Ye Yuan.

“This ... Someone is going to die! Ye Yuan overestimated his ability too much!”

“This is the might of an Empyrean? That boy is dead for sure!”

“The seventh level is already so horrifying, what will the ninth level sword formation look like?”

...

The expression on everyone’s face was extremely ugly. The power of this seventh level sword formation made them understand what was called awe!

This destructive power let them witness the power of Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

Right at this time, the seventh level sword formation activated!

Countless sword light directly engulfed Ye Yuan.

The powerhouses outside the array formation could not see Ye Yuan’s figure at all.

“Hahaha ... idiot, see if you still don’t die this time!” When Xu Xing saw this scene, he laughed wildly without ceasing.

A hint of relief actually flashed across Ji Kang’s face.

He was rejoicing, rejoicing that he did not go and challenge the seventh level difficulty!

Ji Kang weighed it over, if he challenged the seventh level sword formation, he would definitely die!

Time slowly trickled by. Gradually, the sword lights receded.

Everyone’s pupils shrunk, looking at that figure inside the sword formation in disbelief.

“This ... This is impossible! Such terrifying power, how can he possibly survive?” Xu Xing’s eyes were full of disbelief.

He completely never thought that he could see Ye Yuan. Under such horrifying sword lights, Ye Yuan would not be able to leave behind even a corpse.

But now, Ye Yuan was standing there perfectly fine.

It was just that there were many more wounds on his body.

Ye Yuan stood there without moving, both eyes tightly shut.

On the Frostcounter Sword, there was fresh blood dripping from the tip of the sword non-stop.

Ye Yuan’s state was clearly not very good, but his heaving chest told everyone that he was fine.

“How is this possible? He actually made it through the seventh level, it doesn’t make sense!”

“Could it be that his talent is even greater than Xu Xing’s?”

“But ... even Lord Ji Kang didn’t have the confidence to challenge the seventh level sword formation!”

...

A series of exclamations sounded out everywhere. Ye Yuan’s performance seriously exceeded their expectations too much.

Originally thought that Ye Yuan was just a Third Firmament Celestial Deity, reputation undeserved, unable to even pass the first three levels if he entered the sword formation.

But now, Ye Yuan actually cleared the seventh level in one go.

This kind of horrifying talent gave them a tremendous shock.

In a twinkle, the eighth level sword formation activated.

The power this time was several times more terrifying than the seventh level!

Xu Xing cursed Ye Yuan to die non-stop in his heart. He did not believe that Ye Yuan could even make it through the eighth level.

But, when the sword formation receded, Ye Yuan was still standing with his sword raised, no movements at all.

And the place where he was standing was identical to before, without shifting in the slightest.

Everyone was dumbfounded. What was going on here?

Could it be that Ye Yuan cleared the eighth level without moving at all?

The ninth level sword formation activated. That horrifying pressure made even Ji Kang, this Ninth Firmament True God powerhouse, feel asphyxiated.

Too terrifying!

“Je je ... rather interesting!” Inside the sea of consciousness, Empyrean Devilfeather suddenly started laughing strangely.

Ji Xun’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Yeah! This boy has always been very odd!”

Empyrean Devilfeather smiled and said, “Can’t you perceive it?”

“Perceive what?”

“This boy is comprehending on the sword!”

“C-Comprehending on the sword? Comprehending inside the Heaven Killing Sword Formation? What kind of joke are you making!” Ji Xun said in disbelief.

“Heh, if my conjectures are right, after the ninth level sword formation ends, he’ll still maintain this posture. The eighth and ninth level difficulty, he never moved at all.” Empyrean Devilfeather’s words were astonishing.

Ji Xun got a big shock and said in disbelief, “How is that possible!”

Empyrean Devilfeather smiled and said, “If I didn’t see wrongly, the limits of this brat’s strength is the seventh level! The two rounds at the back, he didn’t use his own strength to clear them at all!”
