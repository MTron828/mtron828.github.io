Chapter 1335: Revealing True Colors

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Late at night, a figure suddenly staggered into the Myriad Treasure Tower.

But when Hong Yin saw this figure, she was taken aback with fright.

It was only to see that this figure was covered in blood from top to bottom. It was as if he was hauled out from a blood pool, looking incomparably grim.

“Luo Jian, what ... what’s with you? Where’s Sir Ye?”

Hong Yin recognized the arrival and hurriedly forward and helped him up.

This figure was none other than precisely Luo Jian!

“Q-Quickly help me to go and meet the tower lord!” Luo Jian gasped.

“Oh, I’ll help you over right now!” Hong Yin said.

Right at this time, Feng Ping flashed out from the inner-hall and exclaimed, “Luo Jian, why have you suffered such serious injuries? Quickly come in, I’ll treat it for you!”

Luo Jian’s face was deathly pale. Seeing Feng Ping, he said weakly, “Many thanks for Elder Feng’s good intentions, but the matter is urgent. My injuries, best treat it afterward!”

Feng Ping’s expression changed, and he said, “Luo Jian, what in the world happened? Weren’t you escorting Ye Yuan into the Yin Wind Den? Where is he?”

Luo Jian said, “The Wang Family sent out three elders to hunt us down, surrounding us at the Yin Wind Den! Fortunately, Ye Yuan had methods to control evil spirits. That was how he helped me to charge out of the heavy encirclement, making me return to seek help! The Wang Family pursued Ye Yuan into the Yin Wind Den’s interior and I lost contact with him. I rushed back without stopping once to ask Tower Lord for help!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Feng Ping’s expression changed drastically, and he said, “This ... This matter, only the few of us know! So how did the Wang Family get the intel?”

Luo Jian shook his head and said, “Don’t know! Now isn’t the time to look into this matter. Continue to drag on, Ye Yuan will likely be a goner! Hong Yin, quickly help me to go see Tower Lord!”

Hong Yin was also worried about Ye Yuan’s safety and hurriedly helped Luo Jian in.

After the two people left, the expression on Feng Ping’s face changed several times. Finally, he gritted his teeth and dashed out of the Myriad Treasure Tower, vanishing into the dark night.

...

“Ye Yuan is the Myriad Treasure Tower’s money tree now. Yang Rui definitely won’t look on with folded arms! Once he makes a move, the lives of those three elders of your Wang Family will be difficult to guarantee!”

Inside the Wang Family’s study, Feng Ping’s words were clearly somewhat anxious.

But his words gave Wang Lingbo hope!

He revealed a look of pleasant surprise on his face and said, “Is this true? My second uncle they all are really still in the Yin Wind Den?”

Feng Ping said urgently, “Why would I lie to you? Just earlier, Luo Jian returned to the Myriad Treasure Tower covered in blood. He already broke through to grand completion Grotto Profound. You think about it, apart from your Wang Family’s three elders, who can injure him until like that? There was no time for him to even treat his injuries, and he wanted to go and see Yang Rui! It can be seen how dangerous the situation is! I’m afraid that Yang Rui will beat you to it. So I come to inform you right away! You quickly get Lord Yuxiang to take action. Otherwise, the consequences are too ghastly to imagine!”

This news was seriously too pleasantly surprising, sweeping Wang Lingbo’s depressed mood clean.

Wang Lingbo hurriedly said, “Okay! You go back first, don’t arouse their suspicions! I’ll go and meet my father right now and invite his elderly self to take action! These two days, he didn’t have any appetite for food over Second Uncle and their matter.”

Feng Ling nodded his head and hurriedly said, “Okay, I’ll return right away!”

Not long after he left, a person rode a horse out of the Wang Family, swift as lightning, galloping over towards outside the city.

After Feng Ping came out of the Wang Family, his entire person also heaved a sigh of relief.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually still had the ability to control evil spirits, and was actually able to withstand the besieging of three mighty grand completion Grotto Profound powerhouses.

It looked like he really underestimated him.

But with Wang Yuxian making a move, Ye Yuan definitely could not escape his doom this time.

“Yo, it’s the evening now. Elder Feng still has the leisurely mood to come out for a stroll. How pleasant!”

Feng Ping was currently pondering when a voice suddenly sounded out from behind him, making him jump in fright.

Turning around to look, Feng Ping’s eyeballs popped out.

“Ye Yuan, y-y-you ... Why would you be here? Aren’t you ... Aren’t ...”

The one talking was none other than precisely Ye Yuan!

When Feng Ping saw Ye Yuan, he was shocked until he was stumbling over his words.

Ye Yuan looked at Feng Ping with a smile that was not a smile and said smilingly, “Is Elder Feng trying to say, shouldn’t I be trapped at the Yin Wind Den currently? Why would I show up here?”

Feng Ping said in surprise, “Y-Yeah! Didn’t Luo Jian say ... Ah!

It ... It’s great that you’re fine! H-Haha.”

Feng Ping’s reaction was fast too, hastily changing his tune.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Elder Feng, do you think ... the injuries that this Ye did to Luo Jian was still passable? It seems like even you didn’t see through either!”

Feng Ping’s expression changed, and he said in a grim voice, “You ... What do you mean?”

“Heh, what do I mean? This is nighttime. Elder Feng is coming out of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s sworn enemy’s residence. I wonder what’s the meaning of it?” Ye Yuan said with a cold sneer.

Monstrous waves stirred up in Feng Ping’s heart. But he still harbored a hint of getting lucky and feigned ignorance and said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about! Which eye of yours saw me coming out of the Wang Family? Ye Yuan, you don’t make unfounded remarks!”

“Make unfounded remarks? Heh, the ones who saw you come out from the Wang Family wasn’t just me alone!” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Suddenly, several people appeared behind Ye Yuan.

The one in the lead had an incredibly solemn demeanor. How could it be if not Yang Rui?

Yang Rui’s appearance shattered the last trace of hope in Feng Ping’s heart.

He finally understood that this play tonight was a total trap!

Ye Yuan set up this trap in order to make him head to the Wang Family!

And he waddled over just like that.

Yang Rui looked at Feng Ping and said with a look of pain, “When Luo Jian told me this matter, I still didn’t believe it! Feng Ping! I, Yang Rui, examined my conscience and feel that I didn’t treat you shabbily. Why did you betray the Myriad Treasure Tower?”

Feng Ping knew that there was zero chance of getting lucky today and said with a cold snort, “I didn’t betray the Myriad Treasure Tower, I just want this boy dead! With this boy around, I, Feng Ping, will never come a day where I raise my head up here in the future! The Myriad Treasure Tower can only have one chief alchemist, and that is me, Feng Ping!”

Hearing these words, Yang Rui looked up at the sky and gave a long sigh, and he said, “Hence, you gave Ye Yuan’s intel to the Wang Family, and borrowed the Wang Family’s hands to kill Ye Yuan?”

Feng Ping said in a solemn voice, “That’s right! The Myriad Treasure Tower, there’s no him if there’s me, no me if there’s him! Ever since this boy came to the Myriad Treasure Tower, have you looked me straight in the eye once?”

Yang Rui was enraged until he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said solemnly, “You clearly know Ye Yuan’s importance to the Myriad Treasure Tower. How could you actually still do such a thing?!”

Feng Ling smiled coldly and said, “So what? This boy’s origins are unknown, his identity uncertain. You all actually used such a guy and paid no heed to me! I’m doing this all for the sake of the Myriad Treasure Tower!”

“Heh, for the sake of the Myriad Treasure Tower, so you even sold out your own bro? It’s fine if you betrayed me, but Luo Jian has fought alongside you for so many years. How could you bear it?” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

“Those who accomplish great things doesn’t bother with trifles! Saying anymore is pointless. Before dying, I only wish to know, what in the world happened to those three old fellows from the Wang Family?” Feng Ping said.

He was unresigned!

He still did not believe until now that Ye Yuan could escape the Wang Family’s three great elders’ pursuit.

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said coolly, “All dead. The Wang Family sent out 16 people this time, and all of them are dead.”
