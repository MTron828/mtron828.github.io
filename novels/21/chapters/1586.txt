1590 Beat Time Control

Tap!

Just as Ning Siyu shattered the Blood Longevity Heavenly Ginseng, Ye Yuan’s index finger lightly tapped on the table in front of him.

Ning Siyu’s peripheral vision was on Ye Yuan’s fingers all along.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s movement at this time, her body instinctively started moving.

Ning Siyu’s movements were far from as flashy as Song Qiyang’s. It even seemed somewhat clumsy.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help being rather astounded.

Could this kind of clumsy technique obtain a good result?

“Huhu, is this lass here to be funny? This kind of technique, still want to beat me?” Song Qiyang laughed in spite of himself.

Tap, tap, tap!

Ye Yuan’s finger knocked on the table three times again. Ning Siyu’s technique suddenly changed.

The law fragments emitted from the Blood Longevity Heavenly Ginseng actually started to pour into the Dao Development Instrument in a steady stream.

That deacon originally also thought that Ning Siyu could not make it this round. But at this time, his pupils suddenly shrunk, looking at Ning Siyu in disbelief.

He was the closest to Ning Siyu and could feel the aura of the law fragments.

Those law fragments actually did not dissipate much, with the vast majority entering the Dao Development Instrument.

Tap!

Tap, tap, tap, tap!

Tap, tap, tap!

Ye Yuan’s finger knocked on the table non-stop, the tempo changing irregularly.

From the view of outsiders, it was like Ye Yuan was tapping on the table out of sheer boredom.

But Ning Siyu followed Ye Yuan’s rhythm and changed her technique continuously.

The Dao Development Instrument’s scale climbed crazily!

Four points!

Five points!

Six points!

When it reached six points, it still had not stopped, rushing straight for seven points!

Everyone was stunned. What was with Ning Siyu’s strange technique?

Seven points, that was grandmaster-level!

Ning Siyu’s control over Dao Development already reached such an astonishing extent?

“Don’t reach seven points! Don’t reach seven points!

Song Qiyang shouted desperately in his heart, hoping that it could stop Ning Siyu.

However, Ning Siyu did not give him any chance at all, directly rushing up to seven points!

However, this was not over yet!

After shooting up to seven points, the rate of increase clearly slowed down. But it still climbed up bit by bit.

Finally, it stopped on the 7.3 scale line!

The whole place was silent. It lasted for a full five breaths before a wave of exclamations sounded out.

“7.3! This ... This is too fake!”

“Could it be that Ning Siyu already reached the realm of grandmaster?”

“This is also too exaggerated! A Three-star Alchemy God actually guided out 73% of law fragments! Even for Four-star Alchemy Gods, not many can do it as well, right?”

... CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Dao Development’s score, the higher it went, the harder it was.

Especially after Dao Development reached 60%, even a single point more was also as hard as ascending to heaven.

Even if one broke through to Four-star Alchemy God, understanding of Alchemy Dao becoming more profound, it was also not possible for Dao Development to directly fly from 60% to 70% all of a sudden.

But Ning Siyu, she did it!

Astonishment was written all over Ruo Xu’s face. Originally, he still wanted to rely on Song Qiyang’s high score to viciously smack Ye Yuan’s face[1].

But now, Song Qiyang’s result was simply trash in front of Ning Siyu!

Xuan Yu’s shock was not the slightest bit less than Ruo Xu’s.

He could not resist asking Ye Yuan, “Elder Ye, you ... How did you do it?”

However, Ye Yuan’s face was not happy at all. Instead, The expression seemed to be looking rather dissatisfied. He said, “This lass, to actually only draw out this bit. She really disappointed me this time!”

The group of elders revealed strange expressions on their faces. This guy was intentionally posturing, right?

7.3 points!

He actually found it little!

Actually, they did not know that Ye Yuan’s special training to Ning Siyu was specifically targeting this Pill Tower competition.

In ten days’ time, the things that could be done were too few. Of course, it was impossible to let Ning Siyu’s strength soar to such a terrifying level.

But if it was just targeting this competition, Ye Yuan could let Ning Siyu easily win.

This Dao Development, it was just guiding out the law fragments in a single spirit medicine. To Ye Yuan, there was not much difficulty.

Ning Siyu’s technique was all created by Ye Yuan, specifically used to guide the law fragments in spirit medicines.

This technique had a total of 100 seals, Ye Yuan made Ning Siyu practice these seals until she had it at her fingertips.

As for how to apply, she did not need to worry about it.

Then, he agreed on a secret code with Ning Siyu. Ning Siyu just had to deploy the seals according to his rhythm and she could naturally draw out even more law fragments.

This was also just Ning Siyu. If it were Ye Yuan, if it was not 100%, it was at least above 95% too.

His understanding of Alchemy Dao was not what others could compare to at all.

Originally, according to Ye Yuan’s estimations, Ning Siyu should at least be above 75%. He did not expect that she would only achieve 73%. Hence, he was naturally unhappy.

As if sensing Ye Yuan’s dissatisfied faze, Ning Siyu spat her tongue out, looking embarrassed.

She knew that she made some minor problems earlier, that was why she did not meet Ye Yuan’s requirements.

The Dao Development continued, Ning Siyu seemed to have also gradually entered a state of concentration. The Jade Cicada Immortal Pistil’s performance was clearly much better than the Blood Longevity Heavenly Ginseng.

Finally, the result of Ning Siyu’s Jade Cicada Immortal Pistil was 7.5!

Song Qiyang’s expression became uglier and uglier, his face burning hot. It was as if he was slapped by someone.

He was still brimming with confidence previously, thinking that this second round, he would win.

But now, his result was simply trash in front of Ning Siyu!

Looking at it now, every sentence he said earlier, every posturing he did, was all smacking his own face.

Very soon, the result of the Sovereign Rule Crape Myrtle also came out.

7.5!

Ning Siyu’s total score was 22.3 points!

Compared to Song Qiyang’s 17.3, it was a full five points higher!

What these five points represented was an insurmountable gap.

“Simply unbelievable, is this girl really Ning Siyu?”

“Is Elder Ye really so formidable? Only used a few days’ time and he taught Ning Siyu to such a level?”

“Head Elder’s lineage really had their faces swept to the ground this time.”

...

Ye Yuan looked at Ruo Xu with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Head Elder, wonder if this result can wind up the matter?”

Head Elder had a grim expression as he said, “Young man, don’t be so overbearing! You’ll suffer a big loss like this!”

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Head Elder, seems like the one who’s overbearing isn’t me, right? I just became an elder and your disciple came up to bully. Why did it become me who’s overbearing now?”

Head Elder could not help choking and snorted coldly and said, “Young man, don’t get cocky too early! You and I, there’s still a contest!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I already can’t wait for it.”

The two people dealt a blow for a blow. All of the elders were silent like cicadas in winter.

This new elder was really too awesome.

Even Second Elder did not have this courage to talk to Head Elder like so, he actually dared!

As for whether or not Ye Yuan really had this ability, everyone still had a skeptical attitude.

If not seeing it with their own eyes, nobody would believe that a Three-star Alchemy God could win against Head Elder.

As for Ning Siyu, they were more inclined to believe that Second Elder recently found some tricks to teach disciples.
