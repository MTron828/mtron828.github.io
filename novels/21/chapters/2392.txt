Chapter 2398: Without Him, There Won’t be You All!

If say Shang Hang’s kneel was still within the scope of everyone’s understanding.

Then Profound Secrets’s kneel subverted everyone’s understanding!

No matter how strong Shang Hang was, he was presently just a wisp of remnant thought too.

How strong he was, these unpredictable children could not imagine it too.

Time was sufficient to dilute everything.

But Profound Secrets was the present era’s number one person!

To some extent, his status was even higher than Dao Ancestors!

Dao Ancestors were strong, that was strong in power.

But the Jian Family’s tens of billions of years of operation, their forces spread to every corner of the Heavenspan World.

The great name of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, there were none who did not know in the Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets!

He was the strongest person living at the moment!

His kneel represented that the Heavenspan World’s top powerhouse today bowed his head in submission in front of Ye Yuan!

This kind of surprise could not be described using words at all.

The group of unpredictable children exchanged glances, shocked beyond recognition.

“This ... What on earth happened? Ye Yuan merely made a trip into the spacetime turbulence. So why did Lord Profound Secrets kneel towards him?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Saint Azure? Who the hell is that, to actually be able to make an ancient supreme powerhouse and the present era’s strongest person kneel down at the same time?!”

“Ye Yuan’s age is merely a few thousand years old. So what right does he have to make two supreme powerhouses kneel?”

... ...

A belly full of questions was like a cat scratching, making them uncomfortable to the extreme.

Just a few centuries ago, Ye Yuan was still competing with them for the supreme inheritance.

But making a trip to the spacetime turbulence, it was as if the whole world had changed.

Seeing these two people kneel, Ye Yuan was also filled with a multitude of feelings, and said with a sigh, “All get up! The seas have already changed into mulberry fields and mulberry fields into seas! I’m just Ye Yuan, not Saint Azure!”

But Profound Secrets shook his head firmly and said, “Saint Azure is Saint Azure, unless the myriad races are destroyed! Otherwise, you’ll always be Saint Azure! Without you, there wouldn’t be the myriad races’ ten billion years of stability! Without you, the myriad races will still be trampled under the divine race’s feet! Even if seas change into mulberry fields and mulberry fields into seas, it also can’t cover up your achievements!”

Talking up to here, he turned to everyone again and said, “Everyone, all come and offer greetings to Saint Azure!”

This sentence carried an unquestionable majesty.

He was not discussing with everyone, but he was commanding everyone!

Yu Tanzhi had a look of refusal to comply on his face as he gritted his teeth and said, “What bullshit Saint Azure! Based on what? He’s merely a brat who’s still wet behind his ears, what right does he have to make me kneel?”

“Yeah! Lord Profound Secrets, did you get the wrong person! He’s Ye Yuan, not this Saint Azure you’re talking about.”

The group of unpredictable children could not get over this hurdle in their hearts at all. Making them kneel towards a peer, they could not do it.

But Profound Secrets’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said to Yu Tanzhi, “Insulting Saint Azure is regarded as insulting the myriad races! Yu Tanzhi, you have been disqualified! Everything that you obtained in the Primeval War Realm, this emperor will also take it back!”

Profound Secrets’s eyes turned dark, pointing a finger at Yu Tanzhi.

Yu Tanzhi’s entire body trembled, feeling like something in his body was stripped away.

His strength was regressing rapidly. Very soon, it returned to the level when he had just entered the Primeval War Realm.

He had a look of horror and said, “My ... My strength!”

Profound Secrets’s gaze was cold as he said, “The Primeval War Realm was created by me! As long as your consciousness hasn’t returned to your body yet, I can take it back at any time!”

Profound Secrets could strip these countless inheritances from the Ancient Battlefield, wanting to strip away the strength that Yu Tanzhi obtained was naturally accomplished with ease.

He worked hard here for more than a thousand years. He did not expect that in the end, it was all for naught! He actually did not obtain anything!

At this time, he wished to give himself two tight slaps.

If he had long known it would be like this, why did he have to run his mouth earlier?

Except, he completely did not understand what kind of existence Saint Azure was in the eyes of Profound Secrets and Shang Hang.

The group of unpredictable children was transfixed like wooden chickens. Clearly, they did not think that it would play out like this.

At the same time, they also came to understand how sacred and inviolable Saint Azure’s status in Profound Secrets’s heart was!

Wan Zhen was a sensible person, so he took the lead to kneel first.

Profound Secrets might recognized him wrongly, but it was impossible for Profound Secrets and Shang Hang two people to recognize wrongly at the same time.

Clearly, judging from these two people’s expressions earlier, they themselves also felt that it was too inconceivable.

They had always been denying this fact but also had no choice but to accept this fact.

But even so, the two of them still knelt down without the slightest hesitation.

This was sufficient to show how lofty Saint Azure’s status was!

This kneel, Ye Yuan was deserving of it!

With Wan Zhen taking the lead, no matter how unwilling the other unpredictable sons were, they had to kneel too.

Otherwise, if they had their strength taken back by Profound Secrets, that would be awkward.

Hence, the others knelt down one after another.

Profound Secrets’s gaze looked at Yu Tanzhi coldly as he said in a chilly voice, “Why? You aren’t kneeling yet?”

Yu Tanzhi being looked at, felt as if he fell into a bottomless ice abyss, and he knelt down with a thud.

Having his strength taken back and he still had to kneel.

Yu Tanzhi even had the thought of wanting to cry at this time.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was an existence that he could not provoke. Even his family’s ancestor, if he really provoked Profound Secrets, he would be annihilated with a snap of a finger.

In this Heavenspan World, apart from Dao Ancestors, there were none who could contend with the Jian Family.

Everyone knelt down one after another, leaving only Ancestor Lightning still standing there alone.

Profound Secrets said in a cold voice, “Pang Tian, have you forgotten who bestowed you this crown of Dao Ancestor?”

This time, Profound Secrets did not call out Ancestor Lightning, but he called his real name, Pang Tian!

This was reminding him not to forget his origin.

Without Azure and Profound Dual Saints, there would not be today’s Ancestor Lightning!

Ancestor Lightning’s expression flickered incessantly. Others could kneel, but he was the paramount Dao Ancestor!

How could he kneel?

However, as an ancient existence who similarly survived from the previous epoch, he was deeply aware of Azure and Profound Dual Saints’ status in that era.

He was also clear that there was nothing wrong with Profound Secrets’s words!

He took a deep breath, his gaze deep as he said, “Are you sure that he’s Saint Azure?”

Profound Secrets nodded and said, “Irrefutable! Before this, his body didn’t have that aura. But this time, he retrieved the aura that belonged to him originally from the spacetime turbulence! Therefore, he’s Saint Azure!”

Ancestor Lightning was silent. Finally, he still knelt down slowly.

“Everyone, kneel thrice and kowtow nine times, pay respects to Saint Azure!” Profound Secrets said in a clear voice.

“We pay respects to Saint Azure!” Under Profound Secrets’s lead, everyone carried out the etiquette of three kneels and nine kowtows in Ye Yuan’s direction.

This was the highest level courtesy!

After the ceremony, Ye Yuan sighed slightly and said with a bitter smile, “All get up! Not just you guys, this saint also feels that it’s inconceivable until now. But since the two of you recognized this saint, then it also confirms that this isn’t an empty dream! It’s just that, this is a little too inconceivable.”

Profound Secrets nodded and said, “It’s naturally not an empty dream! The 18 inheritance grand arrays created the human race’s eternal prosperity! Nobody is able to erase this!”

Done talking, his gaze swept over all of the unpredictable children, and he said in a solemn voice, “I know that you all feel dissatisfied, feeling that Lord Saint Azure is peers with you guys, and isn’t worthy of accepting the ceremony of bowing and kowtow! But, without him, this world ... won’t have you all!”
