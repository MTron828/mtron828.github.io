Chapter 665: The Azure Spirit Tree Belongs to Me!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Listening to what White Light said, this Dark Forest was simply even more perilous than the Essence Devouring Confounding Fog!

With their present strength, they were simply unable to enter.

Perhaps that Dragon Lord, that fellow, knew some things. But he probably would not say over his dead body.

If the Dragon Lord would disclose information, then the God Prohibited Demon Region would definitely have long known some of the state of affairs inside.

However, it looked like the Dark Forest was an enigma to the God Prohibited Demon Region.

“Since that’s the case, then let’s better not attempt to enter that Dark Forest. Wait until our strength is sufficient someday, then go exploring it isn’t too late either,” Ye Yuan said.

This Dark Forest definitely held in store a massive secret. But with Ye Yuan’s current strength, he was unable to explore it at all.

Ye Yuan was curious. But these curiosities needed for his deep hatred to be avenged, before it could be fulfilled.

“Big Brother, you should have come to the tiger clan for the Azure Spirit Tree, right?”

White Light walked all the way along with Ye Yuan and was very clear about Ye Yuan’s affairs.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right. I originally wanted to pay a visit to Hu Yan. Looks like his situation isn’t so great.”

“I’m not very concerned about this either, that’s why I didn’t inquire much as well. But looks like he’s indeed not doing too good. But I know that the tiger clan has been plotting to deal with the Azure Spirit Tree all along these few years. Now, it’s just about time to reel in the net already,” White Light said.

White Light knew that Ye Yuan wanted to find the Azure Spirit Tree, so he would obviously inquire about news in this area.

With his status, inquiring about these was not hard.

Ye Yuan sighed emotionally and said, “Good brother, you are so considerate.”

“Haha. Traveling the entire way until now, it was all big brother helping me. Now that I finally managed to have a chance to help big brother, what are you being courteous with me for?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Huhu, then I won’t be melodramatic. But the tiger clan could actually ascertain the Azure Spirit Tree’s position under the situation where Hu Yan isn’t around?”

Not that Ye Yuan was looking down on the tiger clan. But the Azure Spirit Tree’s whereabouts were erratic and extremely hard to grasp.

Knowing the approximate position, Ye Yuan could naturally determine the Azure Spirit Tree’s position. But to say that the tiger clan had this ability, Ye Yuan did not believe.

“The place nearby the Dark Forest in the tiger clan’s territory has a piece of wood-attribute spirit vein. The Azure Spirit Tree seemed to have taken fancy on that piece of land. Hence, it has been lingering in that area all along,” White Light said.

Only then did Ye Yuan suddenly came to a realization. This Azure Spirit Tree was a heaven and earth spirit wood. What it needed the most was wood-attribute heaven and earth quintessence.

In the tiger clan’s territory, there was actually a chunk of wood-attribute spirit vein. No wonder it hung around there and did not leave.

Ye Yuan mused for a moment and said to White Light, “I’ll have a talk with Hu Rong.”

. . . . . .

“What? You want to take part in rounding up the Azure Spirit Tree?! Heh, you’re indeed here for the Azure Spirit Tree! Even though you’re Tiger Lord’s brother, our Darkfiend Tiger Clan has already plotted for a full ten years for the sake of this day! Why should we give you a cut of the loot?”

When Hu Rong heard Ye Yuan’s request, he nearly jumped up.

If not for White Light by the side, he would have long made a move against Ye Yuan.

He previously judged that Ye Yuan came for the Azure Spirit Tree. Looking at it now, it was indeed like so!

Hu Rong was still puzzled previously, why the tiger lord would be especially interested in the Azure Spirit Tree. Looking at it now, it was actually for the sake of this boy in front of him.

Ye Yuan had long guessed Hu Rong’s reaction and said with a faint smile, “Ten years and only laid down Wood Spirit Dragon Imprisoning Array?”

Ye Yuan’s smile carried thick mockery, greatly stimulating Hu Rong. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Hu Rong gave a cold snort and said furiously, “What do you know? That Azure Spirit Tree’s strength is incomparably powerful! Even Big Brother Hu Yan isn’t a match either! We have to be very wary when laying down the array. Once we let it find out, all the effort would be all for naught. Now, the Wood Spirit Dragon Imprisoning Array is only missing one final step. As long as the grand array is formed, the Azure Spirit Tree will be an item in our bags! You, a foreign boy, wants to sit idly and enjoy the fruits of others’ labor with just a sentence. Do you really take our tiger clan to be easy to bully?”

In Hu Rong’s view, Ye Yuan was relying on his ties with White Light to demand an exorbitant price.

Ye Yuan’s strength was pretty good. But surrounding and sieging the Azure Spirit Tree, that was Tier 6 experts’ matters. Tier 5 experts did not even have the qualifications to take part.

What was Ye Yuan worming his way in at this time for other than reaping what he had not sown?

Ye Yuan said, “It’s true that the Wood Spirit Dragon Imprisoning Array is powerful. But wanting to trap the Azure Spirit Tree, it’s still a little inadequate. With the likes of your strength right now, to want to capture the Azure Spirit Tree, that’s impossible. Don’t blame me for not warning and you fail to beat the tiger and get hurt instead when the time comes. Even if I have Peng Yun, this chip right now, it most likely can’t protect the Darkfiend Tiger Clan either.”

Hu Rong’s expression changed, and he immediately snorted coldly and said, “Exaggerating to scare people! The Wood Spirit Dragon Imprisoning Array is a peak Tier 6 grand array. Furthermore, it has immensely great restraining effects towards wood-attribute spiritual objects. On what basis can it not subdue the Azure Spirit Tree?”

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “What you said is right. But you’ve neglected one point.”

Hu Rong gave a cold laugh but did not follow up.

Ye Yuan continued, “The Wood Spirit Dragon Imprisoning Array is a fire-attribute grand array. I do indeed have extremely powerful restraining effects towards wood-attribute spiritual objects. If it were changed to another place, you guys would definitely be able to succeed. But sadly . . . what the Azure Spirit Tree took over is a wood-attribute spirit vein! It’s true that myriad things under the heavens reinforce and counteract each other, but that’s not absolute! On this chunk of wood-attribute spirit vein, the Azure Spirit Tree can draw out an inexhaustible flow of wood essence power. When the power of the wood essence exceeds the limits that the grand array can withstand, your grand array will collapse all the same! At the minimum, the Azure Spirit Tree can also draw on the immense wood essence power to deplete the grand array’s constraints. You all are likewise not its match.”

Ye Yuan spoke with confidence and composure. Hu Rong’s expression changed again and again.

The matter that was originally almost in the bag, now with Ye Yuan saying this, many issues were added on.

Every word of Ye Yuan’s was reasonable. They really had not thought about this point.

“Humph! Even if it’s like this, what can you do if you went?” Hu Rong said stubbornly.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “This, you don’t need to care. I naturally have my ways. However, I can help you all catch the Azure Spirit Tree and help you guys treat Hu Yan’s injuries. But the Azure Spirit Tree belongs to me!”

Hu Rong’s expression changed, “In your dreams!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “I’ve already stated the terms. Whether you agree or not is up to you. If you don’t believe in heresy and insist on giving it a shot, it’s also up to you. But the Azure Spirit Tree, I’m determined to get it! If you come to find me again when the time comes, the price will be raised.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan directly turned around and went out, leaving behind Hu Rong with that angry expression flickering incessantly.

. . . . . .

The moonlight was obscured. Hu Rong’s figure quietly appeared in the tiger clan’s sacred ground.

In an empty hall, a slightly aged looking figure was seated on the ground.

A blood light revolved around him, carrying a thick tiger race aura.

It was just that his two eyes were tightly shut, seemingly oblivious to the outside world’s situation.

This person was precisely the Hu Yan who had already vanished for ten years in front of outsiders!

Hu Rong looked at Hu Yan and said, “Big Brother, the Wood Spirit Dragon Imprisoning Array will be set up complete tomorrow. This time, I’ll definitely bring the Azure Spirit Tree back for you . . .”

As Hu Rong said, Hu Yan did not respond, as if he did not hear what he was saying at all.

Before long, Hu Rong turned around and left.

However, what he did not notice was that not long after he left, Hu Yan’s eyes actually silently opened.
