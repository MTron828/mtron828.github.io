Chapter 3061: Comprehending Origin Again!

“Succeeded! Indeed succeeded again!”

“Hegemon Yun Xiang is completely defeated this time!”

“I really didn’t expect that Ye Yuan, a puny little Emperor Vast Heaven, really defeated a Hegemon Realm!”

“How is this possible? The two of their realms are not on the same level at all. So why can Ye Yuan win? Can’t figure it out!”

… …

Ye Yuan walked out of the sub-formation carrying treasures. The whole crowd burst into an uproar.

This announced that Ye Yuan had completely defeated Hegemon Yun Xiang.

At this time, Hegemon Yun Xiang was looking at Ye Yuan in a daze, indescribably uncomfortable.

In a fair battle, she was defeated by an Emperor Vast Heaven!

She was somewhat unable to accept this sort of thing.

It was as if her many years of comprehension in Formation Dao had all become a joke!

How many years had she comprehended Formation Dao?

How old was Ye Yuan?

......

Comparing people, was the disparity really so great?

“Why? Why is it like this?” Yun Xiang said absentmindedly.

“Heaven formation isn’t as simple as you imagine! Nine array elements, developing myriad Dao and the universe, the knowledge here accesses heaven and penetrates the earth! These nine array elements are the foundation of all array elements! Hegemon Sevenway simplified things, comprehending Great Dao. But it’s also precisely because of this that it’s easier to make mistakes in many areas, and it even makes it hard to comprehend. The quintessence of Heaven formation isn’t in the grand array but in these nine array elements!” Ye Yuan said.

Yun Xiang’s entire body trembled, her eyes revealing a look of astonishment.

Clearly, the things that Ye Yuan said opened her mind to new ideas.

But knowing was one thing; comprehending was another.

Yun Xiang’s Formation Dao cultivation was very strong, but Heaven formation was not what she could comprehend in a short time.

This was the disparity between her and Ye Yuan.

This Heaven formation was enough for her to use a lifetime to comprehend!

“I … I lost!” Yun Xiang said with a bitter smile.

Ye Yuan patted her shoulder and said, “You’re very strong. Heaven formation is your chance to break through the shackles. Comprehend it well. Maybe in the future, you can corroborate your Dao as a Supreme Hegemon.”

This action looked very strange in everyone’s eyes.

Under normal circumstances, this was an elder inculcating a junior.

But a measly little Emperor Vast Heaven actually acted in such a manner to a Hegemon Realm. It looked really strange no matter how one looked at it.

But people also had nothing to say!

This was because this Emperor Vast Heaven had indeed completely defeated a Hegemon Realm!

An inconceivable victory!

In the following journey, it became Ye Yuan’s solo performance.

Hegemon Yun Xiang ignored her injuries and followed behind Ye Yuan like a little follower.

Just as Ye Yuan said, this Heaven formation was her greatest lucky chance!

Even if she could comprehend one-ten-thousandth, it would also benefit her for life.

The number one killing formation in all heavens and myriad words, this name was not called in vain.

Ye Yuan did not have the thought of being selfish either. Although he was not on good terms with these Hegemons, the crisis of the blood race was near at hand. If their strength could improve further, it would naturally be a good thing too.

Hence, a scene that amazed everyone appeared.

Yun Xiang, this Hegemon level heavenly formation master, was actually like a disciple, frequently receiving Ye Yuan’s teachings, making everyone click their tongues in wonder.

Yun Xiang’s improvement was obvious.

Three years later, Yun Xiang’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds, and she actually broke through to Peak Hegemon in one stroke!

All the Hegemon Realms were really envious to the extreme.

“Really amazing! I didn’t expect that Hegemon Yun Xiang actually had a blessing come to her in the disguise of misfortune, breaking through the shackles in one stroke!”

“I heard that Hegemon Yun Xiang has already been stuck in this realm for 100 thousand years!”

“Ye Yuan is really too impressive! He actually forcibly nurtured an ordinary Hegemon into a Peak Hegemon!”

“But speaking of which, Hegemon Yun Xiang’s improvement is great, but it’s still far from Ye Yuan’s! Since half a year ago, she already couldn’t keep up with Ye Yuan in Formation Dao!”

… …

After she broke through, everyone exclaimed with admiration one after another.

No one thought that in the end, it was actually Hegemon Yun Xiang who obtained a great benefit.

But, starting half a year ago, the confusion on Hegemon Yun Xiang’s face grew increasingly stronger.

She was no longer able to comprehend the things that Ye Yuan said.

This grand array became more difficult and obscure the further back.

It was clearly only constituted of nine array elements, but the things derived were incomparably complicated.

On this day, Ye Yuan walked out of a sub-formation, his eyes becoming incomparably bright.

His whole body teemed with the power of origin.

Hegemon Yun Shang’s eyes lit up, and he cried out in surprise, “This boy comprehended Formation Dao origin! Emperor Vast Heaven Realm, comprehending two great origins, this is simply too monstrous!”

When geniuses from all heavens looked at this scene, they only felt ashamed to the extreme.

Comprehending origin to them was not considered something very hard.

But these people had basically all already broken through to Emperor Sakra Heaven.

No one could comprehend origin in Emperor Vast Heaven Realm at all.

Let alone comprehend two origins.

“Sigh,?I really have been sitting in the well and looking at the sky! I’ve always thought that I’m a genius who doesn’t lose to anyone! But today, I’m thoroughly convinced!”

“How did this guy’s brain grow? Why is his comprehension ability so strong?”

“There’s always someone better, and heaven beyond heaven!”

… …

Geniuses were all condescending.

Even if it was Yang Qing, they remained unconvinced too.

But they were really convinced by Ye Yuan.

This guy was simply a monster!

Forget crushing his peers; he even taught a Peak Hegemon!

Ye Yuan meditated on the spot, digesting the fruits of Formation Dao origin.

Several days later, he slowly opened both eyes, the look in his eyes becoming incomparably bright.

“Young Friend Ye, how is it? Do you have confidence in walking out now?” Hegemon Yun Shang said rather agitatedly.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Can’t walk out! The entire Labyrinth Divine Palace is enveloped inside the Heaven formation! However, with my current Formation Dao strength, we shouldn’t encounter any dangers when walking around inside the grand array.”

Hegemon Yun Shang’s expression changed. He did not expect that this grand array’s area coverage was actually so vast!

Didn’t this mean that all of their lives were grasped in Ye Yuan’s hands?

“Ye Yuan, are you doing it on purpose?” Zhang Hexin said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you keep talking crap, do you believe that I’ll directly bring you into a death door? Killing you is as easy as killing an ant now!”

Zhang Hexin’s expression changed wildly. He did not believe it, but he did not dare to gamble.

Yun Xiang said in a solemn voice, “Zhang Hexin, if you dare to be disrespectful to Young Friend Ye, this seat will find trouble with you!”

Zhang Hexin exploded, yelling angrily, “Damn woman, you’re going too far! Do you think that by breaking through to Peak Hegemon, you have the qualifications to challenge this seat?”

Zhang Hexin was a Peak Hegemon to begin with. This was also why he could become the leader of the seven great Hegemons.

But now, Yun Xiang’s cultivation realm had already caught up to him. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yun Xiang smiled coldly and said, “Zhang Hexin, this seat advice that you’d better stay more low-key! Otherwise, if Young Friend Ye takes action, you won’t even know how you died! Do you really think that you, this Hegemon, are very powerful?”

Hegemon Yun Shang was rather annoyed and said in a solemn voice, “Enough! Stop talking nonsense. Continue forward!”

Under Ye Yuan’s lead, everyone finally crossed that enormous imperial garden and entered the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s group of palaces!
