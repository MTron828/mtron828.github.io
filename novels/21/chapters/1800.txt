1804 Avenging Grievances if There Are, Taking Revenge if There“s Grudge

Smack!

“Made you transport a few pieces of heavy gold stones and you took your own sweet time! You didn’t eat rice? I say, you good-for-nothing, what use do you have? Why don’t you go and die?”

A Seventh Firmament Divine Lord supervisor held a whip in his hands, landing it viciously on a burly man.

That lashing was deep until bone could be seen.

Bang!

He still did not vent his anger like this and followed up with a kick onto that burly man’s body, directly kicking him flying.

When the burly man landed on the ground, he immediately vomited out a large mouthful of fresh blood.

A dozen over miscellaneous affairs disciples stood in front of that supervisor, each and every one incomparably respectful. No one dared to come forward.

The supervisor was wearing the outfit of Heavenly Heart Peak’s disciples. He was very eye-catching.

Han Yong struggled to stand up, gaze looking at the supervisor coldly, clenching his jaws tightly.

“Yoo, temper isn’t small! Still dare to glare at me? I’ll make you stare!”

Smack!

Another whip lashed over. The flesh on Han Yong’s face was taken out, looking gruesome and savage.

That supervisor’s technique was clearly extremely accomplished. The divine essence used was just right. This whip landing would not kill people, but it would absolutely flay apart skin and flesh, with the pain penetrating into the marrows.

Han Yong had a dark expression as he gritted his teeth and said, “Du Zichuan, I went up the mountain to deliver heavy gold stones, but I just happened to run into Li Jinyao. Then he made me go do stuff. You dare say that this wasn’t arranged by you?”

Du Zichuan said angrily when he heard that, “Insolent thing, a mere miscellaneous affairs disciple actually dares to slander an outer-sect disciple! Have you eaten a bear’s heart or leopard’s gall?”

Smack!

Finished talking, it was another whipping.

Du Zichuan said disdainfully, “Do you think that you’re still that high and mighty genius disciple? You’re merely a good-for-nothing now! A complete and utter trash! Hahaha ...”

With Han Yong being seriously injured by Zhong Hanlin that time, even though he went through a period of healing, he was already unable to return to his peak state.

The current Han Yong’s realm fell drastically and only had Third Firmament Divine Lord cultivation.

So in front of Du Zichuan, he did not have the strength to retaliate at all.

Han Yong had a dark look on his face as he gritted his teeth and said, “You lackey, if you have the capabilities, kill me! Otherwise, there will come a day where you’ll regret it!”

He had a stubborn temper. Although he was humiliated in all kinds of ways, he never gave in.

Du Zichuan laughed loudly and said, “Kill you? Why do I have to kill you? I’m currently happy every day; wouldn’t killing you miss out on a lot of fun? Moreover, Senior Apprentice Brother Zhong made me entertain you well! But this time, I’m really not happy anymore. So, you suffer my wrath then!”

Finished talking, Du Zichuan’s whip landed on Han Yong’s body like a venomous snake’s tongue flashing out.

This guy was clearly a master of torturing people. Each lash landing, the flesh and skin on Han Yong’s body would be taken out.

This was not fatal, but it was even more horrible than death.

Han Yong was beaten until he kept rolling on the ground, but refused to make any bit of sound, forcefully enduring it.

Smack!

The whip sounded out but did not land this time.

Du Zichuan’s expression changed. He only felt a blur before his eyes, and a person suddenly appeared in front of him.

That person grabbed the whip firmly in his hand. No matter how Du Zichuan tried to move his whip, he was unable to pull it out.

Du Zichuan’s face flushed red from exertion as he said, “L-Let go!”

A cold light glinted in Ye Yuan’s eyes, his wrist lightly shaking, and the whip slipped out of his hand.

Du Zichuan was startled inwardly and said with a grim expression, “Who ... Who are you, to dare act wildly on my Heavenly Heart Peak? Do ... Do you know who I am?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I know. You’re Zhong Hanlin’s lackey!”

Du Zichuan’s face changed. How could he still not know that Ye Yuan was here to find trouble.

But he was used to running amuck every single day by relying on the fact that he was a member of the Soaring Flower lineage. Hence, he did not take Ye Yuan seriously.

Merely an outer-sect disciple that he had not seen before, did he still dare to challenge the Soaring Flower lineage?

“I ... I’m warning you. I’m a member of the Soaring Flower lineage, if you dare to touch me, you won’t have a good end!” Du Zichuan appeared tough outward but was timid inward as he threatened Ye Yuan.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he smiled. “If you didn’t say that you’re a member of the Soaring Flower lineage, I might still pull my punches with you. But now ... you’ll die very horribly!”

Ye Yuan and the Soaring Flower lineage’s conflict had a long history. This guy actually used this to threaten him, truly, the evil that we bring upon ourselves was the hardest to bear!

However, Ye Yuan did not immediately do anything to him, but bent over and inspected Han Yong.

Han Yong already fainted from the pain. Currently, his body seemed to have blossomed, skin flayed open and flesh torn, not an intact spot on his body from head to tie.

The fury in Ye Yuan’s heart had long already burst through the fence. Fishing out a medicinal pill, he stuffed it into Han Yong’s mouth and used divine essence to help him process it.

When Du Zichuan saw this scene, he took the chance when Ye Yuan was not paying attention, wanting to slip away.

However, the moment his figure moved, a force already arrived through the air!

Bang!

The back of Du Zichuan’s legs were struck, causing him to directly kneel down.

Ye Yuan grasped it very accurately. Du Zichuan’s legs already completely lost feeling now. He was completely unable to run anymore.

“Don’t be in a hurry. It hasn’t started yet, run for what?” Ye Yuan’s nonchalant voice seemed to have come from the underworld, making him feel a chill run down his spine.

He wanted to run, but he could not run!

Very soon, Han Yong slowly woke up. The injuries on his body were already recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It was all some flesh wound, while it was painful, it was not a big deal.

Of course, it was also that Ye Yuan came in the nick of time. Otherwise, it would be hard to say.

“Y-Ye Yuan! You ... You actually didn’t die!”

When Han Yong opened his eyes and saw Ye Yuan, he could not help looking shocked.

Ever since 200 years ago, with Baili Qingyan playing a melody on the zither on Firecloud Peak, everyone already knew that Ye Yuan died.

But Ye Yuan was actually standing in front of him alive now.

No, wait, 200 years’ time, breaking through from a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord to becoming a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, what ... what was this speed?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Some things, talk again later. Right now, we will be avenging grievances if there are, taking revenge if there’s grudge!”

As he said, Ye Yuan passed the whip to Han Yong.

Han Yong was taken aback and immediately understood.

These few years, he was tormented by Du Zichuan till the verge of death.

Many times, he wished to commit suicide but endured it.

He was someone with a very tough and tenacious personality, he still pulled through in the end.

Even though he knew that it was difficult to recover to his peak again, he always held onto that glimmer of hope.

Han Yong received the whip and said through gnashed teeth, “Ye Yuan, thank you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “We’re brothers, thanking me for what? This is merely a small fry. So hurry up and finish him off! Do you dare to make a scene with me?”

Han Yong’s expression changed, immediately guessing what Ye Yuan wanted to do.

He gritted his teeth and said, “I’m already like this, what’s not to dare? Even if I can’t return to the peak, this grudge, I have to avenge it too! It’s just that ... it will drag you down like this!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Drag me down? Heh heh, my enmity with the Soaring Flower lineage has long been irreconcilable hatred already!”

Han Yong was stunned and suddenly nodded and said, “You’re not even scared, what am I afraid of? But this Du Zichuan, I must vent this frustration properly today!”

Finished talking, Han Yong slowly walked over toward Du Zichuan.

Du Zichuan’s expression changed and he threatened, “Han Yong, you good-for-nothing! Do ... Do you dare to hit me?”

Han Yong smiled coldly and said, “Are you stupid? Not hitting you these few years was because I couldn’t beat you! Otherwise, you’d have long died ten thousand times! Now, my brother is here. So you just savor it well!”
