Chapter 2131: Oh, Is That So?

“Huhu, belong to you?”

Ye Yuan laughed from extreme fury, but his words were full of killing intent.

Lu-er was Ye Yuan’s reverse scale.

For her, Ye Yuan did not even stint to employ the Heaven Shocking Lightning.

Now, this Long Hao actually provoked in his face like this, how could he not be furious?

But Long Hao was not aware of it at all. He said with a smug look, “That’s right, belong to me! You might not know who I am. I’m ... cough, cough, cough ...”

Long Hao’s words were just said halfway when his voice suddenly cut off, like a duck that had its throat clutched.

Ye Yuan’s both hands already clutched onto his neck.

A tremendous force came over. Long Hao felt like his neck was going to be twisted off, his face flushing bright red, eyes rolling back.

“Just now, you said that they belong to you?” Ye Yuan’s words did not carry the slightest emotion, the force from his hands becoming greater and greater.

His present fleshy body’s strength already reached peak rank six. How tremendous was his strength?

In front of a perfect sixth transformation golden body, even if Long Hao was of the dragon race, he did not have any leftover strength to resist at all too.

By the side, a young man said, “Human brat, you dare to act wildly in my Dragon Clan’s territory? Let go of Long Hao. Otherwise ... you’re dead for sure today!”

Thud!

“Cough, cough, cough ...”

Long Hao landed on the ground, holding his neck as he started coughing fiercely.

When everyone saw the situation, they even thought that Ye Yuan yielded.

The other young man said, “Heh, at least you’re sensible, kid! It isn’t your turn to act wildly here!”

“This Ye has just come to your esteemed land. I don’t wish to bring trouble to myself. The three of you, kowtow and admit your fault to Lu-er and Senior Apprentice Sister Fei-er, and this matter ... will be dropped,” Ye Yuan completely ignored the other party and said coolly.

Listening to the first half of the sentence, everyone even thought that Ye Yuan was scared and yielded.

But hearing the second half, everyone could not help finding it funny.

Making these three people kneel down and kowtow? How was this possible?

“This human brat really doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Long Hao is Protector Elder Long Chi’s grandson. Who dares to provoke him in this Raindragon Stronghold?”

“This human kid succeeded in sneak attacking just now. He probably isn’t clear yet about Long Hao, the three of their strengths!”

“Long Hao is the young generation’s pinnacle genius. Just half a step and he’ll be able to reach rank seven, Empyrean Realm! This kid will likely suffer some hardship!”

... ...

When everyone around heard Ye Yuan’s words, they could not help shaking their heads.

By relying on his grandfather, no one dared to provoke Long Hao in Raindragon Stronghold.

The other two people, Long Fei and Long Cheng, were also both Raindragon Stronghold’s elders’ grandsons.

These three people’s backgrounds were extremely powerful. Who dared to provoke?

Moreover, with these three people joining hands, if an Empyrean did not come out, there was virtually no match.

Earlier, Ye Yuan just relied on his speed and defeated his opponent with a surprise move, controlling Long Hao. That was all.

Now, Long Hao had his guard up, everyone did not feel that he had high chances of winning.

When Lu-er and Yang Fei-er saw Yang Fei-er, their hearts immediately became much calmer.

Arriving at East Suppression Pseudo World, the local customs and practices here were greatly different from the outside world.

Under their curiosity, the two of them came out to take a look early in the morning.

Who knew that they had just stepped out not long and ran into Long Hao three people.

Long Hao three people had their lust aroused at the sight of them and actually wanted to make a move against the two of them. Lu-er and Yang Fei-er naturally disobeyed. That was how there was this current situation.

Lu-er pulled the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves and said softly, “Young Master, better forget it. This place ... This place is the Dragon Clan’s territory after all.”

She and Yang Fei-er were not worried about Long Hao, but this place was the Dragon Clan’s territory. If really blow matters up, they had nowhere to run.

After all, everyone knew about the might of the Dragon Clan.

“Making them kowtow is already considered letting them off! Otherwise ... humph!” Ye Yuan said with a cold snort.

“Kowtow? I kowtow your f*cking head! Long Fei, Long Cheng, attack together! Exterminate him for me!”

Long Hao roared and suddenly threw a palm out.

Universe Dragon Claw third stance, Grand Universe Palm!

Currently, Long Hao was extremely near Ye Yuan. Him using a heaven-shocking martial technique like the Grand Universe Palm this near to Ye Yuan, how horrifying was the power?

Long Fei and Long Cheng’s reactions were also extremely fast, firing out a palm at the same time.

Three great peak rank six powerhouses attacking at the same time, the commotion was extremely shocking.

However, Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and said in a solemn voice, “Looks like you guys are courting deaths yourselves!”

Grand Universe Palm!

At this time, Ye Yuan made his move fiercely. It was actually the Grand Universe Palm too!

Except, the moment Ye Yuan’s Grand Universe Palm was executed, it was as if space solidified.

The power of his palm actually completely overshadowed the three people!

Bang!

A loud bang came over, the three people flew out at the same time.

Ye Yuan’s palm repelled three great peak rank six dragons!

Everyone looked at this scene dumbfounded with their tongues tied, faces full of disbelief.

“How is this possible? He actually knows the Grand Universe Palm too!”

“Why is his Grand Universe Palm’s power even above Long Hao’s?”

... ...

Beyond the shock, everyone was more puzzled.

Ye Yuan’s Grand Universe Palm was actually even stronger than Long Hao’s!

One had to know, among the Raindragon Stronghold’s young generation, Long Hao’s strength was already the strongest!

Apart from Long Xiaochun, nobody was his match at all.

Now, Ye Yuan fought one-versus-three and actually utterly trounced his opponents. It was simply inconceivable.

Long Hao being blown flying with one punch, his innards already suffered a shock, fresh blood spurting wildly.

He looked at Ye Yuan with a look of astonishment and said in disbelief, “You ... How do you know the Grand Universe Palm?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was icy-cold and was completely disinclined to bother with him.

Bang!

Another Grand Universe Palm!

This palm actually flew toward Long Fei, directly bombarding him into dregs!

Everyone opened their mouths wide with disbelieving faces.

Ye Yuan actually dared to kill people!

Long Fei was Elder Long Yu’s son? Was this guy mad?

Ye Yuan did not hesitate. Raising his hand, it was another palm!

Long Cheng was dead!

In a twinkle, Ye Yuan actually killed Long Fei and Long Cheng, these two mighty young powerhouses.

Then, he slowly walked over toward Long Hao.

Long Hao’s expression changed drastically, a look of fear finally revealing on his face. He collapsed on the ground and shifted backward, saying tremblingly, “You ... What do you want to do? I ... I’m Protector Elder Long Chi’s grandson!”

“Oh, is that so? I gave you the chance, it was you who didn’t grasp it yourself! Since that’s the case, go and die then!”

Ye Yuan said nonchalantly, a palm lifting up once more.

The surroundings were deathly silent. This guy was really a lunatic!

A horrifying power gathered at Ye Yuan’s palm.

Long Hao’s complexion turned pale. He used all the strength in his body and suddenly scurried into the distance.

Ye Yuan just laughed coldly. Competing on speed, who could beat him?

But right at this time, a powerful to the extreme aura suddenly descended.

Clearly, the commotion here already startled Raindragon Stronghold’s upper echelon.

“Child, you dare?! Stop at once! This Empyrean will spare your life!” An alarmed and angry voice came from above the void.

“It’s Long Hao’s father, Empyrean Long Yu!”

“He arrived, this human kid is dead for sure!”

“Long Hao is really blessed! Luckily, Empyrean Long Yu arrived in time, he can escape death.”

When Long Hao heard his father’s voice, he could not help being overjoyed.

“Hahaha ... Kid, my father has arrived! With this, you’re dead for sure!” Long Hao turned around and said with a wild laugh.

“Oh, is that so?” Right at this time, an icy-cold voice sounded in his ear.
