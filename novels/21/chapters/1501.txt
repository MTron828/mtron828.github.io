1505 Consequences of Offending a Master

“Are you satisfied now? Sigh, Big Sister has never suffered such a big loss before being this hall master,” Yi Han said with bitterness on her face.

Ye Yuan did not want to get too entangled on this topic, so he said, “Lord Hall Master coming personally, you should have a notion about the other half of the favor, right?”

Yi Han laughed, her breath smelling like orchids, as she said, “Sly and cunning, can’t hide anything from you!”

Ye Yuan did not follow up, quietly waiting for Yi Han to continue speaking.

“Our Blood Yama Hall discovered an ancient ruin. It’s too bad that that ruin, only those below the Fiend Lord Realm can enter. Moreover, Fiend General Realms can’t exceed 1000 years old. Fiend Commander Realm are not to exceed 3000 years old! At that time, Eminent Orchid Imperial City’s most elite juniors will gather there. Our Capone Capital City’s Fiend General Realms only have one spot. Therefore, the strongest person has to go. And that person is you!” Yi Han said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “So that’s why you guided Ka Xin and my deathmatch in secret. It’s to see who has the qualifications to enter the ancient ruins?”

Yi Han also smiled and said, “This is the world of the strong. Weaklings ... will only be eliminated!”

When saying this, Ye Yuan finally felt that this one in front of him was a ruler who dominated a region.

In front of her, those that had no value to be exploited could be abandoned at any time.

He was merely a chess piece in her hands.

Ye Yuan said without batting an eyelid, “When is it starting?”

Yi Han said, “One year later, I’ll come and find you. You still have a lot of room for improvement in the Fiend General Realm. This period of time, set aside the matter of medicinal pills, use it on improving your strength.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, showing an expression that he understood.

Sending away Yi Han, Ye Yuan could not help but ponder.

This trip to the fiend race, his goal had already been achieved. Originally, he was already not planning on staying.

It was just that Ye Yuan did not expect that he actually attracted the attention of the Blood Yama Hall’s hall master.

Since Yi Han chose him, his every movement and action was under her control.

Wanting to escape from under the hands of a Fiend Lord powerhouse was virtually impossible.

As for the blood essence contract, Ye Yuan did not think anything of it at all.

That thing was indeed very ingenious. To others, it had a fatal binding power.

But to Ye Yuan, it was totally useless.

Ye Yuan had refined the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. Wanting to use this kind of contract power to deal with Ye Yuan was simply nothing more than wishful thinking.

How could Ye Yuan possibly put his fate in the hands of others?

The reason why he caused a bit of difficulty was to put on an act for Yi Han to see, let her feel that he was very apprehensive of this blood essence contract.

Looking at it now, the effect was pretty good.

It was just that this trip to the ancient ruins was most likely imperative.

...

These few days made Kong Xiao very depressed.

Only afterward did he learn that Wu Hao and Metalheart sent people to Capone Fiend Medicine Hall first to make a trip. They discovered that Capone Capital City’s Fiend Medicine Hall’s level was already no longer what it was long ago.

How astute were Wu Hao and Metalheart? How could they still not know Master Source Night’s prowess?

For half a month, these two fellows stayed at the Fiend Medicine Hall every day and did not come out.

These two guys had clearly long known, and they actually tricked him!

At first, Kong Xiao thought, no matter how awesome this master was, could he still not listen to the hall master?

The matter that two great hall masters settled on was not up to Source Night to turn down.

Who knew that when he went to request an audience with the hall master, their hall master directly said that she could not influence Master Source Night’s decision either.

Since he offended Master Source Night, then it would depend on his fortunes.

With this, Kong Xiao really despaired!

An existence that even the hall master could not control, then how incredible was his alchemy skills?

Right at this time, another heavyweight news came. Meng Qi of the Fiend Medicine Hall’s five elders successfully broke through, and he already became a Three-star Fiend Apothecary!

This news, regardless of whether in Capone Fiend Medicine Hall or to the other capital cities’ Fiend Medicine Halls, was a heavyweight bombshell.

Meng Qi was a veteran Two-star Fiend Apothecary and already stopped at this realm for 10 thousand years.

If barring no accidents, he would remain at this realm in this lifetime.

But now, he actually broke through!

If this had nothing to do with Master Source Night, they would not believe even if they were beaten to death as well.

Staying for a long time in Capone Capital City, some news naturally spread among the fiend apothecaries.

Master Source Night had merely preached about the Dao for the Fiend Medicine Hall’s people for the greater part of a year.

More than half a year’s time groomed a Three-star Fiend Apothecary?

This Master Source Night simply transformed the foul and rotten into the rare and ethereal!

Kong Xiao regretted until his intestines were green now. Looking around as one group after another of fellow professionals arrived, he was burning with anxiety.

This was the mission that upstairs ordered. If other people returned fully-loaded, but he returned empty-handed because he offended Master Source Night, this responsibility of his was not small.

Seeing Ye Yuan arrive at the Fiend Medicine Hall unhurriedly, Kong Xiao immediately went up to greet him.

“Haha, Master Source Night, you’re here,” Kong Xiao bowed as he said with a fawning smile.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over him and walked past him expressionlessly.

Kong Xiao knew that this round was not easy to clear. He did not mind either, following Ye Yuan into the Fiend Medicine Hall subserviently.

“Master, that day, it was all me who had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai, hope that a great man like you don’t stoop to harbor grievance for past wrongs,” Kong Xiao said.

With Ye Yuan entering the Fiend Medicine Hall, there were already a lot of people waiting to request for pills.

He came before his exclusive medicinal cauldron and said coolly, “Words that had been said before, water that had been spilled, I won’t take them back! Blackjade Capital City’s Fiend Medicine Hall has already been blacklisted. If they are here, everyone doesn’t need to wait here anymore in the future.”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Everyone’s gazes immediately gathered on Kong Xiao’s face.

Kong Xiao’s expression also became extremely ugly all at once and said in a solemn voice, “Master Source Night, must you leave no room for maneuver?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “People have to pay a price for their actions. Yesterday, if I crippled you with a sword, then say sorry to you today, will you agree? Therefore, please do as you please.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wu Hao had already hung out with Yi Mo for quite a few days. He was already astonished by Yi Mo’s alchemy skill.

Yi Mo’s alchemy skill, he was aware of it, just a bit worse than his.

But now, Yi Mo’s alchemy standard already surpassed him all-round!

This discovery made Wu Hao inexplicably shocked.

More than half a year, Yi Mo’s strength actually had such great improvement. This was simply a joke.

The advancement of alchemy skills, who did not grind it out using time?

Half a year’s time, even if there was progress, it would be negligible too.

But Yi Mo’s improvement was too obvious!

No wonder when seeing Source Night this Three-star Fiend Apothecary, even Yi Mo, this Three-star Fiend Apothecary, was incomparably respectful.

Now, it was his, Wu Hao’s turn, to perform!

“Kong Xiao, not that I’m criticising you, but what you said that day was too much! Since Master Source Night said to blacklist you, could it be that you want to smack the master’s face in front of so many people? Please leave! Otherwise, you’re offending everyone present!” Wu Hao said in a solemn voice.

Metalheart also immediately stood up and said, “Kong Xiao, please go out! Do you want to cause so many people to not see the master refine pills because of you alone?”
