Chapter 2561: Lin Lan’s Astonishing Move!

“Golden pill! Ninth grade golden pill!”

In the crowd, a series of strange cries came over.

What Tang Yu held in his hand was actually a shining golden medicinal pill!

No need to appraise it. It was naturally a ninth grade golden pill!

By the side, Tang Jinhua was dumbfounded.

He even thought that Ye Yuan forgot about his son and was brimming with resentment in his heart.

Who knew that Ye Yuan actually gave his son a ninth grade golden pill!

“Father, I said it right? Big Brother won’t forget me! Him refining pills for those people previously was merely used for practice!” Tang Yu said.

After so many years, he already knew Ye Yuan very well.

Since Ye Yuan refined the Jasper Regeneration Pill, he definitely would not forget about him.

Therefore, when Tang Jinhua was complaining just now, Tang Yu also made him hold his horses.

Sure enough, the best one was saved for him!

“Thank you, Big Brother!” Tang Yu said to Ye Yuan respectfully.

“This is what you deserve!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

The others were all incredibly envious.

Being able to become friends with Master Ye was truly an incomparably blissful thing!

“Master Nation Teacher, are you convinced or not?” Ye Yuan looked at Lin Lan and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Lin Lan had long already been dumbfounded by Ye Yuan’s alchemy technique!

Convinced or not?

Of course, he was convinced!

Someone capable of refining the Jasper Regeneration Pill to the realm of ninth grade golden pill, could he still be unconvinced?

He was also someone who pursued the alchemy path. It was just that he became content with retaining sovereignty over the remote land of Eastward Country, holding great power and authority, and had long already lost his original aspirations!

This defeat was undeniable, completely and thoroughly!

He turned around to leave quietly without saying anything.

Someone saw that Nation Teacher left the city, no one knew where he had gone.

The emperor did not urge him to stay either. He knew that Lin Lan’s defeat could be said to be all hope being dashed to pieces.

“Watching Master Ye refine pills today is truly immensely shocking! We want to formally establish Ye Yuan as the nation teacher. I wonder if Master Ye can agree to it?”

Finished speaking, the emperor actually gave a deep bow to Ye Yuan in public!

This was the highest level of courtesy!

The current Qiao Kaiyuan was inviting Ye Yuan, not fulfilling his wager agreement!

But no one felt that there was anything wrong.

Ye Yuan was worthy of it!

Just based on Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength, what did a nation teacher count for?

In fact, Ye Yuan being a nation teacher was still considered condescending to take a post offered already!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Since Your Majesty is so courteous, then this Ye will accept deferentially rather than to decline courteously!”

… …

When one man attained Dao, his fowls and dogs ascended to heaven too.

Ye Yuan’s domineering rise let the Tang Family become Eastward’s number one major family in one bound!

The Tang Family’s forces spread throughout the entire Eastward Country very soon.

The emperor also officially announced to the outside world that Second Prince became the crown prince, and would inherit the rule in three years.

The likes of the Yang Family, Jiang Yu, and Lu Yun, their statuses also rose along with him in Eastward Country.

Just as everyone thought that the waves had subsided, another incident caused a stir in the entire Eastward.

One early morning half a month later, the sky was just getting bright.

“Eh,?why is someone kneeling in front of Nation Teacher Manor?”

“Huhu,?what’s strange about this? Ever since Master Ye became the nation teacher, there has been an endless stream coming to request for pills. I reckon that this person is here to seek pills too, right?”

“That’s not right, you look at him, why does he look like Nation Teacher?”

“Nation Teacher? Are you blind? Why would Nation Teacher be kneeling in front of his own house?”

“My God, I’m not talking about Nation Teacher Ye; it’s Nation Teacher Lin! Lin Lan!”

“Mn??I-It’s true! T-This is going to be a big thing! Master Lin actually left and returned, and even knelt in front of the Nation Teacher Manor!”

… …

Waiting until dawn, in front of Nation Teacher Manor’s gates was long already surrounded until not even water could seep through. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The former nation teacher kneeling in front of the current nation teacher’s door. This kind of thing, wanting to not cause a stir would not do either!

Regarding this sort of thing, there naturally could not avoid people gesticulating.

But Lin Lan was not the slightest bit moved and just knelt straight like that.

Tang Yu walked out of Nation Teacher Manor, looked at Lin Lan, and said with a frown, “What is Master Lin doing this for?”

At present, Tang Yu’s severed arm had already grown out and was no different from an ordinary person.

Furthermore, after he took the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, his strength also advanced by leaps and bounds, breaking through to upper Lesser Sublime Heaven.

After Ye Yuan moved into Nation Teacher Manor, Tang Yu handed all of the family affairs to Tang Jinhua to manage. He willingly came to Nation Teacher Manor and became the chief steward.

When Lin Lan heard that, he just said coolly, “I’m here to acknowledge him as my master!”

“Acknowledge as your master?” When Tang Yu heard that, he could not help opening his eyes wide.

The exalted former Nation Teacher, a grade two heavenly alchemist, was here to acknowledge a master?

The surrounding crowd was also ignited by these few words!

“A-Acknowledge master? Did I hear wrongly?”

“What a joke! Isn’t Master Lin implacable enemies with Master Ye? He would actually put aside his ego and kneel in front of Master Ye’s door to acknowledge master?!”

“This Master Ye wouldn’t be wanting to swallow humiliation and bear a heavy burden, and harm Master Ye, right?”

“Very likely!”

… …

No one would have thought that the Lord Nation Teacher who had once looked down on Eastward could actually put aside his ego and kneel down in public to acknowledge Ye Yuan as his master!

This impact was really too strong.

Even someone as clever as Tang Yu felt at a loss for some time too.

“Quickly go, quickly go! Lord Nation Teacher, if you keep making trouble, don’t blame me for not being courteous!” Tang Yu instinctively thought that this guy was here to make trouble and directly chased him away.

Lin Lan still had a calm expression and said coolly, “As you please! Not seeing Ye Yuan, this old man won’t leave!”

Tang Yu’s brows furrowed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “You came deliberately to cause trouble?”

Lin Lan ignored Tang Yu and fell silent.

Tang Yu gave a cold snort and said, “Lin Lan, don’t think that because you’re a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, no one can take care of you in this imperial city! Let me tell you, Master Yun is in Nation Teacher Manor right now. He has already broken through to middle Greater Sublime Heaven!”

Hearing this, a hint of surprise flashed across in Lin Lan’s eyes.

However, this hint of surprise was gone very quickly!

When Tang Yu saw that Lin Lan was impervious to reason, he simply called Lu Yun and a bunch of helpers.

With Lu Yun around, his confidence was immediately bolstered significantly.

After Lu Yun took the ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, his foundation was consolidated a great deal.

His strength also advanced by leaps and bounds, breaking through the shackles in one stroke, reaching middle Greater Sublime Heaven!”

“Come, men! Chase him away for me!” Tang Yu said in a solemn voice.

A group of people pushed and shoved, attempting to push Lin Lan away.

But he did not budge an inch.

It was naturally impossible for Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums to move a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

But Lin Lan did not retaliate.

A guard got impatient and directly kicked a foot on his body, he still did not fight back.

“Stop!” When Lu Yun saw this scene, his brows could not help furrowing slightly.

He came before Lin Lan and said, “You really want to acknowledge Ye Yuan as your master?”

Lin Lan said, “My mind is made up!”

Lu Yun frowned and said, “Why should I trust you?”

Lin Lan said coolly, “It’s useless to say anymore. I’ll use action to prove it!”

Lu Yun discovered that Lin Lan seemed to have become somewhat different.

He felt that Lin Lan seemed to have let go of everything, even his entire person becoming much lighter.

No sorrow or joy, no arrogance nor restlessness!

This Lin Lan seemed to have become a different person from the Lin Lan that he knew before!

It was impossible for this kind of temperament to be feigned.

“Okay, I’ll go and inform Nation Teacher! As for whether he’ll meet you or not, it’s not something I can control anymore!” Lu Yun said.
