Chapter 2469: Dao of Devouring!

Ye Yuan looked toward the arrival and could not help being slightly surprised.

His chaos origin divinity’s perception was extremely strong, this person naturally could not escape his perception.

It was just that this person’s appearance surprised him greatly.

This person was actually Medicine Ancestor’s eldest disciple, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy!

If Medicine Ancestor appeared here, Ye Yuan would not be surprised at all.

But the one who appeared was actually Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy.

This eldest disciple who looked a little simple and honest was without any sharp edge to speak of.

Back then when Cloudheart Realm collapsed, those Medicine Ancestor’s disciples that died had died, while those who fled had fled. They had long since disappeared without a trace.

Who knew that today, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy actually appeared in front of him.

Ye Yuan looked at Lastingjoy and said, “Brother Lastingjoy seems … to no longer be what you used to be! You followed us along the way and actually hid from the Dao Ancestors’ perception!”

Lastingjoy had his hands behind his back as he said with a smile, “Didn’t I fail to hide from Lord Saint Azure’s perception? It really surprises this emperor. Lord Saint Azure is actually so powerful, where even Dao Ancestors can’t kill you!”

These few years, Lastingjoy had been in closed-seclusion inside a small world all along.

All the way until the recent few years, Lastingjoy returned to the Heavenspan World and transcended the Deva Fifth Blight.

At present, Medicine Ancestor’s Alchemy Dao was already completely digested by him.

His strength was already just a step away from the realm of Dao pill.

Therefore, he prepared to go and find the last target for devouring, Ye Yuan!

As long as he devoured Ye Yuan, he would surely be able to reach the realm of Dao pill!

Who would have thought that presently, the world had already changed drastically? That little fellow who provoked Medicine Ancestor back then actually transformed with a sway of his body, becoming the eternal Saint Azure!

When he got this news, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was truly incomparably shocked.

But fortunately, Ye Yuan actually fell out with the nine great Dao Ancestors. This let him find an opportunity to take advantage of. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Sure enough, he had been constantly observing the battle around Origin Enlighten Mountain Range this time, and he finally found an opportunity.

Ye Yuan’s divine soul actually went out of his body!

Hence, he tagged along all the way, following until here.

But along the way, it shocked him until he stared dumbfoundedly with his mouth agape.

Six great Dao Ancestors took turns to attack, decimating Ye Yuan dozens of times, but Ye Yuan’s divine soul was actually completely fine!

This sort of thing was simply too insane!

He lived to a ripe old age and had never seen such a crazy thing.

Unkillable!

But very soon, Lastingjoy went from shock to wild ecstasy.

What his Dao of Devouring primarily targeted was the divine soul.

If he could absorb Ye Yuan’s divine soul, then wouldn’t he achieve an undying body?

In the future, what did Dao Ancestors count for?

Presently, the world had changed greatly, Dao Ancestors were no longer such unreachable existences.

Didn’t that pig take down a Dao Ancestor?

Ye Yuan looked at Lastingjoy and said with a smile,?“Huhu,?Brother Lastingjoy seems to be very interested in this Ye.”

Lastingjoy did not hide it either, nodding as he said, “You and I both take Alchemy Dao as the highest pursuit. Lastingjoy is naturally interested in you. The last time in Cloudheart Realm, this emperor actually really wanted to exchange blows with Younger Brother Ye. It’s just a pity that at that time, Master already gave the order. Hence, Lastingjoy didn’t have that fortune. Wonder if Younger Brother Ye can satisfy Lastingjoy’s long-cherished wish?”

Ye Yuan was a little surprised in his heart. Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy took such a huge risk to tag along. It was in order to compete in alchemy with him?

He did not believe it even if he was beaten to death!

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy looked very honest and sincere, but when Ye Yuan faced him, he always had a dangerous feeling.

Ye Yuan did not agree immediately, but asked, “I remember that back then, you should have escaped Cloudheart Realm together with Medicine Ancestor. Where is he?”

Lastingjoy beamed and said nonchalantly, “Dead!”

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth twitched slightly. This guy said it so casually!

His own master died, it was as if he was talking about a casual matter.

However, Medicine Ancestor was a fierce and ambitious person of his generation. He was indeed a rare talent of the alchemy path.

But he did not expect that in the end, he actually ended up in such a plight.

No need to think, Ye Yuan also guessed what happened between the master and apprentice.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was that sort of treacherous person who seemed loyal.

Looked very honest and simple, harmless to man and beast, but was actually very dangerous.

This sort of person made people stay on alert the most.

In Cloudheart Realm, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s sense of existence was not strong. In fact, it was inferior to his junior apprentice brother, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook.

But in the end, it was still him who had the last laugh!

Lastingjoy smiled and said, “Younger Brother Ye is a clever man. This emperor won’t beat around the bush anymore. This emperor has already obtained all of Master’s inheritance and is only half a step away from being able to reach the realm of Dao pill! This emperor needs a powerful opponent to help me to take this step. I wonder if Younger Brother Ye can grant my wish?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “You’re really just looking for me to compete in alchemy?”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy could not help laughing as he said, “If I wanted to be detrimental to Younger Brother Ye, I’d have long made a move. Why bother to waste my breath with you? Moreover, about Younger Brother Ye’s divine soul, even Dao Ancestors can kill you. Are you still afraid of me taking action?”

Without thinking, Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Sorry, I don’t compete in alchemy with people who betray their master!”

After he finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around to leave.

But right then, the sky suddenly darkened.

A huge suction force actually grabbed Ye Yuan’s chaos origin divinity, making him unable to break free!

His movement technique was actually unable to be executed.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, turning around to look at Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy.

It was only to see that behind him, an enormous black wheel disc was spinning quietly.

That terrifying suction force was emitted by precisely this huge wheel disc.

This wheel disc seemed to be able to devour everything!

“Huhu,?since you refuse a toast only to drink to a forfeit, then this emperor can only invite you to drink to a forfeit! This is my Dao, the Dao of Devouring! There are already 35,078 people who have died under my Dao of Devouring! Among them include Medicine Ancestor, that old fogey. As long as I devour you, this emperor will be able to corroborate my Dao, and I will reach the realm of Dao Pill!” Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was still talking with a smile on his face, just like a Maitreya Buddha.

It was just that his smile became incomparably evil now.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, feeling that his divine soul was actually being sucked over involuntarily.

What a powerful divine soul power!

His chaos origin divinity could resist the might of Dao Ancestors and not die, but it was actually unable to resist this terrifying devouring power!

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s divine soul was the most powerful divine soul that Ye Yuan had seen so far.

Ye Yuan felt that even if his divine essence was not as good as the chaos origin divinity, it was also not much worse.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy had devoured too many divine souls and turned them for his own use. This made his divine soul grow to an unimaginable level.

Coupled with his bizarre and unpredictable power of Great Dao, it actually gave him an extremely dangerous feeling.

No wonder Medicine Ancestor that fellow would actually die at Lastingjoy’s hands.

If taken by surprise, how could Medicine Ancestor resist this devouring power?

If Ye Yuan currently had his complete body, he could split Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy with one sword.

It was a shame that he was currently of a divine soul body!

Ye Yuan also did not think that in this Heavenspan World, there was actually still someone who could threaten his chaos origin divinity.

Rumble?…

A huge black hand actually reached out of that black disc and grabbed toward Ye Yuan.

That black hand seemed to have magical powers, crushing Ye Yuan until he was unable to move a muscle all over his body.

Puchi!

That black hand suddenly grabbed, plunging directly into Ye Yuan’s divine soul body.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, immediately feeling as if soul force was like floodwaters that broke the dam, flooding out!
