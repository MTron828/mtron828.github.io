Chapter 2235: Souleater Beasts

“Brother Ye, are you still alright?” Wu Jiang saw that Ye Yuan’s complexion was pale, his entire body seemingly feeble, and so he could not resist asking.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Still alright. I can still hang in there!”

Toward this Wu Jiang, it was just Ye Yuan’s first time meeting, he naturally would not feel at ease letting him know everything.

These Ghost Dao powerhouses and corpse path powerhouses because of innate reasons, were more coldblooded and violent to begin with.

It was not that there was no good person among Ghost Dao Empyreans, but Ye Yuan did not dare and was also not willing to hand his trust over to a stranger.

He had traveled all over the place for so many years. This bit of shallow logic, he still understood it.

Wu Jiang let out a sigh and said, “Brother Ye, our arms can’t wring the thighs and wind. They are Heavenly Emperor powerhouses after all. Only by enduring for some time, will there be an opportunity to escape!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “I understand, but I just can’t take this lying down!”

Wu Jiang nodded his head and continued saying, “Brother Ye is indeed a young heaven’s chosen. Your number of trump cards makes this Wu lament at my own unworthiness too!”

He was really very surprised. Just now, the divine soul power that Ye Yuan exhibited made even the Ghost Dao powerhouses who have cultivated for many years feel ashamed of their unworthiness.

One had to know, Ghost Dao powerhouses did not have physical bodies. What they cultivated was the power of the soul body!

Ye Yuan was young in age. So Wu Jiang really did not know how he did it.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s ocular arts were also extremely consummate, to actually be able to see through the unreal and see the gray shadows that even Ghost Empyreans could not see too.

Coupled with that transcendent sword art from before, this was truly a terrifying young man!

It was just a pity that he was too incapable of retaining his composure, to actually expose his strength in order to save his servant.

Furthermore, he even offended the few great Heavenly Emperors!

This journey would probably not be too pleasant.

The party gradually went deeper and the cavern got increasingly larger. The blood pools also got bigger and bigger.

It was more appropriate to say that it gradually turned into a blood lake. The thick bloody air inside made people virtually want to vomit. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Even Ye Yuan was also dumbstruck with amazement by this spectacular sight.

With his eyesight, he could naturally tell that it was all real blood in the blood pools.

Furthermore, tremendous energy was contained in this blood.

Clearly, the former owners of this blood were all extremely strong powerhouses.

So much blood, then how many powerhouses died here?

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Suddenly, several green figures tore past like lightning.

Following there, a miserable scream came over.

A Ghost Empyrean was directly dragged away by the green shadows.

But these green shadows did not go far but stopped in a cave entrance.

Ye Yuan focused his eyes and looked over, they were several kangaroo-looking little beasts.

While that Ghost Empyrean being bitten by the little beasts actually did not have the slightest strength to resist at all.

Then, those few little beasts divided up and ate that Ghost Empyrean in front of everyone just like that.

Acting recklessly and caring for nobody!

These little beasts thought nothing of so many Ghost Empyreans!

“Souleater Beasts! It’s Souleater Beasts!” Those Ghost Empyreans were all akin to facing a great enemy, retreating one after another.

While at this time, inside some of the small caves of the cavern, many of such little beasts suddenly tunneled out.

The little beasts got more and more, and actually surrounded the group of Ghost Empyreans.

Even the faces of those Heavenly Emperors were extremely ugly too.

“What are Souleater Beasts?” Ye Yuan asked with an ignorant look.

Wu Jiang said, “Souleater Beasts are the jinx of Ghost Dao powerhouses, and also the natives of the three great blood pools, feeding on soul bodies. For Ghost Dao powerhouses that run around here, once they encounter Souleater Beasts, they will die without a doubt. The saliva that they secrete has extremely strong anesthetic and digestive effects against Ghost Dao powerhouses. Ghost Dao powerhouses are unable to resist at all. Furthermore, they have the ability to traverse through space. Their speed is extremely fast and impossible to guard against. Even Heavenly Emperor powerhouses are extremely apprehensive of them too.”

Ye Yuan was enlightened when he heard. It turned out that there was still such a formidable ferocious beast.

These Souleater Beasts were simply the jinx of Ghost Dao powerhouses. But to corpse path powerhouses and humans, they were nothing much.

They practically only lived in the three great blood pools.

Because this place had large quantities of soul bodies.

Whoosh, whoosh!

Another dozen over Souleater Beasts suddenly scurried out, the speed inconceivably swift.

Several Ghost Dao Empyreans at the outer area were frightened until their complexions were ashen, all kinds of horrifying attacks flying over.

But these Souleater Beasts were incomparably sensitive. A twinkle in the air, and they directly dodged all of these disorderly attacks.

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

... ...

Several miserable cries came over. A few Ghost Empyreans were dragged away by the Souleater Beasts just like that, who then started eating them with relish at one side.

Devouring these Ghost Dao Empyreans, the auras of those Souleater Beasts actually grew stronger at a speed visible to the naked eye!

How could those Ghost Dao Empyreans still keep their wits about them, turning tail and running?

The seven great Heavenly Emperors snorted coldly. A horrifying pressure spread out, those Empyreans went even paler.

There were wolves in front, tigers at the back, they could not run at all!

The seven great Heavenly Emperors clearly regarded the Asura abnormality this time with great importance, it was impossible to withdraw easily.

At this time, Ninelives pointed at Ye Yuan and said coldly, “You, go and finish off the Souleater Beasts!”

Everyone was stunned. Even Ye Yuan was also taken aback.

“Me? Alone?” Ye Yuan somewhat did not dare to believe it.

Ninelives nodded and said, “That’s right! You can choose to face them, or face the seven of us!”

A cold light appeared in Ye Yuan’s eyes, this Heavenly Emperor Ninelives was too much!

This guy was clearly targeting him.

The other few Heavenly Emperors all had gloating faces. Clearly, they viewed him as a different kind and were only exploiting him.

As for his life and death, they did not care at all.

Ye Yuan’s gaze flicked, and he said in a solemn voice, “Fine, I’ll go!”

Ye Yuan brandished his sword and advanced, dividing the crowd, slowly walking over toward those Souleater Beasts.

The group of Heavenly Emperors exchanged glances and smiled, hints of amused expressions revealing on their faces.

There were several dozen Souleater Beasts in front of him. They were all rank seven existences.

Normally, it should be impossible for so many rank seven Souleater Beasts to appear all of a sudden.

But the blood pool was having abnormal activities currently, these guys all scurried out one after another.

“Kill!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, his figure turning into a phantom, rushing straight for the Souleater Beasts.

What he rushed towards was just a middle-stage rank seven Souleater Beast, that Souleater Beast also charged toward Ye Yuan, a hint of scorn flashing across in its eyes.

With a squeak, it disappeared before Ye Yuan’s eyes.

Then there was a squelch.

Amidst everyone’s amazed gazes, when the Souleater Beast that originally disappeared showed its figure, the bone sword passed through its chest!

This Souleater Beast was already deader than dead.

Before dying, the Souleater Beast still opened its eyes wide to look at Ye Yuan, clearly not believing that Ye Yuan could actually kill it.

“Squeak, squeak, squeak ...”

The Souleater Beasts started braying frenziedly, turning into one glimmering afterimage after another, pouncing over toward Ye Yuan.

The claws of these Souleater Beasts were extremely sharp. Their attacks actually carried spatial law!

Even when encountering ordinary Empyreans, they likely had no opponents in the same rank too.

It was just a pity that they ran into Ye Yuan.

Apart from a few late-stage rank seven Souleater Beasts that could fight with Ye Yuan to the point they were evenly-matched, the other Souleater Beasts could not block Ye Yuan’s sword at all.

Ye Yuan’s sword was like a ghost amidst the bloody light. Areas that it passed by, it reaped the lives of Souleater Beasts without restraint.
