Chapter 1405 Harvesting

Qin Yuanlong’s expression changed several times. He naturally knew the consequences of this matter.

But Qin Nantian had long already hated Ye Yuan to the bones. This trip, the price expended in order to kill Ye Yuan was not small.

Returning empty-handed, he had no way of giving an account to Qin Nantian.

“Humph! This Qin had long found this punk displeasing to the eye, so what if kill him? From this day forth, I, Qin Yuanlong, renounce Wu Meng Capital City and turn my back on the Qin Family! Farewell!”

Done talking, Qin Yuanlong turned right around and left.

Thundercry’s expression changed, not expecting that Qin Yuanlong was actually so decisive.

“Humph! Want to leave? How can it be that easy?! Since you’ve turned your back on the Qin Family, ambushing my Wu Meng Academy’s disciple and disrupting the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, you deserve the death penalty!”

Thundercry gave a cold snort, his figure moving swiftly, charging over towards Qin Yuanlong.

Qin Yuanlong did not think that Thundercry was actually so unrelenting, speeding away into the distance with a scurry.

The two people, one chased, one fled, disappeared in everyone’s line of sight very quickly.

This series of unforeseen changes were seriously too fast, catching everyone off-guard.

In a hidden corner, Qin Tian gnashed his teeth in hatred as he watched this scene, his expression ugly to the extreme.

Failed again!

Could it be that this guy was unkillable?

Why did the Qin Family scheme meticulously and even send out an Origin Deity Realm expert, and still unable to kill him?!

Clearly just a Grotto Profound Realm rookie, so why could he not be killed?

Not only could he not be killed, the Qin Family even lost a direct lineage disciple and an Origin Deity Realm academy teacher!

This price was too heavy!

“Big Brother Qin Tian, what ... should we do?” Qin Zheng asked.

“Let’s go!” Qin Tian gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

He knew that in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, they had no chances at all already.

This match was ultimately still a complete miss!

Ye Yuan maneuvered the sword and slowly landed, saying with a light smile, “You guys, each and every one of you, can forget about running.”

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan was not long-winded either, directly sweeping a sword out, felling a large group.

How could those students who had designs on him previously still dare to stay? Each and every one scattered like birds and wild animals.

Ye Yuan hacked and killed, directly eradicating several dozen people. The remainder all ran.

Hence, Ye Yuan started cleaning up the battlefield, collecting the storage rings left behind.

This battle, the harvests were abundant.

The storage rings in his hands were more than 500 in total already.

What was even more liberating for him was that Qin Yuanlong this fellow withdrew from the Qin Family himself. It was also considered to have made the Qin Family lose a general.

This Qin Yuanlong thought that he hid very well. Actually, his every movement and action was all under Dustless’ surveillance.

When he ambushed, Ye Yuan had long made the preparations for sword maneuvering flight.

Sword maneuvering flight’s speed was very fast. Evading Qin Yuanlong’s sneak attack under the circumstances where he was prepared was nothing. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

While at this time, Jin Yu hobbled in front of Ye Yuan with the help of Qiu Shuisheng.

He took out his own storage ring, passed it to Ye Yuan, and said, “I lost! This is yours!”

Ye Yuan smiled and received the storage ring. This was his spoils of war, he had no reason to refuse it.

“I really didn’t expect that the Wu Meng Capital City actually produced a genius like you! I was defeated utterly convincedly!” Jin Yu sighed with admiration.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re very strong too! But although your laws are strong, it’s still a little weak in terms of utilization. Given time, you’re bound to be a region’s absolute ruler!”

If it were before, Ye Yuan saying these words in front of Jin Yu would definitely be thought of as crazy by people.

But now, nobody would feel brusque, even Qiu Shuisheng did not feel so too.

Ye Yuan had the qualifications to lecture Jin Yu like this!

Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao first-layered heaven had yet to reach grand completion, but he could defeat the strong with the weak. It was because his application of Sword Dao laws had reached a transcendent realm!

In this aspect, Jin Yu was not just a tiny bit worse than him.

Ye Yuan comprehending the sword in the Sword Tomb, what he comprehended was not just Sword Dao laws, he was even comprehending the stories behind the laws.

Inside the Sword Tomb, each sword had its story.

It was precisely because so that Ye Yuan could create Sundering Stars, such a powerful martial technique.

Sundering Stars was a martial technique that Ye Yuan comprehended that maximized the power of Sword Dao laws. Its degree of power could only be imagined.

Jin Yu clasped his hands and said, “Got it! Today’s battle, this Jin broadened his horizons and gleaned considerable gains! Especially the last sword move, it will probably have a tremendous impact on my life!”

Ye Yuan’s final sword was absolutely a sword that set the world on fire.

This sword, what it displayed was not just a martial technique, but the all-round strength manifestation of Ye Yuan’s Martial Dao will, laws utilization, divine essence thickness, and so on.

Rather than saying Ye Yuan won with Sundering Stars, it was better to say that Ye Yuan won with his determination to absolutely win!

If it were others, even if their strength was identical to Ye Yuan’s, they completely could not achieve that step too!

Jin Yu’s words did not have any intention of flattering. Ye Yuan’s final sword virtually subverted his understanding toward Martial Dao.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Those guys have already ran away, so I have to go hunt them down. There are quite a few storage rings in their hands. I got to go and collect them. Farewell!”

Jin Yu and Qiu Shuisheng, the two people, clasped their hands and said, “Farewell!”

Swoosh, swoosh ...

Ye Yuan casually threw out a hundred storage rings and flew straight to Qin Shao.

“Thanks, Brother!”

Qin Shao’s actions landed in his sights. Even though this guy was born in the Qin Family, he was completely different from the Qin Family’s people’s personality of seeking revenge for the smallest grievance.

He was defeated at his hands. That kind of situation just now, he still voiced out to warn, it was truly not easy.

These storage rings, just take it as a bit of thanks then.

Ye Yuan did not give Qin Shao a chance to speak, directly maneuvering the sword and flying away.

Watching Ye Yuan’s profile disappear into the horizons, Qiu Shuisheng said with a sigh, “This guy isn’t to be trifled with! Once provoked, one will probably have nightmares every day.”

Jin Yu nodded his head and said, “Avenging grievances when there are grievances, avenging enmity when there is enmity, repaying kindness when there is kindness, acting according to his nature, not violating his consciousness. This is the Dao of Might! This Ye Yuan, a measly Wu Meng Capital City probably can’t trap him!”

Qiu Shuisheng came in front of Qin Shao and said with clasped hands, “Brother, apologies! Previously, my words have offended, please don’t take offense!”

Qin Shao said coolly, “No harm! This guy’s strength is too baffling. Not truly exchanging blows with him, you forever won’t know how strong he is!”

Qiu Shuisheng secretly nodded, deeply acknowledging Qin Shao’s words too.

...

The Hundred Cities Smelting Trial was set as a year. The remaining time, all of the outer-court disciples sunk into a nightmare.

A devil who rode the wind and rode a sword might appear beside them at any time, reaping their lives.

They all knew Ye Yuan’s prowess. At the start, they all found a place and hide, not daring to come out.

But later, they discovered to their dismay that no matter how they hid, Ye Yuan could always accurately find their locations.

Hence, a massacre unfolded in the outer-court region.

Later, those people seriously could not live on in the outer-court region and could only escape to the inner-court region one after another.

However, Ye Yuan rode the sword to flow. Even when inner-court disciples saw him, they could not do anything to him at all.

Of course, there were those with good luck too, finding their senior brothers and sisters, before barely managing to preserve their lives.

In a blink, a year’s time was up. The Hundred Cities Smelting Trial was already drawing near its end.
