Chapter 1707 Next Deal

Jian Ping naturally had no reason to say no!

Even though Jian Yu was extremely reluctant, he also knew that Big Brother’s eyes were very important.

Being helpless, he could only swear the Heavenly Dao oath.

Regarding this, Zhang Haotian was extremely agitated. Pulling his daughter Zhang Xiaoran, they knelt in front of Ye Yuan with a thud.

“This old man ... This old man kneels in thanks to Sir’s grace of rebirth!’ Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Yuan hurriedly helped up Zhang Haotian father and daughter and said with a smile, “Elder is too courteous. Xiaoran is obedient and sensible. It would be a pity to be defiled by a bad guy. It’s merely a matter of lifting a finger. Elder, don’t need to take it to heart. However, your divination skill is indeed proficient. This actually all came true, huhu.”

Zhang Haotian blushed with shame. He also did not expect that Ye Yuan’s trouble was actually answered by him.

Zhang Haotian was an external surname member of the Jian Family, his bloodline very thin. But his divination was indeed very accurate.

Rather, Jian Yu listened by the side until his face turned green.

What was being defiled by a bad guy?

“Hey, do you know how to speak human language or not? What’s with that phrase being defiled by a bad guy?!” Jian Yu said in great rage.

Ye Yuan turned to look at him and said with a smile, “Saying that you’re a bad guy, you ask if they have objections?”

Jian Yu’s expression changed. Sweeping a glance over, he discovered that everyone all had approving looks and could not help saying in a great rage, “Looking at what? Keep looking and your eyeballs will be dug out!”

Everyone’s expressions changed slightly, restraining themselves.

“Pfft!” Zhang Xiaoran could not hold back and immediately laughed.

“Blabbering on for what? Still not treating my eyes?” Jian Ping said with an annoyed look.

“Also my legs!” Jian Yu added.

Ning Tianping’s blow was very heavy. It was naturally impossible to let Jian Yu to recover using divine essence.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Your legs aren’t in the deal.”

Jian Yu said furiously, “You!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “This place isn’t convenient, you bring me to the Profound Secrets Pavilion. Just nice, I want to go and see Elder Jian.”

Jian Ping gave a cold snort and directly turned around and left.

Ye Yuan brought Ning Tianping and followed closely behind.

Before long, the few people arrived at a very magnificent palace. ‘Profound Secrets Pavilion’, these three words were written on it!

“Deacon Jian, what’s wrong with you?” When the guard saw the Jian Ping shedding blood tears, he could not help coming up to greet with his face pale with fright.

Jian Ping waved his hand and said, “Nothing. Bring us to the back-hall, he’s going to treat my eyes!”

That guard hurriedly responded and brought Ye Yuan and the rest to the back-hall.

Entering a side-hall, Jian Ping instructed, “You go and guard outside, don’t let people disturb us!”

“Yes!” That guard answered and immediately went out.

“Quickly do it! I’m warning you, if any hidden ailment is left behind in my eyes, I’ll make you die very horribly! Don’t forget, this place is the Profound Secrets Pavilion!” Jian Ping said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Relax, this Ye has never failed when making a move before.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan took out silver needles and stuck needles around Jian Ping’s eyes.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Open your eyes!”

Jian Ping’s eyelids twitched and opened both eyes rather nervously.

Indeed, he could see!

He was incomparably shocked in his heart. This punk’s medical skills were truly extraordinary, to actually be able to cure the backlash of Heavenly Dao!

One had to know, Jian Zhentao’s eyes had already been blinded for almost 200 years and no one could treat it.

This kid was actually really able to cure it!

“Big Brother, you ... you can see?” Jian Yu asked rather agitatedly.

If Big Brother’s eyes were blind, he would be bound to lose his standing in the Profound Secrets Pavilion. Then he would also lose his greatest reliance.

Jian Ping nodded his head and said, “Can see!”

Finished talking, he attempted to revolve the Profound Spirit Chaos Formula and looked over toward Jian Yu. Sure enough, he saw a faint orange-colored aura.

This time, he did not dare to look at Ye Yuan anymore.

This kid was too sinister.

However ... this younger brother of his was really useless!

Piled on so much resources and he was still just first-layered heaven Divine Lord.

Orange destiny, his accomplishments in his lifetime would also be like this.

“Can see!” Jian Ping nodded his head and said.

Jian Yu said with an excited look, “Really can see! Couldn’t tell that this brat really has some capability!”

Jian Ping looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile that was not a smile, “He is capable, but ... all come in for me!”

Bang!

A large group of people burst open the door and entered, directly blocking Ye Yuan two people in this side-hall.

These people were actually all middle-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouses!

Jian Ping looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Punk, you wouldn’t really think that I’d let you off, would you? This young master can don’t find trouble with those two, but you ... must die!”

Turned out that when he entered just now, Jian Ping secretly signaled that guard and had him summon people over.

When Jian Yu saw this scene, he shouted excitedly, “Hahaha, Big Brother, kill him! Kill him! This guy is too cocky! Punk, this time, you can’t escape even if you grow wings, right?”

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Ping and said coolly, “Jian Ping, if you kill me, no one will treat Elder Jian’s eyes anymore.”

Jian Ping sneered and said, “Elder Jian? Pooh! That useless old man’s eyes are already blind. Do you think that he can still be the Profound Secrets Pavilion’s elder? Moreover ... heh heh, you probably don’t know, but that old bastard is at odds with my eldest senior brother. I’m eagerly looking forward to seeing his eyes not get better!”

Ye Yuan also did not expect that Jian Zhentao actually already lost power now because of that one glance.

Moreover, he was even on very bad terms of Jian Ping’s eldest senior brother.

Looks like the struggle of power was the same everywhere!

Just like the struggle between the Pill Tower’s head elder and second elder back then, it lasted for as long as several tens of thousands of years.

This Profound Secrets Pavilion seemed to be a place that transcended worldliness, but it also could not rise above conventions.

Places with people would have conflicts, it was indeed true.

“Haha, kid, are you feeling despair now? Kneel down and beg me, maybe ... I can still let you live!” Jian Ping laughed wantonly as he said.

Just now, on the streets, both brothers lost a huge amount of face. Now, not gaining back any ground, where would his face be put?

Ning Tianping had a mocking look on his face and did not mean to worry at all.

He knew that His Excellency definitely would not be without contingencies and just come in so recklessly.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan looked at Jian Ping very calmly and said coolly, “Alright, I understand. Next, we can discuss another transaction.”

Jian Ping was taken aback, following that, laughed loudly as he said, “Still making a deal with Your Father? Are you dumb? Now, what can you still use to make a deal with me?”

Ye Yuan said, “Forgot to tell you, but before applying acupuncture on you, I just used it to let out Zhang Haotian’s blood. And he ... was afflicted with the Flatland Poison Wolf’s poison many years ago. To this date, he was unable to get rid of it. Just now, I left in a hurry and forgot to clean the residual poison on the needles. Uh ... it’s fine, you can do it. Either way, the residual poison on the needles isn’t much, you shouldn’t die. At most, it will just be like Zhang Haotian, aging a little faster, that’s all. Also, although your eyes are fine right now, it will be hard to guarantee that they will be fine in the future.”

Ye Yuan said very calmly, but Jian Ping’s expression became increasingly uglier.
