Chapter 2401: Thrive in Calamity and Perish in Soft Living!

“Fight? How to fight ...”

Yu Tanzhi laughed coldly and wanted to shoot a sarcastic remark, but he swallowed his words back when they reached the tip of his tongue.

Ye Yuan’s current identity was different, if he did not watch his mouth again, it would not be as simple as having his strength taken back anymore.

Sure enough, Profound Secrets gave him a glance.

This glance made him feel like he fell into an ice cellar.

However, Yu Tanzhi’s question was similarly what everyone’s question was.

How to fight?

Ye Yuan slowly said, “No matter what, to battle is the best way to increase strength! Regardless of whether it is 100 years or 1000 years, how much strength can be improved will depend on our good fortunes!”

Although Ye Yuan could use time law to groom powerhouses, this would mean he would not have time to go and cultivate anymore.

Furthermore, wanting to create a small world that could accommodate thousands of martial artists would expend a great deal of energy in the first place.

Regardless of whether it was the Heavenly Hidden World back then or the current Primeval War Realm, it expended the two generations’ Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s countless manpower and material resources. It was not something that could be accomplished overnight.

This kind of method was clearly not too suitable for the current situation anymore.

Ancestor Lightning’s expression was somewhat ugly, and he said in a solemn voice, “What kind of solution is this?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Otherwise? The few of you Dao Ancestors rush to the divine race and finish off all of their progenitors?”

Ancestor Lightning’s throat choked up, and he immediately shut his mouth.

Three great Dao Ancestors taking action at the same time could not do anything to Tian Qing too. If they went, they absolutely would not gain any advantage.

This battle completely made both parties become fearful of each other.

After Shang Hang mused for a moment, he suddenly spoke up, “I feel that this idea can work! In the last Doomsday Battle, although the powerhouses on our side nearly died out, they didn’t gain any advantage either! Apart from Tian Qing, the other progenitors’ states shouldn’t have recovered to their peak yet! In terms of the number of experts, all of our races added together is ten times, even 100 times of theirs! Even if we use human lives to stack, we can also stack them to death! What we lack most here, is a combat force that is capable of fighting with Tian Qing!”

Speaking of this, Shang Hang’s expression was unprecedentedly solemn as he said, “If Tian Qing doesn’t die, even if all of the other members of the divine race are killed, it makes no difference too! His combat power is already strong until it can ignore the number of people!”

At this point, everyone’s gazes concentrated on Ye Yuan.

If there was someone here who could reach Tian Qing’s height, it would be none other than him!

The eternal Saint Azure, the legacies left behind overthrew the divine race’s rule.

Who else was there in this world?

Profound Secrets’s expression was solemn as he said, “Lord Saint Azure, can ... you do it?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Time is too short. I don’t know whether it will work or not too. Do what we can and leave the rest up to fate then! At this point, there’s already no other way. There’s only to fight!”

As he said, he turned his head to look at the other unpredictable children, and said calmly, “You guys, who’s willing to brave life-and-death together with this saint?”

“Me!”

Ye Yuan’s voice had yet to fade when a figure already stepped forward.

It was none other than precisely Wan Zhen!

“Me!”

“Me too!”

... ...

Very soon, there were many people who came forward.

However, even more people exchanged glances, seemingly having the intention of withdrawing. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he could not help sighing slightly too and said, “Times have changed, the hearts of the people have also changed!”

Still remembering when Saint Profound died in the cause of justice, what a noble spirit he was!

The geniuses of that era also used actual actions to comfort Saint Profound’s spirit in heaven.

But in this epoch, the human race had stayed in a comfortable environment for too long.

Even if they knew that it had already reached the point of life and death, they were still not willing to risk their lives.

Because they had never experienced before that feeling of humiliation.

Without humiliation, how could there be the ambition to risk one’s life?

Shang Hang sneered and said, “Thrive in calamity, and perish in soft living! Seeing these people who cling to life and fear death, this ancestor somewhat regrets what I did back then!”

Profound Secrets similarly smiled coldly and said, “Those who are afraid of death tend to die faster! Doomsday Battle, no one can stay aloof from it! Do you all think that by not going, you’ll be able to live?”

Everyone exchanged glances. Only then did some people step forward again.

The majority of the people still harbored hopes of getting lucky.

Maybe they could survive?

If the sky fell, there would always be the tall folks holding it up.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “The rest, all leave then!”

Among 1000 people, the ones who stepped forward in the end were less than 300 people.

What made Ye Yuan a little surprised was that Pang Zhen came forward too.

He and Pang Zhen were not on very good terms. So he did not expect that this guy still had some guts.

His gaze swept over everyone and said, “You guys staying behind, do you know what you’re going to face?”

Wan Zhen immediately said, “For men, death is but death! Can there be unbroken eggs when the nest is totally wrecked? Don’t even know this bit of logic and they also dare to call themselves geniuses. Those people really wasted all their years of living!”

Pang Zhen snorted coldly and said, “How can my Pang Family have people who are afraid of risking their neck? Ancestor dares to battle, how can I, Pang Zhen, be so cowardly?”

The nine great Dao Ancestors came from the last epoch.

Although their strength was not considered top-notch at that time, they were considered to have battled for the rise of the myriad races.

Although Ancestor Lightning had an appearance of impassiveness, a hint of imperceptible pride showed in his eyes.

People who had experienced that era would not be hesitant to proceed when in front of such major issues of right and wrong.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not bad, you made me view you in a different light! Actually, if people don’t force themselves, they really won’t know how great their potential is at times! Although fighting is dangerous, it’s also the fastest way to break through! The divine race has as many experts as clouds, there’s no better whetstone than this! Perhaps this battle will be your road toward being canonized as an ancestor!”

The remaining unpredictable children trembled all over, fighting spirit immediately igniting in their eyes!

Being canonized as an ancestor, it was a great temptation to them as well.

Although this battle was perilous, if they pulled through, it would be a smooth road!

“Among you, there are some whose talents are not as good as those people who left. But I believe that as long as you guys can survive, your future accomplishments will definitely be higher than theirs!” Ye Yuan said firmly.

Profound Secrets said, “Among the million unpredictable children, there are definitely many who are willing to join too. I’ll convene with all of them. These people, Lord Saint Azure will be in charge of them!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “There’s one more thing that needs to be entrusted to you.”

Profound Secrets replied, “What is it, Lord Saint Azure? Feel free to give the order.”

Ye Yuan said, “Lend me your Primeval War Realm to use. Let my Pill Tower’s alchemy path powerhouses enter and comprehend the Dao. With the time acceleration here, it might be able to give birth to Dao pill level powerhouses!”

Profound Secrets’ eyes lit up and he said with a nod, “I’ll obey Lord Saint Azure’s orders!”

In the past, Profound Secrets looked down on the alchemy path because the alchemy path’s inheritance had already been cut off.

But now, he knew that the ancient times’ alchemy path inheritance was left behind by Ye Yuan in the first place. Then what did he still have to hesitate for?

In the past, Ye Yuan imparted Dao at Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma. It was to guide those alchemy path powerhouses into Great Dao!”

With the addition of time law, who knew whether Dao pill level powerhouses would be born or not?
