Chapter 2689: I’m Very Happy!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Thump!

Thump!

The sound of heartbeats suddenly entered Ye Yuan’s ears.

The darkness faded, and a heart appeared in front of Ye Yuan.

Suddenly, the heart started to shrink, then shrunk again.

Finally, it turned into a small and exquisite red crystal and flew toward Ye Yuan.

“It’s my dragon heart. It will be lodging in your body in the future. The dragon qi in the dragon heart will nourish your true dragon bloodline and be greatly beneficial to you! I hope that one day, you can bring me home!” Mi Tian’s voice transmitted out of the dragon heart.

Finished saying, he did not wait for Ye Yuan to refuse either. The dragon heart flew straight between Ye Yuan’s eyebrows and disappeared.

Ye Yuan felt as if a round of spring rain was currently nourishing all the blood in his body.

This feeling made him extremely refreshed.

“Senior Mi Tian, rest assured. What Ye Yuan promised you, I’ll definitely do it!” Ye Yuan said firmly.

… …

Outside of the karst cave, the seven great sea regions’ young powerhouses have already assembled.

However, there were still many people who remained in the Land of Dragon Slumber forever.

Some rejoiced, some bemoaned.

Some people died, but there were naturally some who attained Dao.

“Congratulations, Brother Youqing. You’re probably the biggest winner among us apart from Younger Sister Jingfei!” Muchen said to Youqing with a smile.

“This is just something to be expected! The happiest thing is that that guy won’t be coming out again! See? What did I say? Feeling the calling of the Land of Dragon Slumber and getting the protection of the Land of Dragon Slumber might not be a good thing! Now, it’s indeed like this, right?”

Youqing was very happy, really happy.

Entering the Land of Dragon Slumber this time, he obtained considerably lucky chances, his cultivation directly reaching the realm of grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Not only that, he even obtained a dragon race mystic art that could let his bloodline power continuously improve!

With this mystic art, he might become a true dragon in the future.

Of course, what made him happiest was still that Ye Yuan did not come out!

The Land of Dragon Slumber’s restrictions were already slowly recovering. It was about to recover like it was new soon.

Those who had not come out yet were basically confirmed that they could not come out anymore.

He was already very sure that that mysterious summoning was simply a huge trap.

Ye Yuan must have already died inside after entering.

This matter made him even happier than when he broke through his cultivation realm and obtained the dragon race mystic art.

“Hahaha,?Brother Youqing indeed foretold with divine accuracy! That cocky guy has died inside!” Muchen gave Youqing a big thumbs up as he said with a loud laugh.

He was very happy too!

Youqing said smugly, “Huhu, this guy thought that he was a genius, but he was an out-and-out moron! This was clearly a trap, he actually jumped in just like that.”

“Humph!?Big Brother Ye Yuan won’t die. He’ll definitely come out!” Little Dragon Girl pouted and said unhappily.

To talk about this Land of Dragon Slumber trip, the biggest winner was none other than Little Dragon Girl.

Her bloodline power already reached the terrifying peak eighth segment, being only half a step away from the ninth segment!

Apart from this, she even obtained many good things with Ye Yuan’s help.

These things could all increase bloodline power.

With these things, Little Dragon Girl evolving to the realm of a true dragon was virtually a sure bet.

Furthermore, Little Dragon Girl’s realm also directly jumped to grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Her improvement was even greater than Youqing!

One had to know, she rose up from lower Limitless Sublime Heaven.

Those dragon race good stuff, Ye Yuan did not want a single one of them and gave it all to Little Dragon Girl.

Little Dragon Girl liked to play pranks, but it did not mean that she could not tell good from bad.

She had a good impression of Ye Yuan to begin with.

Now, she was even more grateful to Ye Yuan.

So, when she saw Youqing’s gloating appearance, she felt very unhappy.

Not far away, Black Flood Dragon King was also frowning slightly, his expression grim.

He was very optimistic about Ye Yuan and felt that he definitely would not fall in the Land of Dragon Slumber.

Who knew that he really fell!

If not for that he could not enter the Land of Dragon Slumber, he even wished to rush inside right now.

Youqing’s words made him inexplicably a little irritated.

But right then, the restrictions of the Land of Dragon Slumber were finally restored again.

Youqing laughed loudly and said, “Young Sister Jingfei, even if your Big Brother Ye Yuan isn’t dead, it’s impossible to come out anymore too! This restriction, even Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses can’t break it too. Do you think that he can come out??Hahaha

?…”

In his excitement, Youqing burst out laughing.

“Noisy!”

Youqing was currently being pleased with himself when Black Flood Dragon King flung a slap over.

Against a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven mighty expert, he did not even have time to react and was directly slapped flying.

Everyone was silent like cicadas in winter.

No one expected that Black Flood Dragon King would actually get so angry.

Youqing clutched his face and said with a look of surprise, “Black Flood Dragon King, you … you dared to hit me?”

Black Flood Dragon King had a dark look and said, “Still dare to be noisy, this king will kill you right now! Can Jia Lan that guy do anything to this king?”

Youqing’s expression changed, only then, knowing that Black Flood Dragon King had genuinely become enraged.

It was just that, he did not understand why Black Flood Dragon King would suddenly get angry.

Could it be because of Ye Yuan that punk?

But Ye Yuan was not considered as being respectful to Black Flood Dragon King either. In fact, he was a little domineering. So Black Flood Dragon King should have no reason to like him.

How baffling!

However, Black Flood Dragon King flying into a rage, he naturally did not dare to speak up anymore and could only suffer a quiet loss.

He did not have the qualifications to challenge Black Flood Dragon King right now. Even if his royal father came, he would at most be about on par with Black Flood Dragon King too.

“You … You guys, quickly look!” Right then, someone suddenly started yelling.

That voice was as if he had seen a ghost.

Black Flood Dragon King and Youqing both followed the voice and looked over, and could not help being dumbstruck with amazement.

Ye Yuan actually walked out of the Land of Dragon Slumber with a swagger just like that.

That restriction power seemed to be non-existent!

“This … How is this possible? How … How did he do it? Why didn’t these restrictions kill him? He … He’s actually not dead!” Youqing had a look of shock, asking several questions in one breath.

Except, no one could answer him.

Because even Black Flood Dragon King did not know what happened either. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The scene before their eyes had never happened in the Land of Dragon Slumber before.

“Too inconceivable! The restrictions were already restored, and yet he could actually still come out!”

“Wasn’t he dead? How did he revive again?”

“Damn it, this boy’s life is really tenacious!”

… …

When these young powerhouses saw Ye Yuan, beyond the shock, each and every one was incomparably disappointed.

No one expected that Ye Yuan could actually come back to life!

Black Flood Dragon King was in extreme shock too, but the fury on his face had long already vanished without a trace. What replaced it was joy!

Yes, he was extremely happy!

Ye Yuan being able to come out was the best thing for him!

Furthermore, he could also excavate even more secrets from Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan looked at Youqing’s face like his father had died, and said with a smile, “Looking at your expression, it seems like you are very disappointed that I could come out! But, seeing your expression like this, I’m very happy..”
