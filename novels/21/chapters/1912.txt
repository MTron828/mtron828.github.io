Chapter 1916: Have Your Family Head Come Find Me

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This ... Lord Jiang Hua, can you accommodate a little? We really have important matters to discuss with Elder Jiang Yuan.”

Xiao Feng did not expect that waiting bitterly for seven days and seven nights, what he got was such a sentence.

He did not feel that he lost face. It was just that being unable to help Ye Yuan made him very ashamed and guilty in his heart.

It was hard to enter a noble gate!

Originally thought that his master was, at any rate, a high-level Five-star Alchemy God too and could more or less have some face. Who knew that other people did not give you this face at all.

Xiao Feng felt bitter in his heart.

It was just that he did not want to give up just like this and still wanted to fight for it.

Who knew that Jiang Hua’s expression turned dark and then said with a cold snort, “Important matter? Don’t you, a low-level deacon, understand your identity? Everyone that comes over to find Family Head all says that they have important matters. If I let anyone in, how do I still work as a steward? Also, holding a Five-star Alchemy God’s greeting card and you want to come and meet Family Head? In great imperial capitals, what do Five-star Alchemy Gods count for? Quickly get lost, don’t block other people!”

Xiao Feng’s fury rose up with a whoosh.

He was merely a nobody, but Jiang Hua’s words insulted his master, which made him unable to accept it.

“You! Bullying people too far! You’re merely a Celestial Deity yourself, so who do you think you are?” Xiao Feng said furiously.

Jiang Hua’s gaze turned cold and did not even give any warning, raising his hand, it was a palm.

Xiao Feng was merely a Divine Lord Realm, this palm came over akin to toppling mountains and overturning the seas, how could he block it?

But right at this time, Jiang Hua only felt a blur before his eyes, and his attack was actually dissolved without a sound.

“So fast!” Jiang Hua’s pupils constricted, secretly shocked in his heart.

He was Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity and actually did not see clearly how Ye Yuan made his move!

One had to know, Ye Yuan was merely a Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity.

However, he did not care at all, because this place was the Jiang Manor. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What, do you guys want to cause trouble in the Jiang Manor?” Jiang Hua said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “It was clearly you who attacked first, how did it become us who caused trouble? Not seeing then not seeing, there’s also no need to insult people’s master. I’ll send my regards to your father right now, I wonder how you’d feel? You see, I haven’t even extend my greetings, and your expression already changed. Therefore, you should be more understanding of others, don’t let your eyes grow on top of your head.”

A round of words was said until Jiang Hua’s face alternated between green and white.

Ye Yuan was clearly scolding him, yet, it was like he did not scold, making Jiang Hua feel aggrieved.

Only to see his expression turn dark and he said in a cold voice, “Humph! Looks like you guys aren’t placing my Jiang Manor in your eyes! Come, guards, take these few people down for me and teach them a good lesson.”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, a powerful aura instantly erupted, locking Jiang Hua down firmly.

Jiang Hua’s expression suddenly changed, like his throat was clutched by someone. Even breathing became anguishing.

He was incomparably shocked in his heart. Why would a Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity give him such tremendous pressure?

Under the word of command, four to five Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouses dashed in all at once. They were all the Jiang Manor’s house guards.

Even though there were many True God powerhouses inside great imperial capitals, it was naturally impossible for them to become a house guard of a Jiang Manor.

“Steward Jiang! Are ... Are you okay?”

When the guards saw Jiang Hua’s complexion turn white, each and every one of their faces changed drastically.

This Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity young man in front of them actually gave them a feeling of being unable to overcome with force.

This kind of feeling was truly ludicrous!

Ye Yuan looked at Jiang Hua and said coolly, “You rely on your master’s might to bully others here, but you said that we don’t put the Jiang Manor in our eyes. Can you, a puny little steward, represent the Jiang Manor? Or is it that you took yourself to be the Jiang Manor’s master? What a show of authority!”

When the guards heard that, their expressions when looking at Jiang Hua were full of peculiarness.

But Jiang Hua’s expression changed, and he said stammeringly, “Y-You’re slinging mud at people!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “You said the words yourself, the show of authority was displayed by you, and you said that I’m slinging mud? Does every person who comes to Jiang Manor have to see your attitude? We waited for seven days and night, handed over the greeting card, and felt that there was no problem in the area of etiquette when we touched our hearts and asked ourselves. But you only swept a glance at the greeting card and made us scram? A snobbish person like you probably chased away quite a few people indiscriminately, right? As a servant, you made enemies for your master everywhere. Did I malign you then?”

Those house guards all exchanged glances. They all knew that Steward Jiang Hua was indeed becoming more and more haughty.

When doing things now, he was somewhat arrogant.

Everyone’s cultivation realm was clearly more or less the same, but he totally paid no attention to them, these guards.

Hence, what Ye Yuan said was not wrong.

Imperial cities were still alright, but of those who came to visit, there were quite a number of imperial capitals’ powerhouses.

Just as Ye Yuan said, what if among these people, someone rose up. Then it was provoking huge trouble for his own master.

The commotion here naturally attracted the attention of the gatehouse there. Quite a number of people had already surrounded them long ago.

Some people could not help secretly approving when they heard Ye Yuan’s words.

Most of them had to look to Jiang Yuan for help. Hence, they could only humble themselves and wait in the gatehouse, waiting to be called in.

It was just that meeting or not was also entirely up to Jiang Hua’s whims.

These few years, Jiang Hua extorted considerable profit from them.

As for those who came from imperial cities like Ye Yuan, Jiang Hua completely turned his nose up at them and naturally could not be bothered to reach his hand out towards them as well.

But Jiang Hua laughed coldly when he heard that and said, “Your meaning is that you’ll be a remarkable important figure in the future, and existence that even our family head can’t afford to provoke? Hahaha! I want to hear what important matters a bumpkin who came from a mere imperial city have to find Family Head!”

“No need! I’ll make your family head come find me personally! Brother Xiao, let’s go.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

As he said, he withdrew his aura and brought Xiao Feng, and prepared to turn around and leave.

The pressure on Jiang Hua’s body suddenly lightened, but he was already furious to the extreme in his heart.

Seeing Ye Yuan go out, Jiang Hua gave a furious roar: “Go invite the True God Realm retainer in the house, and take this punk down for me! I want to see how he becomes a big shot!”

Whoosh!

A ray of sword light directly tore apart the void, immediately rushing in from outside the house, and brushing past Jiang Hua’s ear.

Jiang Hua only felt a wind blow past, the muscles in his body suddenly tensed up.

Crack!

A wooden beam behind Jiang Hua was directly split into two.

Jiang Hua’s pupils constricted, only knowing in hindsight that he had already had a brush with the god of death.

Drip! Drip!

Cold sweat flowed down the side of his head.

He stood there and did not dare to make the slightest movement for a long time, all the way until Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared from the area of the Jiang Manor.

Those guards also looked at this scene in astonishment, incomparably shocked in their hearts.

They were all rejoicing, lucky they did not take action just now, otherwise, they would probably all be corpses now!

Law fusion! Spatial law!

This young man was incredible!

Suddenly, Jiang Hua’s entire body trembled, finally recovering his senses.

“Is ... he gone?” Jiang Hua asked the guards anxiously and doubtfully.
