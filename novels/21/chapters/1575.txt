Chapter 1579 You“re Simply a Devil!

Heavenly Sin was yelling frenziedly in his heart, but he could not see Ye Yuan’s movement clearly at all.

He could not even beg for mercy!

Heavenly Sin had utterly collapsed!

Just now, with Ye Yuan cutting off the Heavenly Dao, he thought that his chance had come.

He was even mocking Ye Yuan in his heart.

That instant, he looked forward to the future very much.

But in a twinkle, Ye Yuan used his ridiculously inhumane strength and shattered his hopes to pieces.

From being enormously proud of his success to despair, to when hope came again, to when hope was extinguished again.

In this short while, his heart had experienced violent ups and downs that ordinary people found hard to imagine.

At this time, his Dao heart was already close to breaking down.

Suddenly, the slapping sounds were gone.

Ye Yuan actually stopped slapping him!

Everyone was dead silent. They were astounded by Ye Yuan’s strength.

The middle-stage Origin Deity Ye Yuan actually beat the grand completion Origin Deity Heavenly Sin like a dog. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Sure enough, it was still that familiar taste!

Ye Yuan’s power did not need explanations at all.

Only now did they know that their previous worries were completely superfluous.

The only thing that they had to do was to believe in Ye Yuan.

Heavenly Sin’s face already lost human form.

All of the teeth in his mouth were knocked out, his face swollen heavily, his mouth was full of golden bloodstains, looking incomparably ugly.

Ye Yuan used the power of laws. Naturally, it would not let his injuries be so easy to heal.

He looked at the pig head-like Heavenly Sin and said coolly, “Just now, did you feel that you had hope again? You thought that me treating you and then cutting off the Heavenly Dao, you can dominate the Immortal Grove Region already, right? Very sorry, I let you down. I did it on purpose. Giving you hope amidst despair, then personally crushing this hope. This delight is truly unimaginable!”

Heavenly Sin’s pupils constricted. He knew that Ye Yuan was simply toying with his feelings from start until now!

Him wanting to kill Heavenly Sin was simply a matter of moving a fingertip.

But he just did not!

This kind of toying was even more humiliating than him being dumped after being toyed by women.

He was a fool through and through, being toyed in Ye Yuan’s palm.

He was sold by Ye Yuan and still counting money for Ye Yuan, overflowing with gratitude.

“You ... You’re simply a devil!” Heavenly Sin gabbled.

He really was in a desperate state and was really afraid!

He boasted that he was already very evil, but in front of Ye Yuan’s means, it was simply like an apprentice in the presence of a great sorcerer.

Except, he did not have the qualifications to play like this at all.

Ye Yuan had a strength that he was unable to imagine. No matter how he wanted to play, he could play.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Devil? Heh heh, if you feel that I’m a devil, then that’s right! But if I tell you now that even though I sundered the Heavenly Dao, I can still mobilize it, what would you think?”

Heavenly Sin’s pupils constricted and he cried out in shock, “I-Impossible!”

Not just Heavenly Sin, the faces of everyone below all revealed shocked and disbelieving expressions.

Already severed the fetters with the Heavenly Dao, how could he possibly control the power of the Heavenly Dao again?

A faint smile hung on Ye Yuan’s face. Lightly tapping a finger out, the wind and clouds changed colors!

“Puhwark!”

In a blink of an eye, terrifying air billows struck Heavenly Sin, punching a large hole in his chest.

The look in Heavenly Sin’s eyes showed that he was terrified to the extreme, his gaze full of disbelief.

How was this possible?

How was this possible!

He could really mobilize the power of the Heavenly Dao!

Could it be that him sundering the Heavenly Dao earlier was just an illusion?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Are you very surprised? Why am I still able to mobilize the Heavenly Dao when I’ve severed it?”

Ye Yuan paused for a bit and said, “Sorry, this is a secret, I won’t tell you!”

“Puhwark!”

Heavenly Sin had anger rush to his heart and spewed out a large mouthful of blood again.

The current Heavenly Sin was already an arrow at the end of its flight, only left with a final breath.

Ye Yuan deliberately not killing him was in order to let him feel despair.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with pity, “Don’t ask why I’m so wicked. Want to blame someone, can only blame you for doing what you shouldn’t have done!”

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan pointed another finger out, directly destroying Heavenly Sin’s divine sea.

“Ahh! My ... My divine sea!” Heavenly Sin screamed miserably.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Since you were suppressed for 300 thousand years and are still not dead, it shows that your vitality is very tenacious. Then, you should continue being suppressed!”

Ye Yuan turned his palm over, directly slamming Heavenly Sin into the earth.

The violent power of the Heavenly Dao poured into the sealed land frenziedly, sealing Heavenly Sin firmly underneath.

Ye Yuan’s seal was more than a hundred times stronger than those people 300 thousand years ago.

Even if his cultivation could recover, it was also impossible to break free from this sealed land.

He would be sealed until death.

Everything returned to tranquility. Everyone looked at that invincible figure high in the sky, somewhat unsure what they should say.

A calamity that was sufficient to destroy the world was actually resolved by Ye Yuan so effortlessly.

Furthermore, this guy was too capable in messing around, making their little hearts pound heavily.

Ye Yuan made Heavenly Sin run around in circles, how was it also not keeping them on tenterhooks for half a day?

But Fang Tian and the rest all knew why Ye Yuan did so. Heavenly Sin’s provocation made Ye Yuan become genuinely enraged, that was why he would toy with his opponent like so, crushing his opponent’s last trace of confidence.

If it were another enemy, even if Ye Yuan killed the opponent, he would not torment him like this either.

But Mu Lingxue’s death was originally Ye Yuan’s greatest regret in this life. Now, this Heavenly Sin was actually so blind, wanting to snatch Ye Yuan’s other lover, what was this if not seeking death?

Ye Yuan’s figure flashed, arriving by Li-er’s side.

He reached his hand out and lightly caressed Li-er’s face. For a moment, a multitude of feelings surged up.

“Li-er, you became thinner.” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Ye Yuan understood that he barely escaped deaths in the Heavenspan World. Li-er also lived in constant fear and worry for a hundred years in the Immortal Grove World.

These 100 years were not easy!

Two rows of clear tears fell down, but Li-er forced herself to smile.

Just now, she thought that she could no longer see Ye Yuan.

She did not expect that at the final juncture, Ye Yuan actually returned to the Immortal Grove World miraculously.

She shook her head hard and said, “Li-er ate well and slept well, I didn’t get thinner! Rather, it’s you who suffered considerable hardships in the Heavenspan World these few years, right?”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “You’re still so understanding. But the more you’re like this, the more I feel that I owe you!”

Li-er shook her head hard again and said sobbingly, “Compared to Elder Sister Lingxue, what does my bit of hardship count as? Big Brother Yuan, you went to the Heavenspan World, have you found the method to save Elder Sister Lingxue?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh, “Too difficult!”

Li-er’s tears flowed down again involuntarily.

Ye Yuan lightly pulled Li-er into his embrace, everything was conveyed without words.

Liang Wanru could not hear what the two of them were saying. Seeing this scene from far away, her beautiful body involuntarily shuddered, tears flowing down unwittingly.

She completely did not expect that in this small world, there was actually such a world-toppling visage.

No wonder Big Brother Ye rejected her!
