Chapter 2185: Want to Die or Live

Only then did everyone realize what kind of concept Ye Yuan exterminating hundreds of abyss monsters in an hour was.

Among these hundreds of abyss monsters, there were even many that were Empyrean level.

If looking at the situation of the fight just now, even a First Firmament Empyrean monster could also forcefully contend with a Second Firmament Empyrean existence.

Under the corroboration of the two, just what kind of inconceivable thing had Ye Yuan done?

More importantly, he only used two hours!

These Fourth Firmament Empyreans weighed themselves over, if they fought alone, it would absolutely be a dogfight, taking a very long time.

Just how strong was this brat’s strength?

Previously, they all did not pay attention to the look in Lin Changqing’s eyes at all.

But now, they finally understood!

This kid must have seen something remarkable.

“Changqing, what in the world did you see?” Zheng Yufeng pulled Lin Changqing to one side and asked softly.

Even if so long had passed, Lin Changqing was still in the midst of shock.

Prior to this, he did not know how strong Ye Yuan was.

But when he witnessed Ye Yuan butchering these abyss monsters, he finally understood that he and Ye Yuan were already people from completely different worlds!

“A massacre! A complete massacre! Those Second Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters couldn’t last one exchange under his hands at all! He only needed one punch to annihilate the other party!” Lin Changqing said.

Ye Yuan could annihilate a Second Firmament Empyrean abyss monster with one punch, wanting to kill him was clearly just a matter of snapping a finger.

Just what kind of freak did he provoke?

No wonder Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli had always maintained a distance from him. No wonder even though he was so outstanding, Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli had always been aloof and indifferent.

It turned out that she actually had such a monstrous lover!

With such a man, how could he still enter her eyes?

Genius?

This term was a pile of dog shit in front of Ye Yuan!

Zheng Yufeng’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Massacre? Doesn’t that mean that he has at least peak Third Firmament Empyrean combat strength?”

But Lin Changqing shook his head and said, “I suspect that it’s more than that!”

“Hiss!”

Everyone sucked in a cold breath.

No wonder this guy was so arrogant! He really had the capital to be arrogant!

At this time, no one treated Ye Yuan as a junior anymore.

Being able to exterminate so many abyss monsters with his power alone, it would also absolutely not be as effortless as Li Yue they all, these Sixth Firmament Empyreans.

Li Yue’s gaze glimmered slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “Why would these monsters be so strong, it’s completely illogical! No wonder the Empyrean Realm martial artists that entered this place before, none of them returned!”

Zheng Yufeng nodded and said, “What Brother Ye said earlier is right. Our mission has to be done cautiously. If the matter can’t be accomplished, we must withdraw straight away.”

Actually, everyone already somewhat wanted to beat a retreat.

But there was no harvest until now. They could not give an account after returning to their respective factions either, so they could only toughen their scalps and carry on walking.

However, what surprised everyone was that the journey that followed was unexpectedly calm. There were actually no abyss monsters coming to attack them again.

But it was precisely because of this that the uneasiness in everyone’s hearts grew stronger.

Li Ye’s heart was somewhat racing as he asked, Ye Yuan, “Boy, have you seen these monsters in the past before?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Seen before!”

“Just what are these monsters? Also, where have you seen these monsters before?” Li Yue asked.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “No comments.”

“You!” Li Yue could not help choking when he heard that and said angrily, “Cocky for what? You punk, not only have you seen these monsters before, you can even absorb devilish energy! In my view, you’re definitely together with the monsters!”

The moment these words came out, the group of Empyreans involuntarily pulled apart some distance from Ye Yuan.

Indeed, Li Yue’s random guess made everyone give rise to suspicion in their hearts.

Ye Yuan was too peculiar!

When Li Yue saw that he isolated Ye Yuan with one sentence, he could not help feeling smug in his heart.

Who knew that Ye Yuan simply ignored him and walked forward without consulting anyone.

Li Yu was thoroughly infuriated by Ye Yuan’s action of overlooking.

“Brat, this empyrean is talking to you. Didn’t you hear?” Li Yue said in a great rage.

Ye Yuan still ignored him. How could he know that Ye Yuan was currently not in the mood to play this sort of game with him at all?

All of his thoughts were placed on looking for Li-er.

Regarding the clues and inklings around, Ye Yuan would not let any of it go.

It was just too bad that up until now, Ye Yuan did not discover any situation.

Under his rage, Li Yue’s aura erupted, and he was about to make a move against Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, a streak of black light flashed past in the dark night!

Bang!

The place where Ye Yuan was standing actually had a large pit blasted out.

Everyone’s expression changed. They saw an abyss monster standing at the place where Ye Yuan stood previously.

While Ye Yuan’s figure was already gone.

Could it be that ... Ye Yuan was killed just like that?

However, they did not have time to think too much. Because a large group of abyss monsters suddenly scurried out around them!

There were as many as several dozen!

Furthermore, the aura of each one was very strong, they were actually all middle-stage Empyrean Realm strength!

The expressions of the group of Empyreans changed wildly.

They were surrounded!

A despairing mood spread among the Empyreans.

These were all middle-stage Empyrean Realm abyss monsters. Judging from the situation that they encountered previously, they did not have the slightest chance of victory at all. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“You guys came right on time. Let me ask you. Have you all seen this human female before?”

Suddenly, a figure flashed at the top of a tree, Ye Yuan condensed Yue Mengli’s image with divine essence.

But his words were asked at the abyss monster who ambushed him previously with a divine soul brand.

He had also asked before those Empyrean level abyss monsters previously, but those abyss monsters did not know at all.

Now, encountering these stronger abyss monsters, Ye Yuan asked once more.

“Hahaha ... human brat, why should this empyrean answer your question? Become this empyrean’s snack obediently, if this empyrean is happy, maybe I’ll tell you!” That Sixth Firmament Empyrean powerful existence said with a loud laugh.

This abyss monster’s aura was the strongest. Clearly, it was the leader of this group of abyss monsters.

Sixth Firmament Empyrean could virtually sweep across the Empyrean powerhouses present!

“This punk actually didn’t die!” Li Yue said in shock.

He knew how terrifying that strike earlier was. Furthermore, it was even a sneak attack.

If it were him, he also did not have absolute confidence in avoiding.

Ye Yuan was actually completely unharmed!

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and put away Li-er’s image, and said coolly, “Then ... there’s only beating until you all say it!”

The abyss monster leader laughed loudly and said, “Arrogant and conceited brat, just based on the likes of you all, these lowly humans, you also want to beat us noble abyss monsters?”

Ye Yuan ignored him, but he shouted at Li Yue and the rest, “Hey, do you all want to die or live?”

Li Yue’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Rubbish! Of course it’s want to live! But just based on you, what right do you have to say such words?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you want to live, don’t resist, do as I say. If want to die... then just take it as I didn’t say anything.”
