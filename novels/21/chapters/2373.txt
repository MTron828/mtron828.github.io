Chapter 2379: Coming Elegantly, Leaving Suavely!

“Palace Lord, things are bad! Someone forcibly barged into our Sentry Celestial Palace!”

“Panicking for? Talking properly, who’s the arrival, how is his strength?”

“T-The arrival is a young man, can’t tell his age. His strength is F-Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor!”

“Are those human guards all drawing salary without doing any work? Can’t even deal with a Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor? Also, why are you reporting to me about everything, what are you thinking? You go and find Yuan Zhen, have him go!”

“L-Lord Yuan Zhen has already been killed by him!”

“What did you say!”

“Lord Yuan Zhen was already killed by that young man. Not just that, Yuan Jie, Lu Feng they all are all dead! Furthermore ... he even identified you by name, and he wants to meet the palace lord, you! He said that he’s the main culprit behind the destruction of the dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces!”

“What did you say? He alone exterminated dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces? What a joke!”

Originbright’s shock was by no means insignificant/

He had once imagined countless possibilities, but he only did not think that dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces were actually destroyed by a Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor!

When did the human race produce such a terrifying genius?

Originbright did not quite dare to believe it, but he knew that it was impossible for his subordinate to deceive him.

Even Yuan Zhen died, what was impossible about him destroying dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces?

“Go! Go out and take a look!” Done talking, his figure moved, and he went out of the Sentry Celestial Palace.

... ...

In midair, a youth in white garment stood with his hands behind his back, countless flying swords hanging around him, his sword energy threatening!

Those human and divine race experts, not one dared to approach him. They could only wander around him.

Seeing this scene, Originbright believed it.

His gaze landed on Ye Yuan, and he said in a solemn voice, “It’s you who destroyed my divine race’s 18 Sentry Celestial Palaces?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s me.”

Originbright laughed coldly and said, “Looks like Skysouth’s events made you unable to sit still anymore! Since you did it, you must already have some sort of awareness, right?”

Originbright was not stupid. With Ye Yuan suddenly jumping out at this time, he must have sympathized with Skysouth’s humans.

This sort of humans who resisted the divine race, they had seen plenty of them.

It was just that Ye Yuan seemed to be a little more troublesome.

But it did not matter as well, since Ye Yuan came, this matter was considered over.

Although the divine race’s losses were huge this time, being able to destroy such a terrifying genius was also worth it!

Otherwise, after this guy grew up until Deva Fifth Blight, that would be very tricky.

However, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Come to what awareness? I think that you’ve misunderstood, I came just to inform you that Skysouth’s matters can end now. Otherwise, the entire southern border’s Sentry Celestial Palaces will be destroyed by me. Of course, if you have that many Nine-marks powerhouses, you can dispatch one to every Sentry Celestial Palace.”

Arrogant!

Looking down on everyone and everything!

Facing a middle-stage Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm super powerhouse, Ye Yuan thought nothing of him at all!

He did not come to surrender himself. He came to pick a quarrel!

All of the divine race members opened their mouths wide, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

Was this kid crazy?

He thought that he could escape from Lord Originbright’s hands?

Ye Yuan went on a massacre earlier. They thought that it was just Ye Yuan’s deathbed struggle. That was all.

They did not expect that after he saw Lord Originbright, he still dared to be so impudent!

“Hahaha ...”

When Originbright heard this, it was like he heard the most hilarious joke in this world, laughing wildly without ceasing.

“Brat, you’re very courageous! Being able to destroy 18 Sentry Celestial Palaces, you’re very strong too! But your understanding of Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm is too little! Eight-marks to Nine-marks isn’t your human Heavenly Emperor to Deva!” Originbright laughed loudly as he said.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It doesn’t make any difference to me. Alright, I’ve already said what should be said! If you dare to make a move against the human race again, then don’t blame me for going on a killing spree!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan turned around suavely and was about to leave like nobody’s business.

Seeing this action, not a single one actually dared to stop him!

These people were already intimidated by Ye Yuan’s killing.

“How can my Sentry Celestial Palace be a place that you can come and go as you please? Stay for me!”

Originbright bellowed, the pressure of Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Relm suddenly releasing.

A horrifying to the extreme aura instantly enveloped all the space in a 100 thousand mile radius!

For Originbright to be able to suppress the entire southern boundary, how could his strength be ordinary?

Even in the Profound Lineage, his strength could rank in the forefront too!

The moment he took action, it was simply apocalyptic.

Those human powerhouses almost felt like they could not breathe. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This pressure represented Heavenly Dao, it was too terrifying!

The divine race was able to suppress myriad races and regard themselves as Heavenly Dao’s envoys. This was also an extremely important aspect.

However, facing such a horrifying Heavenly Dao pressure, Ye Yuan did not seem to feel anything, continuing to stroll away.

Originbright snorted coldly, striding across the void with a flash and arriving.

The speed was swift to the extreme!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Right at this moment, countless flying swords arrived in quick succession.

True Nirvana Sword Formation, arise!

It was just that this time, the True Nirvana Sword Formation that overpowered all sides, was unable to stop the powerful Originbright at all!

Originbright was like a giant mountain. The moment those flying swords touched him, they immediately shattered to pieces.

The flying swords rushed over but were unable to stop Originbright’s footsteps at all.

In an instant, he arrived ten thousand feet of where Ye Yuan was.

“Haha, kid! This kind of means is still barely passable to deal with Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realms. But dealing with me, it’s too weak! Stay for me!”

Amidst the wild laughter, Originbright suddenly felt that something was not quite right.

He was clearly only ten thousand feet away from Ye Yuan.

But his speed of advancing got slower and slower!

Right under his nose, but seemingly far away on the horizon!

“Terrific lad, time law! No, wait, there’s also source spatial law! Spacetime synchronization, even I’m unable to easily break through either! Who the hell is this kid? When did such a monster appear among the human race?”

It was not that Originbright was unable to break through. But for him to want to break through the constraints of spacetime in an instant, it was impossible.

However, Ye Yuan did not need to entangle him.

If he wanted to leave, no one could hold him back!

Just like that, Ye Yuan moved ten thousand feet in a step, leaving the Sentry Celestial Palace like he was strolling idly in a courtyard!

When his aura completely disappeared from everyone’s perception, only then, did everyone feel like they woke up from a dream!

“W-What a terrifying young man! He actually comprehended spacetime law! Furthermore, his spatial law even reached the level of source!”

“My God, even Lord Originbright personally moving out actually failed to hold him back too!”

“I still found it very funny when he was threatening Lord Originbright earlier. But now, I really can’t laugh anymore!”

... ...

The threat previously, no one took it to heart.

But at this moment, no one felt that Ye Yuan was joking.

If really got on his nerves, he would really massacre the southern border’s Sentry Celestial Palaces clean!

Send Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realms to garrison?

You got to be kidding!

Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realms were not cabbages either!

There was no way to imagine how big the Heavenspan World was.

Even if the divine race dispatched all of their Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realms, it was also impossible to guard every Sentry Celestial Palace.

A subordinate asked carefully, “P-Palace Lord, what should we do now?”

Originbright’s expression was grim until it was practically dripping water.

It was only to hear him say in a deep voice, “Pull everyone back! Send the news out! If anyone dares to deal with the Sentry Celestial Palace again, none of the local sects will be spared!”
