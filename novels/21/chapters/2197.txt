Chapter 2201: Jadeheart Grass

“Dad, Uncle Jian, you guys are back?”

A’Yong welcomed the hunting party with a proud look.

His father, Chen Lie, the Chen Village’s patriarch, was a powerful hunter who was renowned far and wide.

At this time, several powerful hunters returned. They were all carrying quite a number of games on them. It was naturally a fully-loaded return again.

“Haha, Yong-er, the luck this time was pretty good. I hunted a Snowjade Roebuck,” Chen Lie said with a big laugh.

At this time, the villagers all gathered over, each and every one of them exclaiming with admiration.

“Patriarch is really impressive! This Snowjade Roebuck’s strength virtually reached the peak of mortal beasts. It’s also just a step away from becoming a divine beast, yet it was actually killed by you!”

“With this, our Chen Village can have enough to eat and wear for half a year!”

“Following Patriarch Lie is truly our fortune!”

... ...

Everyone had praises for him. Toward Chen Lie, they expressed admiration from the bottom of their hearts.

In the Heavenspan World, mortals living outside of counties might suffer the attack of fierce beasts at any time.

An entire village being destroyed was also a common occurrence.

But Chen Village showed signs of moving toward prosperity under Patriarch Chen Lie’s leadership.

At least, they did not need to live days where they hid themselves from place to place.

Powerful strength was the foundation to live on.

A’Xiu squeezed in front of the people. Her eyes lit up as she said with surprise, “Uncle Lie, you’re really too impressive, to actually even defeat a Snowjade Roebuck. In my view, you might be able to break through to achieve Divine Dao someday! Don’t you think so, A’Ning?”

Ye Yuan had a vacant look and nodded along.

Chen Lie patted A’Xiu’s head and laughed as he said, “Silly lass, how can the Divine Dao be so easy to achieve? I know my strength. Being able to reach the peak mortal realm is already the limit! However ... I have high hopes of Yong-er!”

By the side, Chen Jian also smiled and said, “Yes! Yong-er’s strength will be able to catch up to the few of us old fellows in a few years. He is our Chen Village’s future!”

Hearing the praises of the elders, Chen Yong’s bashful flush carried a trace of smugness, giving Ye Yuan a glance that was somewhat demonstrating his strength.

Ye Yuan had another blank look and was at a loss on what to do.

Chen Lie directly threw the Snowjade Roebuck to his son and said heartily, “Cut off a bit more and deliver it to your Grandpa Yan. A’Ning, this Snowjade Roebuck is a great tonic. It’s greatly beneficial to your injuries.”

Chen Yong’s face turned black, immediately feeling annoyed.

While Ye Yuan smiled humbly and said, “Thank you, Uncle Lie.”

Everyone was very concerned about Ye Yuan in this village.

Although he lost his memories, he was very grateful to everyone.

“Oh, right, Uncle Yan, I found this when I entered the mountain this time.” As he said, Chen Lie carefully took out a package from his bag.

His actions were very careful, fearful of breaking the thing inside the bundle.

Opening up the bundle, a surge of boundless spiritual energy spread out.

Chen Yan’s expression changed and he cried out in surprise, “Spirit medicine! Divine rank spirit medicine, Jadeheart Grass! Although it isn’t fully matured yet, the spiritual energy inside has a 10% chance of letting you to break through to the Deity Realm!”

Chen Yan was an old man who enjoyed high prestige and commanded universal respect in the clan. His status was even above Chen Lie’s.

Because he was a mortal realm alchemist!

Hence, the moment he saw this spirit medicine, he recognized it.

The moment Chen Lie heard this, he was wild ecstatic and said with joy, “It’s indeed the case! That Snowjade Roebuck was guarding this thing and refused to leave no matter what. It was indeed for the sake of breaking through to achieve Divine Dao!”

Chen Yan nodded and said, “That’s right! If this Snowjade Roebuck swallowed the mature Jadeheart Grass, breaking through to Deity Realm would virtually be almost guaranteed! It’s just too bad that ... this old man is incapable and can’t refine the Jadeheart Pill. Otherwise, you breaking through to the Deity Realm would virtually be something that’s guaranteed! A shame! A shame!”

Chen Yan lamented and sighed, repeatedly saying that it was a shame. Clearly, he found it a great pity.

Jadeheart Pill was a divine pill. To him, it was something that could be looked at, but could not be touched.

Not forming a pill and directly eating was only wasting this stalk of divine medicine.

But Chen Lie was indifferent and said with a smile, “Uncle Yan, you don’t need to be like this. I plan on saving this Jadeheart Grass for Yong-er. His talent is greater than mine. He’ll definitely be able to break through to the Deity Realm when the time comes.”

But Chen Yan shook his head and said, “It’s no use! By the time Yong-er cultivates to peak mortal realm, the Jadeheart Grass’ spiritual energy will have more than half lost. At that time, it will also be no different from ordinary mortal-grade spirit medicines. Don’t get any ideas about planting it either. The nurturing of divine rank spirit medicines is extremely nitty-gritty and profound. This old man doesn’t have much assurance in being able to preserve its spiritual energy. Furthermore ... Luo Sheng is going to come and collect taxes tomorrow. Do you think that he’ll let this divine rank spirit medicine off?”

With this, Chen Lie’s expression became ugly.

By the side, Chen Yong’s expression also became very ugly.

A Deity Realm powerhouse held a great significance to a village.

As long as a Deity Realm powerhouse appeared in a village, their survival rate would greatly increase and they also would not need to be afraid of the invasion of fierce beasts anymore.

And this village would also become a powerful village in one stroke, dominating the lives and deaths of other villages!

Luo Sheng that Chen Yan spoke of was a Deity Realm powerhouse!

Therefore, the Luo Village was also the strongest village in the radius of ten thousand miles, the other villages had to bow their heads in submission.

“This ... There’s only 10% chance? It’s too wasteful!” Chen Lie said gloomily.

The others all fell silent, while Chen Yong had a look of self-reproach, secretly hating that his strength was not strong enough.

Right at this time, a discordant voice suddenly sounded out, “Why don’t ... I give it a try.”

Everyone looked towards Ye Yuan in surprise, the one who spoke was precisely him.

Chen Yong just happened to be in a bad mood. Hearing Ye Yuan speak, he completely erupted.

“What has it got to do with you here? What do you, a good-for-nothing who doesn’t even have essence energy, want to try? This is a quasi-divine rank spirit medicine. It’s not for you to play around with!” Chen Yong hollered at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan wiped the spittle on his face and still had a blank face.

Even he himself also did not know why he would say such a thing.

The moment A’Xiu heard, she was immediately indignant and put her hands on her hips and said, “What are you being fierce for? A’Ning had good intentions too! Moreover, Grandpa said before, A’Ning must have been an important person in the past. How do you know that he can’t do it?”

Chen Lie appeared slightly embarrassed as he said, “A’Ning, not that Uncle Lie doesn’t trust you, but ... you don’t even have essence energy.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Uhh ... makes sense.”

But by the side, Chen Yan was absorbed in thought and suddenly opened his mouth and said, “A’Ning, do you have the confidence of success?”

The others all used incomparably shocked gazes to look at Chen Yan, not understanding what he meant.

What methods could a cripple who did not even have essence energy have?

Ye Yuan was taken aback and shook his head and said, “I ... I don’t know either.”

Chen Yan asked curiously, “Then why did you say so just now?”

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “I don’t know either, it didn’t go through my brain earlier and I suddenly said it out loud.”

Chen Yan’s face revealed a pondering look. Finally, his gaze turned intent and he handed the Jadeheart Grass to Ye Yuan and said, “Come to my pill refining room. Whatever you need, take it yourself!”

Chen Lie had not said anything yet when Chen Yong directly lugged the Snowjade Roebuck and jumped up, saying in shock and anger, “Grandpa Yan! This is a quasi-divine rank spirit medicine!”
