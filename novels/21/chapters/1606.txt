Chapter 1610 Alchemy and Martial Dual Prodigy

Actually, Dustless also did not know whether this path would work or not. He only knew that this was an unprecedented path.

For Ye Yuan to be able to have his current accomplishments in the Heavenspan World, a very large degree was derived from this cultivation method.

He understood Ye Yuan’s mind. Giving up now for Ye Yuan was an unbearable outcome.

Since that was the case, then walk the path until it was dark.

Even if knocked until his head was broken and bleeding, it was also better than just being able to feel depressed in the end.

The confusion in Ye Yuan’s eyes was swept clean, what replaced it was a firm look.

He calmed his heart down and returned in front of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain again, and started comprehending Dao.

However, this did not bring him good luck. In a twinkle, another decade passed, the fourth level cultivation method still did not make the least bit of progress.

“Looks like drawing up plans behind closed doors won’t cut it. I have to go out and walk around, see if I can find the opportunity to break through,” Ye Yuan sighed and said.

“Mn, going out for a walk is good too. Your deduction is indeed hard to believe. At this rate, it won’t have any benefits to your cultivation.” Dustless agreed.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This is really an inconceivable thing. If the next realm isn’t Divine Lord Realm, then what is it? Can this path really work?”

These 20 over years, Ye Yuan had experienced no idea how many deductions. But the final results were all entirely contrary to the already mature cultivation system.

Before this, Ye Yuan had never thought that the Chaos Heavenspan Canon would walk to this current step.

It seemed to have entered a dead end.

Presently, the Heavenspan World’s cultivation system was already mature until it could not be any more mature that this.

After Origin Deity Realm, it was opening up an inner-world, evolving the power of the world for one’s own use, obtaining powerful unmatched strength from there.

But no matter how Ye Yuan deduced, it seemed to go against this realm.

Dustless smiled and said, “Time will prove everything! Go out and take a look, maybe one day, you’ll suddenly see the whole thing in a clear light.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and no longer hesitated, directly exiting seclusion.

The moment Ye Yuan came out of seclusion, Ning Tianping came to find hastily.

“Elder Ye, you finally exited seclusion! Right now, the imperial city is in an utter mess!” Ning Tianping said anxiously.

Ye Yuan was rather surprised as he said, “Why? Could it be that there’s still someone who demolished Heavenly Eagle Imperial City?”

Even though over 20 years had already passed inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space, merely two years plus had passed in the outside world.

This was not a very long time, no sudden turn of events should occur.

Ning Tianping said, “Not demolished, but it’s also pretty much there! Our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s face is already utterly lost.”

Only after hearing Ning Tianping’s report did Ye Yuan know what had happened.

Turned out that some time back, River Eternal Imperial City’s head elder brought several disciples and came to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, saying that there were important matters to discuss.

This was originally not a big deal. But among their group, there was a genius disciple called Gu Han. The moment they arrived at Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, he challenged the Pill Tower and Martial Tower’s disciples everywhere.

Not to mention, this Gu Han was really a rare genius that appeared once every ten thousand years.

In this one month, he practically challenged the Pill Tower and Martial Tower’s famous disciples, without any defeat!

This Gu Han was merely a half-step Divine Lord, but among the same rank martial artists, no one was his match at all.

The most terrifying thing was that this Gu Han was skilled in both alchemy and martial arts. Not only was his talent in martial arts exceedingly high, but he also turned his nose up at everyone in alchemy.

Ning Siyu was indignant and went to find Gu Han to challenge. In the end, she was also defeated.

After Song Qiyang broke through to Divine Lord Realm, becoming a Four-star Alchemy God, Ning Siyu was practically the number one person among Three-star Alchemy God disciples already.

Even she was defeated at Gu Han’s hands. Where would Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s face be put?

Most importantly, Gu Han alone challenged all of the Pill Tower and Martial Tower’s experts!

Hence, that was why Ning Tianping said that the imperial city was akin to being demolished.

Speaking of this, Ning Tianping said indignantly, “I only hate that I broke through too early. Otherwise, I’ll definitely teach that punk a brutal lesson! Elder Ye, you really don’t know how unbridled that punk is!”

When Ye Yuan heard that even Ning Siyu was defeated at Gu Han’s hands, he could not help being rather surprised.

Ning Siyu’s current Alchemy Dao strength, he had a score in his heart.

It was not that she was already invincible among Three-star Alchemy Gods, but the Three-star Alchemy Gods able to win her were really already very few.

One had to know, even Song Qiyang was defeated at her hands.

Even though Song Qiyang’s strength was not worth mentioning in front of Ye Yuan, his strength was very formidable, this left no room for doubt.

What was even more terrifying was that this kid was skilled in alchemy and martial arts. Not only was his alchemy powerful, but his martial arts also overwhelmed everyone, even defeating the rank one disciple of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s Origin Deity Realms.

But hearing finish, Ye Yuan was rather curious as he said, “Since he already defeated Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s young generation, then shouldn’t this matter already be over? What are you so anxious about?”

Ning Tianping said gloomily, “How can it be over so easily? That punk is currently challenging Song Qiyang right now! In martial arts, he’s unable to jump realms and battle. But this doesn’t hinder him in defeating Four-star Alchemy Gods in alchemy!”

Presently, over a hundred years had gone by, with Song Qiyang’s talent, breaking through to Divine Lord Realm was naturally not a difficult matter.

At present, he was already the Pill Tower’s low-level protector, a Four-star Alchemy God.

With his strength, he was also considered as a very formidable existence among initial-rank Four-star Alchemy Gods.

Defeating him was equivalent to smacking the faces of the Pill Tower’s Four-star protectors once more.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself when he heard and said, “This kid is really vicious enough!”

Indeed, alchemy competition was different from martial arts. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The competition of martial arts, Origin Deity Realms could not contend with Divine Lord Realms at all.

But alchemy was different. Even Four-star Alchemy Gods could not possibly refine all of the rank three divine pills too.

Even if one refined them, the grade refined was also hard to say.

Ning Tianping said indignantly, “Isn’t that so? You don’t know how the martial artists in the city are all talking about our Pill Tower and Martial Tower. It’s really losing face all the way back to our grandmother’s house.”

Ye Yuan patted his shoulder and said with a smile, “Bring me to go take a look.”

...

In the plaza of the Pill Tower, Song Qiyang was sweating profusely and had long cussed Gu Han’s eighteen generations of ancestors in his heart.

This kid is too despicable, to actually pick an extremely difficult medicinal pill.

Right now, refining it, it was exceptionally strenuous and might fail at any time.

After breaking through to Four-star Alchemy God Realm, one’s understanding of Alchemy Dao would become more profound along with the increase in realm.

Hence, refining rank three divine pills actually held an advantage.

But even so, he still struggled a lot.

The medicinal pill that they were refining was called Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill, belonging to the extremely difficult kind among rank three divine pills.

The refining difficulty of medicinal pills was not easy to grade, because each medicinal pill’s refining difficulty was different.

If insisting on dividing into levels, dividing according to level one to level nine, Gale Celestial Stone Pill, Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill, they should belong to level five, while the Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill pretty much belongs to level six.

As for the Vastsun Universe Pill this kind, it should belong to peak level nine!

After Song Qiyang broke through to Four-star Alchemy God, he could barely manage to refine level six difficulty rank three divine pills.

Therefore, his current refinement was very strained.
