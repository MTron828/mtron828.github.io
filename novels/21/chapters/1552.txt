Chapter 1556 So What If Picking a Quarrel With You All?

Ning Siyu stared at Ye Yuan, the confused look in her eyes becoming thicker and thicker.

She discovered that the things Ye Yuan said, she actually understood less and less!

What this guy talked about, was it really rank three alchemy knowledge?

But opposite of Ye Yuan, Xiao Feng had an appearance of learning with an open-mind, but his gaze became brighter and brighter, feeling a sense of enlightenment.

The agreed upon interaction became a one-sided clarification of doubts now.

At the same time, he was also shocked to the extreme in his heart.

Several decades had already passed since the two people had an exchange the last time.

He discovered that now, he was already completely unable to exchange with Ye Yuan on an equal footing.

What Ye Yuan talking about was another realm, giving him a feeling of beholding a great mountain.

However, he had a feeling of becoming enlightened all of a sudden right now. Some problems encountered these few years, under Ye Yuan’s answering, became transparent.

“You, kid, are really remarkable! In a short several decades, you actually made such great progress! We ... are already unable to talk as peers,” Xiao Feng said speechlessly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I also didn’t expect that ever since stepping into another realm, there’s a feeling of looking down from a high place. Many things that I didn’t understand in the past, I can have it at my fingertips now.”

Regarding this, Xiao Feng had his breath taken away and he said, “I really don’t know what kind of realm can let you improve until this point! Looks like this old man can’t just look forward blindly. According to what you say, the things that this old man left out in the realms before are seriously too many.”

Seeing that Xiao Feng understood to some extent, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Building a high-rise building, the foundation has to be deep. Otherwise, it will be a rootless weed and may collapse at any time. Regardless of whether alchemy or martial arts, the logic won’t change.”

Xiao Feng deeply felt that way too and said, “What my younger brother said is true! This old man will mend the pen after the sheep have been stolen when I go back[1]!”

The two people were just talking when Little Fatty pushed open the door and entered.

Xiao Feng looked over, his eyes involuntarily turning sharp.

An upheaval change seemed to have occurred to Little Fatty’s entire person.

The decadence on his face was swept clean away, his essence, energy, and spirit having a whole new outlook.

Especially his eyes, it became sharp and radiant, becoming like a different person from before!

The only thing that did not change was that round figure.

And Little Fatty’s realm also rose rapidly, his realm breaking through to half-step Origin Deity.

Just one more step and he could break through to Origin Deity Realm.

Seeing this scene, even Xiao Feng was unbelievably shocked.

This Heart Healing Heavenly Mark Pill that Ye Yuan took out was simply an uncanny work of the gods!

“Ye Yuan, this medicinal pill of yours is really too incredible! After I refine it, I simply have a feeling of being remould anew!” Little Fatty said with an excited look.

This feeling of being filled with power was truly long lost!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s of course! This Heart Healing Heavenly Mark Pill’s ingredients are extremely valuable. Even so, I collected ten sets of spirit medicines too and refined ten divine-grade Heart Healing Heavenly Mark Pills, picking out the one with the best quality and saving it for you.”

A divine-grade divine pill, the quality would have a minute difference too.

Toward his own good brother, Ye Yuan naturally would not be stingy.

When he was at the fiend race, he made use of his relationship with the Fiend Medicine Hall and Fan Family, and immediately collected ten sets of Heart Healing Heavenly Mark Pill’s spirit medicines.

If not for the materials being too precious, he even wanted to refine a hundred divine-grade divine pills, picking out the best one among them.

Little Fatty had a touched look and said, “Good brother!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Oh, right, you comprehend the law of wind. Later, I’ll find you refine a few Wind Language Pills. It should be a cinch for you to break through to the Origin Deity Realm.”

The Wind Language Pill was the Gale Celestial Stone Pill’s weak version. It could help Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artists comprehend the law of wind.

Xiao Feng and Ning Siyu were both speechless. With such a brother, breaking through was so effortless!

Dao Realm alchemists were really too frightening.

As long as Ye Yuan was given sufficient spirit medicines, he could even create an Origin Deity Realm army within a short hundred years!

“M-Master Ye!”

Right then, a shout came from outside the door.

Immediately after, it was a burst of footsteps.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, bringing everyone out to the lobby.

In the lobby, Huang Qian’s entire person was collapsed in a pool of blood, not an unscathed spot from head to toe.

A large group of people ahead surrounded the entire hall until not even water could seep through.

“Go, bring the person over for me!”

The one at the front was a half-step Divine Lord powerhouse who did not place Ye Yuan in his sights at all.

This person was called Guo Xingwang, Deyi Hall’s number one protector, his strength formidable.

As for Xiao Feng, he did not release his realm pressure. That person could not see through his depths at all.

A subordinate received the order and went, and was going to bring Huang Qian away.

“Master ... Ye, save ... save me!” Huang Qian used all of his strength and shouted to Ye Yuan.

Bang!

Ye Yuan raised a foot, and that subordinate immediately flew out, half-dead.

Guo Xingwang’s gaze turned cold and he said to Ye Yuan, “Punk, don’t think that you can be cocky by treating a few patients! This person is our Deyi Hall’s important criminal. Now, we’re going to capture him back. If you dare to poke your nose into what isn’t your business, I’ll tear down this little medicine shop of yours today!”

Guo Xingwang naturally knew about this Miracle Hand Parlor’s foundation. It was said that there was even a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse who took action that day. Furthermore, it was even a member of the Ning Family.

It was just that that member of the Ning Family seemed to be very hostile towards the Miracle Hand Parlor. They naturally could not be their backer.

Therefore, he did not place the tiny little Miracle Hand Parlor in his sights at all.

Even if Xing Guan came, he did not fear in the slightest too.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him. Bending down to check Huang Qian’s injuries, his brows involuntarily knitted together.

Huang Qian’s injuries were very severe. Furthermore, he was even poisoned with a potent poison.

If it were other alchemists, they would definitely be at the end of their ropes already.

Ye Yuan moved like lightning, tapping a few times on Huang Qian’s body, then fished out a healing medicinal pill and a Detoxification Pill, and stuffed them into Huang Qian’s mouth.

Huang Qian’s expression eased up and he directly fainted away.

When Guo Xingwang saw that Ye Yuan completely ignored him, he could not help burning with fury.

This punk was indeed as rampant as in the rumors!

“Kid, I think that you’re refusing a toast only to drink to a forfeit! Do you really think that by hanging a signboard, you can pick a quarrel with my Deyi Hall? Heh, just nice, Xing Guan isn’t around today, I’ll take care of you, this condescending brat, first!”

Guo Xingwang laughed coldly and directly grabbed at Ye Yuan.

A measly initial-stage Origin Deity, wouldn’t he mow him down with a snap of a finger?

Bang!

He was brought down in a snap of a finger!

In midair, Guo Wingwang sprayed fresh blood wildly, directly knocking into several subordinates before barely managing to stabilize his figure.

He scrambled to his feet, his gaze that looked towards Xiao Feng was full of shock!

A powerful aura instantly filled the entire hall. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

That was the aura of a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse!

At this instant, all of Guo Xingwang’s tyrannical aura completely became dim.

Wasn’t it said that the Ning Family Divine Lord Realm already returned to the inner city?

Where did another Divine Lord Realm powerhouse pop out from?

Just what background did this little medicine shop have?

Xiao Feng’s expression was slightly dark as he said, “A measly Deyi Hall, so what if picking a quarrel with you all?”

[1] Make up for things.
