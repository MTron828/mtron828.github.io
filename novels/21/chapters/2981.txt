Chapter 2980: If He Wants to Posture, What Has It Got to Do With Me?

“What vicious means! You punched through An Shan’s internal space. It’s equivalent to crippling half his life! Dealing such a vicious blow in my Dragon City Tribe, have you thought of the consequences?”

In a crowd, a Heaven Swallowing Python slowly swam out, immediately causing a commotion.

“It’s Lord Da Yi! He’s going to personally take action!”

“Lord Da Yi is ranked 75th on the Mountain Challenger List, his strength being very formidable. This kid is dead for sure!”

“He actually dared to cripple Lord An Shan, really courting death!”

… …

Da Yi’s status in the Dragon City Tribe was extremely high. The moment he took the stage, everyone clearly had worshipping looks.

That made sense, Da Yi’s ranking was gained from fighting match after match.

The moment Da Yi appeared, it gave people a feeling of being shaken to the core.

As if they were being stared at by someone from the netherworld; very uncomfortable.

“He’s very strong. You’re not his match! Mountain challenging isn’t done like how you’re doing it now!” Not far behind Ye Yuan, Feng Qingxuan warned.

What she was talking about was under the circumstances that Ye Yuan did not utilize dragon phoenix bloodline.

This was Ye Yuan’s trump card move. It was not good to expose it in front of outsiders.

Feng Qingxuan not being Ye Yuan’s match, that was just under the circumstance that he used Dragon and Phoenix Prosperity.

Just based on any single bloodline, Feng Qingxuan examined her own conscience and felt that she could absolutely crush Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s dragon race bloodline was only earth kun grade. Wanting to surpass the same level Da Yi was incredibly difficult!

Bloodline was not the only thing. Between same ranking bloodlines, the strength might have a huge difference. This had a lot to do with the individual’s talent and lucky chances.

Clearly, this Da Yi was very strong. Feng Qingxuan felt it!

Ye Yuan ignored her. This woman was so annoying!

“What a joke! He swallowed me the moment he opened his mouth. It was clearly to send me to my doom! Why? Only your Dragon City Tribe is allowed to kill people? I’m not allowed to retaliate?” Ye Yuan looked at Da Yi and said disdainfully.

These powerful tribes all had this kind of mentality.

I could kill you, but if you touched my people, death couldn’t expiate your sins

An Shan swallowed Ye Yuan in one gulp. He did not hold back in the slightest at all.

If not for that Ye Yuan’s strength was powerful, he would have already turned into nothingness now.

Now, Da Yi was actually blaming him for being vicious.

Da Yi’s expression turned cold, and he said, “Razor-tongued brat, do you dare to have a fight with me?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Do you think that I only came to bully that sort of weakling?”

Da Yi snorted coldly and said, “I hope that you don’t disappoint me too much!”

The two people mutually gifted a dragon-shaped mark, and the second mountain challenging battle officially began.

With regards to Ye Yuan challenging Da Yi, the Dragon City Tribe powerhouses were very disdainful.

Even if Ye Yuan won An Shan effortlessly, it was the same too.

After all, An Shan was already close to 500th place.

500th and 75th, there was an insurmountable gulf in the middle.

“This kid is really overestimating his own ability! He probably doesn’t even know what the Mountain Challenger List means, right?”

“Lord Da Yi challenged the Dragon Abyss Tribe’s Yun Kui the last time. After coming back, he has already been in closed-seclusion for three years! These three years, his strength must have advanced by leaps and bounds again!”

“This is good too! He dared to cripple Lord An Shan. Lord Da Yi will definitely make him regret it!”

“It’s just that I don’t know how many moves this kid can last under Lord Da Yi’s hands.”

… …

Da Yi stood in the air and said coolly, “Kid, make your move! Otherwise, you won’t have the chance.”

Ye Yuan could not help snickering when he heard it. Some people always liked to posture.

It was like if they did not posture, they would not be an expert.

When Da Yi saw Ye Yuan’s snickering, he practically wanted to explode.

This was merciless mocking!

However, his words were already thrown out. He still had to maintain the demeanor of an expert.

Either way, this kid was going to die very soon.

Ye Yuan was not courteous either. The bloodline power on the body surged. A shocking dragon pressure was released.

Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist!

The stronger his strength was, the more his bloodline improved, the more Ye Yuan felt the power of this move. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

This move that Mi Tian imparted had deeply gained the quintessence of dragon race bloodline.

Ye Yuan knew now that this move was created by Mi Tian himself. When cultivated to the extreme, one could blow a Hegemon Realm powerhouse up with one punch!

Furthermore, the stronger the bloodline, the greater the power!

If one executed it with chaos level bloodline, killing ordinary Hegemon Realms would be like playing.

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, Da Yi’s expression changed.

This punch was too strong!

Ye Yuan was two minor realms lower than him. He did not place him in his sights at all.

He was confident that no matter what moves Ye Yuan used, he could block it with ease.

But, if this punch landed, wouldn’t he be the same as An Shan, having a hole punched through?

In a hurry, Da Yi opened his gaping maws. A shocking energy ball was released from his mouth.

However, it was already too late!

He already lost the initiative in order to posture.

Ye Yuan had already accumulated his strength to the maximum. How terrifying was the power?

Boom!

The void shook violently, and Da Yi’s colossal body was smashed down like a cannon ball.

With Ye Yuan gaining the initiative, how could he be willing to let it go? Chasing after, it was another Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist.

Boom!

The earth fissured!

When experts exchanged moves, sometimes, it was a matter of an instant.

Ye Yuan gained the initiative and pummeled him in hot pursuit.

The Dragon City Tribe’s powerhouses were immediately dumbfounded.

They never dreamed that this battle would actually turn out like this.

The God of War Da Yi in their eyes was being brutalized by a human punk!

The two people fought from the sky into the earth and fought from underground, up to the sky again.

But Ye Yuan held the initiative from start to end.

It was completely a one-sided suppression.

The Heaven Swallowing Python’s physical body was extremely formidable. But at this time, Da Yi’s body had flesh and blood scattering, virtually battered down by Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan was extremely surprised too.

Da Yi was really strong. If it were any other grand completion Emperor Cloud Heaven, they would have long been turned to residue by him. But Da Yi was still holding on until now.

Although each move was a hasty response, it could always resolve the majority of Ye Yuan’s attack power.

In fact, he would even occasionally launch a counteroffensive.

Those lacking in strength would really let Da Yi make a comeback.

This kind of powerhouse was completely forged in battle. His strength was extraordinary.

It was just a shame. Who he ran into was Ye Yuan.

A fight was a fight; how was there time for you to posture?

Losing one move, you would lose every move!

Unsurprisingly, Da Yi did not have the chance to make a comeback either. Ye Yuan would not give him this chance.

Sometimes, fighting was this simple.

“I admit defeat!” Da Yi’s reluctant angry roar came from above the void.

Ye Yuan stopped. The Da Yi, who was opposite him, panted heavily. His body no longer had an unscathed spot.

Dragon City Tribe’s powerhouses opened their mouths wide with looks of disbelief.

“A-Admitted defeat just like that?”

“Lord Da Yi still has many trump cards that haven’t been used. Why… why did he admit defeat?”

“Despicable! Shameless! This punk won unscrupulously!”

… …

In an instant, Dragon City Tribe exploded.

Everyone was cursing Ye Yuan was being shameless. It sounded very nasty.

They were too clear about Da Yi’s strength.

But from start to finish, Da Yi did not have the chance to fight back.

Whatever big move, whatever trump card, he did not use them all.

This kind of battle was too aggrieved.

Da Yi himself virtually wanted to explode.

He lost this fight too aggrievedly!

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes. Was this group of people all morons?

If he wanted to posture, what had it got to do with him?
