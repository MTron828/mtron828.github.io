Chapter 1292: Shaming Bystanders to Death

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Liang Wanru panicked. She struggled, wanting to get up. But this kick was truly not light, she actually could not get up.

Watching that knife get closer and closer to Ye Yuan’s eyes, Liang Wanru started sobbing from anxiety.

Zhang Shun and the rest also looked at this scene helplessly. This missus was notorious for being cruel and cold-hearted. This boy actually dared to provoke the second miss, truly tired of living.

Glimpsing Liang Wanru’s expression with her peripherals, Liang Wanrong felt pleased with herself inwardly.

Liang Wanru being like this was what she wanted to see the most.

That appearance that remained indifferent to favor or disgrace, she hated it the most!

Liang Wanrong raised the knife and stabbed down viciously.

Everyone all could not bear to look at this scene, turning their heads over.

But after waiting for a long time, they did not hear Ye Yuan’s scream either.

Turning around and looking, each and every one of them could not help widening their eyes.

Bang!

The knife was thrown onto the ground. A hint of lust actually surfaced on Liang Wanrong’s face.

Her gaze was blurry, her face scarlet red. Her two hands actually started fondling on her body. A pair of hazy eyes stared straight at Zhang Shun, making goosebumps break out all over his body.

“Second Miss, you ...” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zhang Shun instinctively sensed that it was not good. Second Miss’s mannerism was clearly the tempo of going into heat!

Sure enough, the second miss came to Zhang Shun’s side with a lunge and directly wrapped around his waist, raised her head, and kissed Zhang Shun madly.

“Big Brother Shun, Rong-er has liked you for a long time! You ... take Rong-er, alright? Alright?’”

Liang Wanrong’s voice made Zhang Shun’s bones go soft.

All of the guards were utterly dumbfounded. This ... What kind of situation was this?

Truthfully speaking, Liang Wanrong was very beautiful, and it was also this coquettish attitude making her irresistible. How could Zhang Shun be unmoved?

Except, it was merely being tempted.

So many people watching, wasn’t it wanting his life?

Zhang Shun’s face turned pale with fright, hurriedly wanting to push Liang Wanrong away. But Liang Wanrong stuck onto him like a dog-skin plaster and refused to let go no matter what.

Liang Wanrong’s status in the Liang Family was extraordinary. Zhang Shun did not dare to deal a heavy blow either. His entire person almost went crazy.

“What are you guys still standing around for? Quickly pull Second Miss away!”

Zhang Shun’s scalp tingled and completely did not have the excitement of a beautiful girl delivering herself to the doorstep. If this were to be conveyed back to the Liang Family and be known by that shrew, he would be dead for sure.

Only then did the group of guards awaken from the dream and hurriedly went forward to pull Liang Wanrong away.

Liang Wanrong struggled and pulled Zhang Shun’s clothes desperately, not letting go.

Fortunately, the guards’ strengths were strong enough. The group of people swarmed forward before they could pull her off.

The current Liang Wanrong was disheveled, her upper body revealing large patches of snow-white skin, making the group of guards drool.

“Big Brother Shun, Rong-er really likes you a lot! Take Rong-er!”

Although being restrained, Liang Wanrong still pestered incessantly with infatuation.

Zhang Shun smoothed out his clothes, came before Liang Wanrong, and said with a salute, “Second Miss, sorry!”

Done talking, he chopped a palm at Liang Wanrong’s neck area. Liang Wanrong toppled with a grunt.

Finished doing these, Zhang Shun walked straight towards Ye Yuan.

After this bout of struggle, Liang Wanru finally recovered and got up from the ground.

Seeing this scene, she reached her hand out again and blocked in front of Ye Yuan.

Zhang Shun was stunned and said with a salute, “Eldest Miss, you also saw Second Miss’s condition, this brat’s origins are unknown. There’s a peculiarity. He’s probably not some good person! It isn’t good for you to defend him like this, right?”

Liang Wanru’s beautiful eyes flickered. Turning back and giving Ye Yuan a glance, she saw Ye Yuan’s calm appearance. She turned her head around and gestured towards Zhang Shun.

She pointed at Liang Wanrong. The meaning was that this incident was Liang Wanrong’s fault.

Zhang Shun felt his head swell. This matter, he saw it from beginning to end and naturally knew that it was Liang Wanrong finding trouble.

But Liang Wanru could say these words. He could not say it.

He was just a subordinate and could only turn the spearhead to Ye Yuan whose background was unknown.

However, he also did not perceive how Ye Yuan did it.

According to Dustless, these people were merely just a bunch of mortals.

Even though they were Dao Profound Realm mortals!

When he heard this theory, Ye Yuan also jumped in fright.

Dustless said that in the Heavenspan World, the realm when a martial artist was born, was mostly determined by the parents.

For example, the union of two Heavenly Emperor Realm powerhouses, the descendants born would at the minimum be Divine Lord Realm too. There was even a certain chance of giving birth to a True God Realm powerhouse!

In the legends, there were even Heavenly Emperor descendants who were born as empyreans!

Being True God Realm at birth, this was already winning on the starting line. Empyrean Realm was even more inconceivable.

At that time, Ye Yuan also found it fantastical.

The union of two ordinary Deity Realm powerhouses, the descendants born were mostly in the Dao Profound Realm.

Of course, the lowest was also being in the Dao Profound Realm.

Those in the Dao Profound Realm were called mortals in the Heavenspan World!

In the Immortal Grove World, the realm that the vast majority of martial artists pursued all their lives was also just mortals in this place.

But in the Heavenspan World, wanting to cultivate to the Deity Realm was far easier than the Immortal Grove World.

But even so, the greatest numbers in the Heavenspan World were still ‘mortals.’

Among this group of people, there was only one Deity Realm powerhouse, which was Zhang Shun.

Hence, even though Ye Yuan was unable to move, utilizing the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil to make Liang Wanrong succumb did not even count as the effort it took to raise a hand.

Liang Wanru’s protection made things very difficult for Zhang Shun.

“Boy, what on earth did you do to the second miss?” Zhang Shun’s gaze went past Liang Wanru and looked at Ye Yuan as he said.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Is Guard Zhang mistaken about something? I can’t even move right now, my divine essence completely lost. What do you think I can do? In my view, it should be that Miss Wanrong is really in love with Guard Zhang, right? Guard Zhang doesn’t have to be unduly humble either. You’re at any rate a Grotto Profound Deity Realm powerhouse and already transcended mortals. Even if something really happens with Miss Wanrong, it won’t humiliate her either.”

Zhang Shun’s face fell, he knew that Ye Yuan was talking rubbish.

Yet, Ye Yuan has spoken it so logically.

He had been staring at Ye Yuan all along just now and was confident that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to do anything that he did not know under his eyelids.

In truth, Ye Yuan really did not utilize a trace of divine essence.

After Ye Yuan broke through to Deity Realm, the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil recovered to the Deity Realm naturally.

With its cultivation, how could dealing with a mortal require utilizing any divine essence?

“Humph! Do you really take this Zhang to be easy to hoodwink? In this place, apart from you, who else would deal with Second Miss?” Zhang Shun said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Guard Zhang, you got to speak with conscience! You said that I did it, there has got to be proof, right?”

Ye Yuan did not think that Zhang Shun knew about the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil’s existence. This kind of ocular art was a matter between the two people. Outsiders could not detect it at all.

With Liang Wanru around, Zhang Shun did not dare to be too impudent as well.

After a long time, he did not find any evidence either to prove that Liang Wanrong going mad was caused by Ye Yuan, and could only drop it.

Around ten o’clock in the evening, Liang Wanrong slowly woke up and discovered that the surrounding guards’ gazes became odd.

She was suddenly startled, recalling her disgraceful scene during the day. Her face immediately flushed bright red.
