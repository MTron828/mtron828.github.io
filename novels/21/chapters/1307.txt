Chapter 1311: Divine-Grade Detoxification Pill!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Feng Ping and Manager Su slowly walked into the box room. Hong Yin was currently taking care of Liang Wanru.

“How is Miss Wanru?” Manager Su asked Hong Yin.

Hong Yin shook her head, her expression somewhat ugly as she said, “She already can’t swallow food. Probably can’t hang on much longer anymore.”

Manager Su sighed and said, “In the end, it still can’t make it! This girl ... What a shame!”

Feng Ping said, “How can divine-grade Detoxification Pill be so easy to refine? This old man already has half a foot stepped into the realm of Two Star Alchemy God and can’t refine it too. It’s not that this old man is looking down on Ye Yuan, but it’s impossible for him to refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill.”

Manager Su did not refute this. He said with a nod, “Ye Yuan is also arrogant at heart and haughty in manner, that’s why he would state such proud words at the Wang Family. Wang Lingbo made use of Ye Yuan’s proud words to expose the Myriad Treasure Tower’s misdeeds. This period of time, we are in a very passive position too!”

Ye Yuan let out grand words before coming out of the Wang Family’s residence. Not only was he going to resolve the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s poison, but he was even going to let Liang Wanru step into Divine Dao Realm and treat her so that she could speak.

These words were spread by the Wang Family and already caused a buzz in Jewelhill City.

The Poisonfeather Thousand Night was the Wang Family’s non-transmissible secret. People’s faces changed when talking about it.

Now, the Myriad Treasure Tower actually provoked the Wang Family like this. With this, there was really a good show to watch.

If when the time came, and the Myriad Treasure Tower could not cure Liang Wanru’s poison, this face would be slapped resoundingly. There would also be a tremendous impact on the Myriad Treasure Tower’s reputation.

Mentioning this, Feng Ping’s brows also knitted together tightly, and he said unhappily, “This child’s alchemy talent is indeed not bad. But he’s truly a bit too arrogant! Throwing down such drivel, disregarding that he lost face himself, it even made the entire Myriad Treasure Tower lose face along with him!”

Manager Su still protected Ye Yuan and said smilingly, “Well, young people got to be a little young and frivolous. That Wang Lingbo also indeed bullied people a bit too much. To actually have his niece humiliate Ye Yuan like so. Ye Yuan retaliating was also being infuriated by him.”

“Heh! He spoke lightly, but putting out a boast got to have the capital too! Right now, it’s not him slapping other people’s faces, but having his face slapped by others. He even implicated the entire Myriad Treasure Tower!” Feng Ping said unhappily.

The two people were currently chatting when a white silhouette swept in like a gust of wind.

“Hong Yin, how is Miss Wanru?” Ye Yuan asked rather worriedly.

Hong Yin shook her head and said, “Very bad! Miss Wanru has already reached the brink of death. Sir Ye ... please hold back your grief.”

Same as Su and Feng, Hong Yin likewise did not think that Ye Yuan could refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill.

Ye Yuan’s expression turned stern, and he hurriedly helped Liang Wanru up and discovered that her lips turned blackish-purple. Her complexion was white as paper; she was already completely unconscious.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he hurriedly fished out a medicinal pill, sending it into Liang Wanru’s mouth.

An alluring medicinal fragrance instantly filled the entire box room!

Manager Su, Feng Ping, their gazes turned intent, staring fixedly at the medicinal pill in Ye Yuan’s hand.

Even though it was just a very short time, they both saw it clearly!

The medicinal pill that Ye Yuan fed Liang Wanru was absolutely a one-star divine-grade Detoxification Pill!

But Ye Yuan had no time to care about the two people’s astonishment and said to Hong Yi, “Hong Yin, I’ll have to trouble you to use divine essence to help her refine the medicinal strength.”

Hong Yin was not as surprised as Su and Feng, because she had never seen before a divine-grade medicinal pill.

This level of medicinal pill, no matter which faction, they all cherished it dearly, and absolutely would not show it to outsiders.

“Oh, okay!”

Hong Yin voiced her assent and started using divine essence to help Liang Wanru refine the medicinal strength.

Manager Su and Feng Ping, the two people, they exchanged a glance, both seeing the look of astonishment from the other party’s eyes.

“Ye Yuan, that ... that was ... a divine-grade Detoxification Pill?” Manager Su asked probingly.

Seeing Liang Wanru’s complexion take a turn for the better, Ye Yuan finally heaved a sigh of relief, his face revealing a slight smile akin to being relieved of a heavy burden, and opened his mouth to say, “Yeah! Luckily, I made it in time! Otherwise, this Ye would really have to harbor regret for all my life.”

“This ... How is this possible? D-Divine-grade Detoxification Pill!” Feng Ping felt like his tongue almost could not be straighten up anymore.

The Detoxification Pill was just a very ordinary one-star divine pill. The difficulty was a little higher than the Divine Essence Pill.

But wanting to refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill, that was not what the average person could accomplish.

With Feng Ping’s realm, even if his luck was booming, he had never refined before a divine-grade Detoxification Pill either.

In the entire Jewelhill City, no one had this strength!

But Ye Yuan did it!

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Yeah! It’s really as hard as ascending to heaven for a pill to enter divine-grade! These few days, this Ye neglected sleep and meals, and by coincidence, I finally refined this Detoxification Pill!”

Manager Su and Feng Ping drew a cold breath. Although Ye Yuan seemed to have said it lightly, but that was divine-grade!

When Ye Yuan entered closed-seclusion, he could clearly only refine superior-grade Divine Essence Pill.

Only over 30 days had gone by, and he actually refined a divine-grade Detoxification Pill?

Unless ... Ye Yuan concealed his strength!

But Ye Yuan could not be bothered with the two people’s astonishment. His attention was all on Liang Wanru.

“Ugh ...”

Liang Wanru emitted a voice as faint as a mosquito. This made Ye Yuan greatly roused.

The divine-grade Detoxification Pill really worked!

Very soon, Liang Wanru’s lip’s purple-black color gradually faded away. Her face also gradually became rosier.

Hong Yin already finished refining the medicinal strength. Seeing this scene, she could not help being greatly astonished and looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief as she said, “Sir Ye, you ... you really did it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and nodded his head.

To be honest, Ye Yuan also felt very accomplished right now.

Previously, he completely purged some distracting thoughts and totally never thought about these issues. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

But now, seeing Liang Wanru take a turn for the better, these thoughts emerged uncontrollably.

Divine pills to him was a completely new territory!

However, he relied on his talent and hard work to refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill. This was absolutely something to be proud of.

Because Ye Yuan knew how difficult it was to refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill!

Finally, Liang Wanru slowly woke up, a pair of beautiful eyes gradually becoming limpid.

But when she saw Ye Yuan, the gratitude in her gaze could not be concealed no matter what, wanting to struggle to stand up.

Ye Yuan hurriedly held her down and said, “Don’t think about anything. You’re still very weak right now. Wait for the toxins in your body to be completely purged before talking. Miss Wanru, when I was at the Wang Family, I told Wang Lingbo before that not only was I going to treat your poison, I’m even going to have you open your mouth and talk, stepping into the Divine Dao Realm! Let those people who bullied you see that you can live even better than them!”

Liang Wanru could not speak, but hearing Ye Yuan’s words, she also felt her heart surged.

Stepping into the Divine Dao Realm, she did not care.

But being able to open her mouth and talk, was the one thing that she most desired in the depths of her heart!

Feng Ping and Manager Su also trembled all over. Only then they recalled those ‘proud words’ Ye Yuan left behind at the Wang Family.

Just earlier, they still felt that Ye Yuan was too arrogant, and even dragged down the Myriad Treasure Tower.

But now, they finally knew that Ye Yuan’s words were not empty talk!

His alchemy talent was too terrifying. Probably no one could have expected that Ye Yuan really had this strength to smack the Wang Family’s face resoundingly!

Manager Su and Feng Ping, these two people exchanged a glance, their faces both revealing a smile.

With this, Wang Lingbo really shot himself in the foot!
