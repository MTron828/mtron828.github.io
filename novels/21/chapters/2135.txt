Chapter 2139: Little Xun Admires

Inside the dense woods, Long Xun three people were in front, faltering.

Ye Yuan slowly followed behind, very casual.

Along the way, Ye Yuan consecutively took action several times and it was all insta-kills, frightening Long Xun badly.

At the thought of posturing in front of Ye Yuan previously, Long Xun even had the heart to die.

“Big Brother Xun, this ... this human is too horrifying! You can’t deal with him!” Ao Ming whispered.

“Pooh! What are you freaking rubbing my nose in it for? Want to kill me is it?”

Long Xun was frightened by these words until he broke out in a cold sweat and almost finished Ao Ming off in a rage.

Ao Ming also shuddered and said, “Big Brother Xun, I ... I didn’t do it on purpose. However, what is he picking tarnished black devil crystals for? That thing’s corrosive power is extremely strong. Even our dragon race’s fleshy bodies can’t bear it either!”

“How would I know? Maybe he has a hobby for collecting those black crystals! But even if this thing is placed inside storage rings, it will also cause irreversible corrosion to people,” Long Xun said with uncertainty.

Along the way, he was also very curious.

It was just that he was startled by Ye Yuan’s strength and did not dare to open his mouth at all.

Powerful abyss monsters were as weak as paper in front of Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan killed them as easily as killing chickens and slaughtering dogs.

“Alright, this place should be safer. We can stop for a while,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The moment Long Xun heard, he hurriedly ran over and asked: “Your Excellency, what instructions do you have?”

Ye Yuan said, “I collected quite a few tarnished black devil crystals along the way. So I’m going to cultivate for a while. You guys protect me.”

The moment these words came out, Long Xun three people’s eyes went wide and he opened his mouth wide and asked, “Y-Y-Your ... Your Excellency is going to use tarnished black devil crystals to cultivate? I-I-I ... didn’t hear you wrongly, right?”

Long Xun was too surprised, resulting in his tongue being tied even when talking.

Long Xun even thought that Ye Yuan had some weird hobby, who knew that Ye Yuan was actually using this to cultivate.

Using such pure devilish energy to cultivate, wasn’t this courting death?

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Why? Is there a problem?”

Long Xun said, “These ... These tarnished black devil crystals are the crystallization of abyss monsters’ devilish energy, it’s where their essence is located. The devilish energy contained inside is extremely harmful to martial artists. You ... You’re actually going to use it to cultivate? How to cultivate?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I have my own ways. You just need to care about standing guard.”

Ye Yuan casually laid down a few array formations and started cultivating on the spot.

One ball of black energy after another flowed out of the tarnished black devil crystals, being absorbed into the body by Ye Yuan.

This scene appeared extremely strange.

Long Xun three people’s eyes went wide, their face dumbfounded. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“He really absorbed devilish energy! My god, his absorption speed is also too fast! Isn’t he afraid of blowing up?” Ao Ming said dumbfounded.

“Heard that there are some people among humans that are eager for quick success and will frequently cultivate some unorthodox paths. Could it be that he’s that kind of martial artist?” Long Qing said.

Smack!

Long Xun directly gave him a slap at the back of his head and scolded, “Fool! His Excellency’s divine essence undulation is incomparably pure! How does he look like a devil cultivator? Also, His Excellency’s divine essence is incomparably thick, far surpassing same rank powerhouses. Are you freaking blind? Which Eighth Firmament True Gods have you seen that have such horrifying strength?”

Long Qing had an innocent look. But thinking about it, it was also true.

Ye Yuan’s divine essence was incomparably pure and orthodox. It was impossible to be a devil cultivator.

But this kind of cultivation means still brought him incredible shock.

“But ... But this is also too peculiar! Forget about a human! Even if it’s the fiend race, they also don’t dare to absorb tarnished black devil crystals like this!” Long Qing said indignantly.

Long Xun looked at Ye Yuan with worship and said, “His Excellency isn’t an ordinary person! This devilish energy is merely a form of energy in the end. Abyss monsters are able to make use of it to become incomparably powerful. In theory, the human race and demon race should naturally be able to utilize it too. It’s just that ordinary cultivation methods are completely unable to stop the devastation of the devilish energy. Looking at it this way, His Excellency’s cultivation method must be extremely impressive!”

Long Xun had some knowledge and understood it very quickly.

Only when the other two people heard did they come to a realization. But their eyes when looking at Ye Yuan gradually turned from fear to respect.

The devilish energy that they feared like a tiger actually became a great tonic to Ye Yuan.

“Tsk tsk, really too incredible! I can even feel that His Excellency’s realm is rising rapidly. This is Eighth Firmament True God!” Ao Ming said with a sigh of admiration.

The other two people deeply felt that way too.

After several days, Ye Yuan refined all of the tarnished black devil crystals. His realm had a considerable rise once more.

Long Xun immediately moved close and said with a fawning look, “Your Excellency is really too incredible, to actually use the tarnished black devil crystals as divine essence stones! Little Xun admires!”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes at him and said, “Enough boot-licking, go!”

“Alright! Your Excellency, Little Xun will follow you in the future. You mustn’t discard Little Xun!” Long Xun thickened his skin and said.

In this Dragon Eye Cave, was there anything more useful than latching onto a thick thigh?

With a powerhouse like Ye Yuan around, as long as they did not encounter Empyrean Realm abyss monsters, they could practically do whatever they pleased.

This way, the chances of finding a spatial rift would also increase greatly.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “That will have to depend on your performance.”

... ...

Ye Yuan brought the three people and pushed through all the way. Half a month later, the party arrived in a valley. This place was the base of Long Xun and the rest.

However, inside the base was full of desolation, everything in a terrible mess like it had just experienced a great battle.

“Big Brother Xun! It’s Big Brother Xun who returned!”

Inside the dense woods by the side, several people suddenly scurried out.

When these people saw Long Xun, each and every one of them was inexplicably agitated.

“Shouting and wrangling for what? Eh? Xiaochun, what’s wrong with you?”

Long Xun was just about to berate the few people and make them offer greetings to Ye Yuan, but he discovered and each and every one of them had bloody noses and swollen faces, all carrying injuries on their bodies.

When Long Chun saw Long Xun, he actually burst out crying with a ‘wah’.

“Big Brother Xun, we’re so miserable these few days that you weren’t around!” Long Chun had snot and tears running. Looks like these few days, they were oppressed.

Long Xun frowned and said, “Shut up for me! Speak! What in the world happened?”

Long Chun complained tearfully, “Big Brother Xun, it ... it was all done by Long Zhaotian! He left the words, setting a time limit for you to surrender within three months! If you don’t surrender, he’ll raze our base to the ground and let us not even have a place to stay.”

Long Xun was greatly enraged the moment he heard and howled: “Motherf*cking Long Zhaotian! F*cking hell, when the tiger isn’t home, the monkey calls himself king! Brothers, follow me, I’ll go and pummel the sh*t out of this guy right now!”

As he said, Long Xun was just about to rampage but was held back by Long Chun.

“Big Brother Xun, you mustn’t! Long Zhaotian he found an Empyrean Realm helper! He’s formidable to the extreme. We aren’t a match! Even their camp already changed their leader too!”

Long Chun’s words were like a basin of cold water splashing down, drenching Long Xun until his heart turned cold.

“W-What did you say? E-Empyrean?” Long Xun said with a stupefied face.

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly opened his mouth and said, “Just an Empyrean. Look how it scared you until you’re like a grandson.”

The moment Long Chun heard Ye Yuan talk like this, he immediately spoke up to scold, “Who the hell are you, to dare speak to Big Brother Xun this way?”
