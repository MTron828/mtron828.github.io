Chapter 2925: Accidentally Cleared the Stage!

“Tempering the soul body!”

Many people could not help crying out in surprise.

Tempering the soul body in the Soul Controlling Avenue, this act was also too crazy!

Although the Soul Controlling Avenue had the effect of tempering the soul body in itself, everyone did not dare to stay for a time.

The fighting spirit aroused by the first roll of drums was depleted by the second and exhausted by the third.

Once it stopped, the violent storm-like divine soul attacks would completely knock you unconscious.

Even a powerhouse like Qin Shitian only dared to stop briefly at the first two segments too.

After entering the third segment, it was impossible to stay for a time anymore.

But Ye Yuan had been tempering his soul body all the way from the first segment. This was simply too crazy.

“This ... He wouldn’t keep on tempering, right? Then wouldn’t he be able to break through all the way to the tenth segment?” An examiner could not resist asking.

“Before entering the Soul Controlling Avenue, he should only be two wroughts!! Now, he actually broke through two wroughts consecutively! This boy’s Dao heart is firm. He indeed has incredible willpower! However ... it just about ends here too! Such tempering is very harmful to the soul body. If he doesn’t withdraw in the fifth segment, he’ll turn to ashes!” Great Emperor Eastsun shook his head and said.

Only after hearing this did Qin Shitian involuntarily let out a sigh of relief.

Just now, hearing that Ye Yuan was actually tempering the soul body, he broke out in cold sweat too.

In that case, could Ye Yuan keep on breaking through and upgrading continuously?

It turned out that it was a false alarm.

“Humph! A guy who curries favor by claptrap, don’t withdraw if you have the capability!” Qin Shitian said disdainfully.

In his heart, he naturally hoped that Ye Yuan would turn to ashes.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan stepped into the fifth segment.

The pressure increased again!

If it was a normal soul race cultivation method, he would naturally be unable to withstand this kind of damage.

But the Divine Emergence was the soul race’s supreme soul canon with endless wonders.

Ye Yuan’s soul body looked very contorted, but actually, the damage was not that great because his recovery ability was extremely shocking.

Of course, this process was extremely painful.

But pain was really nothing to Ye Yuan.

Clearly, after entering the fifth segment, the soul body was in even greater agony. Ye Yuan’s soul body became even more contorted too.

However, Ye Yuan was still persisting in moving forward.

Qin Shitian’s gaze flickered, secretly encouraging in his heart: That’s right! Just like this! Don’t pull out! Come on! Come on!

Just as he wished, Ye Yuan did not pull out. He kept persevering.

Then he reached the sixth segment’s checkpoint too.

Everyone held their breathing again!

Could it be that Ye Yuan was going to break the record too, becoming the second examinee to break through to the sixth segment today?

Ye Yuan did not hesitate, taking a stride over.

The pressure increased again!

Then ... Ye Yuan broke through!

Five wroughts!

Great Emperor Eastsun’s expression somewhat could not be maintained anymore.

He predicted just now that if Ye Yuan still did not withdraw, he would turn to ashes.

Now, Ye Yuan broke through to the sixth segment. His soul body broke through to five wroughts too!

As if he was slapping his face!

Many people cast strange gazes over.

Just now, wasn’t it you who said that if Ye Yuan still did not withdraw, he would die?

“This kid must have some mystic art that can rapidly recover the soul body! However, no matter how strong the mystic art is, it’s impossible for him to tide over the sixth segment too!” Great Emperor Eastsun said with certainty.

As if he was regaining some face for himself.

Everyone came to a sudden realization. Ye Yuan naturally had some reliance to dare to temper his soul like this.

Hall Master was a great emperor. His words could still be trusted.

In reality, that was indeed the case too.

It was just that he did not know that Ye Yuan’s mystic art was the supreme sacred canon of the soul race!

Then Ye Yuan got closer to Qin Shitian’s record bit by bit.

Qin Shitian’s expression also started to become ugly little by little.

This was like the tortoise and hare. That tortoise at the back got closer to him little by little!

This kind of feeling was like being roasted on a fire.

Arduous!

“Die! Why haven’t you died yet! The sixth segment’s divine soul attacks are so terrifying. Why hasn’t he died yet?”

Qin Shitian shouted crazily in his heart, cursing Ye Yuan to turn to ashes.

But very sadly, he did not!

Ye Yuan’s footsteps were difficult but sturdy.

“200 feet! Tied!”

When Ye Yuan took a stride, someone suddenly cried out in alarm.

The people came to a sudden realization. It turned out that Ye Yuan already tied with Qin Shitian’s record!

The powerhouses present seethed with excitement again!

No one expected that a brand new record that virtually no one could surpass was broken on the same day!

Many people’s faces felt fiery hot. Earlier, they lavished Qin Shitian with praises crazily, trampling Ye Yuan until he was utterly worthless.

But now, Ye Yuan was on the verge of breaking Qin Shitian’s record!

Qin Shitian’s expression was almost contorted.

Trampled again!

At the Lucid Forest, it was instant kill!

At the Soul Controlling Avenue, it was boiling the frog slowly in warm water!

From the fifth segment until now, he was like a frog that was slowly being boiled.

Then ... he was cooked!

He wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into now.

The posturing earlier seemed extremely laughable now.

Zhou Yu and He Chen stopped talking too. They used Ye Yuan to give vent earlier. Now, Ye Yuan was feeding them shit.

This slap was extremely resounding.

But the surprise that Ye Yuan created was clearly not enough yet!

Then, he stepped into the seventh segment!

“Hiss ...”

Everyone drew a breath of cold air!

Seventh segment!

To everyone present, including those Emperor Realms, this was something that was unimaginable.

Nobody could do it!

Great Emperor Eastsun’s expression became even uglier.

He tried to regain some face, but he discovered that his face was beaten more and more swollen!

Below the Soul Controlling Avenue, it was deathly silent.

Everyone just looked at Ye Yuan like that, looking at his solo performance.

They already did not know what they should say.

This test already became Ye Yuan’s solo show!

Amidst the deathly silence, Ye Yuan was still advancing!

Seventh segment!

Eighth segment!

Ninth segment!

With each segment that he passed, everyone’s hearts seemed to thud heavily.

When Ye Yuan crossed the ninth segment and entered the tenth segment, the air seemed to have solidified.

“I-It’s the tenth segment already?”

“If say that the first segment is a light drizzle, then the tenth segment is the sky being rent asunder and the earth split open! How can this guy endure it?”

“This guy is simply a freak! At this Soul Controlling Avenue, he forcibly broke through from two wroughts to peak eight wroughts!”

... ...

They already did not know what to use to describe their current mood.

Before this, they did their best to lavish praise, lauding Qin Shitian’s achievement until it was number one under the heavens!

But now, compared to Ye Yuan, he was nothing!

Tenth segment was too crazy!

This legendary checkpoint was indeed formidable!

Even if Ye Yuan cultivated the Divine Emergence, this round was quite strenuous too.

But, along with his soul body getting stronger and stronger, his comprehensions in the Divine Emergence’s second level also became deeper and deeper.

His Divine Emergence already gradually showed signs of grand completion. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He needed an opportunity to break through to the third level!

One step, another step!

Ye Yuan got nearer and nearer to the peak tenth segment.

Everyone’s hearts failed to live up to expectations and beat faster and faster.

They felt as if their chest were about to explode.

Suddenly, a terrifying thought emerged in their minds.

Clearing the stage?

There was actually someone who could clear the stage in the Soul Controlling Avenue?

How long had this not happened when looking across the entire Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven?

Finally, Ye Yuan took a step out, blue skies that spanned for ten thousand miles!

“Uh ... I accidentally cleared the stage,” Ye Yuan looked back at the Soul Controlling Avenue and said somewhat absent-mindedly.
