Chapter 2245: Sword, Come!

Suddenly, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body changed.

Between heaven and earth, a mysterious and profound airflow was slowly flowing.

This air current got stronger and stronger, and increasingly intense.

The long robe on Ye Yuan’s body moved on its own without wind.

“Mn? My sword!”

“What’s wrong with my sword?”

“My sword too!”

... ...

Even further away, those powerhouses who had already escaped Asura Blood Sea in advance detected one after another that the swords on their bodies were vibrating!

Even those being kept in their storage space, their swords were roaring without ceasing too, practically breaking out of its shell!

Ye Yuan stood proudly in the sky and actually seemed to have immortal qi swirling around him.

The current Ye Yuan stood proudly, his disposition being indifferent, having the air of a grandmaster of his generation.

This was not him pretending to be profound, but his casual indifference after comprehending Dao.

The instant the bone sword shattered, Ye Yuan felt his heart being affected.

Between the furious attacks, he actually spent more effort on comprehending Dao!

Alchemy Dao and Sword Dao, even the laws such as spatial law, time law, and others that Ye Yuan comprehended, there were many and extremely varied.

But in martial arts, Ye Yuan’s most fundamental strength was still Sword Dao

His spatial law was displayed to the extreme because of Sword Dao. That was how he drew parallels from inference and comprehended.

Sword Dao was Ye Yuan’s most fundamental comprehension.

Thinking about back then, Ye Yuan comprehended the sword amidst the rain of sacred cherry blossoms, and he created Falling Flower Floating Zero.

That time was merely playing around, but he could comprehend sword intent easily.

But ever since cultivating the martial path anew, Ye Yuan was gone with the wind on the path of Sword Dao.

For so many years, Ye Yuan was used to having a sword accompanying by his side and traveling the world.

One sword could slay demons and devils!

One sword could overawe the sun and moon!

One sword could shatter the firmament!

However, that instant when the bone sword shattered, he suddenly produced a trace of insight.

He seemed to be overly reliant on external items.

If there was a sword in the heart, why was there a need to use the sword?

The sword was the desire in the chest, why was there a need for other people’s power?

The extreme of the sword, falling petals and leaves could hurt people, vegetation and rolling pebbles were all swords!

While Empyrean spirit treasure, Heavenly Emperor spirit treasure, they were able to greatly increase the strength of the person using the sword.

But the most powerful was not the treasure, but the swordsman themselves!

“Sword, come!”

Ye Yuan reached his hand and beckoned, those swords vibrating in the sword sheaths could not endure it anymore, flying out.

However, what flew over were not the swords themselves, but a wisp of sword spirit!

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned, extracting all the sword spirits within a radius of ten million miles!

For some time, one streak of sword light after another tore across the sky. It was akin to a meteor showing arriving with a howl.

That scene was spectacular!

Those ‘meteor showers’ finally converged in Ye Yuan’s hand, condensing into a sword of light!

Ye Yuan gripped the light sword in his hand, exuding an imposing aura of disdaining all under the heaven that was revealed unnaturally.

Daymeld’s pupils constricted, expression changing wildly as he cried out in surprise, “This boy actually directly comprehended the source of Sword Dao! It ... It was me who shattered his Empyrean spirit treasure! That’s how it let him gain enlightenment on Dao?”

At this very moment, Daymeld felt extremely conflicted.

An Empyrean spirit treasure exchanging for comprehending the source of Sword Dao, this sort of thing was simply preposterous.

However, this was single-handedly facilitated by him.

He was just shocked in his heart, Ye Yuan’s comprehension ability was a little too terrifying.

He was actually comprehending Dao while fighting earlier!

How could Daymeld know that this was just a normal state for Ye Yuan?

He always comprehended Dao while fighting inside the Death Cultivation Space.

Because only that way could he walk out of the Death Cultivation Space!

In the course of time, being distracted with comprehending Dao in a fight was nothing much to Ye Yuan anymore.

“Myriad things in the world could be used as a sword, myriad swords in the world heeding orders! This ... This is already prying straight at the source of Sword Dao!”

“Just what is this brat’s head made out of? He directly leapfrogged Eighth Firmament Sword Dao and comprehended the source of Sword Dao? That’s something that can only be comprehended by Deva Realm powerhouses!”

“Freak! Simply a freak! The laws that this brat comprehended are virtually all of the world’s strongest! No wonder he doesn’t even take the divine race seriously! I just don’t know just who is stronger or weaker between him and this divine race ancestor!”

... ...

These Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were all shocked until it could not be greater.

The might of the divine race, they already felt it deeply.

But Ye Yuan’s monstrous comprehension ability made them even more appalled.

But at this very moment, they naturally hoped that Ye Yuan could win!

After all, this divine race ancestor did not have friendly intentions.

If the divine race ancestor won, they would all have to die.

Suddenly, Daymeld’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “So what if Sword Dao source? What this ancestor represents is Heavenly Dao! Heavenly Dao is for my use. What does mere Sword Dao source count for? Heavenly Dao Cang Huang, exterminate for me!”

On Daymeld’s body, horrifying Dao mark undulations aroused the descend of Heavenly Dao.

That horrifying pressure made heaven and earth trembled.

At this time, whatever cultivation realm, whatever power of laws, was simply weak to the max.

In terms of power, the divine race ancestor completely crushed Ye Yuan.

After all, he was a terrifying existence on equal footing as Dao Ancestors!

Being augmented by Heavenly Dao, Daymeld’s move would surely be heaven-shocking.

Only to see his fingertips circle and was about to point a finger out in a blink of an eye.

Everyone seemed to have foreseen this terrifying attack.

However, right at this time, a voice that seemed to come from the edge of the sky suddenly descended! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Immobilize!”

Everything abruptly stopped!

Daymeld’s heart shook wildly!

In his eyes, Ye Yuan’s light sword chopped straight down!

Swish ...

That sword energy that slashed apart the firmament made Daymeld’s entire person feel a chill from the bottom of his heart.

An aura of death hit him head-on.

He had roamed the world unobstructed for God knows how many hundreds of millions of years. There were virtually no existences that could pose a threat to him.

Even when besieged by eight great Deva Realm experts back then, he had never felt so close to death before too.

One sword landing, a long rift was torn open in space.

At the critical juncture, how could Daymeld still dare to hold anything back?

His whole body’s Dao marks surged, breaking free of the fetters of Heavenly Dao true word in that instant.

Quicker than words could tell!

Ye Yuan knew that Time Freeze was unable to imprison Daymeld for too long. But he only needed that split second and it was enough!

Puchi!

Daymeld shifted sideways slightly, evading this certain-kill sword.

But he ultimately failed to evade it completely.

Daymeld’s left arm was directly chopped off by this sword.

The berserk sword energy flew past, directly annihilating his left arm.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, clearly very dissatisfied with this result.

“Looks like I still underestimated you! However, if one sword can’t do it, another sword then!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, raising the light sword once more, and was about to chop down.

Daymeld’s pupils constricted and he threw a silver thing towards the huge pit with a swoosh, roaring wildly, “Take the Silvernet Blood Essence that you want!”

At the same time he threw out the Silvernet Blood Essence. Daymeld’s figure shot toward the distance explosively. He actually fled with his tail between his legs.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, taking a stride out, speeding toward the Silvernet Blood Essence and grabbing it in his hand.

While Daymeld already made use of this interval and made his get-away.

Ye Yuan grabbed the Silvernet Blood Essence in his hand, urging array formations to seal it, and right away he felt that his whole body was exhausted.

He smiled bitterly and said, “Lucky that guy got scared. How could I still have the strength to deal him another slash?”
