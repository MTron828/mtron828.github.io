Chapter 2612: Boycott

“Wen Jingxuan, even if you watch here eagerly every day, it’s also impossible for that brat to come out! When sect disciples enter the Land of Exile, the casualties are extremely high even if they travel in groups; let alone that he’s alone? I reckon that brat already died god knows how long ago!”

Han Qianyun looked at the Wen Jingxuan with a haggard face as he said those words very smugly.

In a blink of an eye, it had already been nearly 20 years. There was no news from Ye Yuan.

Right now, in Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, everyone already thought that Ye Yuan was long dead.

But these days, Wen Jingxuan would practically come to Flowing Cloud Peak every day. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Wen Jingxuan ignored Han Qianyun and did not even glance at him.

“Heh,?if not for that punk, how could our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect be sanctioned by the Pill Alliance and fallen to this point now? The sect from top to bottom currently hates that boy to the bones! Yet, you, this lass, fail to appreciate favor and still yearn for him to come back? Forget that he’s not coming back; even if he got incredibly lucky and came back, he’ll also have to be sanctioned by the Elders Council!” Han Qianyun said with a cold smile.

These 20 years that Ye Yuan entered the Land of Exile, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s days had not been easy.

In the beginning, the Alchemist Hall’s development went very smoothly, the heavenly alchemists’ strength also grew with each passing day.

But the good times did not last long, in the second year that Ye Yuan entered the Land of Exile, the Pill Alliance launched an attack!

The Pill Alliance launched an extremely harsh blockade against the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

Firstly, the Pill Alliance withdrew all cooperation with the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect and made all heavenly alchemists related to the Pill Alliance withdraw.

In fact, the Pill Alliance completely cut off the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect in terms of the supply of heavenly medicines and heavenly pills.

This move was really destroying the ground on which one stood on.

For a colossal sect like the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, the number of heavenly medicines and heavenly pills that it consumed every day was a huge quantity.

All at once, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect ran out of food.

Without the supply of heavenly medicines and heavenly pills, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect plunged into a crisis all of a sudden.

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s heavenly alchemists were unable to satisfy the needs of the massive sect in the first place.

For so many years, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect needed to buy large numbers of heavenly medicines and heavenly pills from the Pill Alliance.

The supply of the sect’s heavenly pills dropping sharply would have a huge impact on the cultivation of the disciples.

Now, more than ten years had passed. The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was struggling more and more to make ends meet.

As a result, many disciples’ hearts have started wavering.

Starting from a few years earlier, many people turned the spearhead toward Ye Yuan, feeling that all these were caused by him.

Among them, Shi Feiyu was the most lively.

Hence, everyone related to Ye Yuan was affected.

Now, Lin Lan was relegated to a miscellaneous affairs servant and had his fill of contemptuous looks.

Wen Jingxuan was even going to be sent to the Pill Alliance to be Qin Shun’s furnace!

Within the next few days, she would be setting off soon!

There was also Luo Yunqing going along with her!

Luo Yunqing was going to represent the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect to accept a false accusation.

To him, this was simply unprecedented shame!

But there was no choice.

This matter could not be delayed.

Although the one who made the decision was Feng Xuanyi, as the sect master, what Feng Xuanyi represented was the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s final face.

Hence, he could only sacrifice Luo Yunqing.

Now, even Feng Xuanyi could not hold on anymore too!

When Han Qianyun saw Wen Jingxuan ignore him, he could not help but feel angry.

He snorted coldly and said, “Are you still hoping for that brat to be able to save you??Humph!?If he really comes out, I, Han Qianyun, will be the first one to not let him off! What bullshit elder, he’s our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s sinner! Now, the other four great heavenly sects are all watching us as a joke. This was all single-handedly caused by him!”

When Ye Yuan entered the Land of Exile back then, it shocked the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

What was even more aggravating was that Ye Yuan even stepped on his face.

This matter became the entire sect’s butt of a joke!

He, Han Qianyun, had always remembered it!

Wen Jingxuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “If Master comes out, the first one he’ll take care of will definitely be you!”

Han Qianyun was furious and gave Wen Jingxuan a slap and said, “Little wench, do you still think that you’re an elder’s disciple? You’re merely a commonplace ware now!”

Five fingerprint marks could be seen distinctly on Wen Jingxuan’s face.

Han Qianyun did not go easy!

She glared at Han Qianyun hatefully, her eyes full of fury.

This master and apprentices few people did not stint with doing evil these few years.

She was still alright, but Lin Lan’s outcome was very miserable.

If not for Luo Yunqing protecting him, Lin Lan would probably have long been tormented to death already.

Seeing Wen Jingxuan glaring, Han Qianyun laughed instead and said, “Little slut, you’re really a beauty. No wonder Qin Shun is so tempted by you. The first condition he stated was you! If not for Qin Shun, I’d also want you right now!”

Wen Jingxuan ignored him. Getting to her feet, she silently kowtowed thrice in the direction of the Land of Exile’s transmission array.

Although Ye Yuan was universally condemned right now, in Wen Jingxuan’s heart, Ye Yuan was her savior.

Furthermore, the Alchemy Dao technique that Ye Yuan imparted her let her alchemy path strength increase greatly.

She came today to bid farewell to Ye Yuan.

She was powerless to resist the sect’s decision.

Wiping away her tears, Wen Jingxuan turned around and was about to leave.

But Han Qianyun was unrelenting and said in a cold voice, “Little slut, do you really think that I can’t do anything to you?”

As he said, he was about to make a move again.

“Master!”

But right at this time, Wen Jingxuan’s entire body trembled, looking in the direction of the transmission array with a look of disbelief.

A figure was currently walking over from there!

But very soon, the shock turned into a pleasant surprise!

Han Qianyun had his back towards the transmission array and could not help laughing as he said, “Little slut, have you gotten hysteria? Do you think that by bringing out that rubbish master of yours, I won’t dare to touch you?”

“Just you try touching her!” Right at this time, a voice came over from behind.

Han Qianyun’s expression changed wildly, and he turned around to look. Ye Yuan was currently looking at him not far away with a gloomy expression on his face.

Ye Yuan already saw the distinct slap print on Wen Jingxuan’s face!

Han Qianyun had an expression like he had seen a ghost as he cried out in surprise, “Y-Y-You actually came out of the Land of Exile? This … How is this possible?”

Ye Yuan ignored him and looked towards Wen Jingxuan and said, “Was it him who did it?”

Wen Jingxuan nodded her head. Ignoring the fiery burn on her face, she said with a look of pleasant surprise, “Master, it’s good that you came back! It’s great that you came back!”

As she said, her eyes were already holding tears.

These few years had seriously been too horrible.

Han Qianyun’s eyes turned dark and he said with a cold snort, “So what if you came out??Humph!?Just nice! I’ll take you down and detain you to go and ask Sect Master for punishment!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a frown, “Looks like I stepped a little light on your face!”

Han Qianyun’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan! It was still fine if you didn’t mention this! Mentioning this matter, let’s settle the old scores and new!”

Ye Yuan said coolly,?“Oh??Is that so? Could it be that you’re not afraid that I’ll trample on your face again? This time, I’ll have to trample harder to make you remember it!”

Han Qianyun said disdainfully, “This time, I’m prepared. Just the likes of you also want to paralyze me?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a faint smile, “Is that so? Seems like … you’re already poisoned!”

Han Qianyun’s expression changed wildly. Suddenly, he felt a paralysis all over from head to toe.

Then he experienced a spasm …
