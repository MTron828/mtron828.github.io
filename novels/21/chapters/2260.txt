Chapter 2264: Secret of the Divine Race

“Someone like you is too dangerous! Looks like I shouldn’t have thought about soliciting you!”

Rong Xiyue’s face was full of bitter smiles. Her estimation of Ye Yuan was already as high as possible.

One could say that even a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse would find it hard to escape her control too.

But who could have thought that a measly Empyrean defeated four great Heavenly Emperors in an instant, and took her prisoner?

“Too late! Bring me to go find Ning Tianping!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Rong Xiyue shook her head and said, “I’ve already imprisoned him in the clan. You can detain me here and have Uncle Song bring him here!”

He wanted to use Ning Tianping to blackmail Ye Yuan, and then to render him for her use.

Therefore, she had the idea of imprisoning Ning Tianping long-term and sent him to the clan.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “No need. I’ll go together with you all!”

Rong Xiyue’s gaze turned sharp and she said in a cold voice, “Impossible! My Hidden Lineage has been living in seclusion for as long as a trillion years. No outsider has ever gone in before. If you go, I’ll be the Hidden Lineage’s sinner!”

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “There’s always an exception. Since your Hidden Lineage has already come out of seclusion, how long more can you remain hidden? At this point, going or not isn’t up to you anymore.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan tapped on Rong Xiyue’s back, the latter involuntarily opened her mouth and Ye Yuan directly threw a medicinal pill in.

“You!” Rong Xiyue looked at Ye Yuan with a look of shock and anger.

“This medicinal pill is called Adversity Lifechasing Pill. It is a poison that I specially refined. This poison is akin to bone-festering maggots. It will burrow into every inch of your flesh after entering the body, unable to be purged at all. Furthermore, after your body is completely necrotic, it will even take effect on your divine soul, making your soul disintegrate, never to reincarnate for all of eternity. You should know my Alchemy Dao strength. If you don’t believe me, you can give it a try,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Making Rong Xiyue swallow the poison, Ye Yuan did not care about her anymore.

Her life and death was already in his control.

Rong Xiyue smiled coldly and said, “You think that I’ll be threatened by you? Even if I die, I also won’t bring you to the clan!”

Ye Yuan stared at Rong Xiyue, looking until the latter felt her hair stand on end.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “Looks like you still haven’t given up! Your divine race only has one Divine Son and one Divine Daughter for every lineage. They are all existences that will become Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm and above in the future. Your divine race, you are few in population to begin with. Even though you’ve recuperated and built up energy for many years, it’s probably less than one-ten-thousandth of the human race too, right? I wonder how great an impact a Divine Daughter dying will have on your Hidden Lineage?”

If there was no battle with Nineorigin, Ye Yuan also would not know so many things about the divine race.

Divine Sons and Divine Daughters were extremely hard to come by, they could be said to be the lineage’s future.

Some inklings of this could be seen from Nineorigin’s attitude toward Yue Mengli.

Therefore, Ye Yuan was certain that the Hidden Lineage definitely would not sit idly by and watch Rong Xiyue die.

Sure enough, Rong Xiyue’s expression turned stiff, and she was immediately like a ball that deflated.

“Alright, you win!”

Ye Yuan said, “I also want another person! Li Zhaoqing should be a member of the Deathsoul Gate, right?”

This Skyfame Great Imperial Capital already became the headquarters of the Deathsoul Gate. Very clearly, Li Zhaoqing was a member of the Deathsoul Gate.

In fact, Ye Yuan suspected that Mo Lifei and Li Zhaoqing’s grudge back then was sowed when the Deathsoul Gate’s moved out back then.

Mo Lifei died, his Dao dissipating, leaving only a wisp of remnant soul and escaping.

Rong Xiyue nodded and said, “Uncle Song, you take care of this matter.”

Uncle Song was helpless and could only comply.

... ...

Middle Realm, Windrise Great Imperial Capital.

This was a great imperial capital under Heavenly Emperor Ziyun’s command, a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor. It was incomparably flourishing.

Ye Yuan followed Rong Xiyue and arrived at the busiest inn in Windrise Great Imperial Capital, arriving at the best room.

Rong Xiyue took out a jade ornament and pushed the door and entered.

Ye Yuan felt himself pass through a thin membrane, and it was another world in front of him.

This scene made Ye Yuan clicked his tongue in wonder.

“Capable people hope to rely on the surrounding environment to forget about worldly affairs, well-deserving of being the Hidden Lineage; indeed have a knack.” Ye Yuan marveled with admiration.

With his spatial law and Formation Dao attainments, he did not even discover that a small world was hidden behind this door. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Most likely, it was even less likely for the Heavenspan World’s major powers to know that the powerful divine race was hidden right under their eyelids.

Rong Xiyue shot him a glare and said in a chilly voice, “For a trillion years, you’re the first human to enter this place! But you don’t be happy too early as well, the small world’s entrance changes frequently. Since you entered, this entrance won’t open anymore in the future.”

“Your divine race is so powerful. Why would there be a Hidden Lineage like you all?” Ye Yuan suddenly asked.

“Although the divine race is powerful, propagation is too difficult! Many powerhouses completely don’t have progenies after living for a trillion years. In order to maintain the propagation of the race, an ancestor of our divine race proposed to start another lineage outside of the eight lineages, which is the Hidden Lineage. The significance of our Hidden Lineage’s existence is for the sake of the propagation of the race,” Rong Xiyue did not conceal it either as she said.

But Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he asked, “Propagation? Isn’t it very difficult for your divine race to propagate? Could it be that starting an independent lineage can multiply?”

Rong Xiyue gave Ye Yuan a glance and said, “Our divine race is a race that’s blessed by heaven. Apart from our own propagation, there’s still a portion that comes from the Heavenspan World’s various races. Human race, demon race, fiend race, and other races all have an extremely small chance of giving birth to a divine race member. It’s just that this chance is far too low. Some people won’t even awaken all their life! Our Hidden Lineage’s mission is to find these people and make them awaken, obtaining Heavenly Dao’s recognition! Back then, when you returned to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, my divine race bloodline had just awakened not long and was chosen to be the Hidden Lineage’s Divine Daughter, that’s why my strength would advance by leaps and bounds.”

Hearing what Rong Xiyue said, Ye Yuan’s expression changed wildly, monstrous waves surging in his heart.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Rong Xiyue was very surprised too.

In her impression, Ye Yuan was always calm and composed.

Even when facing the besieging of four great Heavenly Emperors, his expression did not change too.

What was with this now?

“How can it be? How can it be?” Ye Yuan muttered to himself, battered out of his senses.

“What’s wrong with you?” Rong Xiyue asked curiously.

Ye Yuan trembled all over. Grabbing hold of Rong Xiyue, he asked fiercely, “Could it be that divine race powerhouses will also be born in small worlds?”

Rong Xiyue nodded and said, “That’s of course! Although this chance is extremely, extremely low, in a trillion small worlds, the living things can’t even be calculated in quadrillions. Such a large cardinal number, there will naturally be countless divine race powerhouses born every day. It’s just that in small worlds, the lifespan of martial artists is too short. And our divine race’s numbers are scarce, our energy limited, and are simply unable to attend to it. Otherwise, how can our divine race’s status be what the human race can shake?”

Crack! Crack!

Ye Yuan’s finger joints clenched until they creaked, his entire body trembling.

He had always been curious; why Nineorigin would settle on Yue Mengli and choose her as Divine Daughter?

It turned out that Li-er was actually really a member of the divine race!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan felt lost, his entire person like it was drained empty.
