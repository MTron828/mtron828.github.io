Chapter 1676 Slapping Faces When Hitting People

“Don’t look anymore. You don’t think that he can really come out, right?”

At a summit of ten miles, Leng Qiuling was somewhat absent-minded. This one month’s time, she was unable to sit quietly and meditate, looking over in the direction of the fog realm from time to time.

When Zhuo Han saw this, his jealousy could not resist bursting out, speaking sarcastically.

Leng Qiuling gave him a glance indifferently and said coolly, “Maybe he can really come out?”

Zhuo Han laughed in spite of himself and said, “I know what you’re thinking, but there’s a saying called can be done once, twice, but not thrice! Does he really think that he’s something? An Origin Deity Realm barging into the fog realm, this is purely courting death!”

Leng Qiuling opened her mouth but did not speak.

What Zhuo Han said was reasonable. Even though she knew that Ye Yuan was very mysterious and had a lot of means.

But this fog realm clearly already surpassed the normal scope. No matter how immensely formidable one’s means were, it was also impossible to come out from inside.

Leng Qiuling also did not know why she would be like this. Perhaps it was that stepping up for her without the slightest hesitation.

Different from other people’s deliberate striking up a conversation with her, Ye Yuan was purely just helping her out.

Leng Qiuling could tell that when she took out the jade sword, Ye Yuan hesitated for that split second.

Clearly, he did not want to take it.

Zhuo Han gave Leng Qiuling a glance and said, “Junior Sister Leng, I admit that this kid has some capabilities, but people like him will screw themselves to death sooner or later. This kind of guy isn’t worth you recalling with nostalgia at all.”

Right at this time, a nonchalant voice sounded out, drawing everyone’s gaze, “Oh? So a moron like you is worth recalling with nostalgia?”

It was only to see Ye Yuan slowly walk out of the fog with a playful smile on his face.

Ye Yuan’s sudden appearance immediately caused an uproar.

“I-Is my eyesight failing? He really came out alive of the fog realm?”

“Hang on! His aura seems to be different! It’s no longer Origin Deity Realm anymore!”

“It really is! His aura is much more powerful, but ... I can’t quite see through him!”

“What in the world did he experience inside the fog realm? Could it be that inside the realm fog, there’s some fortuitous encounter?”

...

Everyone had disbelieving looks. For an Origin Deity Realm to be able to enter the Heavenspan Mountain, fine. An Origin Deity Realm being able to walk to the summit of ten miles could also be understood.

But, an Origin Deity Realm entering the realm fog and still being able to come out, what the hell was this?

Could it be that this guy was unkillable?

“Y-Y-You ... How did you come out? Impossible! Even Celestial Deity powerhouses can’t come out of there, so how can you possibly come out?”

When Zhuo Han saw Ye Yuan, he had an expression like he had seen a ghost, stammering when speaking.

“How did I come out? Naturally, it’s walked out!” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Zhuo Han had shock written all over his face. Why was this guy’s life so tenacious?

The so-called forbidden land, he walked across it as easily as flat ground.

There was actually such a freakish person in this world?

Not far away, Leng Qiuling looked at Ye Yuan, pleasantly surprised, but also shocked.

She did not expect that Ye Yuan actually really came out of the fog realm.

This man was truly an enigmatic existence!

This one month’s time, what on earth did he experience inside?

Ye Yuan slowly walked over toward Zhuo Han and said with a grin, “Still remember what I said before I left?”

Even though Ye Yuan’s aura skyrocketed significantly, with his ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord strength, he naturally would not be scared of Ye Yuan.

Recalling the words before Ye Yuan left, he smiled coldly and said, “This place is the Heavenspan Mountain. Even if I don’t dare to attack you, could it be that you dare to make a move on me?”

Ye Yuan chuckled as he looked at Zhuo Han and said, “Then ... Let’s give it a try?”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan suddenly slammed a fist out, directly striking Zhuo Han’s face.

Zhuo Han completely did not expect that Ye Yuan actually dared to really attack.

Caught off-guard, he was sent flying by one punch.

A person must not hit the face when hitting people. But this punch of Ye Yuan’s aimed for the face, hitting until his face was full of blood.

Zhuo Han staggered to his feet, his entire person dazed and confused, unable to even differentiate the direction. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“S-So strong! A casual punch actually breached Zhuo Han’s divine essence protection!” Leng Qiuling said with a face full of shock.

Ye Yuan himself also looked at his fist, pleasant surprise all over his face.

The power of this punch somewhat exceeded his imagination.

This punch earlier, he did not employ the power of the fleshy body. It completely relied on the power of divine essence.

He discovered that his divine essence seemed to be totally different from before.

Even though his punch did not have world power, he could sense that there was another kind of power contained inside, enhancing the power of his moves!

Ye Yuan did not know what this power was called. But he was certain that it was absolutely not weaker than world power.

No, wait, it should be above the standard rather than below it!

Zhuo Han shook his head hard before barely managing to come back to his senses.

He looked at Ye Yuan and burned with rage.

“You ... You actually really dared to make a move! I ... I’m going to kill you!”

Zhuo Han being so old, it was still his first time being so disgraced, to actually get hit by a brat who just broke through to the Divine Lord Realm!

He currently already lost his head in fury and completely forgotten that he was at the Heavenspan Mountain.

The aura of ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord suddenly released. That terrifying divine essence undulation gave people a feeling of palpitation.

This Zhuo Han’s strength indeed was not just for show.

Ye Yuan looked at Zhuo Han with a smile that was not a smile, seemingly not worried at all.

Suddenly, a terrifying aura came from above the sky.

Dark clouds virtually formed in an instant.

The terrifying aura instantly overshadowed Zhuo Han’s aura.

Zhuo Han suddenly shuddered, a scent of death instantly clutched his throat, making him unable to breathe.

Without thinking, Zhuo Han dismissed his divine essence and recovered to his normal state.

Only then did the dark clouds in the sky calm it’s angry and dissipate away.

Even though the dark clouds dissipated, Zhuo Han’s back was already drenched in sweat.

Only now did he abruptly and completely come to his senses, this was on the Heavenspan Mountain.

As long as someone dared to make a move, it would trigger heavenly punishment!

Fortunately, he did not attack just now. Otherwise, he would have already turned to ashes now.

Suddenly, his entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

Why was this guy fine?

Not just him, everyone used a horrified expression to look at Ye Yuan.

Although Ye Yuan’s momentum was far from Zhuo Han’s, he had indeed employed divine essence and the power of laws.

Why didn’t heavenly punishment descend?

“Weren’t you going to kill me? I’m standing right here, bring it on!” Ye Yuan looked at Zhuo Han with a smile that was not a smile and said.

Zhuo Han’s expression was incomparably ugly. Currently, in his eyes, Ye Yuan was an out-and-out monster.

“If you’re not coming over, then I’m going over! That punch earlier wasn’t done to my satisfaction yet!”

Ye Yuan slowly pressed in on Zhuo Han. Zhuo Han was really frightened this time. He repeatedly backed away, expression panicky as he said, “D-Don’t come over! You don’t come over! Why, why doesn’t it bring on heavenly punishment when you attack?!”

Rumble!

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to explain to him at all. His figure suddenly vanished from where he was standing, and then he dealt another punch at Zhuo Han’s face!
