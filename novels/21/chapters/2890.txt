Chapter 2896 Revealing Identity, All Shocked!

All of a sudden, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body changed greatly!

That monstrous bloody aura actually suddenly became a human’s aura.

And his appearance also underwent an upheaval change.

Everyone was immediately stunned.

What was this playing at?

Especially the blood race powerhouses, each and every one was shocked until their eyeballs popped out.

“This … What’s going on?”

“Blood Divine Son His Highness … is a human?”

“I … Are my eyes failing me?”

“Really freaking seeing ghosts!”

……

This scene was seriously too shocking. No matter who it was, nobody expected that such a dramatic scene would occur.

Our king’s successor, the new generation king, was actually a human?

Was there a mistake?

Over there, when Bloodpromise, who was currently fighting fiercely with Feng Xiaotian, saw this bizarre scene, he nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

However, Feng Xiaotian was long prepared, seizing this gap and destroying half of Bloodpromise’s body with one move.

Succeeding with one move, Feng Xiaotian was not in a hurry to chase down anymore, but smiled and said, “I didn’t expect that your blood race’s Blood Divine Son is actually of our human race! Hahaha …”

This sudden change was seriously too explosive!

Bloodpromise had just regenerated his body and directly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

This was too demoralizing!

The battle had not been fought yet, and they already lost tens of thousands of lives.

In the end, their command-in-chief was actually the enemy!

Blood Divine Son, how transcendent was that status, how noble was the identity?

In the blood race, he was practically below one person and above everyone else!

Even Hegemon Realms did not dare to easily offend him as well.

But such a transcendent existence was actually given to a human.

This was truly a huge irony!

Bloodpromise’s two eyes were virtually spewing fire. He stared fixedly at Ye Yuan and said angrily, “Bloodazure, who on earth are

you?”

His words asked the question that everyone had.

Who on earth was he?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Looks like your memory isn’t very good. The last time, didn’t you lose an army of 100 thousand at my hands?”

Bloodpromise’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in alarm, “You … You’re Ye Yuan! This … How is this possible!”

It was naturally not that he had a bad memory. It was just that in the previous great battle, Ye Yuan was merely an insignificant minor character.

How could he, an Emperor Sakra Heaven, possibly know Ye Yuan?

It was also later on, after all sorts of intel were transmitted back, Bloodpromise knew that he was actually defeated at the hands of a Saint Sovereign Heaven brat.

However, how long had it been?

How did Ye Yuan become the blood race’s Blood Divine Son with a sway of his body?

This was too horrifying!

Yes, beyond the shock, Bloodpromise had a hair-raising feeling. A human changed his appearance and entered the blood race.

He became the head of the hundred sons, entered the Blood God Temple, and even obtained the mother stone’s recognition in the end, becoming the Blood Divine Son!

This series of events was simply a mythological story.

It sounded fantastical, but it genuinely happened!

He was actually pointed in the face by a human Saint Sovereign Heaven and scolded trash?

An ant-like thing was actually ordering him about?

Bloodpromise really felt like he had incredibly bad luck at this time!

“N-No wonder he slaughtered his peers crazily in the hundred sons battle!” Bloodage thought of something too, his pupils constricting.

Even he nearly died at Ye Yuan’s hands too.

Crazy!

Completely insane!

From the start of the hundred sons battle under now, how many blood race elites died under his hands?

Tens of thousands! Adding in today’s 50 thousand people, Ye Yuan had already killed close to 100 thousand blood race Saint Sovereign Heavens!

Among them, there were many who were peerless geniuses, existence who might be able to become Hegemons in the future!

Suddenly, Bloodpromise felt like his heart was dripping blood.

This was really a freaking stroke of marvel!

The Heaven One Alliance side was struck senseless too.

The blood race’s Blood Divine Son was actually Ye Yuan?

What the hell?!

Just now, I was still scolding this guy for being a moron, unleashing careless moves!

The attacking points that he chose were all areas where the grand array was the strongest.

Could it be that the Blood Divine Son was an idiot?

Today, the truth came to light!

Hahaha … Too satisfying!

Slaughtered 50 thousand bloodkins without losing a single troop! Among them was also someone like the number one True Sovereign, Xue Yi!

Too awesome!

This was really heaven helping our Heaven One Alliance.

At the moment of desperation, such an amazing figure actually appeared.

“Big Brother Yuan is mighty! You’re my idol!”

“Too satisfying! Previously, you scammed 100 thousand bloodkins to death. Now, you scammed another 50 thousand elites to death! Impressive!”

“Big Brother Yuan, I love you too much!”

The Heaven One generals and soldiers were already agitated until they were rambling.

The impact that Ye Yuan gave everyone by revealing his identity was seriously too strong.

This resulted in the entire battle falling into a brief respite.

Bloodpromise’s pair of eyes already wanted to drip blood. He bellowed: “Kill! Everyone, give up on attacking the city and kill this bastard for me!”

This roar reverberated throughout the sky, shocking until everyone’s eardrums hurt slightly.

It could be seen how enraged the current Bloodpromise was.

When he became enraged, the blood race army finally reacted.

The 180 thousand strong army was already just left with 130 thousand plus at this time.

But this force was enough to annihilate Ye Yuan ten thousand times over!

Feng Xiaotian’s expression changed too, instinctively wanting to go over.

But, before he moved, Bloodpromise brought a group of Emperor Realms and charged over.

“Want to save him? No chance! Since he wants to be a hero, then he should have thought of what the consequences would be!” Bloodpromise’s words carried thick cruelty.

Feng Xiaotian was tied down by Bloodpromise and the rest and could not get away at all.

And the faces of the Heaven One army’s soldiers and generals also changed drastically.

Just now, they only cared about being excited and completely forgot that Ye Yuan was still in the enemy camp!

There was an army of more than 100 thousand around him!

But they could not move!

They only had over ten thousand people. Once they went out of the city, without the protection of the grand array, they would be eaten up by this army of more than 100 thousand until not even dregs remained.

Right at this time, Feng Xiaotian gave an angry roar, “Whole army, move out of the city! Save Ye Yuan at all costs!”

This was gambling the fate of the entire city!

In Feng Xiaotian’s view, even if South Qi Giant City fell, it was not as important as one Ye Yuan too!

This series of supernatural-like manipulation truly shocked all the heavens!

Most likely, another Ye Yuan could not be found in the 33 Heavens.

This was a legendary-like figure. He absolutely could not let him die!

Therefore, he gave this order without the slightest hesitation.

His order was carried out at once.

The commander of the army had already led the army to prepare to go out of the city.

When Bloodpromise saw this scene, he could not help being wildly elated in his heart. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

This was precisely the scene that he wanted to see!

So what if one Ye Yuan scammed tens of thousands of people to death?

As long as South Qi Giant City was breached, he would be the blood race’s great meritorious official!

At that time, he would be able to enter the void and gain enlightenment on the Chaos Bloodstone.

Hegemon Realm was near at hand!

When Ye Yuan heard this order, he felt a warmth in his heart too.

However, he shouted coldly, “All stop for me! Leave the remaining over 100 thousand people to me!”

Over 100 thousand bloodkin army, each person’s face revealed an extremely odd look.

This guy did not go crazy, right?
