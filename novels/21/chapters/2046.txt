Chapter 2050: Brink of Death

Ye Yuan felt like his divine soul became a droplet of water, merging into his Sea of Law.

Inside the vast ocean, Ye Yuan felt that he was extremely tiny.

But merging inside, he also felt that he looked down upon the world.

The sight around the plaza, he felt like he could actually have a commanding view of it, like a sovereign that controlled this world.

Even if it was ants crawling on the ground, insects swimming in the water, Ye Yuan could also see their every move and action distinctly.

This kind of feeling was incomparably magical.

“This ... Could this be Ancestor Realm? No, wait! Although Ancestor Realm is miraculous, it’s absolutely impossible to reach this kind of extent.”

Ye Yuan liked this current state a lot.

Inside the Sea of Law, Empyrean Pilljade, Empyrean Flutterfeather, Empyrean Blazing Sun, and the rest were all comprehending laws.

Ye Yuan could even see the current situation of the laws around him.

Among these people, the laws flowed the fastest around Empyrean Flutterfeather. Clearly, his comprehension ability was the highest among these people.

The next was Empyrean Pilljade.

What Ye Yuan did not expect was that the one who was second only to these two people was actually Empyrean Lumen.

“Looks like Empyrean Lumen’s age isn’t that old among these grandmasters and still has potential. With his talent, with this experience of the Sea of Law, he’ll probably be able to break through to the Ancestor Realm in the future. It’s just ... a shame about Empyrean Chaoyuan. If he were still here, he’d probably be able to breakthrough on the spot.”

But Ye Yuan discovered that no matter how he spied on them, they were unable to detect it.

This kind of state was absolutely not what Ancestor Realm could reach.

One had to know, these were all late-stage Empyrean Realm mighty experts. Furthermore, their divine souls were incomparably powerful. Even a trace of the rustling of leaves in the wind could not hide from their eyes and ears.

“Could it be that ... I’m currently spying on them through this Sea of Law? Which is also to say that I’m this area’s Heavenly Dao? The chance is hard to come by! I have to experience it carefully.”

Ye Yuan was amazed in his heart! It was as if he had fused into one body with Heavenly Dao laws.

He was Heavenly Dao, and Heavenly Dao was him, Ye Yuan! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ye Yuan recollected his thoughts and started comprehending Heavenly Dao.

Time flew by quickly. In a twinkle, a month went by.

The group of Empyreans opened both eyes in succession, withdrawing from a meditative state, regretful looks on their faces.

With this comprehension, they each gleaned considerable benefits.

But this kind of comprehension was limited in the end. Their realm was not there yet, indulging in the Sea of Law for a long time would make them blow up and die.

No matter how strong Empyreans were, they were also not stronger than Heavenly Dao.

This level of Sea of Law was like an inexhaustible nourishing liquid.

Drinking a bit could make people full.

But drinking too much, one would probably be excessively nourished by it and even potentially stuffed themselves to death.

But these powers of laws were already sufficient for them to digest for a very long time.

As for those alchemists that listened attentively to the sermon, they had long already withdrawn respectively.

Their strength was not able to withstand such a vast Sea of Law at all.

“I ddn’t expect that this Sea of Law actually lasted for more than a month, truly seldom-seen! Mn? Ye Yuan is still comprehending?” Empyrean Pilljade said with a frown.

Logically speaking, Ye Yuan’s realm was inferior to his and should have long withdrawn.

Flutterfeather also had a look of surprise and said in a solemn voice, “This guy, doesn’t he understand the logic of biting off more than one can chew?”

The group of Empyrean was also greatly surprised. They all, these Empyreans, had already withdrawn and Ye Yuan was actually still indulging inside.

“Brother Flutterfeather, Ye Yuan’s state seems to be somewhat amiss!” Empyrean Purplewing warned.

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s face changed. Looking over carefully, he discovered that Ye Yuan’s condition indeed seemed to be not quite right.

The current Ye Yuan was seemingly like an empty husk, his body without any lease of life.

“No way! I can’t let him continue like this! I have to wake him up!”

Finished talking, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s figure moved and entered the Sea of Law once more, attempting to wake Ye Yuan up.

But right at this time, a bolt of lightning the size of a bowl suddenly fell from above the nine heavens without the slightest signs.

Crack, crack ... boom!

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s face changed drastically, a feeling of danger immediately welling up in his heart.

How could he dare to hesitate at all? His figure retreated explosively at once.

Right at that instant, his figure withdrew from the Sea of Law, and the lightning suddenly dissipated. It was as if it had never appeared before.

Came swiftly, departure was quick too.

But Empyrean Flutterfeather’s back was already drenched in sweat.

“This ... Just what’s going on here?” Empyrean Purplewing said with surprise.

“Looks like the Sea of Law can’t be entered. We can only pray that Ye Yuan will be safe.” Empyrean Flutterfeather shook his head and said with a sigh.

That lightning earlier was too terrifying. It was as if it was the might of heaven and earth.

If he was any slower, he would likely have already turned to ashes.

But some Empyreans that found Ye Yuan displeasing to the eyes were secretly rejoicing in their hearts currently.

Especially Empyrean Proudcloud, the joy on his face practically could not be concealed.

“Heh, the evil that people bring on themselves is the hardest to bear! This punk was self-assured that his talent is exceedingly high and really thought that this Sea of Law is his home’s backyard, staying as long as he wanted to?” Empyrean Proudcloud said with a cold smile.

Empyrean Pilljade was also secretly delighted in his heart. But he did not show it and just said coolly, “All disperse.”

Time slowly trickled by, the group of Empyreans naturally would not idle away here too, each seeking place and going into closed-seclusion.

At this time, the Cloudpill Summit already completely ended. But there were still many people gathered around Tianyue Plaza, looking at that figure on the high platform with concerned looks.

Ye Yuan’s sermon benefited everyone. There were always some people who felt grateful. Although they could not do anything, they could still be concerned about Ye Yuan at one side.

One day, two days.

One month, two months.

One year, two years ...

In a blink, more than two years already passed. Ye Yuan sat withered on the platform just like that, with no signs of life on his body at all.

Many people all let out deep sighs, turned around, and left.

There were already not many people in Tianyue Plaza.

“Sigh, how can this be? Grandmaster Ye is so remarkably talented. Why would he die here?”

“We received Grandmaster Ye’s kindness, but I didn’t expect that ... he died here!”

Everyone shook their heads and sighed. Suddenly, a voice said with a cold snort, “Shut up! Grandmaster Ye won’t die! He must be comprehending the Heavenly Dao! There will come one day where he’ll wake up!”

By the side, Song Zichun shook his head and said with a sigh, “Forget it, Lin Tong. Come on, it’s already been two years! Didn’t you see that those Seven-star Alchemy Gods could only stay for more than a month in the Sea of Law too?”

Lin Tong smiled coldly and said, “Heh, so what? Grandmaster Ye was able to trigger the Sea of Law to descend. So how can he possibly die here? Didn’t you see that the Sea of Law is still there and didn’t dissipate? Song Zichun, if you want to go, leave. I must wait for Grandmaster Ye to wake up! Grandmaster Ye gave me a new life; not seeing him wake up, I’ll find it hard to set my mind at ease!”

Originally, Song Zichun was Ye Yuan’s most staunch supporter.

But along with the time getting longer and longer, Ye Yuan’s aura got weaker and weaker. Even he had no confidence anymore as well.

Rather, it was Lin Tong who was extremely stubborn, insisting firmly that Ye Yuan did not die and must wait for him to wake up.

Song Zichun let out a sigh, turned around, and left.

However, things did not develop according to Lin Tong’s idea.

This wait of his was ten years. But Ye Yuan did not show any signs of waking up.
