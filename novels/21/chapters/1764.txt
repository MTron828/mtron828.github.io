Chapter 1768 Tianlu Pavilion“s Fifth Level!

“In short, this matter is settled. If someone reveals half a word to the outside world, kill without mercy!”

Inside Tianlu Pavilion, Xiu seethed with killing intent.

Opposite him, Di Qiu was full of doubts and puzzlement.

He completely did not expect that what he got was actually such an order.

Cracking ‘Ask Not’ was a grand event of the demon race. Virtually everyone knew about it.

But why did everything change when it reached Ye Yuan here?

“Your Excellency, can I ask why?”

Xiu smiled bitterly and said, “How can Lord Sacred Ancestor’s thoughts be what you and I can conjecture about? We only need to obey orders.”

Di Qiu was helpless and said with a nod, “Yes, Di Qiu obeys the command!”

After Di Qiu left, Xiu held a white light ball in his palm, his expression complicated.

It was only to see him lightly pressed his palm, and then a ball of light merged into space.

Before long, Ye Yuan’s figure appeared in Tianlu Pavilion.

“Senior, you’re looking for me?” Ye Yuan bowed and said.

Xiu nodded and said, “These few days, you’ve been in closed-seclusion all along. How’s the harvest?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Honestly speaking, the harvest ... isn’t big.”

When Xiu heard that, he had a strange look on his face.

No matter who it was, as long as they did not die in ‘Ask Not’, they would have some harvest.

Some people after coming out, their Alchemy Dao strength would advance by leaps and bounds, even reigning supreme in a city.

This depended on talent.

All Tyrant Origin Imperial City’s elders had basically cleared ‘Ask Not.’

One had to know, inside ‘Ask Not’ contained the Dao of the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest, these two Heavenspan World’s apex Alchemy Dao experts!

But Ye Yuan actually said that there was not much gain.

This was too depressing!

Ye Yuan said that he did not have harvests was naturally not because his comprehension ability was poor, but that his strength was too strong.

The Dao contained in ‘Ask Not’ could not give Ye Yuan much comprehension at all.

But these few years, Ye Yuan still learned quite a bit of things from ‘Ask Not.’

After all, those two were the Heavenspan World’s top powerhouses.

“Senior Xiu, don’t use this kind of eyes to look at me. You should be able to tell that ‘Ask Not’s effect on me isn’t big,” Ye Yuan saw Xiu’s look and explained with a smile.

For such a long time, Ye Yuan more or less had some understanding of Xiu’s Alchemy Dao strength.

Even though he had never exhibited it in front of him before, just based on some of his views, it was far from what those elders could compare to.

He should be able to tell that his strength already far surpassed the level of ‘Ask Not’.

Xiu heaved a sigh and said, “Knowing is knowing, but these words still make this old man have an impulse to beat people.”

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “Senior didn’t find me in order to beat me up, right?”

Xiu smiled and said, “You passed ‘Ask Not’s test, in the future, all of this Tianlu Pavilion’s floors will be opened to you at any time. Especially the fifth level, I believe that there are things that interest you!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, his eyes could not help lighting up and he said in pleasant surprise, “Are Senior’s words true?”

In half a year’s time, Ye Yuan had always remained on the first three floors. The books here were already pretty much digested by him.

Even the third floor was Xiu letting him enter through the back door.

That place was a place that only elders could enter.

As for the fourth floor, even if Ye Yuan and Xiu’s relationship was very good, he was not willing to open this back door either.

He did not expect that clearing ‘Ask Not’ actually still had this kind of benefit.

Even Xiu was not willing to let him enter. This showed that the books on the fourth floor and above were definitely all extremely precious stuff.

Such things, probably only the hall master, a person of this level, could go in.

Ye Yuan did not even know that inside this Tianlu Pavilion still had a fifth floor!

Now, not only could Ye Yuan enter the fourth level, he could even enter the fifth level that had never been heard of. How could this not surprise him?

Xiu smiled and said, “Why would I lie to you? Go on!”

Ye Yuan did not say a word and went straight up to the fourth floor. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Xiu shook his head and said, “This kid actually kept his mouth shut about the matter of acknowledging a master. In this world, how many people want to acknowledge the Sacred Ancestor as master, but he ... seems to hold it in disdain!”

...

“Cloud Pendant Heavenly Sunbow Pill! This ... Isn’t this the demon race’s Supreme Jade Void Pill?”

“Also, these alchemy techniques are all extremely powerful treasures!”

“And these demonic attraction art methods are truly exquisite!”

...

Ye Yuan lingered on the fourth floor, viewing those classics, gasping in admiration again and again.

Although this fourth floor’s classics were far lacking in quantity than downstairs, they were clearly more than a grade higher than those below.

With Ye Yuan’s eyesight, he could naturally discern that these classics should be the demon race’s most precious batch.

Even though these classics were all used by Divine Dao rank four or five powerhouses, without a doubt, they were extremely precious.

If these classics were in the human race, it would not be easily shown to people at all.

For Ye Yuan to be able to have today’s accomplishments, it was largely due to benefiting from Immortal Grove’s legacy.

Although he had long already surpassed his predecessor, the pill formulas that Immortal Grove left behind, alchemy techniques, etc, the significance to Ye Yuan naturally went without saying.

Clearly, in the demon race, these things were similarly incomparably precious.

Browsing entirely the fourth floor’s classics, Ye Yuan entered the fifth level impatiently.

He very much wanted to look at what kind of things were actually even more precious than the fourth floor’s classics!

The fifth floor’s space was stark empty. Only a white light ball suspended quietly in the air.

Ye Yuan was very curious and pressed his palm on it.

Buzz!

In an instant, countless information entered Ye Yuan’s mind.

“This ... This is the Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s legacy?”

Ye Yuan’s mind was shaken and came to his senses very quickly about what this mass of information was.

“However ... these inheritances don’t seem to have his comprehension toward the Dao. Instead, they are the demon race’s most basic stuff. Could it be ...”

In these legacies, there were medicinal property explanations of countless spirit medicines, detailed interpretation of alchemy techniques, and also the demonic attraction art’s supreme arts.

Even though the content had common aspects with those at downstairs, they were a totally different concept!

These things were a top alchemist’s lifetime comprehension toward the Alchemy Dao!

For an alchemist to want to corroborate the Great Dao, they must walk out a path that belonged to him.

Just like Ye Yuan, even with Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s inheritance, he still walked out an alchemy path belonging to him.

And the Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s inheritance was clearly much higher rank than Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s!

These two were not on the same level at all.

In an instant, Ye Yuan seemingly understood something.

A hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and he said, “What a daring Sacred Ancestor High Priest! He wants to let me grow up and become his opponent, spurring him to break through the shackles from there! Looks like this ‘Ask Not’ isn’t what the world thinks at all! What he’s finding is a person capable of shattering his will, and not a chess piece in his hands! Heh, most likely even the Medicine Ancestor also didn’t expect that the Sacred Ancestor High Priest actually has such boldness, right? Perhaps in the future, he can really become the second Medicine Ancestor, who knows!”
