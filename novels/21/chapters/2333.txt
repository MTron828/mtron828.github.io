Chapter 2337: Nightmare

That was right, these unpredictable children were all astonishingly talented, their law comprehensions extremely strong. They could indeed jump ranks and do battle.

It was just a pity that their strength was still far lacking when compared to same rank divine race powerhouses.

But who was Ye Yuan?

Back then, his realm was not as good as Divine Son Xin’s, but he was able to crush the other party.

Now, his realm could be seen as comparable to a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor. But the thickness of his divine essence was no idea how many times stronger than a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

It was not at all inferior when compared to a Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor as well.

Such strength, even if he did not employ Time Freeze, this kind of heaven-defying divine ability, it would also be too effortless to deal with Yang Ke and company.

Ye Yuan forcefully resisted Yang Ke two people’s attacks. One punch each, in virtually a blink of an eye, he blew the other three Second Firmament Heavenly Emperors up.

Perfect eighth transformation golden body was no joke!

The Heavenspan World’s body-refining powerhouses were countless. But a person who could cultivate the fleshy body to perfect rank eight was one of a kind!

Yang Ke two people did not hurt Ye Yuan but shocked themselves until their vital energy was in upheaval.

This scared them badly enough.

“This is your strength to jump ranks and battle? It looks like the ranks that you’re jumping isn’t enough!” Ye Yuan said with rather waned interest.

He still thought how formidable these unpredictable sons were. In the end, they were weak to the max.

Of course, Ye Yuan could feel that Yang Ke their strength was indeed very strong.

With their strength, they could even rival Fourth Firmament Heavenly Emperors.

But so what?

Their so-called jumping ranks were only targeted at the most ordinary Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, that was all.

Those who have fought with Ye Yuan before, which one was not a prodigy among geniuses?

Yang Ke’s expression was incomparably ugly. They were lecturing Ye Yuan earlier, making him tuck his tail between his legs and behave.

Now, their face was really slapped burning hot. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Run!”

Yang Ke saw that the situation was bad and turned tail and ran.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s too late!”

It was only to see him punching a fist out, carrying a series of dragon roars, and tearing through the air.

True Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand!

Boom!

Yang Ke two people felt their hearts drop and turned around to resist it.

But the power of this punch already exceeded their limits.

After resisting it slightly, they were directly decimated.

From start to end, it was merely a dozen over breaths of time.

By the side, all the unpredictable children were stunned from watching.

The people who were somewhat looking down on Ye Yuan previously felt their faces were burning currently.

“He wiped out a squad in a few breaths of time by himself! How ... How can he be so strong?”

“Too scary! His fleshy body is actually able to forcefully contend with the attacks of a Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor! Unless ... Unless he’s of the perfect rank eight golden body!”

“Heaven beyond heaven; there’s always someone better ... He’s the heaven beyond heaven. He’s the person who’s always better!”

... ...

Amidst everyone’s shocked gazes, Ye Yuan slowly entered the city.

Encountering a few people who delivered their heads the moment he came in, Ye Yuan was still in quite a good mood.

Annihilating six people, his god of war points already rose to 247.

His ranking also already rose to rank 11,328, rising more than a thousand places at once.

While at this time, Yang Ke and the rest who returned to the rebirth point, all had hard-to-conceal depression on their faces.

They ... were annihilated once more!

Just returned to Cloudaid City, they were actually annihilated once more!

With this, their losses were huge.

Several people’s ranks fell crazily. Especially the few Second Firmament Heavenly Emperors, it was virtually almost falling to their tails.

“Damn it, after I died the last time, I expended a Herculean effort before amassing several hundred god of war points. With this, it’s all gone!” Peng Yang said gloomily.

He felt like there was a resentful lump in his chest, making his chest almost explode.

Imagine that you were climbing a mountain and finally climbed halfway up the mountain.

In the end, your hand slipped and you fell by more than half.

Another slip and you fell to the starting point.

At this time, whose mood could be good?

Yang Ke had a look of lingering fear as he said, “That punk is too strong! I feel like he didn’t take out his true strength at all and easily wiped us out! I reckon that his true strength will likely rank within 8000!”

Everyone’s faces were startled and they said, “It’s impossible, right? Within 8000, that’s middle-stage First Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouses already!”

Yang Ke had a solemn expression as he said, “Disregarding other things, with just his perfect rank eight golden body, there’s absolutely no issue with being ranked in the top 9000! If he’s still concealing strength, he can absolutely be ranked in the top 8000!”

When everyone heard that, they sucked in a breath of cold air.

Someone smiled bitterly and said, “Why are we so unlucky, encountering such a jinx the moment we revived? This guy is simply like a nightmare, I don’t want to remember it anymore!”

Including Yang Ke, everyone had bitter smiles.

It was really a memory that one could not bear to recall!

... ...

“Truly a magical world! The flow of time here is a hundred times slower than the outside world! I entered a year late, but actually, 100 years have already passed in this place! With over 100 years’ time, I’m afraid that a large group of powerhouses has emerged, right?”

Ye Yuan discovered that the Primeval War Realm’s flow of time was very slow. It was only 1% of the outside world!

If he cultivated in here, it was equivalent to cultivating for 100 years in the outside world!

This was simply a cultivation paradise to Ye Yuan.

His eyes suddenly lit up and he said, “If I can comprehend time law and create a space for Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma’s alchemy path powerhouses to gain enlightenment on Dao, their strength will definitely improve by leaps and bounds! It’s just that I don’t know if there’s an opportunity to comprehend time law here or not!”

Presently, the human race’s alchemy path powerhouses were a little useless.

Human leaders like Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets did not care about the alchemy path’s existence at all.

Because they felt that the alchemy path had declined and would not have much effect on the Doomsday Battle.

But if there were several people who could comprehend the power of law and comprehend the true Dao pill, then the alchemy path would regain its glory anew, and make the divine race dread!

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan was rather excited.

But very soon, he became a little dejected again.

Time law was too hard to comprehend. It was even harder than spatial law!

Although he already entered the door, he had not been able to find a way to improve further all the way until now.

“Forget it. Better don’t think too much! Exchanging for some Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures and going out to earn god of war points are more realistic.”

Everyone who entered the Primeval War Realm came in all on their own.

All the treasures on their bodies were unable to be brought in.

Want to use treasures in the Primeval War Realm, one could only make an exchange with god of war points.

There was a Spirit Treasure Hall, Medicinal Pill Hall, and so on and so forth in the city. They could all be exchanged for by using god of war points.

Hence, god of war points was extremely important in the Primeval War Realm.

“Sir, I wonder how I can help you?” Ye Yuan entered the Spirit Treasure Hall and an enchanting woman in red clothes came up to greet him.

“I need a sword!” Ye Yuan said.

The woman in red smiled brightly and said, “Sir, please follow me.”

She led Ye Yuan into a place called Sword Pavilion. There were all kinds of swords laid out inside in a dazzling array.

The woman in red smiled and said, “Sir, there are tens of thousands of swords in all kinds of styles inside the Sword Pavilion. You can choose freely.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and casually circled one round, and could not help drawing a cold breath.

These swords were so expensive!

The roughly 200 god of war points that he had just obtained was barely able to buy 12.

More importantly, there were no Empyrean spirit treasures here!

“That ... Do you guys have Empyrean spirit treasures here?” Ye Yuan asked rather embarrassedly.
