Chapter 2293: Start Your Performance

“He’s the legendary Second Sage? Looks very ordinary!”

“Yeah, he’s so young, how strong can he be?”

“Looks like the name falls short of reality. Second Sage might only be highly talented. That’s why he’s valued by Sacred Ancestor High Priest.”

... ...

Ye Yuan’s fame had long already been resounding like the roar of thunder in the alchemy world.

Everyone’s expectations of him were too high!

As the saying went, to know a man by reputation is not as good as meeting him face to face. The feeling that Ye Yuan’s appearance gave people was that it could not be trusted.

Even a peerless genius like Zhao Zixuan also had more than 100 thousand years spent on cultivating alchemy.

An alchemy genius at Zhao Zixuan’s age, it was originally impossible to acknowledge Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian as master.

These alchemy holy lands have long already had disciples spread like branches and leaves, with students all over the world.

Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian made an exception to take Zhao Zixuan in as a disciple. It could be seen how terrifying his alchemy talent was.

As for the few people by the side, their talent and strength were all not inferior to Zhao Zixuan.

In contrast, Ye Yuan was weak to the max at first glance.

“Heh heh, wonder if Lord Second Sage should give us an explanation or not?” Zhao Zixuan said smugly.

He had reason on his side. Furthermore, his background was deep. So he was not afraid of Ye Yuan finding fault.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard that and said, “So what if my, Ye Yuan’s followers, insulted you? So what if they snatched your spirit medicines? They have this qualification! Are you satisfied with this explanation?”

Arrogant!

Overbearing!

He, Second Sage, did not stoop to play whatever games with you at all!

Zhao Zixuan and the rest were stunned when they heard that. They took the side of reason and could be said to have racked their brains in order to set this up.

But who knew that Ye Yuan did not capitulate at all, not playing cards according to the rules.

Zhao Zixuan sneered and said, “Huhu, if Second Sage really has the strength of Second Sage, there’s naturally no one who dares to refute this! But do you have this strength?”

“Without this strength, you want to use your status to suppress us?”

“I’m very sorry. The few of our identities are not what you can intimidate willy-nilly either!”

The few people all had scornful looks on their faces. A brat still wet behind his ears also dares to put on airs in front of them.

Was Second Sage very impressive?

Going to make you lose all standing and reputation today!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Didn’t they come up with so many tricks in order to force me to take action? As you guys wish!”

Zhao Zixuan and the rest were overjoyed. This punk delivered himself to the doorstep. Then it could not be blamed on them anymore.

The few of them were all major holy lands’ direct lineage disciples, with their statuses being extraordinary.

The title of Second Sage could intimidate others, but it really could not scare them.

“Heh, this is what Second Sage yourself said!” Zhao Zixuan said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Against you, these juniors, originally, this sage was disdainful to take action. But not beating the few of your little fellows into submission, probably can’t avoid there being some people who have devious thoughts! Since that’s the case, I’ll make the few of you the first target.”

Everyone’s faces revealed strange looks.

Juniors?

Little fellows?

This tone behaved like such a senior!

Bearing the title of Second Sage, he did not even know what his surname was anymore?

Zhao Zixuan sneered when he heard that and said, “Is that so? Then today, the few of us will witness Second Sage’s strength!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “My strength? Just the likes of you can’t see it yet. Your family’s ancestor coming out is more like it.”

“Ignorant!”

“Wildly arrogant!”

“Don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!”

... ...

The people were enraged when they heard that. Ye Yuan’s words were putting himself onto the position of the Heavenspan World’s pinnacle-most alchemists.

This guy was also too shameless!

It seemed like after receiving the title of Second Sage, he really became unbelievably inflated.

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Oh, right. If I win, let the two of them go and apologize to them, and then hand the spirit medicine to them! Otherwise, this Ye will go and ask Medicine Ancestor for an explanation!”

Zhao Zixuan had a disdainful look as he said, “Fine. If you win against us, what’s the harm in apologizing? It’s just that I’m afraid that your reputation will be destroyed today!”

“Heh heh, you even want to find the Medicine Ancestor to ask for an explanation. I’m afraid that you won’t have the face to meet him!”

“You’re looking down on the heroes of the world too much! The few of us have followed our masters for many years and already acquired much of their true legacy, just you wait to lose!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ye Yuan did not express any opinion and said coolly, “No need to make it so complicated. You guys set up the question. Each person refine a medicinal pill that they are best at. If I were to lose to any of you, it’s considered my loss!”

Ye Yuan did not take these few guys seriously at all.

Too weak!

It was just that these words sounded too conceited to others.

Every one of them who was present was a rising star of the alchemy world. They were existences that would shock the world in the future.

Nobody dared to deny their talent.

Furthermore, the domain that each of them was adept at was different. Even if it was an ordinary alchemy major power, they also did not dare to say such words.

After all, those major powers were formidable but had their own shortcomings too.

These shortcomings were not considered shortcomings in front of some people. But in front of someone like Zhao Zixuan, it would be magnified infinitely.

When Zhao Zixuan heard that, he smiled coldly and said, “This is what you said!”

Ye Yuan said impatiently, “Start your performance then.”

Bang!

The few people took out medicinal cauldrons from their storage rings and actually started refining pills on the streets.

“That’s ... Xuanyuan Cauldron!”

“There’s also Brutal Wind Cauldron, Cloudmist Cauldron ... My God, these are all renown peak heavenly emperor spirit treasures!”

“These heavenly emperor spirit treasures were medicinal cauldrons that Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian they all used back then before they became famous. I didn’t expect that they were passed to them!”

“With these precious cauldrons, the quality of the medicinal pills will definitely go up another level! Heh heh, I want to see how Second Sage cleans up the mess!”

... ...

These few disciples had clearly obtained their elders’ showing of favor, bestowing upon them precious cauldrons that made a name for themselves back then.

With these precious cauldrons, their strength would be akin to adding wings to a tiger.

At this time, there were already quite a number of people waiting to watch the joke.

Second Sage might be very talented, but he was too haughty, these young masters present were not ordinary people!

Zhao Zixuan and the rest discussed for a bit, the corners of each and every one of their mouths revealed a smug look.

When everyone saw this scene, they palpated with fear and anxiety.

These guys were definitely going to pose difficult problems to Ye Yuan!

“Second Sage, the medicinal pill that I’m refining is the Seven Treasures Blood Congealing Pill. Watch closely!”

Zhao Zixuan gave a cold laugh, sending one spirit medicine after another into the medicinal cauldron.

Another said to Ye Yuan with a cold smile, “Second Sage, what I’m refining is the Nine Apertures Heavenly Dust Pill, watch closely!”

“Second Sage, what I’m refining is the Zheng Yi Imperial Extreme Pill!”

... ...

Zhao Zixuan this side had a total of five people. Each time they reported the name of a medicinal pill, the faces of the people at the sides became a little more shocked.

These medicinal pills were too obscure!

Not only were they obscure, but the refining difficulty was also very high.

Five types of medicinal pills could be said to be five extremes.

It was simply impossible for ordinary alchemists to be adept at these five kinds of medicinal pills at the same time.

Even if Ye Yuan could refine them, it was also impossible for the quality of the medicinal pills to surpass these five people at the same time.

“Heh heh, this is fun now!”

“This is the price of looking down on alchemy holy lands’ direct lineage disciples! The price is losing all standing and reputation!”

“No matter what, Second Sage also won’t dare to accept this kind of challenge, this is equivalent to looking for abuse!”

... ...

Everyone around shook their heads one after another.
