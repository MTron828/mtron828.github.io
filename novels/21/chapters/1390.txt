Chapter 1394 Killing with a Borrowed Knife

Bang!

Little Fatty’s round body flew straight out.

“Ouch, my butt!” Little Fatty wailed miserably.

Toward this poser little fatty, everyone all snickered endlessly.

“Heh, this reckless and blind thing, to actually dare be frivolous toward Senior Apprentice Sister Lin Xiu, his brain is spoiled, right?”

“Senior Apprentice Sister Lin Xiu is the inner-court disciples’ top talent. This little fatty actually had improper thoughts toward her, it’s really a toad lusting after swan meat!”

“Yeah, Senior Apprentice Sister Lin Xiu is a flower in our inner-court, turning her nose up at how many young outstanding talents. How could she take fancy on this ball-like little fatty?”

...

When Jia Chong saw this scene, he sneered coldly in his heart to no end.

“On his deathbed and he’s still in the mood to pick up chicks here. This fool wouldn’t really think that for him to be able to participate in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, it’s because his talent surpasses others, right?”

Jia Chong, as this season’s number two, was naturally selected for the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial too.

Little Fatty rolled and crawled to his feet, running to Lin Xiu’s side again with a waddle, thickened his skin, and said, “A gentleman reasons things out and doesn’t resort to violence. Xiu ... Senior Apprentice Sister, what are you doing here?”

“Dare to talk nonsense again, see if I tear your mouth!” Lin Xiu said coldly.

“Not saying, not saying anymore!” Little Fatty mumbled.

Right at this time, light shone brightly on the altar, spiritual energy surging wildly.

Following that, everyone disappeared.

Passing through a spatial passageway, there was a blur before the group of people’s eyes, arriving at a foreign space.

What entered the eyes were actually a hundred altars.

“Yoo, isn’t this Wu Meng’s Teacher Thundercry? You guys coming this time, which place from the last are you preparing to get?”

The moment they landed, there was an Origin Deity powerhouse by the side who made sarcastic remarks.

This trip, apart from Qin Yuanlong, there was another teacher leading the team. It was precisely the Thundercry who gave Ye Yuan and the rest the entrance examination back then.

Hearing these words, Thundercry’s brows furrowed but unexpectedly did not refute. He just snorted coldly and ignored the other party.

All of Wu Meng’s students, especially the inner-court disciples, were all filled with righteous indignation, wishing to rush over and directly clash together with the other party.

“Senior Apprentice Sister? Who are they? So cocky!” Little Fatty moved close to Lin Xiu’s side and asked curiously.

Lin Xiu’s expression was very ugly as well as she said coldly, “They are Zuo Xiang Capital City’s people. Their overall strength is sufficient to rank in the top ten among these hundred capital cities. Most importantly, the Zuo Xiang Capital City and our Wu Meng Capital City are sworn enemies! Every time, they would deliberately target us, snatching resources from our disciples. It’s precisely because of them that our ranking is very low each time, virtually counting from the back.”

The moment Little Fatty heard, he said furiously, “So arrogant? This time, Lord Fatty, I, must snatch all of the resources on them!”

Lin Xiu rolled her eyes at him and said huffily, “Just your bit of strength, it’s not even enough to fill the crevices between their teeth, still snatch their resources?”

Little Fatty chuckled and said, “Senior Apprentice Sister, I know that you’re strong, but Fatty, I, already can’t be compared to the past now! This time, I must let you see that your foresight is correct!”

This guy spoke rubbish. Lin Xiu glared fiercely, but in front of other capital cities’ disciples, she could not flare up and could only endure it.

When Zuo Xiang Capital City’s Origin Deity powerhouse saw Thundercry say nothing, he was even more pleased with himself.

He suddenly swept his gaze, landing on Ye Yuan, and said with a smile, “Tsk tsk, Wu Meng Capital City’s young disciples are really getting more abysmal with each generation! A late-stage Grotto Profound can actually take part in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial too. Do you all really can’t find people? Hahaha ...”

Thundercry’s gaze looked at him like looking at a fool. Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was indeed too confusing. But his strength could absolutely rank in the top three among this batch of outer-court disciples.

If Zuo Xiang Capital City turned the spearhead at Ye Yuan, they were bound to suffer a huge loss!

But Thundercry naturally would not explain anything. Let this idiot invite ridicule upon himself.

“Zhang Sheng, don’t look down on people! Ye Yuan is the strongest one among our batch of outer-court disciples! Even this season’s top dog was defeated under his hands! Let your outer-court disciples be more careful. Otherwise, if they lose their lives, don’t blame me for not warning you!”

Just as Thundercry was secretly pleased with himself. Qin Yuanlong suddenly came forward and condemned Zhang Sheng with righteous indignation.

The expressions of Wu Meng Capital City’s students all changed. Qin Yuanlong’s intention of killing with a borrowed knife was seriously too obvious!

It looked like Qin Yuanlong was defending Wu Meng Capital City’s reputation. But in reality, he was warning Zhang Sheng to target Ye Yuan.

“Qin Yuanlong, what’s the meaning of this?” Thundercry said furiously.

“Thundercry, Zuo Xiang Capital City is bullying people too far. Could it be that you can keep enduring?” Qin Yuanlong said neither obsequiously nor haughtily.

But by the side, Zhang Sheng looked at Ye Yuan half-dubiously and did not discover any unusual areas.

A late-stage Grotto Profound could defeat the top dog?

Was it this kid who was too strong, or Wu Meng Capital City’s this season’s top dog who was too weak?

Right at this time, a virtual image descended from the sky, appearing in the center of the plaza.

Those Origin Deity Realm powerhouses all bowed down and said, “We pay respects to Lord Xuan Ling!”

Seeing this Xuan Ling, Ye Yuan’s heart stirred.

The feeling that this virtual image gave him was the same as Wu Meng City Lord back then. They were actually both Divine Lord Realm powerhouses!

Xuan Ling nodded slightly and slowly said, “In a blink, it’s been another 200 years. Each of you seems to have quite a few additional new faces again. I won’t say much about the trial’s rules, I presume everyone is already very clear. This old man only looks at the results, not the process. Regardless of what means you all use, whoever obtains the most number of natural treasures in the end will be the winner. The capital city that obtains first place this time shall obtain one Four-star divine pill. The inner-court’s number one shall obtain a heavenly divine artifact, Spirit Gathering Plate. The outer-court’s first place shall obtain ten Weeping Spirit Fruits. Everyone, work hard.”

The moment Xuan Ling’s words came out, it immediately caused an uproar. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The rewards this time is actually the Spirit Gathering Plate! With this, cultivation speed can be ten times faster!”

“Weeping Spirit Fruit! It’s actually the Weeping Spirit Fruit! Ten Weeping Spirit Fruits is enough for me to break through to Heaven Glimpse Realm!”

“I didn’t expect that the rewards this time are actually so generous! It looks like I have to work hard!”

Hearing these rewards, the several thousand people were all incomparably excited.

Clearly, the things rewarded were all extremely rare items.

Ye Yuan was also secretly startled when he heard it. That Four-star divine pill was clearly awarded to the capital city’s city lord.

It was just that, the one able to obtain it was just one city lord.

No wonder each capital city paid so much attention to this Hundred Cities Smelting Trial.

Xuan Ling waved a hand. Several thousand green lights appeared in front of everyone.

Ye Yuan’s focused his eyes and looked over. It was a jade pendant.

“You all keep the jade pendant well. Right away, I’ll be sending you all to your respective areas immediately. Once you encounter any danger, crush the jade pendant. You all will be immediately transported back to the altar. Of course, the storage rings on you guys will also be left on the site.”

While talking, Xuan Ling kneaded seals with both hands. Ye Yuan only felt his eyes blur, his body vanishing from where he was once again.
