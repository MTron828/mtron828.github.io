Chapter 3091: Bitter Fight!

In the blood cloud, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly paused, stopping.

Chi Shang three people stopped too, looking at Ye Yuan calmly, revealing smug smiles.

This boy was indeed as rumored!

“What? Going to risk your life?” Chi Shang said with a smile.

Ye Yuan’s expression was grim, and he said, “If you all want to fight, let’s fight then!”

Meng Jin laughed loudly and said, “An Emperor Sakra Heaven is going to put up a desperate fight with us. I’m so scared!?Hahaha?…” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

You Lei also smiled and said, “A puny little Emperor Sakra Heaven, do you really take yourself to be the savior? Just the Hegemon Realms outside are as many as several hundred people. What can you change if you go? Under our blood race’s iron hooves, everything will be destroyed!”

The current Chi Shang was not in a hurry and said with a smile, “Lord Yi Xue really foretells things with divine accuracy! These words were taught to me by Lord Yi Xue. He said that after saying them, you’ll definitely fight! It’s indeed the case!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said, “What else did he say?”

Chi Shang said, “He even repeatedly urged us not to underestimate the enemy and to dispose of you straight away. But … we still underestimated the enemy. It’s just that looking at it now, this step was likely within Lord Yi Xue’s expectations too!”

Talking up to here, he was a little embarrassed.

Reality proved that Lord Yi Xue’s knowledge was far from what he could compare to!

But it also proved Lord Yi Xue’s horror even more.

......

A Hegemon against an Emperor Sakra Heaven was like an immortal against a mortal. They could not muster up a trace of interest at all.

Killing them was just a matter of huffing a breath of air.

No matter how monstrous this person was in other people’s words.

When Ye Yuan heard, he was shocked in his heart too.

This Yi Xue was extraordinary!

The strong were revered in this world. Martial strength could represent everything.

All schemes and intrigues were utterly not worth mentioning in front of powerful martial strength.

But this did not mean that intelligence was useless!

Those who work with their brains ruled, and those who work with their brawn were ruled.

Only by having powerful martial strength combined with a powerful mind could one truly become a powerhouse of a region, ruling an area.

With empty martial strength, one was just an ignorant person. Even if it was a Hegemon Realm, it was also not impossible to be toyed with by people.

Just like the Meng Jin earlier, he was toyed by Ye Yuan until he was confused and disoriented. He even thought that Ye Yuan was amazing.

This way, since this person attacked Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, he was probably already fully prepared.

Him being trapped inside the Bloodcloud Grand Array was just a part of the plan!

This Yi Xue was not simple. What he was scheming was huge!

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan could not hold back anymore. He was about to charge out of the Bloodcloud Grand Array.

After seven days, it would really have nothing to do with him anymore.

Even if he went out, it would be a road that led to death too!

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Since that’s the case, I’ll decide again after killing you guys!”

Chi Shang could not help laughing and said, “Kid, you’re merely a little fast. Do you really think that you can pick a fight with Hegemon Realms? Moreover, there are three of us!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said, “It’s indeed a little troublesome to kill you guys now. So, I planned on becoming a little stronger before taking action. But now, I changed my mind.”

Chi Shang shook his head and laughed in spite of himself. The origin in his body poured out, and he said coolly, “Is that so? Then try receiving a sword from me!”

There was an additional blood sword in Chi Shang’s hand. It emitted incomparably thick blood and evil energy.

This sword had drunk God knew how many people’s blood.

This was a grade five grandmist treasure. The moment it attacked, the power was formidable!

But Meng Jin and You Lei did not have the intention of taking action.

You lei smiled and said, “Chi Shang this guy got serious. This kid still doesn’t know how strong Chi Shang is!”

Meng Jin nodded and said, “Chi Shang is the number one person under Peak Hegemon in the blood race! If he gets serious, the likes of us will have to turn tail and run too, let alone a mere Emperor Sakra Heaven.”

You lei said, “Against Blood Drawing Sword Technique 18 moves, I wonder how many moves can this boy receive?”

“How many moves??Hur hur,?are you insulting Chi Shang?” Meng Jin immediately disapproved of it.

Clearly, these three people were led by Chi Shang.

His strength was also the strongest among the three people.

Chi Shang pointed his long sword. Ye Yuan only felt a bloody scent hitting him head-on, virtually knocking him out.

“Ye Yuan, my Blood Drawing 10 moves, each move is stronger than the last! When 18 moves are executed, I dare to contend with Peak Hegemons! You see how many moves you can receive!” Chi Shang’s words carried thick mockery.

He could not stand Ye Yuan looking down on him.

“First move, Blood Soul Slash!”

Chi Shang slashed out with his sword. The blood cloud was actually directly split in half by him, like cleaving a wave.

You Lei two people had cold smiles hanging on their faces. It was as if already seeing the sight of Ye Yuan being split into two.

But at this time, four astonishing bloodline powers poured out of Ye Yuan’s body. Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, these four phantoms, appeared in east, west, south, and north directions.

At this time, the four great true spirit bloodlines in Ye Yuan’s body actually all reached peak heaven qian grade already!

The current power was no idea how much stronger than when he was at Heavenly Dragon Island!

The four symbols resonated!

Traces of saint force poured into the Myriad Realms Mountains!

The seven Myriad Realms Mountains merged into one!

Immediately, the seven Myriad Realms Mountains shone with boundless radiance and gave off an incomparable power!

The seven Myriad Realms Mountains were re-sanctified by Ye Yuan with nine array elements.

The power of this chaos heavenly treasure coupled with the world’s strongest nine element array formation, the increase in power was not a tiny bit!

“Saint force! This … How is this possible?” You Lei cried out in surprise, shock all over his face.

An Emperor Sakra Heaven actually used saint force!

Under the augmentation of saint force, the power of the Myriad Realms Mountains obtained a huge amplification.

Chi Shang’s pupils also constricted, but he already slashed his sword out. They naturally had to determine a victor.

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint, an unparalleled bloody light and a pale light collided together.

Boom!

A loud rumble sounded out. Ye Yuan and Chi Shang shot backward.

Ye Yuan’s entire body shook violently. A trace of fresh blood was already seeping out of the corners of his mouth. Clearly, he was quite injured.

This Chi Shang was too strong!

But Chi Shang three people were long already stupefied.

The opponent was just an Emperor Sakra Heaven!

He actually blocked the sword move of the blood race’s number one ordinary Hegemon!

This sort of thing, no one would dare to believe it at all if it spread.

All beneath Hegemon were ants. This sentence was not just empty words.

What Hegemon Realm used was the Dao of Origin.

Emperor Sakra Heaven, even if it was origin powerhouses, they only slightly learned the rudiments too. There was no effusion of the Door of Eternal Life at all.

Without the increase of power through the Door of Eternal Life origin, it was simply impossible for Emperor Sakra Heavens to be a match for Hegemon Realms.

But now, Ye Yuan was defying the heavens!

This guy actually used the saint force that only Great Beyond powerhouses could use. Then he activated a chaos heavenly treasure and battled with a Hegemon Realm!

Ye Yuan wiped away the blood stain from the corners of his mouth and said with a cold smile, “Hegemon Realm is nothing more than this too! Come, fight again!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan actually urged the Myriad Realms Mountain and took the initiative to launch an attack against Chi Shang!

Chi Shang’s expression became very ugly. Raising his sword and advancing again, he cried out angrily, “Second move, Tide of Jade Blood! Die!”

This sword actually received the resonance of the Bloodcloud Grand Array.

Bloodcloud Grand Array’s origin of blood actually had an enhancement effect on Chi Shang’s sword move!

Boom!

The void trembled again. The two people separated upon contact.

Ye Yuan was sent flying again, but he still only sustained injuries.

Chi Shang’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He was already very certain. Ye Yuan indeed had the strength to fight with a Hegemon Realm!

Saint force was too scary!
