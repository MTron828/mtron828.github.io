Chapter 3007: Hegemons From Every Heaven Arriving Simultaneously!

“Old Man Mi Zhen, if you still don’t come out, this progenitor will turn your old nest upside down and kill off your dragon descendants!”

Progenitor Kong Nie’s voice blasted until the entire Heavenly Dragon Island was wobbly.

Each and every one of the Peak Hegemons and Supreme Hegemons that originally arrived in a threatening manner lowered their banners and silenced the drums.

This ancestor was a great malefic star!

All the heavens and myriad worlds, there were none who did not fear him when they saw him.

Even some Supreme Hegemons also ran far away when they saw him.

If not for the Dragon Clan having a Great Beyond Realm ancestor holding down the fort, this old fellow would not be shouting here. He would directly exterminate Heavenly Dragon Island!

At this time, the Hegemon powerhouses gathered on Heavenly Dragon Island reached as many as a hundred!

Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven’s three clans were also all present.

Heavenly Dragon Island’s powerhouses all felt their scalps tingle.

Heavenly Dragon Island had never seen before such a grand line-up.

“Progenitor Kong Nie, please calm your anger. We can work things out.” Facing an existence like Kong Nie, Long Jian had no choice but to lower his head too and could only smile fawningly.

But Progenitor Kong Nie did not buy it and said with a cold snort, “Long Jian brat, don’t give this progenitor that! So many people are here. You should know why this progenitor came! Where’s Old Man Mi Zhen? Make him get out! Otherwise, Your Father will really go on a killing spree! This progenitor’s notoriety isn’t a false reputation!”

Long Jian felt his scalp tingle and said with a bitter smile, “My progenitor is currently in closed-seclusion. Progenitor Kong Nie, please enter the clan to have a chat.”

Boom!

Progenitor Kong Nie threw a punch out. A mountain range on Heavenly Dragon Island was directly leveled to the ground by him.

...

The expressions of the dragon race powerhouses changed one after another. Progenitor Kong Nie was too strong!

Meanwhile, the other Hegemons had gloating looks.

“Keep talking crap, and it will be your clan the next time! This ancestor is saying it for the last time. Get Old Man Mi Zhen to come out!” Progenitor Kong Nie said in a solemn voice.

Actually, he somewhat turned angry from embarrassment.

Previously, in the Eternal River, it was considered that he had a showdown with Ye Yuan, but he was completely defeated in the end.

Kong Nie thought that he had lost to Mi Zhen. So he was very unhappy.

Long Jian felt that he was collapsing. Kong Nie this old fellow was not easy to serve!

Rumble! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The void trembled slightly. An enormous true dragon appeared from the void. It was Mi Zhen who arrived.

“Old Man Kong Nie, you came to my Dragon Clan to act wildly. Do you really take it that this progenitor is kneaded out of mud?” Mi Zhen said angrily.

“Humph! You take a look at how many people are on Heavenly Dragon Island to settle scores with you! You turned the Eternal River upside down. Everyone can’t cultivate anymore. You’re still blaming this progenitor for coming to act wildly? Do you believe that this progenitor will fight with you right now?” Kong Nie did not give in at all.

Mi Zhen fell silent. He had not been cultivating in the Eternal River these few years and really did not know what happened.

He could not help looking at Long Jian and discovered that the latter was currently smiling bitterly.

Long Jian did not hide it either, recounting the matter of Ye Yuan’s cultivation.

When the Hegemons from all the heavens heard, each and every one were inexplicably shocked.

“What? It’s actually not Progenitor Mi Zhen?”

“A dragon race junior stirred up all the heavens?”

“We all, these Hegemon Realms, are actually not a brat’s match?”

... ...

Kong Nie wanted face a lot. Right now, his face was somewhat lost.

He thought that he lost to Mi Zhen, but who knew that he actually lost to a brat!

Where would he, this fiend race ancestor’s face, be put?

“Mi Zhen, make that brat get out! Otherwise, don’t blame this seat for killing my way into the Dragon Clan’s Eternal River!” Kong Nie said in a solemn voice.

Bai Zhi also spoke up in a timely manner, “Long Jian, the three years deadline is up. You aren’t going to go back on your words, right? Today, there are more than a hundred Hegemon Realms here. Are you going to give everyone an explanation?”

“A brat turned the Eternal River upside down. How preposterous!”

... ...

Each and every one of all the heaven’s Hegemons lashed out in denouncement.

Those who crossed worlds to come were all not easy to deal with.

There were many of them who were interrupted at the critical juncture of cultivation, and each and every one of them was angry.

Mi Zhen was also extremely shocked in his heart. He thought that letting Ye Yuan enter the Eternal River was just a small matter.

Who knew that he actually got into such big trouble.

Disturbing the cultivation of more than a hundred Hegemon Realm powerhouses, this was no joking matter.

Even if he was a Great Beyond powerhouse, he could not quite withstand it too!

Of course, he did not want to withstand it too.

Long Jian felt that Ye Yuan was promising, but he had a stomach full of complaints with regard to Ye Yuan.

Dragonsand was his right-hand man, but he was entrapped to death by Ye Yuan.

If not for fear of being exposed, he would have long smacked Ye Yuan to death with a slap.

Right at this time, there was a tremor in the void. Another figure descended.

When Long Jian saw the arrival, his scalp could not help tingling.

Another Great Beyond powerhouse!

When Kong Nie saw the arrival, he could not help laughing loudly and said, “Younger Sister Qian Yu, I didn’t expect that you’re here too! With this, this progenitor wants to see whether Mi Zhen this old thing still dares to be protective of his own or not!”

Hegemon Qian Yu, the feather race’s ancestor, Great Beyond Realm overlord!

Currently, two mighty Great Beyond Realm powerhouses were here to denounce publicly for crimes. It suddenly put the Dragon Clan on the fire to roast.

The feather race were all beauties. This Hegemon Qian Yu was a peerless great beauty. Her face was exquisite to the extreme, beautiful until it made people asphyxiate.

Even when Kong Nie saw her, his attitude relaxed significantly too.

But currently, her face was cold as frost, looking at Mi Zhen as she said in a solemn voice, “Mi Zhen, is your Dragon Clan going to offend the myriad races from all the heavens?”

Mi Zhen’s expression was somewhat ugly, cursing Ye Yuan 18 times in his heart.

This punk was really capable of causing trouble!

“Go, call Ye Yuan over to apologize to the seniors!” Mi Zhen said in a solemn voice.

“Progenitor!” Long Jian said unwillingly.

During the past years, Ye Yuan already broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Right now, he was currently at the critical moment of assaulting Sovereign Heavenly Stratum.

Calling him out at this time would be wasting all his previous efforts!

He was currently already very certain that the cultivation method that Ye Yuan created was very remarkable.

If Ye Yuan could rise, it would definitely be very beneficial to the Dragon Clan.

Interrupting Ye Yuan now was tantamount to ruining the Great Wall themselves!

“Didn’t you hear what this progenitor said?” Mi Zhen’s tone became cold.

Long Jian stood where he was but did not move.

After a moment of silence, he raised his head boldly and said, “Progenitor, Ye Yuan has tremendous potential! Our Dragon Clan should shoulder this matter!”

Mi Zhen knew that Long Jian was a straightforward man, so he did not like him, and also knew that he was unable to completely obey his orders.

Hence, that was why he chose Dragonsand.

It was just that he did not expect that Long Jian actually contradicted him to his face.

“Hahaha ... Mi Zhen, you’re really declining with age! You, the exalted progenitor, actually can’t command your subordinates! I think that your Dragon Clan’s situation has really gone from bad to worse ever since Mi Tian!” Kong Nie could not help laughing loudly when he saw this.

Mi Zhen’s face was gloomy to the extreme.

He stared fixed at Long Jian, killing intent ice-cold.

Long Jian did not speak, but the look in his eyes was extremely stubborn!

Mi Zhen snorted coldly and said, “Since that’s the case, everyone enters the Dragon Clan’s Eternal River together with this progenitor then to invite this ‘lord’ out!”

Kong Nie laughed loudly and said, “Alright! This ancestor also really wants to see what this brat who turned the Eternal River into this situation looks like!”

Hence, Mi Zhen brought the group of Hegemons and headed to the Eternal River.

Looking at everyone’s departing back view, Long Jian could not help sighing heavily.

Just as everyone was about to enter the passageway, the passageway flashed with light, and a figure slowly walked out.
