Chapter 1251: Battling the Stonemen Again

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This ... Is this the true power of the Sacred Dragon Token?”

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan was also incredibly shocked.

An over 70 thousand feet mountain, even displaying the Fury Sword Fire Lotus with the Evil Extermination Sword, there was also no way to do it to such an extent.

But this Sacred Dragon Token accomplished it easily.

“Huhu, this power is merely the tip of the iceberg of the Sacred Dragon Token. If an Origin Deity Realm used this Sacred Dragon Token, moving mountains and filling the seas are just inconsequential,” the old ancestor said with a laugh.

“Mm?” Ye Yuan’s brows suddenly furrowed.

“You’re going to break through?” The old ancestor looked towards Ye Yuan in surprise.

Currently, all the essence energy in Ye Yuan’s body was surging, his realm very unstable. Clearly, it was the sign of being about to break through.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The Sacred Dragon Token absorbed the sacred ancestor blood essence and returned back large quantities of divine essence, directly assisting me to break through the bottleneck.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At once, Ye Yuan did not hesitate anymore, breaking through on the spot.

To Ye Yuan, the breakthrough of essence energy realm was just water flowing when the canal was formed. It already did not cause much of a wave for him.

After a day, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes, emitting rays of brilliant light.

After breaking through, Ye Yuan was a first-rate divine king. Just one more step, and he could reach grand completion.

At that time, he would be able to refine the Dao Defying Pill and assault that fleeting and ephemeral Deity Realm!

The old ancestor was observing the whole process of Ye Yuan’s breakthrough all along. A glimmer of shock also flashed across his eyes.

“I didn’t expect that your primary cultivation method is actually a peak divine formula too! Such pure essence energy, when you reach grand completion, this old man probably won’t be your match anymore!” the old ancestor said with an emotional sigh.

Essence, energy, and spirit, three paths, what Ye Yuan cultivated were all the top-grade Divine Dao arts.

Once achieved grand completion, the power would be very terrifying!

So much so that it would be even greater compared to the Fang Tian back then!

“Ancestor is limited by Heavenly Dao, that’s why you feel so vexed. It’s not that your strength is really no good,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

The ancestor chuckled and said, “Are you leaving now?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I’ll go bid farewell to Mother, then I’m leaving.”

The ancestor let out a sigh and said, “This path is arduous, I wish you speedy success!”

When Ye Yuan returned to the cold pool, there naturally could not dispense with a bout of reluctance to part with Ao Jun. But finally, he still bade farewell and left.

According to Ye Yuan’s estimations, Ao Jun at most still had several decades of longevity inside this cool pool. Wasting an additional day, Ao Jun would be in a little more danger.

Although the Eternity Frost was magical, it was also unable to stop the curse of this land of exile.

For her to be able to live until now was already a miracle in itself.

The old ancestor sent Ye Yuan and his group out of the Peach Blossom Forest. White Light suddenly looked at Ye Yuan and said with a vicissitude of emotion, “Big Brother, I really didn’t expect that you and I actually still had such an origin. No wonder the first time I laid eyes on you, I felt very cordial.”

Ye Yuan also sighed endlessly. He completely did not expect that entering the Godsfall Mountain Range this time, it actually resolved the mystery of his background, and found the mother that he had never met before.

The White Light who went through thick and thin with him was actually the descendant of Mother’s close sister.

Perhaps, everything was really foreordained by heaven.

He met with misfortune and entered the Endless World, then entered the Endless Forest and saved White Light.

Going in circles for a bit, the two people barged into the land of exile together again.

All these were summed up by a ‘fate’ word.

“Yeah, haha! The little tiger back then is already a leviathan of the Divine Realm now,” Ye Yuan said with a big laugh.

White Light’s face involuntarily turned red, and he retorted, “To say leviathan, you’re the one right, Big Brother? You’re already the human race and demon race’s common leader!”

Li-er smile and said, “The two of you brothers stop blowing your own trumpets. Big Brother Yuan, where are we going now? Going over from here, it seems like we still have to pass through those stonemen’s territory. If we go over, they will probably find trouble again.”

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “If they don’t come to find trouble with me, I still want to find trouble with them! This young master wants to take a look at whether or not they really can’t be killed!

The three people came to the foot of the mountain. Ye Yuan did not say a word. Lifting his hand, it was a Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm.

Boom!

A palm came out, debris flew everywhere, directly shaving off a small part of the mountain.

This intense tremor startled those ten stonemen awake.

“Damn it! Who is it? To dare disturb our slumber?” Stonebrave’s roar came over.

Three figures landed, looking at him with a smile that was not a smile.

“Blockhead, this little lord, I, returned!”

Stonebrave could not help being stifled. Only after staring at Ye Yuan for a long time did he recall who Ye Yuan was and could not help saying in terror, “You ... didn’t you enter that Peach Blossom Forest? How can you possibly come out?”

This place was neighboring the Peach Blossom Forest. Stonebrave naturally knew about the Peach Blossom Forest’s terror.

He had seen quite a number of people enter the Peach Blossom Forest before, but no one had ever come out before.

But this human in front of him actually came out!

“Heh,

however vast the world is, which place can I, this little lord, not go it? Just a mere peach blossom forest, this little lord is about to go to the god-forbidden region right away.” Ye Yuan said disdainfully.

“God-forbidden region? Heh, human, you really dare to boast. That place, even if Deity Realm powerhouses go in, it’s also without return. With just the likes of your bit of strength, you also wish to enter the god-forbidden region?” Stonebrave said in disbelief.

“You can’t go, doesn’t mean that this little lord can’t go!” Ye Yuan said.

Stonebrave burst out laughing when he heard that and said, “What a joke! You can’t even go past me, you still want to enter the god-forbidden region? Brothers, crush him into a meat pancake for me!”

Ten blockheads attacked together. That spectacle was truly grand.

Except, Ye Yuan broke through to first-rate divine king, his strength went up another level.

Compared to before, he was much stronger.

Ye Yuan’s figure moved, the Fury Sword Fire Lotus suddenly attacked, directly welcoming Stonebrave’s iron-fist.

Boom!

One of Stonebrave’s arms was directly blown away.

He looked at Ye Yuan in terror and said in disbelief, “Human, just how long has it been, your strength actually improved so quickly!”

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “This is just starting!”

Stonebrave gave a loud roar. His body was just like a magnet, sucking the rubble over.

Very soon, his arm recovered.

“Human, I admit that you’re very strong! But our stonemen clan can’t be killed! No matter how powerful your strength is, it’s of no avail as well!” Stonebrave said.

Ye Yuan laughed coldly and said, “Is that so? But this young master doesn’t believe that there’s someone who can’t be killed in this world!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly disappeared.

Boom!

A stoneman was directly blown to stone rubble by the Fury Sword Fire Lotus.

Stonebrave was greatly enraged when he saw the situation. Brandishing his fists, he smashed over towards Ye Yuan.

However, after Ye Yuan broke through to first-rate divine king, his movement technique had a substantial increase again, and he flew away in a blink of an eye.

That stoneman that was smashed to pieces pieced back together very quickly.

Ye Yuan did not reveal a look of surprise. He relied on his movement technique and wandered about between the ten stonemen.

Occasionally attacking, it directly smashed a stoneman to pieces.

However, Ye Yuan opened up his perception fully and captured every detail of the battlefield.

Suddenly, a hint of a smile flickered across the corners of his mouth.

“Human, do you only know how to dodge and hide?” Stonebrave could not catch Ye Yuan and could not help flying into a great rage.

“Huhu, coming!”

Boom!

A sword attacked, directly blowing a stoneman to pieces.

However, Ye Yuan’s next action made Stonebrave and the rest stop abruptly.
