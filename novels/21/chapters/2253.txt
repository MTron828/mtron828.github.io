Chapter 2257: You All Were Wrong!

“What’s going on here? This brat clearly almost could not make it just now. So why did he suddenly erupt?”

“It turns out that this brat has been hiding his strength all along!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“My God! Turns out that his Formation Dao strength already rivals those in the Deva Realm? This boy is really a freak!”

... ...

With one move, people on the entire mountain were amazed!

The divine essence that Ye Yuan fired out in an instant, it blotted out the skies and covered the earth.

When Shui Yuan and Lonesoul saw this terrifying scene, they were immediately frightened until their complexions turned pale.

The restrictions above 2000 miles were sufficient to take their lives!

Ye Yuan taking action at this time was clearly aiming to drive to death.

“Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye, save us!” Shui Yuan cried out in alarm.

The light that filled the sky caught Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye by surprise, making his expression change wildly.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s heart shook wildly. He had some understanding of Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao strength and felt that it was impossible to reach such a degree!

Unless ... Ye Yuan comprehended even more restrictions on Eight Void Mountain!

This shock was by no means insignificant!

How could someone be monstrous to such a degree?

He actually still had leftover strength to comprehend Dao under his frenzied bombardment?

Furthermore, what Ye Yuan comprehended was not a little bit, but leaps and bounds!

A qualitative leap!

If Ye Yuan previously had half a foot stepped into the gate of ‘Dao,’ then now, he truly entered the domain of Dao!

However, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye was ultimately a Deva Realm major power. Although he was startled, he did not panic!

It was only to see Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye repeatedly snap his fingers, firing out countless streams of divine essence in an instant, neutralizing the restrictions that Ye Yuan fired out.

“Fine lad! You’re truly cunning to the extreme. Even this emperor almost succumbed too! However ... want to turn the situation around with this? Dream on!” Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye gave a cold laugh and said disdainfully.

He knew the restrictions above these 2000 miles like the back of his hands. So how could he lose to a junior?

The killing traps above these 2000 miles were like child’s play to him.

Crack!

Right at this moment, a shocking bolt of lightning suddenly fell.

The pale-white lightning tore across the sky. It was as if rending the sky into two.

Horrifying power, the explosive clap of thunder, shocked until everyone suddenly jumped

There were a few Eight-star Formation Gods who almost stepped on the wrong nodes and almost set off restrictions.

This scene came too suddenly, abrupt until everyone did not react to it.

Rumble!

This shocking bolt of lightning landed on Heavenly Eye three people’s bodies with an inconceivably swift speed.

“Urgh!”

The three people gave a muffled groan, akin to being struck by five thunderbolts, instantly blasting them into a daze.

Receiving such a fierce blow, the three great Deva Realms’ auras immediately withered significantly.

Especially Heavenly Emperor Lonesoul, his body was practically dissipating under this strike.

Although he stabilized his figure in the end by relying on his powerful strength, his body became incomparably illusory all at once.

Heavenly Emperor Lonesoul was a soul body and was most afraid of lightning.

Ordinary lightning was nothing, but how could the power of this Deva Realm array formation be ordinary?

As for the other two people, they were a little better than him but also suffered heavy damage.

It was just that this scene, in everyone’s eyes, was even more shocking than that bolt of lightning just now.

The restriction was triggered!

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye, this formation path grandmaster, actually lost to an Empyrean Realm junior in a battle of formation!

This turnaround was too astonishing, resulting in everyone forgetting their thoughts for a moment.

A second ago, Ye Yuan was already in the throes of his deathbed struggle.

The next second, he actually dealt a superb major turnaround, setting off a Deva Realm restriction!

The entire Eight Void Mountain fell into death-like silence.

Riverword stared dumbfoundedly with amazement. He opened his mouth wide and looked at Ye Yuan, an expression like he had seen a ghost. It was as if it was his first time knowing him.

“H-Heavenly Eye lost?” He still did not quite dare to believe it.

“Is my eyesight failing? Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye is a legendary figure of Eight Void Mountain. He ... He was actually defeated?”

“Just what kind of person is this boy? His Formation Dao attainments are also too terrifying, right?”

“A puny little Empyrean boy actually seriously wounded a Deva Realm powerhouse! This incident ... will likely become the Eight Void Mountain’s new legend!”

... ...

The surrounding Eight-star Formation Gods all used astonished gazes to look at Ye Yuan, sucking in cold breaths.

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Eye and said with a cold smile, “Akin to walking on flat ground below 3000 miles? Huhu, I think not, right?”

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye comprehended Dao at 3000 miles and knew the restrictions below 3000 miles like the back of his hand.

Just earlier, he was still saying that it was akin to walking on flat ground below 3000 miles.

But in a blink, he had his face slapped by this bolt of lightning.

Suffering this blow, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s powers were immediately more than half gone.

However, Deva Realm powerhouses were indeed formidable to the extreme. The restriction that Ye Yuan exhausted all his ability to detonate was actually unable to kill them.

Heavenly Eye was very weak, but he had puzzlement all over his face as he said, “This ... How is this possible? I clearly already cracked all of them!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You think that you know the array formations here. But actually ... you don’t understand them at all! Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions are far more impressive than what you can imagine!”

Heavenly Eye’s pupils constricted, even more confused.

“You all definitely think that Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions are one connected to another. As long as you comprehend all of these restrictions, even if you crack the restrictions, you can scale Eight Void Mountain unceasingly,” Ye Yuan said in a clear voice.

Many Eight-star Formation Gods secretly nodded their heads but had curious looks. Could it be that it was not like this?

“You are all wrong! This Eight Void Mountain’s grand array is a living grand array! On the same flat surface, there are countless kinds of restrictions, and they aren’t fixed and unchangeable! When you crack a restriction, actually, you’re still inside another restriction! Different combination methods will form restrictions with varying powers! Therefore, when you’re standing on a node, it might be the intersection point of many restrictions! These intersection points are just the formation eyes of many array formations, it’s just able to let you pass through safely, that’s all! But, comprehending the formations like this, it’s impossible for you guys to ever walk to the summit!”

Ye Yuan’s words were akin to thunderbolts falling on their heads, exploding in everyone’s ears.

Powerhouses that could walk to 2700 and 2800 miles, which one was not a distinguished talent in Formation Dao?

Whether or not Ye Yuan’s words made sense, they were clear at once!

If this Eight Void Mountain’s array formations were formed by countless nodes, linking up a few of the nodes would be a restriction.

What they comprehended were the restrictions after these few nodes were linked up.

But, actually, these points were merely just a shared node used by several restrictions!

The things that they comprehended were too surface-level!

“Wrong! We were all wrong!”

“Ah! So that’s how it is! So that’s how it is! My many years of comprehending Formation Dao was really utterly wasted!”

“I understand! I thought that my Formation Dao is already close to Dao, but only now do I know that I know nothing at all! This emperor will descend the mountain right away and comprehend Dao from the beginning!”

... ...

Quite a few Eight-star Formation Gods actually went straight down the mountain.

Ye Yuan’s words were akin to being filled with wisdom, letting them understand the crux involved all at once.

Only then did they understand that turns out, the things that they comprehended all along were nothing at all!

At the same time, there were some people with vacant looks.

Something that was upheld for so many years being denied, this sort of blow could be imagined.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye had a lifeless look.

His countless years of pride, it was shattered to smithereens at this instant!
