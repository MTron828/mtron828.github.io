Chapter 2770: Sudden Idea!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The more Guo Huai fought, the more alarmed he became.

It was because he detected that Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was becoming more and more consolidated!

This guy’s adaptability in the middle of battle was a little too formidable!

Cultivation realm consolidating, Ye Yuan’s sword formation became more and more solid.

Previously, Guo Huai’s saber intent could still suppress Ye Yuan.

But now, the two of them were really evenly matched.

In fact, Ye Yuan already had faint signs of breaking through and gradually turned around to suppress him!

This rate of improvement was simply outrageous to hear!

“Huhu, you seem to be unable to suppress anymore!” Ye Yuan said with a light laugh.

The imposing aura on his body grew stronger and stronger. Guo Huai was already unable to resist anymore.

Guo Huai’s expression changed, and he said in horror, “You ... You’re going to break through?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “To you guys, maybe breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven is an extremely difficult thing. But to me, it’s merely something that will happen without effort. Now, I’m already at grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven. Only this last step is missing!”

Above the void, the wind and clouds were already starting to fluctuate.

Signs of a breakthrough had already begun!

The shock in Guo Huai’s heart could not be any greater.

He had never seen before a genius who broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven so easily!

Saint Sovereign Heaven was a massive hurdle.

Even if one’s talent was exceptional, they also needed sufficient accumulations before they could break through.

But Ye Yuan did not need it at all!

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly changed.

A huge crisis surged in Ye Yuan’s heart.

At the same time, Guo Huai’s face revealed a look of greater shock than just now.

It was because he felt it too!

“This ... How is this possible? You’re actually ... going to transcend tribulation already?” Guo Huai cried out involuntarily.

Yes!

In that instant just now, he felt the aura of Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation!

Ye Yuan actually triggered the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation at the juncture of breakthrough!

This was simply inconceivable!

The condition for Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulations to trigger was normally all calculated in years.

Some people could only trigger it once every ten thousand years. But others could trigger it once every few thousand years.

And the shorter the time indicated the greater the potential of this person!

Saint Sovereign, it had never been heard of that someone triggered the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation when breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Guo Huai felt like he was almost suffocating.

Just what kind of a monster did the Pill Alliance provoke!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s figure swayed, and he stopped the fight.

Guo Huai looked toward Ye Yuan, fearful to the extreme.

This guy was simply a human-shaped monster!

Ye Yuan, who withdrew from battle, his aura suddenly stopped skyrocketing, as if being forcibly nipped in the bud.

Guo Huai’s pupils constricted, and he said with a cold smile, “Ye Yuan, you’re afraid! Triggering the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation when breaking through is unprecedented! Your Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation must be very horrifying!”

Ye Yuan looked at Guo Huai and said with a smile, “You’re thinking too much! I suppressed my realm, not because I’m scared of the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation. It’s just that I feel that this isn’t the place to break through.”

Guo Huai laughed loudly and said, “It’s useless! Your talent has evoked Heaven’s jealousy. No matter where you break through, Heavenly Dao will kill you!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a smile, “Guo Huai, you brought people to destroy Shangyu Heavenly Sect back then! Slaughtering more than 5000 people in Shangyu Heavenly Sect, your sins are heinous! Originally, I was planning on directly killing you. But now, I’ve changed my mind!”

Guo Huai’s expression changed, secretly thinking that things were bad, but only to feel his head buzz, and he was dazed.

“ARGH!!”

When Guo Huai woke up, he could not help crying out in pain. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ye Yuan already crippled his cultivation!

Back then, Ye Yuan saved many Martial Secure Heavenly Sect disciples with the Hundred Poison Formation, letting many disciples escape with their lives.

But Shangyu Heavenly Sect did not have Ye Yuan.

They got surrounded by the Pill Alliance, and their entire sect was massacred, blood flowing like rivers!

And the main culprit was Guo Huai!

Ye Yuan naturally would not select targets at random.

If he wanted to destroy the branches, he would also find the people who took action back then.

Firstly, it was a probe.

Secondly, it was also to avenge the five heavenly sects.

The battle back then was really incomparably tragic.

No, it should be that it was a one-sided massacre!

Guo Huai was one of the executioners!

Guo Huai’s eyes turned bloodshot from anger, his eyes full of resentment as he let out a wild laugh and said, “Ye Yuan, your talent is too terrifying, evoking Heaven’s jealousy! You’ll definitely die! Even if you torment me, it won’t change this fact too!”

Ye Yuan looked at Guo Huai and said with a smile, “Is that so? Then I’ll give you a chance and let you see me being killed by the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation! However ... if I go to the Pill Alliance and lure a bunch of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, and then I break through to call down the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation, don’t you think that it will be very interesting?”

When Guo Huai heard that, his entire body could not help trembling!

This guy was insane!

Ye Yuan’s Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation would definitely be extremely terrifying.

If he broke through in the crowd, it would be equivalent to a moving bomb!

The consequences ... were too ghastly to contemplate!

“You ... You lunatic! Your Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation, if you prepare adequately, there’s still a glimmer of hope! But, if you really do this, you’ll definitely die without a doubt!” Guo Huai said fearfully.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard that and said, “Whether or not I die, you’ll know when the time comes!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan carried the dead-dog-like Guo Huai and left the Bright Sun Branch.

... ...

Very soon, a piece of news that shocked the Five Great Heavenly Regions spread.

The Heaven’s chosen of his generation, Ye Yuan, destroyed the Bright Sun Branch with his power alone!

Bright Sun Branch’s Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, all were exterminated!

Bright Sun Branch’s alliance chief, Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse Guo Huai, was captured alive by Ye Yuan, his whereabouts unknown!

What was even more shocking was that Ye Yuan was actually not a Saint Sovereign Heaven yet!

“This news is fake, right? How can a Jade Sovereign Heaven possibly defeat Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses?”

“Yeah, this is also exaggerated too ridiculously! If you say that Ye Yuan was powerful and escaped from Guo Huai’s hands, I still believe it. But, to say that Ye Yuan captured Guo Huai alive, I don’t believe it even if you beat me to death!”

“What do you know? In the great battle that day, there were thousands of Pill Alliance disciples watching the fight! Ye Yuan killed all of the Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses but gave the other disciples a way out! Everyone present can testify!”

“There’s still this matter? But ... But how is this possible?”

... ...

For some time, the people were all talking about this.

Especially the various major heavenly sects that were being ruled by the Pill Alliance, their thoughts started stirring at this time.

Finally, someone started provoking the Pill Alliance!

These few years, they lived like dogs. There was finally someone who started to resist!

Furthermore, the resistance was even so sharp!

One had to know, destroying a branch, this was absolutely a tremendous blow to the Pill Alliance!

Especially a Saint Sovereign Heaven, this was not some cabbage!

Each Saint Sovereign Heaven was a strategic power.

One death had a great impact on the battle situation!

In a secret place in True Yang Heavenly Domain, a group of Saint Sovereign Heavens was gathered here.

Saint Exalt Waycloud laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha ... Invigorating! Invigorating! That overweeningly arrogant Pill Alliance finally has someone to take care of them! Younger Brother Ye is quiet when not making a move, but the moment he took action, it amazed the world with a single brilliant feat!”

Saint Exalt Pill Alliance said, “Guo Huai isn’t some random Tom, Dick, or Harry! His strength can rank in the top three among the Pill Alliance’s lower Saint Sovereign Heavens! Younger Brother Ye can actually capture him alive with his power alone!”

But Saint Exalt Skyfortune frowned and said, “But why didn’t Younger Brother Ye kill him immediately? Also, he hasn’t come to inform us until now. Could it be that ... he’s planning on destroying the Pill Alliance by himself?”

Saint Exalt Purplesun shook his head and said, “I heard that Younger Brother Ye raided Bright Sun Branch in order to consolidate his realm! It looks like he’s planning to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven first! However, with his combat power, after breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, he might not be unable to fight with that Li Changsheng! But I’m very curious. What on earth is he planning to do by capturing Guo Huai alive? I keep feeling that ... he’s going to do something unexpected!”
