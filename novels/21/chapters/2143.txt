Chapter 2147: Decisive

“Old Bai, you wouldn’t be lying through your teeth, right? A mere True God Realm’s breakthrough can blow the third seal open?”

When Bai Chen returned to the abyss, he recounted the things that he saw, immediately drawing the other powerhouses’ suspicion.

A mere True God Realm expert breaking through to the Empyrean Realm, no matter how monstrous, it was also impossible to blow up the third seal!”

One had to know that this third seal, even if it was a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor, they could forget about breaching it in the slightest too.

In the darkness, Bai Chen could not be bothered to provide an explanation and said with a light smile, “Heh, really an interesting kid! Not only did he blow open the seal, he actually even discovered my existence. Oh, right, Boss, that kid even has some connection to you! I see that this kid is pretty good, so I left behind some lucky chances to him on your behalf. Of course, if he falls into a wrong path in the future, you can borrow it to restrict him too.”

“Oh? Listening to you, it’s indeed an interesting little fellow. It’s too bad that we can’t abandon our posts. Otherwise, I’d really go and take a look at this kid. But listening to what you said, this boy is extraordinary. The Heavenspan World will likely be in an upheaval situation again.” Amidst the gloomy and dark abyss, another voice came over.

Bai Chen sighed slightly and said, “It’s as the Doomsday Battle is right before our eyes. I didn’t expect that Heavenly Dao Samsara is finally going to start again.”

After sighing, everyone fell silent. The abyss recovered tranquility once more.

... ...

Inside Raindragon Stronghold, Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were all present.

The entrance of the Dragon Eye Cave was shaking intensely and actually started cracking apart.

Everyone’s divine essence poured out wildly, joining hands to stabilize the seal.

But a powerful strength burst out of the seal, making the faces of the group of Heavenly Emperors turn white.

Seven to eight Heavenly Emperor joined hands before barely managing to maintain the seal from breaking.

Long Chi’s complexion was ashen as he gritted his teeth and said, “Damn it! Whe Dragon Eye Cave’s seal has never had a problem before. Why did it cause such a big commotion this time?”

Dragon Lord’s face was also pale as she said, “I’m afraid that a powerful abyss monster was born inside and it’s assaulting the seal? Xiaochun will be ... fine inside, right?”

Long Chi smiled coldly and said, “Like this, it’s good too, at least that boy is definitely dead! Hao-er, your spirit in heaven can rest in peace.”

Long Zhi suddenly thought of something and opened his mouth and said, “Dragon Lord, this commotion ... wouldn’t be caused by Xiaochun encountering some danger, right?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed.

Clearly, this sort of possibility was very high.

“Humph! Indeed a misfortune star, not stopping even after entering the Dragon Eye Cave!” Long Chi said with a cold snort.

Dragon Lord’s pretty face turned slightly cold as she said in a cold voice, “Long Chi! Don’t you forget Xiaochun’s identity! The Dragon Eye Cave was originally managed by you, but because of your negligence, you let Xiaochun fall into a dangerous situation. If this matter was reported upstairs, can you bear the consequences?”

Long Chi’s face changed slightly, not daring to speak anymore.

“Mn? The undulations seem to be smaller!” Suddenly, Long Zhi spoke up.

Sure enough, the intense undulations coming from inside gradually became small, finally completely stabilizing.

All of the Heavenly Emperors finally let out a sigh in relief.

At this time, a din suddenly came from outside the stone tower.

Long Chi was currently pissed, and he said with a cold snort, “Who is making noise here? Don’t they know that this is a restricted area inside the stronghold?”

As he said, his figure moved, disappearing on the spot.

“You all, let me go in! Let me go in!” Lu-er attempted to charge into the stone tower but was blocked firmly by the guards.

The Dragon Clan guard said in a solemn voice, “If the few of you keep causing trouble, don’t blame us for not being courteous anymore!”

The ones guarding the stone tower were all Empyrean powerhouses. Once they took action, Lu-er and the rest were naturally not a match.

Lu-er had a sorrowful face as she gritted her teeth and said, “I’m begging you guys, let me go in! Young Master didn’t come out for ten years! I’m going in to find him!”

Actually, for these ten years, Lu-er spent each day very tormentedly.

If not for Ye Yuan’s order, the agreement of ten years, she would have long charged into the Dragon Eye Cave.

But along with the passing of time, the ten-year date got closer and closer. The hopes of Ye Yuan coming out became bleaker and bleaker, she finally could not wait anymore.

It was just that the guard was cold as ice and did not bend the rules at all.

“What has us wanting to enter the Dragon Eye Cave got to do with you all? His Excellency isn’t coming out, then we’ll go in to find him!” Ning Tianping said angrily.

A figure appeared and said coolly, “He already died inside, you all don’t need to go in anymore!”

It was precisely Long Chi!

Lu-er looked at Long Chi hatefully, wishing to swallow him alive.

She knew that it was this person who sent Young Master into the hopeless land, Dragon Eye Cave.

“You’re spurting nonsense! It’s impossible for Young Master to die!” Lu-er screamed.

“Right, His Excellency is especially gifted; a peerless talent. He absolutely won’t be stumped by a puny little Dragon Eye Cave!” Ning Tianping also said with an indignant and resentful face.

Seeing the despaired looks of Lu-er and the rest, Long Chi was full of delight in his heart.

What he wanted was precisely such a result. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Heh heh, puny little Dragon Eye Cave? You guys have stayed here for ten years and probably haven’t truly understood what kind of place the Dragon Eye Cave is! That place seals countless abyss monsters. Each abyss monster is several times stronger than same rank humans. In there, what fills the air isn’t spiritual energy but devilish energy. One cannot cultivate inside the Dragon Eye Cave. Replenishment is extremely difficult. The divine essence expended will frequently not have enough time to be replenished and there will be abyss monsters rushing over again. How long do you all feel that he can live under this kind of environment? Honestly telling you guys, there was once a Heavenly Emperor who was relegated into the Dragon Eye Cave, and he never came out again!”

Long Chi said a lot in one breath, saying the brutality of the Dragon Eye Cave in its entirety.

The more they listened, the heavier the mood of Lu-er and the rest.

In the end, it was close to despairing.

They knew that Ye Yuan was formidable. But no matter how impressive the person, under this kind of environment, there would also come a time where their strength would be depleted.

Then, could Ye Yuan last ten years?

“You ... You’re talking nonsense! If not for you, Young Master also wouldn’t have entered the Dragon Eye Cave too! I ... I’ll fight it out with you!”

Lu-er was indignant and leaped up, it was as if space was frozen.

The others all had sorrowful and indignant faces. Inclusive of Loneswan, all of them rushed over toward Long Chi.

But, what kind of existence was Long Chi?

This level of attack was completely too weak to stand the competition in front of him.

“Snort!”

Long Chi did not move and just gave a cold snort. It was akin to a clap of thunder, striking everyone’s hearts.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

... ...

The few people spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood at the same time, figures flying out backward.

In front of a Heavenly Emperor, Empyreans were ants, let alone that they were just True God Realm?

“Overestimating your own ability! If not for that kid forcing this emperor to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath, you all would already be dead people now!” Long Chi said with a cold snort.

Long Chi had sullen anger on his face, but he was incomparably delighted in his heart.

Killing Lu-er they all was merely the effort of lifting a hand. They were merely ants to him.

But only seeing these people’s extremely grievous appearances, would he be in a great mood.

Lu-er clenched her teeth hard, her gaze icy-cold.

“Since that’s the case, then I’ll force you to act and kill me! Today, I’m going to perish together with you and avenge Young Master!”

Without the slightest hesitation, Lu-er rushed over toward Long Chi once more like a moth flying into the fire.

“Right, we’ll fight it out with you! Since you don’t dare to kill us, then we’ll force you to kill us!” Ning Tianping gave a cold cry and also rushed over.
