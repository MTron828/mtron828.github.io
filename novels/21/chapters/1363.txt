Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Sensing the gazes cast by several thousand people, Ye Yuan accepted it calmly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Competing in Martial Dao willpower was his forte. Obtaining this result did not exceed his expectations.

In reality, if he was willing, he could keep on sitting on the lotus seat.

Of course, even if he did not utilize the power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, it was also adequate to set the world on fire already.

He forcefully increased the middle-stage Grotto Profound’s record by eight days!

One had to know that although it was just a short eight days, the willpower’s intensity multiplied eight-fold.

Furthermore, it was even built on the foundation of the 40th day!

Although the two old men on the platform were surprised, they did not express too much either.

After all, only by making it through three rounds could one be considered an official Wu Meng Academy’s disciple.

No matter how good the first round’s results were, not passing at the end, it was pointless too.

“I didn’t expect that Jia Chong this guy was actually so formidable, taking down two of the Wu Meng Four Young Masters!” Xie Jingyi looked at the plaza, his face had a rarely-seen ugliness.

Ye Yuan was rather surprised as he said, “That one dressed in blue-colored robes?”

Xie Jingyi nodded and said, “He’s our Brilliant Peace City’s number genius, and also my love rival! I knew that he was very powerful, but I didn’t expect that he was actually so powerful!”

Talking up till here, Little Fatty could not help becoming somewhat dejected. The joy of successfully clearing the round was already replaced by decadence.

Seeing Xie Jingyi like this, Ye Yuan also could not help becoming curious just what kind of person was the Ah Xiu he talked about, to actually be able to move Brilliant Peace City’s number one genius.

But comparing Xie Jingyi to Jia Chong, the disparity was indeed not small.

This first round, he, Ye Yuan, was just a special case.

Under normal circumstances, the longer one persisted, the greater the potential, the more powerful the strength!

Ye Yuan patted Xie Jingyi’s shoulder and said with a smile, “Buck up then. Your potential might not be less than his! From the sixth day to the 30th day, did you dare to imagine it previously? Therefore, there’s no impossibility. Just depends on whether you dare to do it or not! But, if you’re eliminated, you can only fade into the crowd, the disparity with Jia Chong getting bigger and bigger! In that case, your Ah Xiu will probably get further and further away from you.”

Xie Jingyi’s entire body trembled, seemingly suffering some tremendous stimulation. Grimacing, he said, “Good brother, let’s buck up together for the two rounds at the back, and strive to both enter the Wu Meng Academy! We’re going to let those who look down on us trash see that rookies can counterattack too!”

Ye Yuan chuckled when he heard that. This guy’s joker problem indeed could not be fixed.

Finally, the first round, Qin Shao ranked first with the result of 53 days, obtaining 115 points. Su Yuecang took second place with 51 days, obtaining 105 points. Jia Chong ranked third, obtaining 100 points with the result of 50 days.

...

On the platform, an old man opened his mouth nonchalantly and said, “You all being able to pass the first round, it’s sufficient to prove your excellence and also enough to prove the resolution of your Martial Dao heart! However, Wu Meng Academy only recruits the most outstanding students! The first round is merely a warm-up. What’s harder is the second round and third round!”

The old man swept a glance over everyone and slowly said, “Right away, begin the second round, Earth Carnage!”

The moment the old man’s voice faded, this enormous plaza’s scene suddenly changed.

Originally, the million lotus seats disappeared, leaving only several thousand lotus seats.

Seeing this scene, everyone could not help clicking their tongues in wonder.

“Now, you all choose a lotus seat to seat at will! The second round, Earth Carnage, is all the same for each of you! The array formation activating, you all will enter a consciousness space! At that time, all of your strength will automatically be compensated to become grand completion Grotto Profound. You guys will be facing the assault of 50 waves of divine beasts! These divine beasts will be stronger wave after wave. Being able to make it through 20 waves is considered passing the test. Before 20 waves, if you die inside the consciousness space, you all will be transported right out, failing the test! Every additional round you survive, your points will increase by 10!” said the old man in a clear voice.

Hearing these words, everyone did not reveal much surprise.

Clearly, everyone was clear about the contents of the test.

Rather, for Ye Yuan, it was still his first time hearing the specific contents of this second round. For a moment, he felt that it was rather novel.

Automatically compensating for cultivation realm, this appeared very fair.

But very clearly, this level was not easy to pass.

What this level tested was a martial artist’s true combat power, without a trace of deception.

“Come on, I don’t wish to see you being transported out when I come out!” Ye Yuan said to Xie Jingyi with a smile.

“Pooh! You’re the one who will be transported out! I’m the man who’s going to marry Ah Xiu, how can I possibly lose?” Xie Jingyi retorted.

As soon as he was seated, Ye Yuan felt like his consciousness was being taken away from something.

When he appeared again, it was already inside an empty space.

This was a consciousness space. There was nothing at all.

Ye Yuan discovered that his realm really became grand completion Grotto Profound!

“Mm? This ... ”

Ye Yuan revolved his divine essence a bit and discovered to his dismay that his divine essence consumption speed was different from his actual situation!

“Looks like there’s no way to cheat,” Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile.

Considering Ye Yuan’s true realm, his divine essence was incomparably condensed.

Unleashing large-scale martial techniques, the divine essence consumption would also not be very great.

Under the impact of this wave after wave, the thickness of divine essence was very useful.

But unfortunately, he was just a wisp of consciousness right now. This body was configured by the grand array and not himself. He was unable to alter it too.

“Fortunately, the Voice of the Dragon God can still be used. But it can only be used at a crucial time.”

The Voice of the Dragon God was released with the power of the fleshy body, although this body was not as good as Ye Yuan’s fleshy body, it could still unleash the Voice of the Dragon God.

Except, he sensed it a bit that the Voice of the Dragon God could only unleash for around 10 breaths of time.

This was his final trump card and could not be used easily.

“Now, please choose your weapon!” At this time, an ethereal voice sounded out.

Ye Yuan said, “I choose the sword!”

A light flashed. Ye Yuan’s hands had a sword appear out of the blue. It was actually a spirit divine artifact!

“Looks like this test is very fair! Everyone’s starting point is identical! It will depend on the individual’s Martial Dao comprehensions and willpower!” Ye Yuan said to himself.

At this time, that ethereal voice sounded out once more, “The hour has arrived; Earth Carnage test begins!”

Following this voice landing, Ye Yuan discovered to his amazement that there were countless wild beasts ahead, rushing over towards him with an irresistible momentum.

These wild beasts virtually filled the entire space. There wasn’t even a place to escape at all!

These wild beasts were just the lowest-level initial-stage rank 1 divine beasts. It was just that the numbers were too terrifying.

“Heh, the first level was willpower assault. This second level is wild beast assault. Interesting!”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned stern, wielding the sword and pressed forward, directly charging into the beast horde!

The violent beast horde practically engulfed Ye Yuan right away.

Ye Yuan’s sword dance was airtight, shuttling back and forth inside the beast horde, continuously reaping the lives of wild beasts.
