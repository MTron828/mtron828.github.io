Chapter 2203: I Feel That You’ll Be Overwhelmed by It!

“A divine-grade Jadeheart Pill is simply a god-like medicinal pill! As long as there’s this one pill, your Uncle Lie will be able to 100% step into the Deity Realm that one even dreamed about! Four divine-grade Jadeheart Pills is equivalent to four divine rank powerhouses!”

Chen Yan had an agitated look, even reaching the point of fanaticism already.

He was now incomparably certain that the Chen Village picked up a treasure!

Before something happened to A’Ning, he was absolutely a Two-star Alchemy God!

No, it was Three-star!

Definitely a Three-star Alchemy God!

As for the even stronger Four-star Alchemy God, that already surpassed the scope of Chen Yan’s understanding. He did not even have the courage to think about it.

Even if he racked his brains, he would also not be able to imagine what kind of powerful alchemy supreme lord was that.

Ye Yuan scratched his head and said, “Looks like I’m not a good for nothing trash.”

Chen Yan laughed loudly and said, “Trash? This old man has never regarded you as trash! From that moment I saved you, I knew that you absolutely didn’t belong in a shallow pond!”

By the side, A’Xiu looked at Ye Yuan, blinking her eyes and saying with a look of idolization, “Hehe, I said it before, A’Ning is definitely not an ordinary person!”

The villages were still in the midst of shock, they were stunned silly by Chen Yan’s ‘four divine rank powerhouses’.

“My God, four divine rank powerhouses! I didn’t hear wrongly, right?”

“Then wouldn’t our Chen Village become the strongest village in the radius of ten thousand miles?”

“This A’Ning truly can’t be judged by his appearance! I didn’t expect that he’s actually an Alchemy God in hiding!”

... ...

At this time, how could the villagers still remember the mocking from before?

The few words ‘four divine rank powerhouses’ seemed to have magical power, making everyone change their tones immediately.

A Divine Realm powerhouse was the realm that every hunter in the village yearned for.

But to this day, a divine rank powerhouse had never appeared in the village before.

To mortals, taking this step was far too difficult!

It could not be realized throughout their entire lives too.

But Ye Yuan casually drew with his hands and magicked out four divine rank powerhouses, how formidable was this!

Chen Yong was incredibly embarrassed at one side.

Seeing A’Xiu’s besotted appearance, the vat of vinegar in his heart was instantly knocked over again.

“Humph! What’s impressive about it! I can also cultivate to the Deity Realm by cultivating myself!”

He thought so in his heart, but his eyes still flitted towards the Jadeheart Pills without putting up a fight.

As for Chen Lie and Chen Jian, their eyes had never left the Jadeheart Pills before. Their bodies even agitated until it was quivering.

That was Deity Realm!

Chen Yan was experienced with age in the end and was the first to recover from the shock.

He coughed dryly twice and called everyone’s souls back, and slowly said, “Chen Lie, Chen Jian, the two of you each get a divine-grade Jadeheart Pill and immediately enter closed-seclusion. You must break through to the Deity Realm before tomorrow!”

“Yes, Uncle Yan!” The two people were wildly ecstatic and carefully received the medicinal pill from Chen Yan’s hands, and they left with large strides.

Chen Yan carefully put away the two remaining Jadeheart Pills and said to Chen Yong and A’Xiu, “A’Yong, A’Xiu, these two medicinal pills are saved for you! From today onwards, you have to cultivate diligently and reach the peak mortal realm as soon as possible!”

A’Yong finally let out a sigh and said with cupped fists, “Yes, Grandpa Yan!”

When he said this, he could not resist secretly sneaking a peek at Ye Yuan and discovered that the other party was absorbed in thought, and he could not help secretly heaving a sigh in relief.

Fortunately, this guy did not haggle over things. Otherwise, if he taunted a few words, his face would have nowhere to go.

Especially that it was in front of A’Xiu.

“Grandpa, this isn’t far! The medicinal pills were refined by A’Ning. Why isn’t one left for him?” A’Xiu said unhappily.

Chen Yan smiled bitterly and said, “It is not that grandpa is taking advantage of A’Ning, but even if this medicinal pill was consumed by him, it also won’t have the least bit of use.”

A’Xiu was puzzled and asked, “This is a divine pill. How can that be possible?”

Chen Yan said, “A’Ning suffered heavy injuries. Spiritual energy can’t be stored in his body at all. Even if he eats this spirit medicine, it will also be all in vain in the end.”

A’Xiu still wanted to say something, but he heard Ye Yuan smile and said, “A’Xiu, it was you and Grandpa Yan who saved me. You taking this medicinal pill is ought to be too. Uh ... perhaps I can refine even more incredible medicinal pills in the future?”

The moment these words came out, Chen Yan’s two eyes shone!

Goodness!

Why didn’t I think of this?

After Chen Lie and Chen Jian broke through to the Deity Realm, getting divine rank spirit medicines would become much easier.

At that time ...

Thinking up to here, Chen Yan was virtually losing control of the feverishness in his heart!

Maybe he had hopes of breaking through to the Deity Realm too!

“Uncle Yan, things are bad! Luo Sheng brought the Luo Village’s people and came to collect taxes in advance!”

Everyone was currently immersed in their fantasy when someone suddenly came to report, shattering all the fantasies to pieces at once.

No one thought that Luo Sheng actually came so quickly!

Chen Lie and Chen Jian two people were definitely already in closed-seclusion right now and could not be interrupted.

If Luo Sheng discovered that Jadeheart Pills, the Chen Village would likely face a catastrophic disaster! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In this county area, there was no justice to talk about.

Whoever’s fist was larger, whoever was the law.

Luo Sheng was the sole Deity Realm powerhouse in the radius of ten thousand miles, his words were the imperial edict.

Furthermore, it was absolutely impossible for Luo Sheng to passively watch the Chen Village grow.

Chen Yan’s face fell and he said, “Everybody, follow me. The matter of the Jadeheart Pills absolutely can’t be divulged! Each and every one of you put away your expressions and pretend like there’s nothing. Once the slightest hint is divulged, everyone will have to die, understand?”

Everyone’s faces turned austere, nodding their heads one after another.

Chen Yan chased the villagers out, found a hidden area, and put away the two Jadeheart Pills before following out.

... ...

Chen Yan led everyone out of the village. They saw a middle-aged man in brocade opposite of them had unparalleled martial prowess.

A large contingent of troops was brought along behind him, the soldiers being strong and the horses sturdy.

Just the grand completion mortal realm powerhouses were more than ten people!

Chen Yan did not say a word and directly knelt down toward Luo Sheng who was riding on a horse.

“Chen Village’s Chen Yan, leads the villagers to offer greetings to divine being, Lord Luo!”

With him kneeling, the rest knelt down one after another and called out, “Offering greetings to divine being Lord Luo!”

In the eyes of these mortal realms, Deity Realm was an invincible existence, being addressed respectfully as ‘divine being’.

And in Luo Sheng’s eyes, these villagers were all ants. Seeing him, they had to kneel down.

Otherwise, it was death!

Suddenly, Luo Sheng’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold snort, “Boy, who are you! Why didn’t you kneel seeing this god?”

Chen Yan turned around and discovered that Ye Yuan was currently standing there blankly with his brows furrowed, deep in thought, and could not help being scared out of his wits.

How could this boy be dumb at the critical juncture?

When Ye Yuan saw everyone kneel, his brows knitted together instinctively.

No idea why, he did not want to kneel toward this person!

At the thought of wanting to kneel, every pore on Ye Yuan’s body was resisting.

This was the pride that stemmed from his bones, even if he lost his memories, he could not be wiped away too.

A mere Grotto Profound, only just entered Divine Dao, what qualifications did he have to make the exalted Second Sage kneel?

The exalted Second Sage, that was the figure standing at the very summit of this Heavenspan World!

Could he, Luo Sheng, accept a kneel from the Second Sage?

Ye Yuan was absorbed in thought as he looked at Luo Sheng. Suddenly, he said with a serious face, “Uh ... I feel that you’ll be overwhelmed by it!”
