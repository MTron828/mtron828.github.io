Chapter 2092: Heaven-Rank Secret Order

Initial-stage Third Firmament Empyrean!

Middle-stage Third Firmament Empyrean!

Late-stage Third Firmament Empyrean!

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s aura increased steadily, directly breaking through the fetters of Second Firmament Empyrean, reaching peak Third Firmament Empyrean.

And this was not over!

Her aura was still rising, heading straight for Fourth Firmament Empyrean.

The realm that originally needed year after year before she could break through was actually not the slightest bit stagnant at this moment.

However, those Ice Cloud Tower disciples were all sucked into dry corpses, the method extremely cruel.

Even when Yang Fei-er saw this scene, her face also turned pale.

These junior apprentice sisters and martial nieces that had lived with her for many years passed away just like that, without even a trace of strength to resist.

She could not help looking toward Ye Yuan. If not for this man, she would probably also be the same as them now, right?

The other Empyreans also stared at Empyrean Ice Cloud in immense shock, being stunned by this scene.

No one could have thought that she actually concealed such means.

It turned out that Empyrean Ice Cloud was the ambitious schemer hidden among them.

Ye Yuan’s sudden appearance clearly disrupted Empyrean Ice Cloud’s plans.

Otherwise, come one day in the future, when Empyrean Ice Cloud devoured all of her disciples in one go, she would likely be able to directly become the extreme north’s number one person!

Even if Empyrean Vast Wind came, he might not be able to suppress her too.

At the thought of this, everyone was horrified.

To be able to use such cruel means to equip herself, the Northernmost Steppe would probably immediately be plunged into darkness under this woman’s rule.

In virtually an instant, Empyrean Ice Cloud’s aura rose to Fifth Firmament Empyrean!

Empyrean Vast Wind not moving out, there were really few existences that could be found in this land of extreme north that could do anything to her.

Even Empyrean Windlike was weaker than her.

Empyrean Ice Cloud stood in the air, her white fairy dress fluttering away. Glaring at Ye Yuan, she said ferociously, “Brat, you forced my hand! The two of our debts have to be squared!”

Finished talking, Empyrean Ice Cloud took a step out and directly concealed inside the void.

The other people were all dumbfounded and tongue-tied, gazes casting toward Ye Yuan one after another.

They were afraid, afraid that Ye Yuan would use the Heaven Shocking Lightning on them.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed and similarly took a step out, entering the void.

Seeing Ye Yuan left, everyone all heaved a long sigh in relief.

Finally sent this plague god away!

“Brother Windlike, this ...” Empyrean Redfeather said with a hesitant look.

Empyrean Windlike gave a cold snort and said, “This matter isn’t over so easily! Humph! After he uses that Heaven Shocking Lightning, I want to see what methods he still has to be cocky with us! Tianyang’s matter, I’m afraid that Big Brother already knows. At this time, he is probably already on the way.”

Perhaps feeling being at the mercy of a True God earlier was overly humiliating, he was a little loud when speaking. Everyone present could hear it clearly.

Empyrean Redfeather and the rest nodded slightly, clearly having long predicted that this matter would not be left at this.

Feng Tianyang was too monstrous, but such a monster died at Jiu Luo Ji. If there was no explanation for this matter, Empyrean Vast Wind would probably turn the entire Northernmost Steppe upside down.

... ...

A little while ago, inside a dark space of Vast Wind Assemble, a stalwart figure was currently sitting down cross-legged.

Behind him, several colored lanterns were suspended in the air.

These were all the lifeblood soul lamps of the Vast Wind Assemble’s important people.

Suddenly, one of the colored lanterns gave off an intense tremor, then shattered with a crack.

That big and tall figure suddenly opened both eyes, his gaze cold and gloomy, like a bottomless abyss.

“This Empyrean gave Tianyang several life-preserving divine abilities. Even when facing Empyrean powerhouses, he should be able to escape with his life! Furthermore, there’s Windlike accompanying him on this trip. So who could kill Tianyang in front of Windlike?”

Empyrean Vast Wind’s brows were tightly knitted, full of puzzlement.

He regarded Feng Tianyang extremely highly. Although he normally trained Feng Tianyang a lot, he also gave Feng Tianyang quite a lot of life-preserving divine abilities.

With these divine abilities around, even if facing an Empyrean powerhouse and Feng Tianyang could not beat him, he could still escape with his life.

For so many years, those divine abilities also let Feng Tianyang tide over perilous situations, turning dangers into safety time after time.

Let alone that this time was just marrying a girl. Furthermore, there was also Empyrean Windlike accompanying him.

In Empyrean Vast Wind’s view, there was no danger at all.

Yet, this time, Feng Tianyang died! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This son that he pinned high hopes on was dead!

Empyrean Vast Wind did not know that Feng Tianyang did not have time to use life-preserving divine abilities at all and was directly killed by Ye Yuan’s Sword Hollow Etch.

Having lived for no idea how many tens of thousands of years, Empyrean Vast Wind had long already cultivated until he had no joy nor sorrow.

It was just that currently at his glabella, that thunderous rage hidden in the depths of his heart could be seen.

“Humph! No matter who it is, to dare kill Tianyang, even if this Empyrean goes up to the ninth heaven and below the earth, I’ll also tear you to pieces! Not pulling your divine soul out and refining it for 100 thousand years, it will be hard to dispel the hatred in this Empyrean’s heart.”

Finished saying, Empyrean Vast Wind pointed at the void. Several dozen streams of light directly tore through the void and left.

After 15 minutes, Vast Wind Assemble was in an uproar.

Several dozen powerful auras gathered in the sky above Vast Wind Assemble, virtually making the entire territory asphyxiated.

“Isn’t that Ling Yu Assemble’s Empyrean Shen Luo? That’s a Fifth Firmament Empyrean super powerhouse! Why would he appear here?”

“Also, that’s Hedong Assemble’s Empyrean Shi Mie!”

“That’s Ironwood Assemble’s Empyrean Ge Yun!”

“What in the world is happening, practically half of the Northernmost Steppe’s Empyrean powerhouses have gathered at our here.”

... ...

In Vast Wind Assemble, people who had the knowledge noticed that all of these Empyreans that normally did not show themselves to the public were now there.

Each one of them was a super powerhouse whose names shook a region.

But now, all of them were gathered in Vast Wind Assemble.

Even a fool also knew that something big was about to happen.

Empyrean Shen Luo was in front and said to Empyrean Vast Wind with clasped hands, “Brother Vast Wind, I wonder what happened? You actually want to use the heaven-rank secret order? The last time it was used, it was when the demon race’s nine great sovereigns arrived together!”

The other Empyreans also had blank faces, not knowing what happened.

This heaven-rank secret order was the secret order that Empyrean Vast Wind commanded the extreme north with.

Normally, not reaching a life and death juncture, it would not be used.

Now, they received the heaven-rank secret order under the circumstances where they did not receive any danger alerts.

Empyrean Vast Wind had a calm expression, devoid of joy and sorrow as he opened his mouth and said coolly, “Wait, there are still a few that haven’t arrived.”

The other Empyreans exchanged glances, but no one dared to say anything.

Empyrean Vast Wind’s prestige was not established through words but carved out with real swords and spears.

People should not look at how these Empyreans were all powerful. In reality, they were very fearful of Empyrean Vast Wind.

Before long, the void trembled and three figures slowly stepped out.

When the Empyreans saw this scene, their pupils could not help constricting.

“Empyrean Tian Jue!”

“Empyrean Mie Yu!”

“Empyrean Zhen Huang!”

“These three are all existences that aren’t weaker than Empyrean Vast Wind! They actually came too! Looks like something big is really going to happen.”
