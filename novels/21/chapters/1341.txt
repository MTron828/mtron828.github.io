Chapter 1345: Sold Out

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Yang Rui gave Ye Yuan a profound glance and found that Ye Yuan was currently looking at him with a smile.

He was startled inwardly and understood very quickly why Ye Yuan did it.

This boy has such meticulous thoughts. Gifting pill formula, this move is simply beautiful to the extreme! Yang Rui praised Ye Yuan in his heart.

Even Yang Rui could discern the significance of this pill formula, so how could the others not perceive it?

Once this Essence Cultivating Pill spread out, it would definitely be like a plague, spreading throughout the entire Heavenspan World.

That way, the Essence Cultivating Pill was not only not a good thing to Ye Yuan, but it also became a hot potato instead.

So much so that it would invite a fatal disaster.

But, if the Myriad Treasure Tower possessed the Essence Cultivating Pill’s pill formula, it was completely different.

The Myriad Treasure Tower was Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s business. People who dared to have ideas on his business were really not many.

Even those true powerhouses would not find trouble with Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure because of a measly little Tier 1 middle-grade pill formula either.

This first point was Ye Yuan’s wise and discreet self-preserving move.

The second point, just as Ye Yuan said himself, it was in order to repay the kindness.

It was just that this big gift was a little too heavy.

Once the Essence Cultivating Pill is released, the Myriad Treasure Tower would definitely be able to sweep across Jewelhill City like crushing dead leaves.

And Yang Rui contributing the pill formula to the Myriad Treasure Tower would definitely obtain the upper echelons’ substantial rewards.

This favor could not be said to not be big!

Of course, Yang Rui understood that if it was in order to keep discreetly out of harm’s way, Ye Yuan could completely not take this pill formula out.

As long as he did not take it out, everything had nothing to do with Ye Yuan.

This way, it was sufficient to see that Ye Yuan was someone who valued relationships greatly.

He only took out such a bombshell in order to save the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Yang Rui sucked in a deep breath and said, “Younger Brother Ye, I understand! In the future, we’ll address each other as brothers. This favor, Elder Brother, I, received it!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then I’ll be haughty and call Brother Yang. Brother Yang, this Essence Cultivating Pill’s refinement is rather difficult. If Elder Song has any areas he doesn’t understand, you can have him come find me.”

Yang Rui nodded and said, “Okay, no problem.”

Elder Song was the new One-star Alchemy God that upstairs sent.

It was just that after he came, it did not change the Myriad Treasure Tower’s predicament at all.

...

“F*ck me, came late again! You bunch of animals, it’s also too early, right?”

“The Myriad Treasure Tower is going to release another batch of Essence Cultivating Pill today. Not coming earlier, can’t even drink a mouthful of soup.”

“Damn it, I’ll give you 50 divine essence stones, you give your place to me, how’s that?”

“Screw off! Want to buy my place with just 50 divine essence stones? 500, not a single piece fewer! Furthermore, after you buy the Essence Cultivating Pill, you must share with me one, I’ll buy at the original price!”

“Go to hell, you!”

...

As soon as the Essence Cultivating Pill rolled out, it was immediately like a tornado, instantly sweeping across the entire Jewelhill City. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The Myriad Treasure Tower’s door was almost burst open.

Ye Yuan made use of that half a month’s time and refined a large batch of Essence Cultivating Pills.

The rest, he did not care.

In operations, Yang Rui and Su Linpu were clearly much more experienced than him.

The two people formulated a series of promotion tricks, recruiting three groups of martial artists outside to test the pill for free.

In the first batch, quite a number of people harbored doubtful attitudes. Those who really came to test the pill were not many.

But it was precisely after this first batch of people tested the pill, the Essence Cultivating Pill’s reputation blew up in one go!

The Essence Cultivating Pill was a brand new kind of medicinal pill. Consuming this medicinal pill the first time, the effects were the most apparent.

Even though everyone doubted the Essence Cultivating Pill’s medicinal effects, the people who paid attention were a lot.

After all, the Myriad Treasure Tower already let out the big talk.

But after the few people testing the pill consumed the Essence Cultivating Pill, the results were immediate, their auras surging immensely on the spot.

This kind of effect was absolutely what the Essence Increasing Pill could not attain.

The people who tested the pills were like having picked up a treasure, all incomparably excited.

With this, it stirred up everyone’s appetite.

Hence, the slots for the second batch and third batch of pill testing, everyone went crazy.

Someone auctioned it off at a high price when they obtained the slot to test the pills.

It was said that the highest price was auctioned at 10 thousand pieces of low-grade divine essence stones!

After three batches of pill testing, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s sales immediately became explosive to the max.

A never-before explosive!

Same price, but medicinal effect was double of the Essence Increasing Pill, who would still go and buy the Essence Increasing Pill?

Hence, not just the Wang Family, inside the Lu Family and Lin Family’s shops, it virtually became completely deserted overnight.

Wang Family, everyone all became ants on a hot pan, all going in circles anxiously.

“Elder Xuan, didn’t you say that it was absolutely impossible for the Essence Cultivating Pill to exist? Now, we don’t have any response measures at all, and are very passive!” Wang Su grumbled.

Wang Xuanfeng’s face was also very ugly. Of course, even more, it was an embarrassment.

He said with certainty previously, declaring that it was absolutely impossible for the Myriad Treasure Tower to refine whatever Essence Cultivating Pill.

Now, this face was smacked resoundingly loud!

In reality, Wang Su knew that even if the Wang Family responded in advance, facing the Essence Cultivating Pill’s powerful offensive, they were still at a complete loss as to what to do.

“This can’t blame me either! Do you all know what this Essence Cultivating Pill’s appearance means?” Wang Xuanfeng said.

“It means that our Jewelhill City’s branch family can’t hold on anymore!” Wang Su said crossly

These few decades, in order to challenge the Myriad Treasure Tower, the Wang Family’s expenditures were tremendous too.

They were originally planning on dominating Jewelhill City after exhausting the Myriad Treasure Tower to death.

But they did not expect that they did not exhaust the Myriad Treasure Tower to death, but instead, let the Myriad Treasure Tower deal a head-on blow!

This blow was too vicious. It might directly smack them to death.

Wang Xuanfeng smiled coldly and said, “Foolish! Wang Su, your horizons are too shallow! How can you take on major responsibilities in the future? In my view, this Essence Cultivating Pill’s appearance is going to affect the entire Heavenspan World! Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure will make use of this medicinal pill to amass countless riches!”

Wang Su smiled coldly and said, “Heh, Elder Su, do you think I haven’t considered this point? It’s just, do you feel that that boy named Ye Yuan will hand over the pill formula? This pill formula’s value simply can’t be estimated! Facing such huge profits, who would easily spit it out?”

Wang Xuanfeng froze. He did not think of this layer.

Wang Su looked at Wang Xuanfeng and continued: “Therefore, this kid is digging his own grave! Don’t look at how they are rejoicing right now. Before long, that boy and the Myriad Treasure Tower will definitely lose all decorum! When the time comes, heh heh!”

Hearing Wang Su’s analysis made Wang Xuanfeng and the rest kindle hope once more.

Wang Yuxiang said, “Then Sir Su’s meaning is ... we continue to hold, hold until they fall out?”

Wang Su nodded his head and said, “That’s right!”

Wang Yuxiang’s expression was ugly as he said, “But our Jewelhill City’s branch family can’t compete with the Myriad Treasure Tower’s vast wealth after all. These few years, we’ve already depleted all of our resources. Continuing to stall, I’m afraid that the Myriad Treasure Tower hasn’t fallen, and our Wang Family will collapse first!”

Wang Su had stayed in Jewelhill City for several decades and naturally had an understanding of the Wang Family’s financial resources.

He thought about it and said, “These two days, I’ll ask for help from the main family, have them support Jewelhill City’s branch family! The war is already fought until now, just see who can last longer!”
