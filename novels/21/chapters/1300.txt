Chapter 1304: Guest Alchemist!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The grades of divine pills were not identical to mortal-grade medicinal pills.

Above superior-grade was heaven-grade, and above heaven-grade was divine-grade!

Just take the Divine Essence Pill for instance; refining an ordinary low-grade Divine Essence Pill could match a month’s bitter cultivation.

Reaching high-grade, it could match a year of bitter cultivation.

While divine-grade was sufficient to match ten years of bitter cultivation!

Ten years of bitter cultivation was nothing in the cultivation of this Deity Realm.

But the grades below divine-grade, if a person kept on taking them, the medicinal effects would continue to weaken.

But divine-grade would not!

This was also to say that if you could refine enough divine-grade Divine Essence Pills, your cultivation speed could reach ten times, a hundred times, even a thousand times of others!

This way, the ordinary to the extreme Divine Essence Pill became extremely extraordinary.

However, mortal-grade transcendent-grade medicinal pills were not worth mentioning at all in front of divine-grade Divine Essence Pills.

It could not even compare to heaven-grade!

And in the various major shops, they would never sell heaven-grade Divine Essence Pills.

As for divine-grade, that was just a grade in the legends.

Therefore, even though Ye Yuan refined a superior-grade Divine Essence Pill, Dustless was still pessimistic about him.

Divine Essence Pill was just a kind of basic medicinal pill. It was still far from the One Star Heavenly Mark Pill!

One Star Heavenly Mark Pill was a divine pill even harder to refine than the Profound Essence Pill!

In this regard, it was very in-line with Ye Yuan’s cultivation mentality.

That was that the foundation must be solidified!

Refining the Divine Essence Pill to divine essence was precisely in order to solidify the foundation.

...

“Sir Ye, you finally exited seclusion! The last time you gave Hong Yin quite a few high-grade Divine Essence Pills, it gave Hong Yin a fright! I wonder this time, will Sir Ye give Hong Yin a pleasant surprise once again?”

When Hong Yin saw that Ye Yuan came out, she went forward to greet him with a wide grin, cracking a joke with him.

Interacting a few times, Ye Yuan also became much more familiar with Hong Yin, especially after limitlessly providing Ye Yuan spirit medicines and divine essence stones.

Recently, these few days, Ye Yuan exhausted large quantities of spirit medicines and divine essence stones. Even Hong Yin felt a bit overwhelmed too.

Especially in the last two days, there were already quite a few people gossiping.

Fortunately, after Manager Su knew about this matter, not only did he not blame her, he notified the warehouse side instead. Only then did it suppress those gossips.

However, if Ye Yuan really only ate and not vomited, it would make things difficult for her.

Hong Yin was also wagering, she was eying on Ye Yuan’s potential!

If she could attract a future alchemy genius for the Myriad Treasure Tower, her position in the Myriad Treasure Tower would rise like the boat rising with the tide.

Ye Yuan had read countless people, how could he not perceive that hint of nervousness in the depths of Hong Yin’s eyes?

“I wonder if this is considered a pleasant surprise or not?”

Ye Yuan placed the superior-grade Divine Essence Pill in front of Hong Yin with a smile.

Hong Yin’s pupils constricted, her eyes full of incredulity.

“Sir Ye, this ... this ... is too amazing!” Hong Yin was agitated until she was almost incoherent.

No matter what grade of divine pill, the raw materials required were all the same.

Hence, the higher the grade, the higher the added value of the medicinal pill. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Similarly, materials worth 10 pieces of low-grade divine essence stones, once it reached superior-grade, then it was worth 500 low-grade divine essence stones.

This was a 50-fold increment!

How could Hong Yin expect that Ye Yuan actually refined a superior-grade Divine Essence Pill so quickly?

Ye Yuan smiled and handed a storage ring to Hong Yin, saying with a smile, “The fruits in this period of time are all here. The Divine Essence Pill is useless to me, I didn’t take a single one, it’s all for the Myriad Treasure Tower.”

Hong Yin received the storage ring and examined, and was immediately stunned.

Inside the storage ring, there were actually quite a dozen Divine Essence Pills. Furthermore, among them, 60% and above were high-grade, only 40% was low-grade.

She looked at Ye Yuan like she saw a ghost, her eyes filled with astonishment.

Previously, backtracking from Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills, Hong Yin estimated that Ye Yuan’s pill refinement success rate was around 30%-40%.

Truthfully speaking, it was already rather high!

But now, Ye Yuan’s success rate was actually as high as 70%!

This kind of success rate could be rated as frightening!

Even Manager Su probably could not reach such a terrifying success rate either.

“S-Sir Ye, you wait a moment, I have to report this matter to Manager Su! The pleasant surprise that you gave me was seriously a little too huge.”

Hong Yin said and disappeared with a whoosh.

Ye Yuan smiled and found a place himself to sit down.

With Ye Yuan’s personality, he did not like to be so high-profile. But if he did not reveal some strength, it was impossible for him to receive the Myriad Treasure Tower’s high regard.

What he had to face currently was the powerful Liang Family. Furthermore, his divine sea was damaged. If he did not find a backstage supporter, it was very hard to beat the Liang Family.

And the Myriad Treasure Tower was clearly the best supporter.

He believed that it was impossible for the Myriad Treasure Tower’s upper echelons to sit by idly and remain indifferent towards such a rising alchemy new star.

Ye Yuan was clear about this in his heart; his improvement in this period of time, even Dustless was dumbfounded. It was impossible for the Myriad Treasure Tower to remain indifferent.

One superior-grade Divine Essence Pill was enough!

...

“You’re saying that youth called Ye Yuan refined a superior-grade Divine Essence Pill with Formation Dao Pill Refinement?”

A man in opulent clothing was also shocked when he heard Manager Su’s report.

Manager Su nodded and said, “With this old man’s experience, it absolutely won’t be wrong! From the divine essence stones as well as the amount of spirit medicines that he consumed, it’s not hard to determine, these Divine Essence Pills all originated from the Lesser Divine Essence Formation!”

The man in fine clothing mused for a moment and said, “If this is really the case, our Myriad Treasure Tower is in a favorable position. Investigated the background clearly?”

Myriad Treasure Tower said, “Investigated clearly, he was saved by the Liang Family’s eldest miss in the wilderness, his origins unknown ... Now, the Liang Family seems to be hostile and wanted to harm him. That’s why he would hide in our Myriad Treasure Tower and not dare to go out.”

Manager Su rattled on, he actually already turned Ye Yuan inside out.

The man in fine clothing was slightly surprised as he said, “In that case, he had the intention of exposing his alchemy talent to us and seeking our protection?”

Manager Su said with a smile, “Looking at it now, it seems so!”

The man in fine clothing mused briefly and seemed to be muttering to himself, “According to what you all said, this boy has clearly just came into contact with alchemy not long. Such talent is truly terrifying, his future prospects are bound to be limitless! This kind of talent, once learned by Jewelhill City’s other forces, he’ll surely be seized openly! Unless we kill him now, otherwise, it’s establishing a strong enemy for ourselves! We have no reason to refuse! Manager Su, you come forward on behalf of this tower lord and hire Ye Yuan to be the Myriad Treasure Tower’s guest alchemist. All of the expenses that his pill refinement needs, count it all in my Myriad Treasure Tower’s books. Also, he’s completely without the power to protect himself right now, send Luo Jian to protect him.”

Manager Su bowed and said, “Tower Lord is wise!”

Manager Su knew that Tower Lord Yang Rui was a person with tremendous foresight, and could definitely see Ye Yuan’s potential.

Yang Rui scolded laughingly, “You old punk, stop sucking up! Oh, right, Hong Yin did very well this time, promote her a grade and bestow her a heaven-grade Divine Essence Pill.”

Manager Su said smilingly, “Then this old man will thank Tower Lord on behalf of Hong Yin.”
