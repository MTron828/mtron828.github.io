Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“How is this possible? He actually escaped!”

“Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art can easily annihilate even Deva Realm powerhouses, he actually escaped!”

“Who is this kid? How can he grasp such formidable spatial law?”

... ...

When the divine race powerhouses saw this scene, each and every one of them stared dumbfoundedly, disbelieving faces.

Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art was a spatial spell that a progenitor of the divine race created. Its power was unparalleled.

With 36 thousand people casting the spell at the same time, it could produce a catalyzing effect, pushing the spatial law power to the level of source.

One had to know, this was one of the supreme laws, spatial law.

Reaching the level of source, what kind of horrifying power was that?

But this young man in front of them actually dodged it.

And at this time, a wisp of fresh blood was left behind at the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

Even though he avoided all of the attacks, the powerful energy explosion still injured him.

“Well-deserving of being a source-level spell. Indeed, rather interesting!”

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth smiled faintly, his figure moving, rushing toward the starry web once again.

“Humph! Reckless and blind thing, you want to pry into the profound mysteries of the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art? Then pay with your life as the price!” Yuan Zhen looked at that figure and said with a cold smile.

He was one of the 12 hubs of the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art and could mobilize the power of 3000 spaces, attacking the opponent.

Of course, he had another identity. He was one of the Profound Lineage’s nine elders!

Earlier, Ye Yuan escaped alive from under his hands. This made him feel very ashamed.

He also saw through that Ye Yuan was attempting to find the weakness of the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art, trying to burst out of here.

Toward this sort of ridiculous behavior, he naturally scoffed in derision.

It was only to see the spells in his hands continue moving. Terrifying Dao marks instantly ignited the space.

In an instant, several thousand stars lit up, and an even more terrifying spatial attack greeted Ye Yuan.

Bang, bang, bang ...

The thunderous explosions flickered incessantly in the void, like fireworks going off, beautiful to the extreme.

It was just that behind this beauty concealed terrifying murderous intent!

“Heh heh, Extreme Space Annihilation this move is a spatial attack with no dead angles! No matter how formidable your means, you’ll die without a doubt too!” Yuan Zhen let out a cold laugh.

“Haha, well done, Lord Yuan Zhen!”

“Lord Yuan Zhen is well-deserving of being one of the nine elders, impressive!”

“Lord Yuan Zhen’s Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art is really becoming more and more complex!”

... ...

Above the void, the praises of a group of divine race members came over.

Killing a human with meager strength was not worth mentioning, but this Extreme Space Annihilation could not be executed casually.

Under this move, even Deva Realm powerhouses would also turn to ashes!

“You guys, quickly look! That kid didn’t die! He ... He retreated again!”

Suddenly, someone cried out in surprise.

Everyone looked over and discovered that Ye Yuan was actually standing in the same place perfectly fine again since no idea when. It was as if nothing had happened.

Yuan Zhen’s expression changed drastically, and he exclaimed, “This is impossible! Under Extreme Space Annihilation, how can he possibly escape? No, wait! He didn’t avoid it completely, he got injured!”

He did not see it wrongly. Ye Yuan was really injured. Furthermore, the injuries were not light.

Extreme Space Annihilation was too strong. Ye Yuan unleashed all of his abilities and still did not avoid it completely.

One had to know, this spell was at the level of source. Its power was unimaginable.

If not for Ye Yuan being proficient in spatial law, even if a Deva Realm powerhouse came, he would also have to die nursing a grievance!

It was already extremely impressive for Ye Yuan to be able to escape alive.

The current Ye Yuan was very wretched, coughing up blood in his mouth non-stop, already being severely injured.

But this clearly did not stump Ye Yuan. He started refining pills to heal his injuries.

Except, continuously shooting the Limitless God Killing Bow previously made him expend a large number of rank eight spirit medicines. He did not have many spirit medicines left at present.

Rank eight spirit medicines were not cabbages, each one was extremely precious.

If not for Ye Yuan ransacking the Hidden Lineage, it would have been impossible to obtain so many rank eight spirit medicines this time too.

But even so, he did not have many ranks eight spirit medicines left on him.

After Ye Yuan consumed the rank eight divine pill and recovered from his injuries, he challenged the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art again!

This time, he did not charge from Yuan Zhen here but charged from other hubs.

Without the slightest surprise, Ye Yuan was seriously wounded again.

Feeling the terrifying undulations coming from the void, Ji Mo and the rest palpitated with anxiety and fear.

These undulations were too terrifying!

If it were them, god knows how many would have died already.

Each time Ye Yuan ventured into the starry web, they were extremely worried, fearful that something would happen to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was currently the hope of all humans. If he died, it would basically sentence them to death.

Being infected by Ye Yuan, the human powerhouses all dashed ahead regardless of their safety, desperately resisting the divine race army.

“Second Sage is dancing on the edge of the blade for us! We must protect him well!”

“Kill, kill, kill! Fight it out with this bunch of monsters!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Second Sage said before, he’ll definitely bring us out! Even if I die, I also won’t let this bunch of monsters charge over!”

... ...

Without Ye Yuan, the divine race army staged a comeback again.

It was just that this time, it was much more taxing on the humans.

Behind them was Ye Yuan, they could not give way!

Hence, they could only toughen their scalps and fight to the death!

If someone in the front died, the back would continue replacing.

Each and every one of them was undaunted and did not fear death, frenziedly resisting the divine race’s assault, refusing to take half a step back.

The divine race powerhouses were all visibly moved, the combat power of the humans in their eyes was infinitely magnified, they were actually unable to enter.

Very soon, the spirit medicines on Ye Yuan were depleted.

But he still attacked the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art again and again.

The injuries on his body got more and more severe, but he kept failing to find a breakthrough point.

“Haha ... Conceited and ignorant brat, so what even if you know spatial law? Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art is a source-level spell. No matter how you rack your brain, you can forget about escaping! Wait for death obediently!” Yuan Zhen laughed loudly and said.

“Reckless and blind thing, see how long you can still persist!”

“Lowly human, your fate can only be death! Fool, you’re a mantis trying to stop a chariot!”

... ...

Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art was a super spell that was jointly cast by more than 30 thousand people. Ye Yuan was equivalent to facing 26 people by himself, what kind of difficulty was that?

But he proceeded without hesitation!

He attacked the starry web again and again, and the injuries on his body worsened again and again.

He was covered in blood all over, his body already reaching its limit.

But he was still persevering!

Above the starry sky, waves of snickering came over, mocking him for overestimating his own ability.

But Ye Yuan did not care.

He said before, to bring these human powerhouses out, then he would definitely bring these people out!

“Kid, you come and challenge again if you have the capability! Next time, I’ll definitely make sure that you don’t make it back!”

Yuan Zhen’s wild laughter came from above the void.

Ye Yuan had already gone to and fro a hundred times, but they were not able to kill Ye Yuan all along.

This in itself was a disgrace to them!

In Ye Yuan’s current situation, if he challenged again, he would definitely die without a doubt!

Swoosh!

Yuan Zhen’s voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly disappeared from where he stood.

He rushed the starry web once more!
