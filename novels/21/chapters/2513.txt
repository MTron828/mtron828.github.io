Chapter 2519: Pulling up Mountain With Strength, Unparalleled Imposing Aura!

Boom!

A loud noise came over. The Heart of Heavenspan directly fused into the Heavenspan Mountain.

In the next moment, the earth quaked and mountains shook!

Rumble?…

The Heavenspan Mountain started trembling violently.

Jun Tian’s expression changed wildly and he said in shock, “T-The Heavenspan Mountain is … being taken in by you?”

The current Jun Tian felt like he had incredibly bad luck.

He never dreamed that such a situation would actually occur.

Ye Yuan was actually going to take in the Heavenspan Mountain!

The Heavenspan Mountain was Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s heavenly spirit immortal treasure of the legends!

Who could have thought that such a treasure would actually land in Ye Yuan’s hands!

“Yeah. Otherwise, how can I, this ant, beat you, this powerful Heavenly Stratum powerhouse?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

After breaking through to Heavenly Stratum, Ye Yuan’s mind became more agile as luck hit, suddenly feeling a sense of perfect harmony with the Heavenspan Mountain.

It was also precisely because of this that he could easily smack Jun Tian flying.

Otherwise, how could he, a newbie who just broke through to Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, possibly be Jun Tian’s match?

Ye Yuan also never thought that the Heavenspan Mountain, which all of the Heavenspan World’s powerhouses viewed as a cultivation holy land, was actually just a treasure!

Such a treasure could actually be taken away!

And the key to taking this treasure away was refining the Heart of Heavenspan.

Ye Yuan stumbled blindly and refined the Heart of Heavenspan, and he created the Chaos Heavenspan Canon by blind chance, becoming a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse.

In the end, he took in the Heavenspan Mountain with a random stumble!

The moment it moved, it was earth-shattering!

Currently, the entire Heavenspan World was in the midst of trembling. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan arrived at the foot of the Heavenspan Mountain with a flash.

Boom!

Ye Yuan directly reached a hand out and stuck it into the ground.

The first feeling was heavy!

Incomparably heavy!

Ye Yuan’s complexion flushed bright red, using all the strength in his body.

Although he refined the Heavenspan Mountain, he did not have the method to mobilize such a treasure at all.

Even if his mind was linked with the Heavenspan Mountain and the Heavenspan Mountain became countless times lighter.

But it was still unbelievably heavy!

Rumble?…

The Heavenspan Mountain moved!

Jun Tian’s expression was indescribably ugly.

“This guy … is really boorish! He doesn’t know the method to use the Heavenspan Mountain at all. So he’s actually pulling up the mountain with his bare hands! If you can take in the Heavenspan Mountain, that would be strange!” Jun Tian said with a cold laugh.

At the same time, he raised his spear again.

Toward this kind of newbie, even if you gave him a supreme treasure, he would not know how to use it either!

How could he possibly lose to this kind of rookie?

While at this time, the entire Heavenspan World was shaking.

Everyone fell into deep shock.

Wei Feng and the rest had blank faces as they said in shock, “What’s Lord Saint Azure doing? C-Could it be that he’s going to pull the Heavenspan Mountain up?”

“I-It’s impossible, right? The Heavenspan Mountain leads above the heavens! How can this kind of divine mountain possibly be pulled up with human strength?”

“What on earth is His Excellency trying to do? Could it be that he’s going to use the Heavenspan Mountain to deal with Jun Tian?”

… …

In this place, the Heavenspan Mountain was faintly visible.

Ye Yuan’s astonishing aura could not be concealed no matter what, how could they not know what Ye Yuan was trying to do?

But Jun Tian ignored these, brandishing the azure long spear in his hand. A similarly astonishing imposing momentum rose to the sky.

“Seven Cardinal Sky Howling Spear! This spear will let you know the outcome of resisting heaven!”

His voice had yet to fade when Jun Tian’s expression suddenly changed wildly.

“Argh?… !”

Rumble?…

It was only to hear Ye Yuan give a long howl.

The Heavenspan Mountain rose up from the ground!

Jun Tian opened his mouth wide, having a look of disbelief.

Below the Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan’s figure was tall and straight.

His two hands supported the Heavenspan Mountain, appearing somewhat strained.

But he had indeed heaved it up!

Boom!

The moment the Heavenspan Mountain moved, the sky seemed to have had a hole poked in it.

A thick to the extreme spiritual energy suddenly poured down.

An enormous black vortex suddenly appeared in the sky, like a black hole.

That appearance was seemingly like a stopper was pulled away by someone!

In the Heavenspan World, everyone was inexplicably shocked, thinking that it was the end of the world.

This scene was too shocking!

Wei Feng’s pupils constricted and he cried out in alarm, “P-P-Pulled up! Really pulled up! T-T-This … How is this possible?”

Boom!

Ye Yuan moved and took a step forward.

The earth quaked and mountains swayed!

Boom!

Ye Yuan took another step forward!

Below the Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan was insignificant as an ant.

But his imposing momentum was astonishing like a celestial’s!

Pulling up the mountain with strength, unparalleled imposing aura!

Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum obstructed even the sky!

Jun Tian already accumulated his momentum fully, only waiting for a suitable opportunity to unleash his spear.

But now, he hesitated!

“Why? Aren’t you serious now? Thrust your spear! I, this ant, don’t even know how to use the Heavenspan Mountain. Could it be that you’ll feel scared too?” Ye Yuan’s words were full of mockery.

Jun Tian’s expression changed slightly, but his imposing momentum became weaker and weaker.

Thrusting one’s spear paid great attention to momentum!

Even if one reached Heavenly Stratum, this principle would not change too.

His imposing momentum could poke a hole in the sky.

But he encountered Ye Yuan!

This guy was completely unreasonable!

He pulled the mountain up!

No matter how strong his momentum was, how could it possibly win the current Ye Yuan?

Therefore, he was nervous!

He was backing away!

“Huhu,?didn’t you say that you’re heaven? The paramount heaven will actually be afraid of an ant? Laughable! Really ridiculous!”

Ye Yuan returned all of Jun Tian’s mockery to him!

He was still advancing, Jun Tian was still retreating.

It was already impossible to unleash his spear!

“D-Damn it! You lunatic! Consider yourself ruthless! After I report the matter here to the sect, I want to see how you still be arrogant?!”

Finally, Jun Tian put away the azure long spear, his figure moving, speeding toward the horizon.

He did not dare to clash with Ye Yuan anymore!

For example, this Heavenspan Mountain was ten thousand pounds in Ye Yuan’s hand.

When it reached him with such strong momentum, it might be a million, or ten million pounds!

His spear was likely to be smashed!

The Heavenspan Mountain was a heavenly spirit treasure!

His long spear was not on the same level at all!

If Ye Yuan smashed the mountain over, how many tens of millions of pounds would that power be?

It was just that, how could Ye Yuan let him go just like this?

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh, the divine essence within his body surging crazily. He used all the strength in his body and threw the Heavenspan Mountain out.

Then, the Heavenspan Mountain smashed toward that figure above the sky amidst everyone’s astonished gazes.

The speed was swift to the extreme!

Jun Tian was currently sweeping past wildly, but the Heavenspan Mountain’s speed was too fast, and the size was too large!

Nowhere to avoid!

His pupils constricted, his scalp tingling.

At this time, there was only forcefully resisting it!

Boom!

Jun Tian spurted a mouthful of blood wildly, feeling the bones all over his body were crumbling.

The strike of a heavenly spirit treasure, the power was formidable to the extreme!

However, a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse was ultimately a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse. This kind of terrifying force still did not smash him to death.

Borrowing the counter-shock force, his speed became even faster, directly flying into that mass of black vortex, disappearing!

“Ye Yuan, I’ve remembered today’s matter! The plane passageway is going to close. Even if you broke through to Heavenly Stratum, you can’t leave the Heavenspan World too! Wash your neck well and wait for death!”

Only at this time did a sentence come over from the void.
