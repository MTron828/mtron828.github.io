Chapter 3006: Lord Long Jian, They Are Here!

“No explanation. A brat is breaking through in the Eternal River. It’s that simple,” Long Jian said coolly.

“Breaking through? Long Jian, are you taking all of us to be fools? In these countless years, those who broke through in the Eternal River were numerous, but it’s unheard of that anyone could cause the entire Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven to be in an upheaval!” Bai Zhi clearly did not believe it.

Long Jian shrugged and said with a smile, “You don’t believe me? If you all don’t believe me, follow me to the Eternal River, and you’ll understand.”

Carrying doubtful feelings, Bai Zhi and the rest entered the Eternal River’s void.

Immediately, the expressions on all the Hegemons’ faces became blank.

Really breaking through!

Bai Zhi’s pupils constricted and he drew a breath of cold air as he exclaimed, “Is … Is he absorbing the power of chaos? How is this possible?”

Long Jian said helplessly, “When this boy entered the Eternal River, he suddenly gained enlightenment. Then, it became like this. This seat is very helpless too!”

Luan Qinghe said in surprise, “Just Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum? It looks like … he seems to have scattered his cultivation. Is he re-cultivating anew?”

“In this case, the person who turned the entire Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven upside down is actually someone at the Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum?” Xuan Taiqing said speechlessly.

Long Jian nodded his head.

Those who saw Ye Yuan were all extremely shocked.

Because everything before their eyes had already subverted everyone’s understanding.

But, after being shocked, Bai Zhi’s brows furrowed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Long Jian, isn’t he being too tyrannical by cultivating like this? If he cultivates for ten thousand years here, wouldn’t we be unable to cultivate for ten thousand years?”

“This … It shouldn’t be, right?” Long Jian said awkwardly.

“What do you mean by that! Do you mean that the few dozen of us Hegemon Realms have to cultivate based on this boy’s mood?” Bai Zhi said unhappily.

Long Jian naturally knew that this was inappropriate, but Ye Yuan was currently mustering up a vigorous effort to do it in one go and could not be interrupted.

He spread his two hands out and said, “Then, what do you think should be done?”

Bai Zhi said in a cold voice, “Make this kid stop!”

“That’s impossible!” Long Jian directly rejected it.

Bai Zhi frowned and said, “Long Jian, I know that your dragon race is very strong, but could it be that our three clans’ Hegemons added up can’t compare to a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum brat? If we really fall out, could it be that your dragon clan can still be our three clans’ match? Furthermore, there aren’t just our four symbols family clans in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven!”

Long Jian’s two eyes turned cold, and he said in a solemn voice, “Are you threatening this seat?”

The atmosphere immediately became somewhat dangerously explosive.

Long Jian had long realized that Ye Yuan might have comprehended something incredible. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

To the Dragon Clan, Ye Yuan’s importance was self-evident.

If Ye Yuan could really break the shackles of a divergent cultivator and become a divergent cultivator Hegemon, the dragon race would surely add another great general to their ranks.

Actually, ever since Mi Tian’s demise, the dragon race’s status was currently being weakened.

Therefore, it was naturally impossible for him to let Ye Yuan’s cultivation be interrupted without interfering.

While on the other side, the Supreme Hegemons of the three clans had clearly realized this problem too.

The rise of the dragon race anew was not what they were willing to see.

“Brother Long Jian, how about we each take a step back?” Luan Qinghe suddenly said.

“Say it!” Long Jian said in a solemn voice.

“Why don’t we set one year as the date? If this boy is still cultivating after a year, I hope that the Dragon Clan will take the initiative to wake him up!” Luan Qinghe said.

“No way! If you have to have a deadline, three years!” Long Jian directly interrupted.

Luan Qinghe nodded and said, “Okay, three years it is! What do the two of you think?”

Bai Zhi said with a cold snort, “Okay!”

Xuan Taiqing also said, “I don’t have objections either!”

Luan Qinghe said, “Alright. Brother Long Jian, three years later, if this boy still insists on cultivating like this, don’t blame our three clans for turning our blades toward the Dragon Clan!”

The three clans left, but Long Jian felt tremendous pressure too.

The strength of these three races added together was no joke.

Long Jian could not help feeling a headache and said with a sigh, “This boy can really cause trouble! Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven’s Hegemon Realm powerhouses have probably all moved because of him!”

Long Ran smiled bitterly and said, “However, this boy’s potential is really very terrifying! His cultivation this time is because he scattered his cultivation. The divine essence within his body is empty. That’s how he could accomplish it in one go. But if he wants to cultivate like this next time, he won’t be able to do it!”

Cultivation was a slow simmering process to begin with. It could not be rushed.

Long Ran saw through it. If Ye Yuan could recover his strength in one stroke this time, that would naturally be good.

But, if he was interrupted, his cultivation in the future would yield half the results with twice the effort.

Long Jian also smiled bitterly and said, “Three years is the limit that this seat can fight for. Against dozens of Hegemon Realm powerhouses, this seat is under a lot of pressure too! If I can’t bear it, then I can only request Progenitor to come forward.”

… …

Infinite Overcast Oath Heaven, it was the Hegemon land of the heavenly fiend race.

Eternal River branch stream, the place closest to the main stream, the heavenly fiend race’s progenitor, Great Beyond Realm Hegemon Kong Nie, was currently gaining enlightenment on the Great Beyond.

Suddenly, the Eternal River became violent.

“Mn? The Eternal River is like an ancient well without ripples, it has always been very calm. What’s going on here?” Progenitor Kong Nie said with a frown.

However, he did not take it seriously either.

With his strength, he could respond to any changes with ease.

Only to see his Great Beyond Realm aura releasing, directly isolating the raging Eternal River, and continued to comprehend.

Several days later, his cultivation was interrupted again.

The surrounding Eternal River became even more violent. It had already completely consumed his territory.

Progenitor Kong Nie gave a cold snort and said, “This is the undulation coming from the Dragon Clan branch stream. Does Mi Zhen that old thing want to have a battle of magicks with this seat? Can this seat still lose to you?”

Boom!

Progenitor Kong Nie released his overwhelming aura and started fighting with the raging Eternal River water.

He attempted to suppress the violent Eternal River.

But very soon, his expression changed.

He discovered that he was completely not this power’s match.

The water of the Eternal River became more and more violent.

No way to cultivate anymore!

“Old Man Mi Zhen! This ancestor?@$#&?your uncle! Your Father will be coming to Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven. I want to see what the hell you, this old thing, is doing!”

Swoosh!

In an instant, Progenitor Kong Nie’s figure disappeared from the Eternal River.

The entire 33 Heavens had no idea how many Hegemon Realm powerhouses were letting loose a torrent of abuse.

Then they came to Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven one after another.

For some time, the Hegemons from all the heavens came in throngs!

On the shore, Long Jian broke out into cold sweat. He wished to drag Ye Yuan up to beat him to death.

Couldn’t this boy make less of a disturbance?

The three-year deadline was about to be up in a twinkle. Not only did Ye Yuan not show the slightest signs of restraint, but he also caused an even greater commotion instead.

The Eternal River’s main stream, the power of chaos had become incomparably berserk now. Enormous waves as high as heaven would be set off at the drop of a hat.

Even if he closed his eyes, he also knew that the other planes were already affected.

Which of those cultivating in the Eternal River was not a big shot whose reputation shook the heavens?

At this rate, it was very dangerous!

Long Jian felt that he almost could not withstand it anymore.

“Boy, hurry up and wake up! At this rate, Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven is almost becoming the battlefield of all the heavens!” Long Jian smiled bitterly and said.

“Lord Long Jian, Hegemon Zhi Fan is here!”

“Lord Long Jian, Hegemon Tang Xi is here!”

… …

“Lord Long Jian, Progenitor Kong Nie … is here!”

Long Jian became speechless.
