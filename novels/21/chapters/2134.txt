Chapter 2138: Just a Misunderstanding

Along the way, the three people were extremely careful, just thieves that entered a house, fearful of making any sounds.

Encountering a tiny bit of wind rustling, they would be like startled rabbits, slipping away with a scramble.

Ye Yuan had a relaxed look as he followed behind the three people.

This scene naturally became synonymous with acting recklessly and blindly in the eyes of the three people.

However, the three people really had some ability in the area of avoiding abyss monsters. The moment there were some activities, they would be able to recognize it in advance and avoid it.

Clearly, these few people already had their way of survival in this Dragon Eye Cave. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Along the way, Ye Yuan baited quite a bit of verbal exchanges.

These three people were called Long Xun, Ao Ming, and Long Qing. They came from different respective earth strongholds and black strongholds and were people who committed the most heinous crimes and were thrown into the Dragon Eye Cave.

Entering the Dragon Eye Cave was basically equivalent to being sentenced to the death penalty, but it did not mean that one would die right away.

These three people were crafty and sly, finding a way to survive in this place, avoiding many dangers, and even pulled together a team of more than ten people.

Most of these people committed severe crimes in the strongholds, that was why they would be thrown into the Dragon Eye Cave.

This made Ye Yuan very surprised. These dragon clans’ habitats actually all had the Dragon Eye Cave’s entrances.

What kind of damn place was this Dragon Eye Cave?

But those who survived in this region were mostly not strong, being only at the True God Realm.

Long Xun had already entered the Dragon Eye Cave for over 20 years. He was already considered outstanding among this group of people.

Right now, they were currently leading Ye Yuan back to the base.

“Kid, let me tell you, if you’re like this in the Dragon Eye Cave, it will be considered little even if you die a hundred times over!” Long Xun looked at Ye Yuan and said with a disappointed look.

This guy was exasperatingly slow every time, taking his own sweet time, angering Long Xun badly.

But Long Xun also felt strange in his heart, how come this kid could always keep up with the three of them?

As proud members of the dragon race, Long Xun three people looked down on Ye Yuan, this human, from the bottom of their hearts. But they had to admit that Ye Yuan’s luck was very good.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks for Big Brother Xun taking care along the way.”

Long Xun shot a glare at Ye Yuan and said with a cold snort, “At least you have some eyesight! Along the way, if not for Big Brother Xun, me, you’d have died ten times!”

“Yes, yes,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

“Roar, roar!”

Right at this time, several ferocious abyss monsters suddenly dashed out of the dense woods, blocking the few people’s path all at once.

These few abyss monsters came extremely suddenly, like they had been lying in ambush.

Long Xun’s face turned pale with a swoosh.

The auras of the few abyss monsters were very powerful and already had peak rank six cultivation realm.

As for combat strength, it absolutely swept across those in the same rank!

It was only to see Long Xun’s eyes swivel around, a plan forming in his head.

He winked at Long Qing and Ao Ming, then shouted loudly, “Heh, do these brutes really take it that your Grandpa Xun is easy to be pushed around? Boy, you deal with that right-side one, leave the rest to the three of us!”

There were six abyss monsters that appeared this time, the three of them dealing with five and letting Ye Yuan deal with one sounded very righteous.

How could Ye Yuan not know Long Xun’s little scheme? But he did not mind either, slowly drawing the bone sword and walking towards the abyss monster.

“Roar, roar!”

Seeing Ye Yuan slowly walk over, the group of monsters was clearly enraged, immediately pouncing over toward him.

At this time, Long Xun winked again. The three people took off and escaped in the opposite direction with extremely fast speed.

“Kid, Big Brother Xun saved you many times along the way, then you save Big Brother Xun once and stay behind to be cannon fodder! Hahaha ...”

Behind, came Long Xun’s delighted laughter.

Amidst the laughter, Ye Yuan did not turn his head back either, like he did not hear his words, continuing to walk over towards the abyss monsters.

Then, Long Xun’s laughter abruptly stopped.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Ye Yuan stabbed a sword out, carrying along with astonishing explosion sounds.

Amidst the three people’s stupefied gazes, the six abyss monsters were completely annihilated.

From start to end, Ye Yuan only unleashed one sword.

“T-T-This ... How is this possible?” Long Qing’s jaws almost dropped, his eyes full of disbelief.

“S-So strong!” Ao Ming similarly opened his mouth wide and said in shock.

Long Xun rubbed his eyes, he was doubting if he saw wrongly or not.

But he rubbed many times and discovered that it was still the same outcome.

Abyss monsters completely wiped out!

“Is ... Is this guy a freak? How can he be so strong?” Long Xun said in shock.

He suddenly recalled him showing off in front of Ye Yuan and even said ‘Big Brother Xun will protect you.’ It was simply like being a clown.

Ye Yuan exterminated six peak rank six abyss monsters with one sword. Wouldn’t killing him be like chopping vegetables?

He thought that Ye Yuan was just a little lamb, who knew that it was a big gray wolf!

The shock in Long Xun’s heart was simply unable to use words to describe.

He had mucked around in this Dragon Eye Cave for so long, how could he not have an understanding of the abyss monsters’ combat power?

Back then, they ran into a peak rank six abyss monster. Five people attacked at the same time. In the end, they successfully escaped with the death of two people as the price.

Peak rank six abyss monsters swept away everything!

Hence, when he saw those abyss monsters, he thought of running away at once.

Fight?

It did not exist!

But now, Ye Yuan just unleashed one sword and dealt with six peak rank six abyss monsters. What kind of terrifying combat power was this?

Long Xun was of the proud dragon race, so he completely looked down on humans.

But now, Ye Yuan shattered his pride to smithereens with absolute strength!

Was this guy really just Eighth Firmament True God?

Ye Yuan was also very satisfied with the power of this sword.

Breaking through to Eighth Firmament True God, his strength indeed made great improvements again.

The power of True Sword Hollow Etch was more than several times stronger than before.

Dealing with these peak rank six abyss monsters naturally did not need that much effort anymore.

“H-Huhu, this lord, just now, we were just ... just ... It was a misunderstanding! A misunderstanding!” Long Xun had an awkward look, wanting to explain his earlier actions.

Except, he discovered that no matter how he explained, it was very feeble.

Witnessing Ye Yuan’s strength, how could they still dare to run?

No matter how fast they were, could they be faster than Ye Yuan’s sword?

That scene earlier was seriously too shocking.

Ye Yuan put away the bone sword, turned to look at Long Xun, and said with a smile, “Big Brother Xun ...”

“Dare not, dare not! In front of Your Excellency, how can this lowly one dare call himself Big Brother Xun? Your Excellency, just call me Little Xun will do,” Long Xun said in fear and trepidation.

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “It’s still Big Brother Xun that sounds warm! Big Brother Xun doesn’t need to explain anything. This Ye understands. There are dangers all around in the Dragon Eye Cave, so sacrificing the knights in order to save the queen is only human nature.”

“M-Many thanks for Your Excellency’s understanding!” Long Xun said with a fearful look on his face.

He did not know whether Ye Yuan really understood or was faking understanding. After all, the action previously was courting death.

“However ... ” Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s tone changed, becoming fierce.

Long Xun’s heart that just calmed down immediately jumped.

“This is the first time, I hope that it’s also the last time! Next time, I won’t be so pleasant!” Ye Yuan’s tone gradually turned cold, making cold sweat pour on Long Xun’s forehead.
