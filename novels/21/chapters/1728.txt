Chapter 1732 Smelling Fragrance and Recognizing Poison

Duan Peng put away the Raging Fire Centipede’s corpse, the party embarked on the journey once more.

Yu Jing had a look of pleasant surprise and said, “You, kid, were too reckless! Just now, you scared Elder Sister Jing to death!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just a Raging Fire Centipede. It can’t hurt me. But Elder Sister Jing, can I ask? You seem to ... be very concerned about me?”

In the beginning, Ye Yuan just thought that Yu Jing was very good-natured.

But later, Ye Yuan gradually felt Yu Jing’s concern. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Especially when Luo Yong had him go deal with the Raging Fire Centipede earlier.

Yu Jing let out a sigh and said, “When Elder Sister Jing sees you, I’ll think about that unlucky younger brother of mine. He’s the same age as you. Back then, he was also young and spirited, wanting to challenge the Skydemon Mountain Range, but ...”

Talking up to here, Yu Jing choked a little.

Ye Yuan came to a realization when he heard it and said with a sigh, “Sorry, my deepest condolences, Elder Sister Jing.”

Yu Jing snickered and glared as she said, “You punk, cursing my younger brother eh? He isn’t dead yet!”

Ye Yuan froze when he heard it, immediately feeling incomparably wronged.

I say, sister, your action just now, anyone would think that he was dead!

Seeing Ye Yuan’s wronged look, Yu Jing laughed and said, “Alright, alright, it was Elder Sister who didn’t state it clearly. I’m not blaming you!’

That appearance was overflowing with flirtatiousness.

When it landed in the eyes of Luo Yong who was not far away, wasn’t it lovers joking around?

“Brat, before you come out, your dad definitely didn’t tell you that some people are who you can’t afford to provoke! Dare to play me, I will let you die without even you knowing how you died!”

Luo Yong already sentenced Ye Yuan to death in his heart.

As long as there was a chance, he would definitely bury Ye Yuan alive!

This kind of thing, he had done it more than once or twice.

Only through Yu Jing’s oral account did Ye Yuan know what happened to her younger brother.

It turned out that Yu Jing was not a member of Linyao Imperial City. Her younger brother wanted to hone himself, so he secretly left their hometown and entered the Skydemon Mountain Range to train.

When Yu Jing learned the news that her younger brother left home, upon guessing that he definitely came here, she rushed to Linyao Imperial City straight away.

Only after inquiring about it did she know that her younger brother indeed came here, and even entered the mountain.

It was just that after some time, what she found out at the end was that her brother got inflicted by a strange poison.

Yu Jing searched for miracle doctors in Linyao Imperial City and also could not treat her younger brother’s poison. She could only use some special means to temporarily suppress her younger brother’s poison.

She did not dare to leave Linyao Imperial City. She was afraid that her younger brother would die on the way.

Hence, she simply became a hunter here, following squads in and out of the Skydemon Mountain Range to support her younger brother.

Presently, the poison’s flare up incident was getting more and more. It was an indication that he did not have much time left

So hearging about him, Ye Yuan now understood that was why Yu Jing would be so sad.

Knowing this, Ye Yuan also sighed.

Yu Jing, a woman, spent so many years in Linyao Imperial City for her brother, truly not easy.

Linyao Imperial City was clearly different from other imperial cities. The weak were prey and the strong feasts here. It was more apparent than in other places.

Without strength, it was hard to advance an inch here.

Just like before, Luo Yong compelled him to fight against the Raging Fire Centipede. Apart from Yu Jing, no one helped to speak up for him.

If he was strong, killing the Raging Fire Centipede was one thing.

If his strength was lacking and he really died?

Most likely, no one would be sad, and would instead mock him for his strength being lacking.

The people here were all very realistic.

They walked together for benefit and also killed each other for benefit.

Ye Yuan said, “Elder Sister Jing, you rest assured. Your younger brother’s poison, I’ll help him to resolve it! At that time, you sister and brother will be able to go back home!”

Yu Jing did have the slightest excitement when she heard it, but she instead smiled and said, “Silly Little Brother. Your good intentions, Elder Sister understands it.”

“Overestimating your own ability! Younger Sister Jing’s brother, even Master Song Yu couldn’t cure him. You, a snotty brat whose hair isn’t even fully grown, what are you babbling about?” Luo Yong smiled coldly and said.

Duan Peng also smiled and said, “I didn’t expect that Brother Ye is even an alchemist. But Master Song Yu is a Five-star Alchemy God. Even he was helpless, so you probably won’t be able to do much.”

Receiving the Blood Curdle Fruit and Raging Fire Centipede’s corpse, Duan Peng’s attitude toward Ye Yuan was much better.

But in this matter, he clearly felt that Ye Yuan boasted too much.

Yu Jing smiled bitterly and said, “I pulled a lot of strings and finally found Master Song Yu’s connections. It’s just that I didn’t expect that even he was helpless about it too.”

Linyao Imperial City was close to the Skydemon Mountain Range. Countless martial artists were killed and wounded every day.

This kind of place, the alchemy profession was naturally very developed too. Having a Five-star Alchemy God was not odd.

Ye Yuan suddenly scooted close to Yu Jing and sniffed vigorously.

Yu Jing was startled and even thought that Ye Yuan was going to be frivolous with her, hurriedly dodging aside and saying angrily, “Ye Yuan, what are you doing!”

Ye Yuan ignored her, slowly closed his eyes, and opened his mouth to say, “Ironwood Incense, Hunting Cloud Light Breeze Powder, Sandalwood Huo Ming Grass ... Uh ... looks like when your younger brother’s toxicity flares up, it should be alternating between hot and cold, entire body twitching. If I didn’t guess wrongly, he should be foaming at the mouth, his complexion waxing, vomiting blood, and several other symptoms. Putting it all together, your brother was probably inflicted by the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug’s poison, right?”

Ye Yuan shut his eyes and said a whole bunch in one go.

When Luo Yong saw Yu Jing get angry, plus Ye Yuan’s action earlier, anger also flared up in his heart.

Sneering secretly in his heart, he realised he finally found a chance!

He gave a cold shout, “Punk, you want to take the opportunity to take advantage of Younger Sister Jing, and even ranted nonsense! Your Father will exterminate you right now!”

Done talking, he released his aura and smacked a palm toward Ye Yuan.

But he did not notice that the more Ye Yuan talked, the more Yu Jing’s eyes revealed a look of disbelief.

She suddenly grabbed Ye Yuan’s arm and said in surprise, “You ... You’re really too incredible!”

Luo Yong’s action stopped abruptly. Ye Yuan’s body was blocked by Yu Jing. If he smacked a palm down, Yu Jing would be gone.

“You ... You wouldn’t have guessed that it was the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug with that sniff, right?”

Yu Jing was really stunned!

She only told Ye Yuan just now that her younger brother was tormented by a strange poison and did not say anything else.

But Ye Yuan actually only sniffed the smell on her body and listed those spirit medicines perfectly!

This was simply too inconceivable!

Furthermore, the things that Ye Yuan said were exactly the same as Master Song Yu!

One had to know, Master Song Yu diagnosed her brother in person, while Ye Yuan had not even met her younger brother before, and actually deduced so accurately.

This strength, she simply did not dare to imagine it.

When Duan Peng saw Yu Jing’s reaction, he was also extremely shocked and said, “Yu Jing, you mean that ... what your brother was poisoned by was really the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug’s poison?”

Yu Jing nodded and said, “Yes! What Master Song Yu said was exactly identical to what Yu Jing said, it’s the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug! Furthermore, the symptoms that Yu Jing said were not the slightest bit off, just like he saw it with his own eyes!”

The rest all used eyes like they had seen a ghost to look at Ye Yuan.

What kind of freak was this fellow?

He only sniffed the residual medicinal fragrance on Yu Jing’s body, and he could actually infer such a result.

This skill was simply formidable to the extent that it was somewhat ridiculous!
