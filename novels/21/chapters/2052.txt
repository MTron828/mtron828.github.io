Chapter 2056: Surprising Choice

Luo Tianqi looked at Ye Yuan with a disbelieving face. He was even thinking that he heard it wrongly.

At this juncture, Ye Yuan actually still made him get lost?

It was not just Luo Tianqi. The rest also looked at Ye Yuan with shocked faces.

“Grandmaster Ye, I think that you haven’t had a clear understanding of the current situation. Once the Myriad Treasure Tower is defeated, do you feel that you can still be leisurely and carefree in this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City still? Without the Myriad Treasure Tower’s protection, Empyrean Pilljade they all will likely be the first to target you!” Luo Tianqi said with a cold smile.

He felt that there was a need to analyze the current situation for Ye Yuan. Otherwise, Ye Yuan might feel that he was still that high and mighty grandmaster.

Ye Yuan looked at Luo Tianqi and said calmly, “You said too much crap! I asked you to get lost, didn’t you hear me?”

Luo Tianqi laughed due to extreme fury and said, “Good! Good! That day when you become a bereaved dog, I want to see what you have to be this arrogant! At that time, don’t you regret it!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Finished talking, Luo Tianqi turned around and was about to leave.

“Wait!” Ye Yuan suddenly yelled.

Luo Tianqi’s footsteps paused. Turning around to look at Ye Yuan, he smiled coldly and said, “What? Regretting it? It’s already too late to regret now!”

Ye Yuan had a lazy appearance as he said coolly, “I asked you to roll[1]. Didn’t you hear me?”

Luo Tianqi’s face changed and he said in a solemn voice, “You! You dare to humiliate me? I, Luo Tianqi, am a member of the Luo Family! Do you want to wage war with my Luo Family?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold, a terrifying pressure crushed over towards Luo Tianqi.

Bang!

Without the slightest strength to resist, Luo Tianqi was directly pressed firmly onto the ground by Ye Yuan’s pressure.

By the side, the pupils of Yun Yi and the rest of the True God Realm martial artists shrunk, looking at this scene with aghast.

There was nothing to say about Ye Yuan’s alchemy talent; they prostrated on all fours in admiration.

But they never would have thought that Ye Yuan’s Martial Dao was actually so strong too.

Although Luo Tianqi was True God Realm, pressing the other party on the ground, able to move just based on pressure, they could not do it.

Ye Yuan did not have an overbearing personality. So if they did not want to acknowledge him as their master, then just leave.

But this Luo Tianqi was too arrogant, using whatever Luo Family to pressure him at the drop of a hat. Did Luo Tianqi really take him to be easy to bully?

Even if Ye Yuan was made out of clay, he would have some anger too.

“Whatever you’re unhappy about, say however you like behind my back. But saying it in front of me, you’re in the wrong. Starting from now, until you roll out of Heavenly Eagle, as long as let me hear one more superfluous word, you don’t need to leave anymore. Don’t doubt whether I dare or not. You can very well give it a try,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Done talking, Ye Yuan withdrew his aura. Luo Tianqi felt like a giant mountain moved away from his body.

But no matter how arrogant he was, he also did not dare to bet with his life. He could only keep silent and say nothing. He started rolling on the ground, rolling out of the city little by little.

“Tianping, you send him out of the city. If he still dares to talk nonsense, directly kill him!” Ye Yuan instructed the Ning Tianping beside him.

Ning Tianping chuckled and said, “Yes, Your Excellency!”

Ning Tianping looked toward Luo Tianqi and did not have the slightest sympathy.

To dare posture in front of His Excellency, one needed to be prepared to have their face slapped by His Excellency.

This guy did not even figure out the situation and dare to posture. He truly did not know what he was talking about.

His Excellency even dared to throw hands at Empyrean Pilljade; could he be what you, a puny little Luo Family’s Celestial Deity Realm, can blaspheme?

Your family’s ancestor coming was more like it!

The others were all silent like cicadas in winter. How could they still dare to posture in front of Ye Yuan?

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly opened his mouth again and said, “I know that you guys feel that Heavenly Eagle is near destruction and feel that I should take you all as disciples to preserve myself. However ... you’re thinking too much! Back then, I said it very clearly at the Cloudpill Summit. If you want to acknowledge me as your master, you have to undergo repeated trials. I gave you all the chance, but it was you who didn’t cherish it yourselves. Hence, Yun Yi and Yang Xuan stay behind. The others can all scram!”

Yun Yi’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of surprise.

Duan Yunfei similarly had a look of disbelief as he said, “Grandmaster Ye, are you mistaken? Yun Yi is Empyrean Pilljade’s descendant. You’re actually going to take him in as disciple?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “What does that matter? A battle is a battle; accepting disciples is accepting disciples. These are two different matters to begin with. It’s you all who wanted to lump them together yourselves. I said it before, I first look at one’s character when taking in a disciple, look at disposition second, and third is talent. If Yun Yi was the same as you all, then even if his talent is higher than the heavens, I’ll also make him get lost. But he’s more of an alchemist compared to you all. His future accomplishments will also be what you all can only look up to.”

Yun Yi’s entire body trembled and actually wept from extreme joy.

When he heard that the Myriad Treasure Tower was breaking away from the Southern Border Alliance, Yun Yi already despaired.

He knew that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to take him in as a disciple.

Who would take the descendant of their enemy as a disciple?

But he never imagined that Ye Yuan gave him a huge surprise.

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Yun Yi kowtowed three times in a row to Ye Yuan and said while shedding tears of gratitude: “Master Ye, Yun Yi will follow you in this lifetime and will never change until death!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You could lay down your noble status and come to the Pill Tower to be a little medicine boy. Ten years of persistence is sufficient to see your sincere heart toward alchemy. Other people all said that I wouldn’t accept you. Yet, I’m going to make the world see that his, Pilljade’s, descendant, will definitely surpass his predecessor!”

Yun Yi had a resolute face as he said, “Yes! Yun Yi definitely won’t let Master Ye down!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and turned to Yang Xuan and said, “Yang Xuan, from today onward, you’re the fourth disciple under me, Ye Yuan. Come, pay respects to your senior apprentice brother and sister.”

Beside Ye Yuan stood Bai Chen and Ning Siyu.

Ever since entering the Heavenspan World, he only took Bai Chen, one disciple. Ning Siyu was the second.

Yang Xuan had a look of agitation and knelt down toward Ye Yuan. Following that, he bowed to Bai Chen, Ning Siyu, and Yun Yi.

No one could have thought that the two disciples which Ye Yuan accepted in the end would be the Cloudpill Summit’s first place and first place from the bottom.

Yun Yi’s identity was special, so no one thought that Ye Yuan would take him in.

Yang Xuan was even more unremarkable and did not even have any background.

Yet, these two people entered Ye Yuan’s doorway in the end.

Duan Yunfei and the rest looked at this scene, with their faces full of envy.

With Ye Yuan’s guidance, these two people attaining a higher level in alchemy in the future was highly probable.

But they missed this opportunity.

It was just that in this world, there was no regret medicine that could be eaten.

What Ye Yuan said was right. He already gave them the chance, but it was they themselves who did not cherish it.

The Myriad Treasure Tower and Southern Border Alliance’s battle would probably last for ten years, or even as long as several decades no matter how fast it was.

And this period of time was sufficient for Ye Yuan to teach them many things.

Even though no one thought that the Myriad Treasure Tower would win, they were still very envious.

“Alright, you all can go now,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The expressions of Duan Yunfei and the rest changed, finally still leaving unwillingly.

They did not dare to disobey Ye Yuan. Luo Tianqi was the best example if they disobeyed him.

After everyone left, Ye Yuan opened his mouth and said coolly, “The two of you cultivated for ten years.Aare there any harvests?”

Yun Yi bowed in salute and said, “Replying Master, Yun Yi benefited a great deal! Those people capitalized on that they were noble and turned their noses up at this training. But they didn’t know that Master was actually teaching us!”
