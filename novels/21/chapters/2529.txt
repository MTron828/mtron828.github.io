Chapter 2535: Brat, Quickly Demonstrate Your Skill!

“These few years, His Majesty instructed to thoroughly investigate the matter of Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s outer-sect deacon, Jun Tian’s death. Now, there’s finally some leads. Someone saw that the place Deacon Jun last went seemed to be Inklight Forest! Calling you all here is to have you all cast the net out. Whoever can find Deacon Jun or find his cause of death first, this prince will naturally reward heavily!”

In the Tang Family’s council hall, a young man with a handsome face like carved jade sat on the seat of honor, radiating awe without being angry.

This young man was precisely Eastward Country’s second prince, his highness.

He came to the Tang Family in secret this time, secretly meeting with the affiliated factions headed by the Tang Family, in order to borrow their strength and find news of Jun Tian.

This matter had a great bearing on his struggle with the crown prince. Hence, Second Prince was naturally extremely cautious.

Tang Jinhua hurriedly got up and gave a bow and said, “Second Prince’s matter is the Tang Family’s matter! Later, I’ll cast the net out. Even if we dig three feet under Inklight Forest, we’ll also find Deacon Jun!”

Second Prince nodded and said,?“Mn,?my mind is naturally set at ease when Mr. Tang does things. This matter is very important, you all mustn’t take it lightly. Also, for Master Gu, you have a wide circle of acquaintances, if you hear some news, you can exchange with the Tang Family to make up for what each other is lacking.”

Gu Mao nodded and said, “Second Prince, rest assured. Gu Mao understands. But speaking of which, Tang Yu, that big brother of yours, the time he ascended seems to just nicely match the time when Deacon Jun went missing, right? What a coincidence!”

Tang Yu’s expression changed, not expecting that Gu Mao actually turned the heat on him at this time!

Ever since that incident that time, Gu Mao and the Tang Family had passed their honeymoon period, appearing united outwardly, but divided at heart.

It was just that the entanglement between both parties’ interests was too deep, so there had been no eruption all along.

But this time, Gu Mao suddenly erupted.

Tang Yu’s expression changed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Master Gu, you!”

But Second Prince’s eyes lit up and he asked curiously, “Tang Yu’s big brother?”

Gu Mao smiled and said, “Second Prince, Your Highness, speaking of this person, he’s really a mysterious figure! Clearly only has lower Lesser Sublime Heaven strength, but he pulled the Gui Family up by the roots! Even Gui Haisheng died at his hands too. But, what’s even more impressive is that …?huhu,?his heavenly medicine affinity doesn’t even reach one point, and he actually dreams of becoming a heavenly alchemist! Then, he made a bet with this old man, and went into closed-seclusion for 18 years! I’m afraid that he doesn’t have the face to meet people anymore, right?”

After the matter, Gu Mao naturally investigated Ye Yuan.

Some things were not very secretive, with Gu Mao’s status in the imperial city, it was naturally very easy to find out.

There were several renown heavenly alchemists present who guffawed loudly when they heard that.

“Heavenly medicine affinity doesn’t even reach one point??Huhu,?is this someone abandoned by heaven?”

“The scariest isn’t the lack of talent, but the lack of self-awareness! His affinity doesn’t reach one point, and he also wants to become a heavenly alchemist?”

“What a joke, what on earth has he been doing these 18 years?”

… …

One point affinity was simply a joke.

Wanting to become a heavenly alchemist with one point affinity was naturally a joke among jokes.

These people present could not resist mocking even if they did not want to!

“Second Prince also smiled and said,?“Oh??Rather interesting. Tang Yu, this prince wants to meet this big brother of yours. Can I?”

“This … Alright!” Tang Yu toughened his scalp and said.

Now that it came to this, he had no choice either. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He glared at Gu Mao, but the latter had a calm smile and did not care.

… …

“Xiao Qi, is Big Brother still in closed-seclusion?” When Tang Yu arrived at Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion venue, he asked the servant serving Ye Yuan.

Xiao Qi nodded and said, “Yes, Young Master. Yesterday, I just delivered 1000 stalks of Purple Compact Incense to His Excellency.”

Tang Yu nodded his head and said,?“Oh, eh??Isn’t it Dragonbone Grass? Why did it change to Purple Compact Incense?”

Xiao Qi shook her head and said, “Don’t know, His Excellency ordered Xiao Qi, so Xiao Qi complied.”

Tang Yu’s eyes flashed and he said, “Could it be that Big Brother succeeded?”

But very soon, he shook his head again and said with a bitter smile, “How is that possible? Most likely, Big Brother feels that extracting the Dragonbone Grass is hopeless, so he switched heavenly medicines to practice. May as well, after he knows that this is impossible, he should give up.”

Xiao Qi’s gaze flickered and she said, “Young Master, although Dragonbone Grass is the most ordinary spirit medicine, accumulating over so many years, it’s almost comparable to a shop already! If there’s any effect, that’s fine. But, giving someone whose affinity doesn’t even reach one point, it’s purely a waste!”

When Tang Yu heard that, his gaze suddenly became fierce and he said, “Shut up! This kind of thing isn’t what you should butt into! If there’s a next time, end your own life! Scram!”

Xiao Qi was frightened by Tang Yu until she shuddered and scampered away.

How could she know that Tang Yu was afraid of Ye Yuan to the extreme?

If these words were heard by Ye Yuan, the Tang Family might suffer a catastrophic calamity!

Tang Yu arrived outside the door and said respectfully, “Big Brother, I’m Tang Yu!”

“What is it?” After a moment of silence, a voice came from inside.

Tang Yu did not dare to hide it, recounting the matter of Second Prince wanting to meet Ye Yuan.

Before long, the door opened.

Ye Yuan looked at Tang Yu and said coolly, “Let’s go!”

When Tang Yu saw that Ye Yuan did not get angry and was still willing to go and see Second Prince, only then did he let out a long sigh in relief.

Otherwise, he would not know what he should do.

How could he know that Ye Yuan was also feeling emotional in his heart?

What was coming, would ultimately come.

Around 18 years had passed. Jadetrue Heavenly Sect still found Inklight Forest in the end.

It was just that he also had no clue how to resolve this matter. He could only take it one step at a time.

His current strength was too weak!

After the two left, Xiao Qi came to the closed-seclusion area to clean up.

“Someone who doesn’t know his limits,?humph!?In 18 years, how many Dragonbone Grass has been wasted? Clearly only has one point affinity, still want to become a heavenly alchemist?”

She had a stomach full of resentment, entering the closed-seclusion area while cursing away.

What entered her eyes were one dish after another of Dragonbone Grass that had been extracted and placed extremely neatly.

Casually picking up a dish, she said disdainfully, “Just this black thing is also called refinement? Even if I, Xiao Qi, take action, it’s also a hundred times stronger than this!”

The Tang Family operated the heavenly medicine business, everyone from top to bottom knew a little.

Although Xiao Qi was a servant, refining Dragonbone Grass this sort of thing could not stump her.

After all, this was just an entry-level heavenly medicine.

Continuing to enter the room, the disdain on Xiao Qi’s face gradually became solemn, and finally turned into shock!

“T-T-These, are all Dragonbone Grass? How is this possible?”

… …

Seeing Tang Yu bring Ye Yuan in, Gu Mao’s face could not help revealing a smile.

“Yoo,?our one point heavenly alchemist came? How’s the refinement of Dragonbone Grass? This old man has been waiting many years for you to slap my face! Why don’t you slap this old man’s face today in front of Second Prince, His Highness?” Gu Mao said with a smile.

These words naturally attracted a series of guffaws.

“You’re that brat who doesn’t even reach one point affinity??Tsk tsk,?a one point heavenly alchemist, this is going to startle the 33 Heavens!”

“Hahaha,?the history of these 33 Heavens is likely going to be rewritten today!”

“Kid, quickly demonstrate your skill, I can’t wait anymore!”
