Chapter 1297: One Star Heavenly Mark Pill!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan was completely unaware that the Liang Family already viewed him as a fat lamb, planning on assassinating him.

What he had a headache over currently was how to repair his divine essence and let himself recover essence energy.

Divine sea damaged, essence energy utterly lost; Ye Yuan was unable to refine pills at all.

Unable to refine pills, his divine sea would be unable to recover.

This was an endless loop, making his head swell.

Of course, Ye Yuan could be said to be a complete layman towards medicinal pills right now.

The him who triggered Heavenly Dao with Alchemy Dao was a complete and utter layman here.

The current Ye Yuan was sitting in the dark!

“Senior Dustless, I wonder if you have any ways to resolve my current predicament?”

Ye Yuan was helpless and could only turn to Dustless for help.

After all, Dustless followed Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and traversed the Heavenspan World unobstructed. The things that he knew were far more compared to him.

Dustless said huffily, “Know to ask this old man for help now? Back then, I told you not to flaunt your superiority. Now, suffered the fruits of your own evil deeds, right?”

Ye Yuan chuckled, smiled slightly, and said nothing.

Dustless’ punch landing on cotton, he could not help billowing his beard and glared as he said, “Kid, not that I’m scaring you, but your current condition is basically considered crippled already. Not that there’s no method, but for you to want to repair the divine sea, it at least has to wait a hundred years too.”

But Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and said, “It’s good that there’s a way. What does a hundred year’s time count for?”

Dustless said with a cold smile, “Heh, a hundred years is certainly nothing to you. But that little friend of yours can’t wait a hundred years!”

Ye Yuan’s expression instantly became ugly, and he said, “Senior, what do you mean? Could it be that the Soul Suppressing Pearl can’t even maintain Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness for a hundred years’ time?”

Dustless was also helpless as he said, “If I’m at my heyday, forget about 100 years, even a million years isn’t an issue either. But my current state, I can at most last for another ten years, and I’ll fall into a slumber again.”

Ye Yuan’s heart thumped, not expecting that Dustless’s condition was actually bad to such an extent.

He drew a deep breath and said, “Senior, I wonder how can I let you recover strength?”

Dustless sighed and said, “The three great empyrean spirit treasures are connected by blood with Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove. Upon Immortal Grove’s death, the three great empyrean spirit treasures will suffer severe damage. Hence, that’s why this old man fell asleep. Although you let this old man wake up, if you can’t provide sufficient nourishment for this old man, this old man will still decline, all the way until I fall asleep. Originally, absorbing the Deathsoul Tree, it’s also not to the point of falling asleep so quickly. But sustaining the vitality of that little friend of yours needs to consume quite a bit of strength. In my current state, I can at most still last for ten years!”

Only then did Ye Yuan know how serious the state of affairs were.

Once Dustless fell asleep, he would not be able to maintain Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness, and she would die.

Want to let the Soul Suppressing Pearl keep on sustaining, that will require an endless supply of nourishment!

But in his current condition, where would he go to provide nourishment?

Everything had to wait for him to recover his strength before talking.

A ten-year period was merely a snap of a finger in the Heavenspan World. One could not even raise their cultivation by a trace.

This point, Ye Yuan had known long ago. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The cultivation of the martial artists here was easily calculated with 100 thousand years.

Deity Realm powerhouses were merely the Heavenspan World’s ants too.

Only by cultivating to the Divine Lord Realm could it be considered to have minor accomplishment.

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath and opened his mouth to say, “Senior Dustless, what’s the method that you speak of just now?”

At this very moment, Ye Yuan himself was already at the ends of his rope, and could only place hopes on completing the method that Dustless mentioned as soon as possible.

Dustless being so unhappy was also because of this reason.

He had a way, but for the current Ye Yuan to want to complete this method, that was virtually something impossible!

He gave a drawn-out sigh and said, “In the Heavenspan World, there’s a kind of pill refining method called Formation Dao Pill Refinement! Right now, your divine essence is completely gone. Only with this channel, can you refine medicinal pills. With your divine sea’s degree of damage, a low-grade Tier 1 divine pill, One Star Heavenly Mark Pill, is sufficient already. It’s just too bad that both your essence energy realm and Alchemy Dao already broke through to Deity Realm, but your Formation Dao didn’t! Moreover, you’re completely clueless about divine pills. The refining difficulty of divine pills is completely not what mortal-grade medicinal pills can compare to! Forget about 10 years, even if I give you a hundred year’s time, you might not be able to refine a One Star Heavenly Mark Pill too!”

The mystic grade medicinal pill that had once let Ye Yuan command the winds and clouds in the Immortal Grove World, it merely became the mortal-grade medicinal pills from Dustless’ mouth presently.

It was not that Dustless looked down on Ye Yuan. In fact, he already regarded Ye Yuan very highly.

How could Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s pill formulas be so easy to refine?

If ordinary alchemists were able to refine, Dustless would not be so desperate too.

This Jewelhill City had alchemists who could refine the Profound Essence Pill. Worst come to worst, hand the pill formula over to the other party, it could always succeed.

But the problem was, this One Star Heavenly Mark Pill, ordinary alchemists could not refine it at all.

The Profound Essence Pill was not even fit to carry shoes in front of the One Star Heavenly Mark Pill!”

The Profound Essence Pill, as long as one’s realm reached, refining was not hard.

Although a One Star Heavenly Mark Pill was a low-grade Tier 1 divine pill, it required profound understanding towards Alchemy Dao to be able to refine it.

Skill being lacking, it was pointless no matter how high the realm.

Ye Yuan mused for a moment and said with a solemn expression, “Senior, for the average person to become an initial-rank One Star Alchemy God, how long does it normally take?”

The Alchemy God Realm was divided into nine stars. The Profound Essence Pill and One Star Heavenly Mark Pill both belonged to Tier 1 divine pills. One Star Alchemy God could refine already.

Of course, one was an initial-rank Alchemy God, while the other was a high-rank Alchemy God.

Dustless said, “The Alchemy Dao that you understood is merely just a portion of the Heavenly Dao which Immortal Grove comprehended! You were able to trigger the Immortal Grove Heavenly Dao. But in front of the Heavenspan World’s Heavenly Dao, it’s not worth mentioning at all! In the Heavenspan World, Alchemy Dao is even more extensive and profound! For ordinary people, even if their Alchemy Dao talent is exceedingly good, it requires a thousand years’ time too, before they can have a preliminary grasp of the medicinal pill’s refinement, and become a One Star Alchemy God! Hence, in the Heavenspan World, the status of alchemy gods are even higher than in the Immortal Grove World!”

Ye Yuan drew a cold breath when he heard that. Only now, did he know how precious that Profound Essence Pill was!

Ye Yuan merely used 300 years’ time to cultivate to peak Alchemy Emperor back then.

Now, wanting to cultivate to initial-rank One Star Alchemy God actually required a thousand years’ time!

Furthermore, this was even just the most elementary level initial-rank One Star Alchemy God.

Refining a One Star Heavenly Mark Pill, an ordinary initial-rank One Star Alchemy God definitely would not do.

Even though Dustless did not say, Ye Yuan reckoned that wanting to reach the level of being able to refine a One Star Heavenly Mark Pill, it probably needed at least over 2000 years’ time too!

Coming back to his sense from shock, Ye Yuan asked, “Since that’s the case, why does Senior say that this junior requires a hundred years’ time?”

Dustless said, “Of course it’s because of the World Suppressing Stele! You broke through to Deity Realm, you can activate some of the World Suppressing Stele’s functions already. And apart from inscribing the Immortal Grove Heavenly Dao, the World Suppressing Stele’s greatest use is being able to change the flow rate of time!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze sharpened. This function, he had already coveted it for a long time.

He did not expect that he could actually use it already!
