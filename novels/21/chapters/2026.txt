Chapter 2030: The Truth Is More Terrifying Than the Rumors

Everyone’s astonishment was not only expressed in words but also on their face!

Compared to wood-attribute and fire-attribute, thunder-attribute was more explosive and restless. But why did it fuse successfully in the end?

This was Zheng Qiyuan’s doubt and also the question in everyone’s hearts.

The group of Empyreans all used shocked and questioning gazes to look toward Ye Yuan.

“Grandmaster Ye, it really succeeded! It actually really succeeded! This Seven Treasure Cloud Wind Pill, this Empyrean has researched for several hundred years but had no gains. You actually completed the pill formula within a short two days! Truly god-like!”

Empyrean Lumen looked at Ye Yuan with an agitated face, full of disbelief.

Before this, he was the same as the others, also doubting whether or not Ye Yuan had the qualifications to sit here and debate on Dao with them.

It was just that he understood Empyrean Flutterfeather very well and felt that Empyrean Flutterfeather should not mess around like this.

Therefore, he chose to believe.

But he did not expect that this mere Six-star Alchemy God was actually so monstrous, to actually complete the Seven Treasure Cloud Wind Pill’s pill formula in such a short time.

Just based on this, Ye Yuan’s understanding of alchemy already surpassed all of the Seven-star Alchemy Gods present!

Ye Yuan smiled, looked toward Zheng Qiyuan, and said, “Brother Zhen, wonder if this Ye has the qualifications to stand here and debate on Dao with everyone now? Wonder if this Ye has the qualifications or not to turn my nose up toward the provocations of your juniors? Wonder if this Ye has the qualifications to hold this grandmaster token or not?”

A series of three questions was like one heavy hammer after another, knocking onto Zheng Qiyuan’s heart.

Of course, the other Empyreans were actually similarly undergoing grilling in their hearts.

Prior to this, none of them believed Ye Yuan.

But now, Ye Yuan used his strength and gave every one of them a beautiful slap.

Zheng Qiyuan’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He was not able to answer Ye Yuan’s questioning.

Qualified or not?

Of course qualified!

This unfathomable ancient formula, Ye Yuan only used a short two days’ time and completed it.

Could Zheng Qiyuan do it?

Forget about him, even if they all, these dozen over Seven-star Alchemy Gods, added together, discussing in detail for more than a month, they only came up with a wrong spirit medicine.

“I ... I’m not convinced! How can thunder-attribute possibly fuse into a wind-attribute medicinal pill? What effect can it have inside?” Zheng Qiyuan gritted his teeth and said.

Ye Yuan responded with a sneer as he said, “The properties of spirit medicines have never existed alone. It’s true that the Thundercloud Immortal Condensing Fruit is a thunder-attribute spirit medicine, but it likewise contains considerable wind-attribute laws; just nice fitting together with the Seven Treasure Cloud Wind Pill’s other spirit medicines! As for why it’s the Thundercloud Immortal Condensing Fruit, it’s very simple. It’s because among these supplementary medicines, there are more than a dozen spirit medicines that exist for the sake of balancing out the Thundercloud Immortal Condensing Fruit’s thunder-attribute as well as other attributes! Do you understand now?”

Zheng Qiyuan’s pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

This guy actually understood the attributes of spirit medicines so deeply.

Spirit medicines did not have a solitary attribute, this was the general knowledge of an alchemy god.

But what properties did a spirit medicine have? This required an extremely profound understanding of the medicinal properties of spirit medicines.

Furthermore, although spirit medicines did not have solitary properties, inside pill formulas, the vast majority sorted them according to their strongest attributes.

But the Thundercloud Immortal Condensing Fruit actually utilized its subsidiary property. This kind of situation was extremely seldom-seen. It was totally impossible for anyone to have thought of it.

But Ye Yuan actually picked the Thundercloud Immortal Condensing Fruit out of tens of millions of spirit medicines within two days. What kind of terrifying deducing ability was this?!

The people who knew about the Thundercloud Immortal Condensing Fruit’s wind-attribute were exceedingly few to begin with. Those able to think of using it were even fewer.

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan dumbfoundedly with their mouths open. They discovered that Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength far exceeded their imagination.

Eliminating the Element Heart Illusionary Love Grass previously only made everyone view him in a different light.

But now, the gazes when the group of Seven-star Alchemy Gods looked at Ye Yuan with were already filled with admiration!

Empyrean Purplewing’s eyes shined, and he suddenly sighed gloomily and said, “No wonder Brother Flutterfeather gave the grandmaster token to you. Now, this Empyrean is sincerely convinced!”

Empyrean Lumen also sighed with admiration and said, “I didn’t expect to be able to encounter a figure like Grandmaster Ye in this Cloudpill Summit, Lumen has the good fortune of three lifetimes!”

Although Ye Yuan was not able to refine rank seven divine pills, his understanding of alchemy already towered above all of the Empyreans.

How could these Seven-star Alchemy Gods not express admiration?

Alchemy was different from martial arts. In martial arts, powerful strength was powerful strength. Even for a monstrous existence like Ye Yuan, it was also impossible to heaven-defyingly defeat Empyrean powerhouses.

But in alchemy, as long as your understanding of alchemy reached a certain realm, even Seven-star Alchemy Gods also had to candidly admit defeat. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was just that this kind of person was far too few, few to the point where everyone overlooked it.

Ye Yuan’s appearance today shattered all of their understanding.

These Empyreans did not know that Ye Yuan’s ability was even more than what he had shown. Creating a pill formula was something he had done before.

Hence, completing pill formula this sort of thing was naturally nothing difficult for Ye Yuan.

...

The Zheng Family announced permanent withdrawal from the Cloudpill Summit. This matter immediately shook the entire city.

The Zheng Family was a major alchemy ancient family that had tremendous influence in the Southern Border alchemy world. They actually withdrew just like that.

The Cloudpill Summit was the entire Southern Border’s alchemy grand event. Withdrawing out of the Cloudpill Summit was equivalent to being isolated by the Southern Border’s alchemy world.

Why would the Zheng Family’s ancestor do this kind of foolish action?

“Zheng Buqun’s strength is sufficient to rank in the top ten in this session’s Cloudpill Summit. Withdrawing just like this is too bad.”

“Heh, do you guys know? I heard that the Zheng Family withdrawing is because the Zheng Family’s ancestor lost a bet and had no choice but to withdraw.”

“Oh? Who has such great capabilities, to actually make the entire Zheng Family withdraw from the Cloudpill Summit permanently?”

“Who else can it be? Of course it’s that True God Realm Grandmaster Ye! I heard that this Grandmaster Ye completed an ancient formula, overpowering a group of Seven-star Alchemy Gods. The Zheng Family’s ancestor did not believe that Grandmaster Ye could complete the pill formula. Under this bet, he lost!”

“What?! This Grandmaster Ye is really so impressive? Overpowering a bunch of Seven-star Alchemy Gods? My God!”

...

In the city, all sorts of discussions sounded out.

There were no walls without any cracks in the world. The matter that happened in Qiandan Pavilion still spread out in the end, immediately causing a commotion in the entire city.

However, the vast majority of people did not really believe. After all, this sort of thing was too fantastical.

A Six-star Alchemy God actually crushed a bunch of Seven-star Alchemy Gods. Spreading this sort of thing, who would believe it?

Others did not believe it, but titanic waves stirred in Yun Yi’s heart.

The main culprit of this idea was him. Whether or not it was the Zheng Family ancestor’s provocation, he was naturally perfectly clear.

He never dreamed that Ye Yuan actually had such great ability, directly making the entire Zheng Family withdraw from the alchemy stage of the Southern Border!

The youth surnamed Duan asked with an ugly look, “Brother Yun Yi, when Zheng Buqun left, he didn’t even have time to notify us. I say, was this matter really done by that Ye Yuan?”

Yun Yi smiled bitterly and said, “The rumors in the outside world sound fantastical. But ... the truth is more terrifying than the rumors!”
