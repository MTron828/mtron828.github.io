Chapter 2667: Cutting the Ground on Which One Stood on!

“A grade two heavenly alchemist becoming Third Hall Master, our Zhao Family won’t accept it!”

“Yeah, what right does a junior have to ride on top of our heads?”

“So what if true grade heavenly pill? Something that we can’t see or touch, who are you bluffing!”

… …

Families that depended on the three great families also expressed objections one after another. The scene appeared very chaotic.

Heavenly South Pill Hall’s situation was somewhat different from City Lord Manor there.

City Lord Meng Frostwind’s strength already reached half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, overpowering all heroes. No one dared to resist.

Although Meng Frostwind relied rather heavily on Zhao Xun and Wu Jian, the experts within Heavenly South Pill Hall were plentiful as clouds.

Alchemy was not like martial arts; either you die or I perish.

The two hall masters’ strength was indeed stronger than everyone. But the three great family heads’ strengths were similarly extremely strong.

Hence, they held quite heavy authority.

The three great families practically possessed 40% of Heavenly South Pill Hall’s strength.

Although this ratio was not high, it was sufficient to show one’s attitude.

Zhao Xun and Wu Jian really had a feeling like they had incredibly bad luck.

They did not expect that they were actually forced to abdicate!

“Min Nanshan, are you rebelling?” Zhao Xun said furiously.

Min Nanshan still said coolly, “Head Hall Master, our three great families are subordinates of Heavenly South Pill Hall. Examining our consciousness, we respect the two hall masters very much as well. Our action is just for the sake of maintaining Heavenly South’s stability! No matter from which area you look at, this boy doesn’t have the qualifications to be Third Hall Master either!”

Song Tianyang also said, “This boy has unknown origins. Who knows whether or not he’s harboring ill intent or not?”

Zhao Xun’s face fell, and he said in a cold voice, “If this hall master insists that he must be Third Hall Master?”

Min Nanshan’s expression did not change, and he said coolly, “Then our three great families will withdraw from Heavenly South Pill Hall and make a fresh start elsewhere! I reckon that with our three families’ strength, City Lord His Excellency won’t say anything either!”

Murmur!

The audience was in an uproar!

This move was really cutting the ground on which one stood on! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The moment the three great families withdrew, it would be tantamount to bringing away half of Heavenly South Pill Hall’s power.

This power was sufficient to stand up to Heavenly South Pill Hall as an equal already.

This move was a major killing tool!

Zhao Xun also did not expect that Min Nanshan would be so decisive.

Normally, these three great families schemed against each other. He, this Head Hall Master, was seated firmly on the fishing platform, intervening in the situation. There were not too many disagreements.

But now, Ye Yuan’s appearance made these three families fasten up together all at once.

This was rather difficult to deal with.

Zhao Xun could not help looking toward Ye Yuan, his expression seemingly full of apologies.

He also did not expect that things would play out like this.

Rather, it was the latter who had a calm look, as if all these had nothing to do with him.

Suddenly, Ironcore opened his mouth and said, “Two hall masters and family heads, everyone is a part of Heavenly South Pill Hall. Why is there a need to fall out so badly? This Ironcore is incapable, but I have a solution. Wonder if everyone is interested in hearing it?”

Seeing Ironcore open his mouth, Zhao Xun felt abhorred without rhyme or reason.

He originally did not have any conflicts with Ironcore. But the thing that Ironcore had done in Calm South City had indeed disgusted him.

It was just that at this time, he was currently in a difficult position. When Ironcore suddenly said this, he still wanted to hear it.

“Say it!” Zhao Xun said in a solemn voice.

Ironcore smiled and said, “Actually, the three great families have indeed made great contributions to Heavenly South these few years. Especially Family Head Min, he has tremendous strength and is steady and composed. If let him be this Third Hall Master, I believe that none of the people present will say anything. As for this boy, he’s not a part of Heavenly South to begin with. It’s best to have him get lost.”

Zhao Xun’s gaze turned dark, thinking to himself that he must have been blinded by obsession.

How could an ivory tusk come out of a dog’s mouth?

Making Min Nanshan be Third Hall Master and chasing Ye Yuan away, to think that this guy could say that!

Zhao Xun sneered and said, “This is the method that you’re talking about??Huhu,?what qualifications does Min Nanshan have to assume the position of Third Hall Master? After his strength reaches peak grade four heavenly alchemist, we can come and talk again!”

A faint smile still hung on Ironcore’s face.

When Zhao Xun saw this scene, he could not help feeling alarmed.

“Head Hall Master, this Min is untalented, but I gained some enlightenment a while back and already broke through to peak grade four heavenly alchemist not long ago! This Mystic Moon Iceheart Pill was just refined before this Min came.”

As he said, Min Nanshan took a heavenly pill out.

When Zhao Xun saw this heavenly pill, his expression could not help changing wildly.

This heavenly pill’s residual heat had yet to dissipate. Clearly, it was just refined successfully not long ago!

The heavyweights present were all incredibly shocked.

“Mystic Moon Iceheart Pill, that’s a grade four heavenly imperial pill! Family Head Min really broke through!”

“Impressive! Didn’t expect that Family Head Min actually broke through the bottleneck without a sound!”

“With this, probably even Head Hall Master is powerless to turn the tables already! Once the three great families break away, they will likely be able to immediately stand up to Heavenly South Pill Hall as an equal!”

… …

Min Nanshan showing this hand was truly a major killing tool, stunning everyone.

The hallmark of a peak grade four heavenly alchemist was being able to refine heavenly imperial pills!

In this Land of Heavenly South, apart from Zhao Xun and Wu Jian, no one could do it.

Hence, that was how they could become hall masters!

But now, Min Nanshan had likewise done it!

With this, it really became difficult to deal with!

Zhao Xun understood now that these guys were simply long prepared to launch an attack during this banquet.

He also did not expect that making Ye Yuan be Third Hall Master would actually cause such a mighty uproar.

Min Nanshan said coolly, “Two hall masters, this Min wonders if I have the qualifications to be Third Hall Master or not?”

The three great families’ affiliated families, especially the Min Family’s subsidiaries, were all extremely excited.

Family Head Min breaking through was really a piece of massive good news to him!

“Supporting Family Head Min to assume the position of Third Hall Master!”

“Two hall masters, you mustn’t make everyone’s heart turn cold!”

“What capability does this boy have, to dare serve as Third Hall Master?”

… …

To the vast majority of the people, a true grade heavenly pill was too far beyond reach.

They knew that although true grade heavenly pills were good, these pills had nothing to do with them.

Firstly, true grade heavenly pills would definitely be strictly controlled by the two hall masters.

Secondly, even if true grade heavenly pills could be released, the price would also not be what they could bear.

They all heard that Jiang Li spent 68 million heavenly crystals in order to obtain that true grade heavenly pill!

To ordinary martial artists, this was simply not what they could afford to spend.

Ironcore had a pleased look and looked toward Ye Yuan as he said, “Boy, you still have the cheek to stand there? This place is Heavenly South people’s Heavenly South. Scram back to wherever you came from!”

The general trend had already formed, even the two hall masters were powerless to turn the tables too.

In his view, Ye Yuan getting kicked out was already a certainty!

Ye Yuan looked at Ironcore and said with a smile, “After a long time, you finally jumped out!?Uh,?this move of yours is indeed played beautifully. It’s just that it’s too dumb!”

Ironcore smiled coldly and said, “Brat, you’re still boasting shamelessly at this point? You harbor ill intent and sowed discord in Heavenly South Pill Hall! Come, men! Take this boy down!”

“Who dares!” Zhao Xun shouted coldly. The expressions of those guards changed and sure enough. They did not dare to move anymore.

After all, it was Head Hall Master!

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and walked down the platform with a smile.
