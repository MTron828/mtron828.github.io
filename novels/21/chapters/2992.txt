Chapter 2991: You’re Not a Monster!

This was a huge challenge to Ye Yuan too.

He did not have the confidence to escape with his life from under Zhao Yue’s hands.

Even so, he saw the tiniest hint of remnant struggle in Zhao Yue’s eyes.

But he was a Hegemon Realm powerhouse after all!

Not far away, Long Yi and the others were frightened until their legs were trembling, swallowing saliva non-stop.

“After I go in, you all immediately shut off the restrictions. If I die, you guys immediately run away. However far you can run, do so,” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Although he knew that the likelihood of escaping was very low, it was better than sitting passively and awaiting destruction.

Outside the water prison, there was a switch to control the restrictions. One could control it from the outside.

This cage’s restrictions were too powerful. Ye Yuan was unable to pass through it too. It could only be controlled by Scarletplume.

“Ye Yuan, no way! Let’s just charge out! This is too dangerous!” Scarletplume said.

Although the few of them were scared, they still felt incomparably moved in their hearts.

Ye Yuan was using his own life to fight for their slim chance of survival!

They could all feel that this Zhao Yue was very strong.

After going in, once he was let out, his destructive power would definitely be very strong.

But, with Ye Yuan going in alone, it was virtually certain death!

It was not that Ye Yuan was being a hero who liked this sort of solemn melancholy of a brave warrior who would not be returning. But that this matter had to be done by him.

Only he had a glimmer of hope.

If the others went in, that was truly certain death with no hope of survival.

Of course, he was also unreconciled to it in his heart!

He was unwilling to die just like this.

The Divine Dragon Envoy and Bloodless were here, committing crimes that were too numerous to be recorded.

He was long already filled with killing intent in his heart.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “We can’t charge out. Open it!”

Feng Qingxuan did not speak, looking at Ye Yuan from the back, her eyes somewhat misty.

What kind of a man was this!

Others did not know, but Feng Qingxuan had a feeling that as long as he charged out of the water prison, Ye Yuan had a high probability of escaping with his life.

This guy’s methods were too many!

But he did not escape!

Instead, he chose the most dangerous way.

In the next second, the restrictions opened, and Ye Yuan entered the cage like lightning.

Scarletplume instinctively wanted to shut off the restrictions and flew out.

Feng Qingxuan smacked him flying with a slap.

“Feng Qingxuan, what are you doing!” Long Yi roared angrily.

“Either way, we can’t go out either, just die together! Ye Yuan dares to gamble with his life. You all are men too. Are you so cowardly?” Feng Qingxuan said coolly.

The few people all lowered their heads in shame.

“Roar!”

The moment the restrictions opened, Zhao Yue’s roar made everyone start to tremble.

Ye Yuan only felt a pressure that blotted out the skies and covered the earth, pressing over toward him.

Every pore on Ye Yuan’s body was exploding, virtually going to die.

The feeling of facing a Hegemon Realm head-on, it virtually made people crumble.

This was also Ye Yuan’s first time facing such a terrifying existence head-on.

He had seen before many Hegemon Realms, but someone like this, it was really his first time.

At this moment, all actions were futile!

Zhao Yue was too strong!

This kind of might was that kind of primitive barbarity. It was as if he walked over from great antiquity.

Swoosh!

In virtually an instant, Zhao Yue pounced over toward Ye Yuan.

Before even getting close, Ye Yuan was already shocked by Zhao Yue’s powerful aura until he received internal injuries.

Zhao Yue raised his sharp claws. As long as this claw landed lightly, even if Ye Yuan had ten lives, they would also be lost here.

Life was hanging by a thread!

“You are not a monster!” Ye Yuan practically used all the strength in his body to roar these five words out.

Bang!

Ye Yuan’s body flew out like a cannonball, smashing heavily onto the jail door opposite.

“Pffft!”

Ye Yuan’s innards were directly ruptured, spitting out a mouthful of bloody froth.

But fortunately, he was still alive.

Feng Qingxuan and the rest were frightened until their faces turned white.

“Ye Yuan, are you alright?” Feng Qingxuan was about to run over.

“Don’t come over! I … I won’t die!” Ye Yuan struggled to his feet by himself.

“Roar!”

Another roar, Zhao Yue already stepped out of the cage.

The ferocious tiger had been unleashed!

Zhao Yue’s gaze was locked firmly onto Ye Yuan.

“W-Was that the power of origin just now?” Long Yi said in shock.

Scarletplume nodded and said, “There’s no mistake. That’s the origin of blood! Furthermore, it seems to be different from that origin in Hegemon Bloodless’s body! The origin of blood in Ye Yuan’s body seems to be purer and … higher level!”

Long Yi said in surprise, “Emperor Cloud Heaven comprehended the power of origin … T-This guy’s trump cards really emerge in endless streams!”

Scarletplume also said in astonishment, “Looking at him challenging mountains back then, he didn’t use his full strength at all! What he used, were all dragon race means! Brother Ye is really an unmatched monster!”

The tiger’s body trembling, making a Hegemon Realm submit?

It did not exist!

Zhao Yue’s hesitation at the last moment was because of the origin of blood in Ye Yuan’s body!

Of course, ‘you are not a monster,’ these five words, had indeed struck the softest spot in the depths of Zhao Yue’s heart.

His sanity was virtually non-existent, but he ultimately still retained the tiniest trace of humanity.

What was the struggle, the anguish, in the depths of his heart for?

It was because everyone viewed him as a monster!

If he had already completely had his consciousness die out, Ye Yuan’s words naturally would not have an effect.

But, as long as he still had a tiny, tiny trace, then these five words would be very crucial!

And the release of blood origin made Zhao Yue’s body instinctively understand.

In his body, those disorderly bloodlines that were mingling and clashing together were being controlled!

Ye Yuan wanted to tell him:?I can let you not suffer the pain of bloodline havoc anymore.

This was giving him hope!

Under the combination of the two factors, Zhao Yue stopped at the final juncture.

However, he was ultimately just a ‘wild animal’!

Hence, Ye Yuan still nearly died.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

The underground water prison was shaking until it was almost crumbling.

Zhao Yue was in great pain currently!

Ye Yuan dragged his heavily injured body and walked toward Zhao Yue.

“You are not a monster! You’re the same as me, a human!”

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue roared again. A tremendous force transmitted over, Ye Yuan was sent flying once more.

The current Ye Yuan was incomparably miserable. However, he still insisted on getting to his feet and continued walking toward Zhao Yue.

By the side, the hearts of Feng Qingxuan and the rest were practically leaping out of their throats.

This was truly dancing on the edge of death!

If Zhao Yue wanted to kill Ye Yuan, it would really just be a matter of batting an eyelid.

“You are not a monster! If even you yourself gave up, then you’ll really be hopeless!”

“Are you reconciled to it? Are you willing to let those people who turned you into this have their way?”

“Roar!”

A typhoon swept over. Ye Yuan was directly swept up into the sky, smashing heavily onto the ceiling and falling onto the ground again.

If it were anyone else, they would not even have the strength to get to their feet currently.

But Ye Yuan did not give up. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He got to his feet and walked toward Zhao Yue again.

Each sentence from him came from the bottom of his heart.

He saw Zhao Yue’s agony. He also saw the pain of countless people like Zhao Yue.

Compared to those people, perhaps Zhao Yue was fortunate instead.

At least he survived.

“You’ve already suffered pain that others can’t endure and survived. Could it be that you want to give up on yourself?”

“No matter what you become, as long as your heart doesn’t change, you’re a human!” Ye Yuan looked at Zhao Yue, his eyes incomparably sincere.

Feng Qingxuan, Long Yi, and the rest were extremely moved too.

It was because they all felt Ye Yuan’s sincerity!

He was not making use of Zhao Yue. He genuinely wanted to save this monster!

They felt incredulous. If it were them, they absolutely could not do it.

This kind of monster, they felt disgusted just by taking a look.

As if moved by Ye Yuan’s sincerity, Zhao Yue did not attack Ye Yuan this time.

“Believe me. I can turn you back into your original appearance!”

Ye Yuan walked in front of Zhao Yue, placed his hand on top of his head, and gently stroked him.

Feng Qingxuan and the rest opened their eyes wide. Zhao Yue actually became quiet!
