Chapter 2356: Caged Battle!

Second place, Wan Zhen, 4.34 million god of war points!

Third place, Zhang Lian, 3.21 million god of war points!

Fourth place, Gu Tianzhen, 2.12 million god of war points!

... ...

The God of War Golden List slowly unfolded, one name after another displaying in front of everybody.

The top ten names were finally decided as well.

Some rejoiced, some bemoaned. With Ye Yuan climbing to the top, there were naturally people who were eliminated.

In the crowd, several murderous gazes shot toward him.

Of course, Ye Yuan did not care at all.

Seeing this result, Wan Zhen himself was very surprised too.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan really did it!

Ten years ago, Ye Yuan never made it onto the God of War Golden List!

A gap of more than four million was caught up just like that.

Honestly speaking, he was still a little sour in his heart.

“Younger Brother Ye, you actually obtained 540 god of war points in this last year!” Wan Zhen looked at Ye Yuan and exclaimed.

Even though several hundred thousand a year was very impressive, this sudden eruption in the last year clearly still exceeded everyone’s expectations.

Ye Yuan said, “I had some new insights during this year again, and so I made a trip to the Celestial Beast Plain. That’s how I gained more than 500 thousand god of war points.”

Wan Zhen’s entire body trembled and he sucked in a cold breath as he said, “You went to the Celestial Beast Plain?”

“What?! He ... He actually went to the Celestial Beast Plain!”

“He’s really a mad man! The Celestial Beast Plain is the central region of the Myriad Beast Battle Plain. Each one of the fierce beasts is incomparably powerful. He could actually come back alive from there!”

“Not that no one dares to go to the Celestial Beast Plain, but that no one can go there!”

... ...

The moment these words came out, everyone revealed extremely shocked expressions.

The Myriad Beast Battle Plain’s area was extremely vast. But the more towards the central region, the stronger the strength of the fierce beasts.

Furthermore, the fierce beasts of the central region were very densely packed. Wanting to rush to the central region from the periphery of the Myriad Beast Battle Plain was simply an impossible task.

Even Wan Zhen could not do it either!

He and Zhang Lian also continuously went deep into the central region but failed to reach the Celestial Beast Plain in the end too.

But Ye Yuan reached it.

In reality, before being transported back just now, he was still undergoing a life-and-death battle in the Celestial Beast Plain.

Everyone suddenly somewhat understood why Ye Yuan was able to soar at a rate of 400 to 500 thousand god of war points every year.

Being able to rush into the Celestial Beast Plain, this in itself already illustrated many problems.

In reality, Ye Yuan had made great improvements in these ten years’ time too.

Regardless of whether it was Sword Dao source or Formation Dao source, or whether spatial law, time law, he had an extremely deep understanding.

Under this kind of high-intensity battle, his potential was excavated once again.

Furthermore, after he finished taking care of a swarm, he would continue advancing forward, all the way until he reached the Celestial Beast Plain.

However, the strength of the fierce beasts in the Celestial Beast Plain was also indeed extraordinary.

Even he felt extremely strained too.

If not for his spatial law breaking through to rank eight at the final juncture, it would also not have been impossible that he would fall in battle and return to Cloudaid City.

“You this fellow, really a freak! I really want to know what kind of boundary you’ve reached currently!” Wan Zhen said with a bitter smile.

“There will be an opportunity,” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

Everyone looked with gazes as if looking at a monster to look at Ye Yuan. This guy simply was not a human!

Just as everyone was exclaiming with admiration, there was suddenly a tremor in the void.

A huge cage broke out of the sky and suspended in the air.

At this moment, the million unpredictable children in the Primeval War Realm could see this enormous cage distinctly.

For a moment, there was shock all around! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What’s this playing at again?”

“Could it be that the genius competition this time hasn’t ended yet?”

“Isn’t it said that as long as people entered the top ten, they can all obtain the inheritances? Could it be that it isn’t like this?”

... ...

Just as everyone was shocked, the figures of Ye Yuan and the rest gradually became illusory.

When they appeared again, they had already arrived in the cage.

There were also many strangers who appeared at the same time.

Sweeping a glance over, there were just a thousand people!

The top ten of each city all gathered in the cage!

“Hiss ...”

Everyone drew a cold breath.

Gathering the top 1000 people together, this was going to be a melee!

Suddenly, a voice came out of the void. It was precisely Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s voice.

“This is your final test, a caged battle! This time, there are no restrictions. Bring out all of your means, and kill the people around you! The last person alive shall obtain a supreme inheritance! The next 10 people will obtain a top inheritance! The rest of the people will obtain an ordinary inheritance! Now, the killing begins!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ voice was akin to rolling thunder, exploding in everyone’s ears.

However, those unpredictable children were clearly all not prepared.

Even Ye Yuan had a stunned look too.

He heard Jian Yunxin say before that there were ten top inheritances, but he did not know that there was still a supreme inheritance.

Wonder what kind of terrifying legacy this so-called supreme inheritance was.

However ... a thousand of the top-notch unpredictable children were all gathered in one cage now. This would really be a terrifying bloody battle.

To think that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets could come up with such a perverse idea.

However, Ye Yuan understood very well.

Because in the future, these unpredictable children would definitely encounter this kind of scenario!

At that time, they might encounter even more and even stronger divine race powerhouses.

This kind of melee, just treat it as a preview in advance.

Dying in this caged battle now, they could still come back to life.

But in the future, when they faced divine race powerhouses, they would not be able to come back to life.

A little more preparation was considered to have a process of adapting in advance, right?

Ye Yuan turned to look at Wan Zhen beside him and could not help laughing as he said, “You see, I said that there will be an opportunity, right?”

Wan Zhen laughed loudly and said, “I didn’t expect that it came so quickly! Okay, let me experience what right you have to walk in the Celestial Beast Plain!”

At this instant, Wan Zhen brimmed with fighting spirit.

Even though he knew that Ye Yuan was very strong, and also knew that Ye Yuan had many trump cards, he had his own pride. He also had absolute confidence in himself.

Therefore, he did not think that he would lose to Ye Yuan.

Who was stronger and who was weaker, got to fight before one would know.

By the side, Zhang Lian rolled his eyes and said, “The two of you fight then. I’m not getting involved. I’m not Wan Zhen’s match. If you lose, the two of us fight then.”

“Ahhh!!”

Suddenly, a scream came from beside them. There was actually someone who was killed already.

The battle came suddenly.

In an instant, the flames of war started burning in the cage.

Bang, bang, bang ...

Waves of terrifying energy undulation exploded in the cage.

This cage was clearly specially made. Even if a thousand unpredictable children fought frenziedly, they were unable to break this cage too.

At this time, several unpredictable children not far away saw that Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was low. They immediately rushed over toward him.

“Brat, really don’t know how you came in. Your city is too weak! Sending you on your way then!” An unpredictable child grinned sinisterly and rushed over towards Ye Yuan.

However, he discovered to his horror that his speed of advancement became slower and slower, increasingly slower.

His pupils constricted, and he cried out in shock, “T-Time law!”
