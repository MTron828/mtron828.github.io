Chapter 2741: Corrupt Corpse!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The current Taoist Wu Fang was showing off a lot.

If it was an ordinary Saint Exalt true spirit, it would naturally have smacked him to death with a slap. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But these Saint Exalt true spirits did not have intelligence, so it was different.

Previously, Taoist Wu Fang was chased by this Saint Exalt true spirit until there was no road to heaven and no gate into the earth.

Who knew that he actually broke through to half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven at the final juncture, his origin divinity improving greatly, and his spirit controlling art also broke through the shackles.

He tussled with this Saint Exalt true spirit for half a month and finally subdued him.

The faces of all the Saint Exalts became black as the bottom of a pot.

Each and every one of them suffered heavy losses, but this guy got off cheap!

“Congratulations, Brother Wu Fang! Brother Wu Fang has excellent means, to actually subdue a Saint Exalt true spirit!”

Right at this time, a figure rode on a large yellow bull and floated down.

The moment Ye Yuan appeared, a series of murderous gazes looked over simultaneously with a whoosh.

Especially the 13 Saint Exalt powerhouses, they wished to swallow Ye Yuan whole at this time.

Ye Yuan did not take notice of these people’s gazes, going straight to Wu Fang’s side.

Each of these guys was incomparably insidious. If he did not scheme against them, he would have to be schemed against by them.

“Heh heh, double congratulations! Didn’t you break through too? Mn? Saint Exalt Big Yellow broke through too!”

Wu Fang suddenly discovered that Big Yellow’s aura was significantly stronger than before and could not help being surprised.

This was also too fast!

Saint Sovereign Heaven, breaking through so much at once, it was not what everyone could accomplish.

Saying this, the other Saint Exalts also could not help but wake up, each and every one of their faces becoming even blacker.

Without a doubt, Big Yellow only broke through after swallowing those heavenly medicines!

Damn it!

They suffered such heavy losses and actually did not get any benefits at all!

As for the matter of Ye Yuan breaking through to middle Jade Sovereign Heaven, it was directly ignored by them.

In this place, middle Jade Sovereign Heaven was really unexceptional.

Saint Exalt Waycloud was unreconciled to it in his heart and said in a cold voice, “Brat, you still dare to come, do you really take it that we, these Saint Sovereign Heavens, are vegetarians?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Not that you guys are vegetarians, but that you should have eaten quite a bit of meat, right? Why? Still want to taste it? I can lure them over again.”

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s face turned black, but he instantly shut up.

Saint Exalt Skyfortune gave a cold snort and said, “Forget it, the truly good stuff should be in the Labyrinth Divine Palace. There is no need to haggle over things with him! After entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace, this exalt wants to see whether or not he can still be so arrogant!”

Ye Yuan gave an ‘oh’ and said, “Then you guys can give it a try and see.”

At this time, a weak voice behind Ye Yuan said: “That ... Brother Ye, I’ve gathered the Four Qi Pill’s heavenly medicines, can you ...”

Ye Yuan turned around to look and it was Shi Yue.

He already knew that Big Yellow was a Saint Exalt powerhouse, so he naturally did not dare to be unbridled in front of Ye Yuan.

This time, Shi Yue’s luck was better and he was not hunted down by the Saint Exalt true spirits.

Furthermore, in the panic, he also found another small-sized medicinal land, and actually collected the Four Qi Pill’s heavenly medicines.

At this time, he tested it out, to see if what Ye Yuan said counted.

When Ye Yuan saw him, he revealed a hint of surprise too.

This guy really gathered them.

But he did not decline and said with a nod, “Of course, there’s no problem!”

Very soon, the expressions of the Saint Exalts changed.

“Ninth grade perfection!”

“Grade four heavenly imperial pill! This strength, most likely, there’s only the Pill Alliance’s top elders that can achieve it, right?”

“I think I somewhat understand why Saint Exalt Big Yellow wants to follow him!”

... ...

Seeing the freshly produced ninth grade perfection Four Qi Pill, all of the Saint Exalts were extremely shocked.

To be able to refine a heavenly imperial pill to this level, he was absolutely an expert among experts!

One had to know, being able to refine the Four Qi Pill to ninth grade perfection, even Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses had to show sufficient respect to such a heavenly alchemist too!

Some Saint Exalts were somewhat dumbfounded. They actually offended such an existence!

Shi Yue held the Four Qi Pill, feeling agitated until he was trembling.

He just wanted seventh grade. In the end, Ye Yuan actually gave him ninth grade perfection!

This medicinal effect, the gap was not an ordinary kind of big!

Watching Shi Yue broke through to half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, the remaining Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were envious to the extreme.

Why did they brave death to trespass this Labyrinth Divine Palace? Wasn’t it in order to break through cultivation realm and increase their strength?

During this period of time, more and more Jade Sovereign Heavens also gathered outside of the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

The group of Saint Exalt powerhouses did not enter the Labyrinth Divine Palace rashly, because they needed cannon fodders too.

The Labyrinth Divine Palace before their eyes was a huge group of palaces. Although they were extremely dilapidated, it gave people a very dangerous feeling.

Saint Exalts cherished their lives and were naturally not willing to enter easily.

“It’s around there. Let’s go in! The restrictions outside of this Labyrinth Divine Palace have long been broken, but everyone should be more careful,” Saint Exalt Skyfortune suddenly said.

Everyone nodded one after another, all looking solemn.

Clearly, they all sensed the danger.

Ye Yuan was not melodramatic either, following the main force into the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

Upon entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace, a threatening corrupt energy hit them head-on.

The corrupt energy had turned corporeal as if blades cutting on the face.

“What a strong corrupt energy!” Ye Yuan exclaimed.

“When the Labyrinth Divine Palace was at its prime, their disciples surpassed a million! The weakest was also the realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven! Such a colossal sect being destroyed, there are countless resentful souls. What does this bit of corrupt energy count as? The Labyrinth Divine Palace that you guys entered is just the tip of the iceberg of the true Labyrinth Divine Palace! If you really reach the place where the real mountain pass gate is, the corrupt energy can directly wipe you all out!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan also felt shocked when he heard it.

A million disciples!

The weakest was Saint Sovereign Heaven!

This kind of sect was simply unimaginable.

One had to know, a Saint Sovereign Heaven could virtually do whatever they wanted to in the Rainclear Continent.

“This isn’t the real mountain pass gates?” Ye Yuan suddenly remembered something and asked.

“Of course not! With your bit of strength, how can you all find the true Labyrinth Divine Palace’s mountain pass gates? This group of palaces doesn’t even count as the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s outer-sect! If you really go to the mountain pass gates, I can’t protect you either! Maybe even if a grain of dust falls down from the roof, you’ll die,” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan was speechless when he heard it, this was also too exaggerated.

“No idea where the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation is either,” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

This palace was too big, he even felt a little lost when he entered.

Yan Jadetrue only said Voidsnap Immortal Condensation but did not tell the location.

But, come to think of it, it was in a very dangerous place too.

Otherwise, with Yan Jadetrue’s strength back then, it was impossible to not have gotten it.

“ARGH!!”

“ARGH!!”

... ...

Everyone did not walk far when suddenly, several miserable screams came from behind.

The group of powerhouses were greatly alarmed and discovered that several Jade Sovereign Heavens were already killed by someone with one sword.

Everyone’s faces changed, and they discovered that since God knows when, there were actually several dozen more ‘people’ behind them!

These ‘people’ wore uniforms and held standard long swords in their hands, their movements very swift.

They looked human, but their eyes and mouth emitted black smoke, looking very sinister and scary.

The Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses reacted to it too, taking action one after another.

Those able to come here alive were at least upper Jade Sovereign Heaven. Their strength was not weak.

But, when they made a move to deal with these guys, there were only clanking sounds that were made. They could not leave the slightest scar at all!

Someone said, “The corrupt energy here is too strong. These corpses have been flooded with corrupt energy and are impervious to swords and spears, and they became corrupt corpses!”
