Chapter 2691: It No Longer Belongs to You!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What happened? Weren’t these water dragons summoned by Black Flood Dragon King? Why did they attack him instead?”

“He is a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven expert, but he was actually struck back several thousand feet by the water dragons that he summoned! This is simply something unheard of.”

“I seemed to have seen Ye Yuan use a spell just now. But isn’t the Emerald Sea Divine Conch the Thistle South Royal Clan’s lifeblood treasure?”

… …

He could not figure it out after racking his brains!

Ever since the Black Flood Dragon King obtained the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, he could be said to have shocked the seven great sea regions.

This kind of grandmist treasure was extremely rare in the seven great sea regions too.

But now, this thing was actually not listening to orders anymore!

And the one who was the most shocked was none other than Black Flood Dragon King.

He had already obtained the Emerald Sea Divine Conch for ten thousand years and had long already refined it into his own item.

But just earlier, he actually lost control of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch!

He was unable to understand how Ye Yuan did it!

Just now, Ye Yuan being weak made Black Flood Dragon King realize that it was the best opportunity to make a move and capture Ye Yuan. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

But who would have expected that Ye Yuan actually still had such a contingency move!

The most important thing was that he examined his own heart and felt that he never showed any hostility all along. But that scene earlier, it was as if Ye Yuan had long expected it.

Virtually right as he made a move, Ye Yuan took countermeasures.

Why?

Ye Yuan looked at Black Flood Dragon King and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Finally can’t refrain from making a move? I even thought that you were planning on returning to the dragon palace before taking action.”

Only then did Black Flood Dragon King confirm that Ye Yuan really knew about it long ago, and took precautions in advance!

His brows furrowed slightly and he said, “This king is certain that I’ve never shown hostility before. How did you know?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Still remember my breakthrough before entering the Land of Dragon Slumber? Very unfortunately, I entered a state of emptiness at that time and became perfectly aware of everything here. At that time, I detected it.”

Black Flood Dragon King’s face fell, secretly regretting it.

If he had long known that it would be like this, he would not have let Ye Yuan enter the Land of Dragon Slumber.

But back then, Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was too low.

Even if he extracted the dragon marrow, he also did not dare guarantee that he would be able to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Who would have thought that this sudden turn of events would actually occur?

“Royal Father, Big Brother Ye Yuan is a good person! Why do you want to kill him?” Little Dragon Girl mumbled, her expression unhappy.

Black Flood Dragon King snorted coldly and said, “At this point, there’s nothing to hide anymore as well! Although this kind obtained considerable lucky chances in the Land of Dragon Slumber, I still haven’t been able to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven. The dragon marrow in this boy’s body is a great tonic to this king! As long as this king fuses with his dragon marrow, I’ll naturally be able to pierce through this last layer of window pane paper!”

Only when everyone heard that did they come to a realization!

Ye Yuan was also taken aback. He even thought that him ruining the sea war made Black Flood Dragon King bear hatred in his heart. He did not expect that he was actually eyeing the bloodline power in his body.

“Boy, since you already know, you should have some awareness, right? Offer your dragon marrow, and this king can spare your life. In fact, I can even let you be an idle dragon king in the Thistle South Sea Region and spend the second half of your life in comfort,” Black Flood Dragon King said coolly.

Although this scene earlier was very surprising, he was a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven at any rate too.

Even if he did not utilize the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, just by relying on his own strength, he was terrifying to the extreme too. He naturally would not think that Ye Yuan could escape.

Moreover, it was not just him alone who wanted to kill Ye Yuan here!

Ye Yuan’s gaze also turned slightly chilly, the dragon marrow was essential to the dragon race!

Bloodline power was born from the dragon marrow.

Without the dragon marrow, it would be equivalent to the martial artist losing their small world; still cultivate what shit!

Although it was not fatal, it would be tantamount to ruining the future of a martial artist.

Not killing someone, but even scarier than killing someone.

“Royal Father, how can you do this?” Little Dragon Girl said angrily.

Black Flood Dragon King snorted coldly and said, “Jingfei, after Royal Father fuses with the dragon marrow and breaks through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, I’ll be this seven great sea regions’ true king! At that time, you’ll be the seven seas princess!”

“I don’t want to be whatever seven seas princess! I only want Big Brother Ye Yuan! You can’t kill him!” Little Dragon Girl said stubbornly.

Black Flood Dragon King frowned and said, “That’s not up to you! Black Shark, take her away!”

“I’m not going! I’m not going!”

Little Dragon Girl had a stubborn look and was about to urge the Emerald Sea Divine Conch.

But she discovered that the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was solid as a rock. She could not control it at all.

She was still a little too weak in front of Black Flood Dragon King.

Without the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, her being restrained by Black Shark was also within reason.

Finished with these, Black Flood Dragon King looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Boy, looks like you really obtained quite a lot in the Land of Dragon Slumber, to actually be able to reverse-control the Emerald Sea Divine Conch! But, even if this king doesn’t use the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, do you think that you can escape?”

Boom!

The moment Black Flood Dragon King’s aura released, that terrifying pressure made the faces of everyone present change abruptly.

He was a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven expert. An expert of such realm was absolutely apex existences in the seven great sea regions.

They rarely made a move. Hence, these dragon sons could be considered to have broadened their horizons looking at one making a move.

But Ye Yuan did not care at all and said with a grin, “If you’re using the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, I’ll use it then!”

Black Flood Dragon King was taken aback and could not help laughing as he said, “You want to use it? What do you base on to use it? I’ve refined the Emerald Sea Divine Conch for 12 thousand years, it has long already fused into one with me!”

And just as he was talking, Ye Yuan already started forming seals.

Black Flood Dragon King was currently talking by himself when suddenly, his expression changed.

The Emerald Sea Divine Conch actually had an impulse to break free from his body.

He suddenly discovered that he could not quite control the Emerald Sea Divine Conch anymore.

In order to not get counter-controlled by Ye Yuan, he already hid the Emerald Sea Divine Conch inside his body just now.

“Damn it! You … How did you do it?”

Black Flood Dragon King’s expression changed wildly. He desperately appealed to the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, but his control over it was still being lost bit by bit.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch actually flew out of the Black Flood Dragon King’s body!

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces changed.

“This … How is this possible? Black Flood Dragon King is actually unable to control the Emerald Sea Divine Conch!”

“Just what kind of fortuitous encounter did that boy obtain in the Land of Dragon Slumber?”

“Snatched away! I-It’s really snatched away!”

… …

The Emerald Sea Divine Conch turned into a streak of light and actually flew straight toward Ye Yuan, suspending in front of him.

Black Flood Dragon King’s face was gloomy to the extreme.

Because he discovered that the connection between him and the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was completely severed!

In these ten thousand years, it was still the first time that such a thing happened.

Once this level of treasures was finished refining, then it would fuse into one with him. Unless he was killed, otherwise, it would not be able to be stripped at all.

But Ye Yuan actually did it!

Ye Yuan looked at Black Flood Dragon King and said coolly, “The Emerald Sea Divine Conch originated from the Land of Dragon Slumber to begin with. Letting you use it for so many years, it’s also considered a blessing to you. Today, I’ll take it back! It no longer belongs to you!”

As he said, Ye Yuan formed seals again.

The imprint that Black Flood Dragon King left behind in the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was actually directly wiped away.

“Pffft!”

Black Flood Dragon King seemed to have suffered a serious injury, directly spewing out a mouthful of blood.

Clearly, his mind already suffered damage.

He looked at Ye Yuan, with a pair of angry eyes almost, seemingly wanting to incinerate Ye Yuan..
