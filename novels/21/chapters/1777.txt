1781 Two Choices

On a broad avenue, Ye Yuan was currently walking forward slowly.

On the streets, many martial artists were in groups or walking alone.

The auras on these people were not weak, they were actually all Divine Lord Realm powerhouses!

Ye Yuan knew that they were going to the Shadowmoon Sect to take part in the sect assessment. He was also the same.

Ye Yuan learned from Sikong Xiu’s sea of consciousness that among True God level sects, only the Shadowmoon Sect was currently recruiting new disciples.

There were still roughly 200 years until the next Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.

Ye Yuan needed to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm as soon as possible within these 200 years.

Those taking part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave must be at the Celestial Deity Realm.

And Ye Yuan seemed to still have a very long way to go to the Celestial Deity Realm.

In the previous few years, Ye Yuan had been immersed in Alchemy Dao all along, and his Martial Dao did not progress much.

Over these 200 years, Ye Yuan planned to cultivate with all his might, and strive to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm as soon as possible.

“Hey, little brother, which sect are you from? You seem like a new face here!”

Perhaps a burly man felt bored and moved close to Ye Yuan’s side and walked alongside him.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I came from a Divine Lord level small sect. It doesn’t have much reputation.”

The burly man smiled and said, “So that’s how it is. No wonder your strength is so weak. With your strength, it’s probably very difficult to pass the Shadowmoon sect’s entrance examination!”

Ye Yuan secretly smiled in his heart. This guy’s personality was very straightforward.

But he could also tell that this man was a straightforward character. Whatever he had, he would say, without going through his brain at all.

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “I’m just here to give it try. After all, my original sect already doesn’t have anything that I can continue to learn about.”

The burly man said, “Makes sense, for you to be able to cultivate to your current realm at a Divine Lord level small sect, it’s indeed very not easy already. However, the geniuses capable of entering the Shadowmoon Sect are all one in a million. If you want to pass the entrance examination, you’ll probably have to take several hundred more years.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Mn, if it doesn’t work out, I’ll do miscellaneous work in the Shadowmoon Sect. When my strength is sufficient, I’ll come and take part in the entrance examination again.”

The Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s territory was vast, sects standing in great numbers. These dozen over True God level sects were leviathans.

But there were still many Celestial Deity level sects and Divine Lord level sects. After these sects’ geniuses had some accomplishments, many people would choose to enter higher-level sects.

Firstly, their own sect already did not have much room for development for them anymore. Staying would only waste time.

Secondly, after these disciples entered True God level sects, once they learned something, they would take better care of their own sect.

Hence, those going to take part in the Shadowmoon Sect’s examination were mostly True God level disciples.

Of course, there were also some small sects’ disciples who were mostly unknown and were also not too likely to pass the assessment.

The burly man’s words were not without basis.

It was just that he did not know that Ye Yuan’s combat power was far from comparable to same rank martial artists.

The burly man smiled and said, “Haha, I came from the Thundercloud Sect. I’m called Han Yong. In the future, if anyone dares to bully you, give me their names.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks, Brother Han. I’m Ye Yuan.”

The two people were currently chatting when a burst of ridicule suddenly came from the side.

“Hahaha, Han Yong, you also don’t take a piss and look in the reflection yourself, just the likes of you also dare to take care of people? I’m bullying him now, so do you dare to cover him?”

Ye Yuan looked sideways and saw three youths in bright clothing looking at Han Yong with a smile that was not a smile, having a look of ridicule on their faces.

These three people were very similar between the eyebrows. One look and they were three brothers.

When Han Yong saw these three people, his expression could not help changing. He said in a solemn voice, “Zhao Xi, what are you being cocky for? If you have the ability, come over by yourself. I guarantee that I won’t beat you to death!”

Han Yong turned around and whispered to Ye Yuan, “This is Zhao Zhao, Zhao Shu, and Zhao Xi, three brothers, originating from Devil Elephant Sect. They are sworn enemies of our Thundercloud Sect.”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he immediately understood in his heart.

Zhao Xi said with disdain when he heard this, “You’re merely a hair stronger than me. You aren’t even a match for my second brother. Yet, you still dare to be insolent in front of us three brothers? Your Thundercloud Sect is really trash, just sending a good-for-nothing like you out. You can only put on a front in front of some small sects.”

The words angered Han Yong until his expression turned livid.

Zhao Xi three brothers were extremely talented. The three people’s strength had always advanced at the same rate.

Zhao Xi was slightly weaker, also peak Seventh Firmament Divine Lord.

The other two were Eighth Firmament Divine Lords!

Han Yong’s talent was actually really good. He just recently became an Eighth Firmament Divine Lord. It was just that in front of these three brothers, it was still a little worse.

“Zhao Xi, you dare to insult my Thundercloud sect? If you have the balls, fight one-on-one with me!” Han Yong did not dare to challenge the three of them and could only use words to goad Zhao Xi.

But Zhao Xi only smiled and said, “After entering the Shadowmoon Sect, there’s plenty of time to fight one-on-one. But right now ... heh heh, didn’t you say that you’re covering for this kid? Now, I’m going to bully him. I want to see what you use to shield him with. I’m going to let everybody take a look at how trashy your Thundercloud Sect is. What kind of strength you have, you don’t have any idea yourself. Haven’t even entered the sect and you dare to cover people!”

Han Yong’s expression changed and he said to Ye Yuan, “Ye Yuan, I was the one who harmed you. You quickly go! I’ll block him!”

But Zhao Shu laughed and said, “Isn’t it too late to leave now? Your opponent is me!”

Zhao Shu’s figure moved, directly facing off with Han Yong.

Han Yong’s strength was a notch weaker than Zhao Shu’s. With his match up, he could only accept the challenge passively.

If he wanted to run, he could naturally escape. But if he ran, Ye Yuan facing the Zhao trio brothers by himself, then the consequences would be too ghastly to imagine.

Zhao Xi slowly walked to Ye Yuan and said with an amused look, “Kid, you’re actually not running away. Are you scared silly? Heh heh, don’t blame me for bullying me. Want to blame someone, blame Han Yong. Who asked that guy to like to posture?”

Ye Yuan himself also felt baffled. Walking along the streets, he could actually get into such trouble too.

However, Zhao Xi’s strength, he did not take it seriously yet.

If he did not provoke him and bickered a few sentences with Han Yong, then forget it. Yet, he wanted to come to provoke him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ye Yuan could only sigh in his heart: wouldn’t die if didn’t court death.

“Everyone is going to take part in the Shadowmoon Sect’s examination. We’ll all be fellow apprentices in the future, why is there a need to end up like this?” Ye Yuan said with a helpless look.

Regarding this kind of lame fight, he was indeed disinclined to take part in it.

As long as Zhao Xi himself pulled back, he would not stoop to the other party’s level too.

Zhao Xi laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Fellow apprentices? Hahaha, brat, you’re thinking too much! With just the likes of your bit of strength, you also want to pass the Shadowmoon Sect’s examination? You and I are never of the same world! Hence, there’s no way we’ll be fellow apprentices!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “Then?”

Zhao Xi sneered and said, “Kid, I have to admire your nerves. Now, I’ll give you two choices, number one, kneel down and yell ‘Thundercloud Sect is trash’ three times. Second, I’ll cripple your cultivation, break both your legs, and let you crawl to the Shadowmoon Sect.”
