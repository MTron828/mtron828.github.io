Chapter 2067: Northernmost Steppe

Returning to the City Lord Manor, Ye Yuan was too impatient to wait to interrogate Senior Apprentice Sister Xun and the rest.

Lu-er’s departure was a thousand years ago without news.

Over these 1000 years, Ye Yuan was constantly worried about her news.

It was just that the Heavenspan World was so big, so where would Ye Yuan go and find?

Now, he finally managed to hear Lu-er’s news. Ye Yuan’s emotion had been uneasy since then.

Moreover, he even knew that this piece of news definitely would not be too good.

Ning Tianping dragged Senior Apprentice Sister Xun and threw her in front of Ye Yuan. Senior Apprentice Sister Xun started coughing fiercely.

Huan Yi and the rest looked at Ye Yuan with terrified faces, full of disbelief.

This man in front of them was too powerful. One punch had beaten Senior Apprentice Sister Xun to heavy injuries.

“Speak! Where’s Lu-er now? I hope that you all don’t force me to search your souls!” Ye Yuan looked at Senior Apprentice Sister Xun and said coldly.

“Cough, cough ... your realm isn’t even as high as mine. Want to use soul searching art on this young lady? Cough, cough ... bring it on!” Senior Apprentice Sister Xun said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan’s realm was not as high as hers, so his divine soul was naturally not as strong as hers.

If he cast soul-search, not only would it not succeed, it would harm his own divine soul instead.

Ye Yuan’s face fell and he said, “Since that’s the case, you go and die then!”

Presumably, this woman never did anything good for Lu-er too. If killed, then killed. Ye Yuan did not have any psychological burden.

An ocean-like soul force poured out of Ye Yuan’s mind sea.

The faces of the few girls changed wildly, only then knowing that Ye Yuan was not joking around.

Breaking through the last time, Ye Yuan absorbed the Sea of Law, his divine soul already reached the limit of True God Realm.

“Stop! I’ll say! I’ll say!” Senior Apprentice Sister Xun screamed.

“Too late!”

Ye Yuan did not give her the chance at all, directly attacking Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s mind-sea.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s divine soul attacked in retaliation frenziedly. Ye Yuan just gave a cold snort, the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s power suddenly poured out, instantly tearing down all of her resistance.

Ye Yuan did not have the slightest sympathy, reading Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s divine soul roughly.

One scene after another flashed across in Ye Yuan’s mind. The more he looked, the angrier he got.

It turned out that the Northern Border had a region called Northernmost Steppe. That place was a land of bitter coldness, factions complicated and complex. Things were not well-defined like the Southern Border, belonging to some Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda.

That place was a no man’s land. Heavenly Emperors did not have any interest in this region at all. Hence, it was divided up by major and minor forces. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

But as a matter of fact, there were nine great Empyrean-level factions that were the strongest here.

This Ice Cloud Tower was one of the Empyrean-level forces.

Roughly a thousand years ago, Lu-er appeared at the Northernmost Steppe by some unknown means and was taken fancy on by the Ice Cloud Tower’s master. She was then taken in as a disciple.

Back then, Lu-er was merely Heaven Glimpse Realm, but the Ice Cloud Tower’s cultivation method was extremely suitable for Lu-er.

By relying on the Profound Yin Divine Physique, her cultivation speed was extremely fast.

Over a thousand years, she already cultivated to True God Realm. At present, she was already a Fifth Firmament True God powerhouse.

Of course, this was also all thanks to Ye Yuan.

Back then, he helped Lu-er’s Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian to improve further with divine pills, evolving to become the Profound Yin Divine Physique. That was how there was the present Lu-er.

But walking along this path, Lu-er suffered considerable hardships.

This Senior Apprentice Sister Xun was envious that not only was Lu-er pretty, but her cultivation talent was also even extremely high.

In fact, back then, because Lu-er violated a rule, she hung Lu-er up to beat, beating until Lu-er nearly died.

If not for Second Senior Sister helping out later, Ye Yuan probably would not be able to see Lu-er anymore.

Of course, although this Senior Apprentice Sister Xun was jealous, she only listened to others.

The one who really wanted to deal with Lu-er was Eldest Senior Sister, He Xiangyun!

As for that Ice Cloud Tower’s master, she had an attitude of letting things take their course.

Although this Ice Cloud Tower’s was a female force, under the environment of the Northernmost Steppe, they were mostly self-centered, and would not care about the life and death of the people below at all.

In this Ice Cloud Tower, to really talk about treating Lu-er well, there was only Second Senior Sister, Yang Fei-er.

This time, the reason why Xun Qingling came to find Ye Yuan was because another of the Northernmost Steppe’s Empyrean-level force’s young lord took fancy on Lu-er, intimidating the Ice Cloud Tower’s tower master with threats and beguiling with benefits, making her marry Lu-er to him.

The Ice Cloud Tower’s master could not resist the temptation and finally still agreed.

It was just that Lu-er threatened to die. That was how the Ice Cloud Tower’s master did not succeed.

Lu-er’s thoughts were pure and her feelings for Ye Yuan were known by Eldest Senior Sister He Xiangyun long ago. Hence, she suggested to the Ice Cloud Tower’s master to capture Ye Yuan to threaten Lu-er, and force Lu-er to give in.

The moment the Ice Cloud Tower’s master heard this, she was overjoyed and immediately allowed it.

Because she knew that the place Ye Yuan was at was merely an imperial city, so sending Xun Qingling over was already more than sufficient.

It was just that the Ice Cloud Tower’s master never dreamed that with Ye Yuan’s present strength, killing Xun Qingling was merely a matter of flicking a finger.

Moreover, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s strength at present was not the slightest bit weaker than Ice Cloud Tower.

What was laughable was that Xun Qingling and co. thought that they were powerful and came over to capture people without even making inquiries, resulting in being directly annihilated by Ye Yuan.

“You all, very good!”

When he said this, Ye Yuan’s teeth creaked from grinding.

When the Ning Tianping and Bai Chen by the side saw this scene, they could not help secretly being speechless.

They did not know what Ye Yuan saw in Xun Qingling’s divine soul, but they rarely saw such a furious expression on Ye Yuan before. It could be seen that Ye Yuan was already enraged to the extreme.

“Y-Your Excellency spare our lives!” How could the few girls still have any proud appearance? They were already terrified to the extreme.

“Heh, this Ye isn’t someone who kills indiscriminately. It’s just that you all normally treated Lu-er like that, so you can’t be spared!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan waved a hand. Several streaks of sword energy fired out, directly blasting the four people to mere residue.

These four people were all Xun Qingling’s accomplices. In these 1000 years, there were no few instances of bullying Lu-er and even quite a few times of harming Lu-er to death. How could Ye Yuan spare them?

After killing four people, Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath, forcefully calmed down, and said, “Invite Senior Bai Tong they all over.”

Hearing that Ye Yuan was going to the northern land, everyone was very worried.

After all, arriving at that sort of place, no one knew Grandmaster Ye.

If anything mishap happened, that would not be good.

Bai Tong frowned and said, “Why not ... I go together with you.”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “At present, Heavenly Eagle has just stabilized. Forces everywhere are casting covetous eyes, so there must be an Empyrean-level powerhouse holding down the fort. All of you stay. Just Tianping following me will do.”

Bring Bai Tong over would naturally be much more secure.

But the Southern Border was not calm and tranquil. Empyrean Pilljade and the rest were all casting covetous eyes. Without an Empyrean-level powerhouse holding down the fort, Ye Yuan could not set his mind at rest.

Through several years of seesawing and negotiations, the Myriad Treasure Tower and Heavenly Eagle joined the Southern Border Alliance once more.

With this battle, the Myriad Treasure Tower was naturally the greatest beneficiary, but Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s limelight was the brightest.

As the saying went, the winds howl around the highest peaks, it was impossible for Empyrean Pilljade they all to willingly be suppressed just like this. Perhaps some troubles would occur.

Bai Tong was not just an Empyrean powerhouse, but a Seven-star Alchemy God too. With him garrisoning Heavenly Eagle, Ye Yuan could naturally be much more reassured.

“Yun Yi, when Master isn’t around, this land of Southridge will be presided over by you. If you encounter anything that can’t be resolved, consult Senior Bai, understood?” Ye Yuan instructed.

Yun Yi nodded and said, “Yes, Master!”

After arranging everything for Heavenly Eagle, Ye Yuan brought along Ning Tianping. The two embarked on the journey to the Northernmost Steppe.
