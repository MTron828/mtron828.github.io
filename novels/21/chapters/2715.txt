Chapter 2721: Returning to Heavenly South!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What? He … He’s Master Ye?”

“What a joke! A lower Jade Sovereign Heaven created six great saint exalts and even made Saint Exalt Bull Demon break through?”

“But, being able to make six great saint exalts so respectful, who else can it be if it isn’t him?”

“Your Father thought of a million possibilities, but the only thing that I didn’t think of is that what let six great saint exalts break through was actually a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven!”

… …

The actions of the six great saint exalts caused an uproar in the entire Myriad Spirits Summit.

Prior to this, the outside world had many speculations.

But no matter what, no one could have predicted that the initiator of all this was actually a lower Jade Sovereign heaven!

Not saying that Jade Sovereign Heavens could not do it, but that Jade Sovereign Heaven to Saint Sovereign Heaven, this step in itself was already incredibly difficult.

What right did he have to be able to let so many powerhouses break through?

But the reactions of the six great saint exalts were also truly telling them that it was Ye Yuan!

If it was a joke, then this joke would be too much!

How noble was the status of a saint exalt powerhouse?

Even if it was Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s order, they believed that it was impossible for the six great saint exalts to coordinate this play too.

Giant Ape two people stared dumbfoundedly.

While Saint Exalt Bull Demon laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha,?I knew that you guys would have this expression! Do you guys know that when this exalt saw Younger Brother Ye’s methods back then, my expression looked exactly like yours!”

“B-But how is this possible?” Saint Exalt Giant Ape still did not dare to believe it as he said.

“Nothing is impossible! You all are simply unable to imagine Younger Brother Ye’s methods!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said with a smile.

Over there, when Ye Yuan saw the six people, he smiled and said, “All of you broke through. I’ve also fulfilled my promise back then!”

Bright Tiger said in fear and trepidation, “It was us who had eyes but couldn’t see, almost harming Master Ye’s life. Sinful, sinful!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Who can resist the lucky chance of Saint Sovereign Heaven? That wasn’t your fault.”

Although the six people broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, their respect toward Ye Yuan grew even more.

Firstly, Ye Yuan repaid evil with good. The quality of the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill that he gave them was extremely high without skimping out at all.

Secondly, they already knew now that Saint Sovereign Heavens had to face the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation.

There were still many areas to rely on Ye Yuan in the future.

This was also the reason why heavenly alchemists were respected by all.

“Younger Brother Ye came at the right time, this exalt will announce it together! This exalt will assume responsibility of the All-Saint Temple’s temple lord! Younger Brother Ye will be this All-Saint Temple’s honorary temple lord, all authority and interests being equal to this exalt!”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon came down to personally receive Ye Yuan. Grabbing hold of his wrist, he pulled him to sit down beside him.

Ye Yuan had a baffled look too. But it sounded pretty good.

There was naturally no one who dared to have objections.

The Myriad Spirits Summit ended. All the true spirits dispersed. Saint Exalt Giant Ape could not hold back anymore as well.

“Brother Ye, this exalt has prepared a small gift, please accept it.” Giant Ape took out a spatial bracelet and handed it over to Ye Yuan with a smile.

“Brother Ye, inside here is virtually all of this exalt’s assets! If you’re interested in it, this exalt wants to request a heavenly pill from you!” Great Roc was not willing to show weakness too as he said.

These two have also put down blood capital in order to obtain Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill.

Ye Yuan smiled and pushed the gifts back and said, “Two saint exalts, this Ye doesn’t want your things!”

When the two heard that, their expressions could not help changing drastically.

“Brother Ye, what this old bull can give you, we can also give you! Why do this?” Saint Exalt Giant Ape said in puzzlement.

His gift was prepared according to the standard of grade five heavenly alchemist.

To Ye Yuan this Jade Sovereign Heaven, it definitely had sufficient appeal.

But who knew that Ye Yuan actually did not even look at it!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I can help you all refine heavenly pills and I don’t want your gifts either. I just want you guys to owe me a favor! When I need your help, you all need to help me take action once!”

Even a fool also knew that this favor was probably not easy to repay!

However, no matter how difficult it was to repay, it was also better than dying under the Dao Tribulation!

Therefore, the two did not hesitate in the slightest and agreed.

After Giant Ape two people obtained Ye Yuan’s promise, they were not willing to stay a second longer and immediately took their leave and left.

Time was important for one’s cultivation realm!

“Younger Brother Ye, what are your plans next?” Saint Exalt Bull Demon asked.

Ye Yuan said, “I plan on making a trip back to Heavenly South first. Then, I’ll set off for the Five Great Heavenly Regions.”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon nodded his head and said,?“Mn,?whatever you need big brother to help with, feel free to speak up! Your business is big brother’s business!”

He was not a fool. Ye Yuan rejected Giant Ape two people’s astronomical gifts and only exchanged for a favor.

He must be shouldering a lot on him!

Ye Yuan was not melodramatic either, saying with a smile, “Big Brother rest assured. This younger brother won’t be courteous!”

After spending a long time together, Ye Yuan more or less had some understanding of Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s disposition.

Although he was powerful, his personality was straightforward and was not disagreeable; very easy to get along with.

He showed great kindness to him, he naturally would not look on with folded arms.

Bright Tiger opened his mouth and said, “Since Master Ye wants to return to Heavenly South, the five of us will also go together! After all, the five of us have committed many evil deeds in Heavenly South. We can take this chance to go and make an apology to them this time!”

Ye Yuan naturally had no reason to not allow this request.

He had to give an explanation to the lives that died in vain in Heavenly South.

After several days, Ye Yuan brought the five great saint exalts and set off for the road back to Heavenly South.

… …

In a deep mountain at the borders of Heavenly South, all of a sudden, an astonishing aura rose to the sky.

The terrifying pressure made the birds and beasts scatter everywhere.

Above the sky, a phenomenon descended from heaven. It was precisely the signs of having broken through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Half a month later, a figure rose to the sky and let out a wild laugh!

That laughter shook until heaven and earth changed colors.

“Hahaha?… I, Meng Frostwind, have finally taken this step! This is Saint Sovereign Heaven! What a miraculous power! I feel that with a wave of my hand now. It’s Heavenly Dao! Bright Tiger, the five of you animals hunted this exalt down until there was no road to heaven and no gate into the earth! Today, this exalt stepped into Saint Sovereign Heaven, I’ll definitely make you all pay a terrible price!”

This powerhouse who broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven was precisely the Heavenly South City Lord, Meng Frostwind, who used despicable means back then and scammed the five great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens!

He consumed the Sacred Destiny Pill and experienced 50 years of bitter cultivation in closed-seclusion. Finally, he gained sudden enlightenment and stepped into his long cherished goal of Saint Sovereign Heaven! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Actually, he naturally knew about the five great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens leading an army to bathe Heavenly South in blood.

At that time, he had not found the place to enter closed-seclusion yet and was currently wandering around in the Land of Heavenly South.

But he did not come forward. He let the Land of Heavenly South to have blood flow in rivers!

According to his plans, after he broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, he would find the five people again to take revenge!

Meng Frostwind’s gaze looked in the direction of Heavenly South City and said in a solemn voice, “50 years have passed. I don’t know how many people are still remaining in Heavenly South City! This exalt has become an exalted Saint Sovereign now. It won’t be considered too late to rally my forces and start afresh! I’ll go recapture the Land of Heavenly South first, and then march troops northward. I’ll let these guys have a taste of a bloodbath too!”

Thinking up to here, he no longer remained, his figure leaping and disappearing into the horizon.
