Chapter 2333: Fall of a Sovereign!

Ye Yuan being conferred ancestor shocked the entire alchemy world!

There was no idea how many human powerhouses, it was naturally impossible to all come to Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma.

Concerning Ye Yuan spreading his Dao, there were still some who were disdainful.

But when they knew that all of the progenitors including Sacred Ancestor High Priest, actually jointly revered Ye Yuan as an ancestor, their shock could not be any greater.

A brat who was still wet behind his ears, actually became the alchemy path’s common ancestor?

No matter how great their influence was, they could not change this fact either.

No matter how great their influence was, could it be greater than so many progenitors?

The title of Ancestor Ye had already become an established fact!

His limelight even overshadowed the Medicine Ancestor back then!

During this period, inside a certain small world, above a quiet lake, a scrawny old man was sitting cross-legged.

Streams of immortal qi coiled around him, forming a circular aura field.

The circular aura field divided into two, circulating endlessly. That appearance ... was actually somewhat similar to Ye Yuan’s Tai Chi diagram!

No matter how the aura field revolved, the surface of the lake was calm from start to end. It could be seen that the old man was not ordinary.

Before long, another figure landed on the surface of the lake.

He gave a bow toward the old man and said, “Master!

This old man was precisely the Medicine Ancestor who went missing after the Cloudheart Realm battle!

And the person who just appeared was the Eldest Disciple who went missing along with him. It was Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy!

Medicine Ancestor nodded slightly and said coolly, “What events are there at the outside world?”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy smiled and said, “The divine race army is bearing upon the borders. Ye Yuan is conferred the status of an ancestor!”

Medicine Ancestor smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “A child also dares to conceitly call himself as an ancestor!”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy said, “It was not that he proclaimed himself as an ancestor, but that all the progenitors exalted him as an ancestor. Now, he’s already the common ancestor of the alchemy path!”

Medicine Ancestor’s entire body trembled, his eyes full of astonishment.

One had to know, he had roamed the Heavenspan World unobstructed for countless years, and also did not become the alchemy path’s common ancestor.

But Ye Yuan did it!

Immediately, an extremely complicated emotion welled up in his heart.

“Heh,

terrific lad! Fine means! However, he’s also underestimating this ancestor too much! His Dao has inspired this ancestor greatly. As long as I digest his Dao, this ancestor will definitely be able to reach the true realm of Dao pill! When this ancestor comes into being anew, I’ll make the myriad regions tremble! This ancestor is the common ancestor of the alchemy path!”

Puff!

Right at this time, a hand plunged into his chest.

Medicine Ancestor’s entire body was paralyzed, immediately unable to move.

At the same time, he felt his strength flowing away bit by bit.

He looked at Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy with a look of disbelief.

In this world, the one that he trusted the most was Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy!

But Lastingjoy struck a vicious blow towards him!

He did not understand it. He did not believe it. He felt that it was inconceivable.

“W-Why?”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s hand was thrust in Medicine Ancestor’s chest, still smiling as he said, “If there’s only one person in this world who can achieve Dao pill, then it can only be me! I served you carefully; it’s for the sake of today! Absorbing your Dao, I’ll be the real Medicine Ancestor! Go in peace. Everything that you lost, I’ll help you take it back!”

Medicine Ancestor’s entire body was unable to move. He only felt that his Dao was slipping away little by little.

He looked at Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy. It was as if it was his first day knowing him.

This guy could actually absorb his Dao!

Medicine Ancestor discovered that he underestimated Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy too much.

The anesthetic in Lastingjoy’s hands, with his body that was close to Dao, he was actually unable to dispel it.

Gradually, Medicine Ancestor’s aura grew weaker and weaker.

Finally, he turned into a pool of blood.

A sovereign of his generation who had commanded the Heavenspan World for countless years, a figure almost like a Dao Ancestor, actually died in a small world that no one knew just like that!

While at this time, the Great Dao aura on Lastingjoy’s body gradually became thicker.

A hint of a smile flashed across the corners of his mouth and he said, “These countless years, I’ve concealed so bitterly! I devoured other people’s Dao non-stop, continuously became stronger, and finally stepped into the realm of Dao pill. Absorbing this old thing’s Dao, I’ll be the strongest alchemy path sovereign in this world! Ye Yuan that brat’s Dao must be even more delicious. After I absorb his Dao, I’ll be the alchemy path’s number one person since time immemorial! At that time, maybe I can reach Dao Ancestor that level; who knows?! Really looking forward to it!”

It turned out that Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy actually walked an extremely strange path of Alchemy Dao.

His Dao was to continuously devour other people’s Dao!

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was a figure from the same era as Medicine Ancestor. His alchemy path talent was ordinary, but he was an eccentric genius-like figure.

Following Medicine Ancestor, he had witnessed countless alchemy path geniuses.

Hence, he devoured non-stop, continuously becoming stronger. He actually reached the realm of Dao pill in the end!

However, he concealed it extremely well. Even Medicine Ancestor did not detect it either. Medicine Ancestor trusted him immensely instead.

Now, he even devoured Medicine Ancestor’s Dao, truly becoming the alchemy path’s number one person.

Even the current Ye Yuan was inferior to him too!

Now, he set his sights on Ye Yuan again!

During this period, the Ye Yuan who had just been conferred ancestor, already embarked on the road to the Primeval War Realm.

... ...

Profound Secrets Heavenly Capital, the place where Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets stood toweringly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This was an enigmatic figure, and also a legendary figure.

Of course, he was also a figure who was powerful until it made people despair!

Arriving at Profound Secrets Heavenly Capital, Ye Yuan was deeply shocked.

The Jian Family was too strong!

Those walking around everywhere here were all at least True God Realm powerhouses!

Heavenly Emperor and Empyreans who were hard to come across in the outside world, could be seen everywhere here!

Only then did Ye Yuan know that it turns out that only those members of the Jian Family who were second-rate, would be sent out.

“No wonder everyone says that the Jian Family is the Heavenspan World’s number one family. This grandeur was indeed not boasted out!” Ye Yuan exclaimed.

“Huhu, I’ve incurred Young Friend Ye’s ridicule!”

At this time, a figure appeared behind Ye Yuan. It was precisely Jian Yunxin.

Ye Yuan bowed and said, “Senior!”

Jian Yunxin smiled and said, “Huhu, congratulations to Young Friend Ye, for being conferred the status of an ancestor! Ancestor Ye is already a member of my generation now. You don’t need to be so courteous.”

Ye Yuan being conferred ancestor was a huge thing in the alchemy world.

But in the eyes of a powerhouse like Jian Yunxin, it was nothing.

Presently, the human race’s alchemy path was too weak. It could not provide much help for the Doomsday Battle at all.

What the Jian Family thought highly of was still Ye Yuan’s unparalleled combat power!

Hence, he still addressed Ye Yuan as Young Friend Ye Yuan.

Regarding the matter of being conferred the title ancestor, it was merely just being polite.

Ye Yuan was aware in his heart but did not say much.

It was a fact that the alchemy path had declined, it was pointless to say anymore.

Otherwise, how could it be him, this junior’s turn, to be called ancestor?

However, Ye Yuan had confidence in being able to make the alchemy path regain its glory in the future!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior is jesting. Please bring me to the Primeval War Realm then.”

Jian Yunxin smiled and said, “No rush. Father wants to see you!”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he said in surprise, “Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets wants to see me?”

He thought that he was merely an ordinary genius in the eyes of the Jian Family’s people.

After all, no matter how amazing he was, he should not have been able to enter Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s arcane sight.

He did not expect that the human race sovereign, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, actually wanted to see him!

Jian Yunxin nodded and said, “Father thinks very highly of you. He says that you’ll surely make great accomplishments. Young Friend Ye, this emperor has followed Father for close to ten billion years. Yet, it’s still my first time seeing him value a junior so highly. The battle of geniuses this time, you have to perform well and not let Father down!”
