Chapter 2456: Don’t Dare to Keep Me Around!

“Freaking hell! Even if the uncle can tolerate it, the aunt can’t endure it! This punk actually dared to even scold Lord Tian Qing!”

“He ... He’s actually making Lord Tian Qing get lost! Lord Tian Qing, kill him!”

“What on earth is Lord Tian Qing afraid of? In this world, apart from Dao Ancestors, who else can make Lord Tian Qing fearful?”

... ...

After the death-like silence, the entire Heaven Lineage exploded.

The Heaven Lineage’s powerhouses were all filled with righteous indignation, furious to the extreme.

Tian Qing was the god in their hearts, the divine race’s one and only Ten-marks powerhouse!

This guy actually dared to make him get lost!

Tian Qing’s expression flickered indeterminately, similarly wishing to smack the gray-pupil Ye Yuan to death with one slap.

But he knew the consequences of smacking this slap down!

This boy was about to break through right away. If really annoyed him, he reckoned that even late-stage Nine-marks would not be able to survive.

Forcibly suppressing the anger in his heart, Tian Qing frowned and said, “You aren’t going to transcend the blight tribulation! What kind of cultivation method are you cultivating?”

After calming down, Tian Qing suddenly thought of something and could not resist asking.

The current commotion was completely not the scene of transcending the Deva blight tribulation.

He suddenly remembered those words that Daymeld said after he was rescued.

At that time, he did not pay attention to it yet, but now, he discovered that something seemed to be a little off about Ye Yuan.

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan gave Tian Qing a glance coldly again and said impatiently, “Are you stupid? If I’m transcending the Deva blight tribulation, will I do it right under your eyelids? As for what cultivation method I’m cultivating, you don’t need to care! You just have to know it’s very strong!”

Tian Qing was speechless

Spiritual energy surged, the gray-pupil Ye Yuan already reached the critical moment of breakthrough.

Hence, he said coldly again, “Still not getting lost? Do you want me to kill people while breaking through?”

Tian Qing could not let out a single word.

This gray-pupil Ye Yuan was really not cute at all!

Tian Qing turned around angrily and left, making everyone’s jaws drop.

Including Progenitor Tian Xing, his eyeballs were almost popping out.

Lord Tian Qing was cussed out by a human junior and actually turned around and left without even letting out a fart?

Was this still the Lord Tian Qing that they know?

Tian Qing turned his nose up at the world and was peerlessly unparalleled, fighting through the nine heavens and ten earths. When had he been scolded like this by someone before?

Immediately, a sense of humiliation rose up in the hearts of each divine race powerhouse.

Seeing Tian Qing come over, Tian Xing went up to receive, and gnashed his teeth in hatred as he said, “Lord Tian Qing, this ... Just why is this!”

Tian Qing let out a sigh and said, “I can’t kill him, but he can kill you all! This person is ruthless. If we provoke this person, he’ll kill off the Heaven Lineage!”

“Hiss ...”

Tian Xing drew a cold breath and said with a shocked face, “In that case, the news that came from the human race is true?”

As the Heaven Lineage’s upper echelon, Progenitor Tian Xing naturally knew about Ye Yuan’s affairs.

At first, he felt that the likelihood of this matter being rumors snowballing was greater.

How could someone possibly escape from under the hands of the nine great Dao Ancestors?

Even if it was the eternal Saint Azure, it would not work too!

Tian Qing nodded his head slightly and said, “I’ve already confirmed it! Furthermore, his main soul was sucked away by the Eight Extreme Divinities. Right now, this God knows what the hell this existence is doesn’t have the slightest feeling. He’s more tricky than that one!”

When the surrounding powerhouses heard this scene, each and every one of them was unbelievably shocked.

There was actually such a monstrous person in this world!

No one could have thought that Progenitor Tian Qing actually really made a move before already.

More importantly, he could not do anything to Ye Yuan!

No wonder Progenitor Tian Qing would issue such an order.

Progenitor Tian Xin’s complexion was ashen as he said, “This ... This guy is also too strange! His divine soul was sucked away and another divine soul actually appeared again? Also, the cultivation method that he cultivates actually doesn’t need to transcend the Deva blight tribulation! No wonder there would be that kind of rumor!”

The rumor that he was talking about was naturally referring to Ye Yuan being able to break the shackles of Dao Ancestor.

Judging from the current situation, it was really not impossible!

Tian Qing’s brows also furrowed slightly, the staunchness in his heart suddenly weakening that tiny trace.

He originally did not believe that Ye Yuan could surpass him.

But now, the strangeness that Ye Yuan exhibited really made people feel lacking in confidence.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan started breaking through.

The berserk spiritual energy seemed like a surging tsunami, rolling over toward the direction of the gray-pupil Ye Yuan.

A storm raged fiercely!

However, the gray-pupil Ye Yuan did not refuse any!

No matter how much spiritual energy surged over, he accepted it all!

With regards to the ninth level of the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, Creation Realm and its spiritual energy absorption, it made one’s hair stand on end!

Inside the chaos world, the architecture of mountains and rivers, lakes and seas, the sun, the moon, and the stars, became clearer and clearer, and increasingly brighter.

When Tian Qing and the rest of the divine race saw this scene, each and every one of them was dumbstruck with amazement.

They had once ruled the Heavenspan World and understood the human race’s cultivation method extremely well.

It was just that, they searched through their memories and also could not find which human major power had such a heaven-shocking breakthrough effect.

If not Deva Realm, then what on earth was it?

Tian Qing’s brows were knitted tightly and he murmured, “His world power is so strong! Although his world domain isn’t big, this progenitor actually has a feeling of facing the divinities!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Tian Qing’s comprehension of Heavenly Dao was extremely deep.

There was likely no one who could surpass him in this world.

Even Dao Ancestors could not as well.

Therefore, he was extremely sensitive to the world power that Ye Yuan released.

Ye Yuan breaking through, the power of the world spread out, making him have a feeling of facing ‘heaven’!

He never had this kind of feeling before!

Progenitor Tian Xing’s expression changed greatly and he said, “This ... This is impossible, right? How can someone possibly reach the height of the divinities in this world?”

Tian Qing shook his head slightly and said, “Perhaps, it’s my misconception. However, his cultivation method is indeed very strange. He actually doesn’t need to transcend the Deva blight tribulation! Furthermore, looking at his appearance, after breaking through this time, I’m afraid that ordinary late-stage Nine-marks won’t be his match anymore too.”

Rumble ...

All of a sudden, the earth quaked and mountains swayed.

This space actually started shaking violently.

Progenitor Tian Xing’s expression changed and he turned to look in the direction of the ancestral land.

“This ... What’s going on here?”

Tian Qing’s expression became even uglier and he said absent-mindedly, “It’s the direction of the ancestral land! C-Could it be that he really came out? This ... How is this possible?”

He had lived for countless years and experienced countless things.

But all of it added up was also not as shocking as what he had experienced in this past one year.

Swoosh!

A blurry gray figure came whizzing from the direction of the ancestral land.

In a blink of an eye, he arrived in front of everyone.

A figure stood with his hands behind his back, standing not far from Tian Qing.

Tian Qing’s expression became extremely solemn, looking at the gray figure in front of him with a frown.

He actually could not quite see through this divine soul in front of him!

It was clearly Ye Yuan’s divine soul in front of him.

But it was completely different from before!

As for the specifics of what the difference was, he could not put it into words as well, but it was just different.

“You ... You really came out! How did you do it?” Tian Qing said in shock.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said coolly, “That guy didn’t dare to keep me around, and he forcibly chased me out.”
