Chapter 1391 The Sage Stone

This move, Sundering Stars, was just Ye Yuan’s comprehensions in the Sword Tomb’s first two levels.

At that time, he was comprehending in the second level, finally triggering the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s reaction, forming the elementary form of a Sword Dao martial technique.

Ye Yuan used a year’s time to continuously perfect, only then, was there Sundering Stars.

However, the first two levels’ Sword Dao laws were far from the extent of reaching grand completion Sword Dao first-layered heaven.

For Sundering Stars to have such power, on the one hand, it was because of the strength of the martial technique itself.

While on the other hand, it was because of the powerful cultivation method that Ye Yuan trained in!

“So that’s how it is! Ye Yuan, the reason I’m finding you today, you’ve probably also guessed a bit. Since your martial technique originated from the Sword Tomb, then it should remain in the Wu Meng Academy, so as to benefit those who come after. Of course, the academy will also give considerable compensation. I wonder if you’re willing?” Wen Yiyang slowly said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “That is, of course! I’ve already imprinted Sundering Stars’ key secrets and my Sword Dao comprehensions these few years onto these two pieces of heavenly star jades.”

While talking, Ye Yuan retrieved two pieces of heavenly star jades and passed them to Wen Yiyang.

Clearly, Wen Yiyang did not expect that Ye Yuan was so straightforward, and was absent-minded for a while before receiving the heavenly star jades.

Past students, making them have over the cultivation method that they comprehended themselves, most of them cherished their own belongings and were not willing to surrender them.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually even prepared the heavenly star jades.

Wen Yiyang had observed Ye Yuan for a long time already. But only meeting Ye Yuan today did he know that this youth in front of him was different from the rest.

Meticulous thoughts, straight to the point when doing things, without the least bit of hesitation and sloppiness!

Even harder to come by was that Ye Yuan’s comprehension ability was abnormally high, talent surpassing others. He was far from those geniuses in the academy could compare to.

Wen Yiyang sunk his divine sense into the heavenly star jade and briefly skimmed it over. The expression on his face gradually became solemn.

Rank one martial techniques were all too simple to Wen Yiyang.

With his realm, even if it was an unfamiliar martial technique, it did not expend much effort for him to use it either.

But this Sundering Stars actually gave him a feeling of obscureness and difficult to understand.

For a moment, he was actually unable to pry into its depths!

This shock was naturally by no means insignificant!

“Mn, not bad! Very good! Indeed a strange and marvelous idea! Ye Yuan, you actually have such comprehension ability at a young age. It’s truly hard to come by!” Wen Yiyang put on an act and praised it.

He was a half-step Divine Lord mighty expert after all. How could he be willing to lose face in front of a student and say that he actually did not quite understand?

Later, he planned on properly studying this martial technique.

A martial technique that even he did not understand had indeed aroused his desire to win.

Ye Yuan said respectfully, “Many thanks for Academy Head’s praise. Disciple was lucky too.”

Ye Yuan naturally knew that he was pretending to be like this. Although Sundering Stars was just a Sword Dao first-layered heaven martial technique, it mixed in the Dao accumulations of the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, as well as the crystallization of Wu Meng Academy’s countless predecessors’ hard work. How could it be that easy to understand?

If it was that simple, on what basis could he defeat the half-step Heaven Glimpse Qin Shao with jus entered late-stage Grotto Profound strength?

Furthermore, although divine inscriptions could depict Heavenly Dao, when portraying it, there were bound to be some losses.

The inheritance could be understood, but it could not be expressed with words one could easily understand. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Only by truly comprehending the deep meaning in it could one unleash its full power.

Hence, Ye Yuan was actually not worried about this skill spreading.

He was almost certain that in Wu Meng Academy at present, there was absolutely no one who could truly comprehend this martial technique.

“Ye Yuan, how about this? Because Sundering Stars isn’t complete, after I report to City Lord, His Excellency, later, we’ll temporarily set it as a quasi-supreme academy skill. As for the reward, it will be given to you as the standard of supreme academy skill, 100 thousand points! What do you think?”

Although Wen Yiyang spoke in a discussing tone, it actually left no room for doubt already.

Furthermore, 100 thousand points were really quite a bit in Wu Meng Academy already.

With these 100 thousand points, he basically locked in as first place on the outer-court’s points stone already.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then I’ll have to thank Academy Head very much! However, can I trouble Academy Head to help me exchange for some spirit medicines?”

Wen Yiyang was stupefied and said, “Spirit medicines? Can’t you just directly go and exchange for them?”

Ye Yuan said, “The quantity that I require is relatively large. Furthermore, some spirit medicines are not common. If I go and exchange myself ...”

The moment Wen Yiyang heard, he understood and said with a nod, “Alright then, later, you get a list for me.”

Ye Yuan took out another piece of jade slip and said, “I’ve already prepared it.”

Wen Yiyang froze again and could not refrain from laughing in spite of himself and said, “You punk, really advanced gradually and entrench yourself at every step! Looks like you came prepared!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Preparedness averts peril! Academy head deals with a host of problems daily, how bad would it be to come and trouble you again later.”

Wen Yiyang nodded and said, “Alright, give it to me. Three days later, all of the students staying in the academy will gather and observe you engraving your name on the Sage Stone!”

When Ye Yuan bade farewell and left, Wen Yiyang actually had a feeling akin to being relieved of a heavy burden.

He, a half-step Divine Lord mighty expert, actually fell behind Ye Yuan half a beat in all aspects. It was so depressing.

“This kid really isn’t simple!” Wen Yiyang praised.

...

On the plaza, several thousand people were standing in neat rows.

Everyone used an incredibly envious gaze to look at that young profile on the platform.

Of course, there were also some very unfriendly gazes.

Such as Wang Song and Qin Tian.

Hall of Fame was a supreme honor in Wu Meng Academy!

To be able to leave one’s name on the Sage Stone, each one made immense contributions to Wu Meng Academy, leaving behind a brilliant stroke in Wu Meng Academy’s history.

“Invite the Sage Stone!”

The moment Wen Yiyang’s words faded, there was a tremor in the void. A chunk of enormous stone slowly ripped apart space and appeared in front of everyone.

The moment the Sage Stone appeared, Ye Yuan’s expression became stern too.

The aura emitting off it made people have an impulse to prostrate in worship!

That was a sacred aura!

Ye Yuan slightly mustered up the power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain before neutralizing this aura.

Lifting his head and looking, golden light rippled on the enormous rock, each and every name dazzling the eye.

“Bow to the Sage Stone!”

Wen Yiyang took the lead and bowed down toward the Sage Stone.

The several thousand students on the plaza also stooped their bodies and bowed.

One could tell that they were all respectful from the bottom of their hearts.

Ye Yuan also bowed low. These past sages were worthy of his bow.

He knew that the swords in the Sword Tomb were left behind by these past sages.

Finished bowing, Wen Yiyang said to the Sage Stone in a clear voice, “Today, there is Disciple Ye Yuan, self-created a sword art, Sundering Stars, in the Sword Tomb, overpowering the six supreme academy skills, gifting it to the academy, with no greater merit! The incumbent Academy Head, Wen Yiyang, cordially invites the Sage Stone to permit Ye Yuan to engrave words and leave behind his name, entering the Hall of Fame!”

The moment Wen Yiyang’s voice faded, the Sage Stone suddenly shone with a bright light. A ray of golden light shot out, enveloping Ye Yuan inside.

Ye Yuan’s expression became austere, feeling as if his secrets were all being snooped out.

But right at this time, a surge of terrifying aura emitted from Ye Yuan’s body, suddenly flowing up in reverse, enveloping over toward the Sage Stone.

Rumble ...

The Sage Stone seemed to have suffered a tremendous stimulation and started trembling violently in the air.
