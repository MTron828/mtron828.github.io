Chapter 1571 Changing Heavens

Lin Dong carefully said out loud Qin Xiao’s crimes, but he was secretly astonished in his heart.

A month ago, Ye Yuan sent him to Wu Meng Capital City, making him investigate Qin Xiao.

The direction of the investigation was also provided by Ye Yuan.

There was nothing when not investigating, but the moment there was an investigation, he found many problems.

Lin Dong was not surprised because he could find problems, but he was marveled because of Ye Yuan’s meticulousness when doing things.

There was nothing when not taking action, the moment he made a move, he did not leave his opponent any leeway at all.

This newly-appointed elder had a maturity and decisiveness that was not commensurate with his age.

If one underestimated him because of his age, they would suffer a big loss!

Lin Dong was very surprised in his heart, this Elder Ye was simply a freak.

Martial Dao and Alchemy Dao, his strength was extremely strong, and he also had a level-headed character. There was simply no chink to exploit!

For him to be able to obtain the Pill Tower’s recognition and become an elder, it was absolutely no accident.

Right now, the conflict between Head Elder and Second Elder two camps was intensifying with each day. Perhaps the appearance of this new elder would be a variable in the struggle between the two!

“Qin Xiao, what else do you have to say?” Lin Dong said coldly.

“I ... I ...”

Qin Xiao was already battered out of his senses. He knew that he was finished. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Looks like City Lord Qin doesn’t have any objections. Protector Lin, cripple his cultivation first and detain him inside the City Lord Manor’s dungeon. Pick a date to escort him to the imperial city to await punishment. Zhao Yi is similarly crippled of his cultivation and thrown into the dungeon. Wen Yiyang was accessory to a tyrant’s crimes. The death penalty can be spared, but it’s hard to escape punishment. He is to be stripped of his academy head position and Thundercry will assume the post. As for Qin Zhaoyun ... immediately execute him on the spot!”

Talking to the back, Ye Yuan’s killing intent gradually thickened.

Everyone on the street was silent like cicadas in winter, being stunned by Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum.

They all knew that the Qin Family that had commanded Wu Meng Capital City for over 100 thousand years collapsed just like this!

This great reversal today was seriously too exciting.

Swoosh!

Right at this time, Qin Zhaoyun’s figure moved rapidly, speeding away into the horizon.

Lin Dong laughed coldly and casually pointed a finger out.

Boom!

Qin Zhaoyun had not flown out far and was annihilated until not even residue remained.

With Qin Zhaoyun’s strength, how could he possibly escape from under Lin Dong’s hands?

Wen Yiyang’s face revealed a bitter smile.

As for Qin Xiao and Zhao Yi, their faces revealed a look of despair.

But, they did not dare to resist at all.

Lin Dong was too strong!

Even Qin Xiao was completely lacking in front of Lin Dong.

“Tsk tsk, really didn’t expect that the City Lord and Qin Family collapsed just like this.”

“That serves them right! These few years, the Qin Family acted like a tyrant in Wu Meng Capital City, really had enough of it!”

“Ye Yuan is really too incredible. In just 20 years’ time, he actually transformed and became some Pill Tower elder. Change is the only constant, the wheel of fortune turns, the 30 years wasn’t up yet!”

“Qin Xiao repaid kindness with ingratitude back then. He probably never thought that there would still be this day, right?”

...

Amidst a series of exclamations, this war that lasted for 20 years finally came to an end.

Finally, it concluded with Ye Yuan’s crushing, making everyone’s jaws drop.

Everyone did not think that ye yuan’s return was actually so domineering!

...

Inside the City Lord Manor, Thundercry prostrated on the ground. Ye Yuan hurriedly helped him up and said with a smile, “Teacher Thundercry doesn’t need to be overly courteous. He who teaches me for a day is my father for life. This Wu Meng Academy will be entrusted to you in the future!”

Thundercry sweated heavily and said, “Ye ... Elder Ye.”

“Teacher Thundercry, there is no need to be awkward. Just call me Ye Yuan will do,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Thundercry nodded his head and said, “Elder Ye, this Thundercry can’t shoulder such heavy responsibilities!”

Clearly, between Thundercry and Ye Yuan was no longer the teacher-student relationship back then long ago.

Even the city lord was taken down casually, Thundercry naturally knew the disparity between him and Ye Yuan presently. How could he dare to call Ye Yuan’s name directly?

Furthermore, Lin Dong was standing beside Ye Yuan. That was a third-layered heaven Divine Lord existence!

Ye Yuan smiled and did not force it either and said, “Teacher Thundercry’s character is upright and outspoken, magnanimous and just, the best choice for the academy head. Don’t turn it down anymore. I know what you’re worried about. Take this medicinal pill. Before long, Wu Meng Academy will naturally have an additional half-step Divine Lord powerhouse appear.”

Thundercry’s whole body trembled, his eyes revealing a look of disbelief.

Half-step Divine Lord!

How many Origin Deity Realm powerhouses wanted to reach this realm? But it was too difficult.

Something as massive as Wu Meng Capital City, there were only four half-step Divine Lord powerhouses in the past too.

But now, Ye Yuan actually promised him the realm of half-step Divine Lord!

The shock in Thundercry’s heart could not be any greater. Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao strength already reached such an outrageous level?

No wonder, no wonder he could become the Pill Tower’s elder!

Even Four-star Alchemy Gods did not dare to promise half-step Divine Lord either, right?

“This ... Then this Thundercry will accept deferentially than to decline courteously!” Thundercry bowed and saluted as he said.

Right then, Qin Shao requested an audience.

The moment he came in, he gave a deep bow to Ye Yuan and said, “Elder Ye, I ...”

“You want to plead for the Qin Family?” Ye Yuan said with scorching eyes.

Facing Ye Yuan’s intent stare, Qin Shao felt like a mountain crushed over, making him incomparably shocked inwardly.

His cultivation speed was already very fast. In roughly 20 years’ time, he already broke through to middle-stage Heaven Glimpse.

But Ye Yuan broke through a major realm in 20 years!

Furthermore, the news of Ye Yuan challenging three great half-step divine lords alone was already not considered some secret in Wu Meng Capital City.

He knew that the disparity between him and Ye Yuan would become big, but did not expect that it was actually huge to such an extent.

Genius?

Qin Shao felt that using this term to describe himself was simply an insult to this word.

However, he still gritted his teeth and said, “Elder Ye, please raise your hand high in mercy!”

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “According to what I know, the Qin Family doesn’t seem to treat you very well, right?”

Qin Family said, “No matter what, I’m a member of the Qin Family. Without the Qin Family, there wouldn’t be today’s Qin Family!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If ... I say no?”

Qin Shao’s gaze revealed a trace of ferociousness as he said, “If Qin Shao can leave behind a wretched body, I’ll definitely kill Elder Ye in this lifetime!”

“Insolence!”

Lin Dong’s gaze turned dark, a terrifying aura released.

Qin Shao’s entire body trembled, instantly feeling like the sky was falling down.

Ye Yuan waved his hand at Lin Dong, Lin Dong’s aura disappeared. Qin Shao retreated several steps in a row and plopped down onto the ground, gasping heavily for air.

The aura of a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse was too terrifying!

But Ye Yuan burst into laughter and said, “Qin Shao, although you were born in the Qin Family, you’re different from the Qin Family’s people! On the account of your face, I’ll let the Qin Family go.”

Qin Shao’s pupils constricted, revealing a look of disbelief.

He never harbored any hope coming.

In the eyes of the present Ye Yuan, he was just an insignificant minor character. How could Ye Yuan possibly change his enmity towards the Qin Family because of him?

But not coming, he could not cross this hurdle in this heart.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually really agreed!

“However ...” Ye Yuan’s face suddenly fell and he said, “Qin Tiannan, as well as the Qin Family’s few elders who are steeped in crimes, must be executed!”

Qin Shao drew a deep breath, gave a bow to Ye Yuan, and said, “Qin Shao thanks Elder Ye!”
