Chapter 2948: Inflated!

“I … I can’t!” Ceng Yu looked at Ye Yuan and laughed bitterly.

He tried for half a day and ultimately still failed to fuse with it.

Following that, a few more people tried it, but it still did not work.

Clearly, fusing with origin this sort of thing was not easy.

“I’ll try it!” Bai Cuishan came forward on his own accord.

Nobody could resist the allure of origin. Bai Cuishan could not resist as well.

Seeing that so many people failed, he was somewhat eager for action.

Who knew that Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Brother Bai, do you trust me or not?”

Bai Cuishan grinned and said, “Without you, Ye Yuan, there wouldn’t be me, Bai Cuishan, today! If I don’t trust you, who else can I trust?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you trust me, don’t fuse with the origin.”

Bai Cuishan was taken aback and said, “Why?”

Ye Yuan said, “Origin is a sharp weapon and also a shackle! You’ve already obtained Progenitor Imperishable’s inheritance. There’s no need to fuse with his origin anymore. As long as you follow this path, your future accomplishments will definitely be above the person who fuses with the origin! In fact, even right now, he might not be your match too!”

Ye Yuan had fused with an origin too, but Hegemon Imperishable’s origin was different from the Chaos Bloodstone’s origin.

That wisp of blood origin was not tainted with the slightest secular aura. It was completely born from chaos!

Extremely pure!

Ye Yuan did not have any side effects when fusing with the Dao sword.

But Hegemon Imperishable’s origin carried a thick personal brand.

That was the Dao of Hegemon Imperishable.

Fusing with this trace of origin, one’s strength might soar rapidly in the beginning.

But when time passed, it would be very hard to carve out your own path.

When one reached origin realm and wanted to step into the realm of Hegemon, it would be even more difficult!

Ye Yuan’s impression of Bai Cuishan was pretty good. Although this person liked to posture, his thoughts were simple without distracting thoughts.

During the first round previously, he even came to remind him to leave.

Then later on, Bai Cuishan was also the person who comprehended the seven Daos the deepest among these people!

His current strength already far surpassed Wang Qian!

Therefore, Ye Yuan decided not to give the origin to him.

Bai Cuishan thought about it and said, “Alright, I won’t fuse with it! If any of you want to fuse, take it!”

Everyone looked at Bai Cuishan with disbelieving faces.

This guy was insane, right?

One sentence from Ye Yuan and he gave the origin that was about to come to his hands to others?

Even if it was very difficult to step into Hegemon Realm in the future, even if one reached Emperor Sakra Heaven, just this step of stepping into origin from Emperor Sakra Heaven already stumped countless geniuses!

Most people were still just Emperor Cloud Heaven.

God knows how long Emperor Sakra Heaven would take!

He did not want this massive lucky chance?

Although Ye Yuan had received Ye Yuan’s favor, they still felt that Bai Cuishan was a dumb person flushed with money and was hoodwinked by Ye Yuan.

Many people started whispering to each other.

When Wang Qian saw this scene, he sneered coldly.

Hegemon Imperishable and everyone all descended from the same lineage!

They were Pseudo Imperishable Physiques. Why would Hegemon Imperishable’s origin cause a hindrance when stepping into Hegemon Realm?

Moreover, there was only Hegemon Imperishable alone who stepped into Hegemon Realm with the Pseudo Imperishable Physique!

No matter how strong the others were, they were unable to break through the shackle of Hegemon Realm too!

This origin could be said to be the only hope of stepping into Hegemon Realm.

Obstruction?

Idiot!

Very soon, many more people tried to integrate it, but all of them failed without exception!

Fusing with origin had an extremely high requirement on talent.

It was not that you could fuse with it when the origin was placed in front of you.

“Shall I try it?” Wang Qian finally could not resist stepping forward.

The moment he stepped forward, a wave of ridicules immediately came over.

“Wang Qian, do you still want face or not?”

“Others all have the qualifications to try, but what qualifications do you have?”

“Give up. It’s impossible for Master Ye to let you try!”

… …

Wang Qian was already invincible. He directly ignored these words and looked toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “Give it a shot then. Either way, it’s also a waste for this origin to be placed here.”

Wang Qian wished to smack Ye Yuan to death with a slap! You’re too freaking good at posturing!

It turned out that Your Father was a rag-and-bone man?

The others also looked toward Ye Yuan in shock, wondering whether or not Ye Yuan became stupid from cultivation?

Actually, Ye Yuan had his own considerations too.

If no one here could fuse with it, then he could only fuse with it himself.

With his mist physique, there was naturally no difficulty with fusing with it.

But he was not willing!

If he went out, Cloudneon that woman would definitely force him to fuse with it.

Therefore, it was best if he could find someone to fuse with it among these people.

Wang Qian received the crystal, his mood extremely agitated.

He was someone that Progenitor found promising. He had confidence in fusing with the origin!

As long as he fused the origin, he would regain all the face that he had lost!

Taking a deep breath, Wang Qian started fusing with the origin.

His soul body gradually transformed into a mass of misty air, attempting to penetrate into the origin. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Concerning his fusion, everything seemed to be going well.

The origin crystal actually started to melt!

Wang Qian was wildly elated in his heart, forcefully suppressing the agitated in his heart and continuing to integrate it.

Little by little, bit by bit.

Finally, he felt an additional powerful to the extreme power in his soul body.

Originally, the areas that he was confused about on the journey of Dao, suddenly became enlightened at this time!

Boom!

Wang Qian’s soul force rose rapidly and actually directly entered middle Emperor Cloud Heaven!

Everyone was dumbfounded!

“A-Actually really fused with it!”

“No wonder Great Emperor Shan Yang was so optimistic about him. It turns out that his soul physique is really the closest to Progenitor Imperishable!”

“Sigh,?what’s Master Ye thinking? Such a large piece, he gave it away with both hands!”

… …

Everyone around him either exclaimed, felt regretful, or was angry from his failure to live up to expectations.

But they were unable to change the fact that Wang Qian fused with the origin.

“Hahaha?… You didn’t expect it right, Ye Yuan? I, Wang Qian, fused with Progenitor Imperishable’s origin! From now on, we’re no longer of the same world!”

Wang Qian felt that he was currently powerful to the extreme.

In fact, after possessing the origin, he felt that Hegemon Realm was within reach too!

The things that were originally vague and insubstantial, he currently felt that it was very solid!

Hegemon Imperishable’s origin was not the average origin.

This was the soul race’s Supreme Hegemon whose strength roamed the heavens unobstructed!

That kind of feeling could not be described with words at all.

Ye Yuan was indeed a little surprised. He did not expect that Wang Qian really fused with it.

It seemed like Wang Qian’s Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique was indeed very strong and already somewhat approached the real Imperishable Soul Physique.

However, no matter how close, it was also just Pseudo Imperishable Physique.

Everyone’s expressions were ugly. They did not have any good impression of Wang Qian.

But now, circumstances were stronger than people!

Many people started grumbling about Ye Yuan in their hearts.

Wang Qian felt that he was very inflated. He arrived before Ye Yuan and said with a disdainful look, “Ye Yuan, didn’t you say that he’s stronger than me after fusing with the origin? I’ll have a battle with him now. You don’t have objections, right?”

While talking, he pointed at Bai Cuishan.

The latter’s expression changed, becoming somewhat fearful.

He was originally not Wang Qian’s match. Now, the other party fused with the origin. How could he possibly be his match?

Ye Yuan’s boast was a little too overboard!
