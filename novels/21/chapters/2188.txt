Chapter 2192: Come and Fight!

This series of actions was natural and smooth, being unbelievably fast.

From executing the immobilizing art to teleporting out, to executing the spatial node technique, it was just the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint.

Ye Yuan had long calculated everything. When Manya broke through the constraints, he would have already slipped away long ago.

Manya was merely a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor. Although he was extremely strong, the constraints of Time Freeze on him were still a little useful.

What Ye Yuan needed was just that instant!

Returning to Mosius’s territory, he displayed the greater teleportation art again. It was impossible for a Heavenly Emperor to catch up to him within a short time too!

As long as they escaped outside of the Blackflame Cave, those abyss monsters would not be able to do anything to him anymore!

“Go!”

Upon landing, Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, directly bringing the two people and executing greater teleportation.

Although this Blackflame Cave was large, with Ye Yuan’s current spatial law, teleporting out was merely the matter of a few breaths of time.

Three people traversed through space and could see the Blackflame Cave’s entrance in several breaths of time.

Seeing the blue sky outside of the Blackflame Cave, Li-er’s face revealed a look of wild elation.

She did not think that she could actually return to the Heavenspan World!

However, Ye Yuan did not dare to be the slightest bit careless, urging spatial law to the limit.

He was not worried about Manya, who he was worried about was that Divine Race powerhouse!

He had never seen before Divine Race powerhouses and did not know how strong Divine Race powerhouses were.

If there were any variables to his plan, it would likely lie on this Divine Race powerhouse.

The entrance got closer bit by bit, but Ye Yuan’s breathing became more and more ragged.

100 thousand feet!

50 thousand feet!

Ten thousand feet!

5000 feet!

1000 feet!

The entrance was right before their eyes.

Ye Yuan three people could already see the Angry Nether River outside.

But right then, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

A terrifying fist force tore through the void and arrived in an instant!

Bang!

The void trembled, Ye Yuan’s greater teleportation art was actually directly broken.

The three people fell!

Ye Yuan suddenly raised his head, a figure was standing above the entrance area.

Because of the lighting, it could not be seen distinctly.

This figure stood with his hands behind his back, the gaze that looked down from a great height showed disdain upon the three people.

Ye Yuan focused his eyes and looked over, only to see that the other party’s figure was no different from ordinary humans.

But the aura exuding off his body was actually quite similar to Heavenly Dao!

And on his body, one fine line after another entwined around.

Dao mark!

Ye Yuan looked at the other party, his expression incomparably solemn.

Powerful!

A might that made people suffocate!

This kind of might actually gave Ye Yuan a feeling of not being able to overcome with force. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Seeing this person, Li-er’s eyes revealed a look of despair.

“Nineorigin!”

This person was the Divine Race powerhouse, Nineorigin!

“Divine Daughter, follow Nineorigin back! The Divine Race is your home!” Nineorigin said expressionlessly.

Yue Mengli bit her lips lightly and shook her head and said, “I’ll never go back!”

Nineorigin sighed lightly, but turned to Ye Yuan and said, “You’re the Ye Yuan that the Divine Daughter spoke of?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “That’s right! It’s me!”

Nineorigin nodded slightly and said, “Entered the Divine Capital alone and brought Divine Daughter out under layers of experts. I’ve got to say, you’re very outstanding! If I wasn’t around, you’d likely really succeed. It’s just too bad that ... you have to die!”

A hint of decisiveness flashed across in Yue Mengli’s gaze and she said, “If Big Brother Yuan dies, I won’t drag out an ignorable existence either!”

Nineorigin smiled lightly and said, “Not killing him also works, you go back to the abyss with me.”

Yue Mengli said without the slightest hesitation, “Fine, I’ll go with you guys!”

As she said, one powerful aura after another gathered over from all directions, surrounding Ye Yuan three people tightly.

Manya rushed over first. Kneeling down in front of Nineorigin with a thud, he said in fear and trepidation, “Great Sage Nineorigin, Manya deserves death!”

Nineorigin said coolly, “Give me a reason not to kill you.”

Manya’s entire body trembled, recounting the events previously in detail.

When Nineorigin heard, his brows could not help furrowing.

He was previously consolidating the spatial channel and felt the fluctuations in space, that was why he would take action.

If not, Ye Yuan would have long already brought Li-er and escaped at this time.

Hence, he was also very enraged at the Manya who was guarding Yue Mengli.

It was just that he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually had such miraculous means, to actually be able to bring Divine Daughter away with such a bizarre method.

Even with Nineorigin’s hallowedness, he also could not help secretly feeling lucky at this time.

Just a little bit and Ye Yuan would have succeeded.

“Uncle Nineorigin, what’s going on?” At this time, a young man stepped on air and came over, arriving beside Nineorigin.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, this young man’s aura was the same as Nineorigin’s, also of the Divine Race.

Nineorigin nodded slightly and said, “It’s Xin? Xin, someone wants to bring away the Divine Daughter. Luckily, this was stopped by me.”

Xin’s eyes turned to Ye Yuan and he said with a frown, “It’s this lowly human?”

Nineorigin nodded and said, “That’s right.”

Xin had a look of disdain as he said, “Lowly humans all deserve to die! Blaspheming the Divine Daughter is even committing a crime upon crimes! Manya, why haven’t you taken action?”

Manya had a ferocious look on his face, he was incredibly furious with Ye Yuan.

An exalted Heavenly Emperor was actually played by a human.

Furthermore, it was even a human who was much lower realm than him!

“Yes, Lord Divine Son!” Manya kowtowed in reply and was about to make a move.

Nineorigin shook his head and said, “Divine Daughter agreed to go with us, so let him leave. Divine Daughter, can you leave with us now?”

Yue Mengli looked at Ye Yuan, a look of reluctance to part.

But she had no choice but to leave!

If she did not go, with Ye Yuan’s strength, there was no hope of walking out of this place at all.

It was missing just this one final step!

Yue Mengli smiled bitterly and painfully in her heart.

“Big Brother Yuan, take care!” Tears fell down the corners of Yue Mengli’s eyes.

However, at that moment she turned around, a hand grabbed her.

“Big Brother Yuan?” Yue Mengli was taken aback.

Ye Yuan smiled.

Smiled very radiantly!

But it carried a hint of heroism and sorrow!

He and Li-er had their hearts linked up, so how could she not know what Ye Yuan was thinking?

Yeah, with Ye Yuan’s personality, how could he possibly watch her leave and not do anything?

Ye Yuan looked at Nineorigin and said with a cold smile, “So what if Divine Race? Today, I’m going to battle this Divine Race! Want to bring Li-er away, can! Step over my dead body! How can I, Ye Yuan, stand behind my woman and wag my tail pitifully?”

Nineorigin’s gaze flickered slightly and did not speak.

Xin’s mouth curled and he said contemptuously, “You’ve got some backbone, but what right does a weakling like you have to say this? You are only fit to stand behind women and wag your tail pitifully! This Divine Son wants to see how tough your bones are!”

Done talking, Xin gave a look. Manya understood this signal.

It was only to see him reach his hand out. He beckoned, and then several hundred Empyrean level abyss monsters directly surrounded Ye Yuan three people tightly.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said in a solemn voice, “Li-er, you go out first!”

Yue Mengli knew that this was probably Ye Yuan’s fight with the least chance of victory to this day!

Even when facing Kanuo back then, Ye Yuan also had a glimmer of hope.

But, the person Ye Yuan was facing today was Nineorigin, a supreme powerhouse!

“Big Brother Yuan, you ... you be careful!”

Forcefully enduring tears, Yue Mengli withdrew out of the battlefield.

Ye Yuan released his aura and yelled coldly, “Come and fight!”
