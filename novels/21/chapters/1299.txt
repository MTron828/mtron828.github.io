“Damn it! That punk really stayed at the Myriad Treasure Tower! I’m perplexed, where did he get divine essence stones?”

“I’ve already inquired before, Eldest Miss had Lan Qing send this boy quite a few divine essence stones.”

“So, it’s like that! But with Madam around, Eldest Miss doesn’t seem to have much divine essence stones in her possession either, right?”

“En, at most, it’s also around a hundred pieces. The Myriad Treasure Tower’s Yellow Rank cultivation rooms need 10 pieces of low-grade divine essence stones too. He can’t last past a few days. We can’t afford to provoke the Myriad Treasure Tower. Just keep watch here then.”

“Eldest Miss had always stood aloof from the world these few years, Madam couldn’t find an excuse to mess with her either. This time, she sent that boy divine essence stones. This finally let Madam get the opportunity.”

“Yeah! This matter concerns the Liang Family’s rise and fall, even Family Head has nothing to say either. Want to say, Eldest Miss is also really pitiful. These few years, she has been badly oppressed by that pair of mother and daughter.”

“Isn’t that so. Now, she’s thrown into the dungeons. That pair of mother and daughter probably won’t let her off easily.”

Zhang Shun duo waited for ten days outside the Myriad Treasure Tower, filling them with burning anxiety.

However, the Myriad Treasure Tower was not what the Liang Family could afford to provoke at all. They could only keep an eye on the Myriad Treasure Tower too, awaiting Ye Yuan to come out.

The more they waited, the more irritated the two people got.

A cripple actually wasted so much of their time.

But, hearing the meaning in their words, Liang Wanru was actually thrown into the dungeons by Wang Pianran because of sending Ye Yuan divine essence stones.

With Wang Pianran’s methods, she naturally would not let Liang Wanru off so easily.

This time, perhaps she would be put to death.

At this time, ten days had already gone by inside the World Suppressing Stele, Ye Yuan left seclusion once more.

When Hong Yin saw the two middle-grade Divine Essence Pills in front of her, she could not help being shocked until she could not close her mouth.

She knew that the Divine Essence Stones on Ye Yuan was only sufficient to launch the Lesser Divine Essence Formation twice.

This was also to say that Ye Yuan’s current success rate was 100%!

One had to know, Ye Yuan bought ten sets of spirit medicines previously and only took out a middle-grade Divine Essence Pill.

This improvement speed was truly a little too terrifying, right?

Of course, if she knew that before entering the cultivation room, Ye Yuan was still an out-and-out layman, wonder what she would feel.

Hong Yin was a Myriad Treasure Tower’s veteran already. She knew how great the difficulty of Formation Dao Pill Refinement was.

Because nobody in Jewelhill City could perform Formation Dao Pill Refinement!

Not only Manager Su was this Myriad Treasure Tower’s head manager, but he was also a peak One Star Alchemy God!

But even he could not perform this Formation Dao Pill Refinement either.

However, Ye Yuan actually already grasped Formation Dao Pill Refinement at this time. Furthermore, he even had such a high success rate, how could this not dumbfound Hong Yin?

“Sir is truly an alchemy genius; improvement speed is too quick! It has just been a day, and the quality of Divine Essence Pill that you refined is much better than before again! In another few days, Sir will probably be able to refine high-grade Divine Essence Pills,” Hong Yin exclaimed.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Miss is too kind, my luck was just a little better.”

Not that Ye Yuan was modest, it was really that his luck was good.

With only two chances, Ye Yuan swallowed another two sets of spirit medicines before refining in order to familiarize himself with the medicinal properties.

Only all the way until the last two days did he start refining.

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, the assurance in refining Divine Essence Pills was also merely around 30%.

He did not expect that the two times actually all succeeded.

Hong Yin’s beautiful eyes stared at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Sir, just call me Hong Yin will do. I wonder what’s Sir’s name?”

Ye Yuan said, “So, it’s Miss Hong Yin, I am Ye Yuan.”

“Sir Ye is so talented, to actually be completely unknown previously, Hong Yin is truly ignorant and ill-informed,” Hong Yin said probingly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Ye just entered the city not long ago and is temporarily staying with the Liang Family.”

Ye Yuan did not conceal it. He believed that with the Myriad Treasure Tower’s strength, if they really wanted to check, it was very easy to find out.

Hong Yin was greatly surprised when she heard that. The Liang Family was one of Jewelhill City’s big family clans. It was absolutely impossible to not even be able to take out this bit of divine essence stones.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s pedantic appearance, it seemed like his relationship with the Liang Family was rather strange.

But, Hong Yin was also an experienced girl and did not bring it out on her face, but smiled radiantly and said, “So that’s how it is. Will Sir continue to exchange these two Divine Essence Pills for divine essence stones and spirit medicines?”

Ye Yuan said with clasped hands, “I’ll have to trouble Miss Hong Yin.”

Two middle-grade Divine Essence Pills were 56 divine essence stones. Ye Yuan’s financial situation became much better off all of a sudden.

He still only rented a day’s cultivation room, exchanging all of the rest to spirit medicines and divine essence stones.

Time passed day by day, Ye Yuan’s comprehension towards the Lesser Divine Essence Formation became deeper and deeper. The quality of the Divine Essence Pills refined also became higher and higher.

On the seventh day, Ye Yuan finally refined a high-grade Divine Essence Pill!

With this, Ye Yuan was finally considered to have leaped over the dragon gate.

To him, this was not a high-grade Divine Essence Pill, but 80 divine essence stones.

What Ye Yuan needed the most right now were divine essence stones!

Roughly the cost of 10 pieces of divine essence stones and refining a high-grade Divine Essence Pill worth 80 pieces of divine essence stones, this kind of incremental effect was what Ye Yuan was most willing to see.

When Hong Yin saw this high-grade Divine Essence Pill, she was shocked until she could not close her mouth once more.

Although the Divine Essence Pill was the most basic divine pill, Ye Yuan’s improvement speed could simply use horrifying to describe!

However, what she was surprised by was still about that thing.

Following Ye Yuan’s financial situation becoming more and more well-off, he had even more chances to refine medicinal pills. The understanding of medicinal properties and Lesser Divine Essence Formation also become deeper and deeper.

Hence, his success rate got higher and higher, the quality also became more and more stable!

In-between this, Hong Yin arbitrarily made a decision!

Limitlessly providing Ye Yuan divine essence stones and spirit medicines, as long as Ye Yuan handed the refined medicinal pills to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Ye Yuan agreed without any hesitation. What he needed the most right now was practice.

With the support of a colossal titan like the Myriad Treasure Tower, he could finally go all out to refine Divine Essence Pills. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

On the tenth day, the Divine Essence Pills that Ye Yuan refined were already stabilized at high-grade.

On the 18th day, the 280th day inside the World Suppressing Stele!

Inside the array formation, light faded away. Eight divine essence stones became barren rocks.

But a bright glint flashed across in Ye Yuan’s eyes, revealing an excited expression.

“Haha, finally formed!”

Looking at the superior-grade Divine Essence Pill in his hand, Ye Yuan also felt inexplicably excited.

Divine pills were too hard to refine. In these 250 days, he refined pills, deliberated, refined pills, deliberated, over and over like this, no idea how many times he repeated it!

All the way until today, refining his first superior-grade Divine Essence Pill.

“Heh, just superior-grade, is there a need to be happy until like this? Refining a superior-grade Divine Essence Pill is merely just the beginning!” Dustless struck down without any mercy.

Although his words were said like that, Ye Yuan’s improvement, Dustless took it into his sights every day and was long deeply convinced by Ye Yuan’s talent already.

He felt that Ye Yuan was simply a genius born to refine pills!

Ye Yuan used the greater part of a year and reached a height that others could only attain using a hundred years!

This kind of improvement speed already could not be said to be fast to describe it.

But Ye Yuan was not beaten down at all and said excitedly, “Senior doesn’t know, that in the past, my life-long pursuit was to refine a divine pill! Now that I refined a superior-grade Divine Essence Pill, it can also be regarded as attaining a higher level in divine pills! Junior is naturally happy!”

Dustless’s requirement toward Ye Yuan was not superior-grade, but ... divine-grade!
