Chapter 2125: You Are Too Old

The void vanished into thin air, the chess game fell into a region of chaos.

Two mighty sovereigns faced each other across space, without words.

At this time, an enormous phantom suddenly cut in horizontally between the two.

Looking at the appearance, it was actually Ye Yuan!

The phantom slowly opened his mouth and said to the two people, “Now, can I sit and debate on Dao with you guys?”

Medicine Ancestor slowly opened his mouth and said, “Possessing three astonishing wills is indeed seldom-seen. It’s just that, to sit and debate on Dao with us, you’re still not qualified enough!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest also said, “How can our boundary be what you can imagine?”

Ye Yuan said calmly, “The people are confused by the chess game and don’t know that the chess game is the world that the two of you developed. Naming it a chess game, in reality, it’s the two of you refining to form a world with Alchemy Dao! It’s just that this world has an imbalance of Yin and Yang. It’s clearly one stronger one weaker; clearly unable to form a world, and naturally unable to form a pill. Just in terms of Alchemy Dao, actually ... the two of you have failed!”

The moment these words came out, the two people were shocked.

The two phantoms slowly turned their heads and looked toward Ye Yuan’s phantom. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Those deep gazes seemingly wanted to see through Ye Yuan.

Clearly, the two people both did not expect that Ye Yuan actually had such a profound understanding.

And disregarding right or wrong, Ye Yuan had clearly already grasped the essence of the chess game.

The chess game was a world, but in reality, it was also a medicinal pill!

Bystanders thought that these two people were facing off, but actually, they were refining pills!

One pill, one world!

These two people were jointly creating a world.

These two people’s Alchemy Dao already reached the acme of perfection.

It was just that these words sounded like thunder in the ears of everyone in the outside world.

Especially Ji Mo, his entire body trembled, his gaze revealing an incomparably shocked expression as if being enlightened.

“So that’s how it is! So that’s how it is!”

There were countless priests in the city, but among these people, Ji Mo’s alchemy strength was the strongest!

So Ye Yuan’s words had the greatest impact on him.

To them, senior and junior brothers, the Ask Not chess game was all too familiar.

Ever since following Sacred Ancestor High Priest, them senior and junior brothers had already researched the Ask Not chess game for no idea how many years.

But them senior and junior brothers were unable to understand the true profound meaning of Ask Not from start to end.

But presently, it was laid bare by Ye Yuan’s one remark!

This was not a chess game, but a world, a medicinal pill!

It was just that normal people refined pills with spirit medicines, these two people refined pills with Great Dao!

The two integrated their own Dao into the chessboard with a great divine ability and created a world on the chessboard.

It was called a showdown, but in reality, it was an alchemy battle!

Each piece that landed developed a portion of the world.

This kind of alchemy battle was simply a marvelous work of art!

After the shock, Ji Mo used an even more shocked gaze to look at that enormous phantom, his expression indicating him being in a trance.

Was this person really just a Six-star priest?

This Ask Not chess game, he had studied it for no less than ten million years, but could not compare to Ye Yuan’s this one short day?

Thinking up to here, Ji Mo could not help smiling bitterly.

Them senior and junior brothers 11 people, which one wasn’t a prodigious talent in Alchemy Dao?

In these several tens of millions of years, they had also always thought that this was the case, all the way until encountering Ye Yuan today.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao already touched the essence of Dao.

A disdainful voice came from the Medicine Ancestor’s mouthm “Humph! A mere ant also dares to have preposterous views on us, ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth! The world knows that this game was won by this ancestor. So how can it be your turn to come and butt in?”

“Hahaha ...” Ye Yuan laughed loudly when he heard that.

Medicine Ancestor’s face turned dark and he said, “Impudent! What’s there to laugh about?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m laughing that you’re deceiving yourself as well as others!”

A powerful aura rippled out. Everyone felt asphyxiated.

Clearly, the Medicine Ancestor was enraged.

Everyone was silent like cicadas in winter, looking towards Ye Yuan with incredible shock.

This guy was too arrogant, to actually dare say that Medicine Ancestor was deceiving himself as well as others. Wasn’t this courting death?

However, Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Stop making an empty show of strength! In this place, you’re merely the Medicine Ancestor’s ‘Dao’. As long as your will can’t bring me down, you can’t do anything to me!”

Medicine Ancestor sneered and said, “You’re wrong! My Dao ... can also kill you!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and laughed in spite of himself. With a disdainful look on his face, he said coolly, “You are already old! Others all call you Medicine Ancestor, but actually ... you’re not a Dao Ancestor. In these countless tens of thousands of years, you were unable to take this step. Do you know why?”

Not waiting for Medicine Ancestor to speak, Ye Yuan continued, “Because ... you’re afraid of losing!”

“You indeed won this game, but also lost! Because, if your heart yearned for Dao, this Ask Not chess game should be a complete world, a true pill of Great Dao, and not this current appearance! The vying of Alchemy Dao is vie and also fulfilling. If you have a mind as open as a valley, free from pride and prejudices, achieving a real world, that would be you winning! Just you wait. Come one day, you’ll be surpassed by Sacred Ancestor High Priest! Of course, you’ll also be surpassed by me! You are already old!”

Each and every one of Ye Yuan’s words was akin to one heavy punch after another, striking onto Ji Mo’s soul.

Other people’s boundaries were too shallow and completely did not know what Ye Yuan was talking about.

But he understood!

Ye Yuan’s words sounded wildly conceited, but actually, it concealed a profound theory.

Alchemy Dao was different from Martial Dao.

Martial Dao’s competition for hegemony did not have number one. If it was not a win, it was a loss.

But what the competition for hegemony for Alchemy Dao competed in was Dao heart!

If one’s Dao heart was firm, they should cherish each opportunity to refine pills, and not create an incomplete world.

“Heh, really spouting drivel! In this world, there’s actually someone who dares to talk about surpassing Medicine Ancestor! Even Sacred Ancestor High Priest couldn’t do it. Just based on his strength?” Heavenly Emperor Zixu responded with a cold smile.

“In these countless years, there were countless alchemists who wanted to surpass the Medicine Ancestor. But no one had done it before. He thinks that he can do it because he’s talented? What a joke!” Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun similarly said with a cold smile.

The powerhouses in the outside world were all mocking Ye Yuan for overestimating his own ability.

In their understanding, the Medicine Ancestor was already the perfection of Alchemy Dao; unable to surpass at all.

This was the ‘truth’ verified through countless springs and autumns!

It was true that Ye Yuan’s talent was high, but wanting to surpass the Medicine Ancestor was totally impossible.

“Hahaha ... kid, I like thise words! Saying anymore is pointless, begin!”

At this time, the Sacred Ancestor High Priest who had been silent all along sudden pointed at the void. The chessboard trembled once more.

That cloud of chaos actually started trembling fiercely and actually divided into two segments!

One finger, heaven and earth split!

Medicine Ancestor gave a cold snort and also pointed at the void. A powerful force reverberated between heaven and earth.

With this finger, heaven and earth split again!

The power of Medicine Ancestor’s one finger was clearly much stronger than Sacred Ancestor High Priest. Heaven and earth became even more distinct from each other.

“Medicine Ancestor, this finger of yours is too strong! Sure enough, your heart of contending for the upper-hand has obstructed your advancement!”

Ye Yuan laughed loudly and similarly pointed a finger out.

It was just that this finger pointing out did not have the two supreme powerhouses’ kind of power like nothing happened at all.

Everyone was baffled. Wasn’t it sitting and debating on Dao? This was also too nonsensical, right?

Sure enough, the difference between Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength and these two sovereigns was still too big!
