Chapter 2129: East Suppression Pseudo World

“No way! You can’t acknowledge him as your master! If you acknowledge him as your master, then wouldn’t I be directly a generation younger?”

“I must take Second Sage as my master! Miss, this village, there won’t be this shop anymore[1]!”

“I said no, means no! If you insist on acknowledging him as your master, I’ll cry for you to see!”

“You’re pestering endlessly!”

“You’re refusing to see reason! Hmph!”

Inside the Priest Temple’s hall, two figures were tugging and pulling, becoming tangled together. It was precisely Long Xiaohai and Long Xiaochun brother and sister two people.

While behind him, Long Zhi shook his head slightly.

This Long Xiaochun was really troublesome.

Xin Luo slowly came out of the inner hall. Seeing this scene, he could not help smiling as he said, “Please wait a moment. Lord Crimsonsky is currently consulting Lord Second Sage. Lord Second Sage will be out very soon.”

Long Zhi nodded slightly, indicating that he got it.

He was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. He naturally did not need to express anything to Xin Luo.

Presently, Ye Yuan already moved into the Priest Temple. The temple served him with the highest standards, revering him as a god.

Every day, a group of Empyreans would pay respects morning and night, being incomparably respectful.

Crimsonsky even put aside all of his pride and came to pay respects to Ye Yuan every day, asking him for advice on alchemy aspect knowledge.

Every day, he returned fully loaded.

Before long, Ye Yuan slowly came out of the inner hall. Behind him was Crimsonsky and Loneswan, two great Empyreans.

When Long Xiaochun saw Ye Yuan, she arrived in front of Ye Yuan with a whoosh and pointed at him fiercely as she said, “Ye Yuan, you’re not allowed to take Big Brother Xiaohai as a disciple! Otherwise, the two of us will break off all relations!”

Ye Yuan had a blank look, completely unaware of what was going on.

But Long Xiaohai was greatly enraged. Pulling Long Xiaochun, he said, “Xiaochun, you’re not allowed to mess around! Lord Second Sage, Long Xiaohai wishes to acknowledge you as master!”

As he said, Long Xiaohai actually directly knelt down.

Ye Yuan hurriedly helped him up and said, “Brother Xiaohai mustn’t! If you have any doubts about alchemy, feel free to come to find this Ye to discuss. But the talk of acknowledging a master, you mustn’t say it anymore. You and Xiaochun are both this Ye’s saviors. How can I take you in as my disciple? Also, don’t keep calling me Lord Second Sage. Just call me by my name, and that will do.”

Long Xiaochun patted Ye Yuan’s shoulder and said with a big laugh, “Haha, you’re really terrific! If Long Xiaohai were to acknowledge you as master, then wouldn’t I become a generation younger for no reason? Do you hear it, Long Xiaohai?”

Ye Yuan was speechless. This girlie’s thought process was indeed abnormal than most people.

Long Xiaohai had a depressed face as he said, “But ... we’ll be returning to the Dragon Clan soon! At that time, where would I go to ask you for advice?”

At this time, Long Zhi hesitated a bit, but he still bowed towards Ye Yuan and said, “Long Zhi pays respect to Second Sage.”

He could ignore Xin Luo, but facing Ye Yuan, this existence who suppressed the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest, the two sovereigns, he had no choice but to put away the pride of a Heavenly Emperor.

Witnessing Ye Yuan’s strength, regardless of whether it was Long Zhi or Qi Zixu, they all realized Ye Yuan’s importance to Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

If any mishap happened to Ye Yuan, under Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s fury, the latter might really launch a divine war!

Nobody could shoulder this consequence. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Therefore, no matter how the Qilin coveted the emperor bone, they did not dare to do anything to Ye Yuan either.

As for Qi Zhen, under Ye Yuan’s light, he did not matter at all anymore.

How could a mere Qi Zhen be mentioned in the same breath with the entire demon race’s Second Sage?

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Heavenly Emperor Long Zhi is too courteous. Please, sit.”

Everyone sat down as guest and host. Crimsonsky was the same as Loneswan, standing by the side and carrying out the etiquette of a disciple.

“Heavenly Emperor Long Zhi, you probably have important things to ask this Ye by coming to the temple, right?” Ye Yuan asked with a smile.

Long Zhi’s expression turned intent and he said with a nod, “Second Sage has the Qilin Emperor Bone on your body, releasing qilin will isn’t surprising. But where did this true dragon will ... come from?”

These few days, Long Zhi was extremely puzzled in his heart.

Ye Yuan actually released such a pure true dragon will and could even unleash such a pure dragon race martial technique. Could it be that he was a member of the dragon race?

The true dragon will that Ye Yuan released was not the same as the qilin will!

The true dragon will was released by the dragon soul.

At that time, the unyielding dragon soul soared straight to the clouds. As a member of the dragon race, Long Zhi naturally felt it very clearly!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I say that I’m a member of the dragon race, do you believe it?”

Long Zhi’s pupils constricted, his eyes full of complicatedness as he said, “Second Sage must be joking. How ... can you possibly be a dragon?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I’m not kidding! This Ye possess an Atavism Dragon Soul. Furthermore, it’s already more than half awakened. The dragon race’s cultivation method and martial technique isn’t some secret to me.”

Long Zhi’s entire body trembled and he said in disbelief, “Atavism Dragon Soul! You’re actually of the Atavism Dragon Soul! Even in the Dragon Clan, Atavism Dragon Soul is also one in a million! In this case ... you’re really of the dragon race?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Through and through!”

Long Zhi’s heart shook wildly. Atavism Dragon Soul was one of the paramount dragon souls.

Not only did this Second Sage have the talent to rule the world, he even had the dragon race’s supreme inheritance. He simply gathered a great destiny onto himself!

Even Long Xiaochun also opened her mouth wide at this time, looking at Ye Yuan with a shocked face.

“Y-Y-You ... are actually of the Atavism Dragon Soul! This is the most monstrous inheritance. As long as you keep awakening it, your strength will be able to soar by leaps and bounds and don’t need to cultivate at all!” Long Xiaochun said with surprise.

“It’s just that I don’t know who ... Second Sage’s ancestor is. Our Dragon Clan has been reclusive from the world for a long time already. I’ve never heard of anyone leaving the pseudo world,” Long Zhi said curiously.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know about this either. There are no memories in this area in my inheritance. Maybe, this portion of memories is in the inheritance at the back. However ... I can feel that my ancestor was likely just an Empyrean and not some incredible existence.”

After awakening at rank six, Ye Yuan could feel that his dragon soul was already almost reaching grand completion.

Reckon that awakening one more time was already the limit.

Moreover, a dragon that was able to follow Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, his strength probably would not be too strong either.

After all, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was also just an Empyrean.

If it was the Dragon Clan’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, they would totally turn their noses up at Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

By the side, Long Xiaohai’s eyes swiveled around and he suddenly spoke up, “Why not do it like this? Brother Ye, make a trip with us to East Suppression Pseudo World! Perhaps after returning to the Dragon Clan, you’ll be able to find your origin. Furthermore, we can also discuss Alchemy Dao.”

The moment Long Xiaochun heard, her eyes could not help lighting up as she clapped her hands and applauded. She said, “Good! Good! No wonder the first time I saw Ye Yuan, it was just seeing my biological brother. Maybe our bloodline is very close?”

But Long Zhi’s gaze turned intent, an appearance of wanting to speak but swallowing the words back.

Letting a stranger go to the Dragon Clan, he was a little worried.

The moment Ye Yuan heard this, he was also greatly moved.

He was also very curious about his origin. But the origin of the Four Phase Divine Beast, even Dustless could not say for sure either.

Dustless seemed to have had this segment of memories wiped away.

It seemed like there were still many unknown secrets on Immortal Grove.
