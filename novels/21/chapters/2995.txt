Chapter 2994: It Has Nothing to Do With Me Anymore?

Above the void, the battle was furious to the extreme.

The three great Hegemons’ battle was completely not like the battle of Hegemon Realms.

Primitive and fierce!

Zhao Yue disregarded getting injured, attacking Bloodless frenziedly.

Bloodless’ physical body had already been smashed many times.

He only survived by relying on powerful revival from a drop of blood.

But, the more Bloodless fought, the more terrified he became.

Was this guy really the monster that he created?

Why was he so strong?

When Hegemon Dragonsand suppressed Zhao Yue in the past, he was clearly not so strong yet!

This was of course Ye Yuan’s work.

Ye Yuan helped Zhao Yue to examine his bloodlines and discovered that the bloodline powers within his body were incomparably complicated.

The Conversion Blood Crystal that Bloodless spent 100 thousand years to come up with was naturally not an ordinary object.

With Ye Yuan’s current ability, he could not resolve it at all.

After all, this was a Hegemon level thing.

Ye Yuan discovered that those complicated to the extreme bloodlines had already completely fused into one entity with Zhao Yue and could not be separated at all.

At least, with his current strength, he could not do it at all.

But Ye Yuan thought of a way. It was to inject a drop of his blood essence into Zhao Yue’s body!

Of course, his fused bloodline was actually nothing to Zhao Yue.

Zhao Yue’s bloodlines were far stronger than Ye Yuan’s fused bloodline.

It was just that the bloodline conflict left him in the abyss of suffering at all times.

It was also precisely because of this that Zhao Yue became extremely irascible.

However, a trace of blood origin was contained in Ye Yuan’s blood essence!

The origin of chaos blood was the source of all blood. There was no need to say more about its power.

Under Ye Yuan’s guidance, this trace of origin power had the effect of a lubricant.

It was just like Zhao Yue’s bloodline powers. They were originally stacked together like miscellaneous things. But now, they were arranged neatly.

Therefore, Zhao Yue’s control over his bloodlines became even more accomplished with high proficiency.

He did not need to waste energy to go and maintain that complicated bloodline conflict.

Hence, his combat strength went off the charts!

“Argh! Argh! Argh!?Why is it like this? How can it be like this?”

Bloodless also did not expect that this creature that he created was actually so powerful.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Bloodless’s physical body was blown apart over and over again.

Zhao Yue did not know fatigue at all. You revive ten times, I’ll blow you apart ten times!

You revive a hundred times, I’ll blow you apart a hundred times!

Finally, after being blasted apart once more, he could no longer recover.

The powerful Hegemon Bloodless was completely killed by the ‘monster’ that he created!

Once Bloodless died, Dragonwild was unable to salvage the situation alone and fell very quickly.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue lifted his head to the sky and roared angrily, seemingly giving vent to the resentment in his heart.

His intelligence was almost wiped out, but the instinct to take revenge was still there.

Now that the great enmity had been avenged, his angry roar carried an inexplicable grief, moving people.

Below, thousands of people felt deeply affected, as if they had experienced it too. Many people actually shed tears.

In fact, what happened to Zhao Yue actually happened to them too.

Finished venting, Zhao Yue leaped down and came before Ye Yuan, lying prostrating.

Clearly, he was thanking Ye Yuan.

The current Zhao Yue was extremely respectful and submissive. How did he still have the demeanor of the king of all beasts?

All around, thousands of people directly knelt down toward Ye Yuan.

This person was sent by heaven to save them!

“Many thanks, Sir Ye, for your life-saving grace!” Everyone spoke in unison.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “If you all want to thank, thank Zhao Yue and his companions! I know that you all view him as a monster, but they are not monsters! They relied on powerful will to survive. Their humanity had not been extinguished! If that were not the case, even if I had exceedingly formidable abilities, I can’t save all of you either!”

When everyone heard that, each and every one of them was extremely ashamed.

Transplanting Conversion Blood Crystal had extremely high mortality.

Those able to survive were anomalies.

However, nobody saw them as humans, even if Zhao Yue and the others were once one of them.

This kind of incomparably ugly monster, even they themselves felt disgusted too.

And also … fear!

But it was these monsters that they looked down on in their hearts that rescued them today and avenged them!

“M-many thanks for Brother Zhao’s life-saving grace!”

“Thank you, Brother Zhao, for taking action!”

… …

Gradually, more and more people bowed toward Zhao Yue.

Ye Yuan looked at Zhao Yue and said with a smile, “You look, they are all thanking you!”

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue roared fiercely as though he was angry. Everyone was alarmed when they saw it.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “He’s happy!”

Only then did everyone feel relieved.

The current Zhao Yue was no different from a wild beast. Everything was based on instinct.

The only one that he trusted was Ye Yuan!

This was because the sincerity of Ye Yuan was something that no one else had.

In the horizon, more than a hundred people in mighty contingents were flying over toward this side.

These hundreds of people had an imposing momentum, seething with killing intent.

Especially the old man in the front, he had an unstoppable momentum.

These people were precisely the various tribe powerhouses that came from afar.

“Long Qianxiang, come out for this seat and die!”

His voice reached first before his person reached. Hegemon Long Ran’s fury at this time could be seen.

But, when his figure appeared in the sky above Blood Dragon Island, his entire person was stunned.

“This … Where are the people?” Long Ran said with a dumbfounded look.

The auras of Hegemons were very strong. Let alone that Zhao Yue had fought fiercely with the two great Hegemons for the greater part of a day.

Dragonwild’s and Bloodless’s auras had not dissipated yet until now.

Long Ran was very certain that there were two great Hegemons who died!

The entire Blood Dragon Island was a scene of desolation, being fought until it fragmented into pieces, becoming a wasteland.

Even Long Ran, this Hegemon Realm, was stunned by the scene before his eyes too.

Two great Hegemons falling, this was a huge matter!

This … What was going on?

Ye Yuan rose up into the air and said to Long Ran with cupped fists: “Senior Long Ran, Blood Dragon Island’s matter has already been resolved. The two great Hegemons on the island, Dragonwild and Bloodless, had been executed! Everyone who was involved in murdering their own people, they had all been beheaded!”

Long Ran had a stunned look again and said, “R-Resolved? So it has nothing to do with me anymore?”

“Roar!”

Behind Ye Yuan, Zhao Yue rose up into the air and bared his teeth at Long Ran, brimming with killing intent.

When Long Ran saw Zhao Yue’s ferocious appearance, he could not help jumping in fright and was almost about to attack.

Ye Yuan hurriedly said, “Senior, please stay your hand. The one who killed Dragonwild and Bloodless was precisely Zhao Yue! Zhao Yue, this is Senior Long Ran. Don’t be rude!”

The moment Zhao Yue heard, he immediately stopped behind Ye Yuan and stopped flying off the handle.

When Long Ran saw this scene, his eyeballs were almost popping out.

Zhao Yue gave him an extremely dangerous aura. He had a feeling that if they really came to blows, he was most likely not this guy’s match.

Furthermore, this guy was incomparably savage. He was completely a wild beast.

But he was actually so obedient in front of Ye Yuan.

How did … this boy do it?

During this period of time, Ye Yuan had always been devoted to Blood Dragon Island’s matter, and he cut off the connection with his human soul clone.

Therefore, Long Ran did not know what happened here.

It was also precisely because of this that when the human soul clone knew that things were bad, he urged Long Ran to hurry over.

Long Ran did not expect that it actually had nothing to do with him anymore.
