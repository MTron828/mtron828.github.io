Chapter 1686 Xuan Yu Resigns

Ning Zhiyuan’s eyes popped out!

Was this really that seriously injured Zheng Qi on the verge of death?

Zheng Qi had been stuck at ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord, this threshold, for God knows how many years already.

One had to know, the significance of half-step Celestial Deity was completely different from being a ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

Half-step Celestial Deity Realm meant that it was possible to step into the true Celestial Deity Realm anytime and anywhere.

Although this chance was not great, what if they suddenly had an epiphany one day?

The majority of imperial cities’ Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses actually broke through muddleheadedly like that.

Those who truly relied on their talent to break through were exceedingly rare.

It was not that there weren’t ninth-layered heaven Divine Lords who broke through to Celestial Deity Realm, but they were far too few!

So little until it was negligible!

The vast majority of martial artists stepped over from the threshold of half-step Celestial Deity.

One medicinal pill of Ye Yuan let him break through the bottleneck that he could not break through for several tens of thousands of years?

This kind of means was also too inconceivable, right?!

Seeing the energetic and vigorous Zheng Qi, Ye Yuan also said happily, “Haha, that Brother Zheng in the past who was full of high spirits is finally back again!”

Zheng Qi laughed loudly and said, “All these are still thanks to you! I really didn’t think that your medicinal pills actually can have such a magical effect! Those ungrateful damn things will probably regret it this time until their intestines turn green, right? If I were to say, ignore all of them in the future! Whoever wants to request for pills, take divine essence stones to come and buy. One medicinal pill, 30 billion, even a single one short won’t do! Eh, Ning Zhiyuan, you’re here too?”

Zheng Qi had an excited look just now and only saw Ye Yuan in his eyes. Now, suddenly noticing the Ning Zhiyuan who was extremely embarrassed by the side, he could not help being a little surprised.

Ning Zhiyuan had a look of embarrassment, but he still gave a flattering smile and said, “Congratulations to Brother Zheng for recovering, and strength improving a step further!”

Zheng Qi rolled his eyes and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Ning Zhiyuan, your nose is sharp enough! Ye Yuan had just come back and you came to find him! The thing that your Ning Family did back then was unfair and shallow!”

Ning Zhiyuan had made the preparations to throw this old face out. Heaving a sigh, he said, “Yes, this Ning had eyes but couldn’t see. Back then, I shouldn’t have dropped a rock down the well in the elders meeting! This Ning came this time to sincerely apologize to Elder Ye!”

Zheng Qi sneered and said, “Who doesn’t know how to add flowers to embroidery? Is there really such a good thing in this world? Do you think that Ye Yuan lacks an apology from you now?”

Ning Zhiyuang had an appearance like the situation was already so bad that to make it worse makes no real difference, but his attitude was very humble as he said, “This Ning knows that saying anything now is too late. It was this Ning who was blind, so I can’t blame others. Fortunately, Tianping this child is loyal and righteous, hiding from the Ning Family’s top to bottom, accompanying Elder Ye through untold dangers. It’s also considered to have slightly made up for the mistake that this Ning made.”

Hearing Ning Zhiyuan’s words, Ye Yuan secretly scolded the sly old fox.

But this old man could swallow humiliation and bear a heavy burden, it was also considered hard on him.

Looking on the account of Ning Tianping’s face, he would not really do anything to the Ning Family either.

Hence, he opened his mouth and said indifferently, “Alright, it’s matter in the past. No need to mention them again. Elder Ning, please return!”

The moment Ning Zhiyuan heard, he could not help revealing great joy and said with clasped hands, “Elder Ye is indeed magnanimous! Then this Ning will go back first. In the future, as long as there’s use for the Ning Family, Elder Ye feel free to speak up. Oh, right, the Ning Family also collected quite a number of precious rank four spirit medicines these few years. I don’t know if they can enter Elder Ye Yuan’s arcane sights or not. Elder Ye please accept them!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said coolly, “Put it down then.”

...

Half a month passed, then news of Ye Yuan returning already spread like wildfire.

But toward this, the vast majority of the people still held disdainful attitudes.

Ruo Xu led a group of elders and gathered together. Everyone all had contemptuous expressions towards this news.

“This kid actually still had the face to come back! Reckon that he couldn’t hack it anymore outside, right?”

“Heh heh, a trash who couldn’t even break through to the Divine Lord Realm! What can he do coming back? Might as well die outside!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I guess that he also felt that he had no face to meet people, so that’s why he blocked off the news, right? But doesn’t he know that there’s a saying called ‘there isn’t a wall in the world which hasn’t a crack’?”

“Hahaha!”

...

Everyone guffawed. In their view, Ye Yuan returning and directly hiding and not meeting people, he definitely had not broken through yet and felt ashamed to meet people.

Of course, Ye Yuan even consumed a Vastsun Universe Pill back then, but it did not have any effect at all.

This was already synonymous with trash in everyone’s view.

Ruo Xu smiled and said, “You guys can’t say it like this either! Ye Yuan’s attainments in rank three divine pills are still unmatched. In this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, he still has a place for himself. That is ... making good use of trash!”

Everyone roared with laughter again, “Hahaha!”

When Ruo Xu learned of this news, he felt extremely liberated in his heart.

These few years, even though he was demoted to become the second elder, his influence in the Elder’s Association did not diminish in the slightest.

One could say that Xuan Yu this head elder was just a symbol built without foundations.

Xuan Yu did not like fighting and was also unwilling to get involved in this kind of thing.

Therefore, Ruo Xu also became even more brazen and unscrupulous.

Rather, the Martial Tower that side, Coldfeather’s control was very domineering, making it very difficult for Ruo Xu’s hand to extend his reach.

But with the power on the Pill Tower’s side, it was already enough.

After all, the Martial Tower still had to rely on the Pill Tower. Which Martial Tower elder dared to not give face to the Pill Tower’s elders?

Right at this time, a subordinate suddenly came to report, saying that Grand Elder He Chong wanted to personally convene an emergency elders meeting to discuss an important matter.

Everyone’s expressions could not help changing when they heard it. This timing was also too coincidental, right?

An elder asked, “Second Elder, could it be that this elders meeting ... is related to Ye Yuan? Otherwise, it also wouldn’t be so coincidental, right?”

“Hey! Don’t scare yourselves! Back then, Ye Yuan was practically chased out of the imperial city. If he really broke through and came back, why would he be so low-key? He would have long come to smack our faces! In my view, he doesn’t have the face to meet people! Grand Elder convening an elders meeting, I think that there should be another important matter. Perhaps Utmost Peace Imperial City is causing problems again,” said another elder.

When everyone heard that, they all nodded their heads.

One elder said with a look of dissatisfaction, “Speaking of this, I feel angry! If not for Ye Yuan and Zheng Qi, we wouldn’t be so passive right now either! This Ye Yuan is good, ownself taking the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain and running!”

Ruo Xu said, “Alright, don’t simply guess anymore. When we see Grand Elder, we’ll know.”

...

In the great hall, He Chong sat at the top position and still had an unfathomable appearance.

The elders meeting started. He Chong opened his mouth and said indifferently, “Convening everyone today, there’s an important matter to tell you all. Xuan Yu, you say it yourself.”

Everyone was uncertain what it meant, looking at Xuan Yu in surprise, not knowing what medicine was being sold in the gourd.

Xuan Yu nodded his head and slowly said, “Everyone, this old man’s personality, everyone is also aware. Taking on this position of head elder is truly a little an onerous task. Hence, I requested from City Lord and Grand Elder for me to resign from this position of head elder.”

The moment these words came out, everyone was in an uproar, everyone’s gazes cast toward Ruo Xu one after another!

Xuan Yu was ... admitting defeat?
