Chapter 1806 Not Giving Face to Anybody

On Heavenly Bud Peak, the people surrounding and watching got more and more.

Sweat gradually seeped out on Han Yong’s forehead. This commotion ... was a little too big.

Carry on stirring up trouble like this, it would alarm the sect.

The matters between disciples, as long as it did not get too overboard and did not violate the sect’s rules, the sect would not care too much.

But this incident today was blown out a little too big.

“Ye Yuan, it’s really Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk; hell has no gate yet you want to barge inside!”

The person had yet to arrive and the voice arrived first.

Clearly, it was Qian Ye who came.

The moment Zhong Hanlin heard this voice, he was immediately overjoyed. Scrambling to his feet, he laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, you’re dead for sure this time! To dare offend my Soaring Flower lineage, you’re really tired of living!”

Ye Yuan looked at him like looking at a fool and directly kicked a foot over.

Zhong Hanlin wanted to dodge, but how could he dodge? He took a hit solidly and could not get up for quite a while.

“Alright, now that my brother’s scores are squared, we should settle ours!” Ye Yuan stomped on his chest and said coldly.

Qian Ye rushed over and just happened to see this scene, and immediately burned with fury.

“Ye Yuan, let Zhong Hanlin go! Otherwise, you’ll die very horribly!” Qian Ye said in a great rage.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Are your Soaring Flower lineage all idiots? You’re already making me die very horribly, why would I still let him go?”

When everyone heard Ye Yuan’s arrogant words, they all had shocked faces.

That was Qian Ye!

This guy actually dared to speak to Qian Ye like this, he really did not know how the word death was written.

As he said, Ye Yuan even stomped on Zhong Hanlin’s chest viciously. Zhong Hanlin vomited out a large mouthful of blood with a cough.

Zhong Hanlin went utterly mad. Holding blood in his mouth, he laughed angrily and said, “Ye Yuan, you ... you just hit! The harder you hit, the more terrifying Senior Apprentice Brother Qian Ye’s revenge! Could you even dare to kill me? B-Bring it on! Kill me! H-Hahaha!”

Qian Ye had a dark look as he closed in on Ye Yuan step by step, aura growing stronger and stronger.

“What Hanlin said is right, even if lend you a few galls, do you ... dare to kill him? Using a person you don’t dare to kill to come and threaten me, how ... foolish are you?!”

Each step he took, Qian Ye’s aura climbed up a great deal.

The pressure of Celestial Deity Realm forced everyone to fall back repeatedly.

While Ye Yuan was bearing the brunt of it.

He wanted to use his aura to make Ye Yuan submit!

Crack!

Right at this time, the sound of bone breaking sounded out.

Zhong Hanlin spewed out another large mouthful of blood, his injuries already extremely severe.

Ye Yuan stomped down without the least bit of mercy.

He looked at Qian Ye and said with a faint smile, “You said that ... I don’t dare to kill him? You try saying it one more time!”

The force under Ye Yuan’s foot grew heavier and heavier. Zhong Hanlin’s eyes rolled back, the blood in his mouth dribbling out, it was evident he could not survive anymore.

When Qian Ye saw this scene, his eyes could not help turning intent, the imposing momentum on his body immediately dissipating into thin air.

He thought that with his imposing momentum coupled with the sect’s rules, he could break Ye Yuan’s will.

But who knew that Ye Yuan was not moved at all.

“Ye Yuan, you’re mad! You dare to kill your fellow apprentice within the sect?” Qian Ye’s voice was grim to the extreme.

“Fellow apprentice? Heh, these two words coming out of your mouth is really satire! During the entrance examination, Zhong Hanlin already wanted to kill me! But his strength was lacking. When it was evident that he was going to be killed by me, you ambushed me with Celestial Deity Realm cultivation! Later, I entered the sect, you used despicable means to make me go to Firecloud Peak to open up an abode. You dare say that ... you didn’t do it in order to kill me? If it’s merely these, forget it too. Han Yong had no grudge nor enmity with you guys. But just because of our relationship, Zhong Hanlin crippled his cultivation and even had his subordinates humiliate him. Today, you guys must die!”

Ye Yuan’s words were cast loudly, making everyone get a big shock.

They had never heard before that among the disciples who entered the sect this season, there was actually still such a monstrous existence.

The key point was that Qian Ye went to ambush Ye Yuan with First Firmament Celestial Deity strength and Ye Yuan actually survived safe and sound!

This kind of thing was simply inconceivable.

Qian Ye’s methods also indeed made people feel contempt.

Entrance examination, to actually deal a deadly blow toward a disciple who had not officially entered the sect, too shameless!

Qian Ye looked at the Zhong Hanlin spasming on the ground and said in a solemn voice, “You quickly let him go! If Zhong Hanlin dies, you have to die too!”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Is that so? That doesn’t need you to worry about it.”

Qian Ye’s expression was gloomy, his gaze also flickering waveringly.

Suddenly, several figures flew over from the horizon. Qian Ye’s eyes lit up, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan became gloating.

“Impudent thing, to actually dare harm your fellow apprentice in broad daylight! How do you plead?!”

A middle-aged man landed from the sky. His aura was extraordinary. He was clearly a high-level Celestial Deity Realm.

Looking at the Zhong Hanlin who was already heavily injured on the verge of death under Ye Yuan’s foot, the middle-aged man was greatly enraged.

Qian Ye cupped his fists and said, “Deacon Zheng, this boy is very cruel and savage. He beat Zhong Hanlin until like this without a word after coming up Heavenly Bud Peak! Not eliminating this fiend, our Shadowmoon Sect disciples will be bitterly disappointed!”

Deacon Zheng glared at Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice, “This seat is the Law Enforcement Hall’s Deacon Zheng Yunzhe. Now, I order you to let Zhong Hanlin go and surrender without resisting, and accept the sect’s punishment!”

Ye Yuan looked at Deacon Zheng and suddenly grinned and said, “Deacon Zheng, if I didn’t guess wrongly, you’re also a member of the Soaring Flower lineage, right?”

Deacon Zheng’s face changed and he said in a cold voice, “Insolence! Upon entering the sect, all of us are Shadowmoon Sect’s disciples! Little animal, still not letting him go, don’t blame me for not being courteous anymore!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “Come on, I want to see how you won’t be courteous!”

As he said, the force under his foot grew a little heavier again.

The pitiful Zhong Hanlin was already only breathing in and not breathing out anymore.

This guy wanted to kill him time and again, how could Ye Yuan possibly let him off.

When Deacon Zheng saw this scene, his face turned grim to the extreme.

This Ye Yuan did not give any face to him at all. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Zhong Hanlin was a cornerstone talent of the Soaring Flower lineage. Even though he could not compare to Baili Qingyan, his position was also irreplaceable.

Therefore, he could not die.

It was also precisely because of this that Deacon Zheng and Qian Ye would hold back from taking action for fear of repercussions.

Just as both parties were at a standoff, more and more people swarmed over.

The news spread throughout the entire Shadowmoon Sect very quickly!

On Canopy Peak, when Baili Qingyan heard this news, her lovely body could not help trembling, and she disappeared from where she stood with a flash.

On Tianying Peak, a woodcutter who was currently chopping firewood suddenly had his thoughts stir and he said with a smile, “Heh, this kid indeed didn’t disappoint this old man! It’s just that, this old man wants to know how you’re planning on clearing this hurdle?”

Done talking, his body gradually dissipated in place, finally turning into nothing.

While at this time, an old man slowly walked out, arrived in front of Ye Yuan, and said in a solemn voice, “I’m Heavenly Bud Peak’s Antehall head elder. Young man, show mercy whenever possible. Give this old man some face and let Zhong Hanlin go.”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “Sorry about it, today, I’m not giving anybody face. He must die!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan suddenly stomped down, Zhong Hanlin’s chest was directly caved in.
