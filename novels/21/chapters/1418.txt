1422 Complete Version Sundering Stars!

Two figures were like phantoms, intertwining each other in the air, emitting a series of horrifying sound waves.

Regardless of whether it was the White Night Sacred Palace’s martial artists or the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s powerhouses, they were all made uneasy by the great battle here.

Huo Tianyang’s expression was even more incomparably ugly. Just what kind of a freak did the White Night Sacred Palace find?

Grotto Profound Deity Realm fighting fiercely with Heaven Glimpse Realm, and this battle was actually evenly-matched?

Really a sheer fantasy!

On Lan Zhiru’s side, the more he fought, the more alarmed he got.

He simply did not dare to believe that such a horrifying attack, Ye Yuan was actually able to unleash it move after move!

Those who did not know would even think that Ye Yuan was a Heaven Glimpse powerhouse.

However, Ye Yuan was clearly just a grand completion Grotto Profound martial artist. He did not even reach half-step Heaven Glimpse.

This guy in front of him completely ran counter to common sense!

Ye Yuan’s chopping strike was overwhelming, making Lan Zhiru want to vomit blood several times.

Facing a Grotto Profound Realm martial artist, he was actually being suppressed all-round!

“I want to see just what your limit is! I don’t believe that you, a Grotto Profound Realm martial artist, can really release this kind of martial technique limitlessly!”

Lan Zhiru was beaten by Ye Yuan until he had no strength to retaliate. He also resolved his heart to continue dawdling with Ye Yuan.

Of course, he seemed to not have better ideas too.

Under this sort of circumstance, the only thing that he could do was to wait for Ye Yuan’s divine essence to run out.

At that time, it would be the chance for his counter-attack.

Bai Chen was excited until his face flushed red. He knew that Master Ye Yuan was very strong, but did not think that he could be strong to such an extent!

This battle, Ye Yuan would most certainly win!

Suddenly, he raised his long spear and said sternly, “Kill, kill, kill! Blood debts need to be paid in blood! Today, we’ll make the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s vermins come without returning!”

Done talking, Bai Chen brought along an indomitable imposing momentum and joined the tangled warfare.

His spear art broke through before this. Now, his strength had increased greatly. Facing off against the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s Grotto Profound powerhouses, he did not fall into a disadvantage in the slightest.

Under this sort of circumstance, the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s declining trend gradually manifested.

Due to low-end combat power being lacking, the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s Grotto Profound martial artists often had to face two, even three opponents.

In Huo Tianyang’s original plans, although the manpower on their side was low, the high-end combat power was very adequate.

The White Night Sacred Palace missing Bai Yehai, their side would be able to directly crush with the high-end combat power.

In front of Heaven Glimpse Deity Realms, those Grotto Profound had no place to show their abilities at all.

But now, he was hindered by Gui Yun, unable to make time at all.

This way, both parties’ combat power became much more balanced.

What was even more damnable was that Ye Yuan actually tied down the only additional Heaven Glimpse powerhouse, Lan Zhiru!

The White Night Sacred Palace’s advantage in numbers became increasingly evident.

Bai Chen joining the group battles, he had an appearance that feared no death, charging ahead crazily.

He hated Huo Tianyang to the extreme. When fighting at this time, it was really without regard for his life.

The others being infected by him, each and every one of them also became greatly roused in spirit, killing until the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace threw away their helmet and coat of mail.

Very soon, casualties started appearing on the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s side!

Huo Tianyang was burning with anxiety, but could not do anything to Gui Yun at all.

The Nether Ghostclaw was truly incomparably powerful. No matter how hard he attacked, it was to no avail.

Gui Yun’s Ghost Dao Hundred Runes was already cultivated to the third rune. Although his realm had yet to break through, his strength advanced by leaps and bounds.

Jumping realms to battle was not a big deal to him.

After all, this Ghost Dao Hundred Runes was the Ghost Dao’s first-rate secret art!

Huo Tianyang never thought that the battle situation would actually play out to this kind of situation.

How could he still think about swallowing up the White Night Sacred Palace now? He only wanted to quickly get away now.

But the White Night Sacred Palace’s people were all crazed with fighting, each and every one of them was like being injected with stimulants, pestering incessantly, not giving them the chance to get out at all.

Retreating at this time was too dangerous. They were bound to suffer heavy losses.

Boom!

Right at this time, a violent explosion sound came from the other side.

Huo Tianyang’s expression turned austere. Finding time to sneak a glance, he could not help being greatly astonished in his heart. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lan Zhiru was bathed in blood from head to toe, in a sorry plight, fresh blood spraying wildly from his mouth. Clearly, he almost could not hold on anymore.

In contrast, Ye Yuan raised his long sword and rushed over again.

Huo Tianyang was incomparably shocked in his heart. How could a Grotto Profound Deity Realm martial artist possibly be tough to such a degree?

Looking at it, Lan Zhiru was going to fall in Ye Yuan’s hands sooner or later!

At the start, his thinking was the same as Lan Zhiru’s, feeling that Ye Yuan could only persist for a little while.

That kind of swift and fierce martial technique, it was impossible to release limitlessly.

But a long time had already passed, and Ye Yuan had released no idea how many sword moves and still did not show signs of his divine essence being depleted!

Could it be that this guy’s divine essence was limitless?

At this very moment, Huo Tianyang already wanted to beat a retreat in his heart.

Carry on hesitating, the situation would probably be even worse!

Lan Zhiru looked at Ye Yuan who was walking over slowly. His expression flickered incessantly.

“You ... Could it be that your divine essence is endless? How ... How can it be like this?”

Lan Zhiru’s voice was filled with helplessness and despair.

The existence of this guy in front of him completely subverted his understanding of this world.

Everything and everything was completely different from common sense.

Now, he smelled the smell of death.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a faint smile, “A dead person doesn’t need to know so much.”

Lan Zhiru’s expression was ugly to the extreme. Gritting his teeth, he said fiercely, “I don’t believe that a Grotto Profound can really defy the heavens! Soul Devouring Nine Sword’s Ninth Sword, Soul Devouring Blood Slaughter!”

Suddenly, fresh blood surged within Lan Zhiru’s body. It rose up crazily.

Huo Tianyang’s expression changed. Lan Zhiru was actually being forced to this extent?

This Soul Devouring Blood Slaughter was sacrificing one’s life as the price, obtaining a large increase in strength within a short time.

Although the power was extremely terrifying, when this move was used until the end, he himself would also kick the bucket.

Lan Zhiru was going for mutual destruction here!

Pfft!

Bai Chen rallied a spear vigorously, directly penetrating the chest of an opposing Grotto Profound powerhouse.

Right at this time, he sensed a powerful to the extreme aura.

Turning back to look, his expression could not help changing drastically.

“Not good! Master Ye Yuan is in danger!” Bai Chen’s expression changed as he said.

“What a powerful aura! Lan Zhiru was merely a newly-entered initial-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouse before this. The aura now already rose to the peak of initial-stage Heaven Glimpse!”

“This guy is going for mutual destruction, wanting to drag Lord Ye Yuan down before his death too!”

“Damn it! What a powerful sword! Lord Ye Yuan ... is in danger!”

...

When the White Night Sacred Palace martial artists who were just finishing off the battles saw this scene, each and every one of their expressions changed greatly.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene with an indifferent look and said nonchalantly, “Boring game! Since that’s the case, I’ll use the complete version Sundering Stars to send you on your way then!”

Ye Yuan’s sword slowly raised up.

An ordinary and bland sword, the surroundings did not have the least bit of undulations.

The people around them could not even perceive any aura from this act of Ye Yuan. No one could feel any undulations of the power of laws.

“My sword! It actually ... It’s actually out of control!”

“Mine too! It ... It’s trembling!”

...

At this time, the swords in the hands of all people who used swords actually had a feeling of getting out of control.
