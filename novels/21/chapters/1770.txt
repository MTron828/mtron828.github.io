1774 Void Realm, Sundered Boundary

Heavenly Tiger King had a pained look on his face. He really regretted it greatly now.

If he had long known what would happen today, why didn’t he wait longer?

At least, Tigerheart did not really die, right?

Upon entering the Magic Eye Grotto, it was completely impossible for a person to survive.

It was said that even Empyrean Cloudridge did not dare to enter deep inside!

Right at this time, Tigerheart suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Father, let me go!”

Heavenly Tiger King’s tiger body trembled, looked at Tigerheart, and said, “If you go, there’s no possibility of coming out again!”

Tigerheart let out a sigh and said, “Father, Tigerheart living a second life is overwhelmed with many emotions! This matter was us harming the innocent in the first place. We were at fault first. Lord Ye Yuan’s loyalty is mind-boggling, not scrupling to enter the Magic Eye Grotto for his brother. What do I, Tigerheart, have to fear? If His Excellency dies inside, I’ll accompany him! This is what us father and son owe him!”

In an instant, everyone within the cave did not seem to know Tigerheart anymore.

In the past, Tigerheart was arrogant and domineering, looking down on everyone and everything, like a child who never grew up.

But experiencing life and death this time, it was as if his entire person had changed.

Ye Yuan glanced at Tigerheart rather surprisedly, also not expecting that he would actually take the initiative to request to enter with him.

But very soon, he understood.

Between life and death, one could have a great awakening.

The current Tigerheart was like him back then.

Entering the Magic Eye Grotto this time, if he did not die, Tigerheart would definitely have great accomplishments in the future.

Heavenly Tiger King had a conflicted look. Finally, he still heaved a long sigh and said, “Forget it. You go with him!”

...

Standing in front of the Magic Eye Grotto, Ye Yuan seemed to see a primitive behemoth currently opening its gaping maws, wanting to swallow this mountain in one bite.

The light outside was clearly very good. But such a large cave, one actually could not even see the entrance of the cave!

Inside was endless darkness.

The Heavenly Tiger King looked at that cave entrance and said with a fearful look, “This place is the Magic Eye Grotto. No one has ever known what’s inside and no one dares to go in as well.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Clearly, he also felt the terror of this Magic Eye Grotto.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and slowly walked over toward the Magic Eye Grotto.

Tigerheart said to the Heavenly Tiger King, “This child is going. Father, take care!”

Finished talking, Tigerheart jogged along and followed behind Ye Yuan.

Stepping into the Magic Eye Grotto, the figures of a human and a tiger were seemingly directly gobbled up by the enormous mouth, disappearing.

Ye Yuan only felt a blur before his eyes. When he looked back, how was there still the Skydemon Mountain Range’s shadow?

“Your Excellency, we ... seem to have come to another space!” Tigerheart said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Looks like this so-called Magic Eye Grotto is an entrance to another space. Furthermore, this entrance is one-directional, we can’t go back anymore.”

Tigerheart could not help being overjoyed when he heard that and said, “In that case, this place isn’t a death zone. Then Brother White Light should still be alive?”

But Ye Yuan did not have any joy on his face. Clearly, he was not as optimistic as Tigerheart.

“This place isn’t a nice place, but there’s always an additional glimmer of hope. But I hope that I can find him. You should be able to break through to late-stage rank four after you eat it. Wait until after you break through, then we’ll set off again.”

While talking, Ye Yuan threw Tigerheart a medicinal pill.

Tigerheart said in surprise, “This ... This is a void spirit divine-grade Blazing Sun Skyflame Pill! Could this medicinal pill be refined by Your Excellency?”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said, “If I didn’t have this bit of ability, could I bring you back to life?”

When Tigerheart heard that, he said embarrassedly, “Haha, makes sense. However, doesn’t Your Excellency blame me for harming Brother White Light?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “This wasn’t your original intention. I was angry at your father maligning the innocent indiscriminately. Moreover, every injustice had its perpetrator, every debt its debtor. This matter can’t be blamed on you.”

The moment Tigerheart heard, he could not resist saying, “Actually, Father he ...”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and interrupted, “You don’t need to explain. If White Light is fine, everything is naturally easy to discuss.”

Tigerheart did not dare to say any more words and could only secretly pray for White Light to be okay.

He swallowed the demon divine pill that Ye Yuan gave and started breaking through in closed-seclusion.

To the demon race, the bottleneck from middle-stage to late-stage was even harder to break through than the human race’s.

Hence, the standing of priests in the demon race carried decisive weight.

Even if the Heavenly Tiger King really wanted to massacre Tiger Bright Imperial City, he also did not dare to do anything to the Priest Temple.

Otherwise, he would die without even knowing how he died.

Tigerheart’s strength was similar to Blackpupil’s and White Light’s. Presently, White Light’s strength already reached peak middle-stage rank four as well.

In-between this, they likely could not dispense with a bout of lucky chances.

Now, Ye Yuan produced the void spirit divine-grade Blazing Sun Skyflame Pill the moment he took action. Helping Tigerheart to break through was naturally something that was achieved without extra effort.

After Tigerheart went into meditation, Ye Yuan set up an array formation, isolating his aura. He then started surveying the vicinity.

This place was a region of bleak and desolation; quarry rocks and craggy rocks.

Furthermore, this place was completely in darkness, unable to see one’s fingers when the hand was stretched out.

“Senior, what place is this?”

Dustless had vast experiences and knowledge. Facing this kind of unknown place, Ye Yuan naturally had to consult him.

Dustless shook his head and said, “I’ve never seen this kind of place before as well. But looking at it, it’s like a sundered boundary between the Heavenspan World and the Void Realms.”

“Void Realm? Sundered boundary?” It was still Ye Yuan’s first place hearing these terms and could not help but wonder.

Dustless said, “The Heavenspan World has existed for God knows how many hundreds of millions of years already. The small worlds left behind are too many to enumerate. Small worlds will gradually die along with the passage of time. But some major powers can connect their small worlds with the Heavenspan World, becoming one with the Heavenspan World. At the same time, it stands independent outside of the Heavenspan World. This kind of small world is extremely stable and people won’t easily die. They will leave behind their legacies and descendants there, living and propagating. Places like this are called Void Realms. And the place of transit between Void Realms and the Heavenspan World are known as sundered boundaries! This kind of place is very unique and will tend to give rise to some powerful existences.”

Ye Yuan was surprised inwardly, not expecting that the Heavenspan World still had this kind of place.

The world was truly so big that there was nothing to be surprised about!

However, he frowned and said, “No wonder I keep feeling that this place is threatened by a crisis of danger. Looks like this sundered boundary likely has some powerful existence!”

Dustless nodded and said, “I’m afraid so!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s face changed. A black shadow tore across the night sky, heading toward Tigerheart who was currently at the juncture of breaking through.

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan brandished his long sword and actually reached first despite launching later, stabbing at that black shadow.

Bang!

That black shadow was directly hacked by Ye Yuan’s one sword.

“Howl, howl!”

The black shadow emitted yelping cries when it felt pain.

Ye Yuan’s face fell, only then, discerning that this was a ferocious black wolf.

The might of its strength actually already reached late-stage rank four.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan was secretly shocked. This black wolf was actually completely unscathed taking on a sword from him!

Ye Yuan focused his eyes and looked. This hungry wolf had blood-shot eyes. Saliva was dribbling down its mouth as if it was currently in a state of rampage.

But right at this time, one dark shadow after another suddenly appeared in the darkness.

Ye Yuan focused his eyes and looked around. Tigerheart and he were actually already surrounded by hundreds of fierce beasts.

These fierce beasts’ conditions were the same as that black wolf’s.
