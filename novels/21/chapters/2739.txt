Chapter 2745: Hundred Herbs Illustrated Handbook

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing the dazzling array of natural treasures in front of him, Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up.

This time, it was really an abundant harvest.

There were many finished heavenly pills in this Treasure Depository Pavilion.

They were basically all grade five heavenly pills!

Furthermore, there were even some true grade heavenly pills among them!

It seemed like what Mi Tian said was not false. The weakest in the Labyrinth Divine Palace was also at the realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven!

However, he did not find grade six heavenly pills here. It seemed like this place did not even count as outer-sect.

Apart from these, there were also many natural treasures and rare materials here, such as the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation.

These natural treasures were not suitable for refining pills, but the effects were not weaker than heavenly pills.

In addition, there were also several dozen grade one grandmist treasures!

Grandmist treasures that were hard to come across in the outside world were basically cabbages here!

Of course, Ye Yuan was not interested in grandmist treasures.

But, with these heavenly pills, Ye Yuan had a crazy idea.

Back then, the Pill Alliance brought several times the number of Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s Jade Sovereign Heavens and destroyed the sect.

Today, he could bring a bunch of Saint Sovereign Heavens to attack the Pill Alliance!

If there were sufficient heavenly medicines, Ye Yuan could naturally create a Saint Sovereign Heaven army.

But sadly, heavenly medicines were too hard to find.

But these heavenly pills in front of him could create a large number of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

At that time, thinking of how several dozen Saint Sovereign Heavens descended upon the Pill Alliance, Ye Yuan really wanted to see what kind of expression Li Changsheng would have!

Back then, the Sacred Destiny Pill that the five great kings and Meng Frostwind fought desperately to seize, there were several dozen bottles of it here!

Furthermore, the quality of these Sacred Destiny Pills was extremely high. They were at least all at the level of eighth grade!

Well-worthy of being the former number one great sect of the heavens, they were indeed immensely wealthy!

These things did not even count as a single hair from nine oxen to the Labyrinth Divine Palace. But, to these people from outside, it was a massive fortune!

Ye Yuan put away the treasures and appeared in front of everyone. Everyone’s breathing became ragged.

There were too many good items inside!

If not for being wary of Ye Yuan, they wished to kill and seize the treasures right now.

Ye Yuan was not stingy either. After coming out, he immediately took out 12 grandmist treasures and threw them to those Saint Sovereign Heavens.

“One article for each person! The rest, I still have to share with others and won’t be giving to you all,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Saint Exalt Waycloud held a grandmist treasure long sword and said gleefully, “With this sword, my strength will increase greatly! Right now, even if it’s facing off against a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, I have the strength to fight too!”

“Good stuff! Good stuff! Thank you, Younger Brother Ye! This time, without you, us old things would have to lose our lives here, let alone talk about getting such fine treasures!” Saint Exalt Purplesun stroked his grandmist treasure and said with reluctance to let go of it.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There’s no hurry. You all take these heavenly pills! These heavenly pills are sufficient for you all to cultivate to middle Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud said in disbelief, “Sovereign Extreme Qi Supplementing Pill! This … This is a grade five cultivation heavenly pill, a-are you really going to give it to us?”

Ye Yuan said, “Our common goal is the Pill Alliance! The stronger you all are, the less fearful the Pill Alliance will be! Enough, take them!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s expression was solemn and he said, “Younger Brother Ye, you repaid evil with good and are broadminded; this exalt admires! You rest assured, this exalt will definitely go all out to destroy the Pill Alliance!”

The others also expressed their stands one after another.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This isn’t just for me. It’s also for yourselves. I believe everyone! Alright, there’s still a Scripture Library in front, let’s go together and have a look.”

As he said, Ye Yuan led the way and continued deeper in.

Back then, when the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s mountain pass gates were breached, this outer-sect’s losses were relatively small instead.

Actually, a lot of those corrupt corpses outside were the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s disciples.

They were actually killed by the aftermath of the powerhouses’ battles.

As for the things here, they were relatively well-preserved.

Very soon, Ye Yuan found the scripture library under Mi Tian’s guidance. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

This was just the outer-sect’s Scripture Library. There were not a lot of profound stuff. But, to these people, it was sufficient.

There were many cultivation methods in the Scripture Library.

To these Jade Sovereign Heavens and Saint Sovereign Heavens, they naturally behaved like they obtained priceless treasures.

Ye Yuan was not very interested in these. The things he was more interested in were the alchemy path and formation path records.

“Eh,?Hundred Herbs Illustrated Handbook!”

Ye Yuan discovered that this name was written on a jade slip and immediately became interested.

“Kid, this thing is a good thing to you! Back then, the Labyrinth Divine Palace was extremely powerful. There are none of the natural treasures of all the heavens that they can’t obtain! Therefore, their powerful heavenly alchemists also listed an extremely detailed heavenly medicine catalog! It’s estimated that 80% of all the heavens’ heavenly medicines were recorded in it. Of course, apart from this Hundred Herbs Illustrated Handbook, they still have illustrations of other rare materials, so on and so forth. However, this is the most suitable for you!”

Mi Tian talked about this as if enumerating his family’s valuables.

The reason why he was so familiar with the Labyrinth Divine Palace was that he was on extremely close terms with one of the palace masters.

At that time, Mi Tian was the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s frequent guest.

It was just that sadly, that palace master fell later on.

And his successor was also the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s last palace master. Although his strength was head and shoulders above all others, his ambition was also extremely inflated, resulting in leading to the results later on.

When Ye Yuan heard, his eyes could not help lighting up.

This Hundred Herbs Illustrated Handbook was simply too important to him!

With it, Ye Yuan’s alchemy path would go even more smoothly!

Sinking his divine sense in, one image after another, and words, were displayed in front of Ye Yuan.

The records of those heavenly medicines were all extremely detailed.

One had to know, every one of those heavenly alchemists in the Labyrinth Divine Palace had the ability to shock the heavens.

Although Ye Yuan was extremely talented, the current him was still too weak compared to those people.

The medicinal properties of these heavenly medicines, growth environment, so on and so forth, were all recorded one by one.

“There’s actually such a thing! What Senior said is right. This is indeed too important to me!” Ye Yuan said happily.

Briefly browsing through some of the heavenly medicines, Ye Yuan discovered that the descriptions on it were virtually identical to his own understanding!

The depths of these heavenly alchemists’ skill could be seen!

The medicinal properties of these heavenly medicines from grade one to grade four, Ye Yuan could be said to know them like the back of his hand!

Ye Yuan examined his own conscience. On the Rainclear Continent, most likely apart from Li Changsheng, there was no one more formidable than him.

But these heavenly alchemists were really formidable.

“Huhu,?this old man knew that you needed this thing. That’s why I specifically guided you to come here. Apart from this, there’s also the Formation Dao Nine Thousand Scrolls over there. However, this place is just the outer-sect. It likely won’t be the entire book. In the future, when your strength is sufficient, you can enter the true Labyrinth Divine Palace. That place is where the real treasures are. However, when the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s mountain pass gates were smashed back then, it’s likely that the treasures inside have all been moved out by people. Whether or not you can find it will depend on your luck,” Mi Tian said with a smile.

When Ye Yuan heard, he could not help being captivated.

This Labyrinth Divine Palace was really full of treasures everywhere!

The number one major sect across every heaven and myriad worlds was really not a boast!
