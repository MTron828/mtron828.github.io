Chapter 2885 The Peerless Genius That Slowly Rose!

“I …”

Bang!

The complexions of the contestants turned deathly pale. Their gazes, when looking at Ye Yuan, were filled with fear and indignation.

On the stage, the opponent was gone before he had time to admit defeat. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Yuan already became the nightmare of all the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons.

Whoever encountered him had simply encountered eight lifetimes of bad luck.

At another arena match, two hundred sons contestants fought until they already had completely no strength in the end, fighting like mortals.

“I beg you, concede defeat!”

“I … I won’t concede even if I lose, I give up on this! I’ll be able to avoid that demon if I beat you!”

“Since that’s the case, irreconcilable till death then!”

“Irreconcilable till death!”

……

At another arena match, two hundred sons contestants spoke in unison.

“I concede!”

“Judge, I admitted defeat first!”

“Uttering nonsense! I was clearly the first to concede defeat!”

……

In the end, the two started fighting.

Between these two, whoever won had to encounter Ye Yuan.

The entire hundred sons selection, all the fights related to Ye Yuan had already become a hot mess.

The judges wished to tear Ye Yuan to shreds alive.

This guy was purely here to cause trouble!

In this match, Ye Yuan’s opponent was Bloodage, who was once called the number one person.

These two strongest men finally matched up.

This battle also attracted the attention of countless people, including Ye Wugui.

Bloodage’s strength was extremely strong. He could be said to be the well-deserved number

one.

But now, Ye Yuan was already the uncrowned king. Whoever encountered him would be frightened.

It was not because he was strong, but it was because he killed people on sight.

Ye Yuan looked at Bloodage opposite and said with a smile, “Everyone says that you’re this period’s hundred sons number one. You wouldn’t be the same as them, admitting defeat when you see me, right?”

Bloodage looked at Ye Yuan and did not speak.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “If even you admit defeat too, that’s also too boring!”

Swoosh!

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan actually arrived right in front of Bloodage with an instantaneous movement.

The speed was inconceivably swift!

Ye Yuan knew that this Bloodage was very strong. He could not give him time to react.

“I concede!”

However, Ye Yuan’s figure had just moved, and Bloodage blurted it out without the slightest hesitation.

He directly admitted defeat very straightforwardly!

This punch of Ye Yuan’s could not be sent out anymore.

After admitting defeat, killing was not allowed.

Whoosh!

A series of exclamations came from all around!

“Bloodage actually admitted defeat!” “Too amazing! He’s the first to concede defeat under Bloodazure’s hands!”

“Yeah, well-deserving of being the former number one! His strength is simply too strong to actually have time to admit defeat!”

What they were amazed by was not that Bloodage actually admitted defeat, but it was that Bloodage actually succeeded in admitting defeat!

Ye Wugui was dumbfounded!

What the freaking hell is this?

My blood race had unparalleled combat power and never feared death!

Today, honor was actually felt for being able to admit defeat?

Did you people still have any backbone or not?

Also, this Bloodage, can’t you freaking concede after exchanging two moves?

Was there a need to be so straightforward?

Although Ye Yuan was strong, you are not weak either!

Don’t even dare to attempt it?

Got to say, Bloodage’s fighting power was absolutely formidable.

Before Ye Yuan’s sudden emergence, his first place was practically locked in already.

If they were to really fight, he might not be Ye Yuan’s match, but it was also not to the extent of being the same as the others, being blown up at once.

However, it was such a genius who did not even have the courage to make a move against Ye Yuan!

“Enough, Bloodazure! You’ve already defeated Bloodage and proved your strength. This seat orders you to immediately withdraw from the hundred sons selection!” Ye Wugui’s furious voice came from above the sky.

At this rate, the entire hundred sons selection would become a farce.

Ye Wugui’s angry yell also shocked everyone immensely.

Even a Hegemon Realm powerhouse was enraged. Did you not have any freaking clue in your heart?

Ye Yuan looked above the sky and said with a helpless look, “Then, can I still enter the blood pool if I withdraw now?”

“Pffft!”

Everyone seemed to have heard the sound of Ye Wugui’s vomiting blood.

“Yes!” Ye Wugui’s voice was filled with anger.

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said, “Fine, then I’ll withdraw. Sigh, not a single one who can fight. How boring.”

“Puu, puu, puu!”

A series of blood-puking sounds came from all around.

Not that no one could fight, it was that you were too vicious!

You freaking took people’s lives the moment you came up. Who dared to fight with you?

Ye Yuan also felt quite helpless about this result.

He originally wanted to kill some more, but in this kind of tournament, the opponents that could be killed were truly limited.

Killing match by match was too troublesome. He also just took it as passing the time.

However, Ye Yuan was still rather regretful for not being able to kill Bloodage.

He knew that this Bloodage was very strong!

Before him, he was reputed to be a genius with extremely high hopes of stepping into the Hegemon Realm.

This kind of praise was not many, even in the blood race with powerhouses plentiful as clouds.

Finally, Ye Yuan still withdrew from this boring fight.

Then the Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City decided that the Battle of Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons would be redone!

Being bored out of his mind, Ye Yuan went to watch the True Sovereign Hundred Sons’ final battle.

Yang Qing was still as coquettish as ever. He was powerful and still liked to act coquettish, the aggro points maxing out.

He broke through to half-step Emperor Realm too. His current strength was really like the noonday sun.

His opponents’ death rate was also extremely high.

However, Yang Qing was ultimately not Ye Yuan. It was impossible to kill among his peers until they felt terrified.

After the selection reached the final stage, Yang Qing also encountered his match.

Reaching this level, even Ye Yuan also had no choice but to admit that the blood race’s hundred sons battle was really strong!

Especially the top ten hundred sons, their strength was simply strong until it made people’s hair stand on end.

The blood race was indeed able to give birth to a large batch of powerhouses using this kind of cruel selection method.

Furthermore, the hundred sons battle took place every ten years. The speed of giving birth to powerhouses was also very fast.

Ten years were merely a snap of a finger to these Heavenly Stratum powerhouses.

In the end, Yang Qing also suffered a crushing defeat, only attaining ninth place!

There were actually still eight people whose strength was higher than Yang Qing’s in True Sovereign Heaven Realm.

Actually, with the battle achievement of ninth place, Yang Qing could already be sufficiently proud.

After all, the blood race’s True Sovereign Heavens could be calculated in the hundreds of millions!

It was just that when he knew about the battle situation on the Saint Sovereign Heavens’ side, he really could not show off.

F*ck, this is too demoralizing!

Ye Yuan this fellow is always feeding me sh*t!

He exerted all of his strength and only took ninth place. This guy was good, directly killing until others were fighting to concede.

Even the first place Bloodage did not dare to confront Ye Yuan head-on.

Humph humph!

One day, this genius is going to surpass you in posturing!

… …

The curtains fell on the hundred sons battle. The new Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons were also screened through.

However, Ye Yuan did not enter the ranks of the hundred sons.

This guy, whatever Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons could no longer highlight his status anymore.

A dazzling genius slowly rose in the blood

race.

Ye Yuan’s appearance caused a huge reverberation in the blood race.

His performance was too monstrous!

It was really unassuming when not making a sound but making one’s mark at the first shot!

The powerhouses who advanced to Hegemon Realm in the recent few thousand years, even the performance of the strongest one back then, could not match up to one-ten-thousandth of Ye Yuan’s too.

Therefore, the blood race powerhouses were all extremely excited.

They could already feel that before long, a new Hegemon Realm powerhouse would be born!
