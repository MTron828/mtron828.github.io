Chapter 2699: Myriad Realms Mountain!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Five half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens, this was a rather shocking lineup.

One had to know, in the entire Land of Heavenly South, there was only Meng Frostwind, this one half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven.

With five great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens joining forces, one had to say that it was a miracle for Heavenly South City to not be breached up till now.

“The Land of Heavenly South and Myriad Demons Mountain have always stayed out of each other’s business. Why did you all invade Heavenly South?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

“Stayed out of each others’ business??Huhu!?Meng Frostwind and the five kings entered a mystic realm together. In the end, he scammed the five kings at the critical juncture and snatched a treasure away. Now, he’s gone missing! Since we can’t find him, then we came to destroy Heavenly South!” Greenrock said.

Ye Yuan was also dumbfounded with shock when he heard it. It turned out that this was all a problem caused by Meng Frostwind.

Speaking with which, Ye Yuan really had not met this city lord before. It turned out that he had been planning to enter the mystic realm all along.

However, making the entire Heavenly South become the scapegoat for the trouble that he caused, it was really too much.

At present, no need to look around, and Ye Yuan also knew that the Land of Heavenly South would be plunged into an abyss of suffering.

However, Ye Yuan guessed that what Meng Frostwind snatched away must be a treasure that was related to stepping into Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Otherwise, it was impossible for these five kings to be so enraged.

A lucky chance to step into Saint Sovereign Heaven was too precious.

Ye Yuan did not believe that Meng Frostwind did not know the consequences. But he still did it anyway. This kind of character really made people despise.

But right now, being any more furious was to no avail either. It was best to resolve the problem at hand.

“What did Meng Frostwind snatch away?” Ye Yuan asked/

Greenrock was disdainful in his heart and wanted to say a few words of ridicule, but when the words reached the tip of his tongue, it was swallowed back.

“Grade five heavenly pill, Sacred Destiny Pill!” Greenrock said.

Ye Yuan was suddenly enlightened, thinking to himself that it was indeed like so!

However, he was a little surprised too. He did not expect that there were actually grade five heavenly pills in this mystic realm!

He had seen before this Sacred Destiny Pill in Zhong Jianchou’s jade slip. It was a kind of grade five heavenly pill that could increase the chances of breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven. No wonder these half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens were so crazy.

Half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven was half a step away from Saint Sovereign Heaven to begin with.

With the help of a Sacred Destiny Pill, their possibility of stepping into Saint Sovereign Heaven would greatly increase.

Ye Yuan kept the Dragon Spring Sword and said coolly, “Come on, lead the way.”

Greenrock was slightly taken aback and said, “Go? Go where?”

Ye Yuan said, “I want to meet the five kings.”

Greenrock was taken aback again and immediately snickered as he said, “You really want to repay Meng Frostwind’s debt? Can you repay it? It’s true that you’re indeed formidable, but can you take out a Sacred Destiny Pill? The five kings don’t want anything. They just want the Sacred Destiny Pill!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “That’s not what you have to worry about. Just lead the way.”

In such a large-scale war, the transmission array must have already been broken by the true spirit army.

He would definitely encounter large groups of true spirits along the way, so Ye Yuan must have a guide.

Otherwise, the number of true spirits was too many to kill.

Greenrock sneered and said, “Since you want to court death, then this commander will grant your wish!”

… …

Ye Yuan did not even enter Calm South City and just brought Greenrock and left.

This journey took a month on foot.

However, Ye Yuan urged his speed to the extreme and set off for Heavenly South City.

Greenrock followed behind and was struck dumb with amazement in his heart.

He already urged his speed to the extreme and actually could not quite keep up with Ye Yuan’s speed!

One had to know, Ye Yuan was not making use of any treasure to make progress. He was completely relying on his own strength to march forward.

He even felt that if not for Ye Yuan deliberately maintaining the distance, he would have long been shaken off.

This guy was really a freak!

However, along the way, Ye Yuan’s heart was similarly rising and falling like waves, extremely shocked.

He learned about the origin of the Heavenspan Mountain from Mi Tian.

It turned out that the Heavenspan Mountain in his hands was just a part of an ultimate treasure!

Furthermore, the Heavenspan Mountain was already severely damaged. That was why it dropped to a heavenly spirit treasure.

This ultimate treasure was the chaos sacred treasure that shocked the 33 Heavens back then, the Myriad Realms Mountain!

The meaning was the mountain that suppressed myriad realms!

Its power could be used to access heaven and penetrate the earth.

Above heavenly spirit treasure was grandmist treasure.

And grandmist treasures were divided into a total of five ranks.

Rank one was the weakest; rank five was the strongest. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Dragon Spring Sword was just a rank one grandmist treasure, while the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was a rank two grandmist treasure.

The disparity between the two was extremely large in the first place.

The power of a rank five grandmist treasure was simply unimaginable.

Above grandmist treasure was chaos sacred treasure!

Myriad Realms Mountain was personally forged by the Lord of Chaos that awed the 33 Heavens.

He traveled across all the heavens and myriad worlds, searched for countless precious materials, and forged seven huge mountains!

Each of these seven enormous mountains was rank five grandmist treasures.

Combining together, it would be a chaos sacred treasure!

Furthermore, it was an extremely powerful chaos sacred treasure!

The Lord of Chaos was extremely powerful to begin with. Coupled with this chaos sacred treasure, he roamed the 33 Heavens unhindered with few rivals.

It was just that later on, no idea why, the Lord of Chaos vanished, and the whereabouts of the Myriad Realms Mountain became a mystery.

Mi Tian did not expect that one of them would actually land in Ye Yuan’s hands.

It was after a few twists and turns, the rank of the Heavenspan Mountain dropped again and again, becoming a heavenly spirit treasure that was less than trash.

How strong the Lord of Chaos was, Ye Yuan was simply unable to imagine.

To the current him, Saint Sovereign Heaven was already extremely powerful.

But without a doubt, the background of the Heavenspan Mountain was huge!

“If I can gather the seven giant mountains, wouldn’t I be able to possess a chaos sacred treasure?” Ye Yuan thought about it and was a little excited too.

“Huhu,?that’s easy for you to imagine! These seven giant mountains have probably long already scattered across the heavens and myriad realms. How much ability do you have to traverse the heavens and myriad realms? Furthermore, disregarding other things, just this mountain in your hands, who knows how much grandmist energy is needed to restore it to a rank five grandmist treasure! Just based on your current bit of strength, don’t even think about it!” Mi Tian gave him a blow.

However, Ye Yuan did not show signs of being discouraged and smiled instead as he said,?“Heh,?my luck has always been very good!”

… …

The two people pushed on with their journey round the clock. A normally over one month journey, they only used half a month and arrived.

Even Greenrock this Jade Sovereign Heaven was dead tired too.

However, luckily Ye Yuan brought Greenrock along. He encountered far too many obstacles on this journey.

Looking at Heavenly South City from afar, Ye Yuan was completely dumbfounded.

Outside of Heavenly South City was densely covered with a true spirit army, the numbers too many to enumerate!

Compared to Heavenly South City, Calm South City was simply not worth mentioning.

Terrific! These five guys probably moved the entire Myriad Demons Mountain over, right?

However, seeing that Heavenly South City was not breached yet, Ye Yuan calmed down slightly.

“Stop! Greenrock, aren’t you attacking Calm South City? Why did you come back?” Passing through the army, the two were stopped by a Jade Sovereign Heaven very soon.

Greenrock had a black face as he said, “Zuo Qing, he’s Heavenly South Pill Hall’s Third Hall Master. He has a matter to discuss and wants to meet the five kings!”

Zuo Qing gave Ye Yuan a glance and could not help laughing as he said, “A Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum wants to meet the five kings? Greenrock, you didn’t eat the wrong medicine, right?”

“Five great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens joining hands and can’t breach Heavenly South City too?” Ye Yuan did not get angry but asked curiously instead.

Logically speaking, five great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens plus this scale of an army, Heavenly South City’s city protecting grand array could not block for such a long time either.

After all, there wasn’t even a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven in Heavenly South City..
