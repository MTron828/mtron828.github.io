“Damn it! This boy’s spatial rule has already attained sublimity. What a fast speed!”

Zhao Ding, this middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, could only eat dust under Ye Yuan’s spatial rule too.

He could not make Ye Yuan stay by himself!

“Quickly run! Split up and run!” Zhao Ding shouted loudly, instantly spreading throughout the entire mountain pass gates.

The expressions of those Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses changed greatly when they heard it. How could they have time to hesitate, instantly fleeing in all directions.

Ye Yuan spread his divine sense and was able to capture the positions of all the powerhouses.

Boom!

Ye Yuan caught up to an upper Jade Sovereign Heaven with a lunge and blew him up with one punch!

“You bastard, this exalt will kill you!” Zhao Ding was raging. Catching up to Ye Yuan, it was one move.

But Ye Yuan did not have the intention of fighting with him at all. With a flash, he evaded him again.

Boom!

Ye Yuan slammed a punch out and the ground fissured.

A large swarm of Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum and Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum disciples were either instantly killed or injured.

Zhao Ding’s two eyes were blood-red, and he was in a thunderous rage!

Some of these disciples were killed or injured. He did not care.

But, with how Ye Yuan was slaughtering people, even if it was the Pill Alliance, they could not afford it if the number was too high too!

Failing to kill Ye Yuan incurred the General Alliance’s displeasure to begin with.

If Ye Yuan exterminated the sect this time, then he really would not be able to lift his head anymore.

But, he could not do anything about it.

He could not catch up to Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan made use of spatial rule. His speed was extremely fast!

Even if it was killing Jade Sovereign Heavens, it was merely a snap of his fingers too.

By the time Zhao Ding caught up, Ye Yuan had gone hunting down the others again.

This feeling of powerlessness nearly drove Zhao Ding crazy!

The other party was merely a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven!

“Huhu,?the Pill Alliance’s disciples are really weak! Back then, when you killed your way up to the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, did you have this kind of mentality too?” Ye Yuan’s mocking voice came from the air.

Boom!

Ye Yuan punched again, directly killing the half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven who was currently flying away.

With his half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven physical body combined with chaos true spirit bloodline, killing a same rank half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven was too easy.

In a short few hundred breaths, Ye Yuan slew five half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens, 20 over Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, and countless low-level martial artists!

The entire high-end combat power of the Martial Secure Branch was eradicated by one-third all at once!

Zhao Ding was at his heel howling away but could not do anything about Ye Yuan.

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! This exalt will definitely kill you today!” Zhao Ding roared.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard that and said, “Are Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses all as feeble as you? Roaring here and there, there are only those few words. Come on. Kill me!”

Right at this time, the void trembled.

Two figures burst out of the sky!

When Zhao Ding saw the arrivals, he could not help being wildly ecstatic and exclaimed, “Wu Xingrui, Lin Zhongwei, you guys came just in time, help me delay this punk, I’ll kill him!”

Right when Ye Yuan was suppressing the mountain protecting grand array with the Myriad Realms Mountain, Zhao Ding already asked all parties for help.

At this time, these two finally arrived first!

Wu Xingrui two people could not help being stunned when they saw the desolation all over the mountain and dead bodies everywhere.

Martial Secure Branch was wiped out by a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

One had to know that the Martial Secure Branch was one of the strongest branches among the 15 branches!

Zhao Ding was even a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven mighty expert.

Now, he actually failed to take down a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven!

However, seeing Ye Yuan’s astonishing speed, they understood very quickly.

“Okay, leave it to us!” Wu Xingrui two people exchanged a glance and immediately set off to intercept Ye Yuan.

Zhao Ding laughed loudly and said, “Boy, this time, I’ll see where you run to!”

One person could only follow behind Ye Yuan and eat dust.

But these three great Saint Sovereign Heavens could shrink the encirclement and reduce Ye Yuan’s escape routes.

Coupled with Zhao Ding’s powerful strength, surrounding and killing Ye Yuan was not impossible!

Reaching the level of Saint Sovereign Heaven, one comprehended heaven and earth Great Dao and shuttled through the void.

The usefulness of spatial rule became significantly diminished.

It was also that Ye Yuan’s spatial rule was extremely strong. If it was any other Jade Sovereign Heaven, Zhao Ding would have smacked them to death with one slap.

Seeing three great Saint Sovereign Heavens besieging, Ye Yuan did not panic.

He gave a cold laugh, his figure advancing instead of retreating and actually directly met with Lin Zhongwei!

Zhao Ding’s expression changed wildly, and he shouted, “He’s going to use an origin divinity attack! Be careful!”

Origin divinity attacks had a certain range limit.

Therefore, Ye Yuan got close to Lin Zhongwei precisely in order to directly one-shot him!

However, Ye Yuan also did not expect that the Pill Alliance’s foundation was so deep, to have actually cultivated origin divinity defense mystic arts in advance.

The origin divinity defense mystic art that Li Changsheng personally took out was not some common-ware. Otherwise, he would have long disseminated it.

Getting the warning, Lin Zhongwei’s expression changed wildly, and he immediately activated the mystic art.

“True Soul Explosion!” Ye Yuan roared angrily, origin divinity power bursting out.

Buzz!

Lin Zhongwei only felt his origin divinity burst, his entire person being stunned, standing there sluggishly.

But he did not die!

The origin divinity defense mystic art took effect!

“Damn it!” Ye Yuan cursed in a low voice, passing right through the forest from Lin Zhongwei’s direction.

Zhao Ding and Wu Xingrui were chasing him too closely. He had no way of acting.

He could kill Lin Zhongwei with one sword, but he would also have to die at the hands of Zhao Jian two people.

Middle Saint Sovereign Heaven was no joke!

Although Ye Yuan was currently powerful, he still had not reached the level of killing middle Saint Sovereign Heavens.

The gap between the realms was too big!

But he really did not expect that the Pill Alliance actually had such a powerful origin divinity defense mystic art.

One had to know, his origin divinity mystic art originated from the Divine Emergence!

Even if the other party had a physical body, he could still one-shot those in the same rank.

But Lin Zhongwei forcefully blocked it!

Ye Yuan was clear in his heart that this must be the sequela left behind from his battle with Yan Jadetrue back then.

This bunch of guys had likely all cultivated this secret technique.

However, it was also that there were three people encircling and suppressing him this time.

If there was only one person, it was not hard for him to kill the other party!

Although this defense mystic art was strong, his offensive mystic art was stronger!

Didn’t they see that Lin Zhongwei’s entire person was dazed after being bombarded?

“Hahaha,?consider yourselves lucky! I won’t be playing with you all anymore this time! However, you guys have to guard your homes well. I’ll come at any time!” Ye Yuan laughed loudly and left just like that.

Zhao Ding two people could not catch up in time at all.

If Ye Yuan wanted to kill people, they could naturally surround and kill.

But, if Ye Yuan wholeheartedly wanted to escape, they could not stop him at all!

Lin Zhongwei also finally regained his senses at this time, but his eyes were still blank.

“What … happened just now?”

Zhao Ding’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

Three Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, including a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven among them, besieged a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven and actually still let the other party run away!

“This guy’s origin divinity attack is so strong! Lin Zhongwei activated his defense, and he was actually still stunned by him! If fighting one-on-one, he’ll kill you guys as easily as flipping his hand over!” Zhao Ding said with a gloomy face.

Wu Xingrui felt lingering fear too and said with a nod, “This boy’s spatial rule is extremely strong, and his origin divinity attack is strange and unpredictable; really difficult to deal with!”

Zhao Ding looked at the wrecked mountain pass gates and felt a headache.

“This boy probably won’t give up just like that! You guys hurry back and set up defenses. I’ll report back to the General Alliance now!”
