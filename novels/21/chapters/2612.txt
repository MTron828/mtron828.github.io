Chapter 2618: I Really Don’t Know!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect was the central plains of the Five Light Heavenly Region and also the spiritual leader of the five great heavenly sects.

None other than because the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect produced Zhuo Bufan who was eminent above all others!

It was not long ago that the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect was infinitely glorious, suppressing the Rainclear Continent.

Although they had already declined now, they were still much stronger than the other four sects.

The Fire Peace Great Nation was one of the nine major great nations under the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s jurisdiction. Its status was extremely high.

“Brother Ye, the Pill Alliance has talented people lying in concealment. Is it really okay for you to do this? I heard that in the Pill Alliance, there is no lack of some powerhouses who’re capable of refining heavenly imperial pills! Even if none of them is your match in the same realm, but if they send grade three, or even grade four heavenly alchemists over, what will you do?”

“I’m afraid that they won’t come! Brother Luo, don’t worry. You just have to care about being a hired thug will do.”

“… …”

“Do it then!”

“… alright!”

Whoosh!

A ray of sword light flashed past, the Pill Verdant Establishment’s signboard was directly divided into two, falling to the ground with a clang.

This action immediately attracted a crowd of onlookers.

These two people were precisely the Ye Yuan and Luo Yunqing who came from afar.

This Pill Verdant Establishment in front of them was a branch that the Pill Alliance set up in the Fire Peace Great Nation, which specialized in selling heavenly pills.

With the support of the Pill Alliance, this Pill Verdant Establishment’s business was naturally doing incomparably well.

The Pill Alliance’s power and influence were like a golden signboard, especially within the five great heavenly sects’ sphere of influence, making all cultivators flock to it like ducks.

The Pill Alliance’s products were definitely top quality goods!

But the Pill Alliance’s heavenly pills were also extremely expensive.

The Pill Alliance’s heavenly pill business within the boundaries of the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect had practically all fallen into a stagnant state.

But they were still operating in the other four sects.

Feng Xuanyi had once attempted to come to the four great heavenly sects to purchase heavenly pills and heavenly medicines, but distant water could not quench present thirst.

It was also impossible for the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect to run to the four great heavenly sects to rob heavenly pills.

Eight years had already passed since Ye Yuan’s oath.

In these eight years, Ye Yuan had been in closed-seclusion all along, only leaving seclusion today. Bringing Luo Yunqing, he came to Fire Peace Great Nation.

During these eight years, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect virtually used the entire sect’s strength to support Ye Yuan to practice heavenly pills.

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was one of the five great heavenly sects at any rate. Even if the Pill Alliance boycotted them, it was also impossible that there was no inventory at all.

Moreover, what Ye Yuan needed to cultivate were just grade two heavenly medicines.

This Pill Verdant Establishment was an important stronghold of the Pill Alliance in the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect.

Furthermore, when Feng Xuanyi sent people to request for pills back then, the attitude of this Pill Verdant Establishment’s establishment lord, Feng Jing, was also the worst.

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s first stop was to come here.

“Who is this kid, to actually dare smash the Pill Verdant Establishment’s signboard? Did he eat a bear’s heart or a leopard’s gall?”

“Heh,?didn’t you make it out? This boy definitely came to smash the place!”

“This boy is crazy, right? Master Feng is from the Pill Alliance. His alchemy path strength is exceedingly formidable. Yet this boy actually dares to come and smash the place??Heh heh,?he’ll probably be unable to bear the consequences of failure!”

“Look at the attire he’s wearing. He should be the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciple, right? The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was boycotted by the Pill Alliance. Did he come to win back face?”

… …

Ye Yuan two people’s actions immediately caused a commotion.

They did not hide their tracks and wore the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s attire.

Ye Yuan wanted everyone to know that the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect had declared war on the Pill Alliance!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Seven to eight Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses dashed out of the Pill Verdant Establishment and surrounded Ye Yuan two people.

One of them said sternly, “To dare tear down the Pill Verdant Establishment’s signboard, courting death!”

Luo Yunqing was unmoved, the Jade Sovereign Heaven aura on his body suddenly blooming. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Get lost!”

The expressions of these Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses changed drastically, but they still refused to give in.

That Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum in front said in a solemn voice, “Your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect dare to cause trouble on the Pill Alliance’s territory? Could it be you think that by destroying the Pill Verdant Establishment, it can relieve the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s crisis? A fool’s talk!”

Although he was surprised at Luo Yunqing’s strength, he did not care.

Experts were plentiful like clouds in the Pill Alliance. Jade Sovereign Heavens were nothing!

Luo Yunqing said indifferently, “Today, our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect is declaring war on the Pill Alliance! Have Feng Jing come out!”

That person’s expression changed slightly and he said with a frown, “You’re the Jade Face Swordsman, Luo Yunqing, right? Didn’t hear that you become a grade four heavenly alchemist!”

Luo Yunqing’s fame spread far and wide, and he carried a sword on his back. It was clear at a glance.

It was just that the words of the person at the foremost implied sarcastically.

Luo Yunqing was indifferent. Pointing at Ye Yuan, he said coolly, “Not me, it’s him!”

The person in the foremost was stunned, then immediately snickered and said, “Him? A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum came to challenge Master Feng? Your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect probably has no one who can be used, right?”

Not just him, a wave of ridiculing voices immediately came over from the surrounding onlookers.

“Martial Secure Heavenly Sect actually sent a grade two heavenly alchemist to challenge the place? Is this trying to make people laugh their heads off?”

“Heh,?this guy probably doesn’t know Master Feng’s terror, right? Being able to hold down the fort in the nine great nations, Master Feng’s strength is among the top in the Pill Alliance too!”

“Tsk tsk,?looks like the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect is taking desperate measures after being cornered this time!

… …

And right at this time, a middle-aged man in white robes walked out slowly.

Seeing him, those onlookers greeted one after another.

“Paying respects to Master Feng!”

This person was Feng Jing. Clearly. His prestige in Fire Peace Great Nation was extremely high!

Feng Jing just waved his hand nonchalantly, and it was considered to have returned the greeting.

Very clearly, he was already used to this sort of acclamation.

Feng Jing’s gaze landed on Ye Yuan and he said coolly, “Does your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect have nobody you can use? To send someone like you to intentionally come and humiliate me?”

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “That’s right. It’s to come to humiliate you! Of course, you’re just the appetizer! Later, the nine great nations’ establishment lords will all be humiliated!”

Feng Jing chuckled and said, “What high-sounding sentiments!”

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and said coolly, “Whether or not it’s high-sounding sentiments, you’ll know in a while.”

Feng Jing smiled coldly and said, “Just the likes of you, this grade two heavenly alchemist, you’re also worthy of competing in alchemy against me?”

At this time, the sword intent on Luo Yunqing’s body rose with a loud bang and he said coolly, “If you don’t fight, die!”

Feng Jing’s expression changed slightly, and he said in a cold voice, “You dare to kill me?”

Luo Yunqing gave him an indifferent glance and said with a smile, “You can try!”

A threat! This was a blatant threat!

The surrounding onlookers all sucked in a cold breath. They had never seen before such an alchemy battle.

Luo Yunqing’s sword intent was akin to the piercing cold gale, wandering around Feng Jing.

Feng Jing was helpless and could only grit his teeth and said, “Fine, I’ll fight! Since you guys are wholeheartedly seeking humiliation, I’ll sweep away your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s face today!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Stop posturing! Choose the heavenly pill! You pick the heavenly pill, but I advise that you’d best pick a harder one. If it’s basic grade two heavenly pills, you’ll die very horribly.”

Feng Jing could not help choking, feeling an intense humiliation!

This punk really slapped the face when hitting people!

Except, your strength had best be worthy of this arrogance!

Feng Jing sneered and said, “Fine, then I’ll choose the Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill! Don’t tell me that you don’t know how to refine!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Your Pill Alliance really has quite a number of pill formulas. I really don’t know this heavenly pill.. So hand over the pill formula for me to take a look.”
