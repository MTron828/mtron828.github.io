Chapter 2355: The Final God of War Golden List Publication!

These roughly over 30 people still had blank faces when they returned to the city.

Clearly, they still had not recovered to their senses.

Just earlier, each one of them was still in a bloody battle.

But in a blink, they were transported back.

Especially Ye Yuan, Wan Zhen, and Zhang Lian three people, they were clearly somewhat at a loss on what to do at this time.

Just earlier, Ye Yuan was still narrowly escaping death under the pincer attacks of a large group of fierce beasts.

Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian were the same.

Wan Zhen’s gaze adjusted to the present very quickly and saw the Ye Yuan in the crowd.

He was just about to go over to greet when he was surrounded by a large group of people.

“Wan Zhen, how many god of war points do you have right now?” A powerhouse ranked 40 plus immediately moved closer to ask.

Wan Zhen was taken aback and said, “4.34 million, why?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces immediately revealed wild ecstasy.

“Hahaha, that despicable brat has completely no chance now! A gap of 510 thousand, it’s impossible for that punk to catch up!” That powerhouse said in great joy.

Wan Zhen frowned and said, “What gap of 510 thousand? What are you guys talking about?”

When he said so, there were immediately many people in the crowd who were filled with righteous indignation, especially Jiang Zhe.

“Wan Zhen, we really feel too unjust for you! There’s a punk who resorted to trickery, and he could actually attain 400 to 500 thousand god of war points in one year, forcefully climbing to second place from behind!”

“Yeah, lucky you stood firm and exerted your strength at the last moment, overwhelming him ruthlessly!”

“First place is first place. His strength indeed isn’t simply for show, to actually be able to obtain 190 thousand god of war points in a year!”

... ...

How clever was Wan Zhen? He discerned what the problem was from these people’s words very quickly.

“You guys are talking about Ye Yuan, right? He didn’t use trickery! Turns out that he’s already in second place? Indeed terrifying!” Wan Zhen also looked towards Ye Yuan in surprise again as he said.

Everyone was stunned, suddenly falling into silence.

Wan Zhen actually personally defended Ye Yuan!

This guy did not eat the wrong medicine, right?

“Didn’t use trickery? How is that possible? With your strength, you only got over 100 thousand god of war points every year. He’s far worse than you but actually got 400 to 500 thousand points in a year. This is too illogical!” Jiang Zhe said with a look of disbelief.

But Wan Zhen shook his head and said, “When Ye Yuan was fighting in the Myriad Beast Battle Plain, Zhang Lian and I saw it with our own eyes! He already comprehended time law. Laws of time and space being unleashed together, coupled with Sword Dao source and Formation Dao source, his strength is already not beneath mine! Furthermore, the power of his sword formation can deal with hundreds and thousands of fierce beasts at the same time. The efficiency of obtaining god of war points is far stronger than us! Even though 400 to 500 thousand in a year is a little exaggerated, he absolutely didn’t resort to trickery.”

At the same time, a hint of ridicule flashed across Zhang Lian’s beautiful face, and he said disdainfully, “You can’t imagine it, doesn’t mean that others can’t do it! If not for Ye Yuan’s encouragement, the two of us also wouldn’t have hunted fierce beasts without heed for our lives. Of course, we also wouldn’t have obtained tremendous benefits.”

Ever since seeing Ye Yuan’s battle, the two of them started a crazy hunting mode.

Although it was impossible to be like Ye Yuan, they frequently pushed themselves to their limits, narrowly escaping death several times.

In these ten years, the two of them similarly made great progress.

With motivation and without motivation, those were two totally different states! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The over ten thousand people in the square were shocked by these two people’s words until they were staring dumbfoundedly.

Firstly, Ye Yuan really comprehended time law!

Secondly, Ye Yuan’s 400 to 500 thousand god of war points every year, that was actually really obtained by him hunting fierce beasts himself!

Thirdly, his strength could actually rival Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian already!

This news was too soul-stirring.

In these ten years, they had always judged based on the numbers. It was far less shocking than Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian personally explaining it.

It turned out that Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian suddenly erupting was really because of Ye Yuan!

All of this was simply like a dream.

How could there be such a monstrous person in this world?

Ten years!

Ye Yuan used ten years’ time and instantly obliterated their 1000 years of hard work!

They were all unpredictable children, existences that even heaven was jealous of.

But, if they were existences that even heaven was jealous of, then what ... was Ye Yuan?

When they were mocking Ye Yuan for comprehending time law, when they were questioning that Ye Yuan resorted to trickery, when they were mocking Ye Yuan for overestimating his own ability; Heaven was watching them and laughing!

Not that Ye Yuan was overestimating his own ability, he really had the talent to comprehend time law!

Wan Zhen could not be bothered to care about everyone’s shock. Dividing the crowd, he came before Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Younger Brother Ye is truly an unrivaled talent. You don’t know how shocked the two of us were when we saw you execute time law on that day!”

Time law was known as the number one law in the world!

Although it was on par with spatial law, the difficulty of comprehension was several times harder than spatial law.

Even a peerless genius like Wan Zhen was unable to comprehend it too.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That day, I sensed the two of you fellow daoists. But at that time, it was trapped in a heavy encirclement and was too busy to say hello. I hope that Fellow Daoist doesn’t blame.”

Ye Yuan’s impression of Wan Zhen was pretty good.

This was someone capable of shouldering great responsibility!

Wan Zhen shook his head and laughed in spite of himself and said, “What’s Younger Brother Ye saying? I won’t ask about your god of war points either. Let’s await the release of the God of War Golden List together then!”

Ye Yuan smiled as he nodded his head. Right then, there was a tremor in the void, a volume of pages flew out for the last time.

Everyone’s breathing became ragged.

“Impossible! Impossible! Even if these god of war points were derived from his true strength, it’s also impossible for him to obtain 510 thousand god of war points with his ranking!” Jiang Zhe cried out frantically in his heart.

Judging from Ye Yuan’s situation in previous years, it was impossible for him to surpass 500 thousand.

The pages slowly unfurled, affecting the hearts of each unpredictable children.

Very soon, the pages revealed the tip of the iceberg.

A huge golden name appeared in front of everyone.

Buzz!

There was immediately a burst of exclamation in the square.

“First place, Ye Yuan!”

“Surpassed! He really surpassed Wan Zhen!”

“Too inconceivable! In this last year, he actually obtained 540 thousand god of war points! How ... How did he do it?”

“Too crazy! Too shocking! Ten years, he only used ten years. He then reached the top of the God of War Golden List!”

... ...

A nuke seemed to have detonated in the square. Everyone exploded.

The first name that appeared on the page was precisely Ye Yuan’s!

In the last year, Ye Yuan miraculously gained 540 thousand god of war points, and finally reached a horrifying 4.37 million, suppressing the Wan Zhen who had maintained first place for a thousand years with the edge of 30 thousand points.

The shock that this scene brought to everyone was seriously too strong.

Jiang Zhe looked at the name on the page, feeling battered out of his senses as he muttered under his breath, “How is this possible? How is this possible? Without cheating, how can he possibly get 540 thousand god of war points in a year?”
