Chapter 2511: Farewell

Boom!

Finally, the eight statues could not withstand the berserk sword energy anymore and directly exploded, shattering into countless pieces.

That Eight Extreme Divinities’ wisp of origin divinity also shattered along with the statues, turning into nothingness!

Golden rays of light suddenly appeared in the void.

Like, the void was shattering.

Finally, that region of void directly shattered apart.

Countless white light dots gushed out

These light dots scattered elegantly as if looking for something.

A portion of the light dots drifted and entered the bodies of the divine race powerhouses.

The eyes of those divine race powerhouses gradually became confused.

There seemed to be too much confusion!

“Just now … what an intriguing feeling! Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, is it?” Ye Yuan looked above the sky, seemingly recollecting the aftertaste of something.

Just now, his offensive power layered on top of each other under the catalyzing of the sword formation, reaching an inconceivable realm.

That kind of realm was what Ye Yuan had never imagined before!

Ye Yuan immersed in it in intoxication!

However, just as he was about to cross over to that realm, there seemed to be an invisible wall blocking him outside.

Ye Yuan knew that was the realm gap!

He had not broken the shackles yet!

Perhaps, that was the limit of the Heavenspan World!

“Wonder how one can become a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse?! Maybe the one behind him knows the answer?”

Leaving that wonderful state, Ye Yuan’s eyes became confused.

He had been constantly fumbling about how to break the shackles.

But this step was like it was a short distance away, but far away in the horizon, making him feel like he had no way of getting started.

This feeling was the same as the scenery when he reached grand completion Origin Deity.

It was just that now, it was harder than back then!

What he wanted to break was the shackle that no one in the Heavenspan World had broken for countless billions of years!

How difficult was this step?

At this time, a streak of white light merged into the World Suppressing Stele’s space, entering Yue Mengli’s divine soul.

Ye Yuan’s thoughts stirred and he let Yue Mengli out.

“Big Brother Yuan, I’m … sorry! I … I couldn’t control myself!” Yue Mengli said tearfully.

She knew how much damage her actions and behavior these few years brought to Ye Yuan.

Self-reproach, guilt, all kinds of emotions welled up in her heart, making her heart ache endlessly.

She was not feeling sorry for herself, she was feeling sorry for Ye Yuan.

Only she knew how much pressure Ye Yuan had endured over the years.

Ye Yuan took her gently into his arms and said calmly, “Silly girl, it wasn’t your fault either, apologize for what? The main culprit is already dead, you don’t need to blame yourself.”

Li-er nodded her head slightly, but tears still could not stop flowing.

“Big Brother Yuan, Elder Sister Lingxue she …”

Ye Yuan sighed slightly, shook his head, and said nothing.

Li-er’s expression dimmed and she bit her lips lightly and said, “Why! Why is heaven so unfair! Elder Sister Lingxue is so nice, by heaven made her endure such suffering?”

She was indignant, she was unwilling, she … felt sorry for Ye Yuan!

Accompanying Ye Yuan along the way, no one understood Mu Lingxue’s position in his heart more than her.

Regarding Ye Yuan walking out of the Immortal Grove World, from an ant to Heavenspan’s sovereign currently, it was all in order to be able to save Mu Lingxue.

But he failed!

The current Ye Yuan was very calm, but she knew how painful Ye Yuan’s heart was.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was deep, looking deep into the blue sky, and he said firmly, “It’s fine. The Heavenspan World can’t save Lingxue. Then I’ll go beyond the heavens! Even if I smash the nine heavens and ten earths, I’ll also let Lingxue recover!”

Yue Mengli’s entire body trembled and she said, “T-There’s really a world beyond heaven?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “The Heavenspan World is a caged world, everything is under the control of the powerhouses beyond heaven! Eight Extreme Divinities, Doomsday Battle, fight for Dao Ancestor, it was merely just other people’s games! In their eyes, we’re just ants.”

Yue Mengli’s heart shook, her eyes seemingly full of disbelief.

All of a sudden, Tian Qing bellowed, “Impossible! Absolutely impossible! You’re lying! Our divine race is the race favored by heaven. It’s the supreme race! How is there beyond the heavens in this world? If there is, why has no one ever broken the shackles? You’re lying!”

He could not accept this fact in front of him and also did not want to accept this fact.

Being enslaved for billions of years and suddenly waking up, he would rather be immersed in the past too.

Because he knew in the deepest corner of his heart that reality was too cruel.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Whether I’m lying or not, you’re clear of the truth, aren’t you? Of course, I don’t need to explain anything either. Because very soon, you’ll know that you have to face some things! Li-er, let’s go.”

Yue Mengli nodded slightly and followed Ye Yuan and left.

Watching the two people’s departing back view, Tian Qing’s fingers were almost crushed by himself.

“L-Lord Tian Qing, w-what on earth are we?” Beside Tian Qing, Originsmile said with a blank face.

Finally, Tian Qing loosened his fist and said with a bitter smile, “What he said was right. We’re … just a bunch of pitiful people, that’s all! I finally understand now, why he would let the divine race off!”

… …

Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, in the great hall, Yue Mengli, Wan Zhen, Lu-er, Fiery, Wan Zhen, Pang Zhen, Profound Secrets, and the rest, everyone was shockingly present.

Everyone’s faces carried thick solemness.

Ye Yuan’s expression was calm, without joy nor sorrow as he said coolly, “Everyone, please forgive this Ye’s selfishness. The disaster was caused by me alone, it should naturally also be borne by me alone! It’s just that after I go, it will likely bode ill rather than well. Everyone, take care!”

“What’s Your Excellency saying? This isn’t your matter alone, this is the matter of all the martial artists in the Heavenspan World! Wan Zhen is willing to follow Your Excellency to the death!” Wan Zhen said in a deep voice. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Your Excellency, Pang Zhen is also a Dao Ancestor now! I can help out a bit no matter what! If Your Excellency is fighting against a powerful enemy, how can I, Pang Zhen, be missing?”

Pang Zhen already became Dao Ancestor Lightning, he was naturally unwilling to hole up at home.

Among those present were several Dao Ancestors, plus Ye Yuan, this sovereign.

This was the Heavenspan World’s strongest combat force already.

Everyone was not willing to yield to others and insisted on following Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “You all don’t know what kind of existence you’re facing! My strongest attack will likely be unable to even shake him in the least bit! If you all go, it’s just to deliver yourselves to death!”

Everyone trembled all over, all feeling incredulous.

How strong Ye Yuan’s strongest attack was, nobody knew.

They only knew that it was very, very strong!

Because no one could measure it!

Ye Yuan’s sword was already the Heavenspan World’s strongest!

His full-strength attack was actually unable to even shake the other party in the least bit. Then how strong was the other party’s strength?

“The Chaos Heavenspan Canon and inheritance grand arrays, I’ve already left them in the Immortal Grove World. Some things must be done by someone! If I’m defeated, I also don’t hope for the Heavenspan World to be caged by people forever. In the future, if a fated individual can reach my realm, they will naturally have a chance to break the shackles and break this sky! This matter, I don’t feel at ease handing it over to others, better that you guys go and do!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Big Brother Yuan, go then, I’ll wait here for you!” Yue Mengli said with a calm expression.

But her eyes revealed determination.

Ye Yuan just smiled and nodded, and did not say much.

He understood Li-er’s feelings. If he died, Li-er absolutely would not live on by herself.
