Chapter 1315: A Rat Crossing the Street

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Su Linpu let out a long sigh and said, “Sigh, poor girl. Hong Yin, bring Miss Wanru back and let her rest well!”

For Liang Wanru’s disposition, being able to force her to this step was truly not easy.

Even back then, when Liang Wanrong did that sort of dirty thing, she chose to forgive too.

But Liang Mingyu’s indifference this time truly made Liang Wanru lose all hope.

She finally discovered that this Liang Family seemed to already completely did not have room for her to survival anymore.

Looking at Liang Wanru’s frail appearance, the pity in everyone’s hearts arose spontaneously.

Her experiences these few years, quite a number of people all heard of it.

Wang Pianran suddenly felt that there were a series of unfriendly gazes coming from all around, the scenery suddenly changing.

That was the furious gaze after being deceived and made use of!

Originally, this version of things was seamless. But the prerequisite was that Liang Wanru was already dead. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Now, the main person herself came forward to clarify and even wanted to make a clean break from the Liang Family.

How the truth was already did not need to go into detail.

“You ... What do you all want to do? My ... My brother is Wang Lingbo!” Wang Pianran shouted at the top of her voice.

“Pooh! Is the Wang Family impressive?”

A thick phlegm passed through the crowd and spat onto Wang Pianran’s face accurately.

Immediately, a stinky smell burrowed into her nostrils, making her choke from disgust.

But before waiting for her to react yet, one mouthful after another of thick phlegm spat over towards her akin to raindrops.

“Spit! Scram!”

“Spit! Quickly get lost!”

“Spit! Don’t make a spectacle of yourself here anymore! Get lost!”

...

Cursing sounded out, spit splattering everywhere. Wang Pianran was instantly drowned out by this raindrop like thick phlegms, waves of stench emanating off her body.

That appearance was disgusting to the extreme.

When those people who were fooled came to realize the truth, that wrath was very terrifying.

These people were all expected. Spitting was naturally bullseye every time. Wang Pianran had no place to dodge even if she wanted to.

“Ah, ah, ah!! Disgusting to death! You ... You all are dead for sure! I’ll have my brother kill all of you pariahs! Every one of you! Ahh, hack ...”

Wang Pianran was currently shouting herself hoarse threatening others when a thick phlegm directly flew into her mouth.

She could not take it anymore and started vomiting loudly.

“Hahaha ...” Everyone laughed loudly.

Wang Pianran’s threat had no effect at all. As the saying went, the law did not blame the masses. Even though the Wang Family was powerful, they did not dare to kill so many people either.

Wang Pianran at this time was akin to a rat crossing the street, everyone shouting to beat it.

Even though the onlookers did not dare to kill her, currently like this, it was already enough for her to suffer.

In fact, it was even more liberating than killing her.

Such a venomous woman should be humiliated like this!

Wang Pianran puked as she was escorted by a group of underlings away from the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Su Linpu had flowers bloom with joy in his heart long ago. Only seeing Wang Pianran leave, did he say in the clear voice, “Now, everyone knows that my Myriad Treasure Tower isn’t joking around with everybody, right? In the future, if someone is poisoned, you can come to the Myriad Treasure Tower. Everybody, rest assured. I guarantee that the medicines work like a charm!”

Su Linpu’s words were a stone that stirred up a thousand ripples.

What he said was not Poisonfeather Thousand Night, but that as long as someone was poisoned, they could come to find the Myriad Treasure Tower.

These words were said rather conceitedly!

“Manager Su, you’re saying that ... no matter what poison, you all can resolve it?” Someone asked with skepticism.

Su Linpu smiled and said, “Of course not! How many poisons are there in this world? How can it be all cured? But in this Jewelhill City, if even our Myriad Treasure Tower can’t cure it, then nobody can cure it!”

These words were said domineeringly!

But the Myriad Treasure Tower after having Ye Yuan was this domineering!

If without Ye Yuan’s inciting things, Su Linpu naturally did not dare to say this kind of big talk.

Even the Poisonfeather Thousand Night was cured, what poison was there that the divine-grade Detoxification Pill could not treat?

Everyone clearly all realized this point. The Myriad Treasure Tower resolved Jewelhill City’s number one poison, they naturally had the confidence to say this kind of words.

“Manager Su, could it be that that new guest alchemist of yours refined a divine-grade Detoxification Pill?” Someone asked again.

Su Linpu said with a smile, “Speaking of this guest alchemist of ours, Ye Yuan, he’s incredible! Presumably, everyone knows that because his divine sea is damaged, he’s unable to condense divine essence. Hence, his medicinal pills were all refined and formed with Formation Dao!”

“What?! Formation Dao Pill Refinement! It’s actually Formation Dao Pill Refinement!”

“Just what is the origin of this guest alchemist? To actually know Formation Dao Pill Refinement!”

“Manager Su is evading the subject, looks like the Myriad Treasure Tower really refined a divine-grade Detoxification Pill!”

...

Su Linpu saying this immediately caused a hubbub.

Everyone was already shocked until it could not be surpassed.

No matter whether it was the divine-grade Detoxification Pill or Formation Dao Pill Refinement, these were all things that were fantastical in Jewelhill City.

It was precisely because so that everyone all thought that Liang Wanru died.

However, these inconceivable things had indeed happened before everyone’s eyes.

Seeing this scene, Su Linpu smiled until his eyes narrowed.

With this, Ye Yuan’s fame was considered utterly spread out in Jewelhill City.

In the future, not only would the Myriad Treasure Tower’s fame overshadow the other few families, the martial artists seeking Ye Yuan for pills would definitely be more as well.

...

In the teahouse, Lu Jinghao and Lin Zaitian slowly sat down. Until now, they still had not recovered.

When Liang Wanru appeared, the two of them were virtually shocked until they stood up at the same time.

The Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s poison being cured, this was absolutely an earth-shaking major matter in Jewelhill City.

A major event sufficient to change the current Jewelhill City’s status quo!

Using one’s butt to think and one would also know, starting from today, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s business would probably be explosive. The Lu Family and Lin Family’s power would definitely be affected.

However, the one with the biggest impact was still the Wang Family!

“Old Lu, I seriously can’t figure out where Yang Rui went to find such a freak!” Lin Zaitian drank a mouthful of tea and said with a bitter smile.

Lu Jinghao similarly smiled bitterly and said, “This new guest alchemist of the Myriad Treasure Tower is very mysterious, but I didn’t expect that his strength was actually so formidable! With him around, our two families’ days in the future will have a hard time.”

“Yeah! Alchemists able to refine divine-grade Detoxification Pill, we can’t find a second one in the entire Jewelhill City too! However, the one with the biggest headache is still Wang Lingbo. Today’s matter will probably be a bolt out of the blue to him, right?” Lin Zaitian said smilingly.

“Heh, he was digging a pit to bury himself! Causing a disturbance for over a month, it was actually such an outcome!” Lu Jinghao said rather gloatingly.

...

Toward the events that happened in the outside world, Ye Yuan was completely oblivious.

To him, every minute and second was precious.

Refining a divine-grade Divine Essence Pill and divine-grade Detoxification Pill was indeed impressive, but these two kinds of medicinal pills were merely just medicinal pills to build the foundation.

One-star Heavenly Mark Pill was a thousand times, ten thousand times harder than these two kinds of medicinal pills!

Even if Ye Yuan used a very short time to refine these two kinds of medicinal pills, 10 year’s time was still a bit of a stretch.

Ye Yuan fell into a frenzied studying and practicing. Vast knowledge of spirit medicines’ medicinal properties practically stuffed his brain full.

Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and desperately forced himself to digest again and again!
