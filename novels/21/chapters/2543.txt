Chapter 2549: Master Ye, Time for You to Perform!

For ordinary grade one heavenly alchemists, no matter how skilled, they could only refine upper third grade quality too.

Those who could reach fourth grade were all heaven-grade powerhouses. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

But the moment Lin Lan took action, it was upper fifth grade. It could be seen how profound his skill level was!

It was not that fifth grade was two grades higher than third grade; the quality would increase by less than twice.

The higher the quality, the harder it was to achieve.

Third grade to fourth grade was several times the gap.

Fourth grade to fifth grade was another gap of several times!

This kind of disparity was magnified exponentially.

Fifth grade compared to ordinary third grade, the medicinal effect was at least more than ten times stronger!

Further up, it was virtually impossible for a grade two heavenly alchemist to want to reach sixth grade.

Of course, this was also the most basic Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

If it were other heavenly pills, it would have been impossible for him to reach this level.

“Master Ye, can this Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill still enter your arcane sights?” Lin Lan joked.

Upper fifth grade was an exceptional performance for him as well.

He was already very sure in his heart that he would win.

If upper fifth grade could not even beat a one point affinity fellow, he could find a piece of tofu to go and commit suicide.

Therefore, he was very relaxed right now.

However, Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s just like that, barely passable. However, you’re indeed much stronger than Gu Mao that fellow.”

Ye Yuan’s visual prowess was not what these heavenly alchemists present could compare to.

Lin Lan’s pill refinement was like floating clouds and flowing water – natural and smooth; accomplished in one go.

Just controlling the fire shook Gu Mao off by ten streets behind!

Therefore, the two were not on the same level at all.

Of course, Ye Yuan’s fire control shook Gu Mao off by more than 100 streets.

Lin Lan was similarly not on the same level as Ye Yuan.

But the crowd was extremely indignant.

“This guy is really cocky to the extreme! Still posturing until now!”

“Nation Teacher is good-tempered. Otherwise, he would have long wrecked him to death!”

“Upper fifth grade is still passable!?Huhu,?he really is not afraid of spraining his tongue when talking!”

… …

Lin Lan’s face turned black, and he almost spewed out a mouthful of blood.

This guy actually compared him to Gu Mao that trash!

One was a grade one heavenly alchemist, while the other was grade two. There was no comparison, alright?

“Is that so? Then Master Ye, it’s time for you to perform!” Lin Lan said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Alright, you learn by the side. It might help you to break through your current bottleneck. As for today’s matter, just take it as you paid tuition fees! Just because you can’t do some things, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it. So what if one point affinity? To me, Ye Yuan, affinity is nothing at all!”

As Ye Yuan said, he slowly walked in front of the pill furnace.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Posturing!

Too capable at posturing!

This guy was nuts, to actually have Nation Teacher learn by the side!

A rookie who could only refine Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill actually made a grade two heavenly alchemist learn something!

Even said that affinity was nothing!

Where did your freaking courage come from?

Lin Lan was shocked too, he had never seen before a junior who could posture so much.

This was crazy!

But just as everyone was shocked, Ye Yuan made his move.

Swoosh!

The Dragonbone Grass flew right into Ye Yuan’s hand. Ye Yuan controlled the Dao fire and started extracting.

The pale blue Dao fire flickered and jumped. At times, it was like a dragon prancing the nine heavens, at other times, it was like a fish swimming in shallow waters.

All in all, that cluster of flame seemed to have life.

The vast majority of the people present had never seen Ye Yuan refine the Dragonbone Grass before.

Upon seeing at this moment, it was immediately overwhelmingly shocking!

This fire control was too amazing!

Ye Yuan’s current refinement was god knows how many times stronger than when he bet with Gu Mao back then!

The faint smile of a victor had been hanging on Lin Lan’s face all along.

But at this time, this confidence had already disappeared completely.

What replaced it was shock!

A shock that was incapable of further increase!

He had never thought that someone could control fire to such an extent!

Furthermore, the Dragonbone Grass was currently becoming purer and purer under Ye Yuan’s refinement.

When the Dragonbone Grass was finished refining, Lin Lan already had a score in his heart.

The Dragonbone Grass that Ye Yuan refined was significantly stronger than his!

One stalk after another of heavenly medicine, Ye Yuan’s extraction was mastered to perfection, it was simply the style of a master.

In contrast, Lin Lan’s air of a master was not even fit to carry Ye Yuan’s shoes!

In the path of alchemy, Ye Yuan was the eternal king.

Even if he did not have much affinity, no one could overpower him in alchemy too.

Not that he was invincible, but that it was his formidable strength and bearing that exudes from inside out!

This kind of self-confidence based on powerful strength was something that no one could replace.

Affinity was the greatest obstacle stopping Ye Yuan from refining heavenly pills.

But in other aspects, Ye Yuan’s strength was completely not what Lin Lan could compare to.

That kind of might that had gone through endless tempering simply had no weakness to exploit!

After finished refining the heavenly medicines, the most crucial moment came!

Refining the heavenly pill!

Whether it was a mule or a horse, it was time to see the truth.

All of the heavenly medicines gathered in the pill furnace, the pressure on Ye Yuan suddenly increased.

Even now, affinity this hurdle still added tremendous pressure on him when he was refining pills.

That feeling was like Ye Yuan was rushing forward at full speed, but there were eight horses pulling him in the opposite direction.

The feeling of restraint was too obvious.

The sweat on Ye Yuan’s head grew more and more, and his expression became more and more serious.

Clearly, he was very taxed.

When Lin Lan saw this scene, he was immediately much more at ease.

He could feel that Ye Yuan’s affinity absolutely did not exceed three points.

This showed that the one point affinity was not a groundless rumor.

Ye Yuan really did not have affinity!

Looking at Ye Yuan’s expression again, one would know that it was enough to choke him.

“Huhu,?I thought he could really defy the heavens. After a long time, it was a false alarm.” Lin Lan said with a cold laugh.

The others also let out long sighs of relief.

Everyone was deceived by Ye Yuan’s grandmaster air previously.

“Freaking hell, scared me to death! I even thought that he could really refine a heavenly pill!”

“This guy really scares people to death without paying for it!”

“But, apart from that his affinity is only one point, his other areas are really strong!?Sigh,?what a pity!”

… …

Now, everyone’s attitude was a little better.

After all, Ye Yuan indeed had the capital to posture.

Just in terms of fire control and extraction, Ye Yuan had even surpassed Nation Teacher Lin Lan already.

This was sufficient to be proud.

However, without being able to refine a heavenly pill, everything was in vain.

He would not be able to clear this hurdle today!

Therefore, many people were also lamenting endlessly.

Such a genius, it was indeed a pity.

Along with the passing of time, Ye Yuan’s performance became more and more strained, and his breathing also became more and more labored.

However, the movements of his hands were not disorderly at all.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan flipped his palm over. The Dao fire extinguished with a loud bang.

Pah!

Pah!

Pah!

Lin Lan’s applause came from the side.

“Master Ye has worked hard. Have to admit, you really scared this nation teacher! However, forget about refining heavenly pills. With your pitiful bit of affinity, it’s impossible to refine a complete heavenly pill, much less surpass this nation teacher!” Lin Lan said with a snicker.

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and flipped his palm over again, and the pill furnace opened.

A thick medicinal scent struck the nose.

A medicinal pill flew out of the pill furnace slowly and landed in the dish.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Lan and said with a sneer, “Who said that you can’t refine heavenly pills without affinity?”
