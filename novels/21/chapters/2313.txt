Chapter 2317: Explosive Situation!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The short old man opened both eyes and kept sizing Ye Yuan up as if wanting to see through him.

“Haha, how many years has it been? It’s still this old man’s first time seeing you, this fellow, open your eyes. Looks like you, this old thing, really got scared,” Sacred Ancestor High Priest said with a loud laugh.

Medicine Ancestor did not have overly strong emotion fluctuations. He just kept looking at Ye Yuan.

After a long time, Medicine Ancestor suddenly laughed loudly and said, “This game had let this ancestor find someone of the same Dao! Why not call this game ‘Toward Dao,’ how about it?”

Everyone nodded their heads one after another, deeply feeling that way too.

Second Sage was too terrifying!

After this battle, Ye Yuan shall stand at the summit of the alchemy path along with Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest, and pursue that fleeting and ephemeral Dao pill.

In this battle, Ye Yuan counterattacked and lost slightly to Medicine Ancestor with a difference of half a point. He shall become a myth of the alchemy path and shock the world!

Someone of the same Dao, it was well-deserved!

“Toward Dao? Huhu, rather fitting, but ... do you really know what Dao is?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Medicine Ancestor’s laughter abruptly ceased, and he said with a frown, “What do you mean by this?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You understand.”

Surprise finally showed on Medicine Ancestor’s eternally unchanging face at this time.

“You ... You touched the power of law. This is impossible!” Medicine Ancestor said.

“Whether I touched the power of law or not, I’m not clear, but I definitely saw something that you didn’t see. Someone of the same Dao? Perhaps ... you’re not worthy.”

When these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar.

In this world, how many people wanted to be associated with the Medicine Ancestor but could not?

But Ye Yuan said that Medicine Ancestor was not worthy of being associated with him.

This sentence was too shocking.

Was it Ye Yuan being arrogant? Or did he really see something different?

It was not just Medicine Ancestor. Sacred Ancestor High Priest and the various ancestors, each person’s face revealed an extremely solemn expression.

Where Dao was at, was where the heart yearned.

The people present, as long as they reached the realm of an old ancestor, who did not want to comprehend the true Dao pill?

It was just a pity that this step was far too difficult. Even Medicine Ancestor this kind of amazing talent expended a trillion years and was also unable to reach this step.

But this young man in front of him said that he saw this step, how could it not surprise people?

Medicine Ancestor’s two eyes narrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Boy, you want to confuse my Dao heart?”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Believing or not is up to you. It’s just that I’m not worthy of same Dao these two words. Senior Sacred Ancestor, let’s go.”

The few people were just about to leave when Medicine Ancestor’s figure shook, and he already blocked in front of them.

“Not explaining this matter clearly, nobody can think about leaving,” Medicine Ancestor said in a solemn voice.

The allure of Dao was too strong. Even Medicine Ancestor, this level of existence, was unable to resist this temptation too.

It was still alright if Ye Yuan did not speak. With him saying it, it immediately whetted everyone’s gluttonous bugs. Especially Medicine Ancestor this kind of existence, how could he easily let him leave?

Sacred Ancestor High Priest smiled contemptuously and said, “Old thing, I’m not as good as you in Alchemy Dao, but in Martial Dao, this emperor isn’t afraid of you! If you want this Cloudheart Realm to fall apart to pieces, feel free to make a move!”

In Martial Dao, Sacred Ancestor High Priest and Medicine Ancestor were both Deva Fourth Blight powerhouses, their strength utterly formidable.

Once this level of powerhouse made a move, how could Cloudheart Realm withstand it?

Medicine Ancestor’s face fell and said, “If Cloudheart Realm is gone, then it’s gone. Can’t this ancestor build another one? Today, this kid must stay!”

For a moment, it became dangerously explosive.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s brows furrowed slightly. It seemed like Medicine Ancestor this fellow was really going all out.

Right at this time, a few large openings suddenly fissured open above the void.

Countless figures poured out of the large mouth.

Accurately speaking, they were not humanoid figures, but a dense swath of ferocious-looking monsters.

In front of those monsters were a group of powerhouses that were identical to humans.

It was just that the aura emitting from their bodies was very different from humans.

Ye Yuan’s whole body shuddered fiercely, looking at those figures above the void in shock.

He was all too familiar with these guys.

Divine race and abyss monsters!

The divine race came into being so quickly?

“How did they come into being so quickly? Furthermore, they were suppressed in the Abyss World by several great sovereign demons, why would they appear in the Heavenspan World without a sound?” Ye Yuan said in shock.

The divine race and abyss monsters appearing here were seriously too surprising.

Right now, Cloudheart Realm was already completely surrounded. All of the alchemy path powerhouses became turtles in a jar. This was not a good sign.

The one in the lead was a man with yellow hair.

The man stood with his hands behind his back, with a kind of haughtiness that showed disdain upon the world.

He did not deliberately release his pressure, but Ye Yuan felt the exact same aura as Daymeld from him.

This person was a progenitor-level powerhouse!

Ye Yuan’s mind revolved like lightning. With the divine race coming here, they had likely planned for a long time.

“Huhu, everyone’s here, how lively!” The man with yellow hair stood in the air as he said with a light laugh.

It was just that the words were full of contempt.

Medicine Ancestor’s brows furrowed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “Who are you fellow guests? To dare be impudent in my Cloudheart Realm, are you tired of living?”

Medicine Ancestor felt an extremely strong threat from the yellow-haired man’s body.

Therefore, he did not make a move right away to kill the enemy but gave a warning.

Clearly, Medicine Ancestor was also not clear about the divine race’s origin.

The yellow-haired man did not care about Medicine Ancestor’s warning at all but looked toward the Ye Yuan in the crowd.

All of Ye Yuan’s hair stood on its end, his entire person about to suffocate.

This glance was too terrifying!

“Kid, you tell them who this ancestor is,” the yellow-haired man said calmly1.

Everyone looked towards Ye Yuan, uncertain what it meant.

Someone immediately asked, “Second Sage, you know where these reckless and blind guys are from?”

Ye Yuan did not answer, he just looked at the yellow-haired man and said in a solemn voice, “Which lineage are you from?”

The yellow-haired man laughed lightly and said, “This ancestor is the Profound Lineage’s third ancestor, Originguard. Kid, you’re very good, you could forcefully beat Nineorigin that kid down a boundary at the realm of Empyrean, impressive! This ancestor will only ask once. Are you willing to submit to my divine race?”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted. This yellow-haired man was actually a Profound Lineage’s ancestor!

This Profound Lineage actually appeared in the Heavenspan World without a sound, how could he not be shocked?

It was just that what he felt even more was fury.

It was precisely the Profound Lineage that forcefully separated him and Yue Mengli!

Rumble!

A monstrous rage rose from Ye Yuan’s body.

His two eyes were practically wanted to spew fire as he said with a sneer, “Submit? Just the likes of your trash races? Heh heh, divine race ... I really don’t know how you guys have the face to call yourselves this name! Hand Li-er over, otherwise, I’ll trample your divine race one day!”

Originguard did not get angry and said with a faint smile, “Divine Daughter is extraordinarily gifted. When she stands before you again, you’ll get a big surprise!”

“Just what was going on here?”

“What are they talking about? What divine race, what Divine Daughter, completely never heard before!”

“Being long-winded with them for what? A bunch of guys playing tricks, just directly finish them off!”

They completely did not know about the divine race’s strength, each and every one ignorant and fearless, and were about to rush over.
