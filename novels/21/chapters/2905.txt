Chapter 2911: Carrying Out Legacy Teachings

This Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven’s situation was somewhat different from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

There were only two continents here, but no matter which continent, the soul race was the well-deserved overlord!

The soul race had many Hegemons who kept suppressing the blood race.

Looking across the 33 Heavens, the human race’s Hegemon Realms were the most.

But here, the human race was weak.

Therefore, in each great battle, these two major races would drive the human race out to be the vanguard, attacking each other.

The humans were the biggest cannon fodders.

Sublime Pill Sect was originally an Emperor Sakra Heaven level major sect. Although they could not enter the sights of a Hegemon level sect, it was quite powerful too.

But, these few thousand years, they suffered the conscription of the soul race repeatedly, large batches of powerhouses died at the front-lines.

Presently, there was only Wang Jun, being the only powerhouse left.

They were paying homage to Cloudmount here, just praying that the soul race could completely forget about them and stop drafting them.

If there was another draft, the Sublime Pill Sect would probably be in danger of being annihilated.

Talking up until this point, Wang Jun, this Emperor Realm powerhouse, was also filled with tears.

When Ye Yuan heard it, he also sighed endlessly. Concerning the blood race running rampant, it really angered both heaven and men, plunging the people into misery and suffering!

After another few rounds of small talk, Ye Yuan understood a little about the war between the blood and soul races. Then he chased the Sublime Pill Sect’s people out and started his own closed-seclusion. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Before entering closed-seclusion, Ye Yuan made a long list and handed it to Wang Jun, having him collect the heavenly medicines on the list.

A large number of grade five and even some grade six heavenly medicines were listed on the list. Some heavenly medicines were even very precious.

Fortunately, the Sublime Pill Sect had tens of thousands of years of foundation too. They could still gather some grade six heavenly medicines.

Done with these, Ye Yuan started his closed-seclusion.

The urgent matter on hand was to resolve the problem of the bloody aura on his body.

The blood and soul two races were diametrically opposed. If Ye Yuan went to the soul race like this, he would probably be one-shotted before meeting anyone.

The soul race was a must-go destination.

Ye Yuan’s biggest goal this time was one of the soul race’s three great sacred artifacts: the Purple Ripple Umbrella.

This Purple Ripple Umbrella was a chaos sacred treasure with boundless power.

Ye Yuan’s soul gathering technique must be coupled with the Purple Ripple Umbrella before it could help Mu Lingxue assemble her soul.

It was just that chaos sacred treasures were supreme treasures when placed in any world. How could the soul race possibly lend it to Ye Yuan easily.

Just like the Myriad Realms Mountain in Ye Yuan’s hands, once it was leaked out, that would absolutely cause a sanguinary slaughter.

The soul race’s three great sacred artifacts, the Purple Ripple Umbrella, Soul Killing Bell, and the Forget-me-not Cauldron, each one was a supreme soul artifact. The heavens and myriad worlds only had this one!

Furthermore, looking at it presently, the soul race was far from friendly with humans.

It would be very difficult to borrow it.

However, Ye Yuan finally saw hope after walking all the way until today.

Even if his bones were ground to dust, he had to successfully borrow the Purple Ripple Umbrella too.

Ye Yuan’s mind was completely immersed in the Dao sword.

The current Dao sword seemed to be stained by specks of bloodstains on it.

These were precisely the materialization of the blood origin.

Originally, he thought that once this origin of blood was merged together, it would corrode the Dao sword.

After all, this wisp of blood origin originated from such a powerful Chaos Bloodstone!

But, looking at it now, the power of the Dao sword seemed to exceed his imagination.

Not only did this wisp of blood origin not corrode the Dao sword, but it was also completely integrated into the Dao sword instead!

Ye Yuan could mobilize the power of the blood origin at any time now.

This was also to say that the current Ye Yuan was indeed no different from a bloodkin in the least bit.

It was just that this power was too strong. Ye Yuan was currently unable to control it, so the blood aura on his body could not dissipate at all.

As long as he completely controlled this origin of blood, Ye Yuan would be able to recover back to new.

In other words, the current Ye Yuan was probably the one and only existence across the various heavens and myriad worlds to possess the power of origin at True Sovereign Heaven Realm!

As long as Ye Yuan controlled this power, his strength would soar again!

The Dao sword was indeed a miraculous existence!

Although it was condensed and formed by Ye Yuan using the power of Great Dao, Ye Yuan discovered that he still knew too little about it.

Even Mi Tian was extremely astonished by it too.

There were many divergent cultivators, but someone like Ye Yuan, a divergent cultivator who dared to point at heaven with their sword, was one of its kind.

Maybe there were, but they were all dead.

But Ye Yuan survived.

Not only did he survive, but he also became stronger and stronger instead.

Time passed quietly. Ye Yuan was continuously familiarizing and controlling the power of the blood origin.

But the Sublime Pill Sect’s dissatisfaction with Ye Yuan caused a great clamor.

“Sect Master, based on what?! This kid has an unknown background, yet, he’s riding on top of our heads to be an ancestor! This is nothing yet. The grade six heavenly medicines that barely remained in the sect have practically been all plundered away by him! You’re at any rate an Emperor Realm powerhouse too! Could it be that you can stomach this grievance?” Vice Sect Master, Lu Yan, said with an indignant face.

“Our Sublime Pill Sect is already at the end of our rope to begin with. Now, we actually still have to support such an ancestor!”

“Huhu,?we these people pay homage to our founder every day, hoping that his elderly self can show mercy and save us from extreme misery. Now, things are great. He sent an ancestor down, and we still have to provide for his needs!”

… …

In the Sublime Pill Sect’s great hall, three great half-step Emperor Realms were extremely dissatisfied.

When Ye Yuan went into a closed-seclusion, he demanded a large number of grade six heavenly medicines.

These few years, the Sublime Pill Sect had been declining with each passing day.

The grade six heavenly medicines that Ye Yuan demanded, the Sublime Pill Sect had most of it.

But some of the heavenly medicines were very precious. With the Sublime Pill Sect’s current strength, they paid a huge price before acquiring them too.

Grade six heavenly medicines were not expendable to the present Sublime Pill Sect too.

Ye Yuan’s list heaped disaster after disaster on the Sublime Pill Sect that was on the decline.

However, Wang Jun still gritted his teeth and got it.

Although he had quite a lot of unhappiness too, obeying Ancestor Hang Yang’s legacy teachings, he still carried them out unwaveringly.

The moment Ye Yuan, this ancestor came, he took away a large number of heavenly medicines. This made them extremely dissatisfied.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan, this ancestor that made neither head nor tail, had caused them to be very unhappy too.

If an Emperor Vast Heaven came, or even if it was an Emperor Cloud Heaven, they would just suck it up and acknowledge it.

But, a lower True Sovereign Heaven, no matter how talented you were, what the hell did it have to do with us?

Wang Jun swept Lu Yan a glance and said coolly, “This was what Ancestor Hang Yang passed down! For so many years, each sect master will personally pass it onto the next sect master before being drafted! Lu Yan, if this sect master is drafted this time, this legacy teaching will be inherited by you too! Are you taking over or not?”

Lu Yan could not help choking when he heard that.

To a sect, inheritance was the most important.

Inheritance was not just the inheritance of cultivation methods and martial techniques. It was also the inheritance of responsibilities.

To the current Lu Yan, he did not need to do anything.

But, once he became Sect Master, he would have to fulfill the responsibilities!

Then was he taking over or not?

Sects that could have tens of thousands of years of lineage all had their own raison d’etre.

If they could not even pass down this bit of responsibility, then the sect would have long dissipated.

Moreover, under the current circumstances, where could they go to escape the war between two major races?

If they became itinerant cultivators, it would be even more miserable!

“But, at this rate, our Sublime Pill Sect will be finished!” Lu Yang gritted his teeth and said.

Wang Jun still said coolly, “Without Patriarch Cloudmount, the Sublime Pill Sect wouldn’t have all these today. You and I also wouldn’t have had the lucky chance to reach the Emperor Realm! Therefore, even if the Sublime Pill Sect is finished, we have to carry out this legacy teaching too!”

“Mn??It’s very lively! Everyone’s here, perfect! I still have a list here, Wang Jun. Hurry up and help me take care of it, quickly!”

Right at this time, a voice sounded out. A leisurely looking Ye Yuan walked into the great hall.
