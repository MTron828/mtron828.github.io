Chapter 3039: Pursue!

“How many people from your Zuo Family made it through?” Wang Ningyan asked.

“459 people!” Smugness was written all over Zuo Qingyang’s face.

“Tch,?showing off for? A total of 512 people from our Zhoutian Emperor Palace made it!” Zhou Xianchen said disdainfully.

“Our Melody Nether Heavenly Sect also had 491 people that passed!” Lu Haoran said.

Wang Ningyan said, “For our Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven, there are at least 3000 people who passed ten rounds! I don’t believe it. Those over one million people from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven will probably all be eliminated in this round! It’s impossible for that kind of plane to pass these ten rounds!”

Zhou Xianchen also said, “They definitely gained an advantage by trickery in the Vertical Heaven Stairs! If those million over people all climbed the Vertical Heaven Stairs by relying on their strength, then Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven would have long surmounted above all the heavens. What does it still have to do with us?”

Zuo Qingyang nodded and said, “The few of us definitely can’t lose to Yang Qing this time!”

The few people all had solemn expressions, soaring with fighting intent.

At present, on the Thousand Souls List, Yang Qing had made it through 38 rounds, leaving people far behind in the dust.

Furthermore, his speed got faster and faster.

Of course, the geniuses in all heavens did not relax their vigilance either, all following closely behind.

But Yang Qing’s power was already exuded through the Thousand Souls List.

The geniuses from all heavens felt tremendous pressure one after another.

Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, Feng Qingxuan’s brows were tightly furrowed.

She looked through the Thousand Souls List over and over again and still did not see Ye Yuan’s name.

“Could it be that this guy really didn’t come? Such an opportunity that only comes once in a lifetime, it’s impossible, right? Rather, how can this Yang Qing be so strong?” Feng Qingxuan said with a frown.

She was currently ranked third, being suppressed firmly by Kong Tan.

But what she hoped to see even more was Ye Yuan appearing on the Thousand Souls List.

In the end, he still did not.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, Yang Qing became more excited the more he fought.

This Thousand Souls Hall was simply a treasure vault to him.

After crossing 38 rounds, his improvement became faster and faster.

One had to know that these 1000 people represented the pinnacle during that era.

Fighting with such powerhouses really benefited a lot.

Finally, Yang Qing, who was currently in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes one day, the aura on his body directly rising to the peak.

At this moment, he appeared incredibly powerful.

Yang Qing’s domineeringness immediately attracted a series of exclamations.

“Emperor Azuresky got stronger again!”

“This place is an insurmountable high wall to us, but to Emperor Azuresky, it’s simply like a fantasy paradise!”

“He has already cleared a hundred rounds and occupies the first place on the Thousand Souls List firmly, it really gains face for our Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

“Eh,?he seems to be provoking Heavenly Saint Ye! Could it be …”

… …

Before his voice faded, Yang Qing pointed at Ye Yuan with his long spear and shouted, “Ye Yuan, come and battle!”

Ye Yuan was not surprised. Yang Qing’s strength had improved greatly. It would be weird if he did not find Ye Yuan.

These few days, he watched Yang Qing grow stronger with his own eyes.

The Thousand Souls Hall was the best piece of sharpening stone.

Those geniuses could really be described with the following statement: improving at a tremendous pace here.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re confident!”

Yang Qing grinned and said, “That’s right, I’m confident! I feel that I can break that punch of yours!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Okay, bring it on!”

Yang Qing put away the long spear, a destructive intent that dominated the world spread out immediately.

Those who were weak in strength actually could not stand firm under Yang Qing’s imposing momentum.

It was still the Myriad Dao Annihilation Spear!

But the power of the current Myriad Dao Annihilation Spear was on a completely different level than when competing with Ye Yuan back then.

Yang Qing had already tread out his own Dao!

The so-called Myriad Dao Annihilation was shattering myriad Dao with Spear Dao!

Compared to Ye Yuan’s divine sense turning into myriad and Hegemon Samsara’s experience of reincarnation, it all arrived at the same destination via different means!

Clearing a hundred rounds consecutively, Yang Qing’s move became even more perfect and even stronger.

Strong until it made people despair!

Feeling this terrifying power, everyone’s faces changed one after another.

“So strong … can Heavenly Saint Ye block this spear?”

“This isn’t fair! Yang Qing is only half a step away from grand completion Emperor Vast Heaven!”

“Yang Qing can probably contend with Emperor Sakra Heavens by relying on this move, right?”

… …

They could not help birthing a trace of doubt as to whether or not Ye Yuan could block this spear.

Bang!

Before his voice faded, Yang Qing flew out.

His imposing momentum was broken by Ye Yuan with a punch.

Everyone was dumbfounded with shock.

How could this be?

Such a formidable spear actually could not even block a punch from Ye Yuan?

“Bah!?You freak!” Yang Qing gritted his teeth, picked up his spear, and directly entered the battle formation.

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not say anything.

Yang Qing was different from the others. He was very clear about what he was doing.

If it were others, they would definitely yell at Ye Yuan, saying that he was not allowed to use saint force, and that it’s winning unscrupulously.

But Yang Qing would not!

He knew that to defeat Ye Yuan, he would have to defeat his saint force.

A loss was a loss; he would never make excuses.

To Yang Qing, defeating these people was not the goal.

His final goal was to defeat Ye Yuan!

If he could not win Ye Yuan, then even if he cleared a thousand rounds, it made no difference too.

Time flew by rapidly. The geniuses from all heavens were still continuing to challenge the rounds.

Of course, those who could continue to challenge them were all the top geniuses from all heavens.

Yang Qing had already become everyone’s benchmark.

The various races in all heavens, all of the geniuses were chasing after Yang Qing frenziedly.

But the gap between them grew bigger and bigger.

Yang Qing’s might virtually seeped out of the Thousand Souls List. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Thousand Souls List, the higher up, the more powerful the opponent!

Even Kong Tan, this kind of peerless genius, also gradually felt that his ability was somewhat falling short of his wishes.

From the relentlessness at the beginning, to gradually falling behind by three rounds later on, then five rounds, then ten rounds.

The gap between the first place and the second place grew bigger and bigger.

Yang Qing was like a lone wolf that never knew fatigue, fighting frenziedly and advancing crazily.

The scariest thing was that he could always defeat his opponent every time.

“Just what kind of medicine did Yang Qing this fellow eat? Could it be that this guy never gets tired?” Kong Tan looked at the Thousand Souls List and could not resist cursing.

“Damn it! The gap is widening! Could it be that this Yang Qing is more powerful than Ye Yuan?” Feng Qingxuan also said.

Wang Ningyan had already given up on chasing. She was currently in tenth place and seriously could not move up anymore.

The nine people in front were all like madmen.

Originally, she felt that she was peerlessly elegant and talented, enough to suppress all geniuses.

Even if she could not suppress them, she could also advance at an equal pace.

But now, she knew that she was wrong!

She was somewhat doubting her life.

Except, these geniuses who were chasing after Yang Qing did not know that Yang Qing was being trampled by another person all along.

Every hundred rounds that he cleared, Yang Qing would take the initiative to challenge Ye Yuan.

But unfortunately, Ye Yuan only had one move!

No matter how strong he was, he was unable to surpass Ye Yuan’s punch!

With Ye Yuan, this insurmountable high wall around, Yang Qing was full of vigor.

Hence, he became even crazier.

He placed all of his combat strength on the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s 1000 geniuses.
