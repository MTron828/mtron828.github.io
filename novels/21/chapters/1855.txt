Chapter 1859: Naive

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

On the stage, the collision sounds of streams of divine essence colliding came over. Everyone below the stage was dumbstruck with amazement.

One-sided!

Except, it was not the same as they expected. This match was completely one-sided toward Ye Yuan.

Under Ye Yuan’s strange and unfathomable movement technique, Zhuo Han was being completely brutalized.

“Why ... Why is it like this?”

“Zhuo Han’s talent ranks at the top of the list among the various major imperial capitals too. He’s actually being abused by a Second Firmament Celestial Deity.”

“No wonder Senior Apprentice Sister Leng goes places together with him as a couple. It turns out that it’s like this!”

...

Thousand Soar Mansion’s disciples were all incredibly shocked. They totally did not expect that the Ye Yuan who they normally looked down on, his strength was actually so formidable.

The Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity Zhuo Han was being abused promptly, without any ambiguousness at all.

If one said that previously it was Ye Yuan’s sneak attack succeeding, then right now, Ye Yuan was completely crushing with strength.

No flashiness at all!

Bang!

Ye Yuan stomped on Zhuo Han’s chest with a foot, trampling him onto the ground. He said disdainfully, “Weren’t you going to teach me how to behave? Just based on your bit of strength? Without sufficient strength, you also dare to learn to look down on the world from others, and view others as ants? Who gave you the courage?”

The shock in Zhuo Han’s heart could not use words to describe.

Several hundred years ago, when he and Ye Yuan first met, he could crush the other party with just one hand.

But by relying on his talent, not only did this gap not widen several hundred years later, Ye Yuan caught up from behind instead and surpassed him!

This guy actually fused spatial law and Sword Dao law, his combat power off the charts.

Zhuo Han’s pride as a genius was utterly crushed into pieces by this foot.

“Let go of me, you ignorant fool! When my master learns of this, he’ll definitely waste your cultivation and make you never have a chance to rise again!” Zhuo Han gritted his teeth and said.

Ye Yuan’s face turned cold and he said with a cold smile, “Can’t beat yourself, so you bring your master out? However, your threat is really very foolish!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan lightly tapped toward Zhuo Han’s divine sea with a finger.

Zhuo Han’s pupils constricted, having a look of despair on his face.

But right at this time, a feeling of incredible danger suddenly descended.

“Lad, you dare?!”

True God powerhouse!

Ye Yuan felt the other party’s strength straight away. His body was virtually frozen by this powerful pressure, unable to move at all.

Although his foot was still stepping on Zhuo Han’s body, this foot could not be stomped down at all.

A late-stage True God powerhouse was too powerful!

However, he was Ye Yuan!

He was the Ye Yuan who grasped spatial law!

Even a True God powerhouse’s comprehension in terms of spatial law might not be stronger than him too. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This killing intent was too piercingly cold, there was no way Ye Yuan would resign himself to death.

Feeling this powerful pressure, Zhuo Han’s two eyes lit up. He said in pleasant surprise, “Master!”

However, Leng Qiuling’s face changed drastically. Wanting to take action was already too late.

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh, his figure suddenly disappearing!

What vanished together with him was also Zhuo Han.

A figure stepped out of the void and looked at Ye Yuan with a look of surprise and anger.

“Spatial shift! Terrific lad!”

The arrival was none other than precisely Zhuo Han’s master, Heavenly Water Imperial Capital’s master, Ji Xun.

“Puhwark!”

At the critical moment, even though Ye Yuan avoided Ji Xun’s certain-kill strike, he also suffered heavy injuries.

The might of a True God was no joke.

If it were others, they would have long been crushed into minced meat by the world power.

Currently, Ye Yuan’s palm was pressed on the center of Zhuo Han’s back. As long as divine essence spat out, it could wreck his life force.

The reason why he wanted to bring Zhuo Han to shift together was to capture a hostage.

Otherwise, the power of a True God, even if he unexpectedly avoided the first attack, Ji Xun’s second strike would be sufficient to cause death too.

And he did not have the leeway to resist at all.

“Master, s-save me!” Sensing Ye Yuan’s divine essence wreaking havoc within his body, Zhuo Han was frightened to the extreme in his heart.

Ji Xun’s face fell and he looked at Ye Yuan and said coldly, “Let go of Han-er. I’ll leave you an intact corpse!”

Ye Yuan laughed from extreme fury and said, “Indeed worthy of being master and apprentice, both equally stupid! You already want to kill me, would I let him go? Do you think that I’m as mentally addled as you? Don’t move. You can try if you’re faster or I’m quicker!”

Sensing Ji Xun’s divine essence undulation, Ye Yuan immediately warned the other party.

Ji Xun’s face turned black and he said, “If you dare to touch a single strand of hair of Han-er, I’ll definitely make you regret coming into this world!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Is that so?”

As he said, Ye Yuan spat divine essence. Zhuo Han immediately spewed out a large mouthful of blood, his entire person becoming dispirited and inert.

Ye Yuan dealt his blow very aptly, directly making Zhuo Han lose his ability to resist, but did not kill him too. This was enough to frighten Ji Xun.

Ji Xun’s face changed, aware that he ran into a ruthless character. How could he still dare to act rashly without careful thought?

“Kid, let him go. We can settle things through discussion!” Ji Xun finally lowered his proud head and compromised with Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “What’s there to discuss? You want to scam me to leave Zhuo Han, then kill me at the first moment? I have to admit, although you’re at a ripe old age, you’re still very naive!”

Ji Xun’s face became black as the bottom of a wok. He discovered that this kid was too sharp. His disciple compared to him was simply a weakling.

The moment he opened his mouth, he knew what he wanted to do.

“What the hell do you want?” Ji Xun said with a dark expression.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Wait!”

Finished saying this word, Ye Yuan shut his eyes and stopped talking.

Ji Xun was taken aback, not knowing what Ye Yuan’s words meant.

But very soon, he understood. Another extremely strong aura arrived with a howl.

“Ji Xun, you’re also looking down on my Thousand Soar Imperial Capital too much! An exalted Thousand Soar Imperial Capital powerhouse actually bullied a Celestial Deity Realm junior. Do you still want face or not?!”

The person had yet to arrive, but the voice arrived first.

Gu Tianque’s words were full of rage.

He did not expect that in a blink of an eye, such a major incident actually happened in the Thousand Soar Mansion.

Ji Xun’s brows furrowed and he said, “This boy nearly crippled Han-er, could there be something wrong for me to want to kill him?”

Gu Tianque’s gaze looked towards Ye Yuan, a probing look on his face.

Ye Yuan briefly recounted the matters earlier, Gu Tianque glared and said, “You heard it?”

“M-Master, you have to stand up for me!” Zhuo Han said feebly.

Seeing Gu Tianque’s attitude toward Ye Yuan, Ji Xun seemed to have understood something, his expression rather ugly.

Sure enough, Gu Tianque snorted coldly and said, “Zhuo Han, give up! You and Leng Qiuling, it is impossible! Also, after this incident, the two of you master and apprentice are not allowed to step foot in Thousand Soar Mansion again!”

Zhuo Han’s pupils constricted when he heard that, looking at Gu Tianque in disbelief, a doubtful look on his face.

He could not figure out why Gu Tianque’s attitude would unexpectedly have a 180 degrees turnaround.

Suddenly, he recalled the words Ye Yuan said.

It turned out that ... this time it was not Ye Yuan being Leng Qiuling’s shield anymore.

Gu Tianque really had the intention of matchmaking the two of them!

It was laughable. He was still posing as Thousand Soar Imperial Capital’s son-in-law previously in front of the Thousand Soar Mansion’s disciples.
