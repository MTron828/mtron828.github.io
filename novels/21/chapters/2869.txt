Chapter 2875 Ants Have No Right to Give Up!

Everyone’s hearts trembled!

This guy had such speed, no wonder he was gone in a blink of an eye!

It seemed like this punk’s wild arrogance was not without logic.

It was just that they did not understand; he was already the first to reach, so why was he still staying here.

The first to open the passageway, this was an incredible glory!

However, Bloodtrue also secretly let out a sigh of relief.

Nearly failed miserably at a simple task!

“Waited so long for us? Huhu, boy, what are you trying to do?” Chou Yang said with a cold laugh. Ye Yuan smiled with ill-intent and said, “Nothing, I just want to tell you guys that other than me, nobody can take a step into the passageway.”

The moment these words came out, over 80 thousand people burst into thunderous laughter.

Were you freaking joking?

Chou Yang laughed loudly and said, “Bloodazure, is your brain spoiled? In the hundred sons battle, there has never been only one person who makes it out of the passageway entrance! You mean that you want to stop over 80 thousand of us by yourself?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I never said that!”

Everyone sneered coldly and were just about to retort but heard him say, “I’m saying … to kill until no one dares to go in!”

Stop?

It did not exist!

I’m going to kill all of you, bro!

Everyone was shocked again.

This guy was absolutely a mad man! You freaking bragged until even you believed it yourself, right?

“Hahaha … I’m so scared! Punk, come kill me then!”

“Yeah, yeah, we all, these half-step True Sovereign Heavens, are too weak. I beg you, kill me.”

“Bring it on. I really want to see how you kill until no one dares to go in.”

Ye Yuan had completely become a clown!

These words really sounded hilarious to the extreme.

Somewhere in space, Su Mu two people also exchanged glances, staring wide-eyed and tongue-tied.

They had really never seen before such an arrogant young man.

Although Ye Yuan’s spatial rule also surprised them just now, just based on this and he wanted to deal with over 80 thousand people?

Let alone that speed was not everything; strength was the king’s way!

No matter what, everyone’s final goal was to pass through the passageway. Even if your speed was fast, it could not be brought into play under this kind of circumstances.

If everyone rushed forward, you could only forcibly resist.

Otherwise, the boasting that you made would become a joke.

Boom!

Amidst the loud laughter, Ye Yuan suddenly attacked. That ‘I beg you, kill me’ statement was directly blown apart, completely erased!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Since you’re begging me, then I’ll satisfy you!”

The expressions of Bloodtrue and the rest changed drastically.

This punch was so strong!

“I beg you, kill me”, was a top powerhouse too, half-step True Sovereign Heaven. He actually died without even having the time to react.

Although it was a surprise attack, this also showed that Ye Yuan was very strong!

Bloodtrue’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said, “Alright, you’ve already proved your strength! You have the qualifications to enter the passageway! Go in. We won’t stop you!”

He felt that Ye Yuan’s strength was probably not weaker than his own.

If they really fought, then he would probably have to use all of his strength.

Right now, he did not want to expose his strength too early. He naturally also did not want to fight with Ye Yuan until they were both wounded.

But Chou Yang’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “Bloodtrue, what do you mean?”

Bloodtrue said coolly, “There is no meaning at all. There’s no need to waste time in this level! Want to fight, do it after entering the next level!”

Chou Yang was a little indignant, but he also felt that Ye Yuan’s strength was likely not weaker than his.

That blow earlier, he examined his own conscience and felt that he could not do better than Ye Yuan.

Although this punk talked big, he still had some strength.

The others stopped talking, clearly tacitly consenting to Bloodtrue’s recommendation.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Are you all misunderstanding something? I’m not flaunting martial prowess to you all. I only want to kill people! None of you guys are allowed to enter the next level!”

Bloodtrue’s pupils constricted, and he said in a solemn voice, “Bloodazure, don’t refuse face when it’s given!”

He was truly infuriated! This punk was posturing a little too much!

But, just as he was enraged, Ye Yuan moved!

It was only to see Ye Yuan throw a punch out, aiming straight for one of the top half-step True Sovereign Heavens.

Boom!

That person was directly killed without the slightest strength to fight back!

Everyone’s hearts trembled wildly. If the first

genuine strength! It was because everyone was already on guard. But the result was still an instant kill!

This time, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of stopping, one punch following another.

The places that he passed through were all him instantly killing the others!

No matter how strong you were, you were all unable to take one punch from me! This fist technique was the dragon race martial technique that Mi Tian improved on with the Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist as the foundation.

Mi Tian was once a Hegemon Realm powerhouse, his horizons extremely far. Altering a fist technique was naturally easily accomplished.

After improving it and matching it with the Blood Imitation Pill, the power that Ye Yuan released carried a thick bloody and evil aura, being exactly alike blood race martial techniques.

Back then, when Ye Yuan’s bloodline had just evolved, his combat power could already one-shot the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons.

Now that his strength had improved greatly, killing these so-called powerhouses was not worth mentioning at all.

Seeing Ye Yuan rampage in all directions, Bloodtrue’s heart shook wildly.

This strength was too terrifying!

“Everyone join hands and kill this punk first!” Bloodtrue roared angrily.

Everyone’s heart turned cold, immediately joining forces.

zens

More than a hundred half-step True Sovereign Heavens with apex strength directly surrounded Ye Yuan until not even water could seep through. Among them, there were even some of those top powerhouses. However, it was still useless!

The more Chou Yang watched, the more alarmed he became. The powerhouses that he viewed as his opponents could not last one punch under Ye Yuan’s hands!

The current Chou Yang was terrified until his courage and spirit were crumbling. He desperately retreated backward, hoping that Ye Yuan had forgotten about him.

Who could have thought that this guy was so strong?

Blunder!

A miscalculation!

He finally understood that Ye Yuan ignored him back then not due to haughtiness, but it was because he really did not have him in his eyes!

Finally, he quietly withdrew from the battlefield and could not help heaving a sigh of relief in his heart.

Luckily, the others held Ye Yuan back!

He did not expect that Bloodtrue actually hid his strength.

Among so many people, only he could barely manage to exchange a blow or two with Ye Yuan.

It was also fortunate that this guy hid his strength. Otherwise, this time, he would really have to die.

“Eh, didn’t you say that you’re not trash and even wanted to prove it to me? Why? Giving you the opportunity now, but you want to leave?” Suddenly, a deadly voice sounded in his ears.

Chou Yang was frightened until he blew smoke from all seven orifices, his entire person almost blowing up.

But he could not find Ye Yuan.

It was as if the surrounding was all Ye Yuan!

“W-Where are you?” Chou Yang was fully on guard, all the hair on his body standing on end.

“I’m right in front of you. You can’t even see?”

Chou Yang’s pupils constricted, only to hear a long sigh transmit over, “I gave you a chance. But it looks like … you’re indeed still just a piece of trash!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Boom!

A punch slammed out. Chou Yang was dead!

It was naturally very easy for Ye Yuan to kill Chou Yang.

But he deliberately did not kill in order to let him feel fear.

Among the thousands of experts, in a blink of an eye, there were only three or four left.

There was even a large swathe of the others who died.

But Chou Yang’s death triggered everyone’s nerves.

Chou Yang’s strength was absolutely the most pinnacle existence in this group of people.

But, even he was dead, without the slightest strength to fight back.

“We’re not entering! All of us are not going in!! Don’t kill me!” He Ming’s courage and spirit had crumbled as he said.

Bloodtrue also had a solemn expression as he said, “Bloodazure, you win! I give up!”

He did not feel that Ye Yuan dared to kill him because he was Deputy City Lord Bloodsword’s descendant!

The consequences of offending an Emperor Sakra Heaven were unimaginable!

Boom! A punch was sent out. He Ming was directly blown apart.

Bloodtrue’s pupils constricted, only to see Ye Yuan’s devilish voice transmit over, “Sorry, I never said that I wouldn’t kill you all if you beg for mercy! Ants have no right to give up!”
