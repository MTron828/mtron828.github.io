Chapter 2856 Owed So Much Contribution Points!

Hearing this voice, Yang Qing’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Zheng Qian, who the hell do you think you are? To also dare scold others a good-for-nothing? Grand completion True Sovereign Heaven and you were beaten by your Grandpa Qing until you had to search the ground for your teeth. You have the cheek to call out too?”

Zheng Qian did not care either, saying with a snicker, “Isn’t some guy who can’t advance to Hegemon Realm a good-for-nothing? A grade five realm profound grade expert actually doesn’t have the sect’s ancestors take him in as a disciple! Hahaha, what a big joke! As for you, you can’t jump around for more than a few days, no matter how genius of a person you are! My Lord Qing, if you have the ability, posture to Senior Apprentice Brother Luo Hao!”

Yang Qing’s expression instantly became very ugly. Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said, “What’s wrong, Yang Qing?” Zheng Qian smiled and said, “Trash, you don’t know it yet, right? Yang Qing killed Senior Apprentice Brother Luo Hao’s biological younger brother. Now, the two of them have already arranged a life-and-death battle, which will be carried out the day after tomorrow! Senior Apprentice Brother Luo Hao is ranked fourth on the True Sovereign List, a half-step Emperor Realm mighty expert! Do you think that he has hope of surviving?”

In the Extreme Medicine Sect, grand completion True Sovereign Heavens were as plentiful as oxen fur, but half-step Emperor Realms were very, very few.

Reaching half-step Emperor Cloud Heaven meant that there was very high hope of stepping into Emperor Cloud Heaven!

Hence, the majority of those able to reach this step were geniuses!

And Luo Hao was even above average among them!

Yang Qing was practically already matchless in grand completion True Sovereign Heaven.

The vast majority of those ranked in front of him on the True Sovereign List were half-step Emperor Realm.

With Yang Qing’s current cultivation realm strength, it was definitely impossible to beat them.

Furthermore, Luo Hao was even a top powerhouse among half-step Emperor Realms!

True Sovereign List rank fourth, that was an existence that might step into Emperor Realm at any time!

Ye Yuan looked at Yang Qing and said, “You can’t win?”

Yang Qing shook his head and smiled bitterly. This posturing could not continue anymore.

Geniuses had a limit too. It was impossible to jump realms and challenge limitlessly.

“How long can you last?” Ye Yuan asked again.

“One move!” Yang Qing was full of bitterness as he said.

He had challenged before half-step Emperor Realm powerhouses, but the gap was still too

big.

True Sovereign List, half-step Emperor Realm was a watershed.

Even if one was ranked one in grand completion True Sovereign Heavens, it was also impossible to be a match for a half-step Emperor Realm.

Hence, the gap between Yang Qing and Luo Hao was tremendous!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If let you break through to grand completion True Sovereign Heaven, would it be enough?”

Yang Qing’s eyes lit up, and he said in pleasant surprise, “Of course it’s enough! If I can reach grand completion True Sovereign Heaven, I can definitely pummel him until he has to search the ground for his teeth!”

The expression of Zheng Qian, who was next to them, changed too, but very soon, he smiled again and said, “Tsk tsk, profound grade expert is indeed very domineering when talking! However … trash, if I didn’t guess wrongly, you don’t seem to have contribution points yet after entering the sect, right? Even if you want to refine pills, how will you exchange for heavenly medicines without contribution points?”

At this time, Wang Lin appeared from god knows where and said with a smile, “It’s not just no contribution points. He even owes the Scripture Library 54,450 contribution points! Although Martial Uncle Zuo Chen gave notice, you’ve already exited seclusion now and should repay the contribution points! Ye Yuan, for a very long time after today, you’ll probably be refining heavenly pills for the sect for free to repay the contribution points!”

Ye Yuan was stupefied. There was still such a thing?

Ye Yuan really did not know about this!

It was naturally impossible for the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples to make endless demands.

A major sect of close to 100 thousand people, the consumption every day was astonishing. Without contribution to the sect, one naturally could not get the resources that they deserved.

Yang Qing had run all over the place these few years too, risking his life to earn contribution points. That was why he improved rapidly.

In reality, the Scripture Library did not allow credit charges. But Ye Yuan’s seniority was too frightening. There was naturally no one who would say anything about him.

According to Ye Yuan’s identity as Zuo Chen’s disciple, he had 300 starting contribution points when he entered the sect.

And the Scripture Library’s sixth level, each day required 15 contribution points!

Therefore, Ye Yuan could only last for 20 days.

Later, he revealed his identity to Fan Li and the rest, and they became even more afraid of mentioning about contribution points.

To the outside, they just said that Zuo Chen gave notice. That was why they allowed Ye Yuan to overdraft on the contribution points.

But, after he exited seclusion, these contribution points all had to be repaid.

Speaking about it was coincidental too. Wang Lin was in charge of these matters in the Scripture Library. So these things that were on the surface, he knew about it.

Hearing that Ye Yuan exited seclusion, he naturally had to come and collect the debt.

Fan Li these big shots naturally would not care about these trivial matters.

Of course, if Ye Yuan went to give notice, this would not be a problem. But his true identity would probably be exposed. Zheng Qian was also stupefied when he heard it, immediately laughing and said, “54 thousand contribution points! Hahaha, trash, you’re really broke! Even if you refine pills for the sect without sleeping or resting, you’ll also need more than 20 years before you can repay these contribution points! You can’t even fend for yourself anymore. You still want to meddle in Yang Qing’s affairs? Trash is trash!”

Ye Yuan’s expression was strange as he said, “Is 50 thousand contribution points a lot?”

Yang Qing nodded his head helplessly and said, “It’s too much! In my ten years, I spent seven years doing the sect’s missions and only barely managed to get 17 thousand over contribution points in total! More than 50 thousand … you’re really prodigal!”

Earning contribution points was very hard!

The reason why Zheng Qian said 20 years was because he knew that Ye Yuan could refine profound grade heavenly pills!

Otherwise, it might not even be repaid after 50 years! Zheng Qian could not help laughing loudly when he heard that and said, “Yang Qing, just wait to die! Moreover, this trash merely broke through to profound grade for ten years. It’s totally impossible for him to refine profound grade heavenly imperial pills currently! Also, to refine profound grade heavenly imperial pills, the price of each grade five heavenly medicine isn’t lower than grade six heavenly medicines. Calculating it, it will at least be tens of thousands of contribution points too! Therefore, you can give up on this!”

The dawn that Yang Qing had just seen was completely shattered by Zheng Qian.

What Zheng Qian said was completely right! The heavenly medicines that heavenly imperial pills needed were too valuable! If it was in the past, it was still alright. Now, Heaven One was waging war with the blood race. The remaining territory was only two-thirds of Heaven One Continent. It was very hard for the sec to enter the blood race’s territory to harvest heavenly medicines.

Hence, the price of these heavenly medicines would naturally be even more expensive.

Wang Lin also smiled and said, ‘Ye Yuan, go and report to Gray Fate Peak now. Otherwise, I’m going to report to the Law Enforcement Hall and have them come and take care of

you!”

Ye Yuan crippled Lu Daoyi. Now, seeing Ye Yuan’s good friend be killed was also a delightful thing! Yang Qing heaved a sigh and said, “Ye Yuan, I appreciate your good intentions. The trouble that I caused, I’ll bear it myself!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Can’t even last one move, what the hell can you bear! Leave this to me. You don’t have to worry anymore. Have a good sleep later and wreck that whatever Luo Hao the day after tomorrow for me!”

With regards to Yang Qing, Ye Yuan could trust him.

This guy looked unreliable, but he had a sense of propriety when doing things.

Yang Qing definitely did not indiscriminately kill Luo Hao’s younger brother. There must be a reason for this. With his relationship with Yang Qing, how could he possibly look on indifferently with folded arms? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even if he revealed his identity, he would save Yang Qing too!

Of course, that way, his own safety would have no more guarantee.

However, if he had to use seniority to pressure people with this minor thing, then he would also be too defeated!
