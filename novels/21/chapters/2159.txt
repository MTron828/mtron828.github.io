Chapter 2163: Kneeling neither to Heaven nor Earth!

“Alright, Dragon Sons, stop arguing. Whatever grudges you have, you can naturally settle it in the Mist Battlefield.”

At this time, the protector elder, Ao Qi, who was leading the team finally stepped forward to speak.

Those present were all Sons of the Heavenly Dragon and were also existences that had the hopes of advancing to be a Heavenly Dragon.

Although he was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, he could not afford to provoke a single one.

But if he still did not speak at this time, both sides were probably going to start fighting.

“Humph!” Ao Yu snorted coldly and stopped talking.

Ao Qi said coolly, “Alright, it’s almost time. We should enter the Heavenly Dragon Mountain!”

It was only to see him flick his sleeves grandly. The few people were virtually unable to resist and were brought by him flying toward Heavenly Dragon Mountain.

Ye Yuan only saw a blur before his eyes, and he arrived on a platform very soon.

Above the platform, it was still blocked by a cloud of fog, unable to see clearly.

Ye Yuan could feel that although they had already entered the Heavenly Dragon Mountain here, it was just the foot of Heavenly Dragon Mountain.

Upon entering Heavenly Dragon Mountain, Ye Yuan felt that the spiritual energy was extremely abundant, not beneath the Heavenspan Mountain’s.

Sure enough, this place was an excellent venue for cultivation. No wonder even Ao Zhen that kind of powerhouse wanted to enter this place too.

At this time, there were already quite a number of youngsters standing on the platform. These people all had a Heavenly Dragon Mark at their glabella area. Clearly, they were all Sons of the Heavenly Dragon.

“It’s Purpledragon Stronghold’s people. Huhu, the last time, Purpledragon Stronghold was at the bottom. The ones that came this time are also nothing much!”

“Weaklings will always be weaklings. Even if they became a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, they are also a bunch of trash!”

“If I had to say, Purpledragon Stronghold’s qualification should just be directly revoked! They actually sent a First Firmament Empyrean over this time, looks like Purpledragon Stronghold really has no one.”

... ...

Ye Yuan and the rest still had not stood firmly when a series of mockery immediately came over.

Those Sons of the Heavenly Dragon were clearly very unfriendly toward Purpledragon Stronghold. Each and every one of them had looks of amusement on their faces.

Ao Qi’s expression was very ugly, but the status of these Sons of the Heavenly Dragon were all higher than him, he really could not talk back.

Purpledragon Stronghold’s people, including Ao Yu, each and every one of their expressions was very ugly.

“Ao Qi, it’s you leading the team this time again? During the last time, your Purpledragon Stronghold was virtually completely wiped out. Only one escaped from the Mist Battlefield and even had his Heavenly Dragon Mark stripped. Is that boy dead yet?” Not far away, a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse said with a look of ridicule.

Ao Qi’s face fell and he said, “Long Zifeng, you guys mere took fifth place and you’re already arrogant until like this?”

Long Zifeng laughed loudly and said, “In front of Heavenly Dragon Stronghold, I naturally don’t dare to be arrogant. But in front of your Purpledragon Stronghold, this emperor naturally has the capital to be arrogant! Furthermore, the Battle of Dragon Sons this time, our Cloud Dragon Stronghold’s Long Seven has the potential to aim for the top three!”

Ao Qi smiled coldly and he said, “Top three, you really dare to say that! Putting aside the Heavenly Dragon Stronghold, Black Dragon Stronghold and Auspicious Dragon Stronghold both have extremely strong bloodlines. Just the likes of you guys also want to enter the top three?”

Long Zifeng had a smug look as he said, “Long Seven already awoken two innate divine abilities. Furthermore, his Heavenly Dragon Mark already awoken! Do you think he has the strength to enter the top three?”

Heavenly Dragon Mark was not just a symbol of status.

That was the powerful strength that Heavenly Dragon Mountain bestowed on ordinary dragons. Once awaken the Heavenly Dragon Mark, one would obtain powerful strength and could let their martial techniques and divine abilities obtain varying degrees of augmentation, the power being boundless.

Of course, wanting to awaken the Heavenly Dragon Mark, one also needs tremendous lucky chance and talent in itself.

Among the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon present, there were scanty few capable of awakening the Heavenly Dragon Mark.

Furthermore, the dragon race’s innate divine abilities were even harder to awaken than the Qilin Clan. Furthermore, the power of each kind of innate divine ability was tremendous.

Long Seven actually awakened two innate divine abilities, his strength could be imagined!

Hearing Long Zifeng’s smug voice, the faces of many Sons of the Heavenly Dragon present changed slightly.

If it was really as Long Zifeng said, he would really have hopes of entering the top three!

“All came huh.” At this time, an illusory voice suddenly sounded out in everyone’s ears.

A sagely-looking old man slowly came down from the clouds and landed on the platform.

The group of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon, including Heavenly Emperors, knelt down one after another when they saw this old man.

“We pay respects to Lord Morningstar!”

When Ye Yuan looked at the old man, his pupils could not help shrinking.

This old man gave him an unfathomable feeling. His aura was not beneath Ji Mo’s!

This was also to say that this old man was surely a late-stage Heavenly Emperor terrifying existence.

But this old man was much lousier compared to that one he met in the Dragon Eye Cave.

Morningstar swept a glance, but his gaze landed on Ye Yuan.

When Ao Yu saw this scene, he could not help smiling coldly.

At this time, everyone knelt down, only Ye Yuan alone stood there like a wooden rod, appearing extremely towering.

This brat had eyes but could not see. When he saw Lord Morningstar, he actually did not fall to his knees, this was asking for trouble!

Even if one was a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, their status would also be inferior to a genuine Lord Heavenly Dragon.

In front of a Lord Heavenly Dragon, even a Dragon Lord was also merely mediocre.

“Ye Yuan, this is Lord Morningstar! Lord Morningstar is a Heavenly Dragon, his status being most lofty. Why haven’t you paid respects?” Ao Qi said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I, Ye Yuan, kneel to neither Heaven nor Earth, only to my parents! I can bow, but kneeling ... forget it!”

Ao Yu sneered and said, “Fool! Courting death!”

Heavenly Emperors did not have the authority to kill Sons of the Heavenly Dragon, but Heavenly Dragons did!

Even if Morningstar would not casually kill people, punishing could be done.

“Hahaha, a fine kneeling to neither Heaven nor Earth! Ye Yuan, hope that you still have this kind of breadth of spirit when you reach my level of boundary!” Morningstar said with a loud laugh.

“Senior Morningstar, rest assured. Ye Yuan’s heart will never change!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

He said so and also did so.

Morningstar sized Ye Yuan up rather interestedly and said, “You’re the newly promoted Son of the Heavenly Dragon, Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Precisely so.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Morningstar said, “Good, hope that you won’t let this emperor down in the Battle of Dragon Sons this time!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I definitely won’t let Senior down.”

Morningstar nodded slightly, but beckoned his hand at Long Xiaochun and said, “Xiaochun, come over.”

Ao Yu was stunned, a baffled look on his face.

It was over just like that?

On what basis?

Disrespect towards a Heavenly Dragon was a major offense!

A powerful like Morningstar did not allow the slightest bit of disobedience at all.

But he let Ye Yuan off just like that so easily?

Ao Yu knelt on the ground, his face vacant, disbelief on his face.

Not just him, everyone was incomparably shocked.

A haughty fellow like Ye Yuan, shouldn’t Lord Morningstar have smacked him to death with one slap?

They did not understand, but Ye Yuan had some guesses.

Most likely, the way he obtained the Heavenly Dragon Mark was different from the others.

The existence in the Dragon Eye Cave was definitely not an ordinary Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

It might even be a level of existence like Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Toward that kind of existence, Ye Yuan still did not have a concept at present. But he had a blurry understanding of it. It did not seem as simple as just there being a massive chasm between Heavenly Emperor and Dao Ancestor.

Long Xiaochun was like a startled rabbit. Pursing her mouth, she shuffled her feet over to Morningstar’s side and called in a low voice, “Grandpa Morningstar.”

Morningstar rebuked her and said, “You lass! This time, you must go up the Heavenly Dragon Mountain with me!”
