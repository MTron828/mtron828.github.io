Chapter 1877: Innumerable Ghost Shadows

“Damn it! You damn thing, get lost for Your Father!” Inside the karst cavern, came Gu Tianque’s roars.

Gu Tianque and Ghostwind, two people, were currently fighting fiercely without rest inside the cave.

Gu Tianque’s strength was a notch higher. But wanting to finish off Ghostwind within a short time was also not an easy thing.

On a stone platform in the depths of the karst cavern, a fist-sized seven-colored rock was placed quietly there. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, guessing that it should be the Seven-Colored Aegirine.

Even separated so far away, Ye Yuan could also feel the tremendous energy contained inside it. It even made the injuries on his body instantly become much better.

“This is the Seven-Colored Aegirine? Indeed mystical, no wonder even Empyrean powerhouses are moved,” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

While talking, waves of powerful undulations came from behind. Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean and the fiend race Empyreans already chased after.

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan took a stride out and arrived on top of the stone platform.

“The Seven-Colored Aegirine is mine!” Below, came Gu Tianque’s roar.

Ye Yuan totally ignored him, reaching his hand out and grabbing at the Seven-Colored Aegirine.

Ghostwind laughed savagely and said, “Blind and reckless thing, a measly Celestial Deity Realm also wants to encroach upon the Seven-Colored Aegirine!”

He knew that that stone platform was not a good place that could let people take away the Seven-Colored Aegirine at will.

Woo! Woo!

Ye Yuan’s hand had not touched the Seven-Colored Aegirine yet and a cold to the extreme aura already came over.

Countless ghosts howled and screamed, dashing out of the stone platform, and pouncing over toward Ye Yuan.

These evil ghosts all had incomparably powerful auras. Even if a True God Realm powerhouse was here, they would also be torn to pieces.

This tiny stone platform was actually a place that hid ghosts!

When Gu Tianque saw this scene, his complexion turned deathly pale too. Even if Ghostwind did not chase after, if he went to take the Seven-Colored Aegirine rashly, his outcome would likely not be much better too.

Fortunately now, there was Ye Yuan luring out these fierce ghosts.

“Hahaha, the Seven-Colored Aegirine is mine!”

Right at this time, Gu Tianque suddenly erupted, forcing Ghostwind back several steps.

Following which, his figure was like lightning, pouncing over toward the Seven-Colored Aegirine.

Ghostwind got a big shock, but it was already too late to want to go and intercept.

But right at this time, a terrifying soul vortex erupted from Ye Yuan’s body.

The shrill screams emitted by those fierce ghosts were as if Ye Yuan was a dreadful monster; avoiding him as if he was a plague.

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and grabbed, directly grabbing the Seven-Colored Aegirine in his hand.

Those fierce ghosts did not dare to approach Ye Yuan but took Gu Tianque to be the target to vent, pouncing over toward him frenziedly.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Right at this time, three extremely powerful auras barged into the karst cavern, they were precisely the three great Empyrean powerhouses!

“Heh heh, kid, see where you’re gonna run still!” Qiao Yuan said with a mocking look.

“Didn’t expect that a Celestial Deity Realm brat could actually block a punch from Your Father! Truly impressive! However, it also ends here. Hand over the Seven-Colored Aegirine!” Eymond said with a cold smile.

This karst cavern only had one exit. Right now, the exit was thoroughly blocked off by three great Empyrean powerhouses, there was no way out at all.

The other powerhouses also followed inside but hid far away, not daring to come over at all.

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s gaze also locked onto Ye Yuan firmly and said furiously, “Kid, put down the Seven-Colored Aegirine!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze glinted and he suddenly smiled and said to the two great Empyrean powerhouses, “When did I say that I was going to run?”

Qiao Yuan was taken aback and said with a cold smile, “Best that you don’t run. Looks like you’ve resigned yourself to date! Hand over the Seven-Colored Aegirine then, and this Empyrean can spare you from death!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was amused and said with a big laugh, “You fiends, each and every one of you are dumb like pigs, to actually take others to be as silly as you all? Spare me from death? This kind of trick, even three-year-old kids won’t believe either, right?”

Qiao Yuan’s face fell, and he said in a cold voice, “Brat, you’re very good! This Empyrean will refine you into a fiend slave and imprison your divine soul for a hundred thousand years!”

Ye Yuan ignored him, but he said to Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean, “You come over. The Seven-Colored Aegirine, I’ll only hand over to you! Furthermore, I can help you chase away these two fools!”

The moment Qiao Yuan duo heard this, they laughed wildly without ceasing.

“Hahaha! Boy, your joke is really very hilarious, I’m almost laughing myself into fits.” Qiao Yuan said with a big laugh.

Forget about them, even Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean himself also did not take Ye Yuan’s words seriously at all.

But, Ye Yuan saying to hand the Seven-Colored Aegirine over to him still moved him.

It was only to see his figure moved, arriving in front of Ye Yuan.

An extremely gloomy and cold aura came over, nearly freezing Ye Yuan into a corpse.

The severity of a ghost empyrean’s Yin aura, ordinary powerhouses were not able to withstand it at all.

“Brat, hand over the Seven-Colored Aegirine then,” Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean said.

“Wild Blade, still remember this old man?” A voice transmitted right into Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s sea of consciousness, making his entire body shudder.

“You ... You’re Lord Dustless?” Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean replied.

Dustless laughed and said, “Huhu, it’s precisely this old man!”

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s body trembled violently. This aura, he was too familiar. Who could it be if not Dustless?

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove rearing Ghost Dao powerhouses, what did he use to raise?

Of course it was the Soul Suppressing Pearl!

This divine soul-type empyrean spirit treasure was not what ordinary empyrean spirit treasures could compare to.

One could say that the Ghost Dao powerhouses here were all trained by Dustless single-handedly.

“T-That’s great! Your Excellency, you’re alright! It’s really great!” Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean was extremely agitated.

“Huhu, now isn’t the time to catch up, I’ll possess your body and teach those two fiend race Empyreans a little lesson,” Dustless said.

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean did not hesitate at all, saying with a nod, “Okay! With Lord Dustless taking action, those two damn things will definitely die very horribly!”

Suddenly, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s eyes suddenly snapped open, the imposing momentum on his body suddenly changing.

Qiao Yuan and Eymond’s faces changed, secretly thinking that things were not good.

They did not stop Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean just now because no matter whose hands the Seven-Colored Aegirine was in, the two of them could not avoid a fight with Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean.

As long as they blocked the exit and did not let them go out, it would do.

Fighting two versus one, the two of their chances of victory were very high.

As for Ye Yuan saying that he could let Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean defeat them, they only took it to be a joke.

But now, they had a trace of foreboding premonition in their hearts.

“Eymond, attack!” Qiao Yuan shouted fiercely, rushing together with Eymond, pincer-attacking Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean.

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean gave a cold laugh and said with a furious roar, “Ghost Dao Hundred Runes ... Innumerable Ghost Shadows! Dark Extermination Ghost Blade!”

In an instant, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean transformed into countless incarnations, each one’s aura was incomparably powerful.

Qiao Yuan’s and Eymond’s expressions changed suddenly, urging the fiend essence within their bodies to the limit.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Countless blade images landed frenziedly, turning into an airtight blade-net, slicing the entire space into fragments.

Qiao Yuan and Eymond wailed miserably, with their figures flying out backward. The fiend energy on their bodies immediately decreased significantly.

Qiao Yuan struggled to crawl to his feet, gnashing his teeth in hatred as he said, “Damn it! How can it be like this?!”
