Chapter 2157: Hide And Seek

A Third Firmament Empyrean said, “Big Brother, this brat hides inside the spatial rift. He wants to play hide and seek with us!”

“A fool who overestimates his own ability! This stretch of space is our old den. He wants to play hide and seek with us in our lair? This Empyrean wants to see whether it’s him who plays with me, or me who toys with him! Long Xi, Long Zhao, Long Ming, the three of you each lead a team and march forward. Play with this kid well!” Long Xiao said with a cold smile.

Long Xi, Long Zhao, Long Ming, were those Third Firmament Empyrean powerhouses.

Getting Long Xiao’s orders, the two people clasped their hands and said smilingly, “Big Brother, rest assured. This area of spatial rifts is our own backyard. Even if that brat wants to run, he also can’t escape!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This area of space was layered upon layers; complicated to the extreme.

Long Xiao’s main camp was established inside.

So, to them, this place was too familiar.

Ye Yuan entering this region of spatial rifts was equivalent to walking right into a trap.

Long Xi three people each led their own squad and started digging everywhere, carrying out a carpet-bombing-style search on this area of space.

“This brat is really impressive! There are so many of us, we actually failed to kill him!”

“Humph! Mingxin’s death must be avenged! If I catch him, I’ll definitely hack him into a thousand pieces!”

Long Mingxin was the First Firmament Empyrean that Ye Yuan killed. This result made them very aggrieved.

So many people besieged Ye Yuan, but in the end, he actually escaped.

“Enough! Everyone, be more alert! Especially when we get to those folded space areas, be careful of his ambush!” Long Xi said in a solemn voice.

Following Long Xiao, he could be said to be a veteran of hundred battles and also developed an extremely vigilant personality.

Although this was in their own lair, he still maintained sufficient vigilance.

Suddenly, a figure flashed out ahead, who could it be if not Long Xiaochun?

“Hehehe ... you bad guys, go and die!” Long Xiaochun made a funny face as she said.

Long Xi’s face fell. Lifting his hand, it was a swift and fierce blade!

“Oh my!”

Long Xiaochun cried out strangely, figure flashing, and actually disappeared.

Bang!

From the diagonal stab, a sudden shocking energy undulation directly blasted a First Firmament Empyrean to meat paste!

“Ao Zhou!” Long Xi’s two eyes went wide and he roared angrily.

This Ao Zhou was Long Xi’s old subordinate. The two people’s feelings were extremely deep.

Long Xi did not expect that Ao Zhou was actually killed by Ye Yuan right under his eyelids!

This move earlier was clearly True Sword Hollow Etch. Who was it if not Ye Yuan attacking?

True Sword Hollow Etch this move releasing, it did not have any energy undulations at all. It was impossible to guard against.

Coupled with Long Xiaochun being deliberately misleading earlier, attracting everyone’s attention, with this, even Long Xi did not manage to react to it as well.

“W-Why would this place have an area of folded space? Why?! Why have we never discovered it before?” Long Xi howled.

Long Xi looked carefully, the place where Ye Yuan suddenly sneak attacked just now was actually an area of extremely hidden space!

This hidden space, they had never discovered it before.

But Ye Yuan actually hid here and made a move against them!

This was also to say that Ye Yuan understood this spatial rift better than them!

“Chase! Even if Your Father turns the spatial rifts upside-down, I’ll also find you!”

The Long Xi under a towering rage tunneled into this folded space with a grunt.

Swoosh!

A figure flashed past from afar, Long Xi sent a saber slash over without a word.

But that figure flashed, dodging this blade lightly, and disappeared once more.

Long Xi’s face fell and he said with a cold yell, “Chase!”

Just like this, Long Xi passed through one folded space after another.

“Ahhh!!”

Suddenly, a miserable scream came over.

Long Xi’s expression changed, and he cried out in surprise, “It’s Long Bi’s voice! That boy actually, killed a Second Firmament Empyrean?”

A subordinate warned, “Lord Long Xi, this boy is full of tricks. Furthermore, he’s extremely powerful. We can’t keep on chasing after him like this! Otherwise, we’ll be routed by him!”

Long Xi’s expression flickered incessantly. Finally, he still nodded his head.

But, when they attempted to traverse through space and find the way they came from, they discovered to their dismay that ... they were lost!

“Lord Long Xi, this ... How is this possible?””

“This place is our doorstep. We actually ... actually got lost?”

... ...

The group of subordinates was in a state of disbelief. They actually got lost at their front door!

They thought that they knew this place like the back of their hands, but being brought around by Ye Yuan a few times, they actually could not find the way that they came from anymore.

Long Xi’s eyes narrowed and he gritted his teeth and said, “This boy’s spatial law is even more formidable than we imagined! He brought us into a spatial maze!”

“S-Spatial maze? Then ... Then wouldn’t we be unable to go out?”

“This isn’t possible! Since it’s a spatial maze, how does he get out himself?”

When everyone heard this news, each and every one of their expressions changed drastically.

Space was an extremely convoluted and profound thing to begin with. It was far from as simple as it looked on the surface.

Otherwise, spatial law also would not be called one of the supreme laws.

Inside space, there were layers upon layers. It was a maze in the first place.

Empyrean powerhouses were able to utilize spatial law, but it was just in a more superficial manner.

The truly obscure and difficult to understand areas, they were unable to touch it at all.

And this area of spatial rifts was far more complicated than the outside world. So, when Long Xiao they all hid inside, even if a Heavenly Emperor came, it would also be very hard to find.

A spatial maze was actually a deep layer of superimposed space; fragile and complicated.

Once falling into this layer, wanting to find the way back again would be difficult!

Long Xi chased after Ye Yuan in a sullen rage and actually came into a spatial maze unknowingly.

This was clearly Ye Yuan’s scheme.

They never would have thought that Ye Yuan entering this spatial rift was like a fish entering the sea; knowing everything about it.

But their doorstep became their graveyard.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s figure walked out of a corner. “No need to worry. Very soon ... you guys will be able to go and meet your companions.”

Long Xi looked at Ye Yuan, gritted his teeth, and said, “Brat, do you think that you can trap us like this? This Empyrean tells you, even if it’s a spatial maze, with our understanding of the spatial rifts, as long as we find a familiar plane, we’ll be able to return to the surface layer space!”

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a smile, “When did I say before that I want to use the spatial maze to trap you all?”

Long Xi’s pupils constricted and he said in alarm and anger, “You ... What are you trying to do?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Haven’t you already guessed what I want to do? Spatial ... collapse!”

It was only to see Ye Yuan stomp his feet. Chaos divine essence suddenly erupted. Chaos divine essence that was interwoven in space actually started collapsing layer upon layer.

A tyrannical energy spewed forth without restraint inside the spatial rifts.

Long Xi said in a great rage, “Brat, if you make space collapse, you’ll die in here too!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re thinking too much! How can my understanding of spatial law be what you can imagine?”
