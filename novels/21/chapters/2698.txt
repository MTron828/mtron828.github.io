Chapter 2704: Ten Tigers Seizing the Throne!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In a secret mountain cave, nine fierce tigers were gathered together, each and everyone with a ferocious appearance.

“Old Three, what’s the meaning of calling us here? Where’s Old Sixteen?” The one talking was Bright Tiger King’s fifth son, Shaba.

Bright Tiger King had a total of 16 sons, 6 sons passed away early.

There were still ten alive presently.

Old Three, Hefeng, was the oldest. Old Sixteen, Shuoyan, was the youngest.

Normally, the other nine people were rather amicable toward Shuoyan. But the nine fought among themselves.

Because only one of them could survive in the end!

The law of the jungle was extremely cruel. The ten sons of Bright Tiger King were not as carefree as those second generation young masters of the human territories.

From the moment they reached adulthood, they would have to experience constant killing.

The moment someone among these ten sons ascends to the throne in the future, the others would all have to die! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Of course, many of them would never survive until then.

Survival of the fittest, those who were weak could only be eliminated!

He Feng had a gloomy expression on his face and he said in a cold voice, “Calling you all over this time is for Old Sixteen’s matter! You all were in your own territories and probably still don’t know yet, right? Old Sixteen he has already broken through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!”

“Old Third, are you joking? I met Old Sixten half a year ago. That tiger boy was merely upper Greater Sublime Heaven! He broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum in a short half a year?” Shaba said with a scoff.

“Sigh,

?I say, Third Brother, you got us to come over in a haste, saying that something big has happened. After a long time, it was for this? What’s the deal with this! Even if Old Sixteen really broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, there’s also no big deal, right?” Old Eight said with an unhappy expression.

Among the ten brothers, Hefeng was not the strongest.

The strongest was Old Fifth, Shaba!

The ten of them brothers fought outside all year round, constantly excavating their potential.

And Shaba caught up from behind, his strength surpassing Hefeng instead.

Old Eighth’s strength was about the same as Hefeng’s.

Therefore, he did not hold him in much awe and veneration.

Hefeng snorted coldly and said, “What the hell do you all know! I was summoned by Royal Father this time to search for heavenly medicines. That’s how I coincidentally met Old Sixteen! Do you all know how he broke through?”

Seeing Hefeng’s serious appearance, Shaba’s brows also furrowed together tightly.

Although Old Third’s talent was a little lousy, for him to be able to live until now, he was not some fool.

Something that could make him take so seriously, there might really be something major.

“Stop leaving us hanging! Say it!” Shaba said.

Hefeng recounted the matter of Shuoyan swallowing a true grade heavenly pill, making the eight people present all draw a breath of cold air.

“I’ve already inquired. That human is an extremely powerful heavenly alchemist! He came to Myriad Demons Mountain as a hostage. It’s actually in order to refine a grade four heavenly imperial pill for Royal Father they all, so as to let the five of them break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven! Of course, Royal Father breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven is a great thing. But what’s damnable is that that human heavenly alchemist’s relationship with Old Sixten isn’t ordinary! With his heaven-defying means, if he’s determined to help Old Sixteen, what business has it got to do with us still? Do you all feel that this is a small matter?” Hefeng said with a cold snort.

“Old Third, are you joking? According to what I know, it’s impossible for human heavenly alchemist to be so formidable, right?” Shaba said with a frown.

Hefeng smiled coldly and said, “I didn’t believe it at first either. So I specially went to find Uncle. When that human gave Old Sixteen the heavenly pill to eat, he was there! The five kings watched Old Sixteen break through with their own eyes; can this still be fake?”

The other seven people all drew a cold breath and stopped taunting Hefeng.

The expressions on their faces were different. But clearly, they started to become apprehensive of Shuoyan.

Or should they say, started becoming apprehensive of that mysterious human heavenly alchemist behind Shuoyan!

After a long silence, Shaba suddenly said, “Old Third, what do you think?”

Hefeng chuckled and said, “Calling you all is to discuss countermeasures! Old Fifth, you’re normally the one with the most schemes, you give a plan!”

Shaba’s face turned black, but he did not refute anything and said coolly, “Since Old Sixteen is already an adult, then he also has to take part in the hunt this year, right?”

Hefeng raised his brows and said, “You’re saying …”

Shaba said coolly, “Encountering some accident when hunting is also something that can be forgiven. After all, there will be people breaking through to Jade Sovereign Heaven at any time in this Myriad Demons Mountain. If Old Sixteen dies at the hands of a Jade Sovereign Heaven, I believe Royal Father won’t say anything either.”

But He Feng shook his head and said, “One Jade Sovereign Heaven isn’t enough!”

Shaba frowned and said, “You can’t bring Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses by your side when hunting! Could it be that a Jade Sovereign Heaven can’t take care of Old Sixteen?”

Hefeng said, “I’m worried that that human heavenly alchemist takes action! I exchanged blows with him that day. He has a grandmist treasure in his hands. Moxi was defeated at his hands too!”

“What?! Grandmist treasure! Moxi was actually defeated too?!” Everyone said in shock.

They did not take a heavenly alchemist seriously yet.

After all, no matter how incredible you were at refining pills, there would be no threat after you became a dead person too.

But a heavenly alchemist that rivaled Jade Sovereign Heaven was completely different!

This was equivalent to saying that Old Sixteen had an extremely powerful backer!

Hefeng nodded and said, “This human is unfathomable. If we’re not taking action, then forget it. But since we’re taking action, we absolutely can’t give him any chance!”

Shaba finally understood why Old Third brought them all here.

He could not deal with this alone at all!

“Now that it came to this, everyone should stop hiding! I know that you all have some trump cards in your hands! Show them all this time! I raised a strong contingent in Heavenjoy Mountain. Their leader is the Eight-spotted Leopard that I subdued more than 100 years ago! He’s already middle Jade Sovereign Heaven strength!” Shaba said.

Hefeng nodded his head with a slight smile as he said, “I subdued a Purplelight Battle Wolf 200 years ago. He is also middle Jade Sovereign Heaven now!”

The nine of them had been scheming for a very long time. They naturally had some trump cards.

They had never told anyone about these trump cards. But this time, they took it all out for Ye Yuan.

The other seven each raised a true spirit army. The weakest leader was also at the realm of lower Jade Sovereign Heaven!

Although they were only Limitless Sublime Heavenly Tiger King, Bright Tiger King’s awe-inspiring reputation was still very resounding in the Myriad Demons Mountain.

Some Jade Sovereign Heavens secretly cast their lots with these tiger sons, which was naturally no big deal.

If they gambled correctly, they would render merits with the king in the future!

The nine people agreed that they would send out these nine armies, agreeing to kill Shuoyan.

If Ye Yuan did not go, that was naturally for the best.

As long as Ye Yuan did not help Old Sixteen, he would not have any conflicts of interest with them either.

But if Ye Yuan made a move, they would also dispose of Ye Yuan together.

Even if it made Bright Tiger King lose the opportunity to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven because of this, they would not hesitate either!
