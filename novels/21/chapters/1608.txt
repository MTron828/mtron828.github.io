Chapter 1612 It Then

Regarding Gu Han’s contempt, Ye Yuan thought nothing of it.

“Isn’t Lord Gu Han known as River Eternal Imperial City’s number one genius? Why? You don’t even dare to accept a challenge from me, a mere Three-star Alchemy God?” Ye Yuan said with a light smile.

Gu Han had a proud look as he said, “Not just any random Tom, Dick, and Harry can challenge me! Who I challenged were all Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s first-rate young geniuses. So who the hell do you think you are?”

This Gu Han was arrogant at heart and haughty in manner. The targets that he challenged were not randomly selected, but only challenged after careful inquiry.

It was just that nobody told him that Heavenly Eagle Imperial City still had a terrifying existence.

This existence was already not on the same level as a so-called genius like this.

The moment Gu Han’s words came out, immediately, a strange atmosphere spread out through the crowd.

Ye Yuan gently made a gesture, signaling everyone to calm down.

Everyone immediately understood and quietened down very quickly.

They already saw through that Ye Yuan was deliberately here to slap faces, and that he intentionally gestured to them to not divulge his identity.

Everyone was incomparably depressed these few days. Their geniuses suffered a crushing defeat, now, even the Four-star Alchemy God Song Qiyang was defeated.

More importantly, if they lost, they lost. But the one who lost even had to bow three times to him and even had to say that kind of nauseating words.

Gu Han’s actions already aroused everyone’s feelings of being filled with a common hatred for the enemy.

Ye Yuan taking the initiative now to come out and take care of Gu Han, how could they not be happy? Hence, they became very cooperative.

They all thought very playfully in their hearts that the expression on Gu Han’s face in a while would definitely be extremely wonderful!

You’re a genius?

You are unmatched under the heavens?

Hur hur!

When you witness Elder Ye’s means, you’ll know that your pride is simply a joke.

Ye Yuan was not angry either and said with a light smile, “Whether I have the qualifications to challenge you or not, you ask them and you’ll know. You guys, do I have the qualifications to challenge him?”

Ye Yuan said it to the crowd of onlookers, they were also very cooperative when they heard.

“Ye Yuan is our imperial city’s youngest genius. He naturally has the qualifications to challenge you!”

“If even Ye Yuan doesn’t have the qualifications, then nobody has this qualification!”

“Not daring to accept the challenge, you wouldn’t be afraid of losing, right?”

...

Everyone clamored to get a word in, but nobody revealed Elder Ye Yuan’s identity.

If not saying it out personally, Gu Han wouldn’t believe even if he was beaten to death, that Ye Yuan was actually an elder-class figure.

In the corner building, Ling Zikun laughed in spite of himself and said, “Brother Ruo Xu, your Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s junior disciples already can’t send people out? Even a Four-star Alchemy God was defeated, but to send out a Three-star Alchemy God over, isn’t it simply asking for humiliation?”

Ruo Xu’s face revealed an extremely strange expression. He did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually come forward at this time.

He even thought that Ye Yuan had no interest in this kind of struggle between juniors. He knew that with Ye Yuan’s realm, this level of fighting was merely small squabbles.

But very clearly, Ye Yuan stepping up at this time was the most suitable.

“Ling Zikun, you don’t get cocky too early! This young man is different from the rest!”

How shrewd was Ruo Xu? How could he reveal Ye Yuan’s identity?

This Ling Zikun postured in front of him every day,so he had already had enough of that attitude.

Now that Ye Yuan took the initiative to step forward and slap faces, how could he not help him achieve success?

His conflict with Ye Yuan was also just internal conflict no matter what. But now, people were bullying his own side, so how could he help outsiders?

Sure enough, Ling Zikun had an indifferent look and could not help laughing as he said, “Different from the rest? How different can he be? Among Three-star Alchemy Gods, it’s impossible for there to be someone who’s Gu Han’s match. His strength, you saw it too. What are the chances of winning do you think this unknown kid has?”

Ruo Xu gave a cold snort and stopped speaking.

But he was secretly thrilled in his heart.

Even I am Ye Yuan’s vanquished opponent. But this dog-fart apprentice of yours also want to win against Ye Yuan?

You aren’t even qualified to kneel and lick his shoes!

...

Seeing everyone’s words, combining with the looks when everyone saw Ye Yuan previously, Gu Han already determined that Ye Yuan was likely a rising star in the city.

Except, why did no one tell him that there was still such a young powerhouse after he inquired for so many days?

Could it be that this guy in front of him was the strongest person among the young generation?

However, who cares!

Any young genius could only kneel and lick him too!

“Alright, I’ll give you this opportunity! Same rules, you lose, together with him!” Gu Han said proudly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Done, no problem.”

Gu Han gave Ye Yuan a glance and said coolly, “Don’t say that I’m bullying you. You pick the medicinal pill. Just pick that one that you’re best at because it doesn’t matter to me.”

Ye Yuan pointed at the Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill and said with a smile, “This then.”

Gu Han was taken aback. He even thought that Ye Yuan wanted to pick some easier medicinal pills. He did not expect that this kid actually dared to challenge the Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill.

After being dazed, Gu Han laughed in spite of himself and said, “Kid, do you really know how to refine pills? Could it be that you’re blind? Even your Senior Apprentice Brother Song, a dignified Four-star Alchemy God, nearly failed just now. You, a Three-star Alchemy God, actually want to compete in the Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill with me?”

Song Qiyang did not leave, being said so by Gu Han, his entire person blushed red with embarrassment.

He wished to rush up to the stage and peel this punk’s skin off.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just the Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill, it’s nothing much.”

Gu Han knew that he was very arrogant, but he suddenly discovered that this guy in front of him was even more arrogant than him!

“Yoo, what high-sounding sentiments! Then I want to see whether or not your strength can match your tone!” Gu Han could not help laughing as he said.

The competition started.

The moment Ye Yuan made a move, Ling Zikun’s expression changed.

That kind of Great Dao melody, that skilled to the extreme pill refining technique, was not on the same level as Gu Han at all.

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, refining the Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill was too easy. He only used 20% to 30% strength and it was sufficient to insta-kill Gu Han.

But in Ling Zikun’s view, it was completely not the case. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This ... Could it be that this young man is your disciple? Brother Ruo Xu, you concealed so deeply!” Ling Zikun’s words revealed astonishment and helplessness.

He did not expect that Ruo Xu actually saved his ace in the hole till the end.

Only several dozen breaths passed and Ling Zikun knew that Gu Han did not have any chance of winning at all.

Not even a scrap!

Seeing Ling Zikun’s deflated expression, it was Ruo Xu’s first time laughing so happily in this one month.

Ruo Xu laughed and said, “Heh heh, this old man doesn’t have that blessing and also doesn’t have that strength.”

Ling Zikun said in surprise, “Could it be ... an apprentice of one of those few people?”

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, the strongest were naturally not Ruo Xu and Zheng Qi.

The truly powerful existences normally could not be seen at all.

Hence, Ling Zikun thought of those few straight away.

Ruo Xu smiled and said nothing. He did not answer Ling Zikun.

Merely less than one hour and Ye Yuan was done.

When Gu Han finished refining, he discovered that Ye Yuan was currently looking at him with a look of amusement.

That expression was the exact same as how he looked at Song Qiyang before.
