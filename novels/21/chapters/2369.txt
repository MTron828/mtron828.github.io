Chapter 2375: Space Freeze!

“S-Senior, we’ve arrived!” When Qin Chao saw Ye Yuan pondering, he reminded cautiously.

Ye Yuan came back to his senses, gave Qin Chao a look, and said with a smile, “You’re scared?”

Qin Chao had a look of embarrassment and said smilingly, “A ... A little scared. We’re going all by ourselves, so it’s ... it’s no different from seeking death. I know that Senior is very formidable, but there’s more than just one Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse in the Sentry Celestial Palace! Although I don’t fear death, such a meaningless death is indeed somewhat not worth it.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “You’re right. Dying like this doesn’t have any meaning at all.”

Qin Chao was taken aback and said, “Senior’s meaning is ... not going anymore?”

He was very perplexed, could it be that Senior also shrink back?

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “But who told you that we’re going to court death?”

Qin Chao’s eyes lit up and he said in wild ecstasy, “Could it be that Senior even hide a large army? Haha, what am I saying ... Senior is wise. So how can you possibly do this kind of suicidal stupid thing?”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said, “What army is there? You’re thinking too much. Come on.”

This was a place with extremely rich spiritual energy. A majestic palace was hidden in the clouds, appearing mysterious and having experienced the many vicissitudes of life.

This place was the Sentry Celestial Palace that made all races terrified at the sight of it!

“Stop! Who is it, to dare trespass the Sentry Celestial Palace?”

Several figures suddenly appeared, stopping Ye Yuan two people.

These few people were all middle-stage Heavenly Emperor Realm powerhouses. Except, they were all humans!

Ye Yuan looked at them, his brows furrowing as he said to Qin Chao, “Why would there be humans in the Sentry Celestial Palace?”

Qin Chao looked at Ye Yuan with eyes like looking at a freak and said, “Doesn’t Senior know that many human powerhouses will serve the divine race? In fact, they even become the divine race’s thugs, acting with utter disregard for human life. They are all the human race’s traitors!”

One of them said in a great rage, “Insolence! The divine race is the messenger of heaven, towering above the myriad races! Serving them is something that each race should do! Brat who’s still wet behind your ears, just based on this one sentence, you deserve death!”

Puff!

His voice had yet to fade, and he was already killed by countless streaks of sword light.

There would always be some who would drag out an ignorable existence.

There were always some who would betray their race.

Ye Yuan understood, but he was very upset!

Some things were bigger than dragging out an ignorable existence!

If it were Ye Yuan, he would rather die than be the divine race’s lackey.

When the other Heavenly Emperors saw Ye Yuan attack so viciously, and so powerfully, each and every one of them shuddered with fear.

A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse yelled out at the top of his voice, “You ... You dare to kill people in the Sentry Celestial Palace? Don’t you want to live anymore? Come, men! Somebody wants to rebel!”

His voice instantly spread throughout the Sentry Celestial Palace.

Qin Chao’s expression changed greatly and he cried out in alarm, “Not good! The divine race’s powerhouses have all been alarmed! Senior, let’s hurry up and go!”

But Ye Yuan did not leave and said smilingly, “What are you panicking for? I’m looking forward for them to come!”

It was also just several breaths of time, Qin Chao two people were already surrounded by dozens of divine race powerhouses.

Naturally, there were more of the various races’ Heavenly Emperor powerhouses. Their numbers reached as many as close to 100.

Among them, there were even quite a few who already reached late-stage Heavenly Emperor.

Seeing this kind of horrifying line-up, Qin Chao was frightened until his face turned pale.

He was merely just a puny little Empyrean. How could he have seen before such a horrifying line-up?

Anyone of them stepping forward, just moving a little finger and he would be dead.

An Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm who was wearing beautiful embroidered clothing slowly stepped out of the ranks. Staring at Ye Yuan, he said coldly, “Where did this impudent brat come from, to dare run to my Sentry Celestial Palace to cause trouble, got tired of leaving?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and shook his head and said, “Cause trouble? No, no, no, I’m not here to cause trouble.”

The other party smiled coldly and said, “You killed someone within the confines of the Sentry Celestial Palace, still dare to say that you’re not causing trouble? Dared to kill someone, don’t have the guts to admit it now?”

Ye Yuan curled his mouth and smiled as he said, “I’m really not here to cause trouble. I’m just ... here to destroy the Sentry Celestial Palace!”

The moment these words came out, everyone was stunned.

Soon after, they erupted with a burst of loud laughter.

“He said, destroy the Sentry Celestial Palace! Hahaha, this joke is really hilarious!”

“Where did this kid pop out from? Did he see that we’re bored and specially come to tell us jokes?”

“Destroy the Sentry Celestial Palace! It’s really my first time hearing such a funny joke in so many years!”

... ...

Forget about destroying the Sentry Celestial Palace, even killing a divine envoy, the Ziwei Sect felt like a hole was poked in the sky.

Therefore, the lethality of Ye Yuan’s words could be imagined.

They seemed to have heard the funniest joke in the world, laughing non-stop.

Suddenly, a human powerhouse in the crowd said, “Eh, I seem to have seen that kid beside him before. It’s the Ziwei Sect!”

When Qin Chao heard that, his expression could not help changing wildly.

He thought that he was just a nameless nobody and no one would recognize him at all.

But who would have thought that he was still recognized by someone?

His feelings toward the Ziwei Sect were very deep and did not wish to implicate the Ziwei Sect.

If it was learned by these Sentry Celestial Palace people that he was part of the Ziwei Sect, the Ziwei Sect would surely suffer annihilation!

The divine race in brocade said in a thunderous rage, “Ziwei Sect? Heh heh, what immense gall! After killing these two brats, the Ziwei Sect don’t have a need to exist in this world anymore as well.”

Just as Qin Chao was panicking and at a loss on what to do, Ye Yuan lightly patted his shoulder and said smilingly, “Relax, no one will know that you’re from the Ziwei Sect.”

Everyone was stunned, was this kid stupid?

Everyone already knew, how could no one know?

“Space ... freeze!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Just as everyone was in a daze, Ye Yuan snapped his fingers slightly. Space seemed to be like the surface of water with a layer of ripple oscillating.

Immediately, the expressions of all the divine race and human powerhouses changed wildly!

“Not good, this is space freeze! We ... We can’t traverse through the void anymore!”

Everyone was immensely shocked, the gazes that looked toward Ye Yuan had horrified looks.

They did not think that Ye Yuan actually comprehended spatial law to such a terrifying realm.

The gaze of the divine race member in brocade turned intent and he said in a solemn voice, “Panicking for? Even if he freezes space, can he deal with so many of us by himself? Heh, looks like this is the newly emerged peerless genius of the human race. Killing him will be a great achievement!”

“Yes, Palace Lord!”

The moment everyone heard that this was the case, they immediately put away the looks of alarm and panic. What replaced it was greedy eyes.

This divine race member in brocade was Sentry Celestial Palace’s palace lord, a peak Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse!

This kind of powerhouse, his strength was already not much weaker than Nineorigin’s.

These Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses, Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, were all in a mad rush to be the first, rushing over towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was indifferent, faintly spitting two words out of his mouth again, “Sword, come!”

“My sword! Why ... Why isn’t it listening to orders anymore!” Those powerhouses who used the sword were all horrified.

Their swords actually broke out of their hands involuntarily and flew towards Ye Yuan.

At the same time, the flying swords within the confines of the entire Sentry Celestial Palace all flew toward Ye Yuan.

For a moment, the entire sky was full of sword shadows dancing everywhere.
