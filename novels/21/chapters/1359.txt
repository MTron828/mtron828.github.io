Chapter 1363: Xie Jingyi

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Qin Family and Wang Song kept staring at the Myriad Treasure Tower, trying to wait for Ye Yuan to come out.

But they guarded for half a year and did not wait for Ye Yuan to come out.

After returning from Clearwind Inn, Ye Yuan directly entered closed-seclusion.

Before the entrance examination, Ye Yuan still had to increase his strength quickly.

The more he understood things, the more Ye Yuan felt that this entrance exam was not simple. He felt tremendous pressure too.

Inside the World Suppressing Stele, Ye Yuan was currently comprehending the Vast Heaven Sword Art.

This was the cultivation method that Absolute Heaven comprehended in the World Suppressing Stele. To the Ye Yuan in the past, it was unfathomable.

But now, Ye Yuan created the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, his horizons became goodness knows how many times further. This cultivation method was already no longer suitable for him.

The reason why Ye Yuan studied the Vast Heaven Sword Art was that he wanted to take the merits and create a Sword Dao that belonged to him!

Although the dragon race’s martial techniques were powerful, Ye Yuan had a feeling that his Atavism Dragon Soul had certain limitations too. In terms of sustainability, it might not go further than Martial Dao.

Hence, he still decided to walk on two legs and comprehend laws!

Presently, Ye Yuan’s realm already caught up to laws boundary. His grasp on Sword Dao laws had already stagnated for very long.

A martial technique that was originally extremely powerful in the Immortal Grove World was also just commonplace now.

After all, the disparity between a declined empyrean world and the Heavenspan World was too great.

The Immortal Grove World’s limitations determined the inherent deficiencies of cultivation methods and martial techniques.

All of this forced Ye Yuan himself to improve further.

“Senior, looking at this Vast Heaven Sword Art now, it’s full of flaws!” Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile.

“That is, of course! Although this cultivation method originated from the World Suppressing Stele, the things comprehended is just a single hair from nine oxen. If cultivating according to this method, one’s accomplishments would be limited,” Dustless said.

“My current comprehensions toward Sword Dao laws are too shallow. Even facing the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, I’m unable to create a Sword Dao martial technique that belongs to me too,” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

Only a short while ago, Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao laws reigned supreme in the Immortal Grove World, astounding countless powerhouses.

But now, Ye Yuan was like a toddler staggering along.

Dustless said, “Hence, you entering Wu Meng Academy is the right choice! That place gathers geniuses. There are many cultivation methods and martial techniques left behind by many seniors of older generations for your reference.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I think so too. I hope that Wu Meng Academy’s martial techniques don’t disappoint me.”

Half a year’s time, Ye Yuan already completely grasped the Vast Heaven Sword Art’s first layer.

His Martial Dao boundary had already reached peak middle-stage Grotto Profound as well. He was just missing an opportunity for him to break through the bottleneck. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Deity Realm was a brand new Martial Dao system. Ye Yuan had never experienced it before and was also unable to be like in the past, completely without bottlenecks.

It was just that his Chaos Heavenspan Canon was a rarely seen cultivation method in the whole world. His bottlenecks were a lot easier to break through than others.

Presently, he already faintly touched the threshold of late-stage Grotto Profound and might break through at any time.

On this day, the entrance examination finally began!

“Brother Yang, thank you so much for your care along the way. I’ll thank you here first!” Ye Yuan said to Yang Rui with clasped hands.

Yang Rui chuckled and said, “You punk, also not separated by life and death, being so sentimental for what? Want to thank, I have to thank you too, no? Without you, I couldn’t be a deacon either!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s why you deserve it! Farewell, Brother Yang! Wanru will be entrusted to Brother Yang.”

The entrance examination would last for a very long time. It was not convenient for Ye Yuan to bring Wanru and could only leave her in the Myriad Treasure Tower first.

Yang Rui smiled and said, “You just rest assured, I wish that you don’t succeed!”

Ye Yuan froze, immediately breaking out into laughter.

This guy was still thinking constantly about having him join the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Ye Yuan shattered the jade tablet in his hand, his figure instantly vanishing.

This jade tablet was the token received from Wu Meng Academy after successfully registering.

As long as one shattered the jade tablet, the applicant would automatically be transported into the assessment place.

Wu Meng Academy’s entrance examination often involved tens of millions of people. It was naturally impossible to carry out inside the academy.

Hence, Wu Meng Academy specially opened up a space, to be used to conduct the entrance examination.

As for the matter of registration, the Myriad Treasure Tower had long readied it for Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan just felt his eyes blur, and he arrived at a foreign space.

“This is your number, take the number and find your own lotus seat! Not allowed to start a fight, not allowed to cause trouble. Otherwise, kill without mercy!”

A young man handed him a wooden board, the warning overtone in his words very thick.

Looking at this appearance, he might be Wu Meng Academy’s student.

One could tell from this young man’s eyes, and he was very disdainful toward Ye Yuan.

“Many thanks, Senior Apprentice Brother!” Ye Yuan received the wooden board and thanked him.

The young man snickered and said, “When you pass the entrance exam, calling me Senior Apprentice Brother again isn’t late! Go on, go on!”

In his eyes, it was impossible for Ye Yuan, this middle-stage Grotto Profound rookie, to pass through the entrance examination.

Therefore, he need not be polite.

Ye Yuan just smiled and went to find his lotus seat according to the number on the wooden tablet.

Before his eyes was an enormous plaza, stretching to infinity.

At the plaza, it was densely packed with people, no less than a million, spectacular in sight.

On the wooden tablet wrote 735 horizontally, 521 vertically.

Ye Yuan did not hesitate either, finding his seat very quickly according to the coordinates written on the wooden tablet.

This was a one-square foot lotus seat, formed with array formation illusions, strikingly vivid and lifelike.

Ye Yuan did not hesitate either, directly sitting on it and started meditating.

“Brother, you were also forced by your family to come and be an extra, right?” Suddenly, a little fatty on an adjacent seat started to talk to Ye Yuan.

The hour had not arrived yet. There were still applicants rushing over one after another. Quite a number of people were all whispering into each other’s ears.

When Ye Yuan heard the voice, he could not help turning his head to look.

That little fatty was clearly an easy-going person, and he said with a smile, “I’m Brilliant Peace City’s Xie Jingyi1, uh ... Don’t use this kind of eyes to look at me, I also don’t know why my dad’s head was clamped, giving me such a perverse name. Hey, what’s your name?”

Ye Yuan was tickled by this little fatty and said with a smile, “I’m Ye Yuan.”

“Hear hear, hear hear! What a nice name, unlike me! Sigh! Oh, right, you were also forced by your family to come and be an extra, right?” Xie Jingyi repeated the question.

“Be an extra?” Ye Yuan said in puzzlement.

“Yeah! Your bit of strength, I reckon that you’ll fall on the second day. Not being an extra, it’s for what?” Xie Jingyi said.

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not give any explanation.

Xie Jingyi talked to himself, “Sigh, although I’m that tiny bit slightly stronger than you, I reckon that lasting five to six days is already about there. I said that I wasn’t coming, my damn old man said that he was going to find me Brilliant Peace City’s ugliest wife! My God, isn’t this killing me?”

Ye Yuan discovered that this little fatty was a total joker, purely in charge of running jokes.

“Five or six days? You’re late-stage Grotto Profound at any rate too. It’s not to the extent of just lasting so few days in Heaven’s Might, this round, right?” Ye Yuan said curiously.
