Chapter 3000: Call ‘Grandpa’ Three Times!

“Mn??What’s Ye Yuan doing?”

“What he’s holding in his hand seems to be Dragonsand’s blood, right?”

“Dragonsand is already completely dead. What is he holding his blood for? It can’t be that he can still revive, right?”

… …

With regards to Ye Yuan’s actions, everyone felt very perplexed.

With Dragonsand dead, there was no idea how much blood in his body that was scattered all over the place.

Yet, Ye Yuan ran so far away to get a drop of blood and even placed a restriction.

How baffling!

But Mi Zhen was extremely enraged in his heart.

Just now, he put on a look of heartache and headache. It was merely just putting on a show, that was all.

Dragonsand was not dead at all!

Of course, it was true that he killed Dragonsand.

In front of so many Hegemons, it could not be faked as well.

But in reality, Dragonsand was just seriously injured and did not completely die.

His essence, energy, and spirit were all merged into a drop of fresh blood.

He killed Dragonsand by blowing him up. There was blood everywhere. Nobody would pay attention to the direction that a single drop of blood essence had gone to.

Dragonsand was a Supreme Hegemon. Furthermore, he was just a tiny bit away from Great Beyond Realm.

This kind of subordinate, how could Mi Zhen possibly give him up so easily?

Therefore, the two of them joined hands, carrying out this scheme that deceived everybody.

Who knew that this blood essence was just about to escape when it was seized by Ye Yuan.

The Hegemon Realms all over the sky did not even detect it. So how could he tell?

Mi Zhen was going crazy!

He had killing intent aroused and wanted to kill Ye Yuan very much.

With his strength, killing Ye Yuan was merely a matter of a thought.

Yet, he could not!

Killing Ye Yuan at this time now was tantamount to telling everyone that he was the main culprit behind the scenes!

Doing so would be equivalent to alienating himself from the dragon race. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It was true that he was the dragon race’s progenitor. But wanting to actualize his ambitions, he needed the entire dragon race as the backing.

He could not do it alone!

Otherwise, with how the Chaos Bloodstone was extremely strong, there was completely no need to create a blood race to help him attack cities and seize fortresses.

Ye Yuan had calculated this as well. That was why he would take action.

Otherwise, he would rather let Dragonsand go.

Ye Yuan was different from Long Ran. He never believed Mi Zhen from start to end.

Therefore, he had always remained vigilant, especially after Mi Zhen ‘killed’ Dragonsand.

Then, Ye Yuan detected a trace of undulation.

The undulation of blood origin!

Dragonsand becoming strong naturally could not do without the blood race’s support.

He remoulded his bloodline. It would definitely leave behind the aura of blood origin.

Very unfortunately, Ye Yuan had a trace of the origin of chaos blood!

And this trace of origin was even stronger than Mi Zhen!

He grabbed Dragonsand like he was pinching onto Mi Zhen’s vital point.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan returned in an instant. After consuming a grade seven heavenly pill, his injuries were already more than half-healed.

“Ye Yuan, what are you doing?” Long Ran said with a frown.

Ye Yuan played with that drop of blood essence in his hand and said with a smile, “If I say that he’s Dragonsand, you all definitely won’t believe it.”

Long Ran could not help laughing and said, “Ye Yuan, you’re oversensitive! Progenitor’s arcane eyes are exceedingly formidable. How can Dragonsand possibly hide from him? This drop of blood is merely a drop of ordinary dragon blood. That’s all.”

Yes, this drop of blood essence looked exactly identical to ordinary dragon blood.

Ye Yuan looked at Mi Zhen with a smile, looking like he was taking credit for someone else’s achievements.

Mi Zhen found it really unpleasant to the eye.

However, got to admit, Dragonsand’s mental strength was very strong.

Even until now, he was not willing to reveal a hint of flaw too!

This drop of blood was calm like water.

“Ye Yuan, this progenitor is Great Beyond Realm. With Dragonsand’s bit of strength, he can’t hide from this progenitor! Just a drop of ordinary dragon blood. You’re thinking too much, Ye Yuan!” Mi Zhen said reluctantly.

He never suspected Ye Yuan because Ye Yuan’s level was too far from him.

Of course, he admitted, Ye Yuan was very impressive.

“Kid, this seat knows that you like to be in the limelight. However, you’ve already shown off a lot too. This kind of method to talk big to impress people, don’t take it out. You are questioning my dragon race’s progenitor!” Long Jian said in a solemn voice.

“Goodness gracious, what a severe crime! But I said before too. I’m a divergent cultivator! I even dare to question heaven, so let alone Progenitor? In this world, I only believe in myself!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Impudent! A measly little Emperor Cloud Heaven actually dares to be so condescending!” Long Jian said angrily.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a smile, “It’s not that I’m condescending, but that you’re very silly and very naive. Don’t you forget how Dragonsand schemed against you all! A cunning rabbit has three nests. Do you think that he’ll really die so easily?”

Long Jian smiled coldly and said, “Just a drop of ordinary dragon blood, that’s all. You say that it’s Dragonsand and it’s Dragonsand?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then why don’t we play a game? If I prove that it’s Dragonsand, you call ‘grandpa’ three times, alright? If I lose, I’ll kneel down to Progenitor and apologize, and I’ll destroy my Dao heart!”

Long Jian’s expression turned somber, very surprised in his heart.

This boy was actually betting his Dao heart. Could it be that there was really a problem?

But even Progenitor clearly could not see through this thing!

“Why not!” In the end, Long Jian still chose to trust Progenitor.

He did not believe that Dragonsand could hide from Progenitor!

It was just that he did not know that Dragonsand and Progenitor were in cahoots to begin with!

He was destined to lose this bet.

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said to Feng Qingxuan, “Hey, lend your nirvanic rebirth fire! After roasting, we’ll know the truth.”

Mi Zhen’s heart thumped. This brat had such vicious means!

Nirvanic rebirth fire could burn all things in the world. It was one of the most powerful means of the phoenix race.

Under the grilling of such blazing fire, Dragonsand would definitely reveal his true colors!

Normally, Feng Qingxuan’s meager strength naturally could not do anything to him.

But he was only left with a drop of blood essence now and was weak to the extreme.

Otherwise, he would not have been directly grabbed by Ye Yuan too.

Mn,?this was all thanks to Mi Zhen.

Mi Zhen regretted it to the extreme now. If he knew long ago, he would have gone easy just now.

Leave Dragonsand with some vitality, and he could have escaped from Ye Yuan’s hands too.

But, in order to make things authentic, he directly struck ruthlessly.

Feng Qingxuan’s beautiful eyes stared, and she said with a cold snort, “I’m not called ‘hey’! Also, is this your attitude of asking people for help?”

Seeing that Ye Yuan was about to turn around and directly ignore her, she hurriedly said, “Hand it over! You’re really petty!”

Boom!

The terrifying nirvanic rebirth fire instantly ignited.

Dragonsand’s endurance was indeed incomparably strong.

Over 15 minutes passed, Dragonsand’s blood essence did not stir at all.

Long Jian smiled coldly and said, “Is that the Dragonsand that you’re talking about? Kid, one must be willing to lose if they bet. Kowtow to Progenitor and atone for your crime!”

“Enough, boy! It ends here! In this world, there’s nothing that can escape this progenitor’s arcane eyes!” Mi Zhen finally could not hold back and spoke up.

Right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

Pah, pah, pah?…

Crackling sounds emitted from the nirvanic rebirth fire.

Amidst the flames, a hoarse yell came over,?“ARGHHHH!?Little brat! Ye Yuan, this seat can’t coexist with you under the same sky! Proge …”

Pah!

A force fired out. The blood essence was directly blown up.

Dragonsand’s remnant soul was directly obliterated by Ye Yuan!

At the final juncture, he wanted to ask Mi Zhen for help, but Ye Yuan could not let him call out.

Once Mi Zhen was exposed, the consequences would be too terrifying.

Therefore, he killed Dragonsand right away!

Then he looked at Long Jian and said with a smile, “How about that? Want to concede defeat and call ‘grandpa’ three times for me to hear?”
