Chapter 1954: Wariness

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The people present all had deep connections with Ye Yuan.

All these years in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, Ye Yuan’s name had long spread far and wide.

Many major forces far and near all came to find Ye Yuan to refine medicinal pills in the past.

It was also because of this that Ye Yuan became acquainted with quite a few True God Realm powerhouses.

After all, the Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses who could request Ye Yuan personally to refine pills were already not many.

And this time, Ye Yuan found some reliable True God Realm powerhouses and borrowed the power of the Myriad Treasure Tower, utterly removing the ticking time bomb that was buried around him in one stroke.

This was what was powerful about alchemists!

The alchemist themselves might not be strong, but they would have many powerful friends.

Once someone provoked them, the consequences were too ghastly to imagine.

Moreover, Ye Yuan was currently Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder.

This identity did not just represent the Myriad Treasure Tower but the embodiment of his strength.

Being about to overpower a group of old monsters and become the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder, no one would doubt Ye Yuan’s strength.

Duan Yi smiled and said, “Elder Ye is too courteous! I investigated it just now, this Shadowwind has quite a lot of good stuff on him. Eliminating him, we also benefited a lot!”

Nine Pledge Branch plundered quite a lot of natural treasures these few years.

The vast majority of them were all on these True God Realm powerhouses.

Completely annihilating them this time, these True God Realms could naturally obtain considerable benefits.

Ye Yuan had long promised them that these things; he would not take a single cent, all of them being given to these True God powerhouses.

“Huhu, this is what everyone deserves! This Ye knows that by attacking the Deathsoul Gate, everyone also bore significant pressure. So this time, this Ye also strove to do things cleanly. After today, hope that everybody stays tight-lipped. Just take it as nothing happened. As for the aftermath of this incident, this Ye will bear the responsibility alone!” Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said to everyone.

Everyone had slightly somber expressions, all secretly sighing that Ye Yuan was loyal enough. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Concerning the Deathsoul Gate’s might, they were too clear.

The reason why they dared to take action against the Deathsoul Gate was primarily still because Ye Yuan’s plan was flawless. The Deathsoul Gate would not know that they crushed one of their branches.

If it was really known that they did it, no matter how many lives they had, it also would not be enough for the Deathsoul Gate to take vengeance on.

Directly exterminating such a powerful branch of the Deathsoul Gate, the implications of this matter was huge.

Deathsoul Gate’s actions afterward were hard to predict.

Other people, they might not be able to investigate. But the first to bear the brunt would naturally be Ye Yuan.

If the Deathsoul Gate really struck a vicious blow against Ye Yuan, he would definitely find it hard to ward it off.

It was just that Ye Yuan took an unusual approach and caught the Nine Pledge Branch in one fell swoop. This would give the Deathsoul Gate a tremendous shock and make them not dare to rash act against him.

A branch being eradicated, this was something that had never happened before to the Deathsoul Gate.

Duan Yi cupped his fists toward Ye Yuan and said, “Elder Ye’s high morality reaching the clouds, we’ve long heard of it. This Deathsoul Gate’s matter, we won’t be hypocritical either. We’re indeed scared of their vengeance. It’s just that this way, Elder Ye and the Deathsoul Gate’s discord will be considered sowed. Better to be a little more careful in the future.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Relax, this Ye has a score in my heart.”

Duan Yi nodded his head and said, “Now that it’s settled, we’ll each leave. In the future, if Elder Ye has any errands, feel free to instruct us.”

Done talking, everyone dispersed on their own.

Returning to Heavenly Eagle, Ye Yuan ordered Zuo Shujie to execute the five Deathsoul Gate assassins in public, to hold a memorial ceremony for the civilians who died in vain.

Toward this, the civilians naturally clapped their hands in joy.

In the city, there were cheers everywhere. People’s support for Ye Yuan even reached its peak.

The news of the Nine Pledge Branch being destroyed reached the Deathsoul Gate very quickly.

Inside a certain great imperial capital’s City Lord Manor, a man in black knelt down in front of a middle-aged man in luxurious clothing.

This middle-aged man had a deep and imposing aura, it was even more unfathomable than True God Realm powerhouses.

This person was shockingly an Empyrean Realm powerhouse!

No one would have expected that this city lord was actually a member of the Deathsoul Gate!

The black-clothed man was filled with righteous indignation as he said, “Lord Bloodrain, the Nine Pledge Branch’s strength ranks near the top among the various major branches. A branch being destroyed is unprecedented humiliation to our Deathsoul Gate! We must eliminate this Ye Yuan!”

The Nine Pledge Branch was the territory that he was in charge of. The Nine Pledge Branch being silently destroyed made him extremely alarmed and furious.

They were alarmed, questioning what kind of power would actually destroy the Nine Pledge Branch without a sound.

Fury was that this matter was a huge provocation to their Deathsoul Gate.

That middle-aged man stood with his hands behind his back, but his expression appeared very calm and he just said coolly, “This matter ends here.”

The black-clothed person trembled all over, his face revealing a look of disbelief as he said, “Lord Bloodrain, drop ... dropping it just like this? The Nine Pledge Branch had more than 10 True God Realm powerhouses!”

True God Realm powerhouses were backbone existences to any faction.

The time and resources needed to groom a True God Realm powerhouse were simply unimaginable.

Unless it was some Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda’s peerless geniuses, otherwise, wanting to reach True God this realm, it required at least several tens of thousands, even several hundreds of thousands of years.

More than ten True God Realm powerhouses added together, how great were the Deathsoul Gate’s losses?

It was simply immeasurable!

This black-clothed person wished to eat Ye Yuan’s flesh raw right now.

But Lord Bloodrain said to drop the matter!

Bloodrain said coolly, “This matter, I’ve already reported it to the higher-ups. They also said that this matter, it was indeed our intel that was wrong. The faction behind Ye Yuan might be powerful until we can’t imagine it. We can’t provoke him! Otherwise, the implications are too great!”

The black-clothed person had a look of unwillingness as he said, “Forget about those initial-stage True Gods, but the Nine Pledge Branch had an Eighth Firmament True God, two Seventh Firmament True Gods, and five Sixth Firmament True Gods. Could it be that ... they died in vain?”

“Our Deathsoul Gate is a tall tree that catches the wind to begin with. The major forces eyeing us are not few. If people are gone, they can be groomed again. But once the implications get too big, it will shake the entire Deathsoul Gate’s foundation. Can you bear the responsibilities?” Bloodrain said in a solemn voice.

The black-clothed person trembled all over and could not help falling silent.

Bloodrain continued, “Being able to destroy a high-order branch without a sound, you think about it; how powerful the strength it requires?! Before investigating the faction behind Ye Yuan clearly, you’re not to touch him. Understood?”

Wiping out a branch’s den and eradicating the entire branch, the difficulty level of the two could not be mentioned in the same breath.

In the history of the Deathsoul Gate, there had also been many times when branches were exposed and wiped out.

It was just that the Deathsoul Gate’s means were extremely seasoned. Even if the den was annihilated, there were very few powerhouses that were exterminated.

Even if they were exterminated, there was also just one or two, maybe even three or four.

But this time, more than ten True God powerhouses were all wiped out. Not even a single Celestial Deity Realm assassin escaped.

A faction capable of accomplishing this, one could not even find more than a few in the entire Heavenspan World!

Furthermore, this battle did not have any traces or inkling spread out. How Shadowwind they all died, no one knew about it.

This kind of terrifying means, even Bloodrain felt terrified thinking about it.

Continue to find trouble with Ye Yuan?

What difference was there from courting death?
