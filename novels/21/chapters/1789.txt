Chapter 1793 Those Who Find It Hard Don“t Know, Those Who Know Won“t Find It Hard

After three days of rest and recuperation, the disciples taking part in the examination were all full of high spirits, returning to their peak states once more.

Deacon Hong turned in the direction of the sect and directly bowed down.

“Shadowmoon Sect disciple, Hong Xiao, respectfully invites the Jadelight Drum!”

While talking, Deacon Hong took out a small flag, poured divine essence into it, and directly plugged it into the void.

Rumble!

The void immediately emitted intense tremors, rumbling sounds lingering on incessantly.

Amidst everyone’s shock gazes, a huge drum slowly emerged from the void.

“Argh! My ears!”

“I ... I can’t hear anymore!”

The humming sounds that the huge drum emitted shocked until everyone’s eardrums hurt.

Those slightly weaker ones even directly spewed out a mouthful of blood, their internal organs already injured.

“This ... is the melody of Great Dao!”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up as he marveled a little.

Regarding this kind of mysterious feeling, Ye Yuan was not foreign to it.

Back then when he preached on Dao at the fiend race, he had once triggered Great Dao Heavenly Melody. The sound that this Jadelight Drum gave off achieved the same wondrous effect with different means.

It was just that the Great Dao Heavenly Melody that Ye Yuan triggered belonged to Alchemy Dao.

While the Jadelight Drum’s melody of Great Dao was extremely aggressive. Clearly, it was a Dao with extremely strong offensive power.

Ye Yuan was secretly startled in his heart and said, “Looks like this Shadowmoon Sect is indeed extraordinary. This Jadelight Drum should be a top-level true god mystic treasure, its power unimaginable. Just the slight aftermath of the vibrations of the drum surface have such power.”

Toward this kind of Great Dao melody, Ye Yuan accepted it calmly.

But Baili Qingyan and the rest secretly revolved divine essence, blocking this impact.

Gradually, the Jadelight Drum’s vibration noises subsided. Everyone immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Deacon Hong’s gaze swept over everyone slightly and said majestically, “The people who vomited blood just now can leave.”

Those people who vomited blood were all incomparably depressed, but they could only leave helplessly.

“I’ve long heard that the Jadelight Drum’s power is boundless, but I didn’t expect that it’s actually so terrifying!”

“If it’s unleashed, probably even Celestial Deity powerhouses can be instantly killed too, right?”

Regarding the Jadelight Drum’s power, these people were all extremely shocked too.

After those people left, Deacon Hong continued slowly: “Now, the second round assessment begins. No matter what method you all use, as long as you can make the Jadelight Drum sound out, it’s considered passing the assessment. People who pass the assessment will become my Shadowmoon Sect’s inner-disciple. People who fail will become miscellaneous affairs disciples. If you aren’t willing to become a miscellaneous affairs disciple, you can also leave. However, this old man warns you all first, live within your means! Your attacks, the Jadelight Drum will return it with several times the force. It might directly collapse your physical bodies.”

Deacon Hong’s words made the group of disciples feel slightly alarmed.

This Jadelight Drum’s power was seriously too terrifying.

Striking the drum without cultivation attainments was equivalent to seeking death.

“Alright, now, you all cast spells in reverse-order according to the results of the first round assessment,” Deacon Hone said in a clear voice.

The first one to take the field was a very lean guy.

Only to see him leap up, arrive in midair. Beckon his hand, a metal rod came into his hands.

“Limitless Astral Cudgel!”

The lean man brandished the metal stick and smashed over toward the Jadelight Drum.

Bang!

Only to hear a scream, the Jadelight Drum did not sound out, but his right arm that gripped the stick directly exploded into pieces.

When Duan Qinghong saw this scene, he said scornfully, “Heh, really foolish! Does he think it’s beating an ordinary drum? Choose a metal rod and it can sound out?”

When Han Yong saw this scene, his expression changed slightly too and said to the Ye Yuan beside him, “Fine lad, that kid just now, his strength wasn’t weak. He’s actually crippled just like that?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “What this Jadelight Drum tests isn’t strength, but comprehension toward Dao. Using brute force will only accomplish the very opposite. The stronger the brute force, the greater the countershock-force. He only had one arm crippled, it’s considered light already. If you went up, your entire person would probably explode into nothing.”

Han Yong chuckled and said, “I wouldn’t be as stupid as him.”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “There’s naturally no problem with your passing the test. But, it’s impossible for you to want to win Zhao Zhao.”

Han Yong’s expression choked up, involuntarily revealing an aggrieved look.

Their Thundercloud Sect and the Devil Elephant Sect are sworn enemies. Han Yong and Zhao Zhao were also lifetime enemies.

It was just that no matter how hard he worked, he kept on being unable to surpass Zhao Zhao.

This had always been his heart knot.

“Ye Yuan, don’t smack the face when hitting people, don’t rake up one’s shortcomings when picking on people. You being like this, you make me very depressed!” Han Yong said gloomily.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’ll teach you a move that can let you overpower Zhao Zhao, what do you think?”

Han Yong’s eyes lit up and he said excitedly, “For real? You don’t fool me. Otherwise, we won’t be brothers anymore.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Fool you for what? This round is as easy as turning my hand over to me.”

The moment these words came out, not just Han Yong, even the Yang Fan by the side also revealed skeptical looks.

The two of them did not know Ye Yuan’s stunning performance in the Shadowmoon Mountain Range and naturally did not know Ye Yuan’s true strength.

“Ye Yuan, these words are a bit too conceited, right? Even though you got first place in the first round, this second round’s Jadelight Drum, even to the first place, it’s absolutely not easy too.” Yang Fan said.

These words were said veiledly, but actually, it was saying that Ye Yuan actually took advantage of people in the first round, and was not a true winner.

How your strength was, did you not have any score in your heart?

Blowing your own trumpet here, why didn’t you take a piss and look at your reflection as well?

Ye Yuan did not refute, but said to Han Yong with a smile, “If you trust me, I’ll teach you. If you don’t believe, then forget it, take it as I didn’t say anything.”

Han Yong’s expression flickered incessantly. Honestly speaking, he was a little skeptical.

But overpowering Zhao Zhao was also his long-cherished wish of many years.

Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and said, “Brother, you say, I believe you!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and whispered a few words in Han Yong’s ear.

When Han Yong heard, his face could not help revealing a dubious look as he said, “So simple? Can it work?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said with a smile, “Those who find it hard don’t know, those who know won’t find it hard. This round’s assessment isn’t as difficult as you imagine.”

Han Yong’s face revealed a strange look and could not quite make up his mind for some time.

At this time, the test was also progressing in an orderly manner.

But up to this point, not a single person passed yet.

Some people also did not dare to go all out when they saw those in front getting injured.

Slam!

Finally, when more than 40 people took the field, someone sounded the Jadelight Drum for the first time.

It was just that this sound was as soft as a mosquito’s buzzing. Whether or not it was counted as sounding, was also hard to say.

“Ding Yuan, tier zero! Pass the test!” At this time, Deacon Hong said in a clear voice. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Clearly, Deacon Hong could decide the ranks of the people who passed the test through that small flag.

Tier zero could virtually be ignored.

But being able to do it to this step was also indeed not easy.

The people who took part in the test at the back, those who passed also gradually increased. But the vast majority were all tier zero or tier one.

All the way until the top 100, only then did a tier two disciple appear.
