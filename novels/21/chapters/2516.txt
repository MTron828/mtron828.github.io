Chapter 2522: Wordless Heavenly Skill!

Mission Hall, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

An old man was currently lecturing three disciples.

“Jun Tian’s life tablet has already shattered. You all go to Eastward Country to check it out properly. See who has such gall to dare provoke our Jadetrue Heavenly Sect! Cheng Chongshan, you’re the senior apprentice brother. This trip will be led by you,” the old man said.

Cheng Chongshan cupped his fists and said, “Elder You can be rest assured. This disciple will definitely investigate carefully. If I find any clues, I’ll definitely make him pay the price of blood!”

Elder You nodded slightly and said, “The three of you, this elder naturally feels relieved. Jun Tian’s strength is top-notch in Eastward Country too. There aren’t many people capable of making him die. This elder reckons that this matter probably has something to do with the royal family. Do you all know what to do after you go to Eastward Country?”

Cheng Chongshan’s eyes flickered and he said with a nod, “Elder, rest assured. This disciple understands! In the tiny land of Eastward Country, those few people are merely a bunch of clay chickens and pottery dogs. I reckon that they also can’t stir up any waves!”

Cheng Chongshan three people set off for Eastward Country with the sect’s mission.

It was just that they did not think that Jun Tian, this big shot who could make Eastward Country tremble thrice with a stomp of his feet, actually died in Ye Yuan’s hands!

… …

Ye Yuan closed the Jadetrue Anecdote and exhaled a turbid breath deeply.

Following that was a deep fury.

It turned out that this Heavenspan Mountain was accidentally obtained by Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s former sect master, Yan Jadetrue.

By borrowing this treasure, Yan Jadetrue rarely had any rivals, his strength exceedingly formidable.

Jadetrue Heavenly Sect also became the overlord-level sect of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s Five Great Heavenly Regions because of it.

It was just a pity that later on, Yan Jadetrue encountered a formidable enemy later on, and suffered serious injuries.

His treasure, the Heavenspan Mountain, was also seriously damaged in this battle.

In order to nourish the Heavenspan Mountain, Yan Jadetrue sealed it in a small chiliocosm with a great magical ability, nourishing the Heavenspan Mountain with the power of the entire small chiliocosm.

This small chiliocosm was the Heavenspan World!

It was just that later on, no idea why, Yan Jadetrue went missing, and the Heart of Heavenspan disappearing with him too.

Without the Heart of Heavenspan, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect could not find traces of the Heavenspan Mountain.

Later, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect had once swarmed out in full force, searching for the whereabouts of the Heavenspan Mountain.

It was just a pity that the place the Heavenspan Mountain was sealed, only Yan Jadetrue alone knew about it.

Jadetrue Heavenly Sect expended a great price and failed to find the whereabouts of the Heavenspan Mountain too.

This was the origin of the Heavenspan World.

Reading finish the Jadetrue Anecdote, Ye Yuan had unspeakable fury.

Whatever Dao Ancestor, whatever Heavenly Dao Samsara, it was all merely a game set by Yan Jadetrue.

For tens of billions of years, the Heavenspan World’s powerhouses have all been living in the shadow of Yan Jadetrue.

It was also fortunate that Yan Jadetrue went missing. Otherwise, the current Heavenspan World would likely have long ceased to exist.

Nourishing a precious treasure like this with the price of a world’s living things, the method could be rated as cruel.

If it succeeded, everything in the Heavenspan World would no longer exist, and naturally there would not be the Ye Yuan today as well.

It was just that no one expected that many years later, the Heavenspan World was actually found by an outer-sect deacon, Jun Tian.

However, Jun Tian did not report this matter to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

He knew that the Heavenspan Mountain was a treasure. If he could obtain it, his fate would be totally different.

If he reported it to the sect, it would have nothing to do with him anymore.

Unfortunately, without the Heart of Heavenspan, Jun Tian could not take the Heavenspan Mountain away.

Standing guard over a treasure mountain, but could not take it away, Jun Tian had been depressed these few years.

He had once infiltrated into the Heavenspan World countless times in an attempt to find the whereabouts of the Heart of Heavenspan, but could not find it.

Of course, with his strength, sneaking into the Heavenspan World without a sound, it was simply impossible for the Heavenspan World’s powerhouses to discover it.

Helpless, he left behind the legacy of the Eight Extreme Divinities in the Heavenspan World, attempting to collect divine soul essence to cultivate origin divinity.

After reaching Heavenly Stratum, the cultivation of origin divinity was extremely important.

The higher the origin divinity realm, the greater the speed of comprehending heaven and earth, and the easier it was to increase one’s cultivation realm.

Of course, origin divinity realm was not so easy to increase.

However, Jun Tian never dreamed that the Heart of Heavenspan which he searched bitterly for changed hands several times, and landed in Ye Yuan’s hands in the end.

Furthermore, he even successfully refined the Heart of Heavenspan and took away the Heavenspan Mountain.

But Jun Tian himself died under the Heavenspan Mountain in the end!

Ye Yuan’s gaze was deep as he muttered to himself, “I absolutely can’t let Jadetrue Heavenly Sect discover the Heavenspan World. Otherwise, the consequences will be too ghastly to contemplate. Although the current Jadetrue Heavenly Sect is already far worse than before, a starving camel is still bigger than a horse. The strength of a sect isn’t what the current me can contend with.”

The Heavenspan Mountain was a treasure that could let the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect rise once again.

Once Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s people discovered it, the Heavenspan World’s days would also come to an end.

Ye Yuan held his palm out, the Heavenspan Mountain suspended on his palm quietly.

“Wordless Heavenly Skill! Yan Jadetrue relied on this cultivation method back then to command the Five Great Heavenly Regions! I wonder if I can comprehend it or not!” Ye Yuan looked at the Heavenspan Mountain and said to himself.

It was recorded in the Jadetrue Anecdote that an astonishing cultivation method was hidden on the Heavenspan Mountain called Wordless Heavenly Skill!

This cultivation method was wordless!

Want to comprehend it, you could only rely on comprehension ability and lucky chance!

And this cultivation method could only appear after the Heavenspan Mountain and Heart of Heavenspan combines into one.

However, Ye Yuan did not comprehend it immediately but concealed the plane passageway with array formations.

Then, he disposed of Jun Tian’s dead body before leaving carefully.

Ye Yuan had traveled for several months, but could not find the way out at all.

Inklight Forest was too large, he did not know where to go at all.

He did not encounter any danger along the way.

In these few months, Ye Yuan studied the Heavenspan Mountain carefully while traveling, attempting to find the Wordless Heavenly Skill.

It was just that, sadly, it was too difficult!

However, what Ye Yuan did not lack the most was patience.

If not for his persevering spirit, he also could not have walked until today.

On this day, Ye Yuan was currently studying the Heavenspan Mountain when suddenly, he heard noisy quarreling sounds.

He was overjoyed in his heart and hurriedly put away the Heavenspan Mountain. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Finally saw a living person!

“Junior Apprentice Sister Xuezhen, you rest assured, the Yang Family’s matter is my, Lu Yuanjie’s matter! Your father’s grudge, Senior Apprentice Brother will definitely avenge for you!” A young man’s voice could be heard.

Another man said, “Junior Apprentice Sister Xuezhen, that Li Family’s Li Batian is nothing! With me, Gui Tianyu around, I’ll definitely make him unable to bear the consequences!”

At this time, a weak and sad woman’s voice transmitted over in a drawn-out manner.

“Many thanks for two senior apprentice brothers taking pity on me, Xuezhen is deeply grateful!”

“Huhu,?Junior Apprentice Sister Xuezhen, those words regard me too much as a stranger.”

“Eh,?there’s actually someone in this wilderness?” Lu Yuanjie’s eyes were sharp and saw Ye Yuan with one glance, and said in surprise.

Gui Tianyu sized Ye Yuan up and said with a snicker, “Didn’t even reach lower Lesser Sublime Heaven, this kid can actually survive in Inklight Forest until now. What a tenacious life! Hey, brat, you’re a Lower Realm’s ant that just ascended to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, right?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. This guy was actually as disgusting as Jun Tian!

He originally still wanted to follow this group of people and leave Inklight Forest. Now, he could not even be bothered to talk anymore.

When Gui Tianyu saw Ye Yuan ignore him, his expression could not help turning dark. He said in a cold voice, “Punk, this young master is talking to you! Are you deaf?”
