Chapter 1639 The Fallen Genius

“Elder Ye, you’re back?” Ye Yuan just entered the inner-city and ran into Lin Dong with a few friends. Lin Dong smiled as he greeted Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance, slightly nodded his head, and walked by, and did not have the intention of responding to him.

Lin Dong was verbally respectful, but his face did not have any hint of respect at all.

On the contrary, his face was full of mockery and gloating over others’ misfortune.

His few friends were the same as him, their faces being full of disdain.

Seeing Ye Yuan ignore him, Lin Dong smiled coldly and said to his friends, “Being cocky for what? Does he still think that he’s that genius elder? Can’t even break through to the Divine Lord Realm, and yet to also dare proclaim himself to be a genius. Truly laughable!”

“Heh heh, can’t break through to the Divine Lord Realm, whatever genius he is, simply dog fart!”

“I heard that there are already rumors upstairs, saying to abolish his position as an elder! Heh, once it becomes true, that will be avenging grievances if there are, taking revenge if there’s grudge!”

“He still thinks that he’s the imperial city’s upper echelon figure, putting on airs in front of us!”

“Hahaha!”

...

These people talked very loudly and did not have the intention of avoiding Ye Yuan at all.

Clearly, they did not think anything of Ye Yuan, this elder, anymore.

In a twinkle, 300 years had already passed since returning from the Fiend Calling Ridge!

During these 300 years, Ye Yuan had attempted no idea how many methods, but he still could not find the key to creating the fourth layer cultivation method.

This door was seemingly thoroughly shut for him.

Ye Yuan visualized the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, attempting to break through with Alchemy Dao, but he gained nothing.

After even going for closed-seclusion he could not find the way, Ye Yuan frequently went out alone to train and even refined a void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill to consume.

But all of the efforts were akin to a rock sinking into the ocean, not having any effect at all.

Back then, Ye Yuan coming roaring into existence shocked the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. Even the Celestial Deity powerhouses upstairs made an exception and promoted Ye Yuan to Pill Tower elder.

For some time, it was incredibly shocking.

Everyone would not doubt that Ye Yuan would become a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse very soon!

However, same as how everyone could not imagine Ye Yuan’s terrifying strength, they also did not think that Ye Yuan was unable to break through to the Divine Lord Realm for 300 years.

To a mediocre talent, 300 years to break through to Divine Lord Realm, that was a normal phenomenon.

But to Ye Yuan, 300 years were far too long!

Keep on failing to break through to Divine Lord Realm, there were naturally some voices that called for an inquiry concerning him within the city.

Especially when Ye Yuan was a large tree where the winds howled around the highest peaks, practically everyone’s eyes were fixed on him.

Now, this kind of questioning voice, they were currently getting stronger and stronger. Therefore, that was why Lin Dong they all dared to disregard Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan had just returned from training outside and heard the news that they were going to abolish his elder position.

He believed that this was not a groundless rumor, otherwise, Lin Dong would not dare to be so arrogant as well.

However, he did not mind.

The position of elder might be extremely respected to others, but to him, he did not have much hesitation to leave the post.

His horizons would never stop on the position of a measly elder.

Regarding Lin Dong their provocation, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to care as well, leaving straightaway.

But when Lin Dong they all saw Ye Yuan remain silent, they even thought that Ye Yuan was scared, and became even more brazen.

They actually chased next to Ye Yuan and continued to ridicule.

“Goodness me, our great genius Ye actually fled in disgrace! Hahaha ...”

“We, these mediocre talents, already broke through to the Divine Lord Realm. But Elder Ye who’s called the number one genius is actually unable to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, really making people die of laughter!”

“Heh, the imperial city let him be elder because they were certain that he could break through to the Divine Lord Realm. But now, it seemed like people at the upstairs misjudged the person!”

...

Everyone was just talking when a powerful aura suddenly descended. An old man suddenly appeared on the streets, using an icy-cold gaze to look at Lin Dong and the rest.

Lin Dong and the rest seemed to have dropped into ice, their words abruptly ceasing. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“A-Ancestor!” Lin Dong and the rest said stammeringly.

“Scram!” Coldfeather said in a cold voice.

“Y-Yes, Ancestor!”

Lin Dong and the rest did not expect that Coldfeather would actually show up here and were frightened until they wet their pants in terror, escaping like flying.

Coldfeather looked at Ye Yuan and said in anger from failing to live up to expectations, “You’re at any rate a Pill Tower elder too. How can you allow these bastards to bully freely?”

In these 300 years, Celestial Deity Realm seemed to have been enlightened, breaking through all the way to half-step Celestial Deity Realm. It was truly thick accumulations erupting.

Now, Coldfeather’s status in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City naturally rose along with the general situation.

Coldfeather did not like these mundane affairs. But presently, Zheng Qi was half-dead, so Coldfeather took up the responsibility of the Martial Tower’s affairs.

This world was realistic. One should not look at how Coldfeather’s seniority was high. If his realm kept on remaining stagnant and did not advance, he would only be flaunting his seniority. No one would care about him at all.

But now, there was naturally no one who dared to underestimate him.

Ye Yuan looked at Coldfeather and said with a smile, “Isn’t it said that my position of elder is about to be gone?”

Coldfeather froze, heaved a sigh, and said, “You keep on being unable to break through, so it’s hard to shut everybody’s mouths! This matter, this old man also strongly opposed it, but those two fellows also had their concerns. You shouldn’t blame them.”

Ye Yuan knew those two fellows in Coldfeather’s words were Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s two Celestial Deity powerhouses.

These two people, one had even higher seniority than Coldfeather, the other was in the same generation with Coldfeather.

This was Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, so it was naturally their words that counts the most.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “What’s Brother Coldfeather saying? Being an elder is good; being a mortal is fine too. They are merely empty titles. If cultivators of my generation don’t have strength, everything is naturally empty talk.”

Coldfeather was rather surprised at Ye Yuan’s reaction. He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so open-minded.

One had to know, the resources that elders enjoyed were not what ordinary people could compare to.

To martial artists, what was the most important?

Wasn’t it still cultivation resources!

Coldfeather let out another sigh and said, “I really don’t understand, talent like yours is absolutely the number one person in accomplishments that surpasses ancient and modern times. Even if you break through to the True God Realm in the future, even the Empyrean Realm, I don’t find it the slightest bit strange! But you keep failing to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, it really perplexes me!”

Coldfeather knew that the predecessor who comprehended second-layered heaven spatial laws, his strength was already unimaginable at present.

Ye Yuan only used 100 years and comprehended second-layered heaven laws, his talent was absolutely not beneath that predecessor’s talent!

However, why was he unable to break through to the Divine Lord Realm?

Opening up a small world might be impossible to achieve for life to others, but to Ye Yuan, it should be effortless!

According to Coldfeather’s opinion, Ye Yuan should have broken through within 50 years.

But over 300 years had passed. Ye Yuan still did not have any improvement.

Therefore, he could not understand it no matter how he thought about it.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The cultivation method that I cultivate is a little special, breaking through requires an opportunity. This opportunity keeps not on coming, so I’m unable to break through from beginning to end as well.”

Coldfeather’s expression was ugly as he said, “Really no idea what kind of cultivation method, to actually be so freakish. Even a genius like you isn’t able to break through! Forget it, there will be an elders meeting three days later. Some people are probably going to make a fuss about your matters. You’d best be more careful.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just an elder position. It’s not a big deal.”
