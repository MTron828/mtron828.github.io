Chapter 1560 Helping You Teach Disciples

The Silvermoon Pointstar Pill’s refinement difficulty is considered as medium difficulty. It was slightly easier than the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill.

With Xuan Yu’s strength, it did not require too much time.

After four hours plus, the Silvermoon Pointstar Pill was done. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Feng praised him. “Master Xuan Yu is indeed worthy of being the Pill Tower’s Second Elder. This Universe Transfer Hand is truly transcendent! This Silvermoon Pointstar Pill, the lousiest is probably superior-grade too, right?”

Xuan Yu chuckled and said, “This old man has put on an incompetent performance. I wonder what Master Ye thinks about it?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Barely passable I guess. Some minute details are still not on point enough yet. But divine-grade should be just about enough.”

Xiao Feng listened until the muscles on his face twitched heavily. To dare appraise Master Xuan Yu like this, there was probably just Ye Yuan, right?

But Ning Siyu smiled playfully and said, “Master, he criticized you until you were utterly worthless just now! According to what he said just now, you were more than a tiny bit off. It’s simply that you don’t know how to refine pills!”

Xuan Yu’s eyes glimmered and he said, “Oh? What did Master Ye say just now?”

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth twitched. He was just explaining for her and Xiao Feng to listen just now.

Xuan Yu was, at any rate, an alchemy master and still had to have face. He did not expect that this girl was so tactless, saying it out to his face.

Ning Siyu did not hide it either, repeating Ye Yuan’s words once.

The more Xuan Yu listened, the more solemn his expression got.

Reaching his realm, his understanding of alchemy was naturally not what the average person could compare to.

Even Xiao Feng was akin to a child in front of him.

But some details that Ye Yuan said, they were all something that he had never paid attention to before.

Some understanding regarding Dao, he was actually unable to fully comprehend it!

But with his experience, he could naturally distinguish whether Ye Yuan said it correctly or not.

He was certain that refining according to Ye Yuan’s method, the quality would definitely attain greater heights!

Even though reaching divine-grade, this kind of level, the improvement in quality was negligible, the effect was heaven and earth!

The Dao Realm was actually so dreadfully appalling?

This Silvermoon Pointstar Pill was his specialty medicinal pill. He did not expect that there were actually still so many areas missed out.

“Master Ye is indeed well-deserving of being a Dao Realm master, able to recognize the whole through observation of one small part! This old man has been taught by you!” Xuan Yu said.

Ye Yuan raised his eyebrows and said with uncertainty, “The Dao Realm?”

Xuan Yu was surprised as he said, “What, could it be that you actually don’t know your realm?”

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “I broke through by chance. But regarding this realm, I’m completely clueless. Senior please resolve my doubts.”

Xuan Yu could not help being speechless. He did not even know about the Dao Realm and he could actually even break through.

But thinking about it, that made sense too. Ye Yuan’s level, unless he was an apex major power’s disciple, otherwise, how could he possibly know about the existence of Dao Realm?

Straight away, he did not conceal it either. Xuan Yu explained Dao Realm for Ye Yuan to hear.

After Ye Yuan listened to it, he finally understood his current realm.

It seemed like when he re-cultivated Alchemy Dao and used the Ten Directions Heaven Seizing Art, it was already very close to the Dao Realm.

Through his experience in the Heavenspan World, he finally broke through while being at the fiend race’s territory

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “Thank you, Senior, for resolving my doubts. It’s my turn to refine the Silvermoon Pointstar Pill. Please don’t laugh at my performance.”

But Xuan Yu stopped Ye Yuan and said, “Master Ye, wait a moment.”

Ye Yuan said in puzzlement, “What is it?”

Xuan Yu said, “It’s almost time, they should have arrived.”

Right then, the shopkeeper came in to report that four young men came outside.

Bringing them in and taking a look, Ning Siyu nearly jumped up: “Eldest Senior Brother, Second Senior Brother, Third Senior Brother, Fourth Senior Brother, why have you all come?”

When Ye Yuan saw this lineup, how could he still not understand? He could not help smiling bitterly and said, “Senior, you’re borrowing comparing of notes to have me help you teach disciples!”

Eldest Senior Brother’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “Teach disciples? A mere Three-star Alchemy God actually dares to boast so shamelessly!”

“Master, your status is noble. How can you spar in pill refinement with a Three-star Alchemy God?” Third Senior Brother said.

“Master, you made us come to watch a Three-star kid refine pills? This ... Isn’t this wasting time?” exclaimed Fourth Senior Brother.

Only Second Senior Brother sized Ye Yuan up and down and did not say anything.

But his eyes were also full of suspicion.

It was true that Ye Yuan was too young. He was really unable to imagine that such a young man could refine the divine-grade Gale Celestial Stone Pill!

Xuan Yu billowed his beard and said with a cold snort, “The few of you, following this old man these years, you’ve already become somewhat condescending! Even Master has to show some respect towards Master Ye, but you guys actually dare to be disrespectful towards him?”

The four apprentice brothers’ faces could not help changing when they saw Master get angry. Each and every one of them turned silent.

But their faces had a big ‘not convinced’ written on it. Even a fool could see it.

These apprentice brothers four people, the eldest senior brother and second senior brother were both Four-star Alchemy Gods. Third senior brother and fourth senior brother also both reached peak Three-stars and could break through at any time. How could they possibly be convinced by Ye Yuan?

When Xuan Yu saw their expressions, he was still about to fly off the handle but was stopped by Ye Yuan who said with a smile, “Senior, the ignorant is not to be blamed. You made Four-star Alchemy Gods come and watch a Three-star Alchemy God refine pills, anyone would feel indignant in their hearts.”

“Heh, at least you have self-awareness!” Eldest Senior Brother said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said with a smile, “How about this, I won’t force you guys either. I’ll compete in ten pill formulas with your master. If I have a medicinal pill’s quality lower than your master’s, I’ll kowtow and apologize for my offense toward you all, alright?”

“Wildly arrogant!”

“Ignorant!”

“Ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth!”

Ye Yuan’s words made the four people explode all at once.

Even Xuan Yu himself also slightly revealed a look of surprise on his face.

This kid was so confident!

He knew that the Dao Realm was formidable, but just how formidable, he had not seen it before.

It was precisely because the Dao Realm was hard to come by that he would call several apprentices to come and observe and study.

These ten pill formulas were all carefully selected by him, each harder than the last.

Men all made mistakes, horses would stumble. This kid was so confident in himself?

“Hehe, I approve! I approve! Master Ye, teach my senior apprentice brothers a good lesson! Let them know what’s called heaven beyond heaven, and that there’s always someone better!” Ning Siyu craved for the world to be plunged into chaos and clapped her hands gleefully.

Eldest Senior Brother’s face turned black and he said unhappily, “Little Junior Sister, just whose side are you on, to actually help an outsider!”

Ning Siyu stuck her tongue out and said, “I’m naturally on Master’s side. But it’s really very hard for Master to want to win against Master Ye!”

Ye Yuan just smiled and said to Xuan Yu, “Senior, open the furnace!”

Xuan Yu’s palm shook, the Silvermoon Pointstar Pill flew out. It was shockingly a divine-grade!

When Eldest Senior Brother saw the divine-grade Silvermoon Pointstar Pill, he immediately smiled coldly and said, “Saw that? This is true strength! Master already refined a divine-grade Silvermoon Pointstar Pill. I want to see how you are going to surpass him! A mere Three-star Alchemy God, truly ignorant to the max!”

“Kid, sprained your tongue talking big, right? Directly kneel down and kowtow then!” Third Senior Brother also said.

But Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Who told you guys that divine-grade can’t be surpassed?”
