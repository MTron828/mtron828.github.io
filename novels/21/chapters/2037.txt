Chapter 2041: Dual Dragons Reappearing!

A desolate-like aura spewed forth from Empyrean Pilljade’s body.

This aura was stronger than everyone’s previously, including Ye Yuan.

Facing Empyrean Pilljade was like facing the Heavenly Dao.

That kind of ever-constant changes of the world, that kind of changes in season, was displayed in its entirety at this moment.

“This is Ancestor Realm?” Ye Yuan looked at Empyrean Pilljade and said ponderingly.

This was the pinnacle realm of alchemists, the peak of Alchemy Dao!

Even Ye Yuan also yearned immensely for this kind of realm.

Empyrean Pilljade reached his hand out and beckoned. A pile of rank seven spirit medicines instantly turned to grains of powder and flew into the empyrean spirit treasure. An incomparably solid yellow light ball gradually spread out, enveloping over toward Empyrean Flutterfeather.

“This is Empyrean Pilljade’s Lingxiao Heaven Transformation Art. Legends have it that when cultivated to the limit, it can refine the firmament; capable of doing anything. Seeing it today, it indeed lives up to its reputation.”

“Well-deserving of being the Southern Border’s number one Alchemy Dao person. This kind of strength simply makes people unable to give rise to the courage to battle! Empyrean Flutterfeather was too impulsive, even if he stepped into Ancestor Realm, how can he possibly be Empyrean Pilljade’s match?”

“This is the Ancestor Realm? Indeed extraordinary! I feel like my Alchemy Dao is akin to an ant in front of him.”

...

Forget about the Southern Border, even in the entire Heavenspan World, someone in the Ancestor Realm was also a very rare existence.

Even to those Seven-star Alchemy Gods, they rarely see Ancestor Realm powerhouses take action too.

There were even many Seven-star Alchemy Gods who had not seen Empyrean Pilljade take action before.

Empyrean Pilljade being an Ancestor Realm powerhouse, he himself was a legend.

But today, the legend actually took action in front of everyone!

Everyone stared at Empyrean Pilljade without moving their gazes, fearful of missing any detail.

This kind of experience was extremely valuable to everyone.

“Flutterfeather, you’re asking for humiliation by challenging this Empyrean! Don’t you forget as well, once you lose, Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital will have to offer up 50% of the medicinal pills share!” Empyrean Pilljade said with a cold smile.

“Relax, this Empyrean naturally won’t repudiate a debt,” Empyrean Flutterfeather said coolly.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, somewhat uncertain what it meant.

He originally thought that this was just an ordinary Alchemy Dao sparring. Looking at it now, it was not the case.

“Brother Purplewing, wonder what they are talking about means?” Ye Yuan asked Empyrean Purplewing.

Empyrean Purplewing smiled bitterly and said, “This is a long story. This Cloudpill Summit is indeed the superb place for alchemists to interact. But it’s also an important venue to carve up profit!”

It turned out that the seven great holy lands’ masters formed a Southern Border Alliance, and Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital claimed the seat of alliance chief because of Empyrean Pilljade.

These seven great peak holy lands divided up more than 70% of the Southern Border’s medicinal pills and spirit medicine trade.

One had to know, medicinal pills and spirit medicines were hugely in demand among martial artists, the profits being tremendous.

Especially to holy lands that possessed powerhouses in the grand completion Dao Realms, their statuses were impregnable.

The seven great holy lands agreed back then to take the Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital as the head.

Between holy lands, if they wanted more territory and share, they would battle it out in the Cloudpill Summit.

However, Empyrean Pilljade’s status was transcendent, and he had always commanded the six cities with the identity of alliance chief.

Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital also occupied 40% of this 70%, while the other 60% were divided up by the other six parties.

Concerning the territorial division of the six great holy lands, they could only use 10% of their own each time as the wager. The victor gained 10%, the loser lost 10%.

But because the other six parties had similar strengths, after many Cloudpill Summits, the six parties’ strengths were actually still more or less the same.

Logically speaking, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s strength was the greatest and Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital’s territory should be the most. But Empyrean Pilljade frequently hammered Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital with the status of alliance chief. Hence, Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital’s share was a little lesser than the other five parties instead.

It was also precisely because of this that Empyrean Flutterfeather was still quite resentful toward Empyrean Pilljade.

However, wanting to challenge the alliance chief, one had to use 50% of their own share as the wager. This was a massive transaction.

If won, Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital would soar to the sky with one leap, becoming the alliance chief. Cloudpill Summit would also change names to Lustrous Gold Summit.

If lost, Myriad Treasure Tower’s share in the Southern Border would reduce greatly.

Only after hearing this entirely did Ye Yuan know that there were still so many methods to profit during this Cloudpill Summit.

“Sure enough, everyone comes swarming in for profit; everyone goes running everywhere for profit. It turns out that this Southern Border’s territory has long been divided up!” Ye Yuan said with an emotional sigh.

He finally understood why Empyrean Pilljade would target him.

Two grand completion Dao Realm grandmasters appeared in the Myriad Treasure Tower. Furthermore, it was a grandmaster that could break through to the Ancestor Realm like him. The pressure on Empyrean Pilljade was too great!

Empyrean Realm Pilljade smiled bitterly and said, “Yeah! Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda stands aloof from worldly things. The ones truly operating in these secular affairs are still the various great imperial capitals. And the status of an alchemy holy land is comparable to the other great imperial capitals, even a notch higher. However, I still feel that Brother Flutterfeather is too rash! Even if he broke through to the Ancestor Realm, he’s likely not Pilljade’s match too!”

“Huah!”

Purplewing’s voice had yet to fade when two dragon roars shot to the sky, incurring a wave of exclamations!

That was right, it was two.

Two divine dragon phantoms intertwined and crisscrossed, producing an incomparably strong undulation.

Once the aura rose, it was actually not the slightest bit weaker than Empyrean Pilljade!

Two great Ancestor Realm powerhouses went blow for blow, not giving an inch.

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s aura was actually standing up to Empyrean Pilljade as equals!

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he could not help laughing.

“Huhu, Brother Purplewing rest assured. This match, Brother Flutterfeather will definitely win!” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

This scene in front of him, Ye Yuan was extremely familiar. Wasn’t it the scene of him battling with Empyrean Flutterfeather in alchemy back then?

But this scene before his eyes was much weaker than the alchemy battle back then.

This was not that Empyrean Flutterfeather’s strength was weak, but that the resonance the two of them triggered at that time was too strong!

Ye Yuan and Empyrean Flutterfeather’s resonance was absolutely not one plus one equals two that simple, but a certain strong chemical effect that was produced.

This kind of intense resonance even surpassed Ancestor Realm!

One had to know, the medicinal pills that the two of them refined, in the end, were both end spirit divine pills!

End spirit divine pills, even the Ancestor Realm Empyrean Pilljade could not refine it at all too.

Empyrean Flutterfeather clearly obtained tremendous inspiration in that battle, that was how he broke through to the Ancestor Realm in one stroke.

Furthermore, by relying on this dual dragon power, even though he just entered the Ancestor Realm, his strength did not lose to Empyrean Pilljade in the slightest. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Empyrean Pilljade’s expression was extremely ugly. He completely did not expect that Flutterfeather, this newbie who just entered the Ancestor Realm, would actually be so strong!

Those two dual dragons added radiance and beauty to each other as if weaving a massive cage between heaven and earth, causing tremendous pressure to Empyrean Pilljade.

Two great Ancestor Realms having a fierce struggle while evenly-matched, vying with each other, it lasted for a full three days’ time.

During these three days, the air of the entire Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital was surrounded by auspicious omens. With light radiating everywhere, the scene was incomparably gorgeous.

“Condense!”

“Condense for me!”

The two great Ancestor Realms also cried out in unison, the condensing of the pill was successful!

Everyone held their breaths, impatiently wanting to see the result of this battle.

The five great holy lands’ masters walked up to the platform at the same time and opened the furnaces to examine the pills.

“Empyrean Pilljade, vast spirit divine-grade!”

“Empyrean Flutterfeather, vast spirit divine-grade!”
