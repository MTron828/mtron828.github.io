Chapter 3105: Fated Battle!

Everyone’s gazes looked toward Zhuo Bufan.

Clearly, they were all curious about how Ye Yuan did it.

Zhuo Bufan did not explain right away, but the sword intent in his body surged to the sky!

Mi Tian’s gaze flickered, and he said, “This guy is finally going to have a battle with Ye Yuan! I didn’t expect that this day would come so quickly!”

Everyone was in shock. Hegemon Bufan was actually going to have a battle with Heavenly Saint Ye?

Zhuo Bufan was a Supreme Hegemon!

“Got to be kidding! Although Heavenly Saint Ye is formidable, it’s also impossible to be Hegemon Bufan’s match, right?”

“What’s Hegemon Bufan trying to do? Bully people?”

“They are clearly going to determine the victor with Sword Dao. But Hegemon Bufan’s Sword Dao also belongs to an extremely strong existence among Supreme Hegemons! This is clearly bullying people!

…..

Many people revealed indignant looks. Clearly, they did not understand why Zhuo Bufan was challenging Ye Yuan at this time.

If Ye Yuan had used the Heaven Trampling Five Steps, he might not be unable to have a battle with Zhuo Bufan.

But clearly, Ye Yuan would not use it.

No matter how strong Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao was, his cultivation realm was not there yet after all. It was simply impossible to be Zhuo Bufan’s match. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Regarding everyone’s questioning, Zhuo Bufan clearly ignored it.

But Mi Tian said, “You haven’t said it. What did you understand?”

Zhuo Bufan’s gaze was slightly intent as he said, “Ye Yuan’s sword is the sword of guarding! I won’t offend people unless I’m offended! If people offend me, I’ll surely cut them down with the sword! His sword is only drawn to protect people; hence, that was why he sealed his sword intent! But, once enemies came to invade, his sword’s sharp edge would definitely be unsheathed!”

Mi Tian said with a sudden realization, “So that’s how it is! Therefore, his sword intent spurred the thoughts of the people who had died, sealing their wills in the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List! Countless people’s will, setting Great Dao into motion too; that’s why it caused such a huge commotion. It was letting Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven defy heaven and change its fate! Because this place here is precisely the soil that they used their lives to protect!”

Zhuo Bufan nodded slightly. Clearly, Mi Tian’s words hit the mark!

Cultivators were powerful. The thoughts of people who had just died would not dissipate into heaven and earth.

Therefore, Ye Yuan spurred those thoughts with sword intent to protect Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven together!

Zhuo Bufan said, “He’s going to break through! The battle between us is finally coming!” His gaze flickered.

Before his voice faded, Ye Yuan’s brush stroke fell heavily, finishing the last name!

Following that, the aura on his body rose rapidly!

In remolding Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List pulled in large amounts of Eternal River chaos. It was perfect for Ye Yuan’s breakthrough.

Boom!

Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm directly reached grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven!

Arriving here, it abruptly stopped!

His cultivation realm could no longer rise further.

The next step would be to confront that terrifying Dao tribulation!

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said, “Have I finally come this far?”

“Ye Yuan, come and fight!” Right then, a voice sounded out.

Ye Yuan looked over and said with a smile, “Brother Zhuo, our battle has finally come!”

Zhuo Bufan said, “This Zhuo cultivates the sword. It’s only to seek to have a clear conscience! But Honorable Brother Ye cultivates the sword to protect all life under heaven! I’m inferior!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Dao is just the means. The key lies in the heart! Brother Zhuo overcame the raging tides with your power alone. It’s similarly protecting all life under the heavens! It’s just that the means are different, that’s all! Brother Zhuo doesn’t have to be modest!”

Zhuo Bufan’s gaze flickered, seemingly somewhat comprehending.

Ye Yuan leaped up and faced Zhuo Bufan from afar and said smilingly, “Come on! I’ve looked forward to this battle for a long time already!”

Zhuo Bufan laughed loudly and said, “Haha, come and fight!”

After he was done talking, a sword emerged. Everyone was shocked!

Zhuo Bufan’s sword pressed forward indomitably, the power formidable until it made people give birth to fear in their hearts.

This sword revealed its sharp edge. Coupled with his Supreme Hegemon strength, it made many people’s expressions change.

They all looked at Ye Yuan worriedly, somewhat doubting whether or not he could block this sword.

After all, the gap between the two people’s realms was seriously too great!

Bloodpromise was the blood race’s genius, but Zhuo Bufan was an unrivaled human race genius!

One sword breaking through three realms, this was absolutely not what the average genius could achieve.

“Bring it on!”

Ye Yuan howled, sword intent similarly surging on his body.

It was only to see him tap the void, and saint force poured out crazily. It actually formed a round shield!

Zhuo Bufan’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in shock, “The sword has no constant form! It looks like you’ve really had a grand awakening!”

This buckler looked like it was completely unrelated to the sword.

But Zhuo Bufan was immersed in Sword Dao all his life. So how could he not understand that this buckler was totally a sword!

No one stipulated that the sword must be a sword.

Water had a variety of forms; soldiers had no fixed formation!

Everything came from the heart!

What Zhuo Bufan’s sword heart pursued was this Dao!

But he had not taken this step yet.

When he took this step, he would be able to break through to Great Beyond Realm.

This showed that Ye Yuan had actually already surpassed Zhuo Bufan in Sword Dao origin!

Boom!

The buckler collapsed with a loud bang. Ye Yuan was sent flying too, but he was fine.

“Sword, come!”

Ye Yuan’s saint force spat wildly and actually directly condensed into a sword, counterattacking Zhuo Bufan.

Zhuo Bufan raised his sword to block and resolved it easily!

Above the void, two kinds of sword intents were crisscrossing, going back and forth.

Emperor Sakra Heaven and Supreme Hegemon were actually locked in a struggle!

From below came a series of exclamations.

“How formidable! A-Actually fought to a draw!”

“How is this possible? Heavenly Saint Ye just broke through a minor realm, and he’s actually able to stand up to a Supreme Hegemon as an equal already!”

“Hegemon Realm is really monstrous! If he breaks through to Hegemon Realm, he should be able to have the power to contend with the blood race’s Progenitor!”

…..

Only then did they understand why Zhuo Bufan wanted to challenge Ye Yuan.

If he still did not challenge, Zhuo Bufan would never have the chance anymore!

The current Ye Yuan already had the capital to fight with Supreme Hegemons.

If Ye Yuan could break through to the realm of Hegemon, Zhuo Bufan would completely not be Ye Yuan’s match anymore.

At that time, what would be the point of fighting?

“Motherf*cker, the gap between I, Hegemon Azuresky, and this guy is getting bigger and bigger! When can I challenge him again?” In the crowd, Yang Qing could not resist cursing.

Breaking through to Hegemon Realm, he originally thought that he could suppress Ye Yuan.

Who knew that Ye Yuan’s combat power could actually rival Peak Hegemons already!

Now, Ye Yuan could even have a fight with a Supreme Hegemon!

Furthermore, it was even a top powerhouse like Zhuo Bufan.

Although he was bold, he had a sense of powerlessness when facing Ye Yuan too.

Some people, no matter how hard you worked, you were unable to surpass them too!

Feng Qingxuan looked at him disdainfully and said, “It’s impossible for you to surpass Ye Yuan in this lifetime!”

Yang Qing said unhappily, “Don’t you forget. It’s a huge hurdle for this guy to break through to Hegemon Realm! He absolutely won’t dare to break through to Hegemon Realm within a short time! Therefore, this is my best time to surpass him!”

Feng Qingxuan’s beautiful eyes flickered, but she fell silent, her face revealing a look of worry.

What Mi Tian and Yi Xue felt previously made her somewhat worried.

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Everyone only saw two afterimages fighting soul-stirringly above the void.

Suddenly, the two people separated upon contact.

This great battle abruptly stopped!

It was only to see Zhuo Bufan’s both eyes tightly shut, the sword intent on his body growing stronger and stronger, virtually going to shatter the firmament!

Behind him, the Door of Eternal Life appeared.

Mi Tian stroked his beard and said, “Not bad, not bad! Our Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven is going to have one more Great Beyond powerhouse!”
