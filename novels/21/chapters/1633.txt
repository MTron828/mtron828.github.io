Chapter 1637 Avenging the Great Enmity

“Gao Yuan, get out for me!” Zheng Qi yelled furiously.

His move succeeded just now, blasting Gao Yuan flying.

But who knew that this guy rolled on the ground and disappeared!

Zheng Qi knew that this guy was just hiding nearby. But no matter how he searched, he could not find Gao Yuan’s traces too, and could not help burning with anxiety.

The time left for him was not much, once his body was overwhelmed, he would be incomparably weak.

At that time, he could only be at other people’s mercy.

Zheng Qi felt that his life force was flowing away little by little. His body was also gradually weakening, losing his earlier bravado.

He secretly hated his incompetence, to actually fail to grasp such a good opportunity.

Zheng Qi knew that he could not stay anymore, otherwise, he would be counter-killed by Gao Yuan.

He gritted his teeth, his figure moving swiftly, retreating towards the way he came.

But right at this time, Gao Yuan suddenly appeared ahead, blocking his path.

“Heh heh, weren’t you going to kill me? In a hurry to leave for what?” Gao Yuan smiled at Zheng Qi wickedly and said.

The moment Zheng Qi saw Gao Yuan, he could not help being greatly enraged, immediately lifting his sword and attacking, saying furiously, “I’ll see where you run!”

Who knew that he had just moved and Gao Yuan’s figure flashed, disappearing once more.

Zheng Qi’s expression changed. He finally realized that Gao Yuan was deliberately wasting time with him.

But realizing it was no use either. Ever since entering this terrain, he could not find Gao Yuan’s figure anymore.

Gao Yuan’s concealment means were very strong, Zheng Qi could not find him at all.

Zheng Qi urged his speed to the extreme, wanting to shake Gao Yuan off. But at this time, he and Gao Yuan seemed to have reversed. Gao Yuan followed like a shadow, but also did not come into contact with him.

Suddenly, Zheng Qi’s head went dizzy, his feet staggering, nearly falling to the ground.

A hint of a hideous grin flashed across the corners of Gao Yuan’s mouth, throwing out a palm, swift like lightning.

Bang!

Zheng Qi was struck flying out sidewards, fresh blood spurting wildly.

At this time, zheng qi’s longevity and blood essence were burned too much and was already very weak. The injuries before also broke out again, his entire person virtually unable to move.

When Gao Yuan saw this, he grinned hideously and said, “Zheng brat! Fighting with this old man, you’re still a little too inexperienced! Even Wu Xingtang couldn’t beat this old man, how can you possibly beat me?”

Zheng Qi spewed out a mouthful of blood and gritted his teeth and said, “Despicable!”

Gao Yuan laughed loudly and said, “Despicable? Heh heh, the victor becomes king and the loser a bandit! Wu Xingtang wasn’t despicable enough, so he had long already turned into dirt. This old man is despicable, and now, I’m Utmost Peace Imperial City’s head elder! And now, you’re also going to be like that damn master of yours, disappearing into thin air! Hahaha!”

The current Zheng Qi could not muster up any strength at all.

He knew that he was going to die.

Gao Yuan laughed ferociously and smacked a palm toward Zheng Qi.

Suddenly, Gao Yuan’s expression changed drastically, a feeling of immense danger welled up in his heart.

Instinctively, Gao Yuan used the last of his strength and moved a little to the side.

Rumble!

A black mountain suddenly fell from the sky, shocking until the entire abyss was reverberating.

“Ahh! My leg!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Immediately after, a shrill scream reverberated throughout the entire abyss.

Gao Yuan clutched his thighs, large beads of sweat seeping out of his forehead, wailing incessantly.

He dodged in time, avoiding his vitals. But the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain’s falling speed was too fast, he still could not avoid it completely, directly having both legs crushed.

At this time, his both legs were already completely gone. An intense pain transmitted over, making him virtually going to asphyxiate.

He desperately urged divine essence, wanting to recover his fleshy body, but it was no use at all.

The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain’s origin magnetic laws were too strong, not giving him the chance to recover at all.

Ye Yuan slowly walked out, gave Gao Yuan a cold glance, and said indifferently, “No bad eh. Your reaction is pretty fast!”

Gao Yuan looked at Ye Yuan in horror, his complexion pale, drawing a cold breath.

“You ... How can you be so fast?” Gao Yuan said in horror.

In his view, Ye Yuan should still be refining the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain at this time. How could he possibly refine the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain so quickly?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “That isn’t what you should worry about. What you should worry about right now is how to repay your debt!”

Gao Yuan’s expression was very ugly, the gears in his head turning at high speed, wanting to escape the present desperate situation.

“I ... I wanted to save my life too! Zheng Qi he ... he went mad, insisting on killing me!” Gao Yuan gritted his teeth and said.

Ye Yuan came to Zheng Qi’s side, looked him over, and his brows knitted together tightly.

“Head Elder, you were too reckless! Taking revenge isn’t done by playing with your life. What’s the point of mutual destruction?”

As Ye Yuan said, his fingers tapped rapidly, stopping Zheng Qi’s life from continuing to flow away.

But Zheng Qi’s face had a look of relief at this time as he said, “You ... You don’t know, Master’s debt of gratitude to me is as heavy as a mountain! This time was a once-in-a-lifetime good opportunity. I ... I don’t wish to miss it. You don’t have to trouble yourself anymore. I know my body, it’s hopeless! You ... You take revenge for me!”

Ye Yuan took out several medicinal pills and stuffed them into Zheng Qi’s mouth, saying coolly, “With me around, you can’t die! Taking revenge this sort of thing, you naturally have to do it yourself for it to feel awesome!”

The medicinal pills entering the abdomen, a warm flow quickly surged up. Zheng Qi’s spirit immediately improved significantly.

Zheng Qi said in surprise, “H-How can rank three medicinal pills have such medicinal effects?”

He was incomparably shocked in his heart. With his current realm, he was totally immune to rank three medicinal pills.

But Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills actually worked on him!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What’s given to you were all void spirit divine-grade medicinal pills, replenishing essence and nourishing the qi. Although it can’t let you completely recover, there shouldn’t be major problems for the time being.”

Not far away, when Gao Yuan saw this scene, he was beyond shocked.

Void spirit divine-grade medicinal pills were virtually legendary existences. Ye Yuan actually took out a big pile in one go!

Using rank three divine pills to suppress the injuries of a rank four powerhouses, only Ye Yuan dared to do so. Only he could do so.

Gao Yuan was incomparably in despair inwardly. Both his legs were utterly crushed, his entire person’s aura feeble to the extreme.

However, his desire to live was extremely strong. He did not wish to die here.

Hence, he used both hands to crawl, wanting to escape from here.

But Ye Yuan did not care about him at all and said to Zheng Qi, “How is it? Can you stand up?”

Zheng Qi lifted his head and looked at Ye Yuan as he nodded and said, “Yeah!”

Ye Yuan smiled, helped Zheng Qi up, and slowly walked over towards Gao Yuan.

Seeing Gao Yuan’s miserable appearance, Zheng Qi was extremely delighted in his heart.

“H-Haha, old fogey, you didn’t expect for this day to come, right? Over 60 thousand over years! I’ve already waited more than 60 thousand years for this day!” Zheng Qi endured the pain and said with a big laugh.

Gao Yuan had a look of despair as he exclaimed, “Y-Younger Brother Zheng, I was wrong! I ... I beg you to let me go!”

Zheng Qi sneered and said, “Let you go? Then who will let Master go?”

Ye Yuan handed the Junyi Sword to Zheng Qi’s hands. Zheng Qi looked at Ye Yuan gratefully, the long sword suddenly glided by.

Puchi!

Gao Yuan’s pupils gradually enlarged, his life rapidly flowing away. He finally ceased breathing.

Zheng Qi’s tears coursed down his old face as he looked up to the sky and cried bitterly, “Master, did you see it? This disciple ... finally avenged you!”
