Chapter 1702 Extreme Light Imperial City

Presently, several years had already passed since the 500-year-agreement.

But, no matter whether it was Li-er, Lu-er, or White Light, there was no news.

So these few years, Ye Yuan was unable to cultivate in peace too, looking forward to their news every single day.

But along with the passing with time, Ye Yuan also became more and more restless.

Actually, several decades ago, Jiang Jadehall already invited Ye Yuan to the imperial capital. But Ye Yuan had the 500-year-agreement and naturally would not go.

Now, he would not go even more.

Jiang Jadehall gave Ye Yuan a glance and said, “Rest assured, sister-in-law they all will be blessed by the heavens and turn calamities into blessings!”

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “Brother Jiang, these words, you yourself don’t even believe it, right?”

Jiang Jadehall was a little embarrassed when he heard that and laughed awkwardly.

The Heavenspan World was too big. Danger was everywhere. The few of them, their strengths were not strong either. Something happening outside was not surprising.

Back then, when Li-er they all left, what Ye Yuan was most worried about was this situation today. He did not expect that it still happened.

The reason why he set the 500-year-agreement was in order to not let them run too far.

Looking at it now, the development of things still could not be as he wished.

Jiang Jadehall saw that Ye Yuan was dejected and urged, “Don’t blame yourself too much either. Saying something a little pretentious, want to blame, blame that you’re too outstanding! Being by your side requires enormous pressure!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Yuan looked at Jiang Jadehall and could not resist rolling his eyes.

However, what Jiang Jadehall said were heartfelt words and did not have the intention of buttering him up.

Even though these words indeed sounded rather flattering.

These few years, Jiang Jadehall and Ye Yuan had a close friendship and naturally knew how astonishing Ye Yuan’s talent was.

Such an outstanding genius, ordinary people being by his side had to bear tremendous pressure.

And this was also precisely the reason why Li-er they all left.

Jiang Jadehall continued: “Got to look at the bright side of things. You think about it, They are training outside. Perhaps they had some lucky encounter, or are hindered by something, who knows?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said with a nod, “Can only think like that.”

Jiang Jadehall said, “So next, what do you plan to do?”

Ye Yuan said, “In another few years, if there is still no news, I plan on making a trip to Extreme Light Imperial City!”

Jiang Jadehall’s expression changed and he cried out in shock, “Extreme Light Imperial City! That’s the Jian Family’s territory!”

God knows how many imperial cities in the Heavenspan World. Imperial cities that were contented to exercise sovereignty over a part of the country like Heavenly Eagle were completely unknown to the public.

But some imperial cities were resounding like the roar of thunder, everyone knew about them in the entire Heavenspan World.

Extreme Light Imperial City was one of them.

The reason why it was so renowned was naturally that it was one of the territories of the Jian Family.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s descendants spanned all over the Heavenspan World. But some rendezvous points were the Jian Family’s private plots.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right! The Jian Family’s aura viewing art is unparalleled under the heavens. I want to invite them to take action. At least, I got to make sure of Li-er their safety.”

Jiang Jadehall’s expression changed and he said, “The Jian Family’s members are all unbelievably proud. You, a first-layered heaven Divine Lord, they won’t recognize you when you arrive there. Who will give you face?”

Ye Yuan said, “The last time I went out to train, I became acquainted with a member of the Jian Family. See if he can help or not. All in all, not getting their news, I can’t even continue cultivating.”

Jiang Jadehall was incomparably shocked in his heart. He did not think that Ye Yuan actually even got acquainted with a member of the Jian Family!

One had to know, precisely because members of the Jian Family all knew the aura viewing aura, so the people that they made friends with were all people with great potential.

Ordinary people could hardly enter their arcane sights at all.

One should not make the assumption on how he, Jiang Jadehall, was a Celestial Deity powerhouse. Once a Jian family member saw that he did not have potential, they would not even be bothered to look at him.

But thinking about it, Jiang Jadehall was also relieved.

With Ye Yuan’s talent, the Jian family members regarding him highly were also reasonable.

If let him know that Jian Zhentao only took one look at Ye Yuan and blinded his eyes, who knew what he would think.

Jiang Jadehall nodded when he heard that and said, “May as well. Extreme Light Imperial City is powerful. If you can get acquainted with members of the Jian Family, it will be infinitely beneficial to you!”

Ye Yuan suddenly took out a large jar and said, “Brother Jian, after I leave, Heavenly Eagle’s affairs will be entrusted to you. Here is a jar of Hundred Flowers Heavenly Immortal Wine, you take it and slowly savor it.”

Jiang Jadehall’s gaze turned sharp and he stared at Ye Yuan as he said angrily, “You punk, complaining to me daily about how hard up you are, but turns out that you actually hid so much!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I brewed a total of three jars, this is the last jar. The spirit medicines that this Hundred Flowers Heavenly Immortal Wine requires, you’re also aware of it. After finishing this, who knows what year and month you’ll have to wait until to drink it again!”

The moment Jiang Jadehall heard, his expression calmed down slightly and he said with a cold smile, “You punk, want to use this jar of wine to bribe this envoy?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then will you accept the bribe or not?”

Jiang Jadehall suddenly cracked and smile, hugging that jar of wine, and said with a big laugh, “Of course I accept! Such a delicious wine, whoever doesn’t drink is a fool! You go ahead, Southridge’s matters, even if you don’t give a heads up, could it be that I can still sit by idly and remain indifferent? It’s just that with Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s current strength, it doesn’t need me to intervene at all.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This place is my base camp. Not handing it over well, how can I leave with peace of mind?”

Jiang Jadehall as the Southridge Ten Cities’ patrolling inspector, the authority that he possessed was tremendous.

Holding power over life and property was up to his whims.

Jiang Jadehall was not the kind of person who perpetrated whatever evils that he pleased. If not, Southridge Ten Cities would never know peace at all.

As long as Jiang Jadehall was willing, he could even concoct various pretexts and abolish or establish the lord of a city.

Hence, with Jiang Jadehall around, Ye Yuan was still very reassured.

As long as Jiang Jadehall was willing to take care, Heavenly Eagle would have no worries about troubles back at home.

...

“This is Extreme Light Imperial City? Indeed magnificent!”

After more than ten years, Ye Yuan still stood outside the city gates of Extreme Light Imperial City in the end.

Waiting for another close to ten years at Heavenly Eagle, Ye Yuan seriously could not carry on waiting anymore.

Hence, he left behind Long Zhan to guardHeavenly Eagle, while he himself brought Ning Tianping to Extreme Light Imperial City.

Extreme Light Imperial City was indeed worthy of the name extreme light. Sunglow surrounded the skies of the city, akin to colored ribbons. It was extremely spectacular.

Similarly an imperial city, Heavenly Eagle compared to Extreme Light was simply a remote hinterland.

Of course, the truth was also like this.

Extreme Light Imperial City belonged under Brilliant True Heavenly Emperor’s command, a different heavenly emperor than Heavenly Eagle.

The place where Brilliant True Heavenly Emperor resided was naturally much more abundant in spiritual energy.

Compared to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, Extreme Light Imperial City’s spiritual energy was several times more abundant!

In contrast, Heavenly Eagle was really a remote village.

“Indeed well-deserving of being the Jian Family’s city. This kind of atmosphere, probably only the Jian Family can create it, right?” Ning Tianping said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The art of viewing auras is indeed peerlessly marvelous!”

Ning Tianping said, “Your Excellency, where should we go to find Elder Jian?”

Ye Yuan said, “The last time, he told me that it was a place called Profound Secrets Pavilion. I’m completely clueless about this place too. Let’s enter the city first and take a look at the situation.”

Done talking, the two people paid the costs of entering the city and entered Extreme Light Imperial City.
