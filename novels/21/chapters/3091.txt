Chapter 3090: Messing With You!

Seven small mountains suspended around Ye Yuan. The aura that they emitted actually made people feel somewhat daunted. Clearly, they were not ordinary objects.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s strength was too weak. He was unable to unleash the true power of a chaos heavenly treasure at all.

Otherwise, killing them would be as easy as turning over his hand!

Such a treasure, it was hard for them to avoid feeling moved when they saw it.

“The treasure is right here. You can come and take it if you have the ability!” Ye Yuan ridiculed them lightly.

Although he was seriously wounded, his aura was not the least bit weak.

Meng Jin said disdainfully, “If this seat wants to kill you, wouldn’t it be effortless? Hang on. This seat will be retrieving the treasure right now!”

While talking, Meng Jin already disappeared.

How fast was the speed of a Hegemon Realm?

Virtually surpassing the time to think, he already arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

Bloodfiend Heart Devouring Palm!

A palm was already imprinted on Ye Yuan’s chest.

The corners of Meng Jin’s mouth revealed a hint of a cruel smile.

......

Clearly, Ye Yuan already had nowhere to evade it!

“Be careful!” Right at this time, Chi Shang suddenly warned, his words carrying intense shock.

Meng Jin’s expression changed drastically, feeling his scalp tingling, and he flew away from where he was without hesitation.

Boom!

An enormous mountain slammed where he was standing!

Meng Jin’s heart shook wildly, thinking to himself, when did this boy’s speed become so fast?

What he hit just now was actually Ye Yuan’s afterimage!

What did this show?

Ye Yuan’s speed was much faster than his!

How was this possible? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Just now, Ye Yuan clearly could not even see his back view.

Ye Yuan surpassed him in a blink of an eye?

This kind of change was a little too fantastical, right?

Ye Yuan stood far away in the sky and mocked, “Weren’t you coming to retrieve the treasure? Why did you slip away so quickly?”

Meng Jin’s expression turned dark, and he said, “Kid, you hid your strength?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I was merely messing with you previously. Seven days, it can’t be too boring as well, no? Now, does it feel very ironic? You actually can’t keep up with my, this Emperor Sakra Heaven’s, speed?”

The moment Ye Yuan said this, Meng Jin was even more certain that Ye Yuan hid his strength and could not help feeling extremely depressed in his heart.

He thought that he was toying with Ye Yuan. After messing around for half a day, he was the one who was being toyed with!

Furthermore, he was a Hegemon Realm!

When Chi Shang saw that Meng Jin was like this, he wished to kill him with a palm.

He snorted coldly and said, “Idiot! You believe whatever this kid says? He clearly had some comprehension just now. That’s why his speed would increase greatly!”

Chi Shang was really somewhat regretting it!

He still underestimated this boy. How could a brat that could make even Progenitor apprehensive possibly be simple?

It was just that he did not expect that Ye Yuan’s comprehension ability was also too monstrous. Just now, under the situation of life and death hanging by a thread, he could actually comprehend such an incredible speed!

Also, Meng Jin, this moron, actually really thought that Ye Yuan concealed his strength.

What a joke!

Meng Jin was stupefied, only then coming around to his senses, and he could not help becoming even angrier from embarrassment.

It turned out that he was completely treated as an idiot!

Furthermore, he was really stupid!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I said it before. You guys will regret it! Didn’t your Progenitor Bloodstone tell you guys that I have the origin of blood too? Furthermore, it’s the purest origin of blood! Although this Bloodcloud Grand Array is a domain of blood, I’m unable to crack it for the time being. But, it doesn’t hinder me from fusing the origin of blood and spatial origin together!”

The three people’s expressions changed wildly!

They really did not know about this!

How could the Chaos Bloodstone possibly tell his subordinates this sort of humiliating thing?

Inside the Bloodcloud Grand Array, there was the blood origin of Progenitor Bloodstone’s main body. It was unbelievably powerful. Even a Great Beyond Realm would find it hard to breach it too.

But this origin of blood was of the same root as Ye Yuan.

This Bloodcloud Grand Array, putting it bluntly, was actually a space.

Although this space was extremely profound, it was difficult for Ye Yuan to comprehend it in a short while too.

But, with Ye Yuan’s comprehension in spatial origin, fusing the origin of blood and spatial origin together a little was not something too hard.

There was no need to do much. As long as he could use spatial divine abilities inside this Bloodcloud Grand Array, it would suffice!

He only needed a bit of time, and it would be enough.

Originally, with three people joining forces to kill him, he would really have a slim chance of surviving.

But now, he had the strength to fight!

Ye Yuan casually swallowed a heavenly pill. His injuries were recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Chi Shang’s expression changed again, and he said in a solemn voice, “Stop playing, attack together and kill him! His speed is very fast. I’ll tie him down, and you guys wait for an opportunity to make a move. Don’t give him any chance! This time, we mustn’t fail again!”

You Lei and Meng Jin, two people, nodded at the same time. They did not dare to underestimate Ye Yuan anymore as well.

Swoosh!

Chi Shang took a step and directly disappeared. His speed was actually significantly faster than Meng Jin!

Ye Yuan did not dare to slight him and similarly took a step, disappearing.

The two people exhibited incredible speed inside this Bloodcloud Grand Array!

You Lei and Meng Jin, two people, actually could not quite keep up.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that Chi Shang’s speed was actually so fast. He was actually being tied down by him for some time.

Chi Shang was shocked in his heart. Ye Yuan’s speed was too fast!

He did not dare to be the slightest bit neglectful, raising his speed to the extreme. He continuously used powerful attacks to cut off Ye Yuan’s path, curbing Ye Yuan’s speed.

While You Lei and Meng Jin, two people, attempted to form an encirclement around Ye Yuan.

But the two of them were too slow. They were always slow by one move.

Each time, when the encirclement momentum was about to form, Ye Yuan would be like a fish that escaped the net, slipping out with a?whoosh.

Meng Jin yelled out angrily, “Little thief, when this seat catches you, I’ll definitely tear your corpse to shreds!”

Chi Shang also said gloomily, “Continuing like this isn’t the way to go. This boy is too cunning!”

Ye Yuan’s speed was too fast, his attacks could not lock onto Ye Yuan at all, and he could only use large-area attacks to cut him off.

This process was actually the process of fighting a battle of wits and a contest of strength.

His cutting off act was very purposeful. The goal was naturally to form an encirclement momentum, making Ye Yuan have nowhere to escape.

Each time, Ye Yuan seemed to be simply flying away like a headless fly.

But in the end, he could always make his get-away.

In Chi Shang’s heart, he could not help feeling stifled from anger.

“Chi Shang, your attacks are too stupid! Do you really think that I’m a fish in a net, allowing you to do whatever you want?” Ye Yuan’s mocking came from the void.

Chi Shang was furious and said in a solemn voice,?“Humph!?Kid, just you run! Even if you can flee for seven days inside the Bloodcloud Grand Array, so what? Seven days later, your Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven will already be our blood race’s territory! At that time, there will be a large group of Great Beyond powerhouses waiting for you outside! I want to see whether or not you can escape out of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

Ye Yuan was shocked in his heart, but he maintained his composure and said,?“Hur hur,?want to goad me? You’re too naive!”

Chi Shang smiled and said, “Lord Yi Xue brought nine mighty Great Beyond powerhouses and over 400 Hegemon Realm powerhouses and descended upon Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! Do you think that they still have hope of survival? Go on and flee. Your loved ones and friends are probably already pretty much dead! The moment seven days are up, you can be reunited with them!”

Ye Yuan’s heart sank to the bottom.

This was likely not fake!

Although this Bloodcloud Grand Array was powerful, with Mi Tian’s strength, he could most likely crack it. It just needed some time.

If it was really like this, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s situation was not good!
