Chapter 1320: Mutual Defeat

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Luo Jian, your future is really limitless! Just entering grand completion Grotto Profound, and you’re already able to fight to this extent with this old man! It’s sufficient to be proud!”

Wang Yugan was also secretly astonished. The height of this Luo Jian’s laws comprehension seriously exceeded his expectations.

If Luo Jian broke through ten or eight years earlier, he might really not necessarily be this Luo Jian’s match.

But as for now, he was overpowering strongly. Luo Jian was already forced into a dead end.

His spear technique was heavy and powerful, but the speed was not slow.

Luo Jian’s nimbleness was greatly discounted in front of him.

Suddenly, Wang Yugan’s expression changed. A burst of terrifying sword intent surged towards the sky.

Luo Jian’s entire person seemed to be burned by fire, his skin becoming wine-red.

“Heaven and Earth Mutual Longevity!”

In virtually an instant, Luo Jian’s entire person’s speed and power skyrocketed over tenfold!

The originally suppressed Luo Jian actually faintly took the upper-hand at this time, his entire person akin to a phantom, charging over towards Wang Yugan.

In a blink, the two people exchanged several hundred moves, the speed swift to the extreme.

This move was just like a mutual destruction way of fighting!

Ye Yuan discerned it, this move was a kind of divine essence burning move, capable of making Luo Jian’s strength skyrocket more than tenfold.

But this way, it would cause a tremendous burden on his body.

Furthermore, with the current fighting intensity, Luo Jian could not last long. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

If he could not finish off Wang Yugan, then what awaited the two of them was only death!

“Brat, although this move is powerful, you’ll croak yourself first before defeating me!” Wang Yugan said with a cold sneer.

Although his pressure was great, for Luo Jian to want to dispose of him within a short time, it could not be done at all.

Another sword assaulted, Wang Yugan responded with a cold smile.

This sword was no different from before.

He did not hesitate in the slightest, directly raising his spear and striking.

But just as his spear-tip was about to touch the long sword, Luo Jian’s sword bizarrely disappeared from before his eyes.

Wang Yugan’s pupils constructed, wanting to react again, but it was already too late.

Puchi!

Puchi!

Two sounds of metal entering the flesh sounded out!

Wang Yugan’s long sword passed through the chest, toting Luo Jian in the air.

While Luo Jian’s sword likewise passed through Wang Yugan’s chest!

Mutual destruction!

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

The two people spewed out a large mouthful of blood at the same time.

Especially Luo Jian, his golden-colored fresh blood flowed down along the long spear, his appearance very tragic.

The Luo Jian hanging on the long spear was already unconscious.

Wang Yugan’s eyes were filled with uncertainty. Why would that sword just now vanish strangely?

But very soon, his gaze revealed a fierce look, frenziedly mustering divine essence, wanting to rotate the long spear.

He wanted to grind Luo Jian’s innards to pieces!

But right at this time, a cold light flashed by. Ye Yuan already rushed over!

Ye Yuan’s timing was grasped perfectly, not giving Wang Yugan the opportunity to deal the killing blow.

Even though Wang Yugan was very strong, he was not yet powerful to the extent where he did not fear Ye Yuan’s attack.

“Fine sword art! It’s too bad that you’re still too unskilled!”

Wang Yugan gave a fierce cry. There was no time to rotate the spear, directly extending a leg and kicking Luo Jian flying.

This kick was powerful and heavy, directly kicking Luo Jian flying out several tens of thousands of feet away.

Wang Yugan’s movements were extremely agile. The long spear swung and already pointed towards Ye Yuan!

In Wang Yugan’s view, with his strength, even if seriously injured, killing Ye Yuan was merely the matter of a move.

But right then, a hint of a mocking smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

Wang Yugan’s gaze turned intent.

“Roar!”

A heaven-shaking dragon roar sounded out.

After arriving at the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan unleashed the Voice of the Dragon God for the first time!

Accurately speaking, it should be the first time Ye Yuan exhibited the Voice of the Dragon God after breaking through to Deity Realm!

In the Immortal Grove World, he was able to muster the power of Heavenly Dao. Killing people was just a matter of flicking a finger and did not need to use the Voice of the Dragon God at all.

However, the Ye Yuan who broke through to Deity Realm unleashing the Voice of the Dragon God was already totally different from before.

The limitation of realms made Ye Yuan completely unable to unleash the true power of this move.

His dragon soul awakening directly comprehended the first level of the Voice of the Dragon God.

But due to the limitations of realm, he could only unleash the entry-level power of this move. Furthermore, he could only persist two to three breaths of time.

But now, his limitations were much fewer.

This Voice of the Dragon God move was at the boundary of first level grand completion!

Leaping realms to battle was no object!

If Wang Yugan was at his prime, Ye Yuan naturally could not do anything to him.

But now, it was just perfect!

Wang Yugan’s entire person was akin to being struck by lightning, being shocked by this move until he bled from the seven orifices.

Especially that wound, under the catalyzing of the Voice of the Dragon God, it enlarged abruptly, golden fresh blood spraying forth like a fountain!

The battle results which Luo Jian exchanged with his life as the price, Ye Yuan could not waste it no matter what!

Ten breaths!

This was the limit that Ye Yuan could achieve at present. Anymore and Ye Yuan would not have strength leftover to escape anymore.

The disparity between him and Wang Yugan was too great, and he could not kill him at all.

Being able to pile on injuries on top of injuries was already the limit.

In the next instant, Ye Yuan’s figure retreated explosively, grabbing Luo Jian and speeding away into the distance.

“Old Fogey, today’s grudge, this Ye has remembered it! Your dog head will dwell on your body for the time being! Ye Yuan will definitely come to take it one day!”

Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared in Wang Yugan’s line of sight, those cold words of Ye Yuan’s reverberating in the air.

Wang Yugan’s complexion was deathly pale. He did not think that the initial-stage Grotto Profound Ye Yuan actually had such a formidable ace in the hole.

The heaven and earth laws contained in this level of sound wave attack was too terrifying. If Ye Yuan’s strength was a little stronger, he would definitely have to meet his end here today.

Wang Yugan knew that Ye Yuan was an alchemist, but did not expect that Ye Yuan’s combat strength was actually so strong!

Just based on this move, it was sufficient for Ye Yuan to sweep across opponents of the same level already.

Even middle-stage Grotto Profound martial artists might not be Ye Yuan’s match either!

Only late-stage Grotto Profound powerhouses could steadily win Ye Yuan.

Today’s matter looked like Luo Jian saving Ye Yuan.

Actually, looking from another angle, it was still Ye Yuan saving himself.

If not for him helping Luo Jian to break through, even if Luo Jian exhausted all of his trump cards, he could not possibly hurt him too.

“That move just now was clearly a demon race’s supreme martial technique! He ... is a human. How could he know that martial technique?”

Wang Yugan consumed a medicinal pill, his gaze full of wariness.

His chest had a large hole torn open, looking incomparably grim.

The wound that Luo Jian caused was merely the width of a sword.

But Ye Yuan’s Voice of the Dragon God forcefully ripped open a large hole in his wound.

Except, even though the injuries were severe, it was not sufficient to be life-threatening.

Wanting to kill a Deity Realm powerhouse was very difficult.

Three days later, Wang Yugan’s injuries were finally brought under control.

He took out a talisman and slowly opened his mouth and said, “The situation has changed, the ambush failed! Send out Second Elder, Third Elder. That child absolutely can’t be left alive!”

Finished talking, the talisman emitted a blinding light, vanishing in the air.

While at this time, Ye Yuan brought heavily wounded and dying Luo Jian, and already escaped several tens of thousands of miles away.
