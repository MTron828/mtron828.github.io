Chapter 2599: Bullying with Numbers!

The subordinate said in shock, “Then, isn’t it unsolvable?”

But Liang Wen shook his head and said, “Not unsolvable, but that Qiu Chengzhi’s blade isn’t fast enough!”

Quickblade was not fast enough!

This was perhaps the greatest irony.

Puu, puu, puu?…

All of a sudden, sword light flashed past.

Qiu Chengzhi was struck by several swords in an instant, landing miserably.

“Blade technique is decent, but it’s just a pity that it isn’t there yet!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Blade intent and sword intent were both at the first level of rule.

Qiu Chengzhi was completely defeated!

Qiu Chengzhi struggled to get up and knelt in front of Ye Yuan and said, “Qiu Chengzhi, thanks Your Excellency for your grace of not killing, I’m willing to follow Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Get up, wait at one side.”

Qiu Chengzhi did not dare to disobey and got up to stand at one side droopily.

“Humph!?What a trash! Qiu Chengzhi, you’re really declining the longer you live! Since you’ve lost, why aren’t you dead?”

Right at this time, a cold snort came from the crowd.

The piercing cold spear intent seemed to have come out of the underworld, locking onto Qiu Chengzhi firmly.

Qiu Chengzhi’s expression changed wildly, and he exclaimed, “Absolute Spear, Zheng Tianyang!”

This spear carried an imposing momentum that dominated the whole world but was also unpredictable.

People could not even detect where the spear was at!

“Number ten, Zheng Tianyan! He came too!”

“What a strong spear! He’s going to kill Qiu Chengzhi!”

“Heh, Qiu Chengzhi is to be killed when he was the first to submit. This is slapping face!”

… …

Those present were not fools. Someone immediately guessed Zheng Tianyang’s intentions.

It was just that up until now, it was all just hearsay without seeing the person!

Suddenly, there was a blur before everyone’s eyes.

An ice-blue long spear already appeared three feet in front of Qiu Chengzhi.

Three feet, for a spear technique that pressed forward indomitably, it was just a matter of a single breath.

This already determined Qiu Chengzhi’s death.

“Universe!”

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly disappeared from where he was.

When he appeared again, he already blocked in front of Qiu Chengzhi.

Boom!

An intense explosion sound came over, Zheng Tianyang’s figure fell back over a dozen steps in a row before barely managing to stabilize his figure.

While Ye Yuan did not budge an inch!

Zheng Tianyang’s expression changed wildly, looking at Ye Yuan full of dread.

His indomitable strike was actually blocked by Ye Yuan!

Furthermore, it was when his spear momentum reached its pinnacle and clashed head-on to forcibly block it!

At this time, Ye Yuan was currently standing with his hands behind his back as he looked at him indifferently and said, “Spear technique is not bad! But you can’t arouse my interest. Submit, or die!”

Ye Yuan naturally did not come here to dominate the Resplendent Sun City.

He did it in order to borrow the hands of these powerhouses to temper himself.

These ferocious and wicked people who were veterans were absolutely the best opponents for training.

But, that also depended on who the opponent was.

At least, the top 10 had already taken the stage, but Ye Yuan did not have the interest of making his move.

Zheng Tianyang was very strong, but he still could not arouse his interest.

Zheng Tianyang’s expression flickered indeterminately. Finally, he cupped his fists and gave a bow as he said, “Zheng Tianyang is willing to submit!”

Not submitting was death!

That blow just now, the victor was already determined. There was no need to fight anymore.

While he was a great deal stronger than Qiu Chengzhi, it was also merely just forcing Ye Yuan to leave where he was standing.

If they really clashed, he would definitely die within three moves!

Zheng Tianyang was not a fool either. So why would he seek death himself?

It was just that this scene looked incomparably shocking in everyone’s eyes.

Talking about it was slow, but actually, from Zheng Tianyang opening his mouth to being repelled back, it was merely three breaths of time.

Many people still had not figured out what was going on and it already ended.

A second ago, Zheng Tianyang was still mocking Qiu Chengzhi for being a good-for-nothing.

In the next second, he himself submitted too.

Really a comical scene!

It was just that no one laughed.

On the contrary, they were deeply shocked.

Even the 10th place Zheng Tianyang could not last a single move under Ye Yuan’s hands.

Just how strong was he?

After Zheng Tianyang, it was immediately much quieter.

No one came out anymore.

Ye Yuan was still seated on the ground, waiting for the next challenger. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Two hours later, six figures walked out of the crowd, surrounding Ye Yuan.

These six people, each of them had threatening and imposing auras!

The appearance of these six people made everyone seethe with excitement all at once.

“Number nine, Zhou Jian; number eight, Qian Yuhuai; number seven, Luo Zhen; number six, Leng Xia; number five, Ling Bu; number four, Zhao Chendong! Six of the top ten powerhouses came all at once!”

“Too exciting! Too explosive! Didn’t expect that this outsider can actually force six people in the top ten to join forces! Furthermore, these six people’s strengths are not close. Each of them is extremely stronger than the last!”

“It looks like the six of them don’t have the confidence to win for sure too. That’s why they chose to join forces!”

… …

The Land of Exile was never a place that obeyed rules.

The creed here was the fist!

When they felt that they might not be able to defeat you, they would join forces to kill the enemy without the slightest hesitation!

One-on-one did not exist!

The six people got into position, with their killing intent already linked up together.

Although the six of them had never joined forces before, amidst the endless killing, their control of killing intent had long already reached the acme of perfection.

So when cooperating, it would not seem unsmooth!

The fifth place Ling Bu said in a solemn voice, “Outsider, you’re very strong! But you’re too arrogant! In the Land of Exile, arrogant people only have one outcome; that’s death!”

The seventh place Luo Zhen said with a cold laugh,?“Huhu,?punk, do you think that this place is the same as outside, and that we’ll come and challenge you one-on-one? What a joke!”

Seeing the arrival of these six people, Ye Yuan slowly got up and said with a smile, “I can feel that you guys are very strong. I hope that you guys won’t let me down!”

Luo Zhen sneered and said, “We won’t let you down. We’ll be sending you on your way! Kill!”

With a word, the six people launched an attack at the same time!

That commotion made the faces of everyone present change.

The cooperation of the six was simply brilliant to the peak!

No one could have imagined that this was actually their first time joining hands against an enemy!

The rules that the six people were skilled in were different, but cooperating together, it was like nature itself, as if completely covering this world.

And everything inside would be crushed.

“So strong! The combined attack of the six of them should be able to forcefully contend with the third place Di Xing, right?”

“That boy was too haughty! With these six people working together, even a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum will pale in comparison too! With just him alone, can he stop them?”

“The battle has ended! This boy’s talent was really wasted!”

… …

The six people’s perfect cooperation attracted a series of exclamations.

However, the cooperation was secondary.

These six people’s strength by itself already reached the limits of Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

As long as they were willing, they could break through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum at any time!

Furthermore, their application of rule already reached the level of instinct.

Right at the tip of their fingers!

That spear strike of Zheng Tianyang would definitely be instantly crushed under these six people’s combined attack!

It was not on the same level at all!

Therefore, in their view, Ye Yuan was dead without a doubt!

Facing such a powerful attack, Ye Yuan’s face revealed a smile and he said, “Not bad. This makes it a little interesting! This Land of Exile indeed has tigers crouching and dragons hiding!”

He felt a strong pressure!

With six people joining forces, it was truly a thunderbolt blow!

But this also triggered his powerful fighting intent!
