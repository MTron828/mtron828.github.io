Chapter 2186: Pummeling

The faces of the group of Empyreans all changed irregularly.

A Second Firmament Empyrean asked them if they wanted to die or live. This scene was rather comical.

But the circumstances were more persuasive than rational thinking. At present, it already reached the moment of life-and-death. It did not allow them to be wayward.

The choice determined the outcome.

Was it to believe Ye Yuan or to fight to the death?

Li Yue had a very conflicted face. He disliked Ye Yuan’s cocky appearance greatly.

But he was similarly clear that with the current situation, they probably could not even escape if they wanted to!

“Brother Ye, I’ll listen to you!” At this time, Zheng Yufeng was the first to step forward and fervently support Ye Yuan.

He knew that the time left for them was already not much!

“Little Brother, hope that you don’t scam us!” Another person stepped forward.

“Little Brother Ye, this empyrean is handing this old life to your hands!”

... ...

Facing the terror of death made everyone make a decision very quickly.

In a certain death situation, everyone could only choose to believe Ye Yuan.

Li Yue’s expression flickered incessantly. Finally, he gritted his teeth and also said, “Brat, if you dare to scam this empyrean, this empyrean won’t let you off even if I become a ghost too!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and suddenly fished out a large bunch of golden needles.

When everyone saw the situation, their faces could not help changing.

What did this kid want to do?

“I’m going to poke you guys a bit. Don’t resist. Otherwise, I can’t answer for the consequences.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Li Yue’s two eyes narrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Brat, you wouldn’t be wanting to stab the acupoints with a golden needle, right?”

Ye Yuan nodded slowly and said, “That’s right!”

Li Yue’s face fell and he said, “Nonsense! So many of us, by the time you finish applying the needles, the flowers would have turned yellow! Are you freaking screwing with us?”

Hearing Li Yue’s words, quite a few people revealed unhappy looks.

Clearly, they all felt that they were being made fun of.

The abyss monster leader also laughed loudly as it said, “Hahaha ... Kid, just based on a few needles and you want to deal with noble abyss monsters?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Who said that I’m going to apply the needles one by one? I said, don’t resist, otherwise, bear the consequences yourself! It’s coming!”

Everyone’s hearts turned cold, only to see Ye Yuan knead seals.

Several hundred streams of golden light turned into flowing light, dancing wildly in the darkness.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh ...

In one breath, several hundred streams of golden light flashed and disappeared.

The group of Empyreans only felt like their bodies were being bitten by several ants. Then, a boundless power emerged from every pore on their bodies.

“What powerful strength! I feel like I’m already invincible under the heavens!”

“This is golden needles piercing acupoints method? Truly too amazing!”

“Hahaha, you bunch of trash, come over and fight with Grandpa!”

... ...

Each Empyreans’ body erupted with a fearsome aura.

Just like their strength instantly increased by one realm.

Li Yue felt that power coming from all over his body and felt like he could contend with Seventh Firmament Empyreans!

At this moment, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan became incomparably surprised.

In an instant, controlling several hundred golden needles and accurately stabbing into the acupoints of every Empyrean’s body without error, what kind of terrifying control was this?

Although he was not an alchemist, he also knew that this kind of terrifying control was not what ordinary alchemists could achieve!

Golden needle piercing the acupoints method, the strength, divine essence, soul force, as well as precision, so on and so forth, the things that needed to be paid attention to were far too many.

Furthermore, among the Empyreans present, each person’s strength was different. Each person’s realm was different. The situation was incomparably complex.

It could be said that how to apply the needles for each person had to be tailor-made.

Golden needles piercing the acupoints method was an extremely dangerous method. The difference in millimeters was something that could be fatal.

But Ye Yuan drafted up a set of acupuncture outline for everyone in such a short time.

Even if an Eight-star Alchemy God came here, it was also impossible to stimulate each person’s potential so precisely.

What kind of monster was this fellow?!

Those opposite were monsters.

But this monster in front of them was even more terrifying than those monsters opposite!

The abyss monster leader finally discovered a hint of something amiss.

The auras of these Empyreans suddenly became very powerful.

However, he did not feel that abyss monsters would lose to weak humans!

“Minions, kill for me! Tear these foolish humans to shreds!” The abyss monster leader bellowed.

Under the word of command, several dozen abyss monsters roared and charged over toward the human Empyreans.

“Haha, perfect! Watch this Empyrean tear you trash into pieces!”

These human Empyreans all had their strength skyrocket, brimming with vigor and energy. They were just worried about having nowhere to vent it.

Seeing the abyss monsters rush up, they did not retreat, but advanced instead, directly rushing over.

For some time, the human Empyreans and abyss monsters fought and killed until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open, with the void trembling.

Li Yue abyss monster and actually directly charged toward the abyss monster leader!

This leader was Sixth Firmament Empyrean, even if he could not deal with a Seventh Firmament Empyrean human martial artist, exterminating Sixth Firmament Empyreans was still very easy.

But when Li Yue clashed together with him, he actually did not fall into a disadvantage!

The human Empyrean powerhouses all seemed to have been injected with stimulants, and actually fought and killed until the abyss monsters steadily lost ground.

This kind of horrifying strength fought until the abyss monsters cried out strangely.

By the side, when Lin Changqing saw this scene, he was transfixed.

His strength was too weak, stabbing or not stabbing him was irrelevant to the overall situation. Ye Yuan did not apply golden needles piercing acupoints on him either.

This guy’s means were truly inconceivable!

At this time, he actually somewhat regretted following after. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The more he came into contact with Ye Yuan, and the more he witnessed Ye Yuan’s methods getting more and more, the more that he felt ashamed of his unworthiness.

He currently even had a feeling that only someone like Ye Yuan was worthy of Yue Mengli.

Him pursuing Yue Mengli was simply sullying her!

Lin Changqing shook his head hard, attempting to shake this kind of thinking out of his head.

But it would not go away at all!

In front of Ye Yuan, he grew less and less confident.

These human Empyreans were the elites of the various Bodhidharmas to begin with, their strength far surpassing their peers.

Now that their potential was stimulated, each and every one of their strength skyrocketed, and they could actually pummel same rank abyss monsters.

The originally certain-death situation actually became a one-sided situation now.

Especially the high-level combat powers, Zheng Yufeng and the rest, their strength was about the same as Li Yue’s.

Currently, they even rampaged in all directions, killing those Fifth Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters until they were in a sorry plight.

After they managed to find time, they joined Li Yue’s battle group.

One versus one became two versus one became three versus one.

The abyss monster leader nearly vomited blood at this time.

But, even if he wanted to run now, he could not run away either.

Under the pincer attacks of the few mighty experts, the abyss monster leader was getting defeated not long after.

The devil monster leader’s aura became weaker and weaker. In the blink, it was riddled with injuries, its strength being less than 10%.

“Leave it alive!” Ye Yuan called out.

Li Yue said with a cold snort, “This kind of monster, spare for what? Just kill it!”

As he said, he suddenly made a move and was about to slay the devil monster leader.

“Immobilize!”

A thunderclap-like voice seemingly shouted out from great antiquity.

The few mighty experts were caught off-guard and were actually immobilized at the same time!

A figure suddenly appeared in front of the devil monster leader.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan directly plunged a hand into the devil monster leader’s head. He grabbed the devil monster leader’s tarnished black devil crystal!
