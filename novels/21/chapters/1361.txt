Chapter 1365: Little Fatty’s Roar

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Once a person’s will reached its limit, it became very hard to gather one’s concentration.

Previously, Xie Jingyi’s willpower was already somewhat muddled under the scouring of Heaven’s Might. How could he still remember what Ah Xiu?

Ye Yuan’s words were like the evening drum and morning bell in a monastery, startling Xie Jingyi awake.

Willpower scouring was like running. Once passed the most unbearable limit period, you would discover that you became very capable of running.

However, under such heavy pressure, Xie Jingyi did not dare to act rashly.

He focused his mind, continuously holding fast to his faith in his mind, and actually persisted just like that.

It was just that he was secretly incredibly shocked in his heart, Ye Yuan was actually able to last until now!

He even thought that Ye Yuan had been eliminated long ago.

After all, words sounded nice but did not represent that one really had that strength.

But not just last until now, he actually had strength leftover to talk and remind him.

This indicated that this degree of willpower scouring was nothing to Ye Yuan!

Was this guy really middle-stage Grotto Profound?

Although Martial Dao willpower did not have an inexorable relation with cultivation realm, generally speaking, it was all about the higher one’s cultivation realm, the more powerful the Martial Dao willpower.

The entrance examinations in the past, it was not that there were no middle-stage Grotto Profound who passed the first round, but they were like feathers of a phoenix and the horn of a Qilin.

More often than not, being able to produce one in a thousand years was already pretty good.

Xie Jingyi did not dare to think too much. The willpower scouring became stronger and stronger. He did not have extra time to think about these.

On the platform, the two old men presiding over the test were currently conversing about something.

“No idea what City Lord, His Excellency, is thinking either. Every session, getting these initial-stage and middle-stage Grotto Profound guys to make up the numbers is utterly meaningless!”

“Not exactly so, once low-level martial artists are able to withstand this Martial Dao willpower, their future accomplishment absolutely won’t be beneath you and I. They might even be able to reach City Lord that kind of heights!”

“Be that as it may, for the sake of these supporting casts, we have to expend vast amounts of manpower and resources each time. Is it really worth it?”

“Heh, City Lord, His Excellency, feels that it’s worth it, then it’s worth it. Thinking so much for what?”

They had long gotten accustomed to seeing geniuses. This initial-stage and middle-stage Grotto Profound martial artists, they completely turned their noses up at them.

Although initial-stage and middle-stage Grotto Profound people making it through, their potential was huge, that was also merely just potential.

Those able to truly realize their potential were in the minority.

Time passed day by day, the people on the plaza got fewer and fewer.

However, the elimination speed also became slower and slower.

Those able to pull through the first few days were all people with tough wills. Wanting to make them give up was very difficult!

“ARGH!!”

Suddenly, someone else could not bear on the plaza and cried out tragically.

It was just that this one was somewhat different from those who vomited blood previously. That scream sounded very appalling, then that person’s mouth vomited fresh blood unceasingly.

Finally, the breathing ceased.

This sudden turn of events caught everyone by surprise from start to end.

Those martial artists who were already at the critical point could no longer resist at this time as well, crushing the wooden tablets one after another.

Another large batch of people was eliminated!

Heaven’s Might this round did not isolate the five senses. Everything that happened in the outside world could be seen and heard.

They finally discovered that that old man was not joking, people would really die!

Currently, it was already the 23rd day. Little Fatty’s spirit was already almost collapsing.

Hearing this unforeseen accident, his wooden tablet was unknowingly already held in his hand, finally unable to hold on anymore.

“Can’t anymore, I really can’t hang on anymore! At this rate, I’ll be like him! Being able to persist until now, I’ve already tried my best!”

This sentence kept on echoing in Little Fatty’s mind.

“Going to give up here? Are you finding reasons for yourself, feeling that it’s already very impressive to be able to persist until now? Just seven days remaining, if you’re a man, pull through! Or, are you as your name implies, and should go be a woman?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Just as Xie Jingyi was about to shatter the wooden tablet, Ye Yuan’s voice sounded out once more.

Little Fatty was startled again and shouted, “Your uncle! You’re the woman! I, Xie Jingyi, am an upstanding and dauntless man! Isn’t it just seven days? Your father will definitely persist for you to see! Ah Xiu, you watch, your man is the most impressive!”

Little Fatty’s roar appeared particularly grating on the ear in the plaza.

Everyone was all giving their full attention to resist the willpower scouring. Being hit by his hilarious shout, some of those martial artists around who had already reached the critical point immediately could not hold back anymore, shattering the wooden tablet one by one, and disappearing.

Even Ye Yuan almost could not hold on anymore too.

Fortunately, he still had strength leftover currently and was not to the extent of collapsing.

But Xie Jingyi’s shout startled the two old men on the platform.

“Eh, that little fatty who shouted just now seems to have just entered late-stage Grotto Profound not long. I didn’t expect that he’s actually able to hold on until now.”

“Hiss ... it’s not right!”

“Mm? What’s wrong? He’s indeed a late-stage Grotto Profound!”

“I’m not talking about him! You look at that kid beside him!”

“Mm? Middle-stage Grotto Profound? My ... My eyesight isn’t failing, right? A middle-stage Grotto Profound actually persisted until now?”

“Not just that! You see, his expression is very calm. It is as if this willpower scouring doesn’t have much effect on him!”

“This ... This is really seeing ghosts! In the past, even if there are middle-stage Grotto Profounds persisting until now, it’s also impossible to be so calm like him!”

“Also, have you noticed it? There are already not many people near the two of them. Just now, that little fatty seemed to be talking with someone! Could it be that kid beside him who deliberately triggered his fighting spirit?”

Having said that, the two people exchanged a glance, both seeing the look of shock from the other party’s eyes.

A middle-stage Grotto Profound actually still had the strength to spare to go trigger other people’s fighting spirit when at 23 days!

This willpower was simply terrifying!

Originally, there were still several tens of thousands of people on the plaza. The two old men would not notice Ye Yuan and Xie Jingyi.

But now, because of Little Fatty’s shout, it successfully drew everyone’s attention.

Not just them, the Wu Meng Academy’s people who organized the assessment this time all noticed Little Fatty.

Suddenly, the gaze of that student who issued the token to Ye Yuan turned intent, looking at Ye Yuan with immense shock.

“What’s wrong, Jiang Chen? Startled by that living treasure? But this bit of strength being able to persist until now, it’s indeed not easy.”

There was still another student beside him. Seeing Jiang Chen’s appearance, the student could not help poking fun at him

These two people were both inner-court students. One was called Jiang Chen, and the other was called Song Fang; both were earth camp experts.

Jiang Chen shot him a glance and said, “Late-stage Grotto Profound being able to persist until now isn’t anything strange. But a middle-stage Grotto Profound persisting until now gives people a shock! You look at that kid beside him. It was me who issued him the wooden tablet. Back then, he still called me his senior apprentice brother and was despised by me! I didn’t expect that he actually persisted until now!”

Song Fang originally still had not noticed. Hearing him say so, he could not help getting shocked too.

“Heh heh, I didn’t expect that you also have times where you make an error of judgment! Looking at his appearance, he still has the strength to spare. Heaven’s Might this round probably can’t stump him. It’s just that I don’t know how many points he can win,” Song Fang said with a laugh.
