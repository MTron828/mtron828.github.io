1587 Embarrassing Ranking

A soft cry sounded out. The originally sparrow-like little phoenix’s figure suddenly expanded.

That appearance was just like a blazing sun rising, incomparably dazzling.

Those juniors blocking Ning Siyu were all incredibly alarmed. They did not expect that Ning Siyu severely injuring their senior apprentice brother was actually not her full strength yet!

This was a true fire phoenix, very powerful.

Fire phoenixes were spirits of fire sources. Although they were illusions, it was the form that could best unleash the might of divine fires.

In contrast, the Darksky Dragon that Song Qiyang summoned was a shade inferior.

It was not that divine fires could freely transform into all kinds of shapes. This had to depend on the controller’s strength.

Those with poor strength could only transform theirs into some low-level form.

Those who were able to transform their divine fires to become a dragon like what Song Qiyang did were already considered very powerful. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But in the art of fire control, the difficulty of transforming into a fire phoenix was many times greater than turning into a heavenly dragon.

Ning Siyu’s little bird form previously, others would not pay too much attention.

That kind of small and exquisite form, the requirement on the person controlling fire was not very high.

But right now, this form was totally different!

Constructing such a form with divine fire required exceedingly fine control of flames. Ordinary people could not accomplish it at all.

When Song Qiyang saw this scene, his eyeballs were almost popping out.

“This girl, how did she suddenly become so strong? Could it be ...”

He could not help looking over towards Ye Yuan but discovered that Ye Yuan was expressionless. He was unable to discern joy nor sorrow on Ye Yuan’s face.

“Impossible! If he taught it, why didn’t he have any smug expression at all? It must be Second Elder! He hid all these so deeply!”

Ning Siyu’s fire phoenix was like a bulldozer, places that it passed through turned into scorched earth.

The Head Elder’s side immediately suffered grievous losses. A large swathe of disciples was directly eradicated.

“Too strong! Ning Siyu this lass, when did her fire controlling arts become so strong?”

“This fire phoenix remarkably lifelike and virtually already has a trace of romantic charm. This lass, how did she do it?”

“Compared to this girl’s fire control, Song Qiyang’s Darksky Dragon Art is simply trash!”

...

On the stands, many elders marveled to no end one after another.

Even Xuan Yu had surprise and bewilderment in his eyes too.

He involuntarily looked toward Ye Yuan, but could not see anything from his face.

Xuan Yu knew that these few days, Ning Siyu had always been in Ye Yuan’s mansion and did not come out.

In this imperial city, apart from Ye Yuan, nobody had such ability.

He could not, Rou Xu could not either!

Rou Xu’s expression was as ugly as it could get. He completely did not think that this fire competition actually became a one-sided massacre.

Ning Siyu this lass was too much, just targeting his lineage’s disciples and defeating them all.

On the field, his disciples were wailing all over the place now, scurrying like rats everywhere, not daring to confront Ning Siyu head-on at all.

Very soon, the divine fires in the circle became lesser and lesser. Song Qiyang was also finally killed by Ning Siyu’s third senior brother after fleeing for half a day

The final battle became Second Elder’s side’s civil war.

After Ning Siyu defeated her senior brothers, she took the first place!

When the deacon presiding over the fire competition saw this result, even he could not quite dare to believe it.

“Now, I announce the first round fire competition’s results. First place, Ning Siyu, second place, Jiang Tao, third place ... 97th place, Song Qiyang, 98th place ...”

What an embarrassing ranking!

The Song Qiyang who was known as the Three-star disciples’ number one person actually almost could not even enter the second round.

If Song Qiyang knew that this was Ye Yuan specifically instructing Ning Siyu to not let him be eliminated in the first round, who knew what he would think.

Head Elder’s lineage, each and every one of their faces were incomparably gloomy.

Especially Head Elder, he was no longer able to maintain a calm state as well, completely collapsing on the inside.

Song Qiyang gritted his teeth hard, his face red.

Today, his face could be said to be utterly lost.

He never dreamed that he actually fell close to 100th place today, and he almost could not even enter the second round!

This was simply unprecedented humiliation!

Looking at the smiles on the Second Elder’s lineage’s faces, Song Qiyang secretly gnashed his teeth in hatred. “You guys be smug then! The two rounds at the back, I’ll make you all return it both capital and interest!”

The atmosphere on the stands was somewhat awkward.

Head Elder’s side was domineering, the other elders mostly did not dare to offend.

Hence, even though the Second Elder’s side had a great victory, nobody dared to go up to congratulate either.

Hence, everyone kept their faze low and heads down, no one said anything.

But these elders were still rather grateful to Second Elder and Ning Siyu in their hearts.

Head Elder’s side overwhelmed people with numerical strength, so the others originally could not get much slots to go to the next round.

But now, Ning Siyu stirring things up like this, many strong rivals on Head Elder’s side were unexpectedly eliminated. This also allowed the other elders’ disciples to pick up many places for free.

Regarding this, they were naturally happy to see it happen.

“Hahaha, Little Junior Sister, you’re really too incredible!”

“A scholar who has been away three days must be looked at with new eyes! Little Junior Sister, your improvement during these 10 days is simply too terrifying!”

Lu Yi also extended a thumbs up and praised, “Little Junior Sister, you’re amazing! With your present fire controlling arts, even Eldest Senior Brother, I, don’t dare to say that I can definitely win! Master Ye is truly remarkable. He only used 10 days and he let Little Junior Sister be remolded anew!”

Ning Siyu pouted and said unhappily, “Eldest Senior Brother, it’s Little Junior Sister’s talent! My talent that’s extraordinary, alright?! You find a piece of wood for Master Ye, see if he can teach it.”

Lu Yi laughed in spite of himself and said, “Don’t say that! If I give Master Ye a piece of wood, he might really be able to groom an Alchemy Dao expert out!”

“You!” Ning Siyu stamped her feet angrily, making everyone laugh out loud.

After laughing hard, Ding Xun suddenly asked curiously, “Little Junior Sister, divulge it for us, what kind of special training did Master Ye give you these few days, to actually let your fire controlling art improve to such a degree?”

Ning Siyu’s pupils constricted and could not resist shuddering.

Very clearly, these 10 days of bitter experience was not that pleasant for her.

It could ... even use the word terrifying to describe the experience!

“Second Senior Brother, you don’t ask anymore! If you’re interested, why not go and beg Master Ye? Let him train you!” Ning Siyu said.

The group of senior brothers exchanged glances, but they all realized that these 10 days, Little Junior Sister probably lived a life that was inhumane.

They really could not imagine that their little junior sister who had always feared suffering was actually able to endure such a fiendish training.

But since Little Junior Sister could bear it, they could naturally bear it.

Upon thinking of Little Junior Sister’s transcendent fire controlling arts, the senior brothers’ gazes became heated.

To an alchemist, fire controlling art was too important.

Fire controlling art being a degree stronger, the quality of the medicinal pill might be a degree stronger!

“Now, the protectors get in position and undergo the first round fire competition’s contest!” shouted a deacon.

This fire competition was divided into two groups. The protectors also had to fight for the spot to enter the Pill Tower.

In the end, this round, Lu Yi was slightly inferior and was overpowered by Rou Xu’s head disciple, finally winning back a round.

Except, Lu Yi’s fire controlling arts made Rou Xu’s head disciple break out in cold sweat from fright too.

Seeing Ye Yuan refine pills the last time, the improvement of Lu Yi was all-round.

Presently, his strength was more than a level stronger than before.

After the protectors’ fire competition ended, the second round’s Dao Development was going to begin very soon.
