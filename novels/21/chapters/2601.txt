Chapter 2607: Yes, I’m Very Powerful!

On top of the mountain, snow gleamed white, with floating clouds coiling, akin to a wonderland.

The party arrived at Xianyun Mountain, which was also at the foot of the Holy Mountain.

“The Land of Exile indeed has talented people remaining in concealment. I didn’t expect that there’s still such a formation path expert!” Ye Yuan suddenly stopped and said with a faint smile.

In front of him was a huge array formation, interlinked and connected.

Not only was Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao already perfected, it even transformed into the All-Encompassing Sacred Tree now. Just slightly trying to feel it and he already detected it.

His All-Encompassing Sacred Tree was not transformed from the path of Sword Dao, but the Universe Sword Formation!

Inside the Universe Sword Formation, it contained sword, space, formation, these three Daos!

The strength was more discernible for this kind of transformation.

As for time rule, after Ye Yuan ascended, he had been unable to open up a new prospect all along. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Not because his comprehension ability was lacking, but that the time rule he comprehended in the Heavenspan World was simply in disorder!

The Heavenspan World’s flow rate of time was completely different from the 33 Heavens.

Ye Yuan reckoned that there might be Yan Jadetrue’s work involved.

“Those who trespass the Holy Mountain will be killed without mercy! Get lost!”

Right at this time, a melodious voice reverberated throughout heaven and earth, akin to heavenly thunder rolling, stirring people’s souls.

These words seemed to be said by Heaven!

Behind Ye Yuan, the countenances of Lin Tong and the rest changed visibly.

“Your Excellency, you’ve already arrived at the Holy Mountain. How about you go in alone, and those of us who haven’t achieved Great Dao Transformation withdraw for the time being?” Lin Tong said with a slightly pale face.

This voice seemed to be a celestial deity descending, giving him enormous pressure.

The other few people were also the same.

But Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Already here; don’t you want to go up the mountain to take a look?”

Lin Tong smiled bitterly and said, “Of course I want to, but this lowly one wants to live even more.”

“Limit you all to quickly leave within three breaths! Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself! Three!” While talking, that voice came over again.

The expressions of Lin Tong and the rest turned deathly pale, turning around, wanting to escape.

“Playing tricks! Go!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort. Holding his palm out, a tiny sprout already emerged from his palm.

A piece of tender leaf flew out, directly striking somewhere in the void.

“Courting death!” A startled and furious voice came from the void.

But with a loud bang, a middle-aged man dressed in white robes was actually directly being shocked out, his appearance looking rather ragged.

His gaze was fixed on Ye Yuan, with a hint of dread in the shock.

This brat actually saw through the weak area of the array formation with one glance and shocked him out with a sword.

Terrifying!

While Lin Tong and the rest who were behind Ye Yuan had dumbstruck faces.

It turned out that this guy was not empty talk!

He was really a lunatic!

Who would enter the Holy Mountain like this?

However, the combat power that Ye Yuan displayed still made them incredibly shocked.

The saints who guarded the mountain were all transformation powerhouses. Furthermore, they were even hiding in the grand array.

Ye Yuan found him with one glance and even shocked him out with a sword.

If it were any other transformation powerhouse, they probably would not be able to do it!

The middle-aged man in a white robe stared at Ye Yuan as he said with an unkind expression, “Brat, do you think that by comprehending Great Dao Transformation, you’re invincible under the heavens?”

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said with a smile, “Yeah.”

The middle-aged man’s face turned black, almost tumbling to the ground.

This brat really knew how to climb up the rope hand over hand!

The middle-aged man sneered and said in a solemn voice, “Someone who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Do you know that there are several hundred transformation powerhouses on this Holy Mountain!”

Even if Lin Tong and the rest were very knowledgeable and experienced, they were also frightened by this number.

They thought that there were at most several dozen people on this Holy Mountain.

They did not expect that there were actually hundreds of transformation powerhouses!

They could not help worrying whether Ye Yuan’s action of barging into the mountain would arouse the public outrage of the transformation powerhouses.

Unexpectedly, Ye Yuan just said coolly, “So what if several hundred? What bullshit transformation powerhouse, aren’t you also just a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum? Do you really think that you’re some whatever bullshit saint? Where did this sense of superiority come from?”

The middle-aged man saw that Ye Yuan was impervious to reason and could not help saying in a great rage, “Punk, you’re courting death!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Is that so? Then I want to see how you make me die!”

He had not even spoken yet and this person was playing tricks here, telling people to scram.

With an appearance like he was number one in the world, it would be weird if Ye Yuan’s attitude could be good.

The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes and said in a solemn voice, “Brat, I was just sneak attacked by you earlier. Do you really think that you’re very formidable?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said nonchalantly, “Yes, I’m very powerful!”

The middle-aged man gave a cold snort. Holding his palm out, a halberd condensed and formed!

His Great Dao Transformation form was a weapon. This was also one of the most commonly seen transformation methods.

It was only to see him smile coldly. He said, “Boy, I’ve already reached Great Dao Transformation 50 years ago. With just the likes of you, this sort of fellow who just comprehended it, you also dare to contend for glory with the bright moon?”

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “Is that so? Then try receiving a sword cut of mine! Go!”

The tender leaf turned into a light sword once more, chopping towards the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man was furious, brandishing the painted Chinese halberd in his hand, directly chopping towards the green leaf.

Boom!

In an instant, the two transformation weapons clashed!

The middle-aged man spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, his figure flying out backward.

While Ye Yuan did not budge an inch.

“I-It broke!” Lin Tong’s eyes were full of amazement.

The halberd in the middle-aged man’s hands actually broke under this strike!

With Great Dao Transformation, the object transformed was even tougher than material objects!

But now, it actually broke under Ye Yuan’s one strike!

Furthermore, the transformed object was connected to the mind of the martial artist.

Now that it broke, the middle-aged man already suffered a great loss in vitality, suffering serious injuries.

Most likely, without eight to ten years, he could forget about recovering his vitality!

They had long known that Ye Yuan’s strength was extremely formidable, but this … was also too outrageous, right?

He had already comprehended Great Dao Transformation for 50 years, while Ye Yuan only had three years at the very most!

Now, he actually defeated the enemy with one move!

This was also too strong!

Ye Yuan looked at the middle-aged man and said disdainfully, “Just the likes of you are also called the bright moon? Over 50 years and you only cultivated this bit of strength? Go find a piece of tofu to commit suicide with. I can’t even be bothered to kill you!”

This middle-aged man’s Great Dao Transformation was not perfect at all.

He could not even achieve perfection it in 50 years; he was really incredibly stupid!

Ye Yuan only used one year and perfected it.

Furthermore, what this middle-aged man comprehended was a single rule. But what he comprehended was three great fused rules. The difficulty was not on the same level at all.

He could not even perfect it in 50 years. He should really go find a piece of tofu to commit suicide with.

“Puhwark!”

The middle-aged man was choked badly by Ye Yuan’s words and spewed out another mouthful of old blood.

“The few of you, come with me!”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to pay attention to the middle-aged man and left leisurely, directly passing through the grand array.

This array formation was not too complicated to him. It could be easily broken.

However, this scene was even more shocking and inexplicable when it landed in the middle-aged man’s eyes.

Which crevice in a rock did this boy pop out from?

Coming to the Holy Mountain, what on earth did he want to do?

Lin Tong and the rest had upset expressions on their faces and could only pluck up their courage and follow after.
