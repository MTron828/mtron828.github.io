Chapter 2097: What Are You Happy About?

Vast Wind, Tian Jue, and the rest had blank expressions. Was this Empyrean Divine Scorpion in front of them really that Divine Scorpion that they knew?

This Empyrean Divine Scorpion was an existence that did not give in to anyone.

But now, he was submissive and obedient toward Ye Yuan. They simply could not believe their eyes.

“Ye Yuan, this Empyrean is considered defeated today! I only beg that you take into account that we’re of the same human race and let us leave!” Empyrean Vast Wind gritted his teeth and said.

Although he gave in, the resentful look in Empyrean Vast Wind’s gaze flashed past.

The other human Empyreans were also all sighing endlessly. The haughty and overbearing Empyrean Vast Wind actually lowered his head toward a True God Realm powerhouse.

They were all clear what kind of proud existence Empyrean Vast Wind was.

Such a person’s heart was loftier than the sky, how could he admit defeat?

Ye Yuan looked at Vast Wind and said with a faint smile, “Of course. This Ye isn’t a murderous person. The rest can all leave, but only you and Empyrean Windlike will probably have to stay here forever.”

Empyrean Vast Wind’s face changed drastically when he heard that and looked at Ye Yuan with an alarmed and enraged face as he roared, “You’re ... despicable!”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “Despicable? Huhu, I warned you previously. It’s considered to have given you a chance, but it was you who didn’t cherish it. Since my identity is already leaked, do you think that I’d wait for you to come and take revenge?”

Ye Yuan and Lu-er’s identities were not a secret anymore. As long as Empyrean Vast wind inquired slightly, he would be able to know that he came from Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Being remembered by a Seventh Firmament Empyrean mighty expert day and night, even if Ye Yuan had formidable abilities, it was also hard to take comprehensive precautions.

Ye Yuan was not a person who murdered the innocent. The grudge between him and Vast Wind was just a personal grudge, so he did not wish to implicate too many outsiders.

After all, these were all the human race’s powerhouses. Once they all died here, the entire extreme north would probably be plunged into misery and suffering.

This kind of thing, Ye Yuan could not do it.

He surveyed the surroundings and said coldly, “Today’s matter is just the personal grudge between me and Vast Wind! Those who don’t want to die, hurry up and get lost for me!”

The group of Empyreans exchanged glances, Vast Wind gritted his teeth and said in a solemn voice, “Don’t get fooled by this brat’s sowing discord! He has clearly thrown his lots in with the demon race and wants to divide and destroy our extreme north’s human race!”

“Haha, Vast Wind, you saying these words is also insulting our intelligence too much! You want to drag us down the water together, no chance at all! This Empyrean was forced against my will to come here in the first place. Feng Tianyang dying is a good thing to us. Now, there’s someone taking care of you, we’re all too happy!” Empyrean Mie Yu said with a loud laugh.

“Vast Wind, you’ve played the tyrant in the extreme north for so many years! You finally came to an end! I, Zhen Huang, won’t be accompanying anymore.” Finished talking, Empyrean Zhen Huang directly shuttled into the void and disappeared.

With these two people taking the lead, the other Empyreans also left one after another.

Empyrean Tian Jue and the rest were unconvinced by Vast Wind to begin with. If not for him breaking through to be Seventh Firmament Empyrean and forcing these Empyreans to come here, they absolutely would not get involved in this matter.

Now, there was someone taking care of Vast wind, so they were all too eager.

From this, one could also tell that Vast Wind ruling the extreme north’s human race, what he relied on was just martial strength. There were not many people who sincerely followed him.

Looking at one Empyrean after another leaving, Empyrean Vast Wind was close to despairing.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Looks like your popularity isn’t too good. There’s not even one that stayed behind. Looks like you normally don’t enjoy popular support in the extreme north!”

Empyrean Vast Wind looked at Ye Yuan, gnashed his teeth in hatred, and roared furiously, “Damn little brute! Today, even if I die, this Empyrean will also slaughter you!”

Everyone did not predict that Empyrean Vast Wind would suddenly erupt.

How outrageous was the commotion once an Empyrean was enraged? Even Empyrean Huntwind did not react.

But he was a powerhouse on the same level as Empyrean Vast Wind after all. Even if he was half a beat slower, he also chased after in time.

It was only to see him suddenly slam a fist out, the imposing momentum swift and fierce to the extreme.

However, Empyrean Vast Wind did not avoid this punch. He torpedoed toward Ye Yuan at full strength.

All of a sudden, an energy undulation that blotted out the skies and covered the earth crushed over towards Ye Yuan frenziedly.

Bang!

It was only to hear a loud boom transmit over, Empyrean Vast Wind’s figure flew out like a kite with a broken string.

However, his palm already fired out too.

Although it was just a palm that was struck hastily, how powerful was the strength of a Seventh Firmament Empyrean?

Even if it was a casual palm, butchering True God Realm martial artists were also as easy as blowing off dust.

Seeing Empyrean Vast wind forcefully take a fist of his, Empyrean Huntwind felt his scalp tingle.

If Sacred Ancestor High Priest died at his place here, Sacred Ancestor High Priest would probably fly into a thunderous rage, right? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Careful, Second Sage!”

Empyrean Huntwind only had time to cry out in surprise, the palm already arriving!

Bang!

The place where Ye Yuan stood, space shattered, spiritual energy flying everywhere. An intense light shone until people could not open their eyes.

When the light dissipated, that place already did not have Ye Yuan’s figure long ago.

All of the demon race’s powerhouses felt their scalps tingle. Second Sage was killed by someone under their heavy encirclement?

This ... This was a sin!

Once Sacred Ancestor High Priest raged, the Northernmost Steppe would not have the blade of grass grow!

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! This Empyrean will kill you!”

Empyrean Huntwind roared at Empyrean Vast Wind, suddenly slamming a fist over.

Bang!

Forcefully receiving Huntwind’s punch, the current Empyrean Vast Wind was already seriously injured. How could he still be Huntwind’s match?

This punch, he forcefully withstood it again.

However, his face did not have any decadence, but instead burst out laughing as he said, “Haha ... cough cough ... hahaha, what bullshit Second Sage?! Didn’t he still die at this Empyrean’s hands? Tianyang, Father has ... cough cough ... avenged you!”

Empyrean Vast Wind started laughing free from inhibitions as he coughed blood.

Empyrean Huntwind bristled with anger, but to the Vast Wind who already had the will to die, his fury had no use at all.

A moment of carelessness let Second Sage die! He could not absolve himself from the blame!

“What are you happy about?” Right at this time, a faint voice sounded out in everyone’s ears, making Empyrean Vast Wind’s laughter abruptly stopped.

A young and handsome voice slowly stepped out, who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

Empyrean Huntwind’s eyes went wide, and he said in disbelief, “Lord Second Sage, you ... you didn’t die?”

The other demon race Empyreans also had astonished faces. Although that palm earlier was not strong, it was enough to one-shot an initial-stage Empyrean Realm powerhouse.

But Ye Yuan was completely unscathed!

“This ... How is this possible? That palm of mine clearly already hit you!” Empyrean Vast Wind had a blank face as he said in shock.

Ye Yuan shook his head slightly and said, “You don’t seem to know this, but Loneswan their spatial node technique, it was personally set up by me. With my spatial law attainments, even if there isn’t Huntwind they all around, it also won’t be easy for you to want to kill me, let alone that you can only ambush me while taking advantage of their inattentiveness? This degree of attack is indeed lethal to other True God Realms, but I laid down several dozen spatial nodes all around here. As long as my thoughts stir, I’ll be able to teleport away. How can it be that easy for you to want to kill me?”

“This ... This ...” Empyrean Vast Wind looked at Ye Yuan, his complexion ashen.

The palm that he risked his old life to exchange for actually did not even harm Ye Yuan’s hair!
