Chapter 1210: Unexpected Surprise!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Even three years, that is fine too!” Long Teng said with a look of anticipation.

Fang Tian had a look of anticipation too. At present, fiend calamity was erupting. Heavenly Fiendgod Kanuo’s strength was even greater than in the past. Having him die just like this, he was really not willing.

Moreover, he and Long Teng did not meet for 50 thousand years. They finally managed to reunite. He did not wish to be separated by life and death from here on as well.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “I have a pill formula in my hands. It is called Heavenly Fragrance Life Extending Pill. If ordinary martial artists consume it, extending longevity by 2000 years is no issue. It’s just that Senior Fang Tian’s current state, the effects are negligible. The spirit medicines that this pill formula requires are very rare too. I have the other spirit medicines in my hands. It’s just that one of the core medicines is a one-million-year-old Ghost Heavenly Incense. It’s hard to find in a short time.”

But Fang Tian laughed when he heard that and said, “These few years, in order to extend my life, this old man can be said to have employed every trick up my sleeves. If it’s spirit medicines, this old man found quite a few. I just happen to have this Ghost Heavenly Incense.”

Ye Yuan did not reveal a surprised expression. The Ghost Heavenly Incense was a life-extending medicine to begin with. He reckoned that Fang Tian should have it in his hands, that was why he would say it.

Otherwise, if they could not find the spirit medicines and he said this kind of thing, wouldn’t it be an empty dream?

When Fang Tian saw Ye Yuan’s expression, he immediately understood in his heart and secretly thought to himself what formidable wits this boy had!

He had always been paying attention to Ye Yuan. But his understanding of Ye Yuan was mostly on the surface.

Only now, after actually meeting Ye Yuan, did he know that this boy was truly very different.

Ye Yuan put away the Ghost Heavenly Incense and bid farewell to the two people. “The two of you catch up on old times first. Ye Yuan will be right back!”

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Fang Tian said with a vicissitude of emotion, “Old Partner, I had always prided myself on being exceptional. But only when I saw Ye Yuan did I know that there’s always someone better!”

Long Teng also stroked his beard and said with a smile, “Haha,

honestly, I’ve never believed that under this present Heavenly Dao, there’s still someone capable of surpassing you, all the way until I met Ye Yuan! You don’t know how arrogant he was when he challenged the Vast Heaven Pagoda back then. But I just couldn’t do anything to him. This boy is simply a freak, refreshing my understanding of him again and again. Even until now, I also dare not say that I completely understand him.”

Fang Tian roared with laughter when he heard that and said, “Hahaha ... with Ye Yuan around, perhaps my Divine Realm really have hope! It’s just too bad that he was born at the wrong time! If not for Heavenly Dao being deficient, he might be able to reach Senior Absolute Heaven, that kind of height!”

...

Two days later, the pill tribulation descended.

When Ye Yuan came out of the pill refinement room, it gave everyone a big fright.

The current Ye Yuan seemed to have had a great illness, looking very dispirited.

“Ye Yuan, you ...” Long Teng said in surprise.

But Ye Yuan himself did not care at all and grinned as he said, “This Heavenly Fragrance Life Extending Pill’s quality is a little better than I even imagined! Senior Fang Tian, quickly take it!”

Fang Tian received the medicinal pill and said with a touched expression, “Thank you, Ye Yuan!”

With Ye Yuan’s present realm, making himself like this when refining pills, it could be imagined how much effort he put in.

Probably even when refining pills for himself, Ye Yuan would not put so much effort either, right?

Fang Tian knew that this was Ye Yuan repaying him, and it was also out of respect towards him.

Of course, it was also likely on account of Long Teng’s face.

But without a doubt, Ye Yuan was a person who put ‘relationship’ above all!

Such a person was worthy entrusting to!

“Huhu, Senior is too polite! Extending your life until now, you suffered pain that ordinary people cannot imagine. It was all for the Divine Realm. Senior did earth-shaking major things that were unbeknownst to the public. Yet Senior doesn’t seek fame and wealth. Ye Yuan respects Senior deeply! It’s just a shame that Ye Yuan is powerless to save the situation,” Ye Yuan said regretfully.

Perhaps after cultivating Alchemy Dao to a certain boundary, one could really defy the heavens. But the current Ye Yuan was clearly not equipped with that kind of power.

A day later, Fang Tian completely refined the pill’s medicinal strength.

When he exited seclusion, Long Teng and Ye Yuan both looked at him with a look of anticipation.

The current Fang Tian, his complexion was much better than a few days ago.

On that close to zombified face earlier, now it actually had some additional color!

“How is it, Brother Fang?” Long Teng asked rather anxiously.

The specifics of what effects the medicinal pill had, only Fang Tian himself would know after he consumed it.

Fang Tian smiled mysteriously at this time but extended three fingers.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s face revealed a disappointed expression, and he said with a bitter smile, “In the end, can it only be three years?”

Long Teng was also depressed for a while but felt relieved very quickly. Patting Ye Yuan, he said, “Ye Yuan, you’ve already tried your best! With Brother Fang’s bodily condition, being able to extend longevity for three years is already a miracle.”

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Sigh, I thought that arcane insight rank ... would ultimately be a little better!”

But Fang Tian chuckled and said happily, “Who told you guys three years? 30 years! Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, your alchemy skills are simply heaven-defying! This old man’s battered body, you were actually even able to bring back from the dead! Truly broadened my horizons!”

Hearing these words, Ye Yuan himself was stunned too.

Long Teng was stupefied first, then was immediately overjoyed and said, “Brother Fang, really? You can’t tease this old man!”

Fang Tian laughed and said, “Bluff you for what! Ye Yuan only said three years’ time previously too. I didn’t harbor that much hope, feeling that being able to have one or two years is already very good. But, the more I refined the medicinal pill, the more shocked I became! This Heavenly Fragrance Life Extending Pill simply seizes the good fortune of heaven and earth. Not only did it recover most of the hidden injuries in my body, I even have 30 more years of lifespan out of thin air! How many years has it been, this old man has always suffered torment. Now, these pains were actually swept away clean! With this old man’s age, I even nearly jumped up just now!”

“Hahaha ... it’s really too great! Ye Yuan, you’re also too conservative. Is this wanting to give this old man a whopping big surprise?” Long Teng said with a look of surprise.

Ye Yuan himself also felt very surprised. But seeing Fang Tian and Long Teng like so, he felt very happy too.

“Huhu, honestly speaking, I myself felt very surprised too. The power of the Medicine God’s Soul Canon somewhat exceeds my imagination! However, Senior Fang Tian, you still can’t employ essence energy right now. Otherwise, even immortals can’t save you!” Ye Yuan said with an emotional sigh.

The more he dug into the Medicine God’s Soul Canon, the more Ye Yuan discovered the extensiveness and profoundness of this Divine Dao record.

Looks like his path of Alchemy Dao was also merely at the beginning!

Fang Tian smiled and said, “You can rest assured. This old man naturally knows this point. Previously giving Kanuo a heavy blow, I believe he won’t dare to anyhow make a move anymore either. At least, before his strength fully recovers, we should be safe!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “His strength already reached such a realm, it’s actually not fully recovered yet?”

Fang Tian said with vicissitudes of emotion, “A heavenly fiendgod’s strength is correspondent with Origin Deity Realm. This kind of existence, how could their strength be what we, mere mortals, are capable of imagining? In my view, his current strength at most also just recovered to around 70%. There’s still some distance away from full recovery!”
