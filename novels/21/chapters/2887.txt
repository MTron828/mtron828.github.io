Chapter 2893 Are You Trash or Not?

I-Isn’t that Ye Yuan?

Why did Bloodpromise have an obsequious appearance standing next to him?

This … This was too fantastical!

A human Saint Sovereign Heaven ran to the blood race, and even an origin realm Emperor Sakra Heaven had to be reverent and respectful towards him?

Ye Yuan naturally changed his appearance when he went to the blood race.

But, others did not know that that was Ye Yuan, but Feng Xiaotian knew!

Before leaving, Ye Yuan left with this appearance and this aura.

“C-Could it be that he’s … no, this is impossible, absolutely impossible!”

Suddenly, Feng Xiaotian seemed to have thought of something and could not help shuddering

He was going to defy this idea instinctively.

But, apart from that identity, why would an existence like Bloodpromise be so deferential and respectful towards him?

T-This was too shocking!

Originally, hearing the news that the new Blood Divine Son had arrived, Feng Xiaotian had despaired.

Although the Blood Divine Son’s strength was nothing to do, in this kind of war, the function of Saint Sovereign Heavens and True Sovereign Heavens were indispensable.

A squad of 200 people was sufficient to match up to an army of 30 thousand!

Moreover, there was still a blood race army of 200 thousand behind these 200 people!

But now, Ye Yuan stood in front of him, having become the blood race’s Blood Divine Son!

“That’s the blood race’s new Blood Divine Son? Looks nothing more than that!”

“Don’t underestimate him! You’re also aware of how many casualties the Saint Sovereign and True Sovereign Hundred Sons have caused us for so many years! This Blood Divine Son must be even more extraordinary!”

“This guy is really arrogant! He’s patrolling on top of the city walls so openly and brazenly. Does he really think that we don’t dare to kill him?”

……

In the city, many powerhouses revealed killing intent.

They had long already hated the blood race to the core.

Let alone that the people who came this time, their identities were extraordinary.

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, his brows furrowing slightly as he said in a cold voice, “There are at most 10 thousand over people in this South Qi Giant City! You can’t even take down such a city; Bloodpromise, you’re really a piece of trash!”

This was already not Ye Yuan’s first time calling him trash. Bloodpromise wished to smack Ye Yuan to death with one palm.

But sadly, he could not!

Ye Yuan scolded; he could only listen.

“Your Highness isn’t aware. These guys put up a stubborn resistance. It’s really a tough bone to bite on! After the great battle begins, Your Highness will know how stubborn these guys are!” Bloodpromise defended himself.

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said coolly, “Oh, is that so?”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s figure moved, and he actually rushed straight for South Qi Giant City.

Everyone was dumbfounded!

This … Did he go insane?

It was true that the blood race was powerful, but you, a Saint Sovereign Heaven, was this trying to defy the heavens?

Really think that after you became the Blood Divine Son, you became invincible under the heavens?

Please, one of their Emperor Realms could smack you to death with a slap, alright?

SI

Of course, Ye Yuan would not be foolish enough to go and assault Emperor Realms, he was going for the Heaven One main camp.

The main camp was separate from the Emperor Realms. Otherwise, once Emperor Realms fought, how could those under Emperor Realm still survive?

Seeing Ye Yuan make a move, many Heaven One Emperor Realms were eager for action.

Feng Xiaotian said nonchalantly without leaving a trace: “Although my Heaven One is weak, it’s also not what a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven can trample recklessly! Let him posture. This city lord wants to see how much capability this new Blood Divine Son has.”

Feng Xiaotian was absolutely paramount at South Qi Giant City.

The words that he said, there were naturally no one who refuted.

Moreover, these Emperor Realms were also quite interested in Ye Yuan, this Blood Divine Son.

What kind of genius could become the blood race’s Blood Divine Son?

Bloodpromise’s scalp tingled; was this fellow brain-damaged?

If the Blood Divine Son were to die here, he would not be able to clear his name even by jumping into the Yellow River!

However, seeing that Feng Xiaotian did not move either, he calmed down slightly.

Before entering the grand array, Ye Yuan gave Feng Xiaotian a look.

Seeing this look, Feng Xiaotian’s heart that had been tense for over 20 days, finally eased

up.

Although he did not spend a long time with Ye Yuan, they became the firmest of friends.

At this time, one look was enough!

He knew that Ye Yuan was telling him that he would settle the blood race’s side.

He did not know what kind of means Ye Yuan had, to be able to block an army of 200 thousand.

But he had faith in Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan actually became the Blood Divine Son. If not for seeing it with his own eyes, he would never have dreamed it, right?

This sort of thing already surpassed their understanding.

Even this kind of miracle happened, so what else did he have to not trust Ye Yuan?

Boom!

The city protecting grand array directly landed, and all kinds of terrifying attacks fell toward Ye Yuan.

That power made everyone’s complexions turn pale.

The direction of the main camp was the weak spot of the grand array, which was also to deal with some troops below Emperor Realm.

But, no matter how weak, it was sufficient to kill a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven too.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s body erupted with a brilliant blood light. A surge of origin power gushed forth, protecting him firmly in the center.

In a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan actually withstood the grand array and rushed into the main camp.

In the main camp, those soldiers were greatly astonished, charging toward Ye Yuan one after another.

Ye Yuan had a disdainful look as he said in a cold voice, “A bunch of ants also dare to stop this liege’s invincible might! Die for me!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s hands fired out rays of blood light.

Those Saint Sovereign Heavens, even some True Sovereign Heaven, died upon contact!

In a twinkle, Ye Yuan ‘killed’ nearly a hundred people!

Feng Xiaotian’s expression could not help ‘changing drastically’ at this time, saying in a fierce voice, “Bloodazure punk, this city lord is definitely going to tear you to shreds!”

However, at this time, Ye Yuan already pulled away, passing right through the grand array, returning to his own camp.

The blood race’s side was deathly silent!

This … was too impressive!

Rushing into the Heaven One’s main camp by himself and retreating unscathed after killing a hundred people!

What kind of terrifying strength was this?

Everyone’s gazes turned toward Bloodpromise with strange faces.

Just now, you said that this bone was very tough to bite?

Your words had yet to fade and His Highness already went to kill and came back.

This face was slapped resoundingly! The sound of face-slapping seemed to be traveling through the air.

Ye Yuan looked at Bloodpromise and said coolly, “This is the tough bone that you said was hard to chew on?”

Bloodpromise had a look of embarrassment as he said, “Y-Your Highness’s invincible might is unmatched. Bloodpromise is far inferior!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Inferior? This liege said that you’re trash, but you weren’t convinced. Now, do you think you’re trash or not?”

“I-I’m trash!” Bloodpromise wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

Too freaking embarrassing!

You, Bloodpromise, led an army of several hundred thousand and failed to invade after attacking for many centuries.

The moment Blood Divine Son His Highness came, he breached it on his own!

Although it was just circling one round and casually killed a few people, this was a crazy face-slapping act to Heaven One, a wild show of contempt!

Could he, Bloodpromise, do it?

Whatever Heaven One was powerful, whatever put up a stubborn resistance, it was utter rubbish! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the end, he was a piece of trash!

“Your Highness is mighty!”

“Your Highness’ divine might is unparalleled!”

“The blood race will unify Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven today!”

……

Waves of cheering erupted behind Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s slight display of skill directly boosted the blood race’s morale to the extreme.
