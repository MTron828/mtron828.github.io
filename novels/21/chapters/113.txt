Chapter 114: What Has It Got to Do with you?!

Translator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessor

"Yishan, leave it at this . . ."

Right after this voice sounded out, Su Yishan was abruptly awakened. His aura also withdrew after that, vanishing imperceptibly.

Seeing that Su Yishan’s Heaven Flipping Palm was stopped, not only did Ye Yuan not relax, his face turned even graver.

Those Heaven Rank students automatically opened up a path, and Su Yubai walked out from the crowd.

Everyone was stupefied. The one who stopped Su Yishan was actually Su Yubai?

What happened? Didn’t Su Yubai hope for Ye Yuan to die most of all? Why did his character suddenly change?

Su Yishan slowly walked to the front of Ye Yuan and the other two. Su Yishan and Wu Luochen respectfully bowed, and called out "Elder Su." Only Ye Yuan remained indifferent.

"Humph! Don’t even know how to greet when you see me. Indeed without upbringing!" Seeing Ye Yuan’s behavior, Su Yubai’s temper flared right away.

Ye Yuan simply replied nonchalantly, "I’ve cleared the Nine Heavens Road, and already have status equivalent to the Tranquil Cloud Sect’s core disciples. The Tranquil Cloud Sect’s core disciple’s status is even higher than outer sect elders. The one who should be greeting . . . should be Elder Su, right?"

The Tranquil Cloud Sect’s core disciples had an extraordinary status. They were all one in a million geniuses and were also the target of the Tranquil Cloud Sect’s heavy nurturing. They possessed many privileges.

On the other hand, outer sect elders were at most just supervisors assisting the dean to manage the academy. They did not even count as sect disciples. So their status was naturally not as high as core disciples.

Hearing that, Su Yubai’s face changed. He immediately gave a cold snort and said, "The high sect had not yet confirmed your status, so you are still the State of Qin’s Dan Wu Academy’s disciple. Don’t give me the attitude of some core disciple!"

Ye Yuan curled his lips and said, "It’s Elder Su who is putting on the airs on an elder with me. So I just have to make clear of my current status."

Su Yubai sorrowfully discovered that he could never gain any advantage over Ye Yuan, so he could only change the topic. "Where did the spirit artifact in your hand come from? Such a precious artifact and you actually did not report to the academy. What are your intentions?"

Su Yubai also did not expect that Ye Yuan actually have a spirit artifact in his hands!

This truly made him incredibly envious!

Su Yubai’s own lifeblood weapon was a high-grade magic artifact. Initially, it was also suitable for him.

But Su Yubai was already a half-step Crystal Formation Realm. If he used a spirit artifact, it would definitely let his strength rise to another level.

Originally, he did not think much about spirit artifacts, because spirit artifacts were too scarce.

But now, a spirit artifact actually appeared in Ye Yuan’s hands. How could he remain unperturbed?

For a puny little Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm to use a spirit artifact, wasn’t that wasting God’s gift?

How could Ye Yuan not know Su Yubai’s little thoughts? Hearing that, he only said coolly, "You know that I swore a Heaven Dao Oath before challenging the Nine Heavens Road. So it’s inconvenient for me to report about the origins of this sword. If Elder Su is uneasy, then you can inquire from the high sect. This sword should have once had illustrious fame. I believe it wouldn’t be hard to enquire."

High sect! High sect again!

Using high sect to suppress me right?

Su Yubai despondently discovered that he really could not do anything about it.

Since Ye Yuan dared to openly take this sword out, it showed that there was definitely no issues with its origins.

Although Ye Yuan said nothing, he already indicated the source of this sword, Nine Heavens Road!

Came from the Nine Heavens Road? Then this would be easy!

"Since this sword came from the Nine Heavens Road, how can you keep it for yourself? The Nine Heavens Road belongs to the Nine Heavens Road. Since you acquired the spirit artifact on the Nine Heavens Road, you should pass it to the academy to deal with it!"

Ye Yuan chuckled. "Pass to the academy to deal with it? It’s pass to Elder Su to handle, right? Just be candid about wanting the spirit artifact. What’s with so many detours?"

Su Yubai’s Face Thickness Divine Art had clearly been cultivated to an extremely high realm. He did not show any embarrassment after having his thoughts exposed by Ye Yuan.

"This elder is devoted to public interests. Don’t try to slander me! After your spirit artifact is passed to the academy, how to deal with it would naturally be up to the dean and the Elders Council to decide. This spirit artifact originally came from the academy, how can you keep it all to yourself?"

Su Yubai said it with a strong sense of righteousness. Except, who knew how many people actually would fall for that.

"Elder Su’s public spirit is truly touching. But . . . according to what I know, the Nine Heavens Road doesn’t seem to be under the jurisdiction of the academy? Even if I have to hand it up, it will also be passed to the sect. What has it got to do with you?!" Ye Yuan did not hold back his words at all.

"You! Courting death!" Su Yubai was so angered by Ye Yuan that his seven souls were about to leave his body, and he looked as if he was about to make a move.

Ye Yuan jumped up instead, and yelled out, "Ahh! Elder Su wants to kill people! Everyone, be a witness for me!"

Su Yubai’s raging fire was instantly extinguished by Ye Yuan’s shout.

Ye Yuan’s current status was exceptional. If he were to really kill Ye Yuan in public, his elder position could be considered to have come to an end.

The charge of killing a high sect’s core disciple was not something he could shoulder.

He stopped Su Yishan naturally because of this reason as well. He did not think that a few sentences in, he was already swept in by Ye Yuan.

Su Yubai suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan was like a hedgehog, leaving him nowhere to bite. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

So aggrieving!

"Such utter nonsense! When did I want to kill people?" Su Yubai snorted icily.

"Do you dare to say that you didn’t have killing intent just now?" Ye Yuan made no concessions at all.

". . . . . ."

Su Yubai had no words to say to that. He switched topic once again. "Forget about that first. I heard that you want to bring away this female student for a private interrogation. Do you know that you are setting up a clandestine tribunal?"

"Clandestine tribunal? Then let me ask you, what’s the charge for offending a core disciple? You, Elder Su, can say that my status is not yet authentic, but Liu Ruoshui doesn’t have that qualification, right?" Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

"This . . . Offending a core disciple, severe cases can be the death penalty. But according to what I know, she doesn’t seem to have offended you?" Su Yubai said.

"How do you know that she did not offend and that it wasn’t sophistry?" Ye Yuan retorted.

"Lin Tiancheng and Zhang Heng were already killed by you. This matter has no other witnesses. You aren’t going to rely just on your guesswork to sentence her crime, right?" Su Yubai smiled coldly.

"I said just now, I have my ways of making her talk. If she didn’t take part in this matter, then the grudges between us will be wiped off the slate! If she feels dissatisfied, I can even apologize to her publicly!"

"What a joke! What method do you have to make her talk? Don’t tell me you want to beat a confession out of her?"

Ye Yuan said casually, "I’m afraid that Elder Su has done quite a bit of those sort of things, right? However . . . I’m not as ruthless as Elder Su, so I’m unable to do those sort of malicious things."

Su Yubai’s wrath had just subsided when it was evoked by Ye Yuan again.

This punk was really someone that exasperated people to death without paying for it.

Forcefully suppressing the fury in his heart, Su Yubai said in a low voice, "Who in the Dan Wu Academy doesn’t know that this elder enforces the law impartially? Right now, we’re talking about you. Why did you come onto me?"

"Like that huh? Fine then. I know that Elder Su is ignorant and ill-informed. I wonder if you have ever heard of a type of medicinal pill called the Truth Pill? En . . . Looking at your appearance, you must be unaware. Let me explain it for Elder Su. A Truth Pill is a Tier 2 medicinal pill. If Liu Ruoshui eats it, she will answer anything I ask. At that time, the truth will naturally be revealed."

Ye Yuan explained about the Truth Pill, and also made a quip at Su Yubai . . .
