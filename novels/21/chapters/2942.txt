Chapter 2941: Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell!

“I didn’t expect that this time, it’s actually Junior Apprentice Sister Cloudneon personally leading the team!”

Before everyone landed, a young man who was far from being handsome came forward to greet, doing his utmost to please and woo.

Ye Yuan could not resist rolling his eyes.?Did you not have any idea what you look like?

Sure enough, Cloudmount’s expression seemed to turn a few degrees colder as she said coldly, “Brother Shan Yang, time is tight. Since everyone is here, let’s start right away!”

Mountain?goat1?

Uh, this name is pretty good, matching the person.

Didn’t this person look just like a mountain goat?

When Mountain Goat saw that Cloudneon had an attitude of keeping people a thousand miles away, he could not help saying rather awkwardly,?“Haha,?what Junior Apprentice Sister Cloudneon says is right. Then … let’s begin?”

The others also laughed secretly in their hearts. It was just that this Mountain Goat was an origin major power of the Central Soul Region. His strength was almost on par with Cloudneon. There was naturally no one who dared to laugh.

The people leading the teams from the other three regions were all origin major powers too, coming forward to greet one after another.

One could also tell from their attitudes that Cloudneon’s status in the Imperishable Soul Domain was extremely high!

Ye Yuan swept a glance and discovered that the five great regions added up, the Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physiques actually had close to 200 people.

With this, everything was clear.

It was completely worthless!

Mountain Goat led everyone and arrived under a glazed pagoda.

This glazed pagoda had a total of seven floors, each level with a different color.

“This Seven-Colored Pagoda is a chaos heavenly treasure! Back then, Progenitor Imperishable created it in order to search for a second Imperishable Physique. It’s just a pity that nobody could become the second Hegemon Imperishable! The Seven-Colored Pagoda has not been opened up for 100 thousand years already. This time, Hegemon Imperishable had a sudden impulse to accept a disciple. You all are also considered blessed people!” Mountain Goat said.

Hearing this, many people were extremely excited.

It was as if Progenitor Imperishable’s disciple had already been decided to be them.

However, Ye Yuan also saw a purpled-robed young man in the Central Soul Region’s team whose expression was very calm.

Ye Yuan understood in his heart that this person had probably already known about Progenitor Imperishable.

“Progenitor Imperishable left a trace of Soul Dao origin inside! What you all have to do is to find it and fuse with this trace of origin! As long as someone fuses with the origin, they will be able to become Progenitor Imperishable’s disciple! Understood?” Mountain Goat continued.

“Fusing origin! Doesn’t that mean that I’ll be an origin powerhouse in Emperor Cloud Heaven?”

“Progenitor Imperishable’s origin! This is a massive opportunity!”

“This Soul Dao origin is mine. Nobody is allowed to snatch from me!”

… …

As soon as they heard this, all the Pseudo Imperishable Physiques went crazy.

This kind of massive opportunity was far too tempting for them.

Ye Yuan could not resist rolling his eyes.?These guys are also too naive, right?

If this power of origin was so easy to fuse, would the Seven-Colored Pagoda still be here perfectly fine?

Finished saying, Mountain Goat looked towards the purple-robed young man and said meaningfully, “Wang Qian, Progenitor Imperishable has pinned high hopes on you! Entering the Seven-Colored Pagoda this time, you have to perform well!”

The purple-robed young man bowed and said, “Martial Uncle, rest assured. Wang Qian definitely won’t fail the mission?”

Mountain Goat nodded with a slight smile, his goat face growing longer.

When the Seven-Colored Pagoda opened up, Ye Yuan felt that his mist body seemed to have been ignited!

Those Pseudo Imperishable Physiques rushed inside impatiently.

Especially Bai Cuishan, he practically rushed inside with howls.

Wang Qian gave Ye Yuan a glance and also walked in.

Ye Yuan was just about to go, but then Cloudneon shouted, “Ye Yuan!”

Ye Yuan did not turn back and waved his hand and said, “Alright, alright, so much crap! Relax, I want to find Progenitor Imperishable more than you!”

Finished saying, he went straight into the Seven-Colored Pagoda.

The moment these words came out, the expressions of the few big shots all changed drastically.

This brat actually knew?

“Younger Sister Cloudneon! How can you leak the matter in advance?” “”West Soul Region’s team, an old woman questioned.

Cloudneon just said coolly, “Doesn’t Wang Qian know too?”

The old man said in a solemn voice, “How is that the same? Wang Qian he’s Progenitor Imperishable’s lineage heir in the first place!”

Cloudneon gave her a glance and said, “If I said it, I said it, so what about it?”

“You!” The old woman was angered until she billowed smoke from all seven orifices but was helpless to do anything.

At this time, Mountain Goat came over to smooth things over, saying with a smile,?“Huhu,?if it’s said, it’s said, there’s no big deal. Young Sister Cloudneon naturally won’t betray the ancestor. It’s just that … Young Sister Cloudneon seems to be very optimistic about this kid!”

Cloudneon nodded her head and said, “If someone can really fuse with the origin, it can only be him!”

But Mountain Goat smiled and said, “Doesn’t Younger Sister Cloudneon know that before the progenitor went missing, he already had the intention of letting Wang Qian enter the Seven-Colored Pagoda? Where did this kid pop out from?”

Cloudneon said coolly, “If you don’t believe me, just wait and see!”

But the old woman sneered and said, “Do you think that only your East Soul Region can find geniuses? Our West Soul Region’s Zhou Yan similarly has the strength to fuse with the origin!”

The other two chuckled, clearly quite confident in the people that they brought.

… …

Dong!

In the first level space, a drumming sound suddenly came over.

Ye Yuan only felt that his soul physique was shocked by this noise until it was about to collapse and dissipate.

Far away, a miserable cry came over. Clearly, the soul body had already been scattered.

“Can’t even withstand the Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell! Just based on your paltry skills and you also want to obtain the origin?” A mocking voice came from behind Ye Yuan.

Turning around to look, who could it be if not Wang Qian?

Clearly, Wang Qian had also discovered him in the crowd.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “Since the Central Soul Region called everyone over, it shows that their confidence in you is still lacking, isn’t that so?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Wang Qian’s pupils constricted, and he said in a cold voice, “You’re courting death!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you feel that you can kill me, you can come and try.”

This Wang Qian was merely a lower Emperor Cloud Heaven too.

It was simply impossible to kill him.

Therefore, Ye Yuan did not take him seriously either.

Wang Qian’s gaze turned cold, and he said with a cold smile, “Don’t need me to take action. You can’t even withstand the Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell. You’ll be wiped out by the Seven-Colored Pagoda very soon!”

Dong!

Right at this time, another drumming sound occurred.

This sound seemingly wanted to enter people’s bone marrows.

Ye Yuan’s soul body actually started to show signs of dissipation under this drumming.

Wang Qian’s soul body was clearly much stronger. He was not affected at all.

He looked at Ye Yuan, snickering to no end.

“Huhu,?a toad wanting to eat swan meat; it’s talking about you, right? Savor the taste of the Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell well!” As he said these words, Wang Qian leaped and disappeared.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, seemingly pondering about something.

Not far away, many people were directly scattered under this Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell.

However, the Pseudo Imperishable Physique was an Imperishable Physique too. They recovered back to new very quickly.

It was just that their soul bodies did not seem to be as condensed as before anymore.

This made Ye Yuan certain that the Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell could kill people!

But this was clearly a land of inheritance. Why did it want to kill people?
