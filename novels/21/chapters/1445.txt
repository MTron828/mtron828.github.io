Chapter 1449 Handing in Mission

Under the shade of trees, a group of students was currently chatting idly.

The object of conversation naturally could not do without those most talented students.

“Oh, right, the outer-court’s number one genius, Ye Yuan, has already not returned for over ten years. Heard that he took a trial-taking mission and went to a small world. It wouldn’t be that ... he can’t return anymore, right?”

“Heh, it’s not impossible! Normally, going out to train, it ranges between three years to five years and they’ll pretty much be back. Exceeding eight years, there were basically very few that returned.”

“Yeah, it’s already been over ten years, it likely bodes ill rather than well!”

“It’s a pity, with his talent, stepping into Divine Lord Realm is virtually a sure bet!”

“Heard that Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian went to experience and temper himself too. The two of them, one after another, is a little too coincidental! Furthermore ... Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian hasn’t returned until now too.”

“Shhh ... do you want to die?! How dare you say this kind of thing?!”

“Mn? You guys, look, that ... that is ...”

Everyone followed the gaze and looked over, and could not help being surprised.

Ye Yuan slowly walked in, looking very calm and collected.

The direction he was heading in was precisely the Merit Hall.

“It’s Ye Yuan! He ... He actually broke through to initial-stage Heaven Glimpse!”

“My God, this is also too freakish! This kind of cultivation speed is simply too terrifying!”

“I remember that when he went out, didn’t he just break through to late-stage Grotto Profound? It’s just been over ten years and he crossed over half-stop Heaven Glimpse, directly breaking through to the Heaven Glimpse Realm?”

“This guy’s talent is too frightening! He has entered the sect for less than 30 years and broke through from middle-stage Grotto Profound to initial-stage Heaven Glimpse. This kind of cultivation speed is simply too abnormal.”

...

The aura emanated by Ye Yuan made everyone extremely surprised.

Although those who entered Wu Meng Academy were geniuses among geniuses, those with cultivation speed like Ye Yuan were really one of its kind.

More importantly, not only did Ye Yuan’s realm advance extremely fast, but his strength was also daunting to the extreme, crushing those in the same rank!

Now that Ye Yuan broke through to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, it was equivalent to entering the inner-court.

This way, the inner-court’s situation would likely undergo a massive change.

“Go, let’s go and take a look just what mission Ye Yuan was carrying out! Wasn’t it said that small worlds’ spiritual energy is very sparse, very hard to break through realms? How in the world did this guy do it?”

Ye Yuan’s appearance immediately caused an uproar.

Quite a number of people followed suit, following Ye Yuan to the Merit Hall.

Regarding the matter of divulging Ye Yuan’s information, even if ten years had passed, Yu Jing had always taken it to heart.

A genius like Ye Yuan was destined to shake the Wu Meng Capital City, even an existence who was going to enter Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

But because of the Qin Family’s selfishness, such a prodigy perished in a small world. This was really something that made people choke with anger.

How much face did Ye Yuan gain for Wu Meng Capital City by defeating Jin Yu?

But now, he was going to die in the hands of a vile character.

But because of this matter, Yu Jing got quite a bit of benefit instead.

In secret, Qin Tianning gave Yu Jing considerable compensation.

At this time, a figure entered the Merit Hall. Yu Jing’s mood was somewhat irritable and said impatiently without even looking, “Go to the jade pillars there to find the mission first, then come find me when you’re done.”

“Senior Apprentice Brother, I’m here to hand in the mission.”

Only then did Yu Jing slightly raise his eyelids and looked at the arrival. But his expression abruptly changed and he quickly stood up.

“Y-Y-Ye Yuan! You ... You actually ... came back!”

Seeing Ye Yuan, Yu Jing was shocked until he was staring with his mouth agape.

Ye Yuan did not return for ten years. Yu Jing thought that Ye Yuan had long died under Qin Tian’s hands already.

But now, Ye Yuan actually returned in perfectly good condition. How could he not be shocked?

Ye Yuan looked at Yu Jing, his gaze slightly cold as he said with a smile that was not a smile, “Senior Apprentice Brother Yu seems to be very surprised seeing me return!”

At this time, the number of people outside the Merit Hall was swarming. Yu Jing startled awake very quickly, his expression somewhat unnatural as he said, “H-How so! I was just surprised. Junior Apprentice Brother Ye took a Three-star mission and actually completed it? Mn? You ... You broke through to Heaven Glimpse Realm!”

Buzz!

Yu Jing just happened to find a reason to deal with Ye Yuan but instantly ignited the outside. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Three-star mission! He actually drew a Three-star mission on his first time going out to train!”

“Got to be kidding! Three-star missions, the death rate for the simplest ones also exceed 50%! Ye Yuan actually completed the mission and came back!”

“This guy ... simply can’t be gauged with common sense! Freak! Freakish until he has no friends!”

“Other people all have narrow shaves going. Not only did he not die when he went, but he also broke through his realm instead!”

...

The people surrounding and watching outside the door directly blew up. A Grotto Profound Realm student actually went to take a Three-star mission!

Disregarding this, not only did Ye Yuan complete the mission, he even broke through a major realm and came back.

This ... Did he still want people to live?

Actually, the most shocked one was not those people outside, but Yu Jing!

Monstrous waves were surging in his heart right now!

He knew that Qin Tian went to the Sky Foothill World to hunt down Ye Yuan.

Now, Ye Yuan completed the mission and returned. What about Qin Tian?

In an instant, Yu Jing thought of many possibilities.

Could it be ... No way!

Even if Ye Yuan broke through to Heaven Glimpse Realm, it was also impossible to be Qin Tian’s match. He was a half-step Origin Deity powerhouse!

Furthermore, he heard that Qin Tian already suppressed his realm for very long. As long as he was willing, he could break through to the Origin Deity Realm at any time!

Very soon, Yu Jing rejected that most frightening thought.

Because this notion was too absurd.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was deep and serene, looking at Yu Jing meaningfully, and said with a faint smile, “Like that huh. This Ye had some minor gains in these ten years and broke through by a fluke. Senior Apprentice Brother Yu, this is the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit. My mission should be considered as completed, right?”

Yu Jing’s heart thudded, secretly thinking that things were bad.

Could it be that ... Ye Yuan really ran into Qin Tian and he already knew that it was me who divulged the information about his mission?

But if Ye Yuan really encountered Qin Tian, how did he return?

Also, where in the world did Qin Tian go?

A series of queries sounded out in Yu Jing’s heart. But the more he thought, the more he felt that there was no answer.

He totally could not guess what happened in the Sky Foothill World.

“H-Haha, of course it’s completed! Junior Apprentice Brother, hold on, I’ll clock the mission’s rewards into your academy token right now.”

Yu Jing did not dare to meet Ye Yuan’s eyes and laughed awkwardly, clocking the mission’s points into Ye Yuan’s academy token.

“Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, done. You’re really too incredible. Such a difficult mission, you, a Grotto Profound martial artist, actually completed it!” Yu Jing said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just a fluke.”

Ye Yuan put away the token, divided the crowd, and directly left.

The moment he left, the others immediately surrounded over.

“Senior Apprentice Brother Yu, just what Three-star mission did Ye Yuan draw?”

“Yeah, tell us.”

According to the academy’s rules, after a student completes the mission, the mission’s information could be disclosed.

Of course, apart from the coordinates.

Yu Jing was pestered badly. He could only smile bitterly and say, “It’s the number eight mission! What Ye Yuan drew was the number eight mission on the Three-star jade pillar!”

All those present were dead silent!
