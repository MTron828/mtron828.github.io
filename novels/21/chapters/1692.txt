Chapter 1696 Magic One Out for You

“Reporting to Lord Inspector, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City killed my Utmost Peace’s head elder inside a mystic realm with extremely shameless means, snatching away the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain! Head Elder Gao Yuan was the most promising to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm in our Utmost Peace Imperial City. This time, our Utmost Peace suffered heavy losses. Therefore, that’s why this lowly official activated the Golden Sword Token out of rage.”

“Lord Inspector, Qiao Anshan is making slanderous charges! Gao Yuan plotted to harm my Heavenly Eagle’s martial artists many times in the mystic realm and more than deserves death!”

...

The moment they came up, Qiao Anshan and Zuo Shujie engaged in a war of words.

Each side believed that they were correct, both sides having their merits.

But this kind of thing was clearly unable to distinguish between true and fake.

When the middle-aged man in azure heard ‘Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain,’ these few words, his brows raised up slightly, clearly somewhat surprised.

“Enough!”

When the middle-aged man in azure saw the two people quarrel without stopping, he could not help shouting in a low voice.

Sure enough, the two people did not dare to speak anymore.

The middle-aged man in azure said, “I didn’t expect that the Southridge Ten Cities, this kind of remote place, can actually give birth to a treasure like the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain. No wonder you all did not stint to activate the Golden Sword Pact for this! Since the Golden Sword Token is already issued, then follow the rules. The victor gets the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain!”

The middle-aged man in azure clearly saw it very clearly. This kind of debate, arguing for 10 thousand years and it was also hard to determine the winner.

The crux of the problem was the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain. Qiao Anshan’s goal for activating the Golden Sword Pact was clearly for the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain too.

It was no use fighting a war of saliva; there was only showcasing one’s true ability.

At this time, Qiao Anshan suddenly said, “Lord Inspector, we didn’t activate the Golden Sword Pact this time just for the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain. It’s also for a person!”

The inspector was slightly surprised as he said, “Oh? Who is it?”

Qiao Anshan said, “He’s called Ye Yuan, the main culprit who killed Head Elder Gao Yuan! If we win in the Golden Sword Pact this time, we still want Heavenly Eagle to hand this kid over!”

The inspector nodded his head when he heard that and said, “If you can win, you naturally have the final say.”

In the eyes of the inspector, only Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses could enter his arcane sights. The life and death of a Divine Lord, he would not go and pay attention at all.

Losing the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, would Heavenly Eagle still care about one person?

But Zuo Shujie’s expression changed and he said, “Qiao Anshan, you’re shameless!”

Qiao Anshan sneered and said, “Where’s Ye Yuan? In front of Lord Inspector, you wouldn’t want to hide him, right? Or is it that that kid is already scared until he doesn’t dare to come out?”

“Yeah, you’re too ugly, scaring this elder badly until I don’t even dare to come out.c

Right then, a languid voice suddenly sounded out. Ye Yuan’s figure stepped on the air and arrived.

“Puchi!”

Ye Yuan’s words immediately aroused a burst of laughter.

Qiao Anshan was very short and his appearance very ugly. It was indeed somewhat frightening.

Qiao Anshan was greatly enraged the moment he heard and said, “Brat, you’re courting death!”

Ye Yuan still had a lazy expression as he said coolly, “The Golden Sword Pact hasn’t started yet and you want to make a show of authority already? Do you have any respect for Lord Inspector?”

Qiao Anshan’s expression changed and indeed did not dare to make a move anymore.

Ye Yuan gave a bow to the inspector and saluted as he said, “Heavenly Eagle’s Ye Yuan, pays respect to Lord Inspector.”

A hint of surprise briefly flashed across the inspector’s eyes. He discovered to his surprise that with his strength, he actually could not quite see through this young man!

This kid was not simple!

Virtually at once, the inspector drew a conclusion about Ye Yuan.

The inspector asked with some confusion, “You’re Ye Yuan? Qiao Anshan said that it was you who killed Utmost Peace’s head elder, Gao Yuan?”

Logically speaking, with Ye Yuan’s realm, it was impossible to kill Gao Yuan.

Who knew that Ye Yuan nodded his head, admitted it very shamelessly, and said “Gao Yuan that guy wanted to kill me time and again. In the end, his strength was lacking and was quashed by me using the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain instead. Inside mystic realms, killing people and snatching treasures is a common occurrence, what’s the big deal? Qiao Anshan, if you want the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, say it open and aboveboard; want to be a prostitute and also want to set up a memorial archway, your heart is indeed as ugly as your face!”

Qiao Anshan’s face turned from green to yellow. He discovered that he really was not Ye Yuan’s match in arguments.

At this rate, he would be angered to death by Ye Yuan for sure.

Qiao Anshan glared at Ye Yuan and said, “Razor-tongued little basted! Wait till the Golden Sword Pact is over, I’ll see if your mouth can still be glib or not!”

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “Is it just two more people in the Celestial Deity Realm? Look at how you’re showing off!”

Mentioning Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses, Qiao Anshan finally found a reason to be proud of himself and said with a big laugh, “What reason do I have to not show off? The strong reigns supreme! An ant-like person like you only has the right to be trampled underfoot by this seat! If you have the capability, magic out two more Celestial Deity Realms for me! Hahaha!”

Ye Yuan looked at Qiao Anshan like looking at an idiot and suddenly reached his hand out and pointed, pointing in the direction of the Martial Tower, and said coolly, “Ugly, you look closely. I’ll magic one out for you right now!”

Qiao Anshan’s expression changed, looking in the direction that Ye Yuan pointed, but there was no activity at all. His face could not help turning dark as he said, “Little bastard, you dare to toy with me?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Toy with you? You take a look again.”

Qiao Anshan turned his head again and still did not discover any movements.

He was practically about to lose it!

Qiao Anshan could not wait for a moment longer. He swore in his heart and he must kill Ye Yuan.

Qiao Anshan gnashed his teeth in hatred and looked at Ye Yuan as he said, “Little bastard, very good! You’re very good! After the Golden Sword Pact, you’ll know what’s called a life worse than death!”

Ye Yuan had a wide grin and looked at Qiao Anshan as he said, “You take a look again, really magicked them out!”

“Little bastard, are you done?! Lord Inspector, this lowly official requests to immediately start the Golden Sword Pact!” Qiao Anshan was virtually about to break down and said to the inspector. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

But he waited for a long time and the inspector did not even move.

Lifting his head and looking, Qiao Anshan discovered that the inspector had a solemn look, and the direction that he was looking in was precisely the direction of the Martial Tower, which was also the direction that Ye Yuan pointed at.

Qiao Anshan was alarmed inwardly and instinctively turned his head to look, his expression instantly changing drastically.

It was only to see that the original peaceful Martial Tower actually raged with a fierce storm at this time.

Violent spiritual energy poured over in that direction frenziedly.

This commotion was clearly someone breaking through to Celestial Deity Realm!

R-Really magicked out?

It was only to see a figure fly out of the Martial Tower, standing high in the sky, absorbing spiritual energy frantically.

That commotion was extremely shocking.

“That ... That’s Coldfeather! How ... How is it possible? He ... He broke through too!” Wen Yilin cried out strangely and shouted in disbelief.

Wen Yilin was not foreign to Coldfeather. They were geniuses in the same era and had once contended for a long time in secret.

It was just that the final result was that Wen Yiling stepped into the Celestial Deity Realm, while Coldfeather ended up missing.

Even though Coldfeather came back now, he was already no threat to Wen Yilin.

How could more than 100 thousand years of idling away be that easy to remedy?

Wen Yiling coming this time, he originally wanted to see Coldfeather and even chastise the latter a bit.

But who knew that what he waited for was this kind of result!
