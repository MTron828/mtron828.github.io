Chapter 2585: If It Can Soothe Ye Yuan’s Heart, It’s Worth It!

As a swordsman, they were arrogant and unyielding, their will billowing to the sky. They could not bear the sight of injustice in this world most of all.

Lu Zhanyuan was very arrogant and domineering in the sect by relying on the fact that there was Shi Feiyu backing him.

Luo Yunqing could not bear the sight of it and made a move to teach him a lesson a few times.

It was also precisely because of this that Shi Feiyu was very displeased with him.

Hitting his disciple, that was slapping his face!

Speaking of which, Shi Feiyu this lineage really descended from the same lineage!

From Shi Feiyu to Lu Zhanyuan, then to Lu Zhuo, they were all of the same virtue.

Overbearing!

Rude and unreasonable!

It was just that in the past, Luo Yunqing was wary of Shi Feiyu’s strength and could not go too overboard.

However, Luo Yunqing did not expect that Ye Yuan was even more impressive than him.

He actually killed Lu Zhanyuan just like that!

This kind of temperament that had no scruples and did not fear power, suited his tastes a lot.

It was just that on that side, Shi Feiyu having his face slapped repeatedly, he was long already beside himself with rage.

His disciple was killed. Now, he even said well killed!

Did he really take him, this elder, to be trifled with?

“Good, good, good! This old man wants to see how the young are to be feared!” Shi Feiyu said three ‘good’s in a row. His rage currently could be seen.

The moment the imposing aura of a Jade Sovereign Heaven released, the terrifying pressure instantly enveloped Luo Yunqing.

Middle Jade Sovereign Heaven!

Luo Yunqing’s countenance did not change, the sword intent on his body surging to the sky.

Although he was a minor realm lower than Shi Feiyu, Luo Yunqing’s fighting intent tore through the firmament!

Two great Jade Sovereign Heaven experts confronted each other, everyone’s faces changed one after another.

Five Great Heavenly Regions, those able to reach Jade Sovereign Heaven were feudal kings of a region!

Regardless of being in which sect, their statuses were extremely high.

This level of powerhouse would not take action easily.

But, once they made a move, it would be earth-shattering!

Without waiting for anyone to instruct, everyone retreated far away one after another, fearful of being involved.

Swoosh!

Luo Yunqing’s figure suddenly disappeared. He was actually the first to make a move!

Rumble?…

The two exchanged blows, instantly fighting until sand and rocks flew everywhere, the earth quaking and mountains swaying.

On Tianhui Peak, there was a stretch of wasteland.

It was just that although Luo Yunqing was a minor realm lower than Shi Feiyu, he did not fall into a disadvantageous position in the slightest!

Protector Mo stared dumbfoundedly with his mouth agape and said in shock, “Senior Apprentice Brother Luo’s sword intent billows to the sky. The moment he entered Jade Sovereign, he’s fighting with Elder Shi until they are evenly matched in strength! He is already someone of a completely different world from us!”

While Han Qianyun’s gaze flickered, clearly feeling awful.

When someone around them suddenly leaped over the dragon gate, becoming someone who stood above the masses.

Only they themselves knew the grief.

The two people were in the midst of fierce fighting when suddenly, a ray of sword light flew over from beyond the horizon.

Boom!

A loud bang came over, directly sending the two people flying.

Following that, a sagely-looking middle-aged man came over from the sky.

Seeing this person, everyone’s faces suddenly changed, directly bowing down.

Even someone as proud as Luo Yunqing also bowed in salute.

“Paying respects to Sect Master!”

Ye Yuan was extremely surprised. He did not expect that it actually alarmed the sect master!

At this time, his handsome face was like carved jade, his expression restrained. One look and it was clear that he was an extremely strong person.

The middle-aged man said in a solemn voice,?“Humph!?Two great Jade Sovereign Heavens actually came to blows in front of their own mountain pass gates, where’s the sense of propriety? Do you guys still have me, this sect master, in your eyes?”

Clearly, he was rather upset about his own people’s internal strife.

Shi Feiyu acted like the villain who sued the victim first before he got prosecuted, hurriedly saying, “Sect Master, please investigate! Luo Yunqing this punk fetched a scoundrel from god knows where, he killed this old man’s beloved disciple before even entering the sect! This guy actually still said that it was well killed! This old man was indignant; that’s why I fought with him!”

Suppressing the two mighty experts, the sect master was not as angry as before anymore.

He gave Luo Yunqing a glance, a hint of approval showing in his gaze as he said, “Not bad, Yunqing!”

Luo Yunqing said, “Thank you, Sect Master, for your praise!”

The sect master said coolly, “Since you’ve already entered Jade Sovereign, you’re the heavenly sect’s elder! I’ll hold a conferment ceremony for you another day! It’s just that, shouldn’t there be an explanation for today’s matter?”

Luo Yunqing said coolly, “Lu Zhanyuan sought death, there’s no need to explain anything! Moreover, in Yunqing’s view, if Lu Zhanyuan dying can soothe Ye Yuan’s heart, it’s worth it!”

“You! Luo Yunqing!” By the side, Shi Feiyu was about to explode from anger. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This was saying that his disciple died in vain just like that?

His face was slapped in vain just like that?

Moreover, it was even slapped by a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Where would he, this Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, put his face?

When the others heard this, they were dumbstruck with amazement too.

They all knew Ye Yuan’s aptitude although the combat strength that Ye Yuan exhibited was surprising.

His talent was placed there, there was limited room for improvement.

But Luo Yunqing said that as long as it soothed Ye Yuan’s heart, one Lu Zhanyuan dying did not matter at all!

The meaning of the words was saying that, if he died, he died in vain!

“Sect Master, you listen! What does he mean by that?! Zhanyuan is of the pre-natal grade five Sun Physique. He has extremely high hopes of stepping into Jade Sovereign Heaven in the future! His death is actually just for the sake of currying favor with a lower-inferior aptitude trash?” Shi Feiyu berated sharply.

Sect Master also frowned slightly and looked at Ye Yuan and said, “Lower-inferior aptitude?”

Shi Feiyu gave a wink, Han Qianyu got the meaning and hurriedly said, “Reporting to Sect Master, Ye Yuan already passed through the array formation just now and doesn’t have any Dao physique. His aptitude is lower-inferior, and his affinity is only four!”

Sect Master’s brows knitted together.

Right now, he somewhat felt that Luo Yunqing vented his pent-up feelings on some pretext.

“Yunqing, this matter isn’t a trivial matter. It concerns the feelings of the sect’s people! If you’re unable to give an explanation, this sect master will definitely punish you severely!” Sect Master’s tone also became serious.

The moment Shi Feiyu heard, he was ecstatic in his heart.

These two fellows were so arrogant, see how you guys could still be arrogant!

Luo Yunqing was indifferent and said coolly, “So what if pre-natal grade five Sun Physique? I, Luo Yunqing, am merely a grade three Dao physique, didn’t I also step into Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum now? On the contrary, the sect recruited quite a number of grade five Dao physique disciples, but how many can step into Jade Sovereign Heaven? Therefore, aptitude doesn’t mean everything!”

Shi Feiyu sneered and said, “You’re twisting logic to win the argument!”

Luo Yunqing completely ignored him and said coolly, “When I was in True Yang Heavenly Domain, I heard by chance that the little country of Eastward had an ascender who actually refined a heavenly pill with one point affinity. So I went to inquire about it. Later, I laid low in Eastward for ten years, observing Ye Yuan, and saw his growth and rise with my own eyes, cultivating grade one heavenly pills to the extreme! Such a genius has much more potential than that Lu Zhanyuan!”

“Hang on, you’re saying that the reason you gave the green-wing token to him is that he knows how to refine pills?” Shi Feiyu suddenly said.

Luo Yunqing said coolly, “Exactly!”

“Hahaha?…” Shi Feiyu laughed loudly and said: “It’s really making people die of laughter! A guy whose affinity is only four points cultivated grade one heavenly pills to the extreme! This extreme is also too worthless, right?”

“Hang on!” Sect Master suddenly spoke up, “Just now, you said that he only has one point affinity?”

What kind of character was Sect Master?

The crucial information in these two people’s words was captured by him very quickly!

Luo Yunqing smiled lightly and said, “That’s right! When Ye Yuan just ascended, he only had one point affinity! But he has four points now! Sect Master, the significance of this doesn’t need me to say anymore, right?”
