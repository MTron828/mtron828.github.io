Chapter 2271: Keeping Watch!

The eight idols seemed to be spiritually linked.

They were clearly all dead objects, but they gave people a feeling of being almost lifelike.

The moment their gazes looked over, it was like the world looked over. Ning Tianping’s mind shook heavily and he spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood with a cough.

But right at this time, a gentle aura hit from behind, enveloping him inside. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ning Tianping looked at Ye Yuan in surprise and discovered that Ye Yuan was cool as a cucumber. It was as if nothing had happened.

“You just need to comprehend it. You don’t need to care about other things. No matter how strong they are, they can’t hurt you either,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ning Tianping nodded slightly, relaxed his mind, and started comprehending the Dao.

But the Dao was not so easy to comprehend.

Ning Tianping’s strength had long already surpassed all others among peers.

But he did not tread out his own path.

Only those who attained Dao could reach the apex.

But wanting to take this step was arduously difficult.

Ning Tianping’s talent was decent, but he was only born in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

If it was the normal trajectory, he would at most merely be Celestial Deity Realm.

Now, breaking through to become an Empyrean, rather than say that it was because of Mo Lifei’s devoted teaching, might as well say that it was because of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills.

It was Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills that cleansed his marrows, causing him to continuously surpass his limits.

But to tread out one’s own path was not that easy.

The Dao could be understood, but it could not be expressed with words.

Even if Ye Yuan comprehended his own Dao, he was unable to tell the people around him and let them gain enlightenment on Dao too.

But these eight idols possessed the same aura as the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. It was just that they were also not as unfathomable as the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

To Ning Tianping, this was the best place to gain enlightenment on Dao.

Of course, based on his own strength, it was totally impossible to gain enlightenment on Dao.

This was the Dao that the divine race’s eight great progenitors tailor-made for the divine race. The bodies of humans were unable to withstand it at all.

But Ye Yuan could borrow the power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and help Ning Tianping neutralize a portion of the power, letting him gain enlightenment on Dao in a peaceful environment.

“The Dao lies in the heart. Follow your own heart. The setbacks that you’ve encountered in your life are too few, experiencing life and death this time is precisely the time for great enlightenment. Open up your heart and accept your inner-self, and find the Great Dao that belongs to you!” Ye Yuan’s words reverberated in Ning Tianping’s ears.

Ning Tianping’s entire body trembled, his eyes gradually becoming brilliant.

Gradually, his entire mind and body relaxed, quietly accepting the baptism of Dao.

Originally, this was the most dangerous step.

How great was the power of Dao? How could it be what ordinary people could endure?

Once the Dao heart collapsed, all the cultivation would be forfeited entirely.

But Ye Yuan helped him to withstand the vast majority of the impact force. He could comprehend his own Dao very comfortably.

By the side, Ru Feng’s heart shook wildly!

“This boy actually doesn’t fear the divine race imprint amidst the Great Dao! He ... How did he do it?”

“Also, his Dao has already gone so far? I’m afraid that even ordinary Heavenly Emperors haven’t gone as far as him!”

“Freak, truly a freak! How could such a freak appear in the human race?”

A hint of killing intent flashed across in Ru Feng’s eyes. At this very moment, he had an impulse to finish Ye Yuan off.

The threat that Ye Yuan brought to him was too strong.

Someone like Ye Yuan being born in the opponent’s camp truly made people feel too dangerous.

But thinking about it, he still suppressed the killing intent in his heart.

He could kill Ye Yuan. But in return, it would cause tens of millions of Hidden Lineage clan members to be buried in death.

This transaction was too not worthwhile.

The divine race was about to come into being. The era of great struggle was about to arrive. These were all the divine race’s backbone combat power!

At this time, Ning Tianping walked in front of the first idol and sat down cross-legged.

Ye Yuan smiled knowingly and secretly nodded.

Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise!

The events this time helped Ning Tianping achieve his aim instead, making him have a great awakening.

Mo Lifei’s death let Ning Tianping suffer an unprecedented blow but also helped him.

Ning Tianping already entered the state and could take the first step of Dao enlightenment very soon!

All things were difficult before they were easy!

The comprehension of Dao, the first step of entering Dao was the most difficult.

Many people were unable to take this step in their entire lives.

“Mo Lifei, you can rest in peace!” Ye Yuan said in his heart.

Only between life and death could one have a great awakening.

However, what Ye Yuan did not know was that for Ning Tianping to be able to take this step, it was not merely because of the life and death trial this time, it was more due to his teaching by example.

For so many years, he followed by Ye Yuan’s side and witnessed Ye Yuan’s miraculous rise from the perspective of a bystander.

Everyone knew that Ye Yuan was the Southern Border’s number one alchemy master, the Priest Temple’s Second Sage. But no one knew how much he paid for this.

The difficulties that Ye Yuan experienced were unimaginable for ordinary people.

But Ye Yuan would never fear and would never shrink back.

How firm his Dao heart was, Ning Tianping was someone who personally experienced it.

Even though Mo Lifei was his master, the one with the greatest influence on Ning Tianping was Ye Yuan.

Ning Tianping viewed Ye Yuan as his most sought-after goal in his life, and he was unknowingly imitating Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s words and actions were all constantly affecting him too.

Otherwise, with Ning Tianping’s temperament, there would be no way of recovering from the blow of Mo Lifei’s death so quickly.

In fact, he would be devastated.

Actually, after all these years, Ning Tianping’s heart had already unknowingly become very strong.

Had to admit, Ye Yuan had this kind of magical power.

The people around him would always be infected by him.

Time passed day by day. Ning Tianping’s eyes became brighter and brighter.

While the Ye Yuan by the side was constantly withdrawing his aura, letting more Great Dao aura land on Ning Tianping’s body.

The aura on Ning Tianping’s body became stronger and stronger, the Great Dao power that he could withstand also grew more and more.

However, Ye Yuan did not go and gain enlightenment on Dao.

This was not his Dao!

These idols were just Daos that eight progenitors carved.

If it was the real incarnation of Heavenly Dao, he could comprehend it a bit.

Ye Yuan felt that that was the true path!

As for these idols, he held them in contempt.

Three years later, he suddenly stood up and made some very strange postures.

These postures were precisely the postures of these god statues.

It was very hard for Ning Tianping to learn. In the beginning, he was unable to perform it at all. In fact, he would vomit blood the moment he performed it.

But he was not discouraged, attempting it over and over again.

After ten years, he could finally perform the first posture.

Another five years passed, he performed the second posture.

30 years later, he finally performed all eight poses!

While Ye Yuan guarded beside Ning Tianping for 33 years!

Suddenly, the entire sacred ground’s aura became different.

A terrifying power of law suddenly descended!

Sea of Law!

Ye Yuan’s eyes suddenly lit up, revealing a hint of surprise.

Ning Tianping’s improvement far exceeded his expectations!

He truly had a great awakening, gaining enlightenment on his own Dao!

Sea of Law descending! It caused a great sensation in the entire sacred ground.

Those people gaining enlightenment on Dao were all startled by this scene and gave up on comprehending. Each and every one looked toward Ning Tianping in shock.
