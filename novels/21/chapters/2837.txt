Chapter 2843 Help Him Brag!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Junior Apprentice Brother’s Alchemy Dao realm is likely quite a bit stronger than me! No wonder Master repeatedly exhorted me to definitely take good care of Junior Apprentice Brother! He’s just a grade five

heavenly alchemist. When he reaches my realm, he might even have a chance to compete with Hegemon Pinespring back then!”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s acupuncture technique, titanic waves set off in Hua Zong’s heart.

It was just that he did not know that in Ancestor Cloudmount’s heart, the current Ye Yuan already surpassed Zhou Pinespring back then!

With regards to his master’s orders, Hua Zong was very perplexed in his heart.

That tone was actually like … somewhat ingratiating himself with Junior Apprentice Brother!

Previously, he had some indignation and disdain in his heart.

But now, it completely dissipated!

The two people were both exceedingly formidable people. When they took action, it was naturally extraordinary.

However, the numbers were too many. The two of them also used a full day before completely healing those severely wounded people.

Meanwhile, Wu Jiang and the rest knelt there just like that, being at a loss on what to do.

After treating the last person, Ye Yuan got up and said loudly, “Everyone, the Extreme Medicine Sect won’t stand by and watch people die! You all came over from the southern front too. You know how fierce the war is

over there. There are too many wounded being sent back, resulting in the present situation. However, everyone rest assured. You all wait here first. This Ye will arrange for manpower to come over and carry out

treatment on everyone according to your injuries. Everyone, please observe order. That way, more people can receive medical treatment.”

“Okay! Many thanks for your help, Master Ye!”

“Master Ye, rest assured. We just came to seek medical treatment. We won’t make trouble!”

“We trust the Extreme Medicine Sect’s credibility. We’ll wait right here!”

When he was done speaking, those wounded people immediately made their attitudes known.

These people were all moved by Ye Yuan.

Originally, with Ye Yuan’s identity, he did not need to care about them at all.

But Ye Yuan did not shirk from hardship and treated hundreds of people.

These people naturally trusted what he said.

However, Hua Zong, who was by the side, frowned slightly. However, he covered it up very quickly.

Some things were not appropriate to say in front of so many people.

Ye Yuan had not entered the sect yet. He probably did not know how complicated things were inside this kind of Hegemon level sect!

Finished saying, Ye Yuan came before the kneeling Wu Jiang.

Wu Jiang’s expression was extremely ugly, but he could only call out, “D-Disciple pays respect to Martial Uncle!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I wonder if I’m qualified to teach you a lesson now?”

Although Wu Jiang was unhappy in his heart, he still nodded and said, “Martial Uncle is naturally qualified to teach this disciple a lesson!”

His strength was not strong in the sect, and his status was not high. Otherwise, he also would not have been sent to guard the mountain pass gates.

Therefore, he could not afford to provoke someone with Ye Yuan’s identity.

“Good that I’m qualified! You listen up! The Heaven One Continent is presently united against outsiders, making no distinctions between each other! These people, they are all our comrades in arms! As the number one

major sect in the world, our Extreme Medicine Sect should naturally also shoulder the responsibility of being the number one great sect! The Extreme Medicine Sect’s prestige, that’s all forged bit by bit, by Hegemon

ancestors and Emperor Realm powerhouses! You guys are just sitting idly and reaping the fruits of others’ labor!”

“You, these people are staying in the rear, you don’t know the cruelty of the front lines at all! If you all have also experienced the death of your loved ones and witnessed the power of the blood race, you guys wouldn’t

be so cold anymore! Today, in front of all the Extreme Medicine Sect disciples present, I’ll report this to the Extreme Light Pavilion and let you all go to the Absolute Heaven Barrier to experience what’s called cruelty

and what’s called comrade-in-arms!”

Hua Zong, who was by the side, was dumbfounded with shock from listening.

Was this junior apprentice brother too naive or too arrogant?

A few hundred Saint Sovereign Heavens present, more than ten True Sovereign Heavens, you said dispatch and they would be dispatched?

na massive sect, the relationships were complicated and confusing!

Saint Sovereign Heaven was still alright, but behind True Sovereign Heavens, there were more or less the shadows of Emperor Realm powerhouses.

ff he touched one or two people, with Zuo Chen’s face, there was naturally no one who dared to talk behind his back.

But, touching several hundred people at once, even Zuo Chen could not suppress it too!

eporting to Extreme Light Pavilion … you really dared to say something like that!

Did you really think that this Extreme Medicine Sect was run by your family?

Hua Zong felt a headache coming. This junior apprentice brother had not even entered the sect and already caused considerable trouble.

Of course, he did not feel that Ye Yuan had the ability to do this.

But the tall talk was already released. At that time, if it could not be completed, then where would Master Zuo Chen’s face go?

However, these words received the unanimous cheering of those seeking medical treatment when it was uttered.

“Master Ye is mighty!”

“Well done, Master Ye!”

The faces of Qian Nan and the rest punctured these people’s hearts deeply.

Therefore, when Ye Yuan said it, they naturally clapped their hands in joy.

Wu Jiang and the rest had respectful faces, but they were sneering endlessly in their hearts.

No idea where this country bumpkin came from either. Did he really think that he could do whatever he wanted in the Extreme Medicine Sect after acknowledging Emperor Zuo Chen as his master?

There were no less than 100 thousand Extreme Medicine Sect disciples.

So many disciples, the factions in it went without saying.

The larger the sect, the more complicated and confusing the relationships.

ff you were Emperor Realm, there might really be some deterrent force when you said this.

But you were just merely a puny little grade five heavenly alchemist; that was all! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

o matter how high your talent was, could it still affect the decision of the upper echelons?

eckless and blind!

Young people indeed hungered for fame and reputation and liked posturing!

it was just that, have you considered your master’s feelings when you postured like this?

Wu Jiang knelt, the corners of his mouth sneering as he said, “I leave it up to Martial Uncle to deal with!”

Hua Zong frowned slightly and said with a wave of his hand, “All of you withdraw. Switch to another batch of people to come and maintain order!”

Wu Jiang kowtowed to Hua Zong and brought people and withdrew.

Along the way, Wu Jiang had a disdainful look as he said, “Huhu, really a very stupid and naive boy! Does he think that by acknowledging Grandmaster Zuo Chen as his master, he transformed from a swallow into a

phoenix? Doesn’t he know that in the Emperor Sakra Heaven, there’s still Emperor Sakra Heaven and also Hegemon Realm?”

Qian Nan also smiled coldly and said, “This boast was over the top. We got to help him brag about it after going back! Otherwise, it can’t show the prowess of this grandmaster!”

The moment Wu Jiang heard, a hint of a smile could not help surfacing on his face.

Yeah, this boy embarrassed him so hard today. If he did not repay it, it would really let him down too much!

Although on the surface he could not afford to provoke Ye Yuan, he could still play some cheap tricks in the dark.

Such as letting everyone know about the brag that Ye Yuan made!

At that time, see how this guy cleans up the mess!

Furthermore, after Zuo Chen knew about this, he would definitely view Ye Yuan ‘in a different light.’

As for Zuo Chen’s face, sorry about it, that wasn’t our business anymore.

He, Wu Jiang, had no relations with Zuo Chen whatsoever!

After Wu Jiang and the others left, Hua Zong also led Ye Yuan away from the mountain pass gates.

He noticed that although there was already no one maintaining order, these ten thousand people were still orderly.

Furthermore, there were still many wounded people rushing over from all directions.

Among them, some powerhouses even took the initiative to appear and help maintain order, classifying these wounded into categories.

Seeing this scene, Hua Zong also sighed emotionally.

He knew that Ye Yuan’s way of doing things was correct, but for some things, his strength fell short of his wishes too!.
