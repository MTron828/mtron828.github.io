Chapter 2936: Nothing More Than This!

“This Ye Yuan is also too lacking in judgment!”

“Barely managed to awaken a soul physique, even if it’s a trash soul physique, it’s better than nothing too!”

“This guy actually went to provoke an Emperor Realm powerhouse. Furthermore, it’s even a super genius among Emperor Realm powerhouses. Isn’t this digging his own grave?”

… …

When everyone saw that Ye Yuan was so stubborn, they shook their heads endlessly.

They could not stand Feng Rui’s haughtiness too.

But, so what if they could not bear the sight of it?

Feng Rui and Qin Shitian were on completely different levels!

Feng Rui was a true heaven’s chosen!

Although it sounded unpleasant, what he said was right. This group of people was all bumpkins.

How can Feng Rui, this middle-grade heaven rank soul physique, plus Emperor Realm strength, be what you, a measly little True Sovereign Heaven, can provoke?

“Master, since this ant-like thing is provoking me, there shouldn’t be any problem with me beating him to death, right?” Feng Rui cupped his fists and said.

Cloudneon still had the appearance of an ancient well without any ripples and said coolly, “No problem.”

Her words carried overweening arrogance and disdain.

In her eyes, Ye Yuan was merely an unimportant ant. That was all.

Trampling him to death was quite acceptable.

With regards to this kind of despise, Ye Yuan had experienced god knows how many.

He was naturally furious in his heart, but he would not show it on his face either. That would show a flaw.

The only way to shut these people up was to be stronger than them!

Feng Rui grinned, looking like he was itching for a fight as he floated down.

“Outside world’s genius, you might not know the gap between the outside world and the Imperishable Soul Domain. Today, this young hegemon will let you understand that you’re merely mundane! Whatever rubbish pride of a genius, you aren’t worthy of possessing such a thing!” Feng Rui had a deprecating look as he said.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “I’m very adept in making idiots like you shut up! Stop talking rubbish and bring it on.”

Feng Rui’s pupils constricted, a divine soul attack already arriving.

Ye Yuan could kill a ten wroughts with one glance. He could naturally kill Ye Yuan with one look too.

He wanted to let these ants understand that the outside world’s so-called geniuses were nothing at all!

Let them be filled with even more awe toward the Imperishable Soul Domain!

Bang!

Ye Yuan gave a muffled groan. His entire person seemed to have suffered a heavy blow, falling several steps back in a row.

Following that, his soul body also became much dimmer.

Clearly, the power of this blow was tremendously strong!

When everyone saw this scene, their expressions changed one after another.

“So strong! He just casually dealt an attack and it injured Ye Yuan already!”

“Previously, Qin Shitian even unleashed his sub-origin soul martial and failed to harm Ye Yuan too!”

“Are the Imperishable Soul Domain’s geniuses all so strong?”

… …

Facing the bumpkins with shocked faces, Feng Rui was very pleased with himself.

It was just that a hint of surprise actually flashed across Cloudneon’s ten-thousand-year-ice-like face.

Actually, Feng Rui was also shocked in his heart.

Divine soul attacks and divine soul attacks were different!

What the Imperishable Soul Domain’s geniuses cultivated were all extremely strong soul path martial arts. The power of their divine soul attacks could not be mentioned in the same breadth as the outside world at all.

Furthermore, he was an Emperor Realm powerhouse. How terrifying was the power of his one blow?

But Ye Yuan actually just moved back several steps?

Feng Rui was very dissatisfied with this result.

In his view, this strike could have taken Ye Yuan’s life!

Ye Yuan’s soul physique was at most just upper-grade yellow rank. “Search our n?wno?el.?rg”Plus, his cultivation realm was inferior to him too. Wouldn’t killing him be as easy as flipping over his hand?”

But Ye Yuan’s toughness had clearly exceeded his expectations.

“Can’t even block an ordinary divine soul attack, just the likes of you dare to profess to be of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique too? You probably don’t know how terrifying the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique is, right?” Feng Rui said with a ridiculing look.

Losing in reality but not losing in disposition; Feng Rui naturally would not admit that Ye Yuan was very strong.

As long as he annihilated him with the next strike, these ‘bumpkins’ would naturally continue to be shocked!

Ye Yuan gave Feng Rui a glance and said coolly, “Young Hegemon Feng, an exalted Emperor Realm powerhouse who also cultivated the Imperishable Soul Domain’s supreme martial arts, your divine soul attack only has this bit of power? Imperishable Soul Domain’s genius disappoints me greatly!”

Ye Yuan cultivated the Divine Emergence and naturally knew how powerful the soul race’s mystic arts were.

Although Feng Rui’s divine soul attack was inferior to the moves in Divine Emergence, it was also extremely powerful.

At least, compared to Qin Shitian that sort of rookie, it was no idea how many times stronger!

How could an attack that could injure his soul body be of an ordinary sort?

Feng Rui’s pupils constricted, feeling like the cloth that was covering up his embarrassment was pulled off.

Immediately, he turned angry from embarrassment.

“Heh,?razor-tongued fellow, this young hegemon wants to see how long you can be stubborn until!”

Feng Rui gave a cold laugh, Emperor Realm soul force erupting.

The moment he erupted, Feng Rui’s strength was completely manifested.

This condensed to the extreme soul force made a powerhouse like Great Emperor Eastsun perspire from embarrassment too.

Only to see Feng Rui grip his hand, a punch flying out. The soul force came head-on like the boundless sea.

Even the people outside of the field could feel the force of this punch.

Forget about True Sovereign Heaven; even if an Emperor Realm powerhouse was here, it would be the outcome of the soul disintegrating too!

“Origin Dipper Force!”

Feng Rui threw a punch out. Everyone broke into cold sweat for Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan bent the bow and notched the arrow neither too fast nor too slow.

“Arrow of God Extermination!”

Cloudneon’s gaze turned intent, her eyes showing even greater surprise.

With her eyesight, she could naturally tell the extraordinary aspects of this move.

It was just that, how could an outside world’s ant know such a profound soul path mystic art?

Presently, Ye Yuan awakened the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, the power of this Arrow of God Extermination was dozens of times stronger than before!

When this arrow was unleashed, in terms of power, it was not the slightest bit below Emperor Realm powerhouses.

Boom!

Two formidable soul forces collided together in the air.

The undulation caused was not the slightest bit weaker than the undulation caused by divine essence!

The expressions of the powerhouses present changed one after another, incredibly shocked.

These two people were both too strong!

One had to know that the showdown of soul force was often silent. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Even if it caused some fluctuations, that was far from the fluctuations caused by divine essence.

But these two people’s fight already spurred heaven and earth spiritual energy to wreak havoc. The combat power already did not lose to the human race in the least bit.

However, Ye Yuan gave another muffled groan under this blow and flew out backward.

This time, his soul body became even dimmer. Clearly, he had suffered even greater injuries.

However, Feng Rui’s face did not show any joy. He became somewhat angry from embarrassment.

He had not even forced Ye Yuan’s soul physique form out up till now!

This was a huge loss in face!

Sure enough, Ye Yuan stabilized his figure, looking at Feng Rui as he said with a sneer, “The strength of Imperishable Soul Domain’s genius is nothing more than this! You can’t even force my soul physique form out, and yet, you have the cheek to swagger and bluster in front of everyone too?”

Nirvana Soul Hall’s powerhouses felt very pleased currently!

They were pissed off with Feng Rui’s face too but did not dare to speak up despite feeling angry.

But Ye Yuan used his strength and slapped his face ruthlessly.

Even if he suffered a loss for both exchanges, he was just True Sovereign Heaven after all!

An Imperishable Soul Domain’s genius, whose cultivation realm was higher than Ye Yuan, actually could not even force Ye Yuan’s soul physique form out. How disgraceful!

Feng Rui’s face was grim, and he said with a cold snort, “Brat, you forced my hand!”
