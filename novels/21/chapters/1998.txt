Chapter 2002: Stirring up Big Trouble

Lu Ziyi’s face was full of disdain.

The power of this sword move looked to be just that tiny bit stronger than before.

This was Ye Yuan’s ace in the hole?

All talk no action; it seemed like this kid only had just this bit of strength.

In a blink of an eye, Sword Hollow Etch collided together with the Five Elements Sword Art.

Bang!

The houses around instantly turned to dust, as if they had never existed before.

Lu Ziyi’s expression instantly turned from disdain to stupefaction.

A force that toppled mountains and overturned the seas came over from the sword light.

Lu Ziyi’s complexion turned white as a sheet, frenziedly urging her divine essence and mobilizing heaven and earth spiritual energy. The five elements continuously regenerated in endless succession, attempting to stop this terrifying force.

It was just that everything was futile.

Lu Ziyi felt that Ye Yuan’s power was like a tsunami, the sky rending asunder and the earth splitting open, without ceasing.

No matter how she utilized the five elements law, she was unable to withstand it too.

“Puhwark!”

Lu Ziyi spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, directly being struck flying out by this sword move, falling heavily to the ground.

The current Lu Ziyi had her clothes all disheveled, hair hanging down loosely. How was there still that demeanor of a fairy maiden?

She was still struggling to get up, but a sword already reached her throat.

Ye Yuan’s sword move was too strong. Her internal organs already suffered extremely severe injuries.

“This is your reliance, your pride? Merely thus. Right now, you’re even inferior to the lowly commoners you spoke of. So what qualifications do you have to look down on them?”

Ye Yuan looked at Lu Ziyi, his words full of mockery.

Just earlier, Lu Ziyi was still a fairy maiden high up in the clouds, using a proud gaze to look at the world indifferently.

But now, Ye Yuan was looking down on her.

All of her pride was crushed by Ye Yuan at this moment until it was shredded to pieces.

“What bullshit genius, nothing at all compared to Lord Ye Yuan!”

“Really too strong! Lord Ye Yuan is really too strong! A genius who comprehended the five elements law is actually not even his match.”

“Hahaha, really refreshing! Doesn’t she look down on us, these lowly commoners? What about herself now?”

...

The martial artists in the city all started cheering frenziedly.

No one could have thought that Ye Yuan still had a perfect victory facing a powerful existence with five laws, particularly the five elements.

One had to know, Lu Ziyi was two minor realms higher than Ye Yuan!

True God Realm, two minor realms meant a disparity of several thousand years or even several tens of thousands of years.

Of course, this was just to geniuses.

To those ordinary martial artists, a minor realm might be several hundreds of thousands of years!

Lu Ziyi’s expression was also extremely ugly. She never would have thought that she would actually lose to a Third Firmament True God, this bumpkin-like existence in her eyes.

This kind of blow virtually shattered all of her confidence.

At this time, a black-clothed armored soldier hurriedly spoke up, “Brat, there’s Empyrean Lu Yan behind Miss Ziyi. If you dare to touch her, the entire city has to be buried in death with her!”

Hearing that, everyone shuddered with fear.

An Empyrean powerhouse, this was something that they had never thought about, and also an existence far beyond their reach!

Once an Empyrean was enraged, corpses would span ten thousand miles!

If they provoked an Empyrean powerhouse, how could a mere Heavenly Eagle Imperial City bear his wrath?

Lu Ziyi looked at Ye Yuan and said coldly, “My father is the Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s city lord, Lu Yan. Even if you won against me, so what?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “The person that I, Ye Yuan, want to kill, even if the Jade Emperor comes, he can’t stop it too! So what ... if Empyrean?”

But Lu Ziyi was indifferent, she felt that Ye Yuan was indulging in contention of mouth and tongue.

Empyrean powerhouse, that was a godlike existence, who would dare defy?

She looked at Ye Yuan and said calmly, “Ye Yuan, you’re a talent! I admit that I’m inferior to you! But, if you dare to touch a hair of mine, you’ll die without a burial ground! These lowly commoners will likewise be buried in death with you!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, his face was full of sneers.

This woman was also too conceited.

At this point, she still thought that he was pretending to be profound?

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was amused.

“Huhu,

at this point, do you still feel that you’re lofty and above the masses?” Ye Yuan said with a cold laugh.

Lu Ziyi gave Ye Yuan a glance and said calmly, “Stop being pretentious here! Could it be that you really dare to kill me? My father is an Empyrean powerhouse. That isn’t an existence you can afford to provoke. Being able to defeat me shows that you’re indeed very strong and have no relations whatsoever with these powerless lowly plebeians. All in all, you don’t dare to kill me, and even have to send me back properly.”

When Ye Yuan heard, he laughed in spite of himself.

This woman was really hopeless.

He looked at Lu Ziyi and said with a cold smile, “Originally, I’m not a bloodthirsty person. But you never should have killed Jiang Ming. Maybe in your eyes, he’s just an insignificant small character. But in my eyes, he’s a young man who had affection and loyalty. If you don’t die today, heaven will not tolerate it!”

Done talking, the tip of Ye Yuan’s sword moved, stabbing right through Lu Ziyi’s heart.

Until death, Lu Ziyi had a look of disbelief.

Was this guy ... mad?

He ... He actually really dared to kill her!

However, Lu Ziyi’s pupils gradually dilated, the look in her eyes gradually started turning lax.

A proud heaven’s chosen of her generation fell here!

Everyone looked at this scene in incredible shock, disbelief on their faces.

When that black-clothed armored soldier uttered the awe-inspiring name of the Empyrean, everyone was taken back.

It was just that none of them thought that Ye Yuan actually really dared to kill people.

And the reason was just a lowly commoner that they spoke of.

“You ... You actually really kill Young Lady, are you crazy?” That True God Realm black-clothed armored soldier had a look of disbelief all over his face.

Could it be that this guy did not fear an Empyrean powerhouse?

He actually killed an Empyrean’s daughter!

Ye Yuan looked at that black-clothed armored soldier and said coldly, “This Ye has a clear conscience when doing things! If I let her go, how will I give an account to the deceased Jiang Ming? Considering everything and everyone beneath their notice, then they have to bear the consequences of looking down on everyone and everything! Also, you all, none of you can think about leaving.”

That black-clothed armored soldier’s face changed, feeling like he ran into a lunatic.

Why was this guy so unreasonable?

Completely could not talk sense!

The more you spoke, the more he fought with you!

...

When Ye Yuan saw Zuo Shujie and the rest, the rage in his heart grew even more.

Zuo Shujie few people already lost most of their life, only leaving behind one last breath.

If not for that Lu Ziyi wanted to bring them back to Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital, they would likely have already perished and their Dao dissipating at this time.

Of course, this was nothing to Ye Yuan, As long as there was a breath there, Ye Yuan could save them. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, when they knew that the Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s powerhouses were completely annihilated, their faces were still incomparably shocked.

This time, a big hole was poked in the basket!

Such exceptionally talented figures were bound to be Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s important figures, so how could they drop the matter?

When Bai Tong saw Ye Yuan, he smiled and said, “You indeed didn’t let me down.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’ve made you suffered.”
