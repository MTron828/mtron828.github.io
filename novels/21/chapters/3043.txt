Chapter 3042: The Blind Ones Are You All!

“Goodness me! Two great beauties inviting, it really puts this Yang in a dilemma!” Yang Qing said with a smug look.

Yu Ran directly cuddled against his body and said with a smile, “What dilemma is there? It’s merely one sect behind this woman. But, behind Yu Ran, it’s the power of a race! One will also know who to choose without needing to think, right?”

Wang Ningyan said coldly, “Shameless!”

Yu Ran smiled and said, “Younger Sister Ningyan, you want to rope Big Brother Yang Qing in, and you still want to put on airs? What kind of heaven’s chosen is Big Brother Yang Qing? Could it be that he can’t match up to you?”

Wang Ningyan’s brows furrowed slightly, but she felt that Yu Ran’s words made sense.

Across the heavens and myriad worlds, it could be said that there was no man that could enter her eyes!

Even Kong Tan was not enough to make her view him in a different light too.

But Yang Qing was an exception!

After experiencing the Thousand Souls Hall, they were all too clear how strong those thousand people were!

Especially the top 100, they were really strong to the extreme.

To be able to clear the Thousand Souls Hall stage, these geniuses all knew what that meant.

Yang Qing’s potential was immeasurable!

Otherwise, why would someone as cold and proud as Wang Ningyan welcome warmly with a smiling face?

However, compared to Yu Ran, Wang Ningyan had indeed fallen to a disadvantage again.

If one were to consider who in this world could match up to her, Wang Ningyan, it was only Yang Qing!

Seeing how Yang Qing looked, Kong Tan was even more certain that he and Feng Qingxuan were just ordinary friends.

“Hur hur,?your man seems to have already forgotten your existence! Feng Qingxuan, you have peerless looks too. Why are you so shameless? Randomly grabbing a guy and saying that he’s your man?” Kong Tan snickered.

Feng Qingxuan looked at him and said with a cold smile, “Who told you that my man is Yang Qing?”

Kong Tan could not help laughing and said, “Isn’t that what you said?”

Feng Qingxuan’s figure moved, arriving next to Ye Yuan. Grabbing Ye Yuan’s arm, she said, “Look closely, this is my man!”

Ye Yuan was stupefied.

When did I … freaking become your man?

Feng Qingxuan’s action made everyone’s jaws hit the ground in shock.

“This … is Fairy Feng abandoning herself to despair?”

“Who is this kid? He didn’t even get on the All-Heavens List and Thousand Souls List, right? Fairy Feng is actually throwing herself at him?”

“Fairy Feng must be blind! Yang Qing is a peerless heaven’s chosen. She didn’t take a fancy on him and actually took a fancy on an unknown trash?”

… …

Compared to the current Yang Qing, Ye Yuan was indeed trash.

Yang Qing was too dazzling!

In the 33 Heavens, the heavens’ chosen were plentiful like oxen fur.

But he suppressed everybody!

It was impossible to not be dazzling even if he did not want to.

Being grabbed by Feng Qingxuan, Ye Yuan was a little embarrassed.

But, in front of the geniuses from all the heavens, he really could not brush her face aside.

Upon denying it, Feng Qingxuan probably could not even lift her head in the future.

After all, he owed Feng Qingxuan a debt of gratitude.

Ye Yuan heard Long Jian say before that when he went to the Vermilion Bird Clan back then, Luan Qinghe actually had some qualms against him.

It was Feng Qingxuan who advocated strongly until Luan Qinghe agreed to take action.

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not deny it, Feng Qingxuan also let out a long sigh of relief.

She naturally knew that Ye Yuan was not interested in her.

But, no idea since when, she was already unable to extricate herself.

“Ye Yuan, help me take revenge!” Feng Qingxuan said.

Ye Yuan did not hesitate and nodded his head and said, “Okay!”

“Hehehe?… Feng Qingxuan, are you blind? You’re not chasing the All-Heavens List and Thousand Souls List, dual lists’ number one genius, and actually went to pursue a good-for-nothing?” Yu Yan said with a charming laugh.

Not far away, Wang Ningyan also had a mocking look.

Clearly, she was very disdainful with Feng Qingxuan’s way of doing things.

The moment Kong Tan heard, he laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… boy, have you gotten bewitched by Feng Qingxuan and don’t know who you are anymore? You said that you’re going to take revenge for her?”

A hint of coldness flashed across Ye Yuan’s eyes, and he said, “That’s right! You killed many true spirits. You have to pay the price!”

Kong Tan laughed loudly and said, “Then, this fiend wants to see how you, a puny little lower Emperor Vast Heaven, take revenge! This fiend is waiting for you right here!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You, kowtow to the true spirit race and apologize! Otherwise, these fiends that you brought, none of them will be spared!”

Kong Tan laughed.

Yu Ran also laughed.

A brat actually boasted so shamelessly.

Yu Ran laughed herself into fits and said, “Feng Qingxuan, what kind of hothead did you find? He really dares to say anything!?Hehehe?

…”

Kong Tan laughed and said, “There’s no word called ‘sorry’ in this fiend’s dictionary! Come, let me take a look at how you’ll spare none of us!”

Bang!

Right at this time, Yang Qing pushed Yu Ran away.

The latter had a blank look, not knowing what had happened.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had many people. They all knew about this.

But regardless of whether it was Kong Tan, Yu Ran, or Wang Ningyan, or the rest, they all did not think that these people would listen to a lower Emperor Vast Heaven’s orders.

Ye Yuan’s strength was at the bottom of the barrel among this group of people.

How could they, these people, be convinced by Ye Yuan?

“Big Brother Yang Qing, you’ve hurt me! How can you do this to a girl?” Yu Ran said in a spoiled manner.

At this time, Yang Qing already put away his flippant expression and said with a cold smile, “Scram to one side! How can I, Emperor Azuresky, be someone that you can match up to? Also, the blind ones are you guys! Fairy Feng is the only one who can see what others cannot!?Tsk tsk,?Fairy Feng, you really have foresight! Ye Yuan this punk is just a little bit worse than me, Emperor Azuresky!”

As he said, Yang Qing gave Feng Qingxuan a thumbs up.

The latter also had a proud look.

Meanwhile, Ye Yuan felt a headache come on.

Yang Qing’s words made everyone dumbfounded.

What was this guy talking about?

“Yang Qing said that Wang Ningyan and Yu Ran are blind. Isn’t that scolding himself? Uh, this guy is really a living treasure!”

“However, what background does that boy have? To actually only be a little bit worse than Yang Qing?”

“Got to be kidding! All-Heavens List and Thousand Souls List, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven only has Yang Qing alone. This boy is simply a nobody!”

“Ah!?I understand. This boy is definitely some human major power’s descendant!”

“Mn,?you make a lot of sense!”

… …

Everyone was at a loss. Yang Qing actually even scolded himself in order to prop Ye Yuan up.

Just what was this Ye Yuan’s identity?

Hence, people started speculating about Ye Yuan’s identity.

Yang Qing scolded himself but was completely oblivious to it. Looking at Kong Tan, he sneered and said, “You’re the second place, Kong Tan, right? I advise that you’d better kneel down and apologize. Otherwise, you all will really be wiped out! Ye Yuan never bluffs people when talking! You’ll really die!”

Yang Qing said it solemnly. Kong Tan’s heart became somewhat uncertain.

But he could not discern, no matter what, what Ye Yuan had to back him up!

“Yang Qing, who the hell do you think you are, to also dare talk nonsense to this fiend? This fiend is genuinely enraged this time! Don’t need you all to make a move. This fiend will kill you all first! Everyone, kill for me!” Kong Tan shouted angrily.

“Moron!” Yang Qing’s mouth curled as he scolded. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Yuan said coolly, “The fiend race members, leave none behind!”
