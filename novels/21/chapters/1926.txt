Chapter 1930: I’ll Accept It!

In the darkviolet arena, two auras were currently in the midst of fierce fighting.

One of the auras was vast like the ocean, being boundless. But the other appeared extremely weak in front of it.

However, that weak aura was steady like a monolith. No matter how the tide surged, it was unable to move it in the slightest too.

The powerful one had sweat seeping out on his forehead, while the weak one was concentrating quietly; unmoving as a pine tree.

“Condense!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry; the pill formed!

Li Danqing let out a sigh. Bowing toward Ye Yuan, he said, “Many thanks for Brother Ye’s guidance. This Li candidly admits defeat.”

This Li Danqing was the powerhouse ranked third in the darkviolet arena, a Six-star Alchemy God.

But he was still defeated in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “I dare not say giving pointers; we’re just exchanging notes. Brother Li’s strength is formidable and already infinitely approaches Dao Realm. Just one more step and you’ll be able to leap over the dragon gate!”

Mentioning this, a hint of joy flashed across in Li Danqing’s gaze, and he said smilingly, “Getting Brother Ye’s guidance is just perfect. This Li had some comprehension and hope to be able to break through to the Dao Realm in one stroke this time!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then I’ll congratulate Brother Li in advance!”

Winning this match, Ye Yuan already won 80 matches in a row at the darkviolet arena. He just needed to win another 20 matches and he could advance to blackscale.

Ye Yuan’s winning streak momentum was simply unstoppable.

Although these Six-star Alchemy Gods were much stronger than Five-star Alchemy Gods and their soul force also many times more powerful, they were still too weak to stand up to competition in front of Ye Yuan.

This kind of pill battle prohibited directly using soul force to attack the other party. One could only use the momentum formed when refining their pill to affect the other party.

Otherwise, with the soul force of Six-star Alchemy Gods, wanting to annihilate Five-star Alchemy Gods was simply too easy.

Of course, with Ye Yuan’s means, even if the other party really used soul force to assault him, he also did not fear in the slightest.

With the Soul Suppressing Pearl around, this sort of action could only be courting death.

Ye Yuan succeeded in defending the arena and was just planning to leave when suddenly, a figure dashed up the stage.

This was a middle-aged man dressed in black robes, looking at Ye Yuan with a sneering look on his heart.

The middle-aged man in black robes said, “You’re Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan did not recognize the other party, but he clearly did not come with good intentions. Ye Yuan naturally could not be bothered with him and was directly going to go down the stage.

The middle-aged man in black robes frowned, his figure moving, blocking in front of Ye Yuan as he said with a cold snort, “I’m talking to you, are you deaf?”

The judge frowned slightly and said, “Yu Ying, what are you here at the darkviolet arena for? Are you trying to cause trouble? Don’t you forget the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s rules.”

“Yu Ying! Turns out that he’s Yu Ying!”

“Terrifying person! This is a super powerhouse ranked in the top five of the blackscale. It’s said that he reached the Dao Realm ten thousand years ago!”

“Looks like the arrival did not come with good intentions! With this, there’s a good show to watch.”

...

The moment that judge opened his mouth, a commotion immediately broke out below the stage. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Clearly, Yu Ying’s name was extremely resounding. These people had all heard of it before.

It was just that blackscale alchemists were different from darkviolet. Each one of them was a big shot whose name shook a region, rarely showing face. Hence, the people who saw them were also very few.

Now, that judge said Yu Ying’s name; they were naturally extremely shocked.

It was just that they were very curious why Yu Ying would find trouble with Ye Yuan.

Yu Ying said coolly, “Wang Jian, none of your business! I naturally know the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s rules. No need for you to remind me.”

Judge Wang Jian was similarly a blackscale alchemist, his status extremely high.

Except, Wang Jian’s status in the blackscale level was clearly much worse compared to Yu Ying.

Yu Ying’s gaze stared at Ye Yuan heatedly and said, “Brat, heard that you look down on my Springwind Hall and said that my Springwind Hall’s elder isn’t even qualified to meet you?”

Yu Ying was also Springwind Hall’s elder!

Hearing Springwind Hall’s name, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly.

He did not say such words before. Apart from Jiang Manor, he did not come into contact with the Springwind Hall’s people.

Ye Yuan thought of Jiang Hua straight away. It was just that Jiang Hua was merely a measly little Jiang Manor’s steward, so how could he possibly invite a blackscale alchemist to come and deal with him?

Most likely, the problem lied with Jiang Yuan!

Very soon, Ye Yuan figured out the sequence of events clearly.

It was just that he could not quite figure out why Jiang Yuan would be pushed around by a puny little steward.

Seeing Ye Yuan not speak, Yu Ying was extremely irritated and said in a solemn voice, “You think that by not speaking, you can smoke your way through today?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “If I say that I didn’t say before, would you believe?”

Yu Ying smiled coldly and said, “Coward who doesn’t dare to admit what he did! Just based on your bit of strength, you also dare to challenge my Springwind Hall?”

Ye Yuan looked at Yu Ying and said coolly, “Alright, just take it as I provoked your Springwind Hall, so what then?”

Ye Yuan knew that there was probably some misunderstanding involved. But this Yu Ying’s attitude made him very displeased.

The other party clung to his view that he provoked the Springwind Hall and clearly did not give him the chance to explain. Then ... provoke away then!”

A mere blackscale alchemist, he did not take him seriously yet.

Yu Ying laughed loudly and said, “What a conceited brat! Think that you won a few matches at the darkviolet arena and you’re very impressive? Let me tell you something; only by reaching the blackscale arena will you know how weak you are!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and said, “Blackscale arena? In my eyes, it’s also merely thus!”

Arrogant!

Too arrogant!

Even the audience below the stage were all stunned.

Such overbearing words, Ye Yuan really dared to say it!

Actually, ever since gold arena, Ye Yuan rarely went all out to refine pills.

These alchemists all wanted to seek experience from him. Ye Yuan did not conceal his abilities either and would often guide these alchemists to refine pills.

This way, the grade that he refined naturally would not be too high. It just basically maintained above divine-grade.

It was just precisely because of this many people thought that when Ye Yuan refined high difficulty medicinal pills, he would not be as astonishing as before.

Of course, his strength was still the strongest.

Refining level six or seven difficulty medicinal pills, it was impossible for these darkviolet alchemists to refine divine-grade.

Hence, at this time, Ye Yuan felt that Ye Yuan’s boast was bragged a little too big.

Even Wang Jian’s brows also could not refrain from knitting tightly together.

After all, he was a blackscale alchemist too.

“Haha! The blackscale arena is merely thus? Brat, you really dare to boast shamelessly! Since you look down on the blackscale arena, then let’s make a bet. How about it?” Yu Ying said with a big laugh.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Use whatever you can come up with, I’ll receive it.”

“Fine! You and I have an alchemy battle right now, if you lose, scram out of Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital for me, and you’re never to enter the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion again in this lifetime!” Yu Ying said with a cold smile.

“If you lose?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

“Me? There’s no way I’ll lose! If I lose, I’ll also scram out of Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital, never to enter Alchemy Celestial Pavilion again in this lifetime!” Yu Ying said without the slightest hesitation.

The moment Wang Jian heard, he could not help turning pale with fright.

These two people were rare talents, existences who were highly likely to enter the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion in the future and become Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders.

Losing any one of them was a tremendous loss to the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion.

“No way! Everyone is an alchemy celestial alchemist! You mustn’t harm the harmonious spirit!” Wang Jian said.

But Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Okay, I’ll accept it!”
