“This kid is also pitiful, to actually provoke the Zhao three brothers.”

“Isn’t that so? The Zhao three brothers are well-known genius disciples in Celestial Deity level sects!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“That kid is just a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord. Do you guys think that he’ll choose to kowtow or choose to have both legs broken?”

“It’s definitely to kowtow! Even if he offends the Thundercloud Sect, as long as he can stay in the Shadowmoon Sect and do chores, there will always be a possibility of rising again.”

...

With a show to watch, quite a few people stopped their footsteps and crowded around to watch.

They were currently all guessing which option Ye Yuan would choose.

Of course, the majority of the people felt that Ye Yuan would choose the first one.

After all, in their eyes, it was impossible for Ye Yuan to win against the peak Seventh Firmament Divine Lord Zhao Xi.

But Zhao Xi’s words made Ye Yuan’s gaze gradually turn cold.

He and Zhao Xi had no grudges nor enmity. But this guy still transferred his anger to him and wanted to send him to his doom because of Han Yong.

“If I don’t choose any?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Zhao Xi smiled and said, “You must choose! Because if you don’t choose, I’ll help you choose the second one.”

Ye Yuan said, “Then ... I’ll choose the third one.”

Zhao Xi froze and said angrily, “I didn’t give you a third option! Still not choosing? I’ll help you choose!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The third one was added by me. Everybody go to the Shadowmoon Sect together and participate in the entrance examination, isn’t that good?”

Zhao Xi’s face turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “You’re toying with me?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I wanted to save you a bit of face. Looks like your reputation is still considerable, if you were to get beaten by me in front of so many people, how humiliating would that be?”

The moment Zhao Xi heard this, he could not help letting out a big laugh as he said, “You? Beat me? Hahaha, this is the funniest joke that I’ve heard! Kid, I changed my mind, now, I’m going to cripple both your hands and legs! Let you unable to even crawl!”

The surrounding people all used eyes like looking at an idiot to look at Ye Yuan. A Fifth Firmament Divine Lord pummeling A Seventh Firmament Divine Lord, was he trying to be funny?

There was a small stage in-between!

This kind of fool was actually coming to take part in the Shadowmoon Sect’s entrance examination too. What a wonder.

Zhao Xi was thoroughly enraged by Ye Yuan. He formed claws with his fingers, the world power of Seventh Firmament Divine Lord gushed out frenziedly, directly grabbing towards Ye Yuan’s arms.

Zhao Xi had an imposing momentum, this grab was determined to succeed.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan threw out a palm swift like lightning, inconceivably quick!

Crack!

Ye Yuan attacked extremely precisely, directly disregarding Zhao Xi’s world power, grabbing the webbing between his thumb and index finger and crushed fiercely. His fingers snapped at the sound of it!

“ARGHH!!”

A scream came over, Zhao Shu and Zhao Zhao’s expressions changed.

Zhao Shu was alarmed in his heart. Repelling Han Yong with one move, he glared at Ye Yuan and said, “Punk, let him go! Otherwise, you’ll die very horribly!”

Everyone all looked at this scene in incredible shock, feeling that it was preposterous to the extreme.

Indeed subduing the enemy in one move!

However, it was completely contrary to what they thought.

The powerful Zhao Xi was actually restrained in one move.

Ye Yuan gave an ‘oh.’ Loosening his five fingers, he actually let go of Zhao Xi.

The five fingers were connected to the heart, Zhao Xi hurt until he broke out in cold sweat.

He did not expect to fail miserably in a simple task, the anger in his heart already billowing to the sky.

The moment Ye Yuan let go, his left hand grabbed toward Ye Yuan’s throat like lightning.

He wanted to take Ye Yuan’s life!

However, he was fast, but Ye Yuan was faster than him!

Crack!

Another crisp bone-breaking sound. The five fingers of Zhao Xi’s left hand were also directly broken by Ye Yuan.

“ARGHH!!”

Zhao Xi’s mouth emitted an even more shrill scream than just now, akin to a pig getting slaughtered.

Ye Yuan made his move neat and tidily, without the least bit of sloppiness.

Zhao Shu and Zhao Zhao’s faces changed again and they said in anger, “Kid, do you not understand our words?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I understood. Didn’t I already let go? It was he who courted death by wanting to kill me. I only broke his five fingers, so it’s already considered courteous.”

Zhao Zhao’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Kid, you’re very courageous, to actually dare break my third brother’s ten fingers! If you can leave alive today, my Zhao Zhao two words will be written upside down!”

Bang!

His voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan raised his feet and directly kicked on Zhao Xi’s knee, directly kicking his knee joints to pieces.

Another bone-piercing severe pain was transmitted to his brain. Zhao Xi’s eyes rolled back and he fainted from the pain.

When Ye Yuan heard, he smiled faintly and said, “Your meaning is that I can only stand here and let him kill me? Huhu, now, what do you still have to say?”

All around, everyone all drew cold breaths.

They were all shocked by Ye Yuan’s strength, but they were even more shocked by Ye Yuan’s means!

He actually crippled Zhao Xi in front of Zhao Zhao!

In their view, Zhao Xi underestimated the enemy too much just now, that was why he would be restrained by Ye Yuan.

But Zhao Zhao’s strength was at the Eighth Firmament Divine Lord Realm!

Ye Yuan’s action was undoubtedly seeking death.

When Zhao Zhao saw Zhao Xi’s miserable appearance, the muscles on his face were twitching.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s ruthlessness also made him extremely apprehensive.

His expression changed several times and he finally said, “Brat, you let go of Zhao Xi, and then I’ll let you leave!”

By the side, Han Yong was long dumbfounded from watching. He thought that Ye Yuan would be dead for sure this time. He did not expect that Ye Yuan was so vicious. Not only did he not die, he even returned Zhao Xi’s words to him, directly crippling him.

Hearing Zhao Zhao’s words, Han Yong’s expression changed and he said, “Ye Yuan, don’t believe him!”

But Ye Yuan smiled nonchalantly and said, “Everyone will be fellow apprentices in the future. We’ll be meeting frequently, falling out too hard isn’t good.”

Finished talking, he directly made his move and threw Zhao Xi over.

Zhao Shu’s figure moved, hurriedly catching.

But at the same time, Zhao Zhao moved!

His aura was more than ten times stronger than Zhao Xi’s!

Han Yong blocked in front of Ye Yuan with a flash without thinking.

Bang!

The two people forcefully exchanged a blow. Han Yong retreated several dozen steps in a row before barely managing to stand firm.

While Zhao Zhao did not budge an inch.

Striking Han Yong back, Zhao Zhao did not stop in the least bit, rushing over toward Ye Yuan.

Suddenly, a youth in white slowly walked out and said to Zhao Zhao, “Alright, Zhao Zhao, give me face, let this matter go like this!”

When Zhao Zhao saw this person, his expression could not help changing, and he said in a solemn voice, “Yang Fan, this is none of your business! This punk beat my third brother until like this. Could it be that you want me to swallow the insult and endure in silence?”

Yang Fan said coolly, “You also know my relationship with Han Yong. If you still don’t know what’s good for you, then I can only take action!”

Ye Yuan looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly. He originally wanted to teach Zhao Zhao a lesson. He did not expect that someone threw a wrench in the works.

But the aura on this Yang Fan’s body was very powerful. He was already not far from becoming a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord.

Clearly, Zhao Zhao was very wary of him.

Zhao Zhao’s expression changed several times, and then he gritted his teeth and said, “Fine, I’ll give you face today! But, when this kid is unable to pass the entrance examination, I’ll definitely take his life then!”

Yang Fan said coolly, “At that time, it’s naturally up to you!”

Zhao Zhao’s face fell and he said to Zhao Shu, “Bring along Third Brother! Let’s go!”
