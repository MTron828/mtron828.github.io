Chapter 2905 Mutual Destruction!

Ye Yuan felt like his dantian was about to explode.

A tremendous power was towing the origin of blood, wanting to pull it out of his body.

Fortunately, dozens of Hegemon Realms made a move at the same time.

This power was sufficient to obliterate heaven and decimate the earth!

It was also Ye Yuan’s first time feeling the power of Hegemons’ origin power!

That kind of power originated from Heavenly Dao and carried the might of heaven.

This feeling undoubtedly had tremendous benefits for Ye Yuan.

In the future, it had tremendous reference significance when he stepped into the origin realm or even the Hegemon Realm.

But at this time, he could not care less.

He was currently like a grinding disc, being scrubbed back and forth by two formidable forces.

Want to die!

This was Ye Yuan’s only feeling at this time.

Too strong!

Although the collision this time was not a physical showdown, the showdown of origins held other dangers!

He spurted blood fog from his mouth wildly, instantly falling into the brink of death.

And right at this time, a powerful life force poured into his physical body, healing his injuries frenziedly.

“Guard your heart. Bring out your Dao sword and suppress the origin of blood! This thing is very important to both you and us. We mustn’t let him take it back!” Hegemon Cloudmount’s words sounded in Ye Yuan’s ears.

This life force was extremely strong. Although his physical body was constantly being destroyed, it was also being frenziedly healed.

The power of a Hegemon was unimaginable!

Ye Yuan’s heart stirred slightly, hurriedly converging his mind, Dao sword suspending in his dantian, suppressing the origin of blood.

This wisp of blood origin was not strong. Ye Yuan’s strength was sufficient to suppress it.

The Chaos Bloodstone had high regard for Ye Yuan because of the aura of the Dao sword. It naturally would not harm him.

This wisp of blood origin was just to help him comprehend the Dao of origin. But it became incomparably berserk under the Chaos Bloodstone’s calling, desperately wanting to break free from Ye Yuan’s constraints.

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword burst forth with a powerful pressure, forcibly suppressing this origin power in his dantian.

As for the outside world’s raging storm, that was not something that he could intervene in.

Presumably, with dozens of Hegemons joining hands, it would not be to an extent of being unable to deal with a Chaos Bloodstone, right?

After all, this was not his main body descending in person.

Sure enough, in both sides’ origin battle, the Heaven One Hegemons took the upper hand very quickly.

Especially Divine Lord as well as Hegemon Cloudmount, Hegemon Blacksun, these few. Their strength was really formidable to the extreme.

It was also Ye Yuan’s first time feeling Divine Lord’s strength. His power of origin was like a dazzling sun, beating everyone’s power of origin.

But this silent confrontation was dangerous to the extreme.

If not for Hegemon Cloudmount protecting Ye Yuan, he would long have been wrecked into residues.

Although they took the upper hand, each Hegemon’s face had solemnity written all over it.

There were dozens of Hegemons taking action at the same time!

This kind of terrifying line-up was sufficient to obliterate heaven and decimate the earth. It actually merely suppressed the Chaos Bloodstone!

The other party was too strong!

“This thing is too strong! If its main body descended in person, we can’t resist at all!” Divine Lord’s face revealed an unprecedented solemn expression.

Hegemon Blacksun also said in a solemn voice, “What the hell is this thing? Its wicked aura is surging to the sky! If this thing is born, I’m afraid that it will be able to sweep across the 33 Heavens on its own!”

Hegemon Cloudmount said, “This thing coexists with the blood race. The stronger the blood race is, the greater his strength! Now, the momentum of its rise is probably unstoppable already!” With one sentence, everyone fell silent.

This was a huge crisis!

“This is no longer our Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s affair! We must break through the boundary wall and announce to all the heavens and deal with the blood race together! At this rate, it’s not impossible for the 33 Heavens to fully fall into the enemy’s hands!” Hegemon Blacksun said.

Divine Lord said in a solemn voice, “It’s no use! I’ve long contacted the fellow daoists in the other heavens, but I can’t contact them at all now! Most likely, the crisis of the boundary wall has already swept throughout all the heavens! Furthermore, with our current situation, we can’t break through the boundary wall at all!”

“I’ll go!” Suddenly a voice interrupted.

The group of Hegemons were taken aback and could not help looking at Ye Yuan in surprise.

You, a lower True Sovereign Heaven, wanted to traverse through the heavens?

You’re kidding me!

But Ye Yuan did not have this self-awareness and said in a solemn voice, “No matter what, we should make a trip to the heavens! Fighting the enemy separately like this, we’ll only each be routed by the blood race in the end! Even if I bring back some news, it will be of tremendous help to us too!”

His words made the group of Hegemons fall silent.

Back then, when the Labyrinth Divine Palace swept throughout the heavens, it provoked all the heavens’ Hegemons to join forces before they managed to suppress it.

But currently, all the heavens were fighting the enemy on their own and were unable to resist the blood race at all.

One shouldn’t look at how the Heaven One Alliance achieved successive victories currently. Those were just miracles created by Ye Yuan by relying on numerous means.

But this kind of miracle actually only affected those below the Emperor Realm.

The battle situation above Emperor Realm did not change in the slightest.

Even if a Hegemon was killed, Heaven One was still in an absolute weak state of affairs.

Furthermore, the blood race became increasingly stronger, the end result would still be the Absolute Heaven Barrier being breached and Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven falling into the enemy’s hands!

This kind of outcome, everyone was actually mentally prepared since a long time ago.

It was just a matter of time.

Divine Lord nodded and said, “What Ye Yuan said is right. We should make a trip to the various heavens! It’s just …”

Ye Yuan said, “Just let Master Cloudmount assist me. I’ll naturally have a way to pass through the boundary wall!”

When the group of Hegemons heard, they were extremely surprised.

Sending a True Sovereign Heaven out of the boundary wall, this was simply a fantasy tale!

Everyone was currently discussing it when Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly changed.

The origin of blood within his body became berserk once again!

“Sh*t, that guy wants to detonate the origin of blood!” Hegemon Cloudmount cried out in alarm.

At the outside world, the Chaos Bloodstone also became extremely irascible after suffering a silent loss?

Detonating the origin of blood caused tremendous harm to his main body too.

Unless there were no alternatives, he did not want to as well.

But at this time, he felt that he was being schemed against by Ye Yuan in all manner. This time, he even mobilized dozens of Hegemon Realm powerhouses to encircle and suppress him. This genuinely enraged him.

Hence, he wanted to kill Ye Yuan at all costs!

Detonating the blood origin, this was something that happened internally. No matter how strong the Hegemons were, they were unable to stop it too.

Sensing the terrifying fluctuations coming off Ye Yuan’s body, Hegemon Cloudmount’s eyes turned bloodshot.

He was too satisfied with this disciple!

If Ye Yuan died here, he would be overwhelmed to the extent where he wished that he was dead! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Pffft!”

Ye Yuan spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, the blood origin swelling crazily. His Dao sword was almost unable to suppress it anymore.

His body was like a balloon being inflated with air, swelling up rapidly.

If he exploded, he would be ground to dust! No matter how weak an origin was, that was also an origin!

This kind of thing should never have existed in a True Sovereign Heaven’s body in the first place.

If an origin detonated, that power would be absolutely horrifying!

Ye Yuan also did not expect that the Chaos Bloodstone would actually risk mutual destruction and detonate the blood origin! At the critical moment, a hint of ruthlessness flashed across Ye Yuan’s eyes!

He controlled the Dao sword and stabbed over toward that trace of blood origin!
