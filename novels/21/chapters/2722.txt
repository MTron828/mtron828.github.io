“What?! Three days?” Wei Yu got a shock too.

An outer-sect disciple, forget about three days, it was impossible to break through two minor realms in three years too.

When he thought about it, there was only a heavenly alchemist that could accomplish this.

Wei Yu’s brows furrowed and he said, “Could it be that he’s a heavenly alchemist? But he’s an ascender!”

It was difficult for ascenders to become heavenly alchemists, this was general knowledge.

Although the Pill Alliance had unified the Five Great Heavenly Regions now, this kind of extremely high-quality heavenly pill, even if it was a grade one heavenly pill, it rarely strayed outside too.

Hence, it was naturally very hard for Wei Yu they all to imagine how Ye Yuan did it.

Zong Rui smiled bitterly and said, “Even if it’s my Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s first seat, he also can’t make someone break through two minor realms within three days! Moreover, that Han Fang’s aptitude is extremely poor!”

Wei Yu’s expression turned sullen and he said with a cold snort, “Who cares what he is! Provoking my Seven-star Heavenly Sect, the outcome can only be death! Second Elder will be exiting seclusion tomorrow. I’ll go and personally request him to take action!”

As he said, Wei Yu left angrily.

A day later, Tang Quan exited seclusion.

“Second Elder, that brat is really too condescending. He doesn’t place my Seven-star Heavenly Sect in his eyes at all! You have to help me avenge this grudge!” Wei Yu gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Four to five days had already passed, the two hoof prints on his face still had not dissipated completely.

Hearing Wei Yu’s words, Tang Quan waved his hand and said coolly, “Merely a clown jumping around, that’s all! Let him be arrogant for a few days first. On the day we set off, I’ll kill him with my own hands. At that time, it can also showcase my Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s strength!”

In the eyes of half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens, there was nothing more that they held in awe and veneration other than Saint Sovereign Heaven.

During the mystic realm trip this time, True Yang Heavenly Domain’s few major heavenly sects all sent quite a number of powerhouses over.

At that time, it would definitely be a massive lineup.

Killing people during that occasion as a sacrificial offering was undoubtedly the best way to showcase one’s strength.

… …

Getting Ye Yuan’s benefits, Han Fang naturally answered every question that Ye Yuan had.

Ye Yuan also knew that with Han Fang’s status, it was impossible to know much of Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s secrets.

However, Ye Yuan understood quite a bit about Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s situation.

It was a hazy night, Ye Yuan brought Big Yellow and exhibited spatial rule, sneaking into the night with the wind.

“Master Ye’s concealment technique is not the least bit inferior to Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!” Seeing Ye Yuan’s means, Big Yellow exclaimed with admiration.

Ye Yuan’s application of spatial rule already reached a transcendent realm.

Saint Sovereign Heaven comprehended Heavenly Dao, using Dao spells being a given, and they could hide their bodies at will.

But Ye Yuan was just Jade Sovereign Heaven, and yet, he actually already had such means. It was simply inconceivable.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Come, take a walk around the main peak first. See if we can hear any news or not.”

While talking, the two arrived on the main peak of Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

“Master Ye, the main peak is so big, how do we eavesdrop?” Big Yellow asked puzzledly.

Ye Yuan smiled and slowly closed his eyes. A faintly discernible undulation slowly spread out.

Big Yellow’s bull eyes went wide, revealing a look of disbelief.

Soul technique!

He could feel that Ye Yuan’s origin divinity power radiated out in a certain manner.

Just like tidewater, covering the entire main peak!

Furthermore, this kind of undulation was barely perceptible, it was hard to detect at all.

He was Saint Sovereign Heaven. That was how he barely managed to detect this undulation.

One could imagine, unless Jadetrue Heavenly Sect had Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, otherwise, they would not be able to find Ye Yuan at all.

This move was a soul technique in the Divine Emergence, Divine Contact!

Ye Yuan’s origin divinity power radiated out like tentacles. Using it to investigate information was the most useful.

Furthermore, this move was extremely secretive.

Unless one’s origin divinity was much stronger than Ye Yuan, otherwise, it would be impossible to discover.

Ye Yuan cultivated the Divine Emergence. One really could not find more than a few whose origin divinity was stronger than his in Jade Sovereign Heaven Realm.

Perhaps Taoist Wu Fang’s origin divinity could compete with him.

But there was basically no hope of discovering this move.

The moment Divine Contact was released, a lot of information burrowed into Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness.

“Entering the mystic realm this time, our Jadetrue Heavenly Sect absolutely cannot allow any mistakes! Whether or not our Jadetrue Heavenly Sect can find the Heavenspan Mountain and revitalize the sect will depend on this trip! Head Elder, this sect master will be personally entering the mystic realm this time. The sect’s affairs will be entrusted to you!”

“Sect Master, rest assured. Leave the sect to this old man. It’s just that True Yang Heavenly Domain’s seven great heavenly sects are all here this time. Adding in quite a number of itinerant cultivators, there are no less than 300 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses. Is there really no problem?”

“This is also something that can’t be helped! With Ancestor Jadetrue’s ability, he still fell inside back then! Now, if we don’t find more cannon fodders, we have no chance of finding the Heavenspan Mountain at all.”

“Sigh,?hope that Ancestor Jadetrue will bless us so that we can find the Heavenspan Mountain! This old man heard that there might even be Saint Exalts entering the mystic realm this time, you all have to be careful!”

“Rest assured, our goal is only the Heavenspan Mountain! A mere heavenly spirit treasure, Saint Exalts will despise it. However, the things that they want probably won’t be so easy to obtain too! Back then, nine great Saint Exalts entered Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm, but only Zhuo Bufan alone came out! It can be imagined, that place isn’t some nice place!”

… …

Big Yellow discovered that Ye Yuan’s expression became increasingly gloomy.

Hearing this conversation, Ye Yuan’s heart sank to rock-bottom.

Listening to the meaning in these words, could it be that the Heavenspan World had actually been exposed?

But, in that remote place, Ye Yuan also acted covertly. How could it be discovered?

Ye Yuan furrowed his brows, unable to figure it out after racking his brains.

Originally, Ye Yuan planned on understanding some of Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s secrets, then leaving right away.

But looking at it now, he would have to make a trip with the main force.

The Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm that Jadetrue Sect Master talked about, Ye Yuan felt confused about it.

The Heavenspan Mountain was merely a dilapidated small chiliocosm that did not even have a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse. It was clearly not some Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm.

But Jadetrue Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm said that nine great Saint Exalts entered Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm. That place should also be the last place where Yan Jadetrue fell.

All of these were like a mystery.

For this, he had no choice but to make a trip.

Furthermore, the mystic realm trip this time was likely not as simple as it seemed on the surface.

The place that even the likes of Zhuo Bufan and Yan Jadetrue were moved by, it was clearly not where ordinary Jade Sovereign Heavens could set foot in.

Therefore, this mystic realm was likely to attract many Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses to come.

At that time, it likely could not dispense with a bout of terrible fighting.

And what Ye Yuan was more worried about was that if the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm was really in the Heavenspan World, then with so many Heavenly Stratum powerhouses entering, the Heavenspan World would likely be plunged into an abyss of suffering.

Back then, a group of people entering the Immortal Grove World almost completely destroyed the small world.

And the destructive power of Heavenly Stratum powerhouses was on a completely different level from those Empyreans and Heavenly Emperors back then!

Heavenly Stratum, that was a supreme realm!

Even the most ordinary Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum was a supreme god in the Lower Realms too!

They would be able to slaughter hundreds of millions of living things with a wave of a hand.

Quietly withdrawing Divine Contact, Ye Yuan withdrew from the main peak, then headed to a mountain at the back.

“Master Ye, what happened? Your expression is very ugly,” Big Yellow asked worriedly.
