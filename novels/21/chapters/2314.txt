Chapter 2318: Declined Human Race Alchemy Dao!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold, killing intent billowing to the sky.

But Originguard smiled faintly and said, “Angry? I know that your talent is amazing, you can even jump levels to defeat Nineorigin. It’s just that ... you’re still just an ant! In this great world, the ones who really dominate are all us, the top powerhouses!”

Medicine Ancestor’s gaze turned slightly sullen and he said in a cold voice, “Who on earth is your esteemed self? If you still don’t say it, this ancestor is going to be impolite!”

Originguard gave him a glance, shook his head, and said, “You’re the current human race’s alchemy path’s number one person? Too weak!”

Medicine Ancestor narrowed his eyes and said coolly, “Shamelessly boasting! Does a trash like you even understand what Alchemy Dao is?”

Originguard did not explain either. He just smiled faintly, and then he held his palm up. A crystal-like ball appeared in his palm.

When Medicine Ancestor, Ye Yuan, Sacred Ancestor High Priest, and the rest saw this scene, each and every one of their pupils constricted.

Originguard’s move was clearly developing a world with Alchemy Dao. It was extremely brilliant.

This level of means was absolutely in the same class as Medicine Ancestor, an existence who was not inferior to Medicine Ancestor in the slightest.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he was truly incomparably shocked.

He did not expect that the divine race actually still had this kind of heaven-defying existence.

The others were similarly shocked. They had never heard before that the Heavenspan World still had an existence that could rival the Medicine Ancestor.

Where did this guy pop out from?

“Do you guys think whether or not this ancestor understands what Alchemy Dao is?” Originguard said with a faint smile.

Medicine Ancestor had a shocked face as he said, “You ... Who the hell are you?”

“This ancestor thought that even if the human race’s Alchemy Dao didn’t recover to its peak state, there’s at least 70% to 80% strength too. I heard that there’s an alchemy conference here. That’s why I’d come here to wipe out the Alchemy Dao powerhouses. But ... you guys disappoint this ancestor too much! Your current strength is really too weak compared to the human race’s heyday period!”

Originguard’s words carried thick disappointment, clearly feeling that he somewhat made a big fuss over nothing.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he said, “You want to make use of this opportunity and round the human race alchemy powerhouses in one fell swoop, cutting off the human race’s reinforcement force!”

Originguard smiled faintly and said, “That’s right. You’re very clever. During the last Doomsday Battle, the human race’s alchemy path powerhouses gave us huge problems. If not for those few old fellows, continuously delivering medicinal pills, we wouldn’t have failed at all. Hence, this ancestor naturally won’t miss this opportunity that only comes once in a blue moon. It’s just a shame that looking at it now, this ancestor made too much of a fuss over nothing.”

Everyone was shocked, becoming speechless.

“Doomsday Battle? What’s that?”

“Shamelessly boasting thing! Just the likes of these few guys also want to destroy the world?”

“Reckless and blind thing, bringing a bunch of swarthy-looking monsters and you want to destroy the world?”

... ...

Doomsday Battle, this sort of thing, the vast majority of the people present never heard of it before.

The name sounded frightening, but without truly experiencing this kind of battle, who would really pay attention to this name.

However, some old fellows with very high seniority had clearly heard of this thing before, each and every one of their expressions becoming very ugly.

“All shut up for me!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, interrupting everyone’s discussion, and said in a solemn voice, “Put away your arrogance! These guys are very strong! Want to get out alive, put away your sectarian views, and everyone work together and be of one mind! Otherwise, not a single one can escape.”

Towards this, the vast majority of the people were very disdainful.

Their arrogance already penetrated deep into the marrow. Why would they care about a bunch of guys that they had never heard of before?

Originguard smiled faintly and said, “Looks like my divine race hasn’t come into being for too long already. You humans have already forgotten who is the true master of the Heavenspan World! Today, let the Heavenspan World tremble!”

It was only to see him make a gesture, causing the divine race to bring out the abyss monsters, and then they charged over.

For a moment, a dense mass charged over, shocking heaven and earth!

When the powerhouses who came to take part in the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference saw such a line-up, their faces also could not quite help changing. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Just a bunch of monsters! Everyone, attack together and exterminate them!”

Someone shouted in the crowd.

This suggestion immediately got everyone’s response.

For a moment, one terrifying attack after another shot over toward above the void.

Above the sky, all kinds of terrifying martial techniques roared over, rumbling noises sounding out all around.

Except, these attacks were extremely scattered and undisciplined. The commotion seemed big, but actually, it did not pose lethality at all.

In such a large-scale battle, an individual’s strength was infinitely weakened.

Moreover, the strength of abyss monsters was far superior to same rank humans.

In this first wave attack, the abyss monsters actually directly resisted it. Furthermore, the losses were not severe.

When the human race powerhouses saw this scene, each and every one of their expressions changed drastically.

While at this time, the abyss monsters’ first wave attack also arrived.

One wave of attack after another fired into the crowd neat and tidily, and exploded apart.

Bang, bang, bang

...

The explosion sounds lingered on incessantly. Screams linked up together.

This wave of attacks made the human race powerhouses suffer heavy losses.

And in this short while, both sides were already fighting in close quarters, clashing together.

The moment they clashed, the human race powerhouses discovered that something was wrong.

The opponents were too strong!

The abyss monsters that they looked down on were all extremely powerful. Furthermore, their skin was coarse and their flesh thick, with their defensive power being extremely strong. It needed three or four people to join forces to face the enemy before they could barely manage to block it.

It was just that that way, the human race’s manpower became severely inadequate.

While the divine race’s powerhouses went even more without saying.

The moment they entered the battle, it was like tigers entering a flock of sheep, the lethality being extremely great.

The name of the divine race was displayed in its entirety at this moment!

“How could they be so strong? This ... This kind of combat strength is on a completely different level!”

“Is this the divine race? They don’t have world power at all! So what they are using is the power of Heavenly Dao!”

“The Heavenspan World has such a powerful race? Why have I never heard of them before?”

... ...

The human powerhouses were finally shocked!

Only at this time did they know that Ye Yuan did not warn them for nothing.

In fact, the divine race’s might was even greater than Ye Yuan said!

At this time, their gazes when looking toward Originguard became different.

If those ordinary divine race members were already so strong, then what about this progenitor-level powerhouse?

The human powerhouses were all akin to facing a great enemy, going on careful alert one after another.

Originguard smiled faintly and said, “Looks like you all already understand what’s the divine race. My divine race is the race chosen by the heavens; only cultivating Heavenly Dao! Before the previous epoch, it had always been our divine race ruling the Heavenspan World. Regardless of whether your human race, demon race, or other races, you were all our slaves! And today, we’re going to take back all that we lost!”

Everyone turned greatly pale from fright, all incomparably shocked.

The divine race was actually the former ruler!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

All of a sudden, many human powerhouses backed out, shuttling into the void, attempting to escape Cloudheart Realm.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Don’t run away! The void must have already been locked!”

His voice had yet to fade when several dead bodies fell down from the void, looking utterly ghastly.

Originguard smiled lightly and said, “Don’t think about escaping. There are 36 thousand Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses in the void outside of Cloudheart Realm, casting the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art! Even Deva Fourth Blights can forget about escaping here too! Kid, you’re really a talent, it’s just a shame that ... you can’t be used by us!”
