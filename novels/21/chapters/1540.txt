Chapter 1544 Open Your Dog Eyes and Take a Look!

At Deyi Hall, Wu Feng had been waiting for the news over there all along.

Hearing about the Miracle Hand Parlor’s situation, Wu Feng was delighted.

“Huhu, this old man didn’t expect it. This kid incurred public wrath! I want to see how he cleans up the mess today!” Wu Feng said with a grin.

The manager was also very surprised by this situation currently.

He did not expect that of the south city’s six major forces, the three great families and two major gangs, all made a move against a puny little Miracle Hand Parlor.

But thinking about it, the manager also felt at ease.

This punk was too arrogant, insisting on hanging what ‘Will Grant All Requests’ plaque. Wasn’t this looking for a fight?

“Master played a vicious move this time! That Huang Qian, even Four-star Alchemy Gods are helpless. If that boy can be saved, it would be preposterous,” the manager said with a smile.

Wu Feng smiled and said, “Heh, that kid is too arrogant. I’m teaching him how to behave! This Heavenspan World is too big. He has only lived for a few days. The illnesses that he hasn’t seen are too many, to actually dare boast so shamelessly.”

The things that Meng Huo knew were just a bit.

Back then when Wu Feng promised Huang Haoran, it was not just because he had a good relationship with Huang Haoran, it was also because his stubborn temper flared up at that time, insisting on overcoming this difficult hurdle.

Alchemists were all a little stubborn, Wu Feng was no exception either.

Such a hard to come by symptom, Wu Feng naturally wanted to overcome it.

For the sake of Huang Qian, Wu Feng did not even scruple to bring him into the inner city’s Pill Tower, asking his master for help.

In the end, he still could not find out anything about the condition.

Wu Feng’s master was a Pill Tower’s Four-star Alchemy God. Even he could not do anything about it. Could this kid then?

He would not believe it even if he was beaten to death!

...

At this time, inner city’s Pill Tower, a benign-looking old man was currently lecturing a young man.

“Already found out about your younger sister’s news. She’s currently at the south city’s Cinnamon Street. You go and bring her back,” the old man said.

The young man had a look of embarrassment and said with a bow, “Master Xuan Yu, my sister is too mischievous and has troubled Master.”

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “Your sister is all right in everything. She’s just a little too condescending. Her alchemy talent is indeed incomparable. But this path isn’t what talent alone can determine. Other people’s talent is inferior to hers, but others are more hardworking than her!”

The young man sweat profusely and said, “Master lectured justly! Capturing her back this time, I’ll definitely discipline her well!”

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “You don’t have to be like this. That lass’s personality, you know it. The more stubborn you’re with her, the more stubborn she is to you. You don’t need to forcefully bring her back as well. Let her suffer a bit of hardship outside. It might be a good thing for her. The Pill Tower’s competition is about to start. You just bring her back before the competition and that will do.”

The young man bowed and said, “Yes!”

...

Inside the Miracle Hand Parlor, Ye Yuan’s speed of diagnosing and treating was very fast.

Chen Biao, Ding Song, and the rest had already waited for a very long time. But the expressions on their faces were somewhat different from when they just came.

Those people queued in front of them could be said to have their symptoms vanish as the medicine took effect.

And the people who requested pills, what they got were actually all divine-grade medicinal pills!

Divine-grade!

Even though what Ye Yuan refined today were all not some too difficult to refine medicinal pills, divine-grade medicinal pills, this in itself already indicated many problems.

This guy really had the ability!

But very soon, Chen Biao and Ding Song felt at ease.

To be able to bring Zhu Yongtian back to life, Ye Yuan’s strength was definitely extraordinary.

They were very confident in their coming to find trouble today. What the three great families and two major gangs sent here today were all famous complicated and strange ailments of the south city. The numerous big-shot Alchemy Gods of south city were unable to resolve them.

Finally, it was Chen Biao’s turn.

“Carry him over,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Chen Biao did a hand gesture and ordered people to carry in front of Ye Yuan.

“Kid, if my brother has his diagnosis and treatment delayed, I will smash this shop of yours!” Chen Biao threatened him.

The moment Meng Huo heard, he flared up and said with a cold smile, “You just try making a move! Do you really take my Thunderclap Gang to have no one?”

But Chen Biao said indifferently, “Since I brought the person in, then his life is your responsibility! If he dies, it means that your ‘Will Grant All Requests’ signboard is a sham! Why can’t I smash it?”

Meng Huo could not help choking when he heard that and said in a cold voice, “Master Ye hasn’t treated him yet, of course it doesn’t count! Chen Biao, if you dare to make trouble, do you believe that you can’t walk out of Cinnamon Street today or not?”

Chen Biao directly took out a divine artifact and said with a cold smile, “Your father doesn’t believe it. What can you do to me?”

The others also all watched the two people fight gloatingly, smiles all over their faces.

Those present currently all hoped for the Miracle Hand Parlor to close up shop. They naturally stood on Chen Biao’s side.

Furthermore, the three great families and two major gangs moving out collectively also drew quite a number of people to surround and watch.

Normally, these people would have long flown off the handle and drove everyone away.

But today, they wanted to see the appearance of the Miracle Hand Parlor getting disgraced.

“Fifth Head, this is your mistake! Since he came in, then you guys naturally have to take responsibility.”

“Yeah. Saying it like this isn’t fair. No matter which medicinal shop you go to, when the person enters the door, curing or killing is all a matter of the alchemist’s level.”

“This person looks like he already can’t make it, you guys still wanted him to wait in line. Isn’t this harming people?”

...

The onlookers also clamored to get a word in, saying until Meng Huo was livid with rage.

“Alright, carry away!” right then, Ye Yuan suddenly spoke up.

Everyone was stunned. A hint of a smug smile revealed on the faces Ding Song, Huang Haoran, and the rest.

Resolved it so quickly?

This guy was an utter fraud!

“Hahaha ... Brothers, smash for me! Smash it hard! Just this level, still will grant all requests?”

After staring blankly, Chen Biao let out a loud laugh and immediately instructed his subordinates to make a scene.

“You dare?!” Right then, a pretty figure stepped forward bravely, standing in front of Chen Biao.

“Where did this girlie come from? Don’t want to live anymore? You guys failed to save him and still don’t let us smash the shop?” Chen Biao glared fiercely and roared at Ning Siyu.

But Ning Siyu was completely fearless and said with a disdainful smile, “Open your dog eyes and take a look. He’s already brought back to life. What qualifications do you have to smash the shop?”

Everyone froze once more. Chen Biao said with a big laugh, “Brought back to life? He’s still lying ... lying ... Eh, you’re fine?”

When Chen Biao was laughing hard, that middle-aged man on the stretcher slowly opened his eyes and actually got up on his own.

When everyone saw this scene, they all clicked their tongues in wonder.

The waxen complexion on the middle-aged man’s face disappeared. His face was still a little haggard, but his whole person looked like he was no longer in jeopardy.

“This ... What’s going on here?”

“F*ck me, this is also too magical. In but a few sentences time, he cured the person?”

“This Master Ye really isn’t boasted out. His means are simply fantastical!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

...

The looks of amazement on everyone’s faces could not be concealed no matter what.

Astonishment was written all over Chen Biao’s face. Only now did he understand that Ye Yuan’s meaning was that the person was cured and could be carried away, and not can’t be cured and to be carried away.

This ... was too freaking bullsh*t!

An illness that was not cured after wandering more than half of the south city’s medicine shops, but coming here and in the time it took to say a few sentences, it was then cured?
