Chapter 2453: Don’t Provoke Him!

Swoosh!

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly disappeared from where he stood. In the next instant, Celestial Master Miluo’s hair stood on end, a feeling of danger suddenly arising!

Behind him, a terrifying force was currently erupting!

The void shook, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly appeared 100 feet behind Celestial Master Miluo.

And his hand was already holding the Limitless God Killing Bow and Sword of Spacetime!

The arrow was on the bow!

It was only to see his fingers loosen. An incomparably sharp cold light erupted in an instant!

At such a close distance, forcefully resisting the Sword of Spacetime released by the Limitless God Killing Bow, the power could be imagined.

All of these happened in the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint; inconceivably fast.

Clearly, the gray-pupil Ye Yuan had already planned everything.

In an instant!

Celestial Master Miluo did not have time to turn around, all the hair on his body stood on end, and the power of protection instantly released.

This sudden scene, even Tian Qing did not react to it.

Everything happened too suddenly.

Boom!

It was only to hear a loud noise. Celestial Master Miluo’s body was directly blasted flying.

It was also that his strength was too strong. Otherwise, with this sword, even if it was a Deva Fifth Blight, they would have to die with regrets too!

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s calculation ability was unparalleled in the world!

An ice-cold personality unleashed his calculation ability to the extreme.

Swoosh!

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s figure vanished once more, escaping into the chaos world once again.

When he appeared again, he already caught up to Celestial Master Miluo again.

It was just that at this time, Tian Qing already reacted to it.

His figure suddenly disappeared, arriving behind Ye Yuan in the blink of an eye.

If Ye Yuan killed Miluo, he would kill Ye Yuan!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared again, dodging this strike.

Tian Qing looked at Ye Yuan in astonishment, immensely shocked.

The feeling that this gray-pupil Ye Yuan gave him was even more dangerous than earlier!

Logically speaking, with Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm and strength, it was completely impossible to harm Celestial Master Miluo. Even if under the circumstances that he was caught off-guard.

But Ye Yuan’s timing was grasped too brilliantly. He made use of the time when everyone was stunned and instantly controlled everything.

Miluo was seriously injured!

Harming someone right under Tian Qing’s eyelids, who he harmed was even Celestial Master Miluo, this kind of quasi-progenitor level expert.

This sort of thing, probably only the gray-pupil Ye Yuan could do it.

Tian Qing looked at the gray-pupil Ye Yuan with a frown and said in a deep voice, “Who are you?”

While Yue Mengli looked out-of-sorts and muttered, “I-It’s him! He appeared again! Who ... Who on earth are you?”

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and said, “That fool, always acting on impulse. In the end, he needs this eminence to come out and clean up his mess!”

Finished saying this, he looked at Tian Qing again and said coldly, “Don’t doubt your eyes, I’m Ye Yuan! We’re of one body and two sides. It’s just that this guy normally suppresses me. Now, his divine soul is sucked away. So this eminence can finally come out! You listen up. This eminence will cultivate in the Heaven Lineage. Don’t let people come and disturb me. Otherwise, not even chickens and dogs will be spared below late-stage Nine-marks Heavenly Dao!”

Finished saying, gray-pupil Ye Yuan flashed and directly left the ancestral land, leaving behind the three people who were dumbfounded with shock.

Tian Qing’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He was actually threatened by someone!

He, this Heavenspan World’s number one person, was actually threatened by someone!

“Puhwark!”

Celestial Master Miluo spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, gasping heavily for air. Clearly, he had sustained extremely severe injuries.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Lord Tian Qing, this guy actually dared to threaten you! He must be killed!”

Tian Qing’s face became black as the bottom of a pot and he said in a solemn voice, “How to kill? Didn’t you notice? This Ye Yuan’s calculation ability is extremely terrifying! His threat is even greater than that Ye Yuan before! Furthermore, this Ye Yuan doesn’t have the slightest emotion at all. If we really provoke him, he’ll really kill off the entire Heaven Lineage!”

Celestial Master Miluo’s complexion was deathly pale, and he said gloomily, “Could it be ... could it be that nothing can be done about him?”

Tian Qing sighed slightly and said, “Forget it, let him be! He didn’t leave. He should be waiting for that Ye Yuan previously to come out.”

For some reason, Tian Qing suddenly somewhat missed that Ye Yuan a short while ago.

That Ye Yuan would consider the feelings between Yue Mengli, and would not kill the innocent indiscriminately.

But this Ye Yuan was completely different.

He could feel the gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s iciness. That sort of iciness made even him feel somewhat piercing to the bone!

He did not doubt in the slightest that the gray-pupil Ye Yuan would really kill off his clansmen!

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan would only calculate and not talk about feelings!

This type of person was the most troublesome.

Furthermore, by relying on the calm to the extreme calculation ability, wanting to catch the gray-pupil Ye Yuan was even more impossible.

Hesitating to take action out of fear of damages, Tian Qing could only be threatened!

It was just that Tian Qing was a little curious. Why did the gray-pupil Ye Yuan have the confidence, thinking that the Ye Yuan before could still come out?

One had to know, this was the Eight Extreme Divinities; the eight divinities who created the powerful divine race!

Celestial Master Miluo opened his mouth wide, his face in disbelief.

Why did he take this hit in vain?

But thinking about that scene just now, he also shuddered a little without it being cold.

It was also that Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was lacking. Otherwise, that hit earlier, he would have long already fallen!

That strike earlier was too strong!

Tian Qing looked towards Yue Mengli and asked, “You’ve seen before this gray-pupil Ye Yuan? What’s going on?”

Yue Mengli shook her head and said, “I also don’t know what’s going on, but this gray-pupil Ye Yuan is very strong. Don’t provoke him! The gray-pupil Ye Yuan seems to have extremely terrifying judgment, and he can control everything on the battlefield! When Nineorigin brought me back to the clan back then, Ye Yuan turned into this state in the end. Then, he forcefully knocked Nineorigin down by a major cultivation realm with the realm of Empyrean!”

When the two people heard that, they both had solemn looks on their faces.

Indeed, not to be provoked!

A human Empyrean leapfrogged a major cultvation realm and beat Nineorigin who was already late-stage Eight-marks at that time, into a wretched state.

This sort of combat power was simply appalling to hear.

Even if it was Tian Qing, it was impossible to do it too!

... ...

In the Heaven Lineage, it completely exploded.

A human punk actually occupied the place with the strongest spiritual energy, and started cultivating as if no one else was present! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

F*cking hell! Too arrogant!

“Punk, what nerves you have, to dare behave wildly at my Heaven Lineage?”

“Punk, quickly scream! Otherwise, when the lords come, you’re dead for sure!”

“Still not going? I think that you’re courting death!”

Swoosh!

A streak of cold light flashed past, then, he died.

Everyone was dumbstruck with amazement, looking at this scene in disbelief.

You occupied our territory and still dared to kill our divine race’s people?

Too arrogant!

One powerful aura after another arrived with a howl.

The Heaven Lineage’s powerhouses rushed over one by one.

This brat from the human race was really too arrogant, completely not taking the divine race seriously at all!

“Punk, this progenitor gives you one last chance. Leave immediately! Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself!”

The one talking was Tian Xing, Heaven Lineage’s second-generation ancestor!

His status in the Heaven Lineage was second only to Tian Qing. His combat power was also second only to him, virtually rivaling the seven lineage’s progenitors!

No one felt that there was a problem with him saying this.

But right then, a thunderous voice rolled over from the direction of the ancestral land.

“Tian Xing, let him cultivate on Profound Heaven Ridge. Instruct all the clansmen. Don’t provoke him!”

Everyone was dumbfounded with shock.
