Chapter 1631 Immortal Binding Rope

a battle where three half-step celestial deities went all out. how intense the battle situation would be?

after a bout of fierce fighting, the three people all sustained considerable injuries.

swoosh! swoosh! swoosh!

seeing the three people seriously injured, those divine lord realm powerhouses who plucked up their courage and followed finally could not resist making a move.

the three people sneered at virtually the same time. raising their hands, it was several powerful attacks.

bang! bang! bang!

these people were directly blasted into dregs and did not even leave behind bones.

song yu smiled coldly and said, “a bunch of ants also have wishful thinking of obtaining the origin magnetic divine mountain!”

lei yi said, “carrying on fighting like this isn’t a way either! with the three of our strength, we can only cause destruction to all three sides in the end!”

ka suo said, “then what do you say?”

lei yi said, “first, obtain the origin magnetic divine mountain, then it’s not too late to fight! otherwise, the three of us beat each other to death and didn’t even touch the origin magnetic divine mountain. isn’t that too unjust?”

ka suo and song yu froze, discovering that what lei yi said was very reasonable.

right now, this kind of situation, it was really hard to say what the final result would be.

“fine, as you say!” ka suo said.

“i have no objections either!” song yu said.

lei yi said in a solemn voice, “go!”

the three people’s figures moved, sprinting over toward the origin magnetic divine mountain.

but very soon, their faces became ugly.

the closer they got to the origin magnetic divine mountain, the harder they found it to walk!

the incomparably powerful forcefield crushed them until they could not catch their breath.

they felt like their feet had grown roots, unable to even pull them up.

one had to know, these three people were all celestial deity realm powerhouses. the power of this forcefield could be seen at a glance.

“damn it! the origin magnetic divine mountain’s origin magnetic field is getting stronger and stronger. at this rate, we can’t go over at all!” song yu said in a solemn voice.

ka suo’s fleshy body was the strongest among the three people. but at this time, he was also not much better than the other two.

the three people even unleashed their strength to suckle on the teat, but their speed got increasingly slower.

“there’s still a distance of around 1000 feet. whoever makes it through, this origin magnetic divine mountain will be his!” ka suo said in a cold voice.

a distance of 1000 feet, normally to these three people, it was merely a matter of lifting their feet.

but now, it was a short distance away and yet, poles apart. it was so far beyond reach.

“argh!!”

ka suo roared wildly, struggling until his face turned red, before barely managing to take a step.

this step seemed to have exhausted all the strength in his body.

ka suo gritted his teeth and said, “why is this origin magnetic divine mountain’s forcefield so strong?”

“puhwark!”

song yu was finally overwhelmed, spewing out a mouthful of blood.

at this time, song yu felt like he was carrying an entire mountain on his back, being crushed until he could not even straighten his waist.

but with the precious treasure ahead, none of them would give up, urging the world power in their entire bodies to the limits, using their all to fight against this powerful forcefield.

however, this was still futile.

at this point, even advancing a step was also a luxury.

an entire six hour’s time passed, the three of them merely walked out around 200 feet. there was still a distance of 800 feet away from the origin magnetic divine mountain.

under the powerful forcefield, the three of them were already seriously injured. it was much more severe than when they came to blows earlier.

but at this time, inside a chunk of rock, a hint of a scornful laugh flitted across the corners of gao yuan’s mouth.

for gao yuan to be able to live until now, what he relied on was not just him taking advantage of his seniority. he truly had genuine ability.

his concealment skill was very brilliant. he had once used this method and survived inside mystic realms countless times.

today, it indeed played a role again.

he slowly walked out of the rock, looking at the three severely injured people, immensely pleased with himself.

although song yu three people were seriously injured, their divine senses were still very sensitive.

when they saw gao yuan suddenly pop out at this time, their eyes revealed a look of surprise.

“hahaha ... so what if celestial deity powerhouse? isn’t it still me who has the last laugh? weren’t the three of you very arrogant earlier? be arrogant again now!” gao yuan laughed wildly and said.

currently all of song yu trio’s energy was used to resist the origin magnetic divine mountain’s forcefield.

once they withdrew their strength, that horrifying forcefield would be like a tall mountain falling from the air, crushing them into minced meat!

if they wanted to withdraw, they must back out little by little.

it was also precisely because of so that gao yuan dared to show up at this time.

otherwise, even if the three of them were seriously injured, he also would not dare to easily show face.

bang!

gao yuan grinned hideously. lifting his hand, a beam of divine essence fired out, flying straight for song yu.

song yu’s feet were rooted at this time and did not even have the qualifications to dodge, forcefully receiving this blow.

even though there was the effect of the forcefield, when this attack reached song yu here, the power was already no strong.

but at this time, this palm was simply a death-hastening talisman to him.

song yu spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood wildly!

crack!

this palm’s effect was a chain reaction. his body was overwhelmed. the powerful forcefield was crushing him until his bones cracked.

his expression was livid, aware that he no longer had the strength to move forward. hence, he slowly stepped back and withdrew.

“song yu, if you dare to retreat, this old man will send you to the west right now, do you believe it?!” gao yuan shouted fiercely[1].

song yu got a fright and indeed no longer dared to retreat, and could only grit his teeth and persevere.

when gao yuan saw the situation, he laughed unbridledly and said, “song yu, haven’t you always been very arrogant for so many years? be arrogant with this old man again!”

song yu’s expression was incomparably ugly. this was really a tiger landing in a plain being bullied by a dog.

he never thought that he would actually succumb at gao yuan’s hands.

this ant in his eyes actually controlled his life and death now!

gao yuan was incomparably refreshed in his heart. the grievance accumulated in his heart for so many years all erupted.

rumble!

gao yuan raised his hand and it was another palm. song yu was powerless and could only forcefully receive this blow.

this palm was not heavy and could not kill him. but it increased his pressure.

“hahaha ... this old man scammed wu xingtang to death back then, now, i scammed you to death too! so what if talented? aren’t you still going to die in this old man’s hands? isn’t it still this old man who has the last laugh?” gao yuan laughed loudly and said.

song yu gritted his teeth and said in a cold voice, “gao yuan, don’t you get cocky! the thing that even we can’t obtain, with the likes of your bit of strength, can you get it?”

lei yi also said in a cold voice, “if you can walk within 2000 feet, consider it my loss!”

gao yuan had a look of disdain and said, “the three of you fools! who said that obtaining this origin magnetic divine mountain has to walk in front of it? open up your dog eyes and take a look at what’s this?”

while talking, there was an additional golden-colored rope in gao yuan’s hands.

the moment the three people looked, their expressions could not help changing drastically and they exclaimed, “immortal binding rope!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

gao yuan smiled coldly and said, “at least you guys have a bit of knowledge! when this old man came out this time, i specifically borrowed this celestial deity mystic treasure, immortal binding rope, from city lord his excellency! now, open your dog eyes and look at how this old man acquires this origin magnetic divine mountain!”

gao yuan gradually walked in the direction of the origin magnetic divine mountain, the pressure on his body also became greater and greater.

however, when he walked 5000 feet away from the origin magnetic divine mountain, he came to a standstill.

it was only to see seals being formed in his hands. that golden rope was seemingly like a spiritual snake, winding over toward the origin magnetic divine mountain.

[1] sending to the west means sending to heaven, killing him.
