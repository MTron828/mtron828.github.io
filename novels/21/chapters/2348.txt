Chapter 2354: Final Suspense!

In the fifth year, Ye Yuan’s god of war points grew by another 450 thousand, reaching 2.15 million.

This way, Ye Yuan used five years’ time and rose to the top three at a rocket speed!

The entire city was shocked!

No one could have thought that in the last ten years, the God of War Golden List actually changed heavens!

After close to a thousand years, more than 12 thousand unpredictable children fought hard before they had today’s results.

But who knew that Ye Yuan only used a short five years and climbed to third place.

The questioning voices grew louder and louder. The questioning of a loophole in the rules grew more and more.

Clearly, everyone was very unconvinced by this result.

But now, an even bigger question was placed in front of everyone. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

That was ... could Ye Yuan surpass the top two on the ranking list? Could he make a heaven-defying comeback at the last moment?

These two shook the rest off far behind them.

“Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian suddenly making a determined effort. It wouldn’t really be because of Ye Yuan, right?” Suddenly, someone said weakly.

There had been this argument previously, but everyone felt that this argument was too ridiculous.

But today, when Ye Yuan climbed to third place, this notion suddenly popped up in everyone’s heads once more.

This time, everyone did not find it ludicrous anymore.

Although this argument was still a little preposterous, Ye Yuan’s speed of ascending was already sufficient to make the top two take it seriously.

“That’s impossible! How would Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian know that Ye Yuan’s god of war points will suddenly balloon?”

“It can basically be confirmed now that regardless of whether it is Ye Yuan, Wan Zhen, or Zhang Lian, they are all at the Myriad Beast Battle Plain. Maybe they met?”

“It’s also not entirely impossible! Previously, Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian’s god of war points clearly slowed down! These few years, they’ve made new heights year after year. Clearly, they are going all out. If there’s no sense of pressure, how can they possibly work so hard?”

... ...

With drive and without drive, those were two completely different things.

Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian already swept away all opponents five years ago.

For ten years, there was no one who could catch up to them at all.

Hence, even if they worked hard, it was also just a challenge to themselves, and would not push themselves to the limit.

But if they ran into Ye Yuan and witnessed Ye Yuan’s combat strength, that would be totally different.

This kind of situation was very likely!

For a moment, everyone fell into shock.

Could it be that Ye Yuan really relied on his strength and obtained so many god of war points?

The following few years completely became these three people’s tussles!

In the sixth year, Ye Yuan obtained another 400 thousand points, reaching 2.55 million; that was only a step away from Zhang Lian’s 2.8 million!

Everyone’s nerves were wound up tightly.

In the seventh year, Ye Yuan still obtained over 400 thousand god of war points, reaching more than 2.97 million.

This year, Ye Yuan was still ranked third.

However, he was merely just a few thousand god of war points away from the second place.

Without any doubt, this time next year, Ye Yuan would replace Zhang Lian who was at the second place, becoming the God of War Golden List’s second place!

No one could have thought that Zhang Lian, who was as steady as Mount Tai, would actually be surpassed by someone one day!

Sure enough, in the eighth year, Ye Yuan obtained another 400 thousand god of war points, surpassing Zhang Lian in one stroke, becoming the God of War Golden List’s second place!

On this day, the entire Cloudaid City was seething with excitement.

“Damn it, even though I’ve been mentally prepared for a long time, when this day really arrived, it still feels unthinkable!”

“What the f*ck! I can’t figure it out! Even Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian can only obtain over 100 thousand god of war points in a year. So how did he achieve 400 thousand a year?”

“Zhang Lian has already been pulled down. Right now, there’s only Wan Zhen left!’

... ...

Zhang Lian had already been surpassed. Ye Yuan was only left with a final opponent, Wan Zhen!

This person was Cloudaid City’s insurmountable existence. He was a powerful opponent that made everyone not dare to look directly at him.

Starting from roughly the second hundredth year, there was already no one who dared to have the thought of surpassing him anymore.

This notion became increasingly stronger towards the end.

But no one could have thought that in the last ten years, a guy who had never entered the God of War Golden List before, suddenly skyrocketed heaven-defyingly, arriving at the position of second place!

And now, Wan Zhen’s god of war points was 3.98 million!

Ye Yuan’s god of war points was currently 3.42 million!

There was a difference of 560 thousand god of war points between the two!

Could it be surpassed?

Staying in the Primeval War Realm for close to a thousand years, these unpredictable children had never discovered that they would get so nervous.

Was it Wan Zhen narrowly defending his throne of number one, or Ye Yuan making a heaven-defying comeback, rising up amidst insignificance, and climbing to the summit?

This suspense would not be revealed until the final year.

It was another year in a blink!

On this day, the God of War Golden List was released!

When Wan Zhen’s name appeared, everyone immediately seethed with excitement.

Someone exclaimed, “170 thousand! This year, Wan Zhen actually obtained 170 thousand! With this, the number one throne is secured!”

4.15 million!

This was Wan Zhen’s current god of war points.

Following that, it was Ye Yuan!

3.83 million!

This year, Ye Yuan obtained 410 thousand god of war points!

Now, the difference between the two was 320 thousand.

“Hahaha, indeed still couldn’t make it! Wan Zhen finally showed his stuff at the final juncture! At the rate of this speed, Wan Zhen just has to obtain 150 thousand god of war points next year and he’ll surely win!”

When Jiang Zhe saw this result, he could not resist laughing out loud.

Finally, Ye Yuan still failed!

Even though he knew that Ye Yuan’s current performance was already sufficiently heaven-defying.

Even though he knew that it was only because Ye Yuan lacked time.

But, for Ye Yuan to fail to get first place, he just felt happy!

As long as Wan Zhen got more than 150 thousand, that would be a gap of 470 thousand.

According to Ye Yuan’s current rate of speed, it was roughly a little more than 400 thousand every year, it was impossible to defy the heavens next year.

The outcome is a foregone conclusion!

Seeing this result, many people also let out a sigh of relief.

“Sure enough, still unable to surpass!”

“Wan Zhen is so strong. He has always been sitting firmly at first place but was surpassed by Ye Yuan using ten years. I’m really unable to accept this!”

“There must be something fishy! He must have grasped a loophole in the rules. Otherwise, how can he possibly be so heaven-defying?”

... ...

Those present were all unpredictable children, all rare geniuses.

Wan Zhen being strong, that was having proceeded steadily step by step, and through a thousand years of hard work. They could accept it.

But Ye Yuan used a thousand years to gain enlightenment on Dao, and suddenly jumped out in the last ten years to compete for the rankings.

Furthermore, he only used ten years’ time and reached second place.

They were unable to accept such a thing emotionally.

Maybe, they just did not hope to be crushed.

Tenth year, apart from the top 30, practically everyone returned to Cloudaid City.

There was already no point in continuing to cultivate.

Everyone was waiting for the last release of the God of War Golden List!

The release this time would determine who could get the final ten spots!

Suddenly, several beams of light flashed. There were suddenly several dozen additional people at the rebirth point.

Clearly, the hour had arrived, and everyone was transported back.
