Chapter 2396: Return

“Three years have already passed, and yet that kid hasn’t woken up yet. Most likely, he won’t be able to wake up anymore!”

“Heh heh, good that he can’t wake up! If not for that punk, it would have been impossible for me to not even obtain the ten major inheritances! Best that he’ll be a living corpse in the future!”

“Haha, Brother Carefree’s resentment towards him is very deep! But thanks to him, we can cultivate for a thousand years more in the Primeval War Realm.”

“That’s right! That’s right! Haha, if he knows about this in the spacetime turbulence, he’ll probably be angered until he vomits blood, right?”

... ...

In the Primeval War Realm’s Celestial Beast Plain, several young men had just finished a great battle and were currently discussing about Ye Yuan who was swept into the spacetime turbulence.

One of them was precisely Noble Carefree, Yu Tanzhi, who harbored deep resentment toward Ye Yuan.

Three years’ time had already passed in the outside world since Ye Yuan was swept into the spacetime turbulence, which was also 300 years in the Primeval War Realm.

The Primeval War Realm was indeed a holy land for cultivation.

These 300 years, to them, these unpredictable children, their improvement had been tremendous.

The strengths of Yu Tanzhi these people were already able to enter the Celestial Beast Plain to kill fierce beasts.

Because of Ye Yuan, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets made the exception and let the unpredictable children continue staying in the Primeval War Realm to cultivate.

As for the outside world’s affairs, he could only request those big shots to come forward and monitor the divine race’s activities strictly.

Fortunately, in these three years, the divine race did not cause too big of a commotion. Both parties were currently in a stalemate.

Among the few people, a youth in black robes said with a cold snort, “Yu Tanzhi, you’re a little too narrow-minded! If Ye Yuan really can’t come back, that will be a massive loss to our human race! Perhaps, our human race will fall into a state of eternal damnation! At that time, I hope that you can still laugh!”

But Yu Tanzhi said disdainfully, “Wan Zhen, don’t you scare this young noble anymore, saying it like we haven’t witnessed the divine race before! Let me tell you this. Before this young noble came in, I’ve already had a taste of the divine race’s powerhouses! Two words, merely thus! They are indeed much stronger than ordinary human powerhouses, but to us, these top unpredictable children, they are not considered very strong! Whether that punk dies or not, doesn’t have much influence on the battle situation! Moreover, do you feel that someone can escape from the spacetime turbulence?”

Yu Tanzhi made no attempt to hide his dislike for Ye Yuan. Because of Ye Yuan, he could not even enter the top 11, losing an opportunity to become stronger.

“Oh, is that so? Then, I’m afraid ... I’ll have to disappoint you.”

Just as Yu Tanzhi was gloating over others’ misfortune, a voice seemingly came from eternity, making everyone present jump in fright.

Yu Tanzhi’s expression changed wildly and he exclaimed, “Who! Who is it! Playing tricks, get out for this young noble!”

He spread his divine sense out, but could not find any clues at all.

But right at this time, a shocking scene appeared.

The void had an opening torn open by someone. This kind of tearing was not just traversing through the void, but spacetime being torn apart at the same time.

As if someone crawled out of the long river of time and space.

A figure walked out of that opening.

“Ye Yuan!” Wan Zhen’s pupils constricted, looking at this person in disbelief.

This figure was none other than precisely the Ye Yuan who had traveled back from the previous epoch!

When he went, it was him who triggered heaven’s secrets.

But when he returned, it was Jian Rufeng who triggered heaven’s secrets, connecting the two spacetimes.

Perhaps it was inevitable; maybe it was accidental.

But the trip to the ancient times touched Ye Yuan’s heart deeply.

This journey, he felt like he had spent as long as tens of billions of years!

Clearly just a few thousand years of life, but he felt like he had experienced seas change into mulberry fields and mulberry fields into seas.

When he returned, his mentality was already completely different.

All the way until he heard Yu Tanzhi’s voice in the spacetime turbulence did a sense of warmth arose spontaneously.

When he saw Ye Yuan again, Wan Zhen felt like he did not know him anymore.

The person was still that person.

But the feeling that he gave him was totally different.

Originally, when they looked at Ye Yuan, he was like a little brother.

But the current Ye Yuan standing in front of him, he seemed to be facing a major power who had experienced the accumulation of countless years.

Somewhat like ... Grand Ancestor Spacetime!

No, he was even more archaic than Grand Ancestor Spacetime and made people not dare to look directly at him.

“Y-Ye Yuan! This ... how is this possible? You ... You were clearly swept into the spacetime turbulence! How can you possibly return to reality?” Yu Tanzhi had an expression like he had seen a ghost, even stammering when talking.

Ye Yuan looked at Yu Tanzhi, shook his head, and said with a sigh, “Being able to go, naturally means being able to return. What’s strange about it? Also, that kind of ignorant words just now, don’t say them in the future. The divine race’s true elites haven’t appeared at all. You’re being ignorantly boastful here. Who gave you the courage? The ancient times’ myriad races’ majors had immensely formidable means. Which one wasn’t stronger than you? But they were nearly completely annihilated under the divine race’s cruel oppression. I really don’t know where your arrogance comes from.”

Ye Yuan had witnessed before the ancient times’ geniuses. In terms of talent, temperament, and courage, they were virtually a hundred times stronger than Yu Tanzhi. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It seemed like the human race had indeed been comfortable for too long.

Yu Tanzhi smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “What are you being cocky in front of this young noble for? In these 300 years, this young noble cultivated bitterly, my cultivation advancing by leaps and bounds, I’m god knows how many times stronger than back then! But you drifted in the spacetime turbulence for 300 years. Right now, you’re not this young noble’s match at all! What qualifications do you have to lecture this young noble?”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he could not help being unable to stifle his laughter.

In ancient times, he was already canonized as a saint.

Although his strength had not reached the apex, his aura of a sovereign was already formed.

Was this Yu Tanzhi blind, to actually not even be able to perceive this, to actually provoke him.

Only to see him stand with his hands behind his back as he said smilingly, “Is that so? Then bring out the strength that you’ve cultivated bitterly these few years, and let me take a look.”

Yu Tanzhi grinned hideously and said, “I had precisely that intention! You caused this young noble to fail to get the ten major inheritances, today, I’ll take back a bit of interest first! After going out of the Primeval War Realm, this young noble will make you regret being born in this world!”

After talking, Yu Tanzhi released his divine essence, his aura skyrocketing. He had actually reached peak Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor already!

He was just half a step away from Deva Realm!

To him, there was no difficulty in transcending Deva First Blight at all.

And his power of laws was also several times stronger than before.

These 300 years, he worked harder after knowing humiliation, and his strength was indeed no idea how many times stronger than back then.

However, the Wan Zhen by the side revealed a strange look.

Before Ye Yuan left back then, he could still see Ye Yuan’s actual situation clearly.

But now, he could not see through Ye Yuan at all.

The present Wan Zhen having obtained the ten major inheritances and also having experienced 300 years of bitter cultivation, his strength was no idea how many times stronger than back then.

However, when he faced the current Ye Yuan, he did not even have the courage to attack at all anymore!

Did Yu Tanzhi, this guy’s head, have a hole?

Can’t he see how powerful Ye Yuan was?

“Hahaha, go and die!”

Yu Tanzhi released his strength fully, smashing over towards Ye Yuan like a group of meteors.

This move could likely even forcefully contend with Deva powerhouses!

However, Ye Yuan still stood with his hands behind his back, as if he did not have the intention of making a move.
