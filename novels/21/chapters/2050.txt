Chapter 2054: Great Battle Starting

The matter of the Myriad Treasure Tower withdrawing from the Southern Border Alliance stirred up titanic waves in the alchemy world.

As one of the several leviathans, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s strength was second only to the Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.

But no matter how powerful, it was also merely one of the seven leviathans.

Myriad Treasure Tower withdrawing out of the Southern Border Alliance was equivalent to waging war with the entire Southern Border.

Although it was not a slaughter of real swords and spears, this kind of merchant war was even more intense than fighting.

With the Myriad Treasure Tower’s strength, could it survive under the besieging of the six great leviathans and all of the alchemy factions?

“Empyrean Flutterfeather was too impulsive. For the sake of a measly little Ye Yuan, he’s actually going to become enemies with the entire Southern Border!”

“Heh, Grandmaster Ye is indeed impressive, can even say that it’s also not overboard to call him the Southern Border’s number one person. It’s just that one person’s strength is ultimately limited.”

“You guys still don’t know, right? The six leviathans already opened their shops all in the Myriad Treasure Tower’s territory. With this, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure might even have to come forward!”

“The six leviathans move so quickly. Empyrean Flutterfeather’s intestines should be green with regret now, right?”

...

Everywhere in the Southern Border, the alchemy world was virtually all discussing this matter.

In their view, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s decision was too unwise. It was clearly pushing the Myriad Treasure Tower into the fire pit.

At that time, it would probably need Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure to come forward and clean up the mess.

Heavenly Emperor powerhouses normally did not intervene in the affairs of the secular world. But this kind of major thing, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure likely would not be able to look on either.

But at this time, on Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital’s Cloud Dream Mountain, golden light rippled, horrifying aura came out from it.

Zi Yu and Qing Yun, two people, were feeling this undulation, being incomparably amazed in their hearts.

“Too strong, this is the undulation of Ancestor Realm powerhouses! Didn’t expect that Elder Ye stepped into the Ancestor Realm so quickly and actually fought until he’s evenly-matched with Master who broke through to Ancestor Realm!” Zi Yu said with alarm.

They looked down on Ye Yuan back then, but Ye Yuan and Empyrean Flutterfeather’s battle thoroughly astounded the two of them.

Alchemy Intent Resonance, that kind of spectacular sight was still vivid in their impression until now.

Qing Yun pursed her mouth and said, “Even if he broke through to the Ancestor Realm, so what? He still isn’t Master’s match! Master even defeated Empyrean Pilljade in this Cloudpill Summit. The present Master is the Southern Border’s number one person!”

Zi Yu also nodded and said, “That’s true. How can Ye Yuan possibly be Master’s match?”

The two people were currently talking when that astonishing aura was withdrawn.

Ye Yuan and Flutterfeather two people walked out with big smiles. Zi Yu, Qing Yun, Chen Chang, and the few elders immediately came up to greet, curious looks on their faces.

“Master, it must be you that won, right? You’re the Southern Border’s number one Alchemy Dao person!” Zi Yu said brimming with confidence.

Flutterfeather laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Southern Border’s number one person? Hahaha! My buttocks isn’t warm from seating yet and it’s snatched away by this brat! From henceforth, if a Heavenly Emperor doesn’t come out, nobody can match him! Even those few old monsters who don’t ask about world affairs are likely not Ye Yuan’s match too.”

Flutterfeather laughed very joyfully, and he also said it very easily. But when it reached the ears of Zi Yu and the rest, it was akin to a bolt out of the blue.

This meaning was that ... theirmaster was defeated?

“This ... How is this possible? Master even defeated Empyrean Pilljade in the Cloudpill Summit!” Zi Yu said in surprise.

In their hearts, Empyrean Pilljade was powerful as stars in the sky, unable to be defeated at all.

Now, their master broke through to the Ancestor Realm and defeated Empyrean Pilljade, who was the Southern Border’s number one person, an existence that nobody could defeat.

But their master personally admitted that he was inferior to Ye Yuan.

How could ... this guy be so freakish?”

Flutterfeather laughed in spite of himself and said, “I fought three rounds with Ye Yuan and lost all of them! The rank six divine pills that he refined already infinitely approaches end spirit divine pill. I’m inferior to him!”

Just like when Martial Dao realm was cultivated to later stages, the span of the quality of vast spirit divine pills was also very huge.

If divide vast spirit divine pills to lower, middle, and upper, three grade, then the vast spirit divine pills that the two people refined in the past were middle-grade.

After stepping into Ancestor Realm, the vast spirit divine pills that Flutterfeather refined already reached high-grade.

But the current Ye Yuan, when refining vast spirit divine pills, could already reach peak high-grade, being only a step away from end spirit divine-grade.

If Ye Yuan’s strength improved further, refining end spirit divine pills would likely be nothing difficult too.

Of course, talking about it was easy, doing it was hard.

After the Ancestor Realm, each step forward was far too difficult.

Flutterfeather knew that Ye Yuan’s talent was exceedingly high, but wanting to poke through this layer of windowpane paper within a short time likely could not be done.

However, even so, Ye Yuan’s strength was also sufficiently shocking already.

At present in the land of Southern Border, if Eight-star Alchemy Gods did not come out, likely no one could compete with Ye Yuan anymore.

As long as Ye Yuan broke through to the Empyrean Realm, he would be the true Southern Border’s number one person.

Hearing Empyrean Flutterfeather’s words, Zi Yu, Chen Chang, and the rest all drew a cold breath.

Three rounds, Empyrean Flutterfeather actually did not even win one match!

This showed that Ye Yuan already firmly suppressed Empyrean Flutterfeather in terms of strength.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Flutterfeather, don’t flatter me anymore. You bet the Myriad Treasure Tower on this Ye alone, this gamble is a little big! You’re so confident in me?”

Flutterfeather smiled and said, “Huhu, they don’t know your value, but this Empyrean knows! You could even create the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill. So what do a mere few kinds of commonly-seen medicinal pills count for? They all thought that you were bragging. When they witness your ability, I wonder what kind of expression it will be! In this game, I’ll surely win and not lose. Why wouldn’t I bet? Win the gamble and the Myriad Treasure Tower will be the Southern Border’s number one major alchemy faction. All of them would have to bow their heads in submission! This Empyrean is already looking forward to the appearance of Pilljade that old fogey lowering his head in front of you and me now. Hahaha!”

After saying all these, Empyrean Flutterfeather even roared with laughter.

He did not know Ye Yuan’s trump card, but he believed in Ye Yuan.

Others did not know the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill’s terror, but Empyrean Flutterfeather was perfectly clear.

Those fools, originally something that could be resolved by lowering their heads, they insisted on forcing Ye Yuan to fly off the handle.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard that and said, “Brother Flutterfeather is really a calculative demon! Huhu, just based on your trust, I’ll hand over these 15 kinds of pill formulas to you!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan casually beckoned and took out a pile of jade slips and placed them on the desk.

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “So many?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He casually picked up a jade slip and sunk his divine sense inside, his expression changing again.

Without the slightest hesitation, he switched to another jade slip.

Continuing to look one jade slip after another, the expression on Empyrean Flutterfeather’s face became more and more solemn.

When he put down the last jade slip, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was akin to having seen a ghost.

“Sigh, this Empyrean thought that I saw through you clearly, but only when I saw these pill formulas, did this Empyrean know that I still underestimated you! Just based on these pill formulas, this Empyrean wants all of them to crawl to Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital and lower their heads to you and me!”

Talking about this, rays of brilliant light seemingly appeared in Empyrean Flutterfeather’s eyes.

Ye Yuan’s trump card gave him boundless confidence.

Empyrean Flutterfeather knew that this battle would cause a one-sided sanguinary slaughter in the entire Southern Border’s alchemy world!
