Chapter 2225: The Supreme Art of War Is to Subdue the Enemy Without a Battle!

The group of Empyreans could not help being rendered speechless. Seriously, even the fiend race had legends of Ye Yuan!

However, Ye Yuan was not surprised at this.

The fiend race’s alchemy skills were too weak. There were plenty of rooms for improvement.

His casual pointer or two was naturally greatly beneficial to the fiend race’s alchemy skill systematization.

Hearing Blackfuse made small talk with Ye Yuan, Jiu Shang was at a loss on what to do.

What the freaking hell was going on here?

“Blackfuse! What’s the meaning of this?” Jiu Shang said in a solemn voice.

Blood Yama Hall ignored him and looked at Ye Yuan as he said coolly, “Source Night, your strength is decent. Why don’t you join our Blood Yama Hall and help this emperor manage the Fiend Medicine Hall? How about it?”

“Blackfuse!” In the black fog, Jiu Shang’s voice was full of alarm and anger.

It was just that the human race Empyreans all revealed strange looks.

Making the Priest Temple’s Second Sage, the Southern Border’s number one person, Ye Yuan, go and manage your Blood Yama Hall’s lousy Fiend Medicine Hall?

This Heavenly Emperor was specifically here to be in charge of jokes, right?

Ye Yuan shook his head and laughed in spite of himself and said, “You can’t afford to engage me!”

The Blood Yama Hall’s Empyreans all sucked in a cold breath.

This boy was so arrogant!

But Blackfuse did not get angry and just said coolly, “There is nobody that my Blood Yama Hall can’t afford to hire! You’re a human martial artist and don’t know the power of my Blood Yama Hall! You just have to know that with this Heavenly Emperor’s strength, I’m merely a minor character in the Blood Yama Hall too! How is it? Do you want to become a corpse here, or become my Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master?”

Blackfuse had a calm and collected look. In his eyes, Ye Yuan was merely an ant.

Letting Ye Yuan be the Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master was lifting him up to show favor.

Either die or surrender.

He believed that Ye Yuan was a clever man and knew what he should choose.

“Huhu, forget that you’re a measly little branch hall, even your Blood Yama Hall’s headquarters can’t accommodate this great deity too!”

The void vibrated, a figure slowly walked out. It was precisely Bai Tong.

Bai Tong looked at Blackfuse and could not help laughing as he said, “You’re making the Sacrificial Temple’s Second Sage, Southern Border’s number one Seven-star Alchemy God, go be your branch hall’s hall master, aren’t you afraid of stuffing your tiny temple until it explodes?”

The moment these words came out, Blackfuse’s face that was like an ancient well without any ripples, finally revealed a look of surprise.

He looked toward Ye Yuan with an astonished face, attempting to link this young man with the Southern Border’s number one person whose limelight was recently glaring.

Source Night was Ye Yuan?

Blackfuse’s heart shook wildly!

As the Blood Yama Hall’s hall master, how could he possibly not have heard of Ye Yuan’s great name before?

But he did not think that the number one Alchemy Dao person whose name shook the Southern Border was actually the Source Night back then!

“You ... You’re Ye Yuan? Yeah! Source Night (Yuan Ye), Ye Yuan, why didn’t I think of it long ago!” Blackfuse stared at Ye Yuan and said with a bitter smile.

“What? He’s the number one Alchemy Dao person, Ye Yuan, whose name shook the Southern Border?”

“Such an astonishing great figure is actually a snotty brat!”

“I heard that his Alchemy Dao already reached a transcendent realm, and he is extremely likely to be the next Medicine Ancestor!”

... ...

Blood Yama Hall’s Empyreans were all incomparably shocked, looking at Ye Yuan.

During this period of time, Ye Yuan’s name shook the Southern Border.

Even in the fiend race, Blackfuse was similarly shocked by Ye Yuan’s great name until his eardrums hurt.

It was just that he did not expect that the puny little Origin Deity Realm martial artist back then actually already grew up to become the Southern Border’s leading authority figure now.

Who was Ye Yuan?

He was the Priest Temple’s Second Sage, an existence second only to the Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

What Bai Tong said was right! His temple was too small and could not accommodate this great deity!

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “I said before, you can’t afford to engage me! Now, Brother Blackfuse, do you still want to interfere with my enmity with Jiu Shang?”

Blackfuse’s gaze turned intent, and he said with a frown, “Jiu Shang is my fiend race’s major power. How can this emperor sit by and watch him be killed by you?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The Blood Yama Hall does business too. Hall Master Blood Yama Hall, why don’t we discuss a deal, how about it?”

The moment Blackfuse heard, the corners of his mouth revealed a hint of a smile.

Talking with smart people saved things from becoming a hassle.

Their Blood Yama Hall did not have any fiend race ties.

He and Jiu Shang merely had a relationship of interest.

Why would he really care about Jiu Shang’s life or death?

Now that he knew Ye Yuan’s identity, how could Ye Yuan’s value be what a measly little Jiu Shang could be compared to?

Even with 100 Jiu Shangs being added up, he was not as valuable as Ye Yuan!

If Ye Yuan was just a human Alchemy God, then forget it. However, he was also extremely proficient in fiend pills.

This way, Ye Yuan’s value to the Blood Yama Hall was huge.

Unable to solicit, could cooperate!

“Huhu, wonder what business Master Ye wants to discuss?” Blackfuse said with a light smile.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “The Empyreans present, each person one Tyrant Blood Heavenly Fiend Pill!”

“Hiss ...” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Empyreans present all sucked in a cold breath!

Tyrant Blood Heavenly Fiend Pill was the same as the human race’s Emergence Spirit Ascension Pill, both medicinal pills that could advance cultivation.

Dozens of Empyreans present meant dozens of Tyrant Blood Heavenly Fiend Pills!

This was absolutely a splurge.

Want to talk about Tyrant Blood Heavenly Fiend Pill, it was also no big deal, the fiend race’s fiend apothecaries at Seven-star level could refine it too.

But Ye Yuan’s products were bound to be top quality!

Presently, Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills were too hard to ask for.

One of his rank seven divine pills was even more expensive than a peak Empyrean spirit treasure!

One had to know, a medicinal pill was just a one-time consumable.

While a peak Empyrean spirit treasure could be used long-term.

The value between the two was unable to equate at all.

But now, Ye Yuan actually gave away dozens of Tyrant Blood Heavenly Fiend Pills the moment he opened his mouth, how could they not be shocked?

“Lord Blackfuse!”

“Agree to him, Lord Blackfuse!”

... ...

Each and every one of Blackfuse’s subordinates hyperventilated and already could not control themselves.

Obtaining the Tyrant Blood Heavenly Fiend Pill which Ye Yuan refined, they might break through their shackles and improve their strength further!

How could they resist this sort of temptation?

As for Jiu Shang, he was long flung beyond the ninth heaven by them.

“Blackfuse, you ... you dare to sell me out?” In the black fog, came Jiu Shang’s angry roar.

Blackfuse could not be bothered with him at all. He just stared at Ye Yuan with a scorching gaze and said, “Not enough!”

He had long seen through that there was an irreconcilable grudge between Ye Yuan and Jiu Shang.

Since that was the case, why wouldn’t he demand an exorbitant price?

With him around, even if there was Bai Tong this Heavenly Emperor, Ye Yuan could forget about succeeding too.

Heavenly Emperors terrorized a region, this was not said for laughs.

As long as he was standing here, he was a ticking time bomb!

Ye Yuan clearly understood this logic too, that was why he would negotiate a deal with him.

Otherwise, why would Ye Yuan waste his breath with him?

“You say!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

This Blackfuse was a clever person too, Ye Yuan knew that it would not be so easy.

As long as the other party did not go too far, Ye Yuan could satisfy it.

Compared to a few medicinal pills, he valued Jiu Shang’s life more.

Blackfuse grinned and said, “Talking with smart people saves the effort! From now onward, my Blood Yama Hall will send five fiend apothecaries to the Pill Tower every 100 years! I hope that Master Ye won’t be stingy with teaching them!”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised. This Blackfuse was rather bold, to actually want him to train his subordinates!

This way, even though he did not take on the post of Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master, it was also pretty much the same.

“Okay, deal!” Ye Yuan nodded his head slowly and said.
