Chapter 2857 Exchange!

How much were 50 thousand contribution

points?

Calculating in this manner: for True Sovereign Heaven disciples, when they went out on a very dangerous mission once, the contribution points were between 300 and 500 points.

This kind of mission was basically nine chances to die and one chance to live. Being able to do it twice a year was already the limit.

If it was an ordinary mission, it would be pushing the limit for there to be 100 or 80 points.

And Saint Sovereign Heaven disciples, their difficulty in obtaining contribution points was clearly greater.

Even if Ye Yuan was heaven-defying and more formidable than Yang Qing, he would need at least several decades before he could finish repaying too. Therefore, Ye Yuan’s words simply sounded like a ridiculous joke to the others!

“Hahaha, leave it to you? You repay your own contribution points before talking! Mn? You came just in time. Senior Apprentice Brother Guo, Ye Yuan has already exited seclusion. He owes the sect more than 54 thousand contribution points. It’s time to pay it back.” Wang Lin said with a loud laugh.

At this time, a figure walked out, it was a Law Enforcement Hall’s disciple, Guo Fang.

He came precisely on orders to capture Ye Yuan to repay his debts!

Since you broke through to profound grade, fine then; come and refine pills.

Guo Fang and Wang Lin were on good terms to begin with. Furthermore, Guo Fang’s master had received Qin Shan’s kindness before. He would naturally stand on Wang Lin’s side.

The contribution points owed to the sect naturally have to be repaid. But, it was not to the extent of being captured to repay the debt as soon as one left seclusion. A large sect did not lack those few tens of thousands of contribution points either.

Guo Fang looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, please come!”

Many people there were all watching a show.

Even the Law Enforcement Hall had moved out. Could you still overturn the heavens with this?

Obediently refine pills to repay the points!

Who knew that Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I’m not going.”

The moment Wang Lin heard, he immediately grinned.

What I wanted was for you to not go!

Sure enough, Guo Fang said coolly, “Whether to go or not isn’t up to you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course it’s up to me!”

Guo Fang said, “In that case, Junior Apprentice Brother Ye is forcing this Guo to take action? Don’t think that with Martial Uncle Zuo protecting you, you can look down on the Law Enforcement Hall. If my Law Enforcement Hall wants to capture someone, Martial Uncle Zuo can’t stop it!”

Guo Fang was a half-step Emperor Realm powerhouse too!

His ranking was lower than Luo Hao, but he was ranked ninth too. Wouldn’t dealing with a Ye Yuan still be a piece of cake?

And the Law Enforcement Hall had a transcendent status in the Extreme Medicine Sect. Regardless of whether it was alchemy path powerhouses or martial path powerhouses, they all could not afford to provoke.

Seeing this, Wang Lin and Zheng Qian smiled even brighter.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said indifferently, “Isn’t it just 50 thousand plus contribution points? Isn’t it done if I repay it today? How big a matter is it, to make you all look self-righteous? It’s really scary!”

Wang Lin laughed loudly and said, “Isn’t it just 50 thousand plus contribution points? Hahaha … do you think that you’re an Emperor Realm powerhouse? Even if it’s an Emperor Realm powerhouse, it’s also impossible to conjure 50 thousand contribution points out within a day! Not scared of spraining your tongue from talking big too!”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to care about him and looked at Guo Fang and said, “I’m going to earn contribution points now. Do you want to follow or not?”

Guo Fang’s brows furrowed slightly, and he nodded his head and said, “If you want to delay the time, that’s up to you too. But it’s only limited to today!”

Ye Yuan had just exited seclusion today. If he could repay it today, he would naturally have nothing to say.

If he directly captured him, it would go against the rules instead.

Ye Yuan did not talk nonsense either, turning around and leaving.

The Merit Hall, the place where the Extreme Medicine Sect issued missions and to exchange for contribution points.

This method of contribution points was also the way in which the vast majority of sects maintain normal operations.

No matter how large the sect was, it was not a bottomless hole either.

Over time, resources would ultimately be consumed.

Hence, each disciple had the duty of maintaining the operation of the sect, including the sect master.

At this time, a large group of people flooded into the Merit Hall at once, immediately attracting countless gazes.

Ye Yuan came before the mission desk and directly opened his mouth, saying, “I’m Emperor Zuo Chen’s disciple, I want to see Martial Uncle Feiwen!”

Chen Feiwen, Merit Hall’s top person-in-charge, and also Zuo Chen’s senior apprentice brother.

Ye Yuan naturally did not know him. It was Yang Qing who told him.

That disciple was merely Saint Sovereign Heaven. Upon hearing that he was Zuo Chen’s disciple, he naturally did not dare to be neglectful. Very soon, Chen Feiwen came out and sized Ye Yuan up and down.

“You’re Ye Yuan? I heard that your talent is extremely monstrous. It’s a shame that you’re a divergent cultivator! What are you finding me for?” Chen Feiwen asked.

Ye Yuan said, “I’m here to exchange for contribution points.”

Chen Feiwen frowned and said, “I remember that you seem to have just exited seclusion, right? Haven’t even taken on missions yet? What are you using to redeem contribution

points?”

Chen Feiwen naturally did not know ordinary Saint Sovereign Heavens.

But Ye Yuan’s reputation was too great. It was impossible for Chen Feiwen not to hear about him too.

“Heh heh, Martial Uncle Feiwen, Ye Yuan owes the Scripture Library 54 thousand contribution points. He says that he can earn it in a day. We feel that he’s formidable, so we followed to take a look.” Wang Lin interjected at an appropriate time.

Chen Feiwen was stupefied and could not help laughing as he said, “Brat, bragging isn’t a good habit! Forget about you; even if it’s this seat, it’s impossible to earn 50 thousand contribution points in a day too!”

Wang Lin smiled and said, “Martial Uncle, Ye Yuan is a person who creates miracles. Maybe he really has the ability to earn 50 thousand contribution points in a day!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Chen Feiwen knew that he was not on good terms with Ye Yuan and also discerned the mockery in his words. He looked toward Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Oh? What are you using to earn 50 thousand contribution points?”

“Take them!”

Ye Yuan did not waste his breath either, flicking his sleeves grandly. A pile of jade slips instantly appeared on the ground, piling up as high as a small hill!

These jade slips were precisely acquired by him in the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

In the 50 years before he came to Heaven One Continent, he had been studying these things too.

Otherwise, it was impossible for him to reach profound grade so quickly. The grade of these jade slips was not high. It was also about the same as those jade slips on the fifth and sixth levels of the Scripture Library.

But the things recorded in these jade slips were absolutely extraordinary! When the Labyrinth Divine Palace was at the height of its power and splendor, how glorious was that?

Their alchemy path strength was only stronger and not weaker compared to the current Extreme Medicine Sect!

Ordinary things, they simply held it in contempt!

Those able to be housed in the Treasure Depository Pavilion were all treasures among treasures.

Originally, Ye Yuan planned on directly donating these to the Extreme Medicine Sect. But now, it seemed like redeeming for contribution points was pretty good too. The appearance of these jade slips made the room full of people jump in fright.

What was this playing at? When Wang Lin saw, he could not help laughing and said, “I was wondering what capability you have. It turns out that it’s just a bunch of lousy jade slips! In this Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, what place could have more records than our Extreme Medicine Sect?”

Zheng Qian also smiled and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Wang must be joking. He’s planning on using numbers to score a victory! Think about it, even if one jade slip is worth 50 contribution points, a thousand jade slips will be worth 50 thousand too!”

But could one jade slip be worth 50 contribution points?

Impossible!

The Extreme Medicine Sect’s scripture library could be said to be filled to the roof with books.

There were God knows how many jade slips of all levels.

These jade slips were at the very most adding flowers to embroidery. That was all. It was not worth any money.

Moreover, what good stuff could a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven have?

Could his jade slips be more impressive than the records that those Hegemon Realms spent hundreds of thousands of years to collect?

Chen Feiwen also smiled and said, “Martial Nephew Ye, if you want to use numbers of exchange for contribution points, I’m afraid that it won’t pass! You got to know that the records in the Scripture Library, those were all screened through. Records that are second-rate can’t enter the Scripture Library at all. Even if they enter, if it’s not very valuable, it’s at most giving you three to five contribution points too. Therefore, you’d best take these things back.”

Ye Yuan did not get angry either but smiled and said, “Martial Uncle’s words are a little too hasty. Why not pick one to take a look first? How about it?”

Chen Feiwen shook his head and said with a smile, “Fine. There’s no harm in taking a look.”

Wang Lin and the others had mocking looks on their faces too.

Just you hang on stubbornly! Hence, Chen Feiwen casually picked up a jade slip and sank his divine sense into it.

Very soon, his expression changed drastically!

“This … This is actually the long-lost Profound Heart Entering Dream Chapter!”

Shock was written all over Chen Feiwen’s face, and he looked toward Ye Yuan.

This Profound Heart Entering Dream Chapter was definitely able to reach the level of entering the Scripture Library’s sixth level.

Furthermore, it was an excellent piece!

Ye Yuan seemed to have long expected it and said with a smile, “Martial Uncle, take another look?”

Chen Feiwen’s hands trembled, his eyes when looking at Ye Yuan again became different.

You wouldn’t be telling me that so many jade slips are all on the same level as the Profound Heart Entering Dream Chapter, right?

While being half-dubious, he could not resist picking up another jade slip. His expression changed again!
