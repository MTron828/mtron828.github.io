After finishing these, Ye Yuan took out a heavenly pill and directly melted it in water, took out a small cup, and let the youth’s younger brother drink it.

The complexion of the youth’s younger brother, who was originally on his dying breath, became rosy very quickly.

Everyone stared at Ye Yuan without moving their gaze, their eyes going from doubt to surprise.

That Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciple’s reaction was the fastest. He naturally knew what Ye Yuan was going to do.

Originally, he had a disdainful look. But very soon, his expression became solemn.

An expert!

This acupuncture technique was much stronger than even many of the top disciples in the sect!

Also, that heavenly pill, it was definitely peak true grade!

‘Was this here to challenge the dojo?

“Divine doctor! That kid was practically about to meet King Yama just now. Now, he actually lived!”

“What formidable medical skills, truly the means to revive the dead!”

“This master is a virtuous doctor, saving the wounded, not like the Extreme Medicine Sect, standing by and watching people die, humph!”

Seeing Ye Yuan having such miraculous methods, waves of exclamations immediately came from all around.

Of course, they also showed contempt for the Extreme Medicine Sect while they were at it.

One refused to help people in mortal danger. The other had a doctor’s benevolence, the level was immediately established!

“Alright. Bring your younger brother to go and rest for a while, and he’ll be fine,”Ye Yuan said to the youth.

‘When the youth saw that his younger brother had come back to life, his two eyes went red with agitation. Kneeling down in front of Ye Yuan with a thud, he said, “Many thanks, Master, for your life-saving grace! Zhang Song’s life will be sold to Master!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Alright, go on. There are still many people who need treatment here, don’t delay.”

Finished saying, he said loudly, “People who are on the verge of dying, come in front of me to queue up in haste. You’re not allowed to hold a position without being qualified. Otherwise … kill without mercy!”

This yell immediately attracted an uproar.

Those Saint Sovereign Heavens who were seriously injured on the verge of death, immediately rushed forward together.

‘The wounded present were not less than ten thousand people. But those who were truly about to die were naturally in the minority.

Very soon, those people came in front of Ye Yuan and lined up in a snaking queue.

Ye Yuan’s acupuncture technique, coupled with true grade heavenly pills melted in water, virtually worked like a charm.

The surrounded cries of exclamations were continuous!

‘The Extreme Medicine Sect disciple who was in front was called Qian Nan, a half-step True Sovereign Heaven powerhouse.

At this time, Qian Nan’s expression became increasingly uglier.

This punk clearly came to the Extreme Medicine Sect to slap faces!

The people that we did not take in, you treated them to earn fame?

Furthermore, it was even in front of the mountain pass gates of a behemoth like the Extreme Medicine Sect. Were you freaking nuts?

He came in front of Ye Yuan, using his blade to point at Ye Yuan, he said in a cold voice, “Brat, here isn’t the place for you to show off. Hurry up and get lost; otherwise, you’ll get it!”

Ye Yuan ignored him and said coolly, “Big Yellow, dole out a small punishment, break his legs!”

Qian Nan was just about to sneer and mock Ye Yuan: did you ate a bear’s heart or leopard’s gall? To dare beat the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciple in front of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s mountain pass gates?

However, his eyes blurred. Big Yellow’s hoof already arrived.

The Extreme Medicine Sect’s half-step True Sovereign Heaven was naturally very strong.

But who was Big Yellow?

He already killed his way into history’s top 1000 in the Labyrinth Divine Palace. It was already rare for him to have a match in the same rank!

This hoof directly kicked Qian Nan’s entire person flying.

Then Big Yellow followed after swiftly.

Crack! Crack!

Qian Nan’s two legs snapped in response!

“ARGH!”

Qian Nan screamed miserably. Everyone was stunned, including those people who came to seek medical treatment.

Beating the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciple in front of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s gates, was this person a fool?

‘The Extreme Medicine Sect was a Hegemon level powerful sect!

Even in the era of the seven great Hegemon level sects, the Extreme Medicine Sect was a top major sect too.

‘The Extreme Medicine Sect’s Hegemon Realm powerhouses reached as many as four people!

Apart from Hegemon Cloudmount and Hegemon Pinespring, there were also two martial path powerhouses.

This kind of behemoth, even Hegemon Realms did not dare to easily provoke it.

Now, it actually had its front door blocked by a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven and got slapped in the face?

“You … You really dare to break my legs! Everyone attack together for me! Dice this punk into pieces!” Qian Nan roared angrily.

As an Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciple, how revered was his status?

Some fellow who popped out from god knows where actually broke his legs!

There were hundreds of Saint Sovereign Heavens maintaining order in front of the mountain pass gates.

Hearing the order at this time, they immediately swarmed forward.

“Sovereign Azuresky is here! Who dares to act wildly?!”

Yang Qing’s long spear swung horizontally, the power of a True Sovereign Heaven suddenly bloomed. The footsteps of those Saint Sovereign Heaven disciples abruptly stopped.

Everyone present was inexplicably shocked again.

It was not because Yang Qing was powerful, but they were shocked by his boldness!

You were also too freaking domineering, right?

A mere True Sovereign Heaven dared to posture at the Extreme Medicine Sect’s door?

The Extreme Medicine Sect’s True Sovereign Heavens numbered at least 8000; even if not, there should be over 5000!

Maintaining order, the Extreme Medicine Sect did not send powerhouses over. Because in their view, no one dared to make a move in front of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s gates at all.

Who knew that someone made a move!

Qian Nan endured the intense pain and said with a cold smile, “Huhu, Sovereign Azuresky, how awe-inspiring! Are the few of you really bullying my Extreme Medicine Sect for not having anybody?”

“It was not that the Extreme Medicine Sect doesn’t have anyone. It’s that you stood by and watched people die, ruining the Extreme Medicine Sect’s reputation. Breaking your legs is teaching you a lesson on your teacher’s behalf!” Ye Yuan treated a person and opened his mouth to say lightly.

Qian Nan said furiously, “Who the hell do you think you dare? To also be fit to lecture me? Go and invite Martial Uncle Wu Jiang they all over. I want to see what right a measly little middle Saint Sovereign Heaven has to be so impressive!”

Under Qian Nan’s word of comman4, there was immediately someone who returned to the mountain pass gates.

Ye Yuan and the rest did not stop him either.

With this, those wounded were not calm anymore.

While this master was impressive, he was a little too impressive.

You also didn’t take a look. Where was this place? To still want to teach people’s disciple a lesson.

Wasn’t this courting death?

“Master, you’d better leave quickly! Your great kindness, we’re endlessly grateful! But the Extreme Medicine Sect can’t be provoked!”

“Yeah, Master! You’re a virtuous doctor, we all remember firmly in our hearts. Hurry up and go, or it will be too late!”

“The Extreme Medicine Sect is a Hegemon level sect. There are countless True Sovereign Heavens in the sect! The few of you can’t gain any advantages!”

The surrounding wounded urged one after another, asking Ye Yuan and his companions to leave.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No worries. Even if their teachers came, I’m scared that the people they call over don’t have enough weight.”

Everyone toppled!

You were posturing too much!

If their sect randomly sent a few True Sovereign Heavens over, they would crush you guys to death.

There was naturally no one who would think that this measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven before their eyes was the Extreme Medicine Sect’s ancestor’s disciple.

Even if this identity could not be known to the outside world, the seniority of Zuo Chen’s disciple was also extremely high.

When Qian Nan heard it, he snickered and said, “Huhu, I really broadened my horizons today! In that case, I’ll see if you can still be so impressive after our teacher arrives!”

Very soon, more than ten True Sovereign Heavens flew over in a threatening manner.

A youth in blue long robes shouted coldly, “Who is it to dare act wildly before our Extreme Medicine Sect’s mountain pass gates?”

Blue robes were the attire of True Sovereign Heaven disciples.

The arrival was precisely Wu Jiang, middle True Sovereign Heaven powerhouse.

‘When Qian Nan saw that Wu Jiang came, he immediately became emboldened and said to Ye Yuan with a cold smile, “This master, my teacher is here. I want to see how you teach me a lesson! Martial Uncle Wu Jiang, it’s this punk who damaged our Extreme Medicine Sect’s reputation in front of the

mountain pass gates, and he even broke my legs, saying that it’s teaching me a lesson on my teacher’s behalf!”

‘Wu Jiang’s expression turned cold, the pressure of a True Sovereign Heaven directly pressed down on Ye Yuan’s body as he said in a solemn voice, “Where did this impudent thing come from? Are you courting death?”

Ye Yuan ignored him and still administered the needles as he said with his back facing him, “Is the management of the mountain pass gates your responsibility?”
