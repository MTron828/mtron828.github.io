Chapter 2678: Drawing Aggro

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Yuan, I was wrong! I was really wrong! Spare me! I’ll definitely slog like an animal for you in the future and repay your kindness for not killing me!” In the water curtain, came Ironcore’s pleading voice.

That voice was practically crying.

From that time he knelt and begged for mercy, one could tell that Ironcore’s desire to live was still very strong.

“Ye Yuan, as long as you let me off, my Min Family will follow your lead in the future!” Min Nanshan did not want to die too as he shouted.

“Right, right, right! Ye Yuan, my people are not the slightest bit weaker than the Min Family! As long as you spare my life, it’s all yours!” Ironcore hurriedly said.

Ye Yuan’s thoughts stirred and he said coolly, “Hand over your origin divinity brands and I can spare you guys from death!”

He needed a powerful force currently. Two grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven’s forces were definitely a big help.

Although these two people had poor character, as long as he grasped the origin divinity brand, he could take their lives with one thought.

The two of them would hesitate to take action out of fear of damages and naturally would not dare to rebel.

When Ironcore and Min Nanshan heard that, their expressions could not help changing.

Handing over the origin divinity brand was equivalent to handing over life and death to Ye Yuan’s hands.

Ye Yuan could kill them with just one thought, this was no different from being a slave.

But if they did not hand it over, they were very clear that they would become corpses in a short while.

“You guys only have three breaths of time to consider!” Seeing the two hesitate, Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ironcore’s expression changed wildly, and he said, “I’ll give! I’ll give!”

Min Nanshan also said, “I’ll give too!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly and said coolly, “Moron, stop!”

The black shark was excited from killing and said unhappily, “Your Father is a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, but you’re actually ordering me about. Do you take yourself to be the dragon son?”

But Little Dragon Girl said, “Big Brother is in possession of purebred dragon blood. Those big brothers of mine are far worse than him! Alright, Uncle Black Shark, stop!”

This lass obeyed Ye Yuan’s every word now.

The black shark was helpless and could only stop.

Ironcore’s expression flickered indeterminately, and he finally still gritted his teeth and forced a wisp of origin divinity brand out.

Ye Yuan kept the origin divinity brand and merged it into his own chaos origin divinity, and immediately felt a feeling of controlling Ironcore’s life and death.

He only needed a thought to determine Ironcore’s life and death now!

Handing over the origin divinity brand, the two people’s expressions were like their wives had died.

No matter what, they were big shots of a region too. Now, they were actually relegated to being another person’s slave.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “The two of you don’t need to have this expression either. Becoming my servant might be a case of good fortune to you guys. As long as you guys perform well, helping you all step into Saint Sovereign Heaven in the future is nothing difficult.”

“Hah!?What high-sounding sentiments! Do you think that Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses are all cabbages?” Ye Yuan’s voice had just faded when the black shark said mockingly.

But Ironcore and Min Nanshan two people trembled all over, their eyes revealing rays of brilliant light.

If someone else said this, they would naturally feel that it was bullshit.

But Ye Yuan was different!

He was the man who could refine true grade heavenly pills!

That’s right. His current realm was very low, but his future potential was immense!

Once he became a grade four heavenly alchemist, helping them step into that dreamlike realm might not be impossible!

“What the hell do you know! How can Master’s strength be what you can surmise? Master, rest assured. Ironcore will definitely perform well from now on and absolutely won’t let you down!” Ironcore shot the black shark a glare and said respectfully.

“Min Nanshan is willing to pledge loyalty to Master!”

The black shark had a dumbfounded look, not knowing why these two people suddenly changed so much.

Could it be that these two Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were really silly enough to think that Saint Sovereign Heaven was so easy to reach?

If that was the case, how could the Saint Sovereign Heavens on this Rainclear Continent be so scarce?

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Since that’s the case, the two of you go back then. How you should act, I believe that you guys are very clear.”

“Got it! Got it!” The two people hurriedly said.

At this time, Ye Yuan suddenly looked in Huang Haoyan two people’s direction and beckoned his hands at them.

The two were taken aback, only then, knowing that their whereabouts had long already been seen through by Ye Yuan.

“Master Ye, we …”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “No need to explain. I know your intentions. The two of you follow them back to Heavenly South City. If they have any ill-intent, use this to inform me.”

As he was talking, Ye Yuan handed a small conch to them.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s line-up, Huang Haoyan two people were long already dumbstruck with amazement.

Only when they saw the seafolk did they know that their worries were simply unnecessary.

A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum actually took two grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses in as servants. This sort of thing was too fantastical.

But Ye Yuan did it.

However, Ye Yuan was clearly still worried about them. So he sent two supervisors over.

With the two of them around, Ironcore and Min Nanshan naturally could not stir any waves.

As long as Huang Haoyan informed Ye Yuan through the small conch, Ye Yuan could disintegrate the two of their souls from thousands of miles away.

… …

In the deep sea, a huge palace was suspended in the center. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

All around them were unfathomable grand arrays surrounding.

Thistle South Dragon Palace!

When Ye Yuan entered the dragon palace, he discovered that something was not quite right.

The palace was full of songs and dance, with a bevy of young girls. It was very lively.

Ye Yuan did not feel that he had this charm, to make Black Flood Dragon King come up with such a grand array to entertain him.

“Jingfei, could it be that there’s some distinguished guest in the dragon palace?” Ye Yuan asked.

Jingfei smiled mysteriously and said,?“Hehe,?you come with me and you’ll know in a bit.”

Ye Yuan was speechless. Judging from this girl’s sly expression, he knew that she was probably holding in some bad idea.

Following Little Dragon Girl, Ye Yuan walked all the way to a great hall.

Upon entering the hall, a banquet was already being held inside.

As soon as Ye Yuan appeared, he immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

In the center of the great hall, on the throne, a powerhouse with a dragon head and human body was sitting upright.

His face was completely black.

Presumably, this was the legendary Black Flood Dragon King.

This Black Flood Dragon King gave Ye Yuan a vague and illusory feeling, similar to the black-robed old man back then.

It was just that Black Flood Dragon King’s illusory feeling was not as strong as the old man’s.

Clearly, he had not truly stepped into the realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven yet!

“Royal Father, Royal Mother, I’m back!” Little Dragon Girl left Ye Yuan and scurried into Black Flood Dragon King’s arms in a step.

Black Flood Dragon King snorted coldly and said, “You lass, you abducted all of my generals. Where did you run to and cause trouble again?”

Little Dragon Girl was indifferent and said smilingly,?“Hehe,?there were bad guys who wanted to kill Big Brother, so I went to help Big Brother!?Oh,?right! He’s the big brother that I told you about. He’s amazing! Probably none of these big brothers present are more impressive than him!”

Ye Yuan felt a chill run down his spine, countless gazes shooting towards him.

In this great hall, there were many young men. One look and it was clear that they had noble statuses. They were most likely sea race powerhouses.

This girl’s one sentence drew huge aggro to him!

Ye Yuan looked at Little Dragon Girl, only to see her wink at him. It was as if she was saying, “That’s right.. I did it on purpose!”
