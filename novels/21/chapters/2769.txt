Chapter 2775: Competing in Numbers?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Boom!

The place that Li Changsheng was standing exploded with a loud bang.

The two people were blown away once more.

The light on Li Changsheng’s small golden sword dimmed once again.

The corners of his mouth twitched heavily, feeling his flesh hurt.

A grade two grandmist treasure was not some cabbage!

After a few Dao tribulations, fine cracks had already appeared on his little golden sword.

He had the intention of shaking off Ye Yuan, but Ye Yuan did not give him the chance to do so at all.

He had to drag him into the water at the risk of heavy injuries too.

While the other Saint Sovereign Heavens secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

Li Changsheng’s appearance saved their lives.

Otherwise, now, they would have long died.

Nine laws Dao tribulation was too terrifying. Only Li Changsheng could barely manage to withstand it.

Bolts of tribulations fell. Li Changsheng was bombarded until he bled from all seven orifices, his appearance utterly tragic.

Of course, Ye Yuan was even more miserable than him.

Even with the protection of the Myriad Realms Mountain, Ye Yuan was still bombarded until flesh and blood scattered everywhere, his breathing barely perceptible.

However, no matter how miserable he was, he had to drag Li Changsheng along too.

Except, what made Li Changsheng depressed was that his little golden sword already could not almost hold on anymore. But the Myriad Realms Mountain’s light seemed to be growing stronger and stronger!

The Myriad Realms Mountain actually became more and more refined under the bombardment of the Dao tribulation!

This was too … freaking aggravating!

Similarly a grade two grandmist treasure, but why would it be like this?

Boom!

Crack!

The Dao tribulation fell, the small golden sword directly fragmented!

Li Changsheng felt as if he heard the sound of his heart shattering.

“This … Alliance Head’s Lichang Sword actually shattered!”

“Why is Ye Yuan’s small mountain completely fine? Not only is it fine, but its power also seems to have improved even more!”

“Similarly a grade two grandmist treasure, but why is the difference so big?”

… …

The Saint Sovereign Heavens had baffled faces.

And right at this time, the true dragon illusion above the void gave a long howl, burrowing into Ye Yuan’s body.

The terrifying tribulation clouds dissipated without a trace!

The nine laws Dao tribulation finally ended!

“He … He really succeeded in transcending the tribulation!” Guo Huai looked at Ye Yuan and muttered to himself.

This was a nine laws Dao tribulation!

Not only did this guy not die, he even turned the Pill Alliance upside down.

Unwillingness!

Guo Huai carried a strong unwillingness and died …

“Tsk tsk,?the quality of your grade two grandmist treasure is lacking! Why did it shatter after being smitten a few times by Dao tribulation?” Ye Yuan swallowed his last healing heavenly imperial pill and shook his head as he said with a sigh.

These words were very sarcastic. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The current Li Changsheng had green veins throbbing, glaring with wide eyes.

If looks could kill, Ye Yuan would have long died a thousand times, ten thousand times over.

“I’m going to kill you, Ye Yuan!”

Li Changsheng stepped into the air. An additional long sword appeared in his hand.

However, this long sword was just a grade one grandmist treasure.

Li Changsheng released his aura fully, a sword that tore across the air chopped over.

It was as if the void was being cleaved apart by him!

An aura of death hit him head-on.

“Eight Gates Life Extermination Sword!”

But the current Ye Yuan did not evade, saying with a cold smile, “Having broken through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, do you think that … I’d still run? Myriad Realms Mountain, break for me!”

With a thought, Ye Yuan’s divine essence injected into the Myriad Realms Mountain crazily.

The Myriad Realms Mountain erupted with rays of brilliant light at once and met with Li Changsheng’s sword with a whoosh.

Boom!

The sword light directly collapsed and dissipated under the Myriad Realms Mountain’s brutal collision!

Li Changsheng spurted out a large mouthful of blood with a cough and was actually directly smashed flying out!

Ye Yuan suffered some backlash but was fine.

Everyone was dumbfounded with shock.

The Ye Yuan who broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven was actually powerful to such an extent?

The lower Saint Sovereign Heaven Ye Yuan directly smashed the grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven Li Changsheng flying!

“Hah,

?Li Changsheng, you destroyed my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! Today, it’s time for a blood feud to be paid in blood!” Ye Yuan looked at Li Changsheng and said with a sneer.

The nine laws Dao tribulation earlier shattered Li Changsheng’s grade two grandmist treasure, causing him rather severe injuries.

Meanwhile, Ye Yuan broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven. Under the nourishment of Heavenly Dao and the effect of true grade heavenly pills, his injuries recovered rapidly.

Furthermore, after the nine laws Dao tribulation’s tempering, the Myriad Realms Mountain became even more refined, and its power was even greater!

When one was weakened, the other would be stronger. Ye Yuan’s strength suppressed the grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven Li Changsheng instead.

Li Changsheng’s expression was livid. Firing out several talismans from his hands, he shouted coldly, “Eight Legions War Generals, show yourselves!”

Boom!

Several talismans exploded with a loud bang, forming a spatial passageway.

Eight figures walked out of the spatial passageway.

These eight people were all embedded in a golden-yellow armor, imposing and domineering.

Furthermore, these eight people were actually all the same, middle Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Some already reached peak middle Saint Sovereign Heaven!

When Zhao Ding saw this scene, he could not resist letting out a loud laugh as he said, “Ye Yuan, you dare to challenge my Pill Alliance! Even if you broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, so what? Could it be that you alone are a match for the dozen over of us? Today, you’ll surely die!”

Zhao Ding was smitten twice by Dao tribulation and was incredibly wretched.

Fortunately, he had some heavenly pills on him. At this time, his injuries recovered considerably.

Just now, under the Dao tribulation, six of them died. There were only eight people left now.

Adding in these Eight Legions War Generals and Li Changsheng, it was 17 people.

With 17 great Saint Sovereign Heavens dealing with Ye Yuan alone, even if Ye Yuan had exceedingly formidable abilities, he could forget about escaping too!

Li Changsheng stared fixedly at Ye Yuan and gnashed his teeth in hatred as he said, “Lichang Sword has followed this chief for tens of thousands of years, becoming one of mind with me! But you actually destroyed it! Today, this chief is going to tear you to shreds so pay homage to my Lichang Sword!”

This Lichang Sword was obtained by Li Changsheng in his sect. It had accompanied him for more than ten thousand years.

Originally, by relying on his cultivation and the Lichang Sword, he was absolutely an invincible existence on this Rainclear Continent.

But now … the Lichang Sword was actually shattered by the Dao tribulation!

The fury in Li Changsheng’s heart could be imagined.

These 17 great Saint Sovereign Heavens blocked off all of Ye Yuan’s escape routes.

Ye Yuan appeared somewhat alone and helpless under their encirclement.

However, he did not mind. He just looked at Li Changsheng and said with a faint smile, “Li Changsheng, do you really think that you’ve won?”

“What a joke! The 17 of us dealing with you alone, if this can’t even take care of you, then this chief will knock himself out and die here today!” Li Changsheng said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan’s expression turned cold, and he said in a solemn voice, “Li Changsheng, Zhao Ding, this is Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s mountain pass gates. You all destroyed my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect at this place, massacring countless! Today, this Ye will kill you all here and pay homage to all of Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s members’ spirits in heaven that died unjustly!”

Li Changsheng laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Boy, did your head get spoiled from being smitten by Dao tribulation just now? With just you alone, you also want to destroy my Pill Alliance?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Who told you that I’m alone?”

“Roar!”

Ye Yuan raised his head and gave a long roar. The sound of a dragon roar surged to the sky, spreading extremely far and wide.

In an instant, one powerful figure after another cut across the sky and arrived.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon, Saint Exalt Great Roc, Saint Exalt Giant Ape, Saint Exalt Big Yellow …

Myriad Demons Mountain’s 38 true spirit Saint Exalts had all arrived!

On the other side, Saint Exalt Waycloud, Saint Exalt Skyfortune, and the other Five Great Heavenly Regions’ saint exalt powerhouses also appeared one after another!

A total of 15 Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses came over at this side!

There was also a group who was Luo Yunqing three people, as well as the Land of Heavenly South’s four great Saint Exalts.

The Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses present reached a terrifying 60 people all at once!
