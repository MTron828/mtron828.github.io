Chapter 2586: You Are Not Qualified to be on Equal Footing With Me!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“His affinity actually increased?”

“Affinity is innate. How can it possibly increase?”

“This Luo Yunqing started talking nonsense in order to save his life!”

… …

The moment these words came out, it naturally caused a shock.

Sect Master’s eyes also narrowed slightly, revealing surprise.

At this time, Qin Shun suddenly said, “Luo Yunqing, your words are insulting us heavenly alchemists! If even a one-point affinity can refine heavenly pills, then wouldn’t we, these people, become jokes?”

Affinity was the biggest threshold for heavenly alchemists.

Many ascenders were alchemists in the Lower Realms before but had no choice but to give up after ascending.

Luo Yunqing smiled and said, “Actions speak louder than words. It’s time to see what someone is worth. If Master Qin feels that Yunqing is joking, why don’t you guys compete in a match!”

When Qin Shun heard that, he said in a great rage, “Luo Yunqing! You’re becoming more and more condescending! This old man is a dignified grade three heavenly alchemist. How noble is my status? You’re asking me to compete in alchemy with a four-point affinity trash?”

Although Luo Yunqing was already a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, Qin Shun did not feel inferior in front of him.

The status of a grade three heavenly alchemist in the sect was too high!

He could sit on equal footing with the elders!

Luo Yunqing laughed in spite of himself and said, “Since Master Qin refuses to compete, what are you going to do about it?”

Qin Shun thought about it and said, “Jingxuan, you come!”

Behind Qin Shun, a girl in a yellow shirt walked out.

This girl had Danfeng eyes, her lips like cherries, giving people a feeling of otherworldliness, truly as beautiful as a celestial fairy.

Many ascenders stared until they could not pull their eyes away!

Qin Shun looked at Ye Yuan and said smugly, “My disciple Jingxuan has learned alchemy from me for ten years! If you can win against her, I’ll consider it that you pass this hurdle. How about it?”

Wen Jingxuan frowned and said, “Master, how can him having four-point affinity be able to refine pills? Even if I win, it’s also winning unscrupulously.”

“In these ten years, you’ve followed me to learn alchemy and rarely showed your face in the sect. Today, just nice to borrow this opportunity and let them take a look at your achievements of ten years in front of Sect Master!”

Qin Shun did not hide his selfish motives at all, directly saying it straightforwardly.

Heavenly alchemists wanted face the most. Not only did they have to be impressive, but they also had to make their own disciples seem impressive.

He made Wen Jingxuan come out to prove that he taught better than Wu Chengchao!

“This … Alright!” Wen Jingxuan hesitated for a bit but still agreed.

Wu Chengchao’s expression was very ugly by the side.

When Shi Feiyu saw the situation, he immediately said, “Sect Master, if he loses to Jingyuan that lass, this old man will definitely seek justice for Zhanyuan’s death!”

Luo Yunqing knew Ye Yuan’s strength, so he was not worried at all. Instead, he smiled and said, “Then if Ye Yuan wins, what about it?”

Shi Feiyu sneered and said, “If he wins, this matter will be dropped at this!”

Luo Yunqing laughed and said, “Okay, it’s a deal!”

Sect Master also nodded and said, “In that case …”

“Wait a minute!”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Shi Feiyu smiled coldly and said, “Why? Know how to be scared now? It’s too late!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance like looking at a fool, turned to Qin Shun, and said, “You’re a protector, I’m a protector too! You sent a disciple out to compete with me, isn’t this insulting me?”

Qin Shun laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “You, a mere Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, also wants to be on equal footing with me? What qualifications do you have?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t want to be on equal footing with you! You are not qualified to be on equal footing with me!”

Just as everyone thought that Ye Yuan was terrified, he changed his tone and shocked people when his words came out!

“This … This guy is really impressive!”

“I just want to know why a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum can be impressive until like this!”

“The ignorant is fearless!”

… …

A series of cold air being sucked in came from all over the entire Tianhui Peak.

Ye Yuan’s words were too domineering!

Luo Yunqing was taken aback when he heard that and immediately laughed and said,?“Hahaha?… Brother Ye, I’m really feeling more and more optimistic about you!”

Qin Shun’s smile suddenly froze, and he shouted, “What did you say?”

Ye Yuan ignored him and said coolly, “Lin Lan!”

Lin Lan stepped forward when he heard and said respectfully, “Disciple is here!”

Ye Yuan said, “This disciple of mine has followed me to learn alchemy for more than three years! If you can beat him, come and challenge me again!”

As for that Wen Jingxuan who was as beautiful as a celestial fairy, she was directly hung out to dry at one side.

Ye Yuan was talking about Qin Shun!

Face slapping!

Blatant face slapping!

You used a disciple to challenge me, I’ll use a disciple to challenge you!

Everyone was dumbstruck with amazement!

Ye Yuan’s posturing points simply rose up vertically.

That was a grade three heavenly alchemist!

A guy whose affinity was only four points actually talked wildly!

“Huhu,?good! Very good! Sect Master, this boy is insulting me, what should be done about it?” Qin Shun’s expression was grim until it was about to drip water.

By the side, when Wu Chengchao saw Qin Chao getting deflated, he secretly rejoiced.

Before waiting for Sect Master to speak, he said, “Sect Master, I feel that Ye Yuan’s words are reasonable! No matter what his cultivation realm is, since Luo Yunqing gave him the green-wing token, he’s our sect’s green-wing protector, his status similar to ours! This is our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s rule, it can’t be broken! It isn’t appropriate for Qin Shun to challenge Protector Ye with a disciple!”

“Wu Chengchao, you!” Qin Chao was angered until his beard billowed and he glared.

Wen Jingxuan’s brows also furrowed slightly, and she looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “You’re using a made-up directive to order people around! A mere four-point affinity, what are you pretending here for? If you have the capabilities, fight with me!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “You’re not qualified enough!”

Sect Master also felt a headache, he discovered that this Ye Yuan was really too capable of causing trouble.

A tiny little sect assessment had a hole poked through the sky by him!

Sect Master said in a solemn voice, “Protector Ye, whether or not you’re qualified to take on the position of protector is still to be discussed! If you insist on doing so, then this sect master can only strip you of your position of protector!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said coolly, “Alright, then I’ll give Sect Master face! You compete in alchemy with Lin Lan, if you win, you’ll have the qualifications to challenge me. If you lose, let that old fellow come. I’ll compete with him! Sect Master, this is my bottom line! If you don’t agree, you can do as you please! A scholar prefers death to humiliation!”

These words were said to Wen Jingxuan.

Sect Master thought about it and said with a nod, “Okay, do as you say!”

Since Luo Yunqing gave the token, Ye Yuan was a protector in reality.

The rules could not be broken!

He had to give this face.

Not giving to Ye Yuan, it was giving it to Luo Yunqing!

Luo Yunqing entered Jade Sovereign Heaven at a young age, he was the best successor candidate for the next sect master.

If Ye Yuan really had this ability.

Then his face had to be given!

He understood Luo Yunqing. There were not many people that could make Luo Yunqing hold in esteem! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wen Jingxuan had an indifferent personality in the first place. But at this time, she was triggered badly by Ye Yuan too.

She came before Ye Yuan and said in a chilly voice, “Protector Ye, I’ll definitely make you reveal your fox’s tail!”

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “I already said, you’re not qualified! Not just you, but that master of yours isn’t qualified either!”
