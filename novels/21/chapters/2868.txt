Chapter 2874 Waited So Long for You Guys!

After Chou Yang entered the number one passageway, the pupils of Bloodtrue and the rest all constricted.

Another formidable opponent came!

“Chou Yang, you actually came in too!” He Ming came up and said with a smile that was not a smile.

“Why? You’re allowed to come in, and I’m not allowed to enter?” Chou Yang said with a cold smile.

“Haha, of course you’re allowed, but with your cautious personality, we all thought that you wouldn’t come in.” He Ming said with a laugh.

“Humph! I’m definitely taking this spot!” Chou Yang said proudly.

He had the confidence of a powerhouse

However, his gaze landed on Ye Yuan, brimming with killing intent.

The passageway had not opened yet. They were not allowed to make a move now. Otherwise, he would have immediately killed Ye Yuan.

Seeing Chou Yang’s gaze, it immediately drew the attention of those powerhouses who could not help looking toward Ye Yuan in surprise. Could it be that Chou Yang came in because of this upper Saint Sovereign Heaven?

Not to such an extent, right?

With regard to these gazes, Ye Yuan was completely oblivious and closed his eyes to rest.

“He has enmity with you?” He Ming asked in confusion.

Chou Yang said, “If you heard what he said, you guys would also have enmity with him!”

This sentence successfully attracted the attention of the group of powerhouses.

He Ming said in surprise, “Oh? What did he say?”

Chou Yang recounted the matter at the registration area in detail from the very beginning, successfully increasing Ye Yuan’s aggro value to 300%.

Which of these people were not proud sons of heaven?

Which of them was not incomparably proud? They would say that this slot belonged to me!

But there was absolutely no one who would say these words: I alone will bag ten spots!

These words were too arrogant and would incur public outrage!

These heaven’s chosen were strong, but they would not be strong until the extent of incurring public outrage too. Forget about a Saint Sovereign Heaven; even if a True Sovereign Heaven was here, he would not dare to say so too!

Especially the number one passageway, the strength of these proud sons of heaven did not pale to True Sovereign Heavens!

So many people attacking together, who could fend them off?

“What high-sounding sentiments! Heh heh, the passageway is about to open right away. I really want to see just how impressive this little brother is! Oh, right! Bloodtrue, you likely can’t get this spot!” He Ming said with a smile.

Bloodtrue’s strength was indeed slightly stronger than the others.

Therefore, the likelihood of him getting the spot was the highest.

Of course, it was also just a possibility.

So many experts, there were too many variables. No one dared to say that they would definitely win.

If it was one-on-one, that would be easy to say.

Bloodtrue did not even look at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Just a moron. You guys are stooping to his level too.”

“Hahaha, that makes sense! Idiot, aren’t you going to provoke us?” He Ming said to Ye Yuan with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan ignored him and closed his eyes to rest.

He was not so free. With this bit of time, using it to cultivate, using it to gain enlightenment on Alchemy Dao, Formation Dao, what was not good about it?

However, him ignoring these people was immediately thought of as being cowardly by everyone.

“Huhu, that kid is probably frightened silly, right? Doesn’t even dare to talk anymore!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Please! With close to 20 big shots, if it were you, would you dare to speak? If it was posturing outside, forget it. Entering the number one passageway, he can only submit!” “Makes sense. Being remembered by so many big shots, he’ll really die! In a while, reckon that he’ll be going crazy, hahaha!”

..

…

This was a very large space. Over 80 thousand people were being shut in a crammed radius, being shrouded by a light screen. Before the passageway opened, they could not make a move. Otherwise, they would be directly killed. At this time, the two Emperor Sakra Heaven big shots of Giant Net City, Su Mu and Bloodsword, were also both paying attention to the number one passageway.

This place was often where the strongest one was born.

“Bloodtrue’s first place is most likely in the bag. This kid is quite similar to you!” Su Mi said with a smile.

Bloodtrue was Bloodsword’s descendant. He firmly suppressed the others in Saint Sovereign Heaven.

He was also Bloodsword’s pride.

Regarding this descendant, he also nurtured him with all his heart.

Hearing that, Bloodsword said smugly, “I estimate that Bloodtrue’s strength can pretty much enter the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons’ top 20! This battle is merely child’s play.”

Su Mu’s pupils constricted, and he said, “That boy hid his strength? You, this fellow, really hid so deeply!”

Bloodsword smiled and said, “If he doesn’t hide a bit of strength, how will he win when he reaches the Battle of Hundred Sons? Heh, those capable of going to Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City are all true heaven’s chosen!”

Su Mu nodded and said, “If he’s really able to enter the top 20, then this seat’s face will naturally feel a glow too!”

Bloodsword smiled and said, “Stop pretending in front of me! Su Yun’s strength can also take first place firmly among True Sovereign Heavens! The value of the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons is still not as good as a True Sovereign Heaven in the end!”

This Su Yun was naturally Su Mu’s descendant.

They had the backgrounds of Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses. Their strength was naturally extraordinary.

Su Mu smiled and said, “The competition between True Sovereign Heavens is even fiercer. Whether or not Su Yun can take first place is really hard to say. Alright, it’s about time to open up the passageways!”

……

Boom!

The light screen above everyone’s heads dissipated with a loud bang.

At the same time, the passageways also directly opened.

Everyone was very far away from the passageway.

This distance was used to kill.

However, even if one reached the passageway entrance, it could not be directly entered too.

The passageway entrance was sealed. There was a mechanism on it. One should activate the mechanism three times in a row before the passageway could open.

After someone entered the passageway, the passageway would shut again, and it would need to be opened once more.

And this increased the intensity of the killing.

Virtually right away, Chou Yang rushed toward Ye Yuan.

He wanted to kill him at the first moment!

Not just Chou Yang, quite a few Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses rushed over to this side.

However, Ye Yuan already disappeared since God knows when.

“Where is he? He was clearly still here just now!”

“F*ck, at least you ran fast! Don’t let Your Father run into you. Otherwise, I’ll make you die horribly!”

“Little bastard ran pretty fast!” Chou Yang gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

With over 80 thousand people, if one hid in the crowd, it was really not so easy to find.

At this time, over 80 thousand people had already collided together, flesh and blood scattering, being incomparably tragic. These top powerhouses formed their own circle. More than 20 powerhouses were frenziedly fighting a melee together.

However, they did not use their full strength. It was just fighting who would be the first to enter the passageway.

There was no need to go all out in this first round.

The real killing was in the next level!

At that time, that would be the real irreconcilable till death.

After the first level was done fighting, it would give people an opportunity to exploit instead.

Bloodtrue’s skill was a level higher in the end. He still rushed out of the encirclement of several formidable foes to be the first.

However, he could not shake everyone off.

After all, there were no easy people here.

“First place is Your Father’s! Bloodtrue, you’re not allowed to snatch it!” Chou Yang drew his blade and hacked at Bloodtrue frenziedly.

His strength was really very strong. Even Bloodtrue did not dare to underestimate too.

However, before entering the passageway, the killing had not reached the peak yet.

The passageway entrance was the meat grinding field!

Very soon, those over top 20 powerhouses rushed to the passageway entrance. Following that, they were stunned!

A figure was unexpectedly at the passageway entrance. He did not enter the passageway either and just stood there like that.

Who could this person be if not Ye Yuan?

It turned out that he had long already reached the passageway entrance!

Seeing everyone come up, Ye Yuan said with a grin, “Just came huh? I waited so long for you

guys!”
