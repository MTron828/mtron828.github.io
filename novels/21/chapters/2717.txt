Chapter 2723: Lousy Sacred Destiny Pill!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Follow you?

He had five great saint exalts following behind him!

Where did you get the courage to dare call such an existence to follow you?

One had to know, there were only three great saint exalts on the entire Myriad Demons Mountain before this!

Truly, the ignorant were fearless!

Ye Yuan did not get angry, but he looked at Meng Frostwind and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Have me follow you? I wonder what benefits can you give me?”

Meng Frostwind flicked his sleeves grandly and said coolly, “I heard that your strength in refining heavenly pills. Even Zhao Xun admires you greatly. Since that’s the case, you can be this Heavenly South Pill Hall’s hall master then!”

Meng Frostwind even thought that Ye Yuan would be moved, having given him an irresistible condition.

Zhao Xun letting loose a torrent of abuse towards him earlier, already made him give rise to feelings of detest.

If it were before, he would have tolerated it.

But now, he was revered as a Saint Exalt. Why would he care about a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven?

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard that and said, “Just a Heavenly South Pill Hall’s hall master? Not enough!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Meng Frostwind sneered and said,?“Hah,?what high-sounding sentiments! Then you tell me, what do you want?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I want you to kneel down and admit your fault in front of this entire city’s martial artists!”

Meng Frostwind’s expression turned cold, and he said in a cold voice, “Boy, you dare to play with this exalt? Do you know that this exalt is presently this Land of Heavenly South’s only Saint Sovereign Heaven! Everyone’s life and death are all at one thought of this exalt!”

Ye Yuan did not care at all and said with a faint smile, “Playing? I don’t have this spare time to play with you, this shameless thing.”

Meng Frostwind was enraged when he heard that and said, “Boy, you’re really terrific, to actually dare provoke a Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “Is Saint Sovereign Heaven very impressive?”

“Then you take a look if Saint Sovereign is really very impressive or not!”

Meng Frostwind shouted coldly, the aura of Saint Sovereign Heaven suddenly releasing. The entire Heavenly South City felt the terrifying pressure.

Saint Sovereign Heaven was too terrifying!

In the midst of this violent storm, even Zhao Xun this half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven seemed unbelievably weak too.

“Hahaha,?Saint Sovereign Heaven, how impressive! This exalt is really scared!” Amidst a loud laughter, Saint Exalt Bright Tiger appeared.

Meng Frostwind’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “You … You broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven too? This … This isn’t possible!”

“Tsk tsk,?Saint Sovereign Heaven, really amazing! Then it looks like this exalt is very amazing too!” With a playful smile, Saint Exalt Myriad Elephant showed himself too.

And the direction in which he appeared was at an angle with Saint Exalt Bright Tiger, blocking half of Meng Frostwind’s retreat routes.

Seeing Saint Exalt Myriad Elephant, Meng Frostwind’s heart twitched heavily!

“You … You broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven too?”

“Meng Frostwind, you seem very surprised! Isn’t it just breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven? Look how it got you all excited,” Saint Exalt Heavenly Rat appeared and said.

Meng Frostwind felt that his breathing became somewhat unsmooth.

Saint Sovereign Heaven!

He only snatched away the lucky chance from these few people after going through all kinds of hardships and difficulties, corroborating his Dao and becoming a Saint Sovereign Heaven.

But who knew that 50 years of closed-seclusion, after exiting seclusion, everything changed!

He thought that he could trample on these five great true spirits after leaving seclusion.

But who would have expected that three out of the five broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!

“Tsk tsk,?a half-baked Saint Sovereign Heaven like you actually wants to make Master Ye follow you too, your head was kicked by a donkey, right??Uh?… sorry about that, I insulted the donkey,” Saint Exalt Wild Lion said disdainfully.

Following Saint Exalt Wild Lion and Saint Exalt Giant Deer showing themselves, Meng Frostwind’s eyeballs popped out.

“You … You all … You all actually broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven?” Meng Frostwind felt that this world was too terrifying.

Five great true spirits all broke through, then what did the lucky chance that he racked his brains to get count for?

Meng Frostwind had a feeling of incredibly bad luck now.

Saint Exalt Bright Tiger looked at Meng Frostwind and said with a smile that was not a smile, “You seem very surprised? When you snatched away the Sacred Destiny Pill back then, you didn’t expect that there would be today, right? Didn’t you say just now that you wanted to find the five of us to take revenge? Now, we’ll give you this chance.”

The five of them had already formed an encirclement.

Even if the movement technique of a Saint Sovereign Heaven was extremely fast, it was also impossible to escape.

Meng Frostwind was filled with fear, only then, realizing that he was in danger.

Just now, he was really too surprised!

When did Saint Sovereign Heavens become cabbages?

“How on earth … did you all achieve it?” Meng Frostwind could not figure out after racking his brains and said.

Bright Tiger laughed loudly and pointed at Ye Yuan and said, “You idiot, you only cared about plotting against us, but didn’t know that the real god was right under your eyelids! Master Ye’s Alchemy Dao has the ability to access heaven and penetrate the earth! The five of us broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven all thanks to him. What does a mere Sacred Destiny Pill count for?”

“It’s you? Impossible!” Meng Frostwind’s entire body trembled, and he looked toward Ye Yuan in disbelief.

These five great Saint Sovereign Heavens were actually created by a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven?

This … How was this possible?

If a grade four heavenly alchemist could create Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, then Saint Sovereign Heavens would be all over the place!

Bright Tiger smiled and said, “Whether to believe it or not, it’s up to you. But right now, we’ll beat you down first before talking! Brothers, do it!”

“Right on!” Wild Lion few people rubbed their fists and wiped their palms, each and every one glaring like ravening tigers.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The five people did not hesitate in the slightest, making a move at virtually the same time.

Such power, when had the powerhouses in the city seen it before?

That terrifying undulation was akin to gorgeous fireworks in the sky, being beautiful to the extreme.

Meng Frostwind’s expression changed drastically and could only respond passively.

His retreat routes were all blocked off, he could only teeter on his feet.

But the infuriating thing was that he discovered that he did not have the strength to fight back at all in front of these five people.

“Hang on, why is this guy so weak? Could it be that he’s hiding his strength?” Wild Lion frowned and said.

Exchanging blows earlier, he discovered that Meng Frostwind’s strength was far worse than his!

One had to know, when they were at half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, Meng Frostwind’s strength was comparable to that of Bright Tiger King.

Otherwise, how could the five of them find him to go together?

But having likewise broken through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, he discovered that his opponent’s strength was unbelievably weak.

At most, he only had 70% of his strength.

Strange!

“Hide my ass! How can a mere Sacred Destiny Pill be mentioned in the same breath with Master Ye’s Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill? When we broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, we practically excavated all the potential in our bodies. That lousy Sacred Destiny Pill was only third or fourth grade. So how can it consolidate the cultivation realm and consolidate the foundation?” Bright Tiger scolded with a smile.

Saint Exalt Wild Lion came to a sudden realization and said,?“Ah!?So that’s how it is! This guy really lost a watermelon to pick up a sesame seed! I reckon that I can take him down by myself! Fool! An idiot!?Hahaha?…”

Even breakthroughs were different too.

Otherwise, how could the quality of medicinal pills demonstrate a difference?

A true grade heavenly pill, the medicinal effect was often beyond comprehension. It was not what a Sacred Destiny Pill could compare to at all.

Five great saint exalts taking action at the same time, Meng Frostwind was beaten until he vomited blood repeatedly.

He only had the power of parrying; so how could he have the strength to fight back?

If not for the five great saint exalts showing mercy, he would have long already kicked the bucket.

He did everything possible to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, but he was crippled without even getting to perform a posturing.

“Alright, that’s about enough. Leave him with his wretched life.. I want him to kneel down and apologize to all the martial artists in the city!” Ye Yuan said loudly.
