Chapter 1312: The Wealth Left Behind by Ye Yuan

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What did you say? He ... He really refined a divine-grade Detoxification Pill?”

Hearing Manager Su’s report, Yang Rui’s shock was by no means insignificant. This could be seen from his voice that had a slight change in pitch.

Manager Su clearly still had not recovered from the shock. The expression on his face was rather unnatural.

“Absolutely true! When he gave Miss Wanru the Detoxification Pill, Feng Ping and I were both present. We are absolutely not wrong! Furthermore, the toxin in Miss Wanru’s body is already gradually being detoxified!”

Yang Yu also did not come back to his senses from this news after a long time.

This news was seriously too explosive!

When he decided to protect Ye Yuan, he absolutely did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually bring him such an astounding surprise.

He just felt that Ye Yuan was a fine sapling and was worthy of nurturing.

However, Ye Yuan’s improvement was seriously beyond his expectations.

“One more thing! Ye Yuan had us go and clean up his practice room, but after we sent people to go and clean up, we discovered that the whole place was filled with Divine Essence Pills and Detoxification Pills. Among them, the number of heaven-grades was the most. Each type had no less than several hundred pieces!” Manager Su’s words were bent on shocking people to death as he continued.

Yang Rui’s eyes stared like wide-saucers as he looked at Manager Su and asked, “What did you say? Heaven-grade is the most? Then that’s also to say that before this, he did not know how to refine the Detoxification Pill at all? He used one month plus time to go from a rookie to become a master?”

Manager Su slowly nodded and said, “It should be so!”

“Hiss ...”

Yang Yui drew a cold breath. The imposing manner of giving directions over the dynasty and having everything in control completely dissipated without a trace at this time.

The current him was just like a startled little rabbit. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The expression on his face was fascinating to the extreme.

After a long time, Yang Rui was suddenly startled and said to Manager Su, “Where’s Ye Yuan? Bring him to come to see me! No, I’ll go see him!”

Yang Rui was just about to move, but was stopped by Manager Su who said, “Tower Lord, you don’t need to go anymore, Ye Yuan already went into closed-seclusion!”

Yang Rui froze and said, “Closed-seclusion? Didn’t he already refine the divine-grade Detoxification Pill? Still enter what seclusion?”

Manager Su shook his head and said, “He handed Miss Wanru to Hong Yin, then went to the warehouse and withdrew a large bunch of spirit medicines, and directly entered closed-seclusion.”

Yang Rui frowned and said, “What kind of spirit medicines did he take out?”

Manager Su said, “The spirit medicines taken out this time are even more than the last time. Just the variety is as many as several dozen kinds. As for the specifics of what he’s going to go, it’s really hard to judge.”

Yang Rui fell silent. Suddenly, his gaze looked towards Manager Su scorchingly and said, “I say, could he be ... refining the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill?”

Manager Su’s pupils constricted, his gaze revealing a look of horror as he blurted out, “No way, right? One-star Heavenly Mark Pill, even among Two-star Alchemy Gods, there aren’t many capable of refining it too! But ... with you saying so, there’s really a possibility! His divine sea is damaged, only the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill can repair the divine sea!”

Yang Rui suddenly felt that taking in Ye Yuan was really an extremely wise move.

Now, even he was somewhat in awe of himself.

If Ye Yuan was really able to refine the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill, the significance to the Myriad Treasure Tower was too great!

Even though the Myriad Treasure Tower was renowned throughout the entire Heavenspan World, due to the Jewelhill City not being Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s domain, the Myriad Treasure Tower was not as glorious as on the surface.

Since it was setting up a Myriad Treasure Tower in another heavenly emperor’s territory, then they naturally had to bear a corresponding portion of the tax.

As the saying went: a mighty dragon could not suppress the local snake. The local forces would intentionally or unintentionally suppress the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Just take Jewelhill City for instance. Those able to contend with the Myriad Treasure Tower were the Wang Family, Lin Family, as well as the Lu Family.

As for the Liang Family, this kind of small faction, there were no fewer than over a dozen in abundance.

These small forces mostly clung onto these three families. But the Myriad Treasure Tower had no one to throw their lot with.

Therefore, the Myriad Treasure Tower completely relied on this golden signboard to be able to stand tall in Jewelhill City.

The Myriad Treasure Tower was a colossal business empire. But when it came to Jewelhill City, it was just an insignificant branch. The upper echelons would not attach importance at all.

For Yang Rui to be able to maintain the Myriad Treasure Tower, he had also exhausted his efforts.

If not for so, he might really not care about a measly little Ye Yuan.

After all, he was too desperate for talents.

Feng Ping’s strength was not bad, but it did not rise above the masses in Jewelhill City.

Even the three great major families’ chief alchemists’ strengths were a level above Feng Ping’s.

Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao Pill Refinement brought dawn to Yang Rui. Hence, that was why he would have Luo Jian take action, and even not scruple in offending the Wang Family.

“Ignore that first! What he needs, provide it for him. Don’t flinch at wasting spirit medicines and divine essence stones too!” Yang Rui said.

Manager Su smiled bitterly when he heard that and said, “Tower Lord, providing spirit medicines and divine essence stones for Ye Yuan, it’s actually us profiting! This boy’s efficiency is too high, simply inconceivable!”

Yang Rui froze and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Messing around for so long, it was us who owe him?”

Manager Su nodded and said, “Just that large bath of heaven-grade Divine Essence Pills are already a hundred times profit, worth 100 thousand low-grade divine essence stones! That boy is generous too, not taking a single cent, returning all of it to us. And what we provided was merely the capital of a single medicinal pill’s 10 low-grade divine essence stones. Also, the superior-grade and heaven-grade Divine Essence Pills that he refined, the quality are all very good!”

Yang Rui’s entire body trembled, and he said in surprise, “Such a large profit?”

Manager Su smiled and said, “Heh, these are just heaven-grade Divine Essence Pills. We ticked off the stock inside his practice room, just the heaven-grade Detoxification Pill and Divine Essence Pills added up to around 500. Superior-grade and high-grade medicinal pills even have a thousand! How much profit do you think these added up will be?”

Yang Rui drew a cold breath. His emotions that had just calmed down became restless once again.

What Manager Su said before, he did not care. His focus was all on Ye Yuan refining the divine-grade Detoxification Pill.

Only now did he know that Ye Yuan, this fellow, was simply a pill refining machine. This efficiency was simply too terrifying!

Logically speaking, Ye Yuan helping the Myriad Treasure Tower refine so many medicinal pills, he should draw a percentage.

But, he did not want a single one, giving it all to the Myriad Treasure Tower!

This way, the Myriad Treasure Tower made a huge killing!

He thought that by providing Ye Yuan so many spirit medicines, Ye Yuan would owe their Myriad Treasure Tower a lot, and naturally could not leave the Myriad Treasure Tower either.

But now, it was the Myriad Treasure Tower who owed Ye Yuan too much instead.

This result was what he did not expect from start to end.

“This guy is simply a freak!”

Yang Rui was stifled for a long time and squeezed out this one sentence.

His plans previously were totally useless now.

Manager Su deeply felt that way too, as he said with a nod, “That’s right, this old man thinks so as well!”

Yang Rui waved his hand and said, “Alright then, then don’t need to bother him about this matter anymore. If he can really refine the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill, then it will be when our Myriad Treasure Tower truly rises up! Now, completely seal off the news of the Liang Family’s girl recovering for me. Don’t leak any bit of news. Otherwise, I’ll hold you solely responsible!”
