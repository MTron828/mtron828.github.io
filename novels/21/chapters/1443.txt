Chapter 1447 Those Who Submit Prospers, Those Who Defy Shall Perish!

Inside the Soul Suppressing Pearl, Ye Yuan looked at that fair and flawless face. His heart was in extreme pain.

So many years had passed, Mu Lingxue still had that peerless appearance, like a sleeping beauty, as if one could wake up her at any time.

But in these few years, Ye Yuan had once attempted countless times before and never succeeded.

Ye Yuan knew that in this peerlessly beautiful shell, there was already not a trace of life.

What there was, was only the currently dissipating spiritual consciousness.

Puu, puu, puu ...

Suddenly, clusters of gloomy cold light lit up around Mu Lingxue, like lighting candles.

These candle light-like gloomy lights enclosed Mu Lingxue’s surroundings very quickly, guarding her in the middle.

“This is soul fire, able to hide this lass’s aura and let her spiritual consciousness keep going without dissipating. As long as the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are still there, it can provide power for the Soul Suppressing Pearl unceasingly, lighting this soul fire.”

Hearing Dustless’s words, a large rock in Ye Yuan’s heart landed.

These few years, Ye Yuan was actually very anxious in his heart.

“Senior, how long can these soul fires burn?” Ye Yuan asked.

Dustless’s let out a sigh when he heard that and said, “No idea how many lifetimes of blessing this girlie cultivated either, to be worth you risking your life to go and snatch these Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones for her. These Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are sufficient for her spiritual consciousness to maintain and not dissipate for 200 years.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said, “Just 200 years?”

Dustless nodded and said, “Isolate Heavenly Dao aura isn’t so easily accomplished.”

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh helplessly and said, “This road is really arduous! This trip was nine chances to die and one chance to live, and it only exchanged for 200 year’s time.”

Just 200 years was merely a snap of a finger to Deity Realm powerhouses.

In these 200 years, not only did Ye Yuan have to cultivate, he even had to search for Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones everywhere. It was really very hard.

This trip into the Sky Foothill World could be said to be powerful enemies all-round. Regardless of whether it was Duan Fei or Qin Tian, even Huo Tianyang, they were all very troublesome opponents to Ye Yuan.

Although Ye Yuan successfully counter-killed two great Origin Deity powerhouses by relying on his wits in the end, the perils of the process were what outsiders could not imagine.

But, then again, this trip into the Sky Foothill World, one got to really thank Thundercry’s Heavenly Thunder Swift Talismans.

Otherwise, whether to win or lose was seriously hard to predict.

Thundercry handed the Heavenly Thunder Swift Talismans to Ye Yuan in order to let him have the ability to escape.

He probably never dreamed that Ye Yuan actually relied on these three Heavenly Thunder Swift Talismans and killed two mighty Origin Deity powerhouses, and even snatched back seven pieces of Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones.

“You’ve already done very well!” Dustless patted Ye Yuan’s shoulder and comforted.

...

In a twinkle, half a year’s time already passed.

In this half a year, Dustless had been constantly absorbing the energy in the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones.

The White Night Sacred Palace’s powerhouses never went far away the whole time. They were all waiting for Bai Chen to refine the Dao Fruit.

Except, they all seemed somewhat anxious at this time.

“Grand Elder, I wonder when Palace Lord will be able to finish refining it? What if ... the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s people came?” Bai Xiu said rather worriedly.

“This will have to depend on his good fortune. But I reckon that the time should be just about there,” Ye Yuan said.

Only after hearing Ye Yuan’s words did everyone calm down slightly.

Suddenly, a terrifying aura suddenly descended. Everyone’s expressions changed greatly.

“W-What a powerful aura! This ... This is the aura of grand completion Origin Deity! Could it be the Sky Foothill Palace Lord coming in person?”

Bai Xiu’s complexion became incomparably pale. The might of this aura virtually made people despair.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed slightly too, not expecting that they were actually exposed.

“Heh, what a clever and ingenious fellow, made this palace lord search for so long! Come on out!” A dignified voice sounded out in the space outside.

“Go on out!”

Ye Yuan extended a hand and tapped. Space shattered, everyone’s figures appeared.

In the air was an old man with deep eyes.

Behind the old man were even seven powerhouses.

These seven people were all middle-stage and late-stage Origin Deity experts!

While that old man himself was a grand completion Origin Deity Realm powerhouses.

This force, when put together, was simply too terrifying.

Seeing Ye Yuan and the others reveal themselves, the old man said with a profound gaze, “This palace lord searched in this area for over a dozen days without results. If not for this palace lord having a flash of inspiration and using the Profound Space Dharmamudra, you all might really have evaded it!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent and looked toward the Dharmamudra that was suspending in front of the old man. An extremely powerful spatial undulation revealed above it.

After coming out from underground, Ye Yuan opened up a pocket space in the nearby forest and let the White Night Sacred Palace’s group of people hide inside, avoiding the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s search.

He did not expect that it was still just a step short of success.

A small world’s space was far from as stable as the Heavenspan World’s. With Ye Yuan’s current strength, opening up a pocket space was nothing difficult.

It was just that he did not expect that this Sky Foothill Divine Palace still had a divine artifact that detected spatial undulations, to actually be discovered by them.

“Your esteemed self is the Sky Foothill Palace Lord?” Ye Yuan said somberly.

“Since you know this palace lord, why haven’t you truthfully given that kid’s whereabouts? Otherwise, this palace lord will make you regret living on this earth!”

A burst of killing intent spread out. Everyone’s faces changed.

But Ye Yuan was unmoved and said coolly, “Dao Fruit coming into being, the Sky Foothill World has a worthy successor. You all should comply with Heaven’s Will. Don’t do the kind of things that will bring about your own destruction.”

The Sky Foothill Palace lord laughed coldly and said, “Heaven’s Will? This palace lord is Heaven’s Will! The Sky Foothill Divine Palace dominated generation after generation, how can it be a brat who’s still wet behind his ears’ turn to come and rule?”

The Sky Foothill Palace Lord could be said to be a sovereign-like existence in the Sky Foothill World.

Now, Bai Chen coming into existence with a roar threatened his position. How could he willingly yield his sovereign authority with both hands?

The Sky Foothill Palace’s expression turned grim and he said, “Looks like you’re refusing a toast, only to drink a forfeit!”

Finished talking, the Sky Foothill Palace Lord waved a palm very casually, crushing over toward Ye Yuan’s direction.

In an instant, heaven and earth changed colors because of it!

In the Sky Foothill World, grand completion Origin Deity powerhouses were virtually on par with Heavenly Dao.

The moment he attacked, it was truly powerful to the extreme.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s face revealed a mocking smile.

Boom!

Everyone only felt a blur before their eyes. The palm that could topple mountains and overturn the seas immediately vanished into thin air!

A youth stood in the air, suddenly appearing in everyone’s line of sight.

“Palace Lord!”

“It’s Palace Lord! Hahaha ... Palace Lord refined the Dao Fruit!”

“Palace Lord is mighty and unparalleled!”

...

The White Night Sacred Palace’s people originally lost all hope already. But seeing that youth’s back view, they were immediately wild with ecstasy. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The youth was none other than precisely Bai Chen!

The current Bai Chen was strikingly similar to when Ye Yuan took control of Heavenly Dao back then.

Bai Chen’s gaze was like lightning. Looking in the Sky Foothill Palace Lord’s direction, he said in a cold voice, “From this day forth, I, Bai Chen, take control of Sky Foothill! Those who submit, propers! Those who defy, perish!”

Sky Foothill Palace Lord’s entire body trembled. He discovered that he was so insignificant in front of this youngster.

Even if he was only at the Heaven Glimpse Realm!
