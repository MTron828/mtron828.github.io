Chapter 2761: Come Hunt Me Down if You Have the Ability!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bang! Bang! Bang!

One astonishing rumbling sound after another exploded in the horizon. The undulations spread extremely far away.

Origin divinities engaging in battle did not have fresh blood, but it was even more dangerous.

Each move damaged the foundation!

If Heavenly Stratum powerhouses lost their fleshy bodies, the origin divinity could exist independently and cultivate.

But, without the origin divinity, one would really be dead.

Each of Ye Yuan’s arrows was unparalleled and domineering. It was useless no matter how Yan Jadetrue dodged.

At the opposite end, Yan Jadetrue was being bombarded until he cried out but was at a loss on what to do.

Although he cultivated to True Sovereign Heaven, in terms of origin divinity means, how could he measure up to Ye Yuan?

Each of Ye Yuan’s arrows was burning the origin divinity, erupting with a power that far exceeded his level.

If his physical body was still around, even if he was not a genuine True Sovereign Heaven, it would be more than enough to deal with Ye Yuan too.

But unfortunately, Ye Yuan had incredible power in the path of origin divinity!

“Damn it! How can you, a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven, erupt with such a terrifying origin divinity attack?” Yan Jadetrue yelled strangely.

The Arrow of God Extermination in Ye Yuan’s hands did not stop as he said indifferently, “You should have expected when you made a move against me, and I’m not that easy to deal with!”

“You lunatic! Attacking like this, you’ll be the first to die!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent as he said, “So what? When your origin divinity is obliterated to a certain degree, Frivolous Life Like a Dream will naturally claim your life! You have to expend considerable soul force to suppress the Frivolous Life Like a Dream currently, right?”

When Yan Jadetrue heard that, he was practically about to go berserk, crying out strangely repeatedly.

That’s right!

The reason why he was helpless to do anything to Ye Yuan was precisely because of the Frivolous Life Like a Dream’s existence.

Otherwise, with his current origin divinity strength, no matter how formidable Ye Yuan’s means, it was impossible to be his match too.

True Sovereign Heaven and Saint Sovereign Heaven were two different levels to begin with!

To the vast majority of people, that was an insurmountable chasm.

But it was also precisely because of this that Yan Jadetrue was depressed until he wanted to vomit blood.

He schemed heavily and finally reached True Sovereign Heaven, but he was actually suppressed by Ye Yuan until he was unable to retaliate!

This battle was too fierce and already alarmed countless powerhouses.

At the borders of the battlefield, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s powerhouses had already rushed over.

This battle’s commotion was too big. They felt it far away at Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

It was in their territory. So it was impossible for them to not come.

Sect Master Chen Tai’s brows furrowed tightly, and he said, “Head Elder, do you feel that that True Sovereign Heaven’s origin divinity is very familiar?”

Head Elder’s expression changed over and over again, and he said, “You’re saying … Ancestor? Honestly, that’s really true! But Ancestor has already broken through to True Sovereign Heaven, and he’s actually not Ye Yuan’s match! Also, why would Ye Yuan be fighting with Ancestor in an origin divinity state? Could it be that … his physical body was annihilated?”

Yan Jadetrue discovered them too and roared, “Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s disciples, what are you all still in a daze for? I’m the Ancestor! hurry up and kill this brat!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of Chen Tai and the rest changed greatly.

However, they did not act right away because they were still unsure.

Yan Jadetrue yelled loudly when he saw the situation. He said, “The Heavenspan Mountain is on this boy! As long as we kill him, not only will our Jadetrue Heavenly Sect rise again, we’ll be able to overtake all sects! This exalt has already lost my physical body. It’s useless to me! At that time, the Heavenspan Mountain will be yours!”

“That small world that you all passed through when you went to the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm was refined by this exalt. It’s called the Heavenspan World! Ye Yuan ascended from the Heavenspan World! Now, do you all understand? This kid no longer has much soul force. His origin divinity is greatly damaged. We’ll be able to kill him by joining hands!”

The words made the faces of Chen Tai and the rest change once again.

Being able to say these words, they had already determined that this was their Ancestor.

Furthermore, what Yan Jadetrue said also made them quite moved.

There was no way to use a grandmist treasure without the physical body. This was also a fact.

Therefore, as long as they killed Ye Yuan, then the Heavenspan Mountain would be theirs.

This temptation was huge.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, and he said, “Don’t be naive! You all are nothing but chess pieces in his eyes! The Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm’s passageway opening was done by him! You all saw it. Does your Ancestor care about your life and death? If not for me, you all would have long died in the Labyrinth Divine Palace! Now, he’s merely making use of you all, that’s all!”

“Chen Tai, you stay out of today’s matter. I’ll let you break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven later on! I, Ye Yuan, am a man of my word, you know it!”

Chen Tai and the rest were just about to take action, but they started hesitating again because of what Ye Yuan said.

When in the Labyrinth Divine Palace, Ye Yuan had always been guarding against him and did not let him break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

But Ye Yuan’s trustworthiness was indeed very good.

Back then, Ye Yuan snatched Shi Yue’s Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower but helped him refine the Four Qi Pill later on.

If it were someone else, they definitely would not have done so.

When Yan Jadetrue saw Chen Tai hesitate, he could not help becoming exasperated!

He already almost could not suppress the Frivolous Life Like a Dream anymore.

Once it erupted, under an internal revolt and foreign invasion, he would definitely die before Ye Yuan!

At this rate, he would die without a doubt!

Yan Jadetrue’s intestines were already green with regret now!

He thought that Ye Yuan had been searching for people these few years, and it was impossible to have broken through to Saint Sovereign. That was why he came to settle the scores.

Who knew that Ye Yuan’s origin divinity had long already broken through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Although he broke through to True Sovereign Heaven, there was a large part of his soul force that had to be used to suppress the Frivolous Life Like a Dream.

Under his violent rage, he made a move against Ye Yuan without the slightest hesitation.

As a result, the end was tragic.

Since he dreaded Ye Yuan, he should have immediately left after breaking through!

Settle what scores?

It was simply seeking death!

At this time, Ye Yuan’s origin divinity was already very dim, but he was also not far from death anymore.

“Damn it! Ye Yuan, you forced me!”

Yan Jadetrue was hit by an arrow. Borrowing the force of the counter-shock, he rushed toward the crowd.

Ye Yuan’s figure moved. Chasing after, it was another arrow!

“Ahh!”

Yan Jadetrue screamed miserably, but his speed accelerated even faster!

And the direction that he was flying in was precisely Chen Tai there!

When Chen Tai saw the situation, his expression could not help changing drastically, turning around and fleeing.

But it was already too late!

How fast was Yan Jadetrue’s speed?

He grabbed toward Chen Tai and actually directly grabbed Chen Tai’s origin divinity out!

Yan Jadetrue was too strong. Chen Tai did not have the power to resist at all.

It was not just Chen Tai. He grabbed across and more than ten Jade Sovereign Heavens’ origin divinities were extracted by him.

“You bastards! This exalt established the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect. You guys are actually disrespectful to this exalt! Forget it. This exalt will use your origin divinities to block this calamity then!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, shooting out the Arrow of God Extermination again.

Yan Jadetrue laughed loudly and directly threw those ten plus origin divinities over.

Boom!

The void exploded!

The origin divinities of Chen Tai and the rest directly exploded.

But Yan Jadetrue’s figure flew towards the south.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, and he shouted coldly, “Yan Jadetrue, you can’t escape! My Arrow of God Extermination has my origin divinity mark. You’ve been struck by so many. Even if you hide underground, I can find you too!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

From far away, Yan Jadetrue shouted, “This exalt can’t afford to provoke you, but I can afford to hide! Today, this exalt will leave the Rainclear Continent. Come hunt me down if you have the ability!”
