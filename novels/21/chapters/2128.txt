Chapter 2132: You Can’t Kill Him

The wild elation that filled his chest instantly turned into limitless terror.

Long Hao’s expression changed wildly, frightened until his soul nearly left his body.

He did not understand it. Didn’t his father already arrive? How did this guy move beside him?

This was the final thought in his mind.

After this second, he was thoroughly blasted into residue by Ye Yuan.

“Hao-er!”

Behind, came Long Yu’s heaven-shocking angry roar.

He made it with his fastest speed and locked onto Ye Yuan with powerful world power, planning on killing Ye Yuan with a single blow.

In his view, a late-stage Empyrean mighty expert locking onto a True God Realm martial artist, how could the other party still have the strength to retaliate?

Yet, he miscalculated!

Ye Yuan was just like a loach, slipping away from his world power. Ye Yuan then moved beside Long Hao and killed him!

At this time, all of the Dragon Clan’s members were staring dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape, looking at that slightly skinny figure in disbelief.

“Who on earth is this kid? Why is he so strong?”

“Empyrean Long Yu is a late-stage Empyrean Realm mighty expert, but he actually failed to restrain that human brat!”

“That was spatial law just now, right? That’s a supreme law. Furthermore, looking at his appearance, he has likely already comprehended extremely deep.”

... ...

True God Realm experts were as weak as an ant in front of Empyrean Realm powerhouses.

But Ye Yuan, this ant, shook of Empyrean Long Yu’s final hit and even counter-killed Long Hao.

This kind of strength, how could they not be surprised?

But what everyone was more surprised by was Ye Yuan’s audacity.

A human actually dared to kill three dragons in a row so arrogantly in East Suppression Pseudo World.

This breadth of spirit had no choice but to make people admire!

It was just that the final outcome was already decided.

Empyrean Long Yu looked at Ye Yuan coldly and gnashed his teeth in hatred as he said, “Good! Very good! This Empyrean already arrived and you actually still dared to deal a killing blow. Rest assured, this Empyrean won’t let you die easily!”

Ye Yuan turned to look at Empyrean Long Yu and said coolly, “You wanted to kill me, so why couldn’t I kill him?”

“Bullshit! How can a mere human compare to the human dragon race? No need to say anymore, prepare to suffer this Empyrean’s wrath!”

Amidst the angry roar, Empyrean Long Yu’s aura suddenly erupted.

The berserk dragon race pressure crushed over towards Ye Yuan’s frenziedly.

Empyrean Long Yu reached his hand out and made a grabbing action. An enormous claw extended out of the void and grabbed straight at Ye Yuan.

That horrifying pressure made people’s faces change.

If this claw landed, Ye Yuan’s fleshy body would definitely turn to ashes!

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and did not take any action, and also did not seem to have the intention of running.

But right at this time, a figure slowly walked out of the void and just lightly waved a hand. The enormous claw directly shattered into countless motes of light.

Empyrean Long Yu’s expression changed, and he said in a cold voice, “Long Zhi, what’s the meaning of this?”

This person who walked out of the void was precisely Long Zhi!

Empyrean Long Yu completely made little of Long Zhi by relying on his father.

Normally, he was just a little arrogant. But now, Long Hao being killed, under Long Yu’s rage, how would he still care about Long Zhi?

If not for Long Zhi’s strength being too powerful, he would have long smacked him to death with one palm.

Long Zhi’s brows furrowed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “You can’t kill him.”

Empyrean Long Yu said in a great rage, “Long Zhi, your matters, there will naturally be Father finding you to settle the scores! Now, this punk that you brought killed Hao-er, but you actually say that I can’t kill him? Based on what?!”

Long Zhi said coolly, “Based on that he’s Second Sage!”

“Second Sage? What’s that? Is it very impressive?” A series of puzzled voices came from inside the crowd.

But Empyrean Long Yu’s expression changed!

With his status, he naturally heard before what Second Sage was. That was personally conferred by Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Except, just a title of Second Sage and he wanted to suppress him?

“So what if Sacred Ancestor High Priest? Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s people killed someone in the Dragon Clan. Could it be that our Dragon Clan can’t touch him still? When did Sacred Ancestor High Priest start intervening in our Dragon Clan? Long Zhi, you saying such words, could it be that you threw your lots in with Sacred Ancestor High Priest after taking a trip outside?” Empyrean Long Yu said with a cold smile.

These words were somewhat penetrating, accusing of personal motives instead.

Empyrean Long Yu was clearly not some goody-two-shoes either, planning on using this incident to quell Long Zhi for good.

Long Zhi gave Empyrean Long Yu a sympathetic glance and said coolly, “If you won’t scruple to launch a divine war for Long Hao, I can move aside right now. Can you shoulder it?”

The moment ‘divine war’ two words came out, Empyrean Long YU’s pupils constricted.

“Divine war? Huhu, are you kidding me? Would Sacred Ancestor High Priest launch a divine war for a mere True God Realm?” Empyrean Long Yu said with a disdainful look.

In his view, Long Zhi was scaring him, making him beat a retreat in the face of difficulties.

He knew what Second Sage meant, but he only knew one aspect and was ignorant of the other aspects.

The news of Ye Yuan solving Ask Not already spread in the Demon Divine Region with a hubbub. But barely anyone in East Suppression Pseudo World knew.

Long Zhi said indifferently, “You aren’t aware of it, but Ye Yuan solved the Eternal Chess Game, Ask Not. He sat and debated on Dao with Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest. At present, in Demon Divine Region, Ye Yuan is already above millions and only has one person above him! Oh, right, the Qilin Clan’s Qi Zhen provoked Ye Yuan and was killed by him. The Qilin Clan sent over Heavenly Emperor Zixu, but in the end, they returned in defeat and no longer mentioned the matter of Qi Zhen. How do you think Long Hao compares to Qi Zhen?”

Each additional word that Long Zhi said, the expression on Long Yu’s face became a degree more shocked.

He never could have imagined that this True God Realm brat in front of him actually had such immense capabilities!

“Oh, right, the matter of launching a divine war wasn’t said by this emperor. At that time, Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s seventh disciple, High Priest Stardrive, carried Ask Not over and personally said it to Heavenly Emperor Zixu,” Long Zhi explained further.

Long Zhi’s words stirred up titanic waves in the hearts of Raindragon Stronghold.

“This ... This human actually has such a great background!”

“Isn’t he a human? Why would he become the demon race’s Second Sage?”

“Qi Zhen! That’s the Qilin Clan’s young generation’s strongest alchemist! Back then, when he came to the Dragon Clan, he even defeated Long Xiaohai. He was actually killed by this kid just like that?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

... ...

One news after another exploded in the ears of the Dragon Clan like one bomb after another.

Each incident was inconceivable, but completed by Ye Yuan alone!

Long Yu’s expression became extremely ugly. If what Long Zhi said was true, then there was simply no possibility for him to want to avenge Long Hao!

It did not matter if he killed Ye Yuan, but Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s wrath was not what anyone could bear.

Once a divine war started, the Dragon Clan would be bound to suffer heavy casualties.

At that time, he would be the Dragon Clan’s sinner!

“Now, do you still want to kill him?” Long Zhi said coolly.

While talking, Long Zhi looked toward Ye Yuan. The latter had a calm and collected look. It was as if he had done something insignificant.

Seeing this scene, Long Zhi could not help feeling annoyed.

This guy caused such a huge trouble on the second day he came to the Dragon Clan.

If he had long known this, he would not have brought Ye Yuan here!

This boy was indeed outstandingly talented, making the world sigh with admiration. But his ability to cause trouble was also first-rate!
