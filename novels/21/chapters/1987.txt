Chapter 1991: Competing with Ancient Geniuses!

Everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied. Clearly, they did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually continue challenging.

Logically speaking, Ye Yuan already proved himself and did not need to take the risk anymore.

But he actually chose to continue.

But Song Yu’s expression changed, and he said anxiously, “Brother Ye, you ...”

He was just about to speak, but then he was interrupted. Ye Yuan said, “I promised Jian Sutao that I’ll definitely get this emperor bone for him.”

On the faces of Song Yu, Guo Jingyang, and the rest, revealed doleful looks.

They had never felt that they were so incompetent before!

Ye Yuan choosing to continue, was Jian Sutao the reason?

Definitely!

But they understood in their hearts that Ye Yuan did it more so in order to protect them!

If Ye Yuan gave up, under the Empyrean bone devil’s sword, all of them would have to die.

No one could be spared.

Then, was there danger with Ye Yuan continuing to challenge the Empyrean bone devil?

Of course there was!

They were too clear about Ye Yuan’s strength; just the Empyrean bone devil’s first sword move forced out Sword Hollow Etch this move. So how powerful were the two swords at the back?

Unimaginable!

The bone devil said coolly, “You recover divine essence first then. The power of the second sword will exceed your imagination!”

Ye Yuan did not say anything. He just nodded his head slightly, swallowed a medicinal pill on the spot, and tried to recover his divine essence as fast as he could.

But the others had the jitters when they heard it. Exceeding their imagination; how strong was that?

But very soon, they would see it.

After half a day, Ye Yuan’s divine essence was recovered fully, causing another commotion.

This recovery speed was a little too fast, right?

Ye Yuan came before the bone devil and said with clasped hands, “Senior, please make your move.”

The bone devil nodded slightly, stabbing a sword out indifferently once more.

Although his stance of stabbing the sword was exactly the same as before, everyone’s faces changed.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

...

Even though these children of destiny stood extremely far away, the sharpness exuding from the cutting edge of this sword still made them suffer serious injuries, all spurting fresh blood wildly.

There was no earth-shaking divine essence undulation, but the places that the sword edge passed by, everything was buried in oblivion. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This was the sword of death; it could annihilate everything!

The first sword move was like a baby learning how to walk compared to this sword.

And this was merely just displayed with the strength of a Second Firmament True God.

At this moment, they did not doubt in the slightest that even if it was a Fifth Firmament True God powerhouse, they also absolutely could not escape by a fluke under this sword.

They were very curious just what Ye Yuan would use to block this sword.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan also made his move!

“Sword Hollow Etch!”

Still this move!

This sword was indeed breathtaking, but under the Empyrean bone devil’s second sword, it also paled in comparison.

Bang!

After blocking for a moment, Ye Yuan’s Sword Hollow Etch was ultimately still annihilated.

Then, the remaining momentum of the bone devil’s sword did not reduce, heading straight for Ye Yuan.

“Roar!”

A heaven-shocking dragon roar rose to the sky. Golden light burst forth brilliantly on Ye Yuan’s body, his vitality billowed to the clouds.

At the same time, the Qinghong Battle Armor was also completely activated, releasing a dazzling light.

“Nirvana Dao Profound Dragon Armor!”

Ye Yuan roared, directly meeting the bone devil’s sword.

Bang!

The two collided together without any flashiness; the void was quaking.

A streak of sword energy and a ball of golden light met squarely in the void, neither willing to give in.

The two energies were both being rapidly depleted.

The golden light on Ye Yuan’s body was dissipating at a rapid speed.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them was shocked until they stared dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

“What formidable defensive power! Ye Yuan he actually forcefully resisted this sword!”

“He ... He has the perfect sixth transformation golden body! Just how many trump cards does this guy have?”

“Defensive-type empyrean spirit treasure, perfect sixth transformation golden body, dragon race’s pinnacle defensive martial technique; this guy ... simply makes people go crazy!”

...

At this moment, how could Ye Yuan still care about holding anything back? He displayed all of his trump cards in their entirety.

In terms of defense, he was number one in the same rank.

These three things added together, even if he stood there and let Fourth Firmament True Gods hit, Fourth Firmament True Gods still could not breach his defenses.

Just this aspect, Ye Yuan was stronger than Zhou Yu by no idea how many times.

But unfortunately, this sword move was not released by Zhou Yu, but the Empyrean Realm bone devil.

Even if suppressed to a Second Firmament True God strength, even if Ye Yuan neutralized a portion of the force with Sword Hollow Etch, Ye Yuan still could not withstand this swift and fierce sword.

“Puhwark!”

The light on Ye Yuan’s body directly dissipated, wildly spewing a mouthful of fresh blood, his body directly flying out several tens of thousands of feet like a kite with a broken string.

Song Yu’s face changed. His figure moved, hurriedly going over to catch Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s body was already drenched by fresh blood.

The power of this sword was utterly horrifying!

“Really received it!”

“Are my eyes failing me? He really succeeded!”

“If it were me, I’d probably be one-shotted immediately. Right?”

...

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan with incredible shock, eyes full of incredulity.

Such a terrifying sword was actually received by Ye Yuan.

One had to know, they were two minor realms higher than Ye Yuan. But that trace of sword energy that leaked out seriously injured them!

No wonder the Empyrean bone devil said that the power of this sword exceeded one’s imagination.

Indeed far beyond imagination.

“Cough, cough, cough ...”

A bout of intense coughing sounds came over. Ye Yuan finally caught his breath.

But the injuries of his internal organs were extremely heavy currently. He could not even stand up.

Ever since he cultivated to the perfect sixth transformation golden body, he had yet to suffer such serious injuries before.

The power of this sword indeed surpassed his imaginations.

The bone devil looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Junior, you’re very decent. Your potential when put in this Empyrean’s era, is also an ordinary genius already. However ... it’s also merely just decent. You’re still quite a bit off from being a true genius. True geniuses can receive my third sword move. But you ... the second sword move is already your limit. No harm telling you then. The power of the third sword move is 50 times stronger than the second sword move!”

Everyone was rendered speechless, from one shock, sinking into the midst of another shock.

Ye Yuan receiving this sword already made them feel ashamed of their unworthiness.

But, from the Empyrean bone devil’s mouth, Ye Yuan’s talent was also merely thus!

Merely ... just an ordinary genius!

If Ye Yuan’s talent was merely an ordinary genius, then what would a true genius be like?

These children of destiny were all from great imperial capitals. They understood in their hearts that Ye Yuan’s talent, when placed in Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas, was likely also a peak existence.

But, from the Empyrean bone devil’s mouth, he was actually just ordinary!

Just how strong were the geniuses of that era?

Truly a terrifying era!

“Senior, I ... want to challenge ... the third sword move!” Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and said feebly.

“What? He ... He still wants to challenge the third sword move, is he mad?”

“These should be his final trump cards, right? He was nearly almost killed just now! So it’s absolutely impossible for him to receive the third sword move!”

“The second sword is already powerful until it makes people despair. So how strong will the third sword move be?”

...

Ye Yuan’s words made the group of children of destiny burst into an uproar.

Even the Empyrean bone devil also determined that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to receive the third sword move anymore. This guy actually chose to receive the third sword without hesitation!

Was this guy mad? Or was he tired of living?

Could it be that he was triggered by this Empyrean bone devil?

They guessed correctly!

People should not look at how Ye Yuan normally had an appearance of not giving a crap about anything; the pride in his heart, no one could scorn it.

Originally, he only wanted to protect Song Yu and the others.

But now, he had a reason to receive the third sword move for himself!

He wanted to cross space-time and compete with ancient geniuses!
