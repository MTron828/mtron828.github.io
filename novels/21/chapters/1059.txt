Chapter 1063: You Don’t Understand Me

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The black-clothed person beside Sun Man gave Ye Yuan a very familiar feeling.

But he could not recall it for a moment either, where in the world he had seen this black-clothed person before.

This black-clothed person concealed his entire body. His divine sense was also completely shielded, unable to see his true nature at all. But Ye Yuan just felt that he seemed to have seen him somewhere before.

“Seven Absolute City and Heavenly Dawn Palace have both sustained heavy losses. This result is for the best. Now, this seat is here to clean up the household. There shouldn’t be anyone who has objections, right?”

Sun Man’s gaze swept past everyone’s faces and finally landed on Ye Yuan.

When at the entrance of the Immemorial Medicine Garden, the various major forces mutually restrained each other. It was inconvenient for Sun Man to take action too.

But now, he just so happened to run into the Seven Absolute City and Heavenly Dawn Palace, the two great forces’ peak Void Mystic Powerhouses seriously injured. It was a good opportunity.

The moment Yue Xinping saw, he could not help being overjoyed as he said, “No objections, no objections! Hall Master Sun, feel free to take action! I’ve long been irked by this punk! I hope for Hall Master Sun to succeed! This Yue be leaving first!”

Done talking, Yue Xinping’s figure moved and immediately disappeared before everyone’s eyes.

Jiang Taicang and Wu Luo were naturally unwilling to accept it. But Sun Man’s aura locked onto them from far away, making them not dare to act rashly without careful consideration.

Sun Man was an existence on the same level as He Dajiang and Shu Yunqing. His strength was unfathomable.

More importantly, their side just experienced a great battle, while Sun Man was in a state of full-health, virtually without any losses.

When Wu Yuanqiao saw that Yue Xinping left and Sun Man did not stop it, he could not help being overjoyed.

He immediately bid his farewell. Arriving beside He Dajiang with a flash, he picked him up and disappeared.

Not that he wanted to save He Dajiang, but he already swore an oath. So he had no choice but to rescue him.

Inside this Immemorial Medicine Garden, Wu Yuanqiao was equivalent to a member of the Seven Absolute City.

He currently wished that he could exit this Immemorial Medicine Garden right away. He no longer wanted to get involved in these murky waters.

After the three people left, Sun Man looked at Shu Yunqing and said coolly, “Palace Lord Shu not leaving, could it be that you want to become enemies with my Medicine King Hall? This is my Medicine King Hall’s family matters. Hope that Palace Lord Shu don’t interfere.”

Shu Yunqing’s expression changed several times and finally heaved a sigh and said to Ye Yuan, “Young Master Ji, not that this Shu isn’t willing to help, but I’m seriously powerless to do anything!”

Finished talking, he signaled Ding Zhanguo with a look. The two people left by themselves.

In a blink of an eye, a large group of people was only left with Ye Yuan’s group of people.

Sun Man’s eyes narrowed slightly. Looking at Ye Yuan, he said, “Hand over the Medicine God’s Soul Canon and the divine artifact. This seat can give you a quick and painless death!”

Ye Yuan looked at Sun Man and smiled.

“Don’t you think that talking with me using this sort of rubbish is somewhat a waste of time? Make your move!”

Sun Man’s face fell, and he said, “Refusing a toast only to drink to a forfeit!”

Sun Man raised his hands, and several streaks of sword light assailed Ye Yuan. Ao Qian’s expression turned cold. Opening up his domain, it instantly blasted away those few streaks of sword light.

Ao Qian had just been through a great battle. Currently, his expenditure was not little either. Dealing with Sun Man appeared rather taxing.

“Milord, leave this guy to Old Ao to deal with. You leave first!” Ao Qian said coldly.

Jiang Taicang and Wu Luo were naturally unwilling to show weakness either. The two people stepped forward together with Ao Qian and formed a triangle battle formation.

“Old Ao, your expenditure earlier was too great! We’ll lend you a helping hand!” Jiang Taicang said.

Ao Qian nodded his head and did not show bravado as well.

If talking about before, for them to want to protect Ye Yuan, that might be compelled by the restrictions of the soul contract still. But now, the three of them were sincere in wanting to escort Ye Yuan to leave.

It was Ye Yuan who gave the three of them new life!

Ye Yuan already used his means to thoroughly win over these three people. Of course, it even included Ruan Shuangzhou.

Sun Man gave a cold laugh and said, “The three of you coming up together, who is protecting this brat then? Bingyun, take that brat down for me!”

Ji Bingyun’s aura had long locked onto Ye Yuan from far away already. It was completely impossible to give him any chance to escape.

At this time, Lu-er blocked in front of Ye Yuan and said, “Young Master, you leave first! I’ll deal with him!”

Ruan Shuangzhou also blocked in front of Ye Yuan with a look of resolution. Clearly, he had already made preparations to die.

Ye Yuan extended his hand and knocked on Lu-er’s head. Carrying a doting smile, he said, “Don’t put on a brave front. You’re not his match.”

Lu-er’s tears flowed, and she said aggrievedly, “Young Master, Lu-er ... is still so useless!”

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Nonsense! If not for you, I’d really not know what to do about those iceflames! Alright, quickly go inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda! Young Master is fine!”

Finished talking, he did not wait for Lu-er to agree either and directly drew her into the Vast Heaven Pagoda.

“Little Junior Brother, I urge that you better give up resisting! Although you have some tricks, this bit of capital is still insufficient to contend with the current Medicine King Hall!” Ji Bingyun said coolly.

Ye Yuan looked at him with a smile that was not a smile and said, “You have a manner like you’ve got me. Don’t you know that I have a divine artifact in possession?”

Deploying the Sacred Dragon Token with Ye Yuan’s current strength, fighting to a draw with Ji Bingyun was still doable.

Ji Bingyun’s strength was almost on par with Jian Wushuang. It was not easy for Ye Yuan to want to kill him. But protecting himself was still achievable.

Ji Bingyun was unmoved and said calmly, “Of course I know. You can endure under my hands. But what about the rest? The three of them are already arrows at the end of their flight. Even if they teamed up, it’s impossible to be Hall Master Sun’s match either.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Enough crap! Make your move!”

Ji Bingyun’s expression turned cold. Sword intent surged towards the sky!

“Tranquil Sword Dance!”

Ji Bingyun gave a cold cry. The longsword shook, and countless sword light immediately wandered around between heaven and earth, and stabbed straight towards Ye Yuan!.

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh, his figure abruptly vanishing from sight. The sword rain that covered the skies all hit nothing.

Wanting to lock onto Ye Yuan without a divine king domain was simply even harder than ascending to the heavens.

Ji Bingyun’s expression changed. He had long known that Ye Yuan had this merging into heaven and earth trick. But after experiencing it for himself, he still felt that it was somewhat fantastical.

This little junior brother, Ji Bingyun was very familiar with him. He was just a fanatic who was devoted to the alchemy Dao with all his heart.

How was he actually able to reach such a terrifying boundary in the heart realm after 20 years of not seeing?

“Little Junior Brother, is it possible that you plan to keep on hiding like this? Or you really plan on abandoning these subordinates of yours and leave by yourself?” Ji Bingyun put away his sword and said coolly.

Ji Bingyun had lived together with Ji Qingyun for several hundred years and naturally understood his character very well.

Ji Qingyun was someone who valued loyalty and friendships immensely. Even if his personality changed a lot in this life, it was impossible for this point to change too.

Although Ao Qian and the rest were just his servants, from just a few words, one could also tell that there was absolutely no way for Ye Yuan to abandon them and leave by himself.

He guessed correctly. It was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to leave.

He slowly revealed his figure and looked at Ji Bingyun with a smile as he said, “Bingyun, you understand me very well. But there’s one thing that you gauged wrongly, I likewise understand you very well, while you ... don’t understand the current me enough at all!”

Ye Yuan slowly drew the Starmoon Sword. A terrifying sword intent rippled out.

When Ji Bingyun saw this scene, his expression could not help changing tremendously!Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
