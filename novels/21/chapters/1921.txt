Ye Yuan put away the token and said with cupped fists, “Many thanks, Elder Ping!”

Elder Ping smiled and said, “Good, good! Indeed, heroes come from youngsters! With your talent, likely in less than ten years, you’ll be able to reach gold alchemy celestial alchemist. Boy, after entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, you have to cultivate well!”

Ye Yuan’s appearance gave Elder Ping a breathtaking feeling.

Having such heaven-defying Alchemy Dao attainments at a young age, he would definitely be able to radiate splendor in the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Elder Ping rest assured, I will.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around and left.

Those examinees looked at Ye Yuan with envious looks on their faces.

This silver token, they had to strive for it for thousands, even tens of thousands of years.

But he, Ye Yuan, directly got it!

“Next!” Elder Ping withdrew his gaze and said coolly.

Sun Jing slowly walked in front of the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire, currently secretly glad in his heart.

“The Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire was awed by that brat just now, it will definitely be much easier for me to subdue it. Heh, this is an opportunity for me! Speaking of which, I still have to thank that kid.”

The moment the restriction opened up, Sun Jin suddenly formed seals with both hands, attempting to directly suppress the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire.

“Awoo!”

A wolf howl came over, that turquoise flame instantly transformed into a horrifying enormous wolf, pouncing over towards Sun Jing.

“Puhwark!”

Sun Jing seemed to have been struck by a tremendous force, directly blasting him flying.

In virtually an instant, his body was practically burned to a crisp, lying on the ground and wailing incessantly.

Swoosh!

The turquoise giant wolf turned into an afterimage, dashing over towards the depths of the hall.

That direction was precisely the direction that Ye Yuan headed to!

Elder Ping’s gaze turned sharp, his figure turning into a streak of lightning, catching up to the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire in virtually a blink of an eye.

“Wicked brute, where are you running!”

Divine fires were spiritual, so this Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire was clearly not so easy to subdue.

Seeing Elder Ping catch up, the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire actually rushed over toward Elder Ping.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Inside the hall, one person and one fire actually broke out into a great battle.

The other people exchanged glances, looking at this scene in immense shock.

“This ... Just what’s going on here? Although the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire is hard to tame, it also won’t be so berserk!”

“It ... It would be chasing after that kid just now, right?”

“What in the world did that brat do, to actually be able to make the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire so crazed?”

...

After a great battle, Elder Ping finally relied on his own powerful strength and captured the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire.

Except, the captured Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire was still incomparably berserk, unable to control at all.

Elder Ping was secretly astonished and said, “This boy’s fire controlling art has already reached the acme of perfection! This Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire actually wants to chase after him to be tamed! Truly frightening!”

The Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire was an extremely difficult to tame rank five divine fire. Ordinary Celestial Deity Realms simply could not subdue it, let alone talk about taming it.

It was also precisely because of this that it would be used in evaluation standard.

But Elder Ping did not expect that Ye Yuan only used the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire to take part in the assessment once and actually thoroughly subdued the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire.

As long as Ye Yuan was willing, he could take possession of it at any time.

Elder Ping understood that this Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire would likely have no one capable of taming it anymore in the future.

He waved his hand and said, “Guards, bring away the Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire. Today’s assessment ends here.”

...

Silver Alchemy Battle Arena, yelling and shouting seethe inside, incomparably bustling.

Not far away, two incomparably profound auras intertwined together on the stage, vying with each other, refusing to give in to the other in the slightest.

“Come on, Mu Daocheng!”

“Mu Daocheng is mighty!”

...

Below the stage, cheering sounds were noisy like a seething cauldron.

In the ring, the middle-aged daoist on the right-side was clearly a notch better.

Very soon, his imposing momentum overpowered the other party.

“Condense!”

It was only to see Mu Daocheng yelled out, the medicinal pill condensing and forming, accomplishing all these in one stroke.

The other alchemist had a dispirited look. His medicinal pill already became a useless pill.

Mu Daocheng said with a smug look, “Huang Zhen, you’re still a hundred years too early to want to challenge me! Hahaha!”

Huang Zhen looked at Mu Daocheng, let out a sigh, and slowly walked down the ring.

Ye Yuan watched this scene rather interestedly. This style of alchemy battle, he really rarely saw it.

Alchemy battles dreaded people disturbing the most. But this kind of alchemy battle arena was completely an open-style format.

Not only would everyone’s cheering sounds not be isolated, but even the other party’s pill refinement also would not use array formation to isolate the view.

Two people facing off was like the life and death fight between two mighty experts.

The victor formed the pill.

The loser ruined the pill!

But Ye Yuan also saw through that these two alchemists’ strengths were indeed very formidable.

Compared to those so-called Five-star Alchemy Gods outside, their strength was much stronger.

Especially that Mu Daocheng, he already reached late-stage Initial Realm, his strength being extraordinary.

Hearing those fervent yelling sounds, this Mu Daocheng clearly possessed very high popularity in the silver arena area.

However, Ye Yuan thought about it and felt that this kind of alchemy battle style could accelerate the improvement of Alchemy Dao’s strength even more instead.

Two people facing off and refining pills, auras meeting each other squarely, one could sense the other party’s Alchemy Dao undulations distinctly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Under such circumstances, even if one failed, it was also possible to learn many things from the other party.

Moreover, under this kind of complicated environment, being able to successfully refine the medicinal pill had tremendous benefits to the alchemist themselves too.

It was no wonder that alchemy gods who possessed the identity of alchemy celestial alchemist were extremely well-received and respected outside. Looking at it now, this Alchemy Celestial Pavilion was indeed extraordinary.

“Tsk tsk, another victory and it will be Mu Daocheng’s tenth successful time defending the ring! At that time, he’ll be able to obtain the gold token and he will become a gold alchemy celestial alchemist!”

“Really envious of him! I’ll probably never be able to advance to gold alchemy celestial alchemist in this lifetime!”

...

Mu Daocheng was extremely proud of his success. He stood on the stage and said loudly, “Who else dares to come up and challenge me? Who! Else!”

The current Mu Daocheng was like a fighting rooster, imposing momentum reaching the pinnacle.

But below the stage, no one dared to go up the stage.

According to the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s rules, as long as one won ten matches in a row, they could complete one arena defense.

Completing ten arena defenses, one would be able to obtain a higher level token.

That way, the status of the alchemist would undergo an earthshaking change.

One had to know, the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s alchemists were not just the Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital’s alchemists.

Even alchemy gods from other Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas were all the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s alchemists.

Under the accumulation of time, the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s influence was actually already very profound and far-reaching.

If one could obtain a higher level token, this would be a massive improvement to the alchemist’s reputation and prestige.

This naturally drove people crazy.

It was just that in the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, wanting to advance was seriously far too difficult.

With the accumulation of time, each alchemist that entered the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion were all not mediocre people.

Wanting to win ten matches in a row was really very difficult.

Moreover, one even needed ten consecutive victories before they could advance.

And it was precisely because of this that the identity of an alchemist from Alchemy Celestial Pavilion was more valuable.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan leaped up lightly. Stepping into the ring, he looked at Mu Daocheng and said with a faint smile, “Let me try.”
