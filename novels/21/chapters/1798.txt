1802 A Zither Melody

Several figures flew out of Firecloud Peak. Each and every one of them was in a hurry.

Qian Ye, Yi Qingxiang, Jiang Xueyan, and the rest were all in tattered clothing currently, as if they were beggars.

Song Ting, Duan Qinghong, Zhong Hanlin, and the rest, their appearances were even more miserable. They were seriously injured and already on the verge of death.

Under the three great fierce beasts’ encirclement, this group of people narrowly broke out of the heavy encirclement. But the price paid was also extremely heavy.

Qian Ye’s expression was livid as he gritted his teeth and said, “Really damn it to hell! Rank five fierce beasts are all extremely proud. So how could they possibly join hands with each other?”

How did Jiang Xueyan still have any hint of the appearance of a fairy maiden at this time? She was like a crazy woman instead.

Hearing Qian Ye’s words, she panted and said, “These three fierce beasts must be Firecloud Peak’s overlord-class existences. Why would they appear in the same area at the same time?”

Qian Ye gave a cold snort and said, “Ignore that. Since even those three fierce beasts appeared in the same area, that punk is definitely dead until not even dregs remain already.”

The rest all nodded their heads in agreement when they heard that.

Although very puzzled in their hearts, they did not want to come to this Firecloud Peak anymore.

Either way, judging from the traces, Ye Yuan definitely entered that area. Then the outcome that awaited him could only be one.

Confirming that Ye Yuan was already dead, they naturally did not have the mind to care about whatever oddity in this remote hinterlands anymore.

Yi Qingxiang scolded angrily, “If this kid died, then he’s died. To actually cause us to be injured like this, truly deserve death!”

Jiang Xueyan said coldly, “Alright, enough crap! If that kid doesn’t die, his threat would be immense to us three great factions! You guys hurry up and bring those two back. Otherwise, they would really die!”

Qian Ye and Yi Qingxiang’s faces changed, gave a cold snort, and flew over in the direction of Tianying Peak.

...

After several years, an elegant and ethereal figure arrived at Tianying Peak, immediately attracting a series of sidelong glances.

“Eh, isn’t that the Baili Qingyan of Canopy Peak? Why would she come to our Tianying Peak?”

“Truly beautiful! What’s even more damnable is that her talent is even extremely terrifying. I heard that she just entered the sect for a few years, and she already broke through to half-step Celestial Deity.”

“Truly monstrous! Right now, the sect is already grooming her with all their power, planning on having her take part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave this time.”

...

These few years, Baili Qingyan could be said to have no equal in the limelight in the Shadowmoon Sect.

Her talent utterly crushed her peers. Even some veteran genius disciples were also firmly suppressed by her.

The requirements of participating in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave was extremely stringent. Skeletal age could not exceed 2000 years, and one must even be a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse.

In the entire Shadowmoon Sect, there were few who satisfied this condition.

The likes of Jiang Xueyan and Qian Ye were all strong contenders for this Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s slots.

It was just that their talent compared to Baili Qingyan was still not enough to look at.

Baili Qingyan’s startling performance during the entrance examination, coupled with the Immortal Abode lineage’s powerful strength, the sect had large quantities of resources biased towards her currently.

Having talent in addition to resources, Baili Qingyan’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds, with a trend of catching up from behind.

In just a few years, Baili Qingyan was already almost breaking through to the Celestial Deity Realm.

To ordinary disciples, although this step was not considered a heavenly chasm, it absolutely could not be achieved in such a short time.

“This junior apprentice brother, I wonder where Ye Yuan is at?”

Baili Qingyan stopped a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord disciple. That disciple immediately felt light-headed, his chest instantly filled with happiness.

Except, about this question, he clearly did not know.

Asking several people in a row, no one knew Ye Yuan this person. This made Baili Qingyan puzzled.

“Impossible! With his talent, how can he possibly be unknown in Tianying Peak?”

Carrying this doubt, Baili Qingyan found the abode assigning disciple again.

“This junior apprentice brother, I’m Canopy Peak’s Baili Qingyan. I want to check Ye Yuan’s residence.”

The present Baili Qingyan already gradually developed the aura of a sovereign.

When talking to ordinary disciples, she was akin to a fairy maiden high above the clouds, making people not dare to look her in the eyes.

But only toward Ye Yuan, she could not quite let it go all along.

Wang Quan already died, so the disciple here naturally as a different person. But even if Baili Qingyan did not introduce herself, he also recognized her, and naturally would not refuse. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He checked and saw Ye Yuan’s name very soon. His expression could not help changing as he said, “Junior Apprentice Brother Ye was sent to Firecloud Peak, most likely ...”

Baili Qingyan’s heart thumped, immediately having a foreboding premonition and she said anxiously, “Most likely what?”

That disciple said, “Firecloud Peak isn’t developed yet. There are fierce beasts everywhere, and also quite a few rank five existences. The disciples who went to open up an abode there have never returned alive before. About Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, there have already been no news for several years. Most likely ... he’s already buried in Firecloud Peak.”

Baili Qingyan’s face changed and she said in a cold voice, “Nonsense! With Ye Yuan’s strength, how can he possibly die at the hands of fierce beasts?”

She knew what place Ye Yuan had gone before. How could he possibly have died?

That disciple saw Baili Qingyan fly off the handle and immediately did not even dare to breathe loudly, faltering and unable to speak.

At the same time, he was also very curious in his heart. Who in the world was this Ye Yuan, to actually be able to make the goddess so concerned?

Seeing that disciple not speak, Baili Qingyan bit her lips gently, turned around, and left Tianying Peak, going to find Jiang Xueyan.

“Senior Apprentice Sister, was Ye Yuan’s matters arranged by you?” Baili Qingyan’s face was cold as frost as she questioned.

Jiang Xueyan knew that she could not hide for long and said smilingly, “It has nothing to do with me. It was all arranged by Qian Ye. If you want to take revenge, you can go find him.”

Baili Qingyan’s expression changed and she said in shock, “Take revenge? Ye Yuan he really ... really died?”

Jiang Xueyan recounted the events on that day with a smile. Baili Qingyan immediately turned ashen pale, a sorrowful emotion welling up in her heart.

“I ... What’s with me? I clearly ... clearly hate him very much! But why ... do I have a feeling of wanting to cry?”

When Jiang Xueyan saw this scene, she could not help heaving a sigh as she said, “That kid was too arrogant and insolent on the account of his ability. He didn’t know how to restrain himself. He’d die sooner or later in the Shadowmoon Sect. Now, isn’t it great that he’s dead? You can focus on cultivating and strive to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm as soon as possible, and then you can prepare for the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.”

Baili Qingyan ignored her and left in low spirits.

After several days, a Baili Qingyan in white clothes appeared at the top of Firecloud Peak.

The Baili Qingyan without any makeup, clad in white, seemed like an otherworldly fairy maiden.

In front of her, a zither was placed.

“You frivolous scoundrel! My, Baili Qingyan’s, zither, will only be played for the person I love! But you blackmailed with this and followed me into the Shadowmoon Mountain Range! I hate you! Now, you and I are separated by death. The promise of that day can no longer be fulfilled. Today, I’ll play a melody on my zither. I hope that you can hear my zither sound in the underworld.”

Ten fingers moving lightly, the sounds of the zither lingered sweetly, spilling throughout the entire Firecloud Peak.

A thousand-mile lonely grave, nowhere to speak dreary words.

In the zither sound, tenderness and saddened pain exuded everywhere.

With the song ending, Baili Qingyan already had tears covering her face.

“Turned out that my zither strings have already been stirred by you.” Baili Qingyan choked.
