1687 Head Elder, Ye Yuan!

The moment Xuan Yu retired, only Ruo Xu could become this Head Elder!This struggle finally still ended in Ruo Xu’s victory!

Indeed, Xuan Yu had been the head elder for so many years, but his presence was virtually zero.

The major and minor matters of the Pill Tower were mostly decided by Ruo Xu.

Xuan Yu was practically made a figurehead.

If it was another person, carrying on like this also had no meaning. Might as well resign from the position of head elder to avoid embarrassment.

Ruo Xu’s face revealed a look of great joy. He had suppressed Xuan Yu for so many years. Suddenly being ridden on top of his head by him, he was naturally rather unhappy.

Now, he finally brought Xuan Yu down.

There was virtually little hope of Ruo Xu to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm and become a Five-star Alchemy God.

And his desire for power had inflated limitlessly.

Losing the position of head elder was a crowning humiliation to him.

Today, this disgrace was finally washed away!

Those Pill Tower elders all looked very excited too. Clearly, they felt happy about the success of their team.

Of course, under this kind of circumstances, they could not behave too overboard. But they were already ready to go back and congratulate properly.

“Head Elder, why are you doing this? In our Pill Tower, your strength is the greatest. This position of Head Elder, you’re the most suited!”

“Yeah, Head Elder, you have to think thrice before acting!”

“Head Elder, this kind of joke mustn’t be joked, be careful, take caution!”

...

These elders all started urging. It was just that their tones appeared very perfunctory.

Those present were all extremely experienced people. Who could not tell?

Coldfeather looked at this scene with a smile, having a disdainful look on his face.

While Ning Zhiyuan had his head lowered, looking straight down as if it had nothing to do with him.

Clearly, he already learned to be wise.

Today’s matter was rather unusual. It was very likely to be related to Ye Yuan. Opening his mouth again, he would be a fool.

At this time, Ning Zhiyuan was very grateful to Ning Tianping in his heart. If it wasn’t for him, the Ning Family also would not benefit from being in a favorable position. They would definitely capsize again today.

Doing it again today, that would be offending Ye Yuan to the core.

Regarding these perfunctory voices to persuade him to stay, Xuan Yu understood in his heart. But he just smiled faintly and said, “Many thanks, everyone. Not being the head elder, this old man is still a member of the Pill Tower and can still contribute to Heavenly Eagle.”

Ruo Xu’s face had unconcealable smugness, but he still consoled, “Actually, I feel that it’s a good thing for Younger Brother Xuan Yu to temporarily resign from the position of head elder. He’s only a step away from becoming a Five-star Alchemy God right now. It’s time to put down secular affairs and seek to break through wholeheartedly. If Younger Brother Xuan Yu can breakthrough to become a Five-star Alchemy God, that will truly be a great thing for our Heavenly Eagle!”

These words sounded nice, but breaking through to become a Five-star Alchemy God, it was easier said than done. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It was not that to reach the half-step Celestial Deity Realm, you just had to work hard slightly and you would be able to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm.

Take Gao Yuan that guy as an example. Reached half-step Celestial Deity Realm for several tens of thousands of years but he didn’t break through to the Celestial Deity Realm either.

Following that, everyone feigned another round of persuasion to stay. Xuan Yu said coolly, “Everyone, there’s no need to persuade me. This old man’s mind is made up.”

At this point, the surface work had been done. Everyone naturally no longer try to persuade him.

He Chong said coolly, “What Ruo Xu said is right. Xuan Yu has already stepped into becoming a half-step Celestial Deity and should go into seclusion properly and strive to break through to become a Five-star Alchemy God. Since his mind is made up, then this matter is decided. Now, I’ll announce the new candidate for head elder.”

Hearing this, Ruo Xu’s face revealed an eager expression.

Other people’s gazes are also cast on him.

Ruo Xu was a little excited in his heart. The feeling of being the focus on attention was pretty good.

In Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, the Pill Tower’s position of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City had high authority and power. It could be said to be beneath two people and above tens of thousands.

This kind of power, who could be unmoved?

He Chong slowly opened his mouth and said, “The position of the Pill Tower’s head elder is of utmost importance to my Heavenly Eagle. Naturally, the person with the greatest strength has to take on the post. This person is ...”

Speaking until here, He Chong deliberately paused, sweeping a glance over everyone’s faces, finally stopped on Ruo Xu’s face.

That expression was somewhat complicated.

However, the current Ruo Xu clearly did not notice it.

His buttocks already left his seat, preparing to receive the new appointment.

“Ye Yuan!”

At this time, He Chong lightly spat these two words out of his mouth.

Ruo Xu’s smile instantly froze on his face.

He stood up halfway currently, but in the end, what He Chong spat out of his mouth was not his name.

This scene was rather awkward.

Everyone was extremely shocked, being rendered dumbfounded by this name.

How could the head elder be Ye Yuan?

How could the head elder possibly be Ye Yuan?

“G-Grand Elder, is ... is there a mistake?” Ruo Xu said with a look of disbelief.

Even though he knew that Ye Yuan returned. Even if he broke through, he was also not qualified enough to be the head elder, right?

He Chong’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Ruo Xu, do you take this old man to be muddle-headed? Such a major matter, would I be mistaken? Brother Zuo, come on out.”

He Chong’s words made everyone’s entire body tremble.

The city lord actually came in person?

At this time, the door to the side hall slowly opened. An old man and a young man, two people, walked out.

The old one was the City Lord Zuo Shujie whose movements and traces were elusive and secretive. The young one was naturally Ye Yuan.

Even Ning Zhiyuan also trembled all over when he saw City Lord personally send Ye Yuan out.

This matter of Ye Yuan assuming the post of head elder, he did not know beforehand.

It was just that he felt that the timing of Xuan Yu’s resignation was too coincidental, so he faintly felt that it was related to Ye Yuan.

But he did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually going to replace Xuan Yu and take on the post of head elder!

Furthermore, it was even City Lord escorting him over personally.

The shocked ones were naturally not just Ning Zhiyuan alone.

The others were dumbfounded too!

The matters in the city, City Lord never took an interest in them.

If there really was something, it was also He Chong acting in capacity.

They did not expect that this time, for the sake of Ye Yuan assuming the post, he actually came personally!

Looking at Ye Yuan again, they were shocked again.

Ye Yuan really broke through!

Even though it somewhat could not be seen through, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body was absolutely one in the Divine Lord Realm without a doubt!

However, letting a guy who just broke through to Divine Lord Realm be the head elder, it was taking it too lightly, right?

With Zuo Shujie appearing, He Chong took a back seat.

“Add a chair for Ye Yuan, put in on Xuan Yu’s right-hand side,” Zuo Shujie said coolly.

Under the word of command, someone immediately added a seat to Xuan Yu’s right, letting Ye Yuan sit on it.

Even though it was just a small gesture, it revealed Zuo Shujie’s regard for Ye Yuan!

Ruo Xu’s expression flickered incessantly. He could not understand what capability this brat had to actually climb on top of his head!

Zuo Shujie gave everyone a glance and slowly opened his mouth and said, “I know that many people among you all are puzzled, why Ye Yuan should be the head elder! Actually, Ye Yuan wasn’t willing to be this head elder. It was this city lord who requested repeatedly until he was willing to take the post.”
