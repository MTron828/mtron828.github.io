1386 Each Preparing for Battle!

In the Qin Family’s hall, Qin Nantian father and son were seated on the right-hand side, Qin Shao standing on the left.

“How was it? Did he agree?” Qin Nantian asked in a solemn voice.

He did not have much courteousness towards this branch nephew who obtained the Golden Sword Token.

The high and mighty attitude was clear at a glance.

Qin Nantian could not be blamed either. The Qin Family’s geniuses were seriously too many!

Especially under the cover of Qin Tian’s light, Qin Shao’s achievements were not so dazzling.

“He and I made a three years agreement!” Qin Shao said.

Qin Nantian was first a little surprised, then furrowed his brows and said unhappily, “Why is it three years? In three years’ time, the variables are too great!”

Qin Shao was unhappy in his heart, but in front of Qin Nantian, he still did not dare to be insolent and could only patiently say: “Agreeing to a life-and-death battle must be of both parties’ own accord! He is currently only middle-stage Grotto Profound. Immediately undergoing a life-and-death battle can only be delivering himself to death. He won’t agree to it.”

Qin Nantian frowned and said, “Three years ... Could it be that his strength is able to advance by leaps and bounds in these three years and reach an extent where he can contend with you?”

Qin Shao’s strength, he was very clear. It was rare to have rivals among those in the same generation!

Ye Yuan’s performance, they had also all learned about it. In combat strength, he was absolutely far inferior to Qin Shao.

Qin Shao was two minor realms higher than him. Furthermore, his concepts comprehensions were extremely high.

This was virtually an insurmountable gap in Deity Realm.

Three years’ time was merely a snap of a finger to Deity Realm powerhouses. What could Ye Yuan do?

Qin Shao thought about it and said, “I guess that he should be comprehending a kind of martial technique. He’s confident in successfully comprehending it within three years, this should be his reliance!”

Qin Nantian fell into contemplation. Suddenly, he said, “Then, do you have assurance in killing him after three years?”

Qin Shao said with a firm gaze, “Family Head, rest assured. These three years, Qin Shao will definitely go all out and assault the Sword Tomb’s fourth level! After three years, I’ll definitely cut him down beneath my sword!”

Qin Nantian nodded his head and said to Qin Shao, “Good. If you need any resources in these three years, feel free to ask from the family! But this battle must be won!”

Qin Shao cupped his fists and said, “Yes, Family Head!”

“Alright, go back home and take a look at your parents!” Qin Nantian waved his hands and let Qin Shao leave.

After Qin Shao left, Qin Nantian said to Qin Tian, “In your view, how great are Qin Shao’s chances of winning?”

Qin Tian said, “If it were others, with Younger Brother Shao’s strength, there’s no suspense at all. But if the opponent is Ye Yuan, his chances of winning will probably be discounted.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Nantian’s face fell, and he said, “How so?”

Qin Tian smiled and said, “Father. There is no need to worry. With Younger Brother Shao’s strength, as long as he can pass through the fourth level within three years, the chances of victory are at least above 80%! I’m worried about that Ye Yuan, mainly because he’s somewhat unpredictable!”

Qin Nantian frowned and said, “You’re talking about the incident that happened in the Sword Tomb’s first level?”

Qin Tian said, “Yes! My view is the same as Younger Brother Shao’s. Ye Yuan should be comprehending some kind of powerful martial technique. For him to dare leap realms to challenge, it must be this as the reliance! It’s just that he probably never thought that Younger Brother Shao’s talent is also exceedingly outstanding. Three years’ time is sufficient to let him improve greatly. Presumably, Younger Brother Shao’s dread towards Ye Yuan is even deeper than mine. So these three years’ time, it shall be Younger Brother Shao’s three years of transformation!”

Only after hearing Qin Tian’s analysis did Qin Nantian’s expression ease up slightly.

Qin Shao’s personality, they were very clear with it. He was very eager to outdo others!

Under the stimulation of Ye Yuan’s three years agreement, Qin Shao might burst forth with potential that would make everyone give a sidelong glance.

Even if Qin Shao’s talent was inferior to Ye Yuan’s, a mere three year’s time, he absolutely would not be pulled apart too much!

After all, Qin Shao was two minor realms higher than Ye Yuan.

This disparity was absolutely not what three year’s time could make up for!

...

In Wu Meng Academy, Ye Yuan and Qin Shao’s three years agreement already spread out like the wind.

When Xie Jingyi heard this news, he went to find Ye Yuan straight away.

“Ye Yuan, did you make a mistake? You clearly know that Qin Shao is this season’s top dog, you still dare to agree to his life and death battle?” Xie Jingyi said in exasperation upon seeing Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I dared to agree naturally because I have some assurance.”

“Some? Are you soft in the head?” Xie Jingyi said angrily.

“Huhu, just as Qin Shao said, if I want to rise up, I must get past him, this hurdle! Furthermore, I’ve already not experienced such a battle for very long! His challenge makes me seethe with fighting intent!” Ye Yuan said excitedly.

Ever since coming to the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan had always shown people an image of a weakling.

On his side, he always needed other people’s protection.

These several dozen years’ time, Ye Yuan virtually had not fought before in the real sense.

Now, he comprehended an extremely profound cultivation method and was also currently comprehending an extremely powerful martial technique.

Qin Shao’s arranged battle ignited Ye Yuan’s desire to fight!

“But you can’t treat your own life as a joke too! If you want to fight, why must you find Qin Shao? He is about to pass the second level right away in the Sword Tomb! Three years later, his strength will reach no idea what realm!” Xie Jingyi said in anger and disappointment.

Ye Yuan looked at Xie Jingyi and said with a smile, “You fatty, still have the mind to worry about me? If I didn’t guess wrongly, your family probably already took some action, right?”

Xie Jingyi’s expression involuntarily choked up, and he said embarrassedly, “How ... How did you know? The ... The family already cut off all of my resources! These bunch of fellows, really outrageous!”

“Still need to guess this? You poked such a large hole, so it’s already pretty good that they didn’t expel you from the family! However ... you have to be careful of that third uncle of yours!” Ye Yuan said.

Xie Jingyi choked up and said, “Third Uncle? He ... He shouldn’t have ill-intentions, right? On that day, the reason he did so should also just be because he wanted to save me.”

Ye Yuan said, “It’s always right to be more careful! There are 5 million low-grade divine essence stones in here, you take it and use first. Come find me again when it’s not enough.”

Little Fatty chuckled and said, “Then Lord Fatty, I, won’t be courteous. I know that you’re back by the Myriad Treasure Tower and are a rich man! Today, I’ll live off you, this magnate.”

Seeing Little Fatty’s greedy appearance, Ye Yuan’s expression could not help choking up.

This punk was also too discourteous.

...

From then on, there were two more lunatics in the Sword Tomb.

One self-abused crazily, one trained in the sword crazily!

The second time entering the Sword Tomb after the three years agreement, Qin Shao made it past the second level and entered the third level!

And Ye Yuan’s cultivation also entered a crazy mode.

Each time he entered the Sword Tomb, he would be covered all over in cuts and bruises before he was willing to come out.

In contrast, Qin Shao’s Sword Dao laws were also soaring rapidly.

Ye Yuan was still the same as before, making himself a mass of bruises and wounds each time before exiting the Sword Tomb.

Then recuperating for a few days and entering again, rinse and repeat like this.

The sword art failed to be completed for a long time, but Ye Yuan was not in a hurry.

He was waiting!

Waiting for the day where water flowed when a channel was formed!

Being tortured for so long, an elementary form already gradually formed in Ye Yuan’s mind.

One day, during the second year, Ye Yuan sat down in the second level again and slowly pulled out a sword.
