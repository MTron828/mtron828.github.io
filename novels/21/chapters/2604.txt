Chapter 2610: A Rare Opponent to Encounter in One’s Lifetime!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Two streaks of sword light and five lotus seeds, they erupted with extremely violent rumbling sounds from time to time.

Sword light intersected; the five elements rotated. Ye Yuan was locked in a struggle with Han Yi.

By the side, everyone was dumbfounded with amazement.

A transformation powerhouse said in surprise, “F*cking hell, this boy’s Great Dao Transformation has already reached the acme of perfection, still entering the Land of Exile to train my ass! This guy came in purely to abuse people, right?”

No one thought that Ye Yuan’s combat power would actually be so fearsome!

Chief Holy Lord Han Yi rarely took action, but they knew about Second Holy Lord and Third Holy Lord.

The power of three laws when compared to Ye Yuan was simply heaven and earth.

Whatever 30 moves, it seemed to be a complete joke now!

Ye Yuan did not fall into a disadvantageous position in the slightest facing five laws with three laws!

Of course, Han Yi was not someone who was easy to deal with either.

The five elements rule started running, akin to a painting scroll of heaven and earth, with a majestic and grand atmosphere, with no weakness to exploit.

Even Ye Yuan could not find the method to crack it for some time too.

When Lin Tong heard this, he immediately retorted, “His Excellency didn’t comprehend Great Dao Transformation in the outside world. He just comprehended Great Dao Transformation three years ago in Resplendent Sun City.”

When the group of transformation powerhouses heard, their eyes immediately became wide-saucers.

“What?! T-Three years ago? You punk, you aren’t bragging, right? Just three years and he completely perfected his Great Dao Transformation?” That transformation powerhouse almost jumped up. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Something that people did in three years, they could not do it even in 30 years!

Furthermore, the completion of three laws transformation was not as easy as theirs!

Easily several hundred years was normal too.

But Ye Yuan only used three years?

Freaking hell, who to reason this out with?!

By the side, He Yunxiang’s mouth curled and he said, “Bragging??Huhu,?you probably don’t know that three years ago, His Excellency was still just an upper Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum! In these three years’ time, he probably still used a lot of time to increase his cultivation realm!”

“What? Upper Lesser Sublime Heaven?”

That transformation powerhouse’s voice got louder and louder, almost overshadowing Ye Yuan two people’s fighting sounds.

It could be seen how strong his shock currently was.

When He Yunxiang, he was actually also in mayhem in his heart.

Prior to this, he did not understand the world of transformation powerhouses.

He thought that upon entering transformation, one would be a top powerhouse.

Only all the way until Ye Yuan rampaged in all directions did he know that transformation was merely just learning the rudiments.

One law and three laws, the difference was too great.

Of course, three laws and five laws, the difference was likewise immense.

Furthermore, comprehending was one thing, perfecting was another thing altogether.

This process was extremely long, but Ye Yuan only used two years, maybe even less than two years’ time, and completed it!

Amidst the shock of the numerous transformation powerhouses, Ye Yuan two people’s battle also entered a white-hot stage.

The two people fought until they were locked in a struggle, truly evenly matched.

Ye Yuan’s Great Dao was perfected and had no weakness to exploit. But it was weak in that the time spent was short; hence, it was not as strong as Han Yi.

While Han Yi was strong, the five elements had not reached the realm of perfection.

He was still a hair’s breadth away from five elements consummation.

Most likely, it was also precisely because of this hair’s breadth distance, that he had been reluctant to ascend all along.

If the foundation was not solid, when he ascended to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, this shortcoming of imperfection would become more and more of a hindrance.

This was what he was not willing to see.

But at this time, he was forced to the limit by Ye Yuan!

Facing Ye Yuan’s formidable Dao of Universe, Han Yi unleashed all of his abilities.

He could not slack off in the slightest!

A moment of carelessness and he would be defeated!

He had become the chief holy lord for so many years, and yet it was still his first time encountering such a formidable opponent.

Invincible was always the loneliest.

These few years, he yearned for an opponent too.

But sadly, there was none!

The realm that he had reached was too high.

In reality, the second holy lord and third holy lord below him had already changed one batch after another.

But he stood steadfast.

Because those people’s potential had already been exhausted. There was already no need to cultivate anymore.

But he was not!

He knew that he could perfect his five elements transformation even further and greatly improve his strength.

But sadly, he was lacking an opportunity!

All the way until today, he discovered that this opportunity finally came!

Ye Yuan was simply the gift that Heaven gave him!

Under Ye Yuan’s frenzied battle, his five elements rule that had already not moved for hundreds of years finally showed signs of loosening!

This discovery made him wildly ecstatic.

Did he not want to ascend?

Of course, he wanted to!

Who would willingly be just a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum all their lives?

But he was reluctant to submit!

Not perfecting the five elements, he would leave behind regrets in the Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum realm.

This regret would be magnified more and more along with the increase in cultivation realm.

Bang, bang, bang?…

In a flash, the two people had exchanged blows no idea how many times.

That ever-changing application of rule, the bedazzling fighting techniques, all these made the onlookers see things in a blur.

Boom!

No idea how long had passed either, after the two people had a violent clash, they each stopped.

Ye Yuan and Han Yi were both panting heavily at this time, their auras chaotic, almost collapsing.

Clearly, the two of them had unleashed their abilities to the limit.

Then, it fell into a death-like silence on the Holy Mountain. Only the two people’s panting sounds were reverberating.

These two people looked at each other just like that.

“Hahaha?…”

Suddenly, the two people started laughing loudly at the same time.

Ye Yuan said, “Didn’t you say 30 moves? Now, it’s been more than 3000 moves, right?”

Han Yi laughed loudly and said, “Alright, I admit that I postured too much! You are an opponent bestowed upon me by Heaven!”

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “Likewise! Your five elements aren’t at the level of perfection and are precisely in need of tempering. No wonder you refused to ascend! If it were me, I wouldn’t be willing either!”

Han Yi disregarded his image and plopped his bottom onto the ground and said, “No choice. My power of rules reached a bottleneck, and I haven’t been able to break through all along. I can only live a life of being a local despot here.”

Ye Yuan also sat down on the ground and said smilingly, “So, you made a Holy Mountain to posture; so it’s in order to wait for an opponent?”

Han Yi nodded and said, “That’s right. But there are far too few people capable of five laws transformation, I’ve never been able to wait for an opponent that I want! Seeing that you were three laws transformation, I was disappointed in my heart.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “In the end, I didn’t disappoint you, right?”

Han Yi laughed and said, “Disappoint??Haha,?every pore on my body is being ignited right now!?Oh,?right, still don’t know your name, Brother!”

“Ye Yuan!”

“Okay, Ye Yuan, ten days later, fight again here!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Just so!”

Finished saying, Han Yi got to his feet and went straight up the mountain.

After Ye Yuan got up, he removed the poison formation, and walked down the mountain.

Everyone had baffled looks, these two people fought and became friends?

“Could this be the legendary, friends are made after a fight?”

“No, wait! It should be a hero valuing another hero! They really met their match!”

“These two people are both of peerless aptitudes; their strength is evenly-matched. Such an opponent is hard to come across in ten thousand years!”

… …

Many people gave birth to vicissitudes of emotion in their hearts.

It was hard to meet a confidant in life, but it was even harder to meet an opponent in life!

The logic of an expert being lonely, this was not what most people had the qualifications to experience.

These two people finally found their match!
