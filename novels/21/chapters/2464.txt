Chapter 2470: Stuffed to Death!

“Tsk tsk,?what a delicious divine soul! Simply perfect! Gobbling you up, my strength will likely tower above Dao Ancestors!?Hahaha?… What a surprise!”

Lastingjoy felt that his divine soul was growing at a terrifying speed.

This sort of growth, even he himself felt afraid!

That vigorous and powerful soul force made him extremely intoxicated.

He had devoured countless Great Daos and countless divine souls in his life. However, not once did it feel as good as it did now.

Ye Yuan’s body was completely controlled by that black hand, unable to move a muscle.

Lastingjoy’s Great Dao was too bizarre!

Ye Yuan was frozen there, also secretly panicking in his heart.

Even when facing the refinement of the Eight Extreme Divinities, he was also not so powerless.

His chaos origin divinity became more and more illusory, and increasingly dim.

That enormous disc was like a water pump, extracting his soul force crazily.

“Huhu,?all of you did not expect that in the end, it was actually me who had the last laugh, right?”

“After I absorb your divine soul and corroborate my Great Dao, everyone will submit under my feet!”

“Hahaha?… so what if Dao Ancestor? So what if Tian Qing? I want them to become my dogs!”

“After enduring patiently for billions of years, I can finally roam this world unhindered in broad daylight!”

… …

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy indulged in self-delusion as if already seeing the delight of climbing to the summit of life.

During the past billions of years of forbearance, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy had long already suppressed his desire to the extreme.

Now, he attained Dao in one day. This desire erupted crazily.

In Cloudheart Realm, many people treated him as air.

Many people thought that Heavenly Emperor Distantbook was Medicine Ancestor’s successor.

But only he knew that no one could surpass Medicine Ancestor!

This guy absolutely would not allow others to surpass him.

From billions of years ago, when he was serving Medicine Ancestor as a servant, he already understood it.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was actually very smart. It was just that in order to not let Medicine Ancestor perceive it, he buried everything.

Medicine Ancestor was hoodwinked by him for billions of years before finally being devoured by him.

On his deathbed, Medicine Ancestor also did not dare to believe that this loyal and honest disciple actually killed him.

Obtaining Medicine Ancestor’s soul and Dao, Lastingjoy’s strength had a qualitative leap.

It was also precisely because of this that he had this confidence to come and deal with Ye Yuan.

And Ye Yuan’s divine soul was even more delicious than he imagined.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy let out a burst of wild laughter. But suddenly, his expression changed abruptly.

Rumble?…

The black wheel disc actually started to tremble violently.

At first, it was just a slight tremor.

But very soon, the shaking became more and more intense.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s expression changed wildly and he said, “This … What’s going on?”

Crack?…?Crack, crack?…

As if answering his question, cracks actually started appearing on the black disc.

Ye Yuan’s gaze also gradually became bright.

“Huhu,?my divine soul is called chaos origin divinity! Even Tian Qing doesn’t recognize it, showing that my chaos origin divinity is probably not what this world should have! You used this world’s Great Dao to absorb the chaos origin divinity that doesn’t belong to this world. It would be weird if it can bear it!” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

He came to understand very quickly where the problem lay.

The might of the chaos origin divinity was completely not what Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was able to understand.

His Dao of Devouring was indeed formidable. It was even not much worse than the chaos origin divinity.

Except, that was just in terms of quantity.

In terms of quality, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was much worse when compared to the chaos origin divinity!

Putting it bluntly, the soul force that the black wheel disc absorbed already far surpassed the limit that he could bear!

The black disc was stuffed to death!

The Great Dao was about to collapse!

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s heart shook wildly. He was stunned by Ye Yuan’s words.

Chaos origin divinity!

Not belonging to this world!

If id did not belong to this world, then why would it appear in this world?

However, he did not have time to puzzle over this anymore.

The cracks on the black wheel grew larger and larger, practically almost collapsing.

But right then, his expression changed wildly.

An even more turbulent soul force than before poured into the black wheel.

Rumble?…

The cracks on the black wheel became more and more, and increasingly larger.

It turned out that Ye Yuan acted in a diametrically opposite way, injecting his soul force into the black wheel crazily.

This was equivalent to quenching thirst with a poison; making matters worse.

“Damn it! You … What do you want to do? Stop for me!”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy roared angrily, wanting to cut off the absorption of Ye Yuan’s divine soul.

However, it was already too late.

That black hand was like a pipe.

Currently, the floodwaters from that end were too strong, he already could not shut the floodgates!

Ye Yuan’s soul force was too strong!

Ye Yuan was a little weak, but his soul force could still hold out for a while.

Seeing Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s appearance, he smiled and said, “Didn’t you want to devour me? Then I’ll let you devour until it’s enough!”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy finally panicked. The black wheel’s collapse was near at hand, how could he still care about absorbing soul force?

“I … I was wrong! Lord Saint Azure, I’ll return all of the soul force! I … I beg you, please stop!” Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was practically crying.

Honestly, played with eagles for a lifetime, in the end, got his eye pecked by an eagle!

It was just that how could he have thought that Ye Yuan’s divine soul was actually so strong?

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “Although Medicine Ancestor was obnoxious, he also wouldn’t make people feel like vomiting like you! Someone who betrays their master and forefathers, everyone has the right to punish the person! It’s too late to beg for mercy now!”

Ye Yuan ignored Lastingjoy’s tearful complaints and instead, injected soul force even more crazily.

Boom!

Finally, the black wheel could not hold on anymore, directly crumbling apart!

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy spurted a mouthful of blood wildly, his entire person akin to being struck by lightning, falling down.

This black wheel was closely linked to his divine soul. Now that the wheel disc collapsed, it was equivalent to his Great Dao collapsing.

His divine soul similarly suffered a devastating blow too!

The current Ye Yuan also finally heaved a sigh in relief.

This time, he really had a narrow escape from death.

He also never dreamed that there was actually still an existence that could pose a threat to him in this Heavenspan World.

But right at this time, an abnormality occurred again!

That soul force originally belonged to Ye Yuan. Now that the black wheel disc crumbled, the soul force actually started flowing in reverse, pouring into Ye Yuan’s divine soul body crazily.

But among these inverse-flows, it was far from as pure as his soul force anymore.

One scene after another appeared before Ye Yuan’s eyes.

Inside Ye Yuan’s mind, countless pieces of information crisscrossed.

Fortunately, his chaos origin divinity was incomparably powerful and was completely able to digest this information.

These scenes were precisely those lives that Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy devoured.

Ye Yuan even saw Medicine Ancestor’s memories among them.

These memories were nothing to Ye Yuan.

But then these people’s Great Dao fragments poured into Ye Yuan’s divine soul in a rush.

Ye Yuan’s eyes became brighter and brighter. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

These things were priceless treasures!

Those able to get devoured by Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy were all some genius characters. Each person had their own unique views on Alchemy Dao.

This was equivalent to delivering a treasure vault into Ye Yuan’s divine soul!
