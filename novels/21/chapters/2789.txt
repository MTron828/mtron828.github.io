Chapter 2795: Chain Reaction

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Yuan, promise Lord Hollowdark!?Tsk tsk,?it’s our honor to be able to become a war general under a True Sovereign Heaven!” Yang Qing urged very shamelessly.

Huhu, lapdog!

This guy changed loyalties really quickly!

“Sorry, this Ye has no interest in staying in the sea race,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Sovereign Hollowdark’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Kid, are you not giving face to this sovereign?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Yes!”

The moment these words came out, everyone was shocked!

This guy was tired of living!

Yang Qing looked at Ye Yuan in astonishment and said, “Brother Ye, this Yang candidly admits defeat! I acknowledge defeat!”

He felt that he was domineering enough already.

But he was not even a fart in front of Ye Yuan!

This guy puffed himself up at his own cost.

While him, he was domineering when he should be domineering, and he pretended to be subservient when it was time to pretend to be subservient!

How much money was face worth?

But Ye Yuan was different. This guy dared to posture in front of a True Sovereign Heaven too!

This was using his life to posture!

“Hahaha?… Hollowdark, you got snubbed despite showing good intentions! He doesn’t buy it at all!” When Qian Kui heard that, he said with a loud laugh.

Just now, Hollowdark made him get deflated. In the end, Ye Yuan gave Hollowdark a backhanded slap, making him feel great.

Hollowdark’s face was as black as it could be, and he said in a cold voice, “Boy, you’re very good! To dare reject this sovereign, you’re really the first!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then this Ye is really honored!”

Hollowdark was speechless.

Yang Qing gave Ye Yuan a big thumbs up.

Impressive!

Really awesome!

Did he find that he was not dying fast enough?

Sure enough, Hollowdark’s aura got colder and colder, and he said in a low voice, “Brat, to dare provoke this sovereign, you’re really seeking death!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said smilingly, “I feel that you all had best not kill me. Otherwise … something will happen.”

Hollowdark sneered when he heard that and said, “What can happen from killing an ant?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “A very, very big thing! Everyone present might die!”

Everyone was speechless. They were thinking to themselves; was it possible that this guy had lost his mind?

At present, there were countless powerhouses above the surface of the sea!

Putting the four great True Sovereign Heavens aside, the four great sea regions’ general level experts had practically all arrived, numbering no less than 15 people!

Ordinary grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens even reached a terrifying 50 over people!

As for the other Saint Sovereign Heavens and numerous underlings, there were too many to count.

In this kind of situation, even if a True Sovereign Heaven was here, they would have to die with regrets too!

You, a measly little lower Saint Sovereign Heaven, was already impressive to such an extent?

“Huhu,?very good! This sovereign wants to see today how everyone present dies!” Hollowdark laughed from fury.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and asked instead, “Really want to try?”

Hollowdark snorted coldly and said, “I really want to try!”

Done talking, he raised his hand and directly smacked a hand toward Ye Yuan without the slightest hesitation.

A True Sovereign Heaven making a move, that was simply the might of Heavenly Dao!

The moment the palm was raised, heaven and earth changed colors!

Each and every one of the powerhouses present marveled endlessly.

At the same time, they also marveled at Ye Yuan’s stupidity.

Provoking a True Sovereign Heaven, this guy was absolutely a fool!

However, Ye Yuan clearly would not resign himself to death.

In the instant that Hollowdark raised his hand, Ye Yuan’s figure instantly disappeared from where he originally was!

A hint of surprise appeared in Qian Kui’s eyes.

Yes, this kid was actually rushing towards him!

Did he feel that he would not kill him?

Smacking a Saint Sovereign Heaven to death was about the same as smacking an ant to death.

Whatever divergent cultivator, whatever genius, no matter how monstrous your prowess, you were also not a match for my one palm.

“Humph!?Want to die under this sovereign’s hands? Forget it. I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Sovereign Qian Kui raised his palm too and was prepared to smack Ye Yuan to death.

But, right at this time, his expression changed wildly!

Because Ye Yuan broke through at this time!

Because of Ye Yuan’s breakthrough, Sovereign Qian Kui’s true sovereign Dao tribulation arrived ahead of schedule!

Rumble?… Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Above the sky, dark clouds rolled.

Almost instantly, the air pressure dropped to the point where it was impossible to breathe.

Ye Yuan’s power alone was naturally unable to call down such a terrifying Dao tribulation.

But, he and Sovereign Qian Kui two people, their Dao tribulations would be frightening!

His confidence was also precisely related to this!

Originally, when Sovereign Qian Kui descended, Ye Yuan felt worried too.

But, when he revealed his true body, Ye Yuan suddenly had a trace of feeling in his heart!

A feeling regarding Dao tribulation!

After Ye Yuan became a divergent cultivator, he became much more sensitive to Heavenly Dao than ordinary people.

He sensed that Sovereign Qian Kui’s Dao tribulation seemed to somewhat respond to and cooperate with his own.

Ye Yuan understood in his heart that this was the interaction between Dao tribulations!

Once he chose to break through, Heavenly Dao would definitely bring down Dao tribulation!

The so-called divergent cultivator was going against heaven.

Ye Yuan’s breakthrough would definitely bring down Dao tribulation.

Ye Yuan was at peak lower Saint Sovereign Heaven to begin with. Fighting bitterly at sea these few days, his realm almost could not be suppressed anymore.

So that was why previously, he would call out: I’m going to transcend tribulation, this sort of words.

And his Dao tribulation was not an ordinary Dao tribulation.

Judging from past experiences, it would likely be at least five-nine Dao tribulation.

Above the sky, the wind and clouds were surging. It was more terrifying than any of Ye Yuan’s previous tribulations.

Sovereign Qian Kui’s expression changed wildly, and he said with horror in his heart, “How can this be? Why would the true sovereign Dao tribulation this time be so terrifying?”

He felt it. The true sovereign Dao tribulation this time was much stronger than he anticipated!

He looked towards Ye Yuan in astonishment, knowing where the problem lay.

“Motherfucker, just what kind of freak is this boy, to actually incur such jealousy from heaven? I was … brought in by him?” Sovereign Qian Kui gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Once the true sovereign Dao tribulation started, it could no longer be stopped!

Ye Yuan had long anticipated it and said with a loud laugh, “No need to thank me. I said before not to kill me, you guys didn’t listen …”

And right at this time, the pressure above the sky suddenly doubled!

Sovereign Hollowdark’s expression changed wildly, and he said, “My … My true sovereign Dao tribulation arrived as well?”

His voice had yet to fade when the Dao tribulation above the void increased several times again!

The sea level became turbulent at this time!

The sea was even pressed into a concave shape by this pressure.

It could be seen how terrifying this Dao tribulation was!

“Freaking hell, my True Sovereign Dao Tribulation came too!” Sardine said exasperatedly.

“Mine came as well!” While Tian Hui smiled bitterly.

“Mine arrived too! What the hell! Your Father just overcame the saint sovereign Dao tribulation ten years ago!” A Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse let loose a torrent of abuse.

“Yours was ten years. Your Father just overcame the tribulation last year!”

… …

At this time, the powerhouses at Saint Sovereign Heaven and above were all hurling all kinds of profanities.

Because each and every one of them felt their Dao tribulations were coming.

Some had even just transcended their tribulations a few months ago.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he was stunned too.

Was this … a chain reaction?

Not to such an extent, right?

So, the hundreds of powerhouses present were going to transcend tribulation collectively?

“Goodness gracious, my saint sovereign Dao tribulation arrived too! I just succeeded in transcending my tribulation before setting out to sea! Ye Yuan you heaven-damned, you’re killing me!” Yang Qing also let loose a torrent of abuse.. He failed to avoid it too.
