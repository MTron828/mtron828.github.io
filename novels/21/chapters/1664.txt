Chapter 1668 Getting Shot Even When Lying Down

“Bai Qing, before coming out, Master repeatedly exhorted us to keep a lower profile! Geniuses are plentiful like clouds at the Heavenspan Mountain. There are also quite a number stronger than us. Take heed not to be arrogant and complacent. Have you forgotten all of it?”

Leng Qiuling’s brows were slightly furrowed, clearly somewhat displeased with Bai Qing.

When Bai Qing saw Leng Qiuling get angry, he said respectfully, “Bai Qing knows his mistake! But each time we come to the Heavenspan Mountain, there are always some hillbillies who overestimate their ability. It really puts me in a bad mood seeing them. You told him the pros and cons, right? He still didn’t appreciate it, truly courting death.”

Leng Qiuling said, “Everyone in the world has a heart that leans toward the Dao. Other people’s lives are other people’s. If he isn’t willing, forget it, no need to force it. He and we are not people in the same world to begin with.”

Bai Qing smiled and said, “Heh heh, Senior Apprentice Sister’s words are reasonable. That kid just now couldn’t even break through to the Divine Lord Realm for 300 years. His potential has probably been exhausted already, so it will be like this for this lifetime. Yet, he still doesn’t give up and comes to the Heavenspan Mountain to seek death.”

Leng Qiuling did not speak. Clearly, she also agreed with Bai Qing’s words.

“Alright, don’t delay anymore. We have to hurry to Southfoot Town before dark,” Leng Qiuling said.

...

In the evening, Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping walked into Southfoot Town.

Southfoot Town was at the foot of the Heavenspan Mountain.

The Heavenspan Mountain was God knows how many tens of thousands of miles tall and how many tens of thousands of miles in circumference.

The Heavenspan Mountain could not be climbed as and when someone wanted to. Every other year, the Heavenspan Mountain would form passageways leading straight up the mountain.

Martial artists must pass through these passageways before they could ascend the Heavenspan Mountain. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Going up from other places would be directly blotted out by Heavenly Dao, no matter how powerful your strength was.

Therefore, the foot of the Heavenspan Mountain formed one small town after another. Firstly, it was to provide a resting place for martial artists. Secondly, it was also in order to manage these martial artists and not let them cause trouble.

This place was the closest place to heaven. Getting into a fight would ruffle Heavenly Dao, sending down heavenly punishment, sparing not even chickens or dogs.

According to legend, there had once been a martial artist who got into a fight in order to vie for the qualification to scale the ladder to heaven.

In the end, heavenly punishment descended, wiping out all of that batch of martial artists.

At the foot of the mountain, there were numerous such small towns. But the towns where each major realm belonged to were separate. Because the passageways where they entered the Heavenspan Mountain were different.

This Southfoot Town only had Divine Lord Realm powerhouses.

“Hahaha, Junior Sister Leng, we’re really connected by heart, to actually meet here.”

“Zhuo Han, who’s connected by heart with you? Stay further away from me!”

“Junior Sister Leng, don’t keep people a thousand miles away like this! Don’t be like this, this place is Southfoot Town, you can’t attack others!”

“Get lost!”

...

The moment he entered, Ye Yuan heard a guy and a girl arguing.

One of them was that Leng Qiuling.

The other was a man called Zhuo Han. His strength was similar to Leng Qiuling. He had the appearance of a sticky candy, pestering Leng Qiuling endlessly and not letting go.

Ye Yuan gave a glance and did not have the intention of going to provoke, walking straight towards a large hall in the center of the town.

Leng Qiuling was currently irritated. Suddenly seeing Ye Yuan, she quickly walked over to stop Ye Yuan and said coldly, “You still came in the end!”

Ye Yuan gave her a glance, nodded, and said with a smile, “I said it before, I have a reason to be bent on coming.”

Leng Qiuling let out a sigh and said, “You aren’t familiar with this place, right? Come, I’ll bring you to go and collect the number plate!”

Ye Yuan was just about to reject but saw the pleading look that Leng Qiuling cast.

Ye Yuan understood in his heart. This was using him as cannon fodder.

He also did not expect that this iceberg beauty would actually condescend to beg him.

A beauty begging, it was naturally hard for Ye Yuan to refuse.

Moreover, along the way previously, Ye Yuan could also feel this iceberg beauty’s good intentions.

Therefore, he changed his mind and said with a smile, “Then I’ll have to trouble Fairy[1].”

At this time, Zhuo Han came to the side, looked at Ye Yuan full of killing intent, and said coldly, “Another Origin Deity Realm who came to court death! Junior Sister Leng, are you deliberately finding this kind of trash to spite me? It’s useless!”

While he said that it was useless verbally, Zhuo Han already put Ye Yuan in the list of must-kills.

Leng Qiuling was just about to speak, but Ye Yuan said, “Liking Fairy Leng, one can’t use this kind of endlessly pestering method. Like this, you’ll only make her dislike you more and more!”

Zhuo Han’s gaze turned cold and he said, “What this young master does isn’t your turn, an Origin Deity Realm trash’s turn, to come and teach!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and could not help laughing. He said to Leng Qiuling, “Fairy Leng, this kind of condescending fool, better stay further away from him, save that he defiles your eyes.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought Leng Qiuling and was about to leave.

Zhuo Han’s gaze turned cold, blocked right in front, and said coldly, “Kid, you try saying it one more time!”

The powerful pressure of ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord instantly crushed over toward Ye Yuan.

With a difference of a major realm, the pressure of ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord was sufficient to make Ye Yuan seriously injured and vomit blood.

Leng Qiuling was caught by surprise too, not expecting that Zhuo Han would attack at the drop of a hat.

But when she turned to look, she discovered that Ye Yuan was perfectly fine and said coolly, “Don’t make a spectacle of yourself anymore. Do you dare to attack here? Don’t think that ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord is very powerful. Because I discovered that saying that you’re a fool is somewhat praising you. Get lost!”

Suddenly, two iron-armored people came out from no idea where, with the auras on their bodies very horrifying.

One of them said coldly, “Troublemakers, kill without amnesty!”

Those two people’s entire faces were covered in the suit of armor. But that deep and gloomy gaze made Zhuo Han feel akin to falling into an ice cellar, his body instantly drenched in sweat.

The two people’s bodies emitted a horrifying aura, even Leng Qiuling’s complexion turned slightly pale too.

Zhuo Han forced a smile and said, “I ... I just wanted to scare him, d-didn’t want to really attack.”

The armored person said coldly, “Warning once. If the offense is repeated, kill without amnesty!”

Finished talking, the armored person’s gaze stopped on Ye Yuan for a moment, then turned around and left.

Leng Qiuling similarly used an astonished gaze to look at Ye Yuan. She did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually completely unmoved under the pressure of a ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

This was not the most important thing, the most important thing was that under those two armored people’s powerful auras, Ye Yuan could still maintain his composure!

Those two armored people’s strengths were at least Celestial Deity Realm too. Ye Yuan was actually completely fine.

Ye Yuan gave Zhuo Han a glance and said disdainfully, “Idiot! Fairy Leng, let’s go.”

Leng Qiuling nodded and left with Ye Yuan.

Looking at the two people’s distant back views, Zhuo Han said in a cold voice, “Punk, when we leave Southfoot Town, I’ll definitely make you die very horribly!”

...

“Just now, thank you very much!” Even Leng Qiuling’s thanks seemed a little cold.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Fairy Leng is too courteous.”

Leng Qiuling said, “Seems like I dragged you into the water. With Zhuo Han’s personality of seeking revenge for the smallest grievance, he probably would not let you go so easily.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Since I dared to promise Fairy Leng, I’m naturally not afraid of him.

An Origin Deity Realm saying this kind of words sounded somewhat comical.

She felt that Ye Yuan had a feeling of knowing what to do, but she did not know why.
