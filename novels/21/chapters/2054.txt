Chapter 2058: The Opponent is Too Strong!

“What? You ... You want to terminate the contract?”

Ding Xiao’s expression changed, somewhat doubting whether he heard wrongly or not.

Terminating the contract was nothing to the Cloudpill Establishment. But to the Su Family and Ren Family, it was a big problem.

Family Head Su smiled and said, “Don’t say it so unpleasantly. This Su went back and discussed with the family clan’s elders and felt that the medicinal pills we ordered at our Cloudpill Establishment are too many. So ...”

How astute was Ding Xiao? He immediately realized that something was not right.

Could it be that these two great families were pulled over by the Myriad Treasure Tower opposite?

But just what kind of conditions did the other party give, to be able to make these two great families terminate the contract at the risk of offending the entire Southern Border Alliance?

The reason why the Southern Border Alliance was powerful was because they formed an entity.

Bound together for good or bad.

If any faction dared to offend them, they could completely force them out and not provide medicinal pills for them.

This kind of outcome, even for a powerful city like Longwind Great Imperial Capital, it was also too much to bear.

Ding Xiao’s two eyes narrowed slightly and his tone became cold as he said, “Family Head Su, Family Head Ren, do you know what the consequences of terminating the contract is? The consequences of offending our Southern Border Alliance isn’t what you guys can bear!”

The warning hint of these words was already very thick.

Family Head Su’s face changed, but Family Head Ren did not have that great of a temper. Snorting coldly, he said, “Offend, then offend. What’s the big deal? It’s already enough for our Ren Family to cooperate with the Myriad Treasure Tower! Previously, we were bewitched by you. That’s how we lost the initiative. This Ren hasn’t even settled the score with you yet!”

The moment these words came out, the faces of Ding Xiao and the group of shopkeepers changed greatly.

A measly little Ren Family really had the confidence to lose all decorum with the Southern Border Alliance?

Who gave him the confidence?

The Myriad Treasure Tower?

On what basis?!

When Family Head Su saw that Family Head Ren left no room to salvage things, he let out a sigh and said, “Shopkeeper Ding, truly sorry about it. To choose the lesser of two evils, my Su Family seriously can’t continue the cooperation with you. Your medicinal pills are simply garbage compared to the Myriad Treasure Tower! Farewell!”

Finished talking, Family Head Su cupped his fists and directly left.

Family Head Ren naturally would not stay either, following Family Head Su and leaving the Cloudpill Establishment.

Ding Xiao stood there, his expression gloomy and erratic.

Garbage?

Several dozen factions, gathered the most elite alchemists, the medicinal pills refined were actually called garbage?

Ding Xiao was unable to accept this fact. He wished to rush up and tear Family Head Su’s mouth into pieces.

Would he believe this kind of lousy reason?

“This ... Just what’s going on here? What in the world did the Myriad Treasure Tower do?” Shopkeeper Ling lost his previous composure long ago, astonishment on his face.

The others also had panic looks. Clearly, they were completely mentally unprepared about this sudden change.

Who could have thought that their three months of hard work, the Myriad Treasure Tower only used one morning and completely overturned the situation?

However, these Su and Ren two families were just the beginning.

Following that, one batch after another of big and small family factions actually all came to pay a visit and terminate their contracts.

Not just Cloudpill Establishment, but also Tranquil Heart Pavilion, Purplecloud Establishment, and the rest; the orders that they previously negotiated practically all fell short of success at the last step now.

Continuously for an entire day, they spent it in the midst of being utterly exhausted from overwork.

It was only all the way until the evening, when a series of medicinal pills were presented in front of the shopkeepers did they know why Family Head Su called their medicinal pills garbage.

“These ... What are all these medicinal pills? Where did the Myriad Treasure Tower get the pill formulas? To actually be able to refine so many terrifying medicinal pills?” When Shopkeeper Lin was talking, his entire body was quivering.

He had galloped across the market all his life and had yet to encounter such a powerful enemy before.

The other party did not use any management methods at all and did not need any roping in or stomping at all, and completely did not need deliberate marketing.

Once the medicinal pills were out, all of the opponents were directly crushed!

This was absolute strength. It did not require that many flashy methods at all.

Just like an Empyrean powerhouse dealing with a True God Realm, what schemes or intrigues did they need to use?

One completely did not need such a thing!

Simply throwed a big slap over, directly pulverizing all of them!

“This should be the evolved version of the Buddha Jade Pill, right? This is the evolved version of the Chaos Origin One Breath Pill? ... My God! Virtually all of the common medicinal pills in the market all have evolved versions!”

A shopkeeper said with a bitter smile, “They ... They directly advanced medicinal pills by an era! Compared to these medicinal pills, ours are indeed rubbish!”

“This ... How to still compete? Even if we have several hundred parties teaming up, we’re also not the Myriad Treasure Tower’s match! This kind of opponent isn’t on the same level at all!”

The boundless enthusiasm from the morning was long gone without a trace already.

These shopkeepers all seemed to be like eggplants hit by frost, being unable to perk up at all.

Combining six great peak holy lands coupled with several dozen major factions, such a long period of meticulous planning, it was completely a joke!

Ding Xiao let out a slight sigh and said, “This matter is already not what we can influence. It’s better to leave it to the lords to go worry about it. Our opponent is too powerful!”

The current Ding Xiao had a feeling of all hopes being dashed to pieces.

He had sunk and risen all his life, and exchanged blows with countless powerful opponents before. It could be said to be emerging victorious in every battle.

But this time, he felt powerless.

Crossing swords with this kind of opponent, one did not have any chance at all.

He could feel that there was seemingly a giant shadow behind the Myriad Treasure Tower, manipulating this war.

That person was Ye Yuan, Grandmaster Ye!

In front of Grandmaster Ye, Ding Xiao felt like he was just like a child.

No matter how you fought with flashy moves, the other party did not take you seriously at all.

Although he said to leave it to the various lords verbally, actually, Ding Xiao understood in his heart that this war, the Southern Border Alliance already completely lost!

Even if it was the six great grandmasters joining hands, they were also unable to salvage this kind of declining trend.

Unless, they could join hands and take out a batch of even more advanced medicinal pills.

Except ... how was that possible?

Even if the Medicine Ancestor took action, he might not be able to do it too! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

...

One bad news after another flew to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital like scraps of paper.

“All of Longwind Great Imperial Capital’s Cloudpill Establishment’s medicinal pills cannot be sold and we are already unable to sustain our expenditure. Shopkeeper Ding requests to withdraw from Longwind Great Imperial Capital!”

“Ling Yun Great Imperial Capital’s Cloudpill Establishment has already gone bankrupt. Shopkeeper He requests to withdraw!”

“Autumn Day Great Imperial Capital’s Tranquil Heart Pavilion has already gone out of business. Shopkeeper Feng requests to withdraw!”

...

In the audience hall, Empyrean Pilljade’s expression was grim until it was virtually about to drip water.

Among these intel, many places were not the Myriad Treasure Tower’s territory, but the six great holy lands’ territory!

It was as if the Myriad Treasure Tower opened up throughout the entire Southern Border’s great imperial capitals overnight.

Furthermore, they only used an extremely short time and made the Southern Border Alliance crumble like crushing dead leaves.

The Myriad Treasure Tower’s new medicinal pills were too domineering!

As long as one was not a fool, they would definitely choose the Myriad Treasure Tower’s medicinal pills.

So what if prices rose?

Even if it rose 20% the price, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s medicinal pills cost-performance was still a great deal higher than ordinary medicinal pills!

This war already did not have suspense!
