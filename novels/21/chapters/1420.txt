1424 Divine Ruins

Ye Yuan’s finger shook. The hand that Bai Chen was grabbing the long spear with had been directly shaken off.

It was only to see the long spear turned lightly, twirling around. It was grasped by Ye Yuan’s hands.

“Although I haven’t extensively studied the Spear Dao before, the Great Dao is multifarious, all roads leading to the same goal. I’ll deploy one spear move. You watch closely!”

Ye Yuan’s voice had yet to fade when the aura on his body suddenly changed, suddenly stabbing a spear out.

Bai Chen’s gaze turned intent, staring fixedly at the heavy spear in Ye Yuan’s hands.

This spear was the exact same angle and strength of the spear he did just now. It was practically the reproduction of that spear earlier.

But the power of this spear was more than a hundred times stronger than his!

Boom!

Ye Yuan’s spear momentum abruptly ceased. The entire space produced an intense tremor.

The area where the spear tip stopped, the space actually produced fine cracks, then returned to normal very quickly.

Bai Chen’s expression was incomparably ugly as he said in disbelief, “How ... How can it be like this?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The way of the heavens, diminishes the excess and compensates for the shortage. The spear art’s heavy momentum, you must pay attention to that indomitable imposing momentum. However, it was easily broken just now. Your spear art has excessive toughness and inadequate gentleness. Although the might of a spear is fierce, once blocked by the enemy, you won’t have the strength to battle anymore. When you comprehend a trace of gentle force from the toughness and understand the logic of restrain, your imposing momentum shall continue unbroken, akin to a series of waves, advancing forth irresistibly!”

Bai Chen was still perplexed as he said, “But ... wouldn’t mixing gentle force in the spear art lose a portion of strength?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “You’re still staying at the realm of seeing the mountain as the mountain. In order to have the strength to continue fighting, forcefully pulling back a portion of the force, this is the true way! I’ll display it once more, you see if I held back power or not!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Bai Chen’s expression turned intent, retreating to one side, his eyes glued on Ye Yuan.

Still the same identical spear, Ye Yuan made a move again. That indomitable imposing momentum did not hold back in the slightest!

Bai Chen stared fixedly at the spear top, his body suddenly shuddered.

That spear move just now, Ye Yuan did not point out anything, leaving many details unspoken.

But this time, he saw it clearly!

Master clearly did not pull back the spear, but at the final juncture, the heavy spear’s speed seemed to slow down!

It was as if ... it was traversing space and time.

This feeling was indescribably bizarre.

Boom!

The space produced fine cracks once more.

What a terrifying spear!

Bai Chen was certain that even if Master’s realm was the same as his, using this spear, he could easily kill middle-stage Grotto Profound martial artists too!

“Understood it?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Bai Chen shook his head and said, “I ... I can’t do it!”

Ye Yuan was tickled the moment he heard it and said with a laugh, “If you can do it, what can I teach you? Carrying gentleness in toughness, carrying toughness in gentleness. A combination of toughness and gentleness, that’s the strongest attack! You need to remember that spear move just now in your head and practice hard. There will come a day where you’ll be able to understand.”

Bai Chen nodded his head solemnly and said, “Master, I got it! Thank you, Master, for your guidance!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly. He knew that Bai Chen really understood.

There was no shortcut to cultivation. Only by paying even more sweat than others could only gain even more.

But Ye Yuan pointed a direction for Bai Chen. It was like a lighthouse in the vast ocean, able to let Bai Chen take fewer detours.

Ye Yuan’s words sounded simple. But performing it required many, many years of bitter cultivation.

Bai Chen understood that his road was still very long.

However, Bai Chen’s talent was indeed very decent. It was no wonder that Bai Yehai chose him to be the young lord.

Given time, it was merely a matter of time for him to surpass those older brothers of his

“M-Master, are you looking for me for something?”

The two people came to a small pavilion by the side to rest. Bai Chen suddenly opened his mouth and asked.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “My identity, I believe you already know, right?”

Bai Chen’s expression changed and he pretended to be puzzled as he said, “Your identity? Aren’t you my master? White Night Sacred Palace’s grand elder?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You still want to play these little games in front of me? Those medicinal pills, if you don’t recognize those pills, could it be that Mo Yun can’t recognize them either?”

Bai Chen’s expression instantly became incomparably embarrassed. He did not expect that Ye Yuan had everything under control.

“Master, I ...”

Ye Yuan stopped Bai Chen from carrying on with a hand gesture. Suddenly, his expression turned stern and he said in a cold voice, “My objective of coming to the Sky Foothill World is very simple. It’s for the sake of the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone! For this, I’ll do whatever it takes!”

Bai Chen’s expression changed. That powerful aura of Ye Yuan’s crushed him until he virtually could not breathe.

“Master, the White Night Sacred Palace doesn’t have Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones!” Bai Chen said flusteredly.

Ye Yuan withdrew his aura and asked, “Could it be that Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are all controlled in the hands of the Sky Foothill Divine Palace?”

Bai Chen nodded his head slightly and said, “The Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone is immensely helpful toward the breakthrough of Deity Realm powerhouses. Even Origin Deity Realm powerhouses can’t do without it either! Therefore, the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are basically all controlled in the hands of the Sky Foothill Divine Palace. The Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones that flows out of the Sky Foothill Divine Palace are extremely, extremely few. It’s basically very hard to see in the outside world.”

Hearing this, Ye Yuan immediately felt his head swell.

Each day that he delayed, Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness would flow away a bit!

Originally thought that the White Night Sacred Palace, this kind of powerful faction, would have one or two pieces of Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones. But did not expect that this thing was actually rare to this sort of degree.

Bai Chen was very perplexed when he saw Ye Yuan’s sorrowful look and said cautiously, “M-Master ... a-according to what I know, don’t you all just need Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit, Purple Sand Gold, one of the three kinds will do?”

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “I’m not finding the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone in order to complete the mission, but it is for another purpose. It has a life-saving usage for me, so I have to obtain it at all costs!”

Bai Chen was slightly surprised, not expecting that it would actually be like this.

No wonder when Ye Yuan obtained the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit, he just sized it up slightly, then kept it.

It seemed like this master of his was also a person with a story!

“Not only did Master Ye Yuan save my life, he even gave me a new life! His kindness to me, I can’t repay finish even if I die ten times! The Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone must be very important to him. No matter what, I must help him obtain the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone!”

Without going through much mental struggle, Bai Chen made up his mind.

“Master, actually, if you want to obtain the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, there’s an opportunity. It’s just that ... still have to wait for 10 years!” Bai Chen said.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said, “You say!”

Bai Chen said, “After 10 years, the Sky Foothill Divine Palace will open up the Divine Ruins! The Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone is produced there! It’s just that ...”

Talking until here, Bai Chen hesitated for a moment. Ye Yuan immediately understood and said with a smile, “It’s just that that place is very dangerous, yes?”

Bai Chen nodded and said, “That’s right! Inside the Divine Ruins is full of opportunities, but it is also full of dangers! Furthermore, when the time comes, the Sky Foothill World’s seven great sacred palaces will all enter inside. It will be very perilous.”

Ye Yuan said without any care, “I’ve said it before, at all costs!”
