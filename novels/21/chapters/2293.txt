Chapter 2297: Request to Challenge Cloud Summer Mountain!

Zi Jin thought that Ye Yuan would fly into a rage, and then Ye Yuan would question him loudly.

But the result was unexpected.

Ye Yuan just nonchalantly said “understood,” then turned around and left.

“Heh, what Second Sage. Merely a wuss, he doesn’t even dare to let out a fart!” Leng Tianqi said with a disdainful look. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Zhao Zixuan also smiled and said, “No matter how formidable his Alchemy Dao, he’s also merely a brat! I reckon that he might be going back to cry to Sacred Ancestor High Priest right now.”

“Hahaha ...” Everyone guffawed with laughter.

“What kind of status does Sacred Ancestor High Priest have? How can he possibly forcibly stand up for this minor thing? This kid is still too young!” Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather also said disdainfully.

But Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin frowned slightly, kept on feeling that something was not quite right.

He did not understand much about Ye Yuan, but looking at Ye Yuan’s attitude towards Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather previously, he did not seem like someone who yielded so easily.

Just as he was musing, Zhao Zixuan and the rest came over to give thanks.

“Many thanks to Lord Zi Jin for your righteous actions, Zixuan is endlessly grateful!”

Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin smiled and said, “This emperor was just telling the truth. Zixun doesn’t have to be courteous.”

Zhao Zixuan said hatefully, “Second Sage is indeed a rare alchemy genius, but his behavior is a little too overbearing. Clearly was in the wrong, and he still wanted to force us to apologize, truly preposterous!”

Zi Jin nodded and said, “This matter, Second Sage was indeed in the wrong.”

Actually, they naturally knew in their hearts as well.

This matter was planned out by them in the first place. Zhao Zixuan also knew it in his heart.

Hence, no matter what, Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin also would not stand on Ye Yuan’s side.

Otherwise, wouldn’t he be slapping his own face?

This side was just discussing animatedly when a thunderous voice rolled over from a distance.

“Priest Temple’s Ye Yuan requests to challenge Cloud Summer Mountain!”

These 10 words could make the deaf hear and the blind see, echoing throughout the entire Cloudheart City.

Everyone trembled all over, immediately revealing looks of astonishment.

“What? Second Sage he ... is actually going to challenge the mountain! Cloud Summer Mountain, that’s where Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove is staying! This ... This is going to be a big trouble now!”

Everyone’s gazes all gathered on a youth in brocade beside Zhao Zixuan.

The youth in brocade was called Zhu Tianxiang, who was precisely Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove’s proud disciple!

“Challenging the mountain, this is a blatant face-slapping behavior! Is Second Sage planning on challenging a holy land by himself? Too crazy! Too crazy!”

“You’re wrong! Most likely, his goal isn’t just a Cloud Summer Mountain!”

“What?! You mean ...”

Everyone’s gazes looked over toward Zhao Zixuan five people once more.

Second Sage’s goal was not just a Cloud Summer Mountain, but it was to challenge the five great holy lands!

They guessed correctly!

Ye Yuan’s goal was precisely to challenge the five great holy lands!

Weren’t you guys not apologizing?

Fine!

Then I’ll slap until your entire holy land lose all reputation!

Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin and Zhao Zixuan and company were clearly together. They were working in cahoots. There was nowhere for Ye Yuan to reason it out even if he wanted to.

Therefore, he might as well not reason things out!

Since you were unreasonable, then I’ll be unreasonable too!

I’ll beat you until you yield!

The so-called challenging mountain was Ye Yuan challenging all of Cloud Summer Mountain’s powerhouses all the way from the foot of the mountain up.

As long as there was anyone who was not convinced, they could come forward and fight!

This sort of action required extremely powerful strength, as well as immensely strong courage.

Who in the present world dared to say that they could definitely win these few ancestor-level powerhouses?

Ye Yuan doing so was betting his own reputation and the Priest Temple’s reputation.

At the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time, alchemy powerhouses were plentiful like clouds.

One could say that it gathered the entire Heavenspan World’s alchemy powerhouses!

Once Ye Yuan failed, not only would he become the alchemy world’s laughingstock, even the entire Sacrificial Temple would become the alchemy world’s laughingstock.

After all, Ye Yuan was not some low-level minor character.

He was the Priest Temple’s Second Sage!

Of course, if Ye Yuan won, then Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove’s lineage would become the entire alchemy world’s laughing stock.

One person sweeping across an entire holy land, there was no way it would not be humiliating!

“Sacrificial Temple’s Ye Yuan requests to challenge Cloud Summer Mountain!”

Ye Yuan’s voice sounded out once more.

The entire Cloudheart City exploded!

Before coming, everyone had heard of the title of Second Sage resoundingly like the roar of thunder.

But no one could have thought that Second Sage was actually so tough!

Challenging the mountain at a word of disagreement!

Zhu Tianxiang smiled coldly and said, “This guy is crazy, right? Who does he think he is? Apart from those few in this world, who dares to say that they can definitely win Master? Having the title of Second Sage, does he really think that he is an ancestor-level powerhouse?”

Zhao Zixuan laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha ... it’s really making me die of laughter! Just now, I was really intimidated by this guy. After messing around for so long, this guy is just a kid who hasn’t grown up, acting out of spite here? At this time, that one on Feather Mountain is likely currently stamping with rage, right?”

After Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin was shocked, he also laughed in spite of himself and said, “I underestimated this one’s temper, to actually do such an action that seeks death. With this, the mess can’t be cleaned up anymore even if we want to.”

The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference had not officially started yet and the atmosphere was already pushed to the climax by Ye Yuan.

His action thoroughly ignited the quiet Myriad Region Alchemy Conference all at once.

Regardless of whether it was those giants or small fries, currently, everyone’s gazes were all focused on Cloud Summer Mountain.

The crowd rushed out of the city like a tide, heading towards Cloud Summer Mountain.

How could one miss such a grand occasion?

“Priest Temple’s Ye Yuan requests to challenge Cloud Summer Mountain!”

Ye Yuan’s voice sounded out for the third time, the entire Cloud Summer Mountain could hear it clearly.

At the top of Cloud Summer Mountain, inside the great hall, Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove’s brows were tightly locked.

In front of him, his disciples were all extremely enraged.

“Master, this punk really takes himself to be some bigshot, to actually dare provoke a great holy land!”

“Master, I can go and get rid of him by myself!”

... ...

Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove frowned and said, “This emperor didn’t provoke the Priest Temple. Why did this boy do such an astonishing action?”

Everyone exchanged glances, uncertain what it meant.

Suddenly, Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove’s gaze turned intent and he said, “Where’s Tianxiang?”

The moment the group of disciples looked, Zhu Tianxiang was indeed not around.

They understood this Youngest Apprentice Brother very well. With his temperament, he should have long appeared.

“Master, Youngest Apprentice Brother and Zhao Zixuan they all went to Cloudheart City,” Eldest Senior Brother Yun Windborne said.

Everyone’s faces changed, immediately guessing what was going on.

Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove snorted coldly and said, “This scoundrelly punk, too ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth! The Priest Temple, this old man doesn’t dare to provoke either, but he’s actually being the bird who takes the lead!”

Yun Windborne’s expression was complicated as he said, “Master, then should ... we meet the challenge or not?”

Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove snorted coldly and said, “Of course we accept the challenge! He already came to the doorstep, could it be that we can still be cowardly turtles? This way, wouldn’t we become the laughingstock of the world, saying that we don’t even dare to deal with a little brat? Zhiling, you bring the junior apprentice brothers to go and guard the pass. Heh, young and aggressive, this emperor is also very curious about this Second Sage. Today, I want to see whether or not he’s really as formidable as the stories I heard!”
