Chapter 1331: Ghost Dao Hundred Runes!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“T-Two-star evil spirit?”

The faces of Chang Liang and the others suddenly changed, their gazes looking at that man in great terror.

Although legends had it that there was a Two-star evil spirit existing in this Yin Wind Den, no one had ever seen it before.

They never dreamed that this man in front of them who was no different from a human was actually the Two-star evil spirit!

Less than one in ten thousand ordinary Two-star evil spirits were able to unlock intelligence.

What they had was just instinctive devouring.

Toward such a Two-star evil spirit, Dustless was really powerless to do anything. Because they could only slaughter instinctively.

But even Dustless also did not expect that the Two-star evil spirit in this Ghost King Cave actually gave birth to intelligence.

The man did not deny it either but said, “There is ... an aura that makes me very wary on you!”

Actually, Ye Yuan was also very surprised. He also thought that evil spirits were all that sort of neither human nor ghost appearance; malicious-looking.

He did not think that Two-star evil spirits actually turned out to be like this.

Moreover, the other party’s perception seemed to be very keen.

Chang Liang’s pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan with a face full of terror.

He simply did not dare to believe that a Two-star evil spirit would actually say such words!

One could say that if a Two-star evil spirit wanted to kill them, it just needed to move a finger, and it would be enough.

But facing the Ye Yuan who was only initial-stage Grotto Profound, he was actually so apprehensive!

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Middle-stage Two-star, strength isn’t bad! I didn’t expect that your intelligence can unlock to this extent. That saved me a bout of trouble.”

Chang Liang was shuddering with fear, listening by the side, wishing to turn tail and run.

This Ye Yuan was too crazy!

That was a Two-star evil spirit, Ye Yuan actually dared to talk like this.

Hang on, middle-stage Two-star?

Chang Liang felt incomparably flustered, what the hell was this?!

Within the Grotto Profound Realm, a minor realm was a layer of heaven. Then Heaven Glimpse Realm was naturally even more so!

The disparity between initial-stage and middle-stage was even greater!

Also, how did Ye Yuan able to tell that the other party was a Two-star evil spirit?

The amount of information was too great. The five of them brothers felt somewhat unable to digest.

But the man said, “How do you know ... I won’t make a move against you? You’re ... too weak!”

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “If your intelligence isn’t unlocked yet, then forget it. Naturally we can’t dispense with a fierce battle between us. But since your intelligence is already unlocked, then you don’t have to a move against this young master.”

Ye Yuan said it very assuredly and did not take the man’s threat to heart at all.

For him to dare say so, it was naturally because there was Dustless, this great divinity, there.

The might of an empyrean spirit treasure, ordinary people could not imagine it at all.

Even though Dustless was a tiger that landed in the plains now, for the other party to want to kill Ye Yuan, it was likely really not so easy.

The man smiled and said, “Your esteemed self is too confident! For me to kill you is merely the effort of lifting a finger!”

Finished talking, a terrifying Yin energy was suddenly released, locking onto Ye Yuan firmly.

It was just that, Ye Yuan did not feel anything, but Chang Liang five people were virtually frozen stiff already.

They discovered to their dismay that they could not even move a finger anymore.

This Two-star evil spirit had yet to make a move, and they already fell down!

A surge of faintly imperceptible aura enveloped Ye Yuan up.

The Yin wind automatically divided when it arrived in front of Ye Yuan, blowing past towards the two sides.

The man’s pupils shrunk. Only then did he ascertain that Ye Yuan was indeed not simple!

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “Don’t do this kind of pointless probing anymore. It’s no use. This young master gives you a chance. Sign a Heavenly Dao Contract and serve me as your master. This young master gifts you a lucky chance!”

While talking, Ye Yuan came before Chang Liang five people, extended a finger, and lightly tapped on the five of their foreheads.

A burst of faint soul force undulation flowed out from his fingertips, instantly spreading through the five of their bodies.

The five people trembled all over. That stiff feeling of being frozen to the bones instantly vanished without a trace.

However, what they were shocked by was not this, but the words that Ye Yuan said!

These words were too earth-shattering, resulting in that even though the five people were able to move, they still opened their mouths wide, looking at Ye Yuan blankly.

What did he say earlier?

Make a Two-star evil spirit that unlocked intelligence serve him as Master? His Excellency ... he wouldn’t have eaten the wrong medicine, right?

The man was also stupefied and immediately laughed in spite of himself and said, “What a joke! An initial-stage Grotto Profound youth actually dares to spout this kind of drivel! Is your esteemed self provoking my bottom line?”

The rankings of the martial artist world were stringent. Ye Yuan’s realm was too low, saying these words was a great disrespect.

Even if they had no ill-feelings or enmity, just based on this sentence, the other party had sufficient reason to kill already.

Ye Yuan just smiled and suddenly extended a finger, drawing something in the air.

Chang Liang and the rest were uncertain what it meant, completely unaware of what strange ideas Ye Yuan was mystifying.

It looked like some sort of talismans.

He could not help looking in the direction of the man and discovered that the expression on the man’s face was currently changing from disdain to thunderstruck, and finally, wild ecstasy!

Only then did they know that these incomprehensible talismans that Ye Yuan drew were very extraordinary.

“Ghost Dao Hundred Runes! What ... What you drew was the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes!” The man’s words were full of shock.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Huhu, it looks like you recognize the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, it saves this young master his breath.”

The man trembled all over and said in disbelief, “You ... How can you, a human, possibly know the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “How this young master knows, don’t need you to be concerned with. You just say whether you’re willing to follow this young master or not. Don’t have any strange ideas, you only have one chance.”

The man’s gaze turned intent, a look of struggle surfacing on his face.

Ye Yuan’s warning made him become very conflicted.

To an evil spirit, for them to be able to leach within a martial artist’s body, it was equivalent to seizing possession, but also not the same as seizing possession.

Because they were an independent body and did not need to rely on the fleshy body to survive.

The strange idea that Ye Yuan said was actually referring to this.

What flashed across at the first moment just now was indeed this thought.

But Ye Yuan’s words shattered his fantasy into smithereens.

If it were others, he would seize possession without the slightest hesitation and forcefully plunder the other party’s memories.

But Ye Yuan was unusual.

From the very beginning, Ye Yuan gave him a very dangerous feeling.

The aura that the Soul Suppressing Pearl faintly revealed made him extremely wary.

At one side, Chang Liang five people did not even dare to breathe loudly. They were quietly waiting for the man’s decision.

They never dreamed that Ye Yuan’s words were actually really going to subdue a Two-star evil spirit!

At least, the other party was moved!

This lord was really becoming more and more mysterious. Just what kind of existence was he?

Alchemy strength was exceedingly terrifying, Martial Dao’s strength unfathomable. Now, he was actually going to subdue a Two-star evil spirit. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Chang Liang felt that this world was really too crazy.

Everything he had seen and heard today was simply even more exciting that his lifetime experiences added up.

Time slowly trickled by, and the expression on the man’s face flickered incessantly.

Ye Yuan did not urge either, just quietly waiting for the other party’s answer.

He had full confidence that the other party definitely could not resist the temptation of the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes.

“Alright then, I promise you!” Finally, the man opened his mouth and surrendered.
