Chapter 2492: What Are You Scared Of?

“Tsk tsk,?really touching! Your brothers barely escaped death to obtain the Tear of Life for you. But in the end, it was obtained by me. Would you feel very angry?”

Lin Chaotian smiled faintly. His smugness was practically exuding.

But right then, a figure walked out of the fog, looking at Ye Yuan with a proud look.

“Huhu,?Lord Saint Azure, are you still satisfied with this big gift?”

The one talking was none other than precisely Zhang Zhen!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, a wave of evil fire immediately welled up in his heart.

This Lin Chaotian really exhausted his abilities!

Zhang Zhen smiled and said,?“Huhu,?I know that Lord Saint Azure won’t trust me. I also don’t need Lord Saint Azure to trust me. As long as your brothers trust me, it will do!”

Lin Chaotian also smiled and said, “Apart from Zhang Zhen, the Deva Realms under this ancestor have sincerely turned to you for protection!?Heh,?a mixture of truth and falsehood makes it difficult to distinguish! Furthermore, you seem to have forgotten, this ancestor entered the Heavenspan Mountain once! Back then, this ancestor fought all the way, narrowly escaping death, before I attained the position of Dao Ancestor! Nobody is more familiar with the Heavenspan Mountain than me! Although Zhang Zhen they all didn’t take the same path, they will definitely run into each other! Hence, the whereabouts of these brothers of yours, have actually all been within my control!”

Ye Yuan’s existence made Lin Chaotian feel a tremendous threat.

This kind of threat even surpassed the divine race!

Hence, during these few years of Heavenly Dao Samsara, Lin Chaotian racked his brains to think, not about the struggle to be Dao Ancestor this time, but how to deal with Ye Yuan’s revenge!

Lin Chaotian was a sensible person. He knew that a battle between him and Ye Yuan was unavoidable.

Therefore, he practically hollowed his brain out these few years, wanting to find a way to deal with Ye Yuan.

But in the end, he discovered to his dismay, this was an unsolvable problem!

Ye Yuan could not be killed!

As long as he could not kill Ye Yuan, he would continuously grow stronger and eventually surpass himself.

Lin Chaotiaan thought of corroborating his Dao and becoming an ancestor again. But he thought it over. Being a Dao Ancestor could not provide him with a sense of security at all.

Ye Yuan’s potential was endless!

Then, what was Ye Yuan’s weakness?

His friends!

Last time, he was ill-prepared.

But this time, he would not fail!

On the ground, Pang Zhen vomited blood and said with an angry roar, “Zhang Zhen, you despicable villain! I definitely won’t let you off!”

Zhang Zhen was indifferent and said with a smile,?“Huhu,

?you’re thinking too much! He only has two rule crystals. How do you know that he’ll pick you? According to what I know, it seems like your standing on his side is inferior to these two!”

Pang Zhen’s pupils constricted and he gritted his teeth and said, “Wan Zhen, Lord Profound Secrets, after I die, you guys must avenge me and kill this damn dog!”

Wan Zhen’s gaze flickered and he roared, “Your Excellency, save Lord Profound Secrets and Pang Zhen!”

Profound Secrets had blood in his mouth as he laughed loudly and said, “You two little babes are actually vying with this old man! This old man has lived for ten billion years and has long already lived enough! Ye Yuan, although I didn’t achieve what Father has done, being revered for generation after generation, but I still have this bit of bearing! You save them!”

Ye Yuan frowned. He did not make a sound from start to end.

He could feel that Lin Chaotian performed some tricks on their bodies.

As long as he made the slightest unusual movement, these three would die without a burial ground.

But these three people, he was unable to accept losing any one of them!

“Tsk tsk,?how touching! At this time, you guys can actually still think of helping the others!?Huhu,?but don’t you all feel that this will make it even harder for him to choose instead?”

Lin Chaotian had a smug face as he looked at Ye Yuan and said, “Why? Can’t choose? Why don’t … this ancestor help you choose?”

Boom!

Lin Chaotian pointed a finger out, Pang Zhen’s two legs directly exploded into nothingness.

“Urgh?…” Pang Zhen hurt until he sweat cold bullets, gasping the cold air in pain.

But he refused to scream from start to end.

Although this was not fatal, it was painful to the extreme.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he shouted coldly, “Lin Chaotian, you’re courting death!”

Lin Chaotian was indifferent and said with a faint smile,?“Oh??Is that so?”

Swoosh!

His figure suddenly moved, pouncing straight for Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, Universe suddenly unfolded!

“You dare to block?” Lin Chaotian was all smiles as he said.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, immediately withdrawing Universe.

Bang!

Lin Chaotian’s palm was embedded into Ye Yuan’s chest firmly.

Ye Yuan spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, flying out backward.

Against that palm, Ye Yuan withdrew Universe and the power of domain. Hence, it landed firmly on his body.

Regarding Lin Chaotian’s one palm, how terrifying was the power?

The number one Dao Ancestor did not come from boasting!

His strength might be even greater than those five people Ye Yuan fought with previously!

“My Lord Saint Azure!, You’re also nothing more than this!”

Lin Chaotian looked at the Ye Yuan who fell to the ground and said with a big laugh,?“Hahaha?… Ye Yuan, aren’t you very arrogant? Didn’t you look down on this ancestor? Get up! You, fight back!”

Bang!

While talking, Lin Chaotian’s figure moved swiftly, another palm imprinting onto Ye Yuan’s chest.

Ye Yuan flew backward again!

Receiving two palms in a row, even if Ye Yuan’s physical body was exceedingly strong, his innards also suffered a tremendous impact, his injuries extremely severe. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

One had to know, he did not have the slightest defense, relying entirely on his physical body to forcibly resist two palms!

If it were others, Lin Chaotian’s these two palms landing, they would have long already been beaten into nothingness.

“Hahaha?… indeed deserving of being Lord Saint Azure, really resistant to hits! Your divine soul can’t be killed, but if this ancestor destroys your physical body, then I wonder if you can still break the shackles or not?”

Lin Chaotian laughed savagely, a palm slamming onto Ye Yuan’s body once again.

All the bones in Ye Yuan’s body seemed to have been broken up, his internal organs practically ruptured.

“Argh! Argh!?Argh! Lord Saint Azure, leave us alone! Fight back!” Pang Zhen had tears in his eyes, enduring the intense pain as he bellowed.

Wan Zhen clenched his jaws tightly and said with an angry roar, “Lord Saint Azure, our death isn’t regrettable! Fight back! Kill this damn dog and revive the human race!”

They understood that Ye Yuan already had the strength to challenge Lin Chaotian presently.

But, for their sake, he would rather be beaten into serious injuries by Lin Chaotian.

At this rate, Ye Yuan’s physical body would really be ruined!

With his physical body being ruined, Ye Yuan naturally would not die.

But, wanting to reach his present peak would require far too much effort.

And Lin Chaotian would not give him this chance!

When Lin Chaotian heard that, he laughed loudly and said, “Yeah, fight back! Why aren’t you fighting back, Lord Saint Azure? Fight back!”

Swoosh!

Lin Chaotian’s figure moved again, a palm slamming toward Ye Yuan again.

This feeling of toying with Ye Yuan made him enjoy it greatly!

But right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly lifted his hand, his eyes full of coldness.

A feeling of immense danger suddenly rose!

Lin Chaotian’s expression changed wildly, his figure retreating explosively!

He was frightened!

Ye Yuan struggled to stand up. Looking at Lin Chaotian indifferently, he said, “Come on! What are you scared of?”

Only then did Lin Chaotian know that he had been tricked!

Ye Yuan did not dare to retaliate at all. Just now, he was just scaring him.

And he was really scared!

“Damn it! Brat, you’re courting death!” Lin Chaotian turned angry from embarrassment, a palm thrusting toward Ye Yuan again!
