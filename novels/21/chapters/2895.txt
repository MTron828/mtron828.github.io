Chapter 2901 Suppressing a City, Entire Army Sudden Raid!

This was the Heaven One army’s first time going out of Absolute Heaven in thousands of years!

With 100 thousand soldiers, each carried a feeling of novelty and even more a strong sense of pride.

We are the first batch out of Absolute Heaven!

It turns out that outside of Absolute Heaven, there is such scenery!

There were many among them who even had tears run down their cheeks.

“It’s been more than 5000 years. I finally set foot in my homeland! Sniff sniff … Thank you so much, Master Ye!”

A True Sovereign Heaven prostrated down to Ye Yuan, shedding tears of gratitude.

He went to the Absolute Heaven Barrier back then and originally thought that he could never hope to return to his homeland again.

He did not expect that today, he actually went out of Absolute Heaven!

The Absolute Heaven Barrier was a powerful barrier, it blocked the blood race’s irons hoofs, but did it not block countless Heaven One martial artists too?

All along, there were large numbers of blood race troops stationed outside of the passageways.

But, after South Qi’s great victory, there were no more bloodkins outside of the passageways.

Only then did they have the chance to go out of Absolute Heaven.

An army of 100 thousand went forth in mighty contingents, rushing until they were under Giant Net City!

The blood race was stunned!

Did South Qi’s people go mad? Bloodpromise stood on top of the city walls. Looking at Feng Xiaotian, he laughed loudly and said, “Feng Xiaotian, is your head spoiled? To actually dare come and invade Giant Net City?”

Feng Xiaotian said coolly, “Bloodpromise, today is your hour of doom!”

Bloodpromise laughed loudly and said, “Alright, bring it on! This seat wants to see what you’ll use to kill me!”

Giant Net City did not have a city protecting grand array.

But it was naturally impossible for the blood race to not have any methods when they built a giant city.

In reality, the materials used to build Giant Net City were all specially manufactured by the blood race.

Once there were enemies that came to invade, it could erupt with formidable power and could even cut down Emperor Realms!

The power was not the slightest bit weaker than a grand array!

This thing was called the Light of Blood Eye! “Bloodpromise, you piece of trash, this liege is here. Why haven’t you knelt down to welcome me!” Ye Yuan said in a clear voice.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Bloodpromise’s two eyes turned red at once.

It was true that when two enemies met, their eyes blazed with hatred!

How many losses had he suffered at this guy’s hands?

By the side, City Lord Su Mu even had monstrous blood energy surging to the sky, wishing to tear Ye Yuan to shreds alive.

His good friend, Bloodsword, was killed because of a word from Ye Yuan!

At that time, he only felt that having offended Blood Divine Son His Highness, he was helpless too.

However, who knew that this fellow was actually Ye Yuan!

Younger Brother Bloodsword, you died so unjustly!

“Pffft!” Bloodpromise spurted out a mouthful of old blood once more.

In this Giant Net City, he had been humiliated by Ye Yuan several times!

Now, this guy actually still came to anger him!

“Ye Yuan, you dare go out of the Absolute Heaven Barrier? This seat will definitely kill you today!” Bloodpromise’s two eyes were bright red as he said. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Trash is trash. You’re nothing at all in my eyes! You Jin, you killed our Hegemon Edgeless. Today, I’ll have you repay a blood debt in blood!”

At this time, You Jin was standing on top of the city walls too.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, he immediately understood in his heart.

The Heaven One army came for him!

A hint of a sneer surfaced at the corners of his mouth. This bunch of guys was also underestimating Hegemon Realms too much!

Hegemon Realm, even if it was a seriously wounded Hegemon Realm, they were also not what a bunch of ants could provoke!

He looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Alright, this seat … is waiting for you!”

Bloodpromise even laughed mockingly and said, “Reckless and blind thing! You really think that having become the Blood Divine Son, you’re very impressive? Hegemon Realms are existences that you cannot imagine!”

“Oh, is that so? Then … I’m coming! Attack the city!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan roared. Over 100 thousand troops rushed in like a swarm of hornets.

A hint of a cruel smile already flashed across the corners of Bloodpromise’s mouth.

After the Light of Blood Eye erupted, it will be considered pretty good if half of your 100 thousand strong army can survive!

Emperor Realms will have to die in swathes too!

This is your final trump card, right?

If all of them died here, will those Hegemons be in a lot of pain?

Thinking up to here, Bloodpromise and You Jin were both incomparably delighted.

South Qi’s great battle was seriously lost too oppressively!

However, they never dreamed that the Heaven One army actually ran over on their own accord to seek death!

One had to know, right now, there were still 300 thousand troops in Giant Net City!

Although these people were much worse compared to those elites, under the help of the Light of Blood Eye, it was still more than sufficient to finish off these 100 thousand Heaven One elites!

In reality, just the Saint Sovereign Heavens and True Sovereign Heavens within the jurisdiction of Giant Net City, the numbers already reached as high as several million.

But Heaven One’s raid was seriously too sudden. Giant Net City did not have time to summon everyone to join the battle at all.

Presently, there was only a standing army of 300 thousand in the city.

However, it would suffice!

Feng Xiaotian took the lead, bringing a group of Emperor Realms and rushing straight for Bloodpromise.

The 100 thousand strong army also rushed toward the top of the city walls.

Right at this time, Giant Net City erupted with a bloody light that rose to the sky, giving people a hair-raising feeling.

An astonishing crisis welled up in everyone’s hearts.

But their speed did not reduce in the slightest!

Because Ye Yuan told them that they did not need to be scared. They should count on him for everything!

If someone else said these, they would definitely turn their noses up in disdain!

But with Ye Yuan saying this, they believed without a shadow of a doubt!

This person had created an unprecedented great victory and created countless miracles!

Not believing in him, who else could you believe in?

When Bloodpromise saw this, he laughed loudly and said, “A bunch of fools, could it be that Ye Yuan didn’t tell you guys that Giant Net City has the Light of Blood Eye? Die, fools!”

However, a figure jumped up onto the top of the city walls first!

Following that, an even more terrifying aura directly erupted.

This was origin blood energy!

Its degree of terror made even the bloodkins shudder!

Then, the terrifying Light of Blood Eye actually directly retreated!

When Bloodpromise saw this scene, his two eyes could not help going black, nearly fainting

Even Hegemon You Jin’s pupils constricted too.

I … F*ck me!

The Light of Blood Eye completely did not dare to erupt in front of the blood origin that the mother stone bestowed!

The Light of Blood Eye was directly suppressed back by the origin aura that Ye Yuan erupted with!

In reality, Ye Yuan already sensed this Light of Blood Eye at Giant Net City.

This Light of Blood Eye was actually about the same as Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City’s.

It was just that the Light of Blood Eye here was much weaker.

Ye Yuan had once attempted to slightly release a hint of blood origin aura.

As a result, these Light of Blood Eye feared him like a tiger!

At that time, Ye Yuan determined that his origin of blood could suppress Giant Net City’s Light of Blood Eye!

Giving thanks to the Chaos Bloodstone, this wisp of blood origin was really useful! “Pffft!”

Bloodpromise spurted out another mouthful of old blood, he felt like he was almost dying!

Mother stone, don’t scam your descendants like this!

Isn’t this killing people?

In reality, even Hegemon You Jin also did not know how strong the blood origin in Ye Yuan’s body was.

At least, Hegemon You Jin was unable to suppress the Light of Blood Eye!

But Ye Yuan could!

It was because the origin of blood in his body was the most fundamental and purest origin of blood!

One had to know, the entire blood race was created by the mother stone.

In Bloodpromise’s heart, a myriad of curses galloped across.

The blood race was actually scammed by the mother stone!

When the Heaven One army saw the Light of Blood Eye being suppressed, their imposing momentum skyrocketed significantly!

Feng Xiaotian and the rest of the Emperor Realms were wildly ecstatic too!

Honestly speaking, they more or less still had some misgivings before this.

The blood race’s methods were impossible to guard against.

But now, their misgivings were all gone!

Looking at Bloodpromise’s expression, everyone knew that he was extremely surprised too.

The Blood Divine Son was indeed different!

Ye Yuan was really the savior that Heaven sent to save Heaven One!

Impressive!

Hegemon You Jin’s gaze turned slightly dark. He was going to take action! Although seriously injured, it was still not a problem to deal with the likes of Feng Xiaotian.

But right at this time, a figure landed not far from him and said coolly, “You Jin, your opponent is me!”
