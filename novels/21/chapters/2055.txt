Chapter 2059: All-round Defeat

“T-T-This ... How can this be? Brother Pilljade, you mustn’t leave us alone to die! Ye Yuan he ... is definitely taking revenge on us!”

Hearing one news after another transmitting over, Empyrean Proudcloud looked like he lost his wits.

The Southern Border Alliance was actually all-round defeated within a short half a month’s time.

Especially his territory, it was shockingly already a severely hit area.

The Myriad Treasure Tower even did a 3% discount in his territory. Furthermore, the medicinal pills were very plentiful.

This kind of situation absolutely could not be seen elsewhere.

Because right now, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s medicinal pills were extremely sought after. Even if it rose 20% in price, it was still hard to seek out a single pill.

Although the Myriad Treasure Tower was well-prepared this time, they could not stand up to the tidal water-like martial artists.

No matter how many the medicinal pills were, it was also impossible to satisfy the requirements of all martial artists.

After all, there were too many martial artists and too few alchemists.

Hence, Empyrean Proudcloud’s territory was virtually crushed by the Myriad Treasure Tower already. His medicine shops could not continue operating anymore.

Even a blind person could also tell that the Myriad Treasure Tower and Ye Yuan were deliberately squelching Empyrean Proudcloud.

Empyrean Pilljade’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold snort, “How to save you? Our six great holy lands already can’t save ourselves now, and you’re still counting on us to go and save you? Didn’t you hear? Just earlier, Eastfence Great Imperial Capital had already completely fallen and became the Myriad Treasure Tower’s territory?”

Eastfence Great Imperial Capital was a very important great imperial capital in Empyrean Pilljade’s hands. Its status was similar to that of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s Longwind Great Imperial Capital.

Even Eastfence Great Imperial Capital had fallen into enemy hands, it could be imagined how dangerous the current situation was.

At this time, Empyrean Wenlan could not resist saying, “Humph! Proudcloud, you still have the cheek to say that! If not for you, this kind of situation also wouldn’t have appeared! Back then, if you lowered your head to Ye Yuan, how can we get into such a mess?”

His losses were also extremely devastating, his mood very bad.

Seeing Empyrean Proudcloud jump out, he finally could not resist bursting out.

Empyrean Proudcloud said in a great rage, “Wenlan, you’re shooting me at this time now? Back then, I wonder who was it that banged his fist on the table and yelled bravo, and even said that they wanted a share of the loot?”

“You!” Empyrean Wenlan was stifled, but he was unable to refute Empyrean Proudcloud.

When Ye Yuan withdrew from the Southern Border Alliance, Empyrean Wenlan clapped his hands and cheered at that time.

Furthermore, in the beginning, because of face, he was embarrassed to make a move to swallow Ye Yuan’s territory.

But later, he had indeed reached his hands out to Ye Yuan’s territory.

“Enough!” Empyrean Pilljade yelled furiously and said, “What’s the use of arguing now? If you have the time, then why not think about how to salvage our position in this declining state?!”

Empyrean Windrider said, “Right now, it isn’t just the problem of defeat! For the sake of the operation this time, we’ve virtually mobilized all of the Southern Border’s elite alchemists and refined large batches of medicinal pills. If these medicinal pills are unable to be sold, they will rot inside the warehouses.”

Empyrean Blazing Sun also said with a solemn face, “This time is different from the past. As long as medicinal pills are stored properly, they will always sell. But these medicinal pills that Ye Yuan took out have already rolled out across the board in the Southern Border. Once they become conventional medicinal pills, our medicinal pills won’t be able to sell at all!”

Empyrean Lumen let out a slight sigh, and said, “I urged you all back then, but you all wouldn’t listen. Now, it’s too late to regret!”

The others were silent.

Empyrean Lumen warned them back then, saying that Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao was extremely deep, creating several kinds of new pill formulas was not a problem. But no one believed.

It was just that Empyrean Lumen was still extremely shocked in his heart.

He thought that he already thought highly of Ye Yuan. He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s performance still exceeded his imaginations.

As soon as these medicinal pills emerged, it was like martial artists cleansing their marrows, making the entire Southern Border’s alchemy world have an overall reorganization.

To the six great holy lands, the blow was close to catastrophic.

Empyrean Pilljade’s gaze flicked, and he opened his mouth and said, “Now that it has come to this, we already don’t have a way out! Order all medicine shops to lower the prices of medicinal pills by half! If it really doesn’t work, then drop it to 40%, 30%! Since we can’t beat them in terms of quality, we’ll use price to force them into a corner! Can such a colossal Southern Border Alliance be defeated by a mere one person? Then wouldn’t we all become laughingstocks?”

Hearing Empyrean Pilljade’s words, the other people’s minds quivered.

Losing a little was much better than medicinal pills rotting in the warehouse.

The Southern Border Alliance used too much strength this time. The one-off medicinal pills refinement was roughly enough for the various major factions to sell for as long as ten years.

But this kind of method was a typical example of harming others without benefits; it was too shameless.

It was just that reaching this point, these heavyweights would not care about whether it was shameless or not.

Therefore, a drawn-out fierce battle unfolded between the Southern Border Alliance and Myriad Treasure Tower.

The Myriad Treasure Tower’s medicinal pills were indeed unparalleled under the heavens, refreshing the understanding of all martial artists.

As soon as the more than ten kinds of medicinal pills were rolled out, it immediately swept through the entire Southern Border, with sky-high praises.

In contrast, the Southern Border Alliance’s medicinal pills were too lousy.

However, one could not help that they were shameless!

If the Myriad Treasure Tower was selling their medicinal pills for 100 thousand high-grade divine essence stones, then the Southern Border Alliance only sold theirs for 50 or even 30 thousand high-grade divine essence stones. This was still very attractive to some bottom-level martial artists.

For some time, both parties were stalemated there.

This seesaw battle lasted until the fifth year. Finally, the balance was broken by a series of news.

Firstly, Empyrean Chaoyuan came out of seclusion and announced to join the Myriad Treasure Tower’s camp.

The second news, the Beitang Ancient Family and seven great ancient families that were reclusive similarly announced to join the Myriad Treasure Tower’s camp.

Although Empyrean Chaoyuan was an itinerant cultivator, the forces under his command still could not be underestimated.

Exiting seclusion this time, he broke through to the half-step Ancestor Realm!

This kind of strength was an apex existence even when placed in the entire Southern Border. No one dared to overlook him.

And the addition of the Beitang and other ancient families gave the Southern Border Alliance the most lethal blow.

The seven great ancient families, each family was an ancient family at the Mt. Tai level of the Southern Border’s alchemy world. Their strength even did not lose to the seven great peak holy lands.

With their support, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s strength immediately soared by a great deal.

To the Myriad Treasure Tower, the most important was the problem of resources. After all, it was hard for two fists to fight four hands. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

But although these reclusive ancient families were obscure, they had tremendous influence in terms of resources.

With this kind of confidence, the Myriad Treasure Tower was not afraid of fighting a protracted war at all.

You lower your price, I want to see until when you can do so!

When it reached the eighth year, the Southern Border Alliance finally started collapsing.

Firstly, a batch of medium and small factions could not bear the stalling and started going out of business one after another.

The resources grasped in their hands were far too lacking compared to those peak holy lands.

Right on the heels of that, some grandmasters’ factions also gradually started going bankrupt.

Later on, even a major force like the Cloudpill Establishment also started to not be able to hold on anymore.

In the ninth year, Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s City Lord Manor was overcast with dark clouds.

Fatigue and helplessness were written all over the faces of all of the heavyweights.

“Brother Pilljade, we can’t continue like this! Carrying on like this, the entire Southern Border will become the Myriad Treasure Tower’s territory!” Empyrean Remotenight said with a mournful look.

“Yeah, this war is a bottomless hole! If we keep dragging on, the resources that we accumulated over a long time will all be gone!” Another Empyrean was practically crying.
