Chapter 2330: Developing Dao

“Senior Apprentice Brother Yun, my Cloudmoon Silver Ring Pill is always lacking a little. Can you come and help me take a look at what the problem is?”

“Senior Apprentice Brother Yun, you look at my Purple Smoke Immortal Condensing Art. What shortcomings are there still?”

“Senior Apprentice Sister Ning, your Zhen Sui Fire Controlling Technique has truly reached the acme of perfection!”

... ...

In the Pill Tower, a group of Eight-star Alchemy Gods surrounded Yun Yi and Ning Siyu, chatting and asking non-stop.

Originally, they were all struck with reverence and awe.

After all, these alchemy path powerhouses were all big shots who commanded a region.

Which Eight-star Alchemy God was not looked up to by millions in the Heavenspan World, an existence that had people cluster around them like a myriad of stars surrounding the moon?

But here, they were like elementary school students. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When they just arrived, they naturally wanted to get Ye Yuan’s guidance.

But Ye Yuan very naturally threw it over to Yun Yi and Ning Siyu. Very soon, they shut up collectively.

They all, these Eight-star Alchemy Gods, actually could not beat Ye Yuan’s disciples!

Only then did these big shots discover that Ye Yuan’s cultivation method was indeed astonishing!

Hence, they put away their pride and studied in-depth with Yun Yi and the rest on a daily basis.

But the more they communicated, the more horrified they got.

The depth of Yun Yi and the rest’s insights, made them perspire from embarrassment.

One had to know, Yun Yin’s current realm was still low.

After his realm came up, he could completely crush them, these big shots.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd. Several figures walked in.

Yun Yi and the Ning Siyu hurriedly got up and gave a bow to the arrivals.

“Master! Lord Sacred Ancestor!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said smilingly, “Do you have any gains from communicating with seniors these few days?”

The two said, “Benefited a lot!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Mn, everyone present is a senior whose name shakes a region. You guys have to be more humble and learn more things from them.”

The two hurriedly said, “Yes!”

All the Heavenly Emperors perspired from embarrassment. Ye Yuan’s words were simply face-slapping!

These few days, they had long already been brought into submission by Senior Apprentice Brother Yun Yi and willingly followed them to cultivate.

To talk about learning, it should have been them who were learning.

One of the Heavenly Emperors smiled bitterly and said, “Younger Brother Ye, aren’t you slapping our faces here? Young Friend Yun’s realm is just not there yet. Otherwise, what has it got to do with us, these old fellows? Second Sage, we all, these old fellows, really didn’t expect that even your disciples are so strong! Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma being the number one alchemy path holy land is true to its name!”

This Heavenly Emperor was called Heavenly Emperor Nao Hua, a late-stage Eight-star Alchemy God. His seniority was extremely high and his influence in the alchemy world was also immense.

But these few days, he was utterly convinced by the Pill Tower.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Nao Hua misunderstood! When this Ye teaches disciples, the first priority is to guard against arrogance and rashness, and to not to be self-conceited. No matter how high their realm, how strong their strength, they also can’t underestimate their opponents. Stones from other hills may serve to polish the jade of this one. Learning from other people’s strong points and making up our deficiencies are the right way.”

When everyone heard, they were slightly stunned in their hearts.

It turned out that Ye Yuan was not being modest, he was just expounding on a fact.

In Ye Yuan’s heart, Yun Yi was stronger than them!

But even if he was strong, he had to put aside his ego too, and learn from others.

Thinking back now, these few days, Yun Yi had also indeed remained indifferent when granted favors or when subjected to humiliation, neither arrogant nor impetuous.

Only then did the group of alchemy path powerhouses discover that this Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma was truly different from the rest in all aspects.

They all, these people, had been in high positions for too long. They were existences above the clouds, each and every one incomparably proud.

To make them learn from people weaker than them, it was simply impossible.

But now, they discovered that someone who was more outstanding than them was not only more hardworking but also more humble!

This kind of humility was not verbal humility, but the modesty of mentality.

Only when one was truly modest in mentality could one learn the shining points of others.

As for verbal modesty, Ye Yuan completely turned his nose up at it.

Him being strong, that was natural and right!

This point could also be seen from his words.

“Everyone, I’ve discussed with Senior Sacred Ancestor and decided that starting from next time, Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma will start a Dao sermon! It will be started by this Ye. After this Ye leaves, Senior Sacred Ancestor will take over. He has also contacted several progenitor-level powerhouses. They have all agreed. Coming to find everyone today, it’s hoping that everyone spreads the news. Anybody, as long as they have interest in Alchemy Dao, can all come to Heavenly Eagle to listen to the Dao sermon!” Ye Yuan said.

The moment the Heavenly Emperors heard, each and every one of their faces changed greatly.

The so-called Dao sermon was to demonstrate and dissect their own Dao little by little and demonstrate it for the people listening to Dao.

This was equivalent to saying that the core-most part of one’s Great Dao would be displayed for the world.

People who attained Dao had all blazed a path through all manners of obstacles and experienced countless hardships before they had today’s accomplishments.

Each person had their own non-transmissible secret.

Even if teaching apprentices, they would also hold something back.

The so-called teaching disciples would make the master starve to death. It was this logic[1].

Think about it, if your disciples are outstandingly talented and learned all of your things, and climbed on top of your head, what sort of feeling was that?

Unless it was someone who was about to pass on, otherwise, who would be willing to do this sort of thing?

But Ye Yuan did it!

The group of Heavenly Emperors was dumbstruck with amazement from listening, sucking in a cold breath.

How broadminded did one have to be to be able to do such a thing!

Ye Yuan’s action was to teach all life, his merits the greatest!

In the history of the Heavenspan World, there had never been such a selfish figure who existed.

But Ye Yuan did it!

Not only did he do it, he even made Sacred Ancestor High Priest do it too.

The reason why Ye Yuan came to find these Heavenly Emperors, it was because of their influence in the alchemy world.

In reality, he hoped for more people to come and listen to Dao.

Without a doubt, the stronger the human race’s alchemy path strength was, the stronger their confidence in contending with the divine race!

Some inklings of this could be seen from Originguard’s plan!

“Huhu, when I heard this news this old man was already stunned. But thinking about it, Ye Yuan’s present alchemy path realm is already not beneath this old man’s. Even he isn’t stingy, so how can this old man fall behind him?” Sacred Ancestor High Priest said with a laugh.

Heavenly Emperor Nao Hua’s expression turned somber and he said, “Second Sage as a human is able to make such an astonishing move! How can Nan Hua’s meager cultivation base be kept hidden? If you don’t look down on me, count Nan Hua in!”

“Count me in too!”

“Count me in!”

... ...

The Heavenly Emperors were infected by Ye Yuan’s breadth of mind and agreed one after another.

Ye Yuan’s way of doing things was indeed majestic. He was like that previously in the Cloudheart Realm battle and was also like this now.

In contrast, each and every one of them felt ashamed of their unworthiness.

Even though their Dao was nothing in front of Ye Yuan, but at this time they clearly could not fall behind others.

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said with a smile, “If the human race wins this battle, the world will definitely be everyone’s righteousness!”

Everyone repeatedly said dare not.

Now that Medicine Ancestor was missing, these two in front of them were the alchemy world’s summit.

With their bit of strength, how could they dare show off in front of two great ancestors?

... ...

The news swept throughout the entire alchemy world very quickly like the wind.

Cloudheart Realm’s alchemy path powerhouses were all elites among elites.

Even those like Empyrean Pilljade had to use connections before they could enter, the height of the threshold could be imagined.

And in the entire alchemy world, there were God knows how many alchemy path powerhouses.

Ye Yuan made no distinctions in teaching, as long as one was willing to come, they could come.

For some time, countless alchemy path powerhouses swarmed toward Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma.
