Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Address each other as brothers? Could it be because of the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation?” Ye Yuan suddenly gave birth to a trace of enlightenment and asked.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon nodded his head solemnly and said, “That’s right. It’s precisely because of the Saint Exalt Dao Tribulation! This exalt is a little better off than those two guys. But I’ve also pulled through two Saint Exalt Dao Tribulations! Even if I can make it through the third time, I’d definitely turn to ashes at the fourth time too! If I still don’t break through, I’m really going to die!”

Talking until the back, Saint Exalt Bull Demon could not resist letting out a long sigh.

Clearly, this Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation was very terrifying!

Saint Sovereign Heavens stood at the summit of this Rainclear Continent and were admired by thousands.

But Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses also had the troubles of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

One of them was this Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation!

Ye Yuan saw before sporadic records in the ancient books of the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

When one’s cultivation reached Saint Sovereign Heaven, it would trigger the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation.

Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulations had no fixed number. Some people went through it once every ten thousand years, some went through it once every 30 thousand years.

Of course, there were also some unlucky ones that would come every thousand years.

But Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation, each time was more terrifying than the last.

Very few people were able to tide over more than three times.

Of course, if your strength kept improving and you increased enough strength before the next Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation came, you would naturally be able to pass through it safely.

What was scary was that your strength remained stagnant.

Unfortunately, on Rainclear Continent, cultivating to Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm was naturally the end already.

Without the support of grade five heavenly pills, without heaven-defying cultivation methods, without astonishing fortuitous encounters, one would basically kick the bucket on the second or third Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation.

It was also precisely because of this that the Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses on Rainclear Continent would be so rare.

Otherwise, even if Saint Sovereign Heaven was hard to break through, there would always be some over the accumulation of time.

But the reality was that the Saint Sovereign Heavens on the entire Rainclear Continent added up, absolutely would not exceed ten fingers too!

“Huhu,?since Big Brother Bull Demon favors this younger brother, then it will be disrespectful for Ye Yuan to decline,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon was overjoyed when he heard that. Grabbing Ye Yuan’s hand excitedly, he said, “Good brother, from now on, your business is my business!”

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “Big Brother rest assured, this little brother still has some confidence in alchemy. Leave the matter of heavenly pills to me.”

The two exchanged a glance and laughed loudly.

Ye Yuan was also not block-headed, what a Saint Sovereign Heaven big brother would bring to him was too much!

Saint Exalt Bull Demon clearly understood this too. That was why he would acknowledge Ye Yuan this brother.

Even if he did not take action, the name of a Saint Sovereign Heaven’s brother could also let Ye Yuan obtain too much.

There was at least one thing, having acknowledged this big brother, Ye Yuan would not have any problems passing through the Myriad Demons Mountain and returning to the Five Great Heavenly Regions anymore.

Shuoyan who was by the side was completely dumbfounded.

They were still shouting and wrangling earlier. How did these two become brothers in a blink of an eye?

“Hang on! I just acknowledged Lord Saint Exalt as my master. Big Brother, you acknowledged Lord Saint Exalt as your big brother. Then what am I?” Shuoyan said with a confused look.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “To each his own! When you’re together with Big Brother, you naturally call him Master. When together with me, you naturally call me as big brother too.”

Shuoyan did not seem to have encountered such a complicated relationship before, nodding his head like he did not fully understand.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon was clearly very satisfied with this too.

He nodded and said with a smile, “As it ought to be!?Heh heh,?that old ape and big bird keep bragging every day about how incredible their disciples are! Shuoyan, you have to make a good showing for Master this time!”

Being able to make Saint Exalt Bull Demon say this, the old ape and big bird were naturally the other two Saint Exalt Heavens.

Shuoyan nodded and said, “Master rest assured. This disciple will live up to expectations! But before this, this disciple still has some personal affairs and needs to go back to the clan to settle. Master, please allow it.”

Talking up to here, Shuoyan’s eyes revealed a hint of fierceness.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he secretly nodded to himself.

This kid finally grew up!

He did not have the ambition to compete, but his nine older brothers united and forced him to become how he was now.

Although the current Shuoyan still had a childish air, his tiger dominance aura had already appeared.

Given time, he would definitely be the second Bright Tiger King.

Of course, in Ye Yuan’s view, his accomplishments would likely be even above Bright Tiger’s!

What kind of character was Saint Exalt Bull Demon? He saw through an inkling with just one glance and said with a nod,?“Mn,?let Big Yellow accompany you on the trip!”

Bringing the two people out of the cave, Big Yellow was currently standing obediently at one side, appearing very simple and honest.

“Big Yellow, this is my new sworn brother, Ye Yuan. From now on, you have to treat him with respect like a teacher. Understand?” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said coolly.

The old yellow bull’s bull eyes immediately became wide saucers, staring fixedly at Ye Yuan, as if he saw some monster.

He did not understand why Ye Yuan became Lord Saint Exalt’s brother with a sway of his figure after going in for a while?

One had to know, even a genius like Shuoyan could only become Lord Saint Exalt’s disciple too!

What capability did this boy have, to actually be able to become brothers with a Saint Exalt?

“Lord Saint Exalt, this …”

When Ye Yuan saw the big yellow bull’s wonderful expression, he found it amusing in his heart too.

But his face revealed a very furious expression, and he said with a cold smile, “Big Brother, I can’t bear his courtesy! Senior Big Yellow even said that this younger brother tried to emulate something beyond my ability and fell flat on my face just now, and I even nearly died twice at his hands!”

The moment Big Yellow heard, he immediately felt like he was struck by lightning.

He was definitely taking the blame for this!

One had to know, this was all Lord Saint Exalt’s order. He could not very well let Lord Saint Exalt receive the punishment, right?

The big yellow bull could only say, “This … Master Ye is lofty. It was all Big Yellow’s fault previously. Big Yellow apologizes to you here!”

Ye Yuan looked at Big Yellow and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Want me to forgive, sure. You promise me one thing and our scores are squared.”

Seeing the smile on Ye Yuan’s face that was up to no good, Big Yellow’s heart raced.

But at this time, he could not refuse it either.

At once, he could only nod. He said, “Master Ye, Your Excellency, please instruct.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said,?“Mn,?I’m just about to go to Bright Tiger King’s territory to take care of business. Let me ride you, and the grievances between us will be considered squared.”

The big yellow ox was an ox, but currently, his face practically became black as the bottom of a wok.

He was a dignified peak Jade Sovereign Heaven super expert. Yet, he was actually going to be ridden as a mount by a Limitless Sublime Heaven?

He knew that this matter could not be brushed over, but he did not expect that Ye Yuan would use this kind of method to take revenge on him!

By the side, Saint Exalt Bull Demon had an awkward face too.

But at this time, he naturally would not draw trouble onto himself and could only say, “Big Yellow, I’ll have to trouble you to make a trip! When you reach Bright Tiger’s territory, listen to Ye Yuan’s orders. That will do. Don’t make this expression. Letting Ye Yuan ride you will only be beneficial to you and won’t do you harm.”

Big Yellow had a flurry of curses run across his mind.

What was called only be beneficial and would not harm you?

He, a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, being ridden around, how would he still show his face in the territory in the future?

Wouldn’t those few old things mock him to death?

But regarding Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s words, he had no choice but to listen and could only say, “Yes, Big Yellow obeys!”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
