Chapter 2514: The Pride of Ants!

“Not bad. Developing a universe with a sword formation, it has quite the implication of Great Dao. This move is not bad.”

The blue-robed move nodded with a slight smile, making frivolous remarks about Ye Yuan’s Universe Sword Formation.

Facing such a powerful sword formation, he seemed to be in his own backyard, not caring at all.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he activated the sword formation fiercely!

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh?…

Countless sword light flashed, turning into streaks of rainbow, heading straight for the blue-robed youth.

However, the blue-robed youth did not have the intention of retaliating.

He just stood there quietly, waiting for the arrival of the countless sword lights.

In the next second, everyone was dumbfounded with shock! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Those terrifying sword lights, no matter from which angle, no matter how powerful, as long as they approached the blue-robed youth, they would all automatically change directions!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The ground, the void, all were directly bombarded by the sword lights until it was reduced to fragments.

But not a single sword light landed on the blue-robed youth’s body!

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted. His divine sense was actually unable to lock onto the blue-robed youth.

Once those sword lights arrived in front of the other party, they directly skidded out like skiing on a snowy day.

No matter how he tried to control it, he could not do so!

But the other party clearly did not do anything!

This means was simply inconceivable!

His heart shook wildly. It was really his first time encountering such a powerless battle.

Even back then in the Immortal Grove World, when he had not entered Divine Dao, he had never felt so powerless before too.

The opponent was too strong!

Strong until there was no opening to look for!

Strong beyond understanding!

Ye Yuan could not even fathom the other party’s means. So how to deal with him?

At this time, the blue-robed youth finally moved.

He extended a finger and tapped inside the sword formation just like that.

Boom!

In an instant, the sword formation collapsed with a loud bang.

Ye Yuan only felt a tremendous force transmit over, his chest seemingly being hit by a giant mountain, fresh blood spurting wildly as he flew out backward.

This was the power of one finger!

The entire world fell deathly silent.

Those powerhouses far away were collectively rendered speechless.

“I … Are my eyes failing me?”

“This is impossible! Lord Saint Azure is actually like a child in front of him!”

“Where in the world did he come from? How can he be so strong?”

… …

The impact that this scene brought to them was seriously too strong.

It was Ye Yuan’s first time displaying the Universe Sword Formation in front of everyone. But everyone could tell that this move fused together four great rules!

Compared to when battling the five ancestors alone previously, this move was more than a level stronger!

However, it was like a joke in front of the blue-robed youth!

One finger and it broke!

The Heavenspan World’s number one person was actually so weak in front of the blue-robed youth!

Only after retreating several miles away did Ye Yuan barely manage to stabilize his figure.

And the current him seemed to have crawled out of a pool of blood, seemingly wretched to the extreme from head to toe.

The blue-robed youth smiled and said, “I told you, our disparity is in life-order! You’re no different from them in my eyes. At the very most, you’re just a slightly stronger ant. That’s all. Dealing with you, one finger is enough.”

Ye Yuan’s breathing became labored, his opponent was seriously too strong.

However, his gaze was unprecedentedly firm.

“Your cocky appearance is really despicable! So what if ant? Do ants have to be toyed with in the palm of your hands? Ants have to be fish on your chopping board, life and death at your whims? Ants have to be at your mercy, being cruelly oppressed forever? Today, this Ye will tell you that ants … have dignity too!”

Ye Yuan strode out step by step, the imposing aura on his body becoming stronger and stronger.

Universe Sword Formation revolved without ceasing and already gradually underwent changes.

Dual Polarity Sword Formation!

Toward Ye Yuan’s fury, the blue-robed youth did not care at all. He still smiled and said, “What dignity do ants need??Huhu,?this changed sword formation is a little interesting! THIS, is Sword Dao, revealing the sharp edge, sword intent soaring to the sky! It’s just that ants will always be ants. Very soon, you’ll understand that your fury can’t change anything.”

Swoosh!

The moment Dual Polarity Sword Formation released, that swift and fierce sharp edge penetrated the firmament!

The entire world seemed to be trembling!

“Kill!”

Ye Yuan shouted fiercely, then urged the Dual Polarity Sword Formation frenziedly.

At this moment, there were only sword lights that filled the sky!

Chi! Chi! Chi!

Countless sword energy exploded in front of the blue-robed youth!

Under his fury, the power of the Dual Polarity Sword Formation was more than ten times stronger!

It was just that no matter how he controlled, his sword lights were unable to land on the blue-robed youth’s body.

But Ye Yuan discovered that his sword lights got a little closer to the blue-robed youth!

This discovery made him ecstatic with joy!

The other party was not invincible!

At least, one finger was not enough!

The chaos divine essence within his body gushed out, urging the sword formation frenziedly without heed for his life.

The power of the Dual Polarity Sword Formation was continuously superimposing!

His sword lights got closer and closer to the blue-robed youth, increasingly nearer.

“Really the wishful thinking of an ant!?Huhu,?do you think that this degree of attack can hurt me?”

The blue-robed youth smiled slightly and pointed a finger out again.

It was still one finger!

However, this poke could poke a hole in the sky!

A finger pointing out, an invisible force directly exploded with him as the base point.

“Conceal!”

“True Dragon Profound Armor!”

Ye Yuan roared repeatedly.

All of a sudden, the sword lights that covered the sky disappeared without a trace!

This finger landed directly on Ye Yuan’s body.

“Puhwark!”

Forcibly receiving a finger, Ye Yuan vomited large mouthfuls of blood.

But he did not take a single step back!

“Appear!”

The sword lights that covered the skies appeared once again!

Chi! Chi! Chi!

The sword lights were finally only an inch away from the blue-robed youth.

Just an inch short!

The blue-robed youth’s brows raised up, revealing a hint of surprise.

Following that, his finger turned into a palm, and the void shook!

Boom!

The sword lights that covered the sky could not bear it anymore and collapsed with a loud bang.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan could not withstand it, vomiting large mouthfuls of blood again.

Even if there was the True Dragon Profound Armor coupled with the perfect Nine Transformations Golden Body, forcefully receiving this finger, he almost died!

This finger was far too strong!

What was even scarier was that the blue-robed youth did not exert any effort at all!

A casual finger could seriously injure Ye Yuan and put him on the verge of death!

The blue-robed youth said coolly, “Not bad, a little interesting! As an ant, you can be sufficiently proud to be able to force me to use one hand! You have the qualification to know my name! Listen up. I’m called Jun Tian, and I am from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

It was as if Ye Yuan knowing his name was a supreme glory.

But Ye Yuan only had bitterness in his heart.

Proud?

He used his strongest attack and even forcibly received a finger at his own expense. In the end, it could only force him to use one of his hands.

This was humiliation!

“Now, you should know the disparity between us, right? Why haven’t you knelt down to receive the gift? This is the last chance!” Jun Tian’s tone was calm but exuded a majesty that brooked no refusal.

The powerhouses present all choked!

Lost all hope!

The Heavenspan World’s sovereign was actually too weak to stand up to a single blow!

Heavenspan World’s number one person, was actually only fit to be someone else’s servant!

Everyone shut their eyes painfully, feeling unprecedented humiliation.

“H-Huhu, hahaha?…”

Ye Yuan’s mouth was full of blood when he suddenly burst out laughing.

“Kneel my ass! Your Grandpa Ye will only die standing and will never kneel to live! So what if Heavenly Stratum powerhouse? If you have the capability, come and kill your Grandpa Ye!”
