“Do you believe it now?”

“I believe it!”

“So, eat it. This thing doesn’t have much effect on me.”

“Okay!”

Little Dragon Girl nodded her head like a rattle drum, swallowing the Vermillion Spirit Fruit in one bite.

A good thing like the Vermillion Spirit Fruit also had to depend on who used it.

Ye Yuan’s bloodline power was already the power of a true dragon to begin with. It naturally did not need the Vermillion Spirit Fruit to grow stronger.

Even if it could increase bloodline power after Ye Yuan ate it, it would be extremely limited too.

But, to Little Dragon Girl, or Youqing and the rest, the significance of this thing would be different!

Unconditionally promoting a segment of dragon qi, to them, these pseudo-dragons, who did not want it?

Seeing this scene, they were envious to the extreme.

Swallowing the Vermillion Spirit Fruit, the dragon qi on Little Dragon Girl’s body erupted at once.

Originally, Little Dragon Girl’s dragon qi already reached peak fifth segment.

Now, it directly rose to peak sixth segment!

Although there was no Dragon Qi Stone here, the increase in Little Dragon Girl’s dragon qi was visible to the naked eye! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Youqing and the rest were green with envy.

If the Vermillion Spirit Fruit was eaten by him, wouldn’t he be able to rival Little Dragon Girl?

But there were no ifs in this world.

Now, not only could he not rival Little Dragon Girl, he became even further from her instead.

“Stop watching. Go and play by yourselves. If you follow us, you guys won’t even have soup to drink,” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Youqing’s face turned black, feeling as awful as having eaten a fly.

He really could not refute these words.

“Consider yourself ruthless! Who will emerge victorious is not yet known! Don’t be complacent too early!” Youqing gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

“Huhu,?there’s really no need to be complacent with a pseudo-dragon like you! I think that you’re probably mistaken.” Ye Yuan replied nonchalantly.

Youqing gritted his teeth and said in a solemn voice, “Go!”

The Land of Dragon Slumber extended in all directions, there was naturally more than one path.

What lucky chances you could obtain, it completely depended on the individual’s luck and strength.

Primarily, what Ye Yuan said was right. They would really not even have soup to drink if they followed Ye Yuan!

Freaking hell, Ye Yuan was equivalent to being invincible here!

“Big Brother Youqing, are we dropping this matter just like this? I can’t swallow this insult!” Muchen said.

But Youqing sneered and said, “Do you really think that that boy is invincible?”

Muchen said in surprise, “Isn’t that so?”

Youqing smiled and said, “Of course not! As the saying goes, misfortune might be a blessing in disguise, and vice-versa! Being favored by the Land of Dragon Slumber, maybe the Land of Dragon Slumber needs his life as the price! No, it should be said that this possibility is very high! In a place like the Land of Dragon Slumber, the more smooth-sailing it is, the more one needs to be vigilant!?Heh,?this boy thinks that he’s formidable, but he doesn’t know that the mysterious power of this Land of Dragon Slumber has already had its eye on him!”

The moment Muchen and the rest heard, they immediately revealed looks of enlightenment.

“Brilliant! When you said this, it really is true! The more smooth-sailing he is now, the more likely something will happen to him at the back! Maybe, his life has already been reserved by the Land of Dragon Slumber! Even if he wants to run, he can’t run too!” Muchen smacked his thigh and said with a loud laugh.

Youqing nodded and said with a smile, “That’s right, it’s precisely so! Therefore, let’s just wait and watch the joke!”

When everyone heard that, they all nodded their heads.

As the seven great sea regions’ number one genius, Youqing was naturally not a stupid person.

The problem that Ye Yuan was worried about, he could imagine it too!

“Alright, finally managed to come in, we can’t waste the opportunity! Now, everyone acts on your own! Whoever has the last laugh is the real winner!” Youqing said coolly.

He brought three great Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, the majority of the dangers here, he could handle it.

Hence, he was a little more confident than the rest.

Along the way, Ye Yuan brought Little Dragon Girl, walking and stopping, obtaining a lot of benefits.

Of course, these benefits were really nothing to Ye Yuan.

Very soon, Little Dragon Girl’s bloodline power rose rapidly, almost reaching peak seventh segment!

But the deeper in, the stronger the summoning of that mysterious power.

Ye Yuan knew that he was not far from that mysterious power!

“Hehe,?Big Brother Ye Yuan, you’re really too incredible! The strange things in here all behave like they saw a ghost when they see you!” Little Dragon Girl giggled.

Ye Yuan’s face turned black, did this girl know how to talk or not?

But right then, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

Countless green lights suddenly appeared around them.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he yelled coldly, “Go away!”

But this time, it failed!

Those green lights grew more and more, completely drowning the two people.

By the time Ye Yuan came back to his senses, there was already no trace of Little Dragon Girl.

To be precise, he had arrived at an unknown place.

In this place, he could not see his fingers when he extended his hand. But the blood in his body completely started to feel aroused.

“I finally waited until you came!”

In the darkness, a voice suddenly came over, carrying a tiny hint of excitement.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “It was you who summoned me here?”

“That’s right!”

“Who on earth are you? What’s your goal of summoning me here?” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

“You don’t have to be afraid! I’m looking for you. It’s just to have you bring me home!” That voice said.

“Bring you home? Where is your home?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

“My home is in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven! I’m too lonely, too lonely here! I miss home!” That voice seemed extremely lonely.

Ye Yuan discerned his sentimentality for home from his voice.

“Why me?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

He already determined that this mysterious existence did not seem to have malice towards him. This also made his suspending heart relax.

Of course, the premise was that he did not reject the other party.

Ye Yuan could feel that going home was the other party’s obsession.

He picked Ye Yuan. But if he could not fulfill his wish, Ye Yuan did not dare guarantee what would happen.

Maybe everyone who came here for the expedition would die!

That voice said, “Because you’re a true dragon’s descendant! I’ve waited for several tens of thousands of years here, but have never come across with a true dragon before! If it’s not a true dragon, it will be impossible to pass through the barrier of heavens, and return to Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven! That lass is pretty good, but clearly, you’re more suitable!”

“Barrier of heavens?” Ye Yuan asked in puzzlement.

In reality, Ye Yuan only knew that this world was called 33 Heavens, but he completely did not know what the 33 Heavens was.

He had already arrived in this world for a number of years.

But, the place that he learned about, it was also limited to the the Rainclear Continent only.

And the Rainclear Continent seemed to only be a corner of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven too.

There was an even more vast world outside!

Just like Zhuo Bufan, his cultivation realm was already high until the Rainclear Continent could not keep him behind anymore.

That place no longer had anywhere that was worth him being reluctant to leave.

Therefore, it seemed inevitable that he went to an even more expansive region.

It was just that wanting to walk out of the Rainclear Continent was not an easy thing either.

But now, this mysterious existence actually wanted him to pass through the barrier of heavens!

This was much harder than going out of the Rainclear Continent.

It sounded like a huge challenge!
