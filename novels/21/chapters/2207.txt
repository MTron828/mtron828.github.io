Chapter 2211: Large Enemy Force Bearing down upon the Border

Emergence Spirit Ascension Pill, rank seven divine pill

After an Empyrean consumed it, it could improve cultivation, breaking through bottlenecks.

It was just a normal medicinal pill. However, a medicinal pill that had reached end spirit, it was no longer ordinary!

Lin Changqing was currently a Second Firmament Empyrean. With this Emergence Spirit Ascension Pill, Lin Changqing would not have any more obstacles all the way until he broke through to become a Fourth Firmament Empyrean.

Furthermore, this process would be greatly shortened!

With Lin Changqing’s talent, breaking through to become a Fourth Firmament Empyrean within a few thousand years was nothing difficult.

But with this medicinal pill, the process would be cut down by at least ten times!

This was also to say that Lin Changqing would break through to the Fourth Firmament Empyrean Realm within one to two centuries.

This kind of cultivation speed, when placed among those in the Empyrean Realm, it was simply fantastical!

Lin Changqing looked at Ye Yuan and was shocked until his jaw was almost hitting the ground.

“You ... You freak! How can there be a person like you in this world?” Lin Changqing said speechlessly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “With the abyss monsters and the Divine Race coming into being, I’m afraid that the world is about to be thrown into chaos. After you go back, you still have to warn Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple and let him build up strength. This is to prepare for unforeseen events. I’ve once heard before that a long time ago, an apocalyptic battle had once occurred before. I’m afraid that the crisis this time won’t be inferior to the Doomsday Battle!”

Lin Changqing was startled in his heart, his expression turning somber.

Regarding Doomsday Battle this term, it was clear that it was tragic to the extreme.

Probably when the time came, no one in the Heavenspan World could escape by sheer luck!

He nodded his head solemnly and said, “You rest assured. I’ll send the news back and let Master make preparations early. Rather, the problem is you. You’re a cripple now. What will you do?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, I have my own way. Being quiet here for these several decades, I have made some accomplishments.”

Lin Changqing’s gaze flickered slightly, startled in his heart.

Ye Yuan did not have the slightest signs of divine essence flowing in his body. It was clearly the symptom of a small world collapsing.

The small world was the lifeblood of a martial artist. Even if there was a trace of damage, the price paid would be tremendous too.

Considering Ye Yuan’s situation, it was likely that his small world had already nearly collapsed and was simply unable to accommodate divine essence anymore.

This kind of situation, this fellow had a way to restore it too?

Lin Changqing’s eyes revealed a half-dubious look.

“Alright, looking at your pathetic appearance, this Empyrean will give you a lift!” Lin Changqing’s mouth curled as he said.

Ye Yuan was not pretentious either, saying with a nod, “I’ll have to trouble you.”

His divine essence was completely lost currently, fleshy body yet to recover, a long journey would take great effort.

With Lin Changqing this Empyrean around, it was much more convenient.

“A’Ning!”

At this time, A’Xiu suddenly rushed out. Looking at Ye Yuan, her eyes were blurred with tears.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “A’Xiu, I’ve already recovered my memories. These few years, thank you so much for your and Grandpa Yan’s care! I’m called Ye Yuan, and I’m from the Southern Border’s Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. If we’re fated ... we’ll meet again.”

He and A’Xiu were ultimately not people of the same world.

Rather than clinging on obstinately, it was better to cut the Gordian knot.

Hence, even if there was a thousand unwillingness, Ye Yuan did not express it either.

A’Xiu could not hold back anymore, tears bursting out.

In the end, she could only nod her head. She said, chokingly, “Take care!”

Ye Yuan said goodbye to Chen Yan and the rest, and then he left together with Lin Changqing and Lu-er.

He had a score in his heart. The current Heavenly Eagle was likely long already in a complete mess!

... ...

The reality was not too far from what Ye Yuan expected.

With how vast the Southern Border was, there would always be some people who were well-informed.

The demon race’s Sacrificial Temple established the Second Sage. This matter caused a great sensation. Hence, the Southern Border naturally knew as well.

But later, they discovered that this Second Sage was actually the Ye Yuan who brought the entire Southern Border to its knees with his power alone back then!

This shock was by no means insignificant.

But several decades ago, another news came over that Ye Yuan’s died in the Middle Realms, and the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was a host of dragons without a leader.

With this, everyone’s thoughts started stirring.

In the Southern Border’s alchemy world, this was a huge piece of cake.

But at present, the largest share of this huge piece of cake was grasped in the hands of the Myriad Treasure Tower and the seven great ancient families.

These were two leviathans, the others did not dare to provoke.

However, the tiny Heavenly Eagle Imperial City became a fat piece of meat in everyone’s eyes currently.

Because among the three forces that grasped the pill formulas, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was the weakest.

The Southern Border Alliance began to cast covetous eyes toward Heavenly Eagle Imperial City with Empyrean Pilljade as the leader.

Fortunately, with Empyrean Flutterfeather’s protection, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City ultimately made it through many years.

But along with the passage of time, the news of Ye Yuan’s demise was confirmed. Many discordant voices also appeared within the Myriad Treasure Tower. Empyrean Flutterfeather’s pressure grew greater and greater.

After all, no matter how strong Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure was, he was also just one of the Southern Border’s many Heavenly Emperors.

With the other Heavenly Emperors joining hands to apply pressure, he also had no choice but to be wary.

Hence, these few years, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City began to fall into a precarious situation.

At this time, inside Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, everyone was jittery.

Above the top of city walls, Bai Tong brought everyone in Heavenly Eagle, his expression being solemn.

In the distance, countless black dots were currently closing in here rapidly.

Bai Tong secretly sighed and said, “Looks like that kid can’t make it in time! I just don’t know if he’s still alive or not.”

That kid he was talking about was naturally Ye Yuan.

“His Excellency definitely won’t die!” Ning Tianping said with a firm look.

Bai Tong smiled bitterly and said, “Whether or not he’s dead, I don’t know. How to pass this hurdle today? Empyrean Pilljade brought the entire Southern Border’s alchemy world, and they came in a threatening manner. With this, Heavenly Eagle will likely face a catastrophic calamity!”

The other people’s faces turned deathly pale, all having looks of despair on their faces.

After being in a stalemate for several decades, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure finally still maintained silence under the pressure of the various parties.

Hence, today, the Southern Border Alliance with Empyrean Pilljade as the leader, came bearing down upon the border in a large force!

How fast was the speed of the group of Empyreans? They arrived in an instant.

Empyrean Pilljade was high up above. Looking down at everyone below, he said with a cold smile, “Back then, that kid wreaked havoc at the Cloudpill Summit. He was so arrogant and domineering! He probably never dreamed that Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would experience this today, right?”

By the side, the Empyrean Proudcloud who was once forced into a hopeless situation by Ye Yuan laughed loudly and said, “That punk was arrogant and domineering, looking down on everything and everyone. He didn’t place us, these seniors, in his sights at all! This kind of person, dying outside is something sooner or later! Today, we’ll eradicate Heavenly Eagle Imperial City and take the pill formulas. This Southern Border will be our Southern Border Alliance’s world again!”

Empyrean Pilljade nodded slightly. These few years, he had also spent it heavily oppressed.

But today, he was going to gain back all the ground!

He, Empyrean Pilljade, was still the Southern Border’s number one Empyrean!

Empyrean Pilljade looked down and said in a clear voice, “Yi-er, come here!”

The Yi-er that he was talking about was naturally the Yun Yi who took Ye Yuan as his master.

For so many years, he let Yun Yi do as he wished. It was actually in order to obtain Ye Yuan’s trust.

These few years, Yun Yi’s status in Heavenly Eagle was extremely high and already took charge of the Pill Tower. He was one of the leaders of Heavenly Eagle.

Pilljade was clear in his heart that Yun YI must have already grasped the secret of the pill formulas.

Everything was within his scheme.

At this time, everyone’s gazes focused on Yun Yi.

“Heh heh, Ye Yuan that brat is a fool! Empyrean Pilljade’s great-grandson, he actually put him in an important position!”

“Isn’t that so! If it were me, I’d have long chased him away!”

“I heard that Yun Yi improved at an incredible speed these few years and already reached the middle-stage Dao Realm! Furthermore, he must have grasped some pill formulas’ secrets!”

... ...

Quite a number of people were whispering with each other at Pilljade’s side.
