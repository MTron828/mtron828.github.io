1495 Issuing Letter of Challenge

You Ming looked at Ye Yuan helplessly and was really at a loss whether to cry or laugh.

In Capone Capital City, who did not wet their pants when they saw him?

Yet, today, he was cornered tightly by a brat still wet behind his ears. He did not even have the qualifications to lose his temper.

If it were other people, he would use powerful strength to oppress his opponent and could use various means to go and threaten his opponent.

But against Ye Yuan, these were all useless!

Threaten?

It would only make matters develop in an even worse direction!

You Ming let out a sigh and said, “Whatever conditions, Sir Source Night feel free to state them. As long as my Assassination Hall can do it, we definitely won’t refuse.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze looked at You Ming sharply and said, “Really?”

You Ming smiled bitterly and said, “Do I have a choice?”

Ye Yuan smiled too. Talking with wise people was effortless.

“I want you to help me issue a letter of challenge!” Ye Yuan said.

You Ming’s brows furrowed and he said, “You want to have a battle with Ka Xin? You’re not his match!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Not his match or not, that’s my business. You just have to help me do two things. and that will do.”

You Ming’s expression became intent and he said, “What two things?”

You Ming discovered that Ye Yuan did not have his blood rushing up to his head at all. He was not mindlessly trying to find Ka Xin and take revenge without any plan.

That indifferent expression of Ye Yuan was clearly him having a well-thought-out plan.

In fact, even You Ming coming to apologize had also been calculated.

Ye Yuan had long already thought of everything and was just waiting for him to pay a visit.

This young man was truly too frightening!

This move of borrowing power to strike another person actually toyed with the Blood Yama Hall’s several major halls in the palm of his hands. It was simply inconceivable.

Of course, all of this was in view of Ye Yuan’s own powerful strength and potential. Otherwise, those two great hall masters were not fools either. How could they possibly be manipulated by Ye Yuan?

He finally somewhat understood why those two great halls would view this young man in a different light and even wanted to defend this young man without balking at falling out with him.

Ye Yuan took out a small bag of medicinal powder and said, “This packet, let Ka Xin eat it unknowingly. This shouldn’t be a difficult thing for your Assassination Hall, right?”

You Ming’s expression changed and he immediately said, “No way! Although the Blood Yama Hall doesn’t fear the City Lord Manor, poisoning the City Lord Manor’s prince to death is a serious matter. I can’t promise you!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Hall Master, you don’t need to be so agitated. This packet of powder won’t take his life and it doesn’t affect his strength in the slightest too. He won’t discover that he’s poisoned. I’m just leaving myself a way out.”

You Ming’s brows furrowed and he said, “How do I believe you? What if you borrow a knife to kill someone?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I still have another packet here. If you don’t believe me, you can try it. But you have to be mentally prepared, this thing is effective toward you too.”

You Ming was startled inwardly, a hint of dread flashing across his eyes.

Something that a Two-star Fiend Apothecary refined was actually effective on him too?

This tiny packet of powder actually was such a great threat!

One had to know, the medicinal pills that Two-star Fiend Apothecaries refined, the effect on Fiend Commanders were negligible, let alone say You Ming, this kind of grand completion realm Fiend Commander.

You Ming knew that Ye Yuan was a very formidable Fiend Apothecary. Saying this was absolutely not in order to scare him.

Only if he went soft in the head would he go and try this thing.

Although he did not know what effect this thing had, to Ka Xin, it was definitely a fatal thing!

Seeing You Ming’s expression, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This packet is just in order to ensure that he and I battle under a fair condition. As long as he eats it, absolutely no one will know that it was done by you guys.”

You Ming’s brows knitted tightly. He was silent for quite a while. Suddenly, he nodded and said, “Okay, I can promise you! I believe that you won’t do something like digging your own grave! What about the second?”

You Ming thought about it for a little. Ye Yuan borrowing a knife to kill, causing two major forces to confront each other, this did not have any benefits. It would put him in a dangerous situation instead.

Ye Yuan was clearly a very smart person and would not do this kind of stupid thing.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The second thing, ten months later, you personally help me go and issue a challenge letter! After a year, I want to fight with Ka Xin to the death!”

You Ming said, “You’re underestimating Ka Xin too much! His strength is close to invincible in the Fiend General Realm! For him to be able to stand out among so many of the Ka Family’s juniors, it isn’t an undeserved reputation! You aren’t even Huo En’s match. Could it be that you have the assurance to beat Ka Xin within a year?”

Just now, Ye Yuan himself also said it, this packet of medicinal powder would not affect Ka Xin’s strength.

Then, on what basis would he win against Ka Xin?

Even though Huo En was a capable subordinate under You Ming and his strength was extraordinary, when facing Ka Xin head-on, there was no chance of victory at all.

Ka Xin’s strength was the number one person in Capone Capital City’s Fiend General Realm!

This point, no one had any objections.

Ye Yuan smiled, but he did not speak and did not answer to You Ming’s words.

You Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said, “Okay, these two conditions, I promise it! But, if the fire burns onto the Blood Yama Hall in the end, you know the consequences!”

Finished talking, You Ming took that packet of powder and left straight away.

After You Ming left, Ye Yuan went straight into closed-seclusion.

A year’s time was ten years to Ye Yuan!

If it were others, ten years would not change too much either. But Ye Yuan could.

After consuming the Second Transformation Profound Gold Pill, Ye Yuan’s fleshy body directly broke through to themiddle-stage second transformation.

Then, Ye Yuan started refining medicinal pills frenziedly.

Ten months later in the outside world, Ye Yuan’s divine sea trembled, finally breaking through to the late-stage Heaven Glimpse Realm!

“Uh ... there’s still one year plus, after I consolidate my realm a bit, I should enter the Death Cultivation Space to train for a bit,” Ye Yuan murmured.

...

You Ming’s arrival caught Ka Xin by great surprise.

“You’re representing Source Night to issue a challenge letter to me?” A hint of a disdainful smile flashed across Ka Xin’s mouth.

You Ming said coolly, “Yes. He’s afraid that you’ll refuse his challenge, so he requested me to come.”

Regarding Ka Xin, You Ming did not have any favorable impression too.

This matter originally had nothing to do with the Assassination Hall. Because of Ka Xin posting a reward, it dragged the Assassination Hall right into the water, making him lose a general.

This result made You Ming very annoyed.

Therefore, he was actually very unhappy with both Ye Yuan and Ka Xin. If any of them died, his mood would be much better.

This battle was undoubtedly a channel to vent to him.

Ka Xin laughed loudly and said, “Refuse? Why would I refuse? Hahaha, a fool who overestimates his own strength, delivering himself to the door to seek death. This prince is more than happy. Looks like this ten month’s time, his strength had a breakthrough!”

Ka Xin was not afraid of challenges. On the contrary, he had already not received a challenge for very long.

His identity of a prince was not simply inherited but was piled up by countless fresh blood!

The fiend race did not restrict challenges. The City Lord Manor’s prince was also no exception!

Wanting to become the City Lord Manor’s prince, one had to accept the challenges from all parties.

Ka Xin was not a silkpants leading a comfortable life, but a true powerhouse!

Of course, not anybody could challenge Ka Xin. He had the right to refuse.

It was precisely because of this that Ye Yuan requested You Ming to step forward to apply pressure.

Ye Yuan was expressing an attitude: the matter of you hiring people to kill me, I already know. The grudge between us is already irreconcilable and can only be resolved with a fight!

This was the simplest and most crude way to resolve problems in the fiend race!
