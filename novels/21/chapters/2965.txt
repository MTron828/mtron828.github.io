Chapter 2964: Blessing in the Disguise of Misfortune!

These Hegemons were all clear that being able to hang on with one breath and not die, there must be some unfulfilled wishes.

Just like mortals, when lying in a coma, if they had any unfulfilled wishes, they would refuse to shut their eyes no matter what.

Hegemon Imperishable knew that the current Ye Yuan was in far too much hardship.

Therefore, this requiem was to help him be free.

But, the one who spoke was him, Hegemon Imperishable!

The perception between Enshrouding Mist Soul Physiques was completely ignited at this moment.

Hegemon Imperishable’s voice was hope to Ye Yuan!

Actually, the current Ye Yuan already had little consciousness.

But Hegemon Imperishable’s Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was like a clap of thunder, exploding in his last strand of consciousness.

What was his obsession?

Wasn’t it to meet Hegemon Imperishable and borrow the Purple Ripple Umbrella?

The resonance between Enshrouding Mist Soul Physiques made the Ye Yuan, who was in the chaos, instantly find the lighthouse, finding the direction home.

The four great Supreme Hegemons were all struck senseless.

“What’s going on here? Old Ghost Imperishable, what kind of trickery did you do? This kid actually came back to life again?” Hegemon Evil Dragon said with shock all over his face.

Hegemon Imperishable himself also had a stunned look and said, “This seat didn’t do anything! I just saw that he was in too much suffering, and let him be free with a requiem sound. This … I don’t know what’s going on either.”

While Hegemon Heavenly Soul said with a strange look, “Really seeing ghosts! You helped to appease his soul; not only was he not freed, his consciousness became increasingly stronger instead!?Mn??He’s starting to control the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!”

“His Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique unconsciously comprehended origins in so many origins. Origin seeds have probably already been planted in his soul body. When his realm is reached, these origin seeds will take root and germinate! This was simply a massive lucky chance for him!” When speaking, Hegemon Evil Dragon was even somewhat jealous.

Ye Yuan’s situation, if he died, everything was naturally over.

But not dying, then the benefits would be unimaginable to him.

The Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was born from chaos to begin with. It was extremely sensitive to origins.

Under a conscious state, the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was limited by individual talent, and the comprehension would be limited in the end.

But, under an unconscious state, the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was completely comprehending origins on instinct.

Finally, Ye Yuan’s soul body condensed and formed again. He also felt his own soul body’s chances.

Inside this Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, there seemed to be many origin powers that appeared correct but were really wrong.

His realm had not reached yet. This response was very blurry.

But he knew that the power of each origin was extremely precious.

Origins could not be comprehended because you wanted to?

For a Great Dao, only by cultivating the power of rules to the realm of grand completion could one have the chance to comprehend origin.

Ye Yuan’s Dao was not yet perfect. He did not have too clear an understanding of these origin powers.

But the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique recorded the ‘sensations’ of these origins in his body.

Ye Yuan could find the direction of Great Dao by following these ‘sensations.’

This was equivalent to saying that each Great Dao had a beacon light!

To Ye Yuan, cultivation would naturally yield twice the results with half the effort.

“I didn’t expect that I actually had a blessing come to me in the disguise of misfortune. Hegemon Imperishable wanted to help me be free. But he didn’t expect that it would actually let me grab the last strand of life-saving straw. The matters of the world are indeed hard to predict,” Ye Yuan said ruefully.

He knew how dangerous his previous state was.

If it was anyone else, it would have been impossible to reawaken his consciousness too.

Converging his mind, Ye Yuan did not remain anymore and continued deeper in.

The surrounding origins became more and more, but it was already inconsequential to Ye Yuan.

His realm was limited, and the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was already satiated. It was impossible to absorb more origins.

Following the direction of Hegemon Imperishable’s voice, Ye Yuan chased after.

Along the way, there were scenes of desolation!

Clearly, the four great Supreme Hegemons had experienced an extremely horrifying battle.

“Heh,?interesting. This boy really came over to find you! He came in together with that girl. It’s probably for the sake of you, Old Ghost Imperishable, right? A human brat, wonder what goal he has,” Hegemon Evil Dragon said with a strange laugh.

Ye Yuan’s paltry cultivation realm naturally could not deceive these Supreme Hegemons.

Actually, as soon as he entered the God Bewildering Battlefield, the four great Hegemons could see through it.

Therefore, with regards to Ye Yuan’s life and death, they all did not care too much, inclusive of Hegemon Imperishable.

“After he comes, wouldn’t we know then,” Hegemon Imperishable said coolly.

Along the way, he did not encounter any dangers.

Whatever danger was gone after the four great Supreme Hegemons’ battle too.

Ye Yuan raised his head to look at the sky and saw a blue-colored giant dragon hovering at the horizon, an enormous blood lake, and also a big and tall celestial deity!

But these three were bogged down in a mass of enshrouding mist.

Without a doubt, these were the four great Supreme Hegemons.

However, Ye Yuan saw a large purple umbrella in this region of mist.

The purple-colored halo emitted by that large umbrella made the misty air shine purple.

When Ye Yuan saw it, his entire body could not help trembling!

There was no doubt that it was the Purple Ripple Umbrella!

“Human brat, don’t tell this seat that you’re here to save Old Ghost Imperishable,” Evil Dragon said with a smile that was not a smile.

Having his identity be seen through, Ye Yuan was not surprised and said with a nod, “What Senior said is right. I’m here to save Hegemon Imperishable.”

“Hahaha?… Get lost! Just based on your bit of strength, it’s still far lacking!” Evil Dragon said with a loud laugh.

To the four great Supreme Hegemons, Ye Yuan was just a little bug.

Puff a breath of air and he would be gone.

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Seniors, let it go. Your plan has already completely failed.”

The moment these words came out, the three people stiffened up noticeably.

Bloodsong smiled coldly and said, “A mere Emperor Cloud Heaven also dares to engage in wild talks in front of this seat! Do you not believe that this seat will exterminate you right now?!”

“I don’t believe it!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Hegemon Bloodsong, if you had this ability, would you still talk rubbish with an ant like me here? Therefore, the three of you can only take a beating from me now.”

The title of Supreme Hegemon was indeed scary, but it would also depend on who you were scaring.

It looked like these three people were seemingly joining hands to deal with Hegemon Imperishable currently.

Actually, Ye Yuan had long seen through. These four people had reached a delicate balance.

Whoever broke this equilibrium, the outcome would definitely be very miserable.

At this point, the only way was for the four people to pull back at the same time.

Sure enough, the moment Ye Yuan said it, the expressions of the three great Hegemons became ugly to the extreme.

A little bug actually dared to swagger and bluster in front of them!

“I really underestimated you, this brat! Pretty good eyesight! But do you think that based on your strength, you can cause any harm to us?” Evil Dragon said disdainfully.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Maybe I can!”

Evil Dragon laughed loudly when he heard that and said,?“Hahaha,?then you come and try it, see if you can scratch your Lord Dragon’s itch!”

“Mn,?you wait for a moment.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan nodded his head in earnest, but he cast Evil Dragon to one side and said to Hegemon Imperishable, “Hegemon Imperishable, I want to borrow the Purple Ripple Umbrella!”
