Chapter 2416: Based on That . . . I’m Saint Azure!

Those present, the leaders of the myriad races opened their mouths wide one after another, looking at this scene in astonishment.

Long Yi was a top Deva Fifth Blight powerhouse, his strength being unfathomable.

Among these various races’ major powers, he was absolutely a top existence!

No one could have thought that he actually extended such solemn respects to a junior!

What they did not expect even more was that the young Ye Yuan was actually even the Dragon Clan’s samsara progenitor!

The stone race leader and a few others who spoke coldly just now were frightened until they almost bit their tongues off.

A few words of cynicism to a junior was no big deal.

But offending the dragon race’s progenitor with words, that was being enemies with the entire Dragon Clan.

If they really angered the Dragon Clan, no one would gain anything good out of it.

One had to know, the Dragon Clan’s strength was a top existence when looking at the myriad races as a whole too.

Let alone that the eight great supreme demon races had always been of the same breath and branch.

Sure enough, Long Yi’s eyes turned dark and he said, “Shi Potian slighted Samsara Progenitor with his words. It’s a provocation towards our Dragon Clan! If Progenitor feels that it was inappropriate, the Dragon Clan will wage war with the stone race right now!”

These words were said with decisiveness that could chop iron, making the powerhouses present involuntarily feel a chill.

They could tell that Long Yi was not joking, and he was not fawning on Ye Yuan.

As long as Ye Yuan said a word, he would really go to war!

Shi Potian had an awkward look and hurriedly said, “Brother Long Yi, just now ... just now, this Shi didn’t know Lord Progenitor’s identity and didn’t have the intention.”

Long Yi smiled coldly and said, “Whether you did it on purpose or unintentionally, offending Progenitor is a fact!”

Just as Shi Potian was in a dilemma, Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Forget it, it’s no big deal. The plan now is still placing priority on uniting!”

He looked towards Shi Potian and said coolly, “Didn’t you wanted to know why the divine race dispatched a massive force? Let me tell you, I went to the divine race’s Grant Bright Mountain Camp, and I captured someone back.”

“What?! You went to Grant Bright Mountain Camp? A-Alone?”

“Grant Bright Mountain Camp has several dozen Nine-marks powerhouses garrisoning! Even if a Deva Third Blight went, there’s no return too!”

“Lord Progenitor, you ... you’re joking, right?”

... ...

The moment these words came out, the crowd burst into an uproar!

Ye Yuan rushing into the enemy camp alone and abducted someone away from under the eyelids of countless experts.

This sort of thing, no one would believe no matter what.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said with a smile, “Don’t ask me whether it’s real or fake. I can’t prove it to you. If you really want to know, you can go ask Yu Qin on the battlefield, I think that he will tell you guys.”

The group of progenitors exchanged glances, the gazes that at Ye Yuan were full of suspicion.

Even Long Yi, Ni Xuan, and the rest were dumbstruck with shock when they heard this.

Just as everyone was shocked, Bai Chen suddenly said, “Although this sounds fantastical, looking back at it, doesn’t this answer precisely the reason why the divine race launched a full-scale war? I think that in Daymeld’s eyes, the importance of Lord Progenitor has already surpassed the war itself! What they are afraid of isn’t us, but someone who can become Tian Qing’s opponent appearing!”

Everyone was speechless.

Yeah, if they had to give the divine race a reason for suddenly starting a war, wasn’t it just right?

The unpredictable army defeating the Divine Children Legion, no matter how miraculous it spread, it was also the strength of the collective.

How strong Ye Yuan was, it was hard to say.

But concerning Ye Yuan rushing into Grant Bright Mountain Camp all by himself and abducted someone back, that was something completely different.

If they were Daymeld, wouldn’t they feel fear toward this genius?

The answer was definitely! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ni Xuan smiled bitterly and said, “Pang Zhen said that you went to chase after a divine race member, I even thought that you didn’t catch up. I didn’t expect that you actually went to tour around Grant Bright Mountain Camp!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course, I’m not here to show off this to you all, but here to tell you all that ... this battle, we have to fight!”

Silence was restored in the camp again.

The topic returned to the beginning, when it concerned the interests of the myriad races, everyone was silent.

This was not something that the title of a progenitor could suppress.

With regards to this kind of awkward situation, Ye Yuan had long expected it. He just said coolly, “Let me ask you guys, what does the divine race fear most about us?”

Everyone was still silent. In order to avoid embarrassment, Ni Xuan spoke up, “Is it ... Dao Ancestors?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Nay! What they fear most, is the myriad races’ numbers! Just the human race, our population is thousands of times than theirs! Even if we use numbers to pile on, we’ll also crush them to death! Therefore, ever since the divine race emerged from the Abyss Suppressing Eight Realms, places that they passed through, not even chickens or dogs were spared!”

“Let me ask you all again, after retreating to the Middle Realms and the divine race army continuing advancing, what do you all plan to do?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was scorching, sweeping across everyone’s faces. Everyone did not dare to meet his gaze at all.

The answer was very clear, they planned on continuing to retreat!

Not that they could not see the situation clearly, but that these people were all harboring hopes of getting lucky.

If the sky fell, wasn’t there still the human race to prop it up?

But these people did not know about the cruelty of the last epoch at all!

That period of history had been sealed in dust for too long!

Even if it was mentioned now, they would still feel that there were elements of exaggeration.

Ye Yuan beamed and said, “The divine race army will charge all the way towards the Middle Realms! There will come a day when they will charge into your clans! You all don’t use this kind of eyes to look at me. In the last Doomsday Battle, the divine race was at a disadvantage because of numbers! So this time, they definitely won’t make the same mistake again! They just need to keep on killing and killing, until one day, we discover that our numbers are already insufficient to deal with them, and it would be too late to repent!”

Got to admit, Ye Yuan’s words were very convincing.

It was just that this was still not enough!

Shi Potian said in a solemn voice, “Lord Saint Azure, not every member of the race has your combat power! If we wage a full-scale war, we aren’t the divine race’s match at all!”

“Yeah, we’ve fought with the divine race before, and we were defeated in a few rounds. We already suffered heavy casualties!”

Shi Potian’s words represented the thoughts of the various races’ leaders.

The most fundamental reason why they did not dare to confront the enemy, was still that the divine race’s strength was too strong!

Ye Yuan saw that the timing was about right and said smilingly, “If I can bring you all to victory?”

These words did not stir up much waves. Instead, Shi Potian smiled disdainfully and said, “Lord Saint Azure, I know that you’re outstandingly talented! But a battle of this magnitude isn’t a battle with individuals! Even if you yourself fall into the enemy’s formation, you’ll definitely die too! What are you basing on to bring us to victory?”

Ye Yuan grinned and said proudly, “Based on that ... I’m Saint Azure!”

“Hahaha ... Us calling you Lord Saint Azure is looking on the account of Lord Profound Secrets’s face! Calling you Samsara Progenitor is looking on the account of Brother Long Yi’s face! But, just based on this name, you want to make our entire clans work themselves to the bone for you?” Shi Potian laughed loudly and said.

Not that he was arrogant, but making him bet the lives of his entire race, he was not willing!

In his eyes, Ye Yuan was simply too ridiculous!

A mere ‘Saint Azure’ two words and he wanted so many people to sell their souls for him?

But Ye Yuan was indifferent, replying tirelessly neither too fast nor too slowly.

The more he talked, the more shocked the expressions on everyone’s faces were!

Until the end, everyone’s eyes became brighter and brighter, and even revealed looks of excitement!

Very clearly, they were moved by Ye Yuan!
