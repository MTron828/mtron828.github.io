Chapter 1867: Empyrean Abode’s True Colors

“G-Gave to you?” Xu Xing opened his eyes wide, a look of disbelief.

Four Symbols true blood, this kind of massive lucky chance, would actually be given to others with two hands?

Not just Xu Xing, the others also looked at Ye Yuan with stunned faces.

This guy was also too extravagant in order to chase after a girl, right?

Quite a number of people looked at Leng Qiuling, all envious to the extreme.

They only hated that they did not have Leng Qiuling’s looks and let Ye Yuan gift this massive lucky chance to them. How great would that be!

Obtaining the Vermilion Bird true blood was not just increasing cultivation so simple. That was equivalent to cleansing the martial artist’s marrows anew, letting the martial artist have greater room for improvement in the future.

Especially for peerless geniuses like Xu Xing and Leng Qiuling, they even had a chance of stepping into the realm of Empyrean in the future!

That realm was a legendary existence, who would not be moved?

Leng Qiuling nodded and said, “Without Ye Yuan, even if I knew where the Vermilion Bird true blood was, it’s also impossible to obtain it.”

Ji Xun’s gaze locked onto Ye Yuan firmly, gnashing his teeth in hatred.

Everyone did not discover that the blazing sun in the sun was the real Vermilion Bird true blood, so why was he able to discover it?

Ji Xun learned from Empyrean Devilfeather there that the blazing sun in the sky was the real Vermilion Bird true blood. Originally, he still harbored great hopes, thinking that no one would discover it.

But sadly, when he came out from underground, he discovered that that blazing sun in the sky was long gone.

The sky was still that sky, but the Vermilion Bird true blood was not around anymore. This made him practically go insane.

“Je je, this boy is rather interesting! The concealment of the Vermilion Bird true blood can be said to be highly ingenious. Everyone can see it, everyone is under its illumination, but ... it’s simply impossible for there to be people who would think that the sun on top of their heads was actually the Vermilion Bird true blood. But this boy did it!’ Empyrean Devilfeather said with a strange laugh.

Empyrean Devilfeather was still suppressed by Ji Xun in the end. But Ji Xun was not able to exterminate him too and could only seal him up, not giving him the chance to recover.

But when Empyrean Devilfeather saw Ye Yuan, he became greatly interested.

“Humph! No matter how extraordinary he is, it’s also hard to escape death in the end!” Ji Xun said with a cold snort.

Empyrean Devilfeather laughed and said, “Heh, have you ever thought that this boy might be hiding an even greater secret on him?”

Ji Xun’s mind stirred, but he still said disdainfully, “No matter how great the secret on him is, can it be bigger than Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s treasures?”

Empyrean Realm also said, “That’s true. Back then, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove nearly almost broke through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor. Lord Jiu Shang was even a magnitude worse compared to him.”

On this side, Xu Xing could not quite maintain his expression anymore.

He was still just pledging in all solemnity, saying that Ye Yuan was an ant and did not have a great destiny. But in a blink of an eye, his face was slapped resoundingly.

Ye Yuan obtained the Vermilion Bird true blood and gave it straight to Leng Qiuling.

He, Xu Xing, obtained the White Tiger true blood but chose to refine it himself.

Now, he ran over to say whatever you and I both have great destinies, this was simply performing a slapstick.

Feeling those strange gazes from all around, Xu Xing wished to find a hole in the ground to tunnel into.

Ji Kang also looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly. Nodding his head, he said to Leng Qiuling, “Since that’s the case, then let’s get started?”

Leng Qiuling nodded slightly, leaping up and flying in front of the Door of Vermilion Bird.

Xu Xing and the other two people also flew in front of their respective doors. Apart from Xu Xing, the other two were both True God Realm itinerant cultivators.

But the True God Realm powerhouses on the Thousand Soar Alliance’s side were empty-handed.

The four people revolved the bloodline power within their bodies. Immediately, four enormous Four Symbols phantoms emerged in the air.

Four roars echoed out, those four phantoms tunneled straight into the Four Symbols doors.

Inside the Four Symbols doors, four beams of light emitted, colliding together fiercely.

Rumble!

A massive stone door condensed and formed in the valley.

On the stone door, an archaic aura that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life exuded, stirring people’s souls.

Even those True God powerhouses were all incomparably rattled too.

The aura inside this stone door was not what they could contend with at all.

Seeing this stone door, Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted.

“This aura, could it be ...”

Dustless also had a look of surprise and said with a nod, “Most likely, you guessed correctly! What in the world does this old fogey want to do?”

The others naturally would not pay attention to Ye Yuan. All of them had their attention drawn by this stone door.

“Haha, after this stone door opens, it definitely contains countless treasures! Come on!”

Finally, someone could not hold back the excitement in their hearts and sped over toward the stone door.

With someone leading the way, how could these people still endure it, all flying toward the stone door crazily?

Leng Qiuling’s figure floated down but discovered that Ye Yuan’s expression was very ugly.

“Ye Yuan, what’s wrong with you?” Leng Qiuling asked curiously.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Nothing, let’s go in too.”

The scene before their eyes changed. The group of powerhouses arrived in another mountain range.

“What is this place?”

“That stone door just now seems to be the entrance to a small world!”

“Could it be that ... this place is Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s small world?”

“Heh, it’s likely the case! If one can find Immortal Grove’s Dao Fruit here, that’s truly soaring to the heavens in one bound!”

...

These martial artists were not fools either, realizing something very quickly.

Ye Yuan looked at the scene before his eyes and could not help heaving a heavy sigh.

The thing that he was most afraid of indeed still happened.

This place was none other than precisely the Immortal Grove World!

This place, Ye Yuan was too familiar.

This place that they were at right now was precisely the Godsfall Mountain Range!

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove connected his own small world to that stone door. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The aura of that stone door was practically identical to the World Locking Gate. Ye Yuan recognized it with one glance.

Ye Yuan did not know what Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was trying to do. But so many Celestial Deities, even True God powerhouses entering the Immortal Grove World. Once a great battle occurred, the people would likely be plunged into an abyss of suffering!

To these martial artists, a small world counted for nothing at all.

But, this place was his, Ye Yuan’s hometown, the place that he grew up in.

“Ye Yuan, what’s wrong with you? Your expression is very ugly!” Leng Qiuling asked concernedly.

She discovered that ye yuan’s entire state was rather off starting from just now.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “I’m fine. You should follow City Lord Gu first. I have some matters and need to leave for a while. I’ll come and find you guys again later.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan did not wait for Leng Qiuling to agree either, his figure moving and vanishing on the spot.

Ji Xun’s attention had always been on Ye Yuan. When he saw Ye Yuan leave, he originally planned on chasing after.

But in a blink, he lost Ye Yuan’s traces. This made him greatly shocked in his heart.

“Je je ... really wearing out iron shoes in a fruitless search and finding it by chance without even looking for it! Didn’t expect, didn’t expect that we actually arrived at Old Fart Immortal Grove’s small world! That thing is likely here too, right?” Empyrean Devilfeather laughed strangely as he said.

Ji Xun’s heart stirred and he asked, “That thing? What thing?”

Something that could move a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse definitely would not be an ordinary object.

Empyrean Devilfeather gave a cold laugh and said, “You’d best not have designs on it. That’s something that Lord Jiu Shang wants. If you dare to touch it, you should know the consequences.”

Ji Xun’s expression changed and he fell silent.
