Chapter 1480 Lost Face, Right?

In front of Ka Xin, eight treasures were placed.

Each article was a very rare item.

“These eight treasures will only be awarded to those three people ranked first! After everyone settles on the people going on the field, they are not to substitute. If they are defeated, they can continue to go up the next round. If they die, there can only be two people answering the challenge the next round, so on and so forth. Does everyone have any objections?” Ka Xin said coolly.

“None, none!”

“Naturally none!”

...

All of the household guards all waved their hands repeatedly, not having any objections towards Ka Xin’s words at all.

These kinds of rules were very rare in human regions.

But in the fiend race territory, it was commonplace.

Which fight did not have people injured, no loss of lives, would be a strange thing instead.

But wanting to kill members of the fiend race was not an easy thing. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The fiend race’s nucleus was the fiend soul. As long as the fiend soul was not exterminated, they could revive.

Hence, unless the strength disparity was very great between fiends, otherwise, losses of life would not appear.

These household guards were all grand completion Two-star Fiend Generals. Whoever wanted to kill another fiend was not that easy of a matter.

Coming to this kind of occasion, the four great families’ disciples were all contending in the dark. Who they brought were naturally the experts among their household guards too.

And the one and only make do Two-star Fiend General was Ye Yuan.

This intention of targeting was seriously too obvious.

The competition was a total of three rounds. In other people’s view, the likelihood of Ye Yuan making it past three rounds alive was virtually zero.

A household guard who got his position by relying on his looks, how much strength could he have?

“Starshine, the three of you have to perform well in a while! I see that everyone’s strength is all very formidable. So you guys mustn’t bring down the reputation of City Lord Manor!” Ka Xin said to a household guard beside him with a profound meaning.

This Starshine had followed Ka Xin for a very long time. So how could he not understand his meaning?

As long as he ran into Ye Yuan, he must kill him.

“Your Highness rest assured, Starshine will definitely go all out and not disappoint your highness,” Starshine bowed his body and said.

While on this side, Li Ji whispered to Ye Yuan, “Brother Source Night, if you’re not a match in a while, just take the initiative to admit defeat! Big Brother there still have quite a few experts. Our Fan Family won’t lose.”

Li Ji was not worried about Ye Yuan being directly insta-killed. After all, he was able to kill Lang Ge, his strength already did not lose to ordinary grand completion Two-star fiend generals already.

But these household guards in front, none of them were mediocre.

Lang Ge’s strength was not totally enough to look at in front of them.

The reason why Li Ji solicited Ye Yuan was taking fancy on his potential, and not eyeing his strength.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Miss Li Ji rest assured, Source Night knows what to do.”

...

“It’s all this damn burden, making us unable to get those treasures! If not for this brat dragging down, we can definitely win!” Luo Qi said hatefully.

“Kid, if you have the balls, don’t land in our hands in the future. Otherwise, you’ll get it!” Pei Lan gritted his teeth and said.

There was a small-scale practice field in this courtyard. After coming to the practice field, Luo Qi and Pei Lan bared their teeth at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over him and said indifferently, “Hope that you guys don’t drag me down in a while.”

“Drag you down? Hahaha, what a joke! If not for drawing close to Miss Li Ji, do you think you have the qualifications to stand here?” Luo Qi said with a cold laugh.

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said, “Idiot!”

“What did you say?!”

Luo Qi exploded right away. Luckily, Pei Lan still knew some sense of propriety and hurriedly pulled him, saying, “Alright, alright, now isn’t the time to be quarreling! Whatever there is, go back then resolve it!”

Luo Qi shot a fierce glare at Ye Yuan and said, “Remember it for me, you’ll get it when we go back! Don’t think that you can be lawless and unbridled with Miss Li Ji covering you!”

The Capone Capital City’s four great families were the Ka Family, the You Family, the Mo Family, and the Fan Family.

The Fan Family’s opponent in the first round was the You Family’s You Nie’s household guards.

When the three people saw this scene, their eyes revealed looks of contempt and said with a light laugh, “Heh, luck is really good, drew three idiots. Haven’t even fought yet and they are in-fighting first.”

“Haha, Young Master You Nie is also Miss Li Ji’s pursuer. Just now, he instructed to definitely exterminate this punk!”

“Leave this kid to me, I’ll definitely send him on his way!”

“Heh, Na Qi, you really know how to pick on an easy target! Move faster! Hurry over and help us when you’re done!”

“Right!”

The three people chimed in one after another, already directly sentencing Ye Yuan to death.

This three-people battle rules, the very start was three-versus-three.

If there was one side who was defeated or had deaths, the victor would be able to join the other two groups, forming a two-versus-one situation, all the way until one side was defeated!

Hence, if there was an expert whose strength was especially outstanding, they would gain a huge upper-hand.

Na Qi looked at Ye Yuan and said with a scornful look, “Wake up, kid, you have no chance to admit defeat!”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes again and said speechlessly, “Why are there so many idiots?”

“Heh, razor-tongued brat. In a while, watch how you die!” Na Qi said with a cold smile.

You Nie watched his scene rather interestedly and said to You Dan beside him with a smile, “Big Brother, do you think this punk will directly admit defeat every round?”

You Dan smiled and said, “Do you think Ka Xin will let him get off the stage alive?”

You Nie’s gaze was dark as he said, “Reckless and blind thing, to actually dare have designs on Li Ji! I hope that Na Qi directly finishes him off!”

“First round battle, begin!” at this time, the City Lord Manor’s household guard directly shouted.

Swoosh!

The voice had yet to fade, only to see a streak of cold light flash past!

Na Qi’s body was clearly still standing on the spot, but the cold light already passed through Ye Yuan’s body.

When You Nie saw the situation, he could not help bursting into laughter, “Hahaha! He’s too weak! Couldn’t even block one move! Li Ji, this household guard of yours is seriously too weak!”

But very quickly, You Nie’s loud laughter turned stiff there. Because he discovered that nobody was chiming in with him at all.

This laugh was so awkward.

You Nie did not understand. Looking toward the practicing field again, his smile immediately turned stiff on his face.

No idea when, Ye Yuan and Na Qi actually changed positions!

And Ye Yuan was completely unscathed!

“J-Just now, that was an afterimage?”

In a blink of an eye, the two people actually teleported, changing positions.

This indicated that what he saw earlier were both afterimages!

Forget about Na Qi, why was ... Ye Yuan the same too?

You Dan shot a helpless glance at his younger brother and said with a sigh, “Told you to cultivate more long ago, but you wouldn’t listen! With this, you lost face, right?”

Fortunately, everyone was in the midst of shock.

Everyone did not expect that a middle-level Two-star fiend general could actually keep up with a grand completion Two-star Fiend General’s speed!

Furthermore, speed was clearly Na Qi’s forte.

Although You Nie’s strength was the weakest among this group of people, he was, at any rate, a grand completion Two-star Fiend General.

Even he could not keep up with Na Qi’s speed, but Ye Yuan kept up!

“Could it be a fluke?” Ka Xin frowned and said.

But Lian Hua wore a smile on her face and said, “Tsk tsk, seems ... rather interesting! I’m becoming more and more interested in Little Brother[1]!”

Na Qi’s move failed to carry out, his expression was sullen to the extreme.

“Terrific lad, go to hell!” Na Qi roared and rushed over toward Ye Yuan.

[1] Little Brother here is actually closer to Oppa.
