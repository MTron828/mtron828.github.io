Chapter 1409 Grudge

At Ye Yuan’s residence, Thundercry’s face was rather awkward.

When in the Mystic realm, he still flared up and solemnly vowed to Qin Tian, to have the Qin Family give an account.

Who knew that now, it was all talk and no action; no more follow up.

“Ye Yuan, you made great contributions to Wu Meng Academy and the capital city. These are the rewards that City Lord gave you!” Thundercry said.

The academy’s rewards were not ungenerous: 150 thousand points, plus 50 Tier 2 low-grade divine pills, plus a profound divine artifact battle armor!

The 100 thousand points awarded to Ye Yuan previously were already pretty much depleted by him.

These 150 thousand points, to Ye Yuan it was as if delivering charcoal in the snow.

And a profound divine artifact battle armor could even have the effect of defending against the attack of Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouses.

Except, Ye Yuan was not so easy to fool, and said with a faint smile, “I didn’t expect that the Qin Family’s ability is actually so great. Doing this sort of thing and actually still made Teacher Thundercry run into a wall.”

Thundercry did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so smart, actually seeing through the whole thing so quickly.

He was originally still planning on fighting a quick battle to end things fast and slip away after giving Ye Yuan these rewards.

Looking at it now, he could not avoid it.

Since Ye Yuan exposed it, Thundercry had nothing to hide either, heaving a sigh. He said, “The Qin Family is one of Wu Meng Capital City’s oldest families. A Wu Meng Capital City’s city lord had even once emerged from that family before! The Qin Family’s forces span every corner of the entire Wu Meng Capital City. Even if City Lord, His Excellency, wants to touch them, he would also have to weigh it over.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “So that’s how it is. Thank you, Teacher Thundercry, for making a trip!”

Thundercry froze. He originally thought that Ye Yuan would rebuke him in a fit of rage, saying that he failed to act.

He did not think that Ye Yuan just casually brushed it off.

This Ye Yuan was really different from the rest.

Thundercry let out a long sigh. If Ye Yuan kept on pressing, he would not know how to answer instead.

“Huhu, too courteous! Hope that you don’t have any thoughts and just cultivate well. After all, this Wu Meng Capital City, it’s still City Lord, His Excellency, who calls the shots!” Thundercry said with an embarrassed smile.

Ye Yuan nodded with a smile and said, “Ye Yuan understands! After some time, I plan on going out to train and won’t disappoint Teacher Thundercry.”

Thundercry’s expression could not help changing when he heard that and said, “Going out to train? You just broke through to grand completion Grotto Profound not long. It’s not too late to go out and train after breaking through to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm! Going out to train right now is too dangerous!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Teacher Thundercry, rest assured. Ye Yuan has a score in his heart.”

When Thundercry saw that Ye Yuan’s mind was made up, and also recalling his outstanding strength, he could only nod and said, “Alright, you be careful yourself then. These are three Heavenly Thunder Swift Talismans that I refined. It’s a great deal faster than your sword maneuvering flight’s speed. Perhaps it will be of aid to you.”

Thundercry took out three yellow talismans and passed them to Ye Yuan. A powerful lightning-attribute law aura hit him head-on.

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised, but he still accepted the Heavenly Thunder Swift Talismans and said with clasped hands, “Then I’ll have to thank Teacher Thundercry!”

After Thundercry left, Ye Yuan’s face turned sullen.

He felt that this matter was probably not so simple!

The Qin Family’s forces in Wu Meng Capital City were deeply entrenched. This point, Ye Yuan acknowledged it.

But was this kind of deep-rootedness capable of making a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse compromise?

Ye Yuan felt that Wu Meng City Lord was probably not coming to terms with the Qin Family, but was not willing to punish them.

It looked like there was quite a bit of connection between Wu Meng City Lord and the Qin Family.

“For him to send these over, looks like he wants to pacify you, make you live together in harmony with the Qin Family! It looks like he doesn’t want to offend both sides,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan said, “The Qin Family isn’t to be offended, but what’s not to be offended about me? I helped him obtain the Four-star divine pill, and he didn’t even show his face. Looks like in his eyes, I’m just an insignificant student. Sending these seems fair, actually, he’s siding with the Qin Family there.”

Dustless could not help being stifled and said, “What you said is right! If this Wu Meng City Lord targets you, you’ll be in danger.”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “This Wu Meng City Lord really disappoints me! Now, I really love and hate this Wu Meng Capital City!”

After all, Ye Yuan’s Sundering Stars was comprehended in Wu Meng Academy. It was also considered receiving Wu Meng Academy’s grace.

But Wu Meng City Lord’s way of doing things made Ye Yuan rather disappointed.

Ye Yuan comprehended Sundering Stars and contributed Sundering Stars to the Wu Meng Academy without holding back in the slightest, and also radiated splendor in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial.

One could say that his repayment to the Wu Meng Academy was already far more than what should be demanded.

Just a Four-star divine pill was worth several cities!

But in the end, what it exchanged for was such an outcome.

Dustless said, “You’d best be a little more careful in the future. Don’t get into a conflict with the Qin Family anymore. Otherwise, what kind of attitude Wu Meng City Lord has is hard to say!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “It’s naturally well if they don’t come and provoke me. If they really provoke me, I, Ye Yuan, have never feared anyone before!”

...

Ye Yuan stayed for five years in the Sword Tomb’s fifth level.

Five years later, Sundering Stars was finally completed!

Close to 20 year’s time from start to finish, Ye Yuan finally completed the Chaos Heaven Opening Sword Art’s first level sword move.

Presently, when Ye Yuan deployed Sundering Stars, this move, with the Chaos Heavenspan Canon at full power, he had the confidence to have a showdown with newly-advanced Heaven Glimpse powerhouses!

Although there was a tremendous gulf between Heaven Glimpse powerhouses and Grotto Profound martial artists, when Ye Yuan was at late-stage Grotto Profound, his strength already swept across those in the same rank.

Now, his realm and martial technique both had an all-round improvement. It was sufficient to make up for this enormous chasm.

At least, he had the power to fight.

Coming out of the Sword Tomb, Ye Yuan went straight to the Merit Hall. This was the place where Wu Meng Academy students received missions.

It was also Ye Yuan’s first time coming over. That inner-court disciple in charge of missions clearly knew Ye Yuan and said with a laugh, “Yo, what wind blew our hundred cities’ number one person here? Junior Apprentice Brother Ye hasn’t entered the inner-court yet. Could it be that you’re already planning on receiving missions?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother, I plan on going out to train for a bit. Is there a list of missions for me to take a look first?”

That student’s expression changed and he said solemnly, “Junior Apprentice Brother Ye plans on going out to train? The danger of that kind of mission is very high. Even if inner-court students go, the rate of death is also extremely high! I know that junior apprentice brother’s strength is quite strong, but ... shouldn’t you go out to train after being promoted to the inner-court first?”

Ye Yuan saw that the other party’s concern did not seem to be false, and he could not help feeling touched.

Ye Yuan’s prestige in the inner-court was also extremely high, not just in the outer-court.

After all, he helped Wu Meng Capital City seize the championship with his power alone, and even shaved their mortal foe, Zuo Xiang Capital City, bald, making everyone hold their heads up high.

Before long, Ye Yuan would even release splendor in the inner-court.

Such a promising junior apprentice brother, everyone was naturally willing to get closer.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Thanks for Senior Apprentice Brother’s concern. But cultivating for a long time in the academy, I feel like I’ve already reached a bottleneck period. When training, I’ll be more careful.”
