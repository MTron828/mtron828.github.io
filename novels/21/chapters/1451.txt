Chapter 1455 Repen

Thud!

Ye Yuan did a sweeping kick, Lin Xiu directly knelt on the ground.

The one lying on the bed was precisely Little Fatty Xie Jingyi.

“My brother said that his brother will help him get revenge. Even if I throw away this life, I’ll also have to avenge this grudge for him! You ruined my brother’s divine sea, rendering him a cripple, so I ruined your divine sea and made you come in front of my brother to repent! As for your life and death, it’s up to my brother to decide!” Ye Yuan enunciated each word.

Ye Yuan’s injuries were truly not light. But at this time, he already could not care about the injuries on his body.

He knew that after this fight, a monstrous wave would surely be set off in Wu Meng Capital City.

The time left for him was not much!

How did the current Lin Xiu still have any hint of the appearance of a proud daughter of heaven?

It was only to see her hair in a mess, her clothing disheveled, half of her face swollen heavily. Her abdomen area still had blackish-red bloodstains flowing out.

Most important, her pride was already completely destroyed by Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan did not have any intention of having compassion towards women at all. In Ye Yuan’s eyes, she was a venomous beauty.

“But ... But he ...” Lin Xiu said fearfully.

Ye Yuan’s face was cold and detached, pointing his finger like lightning, tapping a few times on Little Fatty’s body.

A miraculous scene appeared, Little Fatty actually slowly opened both eyes.

Lin Xiu could not help getting a shock. Back then, how heavy those few hits were, she saw it with her eyes.

According to her deduction, it was absolutely impossible for Little Fatty to survive.

Now, Ye Yuan just helped him to massage a few times and Little Fatty woke up?

Actually, this was primarily the effect of that medicinal pill. It was just that Little Fatty had a breath stuck in his chest, that was why he remained unconscious.

Those few taps of Ye Yuan’s helped Little Fatty smoothen out his breathing. Little Fatty naturally slowly woke up.

Ye Yuan helped him up and said softly, “Damn fatty, your grudge, your brother has already helped you avenge it! Apart from Lin Xiu, those four people have already stretched their necks out to be chopped off. This bitch, I’ve already wasted her cultivation, leaving you to deal with.”

Xie Jingyi was still very weak at this time. His reaction was clearly somewhat sluggish.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, that ashen-gray eyes of Xie Jingyi’s gradually recovered some light.

That hollow eyes gradually focused on Lin Xiu’s face, then became complicated.

Only a short while ago, Little Fatty’s greatest motivation for entering Wu Meng Academy was Lin Xiu.

How much work he put in these few years in order to become a man worthy of Lin Xiu, only he himself knew.

But, this woman actually ruthlessly toyed with his feelings, then trampled his feelings on the ground, trampling it to no end.

Lin Xiu, trampled on his pride as a man until it was worthless.

Now, when he woke up again, this proud daughter of heaven actually became a cowering ugly woman, kneeling in front of him.

All this made him feel like he had experienced a dream.

How much did he wish that this was just a dream!

Little Fatty could not speak, but he knew in his heart that it was his brother who picked up his dignity from the ground and pieced it together!

When Lin Xiu saw Little Fatty wake up, she scrambled over to the bedside and hugged Little Fatty’s calf, saying with a weeping look: “Little Yi, it was all Xiu-er’s fault! Xiu-er was possessed by ghosts for a moment. That’s why I would do this kind of muddleheaded thing. I ... I actually have you in my heart all along, really! Little Yi, let’s ... let’s get married tomorrow, alright?”

Lin Xiu knew that her only hope to live right now was that piece of marriage contract.

Xie Jingyi liked her for so many years, this kind of feeling could not possibly be wiped away all at once.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Xiu’s despicable appearance and really wanted to slap her to death with one palm.

But he did not wish to affect Little Fatty’s decision, so he forcefully endured and did not speak.

In this short while, Little Fatty finally recovered some strength.

“Make ... her ... shut up.”

Little Fatty used a mosquito-like voice and said these four words, virtually exhausting all of the strength in his body.

Of course, this was said to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “My brother asked you to shut up, heard it?”

Lin Xiu’s expression changed and indeed did not say to make a sound anymore.

Little Fatty panted for a while before mustering up some strength again and said, “I ... knew that ... you ... would help me ... take revenge. Ha ... I ... thought that ... I was dead for sure.”

Each time Little Fatty said a word, he had to pause for a bit. Clearly, his condition was poor to the extreme.

Ye Yuan said with a solemn look, “With me around, even if you want to die, you can’t die too! When you’re well, let’s take up the wine cup and have a merry chat!”

Little Fatty’s eyes were somewhat murky. Clearly, he knew that even if he recovered, he was already a cripple too.

With his divine sea being destroyed, he could no longer cultivate in this life.

This kind of life, what meaning was there still?

A divine sea being destroyed was a completely different situation than Ye Yuan’s divine sea being damaged back then.

After the divine sea was destroyed, even if your medicinal Dao was exceedingly formidable, it was also unable to recover.

Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and said, “Fatty, do you believe me or not?”

Little Fatty froze for a moment, then immediately nodded his head slightly

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “Good! Then your brother will promise you here today, I’ll definitely find a way to let you recover your divine sea!”

Little Fatty looked at Ye Yuan with some surprise, clearly somewhat doubting this sentence.

Not just him, a hint of contempt flashed across the eyes of Lin Xiu by the side, feeling that this boast of Ye Yuan’s was boasted too big.

Divine sea already destroyed, how could it possibly be repaired?

Moreover, whether or not Ye Yuan could survive past today was still unknown!

He killed so many of the Qin Family’s people, how could the Qin Family possibly take things lying down?

“I ... believe you!” Little Fatty still said very seriously.

He knew that Ye Yuan was consoling him, not wishing him to never recover after the setback from hereon.

Although this kind of comforting seemed rather feeble, it was very heart-warming.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “This whore, how to deal with her?”

Little Fatty looked at Lin Xiu’s face and said with a slight sigh, “I ... don’t wish ... to see her ... again!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lin Xiu’s entire body trembled, her face revealing a look of wild elation.

With this sentence of Little Fatty’s, she knew that her life was preserved.

Although she was a cripple now, it was better to live than die.

Ye Yuan let out a slight sigh, thinking to himself that this Little Fatty was still a little too kind.

So many years of feelings were not so easy to let go in the end.

“Get lost then!” Ye Yuan said in a deep voice.

“Yes, yes, yes, I ... I’ll get lost right away!”

Lin Xiu crawled and scrambled, going out of the room’s door.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Your body is still very weak now, take a good rest.”

Little Fatty nodded slightly. He was indeed very tired already.

Ye Yuan placed him down. He fell asleep very quickly.

Lin Xiu went out of the Myriad Treasure Tower, ignoring the injuries on her body and sprinting wildly. She wanted to leave this damn place as soon as possible.

Ahead, the Qin Family’s brigade already arrived. Lin Xiu laughed excitedly and said, “Hahaha, Ye Yuan, I see if you won’t die today!”

Right at this time, an icy-cold voice sounded out behind her.

“Whether I die or not won’t need you to worry about. But you’re dead for sure!”

“Puhwark!”

Lin Xiu had yet to react to what was going on when her entire being exploded into a cloud of blood mist, passing away with the wind ...
