Chapter 1977: Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill

“Sigh, like drawing water with a sieve; all these were in vain! That damn Liu Yi, the next time I see him, I’ll definitely show him some colors!” Song Yu said with a depressed look.

The Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit was an extremely rare heaven and earth spirit fruit. It could save a lot of cultivation time. This was too important to martial artists. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The others also had resentful faces, clearly all being extremely aggrieved.

“Sigh, he better be careful; don’t let me run into him again!” Guo Jingyang said.

Everyone turned around and prepared to leave, but Ye Yuan suddenly said, “Hold on.”

“Mn? Brother Ye, do you still have something?” Song Yu asked puzzledly.

Ye Yuan did not speak, but walked to the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit’s plant, bent down, and carefully pried aside the dirt, revealing the root portion.

Everyone was very perplexed, not knowing what Ye Yuan was planning to do here.

Ye Yuan cleaned the dirt on the root and pulled out the root without damaging it, saying with a smile, “Although the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit is gone, this tree root is also good stuff.”

“Tree root? What use does the tree root have?” Song Yu asked doubtfully.

Ye Yuan said, “Because the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit is too heaven-defying, it’s totally unable to integrate with other spirit medicines to form medicinal pills. But the Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill’s tree roots is the core ingredient to refine the Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill. Although the effects of the Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill can’t compare to the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit, it can also let the person who consumes it have a great improvement in strength.”

When the four people heard it, they all had looks of wild elation.

Ye Yuan was a master-level alchemist, him saying this sort of words, that naturally meant that there was some assurance.

“There’s actually still Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill this sort of thing! That’s really great!” Ma Chang said in pleasant surprise.

However, Song Yu’s brows suddenly furrowed and he said, “But where to gather the other spirit medicines in this sort of place?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I just happen to have the other spirit medicines on me. I’m only lacking this core ingredient. Now, it can be refined.”

As he said, Ye Yuan immediately took out the Xuanlong Cauldron. One spirit medicine after another emerged and was sent into the medicinal cauldron by Ye Yuan.

When Song Yu and the rest saw this scene, they could not help being shocked inwardly.

Why would Ye Yuan bring along so many spirit medicines on him?

Could it be that he had foreseeing abilities and knew that he could run into the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit this time?

One had to know, rank six spirit medicines were not street-side cabbages. Even if one was a Six-star Alchemy God who had already been famous for a long time, it was also impossible to bring so many spirit medicines out on their person.

Song Yu and the rest were all people with vast experiences and knowledge. They knew that these supplementary medicines were all some very precious spirit medicines.

They did not know that Ye Yuan was the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder. These spirit medicines were nothing to him.

Fortunately, the other core medicines and supplementary medicines that the Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill required were all not very rare. Ye Yuan could just easily gather them and bring all of them along with him.

Currently, Ye Yuan not only had Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s inheritance, he even had the Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s powerful inheritance.

Regarding some obscure pill formulas, he grasped a lot of them.

This Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill was one of them.

With him refining pills on the spot, a profound and inscrutable power of law revolved around the medicinal cauldron and spread out.

They all knew that Ye Yuan was an alchemy master, but observing Ye Yuan refining pills in close distance still shocked these proud sons of heaven.

Their family clans and great imperial capitals did not lack Six-star Alchemy Gods.

But the Six-star Alchemy Gods that they had seen were simply not even fit to carry his shoes when put in front of Ye Yuan!

This kind of disparity, even if they were laymen, they could also feel it distinctly.

A medicinal fragrance that gladdened the heart and refreshed the mind spread out, Song Yu and the rest could not suppress the wild elation in their hearts.

The Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill was formed!

“Brother Song, this is yours.”

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned, the medicinal pill flew straight for Song Yu.

Song Yu received the medicinal pill and took a look, and he could not help sucking in a cold breath as he said, “T-T-This ... vast spirit divine pill!”

He finally knew now the reason why Ye Yuan would be held in esteem by the entire Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital with a mere First Firmament True God’s cultivation.

This kind of pill refining skill was simply inconceivable!

When Guo Jingyang and the rest heard ‘vast spirit divine pill’, four words, each and every one of them were shocked speechless.

Ye Yuan nodded and said to the others, “You all stand guard over Brother Song, I’ll continue refining pills.”

There were many Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit’s root hairs. It was sufficient to refine five to six people’s share of Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill. Those that were there naturally had a share.

After several hours, Guo Jingyang three people each received a Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill and were agitated until their faces flushed red.

People should not look at how each and every one of them was children of destiny, proud sons of heaven. Concerning this vast spirit divine pill, it was still their first time taking it in all their years of living.

Furthermore, it was even such a heaven-defying Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill!

Right at this time, Song Yu’s aura suddenly changed and actually broke right through the bottleneck of Fourth Firmament True God.

When the three people saw this scene, their faces revealed wild joy.

Originally, Song Yu was only an initial-stage Third Firmament True God. Just by consuming a medicinal pill, he actually broke right through to become a Fourth Firmament True God.

This medicinal pill was heaven-defying!

“Incredible! Incredible! This Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill’s effect is not too off compared to the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit too!” Hu Fei exclaimed with admiration.

“Brother Ye, I, Guo Jingyang, have never admired anyone before in this life. Today, I’m really prostrating on all fours in admiration of you!” Guo Jingyang praised with admiration.

At this time, with Song Yu breaking through successfully, his face did not conceal the look of wild joy in the slightest.

He really did not think that this Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill could actually directly let him break through to be a Fourth Firmament True God!

The gap of one minor True God Realm boundary was massive. It was already very impressive for ordinary medicinal pills to be able to make up for one-thousandth of the cultivation time.

But this Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill actually directly let him cross the large bottleneck of initial-stage True God Realm and middle-stage. So how could this not make him pleasantly surprised?

He bowed all the way down toward Ye Yuan and said sincerely, “Brother Ye, the incident previously was all I, Song Yu, being a scoundrel. I hope that you don’t take it to heart. From today onward, you and I are sworn brothers in life and death!”

He really felt regret for the incident before now.

If it were others, even if they pocketed the whole of these Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits’ plant, they would also have no temper.

But Ye Yuan actually contributed his own spirit medicines and helped them to refine such a heaven-defying Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill.

Repaying ingratitude with kindness, how could he not be moved in his heart?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Huhu, Brother Song doesn’t have to be courteous. Didn’t everyone already say that we’re brothers long ago?”

The words made everyone extremely moved.

Along the way, Ye Yuan shared treasures, saved Hu Fei, resisting powerful adversaries, and had long already become their backbone.

At this point, they already took Ye Yuan to genuinely be a sworn brother in life and death.

Following this, with Song Yu and Ye Yuan standing guard, the others each refined the medicinal pills to break through.

This Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill’s effect was extremely heaven-defying.

Hu Fei’s strength was the weakest, being only at the initial-stage Second Firmament True God Realm.

After consuming the medicinal pill, he broke right through to become a late-stage Third Firmament True God, directly crossing more than a minor realm.

As for Guo Jingyang and Ma Chang two people, they broke right through to be peak Third Firmament True Gods.

Furthermore, they could feel that the Fourth Firmament True God Realm was already not far away.

Finally, it was Ye Yuan’s turn to refine the medicinal pills.

The other four people each had a medicinal pill, Ye Yuan still had two Profound Heaven Single Breath Pills on him.

Ye Yuan directly swallowed both medicinal pills without the slightest hesitation.
