Chapter 3034: Competition Between Myriad Races!

“What’s there to look at? The All-Heavens List’s number one is definitely Qin Baichuan, that dead-person face!” Zuo Qingyang said crossly.

Qin Baichuan, Vast Court Firmament Limit Heaven’s Bright Yellow Heavenly Sect’s number one person.

Of course, he was also the strongest genius of humanity’s three supreme heavens!

Zuo Qingyang and the rest were peerlessly talented too, but compared to Qin Baichuan, they were still a notch worse.

“That might not be the case! Many years have already passed since the three heaven’s competition! I, Wang Ningyang, don’t feel like I’ll lose to that dead-person face!” Wang Ningyan said unconvincedly.

Zhou Xianchen also said, “Right, I’ve always been unconvinced by that dead-person face! These few years, I’ve suffered a lot in order to defeat him! I don’t believe that I, Zhou Xianchen, will be worse than others!”

These geniuses were all existences standing at the peak of all the heavens. They even had hope of stepping into the Great Beyond Realm in the future.

How could they submit to people easily?

In their eyes, their opponents were always just themselves.

A large rock was standing erect at a remote end of the platform.

On the large rock, many names were engraved densely.

This was the All-Heavens Stone that recorded the Vertical Heaven Stairs’ results ranking.

The top ten names were especially eminent!

The aura of Great Dao emitted from the gilded large characters.

Everyone looked over. Wang Ningyan’s name was shockingly ranked first!

“Haha,?congratulations Fair Ningyan, for overpowering all the heavens!” Zuo Qingyang said with a loud laugh.

Wang Ningyan had a peerless aptitude. These few people naturally had the heart to court her.

Therefore, they were all showing it openly and covertly.

Zhou Xianchen also said, “Fairy Ningyan is impressive! Huang Zhen and Yang Daiyun have also lost to you this time! Fairy Maiden has gained face for our Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven this time!”

Wang Ningyan did not get carried away and said lightly, “Qin Baichuan hasn’t made a move. What’s there to congratulate?”

Zuo Qingyang said, “Fairy’s words are not right! Even if he makes his move, can he win Fairy with certainty? In my view, the odds of winning between you guys is merely 50-50!”

Zhou Xianchen nodded and said, “I agree with this! It’s really not flattering Fairy. Just now, the strength that Fairy exhibited, it is much stronger than during the last three heavens’ competition! It can be seen that Fairy buried yourself in cultivation these few years and also made tremendous improvements. This Zhou examines my own conscience; I’m most likely not Fairy’s match anymore.”

These words were half flattering, half sincere.

Many years had passed, and everyone’s strength all made tremendous improvements.

If he really faced off against Wang Ningyan, Zhou Xianchen touched his own heart and felt that he would not lose.

But Wang Ningyan’s improvement was indeed huge. He did not dare to underestimate it too.

This Vertical Heaven Stairs was merely the preliminary test to them. They naturally would not bring out their full strength.

No one would be silly enough to expose all of their trump cards here.

Of course, they were not willing to be outdone by others. So 80% strength still had to be brought out.

Indeed as expected, the top ten geniuses on the list, there now all the three heavens’ geniuses!

This All-Heavens List only recorded 1000 names.

Although the number was not little, looking across the 33 Heavens, how many geniuses were there?

Those who could enter the top 1000 were all amazingly talented individuals. None of them were mediocre.

However, the further behind the rankings, the greater the changes to the names.

Many people had already been squeezed out of the top 1000.

Rather, it was the top 10 that stood firm.

Finally, the top 10 names moved!

Wang Ningyan’s name actually dropped by a place!

The name that was ranked first, was shockingly Qin Baichuan! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“This guy is really unwilling to be outdone by others!” Wang Ningyan said with a sigh.

Everyone was not surprised by this scene.

If Qin Baichuan faded into the crowd, that would be something that surprised people.

Up to this point, the top geniuses of humanity’s three supreme heavens, finally all go onto the All-Heavens List.

Everything was within expectations.

First place, Vast Court Firmament Limit Heaven, humanity’s Qin Baichuan!

Second place, Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven, humanity’s Wang Ningyan!

Third place, Han Chong Miao Cheng Heaven, humanity’s Lin Ruhe!

Humanity’s three supreme heavens each occupied a place.

The others were also crisscrossed between the three heavens, pretty much the same.

“Alright, the die is cast. There’s nothing to see anymore. What’s left is just waiting for the Labyrinth Divine Palace to open,” Wang Ningyan said coolly.

Before her voice faded, the All-Heavens List had a new change again.

Furthermore, this change was even the first place!

Qin Baichuan’s name was shockingly squeezed down by someone!

“Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, Feng Qingxuan? Why? The Vermilion Bird Clan joined in too?” Wang Ningyan said very unhappily.

Actually, the participation of the other races was also something within expectations.

After all, Heavenless’ reputation was too resounding!

Those old undyings who had experienced the chaos caused by war would definitely make their descendants come and give it a try.

What Wang Ningyan was unhappy about was that Feng Qingxuan actually took the first place away!

“Hur hur,

?Fairy doesn’t need to be like this. How can these true spirits have as great a potential as us humans? Moreover, Fairy had not used your full strength.” Zhou Xianchen consoled her.

“Yeah, these guys deliberately used all of their strength in order to snatch first place. I reckon that Qin Baichuan didn’t use his full strength too,” Zuo Qingyang said.

Wang Ningyan just gave a cold snort and did not speak.

But her gaze never left the All-Heavens List.

The other few people also started paying attention to the All-Heavens List.

They all realized that the inheritance struggle this time would probably be unusually fierce.

Very soon, a change happened to the All-Heavens List again.

The second place Qin Baichuan was squeezed to third place!

The second name shockingly became Infinite Overcast Oath Heaven, fiend race’s Kong Tan!

With this, everyone was no longer calm.

Before long, changes happened to the All-Heavens List again.

The third place Qin Baichuan was squeezed to fourth place!

The third place name became Thoughtless River Reason Heaven, feather race’s Yu Ran!

Feather race!

The top three places were occupied by the Fire Phoenix Clan, fiend race, and feather race respectively.

Humanity’s geniuses were actually all suppressed!

“Damn it! If I knew long ago, I should have gone all out! Now, it’s really an utter loss of face!” Wang Ningyan’s face revealed a hint of frostiness.

She was already squeezed to fifth place!

This ranking made her, a proud person, somewhat unable to accept it.

Even Zuo Qing and the rest had their intestines turn green with regret too.

They felt very depressed, having a feeling like they were schemed against by someone.

Heavenless’ move was too ruthless. This was stewing the myriad races in all the heavens in one pot!

This kind of competition was too fierce!

It was really a single misstep that would bring everlasting regret!

“Sigh,?we’d have exerted our full strength if we knew earlier! With Fairy Ningyan’s strength, overpowering that Fire Phoenix Clan’s little wench is absolutely a sure deal!” Zuo Qingyang said.

He was already squeezed to ninth place!

Right at this time, a change happened to the ranking list again!

This time, the change was the first place!

Feng Qingxuan was squeezed to second!

First place, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, human race’s Yang Qing!

Wang Ningyan and the rest exchanged glances with shock on their faces.

“Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, what the hell?”

“A human that came out of this kind of low-level plane actually overpowered the Vermilion Bird Clan, fiend race, and feather race?”

“Where did this guy pop out from?”

… …

These few human heaven’s chosen all had struck senseless faces. They were all regretting what happened but did not think that a nameless person who came out of a low-level plane actually suppressed the juniors of myriad races, becoming number one!
