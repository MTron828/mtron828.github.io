Chapter 2117: Ruthless Face Slapping

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan held the emperor bone in his hand and slowly walked out, his aura growing stronger and stronger.

The expressions of the Qilin Clan’s powerhouses changed drastically.

They looked at Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun with incredible shock, their eyes full of disbelief.

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun actually trembled incessantly under this bloodline pressure!

Furthermore, the closer Ye Yuan got, the fierce Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun’s trembling!

“What Qilin Clan’s face? What avenging Qi Zhen? It’s all bullshit! Your true objective of coming here is this, right?” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile as he walked.

Seeing this scene, all of the demon race powerhouses felt shocked to the core.

Especially those Empyrean powerhouses, their eyeballs almost popped out.

The more one reached their realm, the more they knew the terror of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

However, a mere emperor bone could actually completely suppress a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This was too terrifying!

“The Qilin Clan is really making a mighty show of power! You all sensed this treasure and then thought that this treasure is yours? Calling for me to hand it over time and again, you even want me to kowtow and beg for mercy?”

“Being taught a lesson by me, the young one failed, so the old man came. The old one failed and an even older one came! Made a bet with me, but reneged on it one-sidedly, and even wanted me to offer up the emperor bone, and to make apologies to the Qilin Clan!”

Ye Yuan walked step by step, saying a sentence with each step.

While talking, it carried the effect of the Voice of the Dragon God, the power immense.

The Voice of the Dragon God contained the effect of a divine soul attack.

Each of his words was affecting the judgment of the demons in the city.

“Your Qilin Clan is really tyrannical!”

“However, it’s too bad! You’re overbearing, I’ll be even more domineering than you all!”

“Kneel down!”

Ye Yuan’s voice was akin to thunder. It was as if it fell down from above the nine heavens.

At the same time, the Qilin emperor bone’s bloodline pressure also reached the peak at this time.

The moment this voice landed, Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun actually could not withstand the pressure and directly knelt down in front of Ye Yuan in the air with a thud.

Behind him, Qi Chen and the rest of the Qilin Clan’s Empyrean powerhouses all could not withstand this pressure and knelt down too.

The entire Qilin Clan was kneeling in front of a young man.

This young man seemed like a god.

A Heavenly Emperor kneeling, it was as if the void started trembling.

All the demon race powerhouses in the city were deathly silent.

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun came in a threatening manner and was actually coerced into kneeling by Ye Yuan with a few sentences?

That ... That was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse was actually pressured into kneeling by a True God Realm martial artist?

Even if Ye Yuan borrowed the power of the emperor bone, being able to obtain the emperor bone’s recognition, this was an inconceivable thing to begin with.

Whoever obtained the treasure, that treasure would naturally be a part of their strength.

Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were god-like existences in everyone’s cognition.

Below Heavenly Emperor, even Empyrean powerhouses were like ants too.

If it was not something major, Heavenly Emperor powerhouses would not be walking around in the secular world at all. They overlooked the world in Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas.

But now, an existence that they viewed as a god actually knelt down!

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun’s gaze stared fixedly at Ye Yuan, almost spewing fire.

A stifled breath was stuck in his chest, virtually making his entire body about to explode.

However, no matter how he struggled, he could not stand up from under this bloodline pressure at all.

This was trembling that originated from the soul!

In front of the emperor bone, he could not give birth to even the courage to resist.

At this very moment, Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun was like a wooden puppet that was strung up.

Although he was unbelievably awake, his body and soul did not listen to orders and were being suppressed by a mysterious power, making him only able to submit.

Beyond the rage, Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun had more shock.

He was the Qilin Clan’s Heavenly Emperor to begin with and naturally would not be unfamiliar with Qilin emperor bones. Even the bones in his body could similarly be called emperor bone too.

However, when he was facing this emperor bone, it was like a child facing a giant.

At this time, inside the city, the Dragon Clan’s powerhouses were also incomparably shocked.

What they were shocked at was not the Qilin emperor bone, but that Ye Yuan actually used the Voice of the Dragon God!

“It’s actually the Voice of the Dragon God! Could it be that this boy even fused a true dragon bloodline? But even if he fused a true dragon bloodline, it’s also impossible to use a secret art like the Voice of the Dragon God!” Long Zhi looked at the Ye Yuan in the sky and said with a doubtful look.

The Voice of the Dragon God was an extremely complicated dragon race secret technique. Disregarding that it was powerful, it was also famous for being difficult to train.

It was inconceivable to them that Ye Yuan could utilize the Voice of the Dragon God to such an extent.

As a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, Long Zhi could naturally determine the strength of the Voice of the Dragon God.

If this roar of Ye Yuan’s was aimed at ordinary martial artists, it could absolutely one-shot same rank powerhouses!

Even when facing a martial artist who was a minor realm higher, he would also be able to contend with them.

This kind of strength was absolutely not what fusing true dragon bloodline could explain.

Long Xiaochun also opened her mouth wide and said in surprise, “Goodness gracious! Ye Yuan is too incredible! That’s a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, but he actually directly made him kneel! Looks like he really don’t need this young lady to take the stage anymore. But ... it feels really great! The Qilin Clan, that bunch of old things, this young lady is very displeased at the sight of them, see if they still dare to make a show of force!”

Long Zhi gave Long Xiaochun a glance and could not help rolling his eyes.

“Ye Yuan, you dare to humiliate this emperor! This emperor will definitely make you regret coming to this world!” Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun roared at Ye Yuan.

He came in a threatening manner and roared at Ye Yuan earlier, attempting to make Ye Yuan kneel down and ruthlessly slap Ye Yuan’s face. In the end, Ye Yuan was completely fine.

But now, Ye Yuan’s voice shook the entire world, pressuring him, a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, and the entire Qilin Clan to kneel instead.

This face was really slapped resoundingly!

One time, two times, three times.

The Qilin Clan coming out of hiding this time, not only did they not exhibit their race’s power, they instead had their faces repeatedly slapped by the same person.

This kind of thing, it was depressing just mentioning it.

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun felt ashamed, and enraged, and could only use his roars to vent the repression in his heart.

“Hahaha ... your Qilin Clan is really jackals from the same lair! Even the lines are the same! Your words are identical as when Qi Zhen knelt down back then! However, this is what you all asked for yourselves! I, Ye Yuan, am not domineering like you guys. But if someone is being domineering on top of my head, then I’ll be even more overbearing than you!” Ye Yuan said with a loud laugh.

Ever since coming to the Westspirit Region, the Qilin Clan had been arrogant and bossy in front of him time and again.

In the end, wasn’t it still bullying him on the basis that his strength was weak and his realm was low?

But the Qilin Clan never dreamed that Ye Yuan had the emperor bone, this trump card, in his hands.

When facing the Qilin Clan, he was virtually set in an undefeatable position!

Now, even a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse knelt down.

Everyone was silent like cicadas in winter. The development of the matter already completely exceeded all of their expectations.

“Humph! How can my Qilin Clan’s dignity allow you to provoke like this? Conceited child, hand over the emperor bone and prepare to die!”

Right at this time, a cold snort transmitted out of the void, carrying a majesty that did not tolerate profaning.
