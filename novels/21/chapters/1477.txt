Chapter 1481 Sleepy

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Na Qi and Ye Yuan, the two people’s figures moved quickly, their speed swift to the extreme.

You Nie watched until his eyes were dazzled, only feeling one afterimage after another made his entire person dizzy.

You Nie was a true-blue silkpants. Although he had a grand completion Two-star Fiend General cultivation realm, his strength was far lacking.

His visual prowess could not keep up with the two people’s speed at all.

Na Qi had two claws worn on his wrist. A hundred claw strikes came out in a blink of an eye.

But each time, it would brush past Ye Yuan.

Each time, it was missing that little bit.

The claws scratched here and there around Ye Yuan, but could not touch him. This drove Na Qi crazy.

“Damn fellow, attack if you have the capabilities! What kind of ability is it considered to dodge and hide?”

On the practicing field, came Na Qi’s roar.

“This is what you said.” Ye Yuan’s figure moved swiftly, but his words were calm.

“Rubbish, of course I said it! If you have the capabilities, fight openly! Do you, a pretty boy, only know how to dodge?” Na Qi bellowed angrily.

Pfft!

A sharp sword directly pierced Na Qi’s head, grounding his fiend soul into smithereens.

His roar also came to an abrupt end.

“The moment I attack, you’re dead,” looking at Na Qi’s corpse, Ye Yuan said helplessly.

“Fool! Unleashed a hundred moves and couldn’t even touch the corners of his sleeves, he actually still didn’t realize the disparity and still wanted him to attack! Truly seeking death!” You Dan said with a cold snort.

You Nie said blankly, “What ... What happened?”

In his eyes, Na Qi had always been suppressing Ye Yuan.

Why was he gone all of a sudden?

Ka Xin’s expression turned dark, a hint of surprise flashing across his eyes and he snorted coldly, but then he fell silent.

Li Ji’s gaze turned intent and a hint of intoxication actually flashed across her eyes.

Ye Yuan’s every move and stance was truly cool to the extreme.

Good-looking, strength was even that formidable, really could not pick out any shortcomings!

She also did not think that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so powerful.

Seemed like when he killed that Lang Ge, Ye Yuan did not use his full strength at all.

“This kid is so strong! Looks like we all underestimated him!”

“Originally thought that he’s the weakest among the three, so I didn’t expect that his strength was the greatest!”

“He’s just a middle-stage Two-star Fiend General, truly inconceivable!”

“Eh ... what’s he doing?”

...

In the midst of everyone’s exclamations, Ye Yuan hugged his sword and slowly retreated to the edge of the field, and actually found a corner and went to sleep. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Luo Qi and Pei Lan two people had fallen into a bitter fight, but already knew that Ye Yuan had won.

They originally thought that Ye Yuan would help. In the end, glimpsing through their peripherals, they discovered that Ye Yuan actually went to sleep, and were immediately enraged until smoke bellowed from all seven orifices.

“Punk, quickly come and help!”

“Hey, Source Night, don’t you want those treasures?”

The two people started yelling anxiously. But what answered them was Ye Yuan’s snoring.

This guy actually fell asleep?

Must be feigned!

Didn’t this guy know what was called putting the big picture first?

Even if there was any grudge, it should also be settled after winning the opponent!

The two people remaining on You Nie’s side originally thought that Ye Yuan would take the chance and come over to help.

In the end, Ye Yuan actually went over there and snored loudly in his sleep!

Happiness came too suddenly, making them rather overwhelmed.

Internal strife was really great!

With this, they naturally would not be silly enough to go and provoke Ye Yuan, but they want to finish off these two in front of them as soon as possible.

This way, they would surely win going two-on-one.

Hence, they became more valiant as they fought, killing until Luo Qi and Pei Lan two people were in a flurry.

Fortunately, both Luo Qi and Pei Lan still had some strength. After a bout of bitter fighting, the two of them both narrowly won their opponents.

The first round was actually cleared with dangers!

The moment it ended, Luo Qi exploded, coming to Ye Yuan’s side ablaze with anger and berated, “Kid, what’s the meaning? We could clearly finish off the opponent very quickly, but you’re snoring loudly in your sleep here!”

Ye Yuan opened both eyes with a drowsy look and said blurry, “Mn? Ended? Sorry about it, slept too late yesterday. I was sleepy.”

“Pffft!”

Everyone guffawed with laughter. This reason ... was seriously too crappy.

A Two-star Fiend General powerhouse, even if they did not sleep for a decade, it was nothing. But Ye Yuan said that he was sleepy.

Luo Qi had a hideous look on his face, becoming virtually contorted at this time.

“You!” Luo Qi was practically going nuts.

Ye Yuan stood up, yawned, and said with a still dissatisfied appearance, “Eh? Nobody came to find me, could it be that we won? Uh ... two seniors’ strengths are indeed very formidable, Source Night admires! The battle at the back will still have to rely on the two of you.”

As he said, Ye Yuan clasped his hands and had a very humble look, directly angering the two people until they were about to vomit blood.

Ye Yuan’s comical appearance tickled Li Ji until she shook with laughter.

The fiend race men were all bold and unconstrained, yelling about killing at every turn. How many had a fine sense of humor like Ye Yuan?

Good-looking, young, powerful strength, and even humorous!

Such a man simply had a fatal attraction toward fiend race women.

Not just Li Ji, Lian Hua’s gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was similarly extremely intoxicated.

After a farce, it was other teams’ turn to compete.

Sure enough, the strength of Ka Xin’s team was very powerful, finishing off the opponent virtually as easy as blowing off dust.

You Dan’s group also won Lian Hua’s group, obtaining a spot in the semi-finals.

While Fan Yu’s group also defeated the Mo Family’s group, obtaining a top four spot.

This way, the Fan Family actually took two spots, while the Mo Family was directly eliminated.

With this lottery draw, the Fan Family brother and sister were actually put in the same group.

Li Ji said with a smug look, “Big Brother, didn’t you say that my men are no good? Now, us brother and sister are going to fight!”

Regarding Ye Yuan’s strength, Fan Yu was greatly astonished too.

Only then did he know that he seemed to have really misunderstood his younger sister.

This Source Night, not only did he have the looks, he even had the strength!

The argument of relying on looks to get his position was probably false.

“Heh, then us brother and sister will compete! I’ll say it first, they won’t go easy. These things are too tempting, even if I make them go easy, they wouldn’t be willing either,” Fan Yu said with a laugh.

Li Ji smiled and said, “I won’t go easy too!”

The first team up in this round was Ka Xin’s team and You Dan’s team. After a bout of fierce fighting, it was still Ka Xin’s team who won.

Such a battle, what it tested most was the balance of the three people’s strength.

Clearly, the strength of Ka Xin’s group of three were all steady until it terrified people.

The advantage of the City Lord Manor could not be what the other three families could compare to.

When the other two teams were fighting, Pei Lan pulled Luo Qi to one side and said in a low voice, “This round, if he still dares to sleep, we’ll directly admit defeat! Didn’t this kid scam us? This time, we’ll scam him too! Young master Fan Yu’s those three aren’t nice people. Either way, you and I can’t win either. If this kid is wise, perhaps we’d still have hopes of winning.”

Luo Qi nodded his head and said, “Alright, do it that way!”
