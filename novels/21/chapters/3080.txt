Chapter 3079: Laying Out the Future!

Birds cry plaintively before they die; men speak kindly in the presence of death.

Ancestor Endless was not a kind person. Otherwise, he would not have defended the Zhou Family’s supreme position for hundreds of thousands of years.

But this time, he was really injured.

In the Labyrinth Divine Palace battle, he hurt his Dao foundation. There was no more hope of transcending the Great Beyond in this lifetime.

Therefore, he needed to arrange for the Zhou Family’s future.

In the Zhou Family, only Zhou Xianchen’s talent was the most significant. He was naturally the focus of heavy grooming.

“Ancestor, you can definitely recover your strength! Our Zhou Family won’t fall!” Zhou Xianchen said in tears.

Ancestor Endless smiled and said, “I’m clear about my situation. This time, after almost being refined by Old Man Heavenless and also sustaining heavy wounds in the Eternal River’s chaos, my Dao foundation is already ruined. Even if I recover, my strength can’t recover to the peak anymore either. In fact, I can’t even maintain Great Beyond Realm anymore too!?Hur hur,?it’s all the influence of greed! Xianchen, in the future, you have to remember this ancestor’s lesson!”

Zhou Xianchen knelt down and said, “This child will bear it in mind!”

Ancestor Endless nodded his head and continued, “Xianchen, you’ve already entered Hegemon Realm. This ancestor no longer has anything to teach you. Your cultivation realm in the future will depend on your fortunes. Now, this ancestor will give you a mission. You must complete it!”

Seeing Ancestor Endless say it solemnly, Zhou Xianchen’s expression turned somber, and he said solemnly, “Ancestor, please instruct. Even if I lay down my life, Xianchen will complete it too!”

Ancestor Endless said, “Tomorrow, you lead half of Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s forces, and go to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven to cast your lot with Ye Yuan!”

Zhou Xianchen’s entire body trembled, and he cried out in shock, “What?! This … How can we do this?”

......

This order surprised Zhou Xianchen too much.

He did not expect his ancestor to actually make such a shocking move.

Half of the Zhou Family’s forces, that was absolutely terrifying to the extreme.

This strength was sufficient to sweep across Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

One had to know that Zhoutian Emperor Palace had three Supreme Hegemons, seven to eight Peak Hegemons, and even more ordinary Hegemons.

And this was also where the Zhou Family’s foundation lay.

Now, he was actually going to make half of the forces go to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

This was a huge gamble!

Ancestor Endless smiled and said, “This ancestor knows what you want to say, but right now, the 33 Heavens’ situation is already very clear. It’s time to pick a side. Indeed, under those three old monsters’ powerful strength, the current Ye Yuan is still not considered much. But, once he can break the shackles and break through to Hegemon Realm, even if it’s those three old monsters, they will tremble too!”

Zhou Xianchen said in confusion, “I know that Ye Yuan’s talent is unprecedented throughout the ages, but he’s a divergent cultivator after all! Although he has already broken through to Emperor Sakra Heaven, he’s still far away from the three great ancestors’ realm, no?”

The look in Ancestor Endless’ eyes revealed a wise light, and he said with a nod, “I don’t understand this Ye Yuan, but I understand Old Man Heavenless! Someone that can make him afraid is absolutely worth us casting our lots! Doesn’t Old Man Heavenless know that he’s a divergent cultivator? But why is he still afraid of Ye Yuan? There weren’t divergent cultivators who broke through to Hegemon Realm in the past, but it doesn’t mean that there won’t be in the future, understand?”

Zhou Xianchen was shocked in his heart and nodded solemnly.

He did not expect Ancestor to actually evaluate Ye Yuan from this angle.

Who was Ancestor Heavenless?

That was humanity’s number one major power, the strongest genius since ancient times!

He was afraid, which meant that Ye Yuan had hope of breaking through to Hegemon Realm!

The next day, Zhoutian Emperor Palace brought half of Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s forces, shattering the void and leaving!

Half of this force was not just Hegemon Realm. There were also the powerhouses under Hegemon Realm, and the number reached tens of thousands of people!

These were all the Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s elite forces.

This matter caused a great sensation in Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven.

Regarding Ancestor Endless’ decision, the other three great factions all turned their noses up in disdain.

In the Eternal River’s branch stream, the Zuo Family’s ancestor said with a snicker,?“Hur hur,?Ancestor Eternal River suffered too great a stimulus this time. He actually made such a stupid move! He actually bet all of the Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s treasures on a divergent cultivator.”

“It’s also an action that can’t be helped. Old Man Heavenless is about to see the light of day again. He has already offended Old Man Heavenless badly. It’s naturally impossible to seek refuge with him anymore,” Melody Nether Heavenly Sect’s ancestor said coolly.

“Zhoutian Emperor Palace is considered finished. However, we’ve also reached the point of taking sides! When Ancestor Heavenless returns, he probably won’t allow us to refuse!” Purple Extreme Heaven Pavilion’s ancestor let out a sigh and said.

The moment he said so, the other two people both fell silent.

… . .

On Heavenly Dragon Island, Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, the people in charge of the four symbols family clans were all present! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I object! Progenitor, I know that Ye Yuan saved your life, but you can’t use our entire clan’s lives to joke about too! Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven is where our foundation lies. But now, you want to go to a low-level plane. How will the entire clan view you?”

When Mi Tian explained his intentions, his own supporter, Long Jian, was actually the first to jump out and oppose it.

The other three clans’ leaders also all had tightly furrowed brows, rather unhappy.

The Dragon Clan was the Dragon Clan. In terms of bloodline nobility, their three clans were not the slightest bit worse than the Dragon Clan.

Now, Progenitor Mi Tian actually made the decision for them.

“Progenitor Mi Tian, this is also too ridiculous, right? This time, although you saved our three clans, you also can’t make our three clans bet all of our lives because of this, right?” Luan Qinghe said unhappily.

“Want to go, your Dragon Clan can go yourself! Our White Tiger Clan absolutely won’t leave Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven! Unless Progenitor Mi Tian, you, annihilate our clan!” Bai Zhi did not give the slightest bit of face and outrightly refused.

Xuan Taiqing said coolly, “Progenitor, wanting to make us migrate, shouldn’t you convince Long Jian they all first? You all can’t even get your people on-board. What right do you have to make us migrate?”

Progenitor Mi Tian smiled and said, “I presume you all have also heard about the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s matter. Now, the scheme has already gradually become clear. That’s right. Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven is indeed where our foundation lies. But can there be unbroken eggs when the nest is totally wrecked? Once the blood race army arrives, do you all really think that just based on us four clans, we’ll be able to defend Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven? Back then, during the Labyrinth Divine Palace upheaval, Heavenless that brat only temporarily didn’t storm Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven on account of this progenitor’s face. If the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s army really comes, can you all stop them?”

Everyone’s expressions changed.

These words were not false!

Progenitor Mi Tian and Ancestor Heavenless’ master were on very close terms. Ancestor Heavenless only did not make a move against Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven on account of his face.

But later, Hegemon Samsara took action. Apart from the dragon race, the other three races joined the battle too.

It was impossible for Ancestor Heavenless not to remember the enmity!

“Humph!?No matter what, making our four clans migrate for a divergent cultivator who’s destined to never break through to Hegemon, this is also too preposterous! Progenitor, pardon us for not complying with the order!” Bai Zhi said in a solemn voice.

But at this time, a figure suddenly appeared.

He looked at Mi Tian and said coldly, “Mi Tian, are you crazy? For Ye Yuan that boy, you actually want to make the entire Dragon Clan be buried in death? If you want to migrate, sure. You and I have a fight! You can talk again after killing me!”
