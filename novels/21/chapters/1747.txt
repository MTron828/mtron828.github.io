Chapter 1751 Gaining Something Without Risking Anything

“Did you hear? A new-arrival low-level apprentice dispatched Hu Feng and another two people to spend the night in the latrine the moment he came.”

“Real or fake? A newcomer is so impressive?”

“Heh, don’t you think it’s incredible? Competing in fire control, three people added up were not his match. Competing in combat strength, three people added up were similarly not his match.”

“It’s nonsense, isn’t it? These three added together, there are few who dare to provoke among priest apprentices!”

“Heh, you go to the latrine and take a look at the three of their miserable appearances, and you would know. They are still there right now!”

...

The news of Ye Yuan beating up Hu Feng three people spread throughout the entire trainee area very quickly.

But he himself did not have any awareness and slept beautifully, then headed to the Tianlu Pavilion.

Tianlu Pavilion was the place where the Priest Temple stored classics, pill formulas, pill refining techniques, fire controlling arts, as well as basic medicinal theory, etc; everything that one could wish for.

Since Ye Yuan came to the Priest Temple, he naturally would not give up on the chance to learn the demon race’s alchemy skills.

With his temperament, he naturally started learning from the most basic stuff.

Ye Yuan was clearly, those things that he secretly learned in the priest apprentice examination, were all relied on his powerful Alchemy Dao realm, as well as exceedingly high horizons, forcefully adding some human methods onto demon divine pills.

But that was already his limit. Wanting to improve further was impossible as well.

Wanting to make the Priest Temple attach high importance on him, he had to learn from the beginning.

Of course, with Ye Yuan’s present realm, learning naturally yielded twice the results with half the effort.

“Halt!”

Ye Yuan had just entered the Tianlu Pavilion and was stopped by a white-haired old man.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, he actually could not see through this old man’s depths.

“Senior!” Ye Yuan gave a bow and said.

This white-haired old man was at least a rank five expert too.

The white-haired old man glanced at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “You don’t have a single contribution point on you, so you can’t enter the Tianlu Pavilion.”

Ye Yuan was taken aback but understood very quickly. This white-haired old man must have sensed that the contributions points on him were zero through Tianlu Pavilion’s array formation.

“Senior, could it be that I became a priest trainee and don’t have entry contribution points?”

Contribution points this way of doing things could be applied universally in any faction.

It was just that Ye Yuan forgot to check his identity token yesterday and did not expect that he actually did not even have a single contribution point.

This priest was also too stingy.

“Rubbish! You don’t have any contribution towards the temple, whence the contribution points come from? A trainee who just came in also wants to enter the Tianlu Pavilion, truly nothing more than wishful thinking! Get lost, don’t obstruct this priest here!”

At this time, a voice suddenly sounded out behind Ye Yuan.

Turning around to look, it was a young man dressed in priest attire, his face proud, nostrils almost reaching the sky.

Ye Yuan ignored him, but asked that white-haired old man, “Senior, is it allowed to use contribution points and have wager battles in the temple?”

The white-haired old man nodded his head slightly and said, “It’s naturally allowed. But in the temple, martial arts fighting is forbidden, only alchemy fights are allowed.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The moment that priest heard Ye Yuan’s words, he immediately burst into laughter and said, “What a joke, a low-level priest apprentice who just entered, who do you want to have a wager fight with?”

Ye Yuan beamed and said, “You!”

The priest was taken aback, then immediately laughed loudly and said, “You want to bet with me? Hahaha, you don’t even have contribution points, so what are you using to gamble against me?”

While talking, Ye Yuan fished out a spirit fruit. The priest’s expression could not help changing and he cried out in surprise, “Crane Age Fruit!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Lord Priest is so knowledgeable! Senior, how many contribution points do you think this Crane Age Fruit is worth?”

This Crane Age Fruit was what Ye Yuan bought in Riverluck Capital City back then. The cost was extremely high.

The white-haired old man looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly. He did not know where this kid’s confidence came from, to actually dare bet with a priest.

But he still nodded and said, “If it’s the Crane Age Fruit, it’s worth 500 contribution points.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said to the priest, “Lord Priest, let’s not waste time too. You offer 300 points, I’ll use this Crane Age Fruit to bet with you. How’s that?”

The priest’s eyes revealed a covetous look. Looking at Ye Yuan like looking at a fool, he smiled and said, “How did the temple recruit a fool? Heh heh, since you’re giving this priest a treasure, it would be rude for this priest to not accept it. Okay, this priest will bet with you! Don’t say that I bully you. Bet on what, you can pick at will!”

A hint of slyness was revealed in Ye Yuan’s eyes and he said with a smile, “Don’t be so troublesome. Let’s just compete in fire control.”

“Compete in fire control? Heh, you really know how to pick! Give you a chance, change to others. Although you still don’t have any chances of winning,” the priest said.

At this time, there were people who wanted to enter the Tianlu Pavilion one after another but were drawn over by these two.

“This newcomer’s head is problematic, right? To actually want to find Priest Chi Feng to compete in fire control?”

“Who doesn’t know that Chi Feng is the number one fire controller among the priests. Where did this kid’s courage come from?”

“Heh heh, the ignorant is fearless!”

...

Chi Feng looked at Ye Yuan with a smug face and said with a smile, “Idiot, hear that? My alchemy skills are not the strongest among priests, but fire controlling skill, no one can surpass me! A trash like you competing in fire control with me?”

Toward this kind of guy who trampled on others to posture, Ye Yuan was most annoyed by them.

I didn’t find you and didn’t provoke you, was calling trash and fool over and over again very fun?

Just nice, he did not have contribution points. It was truly someone delivering a pillow when taking a nap.

Ye Yuan pursed his lips and said, “Is the number one fire controller very impressive?”

Chi Feng was stunned and said with a cold smile, “You’ll know right away how impressive it is!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So much crap, come on.”

Ye Yuan’s appearance was really asking for a beating in Chi Feng’s heart. He decided to teach Ye Yuan a lesson well.

Chi Feng kneaded seals with one hand, palm spitting. Countless sparks instantly surrounding Ye Yuan, akin to the starry night, drawing a wave of exclamations.

“Kid, have a taste of my Starry Sky. Let you witness what’s called the number one fire controller!” Chi Feng said with a hideous grin.

Ye Yuan seemed to have suffered a fright, crying out strangely, and running away with a whoosh.

When Chi Feng saw the situation, he could not help laughing loudly as he said, “Running? if this priest lets you, an apprentice, run away, wouldn’t I be laughed at by the whole temple?”

Chi Feng’s fire controlling technique was truly formidable. Controlling those countless sparks did not feel the slightest bit of strain.

However, Ye Yuan’s movements were extremely erratic and actually arrived in front of Chi Feng with a few turns.

Bang!

Two sparks landed on Chi Feng’s eyebrows. Only to smell a burning smell transmit over, his brows were gone.

“Pffft!”

Suddenly, a wave of guffaws came over.

“Tsk tsk, the number one fire controller is indeed formidable! This fire burning brows move, I’m in admiration!” Ye Yuan said with a look of marvel.

Chi Feng’s hands and feet were thrown into confusion, hurriedly putting away the divine fire.

But his eyebrows were already gone.

“You! You cheated!” Chi Feng pointed at Ye Yuan and said exasperatedly.

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “One must be willing to lose if they bet. So many people are watching, could it be that you want to renege?”

Chi Feng’s expression changed several times and he gritted his teeth and said, “Consider yourself ruthless!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t say that I don’t give you the chance. Now, I’ll use my 300 contribution points to carry on betting with you, do you dare to accept it or not?”
