Chapter 1477 Finally Solving the Mystery

Returning to the Fan Family, Ye Yuan received the token representing a guest retainer’s identity. They arranged for his residence, and he also received a guest retainer’s salary as well as four slaves. Only then it was considered done.

Coming to the courtyard where he stayed, Ye Yuan got rid of his attendants, leaving behind Long Zhan alone.

The current Long Zhan was already much older than that clone Ye Yuan encountered in the land of inheritance.

Clearly, these few years of slave life changed him significantly.

If not for the Sacred Dragon Token reacting, Ye Yuan would not even recognize him.

As for that clone, it naturally withered away between heaven and earth. It was impossible for it to pass through the World Locking Gate and come to the Heavenspan World.

Ye Yuan sized him up with an amused look, making Long Zhan very uneasy.

In the fiend race, if the master was unhappy, they could take the slave’s life.

“Do you know why I kept you behind alone?” Ye Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and said.

Long Zhan clasped his hands and said with a flustered look, “Master ... should have some matters to instruct!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heh, I didn’t expect that the dignified lord of the dragon race actually ended up in such a plight today. A pity ... lamentable!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Long Zhan’s entire body trembled, his eyes glued onto Ye Yuan, monstrous waves stirring up in his heart.

“Why ... Why does Master say this?”

The shock in Long Zhan’s heart could not be any greater. In the Heavenspan World, apart from those who came out of the Immortal Grove Region together, nobody knew about it at all.

But this new master of his blurted it out straight away.

Ye Yuan held his palm out. A small and exquisite fire rod appeared in his hand.

Long Zhan was no longer able to remain calm. His entire body trembled, staring fixedly at the Sacred Dragon Token. He opened his mouth, but could not say anything.

“You shouldn’t be unfamiliar with this thing, right?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Thud!

Long Zhan directly knelt down and gave three deep kowtows towards the Sacred Dragon Token.

When he raised his head again, tears already covered his face.

Over 100 thousand years, what was once the sea had now changed into mulberry fields.

But the former leader of the dragon race ended up a slave to others, his life and death at other people’s whim.

Agitating surging in his heart for a period of time, how could Long Zhan still control himself?

“M-Master, could it be ... could it be that you’ve been to Long Zhan’s hometown?” Long Zhan asked carefully.

He could not see through Ye Yuan’s actual situation and even thought that Ye Yuan sneaked into the Immortal Grove World and obtained the Sacred Dragon Token by chance.

“Heh!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh. The Sacred Dragon Token emitted a dazzling light. A gust of whirlwind rose from the ground up, but it was limited to within a range of 30 feet.

Long Zhan’s gaze turned intent and he said in terror, “The ... The Sacred Dragon Token ... acknowledged Master! This ... How is this possible?”

Members of the fiend race might be able to sneak into the Immortal Grove World and might be able to obtain the Sacred Dragon Token. But it was absolutely impossible to get the Sacred Dragon Token to acknowledge him as its master!

The Sacred Dragon Token was personally forged by the sacred ancestor with bloodline power. Even members of the dragon race could not possibly obtain the Sacred Dragon Token’s recognition either.

Those able to get the Sacred Dragon Token to acknowledge them as its master were only the lords of the dragon race!

But now, the Sacred Dragon Token actually acknowledged a fiend as its master, how could he not be shocked?

Suddenly, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body changed. The rolling fiendish energy retreated like the tide, turning back into the original Ye Yuan.

Long Zhan was simply about to break down. His master was actually a human?

He disguised as a fiend and all of the fiends actually could not tell!

Suddenly, Long Zhan’s gaze turned intent and he said in shock, “Could Master ... have come out of the Immortal Grove World?”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “You’re not considered too stupid! That’s right, I’m the same as you, coming from the Immortal Grove World.”

Long Zhan’s expression changed and he said in disbelief, “Impossible! The Immortal Grove World’s Heavenly Dao is already lost. It’s impossible for someone to pass through the spatial turbulent flow anymore!”

Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly turned cold and he said in a deep voice, “I’m just telling you a fact, not gaining your trust. Don’t forget your current identity!”

Long Zhan’s entire body trembled, his aura immediately cowering, suddenly becoming incomparably humble as he said, “Forgive my mistake, Master!”

Ye Yuan’s tone eased up slightly. Looking at Long Zhan, he said with a cold smile, “Do you feel that you and I share the same roots, and furthermore, I obtained the Sacred Dragon Token’s inheritance and should be endlessly grateful to you, and let you go free?”

Long Zhan’s heart thumped, his heart sinking to rock-bottom.

What Ye Yuan said was completely right. After he was shocked, he was secretly rejoicing.

Since Ye Yuan obtained the Sacred Dragon Token’s inheritance, furthermore, originated from the Immortal Grove World, it was impossible to not help him!

Just now, he was actually wildly elated in his heart.

But now, the situation did not seem quite right.

“This ... This lowly one dare not!” Long Zhan said aggrievedly.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, his eyes shot out a ray of cold light as he said coldly, “If not looking on the account of the Sacred Dragon Token, the moment I saw you, I’d think of ways to kill you!”

A piercing cold killing intent pounced from head-on, virtually asphyxiating Long Zhan.

Ye Yuan currently grasped the slave seal. He only needed a thought and could make his soul disperse!

“Don’t tell me that you all, these Deity Realm powerhouses, don’t know the Immortal Grove World’s fiend calamity! You all abandoned Immortal Grove World’s billions of lives for your own selfishness. So on what basis ... should I save you?” Ye Yuan continued coldly.

Toward them, these Deity Realm powerhouses who left Immortal Grove, Ye Yuan was filled with resentment in his heart.

If not for his sudden emergence, breaking through to Deity Realm at the final juncture, the entire Immortal Grove World would have already become purgatory on earth right now!

Long Zhan was silent like cicadas in winter and did not dare to refute at all.

The long life of a slave made him become extremely cautious and timid.

He knew that right now, if he spoke one more word, it could draw down a fatal disaster.

“Recount the events back then in detail. If there’s any bit of concealment, you know the consequences!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

Long Zhan did not dare to hide, saying the events back then as exactly as they were.

Back then, they were eager to leave the Immortal Grove World. On one hand, it was because Heavenly Dao was damaged. On the other hand, it was also because they dreaded the fiend race.

Because at that time, the Immortal Grove World was already unable to give birth to Origin Deity Realm powerhouses anymore. They were completely powerless to face the catastrophe of the fiend race.

These two things were like two large mountains, weighing on all of the Deity Realm powerhouses’ hearts.

Finally, after an equilibrium that extended as long as ten thousand years, all of the Deity Realm powerhouses finally reached an agreement, escaping out of the Immortal Grove Region!

And the dragon race’s old patriarch was one of the key members that facilitated this matter.

The initiators of this incident were that group of Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouses.

They convened all of the Deity Realm powerhouses that could be gathered in the Divine Realm and plotted this escape operation.

If anyone dared to stay behind in the Immortal Grove Region, they would become a common target for scorn.

Their goal was naturally not for everyone’s consideration, but that an additional person would be an additional assurance in passing through the spatial turbulent flow.

That was a journey with nine chances to die and one chance to live. One more Deity Realm powerhouse was one more hope to live.

It could be imagined just what kind of ulterior motives each had in the operation at that time.

And the meeting point was at the Chaotic Devil Sea!

That place was also the human and fiend, two races’ ancient battlefield.

Quite a number of Deity Realm powerhouses also left behind their legacies there.

Later, these hundred over people passed through the spatial turbulent flow, collectively escaping the Immortal Grove World.
