Chapter 1797 Old Youth

The drumbeat gradually subsided, everyone was still immersed in the midst of shock.Because no one could have thought that Ye Yuan could actually accomplish exactly the same as Baili Qingyan!

Among them included Jiang Xueyan and Duan Qinghong they all.

Deacon Hong’s pupils constricted as if understanding something.

“Ye Yuan, high-grade tier six! Passed the test!”

He looked at Ye Yuan, his gaze revealing a gratified look.

Deacon Hong thought in his heart, this child is different from the others and already saw through the Jadelight Drum’s reality, simplifying things by cutting out the superfluous, triggering the resonance of the Jadelight Drum with the power of Great Dao! It looked casual, but it’s actually no idea how many times more profound than others! Other people saw a hundred steps away, but he already saw a thousand steps away! Except, it looked like he still held back somewhat, but don’t know why is that.

With Ye Yuan not displaying his full strength, he was unable to judge Ye Yuan’s limits.

But without a doubt, Ye Yuan was a genius too!

At least, he was not beneath Baili Qingyan.

He originally thought that Ye Yuan was just a supporting character who only worked his way to first place by following Baili Qingyan.

Looking at it now, it was ridiculously wrong!

“S-So incredible!” Han Yong said in shock.

Although after he reached tier five, he had long changed his views on Ye Yuan.

When he saw Ye Yuan reach high-grade tier six effortlessly, standing shoulder to shoulder with Baili Qingyan, he was still extremely shocked.

Yang Fan had a strange look. He previously still thought that Ye Yuan boasted without coming up with a draft and that his behavior was flashy with substance, and could not get close with.

Looking at it now, he was really blind.

Ye Yuan saying that it was a breeze for him to pass the assessment, it was really accomplished with the greatest of ease!

Too effortless!

A casual flick and it was high-grade tier six, too relaxed and casual.

Ye Yuan slowly turned around and looked over in Jiang Xueyan’s direction with a profound meaning.

Jiang Xueyan’s entire body turned stiff and was actually floored by Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum!

Jiang Xueyan’s face felt fiery hot.

Ye Yuan used this light flick and gave her an incomparably resounding slap.

A moron could also tell that Ye Yuan seemed to have plenty left in the tank!

But he got a high-grade tier six.

This move of Ye Yuan’s had a deep meaning!

Firstly, Ye Yuan helped Baili Qingyan achieve the title of first place, repaying Baili Qingyan’s friendship and loyalty.

Secondly, Ye Yuan used this flick to tell everyone that he, Ye Yuan, did not rely on Baili Qingyan to get first place. He was very strong!

Thirdly, Ye Yuan was telling her, Jiang Xueyan, you cannot suppress my edge! As long as I, Ye Yuan, am willing, I can surpass everyone at any time!

This was a blatant declaration of war!

“The entrance examination ends here, you all will be my Shadowmoon Sect’s disciples starting from now! No matter which sect or faction you all belong to in the past, now, you all only have one identity, that is the Shadowmoon Sect’s disciples! Entering my sect, everything will be the sect’s interests as the top priority! If there’s any act of betraying the sect, kill without amnesty! Now, you all ascend from the mountain gate, there will naturally be someone to fetch you all in!”

Deacon Hong’s voice reverberated in front of the mountain gate.

The disciples all had fearful expressions, clearly frightened by Deacon Hong’s words.

Ye Yuan was very indifferent and did not have any surprised look.

The Shadowmoon Sect seemed to have many factions, the forces intricate and complicated.

Actually, that was just tacit allowed by the sect in order to increase the competition between disciples and accelerate their strength increase.

But, if someone jeopardized the sect’s interests, the sect would definitely annihilate them at all costs.

The Shadowmoon Sect would not nurture geniuses for other sects.

There were 43 inner-disciples who passed the examination at the end, and 102 miscellaneous affairs disciples. These people officially entered the sect under Qian Ye’s lead.

The Shadowmoon Sect’s main peak towered into the clouds, unable to see any end in sight.

Ye Yuan climbed up the steps along with the crowd, as if arriving at a fairyland.

And the spiritual energy thickness also became increasingly stronger as the height of the mountain got taller.

Just the spiritual energy concentration at the halfway point was already god knows how many times stronger than ordinary high-order imperial cities.

The Shadowmoon Sect had a main peak and nine sub-peaks, presenting the appearance of nine stars twinkling around the moon. All were majestic and grand.

Ye Yuan could feel that this place was absolutely a rich land that fostered great talents.

The nine sub-peaks were under the charge of the nine great skill-imparting elders. Disciples who entered the sect all have to be assigned under the name of a skill-imparting elder.

Of course, it was just belonging under them.

Skill-imparting elders were all True God level existences, ordinary disciples could not see them at all.

However, each skill-imparting elder had a rank six cultivation method in their possession.

If one could stand out in their performance, they could become the skill-imparting elder’s personal disciple.

At that time, they would be able to learn a True God level cultivation method and martial techniques.

This was what all of the disciples dreamed of.

Of course, in a large True God level sect, disciples ranging in the tens of missions, wanting to become a personal disciple, that was doubly difficult.

“This is your identity token! Kid, I have to admire you. Before even entering the sect, you already offended the three great factions and our Devil Elephant lineage. Do you know how many elders and deacons the Shadowmoon Sect has that all come from these three major factions?”

Song Ting threw the identity token to Ye Yuan and scoffed with a look of amusement.

Ye Yuan received the token and discovered that ‘Tianying’ two words were written on the back. Presumably, he was assigned to Tianying Peak.

According to Han Yong, Tianying Peak was the weakest sub-peak. The strengths of the disciples were the weakest, resources were the most deficient, and cultivation method and martial techniques were the most scarce.

Looks like he was indeed targeted!

Shadowmoon Sect did not lack geniuses. His performance was also not stunning enough in order to help Baili Qingyan achieve her aim and was unable to catch the sect’s attention. This was also what Ye Yuan had expected.

It was just that being assigned to whichever sub-peak did not make much difference to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan put away the token and said coolly, “What has that got to do with me? Only second-rate disciples like you will be interested in this sort of thing, right?”

“Second-rate? Heh, you actually said that the Tianzhu Peak’s disciples are second-rate?”

Song Ting deliberately said it very loudly, the surroundings immediately cast a series of unfriendly gazes.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh, “What I said was that you are doing this kind of welcoming new disciples thing, you’re definitely a second-rate minor character in the sect. Don’t you say so ... Senior Apprentice Brother Song? You’re not young anymore as well, but you can’t even break through to the Celestial Deity Realm and are still just an outer-disciple. I didn’t say that Tianzhu Peak is second-rate, I mean that you disgrace Tianzhu Peak!”

The more Ye Yuan said, the uglier Song Ting’s expression became.

Those unfriendly gazes also immediately became amused.

Calculating it, Song Ting was indeed an ‘old youth’ already.

With his talents, even if he broke through to Celestial Deity Realm, it was very hard to promote to an inner-disciple too.

Ye Yuan’s words poked Song Ting’s sore spot.

Ye Yuan being assigned to Tianying Peak, he originally came deliberately to give Ye Yuan a blow, and regain face in the passing.

He did not expect that he suffered a huge loss of face.

This kid’s mouth was so venomous!

“Brat, you just be smug! Being remembered by the three great factions at the same time, I hope that you can live for a month!” Song Ting gritted his teeth and said with a grim expression.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “No need for Senior Apprentice Brother Song to worry. I’ll live very well.”
