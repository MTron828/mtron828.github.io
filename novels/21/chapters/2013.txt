Chapter 2017: I’m Afraid of Scaring You

In front of him was a handsome young man. He was merely an Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity.

Beside him even followed a young lady. The two people’s ages were similar. They were a rather matching pair.

But behind the two people followed two True God Realm guards. Their background was clearly not ordinary.

That young lady said with a disdainful look, “Really shameless, I’ve never seen someone who dares proclaim to be the number one alchemy genius! My Big Brother Qian is the Zheng Family’s number one junior. Yet, he also doesn’t dare claim to be the number one alchemy genius. Who the hell do you think you are?”

Ye Yuan was speechless when he heard that. When did he say that he was the number one alchemy genius?

These words were clearly said by Ning Siyu, alright?

But this lass really knew how to draw aggro for him!

The moment Ning Siyu heard this, she blew up.

“What the hell is the Zheng Family? Zheng Family’s junior generation? Huhu! Forget about your Zheng Family’s young generation, even if the Zheng Family’s elder generation comes, my family’s lord will crush all the same!”

Zheng Qian was young, so how could he endure it when he heard this? He immediately smiled coldly and said, “What high-sounding sentiments! In this Southern Border, there really aren’t more than a few who dares to talk about my Changlin Zheng Family in this manner!”

His words immediately caused a series of exclamations.

“It turns out that it’s the Changlin Zheng Family. That’s an ancient alchemy family second only to peak holy lands!”

“The Zheng Family’s number one person of the young generation, Zheng Qian, he’ll definitely radiate splendor in the Cloudpill Summit this time!”

“Zheng Qiang! I heard of him before! He’s merely a thousand over years old and he already reached middle-stage Initial Realm. He has potential of stepping into the Dao Realm in the future!”

...

Hearing the surrounding people’s discussion, Zheng Qian had a proud look.

The Changlin Great Imperial Capital’s Zheng Family’s strength in the Southern Border’s alchemy world was an existence second only to these seven great holy lands.

The Zheng Family’s ancestor was also a rarely-seen Seven-star Alchemy God. Their status could be seen at a glance.

With Zheng Qian stepping into middle-stage Initial Realm at a young age, it was also something to be proud of.

One should not look at how Ye Yuan entered the Initial Realm, broke through to the Dao Realm along the way, and now, even closed in on the Ancestor Realm. Initial Realm was something that one could come across by luck, but not by searching for it to ordinary alchemists.

Reaching the Initial Realm was a very long process, requiring incalculable time to accumulate.

Recalling things back then, Xuan Yu lived to a ripe old age and was also merely at the middle-stage Initial Realm.

Zheng Qian was merely a thousand years old and he was already at the middle-stage Initial Realm. It was naturally worth being proud of.

“Hear that, number one alchemy genius? If you have the guts, let’s have a match!” Zheng Qian suddenly ignored Ning Siyu and provoked Ye Yuan.

Everyone used gloating expressions to look at Ye Yuan, feeling that he would not dare to accept the challenge at all.

Although Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was higher than Zheng Qian, their ages were more or less the same.

In everyone’s view, Ye Yuan put more energy into martial arts.

As for alchemy, this was painstaking work. So how could it be that easy?

Therefore, if Ye Yuan competed with Zheng Qian, he would surely lose without a doubt.

After all, encountering this kind of alchemy genius, there was only the outcome of being crushed.

Ye Yuan shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “Competing with me? You’re not qualified enough yet. Siyu, let’s go.”

As he said, Ye Yuan turned around and was about to leave.

Forget about Zheng Qian, a puny little Celestial Deity Realm, even the opponent was a peak Six-star Alchemy God, Ye Yuan could also crush the person without any trouble.

One had to know, Ye Yuan fought on alchemy with Empyrean Flutterfeather until it ended in a tie.

A measly little Zheng Qi, he seriously could not get interested.

But Zheng Qian sneered and said, “What do you mean not qualified enough? Don’t dare means don’t dare! Zhao He, Li Hu!”

The figures of those two True God Realms moved, blocking the two people’s path.

“If you don’t dare to compete, then kneel in front of this young master and admit your fault! My Zheng Family isn’t what just anyone can humiliate!” Zheng Qian said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan shot a glare at Ning Siyu. The latter stuck her tongue out mischievously and lowered her head, not daring to look at Ye Yuan.

“If you really want to compete, get your family’s ancestor over. As for you, better forget it, I’m afraid of scaring you,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The moment Zheng Qian heard, he smiled coldly even more.

“What a conceited brat! Forget it, since you don’t dare to accept the challenge, then kneel down and acknowledge your fault!” Zheng Qian shouted coldly.

As he said, Zhao He and Li Hu two people grabbed Ye Yuan, and they were actually going to forcefully make Ye Yuan kneel.

These two people were both Third Firmament True God powerhouses and also considered powerhouses of a region.

But unfortunately, they ran into Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s figure did not move and the two people actually grabbed an illusory figure.

It was just that these two people did not have time to be surprised yet when Ye Yuan already swiftly pointed out with a backhand.

“Pffft, pffft!”

It was only to hear two muffled groans. Zhao He and Li Hu fell to the ground at the sound of that and could not crawl to their feet anymore.

When Zheng Qian saw this scene, his eyes became wide-saucers.

Zhao He and Li Hu two people were both experienced veterans of a hundred battles. It was rare to meet a match in the same rank. But in front of Ye Yuan, they actually could not even receive a single move?

The surrounding people were likewise extremely surprised.

Disregarding how Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength was, his martial arts was also a little too strong, right?

“You ... What do you want to do? I ... I’m a member of the Zheng Family. If you dare to touch me, you’ll absolutely die without a burial ground!” Seeing Ye Yuan walk over toward him, Zheng Qian hurriedly took several steps back. He was saying threatening things but was inwardly shaking.

“Oh? Is that so?”

Ye Yuan looked at Zheng Qian with a look of amusement. Suddenly, he flicked his finger. A cluster of fire suddenly flew towards the other party.

Zheng Qian was first stunned, then immediately laughed coldly and said, “Playing with fire with me? Overestimating your own ability too much! I’ll let you witness this young master’s fire controlling art!”

It was only to see the seals in his hand change irregularly, and he suddenly shouted loudly, “Freeze for me!”

That cluster of fire indeed paused, and it actually froze three feet in front of Zheng Qian.

“What formidable fire controlling technique! Indeed well-deserving of being the Zheng Family’s number one genius!”

“Impressive, impressive! Although that kid’s Martial Dao is strong, playing with fire is showing off in the presence of an expert.”

“Heh, a single mistake and he’ll have to suffer silent loss himself!”

...

A series of exclamations came from all around. Clearly, they were all astounded by Zheng Qian’s fire controlling art.

Zheng Qian laughed loudly and said, “Do you want to use fire controlling technique to tell me that your Alchemy Dao is very strong? Then this young master has no choice but to tell you that you’re too weak! Watch out, return for me!”

Zheng Qi kneaded another seal and fired it over toward that cluster of fire.

Whoosh!

The flame suddenly disappeared!

Zheng Qian’s gaze turned intent, currently wondering what happened when suddenly, the girl next to him cried out in surprise.

“Your head! Big Brother Qian, your head!”

“My head? What’s wrong with my head?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Zheng Qian felt baffled and reached his hand out toward his head to touch.

With this touch, he could not help jumping with fright.

His head was extremely smooth like it was smeared with oil.

His head full of hair was actually all gone!

At this moment, the top of Zheng Qian’s head was brilliant enough to reflect one’s image, shimmering with light, like a lamp.

“Pfft!”

“Hahaha ...”

A wave of guffaws came from all around. Zheng Qian’s face was red with a tint of black, wishing to find a hole in the ground to tunnel into.

He immediately revolved divine essence, wanting to grow hair. But it was completely useless.

He discovered that the pores on top of his head seemed to all be sealed, unable to grow hair at all.

This shock was by no means insignificant!

He looked toward Ye Yuan with immense shock but saw that Ye Yuan was currently looking at him with a look of amusement. Ye Yuan said with a smile, “This time, just take it as a small punishment. If there’s still a next time, you won’t get off so easily!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan brought along Ning Siyu, turned around, and left.
