Chapter 2659: Disciplining

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Big baddy brother, how can you be so strong?”

The little girl opened her eyes wide to look at Ye Yuan, a look of surprise on her face.

A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum was actually even stronger than her!

She utilized the Emerald Sea Divine Conch and was actually unable to do anything to Ye Yuan.

“But it’s useless!”

It was only to see the little girl muttering something. The Emerald Sea Divine Conch seemed to have been inspired, bursting forth with an even stronger light halo.

The entire Calm South City fell into a huge panic all at once.

Cui Tong’s complexion was deathly pale as he said in shock, “Is this the power of a legendary grandmist treasure? This power seems to be like Heavenly Dao pressing down! Even if it’s a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, they will probably perish under this attack too!”

Ye Yuan’s face finally revealed a solemn expression.

The power of this grandmist treasure was simply too terrifying.

Even he felt heart palpitations too.

Without a doubt, once this move landed, it would absolutely be an earth-shattering blow!

Most likely, the entire Calm South City would be directly destroyed.

Ye Yuan did not expect that a little girl was actually so terrifying that she could unleash this kind of terrifying power.

Seeing that Ye Yuan’s expression changed, the little girl seemed to have the delight of winning and said with a giggle, “Big baddy brother, you know my prowess now, right? Relax, I won’t kill you. I’m just going to beat you flat on the ground!”

Although the little girl was capricious, she did not seem to be a bloodthirsty person.

Ye Yuan’s expression was livid. But right at this time, that mysterious calling sensation previously welled up in his heart again.

It was precisely by absorbing this mysterious power, that Ye Yuan broke through to the realm of grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven within a short time.

That was the power of bloodline!

At this time, Ye Yuan naturally would not let go of this opportunity.

Following that mysterious power, Ye Yuan searched for it.

The blood in Ye Yuan’s body started boiling again.

After ascending to Heavenly Stratum, the true dragon power in Ye Yuan’s body seemed to have already incubated, without the slightest activity.

But at this time, this mysterious power was hooked out by the Emerald Sea Divine Conch.

Ye Yuan suddenly snapped open his eyes and let out a cold cry, “Collect!”

The terrifying power that covered the city immediately disappeared without a trace.

The Emerald Sea Divine Conch also turned into a beam of light and flew into Ye Yuan’s hand.

The little girl opened her eyes wide, looking at this scene with a look of disbelief on her face.

“Y-Y-You … What did you do?” A look of fear finally showed on the little girl’s face.

And the city full of people let out a long sigh of relief too.

It was just that their eyes when looking at Ye Yuan became even weirder.

Just how many trump cards did this guy have?

The Emerald Sea Divine Conch was clearly this girl’s lifeblood treasure. How did it suddenly get collected by Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan looked at the little girl with an unfriendly expression and said with a cold snort, “It doesn’t matter what I’ve done. What’s important is what you’ve done!”

Swoosh!

His voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan’s figure flashed, already arriving in front of the little girl.

The little girl’s final reliance was also gone at this time, turning pale with fright. How could she still have the courage to fight back?

Ye Yuan came in a threatening manner and scattered the divine essence that the little girl had gathered with a slap.

Then, he scooped the little girl up and smacked the girl’s buttocks vigorously.

Slap, slap, slap?…

Smack after smack, making everyone dumbfounded with shock.

That appearance was just like a father using corporal punishment on his child.

These few slaps by Ye Yuan carried divine essence.

The little girl’s tears actually streamed down like pearls in her pain.

Each of Ye Yuan’s slaps was very vicious. The little girl was still unwilling to submit at first, attempting to condense divine essence to break free from Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan did not give her the chance at all. Before her divine essence was gathered, it would be scattered by Ye Yuan.

“Bad big brother! Stinking big brother! The number one baddest big brother in the world! Even Royal Father and Royal Mother can’t bear to hit me, but you actually dared to hit my buttocks! After going back, I’ll definitely tell Royal Father and have him hit your buttocks too!”

The current little girl was exactly the same as an ordinary little girl.

While Cui Tong and the rest exchanged glances, having shocked expressions on their faces.

Without a doubt, this little girl’s royal father was the king of the Thistle South Sea Region, the Black Flood Dragon King!

“Master Ye, you can’t hit anymore! Don’t hit!”

Cui Tong hurriedly spoke up: “This little girl should be Black Flood Dragon King’s newly gained daughter 100 years ago! I heard that she’s pampered to the extreme! Insulting Her Highness, Little Dragon Girl like this, Black Flood Dragon King definitely won’t let you off!”

Heavenly South had always paid close attention to the Thistle South Royal Clan’s dynamics.

A hundred years ago, Black Flood Dragon King and the merfolk tribe’s holy daughter got together and gave birth to a little dragon girl.

This little dragon girl’s bloodline power was extremely powerful, even stronger than the Black Flood Dragon King!

After being born, she was regarded as the apple in his eyes, and she was incomparably doted upon.

This Little Dragon Girl was merely a hundred years old and was actually already Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum. Her talent could be seen.

Ye Yuan was expressionless and was not moved at all.

This little girl was lawless and unbridled and almost caused a great disaster. Yet, she behaved completely fine.

Not teaching her a bit of lesson, she would surely be the bane of Heavenly South in the future.

“Wah, wah, wah?…”

Little Dragon Girl wept heavily, tears quickly turning into a huge ocean.

Before long, Calm South City’s water level actually reached the knee! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Girlie, do you know that you’re wrong yet?” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

“I’m not wrong!”

Pah!

“Know that you’re wrong yet?”

“Ouch,?I … I know that I was wrong! Nice big brother, you’re my bestest bestest big brother, I beg you, stop hitting!?Sniff, sniff, sniff?…”

Ye Yuan finally let the girl go, only to discover that her eyes were already swollen from crying.

However, Ye Yuan did not have any psychological burdens. It was true that this lass was too roguish.

A hundred years of age was merely just a child to the flood dragon clan.

This lass was not wicked. But she was clearly spoiled rotten and was already lawless and unbridled.

If he left her to leave today, disregarding that a long war would happen between Heavenly South and Thistle South, he would also be killed by her.

This sort of thing made Ye Yuan very angry, so he struck extremely heavily.

The little girl used an extremely hateful gaze to look at Ye Yuan, daring to feel indignant, but she did not dare to speak.

Ye Yuan completely ignored her and said coolly, “If you want to leave, it is up to you! This Emerald Sea Divine Conch, I’ll be keeping it!”

The little girl gritted her teeth and said, “Leaving the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, I’ll dry up and die on land! Humph! You’re forcing me to go back!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So what if I’m forcing you? You, this girl, are too roguish. If you’re not disciplined, you’ll surely cause a disaster in the future!”

What was scary was not roguishness, what was scary was an existence whose mischievousness became second nature, and had terrifying talent too.

Ye Yuan knew that this little girl was extremely talented.

At a young age, she already comprehended the rule of water to an extremely high realm.

If she harbored malicious intent in the future, the people will probably be plunged into misery and suffering.

“Alright, it’s almost time. I’m going to return the Emerald Sea Divine Conch!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Wait a minute!”

Right at this time, there was an undulation from the transmission array in the city. Several figures appeared.

After these few people came out, they just happened to hear Ye Yuan’s words and immediately stopped him.

Cui Tong’s expression changed, and he hurriedly bowed as he said, “Deputy City Lord, Ironcore!”

Ironcore looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “This Emerald Sea Divine Conch is the supreme treasure of the Thistle South Royal Clan! It can’t be returned! Today, my Heavenly South army has already gathered. Even if the Black Flood Dragon King comes in person, we won’t fear him either! Come, hand the Emerald Sea Divine Conch over to me!”
