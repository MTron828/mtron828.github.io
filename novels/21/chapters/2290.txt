Chapter 2294: Looking at What?

Zhao Zixuan five people were well-deserving of being the disciples of ancestor-class powerhouses. The moment they made their moves, the momentum was astonishing.

Five powerful auras billowed to the sky, attracting more and more people to surround and watch, cries of exclamations lingering in the ears incessantly.

These five people were all extraordinary, but their refining methods were quite different.

What they were refining represented five extremes, just like the five vertices of a pentagon.

Unless your alchemy strength was balanced to the extreme, otherwise, wanting to win the five people at the same time was simply even harder than ascending to the heavens.

Alchemy techniques were eternally changing, but those that could attain the level of an ancestor, which one did not go through endless tempering?

Their unique techniques all had extremely unique aspects.

Even if Zhao Zixuan and the rest only learned one-thousandth of it, it was also sufficient to sweep across a region.

Moreover, these five people each had their own strengths. The medicinal pills that they refined were all fields that they were proficient in. Furthermore, it was very obscure.

The five of them had clearly already discussed it; it was to embarrass Ye Yuan!

In terms of seniority, they were all a generation younger than Ye Yuan.

Doing so, no one dared to criticize or comment!

A powerhouse like Zhao Zixuan normally rarely took action.

The moment he made his move at this time, he immediately overawed others by a show of strength, arousing a wave of exclamations.

Quite a few people all cast sympathetic gazes toward Ye Yuan, thinking that he was screwed for sure this time.

“I originally thought that for Second Sage to be able to be valued by Sacred Ancestor High Priest, he must have aspects that surpass others. But I didn’t expect that he’s an egomaniac!”

“Being able to be taken in as a disciple by someone of an ancestor-class, which one could be an ordinary person? This Second Sage underestimated the enemy too much!”

“Heh, if Sacred Ancestor High Priest was to lose, what he loses won’t just be his own face. Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s face will also be slapped resoundingly!”

... ...

In the crowd, two figures exchanged a glance and smiled.

These two people were precisely Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather and Leng Tianhao’s elder brother, Leng Tianqi.

Zhao Zixuan and the rest were instigated precisely by Leng Tianqi. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Although Leng Tianqi was the Medicine Ancestor’s grand-pupil, actually, the Medicine Ancestor’s seniority was half a generation above even the various major ancestors.

Hence, even though Leng Tianqi had a lower level of seniority, his friendship with Zhao Zixuan and the rest was still pretty good.

After all, who did not wish to curry favor with the Medicine Ancestor’s lineage?

He could not personally take action and could only borrow the hands of Zhao Zixuan and the rest to deal with Ye Yuan.

It was just that he also did not expect that Ye Yuan actually fell for it just like this, coming up with such a way to compete in alchemy. It was really ownself looking for abuse.

“Huhu, this emperor wants to see how the exalted Second Sage steps down from the stage this time!” Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather said with a cold laugh.

“Humph! If not for Master not letting me take action, I’d be able to waste him by myself! Just a little bastard who’s still wet behind his ears, Does he really take himself to be someone important?” Leng Tianqi said disdainfully.

The Medicine Ancestor’s lineage had always regarded themselves highly.

Whatever Second Sage was nothing in Leng Tianqi’s eyes at all.

If it was some reclusive elder, then forget it. Yet, Ye Yuan was a snotty brat. Why would he take him seriously?

The Heavenspan World’s so-called alchemy geniuses were practically all gathered here.

Even if this Second Sage was very formidable, how heaven-defying could he be?

“However, Zhao Zixuan and the others, their strengths are really strong enough. It’s probably not beneath yours already!” Azurefeather praised.

Leng Tianqi nodded and said, “The five of them are all geniuses that are hard to come across in a million years. In terms of talent, they are absolutely not beneath those few disciples of Sacred Ancestor High Priest! Even I also don’t dare to say that I can definitely win, and yet this punk really dares to be careless! But like this is good as well. Finally I vented this frustration for Little Hao. After this punk loses all standing and reputation, I’ll slowly deal with him!”

Azurefeather’s eyes were full of hatred and he said, “The humiliation of kneeling, this emperor will definitely make him pay a hemorrhaging price!”

... ...

Five days passed in a twinkle, this alchemy battle attracted more and more people’s attention.

There were even some Deva Realm powerhouses who joined in too.

The refinement of Zhao Zixuan and the rest already came to an end as well!

“Condense!”

Zhao Zixuan gave a cold cry. The light faded, a rank eight divine pill was fresh out of the furnace!”

Wiping away the sweat on his forehead, Zhao Zixuan looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile on his face, “How is it, Second Sage? A void spirit Seven Treasures Blood Congealing Pill can still enter your arcane sights, right?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Mn, it’s barely considered enough to enter my sights.”

This Zhao Zixuan’s strength was indeed considered very good among the young generation already.

Among the so-called alchemy geniuses that Ye Yuan had encountered, he was indeed ridiculously formidable.

It was just a pity that his opponent was Ye Yuan.

With regards to Ye Yuan’s words, everyone naturally thought otherwise, thinking that he was puffing himself up at his own cost.

The Seven Treasures Blood Congealing Pill was a rank eight divine pill. Furthermore, it belonged to an aberrant class among rank eight divine pills and was extremely hard to refine.

For Zhao Zixuan to be able to refine a void spirit Seven Treasures Blood Congealing Pill, it was sufficient to see how powerful his strength was!

One had to know, for ordinary Eight-star Alchemy Gods to be able to refine high-grade or superior-grade medicinal pills, it was already very impressive.

Not only Zhao Zixuan refined divine-grade, but he also even refined a void spirit divine pill.

This level was far from what ordinary Eight-star Alchemy Gods could compare to.

His refinement already exceeded everyone’s imagination.

The moment these words came out, it immediately caused a great sensation, cries of exclamations rising and ebbing like waves.

In the crowd, a middle-aged man called out, “Master Zixuan, I wonder if you’re selling this Seven Treasures Blood Congealing Pill or not? I’m Seven Star Establishment’s Mu Tiesheng. I’m willing to buy this medicinal pill with one billion superior-grade divine essence stones!”

Another person said in a clear voice, “Heh, one billion and you want to buy a void spirit Seven Treasures Blood Congealing Pill? Master Zixuan, I, Bright Mirror Pavilion’s Fang Tianren, offers two billion!”

“I’ll offer 2.5 billion!” Mu Tiesheng did not back down in the slightest.

“I’ll offer three billion!” Fang Tianren said again.

“You!” Mu Tiesheng’s expression choked up, he could not quite bear this price anymore.

While Fang Tianren had a proud look on his face.

Heavenly Emperor Realm powerhouses had their own circles. Rank eight divine pills basically would not circulate in the secular world.

Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure was formidable, but he was just dealing in the business of mortals.

But Mu Tiesheng and Fang Tianren, those two were truly major powers of a region, powerhouses who did the business of Heavenly Emperors.

Zhao Zixuan maintained his composure, watching the two people vie with each other. Only at this time did he smile and say, “Are the two of you not going to wait? There’s still a Second Sage here. Since he has the title of Second Sage, I believe that the grade he refined should be higher than mine.”

Fang Tianren gave Ye Yuan a glance and said disdainfully, “Just based on him? His hair isn’t even fully grown yet. Even if he is astonishingly talented, it’s also impossible to refine such high-quality medicinal pills. Heh heh, Second Sage? Really makes people laugh their heads off!”

Ye Yuan also gave him a glance, remembering this person.

He had no intentions of finding trouble with anyone. But this kind of idiot was naturally added to the blacklist by him.

“Looking at what? Not convinced? If even a snotty brat like you can become Second Sage, then wouldn’t Master Zixuan become a saint?”

In order to obtain the medicinal pill, Fang Tianren also went all out, directly stepping on Ye Yuan to flatter Zhao Zixuan.

Witnessing Zhao Zixuan five people’s strength, there was already no one present who felt that Ye Yuan would win.

After all, Zhao Zixuan’s strength already exceeded their understanding.

Sure enough, Zhao Zixuan was a real sucker for this, and said with a smile, “Pavilion Lord Fang indeed knows how to do business. After this is over, I’ll sell it to you.”

The moment Fang Tianren heard, he could not help being overjoyed and gave thanks repeatedly.

Finally, he even gave Mu Tiesheng a glance like putting on a show of force, being extremely proud of himself.
