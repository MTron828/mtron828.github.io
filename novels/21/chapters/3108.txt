Chapter 3107: Ye Yuan's Doom!

Above the void, a long spear was akin to a dragon, blowing away the firmament.

Saint force surged on Yang Qing’s body, fighting with a blood race Great Beyond powerhouse until they were locked in a struggle.

“Chi Hu, you’re called the blood race’s number one genius. You’re even a level above Bloodpromise. Looking at it now, it’s also nothing more than this! I only dare call myself the number two genius in the human race!” Yang Qing sent out a spear, directly sending Chi Hu flying as he said with a loud laugh.

At the opposite side, Chi Hu had a livid expression.

After three years of fierce battles, Yang Qing went from an unknown ordinary Hegemon to becoming a Great Beyond Realm mighty expert.

Yang Qing was forever that crazy. During these three years, he experienced countless narrow escapes from death, stimulating his potential to the extreme.

Coupled with Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s heaven and earth spiritual energy growing richer with each passing day, his cultivation realm also rose rapidly, breaking through the fetters of Hegemon Realm, becoming the ninth Great Beyond!

At that time, Chi Hu could not even be bothered to glance at Yang Qing because he was the blood race’s number one genius!

This number one genius was not Bloodpromise, that kind of person who had not grown up yet. He was a true genius!

Chi Hu was the blood race’s youngest Great Beyond Realm powerhouse!

But in a short three years, this cocky to the extreme fellow in front of him actually slapped his face.

He exchanged blows with Yang Qing but was firmly suppressed by him, beaten until he was depressed.

He naturally knew who was humanity’s number one genius that Yang Qing was talking about.

......

Ye Yuan!

Ever since going into closed-seclusion three years ago, there had been no news about that guy until now.

But the entire 33 Heavens had his legend!

It was him who overcame the raging tides with his power alone, completely reversing the 33 Heavens’ war situation.

During these three years, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army went on a punitive expedition, walking all over the 33 Heavens, rescuing countless living beings.

And Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army was also like a rolling snowball, growing larger as it rolled.

The blood race army had numerous powerhouses, far exceeding that of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. But Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army did not have the desire to linger in battle. Their objective was to save people.

And Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven also became the 33 Heavens’ final barrier. When countless powerhouses received the news, they swarmed over here one after another.

After experiencing the initial-most chaos, the blood race army gave up on fighting with divided forces and concentrated all of their military power on attacking Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

But, outside of the blood race’s expectations, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s boundary wall was sturdy to the extreme!

With Great Beyond powerhouses defending, they actually failed to invade. They suffered a huge loss instead.

As the commander-in-chief, Yi Xue was depressed to the extreme.

He could not figure it out, even after racking his brain. When did the lowest-level plane, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, become so sturdy?

After paying an extremely heavy price, the blood race finally opened up a hole in the boundary wall.

Hence, a drawn-out seesaw battle unfolded between both sides, all the way until now.

However, the terrifying thing was that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s boundary wall seemed to show signs of growing sturdier the more they fought!

The instigator of all these was naturally the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List!

After engaging in fierce battles for a long time, the power of wills gathered on the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List also grew stronger and stronger.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s boundary wall had a special characteristic: it was extremely averse to the blood race!

In contrast, when other races entered it, there were not many restrictions.

Therefore, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven also became the final fortress of all the heavens and myriad races.

Those remnant forces that survived entered Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven one after another.

Over three years, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s combat power grew stronger.

Facing the arrogant Yang Qing, Chi Hu burned with fury and said with a cold smile, “Number one genius? Someone that’s abandoned by Hegemon is also worthy of being called a genius? Heh heh, talk again after he overcomes the tribulation of Hegemon!”

Yang Qing followed up with another spear and said, “A frog at the bottom of a well! The heaven can’t stop Ye Yuan’s path of breakthrough too!”

Chi Hu was indifferent and said, “Is that so? This seat will be watching right here, watching how he transcends the tribulation! Hahaha! Also, Progenitor might come into being at any time! When Progenitor comes into being, even if he got lucky and transcended the tribulation of Hegemon, it will be a road that led to death too!”

Before Yang Qing could speak, Yi Xue’s loud laughter came over. “Hahaha, it looks like you all are still holding onto hope in your hearts! It’s impossible for Ye Yuan to successfully overcome his tribulation! Don’t you agree, Mi Tian?”

Mi Tian’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “If it was someone else, there’s definitely no hope! But he’s Ye Yuan!”

Yi Xue laughed loudly again when he heard that and said, “You’re deceiving yourself as well as others! Actually, even you yourself don’t believe it either, right? If I didn’t guess wrongly, you probably haven’t told Ye Yuan what he’ll be facing, right?”

Mi Tian’s expression was very ugly. This time, he did not speak.

How clever were Yang Qing and the rest? They felt that something was wrong very quickly.

He could not help stopping. He stared at Yi Xue coldly.

“Yi Xue, what on earth are you talking about?”

Yi Xue looked at him and said with a smile, “The 33 Heavens have existed forever. No idea how many things that had already been buried in oblivion. Of course, no idea how many geniuses had once radiated with light! Since time immemorial, formidable divergent cultivators weren’t just Ye Yuan alone!”

Mi Tian said in a cold voice, “Enough, Yi Xue!”

But Yi Xue was indifferent and continued, saying, “What? Are you not willing to tell them this bad news? But when the 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse is here, will they still not know? You are deceiving yourself as well as others!”

Yang Qing, Zhuo Bufan, and the rest, their pupils constricted, and they could not help looking at Yi Xue.

They had never heard of the 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse before!

Below Hegemon, some formidable individuals could call down the most terrifying Genesis Dao Tribulation!

Genesis Dao Tribulation was also called the Final Dao Tribulation.

Powerhouses that could call down Genesis Dao Tribulation, they were all peerless talents with extremely high hopes of stepping into Hegemon Realm. Their strength in the future would also grow stronger.

Yang Qing, Zhuo Bufan, and the others, they all had transcended the Genesis Dao Tribulation.

Genesis Dao Tribulation only had one wave, but it was extremely horrifying. Even if it was the likes of Yang Qing and Zhuo Bufan, it was not easy either.

But this 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse, they had never heard of it before this!

“33 Tribulations of Apocalypse! What … the hell is this? Senior Mi Tian, what on earth is going on?” Yang Qing asked with a livid look.

Mi Tian was silent, still not willing to speak.

Yi Xue smiled when he saw the situation and said, “Everyone knows that divergent cultivators have formidable strength that far exceeds their peers. But do you all know why no divergent cultivators have ever stepped into the realm of Hegemon before?”

Yang Qing and the rest exchanged glances, all with blank faces.

Everyone knew about this, but why was it like that? There was really no one who knew.

Yi Xue smiled lightly and said, “33 Heavenly Planes, how many cultivators are there! Since time immemorial, it has naturally given birth to many people who go against the heaven too. And among divergent cultivators, there were naturally amazingly talented individuals too! No matter how strong Genesis Dao Tribulation is, it’s also impossible that no one could transcend it, right? Just take Ye Yuan for example. Even if his Genesis Dao Tribulation is ten times stronger than yours, it’s extremely easy for him to overcome the tribulation too! Could it be that there’s only one Ye Yuan in this world?”

The faces of Yang Qing and the others also became more and more ugly.

They realized that Yi Xue was disclosing a gory truth.

They were not willing to accept the truth!

Yeah, how many exceptional talents had there been since remote antiquity? How could there not have been a few who defied heaven?

There was naturally no shortage of divergent cultivators too.

“Above Genesis Dao Tribulation, there’s still an even more terrifying calamity, that’s the 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse! This tribulation, forget about Emperor Sakra Heaven; even if it’s a Great Beyond powerhouse, there’s no way of transcending it at all too! Once this tribulation appears, it will obliterate heaven and decimate the earth; not a blade of grass will survive! The power is simply unimaginable! In the legends, this tribulation has a total of 33 waves. Each wave corresponds to one heaven! Why is it a legend? That’s because no one has ever seen the final face of this tribulation before! Nobody can transcend until the 33rd wave at all! The reason why it was given this name was also that when this tribulation descended, it would echo with all the heavens. Hence, people guess that this tribulation has a total of 33 waves!”
