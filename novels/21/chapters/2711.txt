Chapter 2717: Exiting Seclusion!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Cultivation was timeless, there were no years in the mountains.

50 years passed in a haste.

During these 50 years, Ye Yuan spent a rare period of peaceful days in the Myriad Demons Mountain.

On this day, outside a cave, Bright Tiger five people were fidgety, pacing back and forth continuously.

“I say, Golden Fur, can you stop for a while? You keep pacing around, Your Father’s eyes are getting dizzy!” Bright Tiger said in annoyance.

Golden Fur was naturally the Wild Lion King.

The moment Wild Lion heard, he said in a great rage, “Look at that tiger face of yours. It’s almost drooping into a donkey’s face. What qualifications do you have to talk about Your Father?”

This cave was precisely Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion venue.

And today was the day when Ye Yuan’s 50-year oath expired!

If Ye Yuan could not hand over the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill today, he would suffer Heavenly Dao’s backlash and die!

And the five of their Saint Sovereign Heaven dream would also be completely shattered.

Therefore, the five of them seemed very restless at this time.

Of course, more of it was worry.

“Sigh, I say, can Ye Yuan really do it? 50 years to break through a major cultivation realm and even have to reach that inconceivable realm in Alchemy Dao, it’s seriously too hellish!” Myriad Elephant said worriedly.

“Thinking about it now, it’s indeed a little too optimistic! This sort of thing, it doesn’t feel too probable when you think about it too!” Bright Tiger King said.

“There’s still less than an hour before the oath needs to be fulfilled! He hasn’t even come out until now. I’m afraid that his chances of coming out are very slim!”

They admitted that Ye Yuan was extremely monstrous.

But 50 years ago, Ye Yuan had merely just entered Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum and had not even begun researching grade three heavenly pills.

These 50 years, not only did Ye Yuan have to break through a major cultivation realm in Martial Dao realm, he even had to break through two major realms in Alchemy Dao!

This sort of thing, thinking about it did not feel too likely either.

One had to know, how many amazingly talented people had been blocked by Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum this threshold?

Jiang Li was known as Heavenly South’s number one genius and he was also sealed in front of this step for as long as several hundred years!

A martial arts genius like Luo Yunqing was similarly blocked for hundreds of years.

Breaking through to the realm of Sovereign required opportunity!

But only a short 50 years was given to Ye Yuan!

What was even more damning was that Ye Yuan’s incomparably profound alchemy path realm undoubtedly required even more time to polish.

Bright Tiger five people and Saint Exalt Bull Demon practically dug three feet into the ground of the entire Myriad Demons Mountain and finally gathered six portions of the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill’s heavenly medicines five years ago.

However, it had already been more than ten years since Ye Yuan’s last closed-seclusion!

They also did not know how far Ye Yuan had reached.

“Humph!?The few of you listen up, if Ye Yuan can’t come out, kill yourselves to atone for your crime!”

At this time, Saint Exalt Bull Demon who had his eyes closed all along not far away suddenly opened his mouth.

The moment the five people heard, their expressions changed greatly.

Ye Yuan getting killed by Heavenly Dao backlash was equivalent to severing his path forward too.

How could he tolerate this sort of thing?

Saint Exalt Bull Demon firmly believed that with Ye Yuan’s talent, reaching that profound realm was merely a matter of time.

But these five fools actually forced Ye Yuan to sweat a Heavenly Dao Oath and had Ye Yuan refine the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill within 50 years!

50 years was far too short!

How amazingly talented was he, Saint Exalt Bull Demon? Back then, he spent several thousand years to cross a major cultivation realm.

Let alone that Ye Yuan also had to spend a lot of energy on the alchemy path.

In the view of Saint Exalt Bull Demon, these five people’s actions were simply foolish!

Once a Heavenly Dao Oath was activated, it would be a dead end.

Even he, this Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, would not be able to undo it as well.

“Lord Saint Exalt, we …”

“Shut up! Are your brains all made out of shit? What can 50 years be enough for??Mn??Whoever speaks again can go and die right now!”

Heavenly Rat King was just about to open his mouth to provide an explanation when he was rebuffed by Saint Exalt Bull Demon.

They did not understand why Lord Saint Exalt would be so furious.

Even if a heavenly alchemist died, it was also not to an extent of being so irritable, right?

Rather, it was Bright Tiger King’s face that changed repeatedly, but he did not say much.

He learned about the secret of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses from Shuoyan.

If Ye Yuan died, it would be equivalent to cutting off the hope of Saint Exalt Bull Demon transcending the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation. How could he not be furious?

Following Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s fury, tranquility was restored outside the cave.

Time slowly trickled by, everyone felt each second pass like a year.

Finally, the time had come!

But, Ye Yuan still did not walk out of the cave!

Everyone’s heart sank to rock-bottom.

15 minutes!

An hour! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Two hours!

Ye Yuan still did not come out!

Everyone despaired.

“Sigh,?did he still fail in the end?” Bright Tiger shook his head, his eyes full of disappointment.

Another two hours passed, Ye Yuan still did not appear.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon opened his eyes. The disappointment in his eyes could not be concealed no matter what.

“Shuoyan, go and collect your big brother’s corpse!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said with a light sigh.

One sentence made Shuoyan’s tears directly fall down.

He struggled to stride forward, walking towards the cave.

When he reached the entrance of the cave, he could no longer take another step forward.

But right then, a figure walked out of the darkness.

Shuoyan’s entire body trembled. Rubbing the tears away from his eyes with all his might, a pair of tiger eyes became wide-saucers.

Immediately, the sorrow on his face turned into ecstasy.

“B-Big Brother! Big Brother he’s alright!” Shuoyan was agitated until his words came out flusteredly.

Including Saint Exalt Bull Demon, everyone present trembled all over.

“He … He really did it?” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said in disbelief.

Ye Yuan appearing safely meant that he had fulfilled the oath!

This nearly impossible to complete task was completed by him!

Inconceivable!

“He really did it! He … He really did it!”

After the shock, Bright Tiger five people were wildly ecstatic!

Ye Yuan completing the oath meant that they were already very, very close to the realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Even Big Yellow who had been honest and taciturn all along started trembling uncontrollably at this time too.

The current Ye Yuan appeared somewhat tired.

His complexion was a little pale.

It was like he had just experienced a great battle.

In reality, he already finished the refinement a few days ago.

However, he refined another three grade four heavenly imperial pills.

The goal was to wake Mi Tian up!

In these 50 years, Mi Tian had been in a deep sleep all along.

The situation of the dragon heart was not optimistic.

Therefore, he thought of using his bloodline power to reverse-flood the dragon heart, and make the dragon heart stronger again.

It was just that Ye Yuan knew that the dragon heart was like a huge container. With his strength, it could not be filled at all.

Hence, he refined three true grade heavenly imperial pills that restored the vital energy and blood, to help himself.

These few days, Ye Yuan kept pouring the power of vitality and blood into the dragon heart continuously, and it really had an effect.

Mi Tian finally woke up after sleeping for 50 years.

When he woke up, he was very surprised too.

Making a move the last time was quite damaging to him, he thought that he would fall into a deep sleep for hundreds of years.

He did not expect that he was actually woken up by Ye Yuan!

Seeing Ye Yuan’s mentally and physically exhausted appearance, Mi Tian was extremely moved.

This made him feel that he had found the right person!
