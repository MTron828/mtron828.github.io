Chapter 2253: Men Die in Pursuit of Wealth, Birds Die in Pursuit of Food!

Standing at the foot of Eight Void Mountain, Ye Yuan felt an upsurge of emotion.

The scenery before his eyes made the feelings of admiration in his heart arise spontaneously.

Being able to lay down such peerlessly magnificent and unparalleled ingenious array formations indeed made him have the greatest esteem toward its creator.

The entire Eight Void Mountain was an ocean of array formations, stretching in an unbroken line!

This place was like an impassable natural chasm, lying in between the Middle Realm and West Realm, separating numerous rivers and mountains.

It was very hard to imagine that such a colossal starry sea-like array formation was actually set up overnight by one person!

Just what kind of terrifying realm did this person’s Formation Dao strength reach?

Ye Yuan was unable to imagine it!

Over 60 years of comprehending Dao, Ye Yuan thought that he had already reached a terrifying realm in Formation Dao.

But in front of the Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions, it was not worth mentioning at all!

Eight Void Mountain’s grand array, what was truly terrifying was that the area spanning 80 million miles Eight Void Mountain was a grand array that blended into one harmonious whole!

Breaking the restriction by force was equivalent to facing the entire grand array, and would be instantly obliterated!

Hence, challenging the formation must have a formation path master to lead before one could go up the mountain.

Rashly entering the mountain was equivalent to a road that led to death.

A grand array that spanned 80 million miles, even thinking about it felt terrifying.

Ye Yuan even felt that this was not what human strength could accomplish at all!

And looking over, this grand array was formed by one small-scale array formation after another.

These small-scale array formations were interlinked, forming an organic entity, being incomparably harmonious.

This kind of means was God knows how many times more brilliant than Ye Yuan using the alerting restrictions!

One had to know, setting up a small-scale interlinked formation was easy, because the variables that needed to be calculated were relatively few.

But once the array formation scaled up, the scale of the calculations would skyrocket by no idea how many magnitudes of difficulty.

An 80 million miles colossal array formation, the computational complexity was simply unimaginable.

This kind of boundary was already not what Ye Yuan could imagine!

At this very moment, Ye Yuan finally experienced the feeling of there was always someone better, and heaven beyond heaven.

Ye Yuan had a feeling that the Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions were most likely the pinnacle work of the Heavenspan Mountain for countless tens of thousands of years!

“Ye Yuan, do you have confidence?” Seeing this kind of terrifying restriction undulations, Riverword could not help swallowing his saliva.

This place, it was difficult to gauge how many people had died every year in the past.

Even if one brought a formation path grandmaster here, a moment of carelessness and it would also be the outcome of turning to ashes.

“Are there other paths that can be taken?” Ye Yuan answered with a question.

Riverword choked, shaking his head slowly.

“Brat, see where you escape to!”

Right then, three terrifying auras arrived with a whistle. Shui Yuan three people finally rushed over.

“Go!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, directly turning around. He ascended the mountain.

Shui Yuan three people’s arrival immediately aroused the attention of numerous powerhouses.

Apart from the ever-present restrictions, Eight Void Mountain was rather like ordinary mountain ranges, being tall and having lush green trees standing in great numbers.

Of course, there were also many lucky chances.

Legends said that this grand array had once eradicated countless supreme powerhouses before, leaving behind countless lucky chances.

Hence, there were many powerhouses searching up and down the mountain.

“Two Empyreans bringing along a cripple actually provoked three Deva Realm powerhouses? Are they crazy?”

“They seemed to be hiding from the Deva Realm powerhouses. That’s why they fled here.”

“Heh heh, wonder if those three Deva Realms will give any rewards if we kill those few guys?”

... ...

Everyone was discussing the situation. Right at this time, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye said in a clear voice, “Whoever can keep this boy behind, this Deva will reward a peak heavenly emperor spirit treasure! Dead or alive!”

The moment these words came out, the mountain immediately boiled with excitement.

“Hahaha, boy, want to blame, blame that you shouldn’t have provoked such a powerful existence then!”

At this time, the formation path master who was the closest to Ye Yuan gave a strange laugh and pounced over toward Ye Yuan!

He was a peak Empyrean powerhouse and also a Seven-star Formation God.

The array formations at the foot of the mountain, he had already thoroughly familiarized himself with it and would not set off the array formations.

Ye Yuan just gave a cold laugh and snapped his fingers. A stream of divine essence fired at 50 feet in front of that person.

In an instant, an azure flame lit up. That person did not have time to cry out tragically and was already burned to ashes.

Everyone’s faces could not help changing when they saw this scene.

However, the allure of a peak heavenly emperor spirit treasure made them forget fear, pouncing over toward Ye Yuan this side one after another.

Ye Yuan’s face was cold, his fingers snapping repeatedly, igniting one restriction after another, annihilating seven to eight people with a snap of his finger.

Furthermore, his feet did not stop, walking straight up the mountain.

When Shui Yuan and Lonesoul saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Brother Heavenly Eye, it’s completely useless like this!” Shui Yuan said anxiously.

Heavenly Eye smiled and said, “This boy’s array formations are extraordinary. The solidness of his foundational skills isn’t beneath mine! Originally, I also didn’t count on these fools to be able to keep him behind. I just need them to obstruct for a moment and it will be able to let us catch up to him! The two of you, follow me. Make sure not to take any missteps! Otherwise, even immortals can’t save you guys too!”

The moment the two people heard, they could not help being overjoyed.

But in the next instant, Heavenly Eye continued, “Taking action this time already far exceeded my expectations. The price that we agreed upon before isn’t enough!”

The two people secretly cursed the sly old fox, threatening them at this time.

But at this time currently, it really would not do without him. They could only swear a Heavenly Dao Oath and agree to it.

Done with these, Heavenly Eye took a stride and walked up the mountain.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye was well-deserving of being a super Eight-star Formation God. His speed of ascending the mountain was not the least bit slower than Ye Yuan.

But currently, Ye Yuan had long already annihilated more than a dozen Seven-star Formation Gods and scaled to a height of more than a thousand feet.

After Ye Yuan killed more than a dozen people in a row, there was finally no one who dared to come up anymore.

But right then, the powerhouses on top actually poured down.

Seeing this scene, Riverword’s complexion immediately turned ashen and he said, “Damn it! The allure of a peak heavenly emperor spirit treasure is seriously too great. Even Eight-star Formation Gods are tempted too! With this, we’re dead for sure!”

It was true that Ye Yuan was formidable, but he was restricted by cultivation realm and was not as good as Eight-star Formation Gods after all.

Furthermore, these Eight-star Formation Gods had researched here for many years and were extremely familiar with the restrictions here.

Ye Yuan was in trouble now!

However, a hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and he said, “Sure enough, men die in pursuit of wealth, birds die in pursuit of food. Since you all want to set off on your journey so much, then I’ll send you all off!”

Done talking, he repeatedly snapped his fingers again, killing the Heavenly Emperor powerhouses that rushed up first.

Seeing this scene, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s pupils could not help constricting and he cried out in surprise, “Could it be that this boy doesn’t need to make deductions at all? It should be his first time going up the mountain. Why is he so familiar with the restrictions here? This Deva used several thousand years’ time when comprehending the restrictions below ten miles back then!”

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s shock was not shot at random.

On this Eight Void Mountain, each restriction was extremely complicated.

Formation Dao grandmaster took each step very carefully, akin to treading on thin ice.

Especially people who came for the first time and were not familiar with the restrictions here, they were even less daring to anyhow move.

A moment of carelessness and there would be the outcome of perishing and Dao dissipating.

Furthermore, the further up, the more complicated and profound the restrictions.

The restrictions on top of Ye Yuan’s head, those were all rank eight array formations. Its power was immensely strong, being sufficient to kill Heavenly Emperors.

Ye Yuan had not walked to that place yet, but he could accurately set the restrictions off to explode. How could this not shock Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye?
