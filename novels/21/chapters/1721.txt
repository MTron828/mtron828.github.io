Chapter 1725 A Myriad of Stars Surrounding the Moon

“What?! A thousand years later?”“What’s going on? Then ... wouldn’t I have no chance anymore?”

“I was still waiting to come and take part the next time. A thousand years later ... I’ll exceed the age requirement.”

...

Jian Hongxiao’s words dropped another heavyweight bombshell. Wails immediately filled the air.

A single period of 300 years, some geniuses had not grown strong enough yet. There was still a chance in the future.

But a thousand years later, the vast majority of these geniuses would all be over the age limit.

At that time, they completely would not have a chance anymore.

Presently, Extreme Light Imperial City’s signboard was extremely resounding. These geniuses getting Extreme Light Imperial City’s grand elders’ recognitions would be equivalent to plating on a layer of gold. Their statuses would be completely different.

It was also precisely because of so that Extreme Light Imperial City would be famous far and near.

A thousand years was too long!

Many geniuses could not wait!

But in Jian Hongxiao’s view, ten thousand people added up was also not as important as Ye Yuan.

To be able to make a young man who possessed the emperor surmounting aura owe him a favor was more worthwhile than a thousand, ten thousand purple extreme auras added up.

Having an emperor surmounting aura, that was an existence who could become a Heavenly Emperor!

Ten thousand true gods added up was also not as important as a future Heavenly Emperor’s favor, wasn’t that so?

For this, so what if he suffered Heavenly Dao’s backlash?

“Alright, all disperse then! The eight of you, come to my Profound Secrets Pavilion tomorrow for face-to-face instructions on how to proceed!” Jian Hongxiao waved his hand and disappeared.

The Hundred Battles Arena was also considered to have successfully concluded now.

But on the grandstands, two sinister and ruthless gazes looked over toward Ye Yuan.

One was Jian Ping, while the other ... was a girl.

The girl looked at Ye Yuan with a hateful expression on her face as she gritted her teeth and said, “Big Brother Yun, this enmity, I’ll definitely help you avenge it!”

Finished talking, she left the martial arts field along with the crowd.

Jian Ping’s gaze looked at the Jiang Mengqing in the crowd, a hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of his mouth.

“Ye Yuan, I can’t do anything to you in Extreme Light Imperial City. But ... you killed Xiahou Yun, so just wait for the endless pursuit!”

Jiang Mengqing was Xiahou Yun’s junior sister, and also his lover.

The reason why he promised Jian Ping to kill Ye Yuan was that he wanted to ask Jian Ping for help, hoping to invite Jian Shaoning to view Jiang Mengqing’s aura.

Originally, Xiahou Yun thought that killing Ye Yuan was merely a very simple task. Who knew that he actually lost his life because of this.

Below, the final eight all came up to congratulate Ye Yuan.

Presently, Ye Yuan was already totally different in everyone’s eyes.

These geniuses were all extremely arrogant at heart and haughty in manner. Normally, they looked down on everyone.

But a genius in possession of the imperial aura was destined to be someone of a different world from them.

Even if they were losers, it was also a cinch for imperial aura geniuses to break through to the True God Realm.

While their final objective was also merely peak Celestial Deity Realm.

Hence, for Ye Yuan to get first place, they had nothing to be unconvinced of.

Moreover, becoming friends with Ye Yuan might be able to get tainted with some of his immortal qi, letting their destiny grow stronger and break through to purple extreme aura, who knew?

After all, Ning Tianping was a living example.

Being jealous of people’s destiny did not have any benefits at all. On the contrary, becoming good friends with him could make up for a bit of destiny.

How to choose, the geniuses present were all not fools and naturally understood in their hearts.

“Turns out that Brother Ye actually possesses the imperial aura, no wonder you had such terrifying strength at a young age, Mo Fei admires!” Mo Fei said from the bottom of his heart.

Ye Yuan showed leniency, Mo Fei was also endlessly grateful.

Under that sort of circumstance, Ye Yuan could completely deal a killing blow.

One had to know, not killing people until that kind of situation was even harder than to actually kill people!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You and I have no grievances nor enmity, so what would I kill you for? It’s just competing in martial arts, deciding relative superiority and inferiority will do. Xiahou Yun was different from you all. He was hired by someone and wanted to kill me in the ring. If he wants to kill me, he naturally has to be prepared to be killed by me.”

The moment everyone heard, they suddenly saw the light.

No wonder Ye Yuan acted so ruthlessly. It turned out that it was actually Xiahou Yun who wanted to kill him!

Xiahou Yun’s destiny should also be blue color barring no accidents. It was just too bad that he provoked someone he should not have provoked, to actually want to kill an imperial aura existence. What was this if not courting death?

It was just that prior to this, none of them could have imagined that the Hundred Battles Arena this time actually had a genius who possessed imperial aura emerge.

Jiang Nan suddenly said, “If this is the case, then Brother Ye has to be more careful. Xiahou Yun’s father, Xiahou Wenjian, values Xiahou Yun greatly. If he knows that Xiahou Yun died at Brother Ye’s hands, he likely won’t drop the matter.”

Ye Yuan’s heart turned cold and he said with clasped hands, “Many thanks for Brother Jiang Nan’s reminder. This Ye got it!”

Jiang Nan smiled and said, “This Jiang originates from Zilian Imperial City. If Brother Ye has free time in the future, you can come to my Zilian Imperial City to be a guest. This Jiang will definitely treat you as a guest of honor!”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said with a smile, “Definitely, definitely!”

For some time, everyone surrounded Ye Yuan, all showing great hospitality.

Even the Ning Tianping by the side had no one dare to neglect him too.

After all, a purple extreme aura powerhouse, his future accomplishments were hard to say!

Ning Tianping never thought that he would one day be flattered and ingratiated upon by so many geniuses had felt like he was treading on air.

...

The next day, Ye Yuan came to the Profound Secrets Pavilion once more and entered Jian Hongxiao’s shabby room.

When Jian Hongxiao saw Ye Yuan, he laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha, indeed worthy of having the emperor surmounting aura. Little Friend’s performance far exceeded this old man’s imagination! Tsk tsk, Sword Dao law integrated with spatial law, that sword move was truly amazing! Furthermore, you even dual cultivate laws and body, truly broadening this old man’s horizons!”

Very clearly, he had always been paying attention to Ye Yuan’s battle.

His surprise at Ye Yuan was not the least bit less than the others. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Yuan’s realm was not considered the best among young martial artists.

But considering dual cultivating laws and body, Sword Dao law fused with spatial law, these few things combined together, that would be impressive.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior is too kind, Ye Yuan merely encountered some fortuitous encounters.”

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “To our Jian Family, everything and anything is closely related to your destiny. Lucky chances are naturally a part of destiny too. Little Friend Ye Yuan, this old man borrowed your power and influence this time without your consent. I hope that you don’t take offense!”

Compared to the last time, Jian Hongxiao’s attitude was clearly lowered significantly.

This kind of transformation was naturally related to Ye Yuan’s performance on the Hundred Battles Arena.

Actually, he did not judge that Ye Yuan possessed the emperor surmounting aura using the aura viewing art. He simply guessed it.

Although his strength was strong, he also did not dare to randomly use the aura viewing art to look at Ye Yuan.

If he was backlashed by Heavenly Dao, his old bones would be considered a goner.

Making Ye Yuan go take part in the Hundred Battles Arena, on one hand, it was naturally because it was inconvenient for him to take action many times.

While on the other hand, there was also the intention of observing Ye Yuan from the sidelines.

Clearly, the strength that Ye Yuan displayed was much greater than he expected!

And this also strengthened his judgment even more that Ye Yuan possessed the emperor surmounting aura!

So seeing Ye Yuan again, Jian Hongxiao apologized first.
