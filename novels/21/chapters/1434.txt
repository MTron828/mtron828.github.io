Chapter 1438 Fierce Fighting, Qin Tian!

The moment Qin Tian’s sword momentum rose, everyone’s expression turned fearful.

Even when suppressed by Heavenly Dao, Qin Tian’s strength was also so terrifying!

“Grand Chant Sword Void!”

This move was precisely one of Wu Meng Academy’s six supreme academy skills, the Grand Chant Sword Void!

Back then, when Ye Yuan had the life-and-death battle with Qin Shao, he had once witnessed the power of this move before.

Except, this move being displayed in Qin Tian’s hands, the power could not be mentioned in the same breath at all.

This was a grand completion Sword Dao second-layered heaven martial technique!

“Gui Yun!”

“Yes, Master!”

Gui Yun’s figure flashed out, facing off with Qin Tian from afar.

Qin Tian was an entire major realm higher than Ye Yuan. He was not what the current Ye Yuan could handle at all.

When Qin Tian saw the situation, he said disdainfully, “A mere late-stage Two-star evil spirit wants to deal with me? Do you think that I’m Qin Shao, that inept? Go to hell!”

Finished talking, Qin Tian’s Grand Chant Sword Void carried powerful Sword Dao laws and charged towards Ye Yuan.

Immediately, the entire space pervaded with powerful sword intent. The group of experts avoided it like the plague.

“So strong! His realm is clearly being suppressed a lot and he’s actually still able to display such a powerful martial technique!”

“Could it be that the strength of the outside world’s martial artists, they all are so powerful?”

“Truly terrifying! This person is clearly so young, but his strength is sufficient to sweep across all sacred palaces’ palace lords!”

...

The moment Qin Tian made his move, everyone was incredibly appalled.

But right at this time, Gui Yun’s hands drew a bizarre rune. After that, a surge of terrifying ghost energy rose up from under his feet out of thin air.

Gui Yun’s strength actually instantly broke through to grand completion Two-star!

“Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, Ghost Energy Spiritual Possession! Nether Ghostclaw!”

The moment Gui Yun attacked, it was two Ghost Dao Hundred Runes!

Under Dustless’s teachings with close to a hundred years of cultivation, his strength could no longer be mentioned in the same breath long ago.

He was already completely different from that evil spirit hiding in the Yin Wind Den!

Boom!

The ghost claw and Sword Dao laws collided together violently, shaking the entire cave until it was about to collapse.

Qin Tian’s gaze turned intent. Clearly, he did not expect that this Two-star evil spirit actually still had such means!

Two ghost runes adding together, he actually forcefully withstand a blow of his.

“Heh, indeed have some skill! But ... how much time can this trick last?”

Qin Tian laughed coldly, sword momentum rising again, directly clashing together with the Nether Ghostclaw.

Qin Tian’s strength was truly daunting to the extreme. Even when suppressed at grand completion Heaven Glimpse, the power of his Grand Chant Sword Void was irresistible too. The Nether Ghostclaw actually showed signs of being unable to endure it.

One had to know that when Gui Yun was at late-stage Two-star, he could rely on the Nether Ghostclaw to forcefully resist Huo Tianyang for several hundred moves and not be defeated. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Now, Gui Yun had ghost energy possessing, his strength skyrocketing, the power of the Nether Ghostclaw would also soar greatly. He actually could not defeat the Qin Tian in the same rank as him!

Even if his realm was the same, Qin Tian’s strength shook Huo Tianyang that fellow off more than a dozen streets.

If he did not have his realm suppressed by Heavenly Dao, his strength would definitely be even more terrifying.

The title of inner-court’s number one person was really not called in vain.

Ye Yuan’s expression turned grim and knew that it could not carry on like this.

He flashed, arriving behind Qin Tian. Raising his hand, it was a complete version Sundering Stars!

Who knew that Qin Tian’s back seemed to have grown eyes. He just casually pointed and directly annihilated this complete version Sundering Stars.

The powerful Sundering Stars actually could not withstand Qin Tian’s casual tap!

“Heh, just your bit of strength, you actually still want to play ambushing! When I take care of this ghost, I’ll let you know what’s called despair!”

Qin Tian who was in the midst of fierce fighting appeared to have plenty of room for maneuver, still having strength leftover to speak with Ye Yuan.

This battle’s situation was rather bad!

When Bai Chen saw this scene, his heart really burned with anxiety!

His omnipotent master actually encountered such a powerful adversary!

“Bai Xiu, what are you all still waiting for?! Could it be that you all are going to passively watch Master Ye Yuan get killed?” Bai Chen could not resist saying to Bai Xiu.

Bai Xiu had a conflicted look too and said with difficultly, “But ... He ... He’s an intruder!”

“So what if he is an intruder? You recall it yourself. How did Master Ye Yuan treat your White Night Sacred Palace! Without him, do you still have the chance to stand here and question him right now? Without him, even if you became the palace lord, can you withstand the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s assault? Without him, could you all escape from under the hands of the lava flying monsters and Giant Flame Stonemen?”

Bai Chen’s words were like a machine gun, bombarding everyone’s heart.

Bai Xiu fell silent, the expression on his face became even more conflicted.

While at this time, Ye Yuan and Gui Yun fell into a bitter fight.

Ye Yuan’s divine essence was already insufficient to support him releasing multiple perfect versions of Sundering Stars. He could only move around and continuously harass Qin Tian so as to ease Gui Yun’s pressure.

But his harassment also seemed to be trying to put out a cartload of burning logs with a cup of water.

Bai Chen gritted his teeth and said, “If you all are not going, I’m going! I, Bai Chen, am not willing to be an ungrateful person!”

Finished talking, he swung his long spear and charged straight for Qin Tian.

Regarding Bai Chen’s attack, Qin Tian completely ignored it.

Ye Yuan’s attack still posed a threat to him. But Bai Chen’s attacks did not pose any threat to him at all.

Bai Chen’s strength could not even breach his protective divine essence!

Bang!

Bai Chen’s heavy spear had not entered the battle yet and was directly shocked away by the aftershocks, immediately knocked flying out and smashing heavily onto the rock wall.

“Puhwark!”

Bai Chen’s internal organs shook, directly spewing out a mouthful of blood.

But he did not give up. Gripping his long spear, another spear shot over again.

Bang!

Bai Chen was flicked away once more without any surprises.

But the stubborn Bai Chen did not have the intention of giving up at all. He crawled up again and again, attempting to enter the battle time and again.

“Let me, Palace Lord!”

Mo Yun finally could not hold back. He held his long spear out and joined the battle too.

It was just too bad that his strength was likewise unbelievably weak.

“Damn it, don’t care anymore! I will screw you to death!”

Bai Xiu could not resist swearing and charged straight for Qin Tian.

He was a late-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses. Although his strength was lacking to Qin Tian, restraining him was enough.

With him joining, Gui Yun’s pressure dropped sharply.

Regarding Bai Xiu, Qin Tian could not possibly ignore him. He must divide out a portion of his energy to deal with him.

“I’m coming too!”

“I’m coming too!”

Seeing Bai Xiu join the battle, Bai Rong and another elder both charged over.

Five great Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouses plus a Gui Yun, six mighty powerhouses besieged Qin Tian!

Gui Yun was the primary attacker, the others restrained. For a moment, they actually could not determine who was better.

Qin Tian’s sword dealt with enemies everywhere, but did not fall into a disadvantage in the slightest!

However, Qin Tian also did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so popular.

Under the circumstances where they clearly knew that Ye Yuan was a trial-taker, the White Night Sacred Palace’s powerhouses would actually still help him deal with him.

Carrying on like this is out of the question. I need to finish off that late-stage Heaven Glimpse first! Qin Tian thought in his heart.

Suddenly, Qin Tian’s sword art changed, dealing a false move towards the Nether Ghostclaw, then stabbed toward Bai Xiu with momentum like a sudden peal of thunder which left no time for covering ears!

“Careful, Deputy Palace Lord!”

Everyone did not expect this sudden turn of events!

Right at the critical moment, Bai Rong actually pushed away Bai Xiu. This sword of Qin Tian’s stabbed into his chest!
