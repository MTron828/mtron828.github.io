Chapter 1402 Battling Hundred Cities“ Number One Person!

“He actually doesn’t know Jin Yu!”

“Did this guy ... pop out of a rock? These hundred over cities’ people, there’s actually still someone who doesn’t know Jin Yu!”

“If say who has the greatest hopes of reaching the Divine Lord Realm in these hundred cities, it’s none other than Jin Yu. There’s actually someone who doesn’t know him!”

Ye Yuan’s question made everyone burst into an uproar.

They were unable to imagine that there was actually still someone taking part in this Hundred Cities Smelting Trial who did not know Jin Yu.

Qiu Shuisheng was first stunned, then immediately laughed in spite of himself and said, “Perhaps this is precisely why he’s powerful!”

Jin Yu was also stupefied and blurted out, “You don’t know me?”

Ye Yuan also saw through from other people’s reactions. This Jin Yu did not seem to be simple. He could not help chuckling and said, “Apologies, this one entered the sect for a short time and really never heard of your esteemed self’s great name before.”

Jin Yu’s actions were worthy to be called above board and forthright, not willing to take advantage of him.

Toward such an opponent, Ye Yuan was still respectful.

Especially under this situation, storage rings affected the ownership of the final reward.

But the other party clearly regarded a good opponent more highly!

Jin Yu nodded his head, considered to have acknowledged Ye Yuan’s argument, and said, “This one is Yong Dang Capital City, Jin Yu!”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “So, it’s Brother Jin! Make your move then!”

Jin Yu said, “You just went through a big fight, better take a break first and recover some divine essence!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No need, those few guys were too weak.”

Jin Yu’s heart went cold and actually could not figure out the truth and falsehood of Ye Yuan’s words for a moment.

Was this guy posturing, or he really did not expend much energy?

This battle just now, if it were him, he could naturally accomplish with ease too. But he absolutely would not say this kind of words.

After all, He Ning, this level of expert, his strength was still very strong.

Moreover, there were still 14 other Zuo Xiang Capital City’s experts.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s words, in other people’s view, were undeniably him posturing.

“I admit that this guy is very strong. But saying this kind of words in front of the hundred cities’ number one person, Jin Yu, I seriously can’t listen any further.”

“This guy wants to keep up appearance to cover up his predicament, right?! Mn, at least if he loses, he can also say that he went through a big fight earlier! Huhu!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“He completely doesn’t know who Jin Yu is, and he also doesn’t know how powerful Jin Yu’s strength is. He Ning isn’t worth mentioning at all in front of Jin Yu! This guy is too condescending!”

...

How could they know that while that battle earlier looked fierce, Ye Yuan’s expenditure was actually really not that much.

Although Ye Yuan was unrestrained, wanting to challenge the hundred cities’ geniuses with his strength alone, he still attached great importance to tactics, and did not underestimate the hundred cities’ geniuses!

To him, the final result was secondary. What he valued the most was the interaction with these hundred cities’ geniuses.

Hence, that battle earlier, he actually fought very conservatively. Each fraction of divine essence was carefully calculated.

Coupled with that his divine essence was incomparably refined in the first place, this degree of battle was nothing to him.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s calm eyes, Jin Yu nodded and said, “Since that’s the case, make your move then!”

Ye Yuan did an inviting gesture, the Evil Extermination Sword suddenly attacking!

Sundering Stars!

Although it was Sundering Stars back and forth, this move had countless variations played by Ye Yuan.

This time, Ye Yuan did a lifting action, going from bottom to top, cleaving Jin Yu.

Attacks from this angle were very hard to defend.

Jin Yu’s expression turned solemn, instantly sensing that this sword’s intensity was no idea how much stronger compared to dealing with He Ning just now.

He did not dare to slight it. A beautiful tumble to the side, his long sword already attacked.

However, this sword of Jin Yu’s was a straight stab, pointing at the flat of Ye Yuan’s blade from the flank with a bizarre angle.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, instantly knowing that he ran into an expert!

Jin Yu’s comprehension toward battle was no idea how many times stronger than He Ning.

Martial artists’ battles, even when reaching Deity Realm this level, it was not simply relative superiority or inferiority in power of laws and realm.

It was just that powerful strength often made people neglect some subtle things.

A battle constantly changed. Oftentimes, a ninor detail could determine the outcome of a battle.

Ye Yuan had experienced god knows how many big and small battles, and had long already turned fighting into an instinct.

Hence, he could grasp every detail to win.

The battles that these academies’ geniuses had experienced were not few either. It was just that their battles were a completely different concept from the battles that Ye Yuan experienced.

What Ye Yuan experienced were all life-and-death struggles, not allowing the slightest hint of soft-heartedness. The opponent would not give you the slightest chance as well.

But the academies’ geniuses at most just sparred with each other. There were very few people who experienced those kinds of life-or-death struggles.

Only by waiting for them to promote to the inner-court and go out to carry out missions would they experience that kind of life-and-death struggle.

But even then, the battle experience of inner-court disciples also could not possibly be as rich as Ye Yuan’s.

Very clearly, Jin Yu was not a guy who only knew how to cultivate. This aspect just now displayed his skill fully!

Regardless of whether it was evasion or resolving his move with a tap, it all demonstrated his precise grasp of battles, without the slightest sloppiness.

More importantly, his realm and law comprehensions were all much higher than Ye Yuan’s!

This sword had not touched the flat of Ye Yuan’s sword yet when a golden light surfaced on Ye Yuan’s body.

In midair, Ye Yuan forcefully changed his move!

The essence of Sundering Stars, this move, lay in the word ‘chop’.

Jin Yu’s move was in order to break Ye Yuan’s ‘chop’!

Hence, Ye Yuan’s move change was to pull back this ‘chop’ word!

Ye Yuan’s move changed, chopping toward Jin Yu’s sword body.

Jin Yu did not have Ye Yuan’s powerful fleshy body. He was currently in midair, unable to borrow strength, and could only toughen his scalp and exchange a blow with Ye Yuan.

Clank!

Two swords intersected. The two people were seemingly struck by a tremendous force, each falling back several dozens of steps.

For the first time, someone drove Ye Yuan back!

“Fine sword!” Jin Yu praised.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “You’re not bad as well! Again!”

“Okay, again!” Jin Yu was also valiant.

The two people’s figures moved swiftly, battling together once more.

Qiu Shuisheng’s gaze revealed an incomparably stunned expression. What he was shocked by was not that Ye Yuan could fight to a draw with Jin Yu.

It was that ... he knew that Jin Yu actually lost by half a move just now!

Qiu Shuisheng understood Jin Yu very well and knew that this guy was a born warrior, his comprehension towards battle very high.

In realm and laws comprehension, he was about on par with Jin Yu.

But each time they fought, Jin Yu was always able to win him!

What he relied on was his instinct towards battles.

But just now, Jin Yu relied on this powerful disparity of laws comprehension and realm before fighting to a draw with Ye Yuan.

If Ye Yuan and Jin Yu’s strength were similar, no, as long as Ye Yuan broke through to grand completion Grotto Profound.

This exchange earlier, Jin Yu would definitely lose!

“Heh, I didn’t expect that Jin Yu will also have a day where he overwhelms people with power! He really met his opponent today,” Qiu Shuisheng muttered to himself.

“Opponent? Might not be so! Ye Yuan hasn’t used all his strength yet!” At this time, there was suddenly one more person by Qiu Shuisheng’s side, voicing out.
