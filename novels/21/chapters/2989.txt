Chapter 2988: Tragic Beyond Compare!

The water dungeon was huge with countless prisons. It was sufficient to accommodate tens of thousands of people. It was like an underground city.

No sun could be seen all year round in this place. It was as if it was hell on earth.

Ye Yuan saw that there were some who were already tormented until they did not look human anymore.

There were not only true spirits here. There were many humans too.

It was just that those humans were all in great agony, struggling and rolling around in the water dungeon.

“Argh!?I beg you all, kill me!”

“You bunch of brutes, even if I become a ghost, I won’t let you all off too!”

“It hurts! It’s hurting me to death! I … I’m going to explode!”

Everyone looked over, only to see a human powerhouse swell up into a ball. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Then, with a bang, he exploded into a cloud of minced meat, very bloody.

The few people’s complexions were deathly pale. Although they had fought countless battles, they had never seen this kind of extremely tragic scene before.

People were less than animals in this place!

“Where … Where on earth is this place? Why does the Divine Dragon Envoy do this kind of cruel thing?” Long Yi could not resist asking.

“Huhu,?this is for our dragon race’s future! If we can grasp the secret of bloodline evolution, then everyone will be able to become Hegemons! Our dragon race will be able to become the overlord of myriad worlds! Even thinking about it makes people excited! This Blood Dragon Island was constructed for this. Your bloodlines shall also contribute a portion of strength for the dragon race’s future!” The Divine Dragon Envoy’s eyes were full of fanaticism.

“E-Everyone becoming Hegemon?” Long Yi’s entire body trembled as he said.

The Divine Dragon Envoy smiled and said, “That’s right! This Blood Dragon Island has already been built for more than 100 thousand years! In the past 100 thousand years, we’ve made tremendous progress! The day where everyone can become Hegemon isn’t far off!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan pointed at a metal jail and said, “Are you talking about him?”

Inside the metal jail, a half-human half-beast fellow was currently staring fixedly at the few people who came in with scarlet-red eyes, giving people an extremely dangerous feeling.

One could tell from his appearance that this should have originally been a human. But, he grew a pair of weird wings on his body, his ears were also sharpened to a point, his mouth growing out savage tusks, his entire person looking incomparably strange and ugly.

His four limbs were on the ground. Actually, it could not be counted as four limbs anymore because his four limbs were all animal legs.

However, the first feeling that he gave Ye Yuan was not ferociousness but wretchedness!

He had the origin of blood and could feel that this person had mixed at least more than ten types of bloodline power in his body.

And these dozen over kinds of bloodline powers could not be superimposed perfectly. They would even have conflicts with each other.

He could feel how much pain this person had to endure.

Of course, this person already completely did not have his own consciousness. He was filled with killing intent throughout his body.

This half-human half-beast fellow actually already reached the Hegemon Realm!

Around him, those ferocious ‘beasts’ did not even dare to breathe loudly, instinctively fearing him.

Clearly, this guy was very dangerous.

But the killing intent in Ye Yuan’s heart started surging uncontrollably.

This bunch of guys simply had no bottom line when doing things!

The Divine Dragon Envoy seemed to be very proud of himself as he said, “That’s right! This guy is called Zhao Yue. He was originally just a good-for-nothing. After he cultivated to Emperor Vast Heaven, he was unable to make any more advancements! It was us who bestowed upon him eternal life, possessing sublime strength!”

“Roar!”

A terrifying to the extreme aura came over. Everyone saw Zhao Yue pouncing over here.

Even if these were all geniuses, even if they clearly knew that the likelihood of Zhao Yue breaking out of the locked cage was not high, they were still frightened until they took several steps back.

“Awoo!”

The water prison surged with electricity. Zhao Yue screamed miserably and was directly electrocuted back.

This water prison was clearly specially constructed. It could even withstand the Hegemon Realm Zhao Yue.

Ye Yuan was shocked in his heart. Then how strong was the person who fixed up the cage?

Could it be that the Heavenly Dragon Island’s upper echelons had something to do with this too?

Highly probable!

The reason why he went deep into the tiger’s den was to investigate this matter.

“Senior, I guess that the matter here likely has something to do with how you almost died back then, right?” Ye Yuan said to Mi Tian.

Mi Tian was silent for a long time and said with a sigh, “I don’t know either, but … it’s probably related! It looks like the blood race had already started making plans at that time!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “To the blood race, you all, these chaos true spirits, are the real treasures! Whether or not the Chaos Bloodstone can open the Door of Eternal Life and reach the Great Beyond, perhaps the key lies with you all! However, you all are too strong. He can only do it in secret! This scheme has lasted for several hundred thousand years. What extravagant preparations!”

Chaos true spirits could be said to be the peak of bloodlines!

Their bloodline was bestowed by Heavenly Dao.

Therefore, if the Chaos Bloodstone wanted to reach the Great Beyond, it would naturally be of great reference value to him.

If he was the Chaos Bloodstone, he would not let them off too.

But chaos true spirits were too powerful!

Innate chaos true spirits were existences on the same level as the Chaos Bloodstone!

Regarding these powerhouses that were born from heaven and earth, each of them was powerful to the extreme.

Just like Mi Tian, back then, he was already a top Hegemon that roamed the heavens unobstructed, sweeping across the soul clan with his strength alone!

This kind of existence, even if it was the Chaos Bloodstone, the Chaos Bloodstone would be very wary too.

Let alone that Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven’s powerhouses were not just Mi Tian alone.

Mi Tian fell silent again. Ye Yuan could feel the struggle in his heart currently and stopped speaking.

Actually, Ye Yuan already faintly had some guesses. It was just that Mi Tian did not say anything. So he could not ask too much as well.

“Huhu,?he’s currently like a wild beast without his own will at all. Most likely, you all can’t control him at all. That’s why you’d lock him in the cage, right? If you let him out, the first one that he’ll kill will probably be you!” Ye Yuan looked at the Divine Dragon Envoy and said with a cold smile.

The Divine Dragon Envoy was indifferent and said with a smile, “So what? We’ve already found a way to control him. He’ll be very obedient! The few of you are all very talented. Perhaps in the future, you all will be able to step into the legendary chaos grade bloodline!”

The eyes that the Divine Dragon Envoy looked at the few people with made everyone shudder without feeling cold.

Nobody wanted to become like Zhao Yue!

Possessing the strength of Hegemon Realm but becoming a wild beast that was at other people’s beck and call, what was the point?

Ye Yuan looked at the Divine Dragon Envoy, not concealing his killing intent in the least bit.

Divine Dragon Envoy smiled and said, “Ye Yuan, I feel very optimistic about you! Judging from our past experiments, the human race’s physical body has the highest compatibility! Very soon, you won’t be using this sort of eyes to look at me. You’ll be thanking this seat!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Soon, you’ll be thanking me too!”

Divine Dragon Envoy laughed loudly and said, “Kid, you’ve got personality. I like it! I hope that in the future, you’ll become stronger than him! Take them away!”

The group was taken away again.

When Ye Yuan walked past Zhao Yue’s water prison and saw that miserable appearance, the killing intent in his chest sprang up again.

Suddenly, his gaze and Zhao Yue’s gaze met, and he could not help trembling all over.

He saw a trace of anguish from that ferocious to the extreme gaze.

A trace of seeking deliverance from the pain.

This Zhao Yue actually still had a last strand of self-consciousness remaining?
