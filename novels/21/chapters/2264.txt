Chapter 2268: One Person Suppressing the Divine Race!

“Y-Your Excellency! W-Why are you here?”

When Ning Tianping opened his eyes and saw Ye Yuan, he was incomparably surprised. He was about to struggle and get up, but Ye Yuan hurriedly held him down and said sternly, “Lie down properly! Don’t move!”

Ning Tianping just woke up. The injuries on his body were still far from well.

This time, Ning Tianping was severely injured and was only hanging in there with one breath. It was naturally impossible to get well quickly.

When he saw Rong Xiyue, Ning Tianping realized what happened very soon.

Ning Tianping’s expression dimmed and he gritted his teeth and said, “Your Excellency, I ... I’ve caused trouble for you!”

He came to take revenge for his master this time. Who knew that he burrowed into the Deathsoul Gate’s sphere of influence all of a sudden.

Mo Lifei also got killed in order to protect him.

After he was captured by Rong Xiyue, he was grilled endlessly. They wanted to dig out more information about Ye Yuan.

But he did not say a single word.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s good that you’re fine. Now, let’s avenge grievances if there are any, and take revenge if there are grudges!”

Suddenly, Ning Tianping discovered Rong Xiyue by the side. This shock was by no means trivial.

“Your Excellency, she ... she ...”

“She’s of the divine race. This place is the divine race’s Hidden Lineage’s small world. Uh, you don’t need to worry, they are very busy right now,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

While talking, the front door of the medicinal hut was pushed open. Ru Feng walked in with a grim expression.

Clearly, he had bustled around for the greater part of a day and finally controlled the spread of the poison.

He expended a Herculean effort and completely froze the entire Hidden Lineage’s heaven and earth spiritual energy. That was how he controlled and curbed the poison’s infectiousness ability.

Apart from this, he had no other way.

It was just that like this could only treat the symptoms and not the root.

In the end, he could only beg Ye Yuan.

Only after this struggle, did Ru Feng realize how terrifying this poison was.

In just a short while, the speed of the poison’s spread far exceeded his expectations.

Even though the divine race was few in population, the Hidden Lineage had gone through countless years of accumulation. There were still a considerable number of divine race powerhouses residing in this small world.

His reaction was already very fast, but there were still thousands of clan members who died.

Powerhouses whose strength reached Seven-marks Heavenly Dao Realm could barely manage to hang in there and not die. But they could not hold on for too long either.

As for Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses, even though the poison could not kill them, they would probably have to spend the remainder of their lives with this poison.

The vast majority of their energy would have to be put on suppressing the toxicity.

This poison was too fierce!

“Boy, hand over the antidote!” Ru Feng said with a grim expression.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Is this your attitude of pleading with people? If I were to give you the antidote, wouldn’t it make me seem very lowly?”

Ru Feng discovered that this boy was like a hedgehog, unable to chomp down at all.

The Hidden Lineage had lived in seclusion here for countless years and had always been calm and tranquil.

But this punk came for less than a day and turned the entire Hidden Lineage upside down.

The crux was that he could not even do anything to this guy!

How aggravating!

Although killing Ye Yuan was easy, once this toxicity spread, the entire small world would probably become a death zone.

At that time, there could only be them, these high-level Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realms, remaining.

Ru Feng gritted his teeth, his tone finally turning gentle as he said, “Young Friend Ye, this little friend’s matter, we’re very sorry! After this matter passes, I’ll definitely think of ways to compensate you. Please hand the antidote to me!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When he said this, he wished to give himself two tight slaps.

Who was he?

One of the Hidden Lineage’s nine elders!

How revered was his status? He was actually being so soft-spoken and submissive towards a human.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Tone is still a little curt, but it can already sink in. However ... you’re not qualified enough yet!”

Ru Feng’s face changed and he said in a chilly voice, “Boy, don’t you reach for a yard after taking an inch!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Have Head Elder come, he’s barely qualified enough!”

Ru Feng’s expression changed wildly and he said in alarm and anger, “How exalted is Head Elder’s status? It’s impossible for him to come and apologize to you!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said indifferently, “Then you can kill me right now. With these tens of millions of divine race members being buried with me, it will be a break-even situation for us brothers. Also, you can rest assured about one thing, you definitely won’t find the antidote on my body.”

Several tens of millions of divine race members sounded like a lot, but when compared to the human race and demon race, it was a single hair strand from nine oxen.

Ru Feng wished to pounce forward and choke this guy to death!

How much effort did their Hidden Lineage expend before accumulating this bit of assets?

Ye Yuan killed all of them with poison in one go!

Of course, there was still one way, which was total migration.

But right now, at this juncture, the human race’s major powers were already waiting for a chance to cause trouble. Such a large-scale migration, there was no way to avoid their eyes and ears at all.

At that time, it was still the outcome of death.

Before this, Ru Feng completely would not have thought that the exalted divine race would actually have to lower their heads to a human.

Humans should prostrate at their feet.

Ru Feng’s face flickered indeterminately. Suddenly, he gave a cold snort, turned around, and left.

By the side, Rong Xiyue and Ning Tianping were long already dumbstruck with amazement.

Such a supreme powerhouse did not even dare to let out a fart in front of Ye Yuan.

Too terrifying!

Ning Tianping thought that he was dead for sure this time. Who knew that the moment His Excellency came, he directly suppressed their entire divine race until they lowered their heads!

Barring no accidents, Head Elder still had to come personally.

Otherwise, if these tens of millions of divine race members died out, they all, these heavenly emperors, would become lone generals without an army.

But just as Ru Feng went to find Head Elder, Uncle Song detained Li Zhaoqing over.

When Ning Tianping saw Li Zhaoqing, his two eyes spewed fire.

Li Zhaoqing’s complexion was ashen. When he saw Rong Xiyue, it was like he saw a straw to clutch at, directly hugging her leg and sobbing bitterly, “Holy Daughter, s-save me! This lowly one has served the Deathsoul Gate for several hundred thousand years and made meritorious service in work! You ... You can’t leave me in the lurch!”

Li Zhaoqing completely did not know about whatever divine race. Rong Xiyue’s identity on the surface was the Deathsoul Gate’s Holy Daughter.

Rong Xiyue smiled bitterly and said, “It’s not that I’m not saving you, but I can’t even fend for myself right now! You ... hope for the best.”

After talking, she turned toward Ye Yuan.

A cold light flashed, Ye Yuan sliced off a corner of the table. The sword moved like the wind, forming the appearance of a memorial tablet very soon.

It was only to see his fingers move slightly and actually inscribed words onto the memorial tablet out of thin air.

Finished carving, he placed the memorial tablet on the table and said to Li Zhaoqing, “Kneel down!”

Li Zhaoqing’s face changed and looked towards the memorial tablet, only to see ‘Deceased Master, Mo Lifei’s memorial tablet’ on it!

Li Zhaoqing’s entire person felt dizzy. He did not understand. It was just dealing with a brat who just entered the Empyrean Realm. Why was he captured without rhyme or reason?

Could it be that the powerful Deathsoul Gate was actually scared of an Empyrean Realm brat?

Just the Deathsoul Gate’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were as many as more than a dozen!

Thud!

Li Zhaoqing did not have the least bit of hesitation, directly kneeling down.

“Kowtow and offer an apology!” Ye Yuan said coldly, his words carrying a prestige that allowed no doubt.

“Y-Your Excellency spare my life! I’ll kowtow! I’ll kowtow! Brother Mo, I was acting under orders. It really had nothing to do with me!”

As he said, Li Zhaoqing kowtowed frantically toward the memorial tablet without ceasing.

Ning Tianping felt touched in his heart. If not for His Excellency, it would have been impossible for him to take revenge in this lifetime, right?
