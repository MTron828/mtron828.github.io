Chapter 1491 Grudge Is Sowed Big Time

The types of spirit medicines for the Second Transformation Profound Gold Pill were seldom-seen, but the Fiend Medicine Hall’s strength was really not for show.

Meng Qi told Ye Yuan that within half a month, he would help him gather all of the spirit medicines.

Meng Qi’s thoughts, Ye Yuan naturally took it into his sights. He also promised Meng Qi that half a month later, he would come again and preach the Dao to them.

Done with these, Ye Yuan went out of the door alone.

Although Li Ji was reluctant to stay behind, she was helpless to do anything too.

Ye Yuan going to the Hundred Knows Hall to inquire about information, she had nowhere to go and could only stay in the Fiend Medicine Hall.

Li Ji was no longer a little girl in Meng Qi’s eyes now.

What did she say? That Source Night was her man?

This relationship, how could he not make good use of it?

What was the most powerful?

Not a man’s fist, but a woman’s pillow talk!

As for the matter of that batch of medicinal pills, it was even more of a cinch.

Meng Qi made the decision and directly half-sold half-gifted them to the Fan Family, absolutely being a friendship price.

Happiness came too suddenly, Fan Yu was somewhat at a loss on what to do.

The Fiend Medicine Hall’s medicinal pills were in very short supply. Even the City Lord Manor had to pay a huge price to get it too.

Another batch of medicinal pills to a family’s strength was rather significant.

To Ye Yuan, Fan Yu was grateful from the bottom of his heart. He wished to send Li Ji onto Ye Yuan’s bed right away.

Coming out of the Fiend Medicine Hall, Ye Yuan’s alarm bells went off!

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh ... Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The sounds of tearing through the air came over. Several streaks of cold light flew over towards Ye Yuan at a terrifying speed.

It was concealed weapons!

“Explode for me!”

Huo En formed a seal. Those flying knives directly exploded in the air, turning into countless fragments, virtually sealing off all of Ye Yuan’s escape routes!

Being struck by these shards, Ye Yuan’s body would probably turn into a sieve!

A hint of a cruel smile flashed across the corners of Huo En’s mouth. He knew that this mission was already completed.

His half-step Fiend Commander strength, scheming against the unwary, Ye Yuan absolutely could not possibly escape this assassination!

All of this was just something that happened in the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint.

No matter how strong Ye Yuan was, it was also not possible to react.

Huo En did not go and look at Ye Yuan. He was already ready to get up and leave.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s body suddenly disappeared from where he was!

“Phantom Kill!”

Huo En’s expression changed drastically. A sense of danger instantly welled up in his heart.

Ye Yuan’s figure actually turned into a blurry shadow and rushed over towards him!

Too fast!

With his strength, he could only barely manage to capture Ye Yuan’s traces too.

“Bloodfeather Sword Art!”

Huo En shouted fiercely, his sword art stabbing over towards that vague shadow like lightning.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

In an instant, the two people exchanged blows no idea how many times.

The powerful undulations shocked the surroundings into a pile of ruins.

After several breaths, Ye Yuan appeared a thousand feet away, his complexion pale and breathing unstable. Clearly, it was a sign of overly exhausting his divine essence.

However, Huo End was not much better either. He gasped heavily for air. That bout of exchange just now rapidly consumed his fiend essence in an instant.

From when he took action to sneak attack Ye Yuan until now, only around ten breaths of time had passed.

Everything happened too quickly!

Huo En did not expect that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually powerful to such a degree.

If not for him being an assassin, his reactions extremely quick, Ye Yuan’s sneak attack earlier would have been able to counter-kill him!

This kid was too dangerous!

At this moment, Huo En finally knew how scalding these 30 million low-grade fiend essence stones were.

Take his life while he was ill!

Huo En was a competent assassin. He already perceived that that move just now was extremely taxing on Ye Yuan. Now, he already did not have much strength to retaliate.

Ye Yuan’s speed was fast, Huo En’s speed was likewise not slow.

As an assassin, speed was a mandatory requirement.

“Bloodfeather Sword Art!”

Blood-light suffused all over Huo En’s body, his figure rushing towards Ye Yuan once more like lightning.

However, he already had no more chances.

“Stop!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Five figures made a move at the same time, blocking Huo En’s path.

This place was right outside the Fiend Medicine Hall’s front door. Such a large commotion, how could it not startle them?

Huo En’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “I’m a member of the Assassination Hall, somebody offered a reward for this kid’s life!”

Although the five elders were Fiend Apothecaries, their combat strengths were similarly not weak.

Fighting five-versus-one, they naturally would not fall into a disadvantage.

The reason why Huo En dared to take action here was that this place was their own territory.

Even if he killed people, nobody dared to say anything either.

Although the Blood Yama Hall’s various branch halls were under different commands, they were one family after all.

Huo En never expected that it was precisely his own people who blocked his fatal blow.

He had kept guard outside the whole time and completely did not know the events that happened inside the Fiend Medicine Hall. He even thought that by reporting his background, the five elders would make way.

Meng Qi snorted coldly and said, “This old man hasn’t reached the point where my eyes can’t see clearly! How can I not know that you’re a member of the Assassination Hall? Humph! You actually dared to make a move against our Fiend Medicine Hall’s esteemed guest, this score, we’ll find the Assassination Hall to settle it later!”

Huo En was stunned, doubting whether he heard wrongly or not.

Why did the Fiend Medicine Hall’s five elders help an outsider?

For the sake of a boy who had nothing to do with them, they were actually going to go to war with the Assassination Hall?

Esteemed guest?

A kid whose hair was not fully grown, how did he become the Fiend Medicine Hall’s esteemed guest?

“Meng Qi, what’s the meaning of this? For the sake of an outsider, you’re actually going to make things difficult for my Assassination Hall?” Huo En said in a solemn voice.

Meng Qi was greatly enraged as he said, “Master Source Night is our Fiend Medicine Hall’s most noble guest! I’m warning you, if you dare to touch a hair of his, we aren’t finished!”

Seeing Meng Qi fly off the handle like so, Huo En finally realized that he was not joking.

Master Source Night?

This kid, could it be that he was even an alchemy expert?

You have got to be kidding!

Meng Qi was, at any rate, a leading authority-class figure among Two-star fiend apothecaries too, to actually call a kid who was still wet behind his ears master?

Huo En felt that maybe the five elders have gone crazy?

He gave a cold snort and said, “Humph! Meng Qi, don’t you forget, you’re not the Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master! This matter, somebody will naturally come and find you!”

Meng Qi was hot-tempered too and immediately said furiously, “Heh heh, good! Very good! Your Assassination Hall is very tough now huh? Today’s word, this old man has remembered it! Get lost!”

Huo En gave a cold snort, and then his figure moved swiftly, vanishing from everyone’s line of sight.

Meng Qi turned to Ye Yuan, cupped his fists, and said with an apologetic look, “The Assassination Hall’s people are becoming more and more insolent! Meng Qi failed in his hospitality and let Master Source Night fall into a dangerous situation. Meng g Qi’s truly ashamed.”

At this time, Meng Qi was actually incredibly shocked in his heart.

One had to know, that assassin was half-step Fiend Commander realm. Ye Yuan, a middle-level Fiend General, could actually retreat unscathed, it was truly surprising.

At this moment, he was incomparably certain, there was definitely a powerful existence behind Ye Yuan.

This young man was not simple! He must not be offended!

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Nothing to do with you guys. Somebody else wants my life. Heh, with this, the grudge is sowed big time!”

Use one’s butt to think and one would also know, this incident was definitely Ka Xin causing trouble behind the scenes.

Failing to kill him at the gathering, this time, he actually hired an assassin to deal with him.

Did he really think that Ye Yuan was easy to knead?
