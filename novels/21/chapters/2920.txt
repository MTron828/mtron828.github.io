Chapter 2919: Entering the Forest

Awkward!

Huge awkwardness!

How resounding was that one word ‘retreat’?

However, Ye Yuan did not even take half a step.

Apart from awkwardness at the entrance of the Lucid Forest, it was still awkwardness.

Originally they thought that Ye Yuan, who was too weak to stand up to a gust of wind, would have to suffer serious injuries under this corrupt energy even if his soul did not dissipate.

Who knew that he did not feel anything out of sorts at all.

“No way, right? That kid is clearly just middle True Sovereign Heaven, and he can actually resist Qin Shitian’s corrupt energy?”

“I heard that Qin Shitian’s corrupt energy can even suppress the blood race’s blood energy. It actually can’t suppress that kid!”

“It’s really embarrassing now. You look at Qin Shitian’s face. It turned green!”

… …

Qin Shitian’s awe-inspiring reputation was illustrious in the entire Scarlet Drill Battlefield and even Ning Lan Territory.

But who could have thought that he actually suffered a loss in front of an unknown punk?!

Zhou Yu was clearly a little more shrewd than the other two. He looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Interesting! Really interesting! I didn’t expect that in the temple entrance assessment this time, I’d actually bump into an interesting little fellow. What’s your name?”

Ye Yuan shook his head slightly with a faint smile but turned around and left.

The trio who remained had dumbfounded faces.

This guy actually ignored them!

There was actually someone who dared to ignore the Scarlet Drill Three Sons here!

This time, even Zhou Yu lost composure.

“Punk, I’m talking to you. Are you deaf?” Zhou Yu said in a cold voice.

“Want to posture, do it after passing the test. You haven’t even entered the Lucid Forest, and you’re flaunting your prowess here, making a spectacle of yourselves,” Ye Yuan said coolly without even turning his head back.

“Hiss …”

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

Domineering enough!

Far away, when Yan Jadetrue saw this scene, he could not help smiling broadly.

Sure enough, it was very Ye Yuan-like!

Although these three people were very strong, compared to Ye Yuan, they were still far off!

The corrupt energy on the Scarlet Drill Three Sons’ bodies was extremely heavy. Their soul body was extremely solid. They were indeed not easy to deal with.

But the path that Ye Yuan took was drastically different from theirs.

The Scarlet Drill Three Sons experienced the battlefield for a long time, tempering their soul bodies like how humans train their physical bodies.

But the path that Ye Yuan took was a Great Dao that led to heaven!

Fighting with Ye Yuan, he felt that Ye Yuan’s origin divinity was akin to a vast expanse of fog, seemingly unreachable.

Although the corrupt energy was heavy, it was not worth mentioning in front of Ye Yuan.

Unless this corrupt energy reached the Emperor Realm, it had no way of affecting Ye Yuan at all.

“Huhu,?looks like someone is going to challenge us this time! Interesting! Very interesting!” Qin Shitian laughed coldly without ceasing, but his eyes were already somber to the extreme.

These three people were all ruthless and cruel, having killed countless people.

The humans and blood kins that died in their hands were beyond count.

Originally they thought that this time, it would be a competition between the three of them. Who knew that there was actually someone who dared to provoke them.

But Zhou Yu smiled and said, “Isn’t that great? Originally I thought that it would be boring this time. Wrecking a brat who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth while we’re at it is pretty good too. It’s just I don’t know whether or not he can get out of the Lucid Forest!”

People familiar with him all knew that Zhou Yu already had killing intent aroused.

Right at this time, a figure appeared in the sky above the Lucid Forest.

Emperor Realm powerhouse!

“Alright, everyone is already here. Enter the Lucid Forest! With three days as the time limit, after three days, those who can’t come out will naturally be transported out. However, if you can’t even last three days, then you can’t blame anyone. Now, you all can still choose to withdraw,” the Emperor Realm powerhouse said loudly.

Nobody moved. Those who came here naturally already knew the danger of the Lucid Forest.

The Emperor Realm powerhouse smiled slightly and said, “Since nobody backed out, enter the forest!”

Under his word of command, thousands of soul race geniuses entered the Lucid Forest in succession.

There was a light screen before the forest. The light dots on the light screen represented everyone’s positions.

Whoever’s light dot disappeared, it represented that their will had already been wiped away, turning into a part of the Lucid Forest.

Each time they entered the forest, there would be hundreds of people who fell in the end.

Not long after everyone entered the Lucid Forest, several figures landed.

That Emperor Realm powerhouse’s pupils constricted slightly, and he hurriedly bowed and said, “Paying respects to three hall masters! Paying respects to elders!”

“Mn,?you carry on hosting the Lucid Forest, don’t need to care about us!”

“Yes!”

It turned out that it was actually the hall master and two vice hall masters arriving in person!

A slight chill ran down the backs of the forest guardian, looks like the three hall masters value these three honorary disciples very highly!

Hall Master Great Emperor Eastsun, Vice Hall Master Great Emperor Westdawn, Great Emperor Woodrelease, these three people were all Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm mighty experts.

To be able to receive attention from the three of them, the weight of the Scarlet Drill Three Sons could be seen.

Apart from them, Yan Jadetrue’s master, Soul Emperor Sevenfeather, also arrived.

“Master!” Yan Jadetrue said with a bow.

When Sevenfeather saw Yan Jadetrue, he was also slightly surprised and said, “You’re here too?”

Yan Jadetrue said, “Yes, this disciple made a good friend when I went out this time. He wants to enter the Nirvana Soul Hall too. So I arranged for him to join the temple entrance assessment.”

Sevenfeather nodded slightly. This kind of thing was very common and not a big deal.

But Yan Jadetrue was incredibly disappointed in his heart.

He placed hopes on that his master could see through what was wrong in his soul body.

But sadly, nope!

It seemed like Ye Yuan’s method was extremely brilliant. Even an Emperor Vast Heaven Realm mighty expert was completely clueless.

“Who’s your good friend?” Sevenfeather asked.

“This … That last one is called Ye Yuan.” There was everyone’s name on the light screen.

Sevenfeather could not help laughing as he said, “The periphery’s baneful souls are the fewest. He’s still wandering around the perimeter until now. Most likely … it will be very hard to survive three days, right?”

Yan Jadetrue could not help smiling bitterly. He was perplexed too.

With Ye Yuan’s Dao heart, he should advance very quickly. But, he actually stopped right at the beginning.

This showed that he was already beguiled!

Concerning the Lucid Forest, the deeper in, the more wandering souls and the stronger they were. The beguiling power also grew stronger.

“Huhu,?Martial Uncle Sevenfeather, this kid was still picking a fight with the Scarlet Drill Three Sons earlier, I was wondering how strong he was. Who knew that this kid can’t even break through the outer-perimeter. What a piece of trash!?Huhu,?Junior Apprentice Brother Jadetrue’s strength is decent, but his eyesight in making friends is too lousy. That Scarlet Drill Three Sons are indeed well-deserving of being the three hall masters’ honorary disciples. At this rate of advancement, most likely … they will be breaking the record!”

The one speaking was called Jiang Hao. He was also an elder’s disciple. His strength was almost on par with Yan Jadetrue.

Between the two, they contended with each other overtly and covertly as well.

That scene earlier, he was present too and naturally took it into his sights.

Originally he thought that Ye Yuan had some abilities, to be able to block the Scarlet Drill Three Sons’ corrupt energy. Who knew that he was so useless.

Seeing Yan Jadetrue get deflated at this time, he naturally could not resist coming out to deal two kicks in.

When he said this, Sevenfeather’s face was also rather awkward. His expression turned dark, looking at Yan Jadetrue with a dark expression.

What kind of rubbish friend did you make?

Putting aside that his strength was weak, he even offended the hall master’s honorary disciple. Wasn’t this secretly reporting himself?

He, an exalted Emperor Vast Heaven, could not afford to lose this face!

Looking at the Scarlet Drill Three Sons again, they were virtually advancing at an equal pace and already rushed three miles into the forest! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The Lucid Forest was not big. It was only ten square miles.

But the deeper in, the slower one would get.
