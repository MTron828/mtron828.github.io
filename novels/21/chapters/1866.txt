Chapter 1870: Standing Firm

“Tsk tsk, Xu Xing is forcing Ye Yuan to the death here!”

“Can this guy clear the sixth round?”

“Since he dared to do so, he likely has some confidence! Fusing three kinds of law powers, plus the White Tiger bloodline, his strength is already unimaginable.”

...

Xu Xing’s crazy action caused a huge uproar.

Ever since Fan Ming, no Celestial Deity Realm martial artists dared to challenge the fourth round at all.

Only by clearing the third and sixth round would a transmission array appear.

If one could not clear it, then there was only the outcome of waiting for death.

Quite a few people cast amused looks toward Ye Yuan. If Xu Xing really made it through the sixth round, then it would be fun for them to see Ye Yuan going through the challenges.

Reckon that he would really wet his pants.

Xu Xing did not disappoint everyone. Although it was rather strained, he still successfully cleared the fourth round.

In the fifth round, the White Tiger bloodline power in Xu Xing’s body suddenly erupted, making it through.

Everyone was stunned, including those True God powerhouses. Each and every one of them became somewhat ashamed of their inadequacy.

A Celestial Deity Realm martial artist actually made it to the sixth round!

While they, these True God powerhouses, actually did not even dare to challenge the round.

The so-called proud son of heaven was roughly like this.

In the level six sword formation, the power was tremendous. Xu Xing who was amidst sword lights was far from as composed as before, with the injuries on his body also increasing.

Xu Xing’s sword intent crisscrossed, three kinds of law powers utilized to the limit. The White Tiger bloodline power was similarly urged to the limit.

Even so, Xu Xing was also perilously close to death, brushing past the death god many times.

Everyone’s hearts leaped to their throats, not knowing if he could clear this round or not.

Suddenly, the sword formation abruptly stopped. The transmission array appeared.

Xu Xing succeeded in clearing this round!

All of the powerhouses drew a cold breath. The peak Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity Xu Xing actually cleared the sixth round! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This was absolutely an incomparably proud battle achievement!

The current Xu Xing was riddled with injuries. But his image became incomparably tall and big in everyone’s eyes.

This was a young man whose prospects were boundless!

Dragging his all scratched up body, Xu Xing moved over toward the transmission array.

Before entering the transmission array, Xu Xing even turned around and looked in Ye Yuan’s direction, giving a profound look.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Everyone’s gazes looked toward Ye Yuan in unison.

This trumpet was blown too loudly!

According to Ye Yuan’s statement, he must now complete the level nine sword formation before he could continue exploring the mystic realm.

But the level nine sword formation, was this possible?

Lord Ji Kang was a Ninth Firmament True God powerhouse. He did not dare to challenge the level seven sword formation too.

The power of the ninth level, no one dared to try at all.

That was a taboo existence!

“Young Master Ye, it’s your turn now! Just now, you made the boast. Now, are you going up or tucking your tail between your legs and getting lost?” The one who spoke was Nine Fire Imperial Capital’s genius disciple called Qi Heng.

Ye Yuan had an impression of this person. This person had been constantly sucking up to Xu Xing.

But saying this to him at this time, no one felt that there was anything inappropriate.

After all, in everyone’s eyes, Ye Yuan was the braggart who blew his own trumpet too loudly.

No one thought that he would enter the sword formation, because Ye Yuan definitely would not treat his life as a joke.

“Where did this dog come from, anyhow barking here?” Ye Yuan did not even look at Qi Heng as he said.

Qi Heng’s expression changed and he said angrily, “Want to say dog, you’re the dog, right?! Aren’t you wretched like a stray cur right now?”

Ye Yuan laughed the moment he heard and said, “Your master merely cleared the sixth level sword formation, look how you’re showing off. Since you want to lick his smelly boots so much, why don’t you dare to go challenge the sword formation yourself?”

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan with mocking looks. Already at this point, his mouth was still unrelenting.

Merely cleared the sixth level sword formation?

Right now, the ones who cleared the sixth level sword formation, one was the Ninth Firmament True God Ji Kang, the other was the Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity Xu Xing.

Holding in contempt, it was also not your turn to look down on!

Qi Heng sneered and said, “Razor-tongued! Since you don’t dare to go challenge the sword formation, why haven’t you quickly scrammed yet? Making a spectacle of yourself here, your face is really thick!”

“Yeah, really shameless! No matter what, Xu Xing already cleared the sixth level sword formation, what about you?”

“Hurry up and get lost, don’t be an eyesore here! You’ll only make people look down on you more like this.”

The moment Qi Heng spoke, quite a number of people concurred.

No one thought that Ye Yuan dared to enter the sword formation, which was no different from courting death.

“When did I say that I’m not entering the sword formation?” Ye Yuan said with a guileless look.

Everyone was taken aback for a while and did not come back to their senses yet. It was only to see Ye Yuan pat Qi Heng’s shoulder and say nonchalantly, “Open your eyes wide and take a look at how weak your master is!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan leaped and landed right in the sword formation.

This scene reversed too quickly, everyone did not react to it and Ye Yuan already went in.

After Xu Xing successfully cleared the rounds, everyone’s preconceived notion was that Ye Yuan did not dare to enter the sword formation anymore.

But Ye Yuan went in, catching them by surprise.

Leng Qiuling also did not react to it. It was already too late to want to stop it and she could not help having a worried look.

When Qi Heng saw the situation, he said with a cold smile, “Heh, this guy couldn’t stand being provoked and indeed went in to seek his doom!”

Upon entering the sword formation, countless sword light came from all directions.

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and completely did not have any intention of defending.

Everyone was dumbfounded, entered the sword formation already and this guy actually still wanted to act cool!

However, they did not have time to mock yet when their expressions immediately turned stiff.

Those dense sword lights, not one actually landed on Ye Yuan’s body.

Too relaxed!

Too effortless!

Just like this, Ye Yuan passed the first level sword formation without even moving a finger.

“This ... This is also too fake, right?” Qi Heng said with a look of astonishment.

“Spatial law is a supreme law. It’s not at all surprising for him to be able to do it to this step. But the power of the sword formation at the back gets stronger and stronger. Wanting to use this kind of opportunistic method to pass the round is impossible! I reckon that next round, he’ll have to take action,” Ji Xun said with a sullen look.

When everyone heard that, they all came to a realization.

But right at this time, the second level sword formation also started activating!

Ye Yuan stood firm!

Those sword lights still could not touch the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves!

Ji Xun’s face immediately turned stiff there.

His face was slapped resoundingly!

“Third round, he’ll definitely make a move in the third round!” Ji Xun gritted his teeth and said.

The second round did not have any suspense, Ye Yuan cleared it easily.

Third round, Ye Yuan still did not move!

“Hahaha!”

Everyone looked at Ji Xun with peculiar faces, laughing wildly without ceasing.

Ji Xun’s face practically turned black like the bottom of a wok.

He could not understand why Ye Yuan could be as steady as Mount Tai in the midst of such berserk sword lights!

While the rest were laughing, the shock in their hearts was not any bit less.

Were the first three rounds strong or not?

So many dead people were lying there!

Quite a number among them were even high-level Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses.

But Ye Yuan, he was just a Third Firmament Celestial Deity.

Even if he comprehended spatial law, on what basis did he not even have to move a finger?

These first three rounds were cleared too trivially, right?
