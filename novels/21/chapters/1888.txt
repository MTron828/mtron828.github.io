Chapter 1892: Sequence of Events

An Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity, to the people of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, it was virtually an invincible existence.

But such an undefeatable existence was killed by someone under their eyelids.

The opponent was just a Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity.

To Ye Yuan, they were all too familiar.

People’s impression of him mostly still stopped at that arrogant but peerlessly talented youth.

No one could have expected that several hundred years’ time, he already grew to such a level.

Over there, Leng Qiuling and Wu Tian’s battle also drew to an end already.

With a flash, Leng Qiuling pointed a finger, directly landing on Wu Tian’s chest.

Wu Tian was akin to being struck by a heavy blow, blood spurting wildly from his mouth. His figure was flying out backward.

Ye Yuan’s figure floated down. Looking at Wu Tian, he said, “If something happens to Jiang Jadehall, you’ll know that the most despairing thing in this world isn’t death.”

He gestured Ning Tianping with a look. Ning Tianping understood it and went up to seal Wu Tian’s divine sea, and immediately brought him away.

When Zuo Shujie and the rest saw this scene, they felt like they were dreaming.

Today, the patrolling inspector arrived. In the end, he had not even entered the front door and was annihilated by Ye Yuan.

Seeing Ye Yuan walk over, Coldfeather and the rest actually did not have a single person dare step forward to greet.

The present Ye Yuan was no longer that junior back then!

Ye Yuan naturally knew what they were thinking in their hearts and said smilingly, “City Lord Zuo, Brother Coldfeather, you guys don’t have to be like this. This Ye Yuan is still that Ye Yuan, still Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s head elder.”

Hearing this, Coldfeather and the rest felt slightly relieved but naturally did not dare to treat Ye Yuan like in the past anymore.

The group of people entered the city and went into the City Lord Manor. They naturally could not dispense with a bout of small talk.

Ye Yuan also knew that these few years, Jiang Jadehall really did look after Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

As for the matters with people at the top, they were not aware.

But Ye Yuan guessed that the reason why Jiang Jadehall fell out with Wu Tian was likely related to the promise with him back then.

Because if he left the position of patrolling inspector, he would not be able to control Heavenly Eagle Imperial City anymore.

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan was very grateful toward Jiang Jadehall in his heart.

“Looks like I have to make a trip to Nine Pledge Imperial Capital. Everyone doesn’t need to worry. The matter of the patrolling inspector, I’ll be thinking of a way to resolve it. In addition, I have some medicinal pills here. It should be helpful to the few of you.”

Ye Yuan took out several bottles of medicinal pills. The pupils of Zuo Shujie and the rest all shrunk.

Back then, Ye Yuan astounded the Southridge with alchemy. Now that several hundred years passed, his realm also stepped into Celestial Deity Realm, so then how terrifying would the medicinal pills he refined be?

Sure enough, the medicinal pills that Ye Yuan took out, the quality was all extremely high.

Helping them to break through realms was naturally nothing difficult.

“Oh, right, with Wu Tian’s identity, why would he run to Southridge to be the patrolling inspector for a girl?” Ye Yuan suddenly asked curiously.

Zuo Shujie sighed and said, “These few years that you were gone, Cloudjade Imperial City produced a peerless genius called Rong Xiyue. This girl is the daughter of Cloudjade Imperial City’s city lord, Rong Hua. This girl was a Divine Lord since her birth. It was a historical moment for Cloudjade Imperial City. At present, she’s already Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity! Such monstrous talent, she was naturally valued highly by Linghua Pavilion and taken into the pavilion. Several years ago, Rong Hua suffered a heavy injury inside a mystic realm. Rong Xiyue left Linghua Pavilion and returned to Cloudjade Imperial City to take care of her ill father. This Wu Tian came for her.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and said, “This matter ... likely isn’t that simple, right?”

Zuo Shujie smiled bitterly and said, “Southridge Ten Cities is merely a desolate and barren place; unable to have any ties with the imperial capital. This intel is all about events of the Southridge Lands. That’s why we could inquire about it. As for the rest, we’re powerless to do anything. As for Patrolling Inspector Jiang ... Sigh!”

Things concerning Southridge Ten Cities were within the scope of Nine Pledge Imperial Capital. So no one would go and pay attention at all.

If not for having someone like Rong Xiyue, probably barely anyone would know about this place.

Ye Yuan slowly got up and said coolly, “This is simple. Go to Cloudjade Imperial City and ask this Rong Xiyue and we’ll know.”

His voice had yet to fade and Ye Yuan already vanished before everyone’s eyes. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Zuo Shujie and the rest all exchanged glances, this Ye Yuan was also too vigorous and swift in doing things.

Left at the drop of a hat and did not even give a heads-up.

“Heavenly Eagly is hundreds of millions of miles away from Cloudjade, this departure will at least take several month’s time too. Ye Yuan is ...” Zuo Shujie said speechlessly.

But Ning Tianping smiled and said, “His Excellency’s spatial law has already attained sublimity and have long comprehended the art of spatial shift. A single breath and it’s several hundred thousand miles! He’ll be able to return at most by noon.”

“Art of spatial shift! Fourth Firmament Spatial law?” Coldfeather cried out in shock, even his pitch changed.

He also comprehended spatial law and naturally knew how difficult it was to comprehend spatial law to the fourth firmament.

These several hundred years, Ye Yuan’s spatial law attainments were actually already outrageously fearsome!

The others were also extremely shocked, looking at Ning Tianping in disbelief.

If they did not understand Ning Tianping, they would definitely think that Ning Tianping was boasting.

Zuo Shujie sucked in a deep breath and said, “Ye Yuan actually didn’t even use his full strength when he killed that Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity?”

Ning Tianping smiled and said, “That kind of Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity, his law comprehension isn’t even as high as mine. Why would His Excellency need to go all out to kill him?”

Everyone was speechless. But at this time, their attention was placed on Ning Tianping.

The present Ning Tianping refined the Black Tortoise true blood and already broke through to be a Third Firmament Celestial Deity!

Merely a short several hundred year’s time, the Ning Family’s junior already grew to become Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s most formidable existence.

This was simply unthinkable.

Even Ning Zhiyuan also did not know what he should say currently.

When one man attained Dao, his fowls and dogs ascended to heaven too.

Ning Tianping had flourished now and would definitely look after the Ning Family better.

The Heavenly Eagle Imperial City in the future, the Ning Family would be the number one major family, no one would be able to replace anymore.

Only now did he know, a wrong decision made in a moment of weakness really almost ruined the Ning Family!

Fortunately, the Ning Family produced a Ning Tianping who had affection and loyalty, that was how it salvaged the situation.

Otherwise, he would be the entire Ning Family’s sinner now.

...

Although Ye Yuan’s spatial law made progress slowly, exhibiting spatial shift with his current realm, he arrived at Cloudjade Imperial City after two hours.

He did not say hello to anyone, entering the City Lord Manor with a flash.

Buzz!

Ye Yuan did not behave secretively. Instead, he suddenly released the imposing momentum of Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity on him!

With the vigor of his divine sea, his aura was actually not the slightest bit weaker than Sixth Firmament Celestial Deities!

Cloudjade Imperial City’s powerhouses were immediately alarmed.

A Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse appeared in front of Ye Yuan.

Sensing that vast divine essence undulation of Ye Yuan’s, his expression was incomparably ugly.

That Fourth Firmament Cloudjade Imperial City powerhouse said in fear and trepidation, “I’m Cloudjade Imperial City’s Meng Xing, I wonder what this lord came to my Cloudjade Imperial City for?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “I’m looking for Rong Xiyue.”

Meng Xing’s pupils constricted and he said, “Not long ago, Young Patriarch Xiyue already left Cloudjade Imperial City and went back to Nine Pledge Imperial Capital.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he asked again, “Then Rong Hua?”

Meng Xing said respectfully, “City Lord His Excellency left together with Young Patriarch Xiyue.”
