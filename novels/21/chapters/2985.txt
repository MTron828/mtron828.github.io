Chapter 2984: His Growth Was Greater!

Scarletplume’s pupils constricted, immediately feeling the change in Ye Yuan’s body.

But he did not care.

Because from the beginning until now, he had never used his own trump card ultimate move!

“Hur hur,?since that’s the case, then I’ll let you witness my trump card too! Watch closely, Dragon God Bow!”

Behind Scarletplume, a pair of red wings was actually born, his bloodline power instantly rising to the extreme!

This move was his ultimate trump card.

Fighting with Ye Yuan until now, he never used it either.

The moment this move came out, it caused an uproar again.

“It’s Dragon God Bow! Lord Scarletplume is finally using this move!”

“No, wait, this isn’t Dragon God Bow! The power of this move is much stronger than Dragon God Bow!”

“What the hell do you know! Lord Scarletplume comprehended a lot of that boy. He fused his comprehension into Dragon God Bow!”

“So that’s how it is! Lord Scarletplume is really too awesome!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

… …

This move was clearly extremely popular in the Dragon City Tribe.

As soon as Scarletplume used it, the whole place seethed with excitement.

As if Ye Yuan’s defeat was already a foregone conclusion.

It was only to see Scarletplume bend his body and bow in Ye Yuan’s direction.

Boom!

The sky exploded!

A raging to the extreme, but immaterial energy, collapsed toward Ye Yuan through space.

A perfect combination of bloodline and space!

Furthermore, Scarletplume was really a genius. He directly integrated the spatial rule utilization that he learned from Ye Yuan, turning it into his strongest ultimate technique!

The power of this move was explosive!

At the same time, Ye Yuan moved too!

However, compared to Scarletplume’s huge commotion, it seemed a little quiet on his side.

There was naturally a series of contemptuous voices in the Dragon City Tribe.

This was your so-called ultimate move?

It was also too weak, right!

Boom!

Space shattered, and energy exploded!

The shattered space seemingly turned into a giant rolling wave, rushing toward Scarletplume, just like the name Wave Washing Sand!

Space was shattered into grains, drawing a wave above the void. It was too beautiful.

The two ultimate techniques that two great geniuses created themselves collided together without the slightest flashiness.

Boom!

The earth trembled heavily, and mountains swayed.

Those who were slightly weaker could not stand firm at all.

In the next second, everyone was greatly shocked!

It was only to see that above the void, Scarletplume suddenly spurted a mouthful of blood from his mouth wildly, his enormous body unable to stand anymore, falling from the void.

Boom!

The ground directly had a large hole smashed out.

“D-Defeated?”

“This is impossible! How can Lord Scarletplume be defeated?”

“Lord Scarletplume, hurry up, quickly fight back!”

“It’s merely losing one move. It’s no big deal!”

“Lord Scarletplume, hurry up and come out to take care of this punk!”

… …

Dragon City Tribe, everyone was cheering Scarletplume on.

But, inside the large hole, Scarletplume did not respond for a long time.

Everyone’s hearts thumped, having a bad feeling.

Ye Yuan slowly landed and also took a long time before catching his breath.

This fight was really difficult.

However, thanks to Scarletplume, he unleashed all of his potential. Not only broke through his bloodline bottleneck, but he also even created an ultimate spatial technique that belonged to him.

Concerning Mi Tian’s Spatial Eight Styles, all the moves were extremely powerful. But those were part of Mi Tian’s inheritance after all.

What belonged to oneself was the strongest.

Under Scarletplume’s pressure, Ye Yuan finally achieved mastery of the eight styles through a comprehensive study of the subject, comprehending the strongest move, Wave Washing Sand!

It was just that when Ye Yuan made his move, he condensed his strength without dissipating. That was why it seemed weak.

But what Scarletplume, who had a showdown with him, received was a heaven-shocking blow!

Under this blow, he absolutely did not have the strength to fight back anymore.

Scarletplume was extremely talented. His comprehension ability was extremely strong.

But, comparing comprehension ability, he, Ye Yuan, examined his own conscience and felt that he did not lose to anyone!

Walking all the way until today, what he relied on was not a powerful bloodline, heaven-defying inheritance, but his comprehension ability that was powerful until it made people despair!

Alchemy Dao, Formation Dao, spatial rule, the power of origin, without heaven-defying comprehension ability, how could Ye Yuan possibly go step by step from the mortal world to the peak of myriad worlds, even talking with Hegemons?

Scarletplume grew in battles. How was he, Ye Yuan, not the same?

“I … I lost!” From the large pit came Scarletplume’s feeble and reluctant voice.

Since his mountain challenging started, he had yet to taste defeat!

Scarletplume’s character was extremely strong, but such a failure still made him reluctant.

Dragon City Tribe instantly exploded!

The old patriarch’s face had a disbelieving look of shock.

Feng Qingxuan also had a look of shock on her face. Clearly, she did not quite dare to believe this conclusion.

But Scarletplume already lost. Could it still be fake?

Feng Qingxuan came back to her senses and said with a light smile, “The genius that you all take pride in seems to have lost? Old patriarch, in comparison, it seems like the man that I’m curious about is even more extraordinary.”

The old patriarch looked at her and muttered, “But how is this possible? Scarletplume has clearly already grown tremendously during the fight!”

Feng Qingxuan smiled and said, “That’s because Ye Yuan grew more during the fight! Scarletplume is very strong. He’s even stronger than some heaven qian grade bloodline. But it’s also precisely because of this that it thoroughly stimulated Ye Yuan’s potential!”

“This … This …”

The old patriarch still did not dare to believe it, but at his age, he knew that what Feng Qingxuan said was right.

Breaking through bloodline in the midst of battle, comprehending an incredibly powerful move.

What was more monstrous than this?

He originally thought that Ye Yuan was Scarletplume’s stepping stone.

But only now did he know that Scarletplume’s existence was only to serve as a foil to Ye Yuan’s monstrousness!

More growth meant that his talent was greater!

“This … How is this possible? Lord Scarletplume actually admitted defeat?”

“Lord Scarletplume has fought thousands of battles without a single defeat! Today, it’s actually ended?”

“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Lord Scarletplume won’t lose!”

… …

Clearly, Scarletplume had an extremely strong fan base in the Dragon City Tribe.

Even if Scarletplume admitted it himself, they were also not willing to believe that the god of war that they worshipped had actually been defeated.

In their hearts, Scarletplume was invincible!

Invincible, how could he be defeated?

In the large pit, Scarletplume could no longer move.

Ye Yuan appeared next to the pit and looked down at him from a height.

“T-Thank you for sparing my life!” Scarletplume said.

Ye Yuan looked at Scarletplume and said calmly, “You’re very strong. It’s a shame if you die. Keeping you around is useful; you still have important things to do. The Spatial Eight Styles, just take it as a present for you.”

The Chaos Bloodstone was about to come into being. All the heavens would fall into chaos.

With a genius like Scarletplume, it was naturally the more the merrier.

This Scarletplume was a battle fanatic. He did not harbor evil intentions. Therefore, Ye Yuan pulled his punches at the final juncture. That was how Scarletplume was spared.

Otherwise, under Wave Washing Sand, Scarletplume would already be a dead man.

As for Spatial Eight Styles, Ye Yuan did not mind it being learned by Scarletplume.

This set of styles, even if it was given to some people to learn, they would not be able to learn it too.

There were too few who could comprehend spatial rule.

“T-Thank you!” Scarletplume said.

Being defeated by Ye Yuan, he felt very frustrated, but he would not resign himself to his fate.

He was a powerful expert and not some silkpants. Otherwise, he could not have walked until this step today as well.

This kind of defeat would only make him become stronger.

But at this time, he felt a feeling of appreciation toward Ye Yuan.
