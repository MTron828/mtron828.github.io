Chapter 1956: Origin Pill Realm!

Jian Hongxiao had long seen through that Ye Yuan would definitely repay his kindness, but he also did not expect that the moment Ye Yuan made his move, it was such a valuable gift.

And this was merely a bit of interest from what Ye Yuan said!

A vast spirit divine-grade Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill, its value was sufficient to match up to an imperial city!

This was because a vast spirit divine-grade Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill could create a True God Realm powerhouse with near certainty.

Did imperial cities have True God Realms?

The significance of a True God Realm powerhouses, everyone in the entire Heavenspan World knew about it. So how could Jian Hongxiao not know?

This gift of Ye Yuan was too great!

Jian Hongxiao sucked in a deep breath and said with a sigh, “What I gave you was a melon, but what you repaid with was a precious jade! Little Friend Ye, this gift of yours is too heavy! Forget it; since it’s Little Friend Ye’s good intentions, Chen-er, you accept it.”

Jian Chen’s entire body trembled, his face revealing a look of wild elation.

With this divine rank medicinal pill, his breakthrough to the True God Realm was right around the corner!

Jian Hongxiao’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “In a daze for what? Why haven’t you come over to show Little Friend Ye your respect?”

Jian Chen startled awake and hurriedly came in front of Ye Yuan. Kneeling down with a thud, he said, “Jian Chen thanks Brother Ye, this kindness will never be forgotten!”

Ye Yuan hurriedly helped Jian Chen up and said smilingly, “Brother Jian Chen is regarding me too much as a stranger. Just a medicinal pill, it’s nothing. Presumably, Brother Jian Chen is already too impatient to wait and wants to go in closed-seclusion, hurry on then.”

Jian Chen had a look of embarrassment and shame. He was still mocking Ye Yuan in all manners just now. In the end, with a turn of a head, Ye Yuan gave such a big gift.

He glanced at Jian Hongxiao rather timidly, Jian Hongxiao pulled a long face and said huffily, “Go on!”

Jian Chen was akin to being granted amnesty, hurriedly taking his leave.

The two people sat down before Jian Hongxiao slowly opened his mouth and said, “My Jian Family’s members can be said to walk on the edge of a knife when divining the Heavenly Dao. Backlash naturally can’t be avoided as well. The ancestor’s ability connects to the heavens and penetrates the earth; it is not what the likes of us can imagine. He had once found the Medicine Ancestor and created my Jian Family’s unique medicinal pills together with the Medicine Ancestor, which can stand up to the agony of backlash. The Six Veins Stellar Pill is one of them.”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he suddenly came to a realization.

To members of the Jian Family, suffering Heavenly Dao’s backlash was like eating common fare. What was different was just the degree of backlash.

Treating the pain of backlash with medicinal pills, this was clearly a pretty good choice.

But, hearing Jian Hongxiao’s words, Ye Yuan was also curious in his heart.

What kind of figure was Medicine Ancestor?

He already had half a foot stepped into Ancestor Realm, and he was a distinguished talent among Transcendent Heavenly Emperors.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets could actually entice him to take action and develop such a series of medicinal pills for the Jian Family.

This face was not an ordinary kind of big!

But that level of character was still too far away from the current Ye Yuan.

“Since there’s the Six Veins Stellar Pill, then why was Senior banished to this Extreme Light Imperial City?” Ye Yuan could not help asking curiously.

Jian Hongxiao let out a sigh and said, “Little Friend Ye doesn’t know this, but this stellar pill is the hardest type to refine among all the medicinal pills. It is comparable to level nine medicinal pills. The Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital that this old man was at, nobody could refine it at all too. Back then, the Heavenly Dao backlash that this old man suffered was too severe. If not for City Lord bestowing a Bright Moon Purple Cloud Pill, this old man would have long passed away. It’s just that the Bright Moon Purple Cloud Pill is far too lacking compared to the Six Vein Stellar Pill. Furthermore, the quality isn’t high, that’s why this old man lingered on with my dying breath until today.”

Ye Yuan also sighed endlessly when he heard that. An exalted True God Realm powerhouse actually ended up in a tiny little imperial city, Jian Hongxiao was probably unresigned to it in his heart too, right?

“Senior, since that’s the case, can you lend the Six Vein Stellar Pill’s pill formula for me to view?” Ye Yuan said.

Jian Hongxiao smiled bitterly and said, “My Jian Family delves into the Dao of Divination, those who are skilled in refining pills are in the minority after all. Accomplished ones are even scanty few. Furthermore, this Six Vein Stellar Pill’s pill formula is my Jian Family’s special secret recipe. There’s only the pill formula in the great imperial capital, but this old man doesn’t know it.”

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Since that’s the case, then Ye Yuan will follow Senior and make a trip to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital.”

Jian Hongxiao was overjoyed when he heard that and said agitatedly, “Really?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If not for Senior divining fate for me at the risk of death, my brother would likely have been very hard to save. Just making a trip to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, it’s no big deal.”

Jian Hongxiao nodded and said, “Then ... I’ll have to trouble Little Friend Ye to make this trip! You go into closed-seclusion for some time in Extreme Light Imperial City. After you break through to the True God Realm, we’ll set off for Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital.”

...

Inside the hidden chamber, Ye Yuan’s eyes were shut and lost in thought, his brows tightly locked.

“At this rate, wouldn’t my chaos divine sea disappear completely and become a tiny little pill?”

Regarding the final result that he deduced, Ye Yuan was also rendered speechless.

He discovered that he could not understand the Chaos Heavenspan Canon more and more, even though this was the cultivation method that he deduced himself.

When others reached True God Realm, the small worlds within their bodies were already incomparably vast, and even starting to develop life already.

But for him?

His divine sea became smaller and smaller, and his chaos divine essence became more and more condensed.

At the rate of the current deduction results, Ye Yuan would have to condense this divine sea into a tiny pill after rank six.

It was just that at this point, Ye Yuan did not have a way out anymore.

Furthermore, up to this point, even though his realm differed greatly from others, in terms of strength, he flung those in the same realm several streets behind. There did not seem to be any harm.

“Forget it; the wood has already been made into a boat, follow all the way then! I want to see where this road leads to in the end! Since I have to compress the divine sea to the limit and become a pill after rank six, I’ll call it Origin Pill Realm then!”

Cultivation method already formed, Ye Yuan did not hesitate anymore, directly swallowing several medicinal pills and started assaulting the bottleneck.

Rumble!

The chaos divine essence in Ye Yuan’s divine sea seemed like a millstone, slowly turning.

Countless divine essence converged inside, like grinding beans. That millstone became smaller and smaller, increasingly smaller.

Those blue divine marks were also converging into the millstone continuously.

The internal space of Ye Yuan’s dantian area was being compressed bit by bit.

“Ugh ...”

Ye Yuan gave a muffled groan, feeling an intense swelling pain in his abdomen area.

However, Ye Yuan knew that this was far from the end!

Wanting to compress chaos divine essence, the energy required was extremely horrifying. Fortunately, Ye Yuan was long prepared, refining a batch of vast spirit divine pills to use to break through.

Ye Yuan only felt like his dantian area was practically about to explode.

Luckily, Ye Yuan’s physical body had already reached the realm of perfection long ago. Some pain was nothing to him.

No idea how long had passed either, a bolt of lightning suddenly flashed across inside Ye Yuan’s interior space. The chaos divine essence disappeared completely!

And inside Ye Yuan’s interior space, there was only a tiny little origin pill left. It was just the size of a fist.

“Huuuu ...”

Ye Yuan slowly let out a sigh of relief. Finally, he stepped into Origin Pill Realm!

Ye Yuan attempted to mobilize the divine essence within his body and suddenly threw a punch out!

Bang!

This hidden room directly exploded, turning into dust.

Fortunately, the place where Ye Yuan was at was the place Jian Hongxiao specially opened up for him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
