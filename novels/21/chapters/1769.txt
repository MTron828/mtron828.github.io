1773 Magic Eye Grotto

Ye Yuan’s eyes turned blood-red, berserk killing intent becoming corporeal, dispersing in all directions grandly.

“You really killed him?” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan’s murderous aura naturally could not pose any harm to Heavenly Tiger King.

In fact, the way they saw it, Ye Yuan’s anger was simply laughable.

Heavenly Tiger King laughed loudly and said, “Looks like your relationship with that white tiger is really very deep! But your anger is utterly meaningless to this king. This is a world where the weak are prey and the strong feast. If you don’t have the strength, even if you have monumental grievances, you also have to suppress it in your heart!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, his gaze icy-cold as he said in a cold voice, “I ask you, did you really kill him?”

“Haha, this kid is probably really a fool, he still can’t see the current situation clearly?”

“A rank four brat actually dares to threaten our Heavenly Tiger Mountain, this tone is also too big!”

“That punk called White Light actually dared to beat Young Patriarch Tigerheart to severe injuries, so serves him right to die!”

...

The fierce beasts following the Heavenly Tiger King all revealed teasing gazes.

To them, these powerhouses, occasionally toying with weaklings was also something pretty good.

Heavenly Tiger King burst into laughter and said, “Why, killed then killed, could it be that you’ll really make our entire Heavenly Tiger Mountain be buried in death? Brat, not that I’m looking down on you, but just the likes of you? Now, go and treat Tigerheart obediently. If you dare to have any devious thoughts, this king will make you unable to beg for life nor plead for death!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s entire person recovered tranquility. His body stopped trembling. His pair of eyes looked at the Heavenly Tiger King, not carrying the slightest emotion.

The current Ye Yuan already could not use words to describe his rage.

A cold light flashed, the Junyi Sword already arrived in Ye Yuan’s hand.

He walked over step by step toward the Heavenly Tiger King.

The Heavenly Tiger King’s eyes were full of amusement as he said with a cold smile, “Kid, if you don’t treat Tigerheart today, the consequences aren’t what you can bear!”

Bang!

All of a sudden, the Heavenly Tiger King’s aura was released fully. The powerful aura made the entire mountain forest tremble.

Even his subordinates were also all on tenterhooks, consciously retreating.

The Heavenly Tiger King already had one foot stepped into the threshold of rank six. The might of his imposing momentum, ordinary powerhouses could not withstand it at all.

Even Tiger Bright City Lord was not his match either. It could be seen how terrifying his strength was.

However, this powerful pressure had not closed in on Ye Yuan yet but the Heavenly Tiger King’s eyes already revealed a look of horror.

His powerful aura was actually being suppressed back.

His figure suddenly froze there.

“Which ... Which lord arrived? Please reveal yourself!”

No one answered him!

The Heavenly Tiger King had a look of shock on his face. He completely could not feel any aura. But now, he could not even move his fingers!

He could only helplessly watch Ye Yuan approach him.

Same as him, none of the other fierce beasts were able to move as well.

The Heavenly Tiger King suddenly startled awake, only then remembering the words Ye Yuan said before.

He said that he was going to make the entire Heavenly Tiger Mountain be buried with White Light!

He only took it as a joke previously. He did not expect that this Divine Lord Realm human brat could actually find such a terrifying helper!

Looking as Ye Yuan drew close step by step, the Heavenly Tiger King finally sensed the arrival of death.

He currently could not even perform divine essence body protection.

It was as easy as flipping his hand over for Ye Yuan to want to kill him!

Looking at Ye Yuan’s cold eyes, Heavenly Tiger King did not think that the other party would show mercy.

“H-Hang on! Maybe ... Maybe White Light isn’t dead!” Heavenly Tiger King said rather feebly.

Ye Yuan’s figure paused, not carrying the slightest emotion as he said, “You only have three breaths of time. If you can’t convince me, you die!”

Heavenly Tiger King broke out in cold sweat. He had never felt before such tremendous pressure.

“A-Actually, after White Light was captured by us, he was thrown into the Magic Eye Grotto! That place is the Skydemon Mountain Range’s forbidden land. As long as the person goes in, they have never come out alive before. So ... So ... he might still ... be alive ... right now.”

Talking to the back, Heavenly Tiger King’s voice became weaker and weaker.

Saying that White Light was still alive, even he himself did not quite believe it.

If White Light still had a trace of possibility of being alive, he would not deceive Ye Yuan either, saying that White Light was just being locked up.

However, Ye Yuan’s bone-piercing icy aura immediately thawed significantly.

An additional trace of hope appeared in his eyes.

As long as it was not Heavenly Tiger King killing him himself, then he still had a glimmer of hope of survival.

Ye Yuan believed all along that White Light was not such an ill-fated person!

Following Ye Yuan putting away the Junyi Sword, the murderous aura on him dissipated considerably. That lofty suppression force on Heavenly Tiger King’s body also disappeared along with it.

Heavenly Tiger King was shocked in his heart. He was completely unable to imagine what kind of strength the other party had, to be able to make him unable to even use demonic divine essence!

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Tiger King coldly and said, “Speak, what’s the deal with this Magic Eye Grotto! You should be clear that you don’t have a second chance!”

“Dare not, dare not! Heavenly Tiger will definitely say all that I know and say it without reserve!”

How did the current Heavenly Tiger King still have any mettle of a hegemon of a region?

In front of Ye Yuan, he was like a well-behaved little kitten, meek to the extreme.

He knew that that powerhouse hiding in the dark only needed a thought to be able to kill him!

Heavenly Tiger King deliberately shrunk his body, becoming half a size shorter than Ye Yuan. He carefully paid attention to his wording before slowly saying, “The Skydemon Mountain Range under our Empyrean Cloudridge’s command has three forbidden lands: Purple Void Summit, Cloudsea Bamboo Forest, as well as the Magic Eye Grotto. Purple Void Summit is the roosting place of Empyrean Cloudridge, while the other two are death zones! No one knows what’s inside the Magic Eye Grotto. But I heard that back then, there was a rank six great demon who had once gone in before. However, he never came out again. Since then, no one dare to enter anymore.”

Speaking up to here, Heavenly Tiger King could not resist sneaking a peek at Ye Yuan but discovered that Ye Yuan was still emotionless, unable to discern what he was thinking at all.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan turned around and walked over toward Tigerheart again.

The Heavenly Tiger King looked at Ye Yuan in surprise and discovered that he actually started treating Tigerheart again!

Under Ye Yuan’s marvelous skills, Tigerheart’s heart grew in strength little by little.

After five days, Tigerheart appeared in front of the Heavenly Tiger King brimming with vitality and vigor.

Until now, the Heavenly Tiger King still did not quite dare to believe it. He said to Ye Yuan gratefully, “Many thanks, Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan had a cold face and pointed at Tigerheart as he said, “Don’t be in a rush to thank me first. He has to enter the Magic Eye Grotto together with me!”

The Heavenly Tiger King did not have time to be happy yet and his tiger body trembled as he cried out in shock, “This ... How can this do?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If I’m unable to come out, that person naturally won’t eradicate your Heavenly Tiger Mountain. Your son will be buried in death for me and my brother! This is the karma that you planted yourself, so you have to bear the consequence!”

Ye Yuan was clearly in his heart, Wing wanted to find an opponent that could rival him, and not nurture a worthless wretch who grew up in a greenhouse.

If not for the sake of rescuing White Light, Ye Yuan also would not make the temple send an expert over.

As for entering the Magic Eye Grotto, that was clearly impossible.

And if Ye Yuan died inside the Magic Eye Grotto, everything was naturally dropped!
