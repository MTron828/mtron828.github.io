Chapter 2912: Ancestor Ye Came to Save Us!

“Enough! I can’t take it anymore! You, this fellow, are you done yet?”

Lu Yan directly blew up, pointing at Ye Yuan as he started to bellow.

The others in the great hall were also all glaring.

This guy was simply a vampire!

The heavenly medicines that he asked for previously virtually depleted half of the sect’s accumulations.

Now, he wanted more?

Another half-step Emperor Realm also said angrily, “What rubbish ancestor! Sect Master, even if I’m struck dead by heaven, I’ll also chase this guy out of the Sublime Pill Sect today!” Another half-step Emperor Realm also said angrily.

The others spoke up one after another, criticizing Ye Yuan.

Their patience had already reached its limits.

Wang Jun also looked at Ye Yuan with a helpless look and said, “Ancestor Ye, the list that you gave previously has already depleted more than half of the sect’s accumulations! If you want more, the sect’s disciples won’t be able to cultivate normally anymore.”

Ye Yuan could not help being taken aback and said, “Is that so? Then it’s really a shame. Since that’s the case, you pick some strong ones to consume these heavenly pills first. The Sublime Pill Sect still needs some powerhouses to protect it.”

It was only to see him flick his sleeves grandly. Piles of bottles and vials appeared before everyone’s eyes.

Lu Yang, who was still blowing his top earlier, his eyes went wide.

Inside the bottles and vials, that profound undulation already filled the entire great hall!

Profound grade!

Sublime Pill Sect was established with alchemy. There was no shortage of alchemy path experts in the sect.

They naturally knew about profound grade heavenly pills!

Wang Jun shot to his feet, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of disbelief as he said quiveringly, “Ancestor Ye, you’re saying that … these … these heavenly pills, are all for us?”

Ye Yuan said, “Otherwise? These heavenly pills are of little use to me. I’ve already adapted to the origin of blood, my strength improving greatly. I’m about to transcend tribulation and break through my realm right away. There are 20 profound grade Resplendent Divine Emperor Pills in here. It should be sufficient to let Lu Yan three people step into Emperor Realm. The rest are also enough to let the collective strength of True Sovereign Heavens reach a higher level.”

“2-20 profound grade Resplendent Divine Emperor Pills?” Wang Jun felt like he was listening to a book from heaven.

Resplendent Divine Emperor Pill, that was a miraculous heavenly pill that could create Emperor Realms!

The refining difficulty was not an ordinary kind of high.

Even Ancestor Hang Yang could not refine profound grade Resplendent Divine Emperor Pills too. Ancestor Ye, a grade six heavenly alchemist, could refine it?

Could Emperor Realms be nurtured using heavenly pills?

Of course they could!

Not just Emperor Cloud Heaven, even Hegemon Realms could be groomed using chaos heavenly pills too!

But the sad thing was that the heavenly medicines required to refine this sort of chaos heavenly pill were seriously too rarely seen.

Not a single strain might be born in 100 thousand years!

It was just that the nurturing of Emperor Realms was very different from the previous cultivation realms.

Even if the pill entered profound grade, it was also no guarantee that a half-step Emperor Cloud Heaven could step into Emperor Cloud Heaven.

Emperor Realm was too mysterious!

Therefore, Ye Yuan refined 20 in one go.

No matter how poor the aptitudes of Lu Yan three people were, 20 was enough for them to step into Emperor Realm too.

After all, it was profound grade!

If not for these 20 Resplendent Divine Emperor Pills, it would not have emptied out the Sublime Pill Sect’s accumulated resources too.

But, even if the Sublime Pill Sect’s accumulated resources were emptied out fully, it could not purchase 20 Resplendent Divine Emperor Pills too!

No, just talking in terms of value, it could at most just buy one or two.

This thing was too precious!

Wang Jun looked at Ye Yuan, as if having seen a ghost, and said, “You … You’re just lower True Sovereign Heaven. You … You can already refine profound grade heavenly pills?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No.”

Wang Jun let out a long sigh in relief and muttered, “Luckily.”

“I could already do it at middle Saint Sovereign Heaven.”

“… …”

The Sublime Pill Sect disciples present felt incredibly blown away.

Too … Too demoralizing!

Everyone refined pills. Why were you so outstanding?

Profound grade was a realm that was lofty and out of reach.

Forget about a measly little lower True Sovereign Heaven; even if it was Emperor Vast Heaven, being able to step into profound grade was very rare too. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

One had to know, when Ye Yuan entered profound grade back then, even a top sect like the Extreme Medicine Sect was shaken.

How could a puny little Sublime Pill Sect not be horrified?

Even when the Sublime Pill Sect was at its peak, the people who could enter the realm of profound grade did not surpass three people too!

Now, a lower True Sovereign Heaven went into a closed-seclusion for a few months’ time and took out a bunch of profound grade heavenly pills.

This sort of thing was seriously too shocking.

So when they learned that Ye Yuan turned those heavenly medicines into profound grade heavenly pills, they were completely flustered.

At this time, Wang Jun they all finally understood why back then Hegemon Cloudmount could not even be bothered to gave Ancestor Hang Yang a glance.

In their view, Ancestor Hang Yang, who could develop a Sublime Realm sect into an Emperor Sakra Heaven level major sect, was absolutely amazingly talented already.

But, compared to this one in front of them, he was truly pummeled until not even dregs remained!

This was a true genius!

Only such a genius was fit to become the disciple of that kind of existence!

Thud!

Lu Yang directly knelt down in front of Ye Yuan and cried bitterly as he said, “Ancestor Ye, t-this disciple deserves death! This disciple shouldn’t have criticized Ancestor behind your back, shouldn’t have projected my own shortcomings onto others! This disciple is unfilial. Ancestor, please punish!”

At this time, Lu Yan really felt that he could look for a hole to crawl into.

These few days, he had a stomach full of complaints.

If not for Wang Jun suppressing it, he would have long broken in and chased Ye Yuan away.

But only now did he understand that Ye Yuan wanted these heavenly medicines not for himself but for the Sublime Pill Sect and him!

He was really worse than a beast to actually scold Ancestor Ye behind his back!

He currently wished to find a hole in the ground to tunnel into.

“Ancestor Ye, t-this disciple also played a part! Ancestor, please punish!”

“Ancestor Ye, please punish!”

Even the half-step Emperor Realms as well as those True Sovereign Heavens all knelt down too.

These few days, they criticized Ye Yuan plenty.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “All get up. This matter was in fact my fault. It was me who was anxious to enter closed-seclusion and didn’t explain things clearly. Since the Sublime Pill Sect is the Dao teaching that my master left behind, then I, this disciple, naturally have the responsibility to guard it. You guys also wouldn’t have called me Ancestor Ye in vain.”

Lu Yan was completely convinced. He kowtowed heavily to Ye Yuan, exclaiming, “Ancestor Ye has a mind as open as a valley. This disciple admires! From now on, this disciple will follow Ancestor Ye’s lead!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “No need to waste time on this. After you all distribute the heavenly pills, go into a closed-seclusion respectively. This ancestor is going to transcend tribulation.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan’s figure moved and already went out of the great hall.

Very soon, terrifying undulations came from outside.

Wang Jun and the rest exchanged glances, the look of shock on their faces growing stronger.

What terrifying undulations!

They could also tell that Ye Yuan was a divergent cultivator.

But this True Sovereign Dao Tribulation was a little too terrifying, right?

Such a terrifying True Sovereign Dao Tribulation, could Ancestor Ye overcome it?

Upon coming out to see, everyone was dumbfounded with shock.

Ye Yuan was akin to a living god or devil under the Dao tribulation.

A Dao sword destroyed all of the Dao tribulations!

After refining the origin of blood, Ye Yuan’s strength became powerful until it was hair-raising!

Coupled with the power of blessing, this True Sovereign Dao Tribulation was no longer able to do anything to him.

Seeing this scene, Wang Jun suddenly had tears running down his face as he said, “Perhaps, Patriarch Cloudmount heard our prayers and sent Ancestor Ye to come and save us!”
