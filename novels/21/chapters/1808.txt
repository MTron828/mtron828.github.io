Chapter 1812 Five Drumbeats

High up in the sky, seven enormous drums spanned above the clouds, faintly discernible.Auspicious clouds intertwined between the drums, portraying an enormous ladle shape. It was precisely the shape of the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum.

Seven huge drums combined together; the might of that aura made Ye Yuan shudder with fear.

The Jadelight Drum that was drummed when entering the sect compared to now simply paled in comparison.

Ye Yuan had a feeling that if one’s prowess was up to par, the power of the seven drums sounding together could probably level a sub-peak to the ground.

It was also Ye Yuan’s first time seeing an attack-type empyrean spirit treasure. The power of the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum also made him secretly astonished.

Regardless of whether it was the World Suppressing Stele or the Soul Suppressing Pearl, they were both very gentle. But this Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum was filled with an offensive aura, making people palpitate with anxiety and fear.

“Scared silly, right, kid? However, the Seven Stars Valley has already opened. You already have no regret medicine that you can eat,” Tianzhu Peak’s skill-imparting elder said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “There has never been the word ‘regret’ in my dictionary.”

Ye Yuan leaped and flew toward the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum.

Arriving in front of it, Ye Yuan felt as if he arrived inside a vortex of laws. The power of laws from all directions were all assailing him.

For a moment, Ye Yuan seemed to have walked into a turbulent flow and could not even stabilize his figure; teetering on his feet.

“Haha, that kid doesn’t know anything and he dares to challenge the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum! Woodcutter, I think that you probably suffered a big loss this time!” said an elder with a big laugh when he saw Ye Yuan’s distressed state.

The woodcutter gave a cold snort but did not refute.

If Ye Yuan was in this state, it was likely really hard to complete three drumbeats. He was also faintly worried.

But right at this time, a profound aura on Ye Yuan’s body gradually spread. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The moment this aura emerged, those violent turbulent flows immediately calmed down. Ye Yuan’s figure also immediately stabilized.

When the group of elders saw this scene, all of them had strange expressions, clearly being quite surprised.

No matter how high one’s talent was, without corresponding strength, it was also pointless.

For example, a Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artist was incredibly talented and even had the possibility of reaching the True God Realm in the future.

But without the support of strength, when facing the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, it was very dangerous.

These skill-imparting elders had all before drummed the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum and were deeply aware of its might.

They clearly did not expect that Ye Yuan could get acclimatized to it so quickly.

However, Ye Yuan’s next move gave them an even bigger scare that they turned pale.

It was only to see Ye Yuan form his fingers as a sword and directly pointed toward the Jadelight Drum.

Dong!

The Jadelight Drum was sounded without any hindrance!

The drumbeat shook the heavens, instantly sweeping throughout the entire Seven Stars Valley.

However, Ye Yuan did not stop in the slightest. He pointed a finger out again.

Dong!

The second Sun Opening Drum was also sounded!

Dong!

Ye Yuan pointed a third finger out, the Jade Scale Drum was sounded!

Three drumbeats in a row made all of the skill-imparting elders’ faces change.

“How did this kid do it? Even if it’s me, it’s also impossible to do it as effortlessly as him!”

“This old man sounded three drumbeats back then, but I only barely managed to do it after failing several dozen times. He did it on the first try?”

When the woodcutter saw everyone’s astonished expressions, he could not resist laughing loudly and said, “Your Father said that Ye Yuan is different from the others! How is it, are you surprised? Haha ...”

The woodcutter had always been a maverick and did not get along with the other skill-imparting elders.

Now, seeing them get deflated, he could not help feeling immensely pleased.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan pointed a fourth finger out!

But this time, he did not succeed.

It was only to see his mouth spray blood wildly, figure flying out backward, already injured by the Heavenly Authority Drum.

The woodcutter’s face changed, directly firing out a stream of world power, catching Ye Yuan.

When the other elders saw this scene, each and every one of them secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

Just now, Ye Yuan amazed the world with a single brilliant feat really gave them a big scare.

The main reason was that Ye Yuan beat the drums too casually. It was as if these drums were like Ye Yuan’s toys.

There was that instant where they virtually thought that Ye Yuan could really sound the seven drums.

Only all the way until Ye Yuan was injured did they suddenly realize that beating the drums was not that easy for Ye Yuan.

Although these skill-imparting elders were high above the masses, their strength no idea how many times stronger than Ye Yuan, they still did not escape the boundary of humans and still had seven emotions and six desires.

They were all once peerless geniuses, presently top experts.

Everyone was all unable to sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, they were all very at peace in their hearts.

But now, someone wanted to break this balance and ride above them, they could not quite accept it in the depths of their hearts.

The woodcutter asked rather worriedly, “Are you alright, Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Looks like I underestimated the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum! Heh heh, indeed well-deserving of being an empyrean spirit treasure, strong enough!”

Ye Yuan discovered that these seven drums were completely not independent entities, being able to sound one means being able to sound the next.

When Ye Yuan sounded the Sun Opening Drum, he discovered that the Great Dao aura coming from it grew more than ten times stronger than before!

While the Jade Scale Drum was also more than ten times stronger than the Sun Opening Drum.

This was also to say that when Ye Yuan sounded the Jade Scale Drum, the countershock-force was already a hundred times stronger than the Jadelight Drum!

That fourth Heavenly Authority Drum was a thousand times!

Moreover, the power of this Jadelight Drum was completely overwhelming.

This terrifying increment was not what ordinary people could withstand at all.

The woodcutter urged and said, “Looks like you felt it too. The Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum is a whole, the more you drum, the stronger it gets, and the greater the amplitude too. Reaching the last Heavenly Pivot Drum, that backlash-force is not what the average person can imagine at all. Ye Yuan, don’t push it. You’ve already proven your talent now. Even if you withdraw, no one will look down on you too!”

He was optimistic about Ye Yuan’s future but did not look well on Ye Yuan being able to sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum.

This kind of thing was not what human strength could accomplish at all.

Perhaps Ye Yuan could really do it in the future, but right now, he definitely could not.

Ye Yuan struggled to get up and shook his head as he said, “No matter how difficult this drum is to sound, I’ll also sound it today!”

Finished talking, he leaped and arrived high up in the sky once more.

After preparing for a while, Ye Yuan attacked once more!

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

After three drums, Ye Yuan was knocked flying again.

But he was not discouraged. After a period of adjustment, he made his move once more!

Attempting, failed. Trying again, failed again; rinse and repeat.

Ye Yuan’s stubbornness did not cause the elders to be moved.

On the contrary, they mocked Ye Yuan’s overestimation of his ability even more.

“This brat’s physical body is also strong. If it were others, they would have long died several times over.”

“Heh, some things can’t be done by relying on effort.”

“Reckless and blind fool, really wasting time. Best that it shocks him to death!”

“This kid only has the strength of three drums, still not conceding to it is also a waste of time.”

...

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

That elder’s voice had just faded when the fourth and five drumbeats sounded in a row after several dozen attempts.
