Chapter 1657 Backlash

In a few bids, the price of the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone directly doubled.

This stance of being determined to get it really cowed quite a number of people.

However, this was clearly not the final outcome.

With such a sucker placed there, how was there a reason to not cheat him?

Suddenly, a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse shouted, “51 billion!”

Jing Lu’s face fell. He was still pleased with himself for a while when he saw that he stumped everyone earlier.

He did not expect that in a blink of an eye, someone raised the price.

He gritted his teeth and said, “I don’t believe it! 52 billion!”

That person said coolly, “53 billion!”

Jing Lu was enraged until his face was livid and he continued, “60 billion!”

This time, that martial artist did not increase the price anymore. He said smiled faintly and said, “I don’t want anymore, better give it to him!”

The moment Jing Lu heard, his face could not help revealing a smug look and he said with a cold smile, “Fighting with this young master, can you afford to contend?”

Jing Lu’s voice was not concealed, everyone in the room heard it.

Those present were mostly clear-headed people, everyone’s faces revealed a knowing smile.

He slightly used a bit of trick and he directly increased by ten billion.

Uncle Huang could not bear to look straight ahead, but he could not speak up to warn either, his expression crumbling.

Jian Zhentao smiled slightly and said, “60 billion, is there still higher than 60 billion? If there isn’t this piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone will belong to the Heaven No. 5 Room’s guest!”

Everyone was silent. Everyone felt that the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone already exceeded its original value and that it was clearly not worth to make a move anymore.

Right at this time, a faint voice sounded out, “100 billion!” This made everyone feel surprised.

Among the audience, someone immediately whispered, “100 billion! Someone actually offered 100 billion to buy a piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone! Isn’t this being a sucker?”

At this time, an extremely experienced person explained, “Heh heh, a little interesting! This isn’t a sucker, but an expert!”

“Mn? What do you mean?”

“Clearly, this piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone, guests in Heaven No. 5 Room and Supreme No. 4 Room are determined to get it and absolutely won’t allow the slightest accident. But Supreme No. 4 Room’s guest has never made a move. He was waiting to see how much his opponent had! Now, his opponent is clearly only left with the Heaven No. 5 Room’s guest. And at this time, he raised the price to 100 billion all of a sudden. It has probably already reached Heaven No. 5 Room’s limits. This way, he can save divine essence stones to the greatest degree. Because Heaven No. 5 Room exposed too much!”

That person said in shock, “There’s actually still this kind of strategy?”

“That’s of course! At times, auctions will encounter this kind of situation. Some people are aiming at an item. No matter what, he has to win the bid. At this time, the tactic becomes very important. You look, Heaven No. 5 Room still wants to increase the price, but he already can’t increase it anymore!”

When Jing Lu heard this offer, his expression immediately became incomparably ugly.

He brought a total of 120 billion out. Right now, he was only left with 103.5 billion.

Ye Yuan’s price quote directly pushed his limit. He was unable to increase the price anymore.

Gritting his teeth, Jing Lu yelled, “103.5 billion!”

Then in the next second, Ye Yuan opened his mouth and said indifferently again, “105 billion!”

Bang!

Jing Lu smashed the tea table in front of him with a palm and said angrily, “Damn it! This person is a lunatic, right? To actually spend over 100 billion to buy a piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone!”

Uncle Huang let out a sigh and said, “Young Patriarch, forget it. That person is the same as us, hell-bent on obtaining the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone.”

Jian Zhentao also did not expect that this piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone could be sold at such a high price.

“This piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone belongs to the guest in the Supreme No. 4 room!” Jian Zhentao announced.

He was very curious just who was in this Supreme No. 4 Room, to actually play with auctioning tricks to such a high degree of perfection.

Actually, when Jing Lu called out 60 billion, he estimated that Jing Lu’s limit was roughly 100 billion.

But he had immersed in this for many years, his experience being exceedingly rich. That was how he had this estimation.

That Supreme No. 4 Room’s guest actually had such judgment too. Presumably, he must be an expert.

Jian Zhentao thought in his heart, this Supreme No. 4 Room is rather interesting. In a while, I must broaden my experience.

The following auctions had nothing to do with Ye Yuan anymore.

Even though the cost of buying the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone far exceeded his expectations, he did not feel that there was anything.

As long as it could preserve Mu Lingxue’s life, forget about 100 billion, so what even if 1 trillion?

There were quite a number of forces present that came from Celestial Deity factions.

The last few auction items could only be used by Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses. The competition was also abnormally fierce.

These things were too far away for Ye Yuan. Moreover, Ye Yuan did not lack them either.

As long as he broke through to the Divine Lord Realm and opened up the Purple Extreme Hall’s second level, the good things inside were definitely too many to count.

After the auction ended, Ye Yuan went backstage to pay with divine essence stones. He did not expect that Jian Zhentao was actually already waiting there.

Jian Zhentao saw Ye Yuan, his gaze involuntarily turning intent.

He did not think that such a veteran bidding technique actually came from such a young person’s hands.

“Elder Jian!” Ye Yuan said with Jian Zhentao with clasped hands.

Toward this Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, Ye Yuan was still very interested.

He very much wanted to understand what kind of Heavenly Dao laws could let them cultivate such mysterious divine essence.

Jian Zhentao smiled and said, “Indeed, heroes come from youngsters! I really didn’t expect that Supreme No. 4 Room’s guest was actually such a young man!”

At this time, Li Xing suddenly appeared and said, “Huhu, Elder Jian isn’t aware, Master Ye isn’t an ordinary young man!”

Jian Zhentao was slightly surprised and looked towards Li Xing and said, “Oh? How is he not ordinary?”

Li Xing smiled and briefly recounted Ye Yuan’s situation.

In his heart, Jian Zhentao was wildly in shock. He said somewhat disbelievingly, “Alchemy God Li, you can’t simply say this kind of words! This old man has lived to this ripe old age and could be said to be very knowledgeable and experienced. I’ve also not seen before void spirit divine pills more than a few times.”

Li Xing smiled and said, “This matter, Riverluck Capital City’s people are all aware. Moreover, how could this Li dare to talk rubbish in front of Elder Jian?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s lineage proliferated, their family extremely massive, and they were scattered all over the Heavenspan World. Jian Zhentao was merely a very distant offspring of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets.

But even so, no one dared to underestimate Jian Zhentao too.

Because no one dared to underestimate the Jian Family.

Jian Zhentao was incomparably shocked in his heart and unconsciously revolved divine essence, applying it on his two eyes, and looked over toward Ye Yuan.

“ARGH!!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jian Zhentao suddenly screamed miserably, covering his eyes with both eyes.

Li Xing could not help turning pale with fright when he saw the situation and hurriedly said, “Elder Jian, what’s wrong with you?”

Jian Zhentao put down both hands tremblingly, the surrounding people all got a big shock.

It was only to see his two eyes tightly shut with two rows of bloody tears flowing down the corners of his eyes, looking incomparably grim.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that this kind of situation would appear and said worriedly, “Elder Jian, are you alright?”

Jian Zhentao slowly shook his head and said, “This old self is inept and incurred Little Friend Ye Yuan’s ridicule.”
