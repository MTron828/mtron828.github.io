Chapter 2409: Eradicating Nine-marks with Ease!

Sword of Spacetime, it could annihilate spacetime!

It could even annihilate spacetime; let alone people?

How could the sharpness of this sword be what human strength could block?

Even on the humans’ side, each and every one of them, their hearts shook wildly too.

This sword of source looked not much different from before, but it was actually a terrifying existence that fused three great laws!

Wan Zhen said in shock, “The fusion of time and spatial laws is a hundred times harder than fusing the Five Element Laws! Lord Saint Azure’s talent is truly too terrifying!”

Pang Zhen also said, “Fusing time and spatial laws, that is nothing. After all, Grand Ancestor Spacetime had once done it before too! But, fusing time, space, and sword, these three great laws, and creating this Sword of Spacetime move, it’s terrifying!”

“Lord Saint Azure is mighty! No wonder he said, if people don’t force themselves, they really won’t know how great their potential is at times! In this battle, I also gained a lot. After going back, I’ll definitely have breakthroughs!”

The others nodded one after another, agreeing with this.

The struggle between life and death was best at stimulating potential.

Many companions died in this battle.

But those who survived would benefit endlessly!

None of those present were mediocre people. Each one was a proud child of heaven.

After a bout of fierce fighting, they already benefited a lot.

After going back, as long as they calmed down and tried to digest their gains, they would definitely make huge breakthroughs.

Of course, no matter how big the breakthrough, it also would not be able to compare to Ye Yuan fusing three great laws!

Ye Yuan’s aura was still rising, already approaching peak World Realm.

Yuan Zhen’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He was still mocking Ye Yuan previously, saying that his Heavenly Dao True Martial could ignore spacetime law.

But now, facing the Sword of Spacetime that was condensed from spacetime law, he was unbelievably fearful!

This sword was a sword that could cleave his Celestial Avatar in two!

Its sharpness was already unable to use words to describe.

“Still in a daze for what? Attack together! Take advantage of the fact that he hasn’t broken through yet and kill him! Use the Lesser Three Origin Formation!” Yuan Zhen roared loudly.

Tian Zhao and Li Qing received the order and formed a horn-shaped formation with Yuan Zhen. The three people’s auras immediately rose significantly.

This Lesser Three Origin Formation could actually enhance the strength of Nine-marks powerhouses!

However, when Ye Yuan saw this scene, he laughed.

“Looks like your divine race is also advancing with the times! This array formation is quite profound. It’s just that you guys don’t know that I’m the ancestor of this array formation! Forming this array formation in front of me, you guys are displaying your slight skill before an expert!”

The divine race advocated individual combat power and did not have much awareness of group combat.

But now, when the divine race came into being again, they changed a lot.

This Divine Children Legion’s fighting will was powerhouse, their warriors cooperated with each other tacitly. They had clearly undergone strict training.

While Yuan Zhen, this kind of Nine-marks major power, could actually use this Lesser Three Origin Formation to this level, it also made people’s jaws drop.

Clearly, they had grasped the lesson of the last defeat in the Doomsday Battle. They learned a lot from the myriad races.

This Lesser Three Origin Formation was one of them!

But the reason why Ye Yuan laughed was that he saw too many of his own Formation Dao signs in this Lesser Three Origin Formation!

The 18 inheritance grand arrays that he left behind had the inheritance of Formation Dao.

This Lesser Three Origin Formation of the divine race, although it was very advanced, it was clearly secretly learned from the humans.

Ye Yuan saw it clearly at a glance.

It was just that how could Yuan Zhen they all know that the existence who influenced the direction of the Doomsday Battle an epoch ago was precisely this young man in front of them!

And the things that they secretly learned had also evolved from precisely the inheritances that Ye Yuan left behind.

“Heh heh, truly a shameless boasting fellow! The Lesser Three Origin Formation was created by my divine race’s Formation Path Master, Fei Liu, what has it got to do with you? To talk about ancestors, Master Fei Liu being your ancestor is adequate!” Yuan Zhen could not help saying with a cold laugh when he heard that.

Ye Yuan did not answer, he just smiled faintly, lifted his fingertip, and said, “Sword of Spacetime, go!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Whoosh!

Without any sound of tearing across the air, the Sword of Spacetime was sent out once again.

In a blink, the Sword of Spacetime crossed a distance of 100 thousand feet and slashed accurately somewhere between the three people.

Boom!

The Lesser Three Origin Formation collapsed instantly!

The three people’s skyrocketed aura also instantly dissipated without a trace, recovering to their previous state once again.

Yuan Zhen’s eyes became wide-saucers, a look of disbelief on his face.

In this epoch, Master Fei Liu studied the human race’s Formation Dao, and he had long already reached the level of rank five source!

Even if Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao reached rank two Formation Dao, it was also impossible to crack the Lesser Three Origin Formation with one move, right?

This Lesser Three Origin Formation was created by Master Fei Liu painstakingly.

With three people as a small combat unit, it could greatly enhance the combat power of the divine race.

To a powerhouse at the level of Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm, once they joined forces, then the combat power would definitely soar.

Originally, their combat power was several times higher than that of humans.

Once the Lesser Three Origin Formation was activated, the three of them working together, even if there were 20 human powerhouses, it would likely be hard to get close to.

But such an array formation was actually cracked by Ye Yuan in a blink of an eye.

This kind of thing was simply puzzling.

They did not understand the hidden meaning in Ye Yuan’s words at all.

They did not understand, but Wan Zhen and the rest were perfectly clear!

The divine race secretly learned the human race’s Formation Dao but did not know that the human race’s terrifying Formation Dao later on, came entirely from Ye Yuan’s legacy.

Although the things that the human race’s Grand Ancestor Formation Dao comprehended later on were already very different from Ye Yuan’s, in terms of the source, they came from the same root.

Using the array formation that Ye Yuan passed down in front of Ye Yuan, wasn’t this teaching one’s grandmother how to suck eggs?

And this scene also made Wan Zhen, Pang Zhen, and the rest, admire Ye Yuan even more.

Lord Saint Azure’s influence on these ten billion years was seriously too far-reaching!

The Formation Dao legacy that he left behind was secretly learned by the divine race!

The Alchemy Dao legacy that he left behind was feared by the divine race!

The spacetime legacy that he left behind exiled Progenitor Tian Qing in the turbulent flow of time and space for ten billion years!

This kind of might already transmigrated time and space. It was too fantastical!

“Sword of Spacetime, kill!”

Just as everyone was shocked, Ye Yuan controlled the Sword of Spacetime again, charging over towards Tian Zhao.

This sword was swift to the extreme.

Tian Zhao’s expression changed wildly, wanting to avoid it madly.

But, this sword already locked onto him, not giving him any chance to evade at all.

He was not Yuan Zhen who could control a powerful physical body to avoid the Sword of Spacetime.

Compared to Yuan Zhen, he was too weak!

Puchi!

Under the one sword, Tian Zhao was beheaded!

A Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse died just like this!

Everyone started dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape, looking at this scene in incredible shock.

A powerful Nine-marks powerhouse was killed by a Heavenly Emperor Realm human just like that?

The Divine Children Legion’s warriors felt like their world views had been subverted.

Nine-marks powerhouses had unparalleled combat power, one was actually leap-frogged and killed by a human!

How could this kind of thing possibly happen?

“L-Lord Tian Zhao died just like this?”

“That human, he killed a Nine-marks powerhouse while breaking through his cultivation realm!”

“When did humans become so monstrous? Could it be that our divine race isn’t the strongest?”

... ...

Many people started doubting life.

The morale that the Divine Children Legion had just roused up earlier was immediately suppressed.
