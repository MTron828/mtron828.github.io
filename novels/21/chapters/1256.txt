Chapter 1260: The Eyes of the Black Crows!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Caw, caw, caw ...”

As if answering Ye Yuan’s words, the crows on the treetop gave off extremely unpleasant cries.

White Light could not help flying into a great rage the moment he heard. Raising his hand, a palm slapped over!

Ye Yuan did not stop White Light, because he also wished to see just how terrifying this Deathsoul Tree was.

However, the subsequent scene gave the three people a huge shock!

The heaven and earth essence energy that White Light mustered only advanced a distance of 30 feet and immediately dissipated into nothing!

It was as if a force that they were completely unable to understand existed in this space.

“This ...”

White Light could not help looking at Ye Yuan, a look of shock on his face.

This Deathsoul Tree indeed lived up to its reputation!

But at this time, they hoped for this Deathsoul Tree’s reputation to fall short of reality even more.

Ye Yuan was likewise inexplicably shocked. White Light’s strength, he was all too clear.

Perfect White Tiger Physique let White Light comprehend the White Tiger Darklight Divine Art to the Divine Dao realm long ago.

The current White Light’s strength was even more than a magnitude greater compared to the Soul Martial Divine King, Zhong Zizhen.

But the power of his one palm move actually could not even leave the 30 feet area in front of him!

Ye Yuan had never encountered such a bizarre thing before!

Just now, he clearly detected a tiny hint of undulation. That kind of undulation, with his current realm, it could not be understood at all.

“Is this the Deathsoul Tree? As expected, ridiculously strong! No wonder even Deity Realm powerhouses are certain to die. Looks like this Deathsoul Tree isn’t what our cultivation realm can resist at all,” Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said.

Suddenly, an ancient and somber voice sounded out by Ye Yuan’s ear.

That voice sounded incomparably somber, giving people an extremely uncomfortable feeling, just like ... the crows were talking.

Looking closely, wasn’t it that crow in the middle that was talking? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“There’s finally such fresh divine souls taking the initiative to deliver themselves to the door! Mmm ... your divine soul, it seems to be very tasty!”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned sharp, his entire seemingly being stared at by the death god, feeling like his whole divine soul was about to leave his body!

The crow was currently staring at Ye Yuan at this time, making Ye Yuan feel that his divine soul was about to collapse and disintegrate.

Feeling extreme uneasiness was Ye Yuan’s genuine emotion at this time!

In the depths of his sea of consciousness, the Soul Suppressing Pearl faintly emitted a trace of undulation. Soon enough, Ye Yuan’s divine soul calmed down.

“Senior, the three of us had no intention of offending. We just mistakenly entered this place. Hope that Senior will let us go,” Ye Yuan forcefully suppressed the oppressiveness in his heart and said with cupped fists.

“En? You can actually withstand my divine soul pressure? Interesting, interesting!” The crow’s voice revealed a mild surprise.

It was just that his voice made people’s hair stand on end.

“Look into my eyes!” said the crow as it opened its mouth as if there was a magical power in its voice.

Ye Yuan just felt his divine soul quiver, and that feeling of collapse welled up in his heart once more!

Can’t look! Absolutely can’t look!

Ye Yuan also did not know to what extent the Soul Suppressing Pearl could achieve. He was actually very uncertain in his heart too.

After all, this Deathsoul Tree was an existence that surpassed the Deity Realm in the legends!

In the present age where Divine Dao dwindled to zero, that kind of existence virtually as powerful as being able to coexist alongside Heavenly Dao. There was absolutely no way to imagine it.

Therefore, he did not dare to look at the crow’s eyes.

Except, his body did not seem to obey his command, his gaze involuntarily shifting towards that crow in the center.

All the cold sweat in Ye Yuan’s body seemingly poured out like a fountain.

In virtually an instant, his entire body was drenched in sweat.

Past life and this life, even when facing Ji Canglan back then, he was also not so despaired and powerless before.

This was a confrontation on a completely different level!

Even if facing Heavenly Fiendgod Kanuo, he at least had strength leftover to resist.

At the very least, he could imagine what kind of existence Kanuo was.

But now, Ye Yuan did not have the least bit of margin to resist!

Ye Yuan wanted to attack to resist, but his body seemed to have a paralyzing spell cast on it, unable to move even a finger at all!

The only things that could move were his eyes!

Ye Yuan was unable to understand why in the age where Divine Dao dwindled to zero, there would still be an existence like this.

Could it be that surpassing Divine Dao, one would be able to not be constrained by Heavenly Dao anymore?

It was just that, there was already no more time to let him ponder over now.

Ye Yuan used every last ounce of his strength, wanting to shift his gaze towards White Light there. Suddenly, his mind shook heavily.

He clearly saw White Light’s divine soul leave the body, flying straight for that crow on the left!

As for Shi Potian, the stoneman clan was a very special existence. All of their everything existed inside the heart of stone. There was no divine soul at all.

But Ye Yuan saw another scene that made him feel alarmed and rage.

Lu-er’s divine soul actually flew out of the Vast Heaven Pagoda, flying towards that crow on the right!

Ye Yuan glared with his eyes wide, feeling like his entire person was about to explode!

Powerless!

Tremendous powerlessness!

Only now did he know that it turned out this third crow was not prepared for Shi Potian but prepared for Lu-er!

As for Li-er, because her physique was special, her spirit and flesh could not be separated long ago. The Deathsoul Tree actually did not prepare a crow for her.

However, Shi Potian also did not move a muscle currently. Clearly, he was being restrained too.

Shi Potian’s strength was even greater than Ye Yuan’s. He was once a genuine Deity Realm powerhouse!

But he was still not the Deathsoul Tree’s match.

“Heh heh ... Indeed, pretty decent divine souls. It will definitely be very delicious! Ever since that old fart died, this Immortal Grove Region has declined with each passing day. Now, to be able to eat such tasty divine souls isn’t easy anymore!” That crow used an extremely unpleasant voice and said.

Ye Yuan was already bristling with anger at this time. How could he still listen to this crow’s muttering?

All of his strength right now was used on resisting the crow.

He wanted to save White Light and Lu-er!

The two of their divine souls were currently slowly floating toward the crows. It was as if there were paralyzing spells cast too, totally powerless to resist.

It was only to see those two crows open their mouths wide. White Light and Lu-er’s divine souls became smaller and smaller.

Finally, the two crows swallowed the two of their divine souls in one mouthful.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s gaze turned bloodshot from anger!

He wanted to make himself move a bit, but he could not do it!

He could not even muster a tiny hint of essence energy either!

The only things that he could move were his eyes!

The crow cried a burst of extremely unpleasant laughter and said to Ye Yuan, “Relax, you’ll be reunited with them right away! Don’t attempt to resist anything. What can a little fellow who can’t even break through to the Deity Realm do? Come, look into my eyes!”

An intangible force instantly assaulted Ye Yuan’s divine soul!

This time, Ye Yuan was unable to hold on anymore. A pair of eyes faced the crow’s pair of eyes!

In the next instant, Ye Yuan felt as if his divine soul was frozen, involuntarily flying out of his body.

“Haha, not bad! Really not bad! This divine soul ... seems to have the blood lineage of the dragon race. Furthermore ... it seems very similar to the dragon race’s progenitor! Could it be that legendary Atavism Dragon Soul? Hahaha, really picked up a treasure!” said the crow. The crow let out a burst of carefree but unpleasant to hear laughter.
