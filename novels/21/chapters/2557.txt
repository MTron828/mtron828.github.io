Chapter 2563: Apologize!

The goal that Ye Yuan set for Lin Lan could not be rated as not high.

From fifth grade to seventh grade, it seemed like a very narrow gap, but it was extremely difficult to cross.

The quality of heavenly pills, third grade, fifth grade, seventh grade, ninth grade, grand completion, each was a hurdler.

Furthermore, the further back, the more difficult it was!

Lin Lan could break through to the fifth grade by relying on the strength of grade two heavenly alchemist.

But further up was something that was extremely arduous.

If seventh grade was so easy to break through, then when Ye Yuan refined the seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, it would not have caused such a great sensation.

Ye Yuan was able to do it by relying on his foundation that was tempered endlessly, coupled with his extraordinary talent.

But to Lin Lan, it was the biggest test of his life.

Ever since then, Lin Lan cultivated like he had gone mad.

But the more he cultivated, the more shocked he became!

In the past, he had never attempted to spend so much energy on a basic heavenly pill before.

But now, he discovered that it was simply a heavenly chasm from fifth grade to seventh grade!

He was very perplexed how on earth Ye Yuan did it.

That person was a freak!

It was really not unjust at all that he lost so thoroughly.

However, the current Lin Lan was no longer the original Lin Lan.

After he lost that day, with all hope being dashed to pieces, he almost had the will to die.

However, things would develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme.

He finally had a grand awakening and regained his original aspirations.

He suddenly came to realize the truth, understanding that he already lost himself after so many years of being in a high position.

Hence, that was why he would put everything down and return to acknowledge master.

But, even if he regained his original aspirations, wanting to improve was also not an easy thing.

Only all the way until this moment did he know how huge the gap was from Ye Yuan!

The Dragonbone Grass that Ye Yuan extracted that day was placed next to him.

With each stalk that Lin Lan extracted, he would do a comparison.

The result was often disappointing.

This process was really incomparably devastating.

Fortunately, Lin Lan persevered.

A year later, Lin Lan’s eyes were deeply sunken, his figure emaciated and his hair disheveled. It was as if he had climbed out of the grave.

He held a heavenly pill in his heart, his throat emitting a strange?‘huhu’?laughter, clamoring about wanting to see Ye Yuan.

When Ye Yuan saw this unbelievably barely adequate Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, he could not help shaking his head and sighing.

“It’s been really hard on you! Alright, I’ll reluctantly take you in.” Ye Yuan said.

“Huhuhuhu?… Thank you, Master Ye! Disciple pays respect to Master Ye”

Amidst the strange laughter, Lin Lan kowtowed and acknowledged master. Then, he directly fell down with a deafening noise.

In the following days, Lin Lan started following Ye Yuan to cultivate.

The task that Ye Yuan gave him was very simple. It was to refine a Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to ninth grade.

As for grand completion ninth grade, Ye Yuan directly gave up on it.

Lin Lan’s natural endowments were too poor. There was no hope for grand completion at all.

Even ninth grade was also a goal that was lofty and out of reach to Lin Lan.

On this day, Second Prince suddenly came to Nation Teacher Manor in a hurry.

“Nation Teacher, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s envoy is summoning you!” Second Prince said.

“Oh??What do they want to see me for?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

Second Prince said, “A few years ago, the envoys discovered an ancient tomb in Inklight Forest. They suspect that it’s the place of slumber of a Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum powerhouse. In order to enter this place, our Eastward Country suffered casualties of countless experts these few years. Two years ago, they finally opened up the ancient tomb. Hence, the few of them brought a large group of experts and entered inside. Who knew that just three days ago, they returned. One of them is seriously injured, and one is poisoned. Envoy Cheng ordered people to invite Nation Teacher over.”

Ye Yuan was also extremely surprised when he heard it. No wonder so many years had passed, but the matter of investigating Jun Tian’s death had always been all talk no action.

It turned out that the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s people actually placed their thoughts on this.

It made sense. Although Jun Tian was all-powerful in the Heavenspan World, he was merely just a minor character who was not valued in the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

But the ancient tomb of a Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum powerhouse could contain a huge lucky chance. How could they let it go?

Above Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum was Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum!

This kind of powerhouse, even when looking at the entire True Yang Heavenly Domain, they were sovereigns of a region too.

Casually leaving behind a bit of lucky chance was enough for Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratums to benefit endlessly.

Their energy naturally had to be placed on this.

“So that’s how it is. Let’s go then! Lin Lan, you come along with me. There should be some use for you,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

… …

When Cheng Chongshan saw Lin Lan, he immediately said unhappily, “Why did you only come now? Dragging your feet, why haven’t you quickly gone in! If you can’t treat them, you know the consequences!”

As for the Ye Yuan by the side, he directly ignored him.

Lin Lan still wanted to say something but saw Ye Yuan shake his head.

He could only toughen his scalp and go in for treatment.

The emperor had his hands by the side, appearing fearful and respectful.

Clearly, the pressure that this Jadetrue Heavenly Sect gave to him was too great.

Ye Yuan and Second Prince wanted to follow in too, but they were stopped by Cheng Chongshan, “Stop! This place isn’t where any random Tom, Dick, or Harry can enter! The few of you just wait here!”

Finished saying, he turned around and entered the palace.

Second Prince had an awkward look and said with a bitter smile, “Nation Teacher, the envoy didn’t know that you’re the nation teacher, so …”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a smile, “It’s okay. If Lin Lan can treat them, it saves me the trouble of taking action!”

With regards to this kind of people who had their noses in the air, Ye Yuan had seen too many of them.

Getting angry with this kind of person was pointless to him.

Boom!

Before long, a bout of cursing and swearing came from inside, as well as the sound of fighting.

“Trash! Can’t even treat this bit of injury, what do I want you for?”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he rushed in with a flash.

At this time, Cheng Chongshan just happened to smash a fist onto Lin Lan’s chest, directly smashing him flying.

Lin Lan spurted fresh blood from his mouth wildly, already seriously injured.

“Eastward Country is really a bunch of trash! You can’t even treat this bit of injury!?Humph!”?Cheng Chongshan said angrily.

Similarly a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, Lin Lan was not Cheng Chongshan’s match at all.

The disparity was too great!

“Stop!” Cheng Chongshan still wanted to attack when Ye Yuan shouted coldly.

However, Cheng Chongshan treated it as if he did not hear it at all, smacking another palm onto Lin Lan’s chest.

Cheng Chongshan turned to glare at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “A lowly ascender, who the hell do you think you are, to also dare ask this envoy to stop? Did this envoy let you come in?”

His voice had yet to fade when Cheng Chongshan turned into an afterimage and rushed towards Ye Yuan.

He was actually going to kill Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan’s eyes turned dark and his figure swayed, and he actually disappeared.

Boom! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The place where Ye Yuan was standing directly had a large hole smashed out.

But Ye Yuan already arrived beside the bed.

His hand pressed onto the vitals of one of the women, his eyes dark as he said, “I asked you to stop, are you deaf?”

Cheng Chongshan’s pupils constricted, and he said in a solemn voice, “Spatial rule, fine lad! However, I advise you to let her go. Otherwise … you’ll regret being born in this world.”

Ye Yuan completely ignored him and said coolly, “Apologize!”

Cheng Chongshan was stunned and said, “What did you say?”

Ye Yuan said, “I asked you to apologize to Lin Lan! Looks like you’re really hard of hearing!”

Cheng Chongshan laughed loudly and said, “You’re asking this envoy to apologize to a piece of trash? Who the hell do you think you are?”
