Chapter 1283: Breaking the Seal

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Li-er, sorry!”

Under the moonlight, Ye Yuan and Yue Mengli stood side by side, the words full of guilt.

According to Ye Yuan’s original plans, once he was able to break through to the Deity Realm and end the fiend calamity, he would give Yue Mengli a glorious wedding.

But now, everything went up in smoke.

Mu Lingxue sacrificed her divine soul for him, leaving just a trace of spiritual consciousness left. Ye Yuan was seriously unable to marry Li-er.

With two lifetimes, Ye Yuan discovered that he actually fell in love with two people at the same time.

Ye Yuan always thought that he could put down Mu Lingxue. But that moment when Mu Lingxue unleashed Ice Sealing Ten Thousand Miles, Ye Yuan’s entire person seemed to be siphoned empty.

Only at that moment did Ye Yuan discover that the more he suppressed them, the deeper the feelings toward Mu Lingxue.

“Don’t say sorry! If really want to say it, it should be me who says so! If not for my selfishness, maybe when you and Elder Sister Mu reunited, you’d have already walked together. Such a thing wouldn’t have happened as well! I ...”

Talking up to here, Li-er involuntarily shed tears.

She was grieving for Mu Lingxue!

These few days, Li-er was constantly washing her face with tears.

That scene of Mu Lingxue sacrificing the divine soul, she saw it clearly inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda. At that time, her heart shattered.

She did not think that Mu Lingxue would actually be so decisive!

Only at that moment did she know that Mu Lingxue’s love for Ye Yuan was not the least bit less than hers!

Only the depths of love would have such unhesitatingness.

Li-er was certain that if it was changed to her, she would likewise do so without the slightest hesitation.

But there was no if; the one crucified on the cross was Mu Lingxue!

In that instant, she suddenly felt somewhat envious of the Spirit Snow Divine King.

Because of those words, Ye Yuan would engrave it even deeper in his heart.

Ye Yuan lightly pulled Li-er into his embrace and said with a sigh, “Silly girl, don’t cry anymore! You understand my heart, Lingxue’s matters was a great blow to me. But your position in my heart isn’t inferior to Lingxue’s. It’s just that her current condition, I truly can’t deceive myself and go soaring away like a pair of birds forever.”

Sure enough, Ye Yuan’s words made Li-er stop crying. She could not bear to make Ye Yuan even more upset.

“Big Brother Yuan, don’t say anymore, I understand! Go to the Heavenspan World! You must save Elder Sister Mu! Otherwise, I’d really not have the face to live on! If ... If ... I absolutely won’t live on my own!”

Ye Yuan helped her wipe away tears and said with a smile, “There’s no if! Don’t you trust me?”

Li-er raised her head to look at Ye Yuan and nodded her head firmly.

The turbulent spatial flow was incomparably violent. If Ye Yuan brought the Vast Heaven Pagoda into it, it would be crushed into smithereens by the turbulent spatial flow!

Hence, Ye Yuan could only pass through the turbulent spatial flow alone.

Ye Yuan already separated the Vast Heaven Pagoda and Vast Heaven Stele. He would bring the Vast Heaven Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl, and pass through the World Locking Gate!

“You stay behind with White Light and cultivate in peace. Come the day when you guys break through to the Deity Realm, that will be the point where I have preliminary success in the Heavenspan World!” Ye Yuan said.

Ye Yuan was currently considered half-master. When his cultivation reached the Divine Lord Realm, the Divine Realm’s Heavenly Dao would naturally strengthen anew!

At that time, the Divine Realm’s martial artists would be able to break through to the Deity Realm anew.

“Rest assured, Big Brother Yuan, I’ll work hard on cultivating!” Li-er said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “En, your strength advances at a tremendous pace. There are already not many able to outperform you in the Divine Realm. I can naturally rest assured. Tomorrow, I’ll let Senior Skydistant out. As long as he’s around, nobody in the Divine Realm can overturn the heavens. When my strength is sufficient, I’ll return to see you.”

...

But when Ye Yuan appeared in front of Skydistant again, it gave Skydistant a fright.

He used an expression like he had seen a ghost to look at Ye Yuan and said in incredible shock, “You ... You actually broke through to the Deity Realm? This ... This is impossible! Heavenly Dao is missing, how did you break through to the Deity Realm?”

He did not believe this kind of bizarre thing. But that powerful aura of Ye Yuan, even he quivered endlessly.

This could not fool anyone!

Ye Yuan did not reply to his question but said with a scoff, “Huhu, Senior Skydistant has been suppressed by Zuo Zong for as long as a million years, seems like you’re not anxious to get out at all?”

Skydistant froze again and said, “Go out? Don’t joke around! Don’t tell me that you’re here to let me out?”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “That’s how it is.”

Skydistant said crossly, “Brat, you aren’t here to specially make fun of me after breaking through to the Deity Realm, right? Even if you broke through to the Deity Realm, you’re also just initial-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm. How can this bit of strength possibly let me out? This joke isn’t funny at all!”

Ye Yuan smiled without saying a word. Reaching his hand out towards the void a bit, the entire Bloodrain Wilderness started trembling violently.

The demonic beasts and medicine spirits were all in a tizzy, not knowing what was happening.

Boom!

An afterimage shattered the fetters of space, leaping straight out from the depths of the seventh level.

A burly man appeared in front of Ye Yuan. Who could it be if not Skydistant?

It was just that shock was written all over Skydistant’s face.

Ye Yuan’s casual move broke Zuo Zong’s seal. This ... how is this possible?

It turned out that Ye Yuan was really not here to make fun of him, but to really let him out!

“Congratulations to Your Excellency for seeing the light of day again!”

Zuo Zong’s seal being broken by Ye Yuan with a finger, the current Bloodrain Wilderness was consolidated into an enormous medicine garden by Ye Yuan with a great divine ability.

When the original sixth level’s three great kings saw Skydistant appear, they all came forward to congratulate.

Skydistant waved his hand impatiently. Staring fixedly at Ye Yuan, he said, “Boy, what on earth is going on? Even if Absolute Heaven reincarnates, it’s also impossible to break the seal that Zuo Zong laid down so easily. How did you do it?”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Under the Heavenly Dao, what does Zuo Zong count for?”

Skydistant’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan like he had seen a ghost.

He was too shocked just now, his brain short-circuiting for a moment, and did not come back to his senses. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Thinking back now, that finger of Ye Yuan’s earlier was incomparably profound. He could not fathom it at all.

That ... was the aura of Heavenly Dao!

Heavenly Dao was actually being used by Ye Yuan?

Skydistant was instantly thrown into confusion.

This kind of thing could not be understood at all.

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of keeping him in suspense, briefly recounting the events that happened these few years, including the matter of the Great Dao pill refinement and exterminating the fiend race.

Skydistant’s brain that had just recovered a little fell into a short-circuit once more.

The three great kings were similarly like so!

They exchanged glances, their faces full of disbelief.

Recalling when Ye Yuan entered the Bloodrain Wilderness back then, he was just an ant-like existence in their eyes.

In just a few year’s time, he actually became the master that towered above all life?

This kind of feeling was completely like having a dream!

“Y-Y-You, you’re saying that Heavenly Fiendgod Kanuo and Yue Ji are already suppressed by you, and about to be executed right away?” Skydistant said.

Mentioning Kanuo, the killing intent in Ye Yuan’s body involuntarily spread out.

Including Skydistant, everyone’s heart shuddered.

Just a surge of aura was actually so terrifying!

This was the strength of the controller!
