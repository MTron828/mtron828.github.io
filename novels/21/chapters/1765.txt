Chapter 1769 White Light“s News

Obtaining Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s inheritance, Ye Yuan’s attainments in demon divine pills could be said to have advanced at a tremendous pace.

This legacy was too valuable to Ye Yuan.

After several years, Ye Yuan’s attainments in demon divine pills finally reached the pinnacle.

At the same time, his Alchemy Dao strength also had a significant improvement.

In this period, the temple gathered some level eight and nine difficulty spirit medicines. Ye Yuan took action and refined them.

Furthermore, the demon divine pills he made, the lowest was also divine-grade.

The Priest Temple’s upper echelons were naturally extremely shocked by this, especially Di Qiu. Back then, he did not believe that Ye Yuan could create much value for them within 300 years at all.

But now, he finally knew that he was ridiculously wrong.

On this day, Di Qiu came to find Ye Yuan and apologized when he opened his mouth.

“Haha, Ye Yuan, this hall master apologizes to you about what happened that day! You fulfilled your promise. Looking at it now, it was my temple that earned big from you,” Di Qiu laughed loudly and said.

Di Qiu’s personality was frank and straightforward. Admitting his fault, he did not have the slightest hesitation either.

With his identity, being able to do this was truly not easy.

Even though he wanted to kill Ye Yuan that day, Ye Yuan could also understand Di Qiu’s thoughts.

After all, he still had human blood flowing in his body.

To an alchemist who had never come into contact with demon divine pills before, 300 year’s time was indeed not long.

Hence, he smiled and said, “Hall Master doesn’t have to be like this. This Ye knows that the request that day was indeed somewhat brusque.”

Di Qiu chortled and said, “Fine lad, I knew that you weren’t a petty person! Giving a plum in return for a peach, coming to you today, I actually have some news about the matter you entrusted to me.”

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled and he said with a worried look, “Is ... Is he okay?”

But Di Qiu’s brows furrowed together, making Ye Yuan’s heart abruptly twitch.

“Okay or not, I can’t say either. But ... the odds are likely against him rather than in his favor.” Di Qiu said.

Ye Yuan’s complexion turned deathly pale. Di Qiu did not leave him hanging either, recounting the entire sequence of events.

Although finding someone was like searching for a needle in a haystack, even in the Demon Divine Region, pure white tiger bloodline was extremely rare too.

The Priest Temple was indeed well-deserving of being one of the demon race’s most colossal forces. Through the news given by Ye Yuan, they finally found White Light’s news within a few years.

It turned out that White Light had been living in Tiger Bright Imperial City all along these few years.

Tiger Bright Imperial City could be said to be the gathering ground of the tiger clan. There were many tiger clan powerhouses in the city.

The White Tiger Clan’s bloodline was similarly extremely noble in the Heavenspan World.

So after coming to the Heavenspan World, White Light’s cultivation speed was actually not slow.

It was just that compared to Ye Yuan, it was still much slower.

But arriving at the demon race, and arriving at Tiger Bright Imperial City, he relied on his bloodline talent and strength and became an indispensable young powerhouse of Tiger Bright Imperial City.

However, Tiger Bright Imperial City was different from Tyrant Origin Imperial City.

The Skydemon Mountain Range in the vicinity of Tiger Bright Imperial City had a very strong faction. Both parties would frequently clash.

Not long ago, Tiger Bright Imperial City and that faction had another conflict again.

And White Light took part in the operation this time.

White Light teamed up with another Tiger Bright Imperial City’s young genius and beat the other party’s leader to heavy injuries and on the verge of death.

No one could have expected that this leader who was injured was actually the son of that faction’s chieftain, Heavenly Tiger King.

With this, a big hole was poked in the basket.

The Heavenly Tiger King was enraged and sent out all of the fierce beasts under his command, surrounding Tiger Bright Imperial City until not even water could seep through.

Yet, this Heavenly Tiger King’s strength was stronger than Tiger Bright Imperial City’s city lord.

After both parties exchanged blows, Heavenly Tiger King injured the city lord and threatened that if they did not hand over the culprit, he would directly slaughter the city.

Hence, White Light took the initiative to step up.

Heavenly Tiger King took White Light away, that was how the beast tide retreated.

Di Qiu let out a sigh and said, “Speaking of which, the two of you brothers are loyal people. Actually, the one who took action and injured the Heavenly Tiger King’s son wasn’t White Light. But he and Blackpupil are good brothers, so he took the initiative to step forward, bearing the blame on Blackpupil’s behalf.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he asked, “How long ago was this?”

Di Qiu said, “This was just a few months ago. But ... I’ve heard before that Heavenly Tiger King’s name. He’s very savage and cruel. If he didn’t have some scruples, he might have really slaughtered the city. That brother of yours, White Light, is fraught with grim possibilities!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Yuan’s expression changed and he said to Di Qiu with clasped hands, “Hall Master, this matter brooks no delay. I’ll set off now and head for Tiger Bright Imperial City!”

Di Qiu did not stop either and said, “There are transmission arrays between Priest Temples. You can go over through the transmission array.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said with clasped hands, “In that case, thank you very much, Lord Hall Master!”

Imperial cities were mostly independent. Under normal circumstances, there were no transmission arrays.

Just like the relationship between Heavenly Eagle Imperial City and Utmost Peace Imperial City back then, if there was a transmission array, that would be equivalent to self-destruction.

But the demon race’s priest temples spanned all over each imperial city. It was still permitted for them to set up some small-scale transmission arrays internally.

Of course, this transmission array naturally had strict rules for usage too. People apart from the Priest Temple were absolutely not allowed to use it.

...

Passing through the transmission array, what was supposed to be a several years’ journey, Ye Yuan only used half a month’s time and reached Tiger Bright Imperial City.

“Ye Yuan pays respect to Hall Master Jin Hua!”

Coming out of the transmission array, a man dressed in hall master long robes came up to welcome.

Ye Yuan naturally knew it in his heart and bowed to him.

Although Di Qiu did not say that Ye Yuan cleared ‘Ask Not,’ the words in the message he transmitted to him expressed Ye Yuan’s extraordinariness.

Jin Hua was not a fool, he naturally understood what it meant.

Hence, he personally came to welcome Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was unfamiliar with this place. His greatest reliance was the Priest Temple and naturally had to be more courteous to Jin Hua.

When Jin Hua saw Ye Yuan, he could not help slightly revealing a look of surprise. Nodding his head, he said, “You’re Little Friend Ye Yuan? I heard that your talent is outstanding and can already refine level eight and nine demon divine pills?”

Ye Yuan understood in his heart and said with a nod, “That is kind praise from Hall Master Di Qiu. If Hall Master Jin Hua needs this Ye to put forth my strength, this Ye will naturally carry out my obligations!”

Jin Hua smiled, very satisfied with Ye Yuan’s behavior.

Clearly, talking with smart people was very easy.

However, he was also secretly shocked in his heart.

He even thought that Ye Yuan was a peak rank four powerhouse. He did not expect that Ye Yuan was only a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord.

Could this bit of strength really refine the Cloud Pendant Heavenly Sunbow Pill?

Di Qiu seemed crude and careless, but he naturally also would not be as simple as he portrayed.

Even though the relationship between priest temples was much closer than between imperial cities, asking people for help naturally had to promise some benefits.

And Ye Yuan was the biggest benefit.

He already hinted in the news he sent over that he could have Ye Yuan refine some level nine difficulty medicinal pills.

“Huhu, then I’ll have to trouble Little Friend Ye Yuan. I heard Di Qiu say that you and White Light are life-and-death brothers?” Jin Hua asked casually.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “We’re good brothers that have braved countless dangers! Lord Hall Master, I heard that he also has a good brother in Tiger Bright Imperial City, Blackpupil. I wonder if you can tell me about this person?”
