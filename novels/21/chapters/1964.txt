Chapter 1968: Battle Spirits

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan’s heart went slightly cold. This should be the Jian Family’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

The Jian Family was really too powerful, to actually use a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse to garrison the Ancient God Battlefield.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets had lived for far too long. His descendants had also similarly lived for far too long.

With his good luck, the Jian Family’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were likely not a few.

This family clan was too terrifying.

Ye Yuan even had a feeling that the Jian Family might be the Heavenspan World’s number one major family clan.

As Ye Yuan was lost in thought, that voice continued to echo faintly, shocking the mind.

“The place that you all are standing at was hewed open by Ancestor Profound Secrets with a great divine ability. It’s the only safe place in this Ancient God Battlefield. Those two people’s great battle earlier was also not an illusion ...”

This Heavenly Emperor’s words poured out easily and fluently, talking tirelessly about this Ancient God Battlefield’s perils.

It turned out that inside this Ancient God Battlefield, there had once been countless powerhouses that perished.

Before those powerhouses died, the unwillingness in their chest cut across the long river of history, and would occasionally trigger heaven and earth spiritual energy, playing out the image when they were alive, having a great battle with their opponents again.

Those two figures earlier were the battle scene of two Heavenly Emperor powerhouses when they were alive.

Although this battle was not as earth-shaking as when they were alive, it could similarly stir up powerful spiritual energy undulations.

Those energy undulations were all real!

Once swept by these spiritual energies, one would not even know how they died.

The moment Ye Yuan entered, he felt that there was a mysterious energy undulation all around, like a barrier.

Hence, when those two powerhouses were fighting, he did not move.

He believed that those people who did not move were the same as him. They felt this undulation.

Those people’s comprehensions of Heavenly Dao were extremely deep. All of them were going to be troublesome for him.

Ye Yuan already secretly remembered these people’s faces. When he ran into them again, he would need to be careful.

Of course, there was also that Liu Yi.

Hearing this Heavenly Emperor powerhouse’s words, each and every one of them, their expressions were all rather ugly.

This ancient god battlefield was too dangerous!

“Now, you all can start to seek out lucky chances on your own. You can move collectively and can also work alone. Of course, this emperor advises you all to take action collectively. This way, the chances of seizing treasures will be a little higher. You all have three years’ time. After three years, this barrier will disappear, and you all will stay in this place for as long as ten thousand years. However, if you’re afraid, you can also keep staying inside this shield, all the way until the passageway closes.”

Finished saying, that voice disappeared. It was as if it had never appeared before.

These children of destiny began forming cliques.

Of course, these people came from different great imperial capitals. The majority formed alliances with the great imperial capitals as the unit of measurement.

Song Yu recovered to that boundless enthusiastic appearance and opened his mouth and said, “Everybody, are you all planning on moving alone, or are you going together with me? But I’ll say it first. If it’s together, you have to listen to my orders. If anyone is half-hearted when the time comes, I’ll kill him without the slightest mercy!”

Song Yu’s gaze swept over with a grave look.

He naturally had the qualifications to say so. Having a Third Firmament True God’s strength, even in Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, it was also considered head and shoulders above others. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Heh, who the hell do you think you are? I’m also a child of destiny, why should I follow you? Farewell!”

“No need, I plan to work alone!”

...

Right at this time, a series of arguing sounds came over from not far away.

Clearly, these people did not want to move with the majority of the force but wanted to work alone.

Although moving alone was dangerous, the lucky chances obtained were all theirs.

If there were a lot of people, a bout of snatching could not be avoided when the time comes. Whose hands it would end up in was still unknown.

It could say that each path had its own pros and cons.

Those who came here were all children of destiny, each and every one of them were all from imperial capitals or great imperial capitals’ pillars of society. How could they be willing to be below others?

Hence, some people directly bade farewell and left.

This shield’s radius was not large. Those few people went out of the circle very soon.

With several people taking the lead, more and more people planned on working alone.

The few figures gradually moved further away. All of a sudden, the situation changed drastically.

Outside the circle, one illusory figure after another condensed.

The surging killing intent almost turned corporeal, directly passing through the barrier, making people palpitating with anxiety and fear.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

...

Outside the circle, battle cries shook the heavens. Those few children of destiny that went out first were surrounded very quickly.

Everyone’s faces changed, looking at this scene in terror.

“These ... These are the battle spirits that the emperor earlier mentioned?”

Earlier, that Heavenly Emperor powerhouse said before that there were battle spirits everywhere in the Ancient God Battlefield.

The strength of the battle spirits varied from the Celestial Deity Realm to the Empyrean Realm.

These battle spirits were condensed and formed from the divine soul fragments of those powerhouses from countless years ago.

The Ancient God Battlefield’s environment was very special. Those powerhouses’ divine soul fragments were unable to enter samsara and could only drift between heaven and earth, finally forming into a new spirit body.

Through so many years of development, their strength already became very terrifying.

Powerful battle spirits could even reach the Empyrean Realm.

However, this kind of battle spirit was very, very few.

Currently, those battle spirits outside were mostly Celestial Deity Realm.

The important thing was that these battle spirits were too numerous!

Those few children of destiny were not weak. Most of them had a Second Firmament True God’s strength.

Otherwise, they also would not dare to go out themselves.

They were very strong, but they could not fend off the numerous battle spirits.

Suddenly, someone cried out in surprise, “Not good! There are True God Realm existences among these battle spirits!”

Sure enough, those few children of destiny all encountered their opponents and were tied down by True God Realm battle spirits very soon.

These battle spirits were all extremely ferocious and did not fear death at all.

With the entanglement of True God Realm battle spirits, those Celestial Deity Realm battle spirits could play a role.

Even if their attacks only caused a tiny bit of damage, when accumulated, it was also very terrifying.

In the end, under the watchful gazes of everyone, those few children of destiny were actually dismembered by those battle spirits with a flurry of blades.

Within the circle, those children of destiny were all ashen, being frightened by this scene.

The battle spirits’ murderous air was extremely heavy as if they only knew slaughter. They were being completely unreasonable!

Those children of destiny who planned on acting alone quietly turned back.

This scene let them deeply experience the danger of this Ancient God Battlefield.

But Song Yu laughed coldly and said, “How is it? Does anyone still want to move alone now? You can go, I won’t stop you guys.”

The others did not make a sound anymore.

After ruminating for a moment, Guo Jingyang opened his mouth and said, “I’ll join!”

“I’ll join too!”

...

They were not fools, being under others was better than losing their lives.

Song Yu chuckled and said, “You guys want to join, also can. But we have to come to an agreement beforehand, the treasures obtained, I want 50% all to myself!”

When everyone heard that, their faces could not help changing.

Guo Jingyang frowned and said, “Song Yu, you’re also too greedy, right?”

But Song Yu smiled faintly and said, “Greedy? Just now, I advised you all to join, you all harbored ulterior motives. Now, seeing the danger, you want to seek my protection. How can there be such a good thing in this world?”
