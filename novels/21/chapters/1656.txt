Chapter 1660 Starry Sky Treasure Selection

Finally, the fights became fewer and more sparse. The spirit circles each fell under someone’s ownership.

But those who obtained spirit circles, most of them were third-layered heaven Divine Lords and second-layered heaven Divine Lords. The number of first-layered heaven Divine Lords were very few.

After Jing Lu was frightened away by Ye Yuan, he also found a sucker and forcefully occupied a spirit circle.

A hundred breaths of time passed, one spirit circle after another emitted traces of dense mist.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan felt that a wisp of his divine sense involuntarily broke free of his body, flying toward the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh ...

Rays of light broke free, flying into the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Those martial artists who failed to snatch the spirit circles could only see these people enter to search for treasures off with their eyes with envious looks.

Ye Yuan only felt a blur before his eyes and he entered a vast starry sky.

“Is this the legendary Suppression Ancient Starry Sky? Indeed magical!”

“Each star represents a treasure! The brighter the star, it means the more powerful the treasure!”

“Still waiting for what, come on!”

...

Treasure in front, the martial artists all lost composure, taking action one after another, flying over toward those stars.

Those slightly darker stars, they did not take fancy on them. They were all aiming for those brightest few stars.

It was just that they flew halfway and their figures were unable to advance an inch anymore.

“Heh heh, really overestimating their own abilities! How can truly powerful inheritances be what the average person can obtain?” Dustless said disdainfully.

The Soul Suppressing Pearl was integrated inside Ye Yuan’s divine sense and was also brought inside.

Ye Yuan said, “Wonder to which step I can walk to!”

Dustless stroked his beard and said, “Huhu, with this old man around, you’ll naturally get the best!”

Ye Yuan could not help smiling when he heard it.

It was said that this inheritance was left behind by a True God powerhouse, but the Soul Suppressing Pearl was a peak empyrean spirit treasure. Dustless did not take it seriously at all.

“The means of True God powerhouses are indeed inconceivable, to actually be able to create such a region of consciousness space! It’s just that no idea what the strongest inheritance here is?” Ye Yuan said.

“The strongest inheritance is naturally not here, but in the depths of the starry sky!” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan smiled at Ning Tianping and said, “Tianping, let us go and join in the fun too.”

“Heh heh, alright! I also want to see where my potential lies!” Ning Tianping said with a smile.

Finished talking, the two people leaped and headed over toward the vast starry sky.

“Damn it, just a little bit more, move for me!”

A second-layered heaven Divine Lord martial artist struggled until his face reddened to the ears, but his body was unable to advance an inch.

But he was only several hundred feet away from a very dazzling star.

Right at this time, two figures lightly walked by him, incomparably relaxedly, forming a fierce contrast with him.

Ning Tianping saw that that star was very bright and could not resist reaching out to fish it over.

That martial artist glared and roared furiously, “That’s mine! You’re not allowed to snatch!”

Ning Tianping said with an amused look, “Is your name written on it?”

That person could not help choking when he heard it, but he was fiercely unwilling to submit in his heart.

Comparing people, it was really odious!

This region of starry sky, the deeper in, the higher one’s talent naturally was.

He already used all of his strength to arrive here, but it now seemed like a joke.

Ning Tianping carefully sensed it a bit, but his brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Your Excellency, this is a Divine Dao rank five cultivation method, it seems to be pretty good.”

That martial artist’s entire body trembled, the unwillingness in his eyes even stronger.

Who knew that Ye Yuan said coolly, “Just a Divine Dao rank five cultivation method. Can only bring one thing out from here, throw it away.”

“Oh!” Ning Tianping casually threw it very obediently. That star returned to its original spot.

That martial artist was utterly stunned by these two people’s conversation. This was also too casual, right?

That originally thick unwillingness turned into astoundment at this time.

Divine Dao rank five cultivation method, they did not even take fancy on it?

One had to know, Divine Dao rank five cultivation methods were easily the price of one or two billion!

That martial artist had tears coursing down his face, thinking to himself, you guys shouldn’t toy with people like this, might as well directly take it away.

This was also too hurtful, right?

Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping did not stop at all, directly leaving.

While that martial artist was still desperately crawling forward, hoping to be able to reach that Divine Dao rank five cultivation method.

It was just that no matter how hard he strove, he was always lacking that little bit.

Several hundred martial artists, everyone had their own goals. But those able to reach rank five cultivation methods were originally already scanty few.

As for even deeper, they were unable to arrive there at all.

“Hahaha ... peak rank five cultivation method, Crimsonlight Nine Brilliance Divine Art! With this cultivation method, I can cultivate all the way to the peak of the Celestial Deity Realm!”

In the starry sky, a voice suddenly sounded out loud, seemingly very excited.

Not far away, some martial artists cast envious gazes.

“Indeed worthy of being a genius known to definitely step into Celestial Deity Realm, to actually be able to obtain a peak rank five cultivation method!”

“Sigh, the disparity between anyone is too great!”

“Barring no accidents, the cultivation method that Jing Lu obtained will probably be the best this time, right?”

...

Hearing the sighs of admiration coming from everyone, Jing Lu was extremely pleased with himself.

Because in this starry sky, he walked right at the forefront.

Clearly, his talent was the greatest!

Melody Sun Imperial City’s apex cultivation method could only cultivate to the third-layered heaven Celestial Deity Realm.

Therefore, without a special fortuitous encounter, Jing Lu’s final realm would stop here too.

But now, it was different!

This set of Crimson Light Nine Brilliance Divine Art was sufficient to support him to cultivate to the peak ninth-layered heaven Celestial Deity, only a step away from the True God Realm!

Jing Lu believed that with his talent, he could absolutely cultivate to the ninth-layered heaven Celestial Deity Realm.

Right at this time, two figures came over, seemingly very relaxed.

Amidst everyone’s amazed stare, Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping strolled over leisurely and arrived beside Jing Lu very quickly.

Ning Tianping gave Jing Lu a glance and said disdainfully, “A mere Divine Dao rank five cultivation method, look how excited it made you. Useless!”

Toward Jing Lu, Ning Tianping did not want to have any favorable impression.

Seeing him show off, he could not resist giving him a blow.

When Jing Lu saw these two people, the joy from a moment ago immediately disappeared in a flash.

Looking at the two people’s appearance, it seemed like they still had the strength to spare.

While he was already powerless to move forward.

“Humph! What are you showing off for? The further in front, the greater the resistance! I don’t believe that you guys can still advance much!” Jing Lu said with a cold smile.

“Oh? Is that so? Then let’s wait and see!” Ning Tianping said with a sneer.

Ye Yuan shot Jing Lu a glance lightly and said, “Come on. Just a frog at the bottom of a well, no need to care about him.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought Ning Tianping and continued forward, leaving behind the black-faced Jing Lu.

Sure enough, the resistance in front became greater and greater. Before long, Ning Tianping was unable to advance anymore.

The tremendous resistance made it hard for him to take a single step.

“Your Excellency, I ... I can’t move any more!” Ning Tianping said.

However, he did not have the intention of being unreconciled to it.

Ning Tianping knew that for him to be able to walk until here was entirely His Excellency’s credit.

With his original talent, he was probably not even as good as Jing Lu.

Ye Yuan glanced around and said with a nod, “Alright, you stay here, I’ll go further and take a look.”
