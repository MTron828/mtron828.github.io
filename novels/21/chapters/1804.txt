1808 Not One Who Appreciate Goods

The finger of a True God Realm, even a casual finger, was also extremely horrifying.

Ye Yuan just felt that the surrounding space was completely locked down. He was unable to mobilize spatial law at all.

True God Realm powerhouses, even if they did not know spatial law, their application of spatial law already reached a level where it makes one’s hair stand on end too.

This was completely the crushing of realm!

And this finger directly ignored the Baili Qingyan in front of Ye Yuan, falling straight onto Ye Yuan.

“Ye Yuan!”

When Baili Qingyan saw this scene, she could not help turning pale with fright.

When she learned the news that Ye Yuan was not dead, she had no idea how happy in her heart.

But now, they had just reunited and were going to become separated by death?

She was unwilling!

Qian Ye and the rest all had gloating faces. This damn guy was finally going to die this time, right?

But right then, a layer of ripple suddenly emerged in the space in front of Ye Yuan.

A rusty ax poked out of the void.

That finger dissipated into thin air.

That True God Realm powerhouse’s gaze turned sullen, and he said in a cold voice, “Lumberjack, you’re not chopping wood on your Tianying Peak. What did you run to my Heavenly Bud Peak for?”

While talking, a woodcutter in shabby clothes walked out of the void and said with a chuckle, “This place isn’t Tianying Peak, but Ye Yuan is my Tianying Peak’s member. Jiang Hong, you want to kill my Tianying Peak’s people, how can I take it as I didn’t see it?”

Jiang Hong’s face fell and he said, “He violated the sect rules and deserves to be executed!”

That woodcutter rolled his sleeves up and also rolled his trousers up. Hemp garment and sackcloths, he did not look like an expert at all.

But that attack earlier, it was still vivid in everyone’s mind.

This person was absolutely a powerhouse on the same level as Jiang Hong!

Hearing Jiang Hong’s words, the woodcutter chortled and said, “Sect rules? Huhu, are my Shadowmoon Sect’s rules to let disciples with talent die with hatred?”

Jiang Hong’s face fell and he said, “Lumberjack, watch your identity! Pay attention to your words!”

But the woodcutter was indifferent. Waving his hand grandly, he said, “Don’t talk about whatever identity with this father of yours. I am a woodcutter! If you want to kill my Tianying Peak’s people, ask the ax in my hand first!”

Jiang Hong snorted coldly and said, “Boorish people can’t be reasoned with! No matter what, that kid must die today! Otherwise, where will my Heavenly Bud Peak’s face go?”

The woodcutter completely ignored Jiang Hong’s threat and said with a laugh, “Didn’t Ye Yuan look for that kid called Qian Ye to cross swords? Young people’s matter, let them settle it themselves. Us old fellow shouldn’t get involved.”

The woodcutter’s words made everyone’s faces change.

Was this coming to save Ye Yuan or coming to make Ye Yuan seek his doom?

Having Ye Yuan face-off with a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse, wasn’t this courting death?

Jiang Hong snorted coldly and said, “Since you want to make him seek his doom, I’m naturally not stopping it! Qian Ye, I’ll leave him to you!”

Qian Ye’s expression flickered waveringly and he gritted his teeth and said, “Yes, Elder Jiang Hong!”

Jiang Hong gave Qian Ye a glance rather surprisedly and started becoming uncertain in his heart.

This Qian Ye seemed to be somewhat lacking in confidence against Ye Yuan!

Could it be that there was really something fishing about this Ye Yuan?

But he did not say much either. Questioning Qian Ye at this time was clearly not some wise action.

At this point, everyone naturally had some surmises about these two mighty True God powerhouses’ identities.

Nine great sub-peaks’ skill-imparting elders normally came and went like shadows.

But the matter today was stirred up so big, it clearly alarmed these two great skill-imparting elders!

This Tianying Peak skill-imparting elder of the nine great sub-peaks was the most mysterious.

Because, concerning Tianying Peak’s matters, he had never cared about it before.

No one could have thought that today, for Ye Yuan, he actually revealed his true self.

Everyone similarly also did not expect that Tianying Peak’s skill-imparting elder was actually a woodcutter!

Even Jiang Hong clearly looked down on this woodcutter, feeling that he was too boorish.

In reality, if not for neutralizing Jiang Hong’s skill previously, no one could think that this woodcutter in front of them was actually a True God Realm powerhouse.

This guy was too ordinary!

Ordinary until when dropped into a pile of people, it was impossible for anyone to recognize him.

But Ye Yuan saw power from this woodcutter!

That Jiang Hong was clearly very wary toward the woodcutter.

At this time, the woodcutter suddenly turned his head and looked at Ye Yuan cheerfully. There was completely no difference from those lumberjacks chopping wood in the mountains. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This kind of woodcutter gave people an extremely absurd misconception, making people truly unable to regard him as an expert.

Ye Yuan looked at the woodcutter, incomparably shocked in his heart.

This kind of feeling was absolutely not because the woodcutter was too ordinary, but because he was too unordinary.

This was a boundary of returning to one’s original simplicity, a realm that most people could not imagine!

“Heh heh, kid, don’t lose face for our Tianying Peak! Pummel him fiercely for me!” The woodcutter said to Ye Yuan gaily.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, “Many thanks to Elder for taking action. Ye Yuan won’t bring shame upon you!”

The woodcutter patted Ye Yuan’s shoulder and said with a smile, “From that moment you, kid, stepped onto Tianying Peak, I already noticed you. That bunch of fools only know how to form factions, not one who appreciates goods! Powerhouses ultimately need themselves to be powerful! No matter how strong one’s faction is, that’s also not theirs! Exhibit your talent and let those fools regret away!”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted slightly. He did not expect that the woodcutter had actually paid attention to him so long ago.

It seemed like he was well aware of each and every one of Ye Yuan’s actions.

Hence, that was why he would be so confident in him.

Furthermore, the words that the woodcutter said happened to coincide with Ye Yuan’s views.

A faction being powerful indeed had many conveniences but also had many shortcomings.

To really talk about who was better and who was worse off, it was hard to say.

But there was one thing, martial artists ultimately still had to rely on themselves.

There would always come a day when others could not be trusted.

...

Stepping into the ring, Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, unmoving like a pine tree.

Qian Ye smiled coldly and said, “Foolish fellow, you think that by breaking through to become Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, you can deal with Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses? I’ll tell you today, how great the disparity between the Divine Lord Realm and the Celestial Deity Realms are!”

The present Qian Ye was already not that Qian Ye back then.

Although he did not break through to become a Second Firmament Celestial Deity, his strength was much stronger compared to 200 years ago.

Even though Qian Ye’s talent could not compare to Baili Qingyan, this kind of freak, but it was also absolutely not what any random Tom, Dick, and Harry could compare to.

In reality, this generation’s representative figure of Heavenly Bud Peak was him.

Hence, Ye Yuan’s behavior was undoubtedly like a moth flying into the fire in everyone’s view.

Even if the woodcutter seemed to feel very optimistic about Ye Yuan.

The difference between the Celestial Deity Realm and the Divine Lord Realm was known to everyone. Even for a genius like Baili Qingyan, it was also impossible to jump realms and battle.

Forget about a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord; even if Baili Qingyan was a half-step Celestial Deity, she could not do it too!

Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses, their inner worlds already started to give birth to myriad life. Their world power was more than a hundred times of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses.

Coupled with the horrifying divine essence reserves, even if it was a casual strike, it was also not what Divine Lord Realm martial artists could resist.

On what basis could Ye Yuan win?
