Chapter 2538: Tang Yu’s Choice!

“Y-You’re really a freak!” Gu Mao said with a black face.

What else could he say to a guy like Ye Yuan who shattered understanding?

Instinct, this word, was simple to say. But doing it was harder than ascending to heaven!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had so many ascenders every day. But they had never heard of anyone who could cultivate pill refinement into instinct!

But Ye Yuan broke the curse of affinity!

Ye Yuan did not have much self-awareness. This was just a matter-of-course thing to him.

His persistence toward Alchemy Dao, only he himself knew.

He had created too many miracles on the path of alchemy! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

No affinity, so what?

As long as he was still alive, no one could stop him from refining pills!

Heaven could not too!

“Since Second Prince has borne witness, one must be willing to lose if they bet!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The corners of Gu Mao’s mouth twitched, very reluctant.

Each alchemist had their own knack in certain areas, he was naturally unwilling to share it with others.

But at this time, Second Prince suddenly said, “Alchemy Dao legacies aren’t short work. Master Ye, this prince still has something to ask you.”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed and he said with a cold smile, “You ask and I have to answer?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed suddenly.

Too arrogant!

Who he was facing was Second Prince, His Highness!

Actually, not that Ye Yuan was arrogant, but that he discerned that this clearly had the intention of speaking in support!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan knew what Second Prince was going to ask, so he could not be bothered to elaborate even more.

“Ye Yuan! W-What have I, Tang Yu, done wrong, for you to harm my Tang Family like this!” Tang Yu’s expression changed abruptly as he said.

While the others revealed gloating smiles after being shocked.

Especially Gu Mao, he did not expect that Ye Yuan was so rash, to actually refute Second Prince, His Highness, to his face!

Ye Yuan gave Tang Yu a glance, and he said with a nonchalant smile, “In that case, your Tang Family is going to help Gu Mao?”

Tang Yu’s entire body trembled, his face revealing a look of struggle.

He was a clever man. How could he not discern the current situation?

Just now, with Second Prince opening his mouth, it was clearly showing partiality for Gu Mao.

Although the talent that Ye Yuan exhibited was amazing, wanting to truly become a heavenly alchemist, no idea how long it would still have to take.

Furthermore, becoming a heavenly alchemist was one thing, reaching Gu Mao’s realm was another.

A ready-made master and a guy with an unknown background.

Furthermore, Second Prince was currently still relying on Gu Mao a lot.

Weighing which was more important, Second Prince was naturally clear in his heart.

At this time, Second Prince’s gaze also turned cold and he said with a cold smile,?“Huhu,?in this Eastward Country, it’s still the first time that someone dares to contradict this prince defiantly! Very good! Tang Jinhua, is your Tang Family choosing this prince, or are you breaking away from this prince?”

Tang Jinhua’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He realized that the moment to decide the Tang Family’s fate had arrived.

Logically speaking, he should stand on the Second Prince’s side without the slightest hesitation at this time.

After all, behind the Second Prince was the royal family.

For the Tang Family to be able to have today, it was also because they served the Second Prince.

But Tang Jinhua saw Tang Yu hesitate!

When Second Prince saw that this father and son pair actually remained silent, he sneered and said, “Looks like in your Tang Family’s eyes, this prince isn’t even as good as this ascender! Forget it …”

Tang Jinhua’s expression changed wildly, and he could not care about Tang Yu’s attitude and was about to make known his position.

He hurriedly said, “Second Prince, Your Highness, our Tang Family …”

“Gu Mao! One must be willing to lose if they bet! Are you going to go back on your word?” Suddenly, Tang Yu opened his mouth and forcibly interrupted Tang Jinhua who was clarifying where he stood.

When the words came out, everyone was shocked!

Each and every one of the family heads and heavenly alchemists present was all dumbfounded.

This was a choice that completely did not require brainpower, but Tang Yu made the opposite decision!

Was Tang Yu’s brain broken?

Even Second Prince was also dumbfounded.

Earlier, Tang Jinhua had clearly already made up his mind to stand on his side.

But in a blink, it was actually changed by Tang Yu!

While Ye Yuan smiled, thinking to himself that this Tang Yu was indeed a clever man.

Second Prince had the ability to destroy the Tang Family. He, Ye Yuan, also had it

Tang Yu’s gaze gradually became cold, and he said in a solemn voice, “Gu Mao, this young master is talking to you. Didn’t you hear it? Either concede defeat, or you’re going out lying down today!”

Second Prince shot to his feet, gaze fixed on Tang Yu and he said with a cold smile, “Good! Very good! Tang Yu, looks like this prince underestimated you! The Tang Family, this dog, is actually going to bite its master today? But don’t you forget! This prince can support you all, but this prince can also destroy you all!”

The corners of Tang Yu’s mouth twitched slightly, but he still said boldly, “Second Prince, you also know that our Tang Family is a dog! How much have we done for you in secret over the years? To really talk about it, what we paid was far more than what we obtained!”

These words were said by Tang Yu from the bottom of his heart.

In Second Prince’s eyes, the Tang Family was merely a dog at his beck and call.

If the dog was hungry, he would reward a bone to eat.

But, the things that the Tang Family had done for Second Prince had indeed been countless!

Moreover, the heavenly crystals that the Tang Family’s business earned, more than half of it was paid to Second Prince in tribute.

Second Prince laughed loudly when he heard that and said,?“Hahaha?… very good! Master Gu will be protected by this prince today! This prince wants to see what right your Tang Family has to have him concede defeat! Zhao Yu, Jiang Zhu, you guys go and give it a try, whether this ‘Big Brother’ is really as powerful as in the legends or not!”

Behind Second Prince, two guards with powerful auras immediately stepped forward.

Tang Jinhua’s expression changed and he hurriedly said, “Second Prince, Your Highness, my young son he … he doesn’t know any better! Your Highness please pardon his offense!”

Second Prince sneered and said, “Too late! Is this prince’s place where you can come and go as you please? Your Tang Family shall completely disappear from the imperial city after tonight!”

Tang Jinhua had a look of despair and glared at Tang Yu.

He did not know why his son wanted to make such a decision!

Zhao Yu two people arrived in front of Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “This ‘Big Brother’, don’t disappoint us too much!”

Jiang Zhu smiled and said, “In this imperial city, when is it lower Lesser Sublime Heavens’ turn to be arrogant? Brat, to dare rebut Second Prince, His Highness, you’re really tired of living!”

Ye Yuan’s eyebrows raised slightly and he said coolly, “The two of you really have a lot of crap!”

His voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan’s aura suddenly erupted.

The pupils of the people present suddenly shrunk!

Ye Yuan’s aura actually surpassed lower Lesser Sublime Heaven in one fell swoop, and reached middle Lesser Sublime Heaven!

This guy actually concealed his strength!

“Dual Polarity Sword Formation!”

In an instant, the sword formation burst out, flying straight for Zhao Yu and Jiang Zhu two people.

Zhao Yu and Jiang Zhu were both royal guards and had experienced many battles.

Let alone that they were both upper Lesser Sublime Heaven powerhouses!

Facing this strike, they naturally did not panic in the face of danger.

Although Ye Yuan concealed his strength, they did not take him seriously.

The two people’s auras erupted, instantly suppressing Ye Yuan.

Iron Bone Astral Fist!

Tyrant Heart Slaughter Palm!

The two people executed a move each, carrying an astonishing imposing momentum and pouncing towards Ye Yuan.

Boom!

A fierce confrontation smashed the meeting hall into pieces.

Zhao Yu and Jiang Zhu two people’s figures flew out backward involuntarily, spewing a mouthful of fresh blood wildly.
