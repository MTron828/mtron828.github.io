Chapter 2793: Sudden Counterattack!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It’s also not a lot. I’ve killed people from the four great sea regions. Now, the four great sea regions’ powerhouses are all on the way to hunt me down.?Oh,?these four great sea regions’ overlords are all True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses,” Ye Yuan’s hands did not slow down as he said coolly.

“… …”

Yang Qing only felt his scalp tingle, feeling speechless.

True Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

Just now, he was still saying that he would protect Ye Yuan under True Sovereign Heaven.

But now, this fellow really provoked True Sovereign Heavens!

Who am I?

Where am I?

Aren’t I … invincible?

“Hurry up and break out of the encirclement. We won’t be able to run if we’re surrounded!”

Ye Yuan shouted loudly, Universe Sword Formation suddenly erupting, inflicting heavy wounds onto someone by trading injuries, and flying away once more.

“Wait for me!”

Yang Qing sent the two people flying with one punch and chased after Ye Yuan.

Xiao Qing was sharp too, dashing under Yang Qing’s crotch with a lunge.

“You’re still following me?” Ye Yuan said in surprise.

“They already think that I’m together with you! Little Brother, you’re a formidable figure, to actually be able to cause an uproar in four great sea regions! I feel that we’re kindred spirits!” Yang Qing said in admiration.

Ye Yuan was speechless.

Who was freaking kindred spirits with you?

However, with such a powerhouse following, it could share quite a bit of pressure, so Ye Yuan was not long-winded either.

Behind them, Whalebillow shouted loudly, “Punk who’s surnamed Ye, you can’t escape! The powerhouses of three great sea regions ahead are already all rushing over towards this side!”

This group of people had already chased Ye Yuan for three days and three nights!

Ye Yuan already killed more than ten grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses as he moved.

Among them, he had killed the war generals of four great sea regions.

It was also because of this that Ye Yuan completely triggered an uproar in the four great sea regions.

All of the four great sea regions’ powerhouses swarmed out in full force, carrying out obstructions and intercepting him.

The fights along the way were like just now.

Yang Qing just happened to run into Ye Yuan during the interval of pursuit.

What surprised Ye Yuan was that beyond the shock, Yang Qing was actually rather excited to encounter this kind of situation. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This guy’s brain had a problem, right?

As for the Whalebillow at the back, Ye Yuan directly ignored him.

“Little Brother, there’s no meaning in running like this. Why don’t we join hands and pull off a big play? How about it? Heh heh, really haven’t had such a thrilling thing for a long time!” Yang Qing actually giggled.

He had been invincible on the Yuchi Continent for too long.

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, thinking to himself that this Yang Qing’s strength was extremely formidable, fighting one-on-two with great ease.

If he joined hands with him, they could pull it off!

Continue running like this was not a solution either.

“Okay!” Ye Yuan said straightforwardly.

Yang Qing said excitedly, “How do I address Little Brother?”

“Ye Yuan!”

“Younger Brother Ye’s sword formation is very formidable. You use the sword formation to cover me. Let’s do a sudden counterattack!”

“No problem!”

Yang Qing was taken aback and said, “You trust me so much? Aren’t you scared that I sell you out?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You can’t sell me!”

Yang Qing laughed and said, “Alright, domineering enough. You have the style of me, Saint Exalt Azuresky! Kill!”

Yang Qing roared, his figure suddenly shooting backward, charging toward the crowd.

With the delay just now, both sides’ distance was already extremely near.

The moment he turned back, both sides directly fought in close quarters!

The group that was pursuing them already reached more than 30 people!

Adding in those few war general powerhouses earlier, the other sides’ transformation experts now were as many as 13 people!

This force was absolutely extremely terrifying.

Ye Yuan displayed spatial rule, his figure turning around by defying common sense, and was actually even faster than Yang Qing.

But at this time, the long spear in Yang Qing’s hand shook, an astonishing momentum rising to the sky.

At this moment, Ye Yuan felt it too. This Yang Qing was a two-laws transformation!

However, this guy perfectly fused Spear Dao and Destruction Dao together.

Before the long spear was unleashed, everyone already felt a destructive power!

And the grandmist treasure long spear in Yang Qing’s hands actually turned false and real, the imposing momentum condensing without scattering.

Clearly, Yang Qing was a super powerhouse in the spear path.

The team that was pursuing was chasing after with all their might. Clearly, they did not expect that these two people still dared to deal a sudden counterattack.

With this, they were caught off-guard!

“Tyrant’s Spear!”

Yang Qing shouted loudly, the long spear piercing through the head of the war general who was in his face like a rainbow.

Tyrant’s Spear?

Bastard’s?spear1?

Why did this guy feel so unreliable?

However, his strength was extremely strong.

“Universe Sword!”

Ye Yuan also shouted fiercely, similarly finishing off a war general powerhouse.

One exchange, two general level experts fell!

The group that was chasing them was immediately dumbfounded.

However, Whalebillow and the rest had seen before grand spectacles too, they woke up extremely quickly.

“Kill! Don’t let these two punks run! Must kill them!” Whalebillow growled.

There was no need for him to instruct them. There were already countless attacks that smashed toward the two.

The assault earlier, the two people directly disrupted the other party’s formation.

At this time, as soon as Ye Yuan released the Universe Sword Formation, it directly enveloped dozens of people inside, helping Yang Qing to block most of the attacks.

While Yang Qing’s long spear had an unstoppable momentum, piercing through another ordinary grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven with one spear again.

“Damn it! Damn it! Surround the two of them! Don’t let them run!” Whalebillow bellowed.

They were hunting down Ye Yuan. In the end, Ye Yuan was fine, but they died one after another!

Whalebillow was virtually going insane now.

Although two general level powerhouses died, there were still 11 of them.

Once they formed an encirclement, it was definitely impossible for Ye Yuan two people to escape.

“Can’t ward off anymore! Retreat!” Just before the other party formed an encirclement, Ye Yuan directly urged the sword formation and killed a grand completion Sword Formation Heaven, killing his way out of the heavy encirclement again.

“Punk, you sold me out!” Yang Qing was currently too excited from the slaughtering and did not react in time at all.

He shouted loudly, his back directly sustaining a vicious blow, half his body collapsing. However, he also forcefully killed his way out and caught up to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan could not refrain from rolling his eyes. Why was this guy so stubborn?

That sort of situation just now, did he still need him to warn?

Could it be that he was even prepared to kill all these people?

Yang Qing was strong, but he was also merely about on par with Ye Yuan.

Killing, they definitely could not kill easily.

Once entangled, that would be death.

But Yang Qing was good, getting excited from killing and actually wanted to fight to the death …

Ye Yuan casually threw a heavenly pill over. The moment Yang Qing caught it and looked, his eyes could not help lighting up, and he cried out in surprise, “True grade! Good stuff!”

Immediately without hesitation, he directly swallowed it.

His body that was blown away also grew out at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Hahaha,?really good stuff! Come, come, come, let’s fight again!” Yang Qing raised his head to the sky and said with a loud laugh.

Hearing this, Whalebillow and the others who were at the back could not help being shocked, their speed immediately slowing down.

However, Ye Yuan two people directly increased their speed and shook everyone off.

“ARRHHHH!?Punk who’s surnamed Ye, I’ll definitely kill you!” From behind came Whalebillow’s bellow.

Ye Yuan was rendered speechless.?It wasn’t me who mocked you either. What are you killing me for?

However, with the addition of Yang Qing, this great escape became interesting.
