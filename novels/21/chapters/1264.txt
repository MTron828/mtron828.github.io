Chapter 1268: Great Dao Resonance!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Among the people present, no one understood what Dao was better than Kunwu.

Ye Yuan’s refining method looked simple to the extreme, but every movement contained the lingering charm of Dao.

His disciples exclaimed with admiration because they could not understand Ye Yuan’s Dao.

The two party’s realms were too far apart.

Kunwu clearly did not know alchemy. But from the disciples’ marveling exclamations, he could guess that what Ye Yuan used were all the most basic alchemy techniques.

But what Ye Yuan used was not the most basic alchemy skills.

Seemingly contradictory, this was actually the sublimation of returning to one’s original simplicity.

This was the Ten Directions Heaven Seizing Art!

“Huhu, somewhat interesting! This boy might really succeed!” Kunwu said with a laugh.

Xiao Ruyan looked towards Kunwu in surprise, plucked up her courage, and asked, “Senior, did you perceive something? I see that what Master used are all Tier 1 alchemy techniques. We all know them! Can this kind of technique refine the Dao Defying Pill?”

With her asking, everyone perked their ears up, wanting to hear Kunwu’s evaluation.

Especially White Light, he still heard that Ye Yuan created some Ten Directions Heaven Seizing Art previously. In the end, what he used was all some of the simplest refining techniques.

He naturally knew that Ye Yuan was not joking around. But he really could not tell what difference Ye Yuan’s techniques had from Tier 1 alchemy techniques.

“Tier 1 alchemy techniques? Haha, nay, nay! Your master has already reached the boundary of seeing the mountain as a mountain still, and seeing the water as water still! Your disparity with him is too far away, so you can’t understand,” Kunwu said with a loud laugh.

Xiao Ruyan’s eyes lit up, and she made a detailed inquiry, “Senior, please resolve my confusion!”

Kunwu gave her a glance and said with a smile, “One will never achieve their goals without doing things a step at a time. Not accumulating small streams, there’s no way to become a river or sea. Where Dao lies isn’t fleeting and ephemeral but inside every little bit. I don’t know alchemy, but myriad Great Daos all lead to the same destination. Tier 1 alchemy skills are the simplest, but also where the roots of alchemy techniques lie. When you guys cultivate to an extremely high realm, then turn back to look at it, maybe there will be a different feeling. Of course, with your current realms, it’s still far away!”

When everyone heard that, they were all dumbstruck!

Only then did they know what kind of profound realm Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao already reached.

This kind of realm completely had no way of using words to describe.

Xiao Ruyan trio exchanged glances, all smiling bitterly in the end.

Ye Yuan letting them out was naturally in order to let them sense the true Alchemy Dao a little.

Unfortunately, no matter how they looked, Ye Yuan was also refining a Tier 1 medicinal pill. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The three of them had all been drilled by Ye Yuan before and were all too familiar with Tier 1 alchemy techniques.

All of them, any one of the techniques could easily achieve entering the Legendary Realm.

But now, only when they watched Ye Yuan refine pills did they know that their road was still long!

Time went by day after day. In a blink of an eye, it was 10 days.

In these 10 days, there was nothing exciting.

Ye Yuan was constantly using the simplest alchemy techniques to refine the pill, unhurried and unremarkable.

But the expressions on the faces of Xiao Ruyan they all gradually became solemn.

Ye Yuan was refining nine medicinal embryos at the same time. But with 10 days, they gradually gained some level of attainment.

At this time, they finally somewhat understood Kunwu’s words.

Ordinary Tier 1 alchemy skills were absolutely unable to refine these nine medicinal embryos at the same time.

Nine medicinal embryos, inside them contained over a hundred types of spirit medicines. The difficulty of control was absolutely the entire Divine Realm’s peak.

But in 10 days, Ye Yuan did not make a hint of mistake!

This was simply something that one did not dare imagine.

Hence, the only possibility was that Ye Yuan’s alchemy techniques, they really could not understand.

Too profound!

Suddenly, everyone’s faces changed. Clouds gathered in the sky. Rays of sunglow fluctuated as if something major was going to happen.

Kunwu took a look at the sky and said laughed as he said with narrowed eyes, “Heh heh, aroused the resonance of Great Dao! This boy is truly remarkable! Old Fart Immortal Grove might have a qualified successor!”

...

Rumble ...

Above the skies of the entire Divine Realm, multi-colored sunglow rippled, shining upon the land until it became a gorgeous color.

Above the ninth heaven, thunder clapped and clouds rolled, heading over to the south!

At the dragon clan in the Demon Region, Fang Tian raised his head and looked at the sky, rays of brilliant light glimmering in his gaze.

“What happened? Who can actually cause such a heaven and earth phenomenon!” Fang Tian said in shock.

“Senior, looking at this commotion, it seems to be heading south. It’s precisely the direction of the Godsfall Mountain Range. Could ... Ye Yuan have broken through to Deity Realm?” By the side, Teng Yun’s eyes lit up and said in surprise.

Fang Tian darted him a glance and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “You’re thinking too much! Forget about breaking through to the Grotto Profound Deity Realm, even if breaking through to the Origin Deity Realm, it’s also impossible for the entire Divine Realm to have such a heaven and earth phenomenon appear! Such celestial phenomena, there’s probably only those existences in the god-forbidden region that can trigger it. I’m afraid that ...”

Teng Yun’s hopes that had just ignited was extinguished by Fang Tian.

Indeed, this kind of heaven and earth phenomenon already lasted a full three day’s time. Moreover, the scope spread to the entire Divine Realm.

Even if Ye Yuan broke through to Deity Realm, it was also impossible to cause such a terrifying heaven and earth phenomenon.

This kind of heaven and earth phenomenon, there were no records of it in the Divine Realm’s history at all.

Even if those Origin Deity Realm powerhouses, it was also not possible to make the entire Divine Realm so turbulent.

Suddenly, Fang Tian shut his eyes. When Teng Yun saw the situation, he exclaimed, “Senior, you mustn’t!”

His voice has yet to fade, and then only to see Fang Tian spewed out a mouthful of blood with a puff.

All of a sudden, Fang Tian seemed to have aged considerably!

Fang Tian looked up at the sky and murmured, “Heaven Dao can’t be pried into! I hope that Ye Yuan can return safely!”

...

At the same time, Kanuo slowly opened his eyes, his expression becoming very ugly!

“This is Great Dao resonance! That brat wouldn’t really have succeeded, right?”

“Heh, scared? You, this old fellow, are also nothing more than this!” Yue Ji suddenly appeared and said with a cold smile.

“Humph! Right now, it’s him and me competing on time! When this deity has swept across the Divine Realm, even if he attains Dao and becomes a deity, so what? Dispatch the orders, three days later, launch a general offensive against the Demon Region! We have to exterminate the demon race at all costs! This deity doesn’t believe that Fang Tian can still stop it this time!” Kanuo said disdainfully.

Yue Ji’s eyes lit up, and she said, “You already recovered your strength?”

“Otherwise, what do you think? Relax, everything is under this deity’s control! Even if that brat really becomes a deity and returns, he can’t escape the palm of my hand either, hahaha ...” Talking to the back, Kanuo let out a wild laugh.

Yue Ji’s gaze flickered but did not know where Kanuo’s confidence lay.

...

In the Godsfall Mountain Range, rays of sunglow descended from the sky, converging into the Dragon Sovereign Cauldron.

Xiao Ruyan and the rest who were by the side were long dumbfounded from watching already.

They had never seen before that refining medicinal pills could trigger such a heaven and earth phenomenon.

Rumble ...

Suddenly, the Dragon Sovereign Cauldron started trembling violently!

This scene made everyone’s faces change!

Boom!

It was only to hear a loud bang, and that Dragon Sovereign Cauldron actually directly exploded.

A terrifying energy swept out.
