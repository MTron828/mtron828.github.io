Chapter 2134: Threaten

“This ... How is this possible?”

Above the void came the cries of exclamations of the group of dragon race heavenly emperors.

The words that Long Zhi said were seriously too inconceivable.

“Huhu, do you all think that Ask Not, this eternal chess game, is that easy to solve? If not for having astonishing ability, how can Ye Yuan walk out of Ask Not?” Long Zhi said with a look of ridicule.

Even until now, Long Zhi held Ye Yuan in awe and veneration too.

The people who witnessed the entire process of Ye Yuan clearing Ask Not would respect Ye Yuan from the bottom of their hearts.

Under Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s pressure, what did heavenly emperors count as?

“Kid, you were messing with me?” Long Chi suddenly came to a realization and reproached angrily.

After Ye Yuan entered, he intentionally said to have him use suppression with bloodline power. Actually, Ye Yuan totally knew that no matter how strong his, Long Chi’s, bloodline power was, he could not suppress Ye Yuan at all.

Making a fool of himself, that’s all!

Yet, he fell for it.

Ye Yuan could contend with Sacred Ancestor High Priest, that kind of powerhouse, with true dragon will. How pure was his bloodline?

Wouldn’t utilizing bloodline power in front of him be teaching one’s grandmother how to suck eggs?

This guy simply did it on purpose!

“Huhu, you’re not considered too stupid yet,” Ye Yuan said with a laugh.

What not considered too stupid? It was simply too stupid!

Long Zhi already said the outcome before they came to realize the truth. What was it if not dumb?

“Brat, this emperor will tear you to pieces!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Long Chi’s angry roar came from above the void.

He bared his fangs and brandished his claws. An astonishing pressure enveloped down and was going to exterminate Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, a beautiful figure slowly walked out of the void and said coolly, “What are you trying to do, Long Chi? Do you want to make Raindragon Stronghold become the Dragon Clan’s sinner that’s condemned through the ages?!”

The arrival was dressed in white plumage, silky black hair winding around, boundlessly beautiful.

Ye Yuan looked over, this woman actually had some similarities with Long Xiaochun.

Long Chi’s face fell and he said rather unwillingly, “I pay respect to Dragon Lord!”

When the rest saw this woman, they also each bowed down.

Ye Yuan did not expect that this Raindragon Stronghold’s dragon lord was actually a woman!

Dragon Lord waved her hand and said coolly, “All returned to your original bodies for what? Trying to scare people? Why haven’t you put it away?!”

Long Chi and the rest recovered to their original appearances, all having embarrassed looks on their faces.

They did it in order to scare people, but who knew that they failed to scare people and even utterly lost their faces.

“You’re Ye Yuan?” Dragon Lord looked at Ye Yuan and started sizing him up.

“Ye Yuan pays respect to Dragon Lord!” Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said.

Long Chi was already too impatient to wait and said in a solemn voice, “Dragon Lord, this boy did not distinguish black from white and killed Long Hao three people when he just arrived at the Dragon Clan. He committed an atrocious crime and definitely can’t be tolerated!”

Dragon Lord’s dark brows furrowed slightly when she heard that and said, “This incident was clearly Long Hao three people who were in the wrong first, isn’t Elder Long Chi too overbearing?”

Long Hao injured Lu-er and Yang Fei-er and even wanted to forcibly seize the two people in public. Many people saw it, so it was naturally not difficult for Dragon Lord to want to know.

Except, to a powerhouse like Long Chi, how was there any right or wrong?

He was strong, so he was reason!

Long Chi gave a cold snort and said, “Overbearing? Heh heh, even if Hao-er committed a capital offense, it’s also not his turn to come and execute him! Moreover, just two measly human girls, Hao-er taking fancy on them is their fortune!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed and he said with a cold smile, “Indeed, a crooked stick will have a crooked shadow! In my view, your grandson was a pile of dog shit. Killed then killed, what about it? Could it be that you dare to kill me?”

“You!”

Long Chi choked and nearly stifled until he had internal injuries.

Ye Yuan’s identity was too sensitive, he could not touch him at all.

The crime of launching a divine war was not what he could shoulder!

“Humph! Do you really think that this emperor can’t do anything to you?” Long Chi said angrily.

“What can you do to me?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ye Yuan discovered that Long Chi seemed to make light of Dragon Lord.

It was like the person managing things here was him.

Long Chi laughed coldly and he said, “Even if I can’t kill you, those few people around you ... this emperor can kill them!”

Brilliant light suddenly shone from Ye Yuan’s eyes, the bloodline pressure in his body suddenly bloomed, and he said in a cold voice, “If you dare to touch them, this Ye will definitely trample your Raindragon Stronghold in the future! If you don’t believe it, you can wait and see!”

Long Chi’s two eyes narrowed, he saw incomparably firm resolve in Ye Yuan’s eyes.

He did not doubt that Ye Yuan had this ability. With Ye Yuan’s talent, reaching Heavenly Emperor Realm was virtually certain!

Swoosh!

Right at this time, a figure suddenly barged into this space.

“Long Chi, if you dare to make things difficult for Ye Yuan, I, Long Xiaochun, definitely will not let you off!”

Long Xiaochun arrived!

When Dragon Lord saw Long Xiaochun, her brows furrowed and she berated, “Long Xiaochun! You arbitrarily barged into the elders meeting. Where’s the sense of propriety?”

When Long Xiaochun saw Dragon Lord, her pretty face could not help turning stiff. But very quickly, she stubbornly said again: “Mother, this matter was clearly Long Hao’s fault, even death couldn’t expiate his sins. So why punish Ye Yuan?”

When Long Chi saw Long Xiaochun arrive, he did not get angry but was overjoyed instead.

Only to see him give a cold snort and say: “Dragon Lord, Long Xiaochun trespassed the elders meeting and shows no respect for her elders, I wonder what should be the punishment!”

Dragon Lord’s expression changed, and she said in anger: “Long Xiaochun! Still don’t withdraw, this emperor will put you in confinement for a thousand years!”

Long Xiaochun gritted her teeth and said stubbornly, “Even if you confine me for 1000 years, I also can’t let you guys hurt Ye Yuan! He was brought here by me, so I must bring him out safely!”

Seeing Long Xiaochun defending him like this, Ye Yuan was moved.

He laughed and said, “Xiaochun, you withdraw first. This old fellow doesn’t dare to touch me.”

Long Xiaochun blinked a few times and said, “Really?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course it’s real! If this old thing dared to kill me, why would he hold some elders meeting?”

Long Xiaochun tilted her head and thought about it, it seemed to be the truth. Hence, she nodded her head happily and said with a smile, “Okay, then I’ll wait for you outside!”

After Long Xiaochun left, Long Chi laughed coldly and said, “Kid, whether you can live until then is still not known! Dragon Lord, even if I can’t touch Ye Yuan, there’s no problem with this emperor killing a few of his people to vent my anger, right? You wouldn’t ... shelter a few humans, right?”

When Dragon Lord heard that, her face revealed a hesitant look.

But Ye Yuan’s expression changed. Dragon Lord’s change in attitude made his heart sink to rock-bottom.

When Long Chi saw Ye Yuan’s expression, he was delighted.

This brat was just like a hedgehog, neither listening to reason nor bowing to force. But his probing earlier clearly found Ye Yuan’s weakness.

His weakness was the people around him!

Seeing that Dragon Lord was still hesitating, Long Chi increased the dosage and said, “If Dragon Lord insists on showing partiality for humans, then this emperor can only initiate an elders meeting to decide by voting!”

Ye Yuan saw that the situation was not right and said in a cold voice, “Old dog, what the hell do you want?”

Long Chi smiled coldly and said, “Heh heh, this emperor even thought that you feared neither heaven nor the earth, turns out that you have something that you’re scared of too! Rest assured, as long as you promise this emperor a condition, this emperor can let those few people go!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed together, and he said in a solemn voice, “What condition?”

Long Chi chuckled and had an appearance of satisfaction due to his wicked scheme succeeding as he said, “Sign a life-and-death agreement! Just say that you willingly entered the Dragon Eye Cave and everything has nothing to do with the Dragon Clan! As long as you can do it, this emperor will spare their lives!”
