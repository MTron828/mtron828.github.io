Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed. His good impression of this Jiang Xueyan immediately plummeted heavily.

He did not have the intention of pestering Baili Qingyan, but that Baili Qingyan insisted on teaming up with him.

Ye Yuan believed that with the Immortal Abode Sect’s strength, it was impossible to not know about this intel.

But she still warned him.

When Jiang Xueyan saw Ye Yuan’s expression, she said with a cold smile, “Don’t think that you’re impressive because your talent is high. Sometimes, talent is also a kind of original sin! Regardless of whether it is the Soaring Flower Sect, the Cloudsword sect, or our Immortal Abode Sect, wanting to kill you is as simple as crushing an ant! Just like earlier, if not for Baili, if not for me rushing over, you would already be a dead man now. While you can only hide behind a woman, indignant but powerless.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold, that trace of favorable impression towards Jiang Xueyan also vanished into thin air along with it.

These words were rather incisive.

“Your pride is because you have a powerful faction at the back? Then I have to say, you’re very pitiful! Your lame sense of superiority isn’t worth mentioning in front of me! Also, what relationship Miss Baili and I have, isn’t your turn to care about yet. She only belongs to herself!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

Except, Jiang Xueyan did not get angry because of Ye Yuan’s words, but she sneered and said, “This is that pitiful bit of self-esteem of yours? Relax, very soon, you’ll see how cruel reality is. The Shadowmoon Sect doesn’t lack geniuses. Baili, let’s go.”

“Senior Apprentice Sister! The assessment hasn’t ended yet!” But Baili Qingyan was not willing to go and made an excuse.

Jiang Xueyan’s face fell and she said, “The heavenly demon crystals in your hands are already sufficient to pass the assessment, there’s also no need to stay anymore.”

Finished talking, Jiang Xueyan gave no chance to explain and forcefully brought Baili Qingyan away.

After everyone left, Ye Yuan spewed out another large mouthful of blood.

“Qian Ye, is it? Today’s grudge, I’ve remembered it!” Ye Yuan said with a chilly gaze.

How powerful was the blow of a First Firmament Celestial Deity? That was only the case for Ye Yuan. If it were others, they would already be dead until not even dregs remained at this time.

That instant just now, Ye Yuan employed spatial law, directing the vast majority of the force out. That was how he escaped death by a hair’s breadth.

The perils involved were hard to describe.

Divine Dao realm, each major realm was a layer of firmament.

The world power of martial artists went from a quantitative change to qualitative change.

From a small world, transforming into a genuine world, evolving myriad life, becoming the sovereign of a world.

Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse was when one started giving birth to myriad life!

When the small world truly consolidated, all life was about to form, it was also when one broke through to the True God Realm.

Hence, the Celestial Deity Realm, even just a First Firmament Celestial Deity, that was also an invincible existence to those in the Divine Lord Realms.

For Ye Yuan to be able to avoid this attack, it was truly incredibly dangerous.

Alone by himself, Ye Yuan found a secluded place to heal up his injuries.

After several days, a month’s time was up, Ye Yuan walked out of the Shadowmoon Mountain Range.

...

Returning to the mountain gate once more, the number of people in the plaza was clearly significantly lesser.

This examination did not forbid killing. Quite a number of disciples lost their lives at the maws of fierce beasts or died at other people’s hands.

Those able to live were all powerhouses.

Of course, if not for Qian Ye’s forceful intervention, Zhong Hanlin this so-called genius would have to remain in the Shadowmoon Mountain Range forever.

That old man in charge of the assessment slowly opened his mouth and said, “Now, hand over all of your heavenly demon crystals. After verifying, this old man will naturally announce the rankings.”

Baili Qingyan’s and Ye Yuan two people’s heavenly demon crystals had been under Ye Yuan’s custody all this while.

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly walked out of the crowd and handed the storage ring issued by the sect to a miscellaneous affairs disciple.

Seeing Ye Yuan come out, soft discussions immediately started in the crowd.

“It’s that guy Senior Apprentice Sister Baili took the initiative to team up with. He’s really lucky, really entered the second round lying down.”

“Heh, one time luck is useless. The second round is the true test. With his strength, it’s totally impossible to pass.”

“Tsk tsk, spending the night together with Senior Apprentice Sister Baili in the mountain, make me die and I’d also be willing!”

...

The news of Ye Yuan and Duan Qinghong’s great battle did not spread.

This concerned the Soaring Flower lineage and Cloudsword lineage, two major forces’ reputations. How could they dare to simply talk about it?

Although the Devil Elephant lineage was strong, compared to the three great factions, it was still much weaker.

Moreover, this also concerned the Devil Elephant lineage’s own reputation.

Such a powerful faction was actually defeated in Ye Yuan’s hands alone, how could they have any face?

The Devil Elephant lineage already issued a gag order, that everyone was not to mention that events that happened that day.

Baili Qingyan was also in the crowd. Looking at Ye Yuan’s back view, her expression was complicated.

The gazes of Qian Ye, Duan Qinghong, Zhong Hanlin, and the rest also kept on following Ye Yuan, full of enmity.

The moment Ye Yuan took the field, he practically became the center of everyone’s attention.

That old man looked at Ye Yuan with a curious look on his face.

What in the world did this kid do? Why would so many people pay attention to him?

Very soon, everyone handed in their storage rings.

After a bout of checking, the old man called Qian Ye to his side and said, “Qian Ye, you announce the results.”

Qian Ye bowed and said, “Yes, Deacon Hong!”

But, when his gaze landed on the name list, his expression could not help becoming very ugly.

The first place was shockingly Baili Qingyan and Ye Yuan, this combo.

This damn fellow, how did he get so many heavenly demon crystals? He and Baili Qingyan teaming up, the heavenly demon crystal quantity that they acquired in the end is actually more than the remaining top five added up! Qian Ye was reluctant to accept it in his heart.

One had to know, under the situation of teaming up, not only did the number of heavenly demon crystals have to be greatly discounted, one even had to share equally with their teammates.

This way, for teams to want to get first place, it was doubly difficult. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The normal situation of teams were all those disciples whose strength were not strong. Because they had to face uncertain danger.

Disciples who truly had strength felt it beneath their dignity to form teams.

“Why? Could there be a problem?” Deacon Hong asked when he saw Qian Ye keeping mum for a long time.

Qian Ye’s expression changed and he hurriedly said, “N-No problem!”

He recollected his mind and started reading out the results: “First place, Baili Qingyan, Ye Yuan, heavenly demon crystal quantity, 223 pieces each! Second place, Zhong Hanlin, heavenly demon crystal quantity 83 pieces ...”

Buzz!

An uproar burst out below all at once

That Deacon Hong also had a stunned face, looking at Qian Ye in disbelief, suspecting whether he read wrongly or not.

223 pieces of heavenly demon crystals. Furthermore, this was teaming up, this number was too much.

Furthermore, this quantity of heavenly demon crystals was converted into late-stage rank four heavenly demon crystals.

Ten pieces of middle-stage rank four heavenly demon crystal could exchange for the heavenly demon crystal of a late-stage rank four.

This was also to say that these two people hunted down at least a thousand rank four fierce beasts!

Doing to this extent in a month’s time was simply fantastical.

In the past, the first place was merely 80 to 90 pieces of heavenly demon crystals.

Baili Qingyan’s pair of beautiful eyes looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief, with an incredulous expression on her face.

Suddenly, her beautiful body shuddered, suddenly thinking of something, her pupils involuntarily constricting.
