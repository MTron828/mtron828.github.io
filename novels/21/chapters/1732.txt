1736 Netherworld Dark Fragrance Flower

“Retreated! They retreated!”

The few people were currently running when those Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs retreated like tidewater, including that bug king which also did not dare to come over anymore.

Seeing this, the few people all heaved a long sigh in relief.

This sea of insects was truly too scary, making them have a feeling of making a trip to and back from the gates of hell.

“Puhwark!”

Stopping, Ye Yuan’s injuries could no longer be suppressed and started vomiting blood in large mouthfuls.

Yu Jing’s expression changed and she hurriedly supported Ye Yuan and said, “Ye Yuan, are you alright?”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said rather feebly, “I’m fine. I won’t die!”

Yu Jing had a remorseful look. She knew that Ye Yuan would only be injured so badly in order to protect her.

Otherwise, with Ye Yuan’s strength, that bug king could not stop him at all.

“Heh heh, the hero rescuing the beauty always need to pay some price!” Luo Yong said with a cold smile.

The moment Yu Jing heard this, she immediately exploded and scolded angrily, “Surnamed Luo, what do you mean? Just now, asking you all for help, none of you acted. Now, making irresponsible and sarcastic remarks, can you be more shameless?”

Luo Yong had always hankered after Yu Jing a lot. But looking at the current situation, he knew that he had no more hope.

Hence, the original enthusiasm became resentment.

This was the so-called, giving birth to hatred because of love, right?

Luo Yong smiled coldly and said, “Yu Jing, you don’t get deceived by this brat anymore! He concealed his strength, sneaked into our team. So who knows what’s he trying to do? If he’s open and aboveboard, why couldn’t he tell us earlier?”

Yu Jing responded with a cold smile, “Don’t think others to be as filthy as you!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Stop quarreling, I’ll recover a bit!”

He fished out a medicinal pill and consumed it, and started to meditate on the spot.

Soon after, he regained more than half of his strength.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them was extremely shocked.

The medicinal effects of this medicinal pill was also a little too good, right?

“This place is already the central-area of the earth-fire. If my conjectures are right, the antidote should be around here,” Ye Yuan got up and slowly said.

Duan Peng said, “But, how do we know what object can cure the poison here?”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, extended his hand, and flipped it. A milky-white bug appeared in the palm of his hand. It was shockingly a Firecloud Ice Edge Bug.

The bug was very ferocious, having the appearance of baring its fangs and brandishing its claws. But it had restrictions laid down by Ye Yuan and could not break free at all.

“Using this to find it!”

The moment Yu Jing saw this, she could not help saying in surprise, “Under that sort of situation earlier, you actually still had time to capture a Firecloud Ice Edge Bug?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Casually caught one, this thing is too weak.”

Everyone was rendered speechless!

Weak? This was a rank four fierce beast!

Ye Yuan opened his and started to turn around on the spot.

Suddenly, the bug in Ye Yuan’s palm became restless. Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and walked over in that direction.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help clicking their tongues in wonder.

Turned out that one could still use this kind of method to find the antidote, truly an eye-opener.

Ye Yuan kept on walking forward in that direction. The Firecloud Ice Edge Bug became more and more restless.

Suddenly, a stretch of dark-red little flowers appeared ahead.

The Firecloud Ice Edge Bug in Ye Yuan’s hand suddenly became incomparably frenzied, colliding around inside the restriction wildly. Then there was no more movement.

The moment everyone looked, it turned out that the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug was actually already without vitality. It died!

Yu Jing forcefully suppressed the joy in her heart and said with a hopeful look, “Ye Yuan, these flowers wouldn’t be ...”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “That’s it, won’t be wrong!”

Duan Peng said with a doubtful look, “What flower is this? I never seemed to have heard of it before!”

Those in their line of work, even though they were not as proficient as alchemists, the vast majority of spirit medicines, they recognized them.

But this dark-red small flower, even though it brimmed with spiritual energy and the grade was not low, they had never seen before and also never heard before.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Never heard before, then it’s right. If everyone has heard of it before, how can a Five-star Alchemy God possibly be helpless to do anything about the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug’s poison? The Firecloud Ice Edge Bug is rare to begin with. The spirit medicines able to resolve its poison were naturally even rarer.”

Upon thinking, Duan Peng thought so as well. If it was a spirit medicine that everyone knew, this poison would be nothing unusual.

Ye Yuan was not long-winded, putting away these spirit medicines swiftly, and did not have the intention of allotting with the rest.

But Luo Yong was indignant and said unhappily, “Brat, what do you mean by this? This is, at any rate, a rank four spirit medicine too, could it be that you want to pocket it alone?”

But Ye Yuan said indifferently, “A spirit medicine whose name isn’t even known, you plan on taking it to go sell for money? Don’t waste things, alright? This thing placed in your hands is called a wanton waste of God’s good gifts. Placed in my hands, it might be able to yield unusually brilliant results. Moreover, what qualifications do you have to compete with me? Don’t you forget, we still have to pass through the Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs’ territory to go back!”

At this time, Ye Yuan finally revealed his imposing side, momentum threatening, forcing Luo Yong to not dare to look him in the eyes.

At the start, he just did not stoop to haggle over it with this kind of person.

He did not expect that this guy jumped more and more merrily. Until now, he still did not figure out his standing, then he had no need to be courteous anymore.

These people were merely guides for Ye Yuan.

Luo Yong’s face turned stiff when he heard that, and was taken aback by Ye Yuan’s powerful aura, and actually did not dare to look Ye Yuan in the eyes anymore.

Not just Luo Yong, even Duan Peng also could not quite bear it and opened his mouth to smooth things over and said, “H-Haha, this trip was all Brother Ye putting in the effort. These things should be obtained by Brother Ye. Moreover, this flower can only treat the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug’s poison. So its usage won’t be too broad either. The price won’t be too high. Old Luo, just let it go!”

When Luo Yong heard that, he also took the chance to back down. Giving a cold snort, he stopped talking.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Hurry up, we shouldn’t stay in this place for long!”

“Roar!”

His voice had yet to fade when a roar was heard from the dense woods.

Everyone’s faces changed, taking off running!

Ye Yuan sprinted wildly along the way, maintaining composure on the surface. But actually, he was long already overflowing with joy in his heart.

These people did not recognize this dark-red little flower, but he recognized it!

This small flower was called Netherworld Dark Fragrance Flower, a rank four spirit medicine extremely abundant in spiritual energy.

Using it to refine cultivation medicinal pills, the medicinal effect was more than 10 times of ordinary medicinal pills!

It was just that this flower was seriously too rare. Even the Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove back then had merely just seen it once.

He did not expect that this thing actually still had the function of resolving the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug’s poison.

Placed in the world, a medicinal pill could sell for a price of at least 100 billion too!

So many Netherworld Dark Fragrance Flowers, the value was simply immeasurable!

But just as Ye Yuan said, only by placing this spirit medicine in his hands could its true value be displayed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Placed in other people’s hands, it was simply a wanton waste of God’s good gifts.

However, the medicinal pills that Ye Yuan currently used for cultivation were already pretty much depleted. It was precisely the time of shortage between two harvests.

Now, finding so many Netherworld Dark Fragrance Flowers, he did not need to worry about cultivation for a very long period of time in the future anymore.

This kind of treasure, Ye Yuan naturally would not let them land in these people’s hands.
