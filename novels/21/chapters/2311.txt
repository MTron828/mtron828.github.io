Chapter 2315: Absolute Retaliation!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Pfft!”

Ye Yuan’s piece fell down and he immediately spewed out a mouthful of blood.

Landed again, vomited again. He landed again, and he vomited again.

His fleshy body was extremely powerful, but now, it was practically at the extent of being at the end of his life.

He looked extremely miserable.

This alchemy battle was no less than even a paramount great battle.

For Ye Yuan, it was too hard.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest looked at Ye Yuan and could not help recalling himself back then.

How similar was this scene!

He sat withered in front of the chessboard previously and sat for several thousand years.

Medicine Ancestor’s moves aimed straight at the Dao heart, impossible to guard against at all.

Ye Yuan’s strength was too weak to begin with, facing the even stronger Medicine Ancestor, he could only be defeated even more thoroughly.

“Sigh, it’s all my fault. This boy ... is most likely crippled already.” Sacred Ancestor High Priest said with a gloomy sigh.

Actually, even if he did not say, everyone could tell too.

This myth ends here!

A prodigy that made the world tremble already came to a curtain call here.

“Young Friend, it ends here!”

Suddenly, Medicine Ancestor’s dry voice came from above the void.

Pah!

A piece landed, the void trembled, and the entire chessboard started shaking violently.

Above the chessboard, white light radiated brilliantly. The dazzling light broke right through the firmament, completely drowning out the black pieces.

This chessboard world no longer had a way out for the black pieces.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, his eyes full of an ashen look.

Clearly, he was already at the end of his rope.

His gaze revealed a pondering look, seemingly not understanding the situation before his eyes.

“It shouldn’t be like this!” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

“Young Friend, you lost.” Medicine Ancestor said coolly,

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I didn’t lose, there must still be a way out!”

Medicine Ancestor said leisurely, “When you took the first step, this ancestor has already seen through a hundred steps! Each one of your steps is within this ancestor’s calculations. The world that you constructed is operating according to this ancestor’s will. Are you still not admitting defeat?”

This was a showdown but also a genuine fight.

Whoever ruled this world of chessboard was the victor.

The current Medicine Ancestor was not the Medicine Ancestor in Ask Not.

That Medicine Ancestor was merely a wisp of remnant soul. Furthermore, he was suppressed by Sacred Ancestor High Priest. Ye Yuan could position himself in a leisurely manner.

While in this place, his opponent was the real Medicine Ancestor, his might could shatter everything.

No matter what means you have, it was not worth mentioning at all in front of absolute strength.

This alchemy battle was firmly controlled by Medicine Ancestor from the very beginning.

What kind of world Ye Yuan wanted to construct, how to construct, Medicine Ancestor saw it clearly.

Therefore, he did not need to think at all.

When humans think, God laughs.

What it was talking about was this kind of situation.

The height that Medicine Ancestor stood at was too high, he was watching this alchemy battle from the perspective of God.

No matter how ever-changing you were, how could you escape God’s eyes?

Ye Yuan racking his brains to think was nothing more than a farce in Medicine Ancestor’s view.

“No one can control everything! I can’t, you can’t, even ... Heavenly Dao can’t either! I will lose, but ... I absolutely won’t lose like this!” Ye Yuan used a similarly dry voice to say.

A chess game for nearly 100 years, Ye Yuan had been trying to escape Medicine Ancestor’s control.

Every step he took was made with extreme difficulty.

Exchanging moves with a god-like powerhouse, if one played according to the other party’s tempo, there was no chance of winning at all.

Others all said that he was overestimating his own ability, but did not know how impressive he was to hold out until now.

From the very first move Medicine Ancestor made, Ye Yuan understood that the current Medicine Ancestor was definitely no idea how many times stronger than the Medicine Ancestor back then!

He had fought with Sacred Ancestor High Priest before. Even though it was just a tiny probing, he could confirm that Sacred Ancestor High Priest was far worse than Medicine Ancestor!

He naturally would not feel that Sacred Ancestor High Priest was intentionally cheating him. It could only mean that the Medicine Ancestor made great improvements again in these years.

One could say that the current Medicine Ancestor was already infinitely close to the level of Dao pill, close to being a god.

No wonder the first time he laid eyes on Medicine Ancestor, it gave him a ludicrous illusion that the other party was a medicinal pill.

But so what?

He came in order to witness the highest summit of the alchemy path!

Fighting with heaven, an endless enjoyment.

Fighting with a god, an endless delight.

“This ancestor has integrated Wing’s Dao and already touched the power of law! In this Dao, this ancestor is a god! How can a group of ants fight with a god?” Medicine Ancestor said coolly.

The group of ancestors had the jitters when they heard it. Touching the power of law, that was the level of Dao Ancestors!

That level of existence was truly an existence that governed destiny, its power unimaginable.

At present, the title of Medicine Ancestor was already in reality as well as in name!

“Forget about the fact that you’re not a god, even if you’re really a god, so what?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze shifted toward the chessboard, then fell into contemplation again.

Medicine Ancestor was indifferent, his figure moving, returning above the cloud platform.

“Huhu, this kid is as stubborn as you back then!” Medicine Ancestor said with a dry laugh. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wing’s gaze turned dark and he said in a cold voice, “Stop pretending, actually, you’re very surprised too, right? Or should I say, you’re currently secretly happy! Because I delivered you a treasure trove!”

Medicine Ancestor smiled and said, “Huhu, looks like you already understand! This ancestor walking until today, what I relied on wasn’t suppressing juniors. Your Dao heart falling was just because your Dao heart had flaws. That’s right; you delivered a big gift to this ancestor today. The strength of this kid’s Dao exceeds my imagination! After this ancestor digests today’s battle, I’ll definitely be able to comprehend the power of law and attain the true level of Dao pill!”

Everyone trembled all over, this news was seriously too shocking.

Dao pill, that was the realm that all alchemists dreamed of.

Except, no one had ever reached it!

After today, Medicine Ancestor was actually able to reach this paramount realm!

In the past, everyone said that Medicine Ancestor was half a Dao Ancestor.

But soon, Medicine Ancestor would become a true Dao Ancestor level powerhouse!

At this time, everyone’s gazes when looking at Ye Yuan again could not help turning into pity.

Everyone all thought that Ye Yuan’s roaring into existence would shake Cloudheart Realm’s foundation, and drag the alchemy world into a warring states period.

But who knew that Medicine Ancestor used Ye Yuan as a footboard, and corroborated his Dao to become a true Dao Ancestor!

“Huhu, congratulations, Medicine Ancestor, for achieving Alchemy Dao supremacy!”

“Congratulations!”

... ...

The group of ancestors went forward one after another to congratulate Medicine Ancestor in advance.

That moment Medicine Ancestor corroborated his Dao, the entire Heavenspan World would tremble because of it.

The status of the Medicine Ancestor at that time would truly be on par with Dao Ancestors.

And the Dao of Medicinal Pills would also truly be juxtaposed with Martial Dao, becoming a peerless Great Dao.

This significance was too great!

Medicine Ancestor did not reciprocate. He still had his eyes shut, like an ancient well without ripples.

Reaching his level of boundary, he had long not felt delighted by external gains and not saddened by personal losses already.

Pah!

A clear sound suddenly sounded out in the world, suddenly interrupting the felicitations.

Everyone turned around and looked, but discovered that Ye Yuan actually stubbornly landed a piece.

“Huhu, this kid still hasn’t given up?”

“Lamentable, pitiable!

“A genius fell here.”

... ...

Everyone revealed looks of contempt, very disdainful toward Ye Yuan’s action of not being able to bear a loss.

But right at this moment, Medicine Ancestor’s two eyes that had been shut all along suddenly snapped open, staring fixedly at the heaven and earth chessboard, erupting with rays of brilliant light!
