Chapter 2765: Dumbfounded!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan’s voice had yet to fade when Yu Haizheng stopped him.

“What? You lured the Pill Alliance’s people over, and now, you still want to leave?” Yu Haizheng said with a cold smile.

The timing was too coincidental; they had just reached, and the Pill Alliance’s people came. It was not up to the Blood Alliance’s people to not suspect.

And in reality, Ye Yuan had also been very careful along the way.

His divine sense had always been spread out. Even if there were Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses following them, it absolutely could not escape Ye Yuan’s probing too.

Therefore, Ye Yuan was very sure that the Blood Alliance’s base camp was indeed exposed.

In reality, with the Pill Alliance’s present strength, if they really made up their mind to deal with the Blood Alliance, how could there be the logic of not being able to find them?

The reason why they let them do as they pleased was actually merely just waiting for them to grow fat before slaughtering.

If he was the Pill Alliance’s alliance chief, he would do the same too.

Rather than there being opposing voices everywhere, might as well fatten them up and round them up in one fell swoop.

And he himself was merely there at the right time, that was all.

Ye Yuan sighed slightly and said, “Brother Yu is mistaken. But this place is already exposed. You all had best gather your things and prepare to leave.”

Finished saying that, Ye Yuan’s figure swayed, and he directly vanished in front of Yu Haizheng’s eyes.

What a joke!

Regarding the present Ye Yuan, his spatial rule already reached late-stage fourth level. How could a mere Yu Haizheng stop him?

Yu Haizheng’s expression changed wildly. Turning his head to look, he discovered that Ye Yuan’s figure was already gone.

Yu Haizheng was exploded with fury and yelled coldly, “Luo Yunqing, look what you’ve done! We’ve shared life and death for more than a hundred years. You actually invited a wolf into the house and let a thousand brothers fall into a deathtrap!”

Zhou Yunxiang smiled coldly and said,?“Huhu,?Luo Yunqing, you’re very good! You actually drew your sword against me!”

At this time, Luo Yunqing also calmed down. Drawing a deep breath, he said, “Two brothers, it was me who was impulsive just now! But, to say that Ye Yuan betrayed the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, I won’t believe it even if I die! Being confronted by a formidable enemy, we can’t have internal strife! Two brothers, let’s tide over the difficult hurdle this time first! Later, you guys charge out with me. I’ll do all that I can and delay the half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses as much as possible! The two of you, bring our brothers to break out of the encirclement. How many can escape will depend on fate!”

Hearing that Luo Yunqing said so, Yu Haizheng two people also knew that the matter was of utmost importance.

Having internal strife at this time was equivalent to seeking death.

The two nodded their heads and started counting the men, preparing to break out of the encirclement.

For the Blood Alliance to be able to become the number one great faction, they naturally did not have an undeserved reputation.

The thousand-strong troop was done assembling very quickly.

Luo Yunqing took the lead, and everyone had an expression full of a stirring and solemn noble spirit to die on their faces.

Clearly, they were all prepared to fight to the death.

Luo Yunqing’s gaze turned intent, and he shouted loudly, “KILL!”

“KILL!”

Luo Yunqing leaped and was about to charge out of the mystic realm.

But right at this time, a figure appeared at the entrance.

Ye Yuan looked at everyone and said with a smile, “All packed? Just nice then. This place isn’t somewhere to stay for long. Let’s go.”

Everyone exchanged glances, especially Zhou Yunxiang and Yu Haizheng two people who had confused faces.

Why did this guy come back?

If this guy was a traitor, why would he come back?

If he was not, this guy was spotless and did not seem like he had experienced a great battle at all.

What in the world was going on?

Also, where were the scouts? Why hasn’t a single one returned until now?

“Ye Yuan, why did you come back? With your movement technique, escaping shouldn’t be a problem. Hurry up and go!” Luo Yunqing said with a frown.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I naturally came to bring you all away. Come with me.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan turned around and went out of the mystic realm.

Luo Yunqing’s gaze turned intent, and he followed after.

Passing through the entrance, Luo Yunqing raised his aura to the highest, preparing to battle.

But very soon, he was stupefied.

There wasn’t a single person outside of the large waterfall.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The Blood Alliance army came out of the passageway one after another. After coming out, they were stunned too.

Wasn’t it said that they were surrounded?

Wasn’t it said that there were countless powerhouses?

Where were the people?

At this time, a scout suddenly scurried out.

Zhou Yunxiang shouted coldly, “Wang Chun! What have the few of you been doing?”

Wang Chun smiled bitterly and said, “Alliance Chief Zhou, j-just now, I was seriously dumbfounded and momentarily forgot to come in to report.”

Zhou Yunxiang’s brows furrowed slightly. He knew that the members of the Blood Alliance were all veterans of a hundred battles. What kind of grand occasion had they not seen before?

What could render even a wily old fox like Wang Chun dumbfounded?

He could not help looking towards Ye Yuan, thinking to himself, it wouldn’t be that this guy did something, right?

How was this possible?

What kind of earth-shattering major thing could an upper Jade Sovereign Heaven do?

But, Wang Chun gave Ye Yuan a glance fearfully and said, “The … The moment this lord came out, he killed off all of the other party’s half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens within ten breaths! The Pill Alliance’s army scattered and fled in disorder in a blink of an eye! His Excellency pursued all the way and slew all of the other party’s Jade Sovereign Heavens …”

Dead silence!

What kind of freaking fantasy tale are you talking about?!

An upper Jade Sovereign heaven killed off all the half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens in ten breaths?

Suddenly, Zhou Yunxiang exploded in anger and said, “Wang Chun, what nonsense are you saying? You mean, he killed the Pill Alliance’s army by himself?”

Wang Chun’s expression was ugly as he said, “I-It’s like that!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a smile, “Have the corpses been gathered?”

Wang Chun nodded and said, “The brothers are currently gathering them. It should be about done. Your Excellency, I’ll bring you over!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and followed.

The corpses of half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens naturally had quite a number of spoils.

To the Blood Alliance, it was a huge harvest too.

Very soon, corpses that strewn across the land appeared in front of everyone.

The whole place fell into dead silence once again!

“Li Chuan! Chai Meng! Yang Nan! They … They are all dead …” Zhou Yunxiang looked at these dead bodies, his eyeballs almost popping out.

These half-step Saint Sovereign heavens had fought with them many times.

The Blood Alliance had suffered big losses at these few people’s hands!

Now, they were actually all dead!

“Hahaha?…”

Suddenly, Luo Yunqing laughed loudly and said, “Ye Yuan, you really broadened my horizons today! You punk, you really hid from me bitterly!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You didn’t ask either!”

As he said, he looked at Zhou Yunxiang and said with a smile, “Brother Zhou, Brother Yu, now, I can prove that I’m not a traitor, right?”

Zhou Yunxiang revealed a smile that was even uglier than crying and said, “O-Of course!”

He currently wished to find a hole in the ground to tunnel into.

From the very start, he had been questioning Ye Yuan’s qualifications.

Later, he even questioned that Ye Yuan was a traitor and that the people were brought by him.

But now, facts proved that Ye Yuan was simply their savior!

Today, if not for Ye Yuan, the Blood Alliance would have been totally finished!

As for Yu Haizheng, he even broke out in cold sweat. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He actually wanted to make a move against Ye Yuan just now.

Ye Yuan killed half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens like killing chickens. If so, then to kill him alone, he reckoned that just lifting a hand would do.

How could an upper Jade Sovereign Heaven be so terrifying?

“Lord … Ye, just now, it was all this Yu who had eyes but couldn’t see, hope that Lord Ye doesn’t take it to heart.” Yu Haizheng said with a bitter smile.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a smile, “Two brothers don’t have to be like this. It wasn’t easy for the Blood Alliance to rise up. Being a little cautious is a must. In reality, I didn’t come to the Blood Alliance to be your alliance chief but came to invite Brother Luo and the two of you to make a trip to Myriad Demons Mountain together. But now, your base has already been exposed, and you can’t continue staying here. Why don’t you bring the brothers along and go to Myriad Demons Mountain with me?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed again.

Luo Yunqing said in surprise, “Ye Yuan, Myriad Demons Mountain is the territory of true spirits, with countless powerhouses in it. There are even Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses! Can we, these people … go?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax. Would I harm you?”
