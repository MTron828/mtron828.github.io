Chapter 2091: Heaven Shocking Lightning

Seeing Ye Yuan put away the bone sword calmly, Empyrean Windlike’s two eyes were practically spewing fire.

Vast Wind Assemble’s future was actually killed just like that, right under his eyelids.

He thought that by relying on his Empyrean might, it was absolutely impossible for such a thing to happen. Ye Yuan also would not dare to kill him right in his face.

But Ye Yuan killed him just like that.

“Punk, you’ve got guts!” Empyrean Windlike gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Feng Tianyang coveted Lu-er’s Profound Yin Divine Physique. He deserved to die!”

If Feng Tianyang just took fancy on Lu-er’s beauty, Ye Yuan also would not have his killing intent aroused.

After all, everyone loved beautiful things. Ye Yuan would not go so far as to be so crazy, killing off anyone who took fancy on the people around him.

But Feng Tianyang never should have had designs on Lu-er’s divine physique.

If Feng Tianyang took Lu-er’s Profound Yin Divine Physique, Lu-er would become a cripple if minor, or kick the bucket if it was serious.

How could Ye Yuan tolerate this kind of thing?

“Good, good, good! Today, if I, Windlike, don’t kill you, I’m not human!” Empyrean Windlike was already furious to the extreme, his body emitting an outrageous aura.

Feng Tianyang was the extreme north’s future master, was the Vast Wind Assemble’s future.

Now, he was actually dead!

Empyrean Windlike’s fury could be imagined.

“What a terrific little brute, you dared to kill Honorable Nephew Tianyang, it’s becoming enemies with the entire land of extreme north! Today, this Empyrean will definitely kill you!” Empyrean Ice Cloud immediately jumped out and said.

“Little Friend Ye Yuan, you went overboard in this matter! Today, you must stay here! This Empyrean won’t sit by idly and remain indifferent too!” Empyrean Redfeather also said.

With Feng Tianyang dying at Jiu Luo Ji, it would be hard for them all, these people, to absolve themselves from the blame.

Once Empyrean Vast Wind investigated it, they would not be able to bear the consequences.

Hence, their attitude must be shown right now.

The other Empyreans also spoke up, wanting to capture Ye Yuan one after another.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, and he said with a smile, “Kill me? Heh heh, today’s matters aren’t over yet! The injustice that Lu-er suffered these few years, this Ye will claim it back for her today all at once! Today, this Ye will exterminate your Ice Cloud Tower down to the last person!”

Ye Yuan staying behind was not for bravery or to fight.

When he found out the problem in Lu-er’s cultivation method, he had killing intent aroused toward Empyrean Ice Cloud.

Furthermore, in this Ice Cloud Tower, the ones who bullied Lu-er normally were not in the minority.

To Ye Yuan, Ice Cloud Tower already did not have the need to exist anymore.

It was just that these words sounded overly conceited in other people’s ears.

“Hahaha, you want to kill this Empyrean? Kid, I admit that you’re very strong, but you, a mere True God Realm, want to kill an Empyrean?” When Empyrean Ice Cloud heard that, she burst out laughing.

Everyone all shook their heads one after another, feeling that Ye Yuan was too ignorant.

He was indeed peerlessly talented. But wanting to kill an Empyrean, he was clearly not qualified enough yet.

In theory, that sword of Ye Yuan’s was sufficient to threaten Empyrean powerhouses.

It was just that these Empyreans were not fools either. Would they stand there and let Ye Yuan kill?

Moreover, that kind of horrifying sword, the consumption would definitely be tremendous. How many swords could Ye Yuan unleash?

Ye Yuan sighed slightly, a dark metal ball suddenly appearing in his hand. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“This thing was originally my final trump card, I didn’t want to use it easily. But today, in order to kill you, I can only use it.” When Ye Yuan was talking, he had a look of reluctance to part.

“Hahaha ... haha ... ha!” Empyrean Ice Cloud’s laughter gradually ceased, the expression on her face becoming extremely fascinating.

Not just her, after the other Empyreans saw that black ball, each and every one of their expressions became incomparably solemn.

Even Empyrean Windlike, the fury on his face also diminished considerably. At this time, there was more alarm and fear!

Clearly, he feared this black ball like a tiger.

“Heaven Shocking Lightning! This ... This is heavenly emperor level Heaven Shocking Lightning! You ... Why would you have this sort of thing?” Empyrean Ice Cloud cried out strangely. How was there still any of the former composure?

Currently, alarm and terror were written all over her face.

And the other Empyreans also unconsciously pulled apart the distance from her.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “Turns out that you all recognize this thing huh? Then I don’t need to do any explanations. Mn, just now, weren’t you all very fierce, wanting to uphold justice for Feng Tianyang’s death? That’s okay; I don’t mind. I welcome you all to come to find me to demand justice any time.”

All of the Empyrean’s faces turned black, nearly fainting in anger.

Demand justice my a*s! That’s Heaven Shocking Lightning!

Heavenly Emperor level Heaven Shocking Lightning!

Heaven Shocking Lightning was a one-time consumable. Inside sealed the power of a certain powerhouse’s one attack.

Once opened, it would be equivalent to that powerhouse’s all-out attack.

And Heaven Shocking Lightning had many different colors. Among them, the highest grade of Heaven Shocking Lightning was black, and it was refined with special methods. It was extremely hard to come across.

What was sealed inside was naturally the attack of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

If it was an empyrean level Heaven Shocking Lightning, everyone would not be at the extent of being so fearful.

After all, it was just the power of one strike. Furthermore, it was not executed by the caster themselves.

But, heavenly emperor level Heaven Shocking Lightning, how horrifying was the power?

This kind of Heaven Shocking Lightning, the materials required were extremely hard to come by. It was normally hard to chance upon.

Yet, Ye Yuan had one in his hands!

This was a deadly object!

Once Ye Yuan released the Heaven Shocking Lightning here, probably none of them, these Empyrean powerhouses, could survive!

The attack of a Heavenly Emperor shocked the heavens and earth!

In front of a Heavenly Emperor, all were ants!

This Heaven Shocking Lightning was obtained by Ye Yuan inside the Ancient God Battlefield’s Heavenly Emperor Crape Myrtle’s cave. Originally, it was used as his final trump card, to preserve his life.

Even when 100 thousand people besieged Heavenly Eagle back then, he also never used it.

But today, for Lu-er’s sake, he decided to use it.

This Empyrean Ice Cloud’s thoughts were extremely wicked. Not killing her, it was hard for Ye Yuan to dispel the hatred in his heart.

Thinking about everything that Ye Yuan suffered in these 1000 years, Ye Yuan’s heart ached faintly.

The Empyrean Windlike who was still clamoring about taking revenge just now, his expression was currently deathly white, without any imposing momentum at all.

Right now, Ye Yuan’s spearhead was clearly targeting Empyrean Ice Cloud. He did not wish to anger Ye Yuan and make Ye Yuan turn the spearhead to deal with him.

How could his fragile body bear it?

“Y-Ye Yuan, misunderstanding! It’s all a misunderstanding! You look, in any case, this Empyrean has also brought Lu-er up for so many years and imparted to her cultivation methods.” Empyrean Ice Cloud broke out in cold sweat, racking her brain to think of a plan to escape.

Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and said with a smile, “Misunderstanding? Huhu! Lu-er has followed me since young, and I couldn’t even bear to hit her once. You count for yourself, how much hardship has she suffered since she arrived at Ice Cloud Tower? Furthermore, in your eyes, she’s probably just a cultivation tool, right? Now, you’re telling me that it’s a misunderstanding?”

Empyrean Ice Cloud discovered that this Ye Yuan was too smart as if he was an old thing that had experienced many vicissitudes of life. How was he like a young man?

This kind of inferior quibbling had no way of fooling him at all.

Hence, she gritted her teeth and said in a stern voice, “Glazed Frost Grand Art, absorb for me!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

... ...

Those Ice Cloud Tower disciples all cried out miserably.

The divine essence in their bodies actually broke out of their bodies frenziedly, swarming over toward Empyrean Ice Cloud.

And Empyrean Ice Cloud’s aura was currently rising at a speed visible to the naked eye.
