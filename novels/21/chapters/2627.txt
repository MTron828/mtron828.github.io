Chapter 2633: Can You Reserve Three for Me?

After the Shangyu alliance meeting, the five great heavenly sects started mopping up.

However, the Pill Alliance’s withdrawal was also within expectations.

As if overnight, all of the Pill Alliance’s forces became devoid of people.

Having orders executed without fail like this, it also made the five great sect masters secretly heighten their vigilance.

This Pill Alliance was not simple!

The Pill Pavilion officially went into operations and recruited disciples with the name of the five great heavenly sects.

Ye Yuan was the first Pill Pavilion’s pavilion lord, his status equivalent to the five great heavenly sects’ sect masters!

For some time, the Pill Pavilion’s limelight had no equal.

Very soon, Ye Yuan published a series of measures and established a complete set of measures within the boundary of the Five Light Heavenly Region, replacing the gap left behind by the Pill Alliance’s withdrawal.

With regards to this set of measures, Ye Yuan was long already very accustomed to this due to his past experiences when in the Lower Realms.

So when he executed it, it went very smoothly.

And these measures also gained instant results, letting the Pill Pavilion gain a firm foothold very quickly.

The status of the Pill Pavilion was established swiftly and it also made the five great sect masters and each sect’s elders secretly speechless, marveling at Ye Yuan’s ability to be in control.

Different from the Pill Alliance’s cherishing of their own belongings, the Pill Pavilion was completely open-style.

Firstly, the five great heavenly sects’ heavenly alchemists could browse the Pill Pavilion’s pill formulas and heavenly medicine techniques unconditionally.

As for some of the other factions’ heavenly alchemists, after confirming their loyalty, it would also be released to varying degrees.

In fact, Ye Yuan even invited the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s formation master, cracking the few pieces of jade slips that Zhong Jianchou left behind, sharing it to the Pill Pavilion.

With regards to the five great heavenly sects’ valuable pill formulas, heavenly medicine techniques, and such, Ye Yuan carried out a tidying-up effort and consolidating them, and categorizing them into different classes.

It was equivalent to establishing the cultivation system of ascender heavenly alchemists anew.

His series of moves made the heavenly alchemists prostrate on all fours in admiration.

Very soon, Ye Yuan gained extremely high prestige among these heavenly alchemists.

In addition, the appearance of the Pill Pavilion also made the five great heavenly sects band up together tightly.

All of these changes made the five great heavenly sects take on a completely new outlook.

In the ninth year, Wu Chengchao broke through to Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum, becoming the third grade four heavenly alchemist of the five great heavenly sects!

And at this time, there was still over one year left from the 20-year deadline that Ye Yuan had once said.

No one in the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect from top to bottom dared to criticize or comment anymore.

Even Shi Feiyu and Head Elder also shut their mouths sensibly.

As for Han Qianyun, he even had his position of protector taken away by the sect, his cultivation sealed. He was detained at the Remorse Cliff, disciplining him as a warning!

By the 20th year, three more people broke through to grade four heavenly alchemist consecutively!

The Pill Pavilion’s grade four heavenly alchemist grew to as many as six people all at once.

As for grade three and grade two heavenly alchemists, a blowout-style eruption also emerged.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s influence on the Pill Pavilion already gradually formed an effect.

It seemed as if the Five Light Heavenly Region had entered a period of revitalization, everything was moving towards prosperity.

But, it was also right at this time, that there was a sudden turn of events!

Apart from the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect, the other four major sects were being continuously harassed by the four great heavenly regions.

The frontier area was in constant chaos.

Very clearly, the four great heavenly regions could not hold back anymore.

“Sect Master, I said it long ago, can’t do things like this! At least, can’t shed all pretenses of cordiality with the Pill Alliance for the time being! Now, I hit the mark, right? That bullshit Pill Pavilion seems to be doing really well, but until now, they can’t bring out a decent heavenly pill! The heavenly pills that Qu Yan refined are still significantly worse when compared to the Pill Alliance’s heavenly pills!?Heh,?I want to see how that boy gets through it when the time comes!” In Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s main hall, Duan Yongchun said with a sneer on his face.

With the four great heavenly regions launching an attack at the same time, the border hostilities were intensified.

As the central sect Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect, it was naturally impossible to look on with folded arms.

At this time, the various great elders were gathered here to discuss this matter.

But since the beginning, Duan Yongchun already pointed the spearhead at Ye Yuan, feeling that this matter was entirely caused by him.

Even after 20 years had passed, he was still an advocate of peace.

Of course, this was also because the quality of the grade four heavenly pills that Qu Yan they all refined kept failing to improve.

When it reached grade four heavenly pill this level, how could wanting to improve by a little be that easy?

And this also gave Duan Yongchun a handle for gossip.

With Duan Yongchun jumping like this, Yang Jie was very irritated too.

The results that the Pill Pavilion had obtained, that was obvious to all.

As long as the Pill Pavilion was given enough time, the Pill Pavilion would definitely be able to reach the point where they could contend with the Pill Alliance.

Yet, Duan Yongchun this fellow was indifferent to it!

Yang Jie said impatiently, “Elder Duan, it’s only been 20 years! Do you think that grooming heavenly alchemists is like kids playing house? Let alone, it’s grade four heavenly alchemist!”

Duan Yongchun smiled coldly and said, “It’s indeed not playing house, but now, the Pill Alliance won’t give us time! I want to ask Sect Master; once a full-scale war is launched, with our five great heavenly sects’ current strength, can we be the four great heavenly region’s match? Let alone that there’s even a Pill Alliance casting covetous eyes at the back!”

The matter this time, no need to guess and one would also know that it was the Pill Alliance manipulating at the back.

In reality, the five great sect masters were all secretly shocked.

They did not expect that the Pill Alliance’s power and influence actually already had such a deep influence!

At present, the four great heavenly regions’ various major sects were in an even greater state of disunity.

For the Pill Alliance to be able to consolidate the four great heavenly regions together, it served to show the terror of its strength.

The five great sect masters were also greatly troubled because of this.

Got to admit, Duan Yongchun’s words struck Yang Jie’s sore spot.

Seeing Yang Jie keep quiet, Duan Yongchun sneered even harder and said, “If we did it according to what I originally had in mind, the five sects pretending to be polite and compliant with the Pill Alliance first, after an even more talented powerhouse rises, he’ll be able to replicate Lord Zhuo’s miracle back then! But now, the Pill Alliance won’t give us the chance anymore!”

“Enough! Elder Duan, since you look down on the Pill Pavilion so much, then if you have the capabilities, don’t take a single one of the Pill Pavilion’s heavenly pills in the future!” Yang Jie said angrily.

Duan Yongchun laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Sect Master, don’t you worry! I’ve never taken a single one of the Pill Pavilion’s heavenly pills before in the past! In the future, I definitely won’t take a single one as well! My meaning is still this; Hand Ye Yuan over, and exchange for temporary peace!”

Yang Jie was just about to fly off the handle, but a subordinate came to report.

The Pill Pavilion sent people to deliver a large batch of heavenly pills over!

The person escorting the heavenly pills was precisely Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s grade four heavenly alchemist, Qu Yan!

“Elder Qu, have you been well?” Seeing Qu Yan, Yang Jie had an excited look too.

After Qu Yan bowed, he smiled and said, “Many thanks for Sect Master’s concern. This old man is very well! This time, I was entrusted by Pavilion Lord to escort a batch of heavenly pills over, and I want the sect to send troops to support the four sects!”

Hearing this, Duan Yongchun laughed coldly.

But Yang Jie’s eyes flashed, and he asked,?“Oh??I wonder what Pavilion Lord Ye has done this time?”

Qu Yan smiled and said, “Pavilion Lord Ye personally took action this time! Even this old man hasn’t seen him take action for more than ten years too! The moment he made a move, it’s earth-shattering!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qu Yan’s words made Yang Jie’s mind quiver.

Yang Jie received the list and took a look and could not help drawing a cold breath.

“True grade Fire Unicorn Heavenly Pill, 50 of them! True grade True Marrow Heavenly Pill, 50! True grade Primordial Star Astral Pill, 30 …” Yang Jie recited the names from the list. The expressions of the elders present changed one after another.

All true grade pills!

Duan Yongchun’s face alternated between red and green, appearing extremely conflicted.

Suddenly, he seemed to have made up his mind. Opening his mouth, he said, “Sect Master, that … the Primordial Star Astral Pills, can you reserve three for me?”
