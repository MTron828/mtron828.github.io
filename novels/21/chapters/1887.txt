Chapter 1891: Don’t Know How to Cherish

The old man knew that who Ye Yuan was asking was not him, but Wu Tian.

He was merely an attendant, although his cultivation realm was high, his status was clearly inferior to Wu Tian.

“Young Master Tian is Nine Pledge Imperial Capital, Linghua Pavilion’s disciple. His master is Linghua Pavilion’s ...”

The old man said halfway and was cut off coldly by Ye Yuan: “”Looks like my warning had no use!”

“ARGHH!!”

A shrill scream emitted from Wu Tian’s mouth.

His leg was already broken by Ye Yuan.

The old man’s face changed. He brought up Wu Tian’s master because he wanted to make Ye Yuan scared.

Who knew that this fellow did not yield to this at all, directly crippling Wu Tian.

Wu Tian hurt until cold sweat covered his forehead. But Ye Yuan’s hand was still clutched extremely tightly.

How could the old man still dare to take any chances? He could only say, “Young Master Tian he ... took fancy on a maiden in Cloudjade Imperial City. Hence ... that’s why he would come here to assume the post of patrolling inspector.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he asked again, “If he came to be the patrolling inspector, why would Jiang Jadehall be thrown into a death cell?”

The old man said, “Because ... he didn’t know how to appreciate favors.”

When Ye Yuan heard this, his expression turned cold and he said, “Jiang Jadehall wasn’t willing to hand over the position of patrolling inspector, so you guys plotted to frame him, throwing him into a death cell, is that right?”

The old man was silent. Clearly, it was guessed correctly by Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Very good, you can go and die already!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan was about to take action to kill Wu Tian.

Wu Tian and the old man’s face both changed drastically, not expecting that Ye Yuan was actually so vicious, wanting to kill people directly.

At this time, Zuo Shujie suddenly spoke up, “Ye Yuan, you mustn’t!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, the force in his hand reducing a little.

Zuo Shujie struggled to come before Ye Yuan, saying with an ugly expression, “Patrolling Inspector Wu’s master is a True God powerhouse, the Wu Family’s status in Nine Pledge Imperial Capital is also extraordinary. Killing him, the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City will have to be buried in death with him!”

Cold sweat poured from Wu Tian’s head, gritting his teeth as he said, “Yes, yes! I can’t die, if I were to die, Linghua Pavilion will surely be enraged! As ... As long as you let me go, today’s matter ... I’ll take it as if nothing happened.”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, fingers slowly loosening up.

He could act recklessly and care for nobody by himself, but Heavenly Eagle Imperial City had so many people, he was more or less still somewhat wary of involving good people.

The moment Ye Yuan’s fingers let go, Wu Tian shot away like lightning. This Ye Yuan’s strength was too terrifying.

“Wu Yun, kill him for me! Also, these few, leave none behind!” Wu Tian pointed at the Zuo Shujie, Ning Tianping, and the rest behind Ye Yuan and said with an angry roar.

The faces of Zuo Shujie and the rest could not help changing drastically when they heard it. He did not expect that Wu Tian actually turned hostile so quickly.

If not for them pleading for mercy, Ye Yuan would have already killed Wu Tian. But in a blink of an eye, Wu Tian was going to kill them.

The Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity Wu Yun, who here was his match?

“Humph! Reckless and blind think, to actually dare make a move on Young Master Tian! Today, I’ll have you die without a burial ground!”

The moment the aura of an Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity was released, everyone’s faces changed.

That horrifying world power made Zuo Shujie and the rest had looks of despair.

“Patrolling Inspector Wu, this ... this is all a misunderstanding! Hope that Lord Patrolling Inspector can lift your hand high up in mercy and let Ye Yuan go! How he offended you, I, Zuo Shujie, will shoulder it alone!” Zuo Shujie said decisively.

Wu Tian burst into laughter when he heard it and said, “This punk actually dared to break this envoy’s leg. He already committed a capital crime! What qualifications do you, a measly Second Firmament Celestial Deity, have to shoulder it? Today, all of you have to die!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly. Looking at Wu Tian, he said coolly, “I already gave you the chance, it was you who didn’t know how to cherish it.”

“Hahaha! Chance? Brat, if it wasn’t for you ambushing this envoy just now, would this envoy be threatened by you? With Wu Yun around, can you still overturn the heavens? Do it!” Wu Tian seemed to have heard a very hilarious joke, laughing wildly as he said.

A cold light flashed, a streak of terrifying sword light rushed toward Ye Yuan.

The power of an Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity was extremely shocking.

At this time, Zuo Shujie and the rest were standing behind Ye Yuan. As long as he moved aside, Zuo Shujie and the rest would definitely die without a doubt.

This Wu Yun was clearly someone who had a wealth of battle experience, rather vicious when attacking.

This sword was forcing Ye Yuan to meet the attack head-on.

Ye Yuan’s expression turned slightly dark, the Frostcounter Sword suddenly making a move.

Bang!

A loud bang exploded between the two people. The horrifying energy immediately sent Zuo Shujie and the rest flying.

“All of you back away!” Ye Yuan’s voice exuded iciness.

Clearly, he was already genuinely enraged.

Wu Yun’s pupils also constricted as he cried out in surprise, “Laws fusion! Spatial law!”

He never would have dreamed that Ye Yuan could actually receive this sword of his.

Wu Tian’s expression also became incomparably ugly. He originally thought that Ye Yuan was not capable of lasting one exchange with Wu Yun at all. He did not expect that his combat strength was actually so fearsome.

A Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity evenly matching an Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity, this was a little too exaggerated, right?

Zuo Shujie and the rest looked at that familiar, yet unfamiliar figure, shocked to the core.

Ye Yuan’s strength was still so powerful.

But it was a little ridiculously strong!

Several hundred years ago, Ye Yuan was merely a second-rate junior in his eyes.

Just how many years had passed?

Ye Yuan’s current strength, making a round trip around the Southridge Ten Nations, he also could not find a match at all!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure moved slightly, his sword drawing out. That swift and fierce sword energy virtually made space shudder.

Wu Yun’s eyes turned slightly dark, directly meeting it.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In midair, a series of horrifying energy undulations came over.

Cold light radiated in all directions, sword energy scattering everywhere.

When Wu Tian saw this scene, his complexion turned pale.

“Young Master Tian, this brat is so strong. Lord Wu Yun might not be able to take him down. Why don’t ... we retreat first!” Mo Xin spoke up.

“Shut up! Do you want this young master to be a cowardly turtle? If this were to spread back to the imperial capital, how will this young master still have face to meet people?” Wu Tian said angrily.

Mo Xin said anxiously, “As long as the green hills remain, there will be no shortage of firewood! If this brat really wins, we won’t have a possibility of escaping anymore!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wu Tian’s expression changed again and again. Finally, he gritted his teeth and said, “Go!”

He never dreamed that his first day coming to the Southridge Ten Nations to be the patrolling inspector, he would have to tuck his tail and run.

The two people were just about to escape through the void and leave when a beautiful figure blocked the two people’s path.

A peerless face unfolded in front of Wu Tian. But he was not in the mood to admire it at all currently.

Because this woman’s aura was similarly very strong!

Leng Qiuling’s strength was also Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity.

“You guys can’t leave!” Leng Qiuling said coolly.

“Damn it!” Wu Tian gritted his teeth and suddenly attacked Leng Qiuling.

Leng Qiuling was long prepared. Ice and fire, two powers of law, gushed out, making Wu Tian’s face change drastically.

Although Wu Tian was strong too, compared to the Leng Qiuling who refined the Vermilion Bird true blood, he was far too lacking.

The two people’s realms were on par, but Leng Qiuling’s strength completely suppressed Wu Tian.

Right at this time, an incomparably swift and fierce sword light tore through the sky. Wu Yun’s corpse dropped down from high up in the sky, falling heavily onto the ground.

The entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was deathly still.
