Chapter 1708 How Can You Be So Strong?

“Humph! Do you think that you can scare me with a few words?” Jian Ping said with a grim expression.No idea why, after Ye Yuan said this, his eyes actually started to itch a little. No idea whether was it a psychological effect or not.

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “Don’t you know that the ones who can’t be offended the most are alchemists? I can treat you, so naturally, I can cure you to death too.”

By the side, Jian Yu suddenly said rather nervously, “Big Brother, Zhang Haotian was indeed poisoned by the Flatland Poison Wolf’s poison. But I saw just now that his severed limb actually regrew! It ... It should be real!”

Jian Ping’s expression changed. His eyes were becoming even more unbearably itchy, and he could not resist rubbing it twice.

Ye Yuan smiled when he saw the situation and said, “Now, can we discuss the next transaction?”

Jian Ping’s face fell and he said, “What do you want?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Bring me to see Elder Jian!”

Jian Ping’s expression was grim until it was virtually about to drip water. This kid simply drove people nuts.

You clearly already cornered him, yet, you had to be counter-bitten by him.

He actually still had to be at his mercy in his own lair!

This foul breath backlogged in his heart really made people uncomfortable!

But he had no choice but to hold it in.

The Flatland Poison Wolf’s poison was famed for being bone-infesting, overwhelming people with distress. It tormented people the most. Furthermore, it was extremely difficult to remove.

His eye area was poisoned. In the future, he might very likely become a blind man again!

Ye Yuan being able to cleanse poison, he did not doubt it at all.

He could even cure Heavenly Dao backlash, so this bit of poison was naturally nothing.

But bringing him to go see Jian Zhentao just like this, he was also unwilling in his heart.

Really a painful decision!

Finally, Jian Ping gritted his teeth and said, “Consider yourself ruthless!”

...

Jian Ping led Ye Yuan to a very small house and said in a solemn voice, “This is it!”

Ye Yuan looked at this house and could not help being somewhat stunned.

A ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord, to an imperial city, their status was very lofty.

However, Jian Zhentao was actually staying in such a tiny house. It was seriously shabby!

Seemed like these few years, Jian Zhentao probably suffered quite a bit of ostracism.

Ye Yuan walked to the door, mustered up divine essence, and said in a clear voice, “Junior Ye Yuan, request an audience with Senior Jian Zhentao.”

Before long, an aged voice came from inside. “Huhu, I was wondering who it was. Turns out that it’s Little Friend Ye Yuan. Please, come in!”

Clearly, Jian Zhentao also thought for a long time before recalling who Ye Yuan was.

What surprised Ye Yuan a little was that Jian Zhentao did not have the least bit of resentment in his voice, as if he was an old friend that he had not met for many years.

One had to know, Jian Zhentao ending up in such a plight was entirely thanks to Ye Yuan.

Even though Ye Yuan did not do anything, how many in this world were truly able to let it go? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

If it were others, they were most likely going to blame this on them.

Ye Yuan did not think that Jian Zhentao was actually so open-minded.

“Now, you can get rid of the poison for me, right?” Jian Ping said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan casually threw out a medicinal pill and said coolly, “Take it and eat.”

Jian Ping received the medicinal pill and said in a cold voice, “On what basis should I trust you?”

Ye Yuan said, “Do you think that everyone in this world is as shameless as you? If you don’t believe, you can naturally find someone better qualified.”

As he said, Ye Yuan was about to push the door and enter.

Right at this time, a hint of cold light flashed in Jian Ping’s eyes and he suddenly launched an attack!

Another sneak attack!

This palm was quick as lightning. Jian Ping erupted with his full power, wanting to kill Ye Yuan with one palm.

“Nirvana Seal!”

What answered him was a powerful seal art!

Ye Yuan’s back seemed to have grown eyes, suddenly hitting out a seal.

Rumble!

A massive rumble transmitted over. Jian Ping’s entire person flew out backward, spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood with a cough.

He looked at Ye Yuan, his eyes full of shock.

How could a second-layered heaven Divine Lord possibly send him flying with one seal mark?

After so many years, Ye Yuan expended God knows how many medicinal pills and finally forcefully pushed his realm to the second-layered heaven Divine Vortex Realm.

He’s current strength could already rival fifth-layered heaven Divine Lords and not fall into a disadvantageous situation.

The moment the Nirvana Seal emerged, who could contend!

Jian Ping’s unwillingness in his heart, how could Ye Yuan not perceive it? He had long guarded against Jian Ping.

The Nirvana Seal against Jian Ping’s ordinary palm, it was without any suspense.

“Impossible! You ... How can you be so strong?” Jian Ping said in disbelief.

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Ping coldly and said, “I said it before, if you weren’t a member of the Profound Secrets Pavilion, you’d long be a dead man already! Do you think that I’d be so patient to deal with a trash like you? Get lost!”

Jian Ping crawled to his feet, gnashed his teeth in hatred as he looked at Ye Yuan and said, “Punk, just you wait for me! Opposing me, Jian Ping, you’ll get to know the outcome soon!”

Finished talking, Jian Ping clutched his wound and ran away.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed.

Ning Tianping also frowned and said, “Your Excellency, this Jian Ping’s background is deep, I’m afraid ...”

How could Ye Yuan not know that Jian Ping had a deep background? Otherwise, with his temper, he would have long killed him.

But on this trip, he was asking help from the profound secrets pavilion. Unless it was a last resort, he did not wish to fall out with the other party.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “When soldiers come, use a general to hold them off. When the water rises, use dirt to keep it back. Go in.”

Pushing the door and entering, the house was not large. But Ye Yuan seemed to have entered a small farmyard.

Inside the small yard, flowers and plants were planted everywhere, refreshing and delightful.

An old man was currently clearing the weeds.

In this bustling city, there was actually a feeling of relaxing vigilance, being like clouds without a fixed abode.

This old man was naturally Jian Zhentao.

“Not seeing for 200 years, has Little Friend Ye Yuan been well?” Jian Zhentao put down the hoe and said to Ye Yuan with a smile.

It was just that that pair of eyes were still tightly shut.

He was slightly astonished in his heart. He could clearly sense two people’s auras. One of them was a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord, the other ... he actually could not see through.

As if ... it was a stretch of chaos.

The divine essence undulation outside just now, he clearly felt it too.

That was the showdown between two fifth-layered heaven Divine Lords. No matter how good Ye Yuan’s talent was, it was also not possible to be a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord’s match currently.

Hence, he did not pay attention either.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Junior hasn’t been doing well. Haven’t I come to request help from Senior?”

Jian Zhentao was somewhat surprised as he said, “Oh? What’s the matter?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “My matter isn’t in a rush. Rather, Senior’s otherworldly and idle days made Ye Yuan very surprised!”

Jian Zhentao stroked his beard and smiled as he said, “Do you feel that this old man should be dispirited and eking out a miserable existence right now, waiting to die?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Huhu, it was Ye Yuan who judged with the yardstick of a petty man! Senior’s breadth of mind is extensive, Ye Yuan admires!”

Jian Zhentao smiled and said, “What you said is right too! Our two eyes hold extraordinary meaning to our Jian family members. Losing our two eyes is equivalent to exhausting our future. But later on, this old man gradually thought things through. Hence, I lived this kind of reclusive life. Presently, I gradually understood something.”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up and he said in surprise, “Senior actually ... touched the threshold of Celestial Deity Realm!”

Jian Zhentao nodded and smiled as he said, “These few years, I’ve indeed had some comprehension. But to talk about breaking through, I likely still need some more time.”
