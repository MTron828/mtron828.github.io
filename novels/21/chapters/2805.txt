“Brother Ye, you’re back!”

“Brother Ye, this battle was all thanks to you. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to come back!

“It was all us who were blind previously. Be magnanimous and don’t take offense at us!”

‘When Ye Yuan appeared in the Northern View City’s army base, there was immediately a commotion.

‘When those Saint Sovereign Heaven soldiers saw Ye Yuan, they came up to say hello one after another.

Among them, there were many people who were mocking Ye Yuan on that day. At this time, they were regretting it immensely.

This time, if not for Ye Yuan, most likely only a handful of them would have been able to return.

In fact, Northern View City might have directly been steamrolled by the blood race.

A rout was like a landslide. It was not to be made a joke.

Ye Yuan did not put on airs either, responding with smiles one by one.

‘When these Saint Sovereign Heavens saw this, they were even more ashamed.

Ye Yuan really had a mind as open as a valley!

“B-Brother Ye .. Zhao Chen saw Ye Yuan, the look of embarrassment on his face becoming even stronger.

Before the great battle, his words were the nastiest.

But now, his face was slapped resoundingly.

‘When he saw Ye Yuan, there was naturally indescribable embarrassment.

“Yoo, isn’t this Centurion Zhao? Our Master Ye is merely a foreigner. How can we dare call you our brother?” When Big Yellow saw Zhao Chen, his anger flared up, and he immediately jeered.

Zhao Chen’s expression immediately became black as the bottom of a pot.

With regards to this, Ye Yuan did not say anything either.

Back then, Zhao Chen’s words were indeed very nasty. His contempt for him was not only expressed in words, but also on the face.

Zhao Chen clearly looked down on Ye Yuan, this kind of foreigners, especially when Ye Yuan got involved with the Extreme Medicine Sect.

That sort of contempt was impossible to hide. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In reality, those who had this kind of notion were not in the minority.

It was also that it was currently wartime. Normally, the status of Ye Yuan, this kind of foreigner, would be very low in Heaven One Continent.

Just like in the Rainclear Continent, the native forces discriminated against ascenders.

Ye Yuan did not know to make trouble, but it did not mean that he was submissive.

suddenly, Zhao Chen directly knelt in front of Ye Yuan with a thud and said, “Master Ye, it was all my fault previously! I know that you have great abilities. You must have the means to save my men! They’re inflicted with the blood corruption poison. I beg you to save them!”

Ineach great battle, those who got inflicted with blood corruption poison were not in the minority.

Even Song Miao, this True Sovereign Heaven, was poisoned by the blood corruption poison; let alone these Saint Sovereign Heavens.

Zhao Chen’s men originally had many who were inflicted with blood corruption poison.

In this battle, the blood corruption poison erupted all-round. His men suffered heavy casualties.

Over 70% of these remaining people were inflicted with blood corruption poison.

If these people all died, he would practically become a lone general without an army.

Of course, although Zhao Chen this person was very mean to Ye Yuan and looked down on Ye Yuan’s background, he treated his men as his own brothers.

For the sake of these subordinates, he would rather put aside his dignity and kneel down to Ye Yuan.

Even Song Miao, this True Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, knelt down; what was wrong with him, this measly little centurion, kneeling?

But Big Yellow did not buy it and said with a cold smile, “Yoo, Lord Zhao, don’t do this! Master Ye is merely someone with half-baked knowledge. The Extreme Medicine Sect is the authority. Did you find the wrong person? You should be going to find the Extreme Medicine Sect!”

By the side, Dao Chen wished to find a hole in the ground to tunnel into.

He was sent over to learn from Ye Yuan. Along with him, there were also dozens of grade five and grade six heavenly alchemists.

Close to 100 military doctors were deployed to Heaven One army.

These military doctors were mainly from the Extreme Medicine Sect.

In fact, Dao Chen was a distinguished talent among them.

Before this, he was a highly respected Extreme Medicine Sect disciple.

But, after this battle, his status completely changed.

The current Dao Chen was like a big villain who had harmed nearly ten thousand troops.

It was them who did not listen to Ye Yuan’s words, resulting in this great defeat.

If not for the Extreme Medicine Sect pledging in all solemnity, even if those soldiers who were inflicted with blood corruption poison did not take part in the fights, this war would not have been defeated so thoroughly too.

In this battle, those soldiers who were inflicted with blood corruption poison were like time bombs lying in ambush on their side, blowing up and injuring all of them at once.

‘When Zhao Chen heard, he clenched his jaws tightly and suddenly kowtowed to Ye Yuan fiercely.

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Each sound struck everyone’s heart.

“Master Ye, this Zhao acted like a stuck-up snob, but my brothers are all good men! As long as you can save them, this Zhao is willing to pay it off with death!” Zhao Chen wept tearfully as he kowtowed.

All around, many people shed silent tears.

In this battle, many of their companions died on the battlefield.

The former fellow officers were no more together.

But no one dared to step forward to speak up for Zhao Chen. It was because they were indeed too unfair to Ye Yuan previously.

Someone who made great contributions came to their army and said something that could tum the tides. But in the end, he was looked down upon by everyone.

If it were them, they would not be able to stand it too.

Goodwill being taken for granted was probably like this!

Everyone’s gazes looked toward Ye Yuan.

suddenly, Ye Yuan raised his hand and patted Zhao Chen on the shoulder twice and said, “Alright, take me to go take a look at your subordinates.”

Zhao Chen’s entire body shook, and he kowtowed a few more times agitatedly and said, “Thank you so much, Master Ye! Thank you so much, Master Ye!”

‘When Ye Yuan saw Zhao Chen’s men, he could not refrain from furrowing his brows too.

Too awful!

Some people’s blood corruption poison was extremely deep, their entire person being already riddled full of holes, looking extremely hideous.

A foul smell greeted the nose.

Weak groaning sounds filled the tent.

Blood corruption poison was extremely terrifying. Even the final outcome of Song Miao, this True Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, was no better than these Saint Sovereign Heaven soldiers.

Not only could this corrupt blood affect one’s blood, but it could also even corrode the origin divinity, and there was virtually no cure.

The only thing that could resist it was just true spirit bloodline!

Therefore, after the Extreme Medicine Sect’s suppression method was devised, it was a great boon to the Heaven One army.

As for the words of Ye Yuan, this kind of minor character, they naturally could not take it in.

It was not that Ye Yuan was even more impressive than the Extreme Medicine Sect, this Hegemon level holy land.

But that even a clever wife could not cook a meal without rice. They had fought with the blood race for thousands of years but never obtained a drop of the blood race’s blood essence before.

Ye Yuan came beside the soldier who was poisoned the deepest and started diagnosing him.

Very soon, Ye Yuan’s origin divinity traveled a circulatory cycle within his body, and he could not help secretly shaking his head.

“M-Master Ye, is there still hope for ... Qiao Yiping?* Zhao Chen asked worriedly.

“All the blood in his body has already been corrupted by more than 90%. In at most a few hours, he will definitely die beyond a doubt,” Ye Yuan said.

Zhao Chen’s expression dimmed, blaming himself heavily in his heart.

This scene was taken into Ye Yuan’s sights, and his impression of Zhao Chen changed a little.

This guy looked down on him, this kind of foreigners. But his feelings for his fellow officers were not fake.

Ye Yuan ignored him but said to Dao Chen and the rest, “You all watch carefully. This needle technique that I’ll be performing next is called Xuanji Nine Leaves. After you guys leam it, apply the technique on the others. But at present, this needle technique can only temporarily suppress the blood corruption

poison. As for whether or not it can really purge the blood corruption poison, I still need to research more..”
