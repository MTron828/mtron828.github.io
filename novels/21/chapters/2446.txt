Chapter 2452: Goodness Me, Got Swindled!

These eight god statues in front of him seemed to have a kind of magical power.

Ye Yuan looked at them and had a feeling of facing the Heavenspan Mountain.

Strong!

Ridiculously strong!

What was the origin of these eight god statues?

If not for Ye Yuan having the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, he would not have been able to resist the powerful pressure of these eight god statues at all, and would have long surrendered!

One had to know, even when Ye Yuan was facing the nine great Dao Ancestors, he did not employ the power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!

These eight god statues were incredibly mysterious.

Ye Yuan ignored Tian Qing but sized the eight god statues up hard.

These idols were definitely the key to solving the problem with Li-er!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan stepped forward and walked over toward the first idol.

This idol was incomparably ferocious, an appearance of baring its fangs and brandishing its claws. Its right hand was even holding a fork, giving people an extremely dangerous feeling.

Ye Yuan walked in step by step, the power of that idol also became greater and greater.

Especially the expression on the idol, it seemed to have changed, becoming unbelievably angry.

He seemed to feel that this ant in front of him, actually dared to be impudent in front of him!

Tian Qing watched this scene calmly and did not stop it.

Yue Mengli frowned a little and said, “Lord Tian Qing, he ...”

Tian Qing extended his hand to interrupt Yue Mengli’s words and said coolly, “I know what you want to say, and also know that you still have feelings for him. But this is his own choice! Furthermore, although this ancestor isn’t afraid of him, I also don’t wish for the human race to have an existence that can rival this ancestor to appear! Do you understand?”

Yue Mengli’s face revealed a reluctant look and closed both eyes in pain.

Although she firmly believed that she was a member of the divine race, being completely devoted to the divine race, her nature was not wiped out.

She was still that Yue Mengli.

She still loved Ye Yuan deeply.

It was just that she knew Ye Yuan’s character, it was impossible to defect to the divine race for her.

And it was also impossible for her to return to the human race because of Ye Yuan.

Therefore, she chose to restrain her feelings.

But, when Ye Yuan faced life and death, she still could not bear it.

Ye Yuan approached step by step, the entire hall was trembling.

Furthermore, the trembling grew stronger and stronger!

Ye Yuan had the help of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and did not fear the coercion of the idol at all.

Facing the coercion of the eight idols, the Tai Chi diagram faintly lit up behind him, and was actually trying to fight back!

But the more so, the stronger the reaction of the eight idols.

Even the expression on Tian Qing’s face also became solemn as he said with a frown, “This brat actually still has the strength to fight back in front of the eight gods! However, he dares to provoke the eight gods, there’s only a road that leads to death!”

That was right. Ye Yuan was provoking the eight idols!

Wanting to figure out the secret of the god statues, ordinary methods were definitely useless. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Therefore, Ye Yuan wanted to see just what the hell these eight idols were!

It was just that this scene was tantamount to playing with fire and burning oneself in the view of Tian Qing and the others.

The closer he got, the more Ye Yuan felt the terrifying pressure.

The eight idols were clearly already furious to the extreme.

The entire great hall’s trembling became even more intense.

Rumble ...

Suddenly, the eight idols emitted a dazzling light at the same time, illuminating the entire great hall like daytime.

An enormous vortex condensed and formed above the great hall.

A powerful to the extreme suction force suddenly appeared.

Ye Yuan’s physical body did not have many abnormalities. But his divine soul was actually going to leave his body involuntarily.

Ye Yuan’s heart shook greatly, wanting to teleport away.

However, this suction force was too terrifying, he could not teleport at all.

With this, it really stabbed the hornet’s nest!

The power of these eight idols, they were much stronger than he imagined.

When Tian Qing saw this scene, he could not help opening his mouth wide.

It was still his first time seeing that the idols would be so enraged.

As for the three of them, they did not feel much.

The divine race had long already unified spirit and body, this vortex did not target them.

However, Yue Mengli’s expression changed wildly, her figure moved, about to go over and save Ye Yuan.

Previously, she did not save because she knew that Ye Yuan had the ability to protect himself.

But now, she could not continue watching anymore.

However, a powerful suction came whistling from the rear, she was actually unable to move an inch forward anymore.

Tian Qing did not allow her to take action!

“Lord Tian Qing!” Yue Mengli turned around and glared.

Tian Qing was unmoved and said coolly, “Do you want to disobey the Eight Extreme Divinities?”

Eight Extreme Divinities was the name of these eight idols.

Yue Mengli had a conflicted look, looking towards Ye Yuan in pain.

While over there, Ye Yuan also saw this scene earlier, and the corners of his mouth could not help revealing a hint of a smile.

Indeed, Li-er’s heart had not changed!

With this, it was enough!

Although he encountered a dangerous situation, Ye Yuan did not regret it.

He could forget his own safety and brave dangers for Mu Lingxue. So he could naturally also throw away his life for Li-er.

Very soon, Ye Yuan’s divine soul was forcefully pulled out of his physical body like plucking a carrot.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s divine soul was akin to a wild horse that ran away and was sucked into the vortex in a blink of an eye.

After this, everything returned to tranquility.

Ye Yuan’s physical body was standing there, motionless.

Two rows of clear tears fell down from the corners of Yue Mengli’s eyes.

She fell to the ground softly. It was as if all of her strength was drained.

“Hahaha ... dead! This damn brat is finally dead! Provoking the lord divinities? This serves him right!” But when Celestial Master Miluo saw this scene, he let out a wild laugh.

He was previously toyed with by Ye Yuan until he was confused and disoriented.

Ten billion years of humiliation, but it was still humiliation to this day.

But now, he was taken care of by the Eight Extreme Divinities, how could he not be delighted?

Even Tian Qing also spat out a turbid breath slightly, as if he was relieved of a heavy burden.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s existence still gave him tremendous pressure.

Now that Ye Yuan was dead, he could finally make a move against the human race without worrying.

“Miluo, destroy his physical body. It’s also considered to have drawn a conclusion to your ten billion years of humiliation,” Tian Qing slowly said.

“Heh heh, alright!” Celestial Master Miluo said with a sinister smile.

These ten billion years of torture made him become a little neurotic.

Now that he had this opportunity, he had a morbid pleasure.

He walked towards Ye Yuan step by step, a hint of cruelty at the corners of his mouth.

Ye Yuan’s head was slumped, still maintaining the same posture as before, motionless.

Celestial Master Miluo got closer and closer and turned his palm up. A powerful force rolled in the palm of his hand.

With this palm landing, Ye Yuan’s physical body would probably be shattered.

“Jeje, brat, who asked you to show off! Is Saint Azure very impressive? My divine race is the race favored by heaven! You provoked the Eight Extreme Divinities, it’s angering heaven! How can heaven tolerate you? Go and die!”

While laughing strangely, Celestial Master Miluo’s palm fell down, smacking toward Ye Yuan’s head.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly turned his head.

There was a grayish-white color in his eyes!

Celestial Master Miluo originally came in a threatening manner, but currently, he jumped greatly in fright.

He really jumped up!

“Goodness me, god swindled!” Celestial Master Miluo cried out strangely and hurriedly jumped away.

Tian Qing’s expression changed and looked at Ye Yuan in shock as he exclaimed, “This ... What in the world is going on?”
