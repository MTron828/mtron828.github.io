1418 Domineering Subjugation!

The group of elders had baffled looks, exchanging glances.

Who was this? He had a problem with his brain, right?

Who the hell were you? You said disagree and we would follow your words?

What has it got to do with you?!

“Bai Chen, manage the men under you properly! I know that you have grievances in your heart, but you have to put the interests of the whole above all else. Right now isn’t the time to throw tantrums!”

“Yeah! Where did this brat pop out from? To actually dare talk drivel here!”

The group of elders all turned the spearhead at Bai Chen. After all, they could not see through Ye Yuan’s depths at all and even thought that Ye Yuan was deliberately sent by Bai Chen to cause trouble.

Bai Chen said coolly, “Forgot to introduce to everyone, this is my newly-acknowledged master! In the future, he shall also be the White Night Sacred Palace’s grand elder! His words are my opinion.”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces all changed.

“Nonsense! Bai Chen, if you’re so unbridled again, then don’t blame us, this bunch of old fellows, for not caring about the old palace lord’s old sentiments, and chase you out of the White Night Sacred Palace!” The elder who endorsed Bai Xiu reproached Bai Chen.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Elder Bai Rong, right? Is your brain damaged? You and Bai Xiu, two people acting out a carefully choreographed dance, and still want to chase the young lord appointed by the old palace lord out of the White Night Sacred Palace?”

Bai Rong’s expression turned sullen and he said, “Ignorant child, keep talking nonsense! Do you believe this old man will tear your mouth or not?”

But Ye Yuan ignored him and said to the other elders, “I’ll only ask everyone one sentence, is Bai Chen the most qualified to succeed the position of palace lord as the successor that the old palace lord appointed?”

The various elders exchanged glances. Suddenly, someone spoke up, “That’s of course! According to the White Night Sacred Palace’s rules, the young lord is the first-in-line successor! It’s just ...”

That elder still wanted to carry on speaking, but he was directly interrupted by Ye Yuan. “Good that there’s that! You all not letting him be the palace lord is nothing more than feeling that he’s still young and his strength is insufficient to convince the public, yes?”

The elders nodded their heads slightly, not having any objections about this.

Facing a great enemy, letting a young man still wet behind his ears go and preside over the overall situation, this was no different from courting death.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’ll now support Bai Chen up onto the position of palace lord in the name of Bai Chen’s master! Those who are unconvinced, come and battle!”

It was this simple and crude!

Whatever schemes and intrigues were all paper tigers in front of absolute strength!

It was just that Ye Yuan’s words in other people’s views were a total joke.

Because Ye Yuan looked just like an ordinary person.

Even Bai Chen’s palms were sweating too.

Bai Xiu was a late-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses, much stronger than Master Ye Yuan.

But he forcefully calmed down. He did not wish to lose face for his master at this time.

Bai Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly. The pressure of Heaven Glimpse Realm slowly released and he said in a solemn voice, “Your meaning is that you want to challenge me?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Not you, it’s you all! Those who are not convinced, attacking together will do too!”

“Wildly arrogant!”

“Ignorant!”

“Insolent!”

Ye Yuan’s arrogance finally aroused the elders’ wrath.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t talk crap anymore, attack!”

Bai Xiu slowly walked down and said with a cold smile, “If you can beat me, what’s wrong with letting Bai Chen inherit the position of palace lord?”

With the old palace lord not being around any longer, Bai Xiu was the White Night Sacred Palace’s number one person.

If not for so, he would not dare to usurp this position of palace lord either.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You? Too weak! Don’t blame me for not giving you guys a chance. Attack together! All of the elders, attack together!”

“What a conceited and ignorant brat! This old man is going to measure just how much you weight today!”

“This old man has lived to a ripe old age, it’s still my first time seeing such a wildly arrogant person! Fine, as you wish!”

“Forget it, forget it, a farce! Since you’re seeking death yourself, this old man will send you on your way too!”

...

Eight great elders stepped out of the ranks one after another, standing together with Bai Xiu.

Nine mighty Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouses standing together, how shocking was the imposing momentum?

Bai Chen’s heart almost leaped to his throat. He completely did not think that Master Ye Yuan was actually arrogant to such a degree, wanting to challenge nine great Heaven Glimpse powerhouses with his power alone!

A Grotto Profound Deity Realm martial artist challenging nine great Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouses, this was crazy, right?

Yesterday, Ye Yuan made him ignore everything. But he did not think that Ye Yuan used this kind of method to let him ascend to the position of palace lord.

Although the effect of this approach was immediate, the prerequisite was that Ye Yuan had to defeat them!

Bai Chen could not resist exchanging a glance with Mo Yun, discovering that Mo Yun also had an inexplicably stunned appearance at this time.

It was just that things already developed to such a degree, it was impossible for them to go and stop it anymore.

There were still a few of the old palace lord’s sons present, all using gloating expressions to look at Bai Chen.

No idea where Bai Chen found such a living treasure either; this was the tempo of playing himself to death!

Ye Yuan alone faced nine great Heaven Glimpse powerhouses but stood firm as a rock.

The nine people’s auras completely could not affect Ye Yuan.

“Kid, you’re seeking death yourself, don’t blame us for being ruthless!” Bai Rong said with a hideous grin.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Attack then, don’t talk nonsense anymore!”

“Wildly arrogant!”

Bai Rong was furious. His aura instantly soared to the peak, rushing over toward Ye Yuan!

The others did not hold back either, all displaying divine abilities. A terrifying power shook until the entire great hall was quaking.

Everyone of them, especially Bai Xiu, each suppressed a stomach-full of anger. It was just that it was inappropriate for Bai Xiu to flare up.

Now that Ye Yuan was seeking death, he did not hold back even more. The moment he made his move, it was the fiercest killing move!

Under the besiegement of nine great experts, Ye Yuan was weak like an insignificant ant.

Except, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of making a move. He still stood with his hands behind his back.

It looked like he was waiting for death.

“Master Ye Yuan!”

Bai Chen’s expression changed drastically, suddenly standing up, wanting to rush over, but was held back by Mo Yun.

Got to be joking, rushing over at this time, Bai Chen would be blasted into smithereens too!

It was indeed a farce!

What the nine great elders were thinking in their hearts at this time was all this.

But right at this time, a gust of sinister wind howled.

Beside Ye Yuan, a figure appeared since no idea when.

The moment he appeared, the temperature in the entire great hall plummeted by a few degrees.

Ever since cultivating the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, Gui Yun seemed to have become even gloomier and colder.

It was only to see him mutter under his breath, drawing a bizarre rune on his hand, and saying indifferently, “Ghost Dao Hundred Runes ... Nether Ghostclaw!”

Suddenly, a surge of terrifying aura came from underground. A dark enormous claw seemed to have extended out from the netherworld.

The nine great elders’ bodies were all in midair. But seeing this, their expressions changed greatly. An aura of death hit head-on.

After the enormous claw extended out, it seemed to have grown eyes, clawing over towards the nine great elders. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The few people revealed a look of great shock. How could they still care about Ye Yuan? They slammed all their attacks at the ghost claw.

Boom!

The ghost claw directly smacked those attacks down!

Puu, puu, puu ...

At virtually the same time, the nine great elders spewed fresh blood wildly one after another, being smacked down onto the ground by this ghost claw’s power.
