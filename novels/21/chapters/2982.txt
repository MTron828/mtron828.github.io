Chapter 2981: Unconcealable Sharp Edge!

“Kid, I lost to you not because my skills are inferior. It’s just that I somewhat underestimated the enemy!” Da Yi said unwillingly.

Regarding this, Ye Yuan just smiled and did not defend himself.

This kind of justification was too powerless and too feeble.

Losing was losing; winning was winning.

Finding a reason for yourself after failure was not what the strong would do.

Seeing Ye Yuan smile and not speak, Da Yi was even more ashamed and resentful.

In the crowd, an old man opened his mouth and said, “Da Yi! A loss is a loss. Displaying shameful courage here will only incur jesting. Do you find it not shameful enough yet?”

Da Yi’s expression changed, and he bowed to the old man in shame as he said, “Yes, Patriarch!”

Ye Yuan was inwardly shocked. He did not expect that this unassuming old man was actually the Heaven Swallowing Python Clan’s patriarch!

The old man said lightly, “Scarletplume, you take the stage and play with him! This boy isn’t ordinary. Be careful.”

Behind the old man, another Heaven Swallowing Python swam out and said calmly, “Yes, Patriarch.”

With this, the crowd exploded.

“Scarletplume is finally going to take action!”

“Mountain Challenger List’s 21st place; if this punk can win again, Your Father will swallow that mountain!”

“Lord Scarletplume devotes himself to spatial divine abilities. Now, he has already reached the acme of perfection! Patriarch said before that he might very likely step into the realm of Hegemon in the future by relying on this Dao!”

“The reason why Lord Scarletplume can rank 21st is that it’s just because his bloodline is a little lousy. It’s only initial-stage earth kun grade. Otherwise, there would be no problem in him getting into the top three!”

… …

Scarletplume arrived opposite of Ye Yuan, his entire person seeming very calm.

It was as if nothing happened just now.

This Scarletplume was different from Da Yi, giving people the appearance of being unmoved even if Mount Tai was crumbling before him.

This was rather similar to Ye Yuan.

“This is a troublesome opponent, be more careful!” Feng Qingxuan said once more, her face slightly red.

She said that Ye Yuan was not Da Yi’s match earlier. In the end, she got face-slapped.

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, Da Yi did not even have the chance to make a move. How embarrassing!

But this time, she was warning out of good intentions.

Actually, there was no need for her to warn him. Ye Yuan naturally saw through it long ago.

A proud opponent, no matter how powerful the strength, it was actually not scary.

What was truly scary was that kind of opponent who was calm to the extreme.

Ye Yuan was sizing Scarletplume up. Scarletplume’s gaze was also wandering around on Ye Yuan’s body. Suddenly, he said, “You’re very strong! I can feel the undulation of spatial rule on your body! Looks like what you’re truly powerful in is actually spatial divine abilities! However, your cultivation realm is a little low. It’s very disadvantageous.”

With this, Ye Yuan was really shocked.

This Scarletplume’s perception was also too sharp, right?

He was currently completely restraining his aura and did not display spatial martial techniques.

This guy could actually feel it!

It could be seen how strong he was in spatial rule!

The Heaven Swallowing Python Clan could be said to have perfectly inherited the spatial talent of the dragon race.

But, regarding the application of spatial talent, some relied on instinct, while others could control it independently.

The gap between them was not a tiny bit.

Ye Yuan had many means, but for mountain challenging, he could only use the dragon race’s talent to go and fight.

Otherwise, disregarding that he would win unscrupulously, Heavenly Dragon Island would not acknowledge him as well.

What they wanted were dragon race geniuses, not human geniuses.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Your bloodline is a little low. We’re considered even.”

Scarletplume smiled and said with a nod, “Alright, then … Let’s begin.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly. The two people exchanged marks.

Bloodline was indeed extremely important to the true spirit race.

Bloodline being a fraction stronger, the power of the martial techniques executed would be a fraction stronger.

Swoosh!

In the instant that the two people finished exchanging marks, Scarletplume disappeared.

“Spirit Spatial Blade! The moment Lord Scarletplume came up, it’s overkill!”

“Lord Scarletplume had once used this move to defeat the rank 29th Meng Zhao!”

“So strong! Can’t find his traces at all! This punk is dead for sure!”

“This punk chose the wrong opponent! Provoking Lord Scarletplume is his biggest mistake!”

… …

Dragon City Tribe’s powerhouses instantly exploded.

Compared to Da Yi, Scarletplume’s status in the clan was higher, and he had more worshipers.

The moment he made his move, the whole place started cheering.

Furthermore, everyone was clearly very familiar with this move. It was one of Scarletplume’s killing moves.

In an instant, Ye Yuan felt as if the surrounding space had turned into a sharp blade, chopping toward him.

The speed was swift until it made people unable to think.

Ye Yuan did not have time to think too much, bloodline power flooding out crazily, throwing a punch out on the spot.

Shattering Space!

Boom!

The place where Ye Yuan was standing at, space shattered!

At once, Spirit Spatial Blade seemingly had nowhere to exert strength, directly turning into nothingness.

However, Shattering Space this move bombarded the opponent. But Ye Yuan slammed it where he was standing.

The shattering of space already injured him.

Boom!

Boom! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Boom!

The two people were fighting in the void, and a series of bursting sounds transmitted out.

The weak ones could not grasp their traces at all.

These two people were dueling with spatial rule. Their strengths were both hair-raisingly strong.

It was just that the Dragon City Tribe’s people were still very surprised by Ye Yuan’s strength.

Originally, when fighting with Da Yi, Ye Yuan did not use his full strength at all.

Feng Qingxuan’s beautiful eyes flickered, incomparably shocked in her heart.

She did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so strong!

She thought that the reason why Ye Yuan was strong was just because he fused with bloodline.

With a single bloodline, Ye Yuan’s strength was not very strong.

But she discovered that she was wrong!

This battle really exposed Ye Yuan’s powerful strength.

This was because his opponent was too strong!

Ye Yuan’s application of bloodline had virtually reached perfection.

She pondered about it. She was of the heaven qian grade bloodline, but she was unable to do better than Ye Yuan too.

“Lass, you shouldn’t show up here!”

Feng Qingxuan was startled and discovered that the Dragon City Tribe’s patriarch had arrived next to her at no idea when.

But very soon, she calmed down and said calmly, “This man makes me very curious!”

The patriarch smiled and said, “He’s very strong. He shouldn’t be a bloodline warrior! But he isn’t Scarletplume’s match!”

Feng Qingxuan snorted coldly and said, “His cultivation realm is just lower.”

Clearly, she did not feel optimistic about Ye Yuan either.

People with outstanding visual prowess all saw through that Ye Yuan did not stand a chance at all.

The patriarch smiled and said, “That’s because you don’t know Scarletplume! In our Dragon City Tribe, the number one genius was originally Da Yi. Scarletplume was just an unassuming minor character. He was completely living under Da Yi’s light. But ever since he stepped on the road of mountain challenging, his sharp edge couldn’t be concealed anymore! Can you imagine, 200 years ago, he was just battle spirit grade bloodline?”

Feng Qingxuan’s pupils constricted. This time, she was really shocked!

Roughly 200 years ago, just battle spirit grade bloodline!

And then 200 years later, earth kun grade bloodline?

How … monstrous was this?

In the true spirit race, talent was innate.

Breaking the shackle of bloodline was harder than ascending to heaven.

She, Feng Qingxuan, was naturally heaven qian grade bloodline!

It was impossible for those battle spirit grade bloodline true spirits to reach earth kun grade for all their lives, let alone talk about heaven qian grade.

But this Scarletplume could actually reach this step in 200 years. It was truly inconceivable!
