Chapter 2673: Stubborn and Reluctant to Admit Mistakes?

“This is simply nonsense! This Third Hall Master drove all of our noble families’ most elite disciples back! Those who remained are all some guys that aren’t of any use, what the hell is this?”

“In my view, he did it on purpose! He has never thought of leaving behind the true grade heavenly pill inheritance at all!”

“He’s deceiving the two hall masters and also wants to fool us, these noble families!”

… …

In the main hall, there was a noisy clamor.

Many family heads expressed strong displeasure with Ye Yuan’s actions.

Even Song Tianyang and Yun Baiyu two people, their expressions were very ugly too.

They both had a feeling of being fooled.

But luckily, the Song Family and Yun Family both left three people behind.

However, the Song Family’s and Yun Family’s strongest juniors, Song Wenhao and Yun Yuan, were both rejected by Ye Yuan.

Without this duel, they would naturally make noise.

But Ye Yuan gave Song Wenhao and Yun Yuan a chance. They naturally had to wait for a while.

They also wanted to see what kind of miraculous means this Third Hall Master had, to be able to make those trash surpass the top disciples.

The door to the pill refining room opened, Cui Tong walked out and said, “Gentlemen, please come in!”

The big shots entered in a single file, somewhat impatient to slap Ye Yuan’s face.

They did not believe that the geniuses they exhausted resources to groom, actually could not compare to Ye Yuan’s three months of teaching!

Moreover, they even enjoyed the same treatment.

Song Tianyang looked at Ye Yuan and said with an unfriendly expression, “Third Hall Master, you wanted to strip my Song Family of the elder position, we’ve accepted it! But now, shouldn’t you give us an explanation?”

Yun Baiyu also said, “We know that the true grade heavenly pill is extremely precious. But, if Third Hall Master wants to use this kind of method to hammer us now, the Yun Family won’t sit passively and await destruction either!”

With these two great families’ patriarchs taking the lead, the other family heads expressed indignation one after another.

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “Everyone, calm down. You’ll know after seeing it. Since you all came, let’s get started then. Song Wenhao, you go first?”

Song Wenhao had a stomach full of anger and was just about to give vent to it.

Seeing Ye Yuan mention him, he smiled coldly and said, “As it should be! Wonder if I can choose my opponent myself or not?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said indifferently, “The people that I’ve selected, you can choose at will.”

Song Wenhao waved his hand and said in a solemn voice, “No need! I’ll pick my brilliant cousin, Song Minzhe! I know that you think the most highly of him in this group of people! Today, I’m going to trample him underfoot in front of everyone. I’ll let Third Hall Master see how blind you were!”

Ye Yuan did not care either and smiled broadly as he said, “Song Minzhe, come.”

“Yes!” Song Minzhe gave a bow and stepped forward.

Song Wenhao looked at Song Minzhe and said disdainfully, “Song Minzhe, do you really think that you can turn into a phoenix from a hen, and transform from a swallow into a phoenix? Today, this young master will make you see that you’re still a hen on the ground!”

Song Minzhe’s face showed some fear.

He knew how big his improvement in these three months was.

But what Ye Yuan made them practice was all grade one basic heavenly pills!

Other heavenly pills, they totally never touched them.

As a Song Family’s descendant, Song Minzhe naturally knew Song Wenhao’s strength.

Really making him face off against Song Wenhao, he was still lacking confidence in his heart.

Seeing Song Minzhe’s expression, they already determined the victor of this match in their hearts.

Originally, alchemy was not something that could be learned quickly within a short period of time too.

Wanting to make Song Minzhe beat the proud son of heaven, Song Wenhao, in a short three months’ time, how was that possible?

Each and every one of these family heads, they were sneering to no end in their hearts.

They were waiting for the moment Ye Yuan gets his face slapped!

What was even more damnable was that Ye Yuan even gave the choosing rights of the heavenly pill to the other party!

Song Wenhao laughed loudly and said, “My good younger brother, you wouldn’t be naive enough to think that I’ll pick the grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, right? Relax, I won’t be so stupid! Want to compete, we naturally have to fight with real swords and spears; competing in grade two heavenly pills! No matter how good you refine grade one heavenly pills, what’s the bloody use? I choose the Greater Sublime Creation Pill!”

Hearing this, the corners of Song Tianyang’s mouth curled slightly.

This Greater Sublime Creation Pill was precisely what Ye Yuan brought out to awe everyone back then, the heavenly imperial pill that made Huang Haoyan and Su Peiyun directly breakthrough to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Why was Song Wenhao called a genius?

Precisely because he could already refine heavenly imperial pills at a young age!

Peak grade two heavenly alchemist!

Although the grade of the heavenly imperial pills that he refined still had much room for improvement, being able to refine it was already worthy of flaunting in itself.

Heavenly imperial pills were not what everyone could refine.

Many family heads were secretly sneering.

“No wonder Song Wenhao this boy was able to be regarded highly by Song Tianyang! This heavenly pill is chosen brilliantly!”

“You look at Song Minzhe’s expression, and you’ll know that he definitely can’t do it!”

“Huhu,?making Song Minzhe refine a heavenly imperial pill within three months, how is this possible? With this, I want to see how Ye Yuan gets through this!”

… …

These family heads had already prepared a belly full of taunting and jeering, preparing to gift it to Ye Yuan.

Even the factions that followed Zhao Xun and Wu Jian were quite unhappy with Ye Yuan now too.

This method of squelching families was very low-level!

Song Minzhe’s expression was very ugly. He could not resist looking at Ye Yuan and said flusteredly, “Master Ye, I …”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No need to have any pressure. You just refine as per normal!”

Song Minzhe was at the very most a middle-level grade two heavenly alchemist. He did not even reach high-level.

Therefore, refining a heavenly imperial pill was something rubbish talk.

He also did not think that by refining grade one basic heavenly pills, he would be able to refine heavenly imperial pills.

Song Minzhe knew that Ye Yuan had very high hopes for him, so the pressure of him was even greater.

If he lost, Master Ye’s face would really be utterly lost.

He was often compared to Song Wenhao by others in the Song Family and treated as a negative example.

Now, he finally managed to win recognition from Ye Yuan. So he did not want to lose face for Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan’s comforting still calmed him down slightly.

He always felt that Ye Yuan had a deep meaning in making him refine grade one basic heavenly pills.

When the refinement started, Song Minzhe tossed these things to the back of his head very quickly.

His seriousness toward pill refinement was also one of the reasons why Ye Yuan picked him.

Compared to Song Wenhao, Song Minzhe’s disposition was far better.

Although he was shouldering tremendous pressure, he could enter the zone very quickly and would not be crushed by the pressure.

In fact, he would even turn pressure into drive!

Seeing Song Minzhe’s somewhat bustling appearance, Song Tianyang suddenly said, “Third Hall Master, is this the explanation that you’re giving us? It’s really nothing much!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Continue watching. Without reaching the last second, who can know the result?”

With regards to Ye Yuan’s words, everyone still responded with cold smiles.

Stubborn and reluctant to admit mistakes was talking about the current Ye Yuan, right?

With Song Minzhe’s flustered appearance, could he refine a heavenly imperial pill?

What a joke!

Right now, they felt that with the two hall masters making Ye Yuan into Third Hall Master, it was a complete mistake!
