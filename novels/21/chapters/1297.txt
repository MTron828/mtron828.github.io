Chapter 1301: Selfless Realm!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A surge of sweetness flowed into his heart. The Divine Rain Silk turned into threads of divine essence, entering Ye Yuan’s four limbs and all the bones in his body. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Finally, it converged in Ye Yuan’s divine sea.

Ye Yuan closed his eyes, sampling the Divine Rain Silk’s medicinal properties in detail.

The knowledge that Dustless narrated rolled swiftly in Ye Yuan’s mind, affirming with his experiences one by one.

However, after the Divine Rain Silk’s medicinal strength entered Ye Yuan’s divine sea, it dissipated to nothing very quickly.

Very soon, Ye Yuan’s divine sea was thoroughly dried up.

“What did I say? You’re purely wasting spirit medicines like this! Digest the things that I said more ...”

Dustless was currently grumbling when he suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan completely ignored him.

One look, Ye Yuan actually already entered a meditative state.

Dustless was helpless and could only shut up.

Two days later, Ye Yuan swallowed another portion of Divine Rain Silk.

Dustless could not do anything to Ye Yuan and could only cuss him out for being a wastrel.

But Ye Yuan acted arbitrarily without regard for others’ opinion. It was as if he did not hear his words at all.

Only at this time did Dustless notice that ever since the first time he swallowed the Divine Rain Silk, Ye Yuan did not seem to have paid attention to him anymore.

“This guy, he wouldn’t have ...”

Dustless sucked in a deep breath, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan became odd.

He shut his mouth and just kept looking at him like this.

Ye Yuan already completely forgot about Dustless’s existence. He was just like a puppet, swallowing a portion of spirit medicines every one to two days.

The spirit medicines were reducing one portion by one portion.

But Ye Yuan did not have the intention of stopping.

In a blink, over 30 days passed.

Ten sets of complete spirit medicines were only left with four sets now.

These 30 days’ time, Ye Yuan exhausted a full six portions of spirit medicines!

When Ye Yuan opened his eyes, he discovered that Dustless’s breathing became ragged, a pair of eyes staring at him like seeing ghosts.

Ye Yuan asked with a curious look, “Senior, what are you doing here? Could it be that there are flowers on my face?”

Dustless drew a deep breath and strove to calm his emotions down and asked Ye Yuan, “You wouldn’t have ... grasped all of it, right?”

When he asked this kind of thing, Dustless actually started feeling somewhat worried lest he should lose it.

Ye Yuan froze. Only then did he understand that Dustless was asking him if he grasped the medicinal properties of the spirit medicines.

Ye Yuan shut his eyes and went through once, and discovered to his pleasant surprise that these spirit medicines’ medicinal properties, he actually already grasped 70%-80%!

This discovery made Ye Yuan pleasantly surprised!

This period of time, he felt like he had a dream.

In the dream, he was continuously comprehending these spirit medicines’ medicinal properties.

No idea how much time had passed either, he virtually grasped all of it.

He originally thought that he was having a dream. He did not expect that after waking up from the dream, he actually really grasped the medicinal properties of these spirit medicines!

This kind of feeling was really like dreaming!

Ye Yuan asked Dustless with a look of pleasant surprise and said, “Senior, I already grasped 70%-80% of the medicinal properties. This ... What’s going on here?”

The corners of Dustless’s mouth suddenly twitched, and he asked, “Did you feel like these 30 day’s time, it was like having a dream?”

Ye Yuan froze and could not help saying in surprise, “30 days? 30 days already gone by?”

Merely just a dream, Ye Yuan felt that the time was very long in the dream.

But after waking up, he also felt that not a long time passed.

But hearing Dustless’ meaning, 30 days had actually gone by already!

The more he said, the more puzzled Ye Yuan got, totally unaware of what happened.

He grasped these spirit medicines’ medicinal properties bafflingly!

“Did you have a dream?” Dustless suddenly asked.

Ye Yuan nodded honestly.

“In the dream, did you feel like a very long time had already passed?”

Ye Yuan nodded once again.

“In the dream, did you continuously comprehend the medicinal properties?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head repeatedly.

Dustless let out a sigh and said, “You, brat, your luck is really excellent to the extreme! In an accident arising from many causes, you actually entered the Selfless Realm1!”

“Selfless Realm?” Ye Yuan repeated it, clearly very unfamiliar with this realm.

Dustless said, “That’s right! The so-called Selfless Realm is a kind of spirit wandering away state! Under this sort of state, no matter what you learn, it’s incomparably fast! Since you entered the Selfless Realm until now, a total of 30 days’ time had passed. Figuring out 70%-80% of five kinds of divine rank spirit medicines in 30 days, this can simply be rated as a miracle! Only the Selfless Realm can achieve this kind of effect!”

Ye Yuan said in surprise: “There’s still such a realm? Doesn’t that mean that a hundred days’ time is sufficient for me to refine the Divine Essence Pill?”

“Pooh! You’re really shameless! Do you think that Selfless Realm is so easy to enter? Being able to enter this kind of state once, you already hit the jackpot! Under Divine Lord Realm, among a million martial artists, there might not be one capable of entering Selfless Realm too! Among them, includes Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm and Origin Deity Realm! Furthermore, even entering once, that’s very lucky too! The chances of entering again are even smaller than the first time!” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan was also secretly dumbfounded when he heard. It looked like he seemed to have really hit the jackpot.

“Senior, this Selfless Realm, just what kind of realm is it?” Ye Yuan said curiously.

“Since there are higher realms after Deity Realm, then after Heaven Man Unity heart realm, there are naturally higher realms too! Selfless Realm is the heart realm after Heaven Man Unity! Heaven Man Unity is the resonance towards Heavenly Dao, while Selfless is in accordance with Heavenly Dao! You definitely found the correspondence point with Heavenly Dao under the heavy pressure. Hence, you temporarily entered Selfless Realm. Cultivating by following a normal routine, only after reaching Divine Lord Realm, creating a world that belongs to you, can you find the correspondence with the Heavenspan world’s Heavenly Dao, and firmly enter Selfless Realm!” Dustless said.

The meaning of these words he said was very simple: Ye Yuan got very lucky. That was how he entered the Selfless Realm.

Wanting to enter again was undoubtedly a fool’s ramblings.

The disparity between Grotto Profound Deity Realm and Divine Lord Realm was too great.

But Ye Yuan laughed open-mindedly and said, “So that’s how it is! No matter what, grasping the medicinal properties is good. Senior, can we start expounding on Formation Dao?”

Dustless was not as accepting as Ye Yuan. He was still incredibly shocked in his heart.

He did not say certain stuff. Those able to coincidentally enter Selfless Realm, the vast majority were all Origin Deity Realm powerhouses!

The comprehension of Origin Deity Realms toward Heavenly Dao was already very high. If lucky, one would be able to find the correspondence point with the Heavenspan World’s Heavenly Dao.

And Origin Deity Realms capable of entering Selfless Realm, the majority were all able to hew open a world, achieving Divine Lord Realm, truly becoming a powerhouse of a region!

Those like Ye Yuan, able to enter Selfless Realm after just breaking through to Grotto Profound Deity Realm, one might not even be able to find a few in the entire Heavenspan World!

This was the real reason why he was astounded!

In other words, as long as Ye Yuan could cultivate to the Origin Deity Realm by following a normal routine, reaching Divine Lord Realm was virtually a shoo-in!

After entering the Deity Realm, even though every step was extremely difficult, there was still a massive dividing crest between realms.

Divine Lord Realm, was the first hurdle!
