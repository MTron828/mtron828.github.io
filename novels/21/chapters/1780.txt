Chapter 1784 Bring You to Win Lying Down

“Is it for real? Baili Qingyan actually took the initiative to invite others to form a team?”

“That kid’s strength is also too weak, right?”

“Why didn’t she find me to form a team? It’s killing me with envy!”

...

Baili Qingyan’s actions stunned everyone.

A heaven’s chosen of this generation actually took the initiative to form a team with a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord rookie. It really made people’s jaws drop.

Especially Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin, the looks that those two people cast over were virtually going to kill Ye Yuan.

Not just them, even Ye Yuan himself also had a befuddled look and did not come back to his senses for a while.

But when he came back to his senses, he said something that stunned everyone even more.

“Sorry, I plan on entering the mountain alone. Miss Baili, please seek someone more capable,” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Buzz!

An uproar burst out all around!

Just now, everyone’s eyes wished to kill Ye Yuan.

But now, everyone used a look of exasperation at his failure to live up to expectations to look at him.

Did this guy’s brain have an issue?

Didn’t he see that Baili Qingyan even rejected Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin?

To be able to spend a month’s time in the mountain with an unrivaled beauty, that was something that everyone yearned for day and night.

Even if they died, that was also worth it.

This fool actually refused!

With this, it was Baili Qingyan’s turn to have an astounded look. Immediately, a hint of red flashed across her face.

He ... He actually refused her!

The reason why Baili Qingyan came to find Ye Yuan was because she was certain that Ye Yuan would not refuse.

In fact, she totally never thought that Ye Yuan would refuse.

But now, she ... was so embarrassed!

After musing for a moment, Baili Qingyan said, “Can I have a word with you?”

It was hard to get off after riding a tiger’s back. Currently, for Baili Qingyan, this had to work whether it succeeded or failed.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and came to a remote place with Baili Qingyan.

“Why did you reject me?”

Baili Qingyan had a baffled look, her words carrying tender bashfulness, full of puzzlement.

In her view, no man should be able to refuse her charm.

Ye Yuan’s mind was like a clear mirror, but he smiled and said, “Miss Baili, a straightforward person doesn’t beat around the bush. You feel that my strength is meager and want to make use of me to shake off those two people’s pestering. You feel that I hanker after your beauty and would agree to you without a word, or that I can pass the first round assessment under your protection. But, I have to say, you miscalculated!”

If it were others, they would definitely agree without hesitation.

But what Ye Yuan thought was a lot more than others.

Baili Qingyan’s reliance was not worth a single cent in front of him.

He did not need beauty, much less the protection of Baili Qingyan.

So, he could be aloof if he had no selfish desires.

While Baili Qingyan was beautiful, what she had in mind did not have much temptation to Ye Yuan.

Therefore, she miscalculated.

Baili Qingyan suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan’s mind was ridiculously clear-headed.

She understood that Ye Yuan was negotiating terms with her. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“With your strength, if Song Ting is bent on dealing with you, there’s absolutely no way you’ll survive. If you follow me, you can pass the first round assessment very effortlessly.”

Baili Qingyan was very puzzled, she felt that Ye Yuan did not have reason to reject her terms at all.

Song Ting’s threat just now, Baili Qingyan took it into her sight.

She felt that Ye Yuan would definitely need to seek protection under such tremendous pressure.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s strength was meager. If she formed a team with Ye Yuan, anyone would be able to tell that she just wanted to shake off Duan Qinghong two people.

To Ye Yuan, her addition could let Ye Yuan pass through the round even easier.

In other words, as long as he followed her, Ye Yuan could win by simply not doing anything.

Passing the first round assessment practically did not have the least bit of suspense.

But Ye Yuan refused.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “That’s my own business! Moreover, Miss Baili is too self-confident. Passing the first round assessment isn’t as hard as you imagine.”

Baili Qingyan sneered to no end in her heart!

The first round was not hard?

That was said to her, Baili Qingyan!

Baili Qingyan was very smart, she understood what Ye Yuan had in mind very quickly.

Ye Yuan clearly saw through her thoughts and wanted to coerce with this, negotiating terms with her!

Baili Qingyan drew a deep breath, but her tone turned cold as she said, “I already said it, I can’t take it back anymore. Speak, as long as you form a team with me, you can state your terms.”

Ye Yuan was speechless. Baili Qingyan’s self-importance was too high.

He really did not want to team up with her, but Baili Qingyan thought that Ye Yuan wanted to coerce her with this.

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “I don’t have any conditions. If Miss Baili insists on forming a team with me, why not play a melody on the zither for me and get rid of the loneliness in the mountains.”

To Ye Yuan, with or without Baili Qingyan’s addition, it did not matter at all.

But the beauty already stopped so low, he really could not refuse.

Hence, that was why he agreed to Baili Qingyan with such an excuse.

Ye Yuan learned from Han Yong that Baili Qingyan’s zither skills were unparalleled. It was just that there were scanty few who could hear her zither sounds.

Hence, that was why Ye Yuan said so.

Baili Qingyan was slightly taken aback, the flush on her face grew redder as she said with bashful anger, “You ... despicable villain!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said indifferently, “If you can’t even satisfy this bit of request, then forget about it.”

Baili Qingyan was helpless and said angrily, “Fine! Consider it that I succumbed in your hands! This incident today, this Baili will remember it!”

Ye Yuan was somewhat perplexed in his heart, just playing a song on the zither, was there a need?

When the two people returned, everyone’s eyes concentrated on Ye Yuan.

“This guy is so shameless, looks like he really said yes!”

“That act just now was probably loosening the line to rein it in better later, right?”

“This guy is really despicable and shameless!”

...

Ye Yuan and Baili Qingyan standing together, everyone immediately understood in their hearts.

Toward Ye Yuan’s ‘impudence and shamelessness,’ they also had grieving and indignant faces.

It was as if a fresh flower was stuck on a cow dung.

Even though they all knew that Baili Qingyan was merely making use of Ye Yuan.

Before long, a Celestial Deity powerhouse stepped out of the sky and said to everyone, “For you all to want to join my Shadowmoon Sect, you must pass two rounds of examination. This first round is to hunt fierce beasts in the Shadowmoon Mountain Range. Now, you’re free to team up. But each squad mustn’t exceed three people! Fierce beasts killed in teams are only half of those killed individually. This hunt, killing isn’t restricted! As long as you all have the strength, you can snatch fierce beasts from other people’s hands. Alright, now, the first round assessment, begin!”

Following that Celestial Deity powerhouse’s word of command, the martial artists entered the Shadowmoon Mountain Range in a single file.

When everyone saw Ye Yuan together with Baili Qingyan, they could not help having envious looks.

And in the crowd, when Song Ting saw this scene, his gaze was incomparably sinister and ruthless.

“Punk, you think that after hiding behind a woman, you can escape the fate of death? Heh heh, you’re thinking too much! Even a genius like Baili Qingyan also can’t stop my Devil Elephant Sect’s intention to kill you!”
