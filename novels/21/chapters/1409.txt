Bai Chen rode the Lion Mirage Beast, looking awe-inspiring and very pleased.

Ye Yuan already got to know from Bai Chen that this lion-shaped fierce beast’s name was called Lion Mirage Beast.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he was very curious too.

That collar seemed to have considerable magical powers. Latching onto that Lion Mirage Beast’s neck, that guy submitted.

“Young Lord Bai Chen, I wonder what kind of wondrous object this collar is?” Ye Yuan asked.

Bai Chen smiled and said, “This is an Imperial Spirit Circle. It’s also normal for you mortals to not have heard of it before. This is a high-grade spirit divine artifact. As long as I drip blood for it to acknowledge as master, then put it onto the neck of a fierce beast, it can suppress rank one deity realm fierce beasts and let it submit to me. Of course, the prerequisite is that I must beat it until it doesn’t have the strength to retaliate.”

Ye Yuan secretly marveled. He did not expect that this Sky Foothill World actually had such impressive artifact refining means.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s curious appearance, Bai Chen smiled and said, “Want to come up and experience it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and shook his head, saying: “This thing is too formidable, I’d better not ride.”

“Haha, you, this kid, look like a pale-faced scholar. Your guts are also too small! This Lion Mirage Beast is already subdued and won’t attack people.” A follower mocked him.

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not explain.

Not that he did not want to sit, but he did not dare to sit.

If he were to sit on it, how could this Lion Mirage Beast still move?

The reason why Bai Chen was able to easily bring down the Lion Mirage Beast was all because of Ye Yuan’s intimidation.

Currently, Ye Yuan’s body simulated the aura of Sky Foothill’s Heavenly Dao. Those fierce beasts would not be averse to him like before.

Hence, they could also sense the terror on Ye Yuan’s body.

The demon race bloodline in Ye Yuan’s body was incomparably noble. Furthermore, the power was extremely formidable. That Lion Mirage Beast baring its fangs and brandishing its claws at that time was not scaring Ye Yuan but being afraid of Ye Yuan.

It was just that when Bai Chen saw it, he thought that the Lion Mirage Beast wanted to attack Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan took Bai Chen’s strength into his sights. Although he recently entered the Grotto Profound Deity Realm and his spear art was not bad as well, wanting to deal with this Lion Mirage Beast, it was still a little lacking.

But by the side, Mo Yun was constantly on heightened vigilance constantly.

The rest did not have any suspicions about Ye Yuan. But he kept feeling that this Ye Yuan was problematic.

It was just that where was the problem. He could not pinpoint it either.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Suddenly, over a dozen figures dashed out of the dense forest, surrounding Bai Chen and co.

“Hahaha ... Bai Chen! I’ve waited for this chance for a very long time! Today is your death date!” A young figure divided everyone and said this with a wild laugh.

Bai Chen’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “Bai Chong, what’s the meaning of this?”

Bai Chong smiled hideously and said, “What’s the meaning? My strength is more powerful than you, age is older than yours. Why is it that you’re the young lord?! While I, have to become a dog under you? I’m unwilling! I want to become the young lord and rule the White Night Sacred Palace in the future!”

Mo Yun reproached furiously, “Bai Chong, are you crazy? For this, you recruited the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s people? You have to know that they are our White Night Sacred Palace’s mortal enemy!”

Bai Chong sneered coldly and said, “So what? As long as I can get the position of the young lord, what does it matter what means I use?”

Behind Bai Chong, a middle-aged man looked at Mo Yun and said with a laugh, “Mo Yun, didn’t expect it, right? Heh heh, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance. Kill Bai Chen, then join our Autumn Rain Sacred Palace! With your strength, you’ll be put in an important position.”

Mo Yun ignored him but glared at Ye Yuan and said, “You’re Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s spy! Otherwise, such a vast Wilderness Forest, how did you guys find us?”

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

“You! You actually repaid kindness with ingratitude!” Bai Chen pointed at Ye Yuan and said with bitter resentment.

“Humph! I’ve observed him for very long already. He isn’t some ordinary person at all, but a hidden expert! On his body, there’s probably an aura-concealing divine artifact!” Mo Yun said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan did not expect Mo Yun to suddenly point the spearhead at him. He said with a guileless look, “I’m really not a spy. You all should be able to testify for me, right?”

Who Ye Yuan asked was Bai Chong. He instantly felt that he was being wronged.

Currently, this sort of situation, Bai Chen’s side was a certain-death situation.

Mo Yun was merely half-step Heaven Glimpse Realm. The others were mostly initial-stage Grotto Profound strength.

While opposite, that man’s strength was more or less the same as Mo Yun’s.

Apart from him, the other over dozen people were all Grotto Profound Realm powerhouse.

Quite a few among them were even middle-stage, even late-stage existences!

The overall strength was significantly stronger than this side!

But Bai Chong smiled coldly and said, “Mo Yun, you’re right! He was sent by us to investigate your whereabouts!”

When Bai Chong saw Bai Chen’s side having internal strife, he was naturally happy to see them fight in the nest.

He did not mind sowing discord!

Sure enough, when Bai Chen and Mo Yun heard this, their faces changed, glaring at Ye Yuan.

“Ye Yuan, I really misjudged you! If I had long known it would be like this, I’d have let the Lion Mirage Beast eat you!” Bai Chen said angrily.

Mo Yun said in a cold voice, “Young Lord, no need to talk rubbish with him anymore! Kill him!”

Done talking, Mo Yun lifted his hand and it was a palm with boundless might.

Seeing this scene, the middle-aged man opposite and Bai Chong both revealed delighted faint smiles.

Boom!

The outrageously shocking palm struck right onto Ye Yuan’s chest.

However ... Ye Yuan stood there without moving an inch, forcefully receiving this palm!

Everyone’s eyeballs popped out, looking at this scene in disbelief.

Ye Yuan was completely fine!

“This ... How is this possible?” The middle-aged man muttered.

Mo Yun’s strength, he was still aware. This palm, even he did not dare to forcefully receive it. This young man actually forcefully withstood this palm!

Ye Yuan was wearing Wu Meng Academy’s profound divine artifact battle armor. This degree of attack naturally could not threaten him.

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said with a smile, “Actually, I’m just Passerby A and really didn’t have the intention of getting involved in your struggle for the position of young lord. Alright, in order to express my innocence, I won’t take part in your fight. This will do, right?”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and really retreated to one side. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

With this, it was Bai Chong’s side’s turn to lose composure.

This young man was a little too unfathomable, right?

The expression of the middle-aged man opposite turned stern. Suddenly recalling something, he whispered in Bai Chong’s ear, “They are definitely putting on an act, wanting to scare us away! No need to care about him, the most important thing is to kill Bai Chen!”

Bai Chong’s expression turned austere, nodded his head, and said in a solemn voice, “Attack! Whoever kills Bai Chen will be heavily rewarded!”

“Kill!”

Those doze over people shouted loudly, rushing over towards Bai Chen in a swarm.

Mo Yun’s expression changed and was just about to take action when the middle-aged man’s figure already arrived!

“Your opponent is me! Bai Chen is dead for sure today! Stop putting up a last-ditch fight!” The middle-aged man said with a hideous grin.

Bai Chen’s few followers protected Bai Chen in the center tightly and faced the besieging of over a dozen Grotto Profound powerhouses. Very soon, they were running low in strength.

When Mo Yun saw this, he could not help becoming greatly anxious.

Ye Yuan stood tall and upright at one side. Suddenly, he let out a sigh and said, “Sure enough, I still can’t look on!”
