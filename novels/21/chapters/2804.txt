Chapter 2810: Emperor!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

‘When Song Miao heard that, his entire body shook!

He already harbored the will to die and no longer held any fantasies at all.

He just wanted to repent to Ye Yuan for the mistake that he had committed before he died.

But now, Ye Yuan told him that he did not need to die anymore!

“I-Is this true?”

Song Miao was agitated until his entire body was trembling. It was for him and also for everyone who was inflicted with corrupt blood!

The blood race’s corrupt blood was extremely powerful. A moment of carelessness in battle and one would fall victim to it.

comment

Especially in this kind of great decisive battle, it was even easier to succumb.

The majority of the powerhouses from all races did not die on the battlefield but died under the corrupt blood.

If Ye Yuan was really able to treat corrupt blood, that would really be the greatest good!

This significance did not pale in the slightest to inventing the method to inhibit the blood race’s revival!

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I already have some leads, but I still need some time. However, before this, I can help you suppress the spread of corrupt blood power.”

Actually, Ye Yuan had long already begun his research into the blood race in the fog.

‘This powerful race made him burn with eagerness.

Ye Yuan discovered that the blood race’s blood was indeed incredibly powerful and was a one-of-a-kind thing.

Especially the blood essence of the blood race, not only could they revive from a drop of blood, but it was also an excellent material for refining heavenly pills!

It was just that the blood essence of the blood race was too difficult to obtain.

He originally planned on diving into research, who knew that this incident occurred, completely depleting the blood essence that he had gathered painstakingly.

However, Ye Yuan already had some understanding of some characteristics of the blood race’s blood.

Corrupt blood power was merely one of them.

Song Miao said spiritedly, “If Younger Brother Ye can really resolve the corrupt blood, then you would really be the number one hero in the world!”

If it was before, he naturally would not take Ye Yuan’s words seriously.

But now, he believed it without a shadow of a doubt!

Ye Yuan exposed the huge flaw in the Extreme Medicine Sect’s treatment method with a word previously.

Furthermore, this had already been verified by facts!

Suddenly, the void trembled, and a figure emerged.

Song Miao’s expression changed, and he gave a bow and said, “Lord Ming Yi!”

‘The arrival was a half-step Emperor Realm super powerhouse and also the Heaven One army’s highest commander!

Ming Yi nodded slightly and said, “Emperor Dan Fei wants to meet this little brother.”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s confusion, Song Miao said, “Emperor Dan Fei is presently the northern front’s strongest person, an Emperor Vast Heaven Realm mighty expert! He probably wants to meet you because of those arrows!”

Emperor Realm’s three heavens, Emperor Cloud Heaven, Emperor Vast Heaven, Emperor Sakra Heaven’!

Different from Sovereign Realm powerhouses, Emperor Realm powerhouses were powerhouses who truly transcended worldliness, their strength being unimaginable.

In the battle previously, one should not look at how the Saint Sovereign Heavens and True Sovereign Heavens from both sides were fighting with a huge commotion.

The real fights happened between Emperor Realm powerhouses.

Ye Yuan seemed to have long expected it and said with a nod, “Come on then.”

Ming Yi flicked his sleeves grandly, and Ye Yuan had no commanéd over himself, disappearing from where he originally was.

Ye Yuan was shocked inwardly. Was this the strength of Emperor Realm?

‘This Ming Yi was not Emperor Realm yet, but his control over space was already strong to the degree that it made people’s hair stand on end!

Ye Yuan only felt a blur before his eyes, and he arrived in a garden.

‘An old man in coarse cloth was currently watering flowers.

“Lord Emperor, Ye Yuan is here!” Ming Yi said respectfully.

In front of this person, Ming Yi, this half-step Emperor Realm powerhouse, was humble to the extreme.

Ye Yuan sized this old man up and discovered that he actually could not see him vividly.

He was clearly standing right there, but it was like he had fused into one with the surrounding garden.

It was as if where he was standing was a world on its own!

Emperor Dan Fei looked at Ye Yuan and said with a nod, “Sharp edge revealing itself, sword intent soaring to the sky, a peerless good sword! No wonder it isn’t tolerated by Heavenly Dao! Young Friend, I hope that you can achieve Hegemon one day!”

Ye Yuan could feel that the other party’s gaze seemed to penetrate his physical body, looking at the Dao sword in the depths of his body!

He did not have the slightest secrets in front of this old man.

Of course, apart from Mi Tian!

This guy was once a Hegemon Realm overlord.

Wanting to pry into him, Emperor Realm was not enough!

By the side, Ming Yi’s pupils constricted too.

He had never seen before Lord Emperor have such a high appraisal of a junior! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Hegemon!

This was the 33 Heavens’ paramount strength, the overlords above Emperor Realm!

‘Wanting to reach this realm was virtually impossible.

Just talking about Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, it was boundlessly vast, the cultivators unable to be counted.

But attaining Hegemon this sort of words, there was really no one who dared to say it.

Even Emperor Dan Fei, this kind of terrifying existence, did not dare to have the slightest excessive expectation for Hegemon Realm too.

But he gave Ye Yuan this kind of appraisal!

Ye Yuan gave a bow and said, “Lord Emperor is too kind; Hegemon Realm is too far away, Ye Yuan had better be down-to-earth.”

Dan Fei smiled and said, “A tough will, firm Dao heart, a good sapling! You should know why this old man is looking for you, right?”

cYe Yuan nodded and said, “It’s for those arrows. However ... ‘m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint Lord Emperor. This kind of method cant be used on a large scale. I can only suppress a few hundred drops when suppressing the blood race’s blood essence with Dao sword. Furthermore, the conditions to obtain

the blood race’s blood essence is too harsh. It can only be left up to fate.”

Dan Fei was not too surprised. He just let out a long sigh and said, “As expected! The reason why the blood race is difficult to deal with is precisely because it’s hard to obtain their blood essence! The Extreme Medicine Sect has attempted many times and couldn’t do it either. Either eradicate or let them revive.

Your Dao sword is actually able to suppress the blood race’s blood essence and make them unable to revive, indeed formidable!”

It was not that Heaven One powerhouses did not think of studying methods to target the blood race before.

But, to research, one must obtain the blood race’s blood essence.

Yet, this was the hardest part.

Killing a bloodkin was easy.

But wanting to obtain blood race blood essence was as hard as ascending to heaven.

It was just that Dan Fei did not expect that something that nobody had ever done before, Ye Yuan actually did it.

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword had experienced the tempering of Dao tribulation and absorbed large quantities of Heavenly Dao’s power.

One could say that his Dao sword held heaven’s might!

No matter how strong the blood race’s blood essence was, it also found it hard to take a single step under heaven’s might.

Divergent cultivators indeed had very formidable strength, but there was no one like Ye Yuan at all, using their lifeblood Dao sword to meet the Dao tribulations each time!

This kind of thing was no different from seeking death.

They did not have the attributes of heaven’s might, so they were naturally unable to suppress the blood race’s blood essence too.

Ming Yi, who was by the side, was also shocked when he heard it.

This boy was extraordinary!

This kind of ability was what even Hegemon Realm powerhouses did not have!

Of course, it was far too difficult to want to kill the blood race’s Hegemon Realms.

Originally, he still had a high and mighty attitude towards Ye Yuan. But now, it was completely gone.

How could a character that even Emperor Dan Fei had praised repeatedly be of the common sort?

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “During this period of time, I’ve been constantly studying the blood race’s blood essence. This is indeed a rarely seen treasure of the world! Even those natural treasures are greatly inferior. Originally, I planned on devoting myself to studying it. I didn’t expect that I’d completely

exhausted all the blood race blood essence that I’ve accumulated before.”
