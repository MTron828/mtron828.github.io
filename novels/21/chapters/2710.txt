The moment Big Yellow Bull opened his mouth, everyone’s faces changed.

Although he was just a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, behind him was a real Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Saint Sovereign Heaven was God in the Myriad Demons Mountain!

“Commander Big Yellow, this isn’t appropriate, right? This is my family matter!” Bright Tiger said in a solemn voice.

“There’s nothing inappropriate! If this commander can’t convince you all, there’s naturally Lord Saint Exalt who will come forth personally. At that time, I’m afraid that nobody here will be able to live! I think that you all know the Myriad Demons Mountain’s rules!”

Big Yellow said it nonchalantly, but each word struck the hearts of Bright Tiger and the rest.

What rule did Myriad Demons Mountain have?

The strong reigned supreme!

If the strong wanted you dead, they did not need any reason at all!

This was the law of the jungle!

I’m strong, so I can dominate everything.

And the true masters of this Myriad Demons Mountain were the three great Saint Sovereign Heavens!

Shuoyan’s gaze turned slightly dark and he spoke up, “Royal Father, me and my eight older brothers are already irreconcilable till death! Today, Shuoyan will have a fair fight with them! If Shuoyan is defeated and dies, there will absolutely be no complaints!”

Bright Tiger’s gaze turned sharp and he said in a solemn voice, “You mean, you want to fight one against eight?”

“Precisely so!” Shuoyan said firmly.

“Hiss …”

Countless true spirits drew a breath of cold air.

Bright Tiger King’s ten sons, apart from Shuoyan, they were all dragons among men. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Their strength was extremely strong existences among the Myriad Demons Mountain’s junior generation.

This Shuoyan actually wanted to fight one-on-eight, wasn’t this courting death?

Bright Tiger King seemed to have somewhat waned interest, waving his hand and said, “Forget it. If you all want to fight, just fight then!”

Shuoyan’s gaze swept across his eight older brothers and he said calmly, “Eight brothers, Shuoyan will give you all the chance to kill me today! Please go ahead!”

Hefeng snorted coldly and said, “Old Sixteen, you’re too conceited! Although your strength has advanced by leaps and bounds these few years, your foundation isn’t stable! Since you’re seeking death, then your brothers will send you off!”

Seeing that Shuoyan actually wanted to fight one-against-eight, Hefeng and the rest were all pleasantly surprised.

They were extremely confident in their strength, how could they possibly lose to this brat?

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

These eight people naturally had no intention of showing mercy. Each and every one of them released their auras fully and rushed forward.

“HAH!”

Shuoyan roared, a terrifying bloodline pressure instantly exploding.

“Greater Xiantian Dipper Fist!”

It was only to see Shuoyan throw a punch out. Everyone’s faces instantly changed.

The power of this punch already reached the pinnacle of Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Nobody expected that Shuoyan’s one punch actually had such terrifying power.

Rumble!

Throwing a punch out, the terrifying air billows directly sent all the eight tiger sons flying.

One punch defeated eight people!

When Shuoyan was at middle Limitless Sublime Heaven, his strength could already contend with grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

After awakening his bloodline, not only did his cultivation realm increase, the power of his bloodline even grew significantly stronger!

Now, he was virtually matchless below Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum already.

And when Bright Tiger King saw this punch, his eyes revealed even greater shock.

“Greater Xiantian Dipper Fist! This … Isn’t this the ultimate move that Saint Exalt Bull Demon comprehended? How does Shuoyan know it?” Bright Tiger King said in inexplicable shock.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Your son is currently Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s personal disciple. Is it very strange that he knows this move?”

The Shuoyan after awakening his bloodline, his talent was indeed terrifying too, as if he had become enlightened.

He only used half a month’s time and already had a preliminary grasp of this move.

Compared to Saint Exalt Bull Demon, he was naturally 108 thousand miles away. But it was more than enough to deal with his few older brothers who had a similar realm with him.

Bright Tiger King’s tiger body trembled and he said in shock once again, “What? Shuoyan?! He … He became Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s personal disciple?”

He felt that the sudden turn of events he had encountered in this lifetime was not as many as today!

Big Yellow Bull said coolly, “That’s right! Shuoyan awakened a powerful bloodline talent. His future accomplishments will likely far surpass yours. Your other sons are no longer important! So, do you think that Shuoyan will do something to harm his biological brothers in order to inherit your mantle? Does he have the need?”

Bright Tiger King’s entire person was petrified there, his head rumbling.

It was naturally impossible for Big Yellow Bull to lie about this matter. The Greater Xiantian Dipper Fist could not be faked either.

This was to say that he was deceived by this bunch of scoundrels?

Furthermore, it was actually this bunch of sons that caused this consequence today?

With the truth coming to light, there seemed to be a volcano in Bright Tiger King’s chest that was about to erupt!

“Hefeng!” Bright Tiger King bellowed loudly, scaring the mountain full of true spirits until their expressions changed.

“R-Royal Father!”

Hefeng was severely wounded by one punch and still vomiting blood out of his mouth. But, he was more frightened.

Hearing that Shuoyan became a Saint Exalt’s disciple, he already despaired in his heart.

“I’m not your royal father!?Huhu,?the few of you are really my good sons!” Bright Tiger smiled coldly, his eyes full of murderous intent.

“Royal Father, it … it’s not what you think! W-We really didn’t do anything!” Hefeng said fearfully.

Bang!

Bright Tiger pointed a finger. A terrifying force directly penetrated Hefeng’s head.

Hefeng, dead!

Following that, he flicked his sleeves and said in a solemn voice, “Drag them all away for me and kill them!”

Bright Tiger King directly sentenced his eight sons to death.

Now, he only had one son, Shuoyan.

Of course, this son was also his pride!

“Good! Fine lad! Royal father has wronged you! You lived up to expectations!” Bright Tiger hugged Shuoyan and said apologetically.

“It’s not that I lived up to expectations, but that Big Brother Ye Yuan is amazing! If it wasn’t for his heavenly pill, it wouldn’t have been possible for me to awaken my bloodline too. Master he also wouldn’t have taken fancy on me, and we’d have long died in the Saint Exalt’s territory as well. Everything about this child was thanks to Big Brother!” Shuoyan said.

Bright Tiger was shocked in his heart. He already overestimated Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill as much as possible, but he did not expect that he still underestimated it!

He did not think that Shuoyan could actually awaken such a terrifying bloodline power.

Just now, when Shuoyan took action, he already felt it clearly.

Shuoyan’s bloodline power was extremely high-level, he was unable to distinguish it at all!

But without a doubt, it was far stronger than him, this father!

This son’s future accomplishments would definitely be above his!

Now, he even became Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s disciple. This was simply soaring to the heavens in one bound.

“Oh,?right! Right! Master Ye, Bright Tiger has offended previously, hope that Master Lord will be magnanimous and don’t fuss about it!” Bright Tiger King said in fear and trepidation.

Right now, he no longer had the slightest sense of superiority in front of Ye Yuan.

If Ye Yuan was willing, he could even determine his life and death with a word!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Alright, your family matter has also been dealt with. Everyone can scatter then. The few of you rest assured. What I promised you all is still effective! Having a few more Saint Sovereign Heavens in this Myriad Demons Mountain isn’t a bad thing either. But, you all have to hurry up with the matter of searching for heavenly pills.”

Ye Yuan naturally had selfish motives in doing so too.

The power and influence of the Pill Alliance were too powerful!

They had true grade heavenly pills too, creating Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses was naturally nothing difficult as well!

If Ye Yuan wanted to return to the Five Great Heavenly Regions, he must have a powerful faction as the backing.

This Myriad Demons Mountain was naturally the best choice!
