Chapter 1342: Immortal Grove Shaken!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At the Immortal Grove World, currently, a storm was arising!

Traces of profound power were flowing between heaven and earth.

The already decrepit Fang Tian suddenly opened both eyes, his eyes revealing rays of brilliant light.

“Senior! Senior!”

Bang!

Fang Tian’s door was directly burst open by someone from outside. Teng Yun’s figure appeared in front of him.

It was only to see Teng Yun having a look of wild ecstasy as he said, “Senior, do ... do you feel it? H-Hahaha, we ... we’re finally able to break through to the Deity Realm!”

Fang Tian smiled and said, “That’s right! Divine Dao laws have finally returned! The Immortal Grove Region gained a new lease of life and came back to life! Most importantly, we’ve confirmed that Ye Yuan is still alive now!”

Just earlier, Fang Tian distinctly sensed that his realm that was unable to break through for several tens of thousands of years finally had a trace of loosening up!

Over the years, he had long already seen through the secular world and severed that trace of thought.

He never thought that right on his deathbed, the opportunity to become a deity actually descended upon him.

To Fang Tian, breaking through to the Deity Realm was just lightly striding out the distance of a small step.

This Immortal Grove Region, he was bound to be the first martial artist to break through to the Deity Realm!

Teng Yun said excitedly, “Haha, yes! Not only is Ye Yuan alive, but he’s also living very well! Truly can’t imagine, it’s been less than 50 years, and he already regained Heavenly Dao for the Immortal Grove Region!”

Fang Tian had a look of relief and said, “Yeah. These few years, I’ve always been worried about Ye Yuan’s safety and never thought about being able to break through to the Deity Realm. Ye Yuan really gave me a huge surprise!”

How could Fang Tian not be surprised?

Once he broke through to the Deity Realm, his longevity would increase greatly. Living another 50 thousand years was absolutely no issue.

More importantly, with his cultivation realm comprehensions, breaking through to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm was also something sooner or later!

At that time, his lifespan would still have an even greater increase!

Ye Yuan really gave him a massive gift!

Right at this time, a terrifying aura surged towards the sky. An overwhelmingly powerful divine beast pressure swept across the entire Law Enforcement Hall.

Fang Tian’s brows raised up, and he said in surprise, “It’s Senior Skydistant! Come, go out and take a look!”

Up above in the sky, an enormous black tortoise divine beast blocked out the sun and covered the sky. A horrifying pressure spread out for tens of thousands of miles.

“Hahaha ... Divine Dao laws finally returned! The thing that Heaven took away from me back then finally still came back! Hahaha ...”

Skydistant’s unbridled laughter was akin to waves of rolling thunder, rippling out, startling countless powerhouses.

To others, even if Heavenly Dao returned, it was also impossible for them to break through to the Deity Realm right away.

But Skydistant was originally a Deity Realm powerhouse. Heavenly Dao returning, he virtually returned to Deity Realm at the first moment.

Furthermore, it was grand completion Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm!

“White Light, it’s really great! Big Brother Yuan he ... he’s alright!”

The Li-er who had always been cool and quiet was also somewhat at a loss on what to do at this time.

These few decades, she was practically worrying about Ye Yuan every minute and second.

All the way until today, a large boulder in her heart finally landed.

White Light also had an excited look and said, “Heh, we have to step up our cultivation. Otherwise, when we reach the Heavenspan World, we’ll be dragging Big Brother down again! Heavenly Dao returning anew, I believe Big Brother’s strength probably advanced by leaps and bounds in these few decades!”

Li-er nodded her head, approving immensely in her heart.

These few decades, she really did not cultivate properly before.

Not that she did not want to, but that she was unable to calm her heart down all along.

Now, she wished that she could enter closed-seclusion straight away and cultivate, striving to break through to Deity Realm as soon as possible. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

...

At the Godsfall Mountain Range, land of exile.

The ancestor here was the same as Skydistant, also returning to the Deity Realm.

“Jun-er, you really gave birth to a fine son! I truly didn’t expect that he actually really did it! Looks like ... him lifting the curse and letting the clansmen walk out of here is also just a matter of time!” said the ancestor.

But Ao Jun sighed slightly and said, “It’s been hard on him these few years!”

Ancestor smiled and said, “You don’t let your imagination run wild now. Heavenly Dao returning, you have to cultivate well! When you break through to the Deity Realm, you’ll be able to resist a portion of the curse’s strength, your lifespan increasing greatly. Otherwise, when Yuan-er returns and discovers that his mother is already gone, wouldn’t he poke a hole in the sky?”

Ao Jun giggled, being tickled by the ancestor too. Nodding, she smiled and said, “What Ancestor said is right. With his temper, he might really do that.”

While at this time, Kunwu looked in the direction of the World Locking Gate and murmured, “That boy really made it there safely! However ... what on earth did he do there? It’s just been 50 years, could it be that he already broke through to the Divine Lord Realm? That’s impossible! Sigh, really envious of Dustless that old fart, to be able to follow there.”

Logically speaking, Ye Yuan had to reach Divine Lord Realm before he could deliver Heavenly Dao and mystic qi to the Immortal Grove World through the two great empyrean spirit treasures.

But it had just been 50 years, and Ye Yuan did it.

Only 50 years to break through from initial-stage Grotto Profound to Divine Lord Realm, this was simply nonsense!

...

“Ahh! S-Sir Ye, you finally exited seclusion!”

Hong Yin was startled, only then realizing that it was Ye Yuan. She was extremely surprised.

“Mm, the closed-seclusion this time reached a critical moment, so the time was a bit long. What’s wrong with the Myriad Treasure Tower, why isn’t there a single customer in this hall?” Ye Yuan asked.

“Isn’t it still the Wang Family! Ever since Sir took care of the Wang Family, they were very low-profile the first few years, low-key until they were almost non-existent anymore. But later on, they invited a Two-star Alchemy God from Brightraise City’s main family, snatching away the Myriad Treasure Tower’s glory all at once! These few years, our Myriad Treasure Tower was jointly suppressed by the City Lord Manor and Wang Family. We are already almost unable to hold on anymore,” Hong Yin said urgently.

“Two-star Alchemy God? Heh, the Wang Family really played a big move, to actually even move out a Two-star Alchemy God! It looks like we were still too benevolent previously!” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

With Ye Yuan’s temperament, after the incident last time, he would have destroyed the Wang Family.

However, Ye Yuan considered Jewelhill City’s situation and knew that once he made a move against the Wang Family, the City Lord Manor would definitely have to intervene, so he let them off.

He Did not expect that they did not repent and correct their mistakes. It went from bad to worse instead.

“Sir Ye, that Two-star Alchemy God of theirs is very formidable. Not only did he push forth divine-grade Divine Essence Pills, he even rolled out heaven-grade Tier 1 middle-grade divine pills! They are trying to exterminate us once and for all!” Hong Yin said indignantly.

Inviting a Two-star Alchemy God already broke Jewelhill City’s unspoken rules. The Myriad Treasure Tower naturally could not fend off.

Ye Yuan said curiously, “The Myriad Treasure Tower is Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s business. Since the Wang Family invited a Two-star Alchemy God, why doesn’t Tower Lord Yang invite a Two-star Alchemy God from the higher-ups?”

Hong Yin said helplessly when she heard this, “Sir doesn’t know this. Our Myriad Treasure Tower is very weak in the entire Wu Meng Capital City area. Not only do we have to bear extremely heavy taxes, but there are also even all kinds of restrictions. Hence, Two-star and above Alchemy Gods are all scarce resources. Normally, they are all allocated to some larger counties. These few years, Tower Lord has also requested from them, but Jewelhill City, this kind of small place, the higher-ups simply just turned a blind eye and let us run our own course.”
