1592 Vastsun Universe Pill

Congealing the pill was one of the most critical steps in alchemy!

One could say that it was akin to ten thousand streams converging into a river.

This cold snort of Ye Yuan’s seemed to directly chop a blade at the convergence area of all the trickles.

That taste was really free from inhibitions to the max.

Head Elder’s face changed and he said in a cold voice, “Ye Yuan! What’s the meaning of this?”

Ye Yuan said with an innocent look, “What did I do? Oh, just now, my throat was uncomfortable and I cleared it. Head Elder’s throat was also uncomfortable just now, right?”

“You!” Ruo Xu was angered until his face was livid, but he actually could not find the words to refute.

Many elders all desperately held back from laughing. Ye Yuan this boy was really too bad.

But this matter was Head Elder not complying with the rules first. No one could find any fault. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although this cold snort of Ye Yuan’s was not to the extent of making Song Qiyang waste all the previous efforts, the quality of the medicinal pill was definitely greatly affected.

“What’s wrong with me? Could it be that I did something wrong, why is Head Elder being so angry?” Ye Yuan said with a face that looked harmless to man and beast.

Ruo Xu’s expression was incredibly grim as he said in a solemn voice, “Elder Ye, very good! You’re very good! In a while, we’ll showcase our true abilities then!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “To be able to get Head Elder’s guidance, this Ye most welcomes it.”

Amidst the somewhat cold atmosphere, everyone’s medicinal pills had completely been refined.

The disciples who could enter the top 30, their strengths were all very outstanding.

Although the Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill was hard, it was not to the point where they could not refine it.

It was just that the good and bad of the qualities varied greatly.

“Open the furnace! Elders, please examine them!” the deacon said in a clear voice.

Everyone opened their medicinal cauldrons. One medicinal pill after another flew out.

When Ning Siyu saw her Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill, she could not help being overjoyed.

She really did it!

Peak high-grade!

Just one more stop and it was superior-grade!

The group of elders walked down the grandstand and saw Ning Siyu’s Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill at first glance, all incomparably shocked.

How could they have imagined that Ning Siyu could actually refine one that was peak high-grade?

“Looks like this round’s situation is already very obvious. Siyu this lass takes first place for all three, overpowering everyone!” said an elder.

Quite a few elders came in front of Xuan Yu and congratulated, “Second Elder, congratulations! The ten spots to enter the Pill Tower this time, your lineage actually occupied half! It’s truly unprecedented!”

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “Got lucky, got lucky, all thanks to Elder Ye!”

Xuan Yu was naturally delighted in his heart. But he also knew that this was all Ye Yuan’s credit and had nothing to do with him.

These few years, he was bullied badly by Head Elder. Today, he finally vented it all out.

Head Elder only came down and circled one round, then returned to the grandstand again. How could he still have any face to stay?

That cold snort of Ye Yuan’s directly disrupted Song Qiyang’s medicinal pill into low-grade.

How could a low-grade medicinal pill be enough to enter the top ten?

Song Qiyang was long gone. He really had no way of staying here anymore.

Today, his face was utterly lost.

After a few more hours, the protector team’s results were also out. Lu Yi and Ding Xun both successfully obtained the spots to enter the Pill Tower.

Once that side ended, Ruo Xu stood up impatiently and said coldly, “Elder Ye, it’s our turn!”

Ye Yuan slowly got up and said with a smile, “Head Elder is very anxious. This state of mind will affect your performance.”

Ruo Xu snorted coldly and said, “That doesn’t need you to worry about! Today, this old man is going to let you know that elders aren’t so easy to be!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How does Head Elder want to compete?”

Ruo Xu said in a deep voice, “Don’t say that this old man is bullying you. Any rank three divine pill, you can have your pick!”

Head Elder was still concerned about his identity in the end and did not wish to get a reputation of bullying the weak in front of so many people.

Therefore, he had Ye Yuan choose the medicinal pill.

In his view, no matter which rank three medicinal pill, he still had no problems crushing Ye Yuan.

He was the exalted Pill Tower’s head elder, a peak Four-star Alchemy God. How could he possibly lose to a Three-star Alchemy God?

Even if Ye Yuan was somewhat different from the rest, his strength far surpassing Three-star Alchemy Gods, he also had full confidence.

But Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Head Elder is actually so magnanimous, then ... I’ll choose the medicinal pill?”

Ruo Xu snorted coldly and said, “You just pick! This old man is the exalted head elder, could it be that I still have to make things difficult in this area for you, a Three-star Alchemy God? Spreading it, wouldn’t it incur the entire imperial city’s people mocking?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, but looked towards Xuan Yu and said, “Second Elder, I wonder what rank three divine pill Head Elder is most adept in?”

Xuan Yu understood it and said with a smile, “The rank three divine pills that Head Elder is good at are too many to enumerate. But to say what he’s best at, it should be the Vastsun Universe Pill. This medicinal pill of his has created many Divine Lord Realm powerhouses for the imperial city!”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, looking at Ruo Xu. He was rather surprised.

He did not think that Ruo Xu was actually good at the Vastsun Universe Pill!

This Vastsun Universe Pill was not an ordinary medicinal pill, but a medicinal pill that could help half-step Divine Lords and grand completion Origin Deity perceive the laws of heaven and earth, comprehending opening up an inner-world.

No medicinal pills could directly let the martial artist breakthrough to Divine Lord Realm. But the Vastsun Universe Pill could increase the chances of a martial artist’s breakthrough, letting them have a chance of taking this final step.

This kind of medicinal pill was hard to find a single one.

Disregarding that the spirit medicines required were very scarce, the requirement of the refiner was also perverse to the extreme.

Even for Four-star Alchemy Gods, those able to refine it were also exceedingly few.

Three-star Alchemy Gods, it had never been heard of that someone refined it before.

Ruo Xu and Xuan Yu, these sorts of existences, could naturally refine it. But Ruo Xu was more than a magnitude stronger than Ruo Xu in this medicinal pill.

The moment Ruo Xu heard, his stomach full of anger turned into ridicule and he said with a cold smile, “Huhu, young people had best not be too impetuous! You want to use the medicinal pill that I’m most adept in to compete with me, the idea is good, but ... you’re too weak!”

Ruo Xu’s meaning was: you want to posture, in the end, you smacked your own face, right?

How could he not perceive that Ye Yuan wanted to challenge the medicinal pill that he was best at?

However, the reality was not as expected!

He completely did not think that Ye Yuan would compete with him with the Vastsun Universe Pill. This medicinal pill, Three-star Alchemy Gods had no capability to refine one!

The other elders also revealed contemptuous looks, feeling that Ye Yuan postured over the top.

“This Elder Ye, the more I look, the more unreliable he seems to be!”

“Yeah, want to say that Ning Siyu was taught by him, I don’t believe even if beaten to death.”

“Youngsters, having a bit of strength made them not know the immensity of heaven and earth anymore. How can the Vastsun Universe Pill be what he can refine?”
