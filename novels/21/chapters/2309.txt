Chapter 2313: Perilous Battle!

On top of the summit cloud platform, two old men were currently drinking tea leisurely.

Fragrance lingered.

One of them, a lean old man, had his eyes shut the whole time, looking like he was asleep.

The lean old man said in a hoary voice, “Ask Not two words, have you solved it?”

The middle-aged man in blue robes by the side said coolly, “Old thing, after so many years, you’re still not willing to let me go?”

The lean old man said, “The path of Dao is full of setbacks to begin with. If you can’t even clear this hurdle, how will you seek Dao?”

The middle-aged man in blue robes had a disdainful look on his face. These two words had delayed him far too much time, making him waste his best years.

When he came to realize the truth, everything was already too late.

Missing the best time for cultivation, people’s cultivation speed would become slower and slower.

Just like Ye Yuan, his onslaught was currently indeed unstoppable. But once it was delayed, that would be thousands, tens of thousands, even millions of years.

Naturally, this could not be blamed on only the Medicine Ancestor. Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s own Dao heart also had flaws existing. It was just that it was caught by Medicine Ancestor.

“These Ask Not two words, I can’t solve it, but Ye Yuan he solved it. Otherwise, why would you, this old fellow, have this idea to organize the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time?”

“Such an amazing rising star, how can this ancestor not be alarmed? This Second Sage compared to you, just who is a little stronger?”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest looked at the lean old man meaningfully and said, “If you measure him yourself, wouldn’t you know?”

While talking, several dozen figures landed on the cloud platform. The two in the front were precisely Ye Yuan and Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy.

When he saw that lean old man, Ye Yuan’s gaze never looked away.

This old man had his eyes shut all this while, his aura extremely feeble, looking like he was about to pass away at any time.

But he did not know why. The person gave Ye Yuan an unfathomable feeling.

This kind of feeling was indescribable. All in all, he was powerful, indescribably powerful!

Ye Yuan had a strange feeling that this old man before his eyes was not a person, but a medicinal pill, a medicinal pill that led to Great Dao.

Even the Sacred Ancestor High Priest did not give Ye Yuan this kind of terrifying feeling too.

It was as if this old man was born for medicinal pills. It was as if he ... was Alchemy Dao.

The lean old man used a dry voice and said, “Young Friend Ye, please sit.”

Ye Yuan did not decline and sat down beside Sacred Ancestor High Priest. The other ancestors also took their seats one after another.

“Young Friend Ye, we’ve met before.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Yes, in Ask Not.”

The Medicine Ancestor that time was extremely powerful, his figure full of power and grandeur as if a celestial deity descending upon the mortal world.

But Ye Yuan did not expect that the Medicine Ancestor’s true self was actually such a thin and emaciated-looking thin old man.

Suddenly, not seeing the Medicine Ancestor have any movement either, but his entire person already disappeared on the spot.

An incomparably huge chessboard suddenly appeared above the void. The entire Cloudheart Realm could see it clearly.

The projection of a lean old man appeared on one end of the chessboard.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and was just about to step out, but he heard Sacred Ancestor High Priest suddenly say, “Be careful!”

Ye Yuan turned around and said smilingly, “Senior Sacred Ancestor seems to be afraid!”

Wing actually nodded and said, “Yes, this old man thought that I can not fear him anymore. But meeting once again, this old man is still nervous. Of course, what’s more important is that he got stronger!”

The Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest were clearly not really chatting leisurely.

Each and every one of the two of their actions and every word, they were all crossing swords.

But Sacred Ancestor High Priest did not occupy any advantage at all.

He thought that so many years had passed, his heart knot had already been unknotted.

But seeing Medicine Ancestor again, only then did he discover that his own Dao heart was still unable to face him unperturbed when in front of him.

Wing was not worried that Ye Yuan would lose, but worried that Ye Yuan’s Dao heart was the same as him, with a crack.

Ye Yuan’s talent was greater than his, he believed that Medicine Ancestor would be even more ruthless!

But Ye Yuan smiled brilliantly and said, “Not scared that he’s strong, just scared that he isn’t strong!”

Finished talking, his figure disappeared on the spot.

Above the void, Ye Yuan’s enormous projection exhibited in front of everyone.

Everyone held their breaths. Clearly, they did not expect that these two people actually did not talk nonsense, and clashed together so straightforwardly.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy said to Sacred Ancestor High Priest with a smile, “Lord Sacred Ancestor, the stars change positions, but Master’s opponent turned into Second Sage, wonder how you feel about it?”

Wing smiled and said, “He’s stronger than me.”

Lastingjoy smiled and said, “He isn’t stronger than you.”

Wing said, “Your master understands it. He’s stronger than me.”

Lastingjoy smiled and said, “So that’s how it is. It’s just that Lord Sacred Ancestor seems to be lacking in confidence.”

Wing said, “He’s always unexpected.”

While the two people crossed swords with words, Ye Yuan already took action!

It was only to see him pointing at the void, directly landing his piece.

Pah!

A crisp sound seemed like a piece landed amidst heaven and earth, the sound of Great Dao suffusing the world. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

An enormous Tai Chi diagram directly occupied a large area.

Pah!

The Medicine Ancestor landed a piece and Ye Yuan’s Tai Chi diagram directly collapsed.

A berserk aura spread out from the chessboard, suffusing the entire Cloudheart Realm.

Strong!

A might that made people suffocate!

Ye Yuan’s Dao could occupy a portion of the chessboard?

While Medicine Ancestor’s Dao could spread out of the chessboard.

The level was clear at a glance!

The eyebrows of the Ye Yuan opposite furrowed heavily, feeling an unprecedented pressure.

This was the hardest alchemy battle in his life, not one of!

Just one move, and it made him unable to withstand it.

The world that he carefully constructed, the Medicine Ancestor determined the entire world’s framework with just a glance, and then he completely occupied this world!

The Medicine Ancestor opposite him and the Medicine Ancestor inside Ask Not were completely the strength of two different worlds.

This was the true strength of the alchemy path’s number one person!

One day, two days ... one month!

Ye Yuan’s second piece was considered for more than a month!

Outside of Cloudheart Mountain, Yun Yi’s brows furrowed tightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “The Medicine Ancestor is well-deserving of being the alchemy path’s number one person. I’ve never seen Master have this kind of expression during an alchemy battle before.”

Ning Siyu said gloomily, “This old man, with one look and I already know he has no good intentions.”

Yun Yi sighed and said, “This is the world of Dao. It’s too profound! To be able to stump Master until like this, no idea just what realm Medicine Ancestor has reached.”

Ning Siyu said with an ugly expression, “Master wouldn’t lose, right?”

Yun Yi shook his head and said, “This time, I’m afraid that he’s really going to lose. However, the most terrifying thing isn’t losing!:

Ning Siyu was taken aback and said, “What else is more terrifying than losing?”

Yun Yi said with a solemn expression, “It’s naturally Dao heart! Each person’s Dao is different, who’s Dao is correct, who’s Dao is wrong, will be more distinct in this level of powerhouses’ struggle. Losing, one might very likely lose their Dao heart! Master won Heavenly Emperor Distantbook, then ruined his Dao heart later. It’s likely hard for his strength to improve anymore in the countless tens of thousands of years after today. Also, there’s the Sacred Ancestor High Priest, because he lost to Medicine Ancestor back then, and lost his Dao heart, that’s why he’d remain at a standstill.”

Ning Siyu opened her mouth wide, a look of astonishment on her face.

She originally felt that this was merely an alchemy battle and that there was nothing dangerous.

But now, she could not help worrying about her master.
