Chapter 1595 Astronomical Price Medicinal Pill!

Ruo Xu knew that even if he risked this old life, it was still impossible to refine a void spirit divine-grade medicinal pill.

This kind of medicinal pill only existed in legends.

In reality, he lived to a ripe old age and had seen before God knows how many geniuses. But he had never heard of anyone who could refine a void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill when at Four-star Alchemy God.

As for Three-star Alchemy God, that went even more without saying.

Therefore, he admitted defeat very sensibly.

Of course, he did not have the face to stay here anymore either. After conceding, he left dejectedly.

But at this time, everyone’s thoughts were already long not on Head Elder.

An elder of the Wang Family said in a clear voice, “Elder Ye, sell this medicinal pill to our Wang Family! We’ll offer 300 million divine essence stones!”

“Elder Ye, don’t listen to him, sell to our Yan Family! We’ll offer 500 million divine essence stones!”

“Our Liu Family offers 550 million!”

...

Suddenly, these major families’ leaders seemed to thrash around violently, arguing until Ye Yuan had a headache.

According to the Pill Tower’s rules, even though this Vastsun Universe Pill was refined by Ye Yuan, the ownership belonged to the Pill Tower.

But, if the Pill Tower decided to sell it, 30% of the divine essence stones obtained would be given Ye Yuan.

Ordinary rank three divine pills, even the Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill that Ye Yuan refined at the south city, also merely sold at a price of 50 million.

These major families, the moment they opened their mouths, it was several hundred million divine essence stones. This price already greatly exceeded the price of ordinary rank three divine pills.

“Stop! All stop for me!” Ye Yuan shouted loudly.

But no one listened to him. Those people were all still clamoring, virtually falling into madness.

Void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill, who did not want one?

As for the price, that was all not a problem.

Ye Yuan seriously could not bear it anymore and shouted angrily, “All shut up for me!”

This yell, Ye Yuan mustered up divine essence, directly overwhelming everyone.

When those people saw that Ye Yuan was angry, they indeed stopped.

Got to be joking. Elder Ye was exceedingly formidable. Offending him, wouldn’t they be unable to bear the consequences of it?

Seeing everyone quieten down, Ye Yuan said to Xuan Yu, “Second Elder, this matter had best be left to you.”

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “Elders, since everyone is determined to get this Vastsun Universe Pill, then why don’t ... we hold an auction on the spot to determine the ownership of this medicinal pill. What does everybody think?”

The moment everyone heard, they could not help being surprised.

Who said that Second Elder was a benign person who never tried to offend anybody, this method was vicious!

Auctioning on the spot, no one had any way to rely on connections.

After today, the various major families would definitely pull all sorts of strings to find the Pill Tower to intercede.

At that time, wanting to sell at a higher price would clearly be impossible.

But now, open and transparent, everyone used money to talk. No one could say anything.

This way, they could maximize the benefits of this medicinal pill. It was a good thing for the Pill Tower too.

After all, the Pill Tower had so many elders and disciples. The spirit medicines required and divine essence stones expended were at an extremely terrifying number.

The Pill Tower needed to earn money too!

“I have no objections, do it as Second Elder says then.”

“Mn, let nature take its course, I have no objections.”

“Just nice, we can also test the value of a void spirit divine-grade medicinal pill. I think that this method is good!”

...

In front of so many people, even if the various elders had some ideas, they naturally did not dare to refute Second Elder either.

After all, saying this sort of word publicly would harm the Pill Tower’s interests.

Who dared to slam themselves onto the spearhead at the risk of universal condemnation.

Second Elder smiled slightly and said, “Alright, then it’s settled. Deacon Zhang, you’re the best at this kind of thing. This auction will be hosted by you then.”

Deacon Zhang stepped out of the ranks and said, “Yes, Second Elder.”

Below, those major families’ powerhouses all cried bitterness without ceasing.

They knew that this medicinal pill was too popular!

Once it entered the auction process, it would definitely greatly exceed three or five hundred million.

This way, for them to want to get this medicinal pill, they would have to spend a lot more money.

Who said that Second Elder was easy to bully? When an honest person schemed, it killed even more subtly without shedding blood.

However, they were seriously unable to refuse the temptation of the void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill. This medicinal pill, they were determined to get it.

One had to know, this medicinal pill could truly enhance the family’s strength. Compared to those ordinary medicinal pills, even spending up to a billion was also worth the money.

After all, money could be earned again, but this medicinal pill would not be refined during normal days.

The Heavenly Eagle Imperial City had already existed for no idea how many tens of thousands of years, a void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill was an epoch-making first time ever!

...

Deacon Zhang carefully collected the medicinal pill, placed it inside the jade box, and put it on the table in front of him.

“Everybody, this Zhang has consulted with the elders earlier, the base price for this Vastsun Universe Pill is ... 500 million low-grade divine essence stones! Each increment has to be no less than 20 million divine essence stones,” Deacon Zhang said in a clear voice.

At this time, the large and small families in the inner city already sent a representative over to bid.

Even those families that did not come also hurriedly sent people over after hearing the news.

But when they heard the base price set by Deacon Zhang, many small families immediately flinched back.

500 million low-grade divine essence stones, this base price already reached the price of rank four divine pills!

This was still just the base price. The final transaction price would definitely be above one billion.

This price was too scary.

Not that they did not have this financial power, it was just that betting all of their financial resources on one medicinal pill was clearly unwise.

Actually, these small families had long known that this medicinal pill, they definitely could not compete with those major families.

But not coming to compete a bit, they could not get through this hurdle either.

“Now, the auction begins!” Deacon Zhang said in a clear voice.

“600 million!”

“650 million!”

“700 million!”

...

“900 million!”

“One billion!”

Everyone all knew that this auction’s price would definitely be very horrifying. But no one could have expected that the price actually rose to one billion so quickly.

Deacon Zhang was also secretly tongue-tied in his heart. He had hosted God knows how many auctions before and had never seen before such an enthusiastic increase in prices. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Normally, in the auctioning process, when there was hesitation, he would make some remarks, encouraging everyone to bid an even higher price.

But this time, he had yet to say a single word and the price already doubled!

“1.2 billion!”

“Humph! This Vastsun Universe Pill, our Shi Family is hell-bent on it! 1.5 billion!” a Shi Family’s elder shouted.

The Shi Family and Ning Family were the same, both major families of the inner city with tremendous financial power.

The price of 1.5 billion frightened everyone at once.

A rank three divine pill was actually auctioned for an astronomical price of 1.5 billion, this was something that no one dared to imagine in the past.

Deacon Zhang was incomparably shocked in his heart. This was still his first time encountering such an auction.

In virtually a blink of an eye, the price tripled!

“1.5 billion! Elder Shi Song has offered a price of 1.5 billion, is there any higher?” Deacon Zhang finally had a chance to speak.

After a period of silence, a middle-aged man slowly opened his mouth and said, “2 billion!”
