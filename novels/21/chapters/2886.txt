Chapter 2892 Deciding with a Word!

You Jin was slightly shocked in his heart!

Everyone said that this new Blood Divine Son killed people without batting an eyelid. Upon meeting today, it was indeed the case!

Bloodsword was Emperor Sakra Heaven. You’re killing him as you please?

Making drastic changes to an organization upon taking charge was the first order of business to kill an Emperor Sakra Heaven?

Impressive!

“This … Bloodsword is an Emperor Sakra Heaven after all …”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “His Hegemon road has basically been cut off already! If he’s killed, he’s killed. What does it matter? Could it be that our blood race is short of an Emperor Sakra Heaven?”

While that might be the case, but … Emperor Sakra Heaven was Emperor Sakra Heaven after all!

It was also not that easy for the blood race to groom an Emperor Sakra Heaven.

But Ye Yuan’s domineeringness still made Hegemon You Jin somewhat dissatisfied.

No matter what, he was a Hegemon too!

Could you not save some face for me?

By the side, Bloodsword’s complexion was long already ashen as he complained tearfully, “Your Highness, I … I was wrong! I beg you, spare my lowly life! The great battle is about to start right away, it will also be a good thing for you to let me go kill a few Heaven One powerhouses!”

Kill your head!

Your Father wants to kill you so that fewer people will die at your hands!

“No need. Having you or missing you is inconsequential. It’s been more than 20 days. You all have not taken South Qi Giant City either. What do I want you for? Bloodpromise, he’s your subordinate. You do it,” Ye Yuan said to Bloodpromise with a nonchalant look.

Actually, Ye Yuan wanted to kill Bloodpromise more. This guy was the real butcher.

The Heaven one powerhouses that died at his hands were beyond count.

One should not look at how Bloodpromise suffered losses at Feng Xiaotian’s hands repeatedly. He was a genuine origin powerhouse!

In terms of strength, he was not the slightest bit weaker than those Extreme Medicine Sect pavilion elders.

Otherwise, having lost an army of 100 thousand the last time, it was impossible for the blood race to let him take charge of this army again.

It could be seen that the blood race quite acknowledged his strength as well.

Bloodpromise used an affirming gaze and looked toward Hegemon You Jin.

The latter nodded slightly, which was counted as approving it.

Hegemon You Jin was helpless too!

The new Blood Divine Son was a popular man. If he could not even take care of this first order of business, the Blood Divine Son would not spare him too.

At that time, probably even Lord Wang Zuo would be looking for trouble.

Therefore, he could only sacrifice Bloodsword.

Seeing this scene, Bloodsword’s complexion was ashen, knowing that he was dead for sure.

Bloodpromise let out a sigh and said, “Younger Brother Bloodsword, I’m sorry! This is the first order that His Highness gave. This seat can’t defy it either!”

Finished saying, Bloodpromise’s palm pressed against Bloodsword’s head and spat out a force. The latter was directly annihilated.

From start to end, Bloodsword did not dare to resist in the slightest.

Behind Ye Yuan, Yang Qing’s heart was about to jump out.

This was too freaking … awesome!

One sentence and an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse died!

One had to know, how great a price did Heaven One had to pay to kill an Emperor Sakra Heaven?

Even if there was the help of the city protecting grand array, wanting to kill an Emperor Realm powerhouse was also as hard as ascending to heaven!

In the great battle under the Absolute Heaven Barrier, there were many wounded but few deaths.

For so many years, the Emperor Realm powerhouses that Heaven One really killed were actually not many either.

On the contrary, many of the blood race’s Emperor Realm powerhouses died at the hands of their own people.

But today, Ye Yuan decided with a word, eradicating a mighty Emperor Sakra Heaven expert!

Wonderful!

After the blood race learned that their Blood Divine Son was actually a human, Yang Qing wondered what kind of reaction it would be like?

Even thinking about it felt a little exciting!

Bloodpromise had a troubled expression too. Bloodsword was considered his subordinate, and his relationship with him was still considered pretty good.

Today, he actually personally ended him!

“Bloodpromise, you seem to be very reluctant!” Ye Yuan looked at Bloodpromise and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Bloodpromise was startled in his heart and hurriedly said, “H-Haha, why would I? Bloodsword he actually dared to plot to murder Your Highness, that’s his way of seeking death! This subordinate is honored to the extreme to be able to act for Your Highness!”

Ye Yuan’s face fell, and he said with a cold snort, “Don’t pull this crap with this liege! Bloodpromise, you’re a piece of trash! This army of 300 thousand were all drawn from the elites who participated in the hundred sons battle, their combat power increased more than tenfold compared to before! Even like this, you failed to take down South Qi Giant City!”

Bloodpromise had a look of embarrassment as he said, “Yes, Your Highness is right! Your Highness, please give me a few more days!”

An origin powerhouse was scolded as trash by someone just like that.

But, he did not have any temper at all, and he even had to humor Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan flicked his sleeves and said lightly, “No need! Three days later, launch the general offensive! Emperor Realm powerhouses will be commanded by you. Those under Emperor Realm will be commanded by this liege! This liege will let you know how incompetent you are!”

With one sentence, he directly stripped Bloodpromise of his military power.

With regards to this, Bloodpromise was naturally very disdainful in his heart.

Not being in his position, one totally would not know how difficult this battle was.

This time, he really led his men in a charge, fighting with Feng Xiaotian until both sides were wounded and defeated and did not shrink back at all.

However, it still made no difference.

Each time, they would see hope of breaching the city. But every time, they would return in defeat.

Really think that you can change all these because you’re the Blood Divine Son?

War was not just about competing in strength!

However, he did not care too much about Ye Yuan seizing power.

It would be best for this battle to fail.

With Blood Divine Son His Highness as the meat cushion, his failure would not seem so conspicuous anymore.

“With Your Highness personally holding down the fort, our blood race will surely win this battle! Breaking down the Absolute Heaven Barrier will be three days later!” Bloodpromise curried favor as he said.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Bloodpromise, don’t give me that! Now, lead this liege to take a look at South Qi Giant City!”

No matter how one looked at him, Ye Yuan behaved like a complacent genius.

Such a genius was also the easiest to suffer a disastrous defeat.

Bloodpromise was filled with disdain in his heart. No matter how amazing you were, you were also merely just a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Really think that you could dictate this way on your own?

However, Ye Yuan’s approach was quite agreeable with Giant Net City’s blood race powerhouses.

This Blood Divine Son was decisive in going for the kill and executed things in a sweeping manner. He was a good commander-in-chief!

Everyone felt invigorated with such a Blood Divine Son.

Ye Yuan swept across those in the same rank in the hundred sons battle. It had already swept with great fervor.

Presently, Ye Yuan was simply a god-like existence in their hearts.

Very soon, Ye Yuan brought the hundred sons powerhouses and passed through the passageway, arriving outside of South Qi Giant City. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Seeing the present South Qi Giant City, Ye Yuan and Yang Qing’s hearts shook wildly.

He was really unable to imagine how Feng Xiaotian and the powerhouses in the city pulled through these 20 over days.

There were corpses everywhere outside the

city!

In this brief respite, no one went to collect the dead bodies either.

It was because the powerhouses in the city were accumulating all of their strength to prepare for the next frenzied great battle!

South Qi Giant City was already in utter dilapidation.

The city protecting grand array had also lost its fierceness back then a long time ago.

The scattered formation path powerhouses were currently using the Lesser Origin Restoration Art to repair the array formation.

It was just that even with the Lesser Origin Restoration Art, there was no way to restore the array formation to its peak within a short time either.

This was because those formation path powerhouses were already pretty much all dead.

During the past 20 days, it was an endless darkness to South Qi Giant City!

The appearance of Ye Yuan’s party made South Qi Giant City immediately go on alert.

Feng Xiaotian was the first to rush up on top of the city walls, looking over here from afar.

When his gaze landed on that figure right at the front, his entire person was immediately petrified.

The shock in his heart simply could not be any greater!
