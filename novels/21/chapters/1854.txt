Chapter 1858: You Have No Chance

“Ye Yuan! It’s really you! Today, you won’t be so lucky. I’ll see who can still save you!”

When Zhuo Han saw Ye Yuan, anger immediately rose up in his heart.

But he was also extremely shocked in his heart. Not seeing him for several hundred years, Ye Yuan actually reached peak Second Firmament Celestial Deity like flying.

This cultivation speed was not the slightest bit inferior when compared to him!

Was this guy still that trash who could even break through to the Divine Lord Realm?

One had to know, back then when he saw Ye Yuan, he was just a grand completion Origin Deity.

Ye Yuan looked at Zhuo Han and said smilingly, “Don’t need anyone to save me. Dealing with you, do I still need others?”

The moment Zhuo Han heard this, he could not help laughing loudly and said, “A measly Second Firmament Celestial Deity also dares to engage in wild talk! Today, I’m going to beat you until you kneel on the ground and beg for mercy!”

Upon recalling that someone said just now that Leng Qiuling and Ye Yuan were very close, Zhuo Han could not help overflowing with jealousy. Old grudge and new hatred welled up together in his heart.

Leng Qiuling’s face turned cold and she said, “Zhuo Han, this place is Thousand Soar Mansion, not Heavenly Water Imperial Capital. It’s not your turn to be unbridled!”

Zhuo Han could not help choking when he heard that. Leng Qiuling’s protective attitude triggered his jealousy even more.

Zhuo Han looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Hiding behind a woman’s back again? This place just happens to be the practicing field. If you’re a man, step forward and compete with me. Let Qiuling take a look at who’s her man!”

Leng Qiuling’s face got colder and colder. This Zhuo Han was really too insolent, to actually say such things.

She did not have any feelings toward him. Yet, his face was extremely thick, viewing her as his exclusive chunk of meat.

“Zhuo Han, on the account that you’re a guest, I’ve already exercised forbearance with you time and again! Keep talking nonsense and I won’t be courteous!” Leng Qiuling said.

Zhuo Han was still unmoved. Looking at Ye Yuan, he said with a cold smile, “Gutless coward, trash who only knows how to hide behind women!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Putting aside whether I’m a gutless coward or not, the thickness of your skin, I’m ashamed of my inferiority!”

Zhuo Han sneered and said, “Manor Lord Gu is very approving of my and Qiuling’s matters. Now that Master has gone to him to propose a marriage alliance, this wedding is already more than half succeeded, how is my skin thick?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Is that so? Then do you know why I’m not a Thousand Soar Mansion’s disciple but can go in and out of this place any time? Then do you know Qiuling and I are practically together from morning to night these few years? You have no chance.”

Zhuo Han’s face could not help changing when he heard that. He still thought that Ye Yuan was a Thousand Soar Mansion’s disciple. Zhuo Han did not expect that he actually was not.

Leng Qiuling’s icy-cold face had a rare hint of blush.

Actually, she and Ye Yuan were both clear that Gu Tianque was indeed creating conditions to let the two of them get close.

Ye Yuan’s mysterious identity had long been recognized by Gu Tianque. Otherwise, he also would not stop for three days and not move because of a sentence from Ye Yuan.

But between them, one was cold as frost, while the other was not in the mood for romance. There had not been any progress all along.

Leng Qiuling naturally knew that Ye Yuan was helping her out of her predicament, so she did not say anything and just tacitly approved of it.

When Zhuo Han saw this scene, a hint of foreboding premonition arose in his heart.

But he did not believe it at all!

Gu Tianque had always viewed him favorably. It was impossible for him to change his tune.

Coupled with his illustrious identity, he and Leng Qiuling were well-matched in status.

“Who the hell do you think you are? A mere Second Firmament Celestial Deity is also worthy of Qiuling? If you have the capability, step forward like a man and compete with me.”

Zhuo Han saw that Ye Yuan was only a Second Firmament Celestial Deity. He was certain that he did not dare to accept the challenge at all, repeatedly using those words to squeeze Ye Yuan.

The surrounding Thousand Soar Mansion disciples also all revealed disdainful looks, feeling that Ye Yuan was too unmanly.

Ye Yuan and Leng Qiuling traveled as a couple all the time. All the disciples had long found it displeasing to their eyes.

Leng Qiuling was the goddess in their hearts, beautiful and also highly talented, but she was followed around every day by a Second Firmament Celestial Deity. They felt that it was very offensive to the eye.

In their hearts, only Zhuo Han, this kind of background, could match up to Leng Qiuling.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Qiuling, let’s go, let this mad dog bark here. I believe that very soon, he’ll know that he had no chance long ago.”

Leng Qiuling nodded her head, turned around, and was about to leave with Ye Yuan.

She frequently sparred with Ye Yuan these few years and naturally knew that it was not that Ye Yuan did not dare, he was just disdainful.

Zhuo Han was only an initial-stage Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity. He was not Ye Yuan’s match at all.

Speaking of which, Zhuo Han’s talent was actually not beneath Leng Qiuling’s. But precisely because Ye Yuan caused trouble on the Heavenspan Mountain, it made Zhuo Han delay his cultivation.

Seeing that Leng Qiuling was so obedient, Zhuo Han’s fire of jealousy was practically going to burst through the barriers.

He blocked the two people’s path with a flash. He looked at Ye Yuan angrily as he said, “Somebody who gave birth to, but nobody to raise. You’d best stay further away from Qiuling for me. Otherwise, I’ll make you regret being born in this world. You don’t take a piss and look at the reflection too, see who the hell you are! Snatching women with me, are you worthy?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze gradually became icy-cold. He originally did not want to stoop to Zhuo Han’s level. But this guy did not have any knowledge of his limits at all. His mouth was really asking for a beating!

Only to see his figure move, arriving at the center of the martial practicing field, and say in a cold voice, “Didn’t you want to make me accept your challenge like a man? Fine, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Seeing this scene, Zhuo Han was not alarmed, but rejoiced instead, and said with a big laugh, “Hahaha, that’s more like a man! You rest assured. I’ll teach you how to behave yourself properly!”

Leng Qiuling heaved a slight sigh in her heart. What was called seeking one’s doom was like Zhuo Han, right?

Zhuo Han’s figure moved, arriving before Ye Yuan, and he said with a big laugh, “Honestly speaking, for you to be able to cultivate to the Celestial Deity Realm, it really exceeded my expectations. But ... ants are ants in the end. You’ll never be able to understand what’s called a genius!”

Swoosh!

Zhuo Han’s voice had yet to fade and Ye Yuan’s entire person already vanished.

He already successfully had his fury stoked up by Zhuo Han and could not be bothered to talk rubbish with him at all.

Zhuo Han did not take Ye Yuan seriously at all and was caught off-guard by this sudden turn of events.

Smack!

A clear slap echoed out, Zhuo Han’s entire person was slapped flying out.

“This is a so-called genius? Less than even an ant! Not much strength, but spew mouthfuls of shit,” Ye Yuan said coldly.

Everyone was astounded. Thousand Soar Mansion’s disciples had never seen Ye Yuan make a move before and had always been very disdainful towards him.

However, the moment Ye Yuan made his move, it astonished all of them.

Zhuo Han was slapped silly by Ye Yuan’s slap and only came back to his senses after a while. Pointing at Ye Yuan, he said with a furious roar, “Despicable villain, to actually sneak attack! Today, I must tear you to shreds!”

Zhuo Han’s words made quite a few people secretly nod their heads.

Although Ye Yuan’s move just now was stunning, it was still Zhuo Han who was too careless after all.

A genuine frontal clash, Ye Yuan was definitely not a match.

“Is that so? Then this time, it’s your turn!” Ye Yuan looked at Zhuo Han and said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan’s contemptuous smile deeply triggered Zhuo Han. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It was only to see him grit his teeth. The world power of a First Firmament Celestial Deity gushed out frenziedly, and he rushed over toward Ye Yuan.
