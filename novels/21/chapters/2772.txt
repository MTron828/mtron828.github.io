Chapter 2778: I Have a Sword!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“How can he be so fast?”

He did not escape very far when Li Changsheng discovered something amiss.

Ye Yuan’s speed was too fast!

At the rate of this speed, Ye Yuan would be able to catch up to him before long.

Suddenly, Li Changsheng’s expression changed, and he cried out in surprise, “This boy gained enlightenment when … he broke through?”

Nine laws Dao tribulation; the power was naturally extremely terrifying. Using nine chances to die and one chance to live to describe it was not overboard too.

But, once the tribulation was successfully overcome, the benefits obtained would naturally be huge too.

The more rules that descended, the closer the tribulation-taker would be to Heavenly Dao, and naturally the greater the inspiration too!

When Ye Yuan was breaking through, his spatial rule comprehension was the deepest, directly reaching the fifth level!

Li Changsheng secretly cussed, too monstrous!

“If this boy doesn’t die, he will definitely be a mortal malady! Take your life while you’re ill! Since you dare to come, then this exalt will send you off!”

Li Changsheng made his resolve and suddenly stopped his figure.

The moment he stopped, Ye Yuan caught up in a few breaths.

When Li Changsheng saw Ye Yuan, his heart immediately calmed down.

The current Ye Yuan was covered in blood all over, his breathing slightly weak.

He was still coughing blood non-stop.

Clearly, the Eight Legions War Generals’ self-detonation earlier caused tremendous damage to Ye Yuan.

“Hahaha?… with how dreadful you look, you also want to come and kill me?” Li Changsheng said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan looked at Li Changsheng coldly and said in a solemn voice, “Today, you must die!”

Li Changsheng was indifferent and could not help laughing as he said, “You’re only left with half a life now, and yet you’re actually still putting sham courage here!”

Ye Yuan held the Dragon Spring Sword in his hand and said with a pant, “I have a sword. It’s enough … to kill you!”

The current Ye Yuan virtually could not even stand firm anymore, seeming like he might fall down at any moment.

But, his gaze was incomparably firm.

Not killing Li Changsheng, he swore not to return!

Li Changsheng scoffed and said, “With just that sword formation of yours? It’s very strong, but don’t you forget; no matter how injured this exalt is, I’m also a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven! Forget it. Since you came to seek death, then this exalt will send you off!”

But Ye Yuan ignored him because he could no longer afford to drag it on.

The Dragon Spring Sword in his hand was gently released, turning into nothingness.

Then, the All-Encompassing Sacred Tree started growing, growing all the way until grand completion fourth form!

In the breakthrough previously, Ye Yuan only had spatial rule that broke through to the fifth level.

The other two Daos did not break through.

Therefore, his Great Dao Transformation was still the fourth form.

When Li Changsheng saw the situation, he could not help laughing and said, “I was wondering what trump card you have. It turns out that it’s this sword formation? Three laws transformation, grand completion fourth form, it’s indeed very strong. But, using it to kill me, it’s still insufficient!”

He was naturally aware of the power of Ye Yuan’s sword formation.

Previously, he used this sword formation and trapped 16 Saint Sovereign Heavens. There were even the Eight Legions War Generals among them!

By relying on this sword formation, if Ye Yuan was at his peak state, he would indeed have the capability to fight with him.

But sadly, with Ye Yuan’s current state, he could grind him down till death too!

Ye Yuan still did not pay attention to him, the last divine essence in his body gushing out!

“All-Encompassing Sacred Tree, Sword of Heaven Killing, condense!”

At this time, the All-Encompassing Sacred Tree did not transform into a sword formation, but the entire trunk condensed into an enormous sword, emitting an aura that made people feel heart palpitations.

When Li Changsheng saw this scene, his pupils constricted.

This condensed long sword had an awe-inspiring sword energy. The sword intent it exuded rose straight to the firmament.

Extremely far away, the group of Saint Sovereign Heavens felt this astonishing sword energy too!

“What a strong sword energy!”

“This seems like … it’s Ye Yuan’s sword energy! We can even feel it from such a distance; it’s too terrifying!”

“Sword intent soaring to the sky, rising straight to the firmament! Is this sword … going to poke a hole in the sky?”

… …

Each and every one of these Saint Sovereign Heavens turned pale with fright. It was truly that this sword was too terrifying!

When the two people left earlier, they had to at least escape more than several hundred miles away too! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

This astonishing sword intent could actually spread so far. One could only imagine how terrifying it was.

Currently, countless powerhouses felt this terrifying sword intent.

The Rainclear Continent was in an uproar!

Sword energy spanning unobstructed for 100 thousand miles, one sword light making 19 continents feel a chill!

It was talking about Ye Yuan’s current sword!

This was also Ye Yuan’s greatest killing move!

Ye Yuan’s Great Dao Transformation, All-Encompassing Sacred Tree, had always condensed transformed swords from leaves, but he had never utilized the trunk before!

This was his ultimate move and also a move that bet his future!

The sword’s name ‘Heaven Killing’ was more than just talk!

This move could virtually leapfrog realms to kill the enemy. It was too heaven-defying!

After he cultivated to an extremely high realm, he might really be able to actually poke a hole in the sky!

And once this move was unleashed, his Dao would also trigger the wrath of Heavenly Dao, thus shattering his Dao.

Once this move was unleashed, the All-Encompassing Sacred Tree would be annihilated!

So, unless it was a last resort, Ye Yuan would not use this move.

But currently, he could not care less about it anymore.

Li Changsheng, who was opposite of him, was still mocking Ye Yuan a moment ago. But at this time, his expression changed wildly.

This sword, forget about him right now. Even at his peak state, he could not receive it too!

Too horrifying!

Before the sword was unsheathed, he already felt that his body was about to be sliced into countless pieces!

“Lunatic! You’re a complete and utter mad man! Using this move, your Dao will completely crumble!” Li Changsheng screamed shrilly.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “So what? Sect Master, this Ye will repay the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect with this sword today! Your spirits in heaven can rest in peace!”

Finished saying, he used the last bit of his strength and unleashed the Sword of Heaven Killing!

Swish!

The sword light flashed past, Li Changsheng’s body was directly sliced into countless pieces without even having time to scream out.

To this sword, Li Changsheng was merely an ant!

After Ye Yuan unleashed this sword, his entire person fell down, without the slightest strength in his entire body anymore!

Li Changsheng was already dead, but the Sword of Heaven Killing was not extinguished but flew straight toward the sky.

Crack! Crack!

Above the void, lightning flashed and appeared.

Suddenly, a bolt out of the blue fell down!

Boom!

The Sword of Heaven Killing exploded with a loud bang!

Everything dissipated into nothing.

Ye Yuan coughed, vomiting out a large mouthful of fresh blood, then fell unconscious.

… …

Very soon, Big Yellow’s figure landed.

When he saw Ye Yuan’s miserable state, his heart could not help twitching.

“Senior, he …”

Mi Tian gave a long sigh and said, “He’s fine, but his road of martial arts … has probably been cut off!”

Big Yellow’s expression changed, and he said, “This … How is this possible?”

Mi Tian said, “This old man also didn’t expect that this boy’s transformed sword is actually so heaven-defying! Sword of Heaven Killing,?heh heh,?what a fine Sword of Heaven Killing! However, he incurred Heaven’s jealousy before achieving success! His transformed sword is destroyed! Without the recognition of Heavenly Dao, he won’t be able to condense the transformation sword anymore in the future! With Martial Dao not taking form, what difference is there from ordinary people?”

Monstrous waves were set off in Big Yellow’s heart!

Transformation sword incurring Heaven’s jealousy!

How heaven-defying was Master Ye’s sword?

No wonder he could bring down nine laws Dao tribulation!

But now, how would Master Ye’s road in the future be decided?

Without the transformation sword, could he still match up to those peerless heaven’s chosen?

With Master Ye’s pride, he must be unable to bear it, right?
