Chapter 1274: In a Flick of a Finger, an Army is Reduced to Dust

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Insignificant and weak, that was in comparison to a true fiend dharma idol.

Facing that true fiend dharma idol akin to beholding a great mountain, that figure was simply insignificant.

But he only used one hand and propped that enormous palm up!

“Ye Yuan!”

“Heaven Surmounting Divine King! It’s the Heaven Surmounting Divine King! Hahaha ... The Heaven Surmounting Divine King finally rushed back!”

Ye Yuan’s appearance made everyone incredibly excited!

Previously, the Spirit Bristle Divine King said that the Heaven Surmounting Divine King entered deep into the god-forbidden region, searching for the opportunity to become a deity.

Now that the Heaven Surmounting Divine King returned, could it be that ... he succeeded?

With that in mind, they felt like their hearts were almost leaping out!

When Fang Tian saw Ye Yuan’s figure, there was actually an additional trace of luster in those dead eyes.

Teng Yun even started trembling with excitement. He grasped Fang Tian’s hands and said agitatedly, “Senior, he ... he came back! Hahaha ... He really came back! I say, could he have ... could he have ...”

Fang Tian was powerless to speak, but he still nodded his head firmly.

Right now, he could confirm that what caused these few days of heaven and earth phenomenon was definitely Ye Yuan!

As long as he came back, he must had broken through to the Deity Realm!

Furthermore, Fang Tian’s concept comprehension was more than a magnitude stronger compared to the others. He could feel that elusive and intangible aura on Ye Yuan’s body.

That sort of feeling was as if what he was facing was ... the Heavenly Dao.

Kanuo’s eyes became wide-circles, looking at this scene in disbelief.

He knew how strong the Brahma True Fiend was. But Ye Yuan actually blocked it with just one hand!

“Brahma True Fiend! Crush for me!”

Kanuo urged the Fiendsource Bead to the limits. The power of the Brahma True Fiend’s palm surged.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and gave a palm with a flip of a hand.

The tiny flesh palm came into contact with the Brahma True Fiend’s palm once more and actually directly shocked the massive palm back.

The Brahma True Fiend’s dharma idol seemed to have been struck by lightning, its entire body started trembling.

Finally, with a loud bang, it directly dissipated into nothing!

When the fiend race powerhouses saw this scene, their eyeballs popped out.

“W-What kind of joke is this?! The Brahma True Fiend ... was actually scattered by a single palm!”

The one who spoke was Fiendgod Jia Lan. When he saw this scene, he even suspected that there was a problem with his eyes.

How strong was the Brahma True Fiend?

Back then, when Absolute Heaven faced off with Lord Kanuo, he also kept a good distance away from this move!

But now, it was actually scattered by Ye Yuan’s one palm!

Yue Ji’s pupils also constricted. Likewise, as a heavenly fiendgod, she was naturally aware of the formidable aspect of Brahma True Fiend, this move.

This martial technique was passed down by His Excellency, Fiend Lord, and its power was boundless.

Even though Kanuo was unable to unleash its true power, it was also absolutely not what an empyrean world’s aboriginal could defeat.

The only possibility was that ... Ye Yuan corroborated his Dao and became a deity!

But how was this possible?

Ye Yuan did not care about everyone’s astonishment; his figure suddenly vanished.

When he reappeared again, it was already beside Fang Tian.

“Senior, Ye Yuan came late and has made you suffer!”

While talking, Ye Yuan extended two fingers. A ball of green light appeared on his fingertips.

It was only to see him lightly tap at Fang Tian’s glabella. The green light flashed and disappeared, injecting itself into Fang Tian’s body.

A colossal life force instantly shone inside Fang Tian’s body, making him a lot more energetic.

“Ye Yuan, this ... this is?”

Fang Tian looked at this scene in disbelief. His bodily functions obtained restoration virtually instantly.

The him that was already close to death actually revived miraculously.

Ye Yuan said, “This is the lease of life that I sought from Senior Kunwu. With this wisp of vitality, it can guarantee you a hundred years of lifespan!”

“A-A hundred years?”

Fang Tian drew a breath of cold air, looking at Ye Yuan like he had seen a ghost.

Previously, Ye Yuan expended a Herculean effort before refining the arcane insight rank Heavenly Fragrance Life Extending Pill, extending his lifespan by 30 years. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Now, just a wisp of vitality could guarantee him a hundred years of longevity.

This was simply something inconceivable!

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “That’s right! Senior Kunwu’s strength is what we’re unable to imagine. If not that you’ve already reached the point where you’re an expiring lamp that ran out of oil, just this wisp of vitality is sufficient to extend your lifespan by as long as 10 thousand years!”

Everyone was taken aback by shock!

Even the most powerful medicinal pill was also unable to extend lifespan by 10 thousand years.

Ye Yuan sought for a total for two wisps of vitality. One was for Fang Tian, but the other was for his mother.

“Ye Yuan, you ... could you have ...”

Teng Yun was not a person who did not know how to convey the meaning of his words. But at this moment, he really did not know how he should word it.

He was very afraid, terrified that Ye Yuan did not break through to the Deity Realm.

But this sort of thing was truly unimaginable.

Under the circumstances where Heavenly Dao was missing today, was there really someone capable of breaking through to the Deity Realm?

Ye Yuan smiled and nodded his head.

When everyone saw the situation, their minds all buzzed, becoming blank, all unable to think anymore.

It was true!

Ye Yuan really broke through to the Deity Realm!”

“Haha ... hahaha, Ye Yuan, c-congratulations to you! Haha ...”

There was a look of wild elation on Teng Yun’s face, and he could not even quite choose his words anymore. He was even happier than himself breaking through to the Deity Realm.

After the astonishment, the others were likewise greatly surprised.

Ye Yuan breaking through to the Deity Realm indicated that they no longer needed to be afraid of Kanuo!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan broke through to the Deity Realm. That meant that they could all break through to the Deity Realm!

Perhaps, Deity Realm would descend upon the Divine Realm anew!

How could this sort of thing not make them wild ecstatic?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Talk about this later. I’ll be right back!”

These words were domineering!

To be able to say this sort of words to Heavenly Fiendgod Kanuo, there was probably only a Deity Realm powerhouse, right?

With a flash, Ye Yuan appeared in the sky once more, overlooking all life.

Even someone as powerful as Kanuo was also merely a slightly stronger ant in his eyes.

All under the Deity Realm were ants. This was not just lip service!

After breaking through to the Deity Realm, Ye Yuan deeply sensed the power of the Deity Realm!

He saw Fang Tian and Kanuo’s confrontation in his consciousness, then broke through to Deity Realm very soon and begged Kunwu for two wisps of vitality, crossing hundreds of millions of miles in an instant, arrived at the dragon clan, and just nice caught up to the Brahma True Fiend’s palm.

“Kanuo, you don’t belong here. You have plagued the Immortal Grove Region for as long as a million years! Today is your judgment day!” Those indifferent words of Ye Yuan’s directly sentenced Kanuo to death.

Kanuo’s expression changed, and he said in a stern voice, “Fiend race army, attack for me! Kill this kid!”

In the fiend race, there was only obedience.

Even if ahead was a blade mountain and sea of fire, those fiend race powerhouses would also proceed without hesitation!

For a moment, a horde of momentous and tidal-like voices sounded out!

The fiend race powerhouses and fiend slave numbered far more than billions.

Including Jia Lan, these fiendgods, each and every one of them brought out their strongest attack, wanting to drown Ye Yuan using human wave tactics.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and said coolly, “Humph! Dull and thickheaded!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan suddenly smacked a palm out. Heaven and earth changed colors!

A berserk giant dragon rose into the air, charging forth and meeting those countless attacks.

Rumble ...

After ten breaths, there was a stretch of scorched earth before one’s eyes.

In a flick of a finger, an army was reduced to dust!
