Chapter 1197: Tan Si’s Death

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After a time interval of several months, the Heaven Stabilizing Divine King made his way up the Heaven’s Secret Tower once more.

Ending on a sour note the last time, Zhuge Qingxuan had always taken it to heart.

But the news that followed in quick succession made him very surprised.

Ye Yuan’s strength was actually really sufficient to enter the ranks of the Ten Great Divine Kings.

Furthermore, he actually fought to a draw with Lu Linfeng!

Even though he felt that there was some suspicions on Lu Linfeng going easy, this news was already enough to shock him.

But he did not think that the Heaven’s Secret Tower really announced that they were going to change the Ten Great Divine Kings.

In his view, that mysterious fellow must have come to a compromise with him.

No matter what, he, this present Divine Realm’s number one person, was no joke.

Of course, this did not count that person inside.

Still behind the black curtain, still so mysterious.

“Heh, didn’t expect that you finally still compromised! You can rest assured, the promise that this seat made before is still valid!” Zhuge Qingxuan said.

The other party was silent.

Zhuge Qingxuan continued, “Whatever terms your Heaven’s Secret Tower have, just put it forward! Kicking Ye Yuan out of the Ten Great Divine Kings this time also made things difficult for you guys. Rest assured, this seat will find an opportunity to kill them. As long as he’s erased, naturally no one will dare to question your alteration.”

Rather than saying Zhuge Qingxuan was arrogant and conceited, it was better to say that he showed disdain on the world and was brimming with confidence.

In his view, only he, Zhuge Qingxuan, was able to make the incomparably mysterious Heaven’s Secret Tower change the Ten Great Divine Kings.

It was still silent behind the black curtain. Only after a long time did he slowly said, “The alteration this time is because of the Heaven Surmounting Divine King. But ... it’s not what you think.”

The meaning of the words was that you were under the delusion that the other party was willing.

Sure enough, Zhuge Qingxuan’s expression changed, and he said in a solemn voice, “What do you mean?”

The other party said coolly, “After a few days, you’ll understand. Heaven’s secrets cannot be divulged!”

Zhuge Qingxuan’s face turned black, ten thousand profanities galloped across his heart.

This guy harped on these one or two sentences over and over again, in a secretive manner.

Most importantly, the other party would not give him face no matter what.

He originally thought that the change this time was because he wanted to kick Ye Yuan out of the Ten Great Divine Kings. He did not expect that it was not the case at all.

Not only was it not, hearing the meaning in the other party’s words, it seemed like there was even a possibility of going further.

This was simply too ridiculous, too repulsive!

One had to know that between the Ten Great Divine Kings’s sixth and fifth place, there was a considerable gap in strength.

Could Ye Yuan still have a possibility of jostling the Darkness Divine King, Sikong Shang, down?

The Heaven’s Secret Tower had always ranked the Ten Great Divine Kings according to strength. Could it be that in this short few months’ time, Ye Yuan’s strength actually had such a great leap?

How was this possible?

“Good, good, good! I’ll go and kill this boy right now. This seat wants to take a look at how you’ll announce the Ten Great Divine Kings this time!”

Zhuge Qingxuan was livid until blue veins throbbed, saying three ‘good’s in a row.

He could not do anything to this mysterious powerhouse. But toward Ye Yuan, he did not have that many misgivings.

Done talking, Zhuge Qingxuan flicked his sleeves and left.

But the mysterious powerhouse did not have the intention of stopping.

After Zhuge Qingxuan left, another figure came out from inside.

If Zhuge Qingxuan was here, he would recognize that this person was none other than precisely the Spirit Bristle Divine King, Teng Yun!

The Spirit Bristle Divine King, this kind of major power, was actually able to show up in the Holy City noiselessly, and appear in the Heaven’s Secret Tower.

This mysterious powerhouse’s means were truly inconceivable!

But at this time, the Spirit Bristle Divine King gave a bow towards that mysterious powerhouse behind the black curtains respectfully and said, “Elder Xuan, is it really fine to let Zhuge Qingxuan go and find Ye Yuan unchecked like so 1 ?”

If the world were to see this scene, they would definitely be shocked until their eyeballs fell out.

The Divine Realm’s number two divine king was actually so respectful towards a mysterious powerhouse. Going out and saying it, probably nobody would believe it either.

“Ye Yuan’s strength is greater than you imagine!” said the mysterious powerhouse coolly.

The Spirit Bristle Divine King was slightly surprised and said, “In that case, Sikong Shang can’t escape his doom this time?”

“Huhu, just you wait and see,” said the mysterious powerhouse who smiled slightly.

Massive waves stirred up in the Spirit Bristle Divine King’s heart. When he and Ye Yuan parted, Ye Yuan could not even take a single move from Zhuge Qingxuan.

Just how long had it been, could it be that Ye Yuan already grew to the extent where it was enough to cut down the Darkness Divine King?

This boy was truly too monstrous, right?

...

“You guys, look! That young man seems to be Ye Yuan!”

“It really is! It’s already been ten years, right? At that time, heard that he died in the Heavenly Slaughter Pit. Didn’t expect that he actually showed up in the Asura Arena again.”

“Back then, Ye Yuan’s name shook the Asura Arena! The 12 Exalts, each and every one was all vying to have him.”

“His strength is too formidable. Back then, when activating Asura Mode, he actually succeeded in the challenge. This had never been done by anyone for tens of thousands of years!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Oh, right, the Heaven’s Secret Tower announced that the sixth divine king is also called Ye Yuan. It wouldn’t be ... him, right?”

“Haha, you really come up with the wildest fantasy! When Ye Yuan came in at that time, he was merely a Heaven Enlightenment Realm martial artist. Now, only ten years have gone by, even if his talent was any greater, it’s also not possible to be so monstrous, right?”

Back then, Ye Yuan swept across the Asura Arena. Especially activating suicide mode, it attracted large groups of martial artists to surround and watch.

Those people still had a very strong impression of Ye Yuan. Hence, the moment Ye Yuan entered the Asura Arena, he was recognized by some meddlesome people.

It was just that, in their view, this Ye Yuan just had a duplicate name with the Heaven Surmounting Divine King, Ye Yuan.

In ten years’ time, a Heaven Enlightenment Realm powerhouse growing to join the Ten Great Divine Kings, this was something totally impossible to happen.

But even so, it did not hinder their feelings of worship and fear towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan had the Absolute Kill Token in his hands. Entering the Asura Arena naturally did not pose any problems.

He found a martial artist whose strength was decent and went up to ask, “Let me ask you, is the Demon King and Tan Si still at the Asura Arena now?”

Back then, Ye Yuan left in a hurry and could be said to have fled in panic, and did not bring them away.

Now that ten years had passed, Ye Yuan naturally had to find these few acquaintances when returning to the Asura Arena.

It was just that upon Ye Yuan’s query, that martial artist’s expression became very ugly.

Ye Yuan’s heart sunk, and he said in a cold voice, “Speak! How are they?”

Ye Yuan’s grand completion Slaughter Concept opened up fully. That martial artist felt like he was already almost going into shock.

“I ... I’ll talk, I’ll talk! The demon king left the Asura Arena not long after you left. As for Tan Si ... he died!”

Ye Yuan’s face fell, and he said, “Who killed him?”

Although Ye Yuan and Tan Si did not have a deep friendship, he served as his guide for a period of time at any rate.

Ye Yuan did not expect that he was actually killed. How could Ye Yuan not be furious?

“It ... It was Exalt Coldblood!” That person said.

“Weren’t exalts unable to make a move against people below?” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

“Y-Your Excellency, back then after you left, Tan Si soared rapidly all the way, rising to the position of an exalt! But on the first day he became an exalt, he was killed by Exalt Coldblood!” said that martial artist.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing murderous intent.

“What a terrific Coldblood! It looks like we have to settle this score properly today!” Ye Yuan said coldly.
