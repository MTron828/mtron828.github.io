“Dead! Dead! This guy is going to be killed by heavenly punishment for reporting information to us! Sigh!” Song Miao secretly sighed in his heart.

Seven-nine Dao tribulation was too terrifying. Furthermore, it was three times the seven-nine Dao tribulation.

Ye Yuan already could not hold on anymore!

Luo Chuan laughed loudly and said, “You absolutely can’t withstand this round of Dao tribulation! Dying under Dao tribulation, you’re getting off cheap, brat! Hahaha ...”

It could be said that he hated Ye Yuan to the bones.

The implications of this reporting were too big!

Now, for Ye Yuan to be able to die under Dao tribulation, he was naturally incomparably invigoration.

While talking, another three bolts of Dao tribulation fell together.

And Ye Yuan could no longer condense the Dao sword!

In everyone’s eyes, Ye Yuan was dead for sure this time.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s origin divinity came straight out of his body.

Then the bow bent, and the arrow was notched.

“Arrow of God Extermination!”

‘The terrifying spiritual energy undulation swept up an extremely powerful fluctuation along with the Arrow of God Extermination.

Three Arrow of God Extermination released, directly clashing together with the three bolts of Dao tribulation.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

‘The terrifying undulation directly blew all the surrounding Saint Sovereign Heavens flying.

‘There were even those who did not have time to run away and were directly obliterated by this impact.

Ye Yuan’s Dao tribulation was too terrifying. They could not get close at all.

Ye Yuan’s origin divinity also immediately dimmed a lot.

Luo Chuan’s expression could not help changing. This kid was actually still not dead!

‘The origin divinity attack just now was so formidable!

“Huhu, your esteemed self has been let down! This young friend’s stubbornness is admirable!” Song Miao said with a laugh.

The current Ye Yuan was seriously injured, but his essence, energy, and spirit were getting stronger and stronger.

This was a divergent cultivator!

Even when facing Heavenly Dao, one would not cow or submit either!

It was just that what Ye Yuan did seemed to be even more thorough and purer than others.

The Dao tribulations came very fast, as if extremely furious at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan shot ten rounds of Arrow of God Extermination in a row. His origin divinity already dimmed to the extreme, as if it might dissipate at any time.

But he did not have the slightest intention of backing down.

His origin divinity turning dim, Ye Yuan withdrew his origin divinity, and his entire person turned into an azure dragon, rushing straight to the sky!

All the way until now, his aura had not shrunk back in the slightest.

Dao sword is gone; I’ll use origin divinity. Origin divinity is weakened; I’ll use my physical body!

Want to make me, Ye Yuan, back down, there’s no chance!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The azure dragon that Ye Yuan transformed into was directly blasted down.

But Ye Yuan got up immediately and flew toward the Dao tribulation again.

He was slammed down over and over again, and he rose into the air again and again.

All of the powerhouses present were visibly moved.

Luo Chuan’s expression became more and more solemn.

He felt Ye Yuan’s unyielding spirit. Even Heavenly Dao was unable to shake it!

This kind of shocking will was something that he rarely saw in his life!

He knew that this heavenly punishment could not eradicate Ye Yuan anymore.

It was also at this time that one powerful aura after another came from all directions again.

These were the other cities’ powerhouses that rushed to the rescue! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He couldn’t stay any longer. If he continued staying, he would not be able to leave.

“This boy will definitely be my blood race’s formidable enemy in the future! Unfortunately, I couldn’t kill him this time!”

Luo Chuan let out a long sigh. Suddenly, a bloody light shone brilliantly on his body, and he smashed a punch onto the void.

Seven True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were immediately sent flying.

“Retreat!”

Under Luo Chuan’s word of command, the Saint Sovereign Heaven army immediately retreated.

And Ye Yuan was still stubbornly resisting the Dao tribulation!

‘When Ye Yuan woke up, he found himself lying on a comfortable bed.

The sunlight seeping in from outside was a little blinding.

His whole body felt like it had fallen apart, being weak to the extreme.

Taking the initiative to call down heavenly punishment this time could be said to be having narrowly escaped death.

Taking the initiative to call down heavenly tribulation was different from Dao tribulation.

‘When he transcended the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation, Ye Yuan already reached the pinnacle in all aspects and could be said to be well-prepared.

But, taking the initiative to bring down heavenly punishment, Ye Yuan had not reached his peak state within this realm.

Coupled with the power of the heavenly punishment itself, it was a miracle in itself that Ye Yuan could survive.

“You’re awake?” A gentle voice sounded out.

Only then did Ye Yuan realize that there was someone in the room.

This was a middle-aged man with the appearance of a scholar, looking very gentle.

Ye Yuan remembered him. He was precisely the first person who rushed over to save me. It was also City Lord Song Miao.

“Senior ...” Ye Yuan struggled to sit up.

Song Miao bowed to Ye Yuan and said, “This Song gives thanks to Little Brother’s grace of reporting the news on behalf of Northern View City’s one million martial artists!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “You mustn’t!”

Song Miao got up and said with a smile, “This bow, Little Brother must accept it! You might not know what this heavenly punishment that you called down means to Heaven One Continent!”

Ye Yuan actually had an idea in his heart. The blood race was hidden in the fog. They must be plotting something big.

But, just how big, Ye Yuan was not clear.

Hearing Song Miao’s meaning, it was likely really very dangerous this time.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Senior is injured?”

Song Miao gave Ye Yuan a glance rather surprisedly and said with a smile, “It’s fine.”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “With blood beads entering the body, it will fuse into Senior’s blood and destroy your bodily functions! Normally, you can suppress it. But, once you fight with people, this blood bead can kill you at any time!”

This time, Song Miao was really shocked.

This guy actually saw through his own physical condition with one glance!

Song Miao smiled bitterly and said, “The blood race’s blood bead is incurable! Compared to the few fellow davists who died, this Song is already very lucky.”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “The news had already been brought out. Could it be that you all still can’t deal with the blood race?”

Song Miao shook his head and said, “This half a month, we fought three fierce battles with the blood race, suffering heavy losses. Among the fellow daoists who saved you together on that day, three fell. The other five are all injured.”

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth twitched slightly, not expecting that it was actually this result.

The blood race was actually so powerful!

He had the strength to crush those in the same rank, but it did not mean that everyone had.

An unkillable opponent really had no solutions.

“The mere five of you were actually able to kill your way out of the blood race army’s encirclement. It’s simply a miracle!” Song Miao sighed with admiration.

Back then, when he saw that Ye Yuan was only Saint Sovereign Heaven, he was really stunned.

With this bit of strength, how did they kill their way out?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, just what’s the situation in Heaven One Continent?”

Song Miao already knew that Ye Yuan the five of them were just from a wild continent and were not clear about Heaven One Continent’s situation.

It was also precisely because of this that Ye Yuan’s actions and conduct were even harder to come across.

“Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven has three main continents, Heaven One Continent, Thundercry Continent, and Lastingwind Continent. These three main continents occupy a vast area, facing each other across the sea. But now, Thundercry Continent and Lastingwind Continent have all already become

the blood race’s territory. The various races’ powerhouses of the two continents have all become slaves of the blood race!”

“Heaven One Continent is Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s sole remaining mellow fruit. The powerhouses of the other two continents have also retreated to defend Heaven One Continent one after another. In fact, close to one-third of the present Heaven One Continent has already fallen into enemy

hands too!”

Ye Yuan could not help being stunned when he heard this.

He knew that Heaven One Continent’s situation was grim, but he also did not think that it was so severe!
