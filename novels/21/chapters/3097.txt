Chapter 3096: God of War Never Dies!

Feng Xiaotian stood proudly in midair, his aura surging to the sky, not dissipating for a long time.

That shocking fighting spirit actually supported his physical body from falling down.

He just stood at the entrance of the Extreme Light Pavilion, glaring at all of the blood race’s powerhouses.

He was akin to a furious vajra, guarding Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s last foundation.

For a moment, there was actually no one who dared to step forward, including Bloodpromise.

The entire battlefield actually fell into a brief respite because of his demise.

Yi Xue had a somber expression, and he said solemnly, “Fighting spirit condensing without dissipating, causing Great Dao resonance. If he didn’t die, he should have broken through to Supreme Hegemon in one stroke, right? This person is admirable!”

Such an opponent made a powerhouse like Yi Xue visibly moved too.

In reality, many blood race powerhouses revealed looks of respect on their faces too.

Although he was dead, his soul was still alive!

Mi Tian, Cloudmount, Zhuo Bufan, and the rest all closed their eyes in pain.

“City Lord Feng, goodbye! We won’t disgrace you!”

“We’ll definitely make the blood dogs pay a terrible price!”

......

“City Lord Feng, your unfinished business, we’ll definitely help you finish it!”

… . .

Many heroes quietly shed tears at this time.

They were sending Feng Xiaotian off with their eyes, sending away the hero in their hearts!

Yi Xue looked at Mi Tian and said, “Your Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven has too many fine lads! Now that the situation has played out like this, are you still insisting on sacrificing their lives? As long as you surrender, I can plead with Progenitor on your behalf to spare them from death!”

Mi Tian laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Yi Xue, are you joking? Feng Xiaotian’s corpse has yet to turn cold. He dyed the blue sky with his hot blood and is currently watching us in heaven! Which one of us do you think dares to take a step back?”

Actually, Yi Xue had long already anticipated the result, but he still said it.

Hearing what Mi Tian said, Yi Xue smiled lightly, then recovered to that unrivaled powerhouse again, and said coolly, “Since that’s the case, then we’ll … be irreconcilable till death! Everyone, obey my order. Slaughter Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven and spare not even fowls and dogs! Bloodpromise, break through the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space, and snatch the Heaven volume!”

Whoosh!

Under his word of command, the brief respite was broken once again.

Battle cries that shook the heavens sounded out again.

Bloodpromise looked at Feng Xiaotian and actually wavered a little and did not advance!

The current Feng Xiaotian, regardless of whether it was fighting spirit or aura, it was all still at his peak state, without dissipating at all!

Especially that pair of furious eyes, it was currently staring right at him as if they were going to devour him.

In terms of momentum, he had already lost!

He swallowed his saliva, seemingly emboldening himself as he said, “Feng Xiaotian, do you think that you can still frighten this seat after you’re dead?”

Finished saying, Bloodpromise raised a fist and smashed toward Feng Xiaotian viciously.

Right at this time, the origin power around Feng Xiaotian actually moved on its own under the situation where no one was controlling!

Boom!

A violent explosion sounded out. Bloodpromise’s entire person was actually blasted flying out.

When everyone saw this scene, they were dumbfounded with shock.

“This … What’s going on?”

“Isn’t Feng Xiaotian dead? How can he possibly launch an attack? Furthermore, it’s even so strong?”

“G-Got to be kidding! Never seen before a dead man who can still launch attacks!”

… . .

Everyone was shocked!

A dead person actually sent the Peak Hegemon Bloodpromise flying!

This sort of thing was simply unheard of.

Furthermore, they clearly detected that Feng Xiaotian really did not have any aura and also did not activate divine essence.

Everything was all heaven and earth spiritual energy moving on its own!

.

Bloodpromise shot to his feet and cried out angrily, “Feng Xiaotian, are you trying to tell me that even if you’re dead, I’m not your match either? Can I, Bloodpromise, still lose to a dead person today? Attack together for me! I want to see how long this guy can last!”

Under Bloodpromise’s word of command, those Hegemon Realm powerhouses stepped forward one after another, each displaying their divine abilities.

But a forcefield seemingly formed around Feng Xiaotian. All attacks that arrived in his surroundings, the power of origin would be automatically generated, and then it would counterattack.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Those blood race Hegemon Realm powerhouses were all sent flying one after another.

A blood race Hegemon was not careful and was actually directly wiped out!

With this, everyone was even more shocked.

The dead Feng Xiaotian was actually even stronger than when he was alive!

The blood race army was actually unable to break through from in front of him.

Bloodpromise’s face was ugly to the extreme.

He had already rushed over many times. But each time, he would be sent flying by a powerful attack.

“City Lord Feng died in battle and continues to protect Extreme Light Pavilion too! His life force has already faded away, but his will to fight is still condensed here, not letting anyone take a step in!”

“City Lord Feng is a god of war!”

“God of War,?hurrah!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

… . .

Many Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven powerhouses had their eyes brimmed over with hot tears. Their eyes when looking at Feng Xiaotian were full of admiration.

Although Feng Xiaotian was dead, he lived on forever in people’s hearts.

Regardless of whether it was his comrades or his enemies!

Yi Xue said coolly, “A glorious death! Fighting spirit condensing without dissipating, drawing down heaven and earth Great Dao, forming a barrier of its own! If he didn’t die, his future accomplishments might not have been lower than yours and mine! This battle is exciting! This battle is tragic! However, it’s also precisely because of this that your blood is even more precious! I didn’t expect that three Blood Ward Beads were filled up in just Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

Three Blood Ward Beads were currently devouring blood energy crazily above everyone’s heads.

Yi Xue also did not expect that in a low-level plane like Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, it could actually fill up three Blood Ward Beads.

This way, the one Blood Ward Bead that was used up to kill Ye Yuan was no big deal anymore.

One had to know that the blood energy that the Blood Ward Bead collected was all extremely pure energy of blood.

One Hegemon Realm might not be able to raise one-thousandth of the amount too.

But in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, everyone’s will to fight was extremely fierce. This made the energy contained in their blood essence become even stronger.

It was also precisely because of this that the collection of the Blood Ward Bead became particularly easy.

Mi Tian’s expression was very ugly. No need to guess and he also knew that this great battle that swept across all the heavens, which was started by the blood race, it was precisely to collect the Blood Ward Beads.

This was not a good thing!

“Alright, Feng Xiaotian is already dead. Ye Yuan should also already be dead now. Mi Tian, no matter to what extent this battle is fought until, you are the loser! Let us end this battle!”

Yi Xue waved his hand. The blood race army mobilized again!

The great battle started again!

Bloodpromise and a group of Hegemons attacked Feng Xiaotian crazily.

.

No matter how strong the god of war’s will, it was ultimately a masterless thing.

The origins around him got lesser and lesser.

The battle spirit was also about to shatter.

When Bloodpromise saw this scene, he could not help being wildly ecstatic and said,?“Hahaha,?Feng Xiaotian, even if they all revere you as a god of war, so what? You are ultimately a dead man!”

Under the frenzied attacks, Feng Xiaotian’s physical body started swaying, looking like it was about to fall.

Bloodpromise and the others seemed to be injected with stimulants and were about to rush into the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space.

And right at this time, there was suddenly a loud noise that could be distinctly heard across the entire battlefield.

That impregnable Bloodcloud Grand Array actually had an opening blasted open by someone from inside.

A figure flew out swiftly at that time.

Who was it if not Ye Yuan?

Virtually at the same time, Yi Xue, Bloodpromise, Mi Tian, Cloudmount, Zhuo Bufan, all of them were shocked!
