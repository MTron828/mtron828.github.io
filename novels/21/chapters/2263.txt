Chapter 2267: Taken Down!

Seeing Ning Tianping, Ye Yuan’s anger that had just subsided surged up with a whoosh again.

The current Ning Tianping was nailed onto a cross by four nails.

The four nails emitted powerful undulations, they were clearly not ordinary objects.

Ning Tianping was covered in blackish-red bloodstains from top to bottom, without an intact spot.

Feeling the murderous aura coming off of Ye Yuan’s body, Kong Ming went on alert.

He had witnessed before Ye Yuan’s strength, once this boy went berserk, he would really be not easy to handle.

However, Ye Yuan did not explode. Instead, he walked in front of Ning Tianping step by step, and pulled off the nails on his four limbs. Ye Yuan carried him on his back and slowly walked out.

Seeing this scene, Kong Ming’s heart eased up slightly.

Luckily, this brat knew to be scared.

Leaving the dungeon, Kong Ming said, “Now that the person is already handed to you, you can go and remove the poison in Divine Daughter’s body already, right?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and suddenly grinned.

Kong Ming was startled inwardly, immediately having a foreboding premonition.

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

... ...

Inside the dungeon, a series of tragic cries suddenly came over.

Kong Ming’s expression changed wildly, and he yelled angrily, “When did you ... damn it!”

He rushed in to take a look, miserable screams lingered in the ears inside the dungeon, countless flying swords were wandering around inside the dungeon.

The flying swords seemed to have eyes, killing people on sight, there was no way to avoid them at all.

In just this short while, the guards and prisoners inside the dungeon were already pretty much dead.

A thousand over flying swords, how many were there to be enough for Ye Yuan to kill?

Below Heavenly Emperor, no one could block Ye Yuan’s one sword at all!

In a blink, Ye Yuan killed off the divine race members inside the dungeon, sparing none!

When he just came out, Ye Yuan quietly hid the flying swords inside the void with a spatial mystic art.

With Kong Ming’s spatial law attainments, he was unable to detect it at all.

After they came out of the dungeon, Ye Yuan suddenly activated his sword formation and killed off all the people in the dungeon in a blink of an eye.

Finished massacring, the flying swords flew out of the dungeon obediently.

Kong Ming gave an angry roar and bellowed, “Impudent thing!Do you really take it that this old man doesn’t dare to kill you?”

The divine race’s members, each one was extremely precious.

The Hidden Lineage had searched in the Heavenspan World for no idea how many years, and they were very meticulous and careful, akin to treading on thin ice. That was how they acquired such a number of powerhouses.

What a terrific fellow! Ye Yuan killed several hundred clan members in one go, so how could Kong Ming not be furious? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Sorry about that. With the likes of you, you really don’t have this ability! Just take this today as a bit of interest. My scores with your divine race still have yet to be settled!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan took a step and directly shuttled into the void.

Kong Ming’s gaze turned intent, his expression becoming incomparably ugly as he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “What profound spatial law! This boy’s means are really a lot!”

Done talking, his figure moved, chasing after.

Ye Yuan arrived in the clan, but he just happened to see Ru Feng bringing Rong Xiyue out.

As for the rest, they had already left respectively.

Ye Yuan had a cold look, carrying Ning Tianping and walking by them, heading straight in the direction of the medicinal hut.

Ru Feng could not help choking, this boy directly treated them as air!

Suddenly, Ru Feng was startled and said, “Where’s Kong Ming?”

His voice had yet to fade when Kong Ming rushed over, his expression ugly as he said, “Third Elder, this brat he ... he ...”

Ru Feng’s face fell and he said, “What did he do?”

“He secretly hid flying swords in the void. After we exited the dungeon, he released the flying swords and killed all of the clan members in the dungeon!” Kong Ming said with uncontrollable rage.

“WHAT?!” Everyone cried out in shock.

Immediately, Ru Feng’s fury billowed to the sky. A powerful to the extreme pressure enveloped Ye Yuan firmly.

“Boy, could it be that you really take it that this elder doesn’t dare to kill you?” His figure moved, blocking Ye Yuan’s path as he said angrily.

Ye Yuan gave him a nonchalant glance. A strange curve suddenly curled at the corner of his mouth.

Not knowing why, Ru Feng’s heart suddenly thumped, immediately having a foreboding premonition.

While right at this time, a young man dressed in the appearance of a medicine boy ran over and exclaimed in alarm, “Third Elder, things are bad! Master he ... he’s poisoned!”

As that medicine boy said, a cloud of black gas suddenly emerged from his body, then he fell to the ground, convulsing endlessly.

Before long, he kicked the bucket.

Seeing this scene, Ru Feng only felt a chill run down his back.

The medicine boy’s master was none other than precisely Lin Yi!

Lin Yi was poisoned!

Before he could react, another medicine boy ran over, and he said roughly the same words as the one before.

In a blink, he also fell to the ground and croaked.

Ru Feng’s head suddenly exploded and he roared angrily at Ye Yuan, “What the hell did you do?!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Those who take the Adversity Lifechasing Pill, every inch of their skin and flesh will be poisoned from head to toe. And she will become a source of poison. For those who have had physical contact with her before, the poison will spread to that person through the skin. And once it spreads, the toxicity will become a hundred times stronger than the poison source! Furthermore, the toxicity will spread through heaven and earth spiritual energy! You rest assured, with the physique of the divine race, middle-stage Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm and above will be fine. But for those below, huhu.”

This ‘huhu’ was akin to a sledgehammer, smashing onto Ru Feng’s chest.

He suddenly came to a realization. Ye Yuan was deliberately provoking him previously, making him find people to cure Rong Xiyue’s poison.

It was for this very moment right now!

The toxicity could spread through heaven and earth spiritual energy, furthermore, it was colorless and tasteless, even a powerhouse like Lin Yi did not notice it.

This poison was simply too terrifying!

“You ... This elder will kill you!” Ru Feng roared angrily and was about to make a move and kill.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “Each additional second you delay here, the Hidden Lineage will have many more people die. Moreover, if you have confidence in curing the poison, you can very well take action.”

Rumble!

Ru Feng’s palm smacked down, smashing a large pit beside Ye Yuan, dirt and soil flying everywhere.

Ye Yuan’s eyelids did not even bat, he just looked at Ru Feng indifferently.

Ru Feng gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Consider yourself ruthless!”

Done talking, his figure moved, vanishing from where he was.

Ye Yuan was expressionless, continuing forward, walking in the direction of the medicinal hut.

To Ye Yuan, he could find the whereabouts of the medicinal hut even if he closed his eyes.

Rong Xiyue’s complexion was ashen pale. Only then did she know how terrifying of a figure Ye Yuan was.

Her brain must have short-circuited, to provoke an existence like this!

At the behest of supernatural powers, she followed Ye Yuan to the medicinal hut.

Ye Yuan entered the medicinal hut, placed Ning Tianping on the table, and started looking for spirit medicines inside the medicinal hut with familiarity, like in his own home.

Ning Tianping’s injuries were severe, very severe!

Those four nails were four Empyrean spirit treasure level treasures, continuously wrecking and torturing Ning Tianping.

But it would not let him die.

Ning Tianping hung in there with one breath all the way until now.

Luckily it was Ye Yuan. If it were others, even if they rescued Ning Tianping, he would be a dead man too.

However, with Ye Yuan’s means, bringing him back to life also needed to expend considerable effort.

Fortunately, spirit medicines were the least lacking in the medicinal hut. Ye Yuan started nursing Ning Tianping’s injuries with utmost care.
