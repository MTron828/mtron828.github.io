Chapter 2879 Kill Them All!

Lastingwind and Thundercry two continents both had 99 Blood Emperor level cities.

Ten people each city, there would be 2000 hundred sons candidates.

But there were only 99 positions in the blood

pool!

These 2000 people sharing 99 positions were naturally not enough. Therefore, they could only snatch!

These 99 positions naturally all had people occupying them.

The lower the number, the higher the concentration of the blood medicine.

Hundred sons candidates, each person had ten days of cultivation opportunity.

But actually, the vast majority could not get ten days!

Wanting to cultivate in the blood pool, they would have to challenge one of them.

The victor only had one day of cultivation time.

The loser, bye bye!

Losers were not allowed to challenge a second

time.

One day later, that number would accept other people’s challenges again.

Ye Yuan handed his wooden card to the manager, and it just happened to be seen by a hundred sons candidate beside him, immediately attracting a series of ridicules.

“Tch, Giant Net City, a bunch of cannon fodders also dare to come to the blood pool to cultivate! Hey, kid, don’t you know that a trash from Heaven One Continent isn’t allowed to enter the blood pool?”

The one who spoke was a youth whose mouth stuck out and had a chin like an ape’s. The moment these words came out, a group of amused looks immediately cast over from all around.

Ye Yuan was taken aback when he heard that. It seemed like there was really only him entering the blood pool!

What is going on?

Is Heaven One Continent such a failure?

This matter was Ye Yuan who was ignorant and ill-informed.

The other cities’ people all knew about this.

But Ye Yuan had zero communication with those people on the whole journey. There was naturally no one who told him about this. It was not that Ye Yuan pretended to be proud and cold but that the matter of him slaughtering off a passageway had already spread out. Those people all feared him like a tiger.

In reality, the hundred sons candidates from Heaven One Continent would never step into the blood pool.

This was because that was only asking for trouble.

In the course of time, no one went anymore.

Heaven One Continent rarely had someone who could enter the ranks of the hundred sons!

Even if one occasionally entered, they would also be ranked at the bottom.

At first, they naturally wanted to enter the blood pool to cultivate too.

However, they were beaten each time until they had to search the ground for their teeth or even straight up ended up dead. There was naturally no one who dared to come anymore.

Therefore, the blood pool had an unwritten rule, those from Heaven One Continent were not allowed to enter!

Of course, this was the agreement among the hundred sons.

The officials naturally still acknowledged their identities. It was just that they looked down on Heaven One Continent.

Why was there such a situation? Actually, Heaven One Continent’s bloodkins were basically all immigrants. The earliest immigrants were all the weakest batch in the blood race.

These people were merely cannon fodders, specifically used to deliver to death.

The blood race used these people to whittle away the cities under the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Either way, if these people died, there would be no heartache either.

But without a doubt, Heaven One Continent’s bloodkins were the weakest in the blood race!

Of course, Heaven One Continent had true elites too.

The 100 thousand strong army that was destroyed by South Qi Giant City as well as that army that sneak attacked Northern View City back then were elites!

However, these two armies had completely succumbed at Ye Yuan’s hands

SUC

It was also precisely because of this that the blood race’s Wang Zuo would be so furious, insisting on killing Ye Yuan.

Although Ye Yuan did not know what was going on, he understood very quickly.

Owlfly deliberately did not say anything. It was in order to let him come and make trouble!

That guy knew that he was strong, so Owlfly specifically let him come and slap faces!

Heh, this guy is really wicked. Isn’t he afraid of him succumbing here?

However, slap faces it is then. After I push you up to the sky and then tell you that I’m a human, would you vomit blood on the spot or not?

“I really didn’t know this. Brother, can you teach me or not?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

The youth whose mouth stuck out and had a chin like an ape’s said with a sneer, “Brother? Are you worthy too? Hurry up and get out! Otherwise, you’re going to get it!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a smile, “I’m a hundred sons candidate. With an identity token, I naturally have the right to challenge the people in the blood pool. You don’t have the right to make me go out.” The youth whose mouth stuck out and had a chin like an ape’s said with a snicker, “Whoa! Hundred Sons candidate, what a scary title! Hahaha! He said that he’s a candidate for the hundred sons. Are you all afraid or not?”

There were immediately people who started kicking up a row all around.

“Scared! Scared to death! We, these people, are all not hundred sons candidates!”

“Is Heaven One Continent that place full of powerhouses? Are they all very formidable?”

“I wonder if those powerhouses in the blood pool are a match for the Heaven One Continent expert or not!”

……

These people completely looked down on Heaven One Continent, their words being very nasty.

The youth whose mouth stuck out and had a chin like an ape’s said disdainfully, “Boy, you might not know, those able to enter the blood pool to cultivate, all have hope of becoming Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons in the end! And you all who came from Heaven One Continent are all cannon fodders! Do you understand what’s called cannon fodder? Kid, don’t blame me for not warning you. Hurry up and get lost. Once you choose to challenge the powerhouses in the blood pool, you’ll die very horribly!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Is that so? I’m so scared! This lord, I wonder if when it’s my turn to challenge, can I make everyone in the blood pool get lost?”

By the side, that half-step Emperor Realm manager could not help being stupefied.

All get lost?

What was the meaning of this?

“Uh, I mean, challenging all of them! If I kill them all, I should be able to enjoy the blood pool all by myself, right?” Ye Yuan saw that the manager was confused and asked. The manager was stupefied again, his mind somewhat unable to wrap itself around that.

Kill them all?

This fool, where did this guy appear from?

“H-Huhu, little fellow, do you know who are cultivating in the blood pool?” The manager could not help laughing as he said.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said coolly, “Who they are have nothing to do with me. Because they will become dead people very soon.” When the youth whose mouth stuck out and had a chin like an ape’s heard that, he laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha … Awesome! Heaven One Continent really produced a formidable character! Then you remember well. I’m called Blueblood! When you challenge, remember to call me along!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “If you want to court death, I naturally won’t stop you.”

The slot for challenging only had 99 people every day.

Ye Yuan just handed his identity token over. He naturally had to wait in line.

His time to challenge was two days later. Ye Yuan’s words instantly caused an uproar in the entire blood pool.

They had seen before morons, but they had never met anyone so moronic!

What is this place?

Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City!

Even if you are a dragon, you have to coil up too!

Do you know how many powerhouses were here?

You boasted so shamelessly and actually wanted to kill everyone in the blood pool!

Are you crazy? “Why did an idiot come from Heaven One Continent?”

“Apart from producing fools, what else can that godforsaken place produce?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Huhu, the ten seeds this year, there are seven who are cultivating in the blood pool! This kid has gone nuts to actually want to kill them all! Tsk tsk, really looking forward to it!” “Two days! Two days later, we’ll naturally know!”

……

Everyone used sympathetic gazes to look at Ye Yuan.

They already determined that Ye Yuan was a fool.

If he was not a fool, how could he say such stupid words?

The manager looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “No need to kill everyone. You just have to defeat everyone, and this blood pool will naturally be yours alone!”

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “What’s the point in defeating? It’s naturally directly killing!”
