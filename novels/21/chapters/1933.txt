Chapter 1937: Empyrean Flutterfeather

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This Ye Yuan is merely roughly a thousand years old. Even if he started cultivating in his mother’s womb, it’s also impossible to suppress three great Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders, right?”

“Really blinded my dog eyes! My many years of living was really in vain!”

“No wonder Lord Flutterfeather personally descended. His elderly self has probably long seen through Ye Yuan’s strength!”

...

From the initial-most mockery to the current astonishment, the audience’s understanding of Ye Yuan reached a new height. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The most important thing was that Ye Yuan was too young!

Being an alchemist was an occupation that accumulated day in and day out. No matter how a person was talented, it was also impossible to reach this goal in one step.

But Ye Yuan subverted their understanding.

The three great elders looked at Ye Yuan, being shocked speechless.

They did not expect that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually frighteningly formidable.

This kind of strength, he had probably already walked a long way in Dao Realm.

As for how far, they were unable to estimate it at all.

When facing Ye Yuan, it made the three of them have a feeling like trying to shake a big tree.

This kind of feeling, they only had it before when facing Empyrean Flutterfeather.

“Three seniors, thanks for giving way!” Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said.

These three people’s strengths were indeed very strong. It could even be said that they were the strongest opponents that Ye Yuan had encountered to this date.

In alchemy, Ye Yuan was close to invincible. He had always made a clean sweep of his opponents.

But these three people joining hands indeed caused some impact on him.

At least, he could not do what he did to Yu Ying, directly vanquishing them.

Under his powerful pressure, the three of them still persisted until the end.

Chen Chang looked at Ye Yuan and let out a sigh as he said, “Give what way? Ye Yuan, time makes it inevitable that in every profession, the new generation surpasses the last one. Your strength is already beyond imagination. Work hard! This is the alchemy celestial token, from today onward, you’re Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s elder; on equal footing with us. This is somewhat wronging you, but this identity can bring you tremendous convenience.”

As he said, Chen Chang handed over a token that looked like it was studded with stars, being incomparably profound.

“Thank you, Brother Chen!” Ye Yuan received the token and cupped his fists as he said.

The other two people both fell silent, clearly not quite able to accept this result.

...

The news of Ye Yuan overpowering three great Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders spread far and wide in the Lustrous Gold alchemy world.

Everyone knew that the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion produced a very young elder.

The entire Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital was practically talking about this matter.

Roughly a thousand years old Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elder, this was absolutely an explosive topic of conversation, enough for these people to comment for several years, even several decades.

However, what made them discuss even more was Ye Yuan’s battle with Empyrean Flutterfeather.

The number of years that Empyrean Flutterfeather had been famous already could not be investigated.

But his might was absolutely beyond all doubt.

Seven-star Alchemy God, this was an insurmountable peak in the first place.

Let alone that Empyrean Flutterfeather was even an extremely formidable existence among Seven-star Alchemy Gods.

Even if Ye Yuan defeated three great alchemy celestial level powerhouses, this action was still overestimating his own ability in their eyes.

But sadly, this battle would not be publicized. Those able to watch the battle were only the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s elders.

Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital was built by the mountains. On the Clouddream Mountain, aloud and mist coiled up all year round, being extremely elegant.

It was just that no one dared to go up the Clouddream Mountain at all.

Because they knew that Clouddream Mountain was Empyrean Flutterfeather’s Dao field.

Since ancient times, only Empyrean level powerhouses could go up Clouddream Mountain. And their objectives were mostly in order to request for pills.

Thanks to Ye Yuan, the dozen over Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders scaled up Clouddream Mountain today.

Inside the archaic and magnificent hall, it appeared extremely empty.

A faint medicinal fragrance lingered in the air, making people feel refreshed and relaxed.

Two little medicine boys were currently fanning the medicinal cauldron’s fire. Seeing Ye Yuan come in, their eyes revealed a hint of disdain.

The little medicine boy in purple clothing looked at Ye Yuan and said with an unhappy look, “It’s you who wanted to challenge Master? Not much older than us either, truly overestimating your own ability.”

The little medicine boy in green said with an unfriendly expression, “Hmph hmph! Won against the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s elders and you got carried away! They are nothing in front of Master!”

The Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders by the side had awkward faces, not quite able to maintain their dignity anymore.

But it could not be helped that they could not maintain their dignity. These two little medicine boys were Empyrean Flutterfeather’s direct lineage disciples. Their statuses were even higher than theirs, they did not dare be insolent.

But they also knew that the strength of these two little medicine boys in front of them was extraordinary.

If one looked down on them because of their age, then they would definitely suffer a huge loss.

Suddenly, they thought of this freak beside them again, and they were actually rendered speechless.

Those two little medicine boys were strong because they had a Seven-star Alchemy God master, but what about Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan came from a little county and relied on his own efforts to walk step by step until this day. That was truly monstrous.

“Zi Yu, Qing Yun, don’t be rude!”

Just as everyone was awkward, a figure appeared.

Ye Yuan looked at the arrival and actually could not quite see through clearly.

Ye Yuan clearly knew that the person in front of him was Empyrean Flutterfeather, but he was unable to see clearly, as if a layer of fog covered his face.

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s entire person was like an incarnation of Dao, so fleeting and ephemeral.

This was not Ye Yuan’s first time seeing an Empyrean powerhouse. He had even killed before Empyrean powerhouses. But that was inside the Immortal Grove World, the Immortal Grove Heavenly Dao suppressed those people immensely strongly.

But in the Heavenspan World, it was still Ye Yuan’s first time coming into contact with an Empyrean powerhouse. It was truly illusory and ephemeral to the extreme.

When Zi Yu and Qing Yun, the two medicine boys saw Flutterfeather, the haughty expression on their faces immediately reined in.

It was just that in their eyes, it was still full of disdain toward Ye Yuan.

“We pay respects to Lord Flutterfeather!” When the group of alchemy celestial elders saw the arrival, they immediately bowed in salute.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Thank you, Lord Flutterfeather, for acquiescing to my wish!”

Flutterfeather sized Ye Yuan up and said, “You’re at grand completion Dao Realm?”

Ye Yuan and the group of Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders were greatly astonished when they heard that.

Ye Yuan did not expect that Empyrean Flutterfeather actually saw through him with one glance.

Dao Realm was different from Martial Dao Realm, unable to see through at a glance.

Furthermore, Dao Realm was extremely illusory and insubstantial, ordinary people could not estimate it at all.

But Flutterfeather actually saw through at a glance.

The Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders all turned pale with terror. They knew that Ye Yuan was definitely a Dao Realm powerhouse, but they did not think that Ye Yuan was actually a grand completion Dao Realm powerhouse.

Dao Realm was different from Martial Dao Realm. Initial-stage Dao Realm and grand completion Dao Realm, even if ordinary alchemists worked hard for all their life, they could not attain it too.

To the vast majority of alchemists, the grand completion Dao Realm was the opposite shore!

But Ye Yuan actually reached the grand completion Dao Realm at a young age. It was truly unthinkable, and not up to them to not be shocked.

Sizing Ye Yuan up once more, Ye Yuan’s figure became extremely stalwart in their eyes.

“Could it be that Senior Flutterfeather has already reached Ancestor Realm? If that’s really the case, this junior was impetuous!”

Very soon, Ye Yuan regained his nerves and answered with a question.

Flutterfeather smiled and said, “How can Ancestor Realm be so easy to attain? However, this empyrean shouldn’t be far away! As for seeing through your realm, when you reach this empyrean’s boundary, it will naturally be clear at a glance.”
