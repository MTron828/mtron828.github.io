Chapter 2202: Divine-grade? What Is That?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Uncle Yan, isn’t this ... too rash?” Chen Lie also could not resist speaking up.

As for the people in the village, each and every one of them revealed reluctant looks too. Their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan were full of suspicion.

After all, what right did a brat, who did not even have essence energy, have to test a divine rank spirit medicine?

One had to know, to get divine rank spirit medicines on Jingning Mountain, one could come by with luck but not by searching for it.

Letting a person who lost his memories and did not have essence energy fiddle with it, wasn’t it messing around?

Casually playing around and the 10% chance would even be lost.

Even Ye Yuan himself also said hesitantly, “Grandpa Yan, I’m afraid that ... this isn’t appropriate, right?”

But Chen Yan waved his hand and said, “You go ahead and try. If it’s really gone, this old man, I, will shoulder it. Chen Lie, you have no objections, right?”

Rubbish! Of course I have objections!

But Uncle Yan’s status in the village was exceedingly high, not only was he his elder, he even saved many people in the village.

Without him, the Chen Village would have long failed to maintain itself.

For him, Chen Lie, to have everything today, Uncle Yan also contributed great efforts.

Chen Lie opened his mouth and said with a bitter smile, “Since Uncle Lie has decided, I naturally have no objections.”

... ...

Chen Yan said that it was a pill refining room, but actually, it was just a thatched house.

What a stalk of quasi-divine rank spirit medicines influenced was the hearts of the people in the entire village. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If 10% hope placed on Chen Lie won the bet, that would be the village’s future.

But right now, letting a guy who did not even have essence energy play with it, how could they not worry?

Upon entering the refining room, a familiar feeling hit him face-on.

Ye Yuan’s entire spirit seemed to have become much better all of a sudden.

Chen Yan had been observing Ye Yuan all along. Seeing this scene, he himself also felt inspired.

He had the greatest seniority in this village and knew the most.

For Ye Yuan to be able to be injured until like that and still not die, he was absolutely not a mortal realm martial artist like them.

Ye Yuan being able to recover, his medicine actually did not have much effect.

More of it was Ye Yuan’s own recovery ability!

Just now, Ye Yuan blurted out very naturally, like it was instinctive.

So he guessed that perhaps Ye Yuan was a powerful Alchemy God in the past!

Since Ye Yuan instinctively said that he could do it, then he might really have some way.

Chen Yan knew that the methods of Alchemy God powerhouses were inconceivable. It was completely not what a mortal realm alchemist like him could imagine.

Everyone was standing outside the door. Ye Yuan went into the refining room alone, walked around, and stopped, gently stroking some spirit medicines as well as some utensils.

Touching these things, Ye Yuan had an extremely familiar feeling.

That sort of familiarity was just like his body’s instinct.

Ye Yuan felt that his blood was burning little by little.

“What a familiar feeling!” Ye Yuan muttered.

Everyone’s gazes followed Ye Yuan’s movements, not knowing what he wanted to do.

It was just that he walked around and did not have the intention of taking action.

Chen Yong snorted coldly and said unhappily, “He’s just walking around like that. The sky is already dark. I also don’t know what he wants to do! What can he do like this?”

“Yeah! Why do I feel like this kid isn’t reliable at all, like he’s pretending to be mysterious!”

“Uncle Yan, don’t be fooled by this boy. That’s a quasi-divine rank spirit medicine!”

... ...

Quite a number of villagers were very unhappy, grumbling toward Chen Yan.

Chen Yan’s brows furrowed, and he said with a low roar, “All shut up for this old man! Anybody else that dares to speak, get out for me!”

When everyone saw Chen Yan fly off the handle, each and every one of them was silent like cicadas in winter.

Chen Lie originally wanted to chime in a few words too, but seeing Chen Yan flared up, he could only shut his mouth sensibly.

Ye Yuan’s idling took more than an hour.

Suddenly, his footsteps stopped and he took out a piece of low-grade divine essence stone from an exquisite box.

Everyone’s faces changed!

This kid really knew what to take!

In a place like the Chen Village, a piece of low-grade divine essence stone was extremely precious.

All of Chen Yan’s hidden goods were also merely just three pieces.

This was still him having saved for many years and expended no idea how many materials before exchanging for it.

This kid was not courteous!

Ye Yuan picked up the divine essence stone and pushed away the things on the table, revealing a large empty area.

Then, his pen moved like flying, using the divine essence stone and started drawing on the table.

Everyone had stunned faces, only Chen Yan’s eyes became brighter and brighter.

Ye Yuan was depicting an array formation!

He could not understand this array formation at all; incomparably profound!

This is absolutely not the standard that a One-star Alchemy God can have! Chen Yan screamed in his heart.

In merely a few breaths, Ye Yuan casually drew a design.

Then, he walked over to the medicine rack there swiftly and casually grabbed a few spirit medicines. He threw them into the array formation together with the Jadeheart Grass.

“This guy’s eyes are actually shut!”

“He ... He’s also too casual, right?”

“Is there refining medicine like this? This is wasting spirit medicines, right?! You see, there’s indeed no reaction.”

... ...

The villages all revealed indignant looks because they discovered that Ye Yuan actually had his eyes shut throughout the whole process.

Although they could not understand the array formation, Ye Yuan’s attitude was also too casual.

And the array formation that Ye Yuan drew indeed did not have any activities.

“What the hell do you all understand?! A’Ning has already turned all of his abilities into instinct. He doesn’t need to look at all, and he doesn’t need to measure! All shut up for me and watch closely!” Chen Yan suddenly shouted coldly.

Everyone did not dare to say again.

One breath.

Two breaths.

Three breaths!

Murmur!

The array formation suddenly lit up, a thick surge of spiritual energy poured into the refining room crazily.

This array formation also had the effect of gathering spirit!

Even Ye Yuan himself was also dumbfounded by this miraculous scene.

He looked at his hands, a look of incredulity.

This was done by him?

After several breaths, the light faded. Four medicinal pills lay on the table quietly.

Everyone’s eyes became wide saucers, mouths opening widely, their faces full of shock.

Especially Chen Yong, he was previously making quite a bit of disparaging remarks.

At this time, Ye Yuan actually refined the medicinal pills.

With a method that he had never heard of before!

Used divine essence stone and casually drew a bit, and one could refine medicinal pills?

This kind of method, he had never thought of before even in his dreams!

Chen Yan’s eyes shone with brilliant light, that look in his eyes wished to swallow Ye Yuan whole.

He trembled as he walked in front of the table. Carefully holding up a medicinal pill, he said agitatedly, “That’s right! That’s right! It’s the Jadeheart Pill! Exactly the same as in the records! That spirit gathering array formation just now forcefully raised the quasi-divine rank spirit medicine to a divine rank spirit medicine and refined the Jadeheart Pill! No, wait, this ... this isn’t an ordinary Jadeheart Pill! C-Could this be a divine-grade Jadeheart Pill?”

“What? Divine-grade Jadeheart Pill? This ... How is this possible?”

“My God, divine-grade Jadeheart Pill, I didn’t hear wrongly, right?”

“Could it be that A’Ning is really a legendary Alchemy God?”

... ...

Nobody in the entire village had seen before an Alchemy God, let alone talk about a divine rank divine pill.

Even Chen Yan only noticed something off too and speculated.

Ye Yuan had a blank look as he said, “Divine-grade Jadeheart Pill? What’s that?”

Chen Yan could not help choking when he heard that and almost dropped the medicinal pill onto the ground.

The villages also almost collectively fell to the ground. This guy did not even know what was a divine-grade divine pill, and yet he refined four divine-grade divine pills in one go?
