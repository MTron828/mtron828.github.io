Chapter 2764: Be Right Back!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing Ye Yuan’s surprise, Luo Yunqing even thought that his achievements were surprising and could not help feeling more proud of himself in his heart.

Indeed, in a short hundred years’ time, not only did he cultivate to half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven himself, he even supported such a colossal team. He had the qualifications to be proud.

“Brother Luo, is your strength … the strongest in the Blood Alliance?” Ye Yuan asked.

“Of course!”

Luo Yunqing nodded and said, “Our Blood Alliance has close to a thousand people. There are a total of three great alliance chiefs, including me and two deputies, all half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven! The other two are the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s and Shangyu Heavenly Sect’s powerhouses! Come, return to the Blood Alliance with me first. Let’s plan out the future in detail!”

Luo Yunqing pulled Ye Yuan and gave no chance to explain before tearing across the air.

Ye Yuan was helpless and could only head over half-reluctantly.

Ye Yuan was a little disappointed. They did not even have a Saint Sovereign Heaven. They could not stir any waves at all!

To the Pill Alliance, they were simply small fries, right?

Most likely, it was not even as intimidating as him throwing out a word.

Along the trip, the two naturally could not dispense with a bout of small talk.

Ye Yuan did not hide it either, briefly explaining the situation of him arriving at the Land of Heavenly South in an accident arising from many causes.

Luo Yunqing learned that Ye Yuan cultivated bitterly in the Land of Heavenly South before he had today’s accomplishments and did not think too much either.

However, over a short hundred years, it was already very difficult for Ye Yuan to be able to cultivate to upper Jade Sovereign Heaven.

Along the way, Luo Yunqing did not dare to put on a grand display and walked very carefully.

Half a month later, the two people arrived at a mountain range at the edge of Daycreek Heavenly Region.

In the mountains, the waterfall was surging akin to the Milky Way hanging upside down!

Luo Yunqing brought Ye Yuan and actually passed right through the large waterfall and arrived in a spatial mystic realm.

The scenery before their eyes changed; it was an altogether different world.

In the mystic realm, there was a bustling scene.

The vast majority of the people were cultivating. A minority was busying over miscellaneous affairs.

Luo Yunqing smiled slightly and said, “Ye Yuan, how’s my place?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said with a smile, “Not bad!”

He really felt that it was not bad. With Luo Yunqing’s personality, he must have paid a lot to be able to build such a large foundation.

“This place was originally a small mystic realm. Our Blood Alliance captured it and transformed it into our base camp! Don’t look at how the Pill Alliance is formidable. Once we hide here, even if they dig three feet below the ground, they won’t be able to find us either! In the future, you cultivate here at ease. Leave the rest to me!”

Just as he was speaking, two figures came up to greet.

The two people said in unison, “Alliance Chief!”

Luo Yunqing smiled and said, “Two brothers came just in time. Let me introduce him to you. Ye Yuan, this one was once the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s peerless genius, Yu Haizheng. This is Shangyu Heavenly Sect’s deputy sect master, Zhou Yunxiang! The two of them are now my Alliance Chief’s deputy alliance chiefs and are my left and right arms!”

Ye Yuan saluted the two of them and said, “How do you do, Brother Yu, Brother Zhou!”

Yu Haizheng smiled and said, “I’ve long heard of Younger Brother Ye’s great reputation, pleased to meet you!”

Luo Yunqing continued, “Two brothers, this one is my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s Ye Yuan, the founder of the Pill Pavilion! Also, he’s our Blood Alliance’s new alliance chief too!”

The moment these words came out, Ye Yuan got a shock and knew that things were going to be bad.

Sure enough, the expressions of Yu and Zhou two people changed.

“Alliance Chief, what’s the meaning of this?” Zhou Yunxiang said with a solemn face.

Luo Yunqing was indifferent and said with a smile, “Ye Yuan is my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s new sect master. He naturally can’t be beneath this Luo! So from this day forth, Ye Yuan is my Blood Alliance’s Alliance Chief!”

Before Ye Yuan said anything, Zhou Yunxiang said in a great rage, “Luo Yunqing, what do you treat the Blood Alliance as?! We respect you as our alliance chief. That was you exchanging for it by fighting dauntlessly in bloody battles! This boy has yet to make the smallest contribution. What right does he have to be alliance chief? Your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect is your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s business. What has it got to do with us?”

Yu Haizheng also said, “Alliance Chief, please retract the order!”

The news that the Blood Alliance got was that Ye Yuan returned.

As for what Ye Yuan had done in the True Yang Heavenly Domain, they were not aware.

Under the high pressure from the Pill Alliance, it was too difficult for these scattered factions to want to get intel. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Therefore, letting an upper Jade Sovereign Heaven be their alliance chief, they had ten thousand disapprovals.

Luo Yunqing’s anger loomed, but he still suppressed it and said in a solemn voice, “I’ve already decided on this matter. Don’t mention it again!”

At this point, Ye Yuan had no choice but to speak.

“Brother Luo, I have no intention of assuming this position of alliance chief!” Ye Yuan said.

Luo Yunqing waved his hand lightly and said, “Before Ancestor passed on, he already said before, to have me help you revive the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! Now, how can I override the sect master? Don’t mention this matter again!”

Zhou Yunxiang also had a crude personality and said in a cold voice, “Punk, don’t be phony here. We won’t let you be the alliance chief! Moreover, back then, if not for you, our five sects’ Dao teachings also wouldn’t have been destroyed!”

Luo Yunqing’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a cold voice, “Zhou Yunxiang, what do you mean?”

Zhou Yunxiang smiled coldly and said, “Don’t you understand what I mean?”

Luo Yunqing said in a great rage, “The Pill Alliance schemed for a long time. Even without the Pill Pavilion, they would have launched an attack sooner or later! Furthermore, at that time, there wouldn’t even be us, these remnant spawns! Don’t you even understand this?”

Zhou Yunxiang said with a cold snort, “So what? Blood Alliance was founded by our brothers using their lives. I only don’t want some random Tom, Dick, or Harry that came to harvest our fruits!”

Ye Yuan could not help being speechless when he heard it.

A faction that did not even have Saint Sovereign Heavens, would he be interested?

Don’t look at how each and every one of these people seemed very impressive, rendering the Pill Alliance helpless.

In reality, they were merely a joke in the Pill Alliance’s eyes!

Boom!

Suddenly, the mystic realm shook. Everyone’s expression changed.

And right at this time, a subordinate suddenly came to report in a panic: “Three alliance chiefs, things are bad! Our mystic realm has already been surrounded by the Pill Alliance until not even water can seep through!”

Luo Yunqing’s expression changed wildly, and he said, “Who did the Pill Alliance send?”

The subordinate’s complexion was deathly pale as he said, “There are 15 half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens outside, and countless Jade Sovereign Heaven and Limitless Sublime Heaven powerhouses! Our base should have been exposed!”

The moment everyone heard, their faces turned deathly pale.

They had no way of matching this power at all!

The Pill Alliance’s army clearly came prepared!

Zhou Yunxiang’s expression turned dark, and he pointed at Ye Yuan angrily and said, “It must be this boy! He just arrived, and the Pill Alliance’s people came! Luo Yunqing, you still want him to be the alliance chief?”

Luo Yunqing said in a great rage, “Zhou Yunxiang! Keep talking and Your Father will kill you! Ye Yuan is loyal and righteous. It’s absolutely impossible to betray us!”

But Zhou Yunxiang did not buy it and said with a sneer, “One may know a person for a long time without understanding his true nature! Moreover, so many years have passed. How do you know that he didn’t change? A measly little Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum back then became an upper Jade Sovereign Heaven in a short hundred years, don’t you find it strange?”

Clank!

Luo Yunqing’s long sword suddenly left its sheath, and a sword charged toward Zhou Yunxiang.

Zhou Yunxiang could question him, but he could not question Ye Yuan!

However, this sword was blocked.

The one who blocked this sword was none other than precisely Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Isn’t it just a group of half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens? Leave it to me. Brother Luo, wait for a moment.. I’ll be right back.”
