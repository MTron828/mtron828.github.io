Chapter 1454 Go, Apologize to My Brother!

Lin Xiu’s retreat directly put Qin Zheng in the position of being attacked from both front and rear.

Gui Yun’s oppression plus Ye Yuan’s terrifying speed, he would virtually die for sure.

“Your father will fight it out with you!”

Qin Zheng could not be bothered to lash out at Lin Xiu. He only had time to have mutual destruction with Ye Yuan.

He directly gave up the defense against the Nether Ghostclaw, concentrating his remaining power and met with Ye Yuan in full force!

The all-out attack of a grand completion Heaven Glimpse, the current Ye Yuan could not withstand it at all.

“Gui Yun!”

Ye Yuan bellowed. Gui Yun immediately understood.

The Nether Ghostclaw directly gave up striking Qin Zheng down. He extended his strike between Ye Yuan and Qin Zheng, separating the two.

But this was not over yet. Ye Yuan’s two feet stepped right onto the Nether Ghostclaw’s palm!

Boom!

Qin Zheng’s attack abruptly slammed onto the Nether Ghostclaw’s back. A tremendous impact transmitted over, Ye Yuan directly spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood.

“Chasing ... Moon!”

Borrowing this surge of huge force, the Nether Ghostclaw’s palm escorted, directly superimposing together with Ye Yuan’s Chasing Moon.

Qin Zheng’s attack, the Nether Ghostclaw’s transferred power, plus Chasing Moon’s speed. In this instant, Ye Yuan’s speed was swift to the extreme!

Everyone only felt a blur before their eyes. Ye Yuan’s figure vanished from where he stood!

Lin Xiu had just dashed out over 200 feet away when she suddenly sensed a powerful sword intent rushing over from behind. All the goosebumps on her body broke out.

Too fast!

Currently, Lin Xiu had her back turned to Ye Yuan; wide open. There was no time to defend at all.

A distance of 200 over feet was just a matter of a snap of a finger to Ye Yuan’s speed.

Pfft!

Caught unprepared, the Evil Extermination Sword directly pierced into Lin Xiu’s abdomen.

“ARGH!!”

Lin Xiu screamed shrilly and forlornly. The divine essence in her divine sea seemed like a river breaching its banks; flowing away crazily.

In this instant, too many unforeseen events were experienced. Outsiders could not imagine it at all.

Ye Yuan’s reaction was quick to the extreme, enduring the heavy injuries and forcefully completing this attack.

This degree of injury was not fatal to Lin Xiu, but she already became a cripple.

Lin Xiu’s divine sea was utterly destroyed. At this time, she no longer had any divine essence.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan’s injuries could not be suppressed anymore at this time, bursting forth crazily.

Fresh blood instantly dyed his clothes.

But the current Ye Yuan was akin to a god of war, making everyone hold in awe and veneration.

From Ye Yuan appearing to killing three and injuring one, was merely a quarter of an hour from start to end. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If not for seeing it personally, they totally would not believe that an initial-stage Heaven Glimpse martial artist could actually complete such a magnificent feat.

Everyone all looked at this scene with incredible shock and did not even emit a cry of exclamation.

They seriously could not find the words to describe the astonishment in their hearts currently.

“Ye Yuan, I ... I’ll kill you! You actually ... actually ruined my cultivation!”

On the entire street, there was only Lin Xiu’s shrill scream left, as well as Gui Yun and Qin Zheng’s fighting sounds.

That blow earlier, Gui Yun also suffered considerable injuries. But dealing with Qin Zheng, who was already severely wounded, it was more than enough.

Ye Yuan staggered in front of Lin Xiu. When Lin Xiu saw Ye Yuan, her eyes wanted to spew fire.

“Ye Yuan, you’ll die a horrible death! I curse you ...”

Slap!

A crisp slap echoed, directly slapping Lin Xiu’s entire person flying.

The current Lin Xiu did not have divine essence protecting the body. How could she withstand Ye Yuan’s slap? Half of her pretty face immediately swelled into a pig’s head.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was full of icy-coldness, making no effort to hide his killing intent in the slightest.

After this slap, Lin Xiu immediately became obedient.

She finally knew she was no longer that proud daughter of heaven, but a cripple, a cripple like Little Fatty.

Lin Xiu covered her face and looked at Ye Yuan, two rows of clear tears flowing steadily, her eyes full of fear.

In the current Lin Xiu’s eyes, Ye Yuan was a demon who killed people without batting an eyelid.

Except, Ye Yuan did not have the least bit of pity.

“Go, apologize to my brother!”

Ye Yuan directly hauled Lin Xiu up.

Bang!

Over there, the Nether Ghostclaw slapped down. Qin Zheng was deader than dead.

Thus far, Wu Meng Academy’s five great elite disciples, four were dead, one crippled.

And the entire battle merely lasted for a quarter of an hour.

All of this happened too quickly, quick until the Qin Family and Wu Meng Academy did not react in time and the dust already settled for the fight.

“Go!”

Ye Yuan put Gui Yun away and directly rode his sword and left.

On the streets, everyone exchanged glances, their gazes filled with shock.

Today’s battle simply subverted their understanding.

“I ... I must have been dreaming just now! Is this kind of thing really what an initial-stage Heaven Glimpse can accomplish?”

“Too strong! The few of them were all existences who sweep across all in the same rank. They were actually all killed by Ye Yuan in 15 minutes!”

“Not only is Ye Yuan’s combat power exceedingly powerful, but his ability to adapt at the last-minute is also keen to the extreme. This kind of opponent is really too terrifying!”

“This battle is sufficient to go down in history! If not for seeing with my own eyes, I’d definitely think that it’s rubbish! Indeed, too nonsensical!”

“But Ye Yuan can be considered to have poked a hole in the sky. Regardless of whether it is the Wu Meng Academy or Qin Family, they probably would not drop the matter! It might even startle City Lord, His Excellency!”

...

When Qin Tiannan heard this news, he somewhat doubted if his ears heard wrongly.

“Rubbish! Disregarding Qin Zheng and Qin Pei, that Lin Xiu is the inner-court’s number two, her strength far surpassing those in the same rank! How can a puny little Ye Yuan possibly cripple her divine sea?”

That subordinate said with a guileless look, “Family Head, even if this subordinate has immense courage, I also wouldn’t dare to simply fabricate a story! This matter is absolutely true. There were thousands of people on the scene who saw this battle. Right now, it already spread out in the entire capital city!”

Hearing this, the muscles on Qin Tiannan’s face were twitching. His heart was dripping blood.

Although Qin Zheng and Qin Pei were not as good as Qin Tian, their talents also far surpassed those in the same rank and were bound to be mainstays in the family clan in the future.

Now, they were killed by Ye Yuan just like that!

Qin Tiannan discovered to his dismay that ever since provoking Ye Yuan, the Qin Family did not have one thing that went smoothly.

Now, Qin Tian’s life or death was uncertain, the Qin Family’s elite disciples practically wiped out. The blow to the Qin Family was too great.

Qin Tiannan forcefully endured the rage in his heart and said in a solemn voice, “Where is Ye Yuan now?”

That subordinate said, “Ye Yuan wasted Lin Xiu and detained her at the Myriad Treasure Tower. The cause of this incident is likely still that fatty, Xie Jingyi.”

As the Qin Family’s family head, Xie Jingyi’s matters, he had naturally heard about it.

At that time, he thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure, and that there was nothing wrong with doing so.

On the contrary, although it was a small squabble with the junior disciples, Qin Tiannan felt very liberated instead.

He was even considering setting up a marriage with Lin Xiu after Qin Tian returned.

But he never thought that this matter actually caused such severe consequences.

After the subordinate left, Qin Tiannan gritted his teeth and said in a deep voice, “Looks like for this matter, I have no choice but to request Father to take action!”
