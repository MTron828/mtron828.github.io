Chapter 1957: Seer Nebula

“Master, I finally broke through to True God Realm! I can bring you back to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital!”

Jian Chen rushed into Profound Secrets Pavilion with an excited look, extremely agitated like a small child.

But the moment he entered, he discovered that his master here actually had a guest.

This guest was none other than precisely Ye Yuan. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Chen and said with a smile, “Congratulations, Brother Jian Chen!”

Jian Hongxiao also smiled and said, “Since you broke through, then pack your things. Depart with us tomorrow.”

But Jian Chen stood there in a daze, looking at Ye Yuan with an astonished look.

“You ... You broke through too?” Jian Chen said in disbelief.

Jian Hongxiao said, “Ye Yuan already broke through for quite a while. If not for waiting for him, we’d have long departed.”

Jian Chen had a look of astonishment. Ye Yuan’s accumulations should have been far from his. Why did he break through so much faster than him instead?

Even though there was the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill, it was also not to this extent, right?

...

With Jian Chen coming out of seclusion, the three people stepped onto the road that headed for Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ descendants did not seem to have a fixed territory. They tend to occupy a city or were even under other Heavenly Emperors’ rule.

But this city was like a country within a country; no one could manage it.

Just like Extreme Light Imperial City, although it was just a tiny little imperial city, even imperial capitals, great imperial capitals, or even Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas, never questioned their affairs too.

Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital was likewise the same!

The Jian Family occupying the land of a city seemed to be for the sake of influencing the surroundings.

Their existence was somewhat similar to Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure, but it was also somewhat different.

All in all, the Jian Family was very strong, strong until no one dared to provoke!

Along with the increase in strength, Ye Yuan could also increasingly feel the might of the Jian Family’s power and influence.

“This is Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital? Indeed impressive! I seem to be able to feel that the air is rippling with a mysterious and unfathomable aura. It was as if immersed in a vast sea of stars. Mn? Why do I feel like the entire city is stirring?” Ye Yuan’s brows suddenly furrowed as he cried out in surprise.

It was also Jian Chen’s first time coming. His face was full of solemness as if he was on a pilgrimage.

Jian Hongxiao nodded and said, “Little Friend Ye is indeed extraordinary! It’s said that each great imperial capital has an array formation set up by Ancestor Profound Secrets with great divine ability. Each house in the city, every street, all secretly contains the functioning Dao of the circulatory cycle of stars. It’s an enormous array formation. So for countless tens of thousands of years, people come and go, but the arrangement in the city has never changed before but it has also always been revolving. But situated inside, nobody can detect it at all. I didn’t expect that Little Friend Ye detected it the moment we entered the city.”

Ye Yuan’s thoughts were carried away as he listened. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ good fortune was immense. The might of his means were simply fantastical.

Revolving a circulatory cycle of stars with a great imperial capital, divining Heavenly Dao.

This kind of means was simply inconceivable.

“Impressive! Truly impressive! One day, this Ye really wants to meet Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets!” Ye Yuan exclaimed with admiration.

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “If it were others, I’d definitely laugh at him for being overly conceited. But you, huhu, perhaps there might be this chance in the future.”

Emperor surmounting aura, the chances of becoming a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse was extremely high.

Once he became a Heavenly Emperor, then he would be someone of the same generation as Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets. There might really be the chance.

Of course, he also merely just had a chance.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was different from ordinary Heavenly Emperors, at his level, annihilating Heavenly Emperors with a wave of his hand was also normal!

“Yo, isn’t this Elder Hongxiao? I was wondering why magpies in the courtyard keep chirping today. It turns out that Elder Hongxiao has returned! Hahaha ...”

Just as they were talking, a few people were clustered around a young man as they walked over.

Jian Hongxiao’s brows furrowed and he said, “You’re ... Jian Yun?”

“Tsk tsk, truly hard on you, for Elder Hongxiao to actually remember this, this disappointing brat. However ... I really admire your courage, to actually still have the face to come back!” Jian Yun said with a mocking look on his face.

Jian Hongxiao’s brows furrowed, seemingly not willing to say anymore. He said to Ye Yuan and Jian Chen, “Let’s go!”

But Jian Yun extended his hand to block and said cheerfully, “Don’t go! Come, come, come, everybody come take a look. You all probably don’t recognize this person, right? Let me introduce him to everybody. This old man is the former Stellar Hall’s elder, Jian Hongxiao!”

With him saying so, it immediately drew many people to surround and watch.

Hearing the two words ‘Stellar Hall’, everyone’s faces revealed extremely surprised expressions.

Even Jian Chen also trembled all over, looking at Jian Hongxiao in great astoundment, as if it was his first time knowing him.

“M-Master, you ... you were actually once a Stellar Hall elder? Why have you never told me before?” Jian Chen said with an excited look.

Jian Hongxiao’s expression was very unnatural and did not answer Jian Chen.

Ye Yuan had a blank look, not knowing what special aspect this Stellar Hall had, to actually be able to cause such a big stir.

“Stellar Hall elder? This ... This is a joke, right? How can a Celestial Deity Realm old man possibly be a Stellar Hall elder?”

“Jian Hongxiao, this name seems to be rather familiar!”

“It’s a little familiar, but can’t remember where I’ve heard it before.”

...

Jian Yun looked at everyone’s reaction with a broad smile on his face.

“Heh, speaking of Elder Hongxiao, that was once a great figure who was at the peak of popularity at one time in the Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital! Augury and astronomy, viewing aura and observing people, there was nothing he couldn’t do. People gave the title ‘Seer Nebula.’ Rumors had it that the Stellar Hall would be managed by him in the future!”

Jian Yun spoke freely and boldly as if speaking on a subject with great familiarity. But the expression on his face was full of disdain.

He was naturally not doing so in order to flatter Jian Hongxiao.

Sure enough, the vacantness in people’s eyes gradually dissipated. They finally recalled who this person was.

“Seer Nebula! He’s actually Seer Nebula!”

“Turns out that he’s that Seer Nebula who used a forbidden art and killed his brother and several dozen Stellar Hall disciples!”

“How can this kind of person still have the face to live in this world? Why doesn’t he go and die?”

...

Jian Yun’s words seemed to have thoroughly ignited everyone’s memories.

Jian Hongxiao’s name, the people who knew were not many. But Seer Nebula seemed to be extremely famous in Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital.

Except, the current Jian Hongxiao seemed to have become a rat crossing the street.

For some time, countless cursing sounds drifted over, floating into Jian Hongxiao’s ears.

The wild elation in Jian Chen’s heart instantly became awkwardness. He looked at Jian Hongxiao in disbelief as he muttered, “M-Master, is what they said true?”

Jian Yun smiled and said, “Haha, you take a look at everyone’s reactions and you’ll know whether it’s real or not. Back then, your master disregarded his brother’s objections and activated a forbidden art, wanting to forcefully go against the heavens and change fate. In the end, it triggered the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere. The 36 Stellar Hall disciples in charge of the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere were instantly sucked dry! This incident, could it be that he has never told you before?”

Jian Chen looked at Jian Hongxiao in disbelief. His so many years of hard work, wanting to break through to the True God Realm, it was because he wanted to join the Stellar Hall.

But, arriving at Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, he discovered that his own master was actually the Stellar Hall’s sinner!
