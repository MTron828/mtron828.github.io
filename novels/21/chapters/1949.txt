Chapter 1953: Group Annihilated!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This shock was by no means insignificant!

Could it be that these 20 over True God Realm powerhouses were all summoned over by Ye Yuan?

How could this sort of thing be possible?

Even if Ye Yuan could refine the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill, it was still not possible to have such great rallying power, right?

Forget that Ye Yuan was just a puny little Celestial Deity Realm, even an Empyrean powerhouse also could not possibly rally True God Realm powerhouses belonging to so many different factions at the same time.

“Lord Shadowwind, although it’s our first time meeting, thinking about it, you shouldn’t be very unfamiliar with me, right?” Ye Yuan looked at Shadowwind and said coolly.

Shadowwind’s expression changed several times and said in a solemn voice, “You ... How did you do it?”

He was indeed incomparably stunned in his heart currently. There were far too many doubts.

Firstly, their Deathsoul Gate’s assassins all carried highly toxic medicinal pills.

Once the mission failed, they would commit suicide!

But the black lotuses in his secret chamber did not dissipate. It showed that those five people did not die.

Actually, even if these people did not die, how could they possibly send him this intel to mislead him?

It was completely impossible for their Deathsoul Gate’s people to be controlled by people.

It was just that he did not know that Ye Yuan had a divine soul type empyrean spirit treasure in his hand.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “Your Deathsoul Gate’s poison pills are merely thus. Encountering me, even if they want to die, they also can’t die! As for why these seniors are willing to come to help me, it’s because I still have another identity! I am the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder!”

Shadowwind’s pupils constricted, his eyes revealing a look of disbelief.

The Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s illustrious fame, he naturally knew about it.

The Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder, what kind of concept was that?

That was to say that those Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders who were ridiculously old all had to bow their heads in submission to Ye Yuan!

The Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders, each person’s identity was far more exalted than even Duan Yi, this kind of Myriad Treasure Tower’s tower master.

Hence, how exalted was Ye Yuan’s identity?

It was just that Ye Yuan still had not broken through to True God Realm currently. So how in the world did he do it?

His Alchemy Dao talent was actually so horrifying?

Although the Deathsoul Gate was well-informed, Ye Yuan and Empyrean Flutterfeather battling in alchemy, this sort of inside-news, they naturally did not know about it.

Shadowwind discovered that the Deathsoul Gate’s action this time was simply screwing him over.

Or should he say, the Deathsoul Gate underestimated this Ye Yuan too much!

The Deathsoul Gate took fancy on Ye Yuan being able to refine the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill. That was why they wanted to abduct him away.

But how could Ye Yuan’s value be just a mere Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill?

Shadowwind raised his head to the sky and let out a long sigh as he said, “A mistake! A grave mistake!”

Suddenly, his gaze turned intent, staring at Ye Yuan as he said: “Ye Yuan, you dare to destroy my Deathsoul Gate’s Nine Pledge Branch? Haven’t you considered the consequences?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Of course I’ve considered it, but ... even if I let you leave, will your Deathsoul Gate let me go? Furthermore, as long as the Nine Pledge Branch evaporates into thin air, I don’t believe that your Deathsoul Gate really dares to send people to come and touch me again!”

Shadowwind laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Evaporate into thin air? Heh heh, do you really think that just based on these people, you can keep all of us behind?”

Ye Yuan looked at Shadowwind and smiled.

He took out a tiny tile. All of a sudden, the surrounding space all solidified! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Deathsoul Gate’s people revealed a greatly astonished look as they cried out in surprise, “Traceless Spatial Lock!”

“Huhu, looks like this thing is still pretty useful. With this, you all have nowhere to run anymore, right?” Ye Yuan looked at Shadowwind and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Shadowwind’s face was ashen. He finally knew what was called getting caught in one’s own trap.

The true god mystic treasure that he used to deal with Ye Yuan was actually being used to deal with him now.

As an Eighth Firmament True God mighty powerhouse, even if he could not beat Duan Yi, escaping under the chaotic battle was still not an issue.

But now, space was directly locked down. How could he still run?

“Tower Master Duan, seniors, the remaining things will be left to you guys!” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly and withdrew out of the battle circle.

Duan Yi nodded his head and said, “Rest assured, not one can escape. Leave this Shadowwind to me. The rest will have to trouble everybody.”

Everyone answered, “Tower Master Duan, rest assured!”

Finished talking, Duan Yi’s world domain released, immediately giving the other party a tremendous sense of pressure.

Shadowwind was akin to facing a great enemy. He was only an Eighth Firmament True God. It was still a little too forceful to match up against the Ninth Firmament True God Duan Yi.

Two great pinnacle experts fighting together, the others also each displayed their means, encircling the suppressing the Deathsoul Gate’s people.

Deathsoul Gate’s people were already ambushed earlier, their casualties heavy. Now, facing so many True God Realm powerhouses, how could they still hold out?

Although the Deathsoul Gate also had quite a number of powerhouses, the powerhouses on Ye Yuan’s side were even more than theirs!

Ye Yuan had long learned of the Deathsoul Gate branch’s strength from Lu Xin there. The powerhouses that he found were naturally not mediocre.

The current battle situation was basically two-on-one, or even a situation of three-versus-one.

Very soon, those Deathsoul Gate’s powerhouses perished one after another.

Shadowwind’s strength was indeed formidable. By relying on unpredictable and ever-changing means, he could actually persist bitterly under Duan Yi’s hands.

But it was also merely persisting bitterly.

The Ninth Firmament True God powerhouses already stood at the peak of True God Realm and were far from what Eighth Firmament True Gods could compare to.

Shadowwind being defeated was also just a matter of time.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene, a hint of delight flashing across in his heart.

He learned from Lu Xin there that this Deathsoul Gate’s Nine Pledge Branch could be said to have committed countless crimes and misdeeds.

This branch had already existed for several tens of thousands of years.

In this period, the powerhouses that died under their hands could be counted in hundreds of thousands!

There were even a few times where they destroyed all Celestial Deity Realm and above powerhouses in an imperial capital overnight.

The innocent civilians who died under their hands were even too many to enumerate.

This kind of underground force was simply utterly devoid of conscience.

In the past, Ye Yuan still did not understand the Deathsoul Gate very well. But now, they provoked him, so they would have to suffer his wrath.

Hence, he set up a huge scheme, finding more than 20 True God Realm powerhouses, catching this branch in one fell swoop!

Very soon, the dust settled.

Someone as powerful as Shadowwind also turned to ashes in the end under the suppression of Duan Yi’s powerful means.

Deathsoul Gate’s Nine Pledge Branch was utterly destroyed henceforth.

As for some Celestial Deity level assassins, Ye Yuan already made the arrangements. Not one could escape.

Duan Yi’s figure moved, arriving before Ye Yuan. He then said with a smile, “Elder Ye, we were fortunate to not have failed the mission! This Shadowwind is also indeed hard to handle. If an Eighth Firmament True God came, they might really not be a match!”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Thanks for the trouble, Tower Master! Also, to all the seniors, today’s favor, this Ye has noted it down. In the future, when this Ye breaks through to True God Realm, there will definitely be generous repayment!”

The moment everyone heard, their eyes lit up.

No matter how formidable Ye Yuan was, he was also merely a Five-star Alchemy God. He was not much of a help to them.

But once Ye Yuan broke through to the True God Realm, that was completely different!

A divine-grade rank six divine pill that Ye Yuan casually refined would be immensely helpful to them.
