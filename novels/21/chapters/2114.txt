Chapter 2118: Unexpected Reinforcement

A young man dressed in white robes walked out of the void and slowly walked over toward Ye Yuan. He was actually not the least bit affected by the emperor bone.

“Qi Zixu!”

In the crowd, when Long Zhi saw this youth in white, his expression could not help changing.

Long Xiaochun looked towards Long Zhi with a curious face. She sensed dread from Long Zhi.

Clearly, this Qi Zixu was not ordinary.

Even a fool could also tell that this Qilin Clan’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, who could actually resist the emperor bone’s bloodline pressure, was naturally not an ordinary person.

Qi Shaoyun was still kneeling there right now!

“Ye Yuan is in trouble now. Heavenly Emperor Zixu is actually not afraid of the emperor bone’s pressure!” Long Xiaohai said with a worried look.

But Long Zhi shook his head and said, “Who said that he doesn’t fear the emperor bone’s pressure? If he isn’t afraid, he would have long smacked Ye Yuan to death with one slap!”

Long Xiaohai opened his mouth wide, his face astonished.

This emperor bone’s power truly exceeded imagination!

“It’s actually another Heavenly Emperor! Looks like this time, the Qilin Clan is being serious.”

“An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth. Second Sage really said it correctly! A mere Qi Zhen is nothing in front of this emperor bone.”

“When the Qilin Clan saw this emperor bone, how can they still resist!”

... ...

The demons in the city were all extremely frightened. The current situation already completely went out of control.

Even Gongyang Lie also looked at Heavenly Emperor Zixu stupidly, with a look of astonishment.

He did not think that the Qilin Clan actually even sent out Heavenly Emperor Zixu.

Similarly a Heavenly Emperor, Qi Shaoyun was trash in front of Qi Zixu.

At this time, Ye Yuan had a solemn look on his face. The matter already exceeded his control.

The Qilin Clan’s reaction was far stronger than he imagined.

He also detected that this Qi Zixu’s strength far surpassed Qi Shaoyun. His bloodline power was also unimaginably powerful, even the emperor bone also found it hard to control.

After all, no matter how strong the emperor bone was, it was just a bone too. It was impossible to be infinitely powerful, suppressing all of the Qilin Clan.

When the Qilin Clan’s members became powerful to a certain degree, they would naturally be able to shake off the bloodline pressure.

However, Ye Yuan could feel that this Qi Zixu did not find it easy.

He was just pretending to be calm. Actually, the pressure on his body was not the slightest bit least.

When Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun saw Heavenly Emperor Zixu, his face revealed a look of wild elation.

“Lord Zixu, you ... you came in the nick of time! This brat actually dared to humiliate our Qilin Clan! You have to kill him!” Qi Shaoyun glared at Ye Yuan and said with a look of grief and indignation.

Since making his first appearance in the world, no idea how many tens of thousands of years had passed.

A humiliation like today, he had never experienced it before.

There were countless demon race powerhouses below, but he was pressured by people until he was made to kneel under the watchful gazes of the people.

Heavenly Emperor Zixu nodded slightly, indicating that he got it.

His expression was calm, but actually, all of his body and mind were used to resist the emperor bone’s pressure.

If not for seeing personally with his own eyes, it would also be very hard for him to believe that an emperor bone could actually have such horrifying bloodline pressure.

Under everyone’s stares, Heavenly Emperor Zixu slowly walked in front of the emperor bone.

It was only to see him slowly reach a palm out. Blue fine threads crept out, climbing over toward the emperor bone like vines. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Very soon, the emperor bone was wrapped up by countless Dark marks.

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun and the rest of the Qilin Clan’s powerhouses only felt the pressure on their bodies lighten and they could actually stand up.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, attempting to urge the emperor bone to break free of the constraints of the Dao marks. But that power was too strong. With his strength, he was unable to affect it at all.

Heavenly Emperor Zixu looked at Ye Yuan as if he was looking at an ant and said coolly, “You don’t need to waste your strength anymore. This emperor bone is owned by my Qilin Clan in the first place. Now, it can return to the rightful owner.”

“Hahaha, return to the rightful owner? Your Qilin Clan is really as shameless as before! As the saying goes: a crooked stick will have a crooked shadow. No wonder Qi Yun and Qi Zhen those two people were so shameless,” Ye Yuan said with a loud laugh.

This Qilin Clan’s overbearing and shamelessness, Ye Yuan truly experienced it.

From top to bottom, the style was really unexpectedly the same!

Heavenly Emperor Zixu was totally indifferent and said coolly, “Are you very angry right now? But your fury can’t resolve any problem. What you should be indignant about is your weakness. My Qilin Clan has stood proudly for endless ages. So how formidable is our strength? How can we allow you, a mere True God Realm, to act wildly? Mn?”

A cold snort, Ye Yuan seemed to have received an attack that weighed a heavy 30 thousand catties, causing his figure flying out backward, with fresh blood spurting wildly from his mouth.

Ye Yuan barely managed to stabilize his figure. But the moment he raised his head, Heavenly Emperor Zixu already arrived in front of him.

“Kneel down!”

Heavenly Emperor Zixu gave a low cry. Ye Yuan felt as if the sky had fallen down. Limitless power was forcefully crushing on his shoulders.

Ye Yuan’s sweat instantly broke out, his bone emitting creaking sounds.

The muscles in his body already seeped out blackish-red bloodstains because of the powerful pressure. The situation was looking very grim.

But he stood up stubbornly.

On Ye Yuan’s body, two powerful bloodline powers surged to the sky.

At the same time, the Chaos Heavenspan Canon revolved wildly, attempting to resist this pressure.

In addition, Ye Yuan unleashed spatial law continuously, guiding this power out.

Not reaching a last resort, Ye Yuan did not wish to utilize the Divine Vestige Space.

“Making me kneel? Not unless I die!” Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and said.

When Heavenly Emperor Zixu saw Ye Yuan unleash all of his means and actually barely managed to resist his pressure, this made him incredibly shocked.

He looked at Ye Yuan and nodded slightly as he said, “Spatial law, true dragon bloodline, Qilin bloodline! Your means are really quite a few! I have to admit that you’re very outstanding. It’s a shame that in front of this emperor, all these are merely in vain. Kneel down for this emperor!”

Bang!

An even more horrifying power enveloped down like it blotted out the skies and covered the earth.

Ye Yuan’s vision went dark, and he actually almost really knelt down.

He knew that if he still did not deploy the Divine Vestige Space, he would definitely suffer humiliation today.

Just as his Divine Vestige Space was about to activate, a pure white figure suddenly appeared beside Ye Yuan, brandishing his fist and directly smashing over.

Bang!

Crack, crack, crack ...

Fine cracks actually appeared in the space around Ye Yuan.

In the end, it collapsed with a loud bang.

The pressure on Ye Yuan’s body suddenly eased up and he actually regained freedom of movement.

The heavy pressure that Heavenly Emperor Zixu applied on him was actually smashed to dust by this punch.

He looked at that figure beside him with a surprised face, shocked speechless.

“Heh heh, this young lady said it before; I’m very amazing!” Long Xiaochun brandished her fist at Ye Yuan and gave a beaming smile.

Long Zhi was frightened until he nearly sat on the ground with a plot. He was speechless as he said, “Really damn it! When did this little lass run over!”

Long Xiaochun was clever and mischievous. He was negligent for a moment and she slipped away.

But at this time, he could not look on with folded arms anymore as well. He could only take a step out and arrive above the void.

Heavenly Emperor Zixu looked at Long Xiaochun coldly and said in a solemn voice, “Dragon race little girlie, do you think that this emperor doesn’t dare to kill you?”

“If you dare to kill her, my Dragon Clan will completely break out into war with your Qilin Clan!” Long Zhi said coolly as he slowly walked over.
