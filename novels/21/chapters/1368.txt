Chapter 1372: You Idiot!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Huhu, looks like you didn’t misjudge here. His first round’s performance deceived all of us! Looks like Teacher Lei Dong and Teacher Mu Sen were also deceived by him!” Song Fang said to Jiang Chen with a laugh.

But Jiang Chen did not speak when he heard that, seemingly pondering about something.

“I wonder... Do you think his talent really too poor? If his talent is really very poor, then how did he clear the second round? Even if cultivation realm is compensated, wanting to clear the round isn’t that easy either, right?” Jiang Chen said with a frown.

If his talent was really poor to such a degree, even if a middle-stage Grotto Profound’s realm was compensated, it was basically impossible to pass the second round too.

However, not only did Ye Yuan pass it, he even exceeded by three waves!

“You’re saying ...” Song Fang was also puzzled. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Chen shook his head and said, “I don’t know either! I similarly don’t think that he can beat Jia Chong by comprehending three days! The difficulty of the Wu Meng Wargod Formula, you and I are all too clear!”

Song Fang smiled bitterly and said, “What you said makes sense too. I discovered that this kid is simply an enigmatic existence.”

Jiang Chen smiled bitterly and said, “Carry on watching then. The mystery will be unveiled after a month.”

...

A month’s time passed in a flash. Ye Yuan came to the waiting area and cultivated on his own for a month’s time.

Jia Chong withdrew from the consciousness space. Opening his eyes to take a look, he discovered that the waiting area shockingly only had one person. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

He was first stunned, following that, flowers immediately bloomed in his heart.

“Ignorant fool, directly giving up?” Jia Chong said with a cold smile.

Not just Jia Chong, when the others saw the Ye Yuan who was alone in the waiting area, they had astounded looks too.

“What’s going on here? Why would Ye Yuan be in the waiting area?”

“No idea how long he’s been in the waiting area too, does he have a well-thought-out plan? Or has he already given up?”

“Rubbish, of course he has given up! Wu Meng Wargod Formula, this kind of precious cultivation method, even if one is fully aware that they can’t pass, they will comprehend it well too!”

“This bit of talent and he also dares to challenge Jia Chong, is he soft in the head?”

...

After the astonishment, everyone had disdainful looks towards Ye Yuan.

Originally, people thought that he more or less had some abilities to want to bet with Jia Chong. They did not think that he directly gave up.

This was coming to be a fool, right?

“Alright, the hour has come. The assessment is starting now! Everyone, all go to the waiting area. When you hear your name, come up in proper order! First one, Wang Qiang!” Lei Dong said in a clear voice.

The expression of Wang Qiang, who was called, turned stiff, clearly not quite confident.

He placed his hand on the jade pillar and started revolving the cultivation method.

“HAH!”

Wang Qiang unleashed all of his power, but only reached the third scale line.

“Wang Qiang, test failed! Shatter the wooden tablet yourself and withdraw from the test,” Lei Dong said.

Wang Qiang unwillingly crushed the wooden tablet with a look of regret and was directly transported out.

“Next ...”

One name after another was called. Sure enough, as Xie Jingyi said, the majority of the people were unable to reach the benchmark of five scales.

Xie Jingyi scooted beside Ye Yuan and asked softly, “Bro, what’s the deal with you? When did you withdraw?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I withdrew on the third day.”

Xie Jingyi’s eyeballs went wide, and he looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief as he said, “Hey, bro, are you kidding me?!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “Not joking. Dealing with that guy, three days is enough.”

Xie Jingyi was speechless.

“Heh, I was wondering how thick your cowhide was. It popped from you puffing, right? Not entering the academy, the academy won’t care about your life and death. Therefore, you just wait for death!” Jia Chong arrived beside the two people at goodness knows when and said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to even raise an eyebrow and spat a word out of his mouth, “Idiot!”

Jia Chong’s expression changed, and he said fiercely, “What did you say?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Are you deaf? I said ... you’re an idiot! You’re an idiot! Idiot! Heard it now? If you didn’t hear, I can urge divine essence and be a little louder.”

“Pfft!”

Ye Yuan’s voice was already loud enough. Virtually everyone heard it. Quite a few people could not resist laughing.

Jia Chong’s face had long changed color, wishing to shred Ye Yuan alive.

Except, those two up there were currently watching. He did not dare to make a move.

“Punk, when the assessment is over, I’ll make you regret everything you did today!” Jia Chong gave a cold snort and flicked his sleeves and went off.

He discovered that in front of Ye Yuan, bickering could not gain any advantage at all.

This assessment was very fast. Before long, a large number of people were eliminated.

“Next, Jia Chong!”

Jia Chong stepped out of the ranks proudly when he was called.

He was extremely confident in his comprehension ability. In his eyes, his opponent only had Qin Shao!

The others, he did not place them in his sights at all.

Jia Chong pressed his palm on the jade pillar and revolved the cultivation method. The jade pillar started lighting up.

Clearly, his lighting speed was much faster than those people before!

In virtually a blink of an eye, it broke through five scale lines!

After breaking through five scale lines, the light on the jade pillar did not diminish in the slightest, rising straight up all the way, and arrived at the tenth scale line very quickly!

“S-So strong! Jia Chong’s comprehension ability is too strong! There’s probably only Qin Shao who can compete with him!”

“Broke through the tenth scale line so quickly, he’ll most likely charge up to the 15th!”

“Truly remarkable! Looks like this third round, he still has hope of overpowering Qin Shao.”

...

Jia Chong’s comprehension ability was indeed very strong. His astonishing performance immediately aroused a wave of exclamations.

Even Qin Shao’s face changed slightly too, clearly sensing tremendous pressure.

“17 scale lines! So strong!”

Finally, Jia Chong stopped at the 17th scale line.

This result was sufficient to rank first in previous years.

The faces of the Wu Meng Four Young Masters were all incomparably solemn. Clearly, they did not expect that Jia Chong’s comprehension ability was actually so high!

Obtaining such a good result, the first thing Jia Chong thought of was showing off to Ye Yuan.

His gaze looked in Ye Yuan’s direction, holding peacocking and a demonstration of power in his eyes.

But unfortunately, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to even give him a glance. There was also no surprised expression on his face.

“Punk, there will come a time when you regret it!” Jia Chong thought hatefully in his heart.

“Next, Xie Jingyi!”

Coincidentally, the next after Jia Chong was little fatty Xie Jingyi.

“Come on!” Ye Yuan smiled and patted his shoulder.

Xie Jingyi nodded his head and stood in front of the jade pillar.

Little Fatty sucked in a deep breath, pressing his palm on the jade pillar.

The jade pillar slowly lit up, one scale line, two scale lines ...

Finally, Little Fatty’s scale stopped on the fifth scale line!

Xie Jingyi had a look of wild ecstasy as he shouted: “Hahaha ... I didn’t expect it! I didn’t expect it! I really passed the test! Sniff, sniff ... I ... I really passed the test! Sniff, sniff ... Ye Yuan, thank you!”

As he said, Xie Jingyi actually started crying.

Before coming here, he never dreamed that he could actually pass the test and become a student of the Wu Meng Academy!

He knew that the person he should thank the most was Ye Yuan!
