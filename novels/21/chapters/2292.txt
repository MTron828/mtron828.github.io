Chapter 2296: Reneging

“Hiss ...”

There were sounds of cold air being sucked in all around.

The scene before their eyes had clearly already exceeded their understanding.

Ye Yuan set up five large formations in one breath. Then activated the five large formations at the same time, refining five rank eight divine pills!

This kind of means, forget about seeing it; they had never even heard of it before.

Marvelous work of art!

Inconceivable!

“Is ... Is this Second Sage’s strength? Truly ridiculously strong!”

“Just based on this move, Second Sage has already attained mastery, becoming an ancestor-class powerhouse!”

“We were all duped by his age! Sacred Ancestor High Priest is Sacred Ancestor High Priest; his eyesight is really sharp! The title of Second Sage is well-deserved!”

... ...

The originally doubtful voices all turned into exclamations at this time.

Ye Yuan’s strength already completely subdued them.

The Mu Tiesheng who had just walked out not far away suddenly turned around, two eyes shining.

“V-Vast spirit divine pill!” When he spoke, Mu Tiesheng’s chest was heaving up and down, even his voice was trembling. Clearly, he was extremely excited.

Rank eight vast spirit divine pills were several times more valuable than void spirit divine pills!

Furthermore, there was demand but no supply.

One had to know, Zhao Zixuan and the rest practically represented the peak standard of Eight-star Alchemy Gods already.

Even some senior Eight-star Alchemy Gods, their standards were far inferior to them as well.

When they took action, they could merely just refine void spirit divine pills too.

This showed that the void spirit divine pills circulating on the market were already very, very few.

As for vast spirit divine pills, it was virtually extinct!

“Vast spirit divine pill! Hahaha, vast spirit divine pill! Rich! Really hit the jackpot this time! Fang Tianren, weren’t you showing off just now? Didn’t you say that Second Sage wasn’t even dogfart? Open your dog eyes and look at how strong Second Sage is!”

Mu Tiesheng had been holding his anger the whole time. At this time, he finally released it without any reservation.

Fang Tianren was long already struck senseless, looking at those five medicinal pills in a daze, his entire person in a dumbfounded state.

His medicinal pills were purchased for three billion a pop, this price itself was already very high.

Even if he were to increase the price, it could at most sell for four billion.

But Mu Tiesheng’s medicinal pill?

He only paid the cost price, 300 million a pop!

Vast spirit divine pills had demand but no supply. Even if it was 20 billion each, there would absolutely be Heavenly Emperors who were willing to buy too!

Five medicinal pills were 100 billion!

1.5 billion exchanging for 100 billion ... Fang Tianren felt like his brain was somewhat overwhelmed.

How could it be?

How was this possible?

This young Second Sage who had just stepped into Heavenly Emperor Realm, how could he possibly refine such a high-quality rank eight divine pill?

This time, he really made an error of judgment.

Actually, he did not make much money from these few medicinal pills either.

It was just that he could not afford to offend those few little ancestors either, so he could only swallow the bitterness himself.

Zhao Zixuan’s complexion was ashen, only feeling like his understanding was subverted.

Using Formation Dao Pill Refinement, he refined all five of these extreme medicinal pills. Furthermore, the grade was even higher than theirs.

Without a doubt, Ye Yuan did not go all out.

He only refined five medicinal pills at the same time in order to save trouble.

If he refined it one by one, the quality of the medicinal pills would definitely be higher than now.

It might ... even be possible to attain end spirit divine-grade!

“This ... This is impossible! How can Formation Dao Pill Refinement possibly be refined like you did? You ... How did you do it?” Zhao Zixuan was battered out of his senses as he said.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Nothing is impossible. It’s just that you’re too weak and can’t understand it; that’s all. You feel that it’s impossible for me to reach your level at this age. But that’s just because your understanding limited your imagination. In Alchemy Dao, being this Ye’s junior isn’t unjust for you all!”

Zhao Zixuan five people were all battered out of their senses. Their confidence was shattered until there was not an unscathed spot.

All along, they had always considered themselves to be number one alchemy geniuses.

These few people normally did not yield to anyone, all thinking that they were number one below the heavens.

But today, Ye Yuan shattered their pride into smithereens in a crushing manner.

“Let them go, apologize!” Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly turned sullen and he said in an aggressive manner.

Carrying the might of a great victory, Ye Yuan’s voice could make the deaf hear and the blind see.

The expressions of Zhao Zixuan and the rest changed suddenly. Finally, they were unable to withstand Ye Yuan’s pressure and announced release.

When Heavenly Emperor Justbright two people saw Ye Yuan, their old faces could not help turning red, very embarrassed.

They had lived to a ripe old age, but were schemed against by a few little fellows, and even caused Ye Yuan to expose himself in public. They more or less felt a little bad in their hearts.

Ye Yuan did not express much, but he looked at Zhao Zixuan and said in a solemn voice, “Apologize!”

The faces of Zhao Zixuan and the rest flickered incessantly. Agreeing previously, was because they felt that they would win for sure. Who knew that it would actually end in a disastrous defeat.

These few days of alchemy battle already attracted countless powerhouses.

Now, apologizing in front of so many people was equivalent to damaging the reputation of their own masters.

Thinking up to here, he stiffened his neck and said, “Already released the people! What’s there to apologize? This matter was originally your followers offending us first. So no matter how the logic goes, I’m on the side of reason too! me teaching them a lesson is perfectly justified!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, his gaze sweeping across the other few faces, and he said in a solemn voice, “The few of you are the same too?”

The other few naturally were not willing to diminish their family’s prestige too, how could they possibly apologize in public?

“Of course! This matter was originally your subordinates’ fault. Want to apologize, it should also be them apologizing!”

“Heh, even if you’re Second Sage, you also can’t be unreasonable, right?”

“Why, looking at Second Sage’s appearance, could it be that you’re going to use force? It’s just that your followers’ strength is too weak!”

... ...

These few people were all extremely arrogant. The followers that they brought were all Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperors, wanting to wreck Heavenly Emperor Justbright was all too casual for them.

Therefore, they had nothing to fear.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan turned around and left, walking toward the crowd.

Zhao Zixuan and the rest thought that Ye Yuan was leaving just like that and said disdainfully, “Heh heh, so what if Second Sage? Merely a brat who just entered Heavenly Emperor, that’s all! If I don’t apologize, what can you do to me?”

As Ye Yuan walked, the crowd automatically parted.

But in the crowd, there were two people who were very awkward.

These two people were precisely Leng Tianqi and Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather!

The trap that they carefully set up actually became the battle that achieved Ye Yuan’s fame, what irony!

However, they hid in the crowd and even thought that Ye Yuan did not discover them. Who knew that Ye Yuan actually went straight towards them.

Nowhere to avoid!

Who knew that Ye Yuan walked past them as if no one had seen them.

Ye Yuan continued ahead, gradually walking in front of someone, and said calmly, “Brother Zi Jin, you guys are the host. Is your Cloudheart City ... going to care about this matter or not?”

This person was precisely Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin!

It turned out that he was also hiding in the crowd, observing Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength.

Honestly speaking, he was really taken aback.

He completely did not expect that Ye Yuan actually won in such a manner.

Too exciting! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was just that he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually found him in the crowd at a glance, and came to question him.

Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin also had another identity, that was Cloudheart City’s lord.

This matter should be managed by him.

He looked at Ye Yuan and said with difficulty, “Second Sage, this matter ... was originally your own problem! I feel that Zhao Zixuan they all aren’t wrong!”
