Chapter 1605 The Coldfeather Whose Seniority

Up high in the sky, spiritual energy surged, forming an enormous vortex.

The terrifying spiritual energy undulation gave people a feeling of heart palpitation.

More and more martial artists gathered here, wanting to see who caused such a big commotion.

“I-Isn’t that Elder Ye?”

“Elder Ye? Which Elder Ye?”

“Which Elder Ye can there be? It’s that Elder Ye who refined the void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill a hundred years ago!”

“It really is! He ... Didn’t he die inside the inheritance space? Why did he come out now?”

“Are you dumb?! For him to be able to walk out of the Martial Tower, it clearly shows that he has already obtained the spatial inheritance! You look at him, even though he’s still at the Origin Deity Realm, he can already fly in the air!”

“Hiss! He is really terrifying! 100 years passed, everyone virtually forgot his existence. Most likely, no one would have thought that he actually came back! He’s the first to come out of the spatial inheritance!”

...

When the people recognized that it was Ye Yuan, all of them were extremely surprised.

Ever since that predecessor left behind the spatial inheritance, nobody came out from inside before.

However, when everyone thought that Ye Yuan already died inside, he suddenly charged back!

The moment he took the stage, it was heaven-shocking!

It was not that Ye Yuan deliberately caused such a huge commotion, but his law comprehensions improved too much in these 100 years.

As the saying went, water brimmed only to overflow, the spatial inheritance inside the spatial inheritance was too thin. Ye Yuan did not breakthrough at all in these 100 years. It was equivalent to severely suppressing his realm.

But now, the moment he came out, under the stimulation of the abundant spiritual energy of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s inner city, he could not control it any longer. He started to directly break through crazily.

Ye Yuan’s divine sea was like a lake that had dried to the extreme already; thirsting to the extreme.

Seeing spiritual energy at this time, it was akin to a good rain after a long drought and started to absorb water frantically.

If it were others, such frenzied absorption of spiritual energy, the meridians within their bodies would have long burst apart.

But Ye Yuan even complained that the spiritual energy was not strong enough, not turbulent enough.

This bit of spiritual energy was not even enough to fill the crevices between his teeth!

Very soon, the Pill Tower’s and Martial Tower’s upper echelons were alarmed.

Ruo Xu looked at that figure in the sky, his expression ugly to the extreme.

How can it be?! How is it possible?! He clearly already died inside the spatial inheritance, why would he show up here? Why?! Ruo Xu shouted frantically in his heart.

News of Ye Yuan’s return was absolutely like a thunderclap from a clear sky to him!

An Alchemy Dao powerhouse who could refine void spirit divine-grade, replacing him in the future was virtually a sure thing.

He did not wish for this kind of thing to happen to him.

Not far away, the elders were incomparably amazed.

“It’s really Elder Ye! He came out of the Martial Tower! Could it be that he has already understood spatial laws? This talent is a little too monstrous, right?”

“Isn’t that so! His Alchemy Dao talent is already formidable until it makes people despair in the first place. Didn’t expect that his martial arts talent is actually so terrifying too.”

“The inheritance of spatial laws is what nobody has ever successfully comprehended before. He actually succeeded, truly inconceivable!”

“Mn? Who is that? So unfamiliar!”

Suddenly an elder noticed a black-robed person below the Martial Tower.

The black-robed person had his gaze fixed on the Ye Yuan in the sky, his gaze flicking incessantly. No one could guess what he was thinking.

Suddenly, someone came forward and berated, “Who are you? Don’t you know that this place is the Martial Tower’s restricted area? Arbitrarily barging into the Martial Tower’s restricted area, do you know what crime that is?”

Coldfeather’s brows furrowed and suddenly threw a slap out like lightning.

That person laughed coldly and was just about to make a move to block when Coldfeather’s slap disappeared bizarrely.

Slap!

This slap directly sent the other party flying!

“Who the hell do you think you are, to also dare shout and wrangle at this seat?” Coldfeather said in a cold voice.

Lin Dong held half of his face, his eyes filled with fear.

Originally, when he saw Ye Yuan returning, he was incomparably irritated in his heart.

At this time, he just happened to see Coldfeather, this person whose background was unknown. Hence, he wanted to find the other party to vent his frustration.

He reckoned that his strength was about the same as the other party. If really getting into a fight, it might be able to interrupt Ye Yuan’s breakthrough.

But he never dreamed that the other party’s strength was actually so formidable, sending him flying with one slap.

Lin Dong was incomparably astonished in his heart. That slap just now was absolutely spatial laws!

Why did this person of unknown origins also know spatial laws?

“You ... You made a move in the Martial Tower! Today, you can forget about walking out of the Martial Tower!” Lin Dong said furiously.

The commotion here drew the attention of quite a few powerhouses. An old man’s gaze turned intent and he carefully sized Coldfeather up.

He kept feeling that this face was rather familiar.

Coldfeather gave Lin Dong a glance and could not even be bothered with him.

That old man’s face suddenly changed and he walked over to this side.

Lin Dong seemed to have detected the old man’s movements and could not help being overjoyed. Looking at Coldfeather, he said with a cold smile, “Who asked you to be wild?! Now, even Head Elder is startled, I see how you die!”

Coldfeather’s gaze also looked over towards that old man, his face revealing a ruminating look.

Lin Dong hurriedly went up to greet, bowing to that old man and said, “Head Elder, this fellow’s origin is unknown and he actually even dared to attack and injure people; having no respect for our Martial Tower at all!”

This old man was none other than precisely the Martial Tower’s head elder, Zheng Qi.

Zheng Qi waved his hand at Lin Dong, indicating for him to not be wordy. Then he gave a bow to Coldfeather and said, “Dare I ask, could your esteemed self be ... Coldfeather, Grandmaster Coldfeather[1]?”

Coldfeather was rather surprised as he said, “Mn? You know me?”

When Zheng Qi saw the other party acknowledged it, he could not help being overjoyed and bowed down deeply towards Coldfeather and said, “I didn’t expect that it’s really Grandmaster Coldfeather! I am Grandpupil Zheng Qi, my master is Wu Xingtang!”

Coldfeather revealed a look of surprise and said in amazement, “You’re Xingtang’s disciple? Looking at your strength, you’re currently the Martial Tower’s head elder?”

Zheng Qi hurriedly said, “Grandpupil is incapable and shamelessly being the Martial Tower’s head elder.”

Coldfeather nodded his head and said with a sigh, “Xingtang this boy is pretty good, it’s also considered to have developed our lineage to greater heights. You’re already the head elder, then where is he now?”

Zheng Qi was crestfallen as he said, “Several tens of thousands of years ago, Master died in a mystic realm.”

Coldfeather looked dejected and immediately let out a sigh and said, “It’s a pity! Xingtang was the disciple I was most proud of. I didn’t expect that us master and disciple, two people, had limited luck!”

Lin Dong listened by the side until he nearly bit his own tongue, his entire mind completely blanked.

Head Elder actually called this old man as his grandmaster! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Grandmaster!

Lin Dong completely did not expect that this old man who popped out from God knows where, his seniority was actually high until it was frightening!

What did he do just now?

But Coldfeather two people were immersed in grief and did not have time to go and pay attention to him at all.

Zheng Qi was careful as he asked, “Grandmaster Coldfeather took the risk and entered the inheritance space back then, Master even thought that you ... fell inside the spatial inheritance. He wouldn’t expect that your elderly self is actually still alive! Master’s spirit in heaven must be very relieved.”

Coldfeather gave a self-mocking laugh and said, “Didn’t die, but also not much difference from dead. If not for encountering Ye Yuan, I can only stay inside the spatial inheritance all my life and be a person who is not dead, and yet not alive.”

[1] Grandmaster in this case refers to master’s master.
