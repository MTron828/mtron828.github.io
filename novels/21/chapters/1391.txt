Chapter 1395 Raising

Passing through a dense forest, over a dozen stalks of spirit medicines entered Ye Yuan’s eyes.

“Heh, didn’t expect that my luck was so good. The moment I came out, I ran into a dozen over stalks of Heavenly Fragrance Lotus Lush Grass.”

Ye Yuan had just been transported over no long and smelled the scent of spirit medicines, and searched all the way over. He did not expect that the harvests were considerable.

Ye Yuan was just about to gather these Heavenly Fragrance Lotus Lush Grass when there was another series of activities in the dense forest.

“Heh, didn’t expect to run into over a dozen stalks of Heavenly Fragrance Lotus Lush Grass all at once. Luck is really not bad.”

A young man walked out from the other side of the dense forest. The words he said were exactly the same as what Ye Yuan said.

However, he directly ignored Ye Yuan.

This late-stage Grotto Profound rookie, he did not take him seriously at all.

“Kid, these spirit medicines, I’m collecting them. My, Grandpa Qiao’s, mood today is pretty good, so I won’t kill you. Get lost!” the young man waved his hand and said very magnanimously.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was tickled and said with a laugh, “These spirit medicines were discovered by me first. It’s not very appropriate for you to do so, right?”

Qiao Jie laughed loudly when he heard it and said, “Boy, you probably don’t know your Grandpa Qiao, right? In a while, go and inquire about it, the name of Heavenly Feather Capital City’s outer-court’s Qiao Jie!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Don’t know, not interested in knowing either. Now, scram as far away as you can for me.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan walked straight for those spirit medicines.

Qiao Jie’s face fell, and he said with a cold snort, “Reckless and blind fool, refusing face when given!”

Qiao Jie directly drew his sword and stabbed towards Ye Yuan. He was actually really going to kill.

Ye Yuan could not even be bothered to raise his eyelid. Waving his hand, a sword slashed out.

Qiao Jie’s aura was originally imposing. But the moment Ye Yuan’s sword emerged, his face revealed a look of great horror, hurriedly changing the straight stab to a block.

He never dreamed that a late-stage Grotto Profound could use such a heaven-shocking sword.

This casual slash of Ye Yuan’s shocked his three spiritual and seven physical souls out.

Clank!

Qiao Jie’s sword was directly cut into two parts!

He repeatedly fell back several steps, the shock on his face lingering on for a long time.

If that sword went a little deeper just now, he would be directly cleaved into two halves currently.

Qiao Jie could not figure out how a late-stage Grotto Profound would have such powerful strength!

“You ... How are you so strong?”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him, putting those Heavenly Fragrance Lotus Lush Grass into his storage ring.

“Still not scramming?” Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said in a solemn voice.

Qiao Jie was startled and turned tail and ran. It was only to see him making three steps as if it was two steps, disappearing in Ye Yuan’s line of sight in a twinkle.

Ye Yuan slowly put away the storage ring and slowly moved forward.

The storage rings on each person’s hand were all newly issued by the person leading the team after entering the mystic realm.

Prior to this, all of them were requested to not bring their own storage rings in.

This way, it could prevent people from cheating.

Furthermore, this storage ring was specially made. Once a person shattered the jade pendant, it would automatically separate from the body and become other people’s spoils of war.

“Why didn’t you kill him?” At this time, Dustless suddenly spoke up.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “We just came in, no hurry. Leave his small life. Later, I’ll directly take it from them.”

Dustless was stunned when he heard it and immediately burst into laughter and said, “You, punk, are too sinister! No wonder you had me plant a mark on every one of them. Turns out that it’s actually this plan!”

Ye Yuan’s meaning was, raise these people first, let them search for natural treasures everywhere.

At the end, Ye Yuan would directly snatch the storage rings off the others.

When at the altar, Ye Yuan had Dustless plan a mark on each of Zuo Xiang Capital City’s students.

Dustless was an empyrean spirit treasure’s artifact spirit. Leaving behind a trace of a mark on a bunch of Heaven Glimpse Realms and Grotto Profound Realms was all too simple.

Of course, there were also Qin Tian and Qin Yuanlong they all.

As long as these people entered a certain range of Ye Yuan’s proximity, Dustless would be able to detect them.

Weren’t they here to kill him? Play hide and seek with them then.

“Heh, these outer-court disciples, nobody is my match at all. Those inner-court disciples, I can’t beat them either. This trial doesn’t have much meaning at all. Therefore, better to not waste time on this. We’d best go find Little Fatty first. If they can’t find me, I’m afraid that someone will have ideas about him. If Qin Family inner-court disciples find him, that would be bad,” Ye Yuan said.

These few years, Ye Yuan directly consumed the medicinal pills that he newly researched. His realm was already no far from grand completion Grotto Profound.

Coupled with Sundering Stars already gradually approaching grand completion, Ye Yuan’s current strength was no idea how much stronger compared to when fighting with Qin Shao.

Ordinary grand completion Grotto Profound Realms, even half-step Heaven Glimpse, very few were Ye Yuan’s match as well.

Hence, these outer-court disciples could not arouse his interest at all.

Take that Qiao Jie just now for example; if Ye Yuan really had killing intent aroused, the other party would not even get to crush the jade pendant and would be instantly killed by him.

Through three years of tempering, Ye Yuan became more and more accustomed to utilizing Sundering Stars.

If not unleashing with all his might, he could even achieve instant-casting Sundering Stars, just like earlier.

This jade pendant was in order to protect these disciples to the greatest degree. But in past trials, there was no lack of those who were killed before even crushing the jade pendants in time.

Firstly, those people did not wish to give up on the natural treasures they found until the end.

On the other hand, even though the transported area was separated for outer-court and inner-court, these two areas were connected!

Once there were inner-court disciples who infiltrated into the outer-court disciples’ region, suddenly sneak attacking, how could a Grotto Profound Realm rookie react in time?

Therefore, in this trial, everyone had to maintain a high-level mental tension.

Any instant of relaxation might very likely be fatal.

...

After several days, in the inner-court region, three figures gathered together.

“Big Brother Qin Tian!” Qin Pei and Qin Zheng saluted to Qin Tian. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Tian nodded his head slightly and said, “Mn, Father expended considerable thoughts and effort for the same of the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time. Therefore, Ye Yuan must die this time!”

“That is, of course! Yu-er’s enmity, I couldn’t wait long ago!” Qin Pei said indignantly.

“This punk swept away our Qin Family’s face in front of the whole city. Not killing him, it’s hard to dispel the hatred in my heart!” Qin Zheng also said.

Clearly, they had great resentment toward Ye Yuan.

Qin Tian suddenly flipped his palm over. A flesh-colored little bug was faintly discernible on his palm.

“Uncle Yuanlong already planted the Child-Mother Heart Linking Bug onto Ye Yuan with a secret art. I can already sense his position currently! We’ll sneak over quietly so as to not let him discover us. This kid is very astute, we only have one chance. We must be doubly cautious. Before we make a move, we must have full assurance! If we let him crush the jade pendant, we won’t have the chance anymore!” Qin Tian said in a solemn voice.

Qin Pei said, “Big Brother, rest assured, with the three of our strength, plus the Heart Refining Turtle Breathing Formula, even if he walks by us, it’s impossible to discover it too!”

Qin Tian nodded and said, “Okay, let’s set off.”
