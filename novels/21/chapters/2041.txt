Chapter 2045: Choice

“What’s going on here? Two of them rejected Empyrean Pilljade in a row. This isn’t surprising, but why did they all go to Ye Yuan there?”

“In the past sessions, everyone all racked their brains, wanting to go under an Ancestor Realm’s tutelage.”

“Empyrean Flutterfeather defeated Empyrean Pilljade, and they actually did not pick him either?”

...

A series of curious voices came from the Empyrean seats.

Luo Tianqi and Li Qing’s action was seriously perplexing.

As for Empyrean Pilljade, his face was already black as the bottom of a pot.

When had he, the exalted Southern Border’s number one person, lowered himself to take the initiative to go and recruit disciples?

Today, he opened his mouth twice in a row and was actually rejected!

This old face was really thrown until his grandmother’s place this time.

But what made them more surprised was still at the back.

Third place!

Fourth place!

...

All the way until the eighth place, they actually all chose Ye Yuan!

The group of grandmasters could not sit still anymore. When the ninth place stepped out of the ranks, Empyrean Blazing Sun immediately opened his mouth and said, “Zhou Yunhao, come to this Empyrean here, this Empyrean will do everything to guide and take care of you.”

Empyrean Windrider also opened his mouth and said, “Zhou Yunhao, the disciples under this Empyrean are presently all powerhouses that can take charge of a region alone. If you follow this Empyrean, you’ll surely be able to rise head and shoulders above others in the future.”

Apart from these two, the others also opened their mouths one after another.

Zhou Yunhao stood there, his face looking hesitant, but his eyes kept looking over toward Ye Yuan there non-stop.

Everyone was secretly surprised in their hearts, the grandmaster that this Zhou Yunhao favored was clearly Ye Yuan too.

Just what magical powers did this Ye Yuan have, to actually be able to make these geniuses abandon Ancestor Realm powerhouses and choose him?

Very soon, apart from the two Ancestor Realm powerhouses, the other grandmasters expressed their stands one after another, promising great benefits, attempting to recruit Zhou Yunhao.

Only Ye Yuan alone kept his mouth shut and did not speak. It was as if these had nothing to do with him at all.

Ye Yuan was clear in his heart that these summit’s geniuses were only like this because they saw Ning Siyu’s breathtaking performance.

As long as one was not a fool, they would be able to tell that Ye Yuan had the right way of teaching disciples. He was far stronger than those so-called Ancestor Realm powerhouses.

After hesitating slightly, Zhou Yunhao chose Ye Yuan.

With this, the group of Empyreans was really shocked.

Some grandmasters even swallowed their pride already and made very heavy promises, but Zhou Yunhao still picked Ye Yuan!

Next, the ninth place!

Tenth place!

...

20th place!

The Five-star group’s top 20 actually all chose Ye Yuan.

The eyeballs of the powerhouses on the grandmaster seats and Empyrean seats were almost bursting out.

It was still the first time this kind of sight appeared in previous Cloudpill Summits.

After all, in the past, even if there was Empyrean Pilljade this Ancestor Realm powerhouse, many geniuses ranked towards the back all had the self-awareness and knew that it was impossible to be chosen. So they picked other grandmasters.

But this time, 20 people actually chose Ye Yuan without exception!

This kind of shock was too intense.

Even Empyrean Flutterfeather also looked towards Ye Yuan with a stunned look, eyes full of doubt.

It was not that he was jealous. It was just surprising.

One had to know, he defeated the Southern Border’s number one person, Empyrean Pilljade, in front of everybody’s faces. Not a single genius actually picked him.

“This ... Just why is this?”

“Unable to understand! Truly unable to understand! Even if he’s peerlessly talented, he’s also merely a Six-star Alchemy God. His realm did not reach the Ancestor Realm either. But why didn’t a single person pick Pilljade or Flutterfeather, the two great Empyreans?”

“Could it be that these little fellows’ brains collectively went brain-dead?”

...

Those Empyrean powerhouses could not hold back the doubts in their hearts, discussing animatedly.

To these Seven-star Alchemy Gods, taking in disciples was just a small thing, the truly important matter was the Peak Alchemy Meet.

As for the Cloudpill Summit, they at most understood a little about which geniuses were more dazzling this time.

How could they have thought that the actions of these young geniuses were actually because of a little girl?

The Empyrean presiding over was full of shock. It was still his first time encountering such a situation.

He sucked in a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart, and opened his mouth once more and said: “Next, Six-star group, Yun Yi.”

Six-star group, Yun Yi slowly stepped out of the ranks.

Everyone knew that the true main show had arrived. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After all, no matter how strong the Five-star group was, they were also just Five-star. They still needed a long time to nurture.

But the Six-star group was different, these geniuses were already powerhouses that could take charge as chief at a front.

As long as groomed properly, becoming Seven-star Alchemy Gods in the future was virtually a sure bet.

Even those grandmasters also all pulled themselves together anew, planning on making a move to vie.

As for Yun Yi, they completely could not be bothered to care.

He was Empyrean Pilljade’s great-grandson. If one used the buttocks to think, one would also know that he would choose Pilljade. The others naturally would not rack their brains in vain.

“Yi-er, come over,” Empyrean Pilljade slowly opened his mouth and said.

As he said, he even gave Ye Yuan a proud glance.

Just some Five-star brats, so what even if there were none?

It was sufficient that he, Pilljade, had Yun Yi this great-grandson of his.

Yun Yi was the junior that he liked the most, his talent in alchemy crushing his peers.

Of course, apart from Ye Yuan this kind of freak.

But Yun Yi did not walk toward Empyrean Pilljade’s virtual image, but stood on the spot, wavering and not advancing.

Empyrean Pilljade’s brows furrowed. His voice became deeper as he said again, “Yi-er?”

At this time, everyone’s gazes were gathered on Yun Yi.

During each session’s Cloudpill Summit, the Six-star group’s first place were all the target that the various major factions fought for.

This time, because it was Yun Yi, so everyone kept silent.

But looking at this situation now, something was not quite right!

Suddenly, Yun Yi sucked in a deep breath and directly knelt down toward Empyrean Pilljade and said, “Ancestor, forgive my crime. Yi-er wishes to enter Ye Yuan’s tutelage. I hope that Ancestor can fulfill my wish!”

“WHAT?!”

Empyrean Pilljade suddenly stood up, his eyes full of disbelief.

Forget about other people choosing Ye Yuan; now, even his biological great-grandson actually chose Ye Yuan? How could he not be shocked?

Not just Empyrean Pilljade, everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied, looking at Yun Yi in disbelief.

Empyrean Pilljade’s great-grandson actually chose his sworn enemy, Ye Yuan. How could this not surprise them?

“You ... You unfilial child!” Empyrean Pilljade pointed at Yun Yi. His entire body was trembling, clearly already furious to the extreme.

Yun Yi had a calm look as he said, “Ancestor, Grandchild is unfilial. But I hope that Ancestor can understand Grandchild’s pursuit of Alchemy Dao.”

Finished talking, Yun Yi walked toward Ye Yuan’s virtual image without the slightest hesitation, standing at the forefront.

No mocking, no sarcasm; Yun Yi’s action shocked everyone.

With Yun Yi’s action, how the choices next already did not have the slightest suspense.

The top 20 of the Five-star and Six-star groups, a total of 40 people, were all standing in front of Ye Yuan’s virtual image.

It was actually empty without a single soul in front of the other 13 grandmasters’ virtual images.

The plaza was deathly silent.

Everyone’s gazes were focused on Ye Yuan.

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly got up. Amidst everyone’s gazes, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “Siyu.”

Ning Siyu was overjoyed and hurriedly stepped out of the ranks, and directly knelt down toward Ye Yuan.

“Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan slowly nodded and said, “In these thousand years, you followed me to refine pills and waited on me. Today, I’ll take you in and officially take you in as a disciple. Are you willing?”
