Chapter 3014: Fusing Bloodlines, Shocking Change!

“Is this the strength of the young patriarchs? I even thought that I could enjoy it to my heart’s content. But it seems to be somewhat disappointing!” Ye Yuan looked at the Long Zhu, who collapsed on the ground, and shook his head as he said with a sigh.

The expressions of Long He and the few others were very ugly. This was really a public face-slapping.

Originally thought that dealing with an Emperor Cloud Heaven would be effortless, who could have thought that he would be so strong!

This was really kicking onto a metal plate.

Long He’s expression turned dark, and he said, “What you used were all human race techniques! Could it be that our Dragon CLan is going to be ruled by a human in the future?”

“Ye Yuan, we view you as family; it’s because of your dragon race bloodline, and not human!”

“If you want to become the young patriarch, you’ll have to use bloodline talent to prove yourself!”

These words were really shameless.

Just now, they said that they wanted to witness the power of the chaos divine essence. Alright, now that they could not win, they wanted to compete in bloodline.

Rustling sounds came from the crowd. Clearly, they felt a great loss in face too.

But they were still opposed to Ye Yuan becoming their young patriarch.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard and said, “Looks like you all are planning to give up and act recklessly! However, I’m very stubborn! If you’re not convinced, I’ll beat you until you’re convinced! You all want to compete in bloodline, don’t you? Okay, I’ll compete with you guys!”

The moment these words came out, Long He and the rest were overjoyed in their hearts.

This boy was really easy to dupe!

Competing in bloodline, wouldn’t we crush you?

It would not be to an extent that you were also peak heaven qian grade bloodline, right?

Even if you were really peak heaven qian grade, you were a major cultivation realm below us!

Crushing you was an easy thing!

Of course, this sort of words, they were not easy to say out.

Either way, Ye Yuan himself agreed. As long as they defeat him, everything would be fine!

Long He slowly stepped out and said coolly, “Alright. This time, I’ll compete with you!”

Whoosh!

There was a commotion in the crowd.

“This … I seriously can’t watch anymore! Upper Emperor Vast Heaven against upper Emperor Cloud Heaven, how does he have the cheek?”

“This is too much! Why didn’t I discover before that Long He is so shameless?”

“Ye Yuan has already backed down time and again. Long He is still reaching for a yard after taking an inch! Don’t tell me that this is called a fair fight too?”

… …

Although everyone felt that Ye Yuan being the dragon race’s young patriarch was not reliable, Long He was indeed too much.

Chaos divine essence was strong. This was already evident to all. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Long He spurred Ye Yuan on, making him bind both his hands, not allowing him to use chaos divine essence.

Now, Ye Yuan was using bloodline power, and he was also oppressing Ye Yuan with cultivation realm.

This … a brilliant play!

Ye Yuan was indifferent. Taking two small bottles out, he smiled and said, “Forget it. Originally, I was planning to go into closed-seclusion. But, since you want to compete in bloodline power, I’ll fulfill your wish then!”

Finished saying, he directly absorbed the two drops of blood essence into his body.

Boom!

The violent bloodline power instantly erupted.

Four great bloodlines caused a huge reaction within Ye Yuan’s body all at once.

Four fearsome forces rose to the sky. The entire Heavenly Dragon Island had a fierce gale that started howling.

With this, everyone was shocked!

“Eh,?that seems to be the blood essence that Progenitor extorted from Bai Zhi and Xuan Taiqing, right?”

“Ye Yuan directly swallowed it? He’s going to fuse two kinds of bloodlines at once?”

“It’s not two! It … It’s four! Is this guy crazy? He’ll blow up and die!”

… …

The moment his aura was released, people discovered to their shock that it turned out Ye Yuan actually already had two kinds of bloodlines in his body!

Now, Ye Yuan actually collected Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise, four great bloodlines!

Furthermore, he was going to merge them together at the same time!

This way of doing things was really too crazy!

No one dared to fuse these four kinds of bloodlines at the same time. The berserk chaos energy would directly blow people up.

Even the most talented bloodline warrior did not dare as well!

This approach was no different from committing suicide.

Yet, Ye Yuan did it!

When Long Hai saw the situation, he could not help laughing as he said, “This boy is really tired of living! He actually wants to fuse four great supreme chaos bloodlines at the same time?”

But Long Jian’s expression became strange, and he said, “That’s not right! It turns out that Progenitor left behind these two races’ bloodline for Ye Yuan! Doesn’t that mean that Progenitor is planning to see Ye Yuan fusing the bloodlines?”

Long Hai’s expression changed, and he said, “How is this possible? In this world, it’s impossible for anyone to fuse the four great bloodlines together!”

But Long Jian disagreed and shook his head and said, “Didn’t you notice that Ye Yuan has already perfectly fused the dragon and phoenix, two races’ bloodlines?”

Long Hai was shocked, only then noticing that he had overlooked this.

Without a doubt, Progenitor valued Ye Yuan very much.

For his sake, he even did not balk at offending the Hegemons of all the heavens!

Then it was impossible for Progenitor to watch Ye Yuan send himself to death, unless he was sure that Ye Yuan could perfectly fuse the four great bloodlines!

But how was this possible?

The two great Supreme Hegemons had both fallen into immense shock.

Within Ye Yuan’s body, bloodlines boiled over!

All the blood in his body was like boiling water, jostling against the meridians in his entire body until it was almost exploding.

However, Ye Yuan was long prepared for this situation.

In the Dao sword, the origin of blood flowed out and started to draw the four great bloodlines together.

Then it continuously mixed them.

Like everyone, Long He also thought that Ye Yuan was bringing about his own doom.

But, along with the passage of time, he discovered that Ye Yuan’s aura had gradually stabilized.

The four great bloodlines actually showed signs of merging together.

His expression changed, figure moving explosively, attacking Ye Yuan!

“Stop!” Long Jian’s angry cry came from the void.

At the same time, he was about to make a move to stop Long He.

“It’s fine. Let him come over!” Ye Yuan endured the immense pain and said lightly.

Long Jian’s brows furrowed, and sure enough, he stopped taking action.

Boom!

The place where Ye Yuan was standing directly had a large hole smashed out.

But he was long gone.

Ye Yuan’s aura was still climbing frenziedly.

Above the void, the phantoms of the four great chaos true spirits were currently condensing gradually.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Long He’s strength was formidable.

But unfortunately, his movement technique was still too slow.

Ye Yuan possessed the chaos divine essence. When executing spatial rule, his speed was swift to the extreme.

As long as he did not confront Long He head-on, Long He could not catch up at all.

“Ye Yuan, what kind of hero are you considered if you avoid like this and not fight!” Long He shouted angrily.

Depressed!

He, a dignified upper Emperor Vast Heaven, actually could not catch up to an Emperor Cloud Heaven!

“Hur hur,?no rush. You’ll be crying in a while!” Ye Yuan said with a light laugh.

At this time, the four great bloodlines within Ye Yuan’s body gradually had laws of operation under the guidance of the origin of blood.

Four kinds of bloodlines formed one tiny whirlpool after another in Ye Yuan’s meridians.

Boom!

Suddenly, the four great bloodlines directly fused together.

A surging power of chaos erupted within Ye Yuan’s body!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, and he actually felt the power of chaos divine essence!

He was overjoyed in his heart. The fusion of the four great bloodlines actually had such a miraculous effect!

He hurriedly revolved the Chaos Heaven Trampling Skill, guiding the chaos divine essence.

And in the outside world, Ye Yuan’s aura was rising crazily, directly reaching grand completion Emperor Cloud Heaven!

Boom!

Above the void, the Door of Eternal Life appeared once again!
