Chapter 2876 Executioner, Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan threw a punch over, Bloodtrue’s pupils constricted.

He could not block this punch!

“Ancestor!” Bloodtrue’s eyes turned bloodshot as he roared.

Right at this time, a voice came down from above the void, “Bloodazure, let Bloodtrue off. This seat will owe you a favor.” Boom!

Ye Yuan’s fist directly tore Bloodtrue apart without any sluggishness.

Sorry, who are you?

Is your favor very valuable?

Killing the strongest, Bloodtrue, the remaining ones were even too weak to withstand a single blow.

His strength was long already invincible in the same rank.

One should not look at how this passageway had a lot of numbers. To Ye Yuan, numbers could not change anymore.

He was like a tiger entering a flock of sheep; places that he passed through, corpses scattered everywhere.

Apologies, no corpses. It was directly obliterated!

The blood race did not have corpses! “Good! Good! Good! Very good! Huhu, a mere Saint Sovereign Heaven actually directly treated this seat as air!” Above the void, Bloodsword stomped his feet in anger.

An exalted Emperor Sakra Heaven was actually being disregarded!

That brat called Bloodazure did not even pay attention to him!

By the side, Su Mu also looked at him with a sympathetic look as he said, “Calm down. He’s just a junior. If he’s dead, then he’s dead.”

Bloodtrue’s talent was indeed high. But, no matter how high, he was also just Saint Sovereign Heaven. It was not worth flying into a rage.

Bloodsword’s descendants were in great numbers. There would always be a few outstanding ones.

As for finding trouble?

Don’t even think about it!

The overseers in the clan were still watching!

Regarding the hundred sons selection, the Blood God Temple attached a lot of importance to it. They would send overseers to each city.

It was for the sake of ensuring impartiality of the selection.

Although he was angry, Bloodsword really did not dare to do anything to Ye Yuan! If Ye Yuan faded into mediocrity, then forget it. Yet, his strength was formidable. There was absolutely no problem entering the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons!

Such a genius, how could the clan possibly allow Bloodsword to deal with him?

Ye Yuan also knew this. That was why he would go on a killing spree.

The current Ye Yuan had already gone mad from killing!

we

was

Over 80 thousand Saint Sovereign Heavens were fleeing crazily inside the space. There was already no one who dared to contend with Ye Yuan head-on.

They already understood that Ye Yuan’s strength was on a completely different level than them.

Head-on fighting was no different from seeking death.

But Ye Yuan did not have the intention of letting them off. His movement technique was extremely fast, places that he passed through, a bunch of bloodkins would directly disappear.

The numbers in number one passageway were diminishing at a speed visible to the naked eye. There was no retreat route in the passageway. The only way out was the passageway. When Ye Yuan was chasing, some people also wanted to take the chance to escape from the passageway entrance. But what welcomed them was a punch from beyond the heavens, directly quelling them.

Hence, a strange scene appeared in the number one passageway.

Ye Yuan alone was chasing 80 thousand Saint Sovereign Heavens and killing them. On the battle hunting ground’s grandstands, it had already completely boiled over with excitement.

“Where did this guy pop out from? This … This is also too strong, right?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“My eyesight must be freaking failing! Number one passageway, which time didn’t kill until heaven and earth dimmed? This time, it’s actually one person hunting down 80 thousand people?”

“Dark horse! An absolute dark horse! This guy’s strength can probably already enter the hundred sons top five!”

“Too monstrous! Too monstrous! Our Giant Net City is going to shock the Blood God Temple with this!”

… …

The scene that appeared before their eyes was seriously too surprising.

They originally planned to watch a miserable fight. But in the end, what they saw was one person hunting down several tens of thousands of people!

Time slowly trickled by. Ye Yuan already turned into a super demon king, making the people in number one passageway tremble with fear when they heard him.

……

At the second floor space, there were already many people who were successful.

Along with the passage of time, the numbers became more and more.

But what they found strange was that the number one passageway did not have people come out of it from start to end! “Eh, it’s really strange. Is the fighting in the number one passageway this time so tragic? More than 90 people in our number three passageway have already come out. Yet, they actually didn’t have a single person coming out!”

“The first level is merely playing. Those guys wouldn’t have pulled out the big guns, right? But even so, it also wouldn’t be completely zero, right?”

“Now this is interesting. Three days will be up very soon. Are they planning on rushing out together?”

The first group’s 1000 people already reached over 800 people at this time.

The first level’s contention was only three days’ time.

Presently, the time limit was going to be up very soon. But, not a single person came out of the number one passageway. This made everyone incomparably surprised.

These bloodkinds all gathered together, speculating on all sorts of possibilities.

Just like that, the 900 people from number two passageway to number ten passageway were gathered very soon.

But number one passageway still had no activities.

Time slowly trickled by. It looked like the three days time limit was going to be up right away. The questions in everyone’s hearts grew more and more.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, the passageway opened, a figure flew straight out.

Seeing this person, the 900 people present could not help being stupefied.

Who was this person? Where’s Bloodtrue?

Where’s Chou Yang?

Where’s He Ming?

Why was it an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven who came up?

Were those guys all defeated by Ye Yuan?

“Hey, kid, where are the others? Why is it just you alone who came up?” The number two passageway’s first place could not hold back his doubts and asked Ye Yuan.

Although Ye Yuan was the only one who came up, he naturally would not be scared of Ye Yuan.

It was because his strength was not the slightest bit weaker than Bloodtrue they all.

It was just that he did not know, when those bloodkins in the first level saw Ye Yuan now, they practically wanted to piss their pants.

This guy was too horrifying!

The people were naturally not killed entirely.

Over 80 thousand people, there were too many of them.

Even if it was standing there to let Ye Yuan kill, Ye Yuan would have to kill for a long time too; let alone that those people fled desperately. In three days, Ye Yuan killed nearly 40 thousand people, killing until even his hands felt weak!

In the end, he actually could not quite kill anymore.

Ye Yuan was strong, but he was not strong until he could be like back then, slaughtering hundreds of millions of lifeforms with one finger. They were the same rank after all. He still had to kill one by one.

After adjusting his breathing for some time, Ye Yuan immediately came up.

As for the rest, they naturally did not dare to come up anymore.

Courting death?

Ye Yuan did not answer the ‘first place.’ He swept a glance over everyone’s faces and said with a smile, “Mn, this time, there’s no need to kill until my hands turn into jelly anymore. Just a few hundred people, killing all of you won’t take too much effort.”

……

Half a day later, the first group was completely wiped out!

Ye Yuan stepped into the passageway with a back view that appeared slightly lonely.

He bagged this spot.

This time, he was the first to come out.

The battle situations of the other nine groups were much fiercer than group one.

When Ye Yuan returned to the battle hunting ground, the hundreds of thousands of spectators on the grandstands fell into a death-like silence.

Their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan were filled with fear.

This guy was an out-and-out executioner!

All 900 proud sons of heaven, he killed them all by himself!

These few thousand years, the hundred sons battle had already been hosted god knows how many times. Such a thing had never appeared before.

Even if the blood race was extremely warlike, they were intimidated by Ye Yuan too! “Hahaha … Too weak! A bunch of trash! You can’t even block one of your Grandpa Qing’s spear! Sure enough, Grandpa Qing is the first to come out! Humph humph, Your Father said to take first place; it means I’m taking first place! Eh, you punk, you actually came out earlier than me? But it’s no use. Your Grandpa Qing challenged ten half-step Emperor Realms with one spear, fighting until none of them dared to make a move! How is it? Impressive or not?”

Suddenly, Yang Qing’s figure appeared above the grandstands. The moment he came out, he made an unnecessary fuss and was incomparably arrogant.
