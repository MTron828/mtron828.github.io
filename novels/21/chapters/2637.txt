Chapter 2643: Land of Heavenly South

“S-Senior, just now … I’ve offended you just now,” Huang Haoyan said with a deathly pale complexion.

The combat power that Ye Yuan displayed struck deep terror into him.

Thinking of how his group of people was even posturing in front of him, there was a feeling of courting death.

Ye Yuan naturally could not be bothered to stoop to his level and said indifferently, “Where is this place?”

Huang Haoyan hurriedly said, “This place is the Thistle South Sea Region.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said, “Thistle South Sea Region? How far is it from the Five Light Heavenly Region?”

It was his first time hearing this name. Ye Yuan only knew that the Rainclear Continent’s domain was massive, the Five Great Heavenly Regions could not completely cover it.

The borders of the Rainclear Continent were the endless sea region.

These sea regions were the forbidden areas for the powerhouses on the continent.

Because there were countless powerful life forms in the ocean!

Even a Saint Sovereign Heaven could not rely on their individual power to cross the sea region too.

Because there were some existences rivaling Saint Sovereign Heaven in the ocean, and even more terrifying existences.

He did not expect that he actually came to the sea in an accident arising from many causes!

It was just that, did not know what coordinates this sea region was in the Five Light Heavenly Region, and how far away it was.

Ye Yuan was very concerned about the Five Light Heavenly Region’s situation. Although he knew that the Five Light Heavenly Region and the black-robed old man likely had a bleak chance of survival, but not getting the news, he still could not give up.

It was just that on the vast ocean, where would he go to inquire about the news?

“Five Light Heavenly Region? That’s the Central Plains, it’s at least several decades of journey away from here! Furthermore, there’s even a Myriad Demons Mountain separating in the middle! Senior actually came from the Five Light Heavenly Region?” Huang Haoyan said in surprise.

There were countless great demons in the Myriad Demons Mountain!

There were even a whole bunch of Jade Sovereign Heaven level true spirits.

It was very hard for Huang Haoyan to imagine how Ye Yuan came here from the Five Light Heavenly Region.

Although he repelled the merfolk army alone, it was also impossible to be a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum’s match, let alone talk about Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum true spirits.

Ye Yuan became even more mysterious in the eyes of the few people there.

The moment Ye Yuan heard this, he could not help feeling his head swell.

Several decades of journey, that was really too far!

With his current speed on food, traveling 100 thousand over miles a day was par for the course.

Several decades of journey, that would have to be calculated in hundreds of millions!

Ye Yuan did not reply Huang Haoyan’s questioning and continued asking, “Looking at your attire, you don’t look like a fisherman on the sea. Could it be that the land that you guys are living on, actually doesn’t belong to the Five Great Heavenly Regions?”

Huang Haoyan nodded and said, “The Five Great Heavenly Regions occupy 80% of Rainclear Continent’s domain. But our Land of Heavenly South just happens to be part of that 20%. Oh, I heard my father say that our Land of Heavenly South is called the Land of Barbaric South out of your mouths. The few of us are all the Land of Heavenly South’s southernmost tip’s Calm South City’s people.”

Speaking of the Land of Barbaric South, Ye Yuan had some impression of it.

When he was in the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, he had naturally read many records before. Among them were records of the Land of Barbaric South.

There were even legends that Zhuo Bufan’s disappearance was actually going out to sea from the Land of Barbaric South and he had not returned to this day!

It was just that, this version was untenable in the eyes of many people.

After all, there were far too many powerhouses in the sea.

However, the Five Great Heavenly Regions were separated by a Myriad Demons Mountain from this place, so there were very few records. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan knew about the Myriad Demons Mountain.

In this mountain, there were countless true spirits. There were probably even more Jade Sovereign Heaven level true spirits than humans.

He heard that there were even Saint Sovereign Heaven level true spirits in it.

Therefore, no matter which faction, they all did not dare to make a move against the Myriad Demons Mountain.

Even Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses did not dare to easily climb over the Myriad Demons Mountain too.

Unless one’s strength reached Saint Sovereign Heaven level, only then could they suppress the great demons there.

He did not expect that he drifted in the void and actually ran so far all at once, directly being thrown into the sea.

Arriving here was not all bad either.

At least, he would not be pursued by the Pill Alliance.

But the problem was, he wanted to take revenge and could not go back for the time being as well.

With his current strength, there was simply no way to cross the Myriad Demons Mountain.

Could it be that he really had to cultivate to Saint Sovereign Heavenly Stratum before he could return?

At that time, he would not be afraid of the Pill Alliance anymore. Except, how long would it take?

When Ye Yuan was drifting in the void, he had once thought of many ways to seek revenge.

He firmly believed that as long as he hid in the dark, he could cause heavy losses to the Pill Alliance!

But now, all of it could not be used anymore.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression flickered incessantly, anger looming in his eyes, Huang Haoyan did not even dare to breathe loudly.

Finally, Ye Yuan let out a long sigh and said, “Since I came, I might as well stay and make the best of it! Bring me to Calm South City then!”

Huang Haoyan was taken aback when he heard that and said, “Senior wants to go to Calm South City?”

“Why? Can’t I?” Ye Yuan retorted with a question.

Huang Haoyan shook his head repeatedly and said, “No, no, no! Of course, you can! If Senior wants to go, we naturally welcome you.”

How could he afford to provoke Ye Yuan? He hurriedly agreed.

Along the way, Ye Yuan asked a lot about the situation in the Land of Heavenly South.

Calm South City was a major city in the south and was quite strong.

Because the Heavenly Stratum powerhouses here would suffer the attack of the true spirit sea race from time to time.

Here, there was no difference between ascenders and native forces.

As long as one was strong enough, they could survive. No one would discriminate against an individual for being an ascender.

Ye Yuan understood this point too.

This was because the seafolk were too powerful!

The number of true spirit seafolk was simply an astronomical figure.

Even if one stacked with human heads, the pressure on the various races on land was tremendous too.

Regardless of whether it was a native faction or ascenders, they all had to face the threat of the sea race. They had no choice but to stick together and unite against the foreign forces.

Although the sea was rich in produces, the living conditions were not as good as on land.

Therefore, the true spirit sea race would follow the current during the morning and evening tides and attack the city.

Their goal was nothing more than to plunder the materials and treasures of humans.

Furthermore, the true spirit sea race was bloodthirsty. Every time they reached a place, there would be a bloodbath.

Therefore, the various races’ Heavenly Stratum powerhouses on land were irreconcilably hostile with the sea race.

But the sea was vast and also an excellent place to train.

Therefore, the various races’ powerhouses would often head to the sea in groups, firstly to hunt for treasures. Secondly, it was to train.

Huang Haoyan this group of people’s trip was precisely to go and train.

It was just that they did not expect to cause such a big commotion.

“Logically speaking, you guys only stole some treasures. The merfolk tribe shouldn’t have gone so far as to be so irreconcilable till death, insisting on hunting you all down. Did you guys steal something incredible?” Ye Yuan asked with a frown.

Huang Haoyan shook his head and said, “There are quite a few good stuff, but there’s also no amazing treasure!”

Ye Yuan said, “Let me see!”

Huang Haoyan did not dare to disobey. The few people took out all of the treasures obtained, virtually covering half of the deck.

When Ye Yuan saw, he could not help rolling his eyes too.

This bunch of guys could really cause trouble!

After stealing so many treasures, it would have been strange if the merfolk tribe did not go crazy!

Fortunately, the merfolk tribe was not considered strong. He could barely manage to handle it.

If a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse came, Ye Yuan would have long run by himself.

After checking it, Ye Yuan did not discover anything peculiar either.

But there were a few items that Ye Yuan felt were rather good.

Among them was a conch-like item that caught Ye Yuan’s attention.
