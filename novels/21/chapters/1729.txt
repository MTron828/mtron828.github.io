Chapter 1733 Making a Detour

Yu Jing was a woman, furthermore, a beautiful woman.

Beautiful women naturally could not bear being covered all over with medicinal smell.

Adding on rouge and powder, the medicinal smell left on the body was already very, very faint.

But even so, Ye Yuan only relied on one sniff and could infer so much information. This skill was truly inconceivable.

“I didn’t expect that Brother Ye concealed so deeply!” Duan Peng looked at Ye Yuan, a hint of pleasant surprise flashing across his eyes.

With such a formidable alchemist following their side, it was absolutely an unexpected surprise!

Teams with alchemists were universally acknowledged as having the lowest casualty rates.

It was just that alchemists were too expensive, they could not afford it at all.

Ye Yuan said to Yu Jing, “The Firecloud Ice Edge Bug is extremely rare. It can’t be seen in the outside world at all. This kind of poison is indeed troublesome. This is because its ice and fire attributes, two attributes, interweave within the body, permeating all pores, like a millstone, subverting Yin and Yang, tormenting the martial artist’s body.”

Yu Jing nodded and said, “Yes, yes, yes, that’s it! Ye Yuan, do you ... do you really have a way?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “This poison is indeed powerful, so there’s no method for the time being.”

The moment these words came out, Yu Jing’s face revealed an incomparably disappointed look.

But by the side, Luo Yong burst into laughter and said, “Haha, you talked for half a day, but it’s equivalent to saying nothing! I even thought about how capable you were. Who knew that after talking for so long, it’s equivalent to letting out a fart!”

Ye Yuan could not even be bothered to pay attention to him and asked Yu Jing, “Elder Sister Jing, the place where your younger brother was bitten by the bug, do you know where it is?”

Yu Jing shook her head blankly and said, “They were being hunted down by a very powerful fierce beast back then, fleeing in any path without any care. He did not know where he was bitten at all.”

The moment Luo Yong heard, he revealed a gloating smile again.

With this, all of the clues were cut off, right?

Ye Yuan did not feel that there was anything and asked again: “Then ... you guys are very familiar with the Skydemon Mountain Range. Do you know whether there’s some dark and humid place, overflowing with miasma, yet also a place where earth-fire is especially vigorous?”

Yu Jing still shook her head blankly, but Duan Peng suddenly said, “If it’s this kind of place, I know one.”

Seeing everyone look over, Duan Peng said, “Evil Water Ravine!”

The others were still, but the moment Luo Yong heard, his face could not help changing as he said, “It’s that legendary Evil Water Ravine that has no return?”

Duan Peng also said with a solemn look, “That’s right!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s it! Let’s go and take a look!”

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone stupefied.

Duan Peng did not expect Ye Yuan to leave right away and said in a solemn voice, “Brother Ye is taking things a little too lightly, right? This trip into the Skydemon Mountain Range, we have another goal. Making a detour to Evil Water Ravine now is probably inappropriate, right? Moreover, Evil Water Ravine is notoriously dangerous. The poison bugs inside are countless. A single misstep and we’d all die there.”

Luo Yong also sneered when he heard that and said, “Kid, our squad was hired by Boss Duan with money, why is it like you’re the employer now?”

When Yu Jing heard Ye Yuan’s words, her heart could not help turning warm.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “This Ye is an alchemist. In my eyes, nothing is more important than saving people. Moreover ... to talk about danger, our destination this time is definitely no better than the Evil Water Ravine, right?”

Duan Peng’s expression changed when he heard that and fell silent.

Luo Yong’s expression similarly changed. He said in a cold voice, “Kid, what do you mean?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Nothing. Boss Duan said that when he entered the mountain last time, he accidentally learned of a place with the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit. But he definitely didn’t tell you guys that not only does the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit have the Purple-eyed Devil Ape, this kind of powerful accompanying beast, but there’s also even an accompanying spirit medicine like the Green Vine Emerald Net Flower. And the Green Vine Emerald Net Flower has the Darknight Poison Bat, this kind of accompanying beast. I think that these things added together, that place probably won’t be much safer than the Evil Water Ravine, right?”

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone’s countenance change visibly.

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape was a powerful rank four fierce beast. There was no need to talk much about it.

Darknight Poison Bat was similarly a fierce beast that made people’s expressions change when they heard it. More importantly, they gathered in flocks; best to not provoke.

Martial artists were not alchemists in the end, how could they be so clear about the habits of spirit medicines?

The Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit was an extremely rare rank four spirit medicine, it could be sold for a high price when obtained.

They also did not think so much and followed along.

Who knew that that place was actually so dangerous!

“Duan Peng, what’s the meaning of this?” Luo Yong’s face fell and he questioned.

Duan Peng himself was also blindsided. These things that Ye Yuan said, he really did not know.

Back then, when he saw the Purple-eyed Devil Ape, he immediately ran away and did not see anything else at all.

“I really didn’t know that that place was actually so dangerous!” Duan Peng said anxiously.

Luo Yong said with a cold snort, “You’ve been there, would you not know? At this point, do you still take us to be fools? Your father isn’t going anymore!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I think that Boss Duan really doesn’t know. The Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit faces the sun, it’s likely at the entrance of some cave. The Vine Emerald Net Flower likes Yin and should be in the depths of a cave. But once startled the Purple-eyed Devil Ape, the Darknight Poison Bat will surely be startled too.”

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone feel lingering fear. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

If they went over without due consideration like this, once surrounded by Darknight Poison Bats, they would not even know how they died.

Luo Yong said with a cold snort, “Since you knew, why didn’t you say it earlier? I think that you’re harboring ill intent!”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes at him and said, “If I said earlier, would you all believe?”

Everyone could not help feeling suffocated when they heard it. If not for Ye Yuan displaying astonishing Alchemy Dao strength, they definitely would not believe.

A Third Firmament Divine Lord’s words were not enough to believe.

Luo Yong’s face fell and he waved his hand and said, “Don’t care, your father isn’t going anymore! Although treasures are good, I also need to have the life to take them. Your father doesn’t want to die in vain!”

As he said, he was actually really about to leave.

Boss Duan had a look of unwillingness and stopped Luo Yong, and said, “Don’t go, as long as we can obtain the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit, you and I split 60% equally, the others share 40%! As long as our tactics are reasonable, it’s not without a chance!”

The corners of Luo Yong’s mouth curled, revealing a smile of his trickery succeeding.

He naturally did not want to really go, he just wanted to use this to exploit Boss Duan.

Although his strength was inferior to Boss Duan’s, he was a true-blue Sixth Firmament Divine Lord powerhouse too.

This place could lack anyone but just could not lack him.

Luo Yong indeed stopped and looked at Boss Duan and said, “This is what you said!”

Duan Peng was just about to answer when Ye Yuan said coolly, “Then you should let him go. I have a way to not only obtain the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit, but we can also obtain the Green Vine Emerald Net Flower! Furthermore, as long as you all make a trip to Evil Water Ravine with me, Elder Sister Jing and I, we won’t take a single penny. The Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit and Green Vine Emerald Net Flower are all yours!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed.

Duan Peng said with great joy, “Is this true?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “When you told me that the objective of this trip is the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit, I already made the preparations in the city. This minor matter is naturally nothing difficult.”

Luo Yong immediately froze there, unable to leave.

So awkward!
