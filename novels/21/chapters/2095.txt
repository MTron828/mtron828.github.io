Chapter 2099: He Has Been Lonely for Too Long

“Master, Little Junior Brother he ... seems to be somewhat dissatisfied with your decision, and he arbitrarily summoned Ye Yuan to Westspirit Region,” Ji Mo said with a helpless look[1].

Sacred Ancestor High Priest stood with his hands behind his back. Suddenly, he reached his hand out and beckoned. A table-sized chessboard landed on the table.

“Ji Mo, you bring this chessboard and make a trip to Wan Xiang Great Imperial Capital.” Wing said with a faint smile.

Ji Mo’s entire body trembled and he said, “Master, this ... this is the Ask Not chessboard that you studied for several million years! You’re actually going to let that kid crack it? You ... wouldn’t really take him to be Second Sage, right?”

When he said this, Ji Mo’s words more or less still carried some indignation.

He touched his heart and felt that when he was young, he also had talent that did not lose to Ye Yuan.

However, he did not obtain his master’s such serious and earnest response.

Wing gave Ji Mo a meaningful glance and said with a smile, “Second Sage? Huhu, Ji Mo, the more one cares about this title, the more one can’t amount to anything great! You apprentice brothers pay too much attention to this title! To people who pursue Dao, all undeserved reputation is fabricated, only one’s own strength is real!”

Ji Mo trembled again, his face revealing an ashamed expression as he bowed. He then said, “What Master says is extremely right. Ji Mo has learned it.”

These days, them apprentice brothers cared about this title of Second Sage immensely.

One had to know, they all, these apprentice brothers, had already followed Sacred Ancestor High Priest for several millions of years. But no one could get this name.

But now, a measly little True God Realm, Six-star Alchemy God, was actually enjoying such a revered reputation.

What did ‘Second Sage’ mean?

That was an existence second only to the sacred ancestor high priest. Furthermore, it was the honor of having the Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally grant it.

But now, Sacred Ancestor High Priest roused the dreamer from sleep with a word. Ji Mo could not help being taken aback by surprise.

He gave him a glance and said with a faint smile, “The so-called martial artists yearn for Dao is actually merely a joke. This world is a vanity fair. How many can throw aside fame and pursue Great Dao? Even those high and mighty Dao Ancestors probably find it hard to truly abandon this world’s fame and gain too. But this Ye Yuan, this seat has observed him for a long time. His Dao is different from the others! In Alchemy Dao, his innocence and devotion definitely have never wavered before! And this is also the greatest difference between you all apprentice brothers and him!”

Ji Mo’s expression gradually became solemn. The more he followed by Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s side, the more he felt his shallowness.

It was just that this logic, him understanding did not mean that he could really do it.

In this world, who did not understand the logic of yearning for Dao?

But after reaching Empyrean Realm, cultivation is easily calculated with millions of years. How many powerhouses could really endure the whittling of time?

Time was a butcher’s blade!

Since time immemorial, how many Empyreans, or even Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, had it killed?

“What Master said, Ji Mo has received the teachings!” Ji Mo said respectfully.

“Haha, go on! This seat already can’t wait and want to have a battle with this boy. Truly an opponent that makes people’s hot blood seethe!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priests gaze seemed to have passed through the firmament, arriving at the Northernmost Steppe.

... ...

“Huhu, looks like ... Sacred Ancestor High Priest can’t quite stand the loneliness anymore!”

Hearing what Gongyang Lie said, a hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

His gaze looked towards the horizon as if piercing through the void, meeting eyes with a certain someone on the horizon.

The so-called being spiritually attached to a friend that one had not met, was likely talking about the two of them, right?

It was just that Ye Yuan’s words were so uninhibited and unbridled in Gongyang Lie’s view.

“Humph! Don’t Second Sage forget, your title is bestowed by Sacred Ancestor High Priest. The minimum respect should still be shown!” Gongyang Lie said unhappily.

How shocking was the rage of a Heavenly Emperor?

Huntwind and the rest were crushed by this powerful pressure until they could not breathe and did not even dare to raise their heads.

In Gongyang Lie’s view, High Priest Redplume was already a paramount existence.

Then, what kind of existence was his master, Sacred Ancestor High Priest?

People should not look at how they called him Second Sage. In reality, there were not many who truly took him to be Second Sage.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a faint smile, “Goat beard, one day in the future, you’ll know what I mean. Sacred Ancestor High Priest he ... has been lonely for too long. You all won’t understand.”

Gongyang Lie seemed to only have a hazy notion, but he still gave a cold snort and stopped talking.

Before coming, High Priest Redplume instructed before, to make sure not to rub Second Sage the wrong way.

Gongyang Lie was merely a servant, so he naturally did not dare to defy.

“Alright, you can go. Half a year later, I’ll keep the appointment.” Ye Yuan waved his hand and motioned for Gongyang Lie to leave.

Gongyang Lie had an oppressed look as he said with a cold smile, “Very well! I hope that half a year later, Lord Second Sage won’t disappoint Gongyang! Farewell!”

Done talking, Gongyang Lie’s figure gradually turned illusory, finally disappearing.

Only after Gongyang Lie’s figure completely vanished did Huntwind and the rest finally let out a sigh in relief.

Just now, Lord Gongyang Lie was clearly already enraged. It was just that due to Lord Second Sage’s identity, that was why he forcefully pressed it down.

Except, the pressure of a Heavenly Emperor was too strong. Many Empyreans were already dog-tired and could not even stand.

Empyrean Huntwind had a bitter face as he said, “Lord Second Sage, you ... you’re a big shot, but it’s too much for us, these small fries!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, your friendly sentiments, this Ye will bear it in mind. This half a year, I’ll create several Empyrean powerhouses for your demon race.”

... ...

Empyrean Vast Wind’s demise in battle shook the entire Northernmost Steppe.

Vast Wind two brothers, as well as Feng Tianyang’s passing, changed the entire Northernmost Steppe’s arrangement.

Vast Wind Assemble fell apart, while Empyrean Tian Jue, Empyrean Mie Yu, Empyrean Zhen Huang, and the rest of the powerful Empyrean powerhouses broke away from central authority and exercised local power. The Northernmost Steppe entered the warring states era, having endless disputes.

But a legend was left behind in this land of extreme north.

“You all don’t know how insufferably arrogant Feng Tianyang was back then. The fusion of three laws, that power, even if an Empyrean powerhouse saw, they would also have to keep a wide berth. But Lord Ji Qingyun directly annihilated him with just a casual sword!”

“Master Ji is really my extreme north human race’s savior! If not for him, our extreme north’s human race will probably be plunged into an abyss of suffering!”

“Master Ji is truly remarkable! I heard that he’s even the demon race’s Second Sage. Even if Empyrean Huntwind saw him, he has to bow his head in submission and be obedient!”

... ...

After that incident, Ye Yuan ordered Empyrean Huntwind that the demon race was not to invade the human territory within a thousand years. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

It was also precisely because of this order that let the human race barely manage to maintain.

The land of extreme north was where the strong feeds and the weak were prey. What Ye Yuan could do was also just this.

If the human race was still unable to give birth to powerhouses that were able to resist the demon race within a thousand years, then it was also not his fault anymore.

Survival of the fittest in natural selection.

It was impossible for Ye Yuan to protect the extreme north human race for life. Their strength still needed themselves.

And in this half a year, Ye Yuan refined several heaven-rank Demon Empyrean Pills for the extreme north’s demon race, creating several Empyrean powerhouses for the extreme north’s demon race.

The demon race simply prostrated on all fours in admiration toward Ye Yuan, this Second Sage.

Half a year later, Ye Yuan brought Lu-er and the rest, and stepped onto the road leading to the Westspirit Region.
