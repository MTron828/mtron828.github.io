Chapter 1060: Displaying Invincible Might

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Well done, Lu-er!” Ye Yuan said to the cold girl beside with a grin on his face.

This cold girl was none other than precisely the Lu-er who was in closed-seclusion for a long time.

These few years, Lu-er had been in closed-seclusion inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda the whole time. With the help of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills, she advanced swiftly and vigorously, and already broke through to Dao Profound Realm not long ago!

The Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian was indeed a spirit physique hard to come across. Her cultivation speed was actually even a bit faster than Ye Yuan’s.

Especially after Ye Yuan converted Lu-er’s frost poison into a vortex, her cultivation speed became even greater than before.

Lu-er had a blissful look. Her cold face instantly melted, seemingly like a glacier melting, instantly stunning everyone.

“Lu-er has followed Young Master for so many years. Finally, I can be of help to Young Master,” Lu-er said happily.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Your Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian is a physique of extreme cold, the jinx of iceflames. Although your cultivation realm is not there yet, the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma can’t do anything to you at all.”

Lu-er nodded and said, “Young Master, you just bother with catching it. Leave this iceflame to Lu-er.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and stomped forward!

When the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma saw the situation, it was seemingly like it had its tail stepped on, spraying out a massive cloud of iceflames in one go.

Lu-er followed closely behind Ye Yuan, emperor qi spitting wildly, freezing those iceflames into ice in an instant.

This scene stunned everybody.

Especially Ding Zhanguo and Shu Yunqing. The two of them were well aware of the iceflames’ prowess. Did not expect that Ye Yuan let out a young lass who was actually completely immune to the iceflames.

Ding Zhanguo said absentmindedly, “Truly didn’t think that the jinx of the iceflames was actually the Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian! Looks like that Ji kid was long prepared!”

Ye Yuan wanted to refine the Dao Defying Pill. Naturally, he studied these nine great spirit medicines very in-depth.

This Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma was long researched thoroughly by Ye Yuan already.

“Damn it!”

He Dajiang secretly gnashed his teeth. Little did he think that Ye Yuan actually dealt with the iceflames, this big problem, with the greatest of ease.

But the more anxious he was, the more he could not take Ao Qian down.

Instead, Ao Qian almost reversed the situation quite a number of times by taking advantage of when he was distracted.

“Heh, want to fight, got to focus a bit. It’s out of the question for you to be like this!” Ao Qian said with a scoff.

Inside the Profound Heaven Nine Battles Formation, Ye Yuan had been wandering around erratically the entire time and did not unleash attacks at the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma immediately.

Lu-er followed slowly behind and opened up the path for Ye Yuan.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s fingertip quivered. A streak of cold light flashed past, piercing straight for the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma!

Chiii!

A row of iceflames lit up, instantly striking that streak of cold light.

A bit of flying ash landed from the sky, turning into dust. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ye Yuan was not discouraged. He continued walking and said to Lu-er, “Keep your eyes on my movements!”

Lu-er understood tacitly and said, “Don’t worry, Young Master!”

Ye Yuan hastened his movement technique, and another streak of cold light flashed past. This time, Lu-er learned her lesson. A fine streak of emperor qi struck out, instantly turning that trace of iceflames into ice cubes.

Chiii!

A light ring echoed out as if there was something pricked into the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma’s body.

The Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma trembled all over as if it was convulsing.

Ye Yuan did not have the slightest hesitation. Flinging his hands, several streaks of cold light was fired out again, hitting the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma.

This time, the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma’s body stiffened up and collapsed onto the ground with a loud bang.

The Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma that even two great Void Mystic powerhouses could not take down was finished off by Ye Yuan just like this.

Those few streaks of cold light were silver needles prepared by Ye Yuan in advance. It was dipped in a medicinal liquid that Ye Yuan concocted to specifically target the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma.

As long as the medicine spirit was hit, it would reveal its original form.

After the Iceflame Mystic Sovereign Ganoderma fell to the ground, it transformed into the appearance of a ganoderma very quickly, being returned to its original form.

Ye Yuan did not say a word and directly put it away. This first of the nine great core medicines was obtained without much trouble at all.

Two great super holy lands restrained each other. In the end, it actually benefited Ye Yuan.

He Dajiang never thought that Ye Yuan would take care of the medicine spirit in no time flat, and his expression could not help changing greatly.

“Quickly withdraw!” He Dajiang shouted.

As he was speaking, He Dajiang suddenly urged his divine king domain to the limits, attempting to shake off Ao Qian’s pestering.

Ao Qian gave a cold laugh and said, “Want to run? How can it be that easy?”

He Dajiang’s move was earthshaking. But Ao Qian was a character who had already become incredibly cunning with age, how could he let He Dajiang go so easily?

He Dajiang’s move was unleashed, but his expression changed drastically.

“You ... When did you?!”

He Dajiang discovered that Ao Qian’s divine king domain actually already corroded his divine king domain imperceptibly, utterly sticking onto him.

Ao Qian laughed loudly and said, “Brat, when your Grandpa Ao was playing with divine king domains, your grandfather wasn’t even born yet! Dragon Prancing the Four Seas is hailed as the dragon clan’s strongest domain. With the likes of you, you also dare to play with your Grandpa Ao? Watch closely, Maelstrom Garroter!”

At this instant, countless miniature vortexes suddenly appeared in the two people’s divine king domains. That terrifying garroting power actually ground He Dajiang’s blade lights into smithereens.

“Puhwark ...”

He Dajiang immediately sprayed out a mouthful of blood, the wound on his chest deep enough to see bones!

When everyone saw this scene, they were all struck dumb with amazement.

He Dajiang suppressed Ao Qian all-round, not giving him even a hint of a chance to catch his breath. He did not think that in the end, Ao Qian actually directly finished him off, akin to the weak overcoming the strong.

“Brother He! Are you alright?”

Wu Yuanqiao cried out in alarm and immediately shook off Shu Yunqing, heading over to support He Dajiang.

Wu Yuanqiao was not someone loyal to friends. But at this time, he also knew that the three of them were ants on a rope.

He Dajiang waved his hand and said, “W-Won’t die!”

His injuries looked terrifying but did not harm the foundation. He hurriedly fished out a medicinal pill and swallowed. The injuries on his body healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

But his aura compared to just now was weakened by a great deal.

Ye Yuan also looked at Ao Qian very astonishedly and said, “Nicely done, Old Ao! Your title of dragon clan’s number one powerhouse really isn’t for show!”

Ao Qian laughed loudly and said, “Haha, isn’t this still all thanks to Your Excellency bestowing pills? This battle today, Old Ao, I, finally vented this vexation in my chest!”

Ao Qian was really endlessly grateful towards Ye Yuan. Without Ye Yuan, he would not even be able to get out of the White Tiger Dungeon, let alone talk about having a great battle with the current Divine Realm’s apex powerhouses.

The dragon race was a proud race. Ao Qian was even the best of them among this race. The grievance in his heart these few years could be imagined.

This period of time, he watched Jiang Taicang and Wu Luo, the two of them successively breaking through to the realm of Void Mystic, his heart was long itching unbearably already.

And this battle, he did indeed fight to his heart’s content, unleashing his understanding towards divine king domains to the limits.

Just as he said, when he was playing with divine king domains, He Dajiang’s grandfather wasn’t even born yet!

Him being able to overcome the strong as the weak today was absolutely not by accident, but a true manifestation of his strength!

Ye Yuan said with a laugh, “Medicinal pills can’t increase your strength 1 . Being able to defeat He Dajiang from the standpoint of the weak, this is your capability! Looks like I’ve underestimated the title of the dragon race’s number one powerhouse!”

What Ye Yuan said were heartfelt words. Regardless of whether it was Ao Duo or Ao Yong, Ye Yuan somewhat looked down on them both. But today, Ao Qian blew his mind.
