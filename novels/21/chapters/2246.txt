Chapter 2250: Can’t Escape!

“Hiss ... A rank seven end spirit divine pill!”

Riverword could not help drawing a cold breath of air when he received the medicinal pill.

A rank seven end spirit divine pill, it was still his first time seeing.

This medicinal pill was too precious!

“Little Friend Ye, c-could you be the Medicine Ancestor’s disciple?” Riverword asked carefully.

The more he thought, the more he felt that it was possible.

Ye Yuan actually did not care about the Limitless God Killing Bow at all and was proficient in medicine, and then he took out that end spirit divine pill!

Young of age and he already reached the Empyrean Realm.

Apart from the Medicine Ancestor’s disciple, who else had such ability?

However, he did not think that Ye Yuan had the ability to refine end spirit divine pills. It must have been given by the family’s elders.

But Ye Yuan was taken aback and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Medicine Ancestor’s disciple? Huhu, he’s probably thinking of how to get rid of me currently, right?”

It was Riverword’s turn to be stunned this time. These words sounded like it was somewhat angry!

Not that Riverword was ignorant and ill-informed, but that his level was too high, so he had not heard of Ye Yuan’s name before.

Moreover, these few years, he had been searching for lucky chances outside to transcend the tribulation all along. He never heard about the Southern Border’s affairs at all.

Otherwise, anybody else would have long guessed Ye Yuan’s identity.

“Not the Medicine Ancestor’s disciple? Then you ...” Riverword said hesitantly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You can think of me as his future enemy.”

‘Ask Not’ two words revealed the Medicine Ancestor’s personality.

Ye Yuan knew that one day in the future, he would surely clash with the Medicine Ancestor.

The corners of Riverword’s mouth twitched slightly, feeling that Ye Yuan was somewhat boasting.

The Medicine Ancestor could be said to be a god-like existence in the Heavenspan World.

His Alchemy Dao was invincible!

Which genius did not set him as the goal? But in the end, they were all not his match.

Of course, Ye Yuan was no exception either.

Riverword laughed dryly twice and said, “Huhu, many thanks for Little Friend Ye’s life-saving grace.”

Ye Yuan naturally saw through Riverword’s disbelief, but he also could not be bothered to explain. Right at this time, his expression changed wildly, bringing Riverword and Wild Blade, and teleporting away from the cave.

... ...

Slightly earlier.

Heavenly Eye three people followed Ye Yuan’s tracks and finally found the place where Ye Yuan was hiding.

“Hold on!” Heavenly Eye suddenly said.

Shui Yuan two people immediately stopped.

Heavenly Eye chuckled and said, “It’s all restrictions everywhere in the void here. As long as you touch it, that boy will know!”

Shui Yuan said without a care, “Know then know. A mere Empyrean, can he still run away?”

Heavenly Eye secretly cursed the fool and said, “This brat could bring that person away in such a short time and even lay down such an ingenious array formation. Don’t you find it strange?”

Shui Yuan two people’s hearts thumped. Only then knowing that they were reckless.

For ordinary Empyreans, it was completely impossible to do so many things within such a short time.

Unless he had special means!

“This ... How did he do it?” Shui Yuan said.

Heavenly Eye cursed fool again and said, “If my conjectures are right, he must be adept in spatial law! From the distance of his teleportation, his spatial law has at least already reached peak rank six!”

Shui Yuan two people exchanged glances and could not help feeling secretly shocked. This kind of spatial law attainment, one teleport would be several hundreds of thousands of miles.

With their Deva Realm speed, wanting to catch up would be rather troublesome too. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Fortunately we invited Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye to take action this time. Otherwise, the two of us will really find ourselves at a loss!” Shui Yuan quietly sent a compliment over.

Heavenly Eye smiled coldly and said, “Now, do you all still feel that it’s worth this price or not?”

The two people each nodded their heads in acknowledgment, being whole-heartedly convinced.

“Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye, this time, it’s all thanks to you for taking action.”

Heavenly Eye looked at the restrictions in front of him and said with a cold smile, “This kid probably never would have thought that this emperor is a formation path expert too! How can this bit of restrictions stump me?”

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s cultivation was all on the three eyes.

Especially the third eye, it could see through the fabricated, prying right at the source.

And this advantage of his, cultivating Formation Dao would also yield twice the results with half the effort.

By relying on Formation Dao and ocular arts, he even cleared the first blight tribulation, achieving Deva Realm!

Ye Yuan was currently still unaware that Shui Yuan actually invited this major power, and was completely oblivious that danger was currently closing in.

Heavenly Eye inspected the restrictions carefully and discovered that it was just some simple prompting restrictions, and could not help having a disdainful look.

It was only to see him move like lightning, pointing one finger out after another. A restriction that Ye Yuan set up fell apart quietly.

Shui Yuan two people were by the side, exclaiming in wonder again.

Heavenly Eye was currently being pleased with himself when suddenly, his expression changed wildly.

In the void, countless restrictions lit up at the same time, akin to a huge continuous row of lights, presenting a splendid sight!

“Damn it! This is an interlinked restriction, as long as one is broken, the other restrictions will trigger at the same time! This brat is so scheming!” Heavenly Eye thumped his chest and stomped his feet.

Of course, he still had some things that he did not say.

Ye Yuan’s interlinked restrictions were set up extremely covertly. He did not discover it at all!

In this aspect, Ye Yuan already beat him.

Losing to an Empyrean Realm brat, Heavenly Eye naturally felt a loss of face.

Shui Yuan two people had strange expressions. If they had long known it would be like this, might as well charge straight in.

Right at this time, there was a subtle undulation in space, making the three people’s faces suddenly change.

“Spatial node technique! What a cunning brat, chase!” Shui Yuan did not say another word, directly shuttling into the void.

The other two people did not hesitate in the slightest too, chasing right after.

On the other side, Ye Yuan cast the spatial node technique and instantly escaped a million miles away.

Taking the preemptive strike, the chances of escaping for his life would greatly increase.

Ever since deciding to rescue Riverword, he knew that who he would face would be Deva Realm powerhouses, and was naturally also a little more cautious.

Even though he did not feel that Shui Yuan could find him, he was still extra careful.

The interlinked array formations outside were perfected by him finding some time these few days.

In addition, he even flew a million miles away and left behind quite a few spatial nodes, in case of unexpected needs.

He did not want to be encircled and suppressed by Deva Realm powerhouses.

He did not expect that it was really put to use.

This unforeseen turn of events made Riverword stunned.

Following that was shock.

This Empyrean Realm brat in front of him, his mind was really hair-raisingly meticulous, actually leaving behind so many contingencies.

If not for Ye Yuan being incredibly careful, they would already be three dead people now.

Ye Yuan saved him again.

“So fast!”

Three powerful to the extreme auras arrived from behind with a whistle.

Three powerful to the extreme divine senses already completely locked onto him!

There was nowhere to run even if he wanted to anymore.

Ye Yuan felt the might of Deva Realm powerhouses once again!

It was still his first time meeting someone who could contend with him in terms of speed.

Riverword smiled bitterly and said, “Deva Realm powerhouses already came into contact with Heavenly Dao source. Their comprehension in spatial law is many times stronger than Heavenly Emperors’! Their spatial law might not be as strong as yours, but just in terms of speed, it’s still a notch faster than you! We ... can’t run away anymore!”

Those that came into contact with the source of Heavenly Dao were all extremely powerful existences.

Just like Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao source, the might was exceedingly formidable, and could even kill Daymeld that kind of existence!

Deva Realm’s strength was powerful until it made people despair like that.
