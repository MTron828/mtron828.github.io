Chapter 1727 Complicated and Confusing Destiny

In front of Ye Yuan, one name after another gradually lit up.

The Tai Ji diagram glimmered and faded indeterminately, Yin Yang coexisting, revealing waves of the aura of Great Dao.

Yue Mengli’s name actually emerged from the paper, and then was brought into the vortex by the Tai Ji diagram’s stream of light.

In the end, Yue Mengli’s name broke down, turning into motes of starlight, merging into the stream of light.

“Puhwark!”

Suddenly, Jian Hongxiao tasted sweetness in his throat and spewed out a mouthful of blood mist, his entire person’s aura instantly withering considerably.

“Senior!” Ye Yuan turned pale with fright and shouted.

Jian Hongxiao waved his hand and said, “I’m fine, continue!”

Only to see him forcefully urge the Profound Spirit Chaos Formula, making the Tai Ji diagram revolve once again.

Ye Yuan’s expression flickered several times. Taking a deep breath, he continued to silently read the few names.

Following that, the other few people’s names were also the same, finally merging into the Tai Ji diagram.

During which, Jian Hongxiao vomited several large mouthfuls of blood in a row, seemingly aging many years all of a sudden.

Ye Yuan could naturally tell that Jian Hongxiao suffered Heavenly Dao’s backlash, his longevity was bound to be greatly damaged.

He secretly resolved his heart that when his strength was attained in the future, he would definitely help Jian Hongxiao return to his prime.

The light dissipated, Jian Hongxiao’s divination finally ended.

Ye Yuan hurriedly went over to help him up and said with concern, “Senior ... are ... are you alright?”

Jian Hongxiao forcefully plucked his spirits up and said with a smile, “I’m fine, I won’t die. Just divining a few names actually made this old man lose several tens of thousands of years of longevity. Heh heh, if I divined your fate, this old man will probably immediately vomit blood and die. Emperor surmounting aura is truly terrifying!”

Jian Hongxiao’s Profound Dao attainments were exceedingly formidable. He had always been extremely confident in his own Profound Dao strength too.

But did not expect that this time, it was just divining the whereabouts of a few people around Ye Yuan and he suffered such backlash.

The deduction this time, he even deliberately isolated Ye Yuan’s aura and attempted to divine from other aspects, but the result was still so tragic.

Jian Hongxiao could not imagine what the consequences would be if he directly divined Ye Yuan’s fate.

Emperor surmounting aura, what they shouldered was heaven-shocking destiny! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He could not withstand it!

Ye Yuan helped Jian Hongxiao onto the futon to sit down. Jian Hongxiao sized Ye Yuan up and suddenly said, “This old man is really curious just what Little Friend’s fate will be like. It’s just too bad that my strength is insufficient! Most likely, the one who can divine your fate is only the progenitor himself!”

To the Jian Family’s members, seeing someone with heaven-defying destiny was like Ye Yuan discovering a new kind of medicinal pill.

That sort of curiosity was simply hard to suppress.

Otherwise, Jian Ping also would not go and look at Ye Yuan’s destiny because of a momentary curiosity back then.

It was a pity that Ye Yuan’s destiny was too strong, even Jian Hongxiao could not divine it too.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s divinations, one must approach the subject in a roundabout manner.

And this kind of difficulty, ordinary people could not imagine it at all.

Only Jian Hongxiao, this kind of powerhouse, had such strength.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Hope that one day, I can witness Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s divination arts!”

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “Your words might really come true one day. This old man divined just now, your destiny is absolutely not simple. Even among emperor surmounting auras, it’s also an extremely high-level existence!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and asked somewhat nervously, “Senior, wonder if ... there was any result?”

Jian Hongxiao looked at Ye Yuan and said helplessly, “Have, but also not considered have. This old man already exhausted all my means, but I can only sense a little bit vaguely.”

Ye Yuan’s heart turned slightly cold and he said, “Senior, please say.”

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “You don’t have to be so nervous either. Looking at it now, the four of them are at least all still alive.”

One sentence made a boulder in Ye Yuan’s heart landed on the ground.

As long as the people were okay, everything was fine.

What he was most worried about was the worst situation happening.

Ye Yuan took a deep breath and said, “Senior, please clarify.”

Jian Hongxiao nodded and said, “Just looking at what the divination shows, this girl called Yue Mengli is similarly shielded by heaven’s secrets, this old man can’t see through.”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed slightly and he asked, “What does this mean, Senior?”

Jian Hongxiao said, “This old man judged that there might be several situations. The first one, that girlie obtained some kind of lucky chance, changing her fate heaven-defyingly, and her destiny is no longer what it was before. So heaven’s secrets are shielded. As for the second one ... it’s that someone deliberately concealed the aura on her body, making you unable to start finding. Of course, it’s also possible that she’s trapped inside some mystic realm and that mystic realm can conceal heaven’s secrets.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. If it was the first situation, it was still fine. But if it was the second and third kind of situation, that would be hard to say.

Heaven’s secrets were shielded, even Jian Hongxiao could not do anything too.

Even if Ye Yuan wanted to find, he would not know where to start as well.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan felt his head swell up.

The current situation completely surpassed his expectations.

In the past, he always had a plan ready to deal with situations. But this time, he really somewhat panicked.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Jian Hongxiao continued, “Even though I’m unable to detect her situation, when I was deducing earlier, this old man faintly senses that your fate has yet to end, and will come a time when you meet again!”

Hearing this, Ye Yuan finally heaved a sigh in relief and said, “Senior, then the rest?”

Jian Hongxiao said, “That primordial spirit, this old man deduced that he should be in a land of fire spirits currently. Presumably, it should be beneficial to him. Also, that girlie called Lu-er should be fine as well. Rather, this White Light, this old man sensed a hint of ill-omen, his current situation likely isn’t good.”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed and he said, “What’s wrong with White Light?”

Jian Hongxiao shook his head and said, “Don’t know, this is already this old man’s limits. This old man can’t divine an additional trace of information too! However, this old man can deduce that he should currently be in the Demon Divine Region.”

Ye Yuan’s face turned slightly grim and he said, “Looks like I have to make a trip to the Demon Divine Region! Senior, can you be a little more precise?”

Jian Hongxiao smiled bitterly and said, “This old man knows that the Demon Divine Region is extremely big, but, this is already this old man’s limits.”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said, “I got it!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan slowly got up, bowed toward Jian Hongxiao, and said, “Senior’s grace, Ye Yuan engraves it in my heart! In the future, I’ll definitely repay immensely!”

Jian Hongxiao waved his hand and said with a bitter smile, “Looks like ... this old man overestimated my own strength! The things deduced currently are far fewer than what this old man expected previously. It’s good that you don’t mind.”

Ye Yuan said, “How can this junior dare? Senior’s divination is already of tremendous help to Junior. At least, Junior has a direction now. Furthermore, Ye Yuan knows that Senior’s losses likely can’t be made up for within a thousand years. The next Hundred Battles Arena will likely have to be postponed again.”

Jian Hongxiao’s losses were clearly even greater than expected.

He was currently very weak. It was likely hard to recover in a thousand years.

Looking at this, in order to help him this time, Jian Hongxiao expended a tremendous price.
