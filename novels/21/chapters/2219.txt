Chapter 2223: Very Superficial

Empyrean Cloudburst became more and more alarmed!

At this point, if he still could not perceive Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao strength, then he would be a fool.

Ye Yuan’s every stride stepped on a formation eye.

As long as it was on a formation eye, no matter how he urged the array formation, he could not harm the other party.

But the crux was that wanting to find every formation eye was far too difficult!

Rank eight divine rank array formation was eternally changing, akin to a world evolving.

The complexity involved, ordinary martial artists could not gauge it at all.

But Ye Yuan only took one glance and understood?

Cold sweat poured profusely out of Empyrean Cloudburst’s back. He was scared by Ye Yuan.

This guy was Lord Jiu Shang’s enemy?

Just what kind of a freak did Lord Jiu Shang provoke?

“Humph! So what even if you can crack the formation? A mere middle-stage Empyrean Realm, could it be that our Jiu Shang Bodhidharma is still scared of you?”

Empyrean Cloudburst laughed coldly and transmitted his voice through the array formation. He said, “All Empyreans head for the mountain pass gates and gather!”

The voice was like thunder, spreading to every corner of Jiu Shang Bodhidharma.

For some time, more than ten black shadows sped like the wind, flying towards the mountain gates.

When they saw the Ye Yuan above the void, each and every one of them was shocked speechless.

A mighty rank eight divine rank grand array actually could not stop an Empyrean?

“All of you prepare well. Once this punk successfully breaks through, you all will encircle and finish him off!” Empyrean Cloudburst said coldly.

The moment the other Empyreans saw Ye Yuan’s realm, they could not help revealing disdainful looks.

“Cloudburst, you’re also kicking up too much of a fuss over nothing! A mere middle-stage Empyrean Realm scared you until like this?”

“Yeah! You alone are sufficient too, right? Call us over for what?”

Empyrean Cloudburst frowned and said, “This brat is a little mysterious! Right now, Lord Jiu Shang is seriously injured and hasn’t recovered. It’s better to be safe and make provisions for contingencies!”

Hearing Empyrean Cloudburst said so, the others could only shut their mouths.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan was actually able to rush the rank eight divine rank grand array. They were also indeed extremely surprised.

Inside the grand array, Ye Yuan advanced unhurriedly. It was as if strolling idly in a courtyard.

Half a day later, Ye Yuan finally walked to the end of the grand array.

The final formation eye!

Empyrean Cloudburst’s gaze turned sharp, and he said with a cold cry, “Everybody, prepare!”

More than a dozen Empyreans also had solemn faces, all accumulating power, awaiting release, planning on giving Ye Yuan a lethal blow after he broke through the array formation.

Ye Yuan stood still and took out another divine essence stone, and pointed at the void.

Rumble!

Suddenly, the entire Jiu Shang Bodhidharma started shaking violently, as if there was an earthquake.

Crack ...

Crack, crack, crack ...

Above the void, one fine fissure after another actually appeared on the Black Goblet Sly Fiend Formation.

The fissures grew longer and longer, larger and larger.

Empyrean Cloudburst’s eyes were full of shock. He was already unable to control the array formation!

The rank eight divine rank grand array ... collapsed!

Back then, Heavenly Emperor Moji spent several hundred years of time in order to set up this grand array.

But now, it crumbled apart in an instant.

For a moment, there was flying sand and rolling pebbles, hills toppling and the earth quaking.

The entire Jiu Shang Bodhidharma fell into chaos. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Empyrean Cloudburst looked at that frail figure above the void blankly, a look of astonishment on his face.

A Seven-star Formation God cracked a rank eight divine rank grand array?

This world was too crazy!

One had to know, passing through a grand array and destroying a grand array, these were two totally different concepts.

A rank eight divine rank grand array, each formation eye was interlinked with each formation eye, forming a perfect ensemble.

The grand array operated, without rest.

Wanting to find a hint of flaw from hundreds of millions of pieces of information, and to destroy it, this was absolutely not the work of a single day!

Furthermore, destroying the formation was a hundred times, a thousand times harder than setting up the formation!

But Ye Yuan only walked one round in the grand array and wrecked it?

He, Empyrean Cloudburst, spent more than 100 thousand years just in order to control this array formation!

Was this fellow still human?

“You ... How did you do it?” Empyrean Cloudburst muttered.

Ye Yuan looked down at Empyrean Cloudburst and said coolly, “Those who find it hard don’t know; those who know won’t find it hard. This array formation is very superficial. Cracking it isn’t difficult.”

“S-Superficial?” Empyrean Cloudburst smiled bitterly. He felt that his brain was not quite sufficient to use.

He was truly unable to imagine that a rank eight divine rank array formation would one day actually be described as superficial by someone!

Rank eight!

The rank of Heavenly Emperor!

No matter which Dao, as long as it reached rank eight, it already scaled the mountain and looked down upon the world!

Formation Dao, Alchemy Dao, Talisman Dao, Sword Dao, so on and so forth, without exception.

And reaching this rank was as hard as ascending to the heavens regardless of which Dao.

Just like when Empyreans broke through to Heavenly Emperor, the difficulty involved made people despair!

Formation Dao entering rank eight was Heavenly Emperor level array formation.

Now, it was actually said to be superficial by someone!

How aggravating!

But Empyrean Cloudburst also had no choice to admit that Ye Yuan had the qualifications to say this sentence.

Along the way, Ye Yuan did not need the slightest effort when rushing the formation.

Saying that it was superficial ... did not seem to have any issue.

These several decades of amnesia had huge significance to Ye Yuan.

His understanding of Alchemy Dao and Formation Dao already transcended the appearance, and he glimpsed right at the source!

The rank eight divine rank array formation that seemed gigantic was merely constituted out of one small array formation after another in Ye Yuan’s eyes.

No matter how powerful the array formation, it could not escape this scope.

Just like solving a mathematical problem, one could have several kinds, even several dozens of simple algorithms.

However, when encountering a truly complex problem, one would discover that these simple algorithms were all not useful anymore.

And at this time, the most basic calculation method became an omnipotent calculation method!

No matter how complex the mathematics problem, it could not break away from the scope of basic calculation methods!

Therefore, was there any meaning to researching one plus one equals two?

The significance was too great!

Alchemy Dao was like so, and Formation Dao was also like that.

Rank eight divine rank array formations were strong, but in Ye Yuan’s eyes, it was merely a pile of matchstick frames.

He took out a few pieces of matchsticks and the frame fell apart.

Just that simple!

It was just that these things, even if he said for Empyrean Cloudburst to hear, the latter also would not understand them.

Those dozen over Empyreans stood there in a daze and did not know what they should do for a moment.

They mustered everything up to kill Ye Yuan, but all of a sudden, the house collapsed!

Now, the entire Jiu Shang Bodhidharma was exposed.

But there were ... several dozen human Empyreans outside!

“Hahaha ... truly broadened my horizons! Rank eight divine essence array formation collapsed in an instant! Younger Brother Ye, your Formation Dao strength is probably already not beneath your Alchemy Dao!” Empyrean Chaoyuan recovered from the shock first and said with a big laugh.

“An Empyrean cracking a rank eight divine rank array formation, truly remarkable! Incredible!”

“Master Ye is well-deserving of being the Southern Border’s number one person, cracking a Heavenly Emperor formation leisurely! Formidable! Domineering!”

The human Empyreans all started exclaiming with admiration from the bottom of their hearts. Today, they really broadened their horizons.

Empyrean Cloudburst’s expression was incomparably ugly. But now that it came to this, he could only toughen his scalp and said, “This human brother, this place is Jiu Shang Bodhidharma. This is Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s territory. You ruined our mountain protecting grand array, aren’t you afraid of Lord Heavenly Emperor taking revenge?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a cold smile, “Stop borrowing the majesty of a tiger! That dog was severely wounded by me and won’t recover so fast! Make him come out and die for me!”
