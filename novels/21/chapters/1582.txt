1586 Brutal Devastation!

Competing for the qualifications to enter the Pill Tower, no one would slack off at this time.

Everyone would go all out. Those whose power were lacking, they unleashed all of their abilities, their faces flushing red.

This kind of tangled warfare, the requirement on fire control was exceedingly high.

If the flame was big, one would become a common target for all. If the flame was small, one’s offensive would be insufficient as well.

At the same time, one also had to control the flame to carry out all kinds of evasive actions.

It could be said as multitasking.

To alchemists, this was indeed an excellent way to test fire control.

However, Song Qiyang ran amuck, his divine fire transformed to become an enormous dragon. Apart from his own people, he would kill whoever he saw, virtually having none who could last one exchange with him.

This was their own battle, as well as the fight between the elders.

The more enemies he exterminated, that was winning more spots for his side.

This fire competition based the rankings on the order of elimination. The last one remaining was the first place.

Hence, as long as one was the 100th to be eliminated, they could ensure that they would enter the next round.

At this time, the virtual images transformed from all kinds of divine fires in the battlefield crisscrossed, the battle situation incomparably tragic.

However, when everyone saw Song Qiyang’s divine fire, they clamored to avoid it.

In a twinkle, Song Qiyang slaughtered over ten people, akin to being in the Selfless Realm.

His fire controlling arts indeed stood head and shoulders above the pack. The moment experts saw this, they knew that he stood out among the rest.

Head Elder stroked his beard and smiled on the grandstands, clearly very satisfied with Song Qiyang.

“Head Elder, Qiyang that boy is really promising! This Darksky Dragon Art is already a consummate work of art!” an elder said, flattering him.

Rou Xu smiled slightly and said, “Huhu, this boy, it’s still early! He’s still 108,000 miles away from my requirement!”

That elder smiled and said, “Head Elder is a strict teacher producing outstanding students! Although Qiyang’s Darksky Dragon Art isn’t worth mentioning in our eyes, among Three-star Alchemy Gods, he absolutely can show disdain toward everyone! Among Three-star disciples, cannot find a second existence who can contend with him at all!”

Rou Xu smiled and said, “That’s true. Qiyang’s fire controlling arts is already approaching the level of a Four-star protector. It’s likely very hard for there to be someone who can surpass him among Three-star disciples.”

Heh, a bunch of trash also wants to enter the Pill Tower! Today, I’m going to make the Second Elder’s disciples fail to enter a single one! Song Qiyang sneered coldly in his heart.

Suddenly, his gaze landed on Ning Siyu.

“Heh, I’ll get started with you then, lass! Who asked you to walk so close with that Ye Yuan!”

A hint of smugness flashed across the corners of Song Qiyang’s mouth. Fingers moving slightly, his enormous dragon divine fire pounced toward Ning Siyu’s divine fire.

Ning Siyu’s divine was an exquisite little phoenix. Among those illusions that seemed powerful, it was inconspicuous.

Although it was the shape of a phoenix, it looked just like a small bird, without any aggressiveness at all.

If Song Qiyang did not act against Ning Siyu, there were even many people who did not notice this little phoenix at all.

Ning Siyu’s talent was indeed pretty good, but her age was too young in the end and had yet to fully mature.

The quota to enter the Pill Tower this time, no one would think of her having a chance at all.

Those like Song Qiyang, existences with half a foot already stepped into Four-star Alchemy God, there were still some in the Pill Tower. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Except, these people were not as powerful as Song Qiyang, that was all.

“Mn? Song Qiyang has targeted Ning Siyu that lass? Heh, this boy is also too much of a bully!”

“Heh heh, looks Song Qiyang wants to drive away and exterminate everyone, not giving Second Elder’s students any chance.”

“Want to blame, blame that Elder Ye! Originally, Song Qiyang wouldn’t be so ruthless either. Now, it’s good, he’s angry.”

...

Song Qiyang’s every action was followed with interest. Him acting against Ning Siyu, someone immediately discovered an inkling.

An evil dragon eating a small bird, this result did not seem to have any suspense.

The elders would not think so.

The audience eating melons also would not think so.

Song Qiyang himself would not think so even less.

However, just as the two transmogrified divine fires intersected, everyone was dumbfounded.

“Puhwark!”

That small phoenix was just like a diamond bit drilling into its target, directly piercing through the enormous dragon!

The enormous dragon seemed to have suffered a heavy blow all of a sudden, becoming much more illusionary.

That power also did not seem to be as fierce as before anymore.

Song Qiyang got a shock, his fire controlling art almost going out of control.

The enormous dragon trembled all over and actually had signs of collapsing.

Song Qiyang got a fright and hurriedly stabilized the massive dragon.

However, it was not over yet!

Only to see that small phoenix draw a beautiful arc and turn back once more in a blink of an eye.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

The small phoenix flew back and forth, like drilling holes, riddling Song Qiyang’s enormous dragon full of holes.

“This ... What’s going on here? Why is Ning Siyu’s little phoenix so strong?”

“My eyesight isn’t failing, right? I can’t discern any extraordinary aspect about that little phoenix!”

“F*ck me, things got real now! Song Qiyang wouldn’t be eliminated in the first round, right?”

...

After the astonishment, exclamations sounded out everywhere.

The visual impact that Ning Siyu’s little phoenix gave people was too intense.

It was clearly just an unremarkable little bird, so not a single person expected that it was actually this strong!

The undeniable thing was that it’s small body had immense energy!

Song Qiyang became flustered, his entire person almost falling apart.

At this rate, he would really be eliminated in the first round!

His gaze turned sharp and he revealed a hint of ferociousness, the seals in his hands changing irregularly.

Boom!

The massive dragon directly fell apart!

Ning Siyu laughed coldly and said, “Want to run? How can it be that easy!”

The enormous dragon shattered, but Song Qiyang’s divine fire was not extinguished. It was still in the form of a dragon, but it was smaller.

With his fire controlling art, he naturally would not be finished off so easily.

But now, making him clash head-on with Ning Siyu, he would not do it even if beaten to death!

He only had one thought now, run!

His divine fire’s might was already mostly extinguished by Ning Siyu. Now, there was less than one-third remaining.

This level was already insufficient to support him contending with Ning Siyu head-on.

The astonishment in his heart could not be any greater. He did not understand why Ning Siyu’s fire controlling arts would suddenly become so horrifying.

Song Qiyang did not have time to think about this problem, the seals in his hand were swift to the extreme, condensing those shattered flames together once more, coalescing to become a small dragon. This small dragon was two-thirds smaller than that one previously.

“Puhwark!”

Right then, Ning Siyu’s small phoenix hit that small dragon once more with great speed.

Song Qiyang was going crazy!

No way, I must hold on! If I were to be eliminated in the first round, Master’s face would be utterly lost today! Song Qiyang shouted crazily in his heart.

The divine fire sustaining a heavy hit, the power was already less than half previously.

Repeatedly suffering heavy blows, Song Qiyang’s divine fire already reached the brink of collapse.

He urged that injured small dragon crazily, wanting to avoid the small phoenix’s pursuit.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Several divine fires sped toward the small phoenix. Song Qiyang’s juniors only reacted now, each and every single person coming over to chase and intercept, protecting their senior apprentice brother.

A hint of indiscernible slight smile flashed across the corners of Ning Siyu’s mouth, her hand seals becoming even faster!

The slaughter started once more!
