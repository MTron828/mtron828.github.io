Chapter 1885: He’s Dead for Sure!

“Puhwark!”

One horrifying energy undulation after another impacted Ye Yuan’s divine soul, making his divine soul nearly collapse.

His entire person spewed fresh blood wildly, his innards and divine soul suffering extremely terrifying impacts at the same time. His entire person was already on the brink of death.

This True Fiend Dharma Idol in front of him was far from as massive as Kanuo they all. It was just the size of the average person.

But its appearance made the entire Immortal Grove World quake.

If not for Ye Yuan withstanding the vast majority of the pressure, the Immortal Grove World would have long already been crushed by the impact of this energy ripple.

This was the real True Fiend Dharma Idol!

The True Fiend Dharma Idol that Kanuo they all summoned was merely a tiny smattering.

Especially that this True Fiend Dharma Idol was summoned under the augmentation of a heavenly emperor spirit treasure. Its power was even more terrifying to the extreme.

“Ye Yuan, give up! The exchange of blows between heavenly emperors, you’re completely unable to withstand it!” Dustless said.

But Ye Yuan shook his head stubbornly and said, “O-Once I leave, Father, Senior Fang Tian they all ... will all die! Even if I die, I ... I also need to hold on!”

Dustless had a rare display of roaring at Ye Yuan as he said, “The strike that Immortal Grove prepared five million years ago, its power is unimaginable! Once it collides together with the True Fiend Dharma Idol, it will produce several times, or even several dozen times the energy undulation in an instant! It’s impossible for you to save the Immortal Grove World!”

Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and said, “Not trying ... how will I know!”

At this very moment, Ye Yuan was extremely calm in his heart, his brain revolving like lightning.

Letting him passively watch the Immortal Grove World be destroyed, that was not possible.

Even if there was just a trace of hope, he also had to save the Immortal Grove World!

While on the other side, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang laughed loudly and said, “Could it be that you thought that in these five million years, I’d really do nothing? Even if there’s no way of improving a step further, that doesn’t mean that my strength won’t increase!”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s gaze turned intent and he said in a cold voice, “So what? Receive the power of my finger!”

Finished talking, it was only to see Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove point a finger with one hand. That finger which condensed and formed suddenly crushed over towards Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang.

The places that it passed through, space fragmented and divine essence surged.

Feeling this horrifying power, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s expression also turned white as a sheet.

One had to admit, this big gift that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove prepared for him had indeed exceeded his expectations too much.

Comprehending Dao vestige on his deathbed, just one step away from his fleshy body becoming emperor, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s talent indeed gave him a huge shock.

However, as long as he made it through this move, everything was over.

“True Fiend Dharma Idol, block for me!” Jiu Shang roared.

That black True Fiend Dharma Idol suddenly welcomed that finger under Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s word of command.

Rumble!

That horrifying to the extreme undulation made the shattering space accelerate.

Even with Ye Yuan’s protection, it already could not withstand the undulation anymore!

Just as Dustless said, the energy collision of two great Heavenly Emperor powerhouses would produce several times, even several dozen times the energy undulation.

And this energy undulation, how could Ye Yuan, a mere Celestial Deity Realm, be able to resist it?

For him to be able to hold on until now, it was entirely based on powerful willpower as well as the mysterious divine vestiges.

Except, these still appeared so powerless in front of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

Outside of the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace, the group of Empyrean powerhouses was also anxious and doubtful.

The energy undulation of two great Heavenly Emperors already knocked Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace’s restrictions into a scattered mess.

How could these powerhouses still dare to stay inside? All retreated outside.

Once swept into the battle of two great Heavenly Emperors, that was absolutely certain death.

“This ... This power absolutely surpasses the Empyrean Realm! What in the world is going on?” Zhao Min’s complexion was ashen as he said.

Qiao Yuan and Eymond exchanged a glance, both seeing the look of pleasant surprise from the other’s eyes.

“Hahaha! I really didn’t expect it! Lord Jiu Shang actually came in person!”

Qiao Yuan’s loud laughter made Zhao Min and Qiao Yuan’s faces change drastically.

The Lord Jiu Shang from his mouth, they naturally knew who he was.

“It’s not right! Logically speaking, small worlds can’t withstand the might of Heavenly Emperors at all. Why is this small world still not destroyed yet until now?” Yang Yidao suddenly said.

A small world collapsing was not catastrophic to these people.

Even if swept into a spatial turbulent flow, they still had the ability to protect themselves. So they were not flustered.

It was just that to the people of the Immortal Grove World, there was virtually no hope of surviving.

“There should be someone supporting this small world. It’s just that ... apart from Lord Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, who else can maintain the small world from crumbling under the spell battle of two mighty Heavenly Emperors?” Du Hong also had a look of puzzlement. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this time, Xu Xing who had always been low-profile to the extreme suddenly spoke up, “Could ... Could it be Ye Yuan?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces turned austere.

“Impossible!” Zhao Min’s first reaction was that it was not possible.

This kind of thing went against common sense too much.

“B-But, don’t you all find it strange along the way? Ye Yuan seemed to have become invincible after arriving here! Even Ninth Firmament True Gods aren’t his match. The struggle for all kinds of treasures, he also held the advantage in all respects! Therefore ... he’s likely someone from the Immortal Grove World!” Xu Xing guessed

The surroundings were silent. Everyone was stunned by Xu Xing’s bold conjecture.

It sounded as if it was a fantasy tale. But with Xu Xing saying so, everything became logical instead.

Heavenspan World’s powerhouses arriving at small worlds, they were extremely proud.

Because the so-called geniuses of small worlds were utterly worthless in their eyes.

However, Ye Yuan’s talent crushed all of his peers.

Even a prodigious character like Xu Xing was also crushed until there was not an unscathed patch of skin in front of him.

Therefore, they would not think in this area at all.

But now, with Xu Xing reminding, everyone had a sudden realization.

By the side, Leng Qiuling’s beautiful eyes swiveled around, she was also stunned by Xu Xing’s guess.

Without a doubt, among these people, she walked the closest with Ye Yuan and also understood Ye Yuan the best.

Xu Xing’s conjecture was really extremely likely.

“But, even if he’s this small world’s new controller, with his Celestial Deity Realm strength, how can he possibly support the small world from collapsing?” Du Jong said with a frown.

Everyone exchanged glances, all filled with puzzlement.

The energy impact of two great Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, forget about Celestial Deity Realms, even Empyreans found it hard to withstand too.

“Heh, who cares! No matter how powerful he is, when these two torrents of energy collide, it will also be the day where the Immortal Grove World crumbles! If it’s really Ye Yuan supporting this small world, then he’s ... dead for sure!” Qiao Yuan suddenly laughed.

Two streams of exceedingly powerful energy were currently closing in extremely swiftly.

But right then, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Countless vines burst out from under the ground, tangling over toward the True Fiend Dharma Idol.

The True Fiend Dharma Idol suddenly stopped.

And right at this time, that Heaven Sundering Finger, arrived!

At virtually the same time, Ye Yuan suddenly snapped open both eyes, his eyes shooting out rays of brilliant light!
