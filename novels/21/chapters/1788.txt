Chapter 1792 Shameless Action

“This guy wouldn’t have ... gone to Silkcloud Canyon, right?”Silkcloud Canyon was a very dangerous place in the Shadowmoon Sect. To Divine Lord Realm martial artists, it was equivalent to a forbidden area.

That place had tens of thousands of Blackwater Salamanders!

Those Blackwater Salamanders, the weak ones were rank three, but those of rank four were absolutely no less than thousands.

What was even more frightening was that there was even a rank five existence in there!

Baili Qingyan suddenly remembered that she and Ye Yuan had once gone to the Silkcloud Canyon’s entrance area.

Back then, Ye Yuan wanted to go in to take a look but was stopped by Baili Qingyan.

Thinking about it now, it was only there that Ye Yuan could hunt so many heavenly demon crystals.

Wanting to obtain so many heavenly demon crystals, one must have encountered a beast horde.

Otherwise, even if one hunted day and night, it was also impossible to obtain so many heavenly demon crystals.

Except, once one fell into a beast horde, was there still hope of survival?

Ye Yuan hunted so many Blackwater Salamanders, wouldn’t it alarm the rank five beast king?

For some time, Baili Qingyan was full of questions.

“Wait a minute!” Deacon Hong’s expression suddenly turned dark, and he stopped Qian Ye and said, “How can there possibly be so many? Is there a mistake?”

At this time, a miscellaneous affairs disciples who counted the number hurriedly stepped out of the ranks and said in fear and trepidation: “Replying Deacon Hong, this disciple absolutely didn’t count wrongly. Inside this storage ring, there are a total of 321 pieces of late-stage rank four heavenly demon crystals, 2050 pieces of middle-stage rank four heavenly demon crystal. Converted to late-stage rank four, it’s a total of 526 pieces. Then splitting fifty-fifty between two people, it’s 263 pieces.”

Deacon Hong received Ye Yuan’s storage ring and counted it. Sure enough, there was not a piece more and not a piece less!

But this result made him extremely shocked.

Such a large quantity of heavenly demon crystal, this was unprecedented in the history of the Shadowmoon Sect.

He could not help looking toward Baili Qingyan and asked curiously, “Baili girlie, what’s going on here?”

Baili Qingyan was just about to open her mouth when Jiang Xueyan suddenly cut in, “Deacon Hong, Qingyang encountered a beast horse in the mountains. She fought in a bloody battle for as long as half a month by herself before slaying so many fierce beasts. And her cultivation also had a breakthrough in this battle. I believe that not long after, she’ll be able to reach half-step Celestial Deity.”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s eyelids twitched fiercely including Baili Qingyan.

While in a corner, Ye Yuan was directly overlooked.

No one would think that he, a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, could be of any help.

However, regarding Jiang Xueyan’s shameless action, Ye Yuan did not have much fluctuation.

Firstly, Baili Qingyan blocked in front of him several times, helping him out of his predicament.

Although this kind of help did not have much effect on Ye Yuan, it at least protected him from showing his trump card.

He, Ye Yuan, made clear distinctions between kindness and hatred. This favor, he accepted it!

Secondly, Ye Yuan knew that his words carried little weight. Even if he said it, no one would believe either.

Of course, Qian Ye they all might guess some details, but would they help him speak up?

Obviously not!

As for Jiang Xueyan’s goal of doing this, Ye Yuan also knew in his heart.

She was simply borrowing this to raise Baili Qingyan’s status and overpower the other two lineages, while elevating the Immortal Abode lineage.

Although doing so had no cause for much criticism standing on Jiang Xueyan’s viewpoint, it was a little too shameless.

This kind of magpie-in-dove’s-nest method made Ye Yuan very uncomfortable.

However, Baili Qingyan was very anxious and was just about to speak, but saw Jiang Xueyan turn back with a warning gaze. Baili Qingyan immediately swallowed the words back!

She was very smart, how could she not know Jiang Xueyan’s goal.

It was just that doing so, she had a guilty conscience!

Baili Qingyan could not help looking over in Ye Yuan’s direction but discovered that Ye Yuan was like an old well without ripples, his face not having the least bit of change, as if this had nothing to do with him at all.

But she knew that Ye Yuan must be angry.

Encountering this sort of thing, who would not be angry?

This was not just a matter of reputation, there was also the issue of future benefits.

Geniuses would naturally obtain more resources.

And losing this chance to rise to prominence, Ye Yuan’s road of ascent would undoubtedly be much harder.

As for Qian Ye they all, they also could not help having gloating faces when they heard this.

Ye Yuan suddenly threw out a heavyweight bombshell, catching them off-guard.

If Ye Yuan was paid close attention to by the sect, it would be difficult for them to want to put their hands on Ye Yuan.

In contrast, although Baili Qingyan’s talent was monstrous, it was not monstrous to Ye Yuan’s extent yet.

The talent that Ye Yuan displayed made them feel tremendous pressure.

Choosing the lesser of two evils, Jiang Xueyan doing so was exactly what they wanted.

Deacon Hong had a look of realization when he heard it and said, “So that’s how it is! I didn’t expect that Lass Baili’s strength was actually so strong. This matter, I have to report it to the sect to know.”

As expected, Deacon Hong decided to report this matter to the sect.

Finished talking, he even looked at Ye Yuan rather disdainfully.

This kind of fellow with meager strength actually followed Baili Qingyan and won lying down, getting the strongest battle achievement of the Shadowmoon Sect’s entrance examination, really hit the jackpot.

“Alright, continue reading out the results!” Deacon Hong said coolly.

Qian Ye’s mood instantly became much better. But his vigilance toward Ye Yuan also grew stronger.

Sixth Firmament Divine Lord and he could do it to this step, how dreadful would it be after he grew up in the future?

But he believed that Ye Yuan absolutely could not live long.

He could tell that Jiang Xueyan was not aware of Ye Yuan’s astonishing achievements beforehand.

Her action was equivalent to offending Ye Yuan to the core.

With that kid’s temperament, he absolutely would not walk closely with the Immortal Abode lineage.

In this case, Ye Yuan had offended all three major lineages before even entering the sect.

As well as the Devil Elephant lineage.

The Devil Elephant lineage’s strength was not weak at all.

The results at the back also did not have anything to pay attention to anymore. Everyone was marveling at Baili Qingyan’s strength and lamenting at Ye Yuan’s dog-shit luck.

“Alright, everybody, rest for three days, and enter the second round assessment!” Deacon Hong said in a clear voice.

The moment it ended, Baili Qingyan pulled Jiang Xueyan to one side and complained, “Senior Apprentice Sister, how could you do that? You’re making me unjust and disloyal like this!”

Jiang Xueyan smiled coldly when she heard that and said, “Justice and loyalty? Can justice and loyalty make you become strong? The Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave is about to arrive, you must let your strength become stronger, and have to suppress your opponents ruthlessly. And this kid’s appearance will make the final result very difficult to predict. If he can’t break through to the Celestial Deity Realm, it’s still alright. But if he really breaks through in the 200 plus years? At that time, who can be his match? If not looking on the account of your face, I’d have killed him at the Shadowmoon Mountain Range!”

Baili Qingyan had an indignant look on her face. But when she recalled Master’s great trust toward her and thought of the sect’s ardent hopes, it was seriously hard to choose.

She thought of Ye Yuan again, feeling very depressed in her heart. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Why did he have to swallow his pride and endure in silence, and not argue for himself?

What in the world was this guy thinking?

She desperately wanted to go and apologize to Ye Yuan, but Jiang Xueyan guarded her without leaving a step, making her unable to leave at all.
