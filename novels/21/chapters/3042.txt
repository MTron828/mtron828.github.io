Chapter 3041: Yang Qing’s Highlight Moment!

Kong Tan’s gaze turned cold. He said, “Do you think that this fiend would be scared of a human?”

It was only to see fiendish qi surging on his body, already assuming a posture like he was going to start a killing spree.

Feng Qingxuan’s expression turned dark, and she said, “Kong Tan, don’t you be arrogant! When my man arrives, you’ll suffer!”

Kong Tan’s eyes shrunk once again, and he said, “You’re saying that Yang Qing is your man??Hur hur,?Feng Qingxuan, do you take this fiend to be a fool?”

Feng Qingxuan smiled and said, “You can try starting a fight!”

Kong Tan said disdainfully, “No matter how formidable Yang Qing is, he’s also just one person! Feng Qingxuan, it looks like you’re refusing face when it’s given! Kill for me!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In the end, Feng Qingxuan still failed to intimidate Kong Tan.

The fiend race was bloodthirsty by nature and would not reason things out at all.

If you were stronger than them, only then could you intimidate them.

Boom!

In a blink, the two races clashed.

Kong Tan’s true fiend dharma body was impervious to swords and spears, and invulnerable to water and fire.

Feng Qingxuan’s strength was not weak either, but it was still not enough to suppress Kong Tan.

Moreover, the fiend race had many experts. Kong Tan brought quite a few powerhouses this time.

The true spirit race fell into a disadvantageous situation very soon.

“Yo,?how lively! So many natural treasures, why isn’t there a share for my human race?” Zuo Qingyang said with a light laugh.

“Brother Kong Tan, we’ll lend you guys a helping hand. Give us a share of these natural treasures, alright?” Wang Ningyan said.

Kong Tan laughed loudly and said, “That’s good! I’ll have to trouble Fairy Ningyan!”

Feng Qingxuan’s face turned black, and she gritted her teeth and said, “Wang Ningyan, you dare!”

Wang Ningyan smiled and said, “Why wouldn’t I not dare? Haven’t your true spirit clan always looked down on the human race? We have no need to help you all deal with Brother Kong Tan, right?”

Actually, in the 33 Heavens, all the races had enmity toward the true spirit race.

No reason other than they were too strong!

Back then, the true spirit race was like the noonday sun. One Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven had five mighty Great Beyond powerhouses!

If all the races did not join hands, they would not be the true spirit race’s match at all.

Meanwhile, the human race sought survival between the crevices.

Later, the Labyrinth Divine Palace rose up. Humanity attained unprecedented glory. Only then were they on par with all the races.

How clever was Wang Ningyan? She determined the situation on the field in an instant and decided to join Kong Tan’s side.

The moment Wang Ningyan and the rest made a move, it instantly formed a crushing advantage.

Feng Qingxuan was teetering on her feet under the pincer attacks of several great experts. Very soon, she could not quite hold out anymore.

Right then, another group of people came over. But it was the feather race that arrived.

Yu Ran smiled and said, “Big Brother Kong Tan, do you need Yu Ran’s assistance?”

Kong Tan smiled and said, “It’s naturally for the best if Younger Sister Yu Ran takes action!”

Yu Ran nodded and said, “Alright, the dragon race this bunch of people, leave them to me!”

Finished saying, Yu Ran brought the feather race and joined the battle too.

All at once, the true spirit race was attacked in front and from the rear, suffering a heavy blow.

Many true spirits died under the powerful attacks of the few races.

Feng Qingxuan was going crazy. She did not expect that such a situation would actually occur.

“Why isn’t that damn fellow here yet?” Feng Qingxuan gnashed her teeth in hatred as she said.

She knew that the only one who could save her now was only Ye Yuan.

Otherwise, these elites from the true spirit race would all have to die here.

As if hearing her summoning, a large group of people came from the distance in a dense crowd, immediately applying tremendous pressure on all the races.

At times, numbers could crush everything.

“Finally see people!?Heh heh,?these people will all have to submit under the foot of me, Emperor Azuresky!” Yang Qing immediately became excited.

The destination that this group of people was transported to was a little off. Hence, they came late.

Yang Qing took first place. With his temperament, he naturally could not refrain from posturing.

Ye Yuan had sharp eyes. He saw several races besieging the true spirit race with one glance, and his brows could not help furrowing slightly.

However, Yang Qing already rushed out without waiting for him to speak.

“Hoy!?All-Heavens List, Thousand Souls List, dual lists’ number one, Exalt Azuresky is here! You trash actually dare to bully my, Yang Qing’s, friends! Why haven’t you quickly stopped?!” Yang Qing pointed with his long spear and shouted angrily.

Ye Yuan covered his face with his hand and seriously could not quite continue watching anymore.

This guy liked to show off too much!

Of course, although flamboyant, Yang Qing could still gauge things clearly.

Back then, the true spirit race was the main force that saved the Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Feng Qingxuan was also present back then.

Yang Qing recognized Feng Qingxuan at a glance and naturally knew who he should help.

Moreover, he also knew that Ye Yuan belonged to half a true spirit.

This sentence from him immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

In reality, all of the geniuses right now were full of curiosity toward Yang Qing.

Everyone wanted to know just what this genius who suppressed all the heavens looked like.

But, with one look, they were quite disappointed.

This guy really did not have the air of an expert at all!

Shouldn’t the genius who swept across all the heavens be low-profile and humble and unparalleledly domineering?

This fellow looked like a living treasure no matter how one looked at him!

However, Yang Qing was the peerless genius who cleared the Thousand Souls Hall stage in the end. His face still had to be given.

Wang Ningyan was the first to stop, shouting, “Okay, I’ll give Brother Yang face! Our Purple Extreme Heaven Pavilion will stop!”

Finished saying, the people that she brought all stopped.

Yu Ran also smiled, jumping out of the battlefield as she said, “Brother Yang’s face has to be given. My feather race withdraws!”

The feather race powerhouses stopped respectively too.

When Kong Tan saw the situation, he knew that this fight could not carry on. Snorting coldly, he ceased fighting too.

Only then did the true spirit race powerhouses feel akin to being relieved of a heavy burden.

However, each of them currently had wounds on their bodies. They also lost quite a number of elites that they brought.

Wang Ningyan arrived in front of Yang Qing and greeted with folded hands on the lower right side of her body as she said smilingly, “With the Labyrinth Divine Palace opening this time, Brother Yang’s prestige has awed all the heavens! Since Brother Yang is a human, why not join my Purple Extreme Heaven Pavilion? Our Purple Extreme Heaven Pavilion will definitely do our utmost to help Brother Yang step into the Great Beyond Realm!”

Wang Ningyan had always been proud and cold. Even when facing Zuo Qingyang the few of them, she spoke bluntly too.

But today, she smiled at Yang Qing!

This smile was akin to spring wind blowing for ten miles, intoxicating people.

Even a boor like Kong Tan was also besotted from looking.

In an instant, the air teemed with a strong smell of vinegar.

But, right at this time, Yu Ran smiled sweetly and directly grabbed Yang Qing’s hand, saying coquettishly, “Big Brother Yang Qing, Yu Ran idolizes geniuses the most! Why not Yu Ran become your Dao companions? Yu Ran is the holy daughter of the feather race. As long as Big Brother Yang Qing becomes my Dao companion, there will be countless resources! Also, my ancestor is a Great Beyond powerhouse. If you become my Dao companion, Ancestor will definitely give you guidance!”

Yang Qing instantly became full of himself.

The jealousy grew stronger!

At this time, there were three peerless beauties on the open field.

Wang Ningyan, Yu Ran, and Feng Qingxuan!

These three people had unparalleled beauty and aptitude!

Right now, two out of the three were actually casting an olive branch to Yang Qing.

Also, Feng Qingxuan, Yang Qing personally admitted that he was friends with her!

This kind of treatment really envied bystanders to the max!

Kong Tan looked toward Feng Qingxuan and ridiculed her. He said, “Feng Qingxuan, your man came. Why don’t you have him take revenge for you?”

He had long seen through. Yang Qing did not have that kind of feelings for Feng Qingxuan at all.
