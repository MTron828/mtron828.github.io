“You won’t do!”

A mere three words showed the old man’s disdain and contempt in its entirety.

But to Ye Yuan, it was still his first time hearing someone say these three words to him like this.

Regardless of whether in the Immortal Grove World or in the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan’s talent had always been frighteningly strong.

Even unparalleled talents the likes of Wan Zhen and Pang Zhen were also crushed by Ye Yuan until they could not even raise their heads.

But the old man in front of him actually turned his nose up at him.

“Even if this junior won’t cut it, Senior doesn’t seem to have a better choice either! Because the human race already doesn’t have too much time! Senior Profound Secrets only gave us ten years, which is also 1000 years!” Ye Yuan was indifferent as he said smilingly.

A major power who could offer his life for the human race, Ye Yuan did not believe that he would watch the human race walked towards destruction.

In the Primeval War Realm, what Ye Yuan was using was not his main body. Hence, the old man was unable to determine skeletal age.

In the old man’s eyes, Ye Yuan’s bit of law comprehension was nothing at all.

If he knew that merely a few thousand years had gone by since Ye Yuan cultivated until now, he probably would not think like that anymore.

The old man frowned slightly and said, “The human population numbers more than a billion trillion. Could it be that even a slightly passable genius can’t be found now?”

Ye Yuan smiled and shook his head and said, “I’m afraid that it’s really very hard to find. Senior, why don’t you make do with it for now and let me try?”

The old man heaved a sigh and said, “Profound Secrets that kid is also a disappointment! He studied spacetime law for so many years and merely comprehended 1:100 ratio. Forget it, since you’re in the first place, then let you try it, also so that you’ll give up on it. Go on. As long as you can survive two hours in the spacetime vortex, it will be considered to have made some minor accomplishments! However, that’s impossible.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze could not help looking towards the spacetime vortex.

There, two power of laws were colliding violently, turning spacetime upside down.

In that kind of environment, anything that got swept in would be torn to shreds by the two kinds of power of laws.

Ye Yuan attempted to fire a shot of divine essence into it.

In the end, it was swallowed up without even stirring up a wave.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s expression was slightly austere.

Surviving for two hours in this spacetime vortex was absolutely an extremely difficult thing.

When the old man saw Ye Yuan’s solemn expression, he said smugly, “Kid, you know how formidable it is now? Profound Secrets that brat can only stay inside for an hour! Touch your heart and ask yourself. Do you feel that your talent is even greater than his?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was absolutely the most talented genius since this epoch!

Regarding this point, even Dao Ancestors had no way of denying it.

He was not a Dao Ancestor, but his strength was already not inferior to Dao Ancestors.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Senior, each person’s talent is different. Senior Profound Secrets’ talent lies in divining Heavenly Dao, and not spacetime law. So in spacetime law, it’s already very impressive that he can reach this step.”

The old man chuckled and said, “Then your meaning is that your talent is even above his?”

Ye Yuan also laughed and said, “I don’t dare to say that. So I better try it out then.”

Done talking, he leaped, jumping into the spacetime vortex.

Before his figure even entered the core of the vortex, the tearing sensation brought by the two kinds of laws already made him feel overwhelmed to the extent where he wished that he was dead.

This region of space was not a complete space, but a vortex that was completely ground up by time law and spatial law.

Any object, as long as it entered this region, would be torn into shreds.

People were no exception either.

Ye Yuan just felt as if there were thousands of blades slicing his flesh and blood piece by piece.

Forcefully being sliced into thousands of pieces!

That kind of pain simply could not use words to describe.

In virtually a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan was torn to pieces, deader than dead.

Ye Yuan felt that his grasp of spacetime law was already very deep. But he did not expect that he could not even enter.

This was embarrassing!

Very soon, Ye Yuan’s physical body condensed again.

His face did not have any rosiness at all. That feeling of overwhelming pain to the extent where he wished he was dead was still seemingly happening to him, unable to disperse.

That kind of feeling simply made people despair.

The old man said to Ye Yuan with a big laugh, “Haha, kid, this is the talent that you’re bragging about? Your understanding of spacetime law is too shallow!”

Ye Yuan’s expression became unprecedentedly solemn and he said with a nod, “What senior said is true, looks like my understanding of spacetime law is indeed too superficial! Again!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, leaping into the vortex again.

It was still that agony of being sliced into thousands of pieces. Each blade passed through the nerves, transmitting to every corner of the body.

Too terrifying.

Ye Yuan attempted to mobilize the power of spacetime law to resist this endless slicing.

But everything was futile.

He was still unable to enter the vortex and was directly throttled.

In the second revival, Ye Yuan’s complexion turned a little paler.

That taste of being sliced into thousands of pieces was really unbearable.

The pain of the nirvanic tribulation was already very terrifying.

But compared to this, it was simply like an apprentice in the presence of a mighty sorcerer.

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and came to the edge of the vortex again.

But this time, he did not jump in again.

The old man discovered that Ye Yuan’s entire body was trembling.

That was his body instinctively feeling scared!

In these few thousand years, how many grand battles and how much pain and suffering had Ye Yuan experienced?

He had never been afraid before!

But this time, he got scared.

He did not want to be scared, but his body was very honest!

“Kid, give up! Your strength is too weak! Profound Secrets that brat relied on the powerful cultivation realm of Deva Fifth Blight to survive in the spacetime vortex. Your law comprehension can’t make it, and your cultivation realm also can’t make it. There’s no possibility of comprehending. Do you think that this ancestor is intentionally making things difficult for you?” The old man could not help laughing when he saw Ye Yuan’s appearance.

He naturally knew that Ye Yuan was a present era genius. Being able to enter this supreme inheritance, it was impossible to be a mediocre person.

But he still fell short of his standards.

He was not intentionally making things difficult for Ye Yuan, he was just stating a fact, that was all.

Ye Yuan did not speak, he extended a foot out tremblingly.

A powerful suction force made his body get swept into the vortex involuntarily.

This time, he was passive.

But, due to his body being too scared, he did not have time to even utilize the power of spacetime law this time and was directly eradicated.

When he walked to the edge of the vortex for the fourth time, the trembling of his body became even stronger.

Ye Yuan’s foot was practically shaking.

It could be seen how scared his body was.

However, he still extended a foot out tremblingly and was swept into the vortex by the powerful suction force again.

Then, he was annihilated again.

Just like that, over and over again.

Each time, he would be directly garroted by spacetime law.

But he still jumped into the vortex without hesitation.

The old man’s face gradually turned solemn from the scorn at the beginning.
