Chapter 2208: This Guy Needs Stimulus!

“Young Master? Miss, did you get the wrong person?” Ye Yuan could not help being stunned and said.

Lu-er’s expression changed wildly. Her beautiful body trembled fiercely as she said in puzzlement, “Young Master, I’m Lu-er. You ... You don’t recognize me anymore?”

Over 60 years on tenterhooks, Lu-er’s footprints practically covered everywhere in the Middle Realms. Finally, she saw Ye Yuan today.

Who could have thought that they would fail to recognize each other despite meeting!

What kind of huge blow was this?

Lu-er’s head spun, practically about to faint away.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, trying hard to remember something.

He really could not remember anything, but he kept feeling that he seemed to have been acquainted with Lu-er.

“Miss, you know me? Sorry, I’ve already lost my memories for many years and really can’t remember anything anymore,” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

But A’Xiu’s brows furrowed, having an appearance akin to facing a great enemy.

Could it be that this lady was A’Ning’s lover?

If this was the case ... then wouldn’t she not have any hope at all?

In front of Lu-er’s looks that could topple kingdoms, she really did not have any confidence at all.

“Right! If an accident didn’t happen, how could Young Master possibly not come back and find me?” Lu-er looked at Ye Yuan and said with a painful smile.

“Ye Yuan, you scoundrel! I entrusted Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli to you! Forget that you didn’t bring her out, but now, you actually even forgot your own name and don’t remember anyone anymore? To think that you still repeatedly called for Li-er in the past, you’ve completely forgotten about her now, right?” The man beside Lu-er suddenly flew into a rage.

This man was none other than precisely Lin Changqing!

To talk about this Lin Changqing, he was truly infatuated with Yue Mengli.

Along with the passing of time, there was already no one who thought that Ye Yuan was still alive.

But Lin Changqing did not give up even when there was no news about Yue Mengli.

Hence, he followed along with Lu-er and drifted for over 60 years, searching for Ye Yuan.

The only clue was that the glimpse of golden light back then flew in the east direction.

Hence, the two people followed along the Angry Nether River and went east, searching city by city.

During this, they also obtained many clues before. But in the end, they always returned disappointed.

Hope became increasingly more bleak. Lin Changqing also did not harbor much hope in his heart anymore.

It was Lu-er’s persistence that made them keep on walking until now.

As the saying ‘Heaven rewards the faithful,’ going through all kinds of hardships and difficulties, they finally saw Ye Yuan.

But who knew that it was such a situation.

When Lin Changqing saw Ye Yuan’s appearance, these few years of grievance finally erupted thoroughly.

When Ye Yuan heard ‘Mengli’ two words, his heart ached for no reason.

“Hey! Who are you! To dare shout at A’Ning in Chen Village, do you know where this place is?” A’Xiu immediately blocked in front of Ye Yuan and berated them.

These few years, the people who came to Chen Village were all reverent and respectful. No one dared to shout and wrangle in front of Ye Yuan.

Hence, Chen Village’s people, including A’Xiu, developed the habit of considering themselves superior.

Seeing Lin Changqing flew off the handle, A’Xiu naturally yelled.

“Get lost! It has nothing to do with you here!”

Lin Changqing’s palm pushed lightly. A’Xiu’s entire person immediately flew out.

But he had a sense of propriety when he made his move. Although A’Xiu was injured, it was not serious.

“A’Xiu!” Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, glaring at Lin Changqing after that.

Lin Changqing also looked at Ye Yuan coldly and said with a cold snort, “Since you don’t remember anything, then I’ll beat you until you remember!”

Bang!

A terrifying aura released, the entire house was blasted to ashes.

Everyone in Chen Village was startled and gathered around one after another.

“This ... What a strong aura! What boundary powerhouse is this young man?”

“Could it be ... True God Realm?”

“Sh*t! A’Ning’s strength can still deal with Celestial Deities, but I’m afraid that it’s inadequate to deal with True God Realm powerhouses!”

... ...

Chen Village’s villagers were long already not ignorant people.

They already had a great understanding of this Heavenspan World’s division in cultivation realms.

These few years, they had also seen before many powerhouses, even Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses.

But no one had ever given them such a powerful pressure before.

Within 100 thousand feet, they were practically all unable to stand!

Bang!

Lin Changqing did not say a word, raising his hand. He punched toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was caught off-guard and directly blasted out by that single punch!

“Hahaha, why didn’t you retaliate? Back then, weren’t you very cocky in Fallen Maple Bodhidharma? Didn’t you say that I’m not from the same world as you? What about now? You look at yourself, just like a dog! If it wasn’t for me showing mercy, you’d already be dead just now!” Lin Changqing let out a wild laugh as he said.

Actually, toward Ye Yuan, he was long already wholeheartedly convinced.

Having witnessed Ye Yuan’s methods, he was clear in his heart that it was simply impossible for him and Ye Yuan to be in the same world!

Persisting until today, he just could not feel at ease about Yue Mengli and wanted to seek confirmation about her safety from Ye Yuan’s mouth, that was all.

It was just that he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually became like this.

Ye Yuan slowly got up, his gaze becoming icy-cold.

“Everybody fall back!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

The villagers all had solemn expressions, retreating one after another.

Lin Changqing sneered when he saw the situation and said, “Oh? Angry? You’re just a cripple now. You don’t even have divine essence, while your fleshly body only just recovered 30-40% strength. This bit of strength, still want to deal with this Empyrean?”

Lu-er frowned and said, “Lin Changqing!”

Lin Changqing waved his hand and said nonchalantly, “Relax, I won’t kill this guy! This guy needs a stimulus!”

Lu-er opened her mouth but did not stop it in the end.

Perhaps this could be regarded as a method.

By the side, the villagers were all stricken dumb with amazement!

This empyrean!

Heavenly Empyrean!

Only an Empyrean powerhouse would call themselves this Empyrean!

This young man was actually an Empyrean powerhouse!

Too terrifying.

Even if they were already no longer what they used to be, Empyrean powerhouses were still existences that they were unable to imagine.

Could it be that this Empyrean was actually old acquaintances with A’Ning?

Lin Changqing laughed and said, “Today, this Empyrean is going to trample you underfoot!”

Swoosh! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lin Changqing did not say another word. Raising his hand, it was another punch.

Bang!

The void trembled wildly. This time, Ye Yuan was blasted flying!

On the contrary, it was Lin Changqing who was shocked until he fell back several steps in a row.

His pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Instant array formation! How is it possible? This guy doesn’t even have a trace of divine essence, and yet he can actually perform instant array formation?”

In that instant just now, Ye Yuan laid down an array formation, blocking Lin Changqing’s attack.

Of course, Lin Changqing did not bring out his true strength.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Changqing coldly and said, “Even if you know me, you also can’t bully A’Xiu! This score, I’m going to settle it for her!”

Lin Changqing smiled coldly and said, “So what if bully her? Heh heh, you’re indeed not an ordinary guy! I didn’t expect that in such a predicament already, you still have such strength! Today, this Empyrean wants to see to what extent your instant array formation can achieve!”

Bang!

Lin Changqing’s divine essence erupted, his strength immediately soaring significantly.

“Haha, be careful! This Empyrean is coming!”

Lin Changqing’s aura skyrocketed, directly rushing over toward Ye Yuan.

Such power already reached the True God Realm.

How had the villagers seen before such shocking power? Each and every one of them was shocked until they stared dumbfounded with their mouths agape. They could not help worrying for Ye Yuan.
