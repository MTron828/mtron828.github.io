Chapter 3089: Bloody Battle!

Above the sky, two enormous dragons were crossing swords back and forth, fighting until the void shattered.

Yi Xue transformed into a blood dragon and actually completely suppressed the powerful Mi Tian.

“No one thought that a measly little Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven actually became the toughest bone to bite down! However, it ends here too!” From above the sky came Yi Xue’s voice.

“If you want to swallow Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, you all will have to break a few teeth too! Unparalleled, kill!”

“Hur hur,?the means of Hegemon Space is indeed formidable! It’s just that I don’t know how long Ye Yuan can last inside the Bloodcloud Grand Array!”

Mi Tian’s expression turned dark, and his moves actually had an additional trace of flaw.

Wanting to talk about Mi Tian’s means, it was actually a notch stronger than Yi Xue.

Reaching their realm, it was hard to determine the victor to begin with.

But he had been constantly worried about Ye Yuan’s safety and was unable to focus at all.

The more he wanted to finish off Yi Xue quickly, the more he was being suppressed.

Yi Xue was also making use of precisely Mi Tian’s psych and gradually took the upper hand.

“For my Extreme Medicine Sect, fight to the end without retreating!”

“Blood dogs, Your Father will fight it out with you all!”

......

“Hahaha,?a bunch of dog-like things, too weak!”

An Extreme Medicine Sect disciple killed three bloodkins consecutively, sustaining severe wounds, letting out a wild laugh.

However, several other bloodkins already charged over like the fierce wind.

Bang!

With several bloodkins attacking in unison, the Extreme Medicine Sect disciple who was laughing loudly before lost his life.

Miserable cries lingered incessantly in the Extreme Medicine Sect.

This battle was too miserable!

Facing enemies that numbered several times than theirs, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s elites fought to the death without retreating.

These people were all the genius martial artists that Mi Tian and Ye Yuan groomed. Their strengths were not ordinary.

But there were too many bloodkins!

They could not be killed entirely!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army was founded with the Extreme Medicine Sect as the base, plus the elites of various races.

But now, they were virtually fighting it out with the blood race using their lives!

The price was extremely heavy!

Feng Xiaotian alone was facing off against four great Peak Hegemons and was extremely strained, even though he had already broken through to Peak Hegemon now as well.

One of them was precisely his old adversary of back then, Bloodpromise!

“Blood Extreme Firmament!”

“Fierce Gale Great Melancholy Hand!”

Above the sky, Feng Xiaotian and Bloodpromise exchanged blows.

Bloodpromise’s entire body trembled heavily, and he was directly blasted flying!

Feng Xiaotian raised his head to the sky and laughed loudly as he said, “Bloodpromise, I haven’t seen you for many years, but you’re still same old good-for-nothing! If you didn’t rely on numbers, Your Father would kill you now!”

Bloodpromise was covered all over in blood, and he yelled angrily, “Feng Xiaotian, don’t you be smug! Today will be the day you die!”

Feng Xiaotian did not care and said with a loud laugh, “Bring it on! Want to kill me, you all will have to pay the price too!”

Finished saying, the other three people already rushed in, besieging Feng Xiaotian.

Feng Xiaotian had an awe-inspiring fighting intent and was not the least bit afraid!

“Fight! Fight! Fight! Brothers, this place is the hot soil that we protect! Don’t let it be tainted by these blood dogs! We’ll kill them together until not even a fragment of armor remains!”

Feng Xiaotian gave a long howl and clashed together with the four people.

His fight was naturally not as easy as it looked on the surface.

In reality, he was already seriously wounded now.

It was just that he had been constantly aiming Bloodpromise and bombarding him indiscriminately, completely ignoring the others. Bloodpromise was under great pressure too.

Being beaten down by Feng Xiaotian, Bloodpromise naturally had a stomach full of anger too.

Sure enough, he found an opening, and a Blood Extreme Firmament hit Feng Xiaotian.

Feng Xiaotian felt his scalp tingle. Knowing that he could not avoid it in time anymore, he actually advanced instead of retreating, colliding together with a blood race Hegemon that was coming head-on.

“Wind Thunder Change! Die for me!”

At the critical moment, Feng Xiaotian sent out a move.

His opponent clearly did not expect that Feng Xiaotian was actually so dauntless in the face of death.

Boom!

That blood race Peak Hegemon was actually annihilated by Feng Xiaotian in one move and died thoroughly!

But half of Feng Xiaotian’s body was directly blown away too.

Fresh blood dripped down the corners of his clothes, looking incomparably tragic.

Dyed all over in blood, Feng Xiaotian still laughed loudly and said, “Bloodpromise, you guys are really trash! Four-on-one and you actually still had one killed by me!”

Bloodpromise’s expression was very ugly. Although his move succeeded, he did not expect that they actually lost a Peak Hegemon.

This bunch of Extreme Medicine Sect people, they were all lunatics!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses’ fighting intents were too strong!

Especially Feng Xiaotian, after experiencing the baptism of South Qi Giant City, his willpower was resolute until it scared people.

This injury, if it happened to others, it would have long been a matter of life and death. But Feng Xiaotian did not even furrow his brows!

His fighting intent was still surging!

“Humph!?So what! Feng Xiaotian, this seat will send you on your way now! Your blood will turn into a part of my blood race. You should feel supreme glory!”

… . .

Boom!

Suffering another blow, Ye Yuan’s two eyes went dark, and he was virtually passing out.

Meng Jin was still only using 10% of his strength, but he was already a spent force.

“Hur hur,?the genius whose reputation shocked all the heavens is nothing more than this too! Kid, you’re too weak!” Meng Jin said with a chuckle.

A punk that even Progenitor had to suffer a loss at the hands of, he was being toyed in the palm of his hand. This kind of feeling was very wonderful. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan was panting heavily but forced a smile and said,?“Hur hur,?are you very pleased with yourself right now? Very soon, you’ll regret not killing me right away!”

Meng Jin was indifferent and said with a loud laugh, “On your deathbed, you still dare to threaten this seat? Kid, this seat has only used 10% of my strength up till now! Come, bring forth your strength and make me regret it!”

“Meng Jin, stop playing. Send him on his way!” Chi Shang said.

Meng Jin chuckled and said, “Okay, I’ll send him on his way! This lad is too weak. It’s boring!”

After toying with Ye Yuan for half a day, Ye Yuan did not have the slightest strength to fight back. Meng Jin also found it a little boring already.

Finished saying, he pointed a finger, aiming straight at Ye Yuan.

This finger was more than a magnitude stronger than before!

Ye Yuan only felt that this finger was going to pierce through the firmament, even though he still had not exerted all of his strength!

But right then, Ye Yuan’s body suddenly erupted with seven streams of flowing light!

These seven streams of flowing light were all different colors, akin to a rainbow.

After the flowing light flew out, it actually formed an array formation!

Boom!

The seven streams of flowing light quivered strongly. It was as if it was going to crumble under this finger.

Ye Yuan’s figure also explosively retreated several hundred steps along with the seven streams of flowing light.

But the seven streams of flowing light still stabilized in the end.

Ye Yuan actually received this finger.

Meng Jin’s expression turned dark, immediately feeling a loss of face.

The power of this finger was several times that of before. But it was actually received by Ye Yuan.

The seven streaks of flowing light dispersed and slowly revolved around Ye Yuan.

Focusing one’s eyes to look, it was actually seven small mountains!

Myriad Realms Mountain!

Ye Yuan was indeed pretty lucky in the Labyrinth Divine Palace. He found all seven of the Myriad Realms Mountains in the end.

Ye Yuan made use of the Eternal River’s chaos and completely re-sanctified the seven Myriad Realms Mountains.

The present Myriad Realms Mountain, its power was even stronger than back then in Hegemon Chaos’ hands!

Ye Yuan looked at Meng Jin and said with a sneer, “What rubbish Hegemon! Nothing more than this!”

Meng Jin’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise, “Chaos heavenly treasure! I didn’t expect that this boy actually still had such a trump card! However, this thing is a wanton waste of God’s good gifts in your hands! Since you’re giving this seat a treasure, this seat will accept it!”
