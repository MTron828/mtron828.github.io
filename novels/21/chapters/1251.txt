Chapter 1255: Divine Dao Second-Stage!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Zhuge Qingxuan!”

When the three people saw Zhuge Qingxuan, their expressions could not help changing.

Ye Yuan thought that Zhuge Qingxuan was absolutely not Li Gui’s match. Did not expect that he actually escape from the Soul Refining Sect space.

However ... it seemed like his entire temperament had a very huge transformation.

“Heh, are you very surprised? Didn’t expect that I’d escape from that place, right?”

“Jeje, boy, you’re very decent, to actually know how to murder someone with a borrowed knife! But this seat’s one million years of effort was reduced to naught in a day. This wrath, you’ll have to receive it!”

From the same mouth, two completely different voices actually leaped out, making Ye Yuan trio all greatly astonished.

But Ye Yuan understood very quickly as well. The Soul Refining Sect’s sect master, Li Gui, seemed to have possessed onto Zhuge Qingxuan’s body.

Except, this was different from seizing possession. Zhuge Qingxuan still had his own consciousness.

But the current Zhuge Qingxuan indeed gave him a very dangerous aura.

After the shock, Ye Yuan calmed down very quickly and said with a big laugh, “Hahaha ... The exalted Heaven Stabilizing Divine King actually ended up in such a situation, being neither ghost nor human currently! If let the outside world know, it will probably become a story that will be passed on in the entire Divine Realm, right?”

Zhuge Qingxuan’s face fell. Although he was being spiritually possessed by Li Gui right now, he still retained half of his former personality.

He, this person, valued face the most. Being shot at by Ye Yuan, he was immediately about to flare up.

“Hold your horses! If you don’t even have this bit of restraint, how can you accomplish important matters?” Li Gui urged.

“You shut your mouth for this seat! Whatever nonsense, wait till this seat kills Ye Yuan before talking!” How could Zhuge Qingxuan still listen, cutting him off at once.

“Jeje, without this deity, do you think that you can kill this boy?”

“No need you to take action! Do you think that this seat’s Heaven Stabilizing Divine King name is called in vain?”

“Alright then, alright! This deity won’t intervene! In a while, don’t come and beg for this deity!”

Done talking, Li Gui no longer made a sound, seemingly ceding the body’s control rights.

“Ye Yuan, this time, even if the Jade Emperor comes, he can’t save you either!” Zhuge Qingxuan said fiercely.

But Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “The last time, I wonder who ran away like a dog!”

“Humph! Last time, if not for you engaging in intrigues and schemes, how could this seat possibly lose to you?” Zhuge Qingxuan said disdainfully.

“Only the weak will find excuses for their own failure,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Then, this seat will take a look today, just how strong you are!”

Zhuge Qingxuan laughed coldly and suddenly unleashed a finger!

Profound Qi Finger!

One finger unleashing, the wind and clouds moved!

Ye Yuan’s gaze revealed a look of disdain, and he said with a cold smile, “This move again? Can you come up with something new?”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s Evil Extermination Sword waved. Fury Sword Fire Lotus came out with a whistle, welcoming Zhuge Qingxuan’s Profound Qi Finger.

However, right at this moment, Ye Yuan just felt his chest suffocate, essence energy like it was blocked. This Fury Sword Fire Lotus move actually nearly did not release.

Boom!

How could the half-baked Fury Sword Fire Lotus be the Profound Qi Finger’s match?

Ye Yuan’s chest seemed to have been struck by a tremendous force. Opening his mouth, he spewed out a large mouthful of blood, body flying out backward and smashed ruthlessly on the ground, fresh blood drenching his clothes.

“Big Brother Yuan!”

“Big Brother!”

Li-er and White Light turned pale with fright, not expecting that it would actually be such an outcome.

Ye Yuan struggled to his feet; his internal organs already sustained massive trauma.

Fortunately, he had the Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art and was currently recovering his injuries frenziedly.

“Jeje, the taste of this deity’s Ghostspirit Curse is still not bad, right?” Li Gui said with a strange laugh.

Ye Yuan knew that the problem lay with those two streaks of blood light previously.

He did not sense it before, but circulating essence energy right now, Ye Yuan felt that there were two strange forces plugging up his chest, making his essence energy sluggish.

This kind of feeling was somewhat similar to the six great protectors’ God Corrupting Blood Beads back then. It was just that in terms of power, it was much stronger than that.

This was like planting a curse on Ye Yuan’s body. Even if he utilized the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood, he was also unable to purge it.

As expected, well-worth of being a former peak Heaven Glimpse powerhouse. His means were simply inconceivable.

Except ...

A hint of a mocking smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, making Li Gui’s expression change.

“Ghostspirit Curse, is it? It sounds like it seems to be very impressive. I wonder if ... Gui Li knows how to undo this Ghostspirit Curse or not?” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

A blood-red figure suddenly appeared beside Ye Yuan.

Li Gui’s expression was incomparably ugly. Gnashing his teeth in hatred, he said, “I was wondering why the Myriad Soul Flag disappeared. Turns out that it actually landed in your hands!”

Li Gui personally refined these evil ghosts. He naturally knew these evil ghosts’ prowess.

Ordinary martial artists, even if their cultivation realm was extremely high, wanting to subdue these evil ghosts was also impossible.

He was unable to imagine how Ye Yuan subdued these evil ghosts.

At the thought of his many years of effort becoming a wedding gown for Ye Yuan, Li Gui felt like he was planted with the Ghostspirit Curse, incredibly stifled.

Gui Li did not seem to have seen Li Gui. He called out the other eight evil ghosts and started casting a spell at Ye Yuan.

Those evil ghosts were very clear about Li Gui’s moves. If Li Gui was at his prime, they naturally could not resolve this Ghostspirit Curse.

But now, their strength was sufficient.

“How can it be that easy to want to undo the curse? Heh, this seat will let you take a look at just what kind of strength the Divine Realm’s number one has!”

Zhuge Qingxuan’s expression turned cold, and he pointed a finger out once more.

“Profound Heaven ... Finger!”

Zhuge Qingxuan cried out coldly. The power of this finger was truly unimaginable.

Profound Calamity Finger, Profound Qi Finger, Profound Heaven Finger, these were clearly martial techniques passed down directly from the same lineage inside the Brahma Heart Sutra.

To be able to comprehend to such a degree, the power was truly boundless.

Furthermore, Zhuge Qingxuan even comprehended a Divine Dao domain. With the addition of the domain, his strength was even more terrifyingly powerful.

Ye Yuan’s face fell, and he said, “No wonder you’re so arrogant. Turns out that you comprehended Divine Dao second-stage laws. It’s too bad ... did you think that only you comprehended it?”

Golden light flickered on Ye Yuan’s body. A palm came out with an overwhelming momentum.

Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!

Ye Yuan’s dragon race martial techniques improved amazingly fast. When at the land of exile, under the ancestor’s guidance, he broke through to Divine Dao second-stage in one go!

Deity Realm second-stage laws, what it corresponded to was the Deity Realm power of laws for middle-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm.

Originally, Zhuge Qingxuan and the Spirit Bristle Divine King’s laws comprehensions were on the same level, mostly at the late-stage of Divine Dao first-stage.

No idea what kind of pointers Zhuge Qingxuan received from Kanuo either, his strength actually improved greatly, and already broke through to Divine Dao second-stage.

It was just a shame that Ye Yuan’s laws comprehension was much faster than Zhuge Qingxuan imagined.

The Divine Dao second-stage’s Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm versus the Divine Dao second-stage’s Profound Heaven Finger!

Originally, it should be an attack that was well-matched in strength. But Ye Yuan had the addition of the Nine Transformations Golden Body, sending Zhuge Qingxuan flying out with one palm. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Heh, Divine Realm’s number one, truly shameless enough!” Ye Yuan said disdainfully.
