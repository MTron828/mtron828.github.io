Chapter 1400 Who Was Toyed?

“Did you hear? There’s a fool who actually wants to challenge all of the hundred cities’ geniuses at Howless Ridge!”

“How is it possible to not hear of it? This wouldn’t be news deliberately released by someone, wanting to ambush us halfway, right?”

“Heh, I heard that this fool called Ye Yuan came from Wu Meng Capital City and is just late-stage Grotto Profound.”

“Late-stage Grotto Profound? Why is it more and more nonsensical? For a late-stage Grotto Profound to be able to survive until now is already a miracle. He still has the strength to challenge so many geniuses?”

“No matter what, Howless Ridge must be very lively now already. We’d best go and take a look!”

...

This one month’s time, the news of Ye Yuan putting out the challenge for all outer-court disciples at Howless Ridge spread like wildfire.

Some people dismissed this with a laugh. But some people were still moved by the storage rings in Ye Yuan’s hands.

More and more outer-court disciples were currently rushing to Howless Ridge.

Not long after this group of people left, two silhouettes walked out of the dense forest.

But these two people were Qin Yuanlong and Qin Tian!

Qin Yuanlong tangled with Thundercry for several months and finally found a chance to shake him off.

The two of them rendezvous in this outer-court region. They did not expect that they would hear news about Ye Yuan.

“Humph! This brat is really rampant! He really thinks himself to be invincible under the heavens? He probably doesn’t know that those from powerful capital cities, many disciples all intentionally suppressed their realms to comprehend the power of laws!” Regarding Ye Yuan’s arrogant actions, Qin Tian responded with a cold sneer.

“This punk is indeed arrogant without limit! But this kind of courting death action, we can make use of it,” Qin Yuanlong said with a smile.

“With Uncle around, since we know the whereabouts of that kid, he’s naturally certain to die!” Qin Tian said.

...

The current Howless Ridge had long gathered a large group of students already.

Ye Yuan stood on the mountain, standing with his hands behind his back, with an attitude of standing proudly under the heavens.

By his side, over a dozen figures already surrounded him.

“Sure enough, the first to find Ye Yuan was the Zuo Xiang Capital City’s people!”

“Use your butt to think and you’ll also know! Zuo Xiang Capital City and Wu Meng Capital City are implacable enemies. Each trial, they will eye Wu Meng’s students to kill. This time, there naturally won’t be any exception either.”

“I heard that He Ning is Zuo Xiang’s outer-court’s number one person, an existence with hopes of breaking through to Divine Lord Realm. Him alone is already very hard to deal with, let alone 15 to 16 people!”

“Ye Yuan this fellow is too ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth! He Ning isn’t the strongest. Yong Dang Capital City’s Jin Yu, Chang Jia Capital City’s Qiu Shuisheng, they are the most terrifying existences!”

He Ning was Zuo Xiang Capital City’s outer-court’s number one person. His Sword Dao laws already reached the third level of Sword Dao second-layered heaven, his strength extremely formidable.

But Zuo Xiang Capital City’s might did not lie on He Ning alone.

Those students by his side, each and every one of them, their strengths were not ordinary too.

When he heard that Ye Yuan was Wu Meng Capital City’s disciple, he brought all of Zuo Xiang Capital City’s disciples and rushed over straight away.

Towards Wu Meng Capital City’s disciples, they had never been soft-hearted.

Furthermore, they never paid attention to fighting one-on-one. Want to fight, it was all together!

“Kid, I say, are you brave, or is your brain not working well? Looks like your Wu Meng Capital City’s this season’s top dog is really unbelievably weak, to actually lose at the hands of you, this fool. Haha ...” He Ning said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “So much crap. If you’re not making a move, I’m coming!”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s rushing figure, He Ning said disdainfully, “Just this bit of strength? To dare be so arrogant, I even thought that you can let me enjoy to my heart’s content!”

Facing Ye Yuan’s attack, He Ning did not retreat, but advanced instead, his figure disappearing bizarrely.

At the same time, Zuo Xiang Capital City’s other people also moved.

The reason why Zuo Xiang Capital City was powerful was not just because their students’ strength was powerful, their cooperation was also incredibly close.

The moment these dozen over people made a move, it was akin to one person fighting; incomparably harmonious.

Clank!

He Ning exchanged a sword move with Ye Yuan in a blink, but he was shocked until his arm went numb, his long sword nearly slipping out of his hand!

His expression changed, greatly astonished in his heart!

How could a late-stage Grotto Profound’s casual sword move have such terrifying strength?

Clank! Clank! Clank!

Ye Yuan’s sword emerged like the wind. Under the encirclement of over a dozen people, it came and went freely, without the slightest hint of falling into a disadvantage.

In one exchange, all of Zuo Xiang Capital City’s people fell into immense shock.

He Ning’s expression turned fearful and he said in a solemn voice, “All don’t hide it anymore! Nine Firmament Sword Energy, kill!”

Zuo Xiang Capital City’s group of students cooperated seamlessly. Under He Ning’s command, the within the group battle immediately crisscrossed with sword energy. Rays of terrifying sword energy slashed over toward Ye Yuan.

“Strength isn’t bad! A little interesting!”

Facing the besieging of over a dozen experts, Ye Yuan did not seem to feel taxed. Instead, he appeared to have plenty more to spare.

Zuo Xiang Capital City’s Nine Firmament Sword Energy was indeed very strong. Displaying the move with over a dozen people joining hands, its might was even more unimaginable.

Only such a battle could make Ye Yuan enjoy it.

Those sword after sword of Ye Yuan’s parried seemingly in a careless manner. Actually, each sword contained the sword intent of Sundering Stars inside.

His utilization of Sundering Stars currently was long already not limited to that heaven-shocking chop.

With every movement, releasing and withdrawing as he pleased.

In such a small-scale battle, Ye Yuan practically utilized the sword intent of Sundering Stars to the limits!

It was just that this battle was totally not the case in the view of outsiders.

“He Ning, stop playing! Is it fun to toy with the young man?”

“Haha, you guys have to bring out a bit of strength at any rate. Otherwise, when other people see it, they’ll even think that you guys aren’t a match for a late-stage Grotto Profound!”

“When can your Zuo Xiang Capital City get rid of this bad habit and stop playing cat-and-mouse games?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Among Zuo Xiang Capital City’s students, they could sense the other parties’ positions through the Nine Firmament Sword Energy.

Hench, each trial, they could virtually find their companions the fastest. They would then regroup into a powerful team to crush the opponent.

It was precisely because of so that their overall strength ranked among the best of these hundred cities.

They also frequently surrounded their opponents and not kill, forcing the other party to crush their own jade pendant.

This was a humiliation toward the opponent and also made many weaker capital cities gnash their teeth in hatred.

This point, Wu Meng Capital City’s disciples felt it the most.

But, no matter how furious they were, no one could do anything to Zuo Xiang Capital City either.

Powerful strength was so capricious.

It was just that this time, it was totally not the case.

He Ning knew his own pain. This Ye Yuan was really powerful to the extreme. The more he fought, the more alarmed he became.

This brat cultivated no idea what kind of heretic martial technique. A casual sword move contained tremendous power, capable of easily breaking their Nine Firmament Sword Energy.

This point, outsiders could not tell at all. Only by feeling it personally could one experience it.

It was precisely because of so that it let everyone mistakenly thought that Zuo Xiang Capital City, these guys’ old habit flared up again, deliberately playing with Ye Yuan.

In reality, it was them who were toyed by Ye Yuan!

Clank!

Suddenly, a clear sound transmitted out. The long sword in a Zuo Xiang Capital City’s disciple’s hands was directly shook to fly out.

And Ye Yuan’s next sword move already slashed over like lightning!
