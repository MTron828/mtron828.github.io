Chapter 1910: Awe

Among the arrivals, there was not one True God Realm powerhouse.

In Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, apart from that mysterious pink pig, similarly did not have a True God Realm.

The City Lord Manor doing so already expressed sufficient respect toward Southridge.

Of course, everyone was well aware that actually, that was respect toward Lord Patrolling Inspector Ye Yuan.

“Tsk tsk, those are all the imperial capital’s lords! If not for Lord Ye Yuan, how could they possibly come to our backcountry?”

“I heard that that person talking with lord Ye Yuan is Nine Pledge Imperial Capital City Lord’s son, half-step True God Realm. Even he has to be so polite to our Lord Ye Yuan!”

“Heh, Lord Ye Yuan is really too incredible, even True God powerhouses have to conduct themselves based on his expression!”

...

In the city, bustling streams of people watched Ye Yuan meet with the City Lord Manor’s powerhouses with idolizing expressions on their faces.

Ye Yuan swept a glance at Yu Jinsong who was already all bundled up. He then said coolly, “Looks like City Lord His Excellency is very sincere!”

Ye Yuan understood that this tying up was done for him to see. Yu Jinsong did not have any strength to resist at all.

The restriction that he planted on Yu Jinsong, the City Lord Manor was still unable to dispel it until now!

Ye Yuan’s chaos divine essence was extremely special in the first place. It even mixed in blue divine marks inside. Even if a True God powerhouse wanted to release it, it was absolutely not an easy matter too.

Yu Jinsong’s face no longer had the former pride. It was full of dispiritedness and terror.

Yu Changyun clasped his hands and said, “My younger brother was malicious, resulting in committing a grave mistake. Father ordered me to tie him up and await Lord Patrolling Inspector’s sentencing.”

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “Go to the City Lord Manor before talking.”

Ye Yuan led the party into the City Lord Manor and sat down as host and guest.

Yu Changyun signaled his subordinate with his eyes. The subordinate got the meaning and brought Yu Jinsong to the hall, letting him kneel down in front of Ye Yuan.

“Father said that this boy is too malicious, resulting in offending Lord Patrolling Inspector. Now, we tie him up here; want to kill or dismember is up to you.”

Yu Changyun got up to clasp his hands in salute, his attitude very humble and polite, as if the one kneeling below was not his younger brother.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “With my temperament, even killing him several times isn’t enough. But this incident, I’m not the party involved. Killing him or not, I still need to ask Brother Jiang father and daughter to make a final decision.”

Jiang Jadehall’s entire body trembled, tears pouring out.

Starting from when he was framed and thrown into jail, until escaping with his life now, Jiang Jadehall had never thought that he could personally take revenge.

To him, Yu Jinsong was a figure far removed from the masses.

Wanting to take revenge was far too difficult.

But now, Ye Yuan put the chance in front of his eyes.

He walked toward Yu Jinsong tremblingly, his footsteps carrying a hint of solemness. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He hated Yu Jinsong to the bones, not because of himself, but because of his daughter.

This animal actually sullied Jiang Haitang’s innocence, so how could he get over it?

“Jiang Jadehall, you dare?!” Yu Jinsong sensed the threat of death and roared angrily at Jiang Jadehall.

Jiang Jadehall’s expression changed and he actually came to a standstill.

Before this, he, Jiang Jadehall, had always been an insignificant character.

Even if Yu Jinsong was being tied up, he was also an important person with a deep background.

Jiang Jadehall did not dare about himself. He was afraid that killing Yu Jinsong would bring trouble to Ye Yuan.

If tying Yu Jinsong up and bringing him over was just Yu Wenfeng’s act of giving face, if he really killed, it would definitely incur considerable trouble.

After all, Yu Wenfeng was a middle-stage True God Realm powerhouse. Once all decorum was lost, the land of Southridge would definitely be plunged into misery and suffering.

“Brother Jiang, don’t need to worry about anything. Want to kill or dismember, it is up to you. I can shoulder it!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Hearing this, Yu Jinsong’s expression could not help changing and he roared angrily, “Ye Yuan, you dare to kill me?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile that was not a smile, “You’re merely a sacrificial piece right now, that’s all. Yet you still want to assume the majesty of the tiger? City Lord Yu has not just you, one son. If you died, then you died; so what? If he really wanted to protect you, you also wouldn’t show up here today.”

Yu Jinsong’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “I’m his most outstanding son, he won’t abandon me! If you dare to touch me, he’ll definitely trample Southridge to the ground!”

Ye Yuan laughed when he heard that and said, “I think that you’re mistaken! He didn’t send you here because he didn’t like you, but because he knows that he can’t protect you anymore no matter what! You know, he can’t kill me. But before long, I’ll be able to kill him. You dying and you all dying together, he chose you dying, that’s all.”

The talent that Ye Yuan displayed was too strong. No one would doubt whether he could step into the True God Realm.

Taking action against Ye Yuan now, one they could not kill him, what awaited them would be his future crazed revenge.

The reason why Ye Yuan displayed his talent in front of the three great powerhouses was for the sake of astounding them, making them not dare to act rashly without careful consideration.

Moreover, Heavenly Eagle still had an even more mysterious pink pig.

Therefore, Ye Yuan was not afraid of anything!

Yu Wenfeng could only abandon Yu Jinsong right now to get on friendly terms with Ye Yuan.

If he became enemies with Ye Yuan, then when he grew up in the future, the consequences would be catastrophic.

Ye Yuan’s analysis made Jiang Jadehall’s eyes become bright.

He understood, the present Ye Yuan already had the capital to challenge True God powerhouses.

Even True God powerhouses had to come and butter him up!

Hence, he did not need to fear anything.

Suddenly, Jiang Jadehall pointed like lightning, pointing at Yu Jinsong’s abdomen.

“ARGHH!!”

Yu Jinsong gave a miserable scream, his entire person sent flying out.

The corners of Yu Changyun’s mouth twitched slightly but recovered his calm very quickly.

“M-My cultivation! You ... You crippled my cultivation!” Yu Jinsong roared furiously.

Jiang Jadehall did not look at him. He said to Ye Yuan with cupped fists, “Ye Yuan, Haitang and I thank you! Thank you for giving me the chance to take revenge with my own hands!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Jiang doesn’t need to be like this. The road after today is still long!”

Jiang Jadehall nodded his head solemnly and took his leave.

He did not know how to express his feelings of gratitude. But at this moment, he already made up his mind that this life was Ye Yuan’s!

“Ye Yuan, kill me if you have the guts! Otherwise, you’ll definitely regret it!”Yu Jinsong roared.

Bang!

Ye Yuan flicked his sleeves, directly sending him flying out.

“Noisy! Throw him out of the city for me!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Done with these, only then did Ye Yuan return to his seat and said to Yu Changyun coolly, “City Lord Yu’s generous gift, I’ll accept it. However, this is what he owes me, it’s not considered a favor. If you want to request for medicinal pills, there still needs to be additional compensation.”

The corners of Yu Changyun’s mouth twitched again, rather unhappy in his heart.

If not for Yu Wenfeng repeatedly exhorting before coming, forbidding him from provoking Ye Yuan, he would have long exploded.

Outside all talked about how Ye Yuan was so and so. He did not see it with his own eyes and naturally did not believe it.

But his father said it very seriously, so Yu Changyun did not dare to defy.

Because he did not wish to become a second Yu Jinsong.

“Haha, that’s of course!” Yu Changyun said with a laugh.

“I wonder what medicinal pill Brother Yu is requesting?” Ye Yuan asked.

Mentioning this, Yu Changyun was rather agitated as he said, “These few days, His Excellency racked his brain and finally gathered the spirit medicines required for the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill. We hope that Lord Patrolling Inspector can refine one on our behalf. As for the compensation, it will naturally satisfy you.”
