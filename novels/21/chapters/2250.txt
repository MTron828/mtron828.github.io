Chapter 2254: Growing Stronger With Battle!

With Ye Yuan exterminating Heavenly Emperors with snaps of his finger, those Heavenly Emperors were naturally not willing to show weakness too.

They looked down from a height and had long already gotten the restrictions behind them down to the tips of their fingers. Each and every one of them attempted to trigger the restrictions too.

But Ye Yuan was seemingly like in his own backyard inside the restrictions.

It was only to see him display his skill in a dazzling manner, hitting onto the nodes of the surrounding restrictions, and annihilating all of the attacks.

Following that, he repeatedly snapped his fingers and exterminated another Heavenly Emperor again.

This was the magical battle between restrictions. What it competed in was not cultivation but the understanding of restrictions.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s understanding of the restrictions here far exceeded these Heavenly Emperors!

“Deal with those two people behind him!”

Amidst the chaos, no idea who yelled out. Everyone immediately woke up. Attacks smashed over toward Riverword and Wild Blade that side.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned dark, the speed of his hands accelerating faster. He actually defended against the dozen over Heavenly Emperors’ attacks flawlessly.

When Heavenly Eye saw this scene, his pupils could not help shrinking and he cried out in surprise, “How is this possible? Could it be that this boy came to Eight Void Mountain before in the past? He already understands the restrictions here to a transcendent degree!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Shui Yuan two people had astonished looks on their faces too. Ye Yuan, a measly little Empyrean, actually defended perfectly under the attacks of more than a dozen Eight-star Formation Gods.

“Brother Heavenly Eye! Looks like only you personally taking action can deal with him!” Heavenly Emperor Shui Yuan said.

Heavenly Eye’s face fell and he said, “As long as let this old man enters the range within 100 feet of him, he’ll die beyond a doubt!”

Done talking, the three people went up the steps.

With Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye, this super powerhouse, leading the way, their speed was extremely fast. The distance from Ye Yuan was getting smaller and smaller.

And Ye Yuan’s speed slowed down significantly because of the obstruction of numerous Heavenly Emperors.

Of course, it was primarily still because he had to protect Riverword and Wild Blade two people.

Riverword’s expression was extremely ugly. He was a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor super powerhouse. At present, he actually became a burden to others.

Seeing Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye and the rest getting closer and closer at the back, he became increasingly anxious in his heart.

“Little Friend Ye, many thanks for your protection along the way! Looks like this Limitless God Killing Bow isn’t fated with me. You bring it and continue advancing, don’t care about me anymore!” Riverword gritted his teeth and said.

For Riverword to be able to reach his present realm, he had lived for a trillion years and had experienced no idea how many schemes and deception, conspiring and outwitting.

But such a righteous and loyal person like Ye Yuan, it was still his first time meeting such person in his life.

In this current state, he definitely would not be able to transcend the Deva blight tribulation.

There was already not much difference between dying sooner or later.

Rather than becoming Ye Yuan’s burden, he would rather just die.

“Shut up! Just the likes of these few trash can’t stop me yet! A big grown man is behaving like a girl. Don’t you find it humiliating by threatening to commit suicide? Relax! When I can’t hold on, I’ll throw you out!” Ye Yuan’s hands moved like lightning as he said with a cold yell.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan fired out another few streams of light, blowing up another Heavenly Emperor, making Riverword feel shocked.

This guy was genuinely strong!

Dealing with these Eight-star Formation Gods was actually like chopping vegetables.

If not for the numbers being too many, Ye Yuan would have long rushed forward.

Riverword turned his head to look and could not help drawing a mouthful of cold air.

The speed of Heavenly Eye three people coming up was very fast, they were already merely around 500 feet away from them.

“Whoever can kill this punk, this emperor will award a heavenly emperor spirit treasure plus three Carefree Heavenly Laugh Pills!”

Right then, Heavenly Eye suddenly roared again, the entire Eight Void Mountain could hear it clearly.

Carefree Heavenly Laugh Pill was a rank eight spirit medicine. It was hard to get even with a mountain of gold!

With this, even more Heavenly Emperors were moved.

The surrounding Heavenly Emperor powerhouses swarmed over, practically blocking off the path up.

Riverword’s expression changed wildly and he said, “This dog thing, really shameless! Little Friend Ye, are ... are you really fine? Mn? Little Friend Ye?”

He discovered that Ye Yuan completely ignored him.

The surrounding attacks became more and more, countless light motes fired over, dense like raindrops, making Riverword’s scalp go numb.

When Heavenly Eye saw this scene, his eyes revealed a delighted smile.

Shui Yuan even gave a big thumbs up and said smugly, “Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye is really brilliant! This move will really claim this punk’s life!”

Lonesoul was serious in speech and manner, but his face also revealed a smile at this time and said, “Inviting Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye this time is really of great help!”

Heavenly Eye said smugly, “This brat has a sharp mind. Furthermore, his array formation attainments are indeed extremely strong. Going to Eight Void Mountain is indeed his best choice. It’s a pity that ... he ran into this old man! Heh, playing tricks in front of this old man, this Eight Void Mountain will be his burial ground!”

Puff!

His voice had yet to fade when another Heavenly Emperor was killed!

Pffft, pffft!

This time, it was two!

Another moment passed, Ye Yuan’s fingers snapped repeatedly, directly annihilating three Heavenly Emperors!

The movements of Ye Yuan’s hands got faster and faster, and increasingly precise.

Before long, a dozen over Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were actually slaughtered cleanly by him!

At this time, there were many more Heavenly Emperors that swarmed over.

But Ye Yuan’s speed of killing people got faster and faster!

Killing until the back, there was already no one that dared to come up anymore!

Beside Ye Yuan, Riverword’s eyeballs were almost popping out.

What happened?

Just now, he was clearly still being overwhelmed. How did he erupt all of a sudden?

Heavenly Eye three people were still feeling pleased with themselves earlier. Now, they were directly rendered mute.

“This ... What’s going on here?” Shui Yuan looked at this scene, shocked until he stared dumbfounded with his mouth agape.

Heavenly Eye’s gaze turned intent and he looked over toward Ye Yuan, and could not help sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

“This boy is comprehending the formations! Walking along the way, his Formation Dao strength grew stronger again! Just now, he was surrounded, it was just because he wanted to borrow these people’s hands to comprehend the array formations! Now ... he comprehended it!” Heavenly Eye opened his eyes wide and said in shock.

By the side, Shui Yuan two people listened until they were dumbstruck with amazement.

“This boy’s comprehension ability is also too freakish, right?” Lonesoul could not resist complaining.

Heavenly Eye shook his head and said, “This boy already trod out his own path in Formation Dao! His understanding of Formation Dao already pries right at the source! This Eight Void Mountain’s array formations is a huge treasure vault to Formation Dao powerhouses. It only depends on whether you have the ability to excavate it or not! This boy definitely didn’t come to Eight Void Mountain before in the past, so the inspiration that the restrictions here gave to him was huge, letting his strength make a qualitative leap within a short time! Hiss ... truly a terrifying lad!”

Heavenly Eye’s analysis was already very close to the truth.

Actually, Ye Yuan had been comprehending the formations along the way!

People should not look at how his speed of scaling the mountain was very fast. Actually, it was just that the restrictions at the foot of the mountain were too simple. Ye Yuan was able to deconstruct them very quickly and turn them into his.

All the way until Heavenly Eye used a heavenly emperor spirit treasure as bait to lure Eight-star Formation Gods to deal with Ye Yuan. This allowed Ye Yuan to achieve mastery through a comprehensive study of the things along the way, and let his Formation Dao strength make another qualitative leap.

Actually, if Ye Yuan wanted to ascend the mountain, he could have long rushed up.

But Ye Yuan was not in a rush. He was not fleeing for his life, he wanted to match magical powers with Heavenly Eye!

It was just that Heavenly Eye did not know these thoughts!
