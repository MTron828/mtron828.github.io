Chapter 2261: Certain Death Scheme!

With Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun’s awe, Ye Yuan swaggered out of Eight Void Mountain and left just like that.

But even if there wasn’t Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun, he would not care either.

Three great Deva Realm powerhouses pursued him for a trillion miles and failed to make him stay; let alone a few Heavenly Emperors?

Presently, his strength made great improvements. Even if he was not a Heavenly Emperor’s match, escaping did not pose a problem.

Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun naturally understood this as well. It was merely offering a convenient favor. That was all.

At least, his one sentence could save Ye Yuan quite a bit of trouble.

When the three people left Eight Void Mountain, Ye Yuan stopped his footsteps and said to Riverword with clasped hands, “Senior, this Ye has other important matters and will take my leave here! If Senior is free, you can also come to Southern Border’s Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma to find this Ye.”

He and Riverword were chance acquaintances. Ye Yuan saving him was also just happening to be present on the occasion.

Presently, Shui Yuan three people, two were dead and one seriously injured. It was impossible to find trouble with Riverword within a short time.

Riverword was a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerful existence. Even if he was presently crippled, he had the ability to protect himself too. It was naturally not nice for Ye Yuan to overstep his boundaries.

If it was too deliberate, Riverword would even think that he had some devious thoughts.

Riverword’s expression was complicated. Finally making up his mind, he handed the Limitless God Killing Bow to Ye Yuan and said, “Little Friend Ye, this Limitless God Killing Bow, I’ll give to you!”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised, Riverword practically died, with his Dao dissipating, for the Limitless God Killing Bow.

But now, he actually gave it to him?

He shook his head and said with a smile, “Senior, you don’t have to be like this. I didn’t save you for it.”

But Riverword insisted: “Little Friend Ye doesn’t have to worry too much. If you covet it, you didn’t need to save me at all. You could have just killed me back then! I’m giving it to you, firstly to thank your life-saving grace. Second, it’s that I’m already crippled. Wanting it is useless too. So might as well give it to you.”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Alright, then this Ye won’t be pretentious and accept it first. In the future, when Senior’s strength recovers, I’ll return it to you.”

Riverword smiled bitterly when he heard that and said, “I employed the power of my small world to escape with my life and already damaged my foundation. At present, my small world is already in ruins, becoming a dead world. How can I still recover my strength?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, rest assured. Heaven doesn’t cut off all roads! Leave your injuries to me.”

Riverword trembled all over and looked at Ye Yuan and said, “You have a way?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “A hundred over years ago, this Ye had once experienced a great battle, with my small world being completely devastated. Later, this Ye gained enlightenment on Dao and created the Chaos Samsara Pill. That was how I recovered. Senior’s injuries are largely identical with this Ye’s past injury, albeit having some minor differences. After this Ye breaks through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm, as long as I find suitable rank eight spirit medicines, you can naturally recover!”

Riverword’s eyes were originally gloomy. Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, he immediately had a hopeful look.

“This ... This ... Truly, heaven doesn’t cut off all roads! Being able to meet Little Friend Ye, heaven truly didn’t forsake me! Heaven truly didn’t forsake me!” Riverword said with an agitated look.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If Senior doesn’t have anywhere to go, why not go to my Heavenly Eagle and become a permanent resident?”

Riverword nodded his head repeatedly and said, “I’m all alone by myself without a tie in the world. So I’ll go together with you!”

Finished talking, the three people set off once more, heading toward the Southern Border.

... ...

Returning to Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, it was already several months later.

Ye Yuan ordered people to settle Riverword and Wild Blade down, and then he went to find Bai Tong.

The reason why he came back was that he received Bai Tong’s summons.

“Brother Bai, what happened?” Ye Yuan asked.

Bai Tong’s expression was rather ugly. Handing a jade slip to Ye Yuan, he said, “You see for yourself.”

Ye Yuan’s heart sank, having a foreboding premonition.

Sure enough, after he looked through the things in the jade slip, his expression became extremely ugly.

Ning Tianping was captured!

Ye Yuan heard Ning Tianping say before, his master, Mo Lifei’s enemy, was called Li Zhaoqing, and was at the Eastern Border’s Skyfame Great Imperial Capital.

But this Li Zhaoqing had merely a peak True God cultivation.

Even if he broke through to Empyrean Realm, with Ning Tianping’s present strength, dealing with him should not be a problem.

Before leaving, Ye Yuan gave Ning Tianping quite a number of Empyrean spirit treasures.

Even if he could not win, running away should not be a problem.

But did not expect that Ning Tianping was actually captured.

The jade slip said that Mo Lifei was already killed and Ning Tianping was imprisoned.

This was nothing much. What was strange was that the other party made Ye Yuan bring 50 rank seven divine pills to go and redeem him!

Furthermore, it could only be Ye Yuan alone!

Who the other party was, Ye Yuan did not have the slightest clue.

But Ye Yuan was certain that it was not Li Zhaoqing.

Just the likes of him did not have this ability.

Ye Yuan dug deep within and thought of many possibilities, but also did not think of who it was.

“What do you think?” Ye Yuan asked Bai Tong.

Bai Tong had clearly already thought it over and said in a solemn voice, “This is definitely a trap! Furthermore, the person who laid down the trap understands you very well! In my view, the medicinal pills are just a cover. Their real objective is you!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Tianping has followed me for so many years, I know his disposition. Even if he dies, he also won’t reveal any information about me. I’m afraid that right when Tianping left the city, he was already targeted.”

Bai Tong’s face fell, and he said, “No way, right? Could it be that ... we have a spy among us?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Heavenly Eagle developed too quickly these few years. Although the cohesion is very strong, wanting to watch over every aspect is clearly not too likely. It wasn’t a secret that Tianping and I left Heavenly Eagle. It’s also not strange that people knew. They don’t dare to take action against me. So they naturally thought of a plan for Tianping. The other part clearly knows me very well and definitely laid down an inescapable net, waiting for me.”

Bai Tong’s expression changed and he said, “Then ... Then what to do? Don’t go!”

Ye Yuan gave Bai Tong a glance. The latter’s face turned red. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He knew that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to not go.

Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping were master and servant in name, but brothers in reality.

Back then, Ye Yuan killed people in a rage for Jiang Ming who was a nobody.

Now, his brother was in trouble. So how could he sit by idly and remain indifferent?

“Relax, the reason why they don’t dare to take action against me is clearly that they don’t have confidence. Moreover, I made great harvests going out this time. These are all outside of their expectations. But before this, I have to make some preparations,” Ye Yuan said.

Bai Tong was worried about his safety, he naturally would not blame Bai Tong.

“I’ll go together with you!” Bai Tong said.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “You can’t go! There are definitely their informants inside and outside the city. Once they discover that you aren’t in the city, they will definitely kill the hostage.”

Bai Tong’s brows furrowed, clearly being quite worried about Ye Yuan going alone.

What he was worried about was if the other party had Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, forget about saving people, he would get captured himself too.

As for spatial law, it was already something that everyone in this Southern Border knew about. The other party would definitely seal off the space around the area and not give Ye Yuan the chance to escape.

This trap was a complete and utter scheme!

You had to come whether or not you wanted to!

Furthermore, the enemy was in the dark and Ye Yuan was in the light. This was virtually a certain death scheme.
