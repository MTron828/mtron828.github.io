Chapter 1430 Secret Tampering

Seeing that Ye Yuan had signs of flying off the handle, Bai Chen hurriedly said, “Master mustn’t get angry. Lord Divine Envoy cannot be offended!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said with a nod, “Fine, I got it! But ...”

Bai Chen only felt a blur before his eyes and he lost sight of Ye Yuan.

Bang!

Everyone only felt their chrysanthemum tighten[1]. Azurepeak’s body was directly kicked flying.

When Azurepeak made a move earlier, it was precisely when Ye Yuan and the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain produced a resonance.

With the might of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain leaking out, how could it allow a Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm fellow’s impudence?

With this, it just nicely knocked onto the spearhead. He was knocked unconscious by the recoil force.

Right now, Azurepeak was in a deep coma. Ye Yuan was like kicking a rubber ball, one after another, not letting him land at all.

Kicking over a dozen times in a row, Ye Yuan landed floatingly.

Bang!

Azurepeak’s robust body landed, crushing a stretch of green bricks.

The group of martial artists all turned their faces over, unable to bear looking straight at it.

But no idea why, including Bai Xiu, each and every one of them all felt very liberated.

This Azurepeak relied on that he was a divine envoy. That was hy his nostrils were almost pointing to the sky.

Furthermore, regardless of whether Bai Chen’s strength was strong or not, he was the White Night Sacred Palace’s palace lord.

Azurepeak disciplined him like a grandson, that was disciplining the White Night Sacred palace as a grandson. How could they all, these people, feel like they had a face?

Ye Yuan’s way of doing things, they did not dare. But they felt very relieved watching.

“Mn, about there. Either way, he’s unconscious and won’t remember the things now either. Bring him down and remember to arrange a first-class wing-room. Don’t let people say that we slighted Lord Divine Envoy,” Ye Yuan said faintly.

Everyone exchanged glances and followed Ye Yuan to the great hall.

After arriving at the great hall, everyone looked at Ye Yuan with eager eyes, wanting to speak, but finding it hard to speak up.

Ye Yuan could not help smiling and said, “Say whatever you have. I’m not some ferocious beast either.”

All of them turned their gazes to Bai Chen. Bai Chen toughened his scalp and said with clasped hands, “Master Ye Yuan, actually, everyone is all worried about this rumor. We all want to ask whether Master, you are an intruder or not! After all, Master Ye Yuan, you were originally a reclusive powerhouse. Furthermore, your age is young, and you have such terrifying cultivation. This is completely out of tune with our Sky Foothill World’s powerhouses! But this time, Lord Divine Envoy brought the Tianlu Shrine over! Under the Tianlu Shrine, everything will be revealed!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s gazes were all glued on Ye Yuan, wanting to see what he had to say.

In reality, everyone was stifled until they were about to explode.

After all, it was a major life-and-death matter. Furthermore, the more it spread, the more vivid and dramatic. Everyone was naturally anxious and doubtful in their hearts.

Bai Chen’s complexion appeared somewhat pale because of nervousness and injuries.

He was asking questions on the surface but was actually warning Ye Yuan that it could not be hidden anymore.

Take the chance when Lord Divine Envoy had not woken up yet and hurry up and leave the Sky Foothill World!

Ye Yuan gave him a glance, understanding tacitly, but said with a smile, “It’s useless to say anymore. Since Lord Divine Envoy brought the Tianlu Shrine over, then let him try. See whether or not he can reflect me, this intruder!”

The moment everyone heard this, they immediately heaved a long sigh in relief.

“With Grand Elder’s words, this large stone in our hearts finally landed!”

“How can Grand Elder possibly be an intruder? When he was in a fierce battle with Lan Zhiru, they already fought to that extent and didn’t see Heavenly Dao produce any rejection towards him either.”

“You don’t say. These few days, it spread really vividly and dramatically. I was really somewhat scared!”

“Isn’t that so! That’s primarily because Grand Elder is too young, too formidable; on a completely different level from us, these mediocre people!”

“Hahaha!”

...

After everyone dissipated, inside the secret chamber, Bai Chen and Mo Yun’s expressions were not too good.

“Master Ye Yuan, you’d best go! I know that you said that in order to placate everyone. But the Tianlu Shrine is different. Because it’s created to specifically target you all, these trial-takers!” Bai Chen urged.

Ye Yuan could not help becoming interested the moment he heard. Although this Sky Foothill World’s Dao of artifact refinement was not above the Heavenspan World’s, it had its uniqueness.

“Just what is this Tianlu Shrine, talk about it,” Ye Yuan asked.

Bai Chen saw that Ye Yuan had an indifferent look and explained the origins of the Tianlu Shrine in detail.

It turned out that the Sky Foothill World discovered that quite a number of trial-takers all had many concealment means. As long as they did not urge divine essence to the limit, it was very hard to arouse Heavenly Dao’s rejection.

Even when facing Deity Realm powerhouses, they could cover up very well too.

Hence, the Sky Foothill Divine Palace refined the Tianlu Shrine in order to make these people reveal everything.

This Tianlu Shrine was said to be a celestial divine artifact refined by a peak Three-star Artifact God, containing a portion of Sky Foothill Heavenly Dao’s oppression.

As long as one activated the Tianlu Shrine and intruders drew near within a certain range, it would automatically have a response and attack the other party!

Even if your concealment means were heaven-defying and able to hide from the Tianlu Shrine’s response, as long as you drip a drop of fresh blood in, it could sense it too!

“According to what I know, there are already no less than several hundred trial-takers who have died under the Tianlu Shrine! Lord Ye Yuan, you’d best leave!” Mo Yun also urged bitterly.

Ye Yuan also clicked his tongue in wonder when he heard. This artifact refining ability was truly impressive, to actually be able to integrate a trace of Heavenly Dao into the divine artifact.

This artificer’s means were really impressive.

After listening to these, Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “I said before, for the sake of the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, I’ll do whatever it takes! You guys rest assured, if I really can’t hide from the Tianlu Shrine’s investigation, I won’t implicate you all either!”

The moment Bai Chen heard, he was indignant and said angrily, “Master Ye Yuan, what are you saying?! This life of mine was given by you, would I still be scared of you implicating? It’s just that this Tianlu Shrine is truly too formidable. I’m afraid ...”

One could tell that Bai Chen was really worried about Ye Yuan’s safety.

If he really was found out, even if this Azurepeak could not make Ye Yuan stay, it would also be very hard for Ye Yuan to escape the Sky Foothill World.

Ye Yuan smiled and patted Bai Chen’s shoulder, and slowly left.

...

Azurepeak abruptly opened both eyes and suddenly sat up in shock.

“Argh! Pain ... So painful!”

Green veins throbbed on Azurepeak’s forehead, instantly breaking out into cold sweat.

Waves of heart-piercing pain seemingly spread throughout his entire body like an uninterrupted electric current.

Slam! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Azurepeak directly rolled off the bed and tumbled about on the ground in agony. He could not even emit a cry for help.

Those few kicks of Ye Yuan seemed ordinary and bland. Actually, each kick was very particular.

One should not look at what Ye Yuan’s background was. In fact, he was too familiar with the acupoints on a martial artist’s body.

With the physical body toughness of Deity Realm powerhouses, those few kicks did not leave any hidden injuries on his body. It just released his backlash injuries to the greatest extent.

Now, the moment he was awake, this pain instantly erupted, making him suffer for quite a while.

The current Azurepeak was curled up on the ground, his body twitching non-stop, looking incomparably miserable.
