Chapter 2077: Ruthless Extermination

The medicinal bottle passed around the hands of the Empyrean powerhouses.

After the person in front finished inspecting, they just silently passed it to the next person, the expression on their faces incomparably stunned.

Even someone as cold as ice like Empyrean Ice Cloud also had her curiosity stirred. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She thought to herself, could this medicinal pill really be divine-grade?

“Younger Sister Ice CLoud, you take a look for yourself.

Among the eight people, the stronger Empyrean Redfeather heaved a slight sigh and passed the small medicinal bottle to Empyrean Ice Cloud.

Ice Cloud looked at him curiously, caught the small bottle that was thrown over, and said scornfully, “Even if it’s divine-grade, it’s also not to the extent of making all of you have this expression, right? Humph! So what if it’s divine-grade, is this the reason for looking down on ... us?”

As she expressed her derision, she sunk her divine sense into the small bottle.

Talking until the end, her entire sentence was stuck in her throat, and she only felt that her throat was incomparably dry.

“V-Vast spirit ... divine-grade! H-How is this possible?”

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s pupils constricted, her gaze full of disbelief.

Vast spirit divine pill!

In this vast expanse of Northernmost Steppe, had vast spirit divine pills appeared before?

Empyrean Ice Cloud was also not too sure, but most likely it had never occurred!

Although the Northernmost Steppe was boundlessly vast, the Seven-star Alchemy Gods added up were also just those few.

Even if those people’s strengths were stronger than Empyrean Loneswan, it was also not that much stronger.

Forget about having them refine vast spirit divine pills; even ordinary purple spirit divine-grade, they probably could not refine it.

Even if refined, it was also those level one and two simple medicinal pills.

The difficulty of level nine medicinal pills to them was too high!

But this young man in front of them actually refined a vast spirit divine pill with the cultivation realm of a Six-star Alchemy God?

How was this possible?

“Sigh, Younger Sister Ice Cloud, you were too impulsive! How can someone capable of making Younger Brother Loneswan respect so much not have some ability?” Empyrean Redfeather also sighed slightly and said.

“Some ability? Heh heh, Master Ji ... doesn’t have just some ability here!” Empyrean Void Sword said with a laugh.

“Humph! This Empyrean is also a respected figure in this Northernmost Steppe. If not for Master’s Alchemy Dao making me look up to it, why would I acknowledge him as my master? Ice Cloud, before you came in, you said that you’d talk nicely. That’s why this Empyrean agreed. But now, after entering Grand Pill Establishment, you disrespected Master. This Empyrean can’t help you anymore!” Empyrean Loneswan said with a cold snort.

Wouldn’t Empyrean Ice Cloud looking down on Ye Yuan be equivalent to looking down on him, Empyrean Loneswan?

How silly would he have been, to acknowledge an incapable Six-star Alchemy God as his master?

“This ... Master Ji, I ... I ...” Empyrean Ice Cloud stammered and already did not know what she should say.

A Six-star Alchemy God capable of refining vast spirit divine pills was absolutely a Mount Tai existence in this Northernmost Steppe!

She actually questioned such a major power just now.

Only now did she know that when Ye Yuan said he could create an Empyrean powerhouse with a flip of his hand, those were not empty words.

Since Ye Yuan could refine a vast spirit divine-grade Earth Nether Imprint Pill, then refining a divine-grade and above Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill was absolutely nothing difficult.

It was just that the spirit medicines that the Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill required were too hard to come by. Otherwise, wouldn’t Ye Yuan creating a batch of Empyrean powerhouses be like taking something out of his pocket?

“Empyrean Ice Cloud, you can leave now. The medicinal pills that you’re requesting for, this Ji won’t refine them. In addition, all of Grand Pill Establishment’s medicinal pill supply to your Ice Cloud Tower will discontinue starting from today!” Ye Yuan opened his mouth coolly and directly issued the order to chase away the guest.

He sneered coldly to no end in his heart. Finally he showed Empyrean Ice Cloud some colors.

To dare treat Lu-er like so, how could it do to not let you taste the flavor of despair?

Right from the start, Ye Yuan never planned on dropping in to ask Empyrean Ice Cloud to release her.

That was the worst strategy.

He thought even less of snatching Lu-er with martial strength. Really pressing this Empyrean Ice Cloud into a corner, she might really hurt Lu-er.

Since the identity of an alchemist was useful, then what did bringing Jiu Luo Ji to its knees and compelling the Northernmost Steppe to submit count for with his strength?

One had to know, he defeated the entire Southern Border’s alchemy world with his power alone!

Ye Yuan’s plan was to overpower her until she yielded, and he also wanted to make her send Lu-er over obediently!

“You! Bullying people too far!” When had Empyrean Ice Cloud suffered this kind of treatment before? She was angered until her middle-aged expression was icy-cold.

Empyrean Ice Cloud was still thinking of apologizing. Who knew that Ye Yuan did not give her the chance at all, directly cutting off Ice Cloud Tower’s grain.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Bullying people too far? This is just you bringing trouble to yourself.”

Empyrean Redfeather could not quite look on anymore and spoke up, “Master Ji, Younger Sister Ice Cloud she ...”

Before he finished speaking, Ye Yuan’s expression turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “If anyone intercedes for her, don’t come to Grand Pill Establishment to request for pills anymore in the future!”

The faces of all the Empyreans changed and they indeed did not dare to say anymore.

They had already witnessed Ye Yuan’s strength. Although it could not directly increase their strength, it could make their factions much more powerful.

How could such a person be casually offended?

Even Empyrean Ice Cloud, this kind of hothead, was purely looking for abuse by opposing Ye Yuan.

Song Cao and the rest watched until they were quaking in their boots by the side. Good lord, their grandmaster was really domineering!

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s chest heaved up and down and she gritted her teeth and said, “Good, good, good! This Empyrean doesn’t believe that in this Northernmost Steppe, there’s just you, one alchemist!”

Finished talking, Empyrean Ice Cloud flicked her sleeves and left.

“Master, this ...” Empyrean Loneswan also did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually have such an intense reaction and did not even hesitate.

In this Northernmost Steppe, the Seven-star Alchemy Gods were not just him alone.

Hearing Empyrean Ice Cloud’s meaning, she was clearly planning to find other assemble’s Seven-star Alchemy Gods to cooperate.

But Ye Yuan did not care in the slightest and said coolly, “Loneswan, remember! Under my charge, alchemists mustn’t be insulted! Not only this Ji is like this, you as well as Song Cao they all, need to have this confidence, understood?”

Empyrean Loneswan’s expression turned somber, and then he bowed and said, “Yes, Disciple understands.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and continued, “Loneswan, starting from tomorrow, you accompany me and head to the surrounding territories to pay a visit to fellow alchemists in the steppes.”

The moment these words came out, all of the Empyreans’ faces changed.

Goodness, this was ruthless extermination!

If one was unconvinced, kill until the person submitted!

Not only was this young man’s strength formidable, but his temper was also similarly arrogant.

This kind of person must not be offended.

All of the Empyreans’ hearts turned cold and naturally understood that Ye Yuan was killing the chicken to warn the monkeys.

“Yes, Master!” Loneswan said respectfully.

At the same time, he was delighted in his heart.

With Master garrisoning, Grand Pill Establishment could do as it pleased in the Northernmost Steppe this time.

“Haha, Master Ji, this Empyrean has always been on close terms with Loneswan. Coming here this time, I want to request for several medicinal pills,” Empyrean Redfeather said with some awkwardness.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “This is naturally not a problem. If you need rank six divine pills, as long as you all gather the spirit medicines, I’ll definitely return you a divine-grade medicinal pill. As for rank seven divine pills, wait for a few more days, I believe that Loneswan will be able to give you all a pleasant surprise.”

When everyone heard that, their hearts could not help jumping. Following that, it was wild elation.

Rank seven divine pills were too hard to come across in this Northernmost Steppe!
