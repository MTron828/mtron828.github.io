Chapter 3108: Heavenless Revives!

“Senior Mi Tian, you’ve lived for countless years. You’re the most knowledgeable. In your lifetime, of the 33 Tribulations of Apocalypses that you’ve seen, I wonder what’s the most that someone has transcended before?” Yi Xue looked at Mi Tian and said with a chuckle.

With this, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mi Tian.

Mi Tian was not the strongest, but he was born from chaos and had lived for countless years. He naturally had great knowledge and experience.

If talking about who was the greatest authority, it was other than him.

Mi Tian had a dark look and was still silent.

But Yang Qing said anxiously, “Senior, say it, are you trying to worry us to death?”

At this point, they naturally understood that Yi Xue was absolutely not exaggerating things to raise the alarm.

The 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse really existed!

It was just that far too few were able to call down this kind of Dao tribulation. Over the course of time, it was overlooked by people.

Those old men should know it too.

During the last time Ye Yuan used the Heaven Trampling Five Steps, Yi Xue and Mi Tian two people both sensed that it should be the 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse.

Mi Tian also knew that it could not be hidden anymore and could only sigh. He then said, “Roughly 80 thousand years ago, there was a human divergent cultivator called Mo Fan who had once brought down this tribulation. At that time, he … overcame the eighth tribulation. During the ninth tribulation, he was buried in oblivion! This is the most that I’ve seen!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of Yang Qing and the rest changed wildly.

......

Mi Tian could be said to be the 33 Heavens’ living fossil.

In his memories, the strongest divergent cultivator only transcended eight tribulations!

One had to know that not all divergent cultivators could bring down this tribulation.

Those able to bring it down, they were heaven-defying powerhouses among divergent cultivators in the first place!

But the strongest one was only eight tribulations!

Yi Xue smiled and said, “Senior Mi Tian is likely scared to demoralize you guys, so he didn’t say some things. I’ve heard of this Mo Fan before. His strength is extremely formidable. During the time he was at Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm, he had once killed a Peak Hegemon before too. Even if he’s not as good as Ye Yuan, he’s likely not far off either.”

“But there aren’t many geniuses like him! In reality, those able to transcend three tribulations are like the feather of a phoenix and horn of a Qilin. They were very rare! In this ancestor’s impression, there were only a meager five people too! Besides Mo Fan, the one that cleared the most only transcended until the fifth tribulation! Now, do you all still think that Ye Yuan can break through to Hegemon Realm?”

Talking until here, Yi Xue could not help letting out a loud laugh.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses were deathly silent.

Yi Xue’s words were equivalent to sentencing Ye Yuan to death.

His words divulged some information, this 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse, each tribulation was stronger than the last.

This tribulation had no other effect than to throttle these people who went against heaven in their cradle.

Ye Yuan was definitely an amazingly talented person. Even when compared to Mo Fan, he was significantly stronger too. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

But there were still more than 20 Dao tribulations at the back!

“This … How can it be like this?”

“Could it be that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven is really hopeless?”

“This is really a bolt out of the blue! How can there be such a horrifying Dao tribulation in this world?”

…..

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses fell into panic and fear at once.

Yi Xue’s words shattered all of their hope to pieces.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s final hope was that Ye Yuan could succeed in overcoming his tribulation.

Only then could they have the power to fight it out with the blood race.

But now, this hope was shattered!

Rumble …

Suddenly, the void trembled. Powerhouses that were flying in the sky, their figures swayed. Some could not even stabilize their figures and fell down.

Yi Xue’s expression changed, and he said, “This power is coming from the Eternal River’s chaos! It’s … It’s Ancestor Heavenless!”

Mi Tian’s expression also turned slightly grim, and he said, “What a strong power of chaos! Could it be that … he has already transcended the Great Beyond?”

This power swept across the entire void, spreading across the 33 Heavens.

At this time, this powerful force could be felt everywhere in the 33 Heavens.

They had never felt this kind of power before.

Even if it was the likes of Mi Tian and Yi Xue, they did not give them such a powerful sense of oppression too.

At this time, inside the Eternal River’s chaos, a figure of a middle-aged man dressed in taoist robes was currently slowly condensing and forming.

Countless Eternal River chaos flooded over toward him, helping him to remold his physical body.

This kind of undulation spread across the entire 33 Heavens through the waters of the Eternal River.

“Hahaha … My body of chaos has finally been sculpted successfully! These several hundred thousand years of waiting were ultimately not in vain! Old Dog Samsara, wait to suffer this progenitor’s wrath! This time, we’ll settle all of the scores together!”

Ancestor Heavenless let out a wild laughter, full of high spirits, his imposing momentum billowing to the sky.

He lured powerhouses from all heavens and refined a chaos heavenly pill. At this time, he actually succeeded!

Behind Ancestor Heavenless, the Door of Eternal Life opened.

The two doors of eternal life were practically already fully opened at this time.

That hollow depths seemed incomparably deep and mysterious.

Gradually, Ancestor Heavenless’ figure completely condensed and formed, and the Door of Eternal Life also suddenly stopped.

There was just one last trace, and it would be fully opened!

“ARGHHH! Ye Yuan, it’s all because of you, this punk! Otherwise, this seat will definitely be able to reach the true Great Beyond! Before killing Old Dog Samsara, this seat will slaughter you, this punk, first!”

Amidst the chaos came Ancestor Heavenless’ angry roar.

Boom!

It was only to see his figure move, directly traversing through the Eternal River’s chaos, sprinting wildly in the direction of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

An astonishing huge wave engulfed everything and swept over here.

“He’s here!” Mi Tian’s expression changed, and he said in shock.

“W-What a powerful aura! Is this the true Great Beyond?” Zhuo Bufan’s gaze flickered as he said.

Yi Xue’s expression was very ugly too. He did not know what Ancestor Heavenless wanted to do.

Under this kind of strength, all resistance was superfluous!

Boom!

A large hole was directly blown open in the void. Ancestor Heavenless’ figure gradually stepped out.

The moment he took the stage, everyone’s aura was directly suppressed.

Including Mi Tian and Yi Xue!

It was only at this time did people truly realize what Great Beyond meant!

Ancestor Heavenless’ aura was too strong!

His gaze swept across everyone’s faces. Those who were swept by him seemed to be pinned down by Mount Tai, kneeling down involuntarily.

For a moment, the powerhouses that filled the sky actually all knelt down.

That was submission to Heavenly Dao. They could not control themselves!

Only powerhouses that were Hegemon Realm and above could barely manage to stand.

But everyone’s bodies descended one after another. No one dared to fly in the sky in front of Ancestor Heavenless.

Heavenless’ gaze landed on Yi Xue. Yi Xue’s entire body felt like he was being stared at by a wild beast, his hair standing on end.

“Blood race’s Yi Xue congratulates Ancestor Heavenless for attaining Great Dao!” Yi Xue directly knelt down without the slightest hesitation.

“Scram!”

Heavenless shouted angrily, flicking his sleeves. A terrifying force howled over.

Yi Xue’s expression changed wildly, saint force running rampant on his body, attempting to resist.

But, before he could display his strength, he was directly flattened by a giant wave.

Pffft!

Fresh blood spurted wildly from Yi Xue’s body, and finally, with a bang, he directly exploded.

But very soon, that cloud of remnant blood condensed again, letting him revive.

It was just that at this time, Yi Xue’s complexion was extremely pale. Clearly, he had already suffered extremely severe injuries.

When the powerhouses all over the sky saw this scene, each and every one of them was extremely shocked.

Who was Yi Xue?

Being able to contend with Mi Tian, he was a supreme powerhouse standing at the peak of the 33 Heavens.

But he actually could not stand up to a single blow in front of Ancestor Heavenless!

Clearly, Ancestor Heavenless was not serious at all!

Otherwise, with that blow just now, he could have directly taken Yi Xue’s life!

“Humph! With this ancestor corroborating my Dao, is it your, a small fry’s, turn, to come and congratulate me? I’ll spare your life. Go back and tell that lousy stone. This ancestor will be coming to find him to settle the Labyrinth Divine Palace score very soon!”

Finished speaking, he stopped paying attention to Yi Xue and turned to Mi Tian and said, “Where’s Ye Yuan punk? Have him come out and die!”
