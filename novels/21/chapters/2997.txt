Chapter 2996: Chaos True Dragon!

Ye Yuan did not recognize this Supreme Hegemon, but he already knew who he was.

Hegemon Dragonsand!

Back then, when Zhao Yue was completely beastified, he was suppressed by him.

Clearly, the experience back then was very unpleasant.

Zhao Yue only relied on instinct when doing things. Apart from Hegemon Dragonsand, nobody made him have such great fury.

“Hur hur,?little fellow, your tone is very big! You think that because this ugly monster listens to you, you can be unbridled in front of this seat?” Dragonsand said with a light laugh.

Clearly, he did not place Ye Yuan, this little bug, in his sights at all.

That made sense. Why would an exalted Supreme Hegemon place an Emperor Cloud Heaven in his eyes?

However, he was calm and collected on the surface. In reality, he was extremely shocked in his heart.

He naturally knew who Zhao Yue was because it was he who took action to suppress Zhao Yue when he was forced to fuse with the Conversion Blood Crystal.

Back then, the berserk Zhao Yue did not have the strength to resist at all under his hands.

But, that blow earlier, although Zhao Yue was somewhat at a disadvantage, he already had the qualification to fight with him!

Furthermore, this monster did not recognize its closest relatives and was violent to the extreme. It could actually heed Ye Yuan’s words.

This boy was not simple!

Ye Yuan looked at Dragonsand and said coolly, “Dragonsand, we haven’t come after you yet, but you jumped out yourself. When we all, these people, came to Heavenly Dragon Island, we didn’t think of going back alive at all! If Blood Dragon Island’s matter is the entire Heavenly Dragon Island’s intention, then I have nothing to say. Today, just count it as the few thousand of us are walking right into a trap. But if it isn’t,?hur hur,?you probably can’t shirk responsibility!”

Dragonsand’s gaze turned cold, and he said in a cold voice, “What Blood Dragon Island? Brat, you dare to slander this seat. This seat will kill you right now! Could it be that anyone else dare to say a word of refusal?”

Terrifying power of origin directly pressed over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan seemed to be hit by a paralyzing hex, unable to move at all.

This was the strength of a Supreme Hegemon!

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue roared angrily once more, preparing to pounce towards Dragonsand.

“Enough! Dragonsand, stop! The matter hasn’t been figured out yet. What are you haggling over with a junior for?” Long Jian stopped.

Dragonsand was clearly a little apprehensive of Long Jian. That was why he restrained his aura and said with a cold snort, “This junior has a human physical body, but he possesses heaven qian grade bloodline. It’s peculiar! No matter how things are, we have to figure it out!”

Long Jian nodded his head, expressing agreement.

Indeed, he found it very strange too.

Ye Yuan’s bloodline power clearly could not hide from these major powers.

“Long Ran, whatever there is, say it clearly in front of all the clansmen!” Long Jian said.

Long Ran said with a cold smile,?“Heh heh,?luckily, this old man listened to Ye Yuan and came with such a grand line-up. Otherwise, I really couldn’t have explained things with one mouth! This matter can’t be reasoned with you. I want to see Progenitor Mi Zhen!”

Long Jian frowned and said, “Long Ran, you’re going overboard!”

Long Ran did not care in the slightest and said with a cold snort, “Long Jian, this matter, don’t need me to say, you’ve also guessed some things, right? I came today to personally ask Progenitor Mi Zhen, whether or not he has given up on the East Billow Region? If so, don’t need everyone to take action. This old man will kill them with my own hands, then pass away in seclusion here!”

His gaze swept over the faces of all the Hegemons, and he asked in a solemn voice, “There are many among you all who came from the East Billow Region too! Now, somebody is treating your children and descendants as pigs and sheep. Both hands stained full of their own people’s fresh blood! Do you all have an easy conscience like this?”

Those present were all not fools.

Long Ran coming with such a grand line-up, bringing along a bunch of ugly creatures and forcibly entering Heavenly Dragon Island, how could they not see through some clues?

They were also extremely shocked in their hearts.

There was actually someone who had such gall!

Long Jian let out a sigh and said, “Alright, this seat understands!”

Rumble?…

An enormous round hole suddenly appeared in the sky.

A massive dragon head emerged from the round hole.

A boundless chaos aura instantly enveloped the entire Heavenly Dragon Island.

Seeing this enormous dragon, Ye Yuan actually gave rise to the impulse to prostrate in worship.

He was incredibly shocked in his heart!

Was this the aura of a powerhouse who was about to reach the Great Beyond in the legends?

Strong!

Really strong to the extreme!

Originally, Ye Yuan thought that Supreme Hegemon was already the limit of Hegemon Realm.

Such as Hegemon Imperishable that level of existence, he was seriously far too strong.

Even if Hegemon Samsara was stronger than him, how strong could he be?

But now, having witnessed this enormous dragon, he completely understood.

Under the firmament, Ye Yuan felt that he was as insignificant as an ant.

They were heaven!

The enormous dragon swam out of the sky. That massive body could not be contained even by the entire vast expanse of heaven.

Ye Yuan estimated with his eyes that this enormous dragon’s body was probably reached 100 thousand feet long!

Chaos true dragon!

This was an existence that was born from heaven and earth!

“Paying respects to Progenitor Mi Zhen!” Everyone knelt down toward this giant dragon.

In fact, even the incomparably berserk Zhao Yue lied prostrate.

There was a voice in Ye Yuan’s heart that was calling non-stop, asking him to kneel.

But he did not!

Instead, Ye Yuan stuck his chest up and stood even straighter.

The giant dragon’s gaze looked over, the dragon head sticking straight down, virtually touching Ye Yuan’s face.

“Young man, why do you not kneel?”

“I’m a divergent cultivator. I don’t even kneel to heaven and earth. Why would I kneel to you?”

“You have a dragon soul; you’re of the dragon race. So you have to kneel to this ancestor!”

“You’re born from heaven and earth, then, do you kneel to heaven and earth?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Mi Zhen stared at Ye Yuan and was silent for a long time.

Ye Yuan also met Mi Zhen’s two eyes and did not shrink back in the slightest.

Long Ran and the rest felt like they were almost fainting in anger.

This punk’s gall was also too fat!

This was the progenitor. You actually dared to speak like that?

“Hahaha?…”

Suddenly, Mi Zhen burst into laughter.

The laughter shook until heaven and earth changed colors.

Ye Yuan felt that his bones were almost being shattered.

“Interesting! An interesting little fellow! Looks like you understand heaven very well! Across the heavens and myriad worlds, there has never been a divergent cultivator who could transcend samsara! This progenitor really wants to see how you fight with heaven!”

Amidst the loud laughter, Mi Zhen pulled back and circled around above the void again.

Ye Yuan finally let out a sigh of relief in secret.

This scene earlier merely lasted for a dozen over breaths.

But Ye Yuan felt as if ten thousand years had passed.

His heartbeat was almost stopping!

Facing such an existence, to say that his heart was still like water, that would be a lie.

But Ye Yuan’s willpower was long already incomparably powerful. He overcame it!

Of course, what was more important was that Mi Zhen was really too terrifying!

He did not have any secrets to speak of in front of him.

Being so near, Ye Yuan did not know whether or not Mi Tian would be exposed.

But, just now, Mi Tian seemingly disappeared from his body.

Even Ye Yuan himself could not feel his existence anymore.

Very clearly, Mi Zhen could not feel it too.

At this point, how could Ye Yuan still not guess it?

To be able to make Mi Tian fall, apart from an existence like Mi Zhen, who else could there be?

Mi Tian being reluctant to make it clear all along, on the one hand, it was that he himself was not sure too. On the other hand, he was worried that he would harm him.

Mi Zhen was too strong!

“Long Ran, whatever you have, say it!” Mi Zhen looked at Long Ran and said gravely.
