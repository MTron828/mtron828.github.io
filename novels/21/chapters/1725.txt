Chapter 1729 Palm That Flew Over

Jian Chen made haste and finally caught up.

While at this time, Jiang Mengqing was sent flying away by Ye Yuan. Only after a great flurry did she barely manage to stabilize her figure.

She looked at Ye Yuan, astonishment on her face.

She did not expect that even though the other party’s entire person was being restrained and he actually still had the strength to resist!

Jian Chen’s world power spread out, finally releasing Ye Yuan.

Xiahou Wenjian’s face fell and he looked at Jian Chen and said, “Master Jian Chen, this seat deliberately waited for this kid to leave the boundary of Extreme Light Imperial City before taking action. This seat has been sincere enough toward your Extreme Light Imperial City!”

Jian Chen clasped his hands and said, “Brother Xiahou’s sincerity, Jian Chen can naturally see it. But ... Ye Yuan and my master are already friends despite the difference in age. Brother Xiahou, please give Jian Chen’s face and let him leave, how about that?”

Xiahou Wenjian’s expression was very ugly. Jian Chen was one of the Profound Secrets Pavilion’s seven great grand elders, holding great power and authority; very respected.

In a normal situation, he would definitely give the other party face.

But now, the son that he valued the most died!

Now that the enemy was in front, could it be that he had to give up on taking revenge?

No, he was unreconciled to it!

“Master Jian Chen, other things, this seat can compromise with you. But this matter, pardon me for not being able to comply with your wishes! This guy killed my Yun-er. Not avenging this enmity, Yun-er he will find it hard to close his eyes in death!” Xiahou Wenjian glared at Ye Yuan and said.

Jian Chen’s expression was very ugly. This fellow was simply making trouble willfully!

His Extreme Light Imperial City had already hosted the Hundred Battles Arena for several hundred sessions, each session had quite a few geniuses that perished.

If everyone came to find trouble like this, where would his Extreme Light Imperial City’s face be put?

Jian Chen’s face fell and he said, “Brother Xiahou is being somewhat unreasonable and provocative saying these words! Getting on the Hundred Battles Arena, life and death are your own responsibility. This is my Extreme Light Imperial City’s rules. Brother Xiahou doing this right now, is it to provoke my Extreme Light Imperial City?”

Sure enough, Jian Chen’s words made Xiahou Wenjian’s face change!

Extreme Light Imperial City’s influence was too great. Not that their strength was very formidable, but that their proteges spanned all over the world.

Currently, the various major imperial cities’ sovereigns had mostly been guided by Extreme Light Imperial City before.

With Extreme Light Imperial City issuing a call for action, even if only 20% of the imperial cities answered, it was also not what one or two imperial cities could hold off.

This was Extreme Light Imperial City’s terrifying aspect.

Jian Chen looked over in Ye Yuan’s direction. It was only to see that he was covered in blood. Clearly, he already sustained extremely severe injuries.

This unwittingly made his heart rage with fury!

Master expended such great effort to perform divination for Ye Yuan, but Xiahou Wenjian almost killed him, how could this not enrage him?

“Humph! Jian Chen, don’t take Extreme Light Imperial City to come and suppress me! What others do, I don’t care. But my own son’s enmity, I must avenge it! Today, this kid must die!”

Jian Chen even thought that Xiahou Wenjian was scared. Who knew that after he struggled for a while, he actually said this kind of words!

Jian Chen’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “Xiahou Wenjian, you’re insolent!”

Xiahou Wenjian said in a solemn voice, “Jian Chen, I’m not standing here in the capacity of Ningbei Imperial City’s grand elder right now, but with the identity of a father! Today, whoever stops me, if gods block, kill gods, if Buddha blocks, kill Buddha!”

“You dare?!” Jian Chen’s face fell and he blocked in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s face also changed. This guy was already utterly crazy.

Xiahou Wenjian chuckled and smiled coldly as he said, “Why wouldn’t I dare? This seat is a Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity, while you’re only a Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity! If this seat wants to kill people, could you still stop it? The two of you, stop him for me! This seat will kill this guy personally and take revenge for Yun-er!”

Who Xiahou Wenjian brought were also all middle-stage Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses. The two of them joining hands, stopping Jian Chen was naturally nothing difficult.

Jian Chen’s expression changed and he said to Ye Yuan, “Quickly go, flee toward Extreme Light Imperial City!”

Ye Yuan’s face fell, directly entered inside the Purple Extreme Hall, and escaped in the direction of Extreme Light Imperial City.

He knew that Xiahou Wenjian absolutely did not dare to kill Jian Chen, so he did not have any worries to distract him either.

“Want to escape? This seat is here, can you escape?”

Xiahou Wenjian laughed coldly, figure moving, disappearing on the spot.

Jian Chen wanted to make a move to stop, but those two mighty Celestial Deity powerhouses already stepped forward.

Two-on-one, Jian Chen was immediately held back.

Inside the Purple Extreme Hall, Ye Yuan’s expression was very grim as he gritted his teeth and said, “So fast!”

A Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse, his strength was beyond imagination.

Ye Yuan had confidence in escaping under the hands of a First Firmament Celestial Deity by spurring on the Purple Extreme Hall. But in front of a Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity, it was completely lacking!

Xiahou Wenjian erupted and caught up to the Purple Extreme Hall.

A horrifying aura instantly enveloped the Purple Extreme Hall.

“Heh, this is really a treasure! This seat attacked at full power and it’s actually completely unharmed! It’s likely a true god mystic treasure! This time, this incident benefited this seat!”

Xiahou Wenjian laughed savagely. Raising his hand, it was a palm!

Bang!

The Purple Extreme Hall had nowhere to avoid and was hit head-on.

Even if Ye Yuan already urged the Purple Extreme Hall’s defenses to the limits, this palm still affected him until he vomited fresh blood wildly.

“Damn it! I didn’t expect that Xiahou Yun’s father was actually a Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity!” Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and said.

Xiahou Wenjian’s appearance had indeed somewhat exceeded his expectations.

This guy was too strong.

Bang!

Yet another palm!

Ye Yuan two people were shocked until they were shaken to the bones.

“Hahaha! The next attack will take your lives! Yun-er, Father will avenge you right now!”

Xiahou Wenjian laughed wildly, a glove appearing on his hand at goodness knows when!

Ye Yuan’s complexion turned pale and he said, “Not good! Celestial deity mystic treasure!”

A Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouses wearing a celestial deity artifact, that power was simply unimaginable.

Even separated through the Purple Extreme Hall, Ye Yuan could feel the horrifying aura outside.

This punch coming down, him and Ning Tianping would absolutely have no chance of survival!

“Go to hell!”

Xiahou Wenjian laughed savagely, a punch suddenly slamming out.

But right at this time, an enormous palm was sent from the horizon, arriving instantly!

Xiahou Wenjian was currently pleased with himself when suddenly, an irresistible force instantly locked onto him.

His heart plummeted, the punch that was just released was also instantly frozen.

“ARGHHH!”

A despairing scream sounded out.

Bang!

Under a palm, Xiahou Wenjian turned to ashes!

Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping exchanged glances, both seeing the shock in the other party’s eyes.

“Your Excellency, who ... who is this? So strong! Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity, he actually one-shotted him with one palm!” Ning Tianping said in shock.

Ye Yuan said, “The Profound Secrets Pavilion Lord!”

Ning Tianping opened his mouth wide and said, “No way, right? That Profound Secrets Pavilion Lord is at most also merely Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity, right? How can he be so strong?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This palm was not struck out at close range. It was released from countless tens of thousands of miles away!

This kind of means was truly inconceivable!

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “Looks like we all looked down on this Profound Secrets Pavilion Lord! His original strength is at least also at the True God Realm!”

“Little Friend Ye Yuan, take care. This old man won’t be sending you off!” At this time, an aged voice transmitted over from the horizon.

Ye Yuan two people bowed toward the direction of Extreme Light Imperial City.
