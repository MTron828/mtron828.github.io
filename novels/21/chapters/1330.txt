Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Thud!

Wang Yugan’s body fell onto the ground heavily, kicking up a cloud of dust.

“Wang Yugan! Ye Yuan, this ... What’s going on here?”

When Luo Jian saw the dead dog-like Wang Yugan, a look of shock was written all over his face.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, how could he possibly turn Wang Yugan into this manner? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

But the reality happened before his eyes. It was not up to him to not believe.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “You don’t need to bother with what happened. I brought this guy to you to deal with. Want to kill or dismember, it’s up to you.”

Luo Jian looked at Ye Yuan as if he did not recognize the latter.

Still being at the initial-stage Grotto Profound, Ye Yuan’s realm did not have the slightest hint of change.

However, how in the world did he do it?

“S-Spare me! Ye ... Ye Yuan, it ... it was all this old man’s fault! This old man apologizes to you and Luo Jian! As long as you let this old man off, this old man is willing to pay any price!’ Wang Yugan said feebly.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I said just now, everything is up to Brother Luo to decide. If he’s willing to let you go, I have no objections either.”

The one who narrowly escaped death was Luo Jian, Ye Yuan would not make the decision on his behalf.

The reason why he brought Wang Yugan here was in order to let Luo Jian vent his frustrations.

Luo Jian was not a soft-hearted person. He would definitely kill this fellow.

“Luo ...”

He had yet to start pleading for mercy when a streak of cold light flashed past.

A powerful divine essence directly destroyed his life force.

The high and mighty Wang Yugan died just like this.

Luo Jian could not be bothered to be long-winded with him at all. With his personality, he would not be long-winded with the other party either.

“So much crap! This guy was still hoping for me to let him go? Really foolish!” Luo Jian said disdainfully.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “When people reach a hopeless situation, they always hope to live on.”

“If it were me, I definitely wouldn’t plead to live disgracefully!” Luo Jian said coolly.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “How is it? Vented your anger yet?”

Luo Jian nodded and said, “Thoughts are running smoothly, vented the anger! Ye Yuan, how in the world did you do it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I can tell you, but you must help me keep the secret! Even the Tower Lord can’t be told, can you do it?”

Luo Jian’s expression choked up, and he shook his head and said, “Can’t do it! Forget it, you’d better not say. You, kid, are really a freak, made me worry for nothing!”

Luo Jian was very broad-minded though. But it was also precisely because of this that Ye Yuan regarded him even higher.

Ye Yuan could naturally perceive that Luo Jian very much wanted to know what in the world happened. But he did not wish to hide from Yang Rui too. Hence, he forcefully endured asking.

As for Ye Yuan, he naturally did not have the need to hide from Luo Jian. It was just that he knew Luo Jian’s temperament, that was why he did not tell him.

After all, the current Gui Yun was Ye Yuan’s greatest trump card.

“Oh, right, Wang Yutao and Wang Yumin both came. Where are they? They wouldn’t also have ...” Luo Jian suddenly remembered something and asked Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Wang Yumin has already been killed by me. As for Wang Yutao, he must be savoring it greatly right now.”

Luo Jian’s expression changed several times, and he said huffily, “You, this guy, are really a freak!”

Before long, Chang Liang five people rushed over, directly kneeling down in unison when he saw Ye Yuan.

“Many thanks to Your Excellency for granting the wish, letting us take revenge for Number Three and Number Seven! From this day forth, the five of our lives will be sold to Your Excellency! If Your Excellency wants us to head east, we absolutely won’t head west; if Your Excellency wants our lives, us brothers absolutely won’t bat an eyelid!” Chang Liang said.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “What would I want your lives for? You all take these medicinal pills, go back and cultivate well.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan casually threw a small bottle to Chang Liang.

Chang Liang received it and took a look, and involuntarily shuddered all over, crying out in shock, “Your Excellency, this ... this is too precious! We can’t accept it!”

Inside the small bottle was actually divine-grade Divine Essence Pills!

This kind of thing was originally a priceless item in Jewelhill City. Having money could not buy it either.

Ye Yuan’s opening move was 10 pills!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Just a few medicinal pills, it’s not a big deal. Number three and number seven being killed was caused by me in the end. These medicinal pills, just take it as compensation for you all.”

Chang Liang and the rest felt even more inexplicably grateful. He had already been stuck at middle-stage Grotto Profound for many years and kept failing to break through.

With this divine-grade Divine Essence Pill, his breakthrough to late-stage Grotto Profound was already something that happened without extra effort.

Not just him, these few brothers of his, by relying on these divine-grade Divine Essence Pills, they would definitely have a huge advancement too.

“Thank you very much, Your Excellency!” Chang Liang five people were really on all fours in admiration towards Ye Yuan this time.

...

“What did you say? Say it again!”

At the Wang Family’s residence, Wang Lingbo suddenly stood up. He was yelling at a junior managing the ancestral temple.

“Family Head, Second Elder, Third Elder, Fourth Elder, as well as the Wang Family elites who were brought out this time, their soul lamps are all extinguished!’ The junior was grief-stricken as if bereaved of his parents.

The so-called soul lamp was lit with a trace of a martial artist’s soul force, which could reflect the survival status of the martial artist.

Once the soul lamp extinguished, the martial artist was either dead or trapped in some dangerous place.

“How is this possible! The three elders are all grand completion Grotto Profound powerhouses! Who in this Jewelhill City can eradicate all of them in one go!” Wang Lingbo’s entire body trembled as he said.

That junior said with a mournful face: “Family Head, I also suspected that I saw wrongly at first. But I checked several times, their soul lamps are indeed all extinguished!”

Wang Lingbo plopped his bottom back down, his entire person seemed to have lost his soul.

These three great elders were the Wang Family’s backbone strength!

Once they died, the blow to the Wang Family was seriously too great.

There was even a possibility that the Wang Family would never recover from this setback henceforth!

They were to hunt down Ye Yuan. Could it be that ... they all died in Ye Yuan’s hands?

But how was this possible?

Ye Yuan was just an initial-stage Grotto Profound rookie. Even if he had Luo Jian protecting, it was also not possible to make the three great elders perish at the same time, right?

Wang Lingbo could not figure out after racking his brains!

After a long time, he said to the junior despondently, “I got it! This matter must be kept secret! If you dare to leak a word, family punishment awaits!”

The junior hurriedly voiced his assent and took his leave.

Wang Lingbo maintained that sitting posture, sitting the whole night.

Ever since he received the position of family head from Wang Yuxian, it could be said to have been limitless glory.

In the past, there had never been a moment where he was so helpless like now!

Finally, at dawn, a haggard-looking Wang Lingbo got up and slowly walked into a secret underground room that was.

“Father!” Wang Lingbo shouted using a dry voice.

Before long, an aged voice came from inside the secret room, “It’s Lingbo huh? Why? Encountered some issues?”

Wang Lingbo opened his mouth and really did not know how to speak up.

“Mm? This isn’t like your style! Could it be that this time, it was Yang Rui who personally took action?” said the old man.

After a long silence, Wang Lingbo finally plucked up his courage and used a close to teary voice and said, “Father, Second Uncle, Third Uncle, and Fourth Uncle, they all ... they all might have already fallen!”

Boom!

The secret room’s door directly exploded. A gust of strong wind blew out from inside.
