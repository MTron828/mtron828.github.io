Chapter 1399 Limitless Challenge!

“Heh, the few of you are from Wu Meng Capital City, right? What a coincidence. Hand over the storage rings obediently, and then commit suicide!”

Qiao Jie brought along five Heavenly Feather Capital City’s students and surrounded three students from Wu Meng Capital City, with a look of swagger.

Through a few months’ time of wandering around, the majority of the capital cities were all able to gather a group of their own students.

One person fighting alone could not compare to numbers after all.

Apart from this, the relationships between some capital cities were pretty good. They would even cooperate with each other to deal with other capital cities.

Of course, some solitary people would also gather together, forming one small group after another.

All in all, what this Hundred Cities Smelting Trial trained was not just the students’ strength, it was more on their survivability.

Under the circumstances of ensuring that they were not finished off, and finishing off others!

Qiao Jie later inquired from many parties and finally knew that the late-stage Grotto Profound who broke his sword originated from Wu Meng Capital City.

Now, when he saw Wu Meng Capital City’s people, he vented his anger on these people.

“Our Wu Meng Capital City and the Heavenly Feather Capital City each stay in our own lanes. We’ll just hand over the storage rings, why is there a need to pressure people?” said a student from Wu Meng Capital City.

Qiao Jie had a smug look as he said, “Want to blame, blame that fellow called Ye Yuan. Who asked him to provoke Lord Qiao, me?”

“Turns out it’s Ye Yuan! This guy is really a troublemaker!”

“Yeah! This guy went around to stir up trouble at the Wu Meng Academy. I didn’t think that participating in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, he still provoked enemies everywhere!”

“Why doesn’t that guy go and die!”

The moment the three people heard that it was Ye Yuan who attracted the enemy, their temper flared up out of nowhere.

In the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, the biggest taboo was making enemies everywhere. But Ye Yuan provoked enemies everywhere.

But now, they were made to shoulder the blame. This naturally made them very depressed.

“Originally thought that everyone is from the same academy, but you guys are talking bad about me behind my back. What should I do?”

At this time, a leisurely voice sounded out, making everyone get a shock.

Qiao Jie’s expression changed. This voice, he was too familiar with it. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

Sure enough, Ye Yuan brought along a little fatty and appeared before everyone’s eyes.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Qiao Jie instinctively wanted to run. But he instantly saw quite a few fellow disciples around him, and immediately became much braver in his heart.

“Hey, punk, you finally showed up! The score last time, we should settle it properly!” Qiao Jie said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “We should settle it properly! The few of you, hand over your storage rings!”

Qiao Jie sneered coldly and said, “You’re really arrogant! There are six of us today. Could it be that you plan on fighting one-on-six?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So what if one-on-six? Looks like you want me to take action!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan directly unleashed Sundering Stars over.

Qiao Jie’s expression changed drastically. This sword move was no idea how much stronger than that move used to deal with him back then! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Only at this time did he know that Ye Yuan did not use much strength at all back then!

This move of Ye Yuan’s was incomparably fast. Qiao Jie simply could not avoid it.

With strong unwillingness, he crushed the jade pendant.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over the remaining people and said nonchalantly, “You guys want me to take action too? Your strength is even worse than his. If I unleash my sword again, you guys might not have time to crush the jade pendant!”

The remaining five people were all white as a sheet. How could they still dare to resist? They crushed their jade pendants in succession, transporting away.

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned. 20 over storage rings came to his hand.

“Heh, looks like letting that guy off back then was right. This half a year, that guy collected quite a number of storage rings. It saved me quite a bit of trouble,” Ye Yuan said with a satisfied look.

When the Wu Meng Academy’s three people saw Ye Yuan eradicate Qiao Jie six people with a wave of a hand, each and every one of their faces were very ugly.

Ye Yuan never made a move in these six to seven years. They completely did not know how powerful Ye Yuan’s strength was currently.

At that time, Ye Yuan defeated Qin Shao, but he was not powerful to this kind of degree.

This was just six to seven years’ time, and Ye Yuan’s strength was already no longer what it was before!

What was laughable was that they were still talking about him behind his back just now, and yet, it was heard by Ye Yuan.

With this, it was awkward!

“You fools, not taking the side of your own people in this Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, but you actually blamed Ye Yuan! Really stupid! This Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, if you don’t provoke others, will others not come and kill you? Have you all stayed too long in the academy, your brains all gone soft?” Little Fatty came forward and reprimanded those few people.

“This ... We ... We know we were wrong.”

Those few people’s expressions were extremely ugly, but also did not know how they should refute, and could only admit their mistakes.

The current Ye Yuan was already not on the same level as them long ago.

Ye Yuan gave them a glance and said coolly, “Looking on the account of being fellow disciples, you guys leave! But help me do something!”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, the three of them were akin to being granted amnesty, and hurriedly said, “Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, feel free to instruct!”

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “A month later, I’ll accept the challenge of all outer-court disciples at Howless Ridge! No restriction on numbers, no restrictions on methods! You guys help me to spread this news!”

The three people’s expression changed, drawing a cold breath, using dumbfounded gazes to look at Ye Yuan.

This ... was too crazy!

Ye Yuan was going to challenge a hundred cities’ geniuses with his power alone!

“Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, this ... this is ... too risky, right?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Taking the risk or not, don’t need you to worry about it! You just say that I have several hundred storage rings in my hands. As long as they are confident in themselves, they can come and challenge me!”

The three people exchanged glances, all being dumbstruck with amazement by Ye Yuan’s arrogant words.

This Hundred Cities Smelting Trial had been held for no idea how many seasons. No one had even been arrogant to the degree to challenge all of the hundred cities’ elite disciples!

But he, Ye Yuan, did just that!

One had to know that although this smelting trial was called Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, the capital cities taking part were far from just 100 capital cities!

In reality, the cities taking part were close to 200!

Each city had 30 people taking part, which was also close to 6000 people!

According to the one-to-two ratio of inner-court disciples and outer-court disciples, outer-court disciples were close to 4000 people!

These 4000 people were all elites among elites of each capital city. Every single one was a very formidable expert.

But now, Ye Yuan wanted to challenge these 3000 over geniuses with his power alone!

They did not know whether such an action should be called courageous, or seeking death.

When the three people came to their senses, Ye Yuan was already long gone.

“Are ... Are we really going to say that? This guy ... is also a little too crazy, right?”

“But his strength is really powerful! I’ve heard of that Qiao Jie just now before. He’s a Heavenly Feather Capital City’s peerless genius. His strength was probably not beneath Qin Shao’s! Even he couldn’t last past one move under Ye Yuan’s hands!”

“But Ye Yuan said, no restrictions on methods, no restriction on numbers! One person challenging close to 4000 people, just thinking about it is terrifying!”

“Since he said so, we’ll comply with it! Either way, if something happens, it has nothing to do with us either!”
