Chapter 2594: Land of Exile

After all the disturbances, they all became obedient.

For a grand completion ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s heavenly alchemists started cultivating like crazy.

Of course, it was also not aimless cultivation.

Ye Yuan had naturally fumbled out a set of his own methods, having cultivated to the realm of grand completion.

He had long already imparted this set of methods to Lin Lan.

Therefore, the one really teaching them was all Lin Lan.

Without the slightest surprise, the one who broke through to the realm of ninth grade first was precisely Wen Jingxuan.

In fact, she was even faster than the grade three heavenly alchemist, Wu Chengchao!

She only used half a year’s time and broke through from seventh grade to ninth grade!

Of course, Wen Jingxuan already had no need of the grand completion Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, because her affinity was already saturated.

In the end, it only stopped at less than 62 points too. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wen Jingxuan’s talent could be seen at a glance.

The second to break through was precisely Wu Chengchao.

As a grade three heavenly alchemist, his foundation was naturally incomparably solid.

Originally, he already had upper eighth grade strength, breaking through to ninth grade reasonable too.

However, after breaking through to ninth grade, he discovered to his pleasant surprise that when he refined other heavenly pills, there seemed to be some improvement!

Even when refining grade three heavenly pills, he was that tiny bit stronger than before too.

Although it was just that tiny trace, he felt it distinctly!

As for grade two and grade one, this kind of increment was even more obvious.

This discovery made Wu Chengchao wildly ecstatic!

Only at this point did he understand Ye Yuan’s painstaking efforts.

“Elder Ye is really too impressive! You bunch of bastards all keep your chin up for me in the future! Whoever dares to slack off, see if this old man doesn’t break your damn legs!” Wu Chengchao said ferociously in front of everyone.

At this time, he already went from being a skeptic into Ye Yuan’s staunch advocate.

However, only after reaching ninth grade did they realize that this was just a new beginning!

Each tiny bit of improvement of the heavenly pill’s quality was extremely difficult.

Even having a talent as strong as Wen Jingxuan’s, her improvement was very slow too.

It was also precisely after reaching this step did they realize how terrifying Ye Yuan’s strength was.

Ninth grade, almost all could reach it through hard work.

But wanting to improve further, the requirement of talent was close to freakish.

Only at this time did the disparity in talent truly manifested itself.

Wu Chengchao cultivated to middle ninth grade and was unable to advance an inch forward anymore.

Even Wen Jingxuan also stopped advancing after reaching peak upper ninth grade.

She was unable to break through to the realm of grand completion from start to end.

This final step was akin to a heavenly chasm, she could never cross it!

Ye Yuan did not let them continue. He instructed them to switch to cultivating other basic heavenly pills.

With the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill as the foundation, the cultivation speed of other basic heavenly pills was undoubtedly much faster.

It was also precisely under this kind of training that the collective strength of the Alchemist Hall was increasing rapidly.

Coupled with the increase of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill on affinity, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s alchemy path strength had a qualitative leap on the whole!

This sort of thing was naturally not empty talk, but it could absolutely be manifested in the heavenly pills.

The heavenly pills rewarded by the sect improved significantly in terms of quality!

Regardless of whether inner-sect disciples or outer-sect disciples, they sang praises of the medicinal efficacy of the heavenly pills.

A slight tug in one area would affect the situation on the whole!

This way, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s overall strength naturally increased a lot.

With regards to this change in the sect, Feng Xuanyi took it into his sights and was delighted in his heart.

A short few years’ time, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s appearance took on a completely new look!

Of course, Feng Xuanyi understood that this was just the beginning!

Along with the passing of time, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s strength would become stronger and stronger!

It might be able to return to the peak someday!

Feng Xuanyi knew that he had gambled correctly!

“Elder Ye, you’ve made great contributions to the sect! Whatever reward you want, as long as my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect has it, this sect master definitely won’t be stingy!” Feng Xuanyi said with a smile.

“I want the method to condense the divine soul!” When Ye Yuan heard that, he said without hesitation.

To him, nothing was more important than reviving Mu Lingxue.

But Feng Xuanyi smiled bitterly and said, “You’ve stumped me! The method to condense the divine soul is an extremely profound origin divinity mystic art. Hence, our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect doesn’t have one!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he could not help revealing a look of disappointment.

“Then may I ask Sect Master, who is proficient in this origin divinity mystic art on this Rainclear Continent?” Ye Yuan asked.

Five Great Heavenly Regions said, “To talk about who is the most proficient in origin divinity mystic arts in this Five Great Heavenly Regions, it’s naturally the Daycreek Heavenly Region’s Soul Driving Heavenly Sect. This sect’s cultivation method is the most mysterious and unpredictable. Even our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect is extremely apprehensive towards them too!”

Ye Yuan silently remembered the name Soul Driving Heavenly Sect, thinking to himself that when he became stronger, he had to take a trip to that sect.

It was just that at present, it was still increasing his strength that was more urgent.

“Alright, since that’s the case, I want to go to the Land of Exile!” Ye Yuan said.

The expressions of Feng Xuanyi and the rest changed.

“No way! You can’t go to the Land of Exile!” Feng Xuanyi said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan had long expected Feng Xuanyi’s reaction and said with a smile, “Just now, didn’t Sect Master say that whatever the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect has, you definitely won’t be stingy?”

Feng Xuanyi’s face turned black, feeling like he had fallen into a pit.

The Land of Exile was the place where the five great heavenly sects suppressed prisoners.

This Land of Exile was personally built by the Five Light Heavenly Region’s sovereign back then, Zhuo Bufan!

Imprisoned inside were all some extremely violent and wicked people.

Not only were these prisoners powerful, but they were also extremely hostile towards the five great heavenly sects’ disciples.

The reason why the five great heavenly sects made this Land of Exile, the purpose was to provide a place for experience for the disciples.

It was just that the disciples who entered inside rarely made it out alive.

Furthermore, even if they came out alive, some people had drastic changes in temperament too, becoming bloodthirsty and murderous.

Therefore, the number of disciples who went inside to train became fewer and fewer.

However, there were still some bold and strong ones who would enter inside.

But there were few that could come back alive.

If others entered the Land of Exile, Feng Xuanyi naturally could not be bothered to care.

Life and death are up to fate, not experiencing the tempering of blood, how could one possibly become a powerhouse?

But Ye Yuan was different!

He shouldered the heavy burden of Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s resurgence. If he fell in the Land of Exile, the loss to the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect would be too great.

Martial Secure Heavenly Sect could not bear it!

“Other things, this sect master can agree to it; only this matter can’t! You should know how much you mean to the sect!” Feng Xuanyi said.

Ye Yuan said, “My alchemy path understandings have already been imparted to Jingxuan and Lin Lan. With them around, as long as they followed the routine to cultivate, Wu Chengchao might be able to break through to grade four heavenly alchemist. Even if I stay in the sect, it won’t be very useful either.”

But Feng Xuanyi said firmly, “Even if Wu Chengchao can become a grade four heavenly alchemist, he’s unable to replace your position too! There’s no comparison between you and him! This sect master is helming the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect. Could it be that I can’t even see this? There’s no discussion about this matter!”

Finished saying, Feng Xuanyi turned around and left, without leaving any leeway.
