Chapter 3052: Heaven!

“Humph,?boring! Let’s go!” Kong Tan gave a cold snort and brought the fiend race and continued forward.

The feather race and other races also left one after another.

Of course, it was not really boring. Otherwise, they would not have wasted the lesser part of half a year here too.

It was just somewhat sour.

The entire Labyrinth Divine Palace was an independent space.

These heavenly medicines were just in the outermost periphery.

In the distance, the palace towered into the clouds.

Wang Ningyan and the rest left with them. Zhou Xianchen they all could not stay anymore too and bade farewell to Ye Yuan, “Master Ye, we’re going first!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Be careful.”

From the same place, several major forces all advanced and withdrew together.

They were very clear that they had to band up together here. Otherwise, it would be very dangerous.

Only all the way until everyone was done breaking through did Ye Yuan bring Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s group to continue forward.

“Ye Yuan, we have to hurry; otherwise, the benefits will all be taken away by those guys!” Seeing that Ye Yuan was taking his time, Yang Qing said somewhat anxiously.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There are many good things here, but it’s not easy to take them away.”

Yang Qing’s gaze turned intent, and he said,?“Mn??What do you mean?”

Ye Yuan said, “Continuing forward, those old monsters probably wouldn’t be able to hold back one by one, right?”

Yang Qing’s pupils constricted, and he said, “You’re saying that there are Hegemon Realms among them?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Furthermore, there’s quite a few! Otherwise, do you think that I’d have let Kong Tan off easily?”

Yang Qing said in surprise, “This is impossible! Can’t Hegemon Heavenless tell?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That sly old fox is probably happy to see it happen, right? He tossed out the Labyrinth Divine Palace, this major killing move. How can it possibly be just to attract us, these small fries? You wouldn’t think that he’s really finding some successor, right?”

Yang Qing nodded his head blankly and said, “Yeah, I really thought so! Sigh, looks like I was still too naive! He’s a sly old fox; you’re a little fox!”

As they walked, everyone entered a huge garden.

In this place, there were pavilions and terraces, jagged rocks of grotesque shapes, birds tweeting and the flowers fragrant, like an enormous imperial garden.

Everything was quiet and serene.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd!

Someone cried out in surprise, “Hurry up and look! That’s … a chaos heavenly treasure!”

The crowd immediately boiled over with excitement!

“Chaos heavenly treasure! It’s actually a chaos heavenly treasure! I’m rich now!”

“That’s mine! Nobody is allowed to snatch!”

“This place is indeed a treasure trove!?Haha,?maybe I can break through to Hegemon Realm in one stroke!”

… …

Everyone looked over. It was only to see a small and exquisite bell lying quietly in the grass not far away.

The bell was very exquisite, emitting waves of terrifying aura.

That was the aura of a chaos heavenly treasure!

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he immediately shouted, “Stop!”

However, it was already too late!

Although Ye Yuan had supreme prestige among them, riches always moved people’s hearts.

In front of a chaos heavenly treasure, there were always some people who were not calm.

Hundreds of figures pounced toward that bell as if they were crazy.

But, just as they were about to touch the bell, their bodies turned into countless fine powder, dissipating into the wind.

It was as if they had never appeared before.

There were even several origin realm powerhouses among them!

The complexions of the others turned deathly pale.

They did not even know where the attack came from!

This kind of unknown fear made people break out in goosebumps.

“H-Heavenly Saint Ye, what’s going on?” When at a loss, someone finally thought of Ye Yuan.

Very strange, Ye Yuan’s strength was almost at the bottom among them.

But at this time, everyone unwittingly wanted to rely on Ye Yuan.

Fortunately, the vast majority of people respected Ye Yuan from the bottom of their hearts.

He did not speak. These people all did not move.

It was also precisely because of this that they survived.

Otherwise, it would probably have been far more than a few hundred people dead.

Just now, Ye Yuan discovered the anomaly right away and gave a warning.

Many people were originally itching for action, but in the end, they still forcefully held back.

At this time, these people were rejoicing greatly.

Listening to Heavenly Saint Ye’s words was correct!

Ye Yuan did not speak. His brows knitted tightly.

Suddenly, his figure moved, flying toward that bell.

But, just as his hand was about to touch the bell, the bell vanished right before his eyes strangely just like that.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of their eyeballs popped out.

Why was Ye Yuan fine?

Why did the bell disappear?

This imperial garden was overflowing with oddities everywhere!

Ye Yuan did not move. He closed his eyes, carefully feeling the surrounding changes.

Each gust of wind, every trace of heaven and earth spiritual energy.

Those 50 thousand people were silent, watching Ye Yuan quietly, not daring to even breathe loudly.

After a long time, Ye Yuan slowly opened his eyes. Everyone’s hearts tensed up, and they were even more afraid to breathe.

“I think we should have fallen into a grand array!” Ye Yuan uttered shocking words.

“Grand array! How is this possible? We … can’t feel any Formation Dao undulations at all!”

“Heavenly Saint Ye, is there a mistake? I’m a rank nine heavenly formation master too, but I didn’t detect that there’s a grand array in the slightest!”

“If this is a grand array, with so many of us barged inside, wouldn’t we have long died out?”

… …

On a rare occasion, they questioned Ye Yuan.

It was true that they could not feel the traces of a grand array at all.

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “I heard that the Labyrinth Divine Palace had a formation path grandmaster called Hegemon Sevenway. He reached Great Beyond Realm with Formation Dao, his methods being exceedingly formidable! In the Labyrinth Divine Palace battle, when he was seriously wounded, he actually sacrificed himself and refined himself into an unprecedented grand array! This grand array only had one word: ‘Heaven’! He relied on Heaven and exterminated 57 Hegemon Realm powerhouses! Among them, there was even a Great Beyond Realm mighty expert! Presumably, we should have gotten caught in Heaven!”

Everyone drew a breath of cold air from listening.

Exterminating 57 Hegemons with his power alone!

What kind of terrifying divine ability was this!

One had to know that the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven only had 60 over Hegemon Realms.

This Hegemon Sevenway could annihilate Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven with his power alone!

This kind of strength was too terrifying!

How profound was Ye Yuan’s insight in Formation Dao?

But he only detected something amiss in the instant that the bell appeared.

Before this, he was completely clueless!

“The entire Labyrinth Divine Palace is an enormous space. And here, it can be said to be a world within a world! This grand array is superimposed with the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s space, so we didn’t notice it at all. We fell into the grand array! But this grand array is very complicated. It can be said to have already reached the extreme of Formation Dao! The spacetime here is arranged according to Hegemon Sevenway’s will; incomparably complicated.”

“Just now, they triggered the death door, so they were wiped out by the grand array! But, when I went, the death door shifted positions again, so I’m fine. That bell looks like it’s placed on the grass, but actually, it’s simply in another space. Its function is to lure us to step into the death gate! Furthermore, this grand array is different from other grand arrays. It … is alive!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.
