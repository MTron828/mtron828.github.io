Chapter 1855: Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove

On this day, In the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range ten thousand miles north-east of Thousand Soar Imperial Capital suddenly, it suddenly erupted with rays of brilliant light.

Four enormous phantoms rose into the sky; extremely dazzling. They could be seen clearly within the boundary of the entire Thousand Soar Imperial Capital.

Looking closely, these four phantoms were the extremely rare Four Symbols Divine Beasts of the Heavenspan World.

Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise!

The energy undulation that the four phantoms stirred up surges in tempestuous waves, practically sweeping through the boundary of the entire Thousand Soar Imperial Capital.

It was not the Thousand Soar Imperial Capital itself, but the entire scope that the Thousand Soar Imperial Capital had jurisdiction over, including all of the imperial cities, capital cities, as well as counties.

Its power could be seen at a glance.

Right at this time, the Four Symbols Divine Beasts’ mouths each spewed out a ray of light, converging in the air.

In the center, an old man’s virtual image gradually formed.

“This old man is Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove who accidentally died in this place. My power had no successors, casting it away is a pity. Hence, I laid down this immortal abode, hoping to find a successor to inherit my mantle!”

This voice spread out akin to rolling thunder. Everyone could clear it clearly.

Inside Thousand Soar Imperial Capital, when Ye Yuan heard this voice, his entire person was akin to being thunderstruck.

It turned out that the thing Dustless said that was related to them was actually Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove!

“It’s him! It’s indeed him! Haha, that old man actually buried himself here!”

Inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, Dustless started laughing crazily.

Looking at that strapping figure that was akin to that of a god, Ye Yuan was speechless for a long time.

This was Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove?

Indeed unparalleled and overbearing!

Even choosing a successor actually made it so that everyone knew about it too.

Beside Ye Yuan, Leng Qiuling’s pair of beautiful eyes was also swiveling non-stop. Clearly, she was very moved too.

Empyrean powerhouse!

In the entire Heavenspan World, Empyrean powerhouses were absolutely a nuke-level existence[1].

Just as how Divine Lord Realm stopped the vast majority of martial artists, Empyrean, this threshold, similarly stopped countless peerless geniuses.

In the entire Heavenspan World, True God powerhouses were as plentiful as oxen hair. But among them, a million people might not be able to produce an Empyrean powerhouse too!

True God to Empyrean was an insurmountable great mountain. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The entire Thousand Soar Imperial Capital was seething with excitement. Virtually all the martial artists were raring to have a go. There were even quite a few people who already sprinted out of the imperial capital, heading for Heavenly Sun Mountain Range.

Such an opportunity was hard to encounter once in a million years!

However, Ye Yuan’s brows knitted together.

What medicine was this Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove selling in his gourd?

“Why? Brother Ye doesn’t seem to be that interested in this opportunity that comes only once in a lifetime!”

Ye Yuan’s reaction was somewhat outside of Leng Qiuling’s expectations.

The inheritance of an Empyrean powerhouse, that was something that everyone yearned for in their sleep, but Ye Yuan’s brows were tightly locked.

Even with her, Leng Qiuling’s, cold personality, she was somewhat moved. But Ye Yuan had a very disinterested appearance.

Ye Yuan was taken aback when he heard that and said smilingly, “Of course I’m interested. It’s just that I feel that it’s rather fishy.”

Leng Qiuling’s beautiful eyes moved and she asked curiously, “Fishy?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This senior said that he’s looking for a successor, but he doesn’t have any requirements regarding bone age, cultivation realm, talent, and whatever. Also, this senior reported his own name, like he’s afraid that his enemies don’t know about it. Isn’t this strange?”

Leng Qiuling was also surprised when she heard that. Hearing Ye Yuan said so, it really divulged peculiarity everywhere.

Normally, when looking for a successor, one would have extremely high requirements for natural endowments.

The successor of an Empyrean powerhouse was even high until it made people’s scalps tingle.

Thousand Soar Imperial Capital was merely a True God level force. But their requirement for disciples also reached Leng Qiuling’s level

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was a peak Empyrean peerless powerhouse. If he was really seeking a successor, how could he possibly not have any stipulations about this at all?

Of course, Ye Yuan also did not say one thing, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s inheritance was practically all left behind in the Immortal Grove World. Apart from an Empyrean spirit treasure, the rest were all obtained by him.

Then, what was the inheritance here?

Leng Qiuling’s pair of beautiful eyes sized Ye Yuan up non-stop like it was her first time knowing Ye Yuan.

She discovered that Ye Yuan was really an enigmatic character.

His wisdom, his talent, it really made the so-called geniuses perspire with shame.

Among them included herself.

More than ten years already passed in a blink. Ye Yuan’s realm rose rapidly and already reached peak Second Firmament Celestial Deity, while she only cultivated to middle-stage Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity.

Presently, if Ye Yuan fought with her again, he could already fight to a draw.

This kind of improvement speed simply made people’s scalps tingle.

“Staring at me like that for what? Are there flowers on my face?” Ye Yuan was stared at by Leng Qiuling until he felt a little crept out and said smilingly.

Leng Qiuling smiled and said, “Facing an Empyrean legacy, you can still maintain such composure. I’m afraid that in the entire Thousand Soar Imperial Capital, it’s also just you alone.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There’s no harm in thinking more when encountering things. The more tempting the thing, the more it tends to conceal danger at the back.”

Leng Qiuling ruminated on this sentence, feeling that it was very logical.

The demise of many powerhouses was because they could not resist temptation.

Except, facing such an inheritance, how many people could be calm?

Leng Qiuling looked around and discovered that each person was incomparably feverish as if this legacy was already an item in their bags.

“In that case, you don’t plan on getting involved in these muddied waters?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Haha, this is an Empyrean legacy, how can I possibly let it go?”

When Leng Qiuling heard that, she could not resist rolling her eyes. This guy said so much, it was equivalent to not saying anything.

But she saw Ye Yuan suddenly say solemnly, “Qiuling, you go and tell your master. It’s best to be on the alert, but don’t take action first. Wait and see. This Empyrean abode is probably not that easy to enter.”

After more than ten years, Ye Yuan and Leng Qiuling already became good friends.

As for Leng Qiuling’s master, he was also Thousand Soar Imperial Capital’s ruler.

Leng Qiuling was slightly surprised, but still nodded and said. “Okay, I’ll go and find Master straight away. It’s just ... don’t know if he will listen or not.”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Ten days! You have him wait 10 days! Within 10 days, there will definitely be an unforeseen event that happens.”

Leng Qiuling nodded slightly, turned around, and left.

...

“Master, could it be that ... you’re going to go to that Empyrean abode?”

When Leng Qiuling rushed to Thousand Soar Mansion, her master just happened to exit seclusion.

Looking at his appearance, it looked like he was setting off.

Leng Qiuling secretly thought what a close shave, a step later and Master would have left.

Leng Qiuling’s master, Gu Tianque, Seventh Firmament True God peerless powerhouse, and also Thousand Soar Imperial Capital’s ruler.

Toward Leng Qiuling this disciple, Gu Tianque naturally regarded her with special respect.

“Huhu, this is a huge opportunity that comes once in a lifetime! Thousand Soar Imperial Capital is in a favorable position, this benefit mustn’t be snatched away by others!”

Immortal Grove’s might, as a Seventh Firmament True God, Gu Tianque could feel it distinctly.

This Empyrean was absolutely not an average Empyrean powerhouse, but a high-level Empyrean powerhouse.

With Gu Tianque’s talent, barring no accidents, it was very hard to have another breakthrough in this lifetime.

Now, such a huge lucky chance suddenly popped out, how could he not be moved?

But Leng Qiuling shook her head and said, “Master, this Empyrean abode, you can’t go!”
