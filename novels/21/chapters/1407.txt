1411 Heavenly Dao Rejection

“Qin Tian, have you thought it over? This mission that Ye Yuan chose isn’t simple. It’s said that the strongest person in that Sky Foothill World’s Sky Foothill Divine Palace is a grand completion Origin Deity powerhouse! Once your outsider identity is exposed, you’ll suffer endless pursuit!”

Inside a Wu Meng Academy’s secret room, Qin Tianning and Qin Tian sat opposite each other. Qin Tianning warned Qin Tian with a solemn look.

When Qin Tianning learned that what Ye Yuan was carrying out was the Sky Foothill World’s mission, he got a shock too.

The difficulty of the Sky Foothill World’s mission, he was aware. The mortality rate was very high.

Ye Yuan, a newcomer, actually challenged such a dangerous world. It was seriously out of his expectations.

Along with it, he also became somewhat worried about Qin Tian’s safety.

Qin Tian was the Qin Family’s number one genius, the only candidate for the next family head.

If some accident happened to him, the Qin Family could not bear it.

However, Qin Tian had a decisive appearance as he said calmly, “Ye Yuan already became my mental demon. Not killing him, I may never be able to step into the Divine Lord Realm in this life!”

Qin Tianning was deeply aware of the terror of mental demons and said with a nod, “It’s too bad that Origin Deity Realms can’t enter the Sky Foothill World. Otherwise, their identities will be revealed very quickly and suffer the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s pursuit. Entering the Sky Foothill World, everything can only be up to you!”

Qin Tian nodded and said, “I have a score in my heart! Ye Yuan’s greatest reliance is that late-stage two-star evil spirit and sword maneuvering flight. After entering the Sky Foothill World, there isn’t the Heavenspan World’s spatial suppression and I can fly too! At that time, all the things he relies on don’t exist at all in front of me! However I want to kill him, I’ll kill him!”

Although Qin Tian hated Ye Yuan but was not a reckless person.

If there isn’t absolute certainty, he would not take this risk.

After all, in Qin Tian’s view, his life was much more valuable than Ye Yuan’s.

He, Qin Tian, was an existence who would step into Divine Lord Realm in the future.

While Ye Yuan was destined to be a wisp of a deceased soul under his sword!

...

At Sky Foothill World’s borders, above the void, a majestic World Locking Gate slowly manifested itself.

A tiny figure shuttled out of the World Locking Gate, stopping above the vast sea.

“I really didn’t expect that the Heavenspan World still has Stable Wind Needle, this kind of divine artifact, capable of moving freely in a spatial storm! Back then, If I were to have such a magic treasure, why would I be injured so miserably?”

The one who came through the World Locking Gate was precisely Ye Yuan.

Before he came, he got two divine artifacts called Stable Wind Needle from a teacher in the academy’s Artifact Refining Hall.

Using this Stable Wind Needle to shuttle back and forth in a spatial storm, one could actually shield against those violent spatial turbulent flows, letting him arrive at the opposite short safe and sound.

This involuntarily made Ye Yuan recall the scene of escaping by a hair’s breadth in the spatial storm back then.

If he had this Stable Wind Needle in his hands back then, it would not be to the extent of being so miserable either.

“The Heavenspan World’s artifact refining methods are what the small worlds’ people cannot imagine. But Stable Wind Needle, this thing, is strictly controlled in the hands of capital cities, this level of forces. Once discovered in the outside world, they will immediately be sentenced to capital punishment! The Stable Wind Needle is just a one-time consumable. You’ll only be given two when you’re carrying out the mission to avoid it falling into outsiders’ hands,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Looks like I need to get more of those divine artifacts. Otherwise, it will really be quite troublesome to want to search for the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone in the future.”

While talking, a series of air bubbles suddenly emerged in the ocean.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Several hundred fish-shaped monsters came out of the water, pouncing crazily towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed. His aura surged, rippling out.

Puu, puu, puu ...

Those fish-shaped monsters’ bodies directly exploded into clouds of blood mist under this terrifying undulation.

“Mere Tier 9 demonic beasts also dare to attack me. Really overestimating your own ability!” Ye Yuan said disdainfully.

But right at this time, another three fish-shaped monsters came out of the water!

These three auras were clearly much stronger compared to those previously. It was shockingly a rank one divine beast!

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Three streaks of sword light burst forth without any signs, akin to a squall, shredding those three monsters into pieces without the slightest sluggishness.

“Senior, what’s going on? I didn’t provoke them!” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

Ye Yuan was just standing there quietly and did not provoke anyone, but these fierce beasts unleashed attacks at him without heed for their lives. This made Ye Yuan very perplexed.

“Back then, when those fiend race powerhouses entered the Immortal Grove World, they suffered Immortal Grove Heavenly Dao’s repulsion. Now, you’re the outsider to the Sky Foothill World! Those fierce beasts’ intelligence has yet to be unlocked. Their actions are entirely based on instincts and are the most sensitive to external forces,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan felt his head swell and he said, “Doesn’t that mean that I’ll be exposed very easily?”

Dustless nodded and said, “That’s right! The aura on your body is incongruous with Sky Foothill World’s Heavenly Dao. Deity Realm powerhouses can identify it very easily. Furthermore, the stronger the attacks you exhibit, the stronger the Heavenly Dao’s suppression! If not because of this, this mission’s death rate naturally wouldn’t be so high either.”

Ye Yuan fell silent. He had really never considered this problem before.

But now, it became a very troublesome matter.

The Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones, this kind of precious natural treasure, would probably be monopolized by the Sky Foothill Divine Palace. No matter how careful he was, it was also impossible to avoid their investigation.

Those trial-takers who entered in the past were all late-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses. There were even powerhouses at Qin Tian’s level.

But their auras were too obvious. Once they clashed with the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s powerhouses, it was basically no return.

Hence, that was why this mission was designated as a three-star difficulty mission. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “Senior, could it be that there’s no way?”

Dustless shook his head and said, “Forget about you, even Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove enters a small world, he’d be rejected by Heavenly Dao too! Unless, you can obtain this Sky Foothill World’s Dao Fruit, or, you can be like with the Immortal Grove World, obtaining this Sky Foothill World’s Heavenly Dao’s recognition.”

Ye Yuan could not help losing all hope when he heard that. This way, wanting to obtain the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone was really bleak!

Ye Yuan fell silent, falling into hard thinking.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up, giving rise to enlightenment in his heart.

Ye Yuan’s figure moved, directly vanishing above the sea.

When he appeared again, he already arrived in an enormous forest.

Ye Yuan searched for an open space, sat down cross-legged, and started revolving the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, communicating with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan’s body suddenly emitted a sacred aura. The World Suppressing Stele flew straight out of Ye Yuan’s body, suspending above his head.

A pale-white light halo poured down, enveloping Ye Yuan’s body.

Seeing this scene, Dustless’s entire body involuntarily shuddered, his gaze revealing astonishment.

“This kid is really too talented! To be able to achieve this step, there’s probably only him alone since time immemorial, right?” said Dustless who was shocked to the core.
