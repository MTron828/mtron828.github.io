Chapter 2148: First Blossom of Chaos!

Inside the Dragon Eye Cave, the faces of Long Xiaochun and the rest revealed the joy of having survived a disaster.

The explosion was too violent, Long Xiaochun crushed quite a few jade slips in a row and teleported to the furthest spatial node before barely managing to avoid the power of the explosion.

Even so, each and every one of them was also made dusty and dirty in appearance, seemingly very ragged.

“L-Lord Xiaochun, the commotion that Lord Ye caused is a little too big, right?” Long Xun said with lingering fear in his heart.

“Too terrifying! Even if a Heavenly Emperor is in the center of the explosion, they would probably also die without any corpse left, right? Lord Ye wouldn’t ... He wouldn’t have ...” Long Zhaotian’s complexion turned white as he said.

“Shut up!”

Long Xiaochun directly interrupted Long Zhaotian’s follow-up words and said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan must still be alive!”

The others were silent like cicadas in winter, but reason told them that Ye Yuan’s hopes of survival were virtually none.

One had to know, Ye Yuan was in the center of the explosion. Such a horrifying explosion, how could it be possible to survive?

“The explosion has subsided. Let’s go over and take a look!” Long Xiaochun had a rarely-seen serious expression as she said.

... ...

“This is my own world?”

Amidst the region of chaos, Ye Yuan’s consciousness overlooked the world, his heart surging.

All the way until today, he finally created a world that belonged to him.

This stretch of chaos was boundless and gray, without the slightest signs of life. Furthermore, it was even expanded outwards at an extremely fast speed, becoming larger and larger.

“My world is only born a full three major realms later than others. Looking at this, it seems to be somewhat different from the rest!” Ye Yuan looked at this stretch of chaos as he muttered.

Even though Ye Yuan did not go through Divine Lord Realm before, having spent so long in the Heavenspan World, the powerhouses that he had seen before were countless and he was not foreign to hewing open a world.

When martial artists reached Divine Lord Realm, they needed to have a point singularity of the Heavenspan World as a foundation, expanding and developing, creating their own world.

Putting it bluntly, this Heavenspan World had countless powerhouses that created countless small worlds, but they were all based on the Heavenspan World and were an extension of the Heavenspan World.

Including East Suppression Pseudo World this kind of powerful pseudo worlds, it was also a part of the Heavenspan World in the end.

But Ye Yuan’s method of breaking through was totally different.

His world was entirely created by himself!

No point singularity, no time, and also no space.

This stretch of chaos was a brand new world!

When chaos blossomed initially, heaven and earth were not divided. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Everything was a wilderness awaiting development; a blank piece of paper.

How this world would develop in the future completely depended on him.

This kind of control was not restricted by the Heavenspan World!

Ye Yuan could feel that this world seemed to be two parallel worlds from the Heavenspan World, neither interfering with the other.

And it was not the same as the other small worlds, being an extension of the Heavenspan World.

Furthermore, the chaos spiritual energy of Ye Yuan’s world was incomparably thick. It was even thousands, tens of thousands of times thicker than the Heavenspan World’s spiritual energy!

Even if there was thinning in the future, it could also reach the Heavenspan World’s level.

Other small worlds, such as the Immortal Grove World, the spiritual energy inside was drastically diluted, the amount extremely low.

Hence, it was even harder than trying to ascend to the heavens for martial artists to want to break through the shackles and arrive at the Heavenspan World.

Even a colossal pseudo world like the East Suppression Pseudo World was a shade inferior when compared to the Heavenspan World too.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was deep as he slowly said, “I seem to ... have understood something! Looks like the path that I’m taking is a true path that leads to the highest heaven! They are unable to fuse essence, energy, and spirit three paths because their path is fundamentally wrong! Their path relies on the Heavenspan World. So how can they break the shackles of the Heavenspan World? Even if it’s the Dao Ancestors, they are merely a powerful life-form in this Heavenspan World too, never able to transcend! But for me to be able to walk to this step, it’s still all thanks to the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!”

Cultivating the Chaos Heavenspan Canon until today, experiencing countless hardships, Ye Yuan finally created his own world.

Even though this world was still very small, being not even as large as a Divine Lord Realm’s small world, Ye Yuan’s world was a thousand times, ten thousand times stronger than Heavenly Emperor Realms in terms of quality.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s world had limitless possibilities!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s thoughts stirred. A figure appeared in Ye Yuan’s world, it was precisely Dustless!

When Dustless saw this world that was merely a thousand feet in radius, he was shocked until his eyes went wide and he was tongue-tied.

“This ... This is your world? T-Too inconceivable!” Dustless said with a sigh of admiration.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Before breaking through the realm, I was also unable to imagine that my world would actually be like this!”

Dustless muttered, “Wrong! Turns out that the world was wrong! Divine Lord hewing open a world, Empyrean controlling a world, Heavenly Emperor dominating the world, turns out that ... it was all wrong! Ye Yuan, your path is the true great path that leads to the highest heaven!”

Dustless watched Ye Yuan walked over step by step, carrying confusion, carrying uncertainty, carrying limitless hardships!

But now, the fact finally proved that the path Ye Yuan took was correct!

This world was a world that Dustless had never seen before.

Just one glance and he saw through the extraordinary aspects of this world.

“Being able to walk until this step today is still all thanks to Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove! If not for him, if not for the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, I can only fade into the crowd as well.” Ye Yuan said with an emotional sigh.

But Dustless shook his head and said, “That’s not it! It’s foreordained by heaven! Do you still remember the words that Immortal Grove said before dying?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly. Immortal Grove had once said before dying that the meaning of his existence was Ye Yuan’s birth!

“The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s masters isn’t just you alone! But regardless of whether it was Immortal Grove or Fang Tian, they both did not take this step. Immortal Grove had outstanding talent and comprehended Dao in front of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain for several million years and is also less than a fraction of you! It was not that he can’t make it, but it was that ... you’re too strong! You’re the person that Heavenly Dao chose!” Dustless said with somewhat of an upsurge of emotion.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “A heart that yearns for Dao. I’ve never changed before. But my greatest wish right now is still being able to revive Lingxue!”

Dustless said, “Silly child, you’ve already done sufficiently well! 2000 years of comprehending Dao, hewing open a new world, who could do it? However, this new realm of yours isn’t Heavenly Empyrean. So how should it be called?”

Ye Yuan’s path was a brand new path, the realm was naturally different.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Now that the chaos has just bloomed, call it Chaos Realm then!”

Feeling the berserk spiritual energy amidst the chaos, Dustless could not help laughing as he said, “Chaos Realm, rather fitting! But after today, the spiritual energy that your cultivation requires will be horrifying!”

Ye Yuan also smiled bitterly and said, “This is also something that can’t be helped. If not for leaving Lu-er the ten-year agreement, I really can’t bear to leave this place!”

From entering the Dragon Eye Cave until now, it had been 10 years.

Ye Yuan was scared that Lu-er they all were worried, so that was why he chose to break through at this juncture.

He knew that Lu-er probably had a rough time these ten years.

Rather, his realm advanced by leaps and bounds these ten years, directly breaking through to Chaos Realm from Seventh Firmament Origin Pill Realm!

Towards this great gift that Long Chi gave him, Ye Yuan really could not quite bear to leave!

At this time, Ye Yuan’s thoughts stirred, and he said with a smile, “Mn? The nirvanic tribulation is also transcended already, my fleshy body also broke through to rank seven!”
