Chapter 1524 Why Don“t . . . I“ll Give It a Try Too

“Mn? What’s going on? This Source Night actually still isn’t admitting defeat?”

“They still want to fight again! Could it be that Source Night still has some trump card?”

“You all look at the guardian’s state, it seems to be a bit off!”

...

The current Zheng Jian entered a kind of mysterious state.

Ye Yuan was too familiar with this state. It was precisely the Selfless Realm that he had entered twice!

A dangerous aura hit him head-on, making Ye Yuan feel a chill run down his spine.

“No wonder he dares to claim to be invincible in the same realm! He can actually enter the Selfless Realm at any time!” Ye Yuan exclaimed.

But at this time, Dustless’s voice sounded out in Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, “This isn’t the perfect state Selfless Realm. It’s just a critical state between the Selfless Realm and reality. Furthermore, this state is only applicable to battles. It can let the martial artist unleash strength beyond normal levels when fighting!”

“Hiss ...”

Ye Yuan sucked in a cold breath, not expecting that there was still such a martial technique.

“This is his 100% combat power? Indeed powerful!” Ye Yuan muttered.

“This move is developed by experiencing endless tempering before one can fuse a trace of Heavenly Dao into their own heart realm. It has to be someone with great fortitude to achieve it. This person was definitely a powerhouse whose fame shook a region when he was alive!” Dustless said.

Even with Dustless’s high standards, he viewed Zheng Jian in a different light too.

Although this person’s talent in martial arts could not compare to Ye Yuan’s, it was also not far away.

“It came! So fast!”

Ye Yuan was alarmed inwardly. Zheng Jian turned into an afterimage, charging over towards him.

Two short swords resembled two sharp fangs, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, and charging over towards Ye Yuan.

“Origin Magnetic Field, open! Misty Sword Art!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry. The Misty Sword Art was displayed once more. At the same time, a powerful gravitational field instantly descended.

This came suddenly. Zheng Jian’s figure suddenly stopped, becoming much slower all of a sudden.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

The two people exchanged several dozen sword moves. Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly changed.

Swish!

Zheng Jian’s short sword suddenly accelerated, slashing a wound on Ye Yuan’s arm.

Ye Yuan’s figure retreated explosively. But Zheng Jian was unrelenting, following after.

The Origin Magnetic Field that had never failed actually only had an effect for one breath, and it was cracked by Zheng Jian. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

His sharp sword light directly tore a gap in the Origin Magnetic Field, slicing the forcefield into pieces.

Zheng Jian’s power of laws was too strong, far from what the current Ye Yuan could compare to.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.

Ye Yuan exhausted all of his strength, his figure shuttling through space non-stop, and could only barely protect his vital areas.

But the wounds on his body were increasing continuously.

Zheng Jian who was under the state of the Selfless Realm was too strong.

That kind of battle instinct was virtually unleashed by him to the limit.

This had an all-round increase to his combat strength.

This kind of feeling was like when Ye Yuan dealt with the clone back then.

After he entered the Selfless Realm, the clone completely became the target to trample on in front of him.

“So strong! That guardian is simply akin to a different person than from before. What in the world happened? Clearly still the same sword art, same movement technique, but why is it so strong?” Ba Tu said in horror.

In this place, those who could slightly observe the two people’s battle traces were just the Eminent Orchid Six Sons.

Ba Tu they all watched the projection with unmoving eyes, not daring to miss anything.

Because as long as they were distracted momentarily, they would not be able to keep up with the two people’s tempo anymore.

But he could feel that Zheng Jian’s strength suddenly soared, becoming a fighting madman.

Ye Yuan’s situation was becoming worse and worse.

Di Fan also watched very close and said in a solemn voice, “He seems to have entered a kind of strange state. Seems like ... the Selfless Realm!”

Ba Tu’s expression changed and he said in shock, “Selfless Realm? This ... This isn’t possible, right? The Selfless Realm can be encountered, but cannot be hoped for. Can one casually enter it?”

Di Fan’s expression was solemn as he said, “Selfless Realm naturally can’t be casually entered. But I heard that going through special training, one can train fighting instinct to a critical state! Under this critical state, it practically has the effect of Selfless Realm and can magnify one’s strength infinitely. Most likely, that guardian is in this state.”

Ba Tu was dumbfounded with shock when he heard and said in alarm, “There’s actually still such a thing? If ...”

“No if! Disregarding that the people who know this kind of training method are extremely few, just this training’s terror is what ordinary people can’t bear at all. Out of a thousand people, it’s already very impressive to have one survive. This round guardian must have been a madman back then too!” Di Fan interrupted Ba Tu’s words and said solemnly.

“Hiss ...”

Ba Tu drew a cold breath when he heard. This kind of training method was truly too terrifying.

“Looks like Source Night is somewhat in danger. Now, even if he wants to stop, it likely won’t work anymore too,” Ba Tu said emotionally.

The pangs of sharp pain coming from his body made Ye Yuan even more awake instead.

“Selfless Realm, is it? Why don’t ... I give it a try too!”

Ye Yuan had the experience of entering Selfless Realm twice before. There was also nearly entering Selfless Realm one time.

A genius who understood the Selfless Realm more than him, one probably could not find a second one in this world.

Now, he was forced by Zheng Jian to the limits. Even the Origin Magnetic Field was instantly disintegrated.

The only method he could think of to resolve it was to enter the Selfless Realm.

But Selfless Realm could not be entered at will.

Entering the Selfless Realm required very harsh timings.

The last time, Ye Yuan only narrowly entered Selfless Realm under the state of imminent death.

At this time, Ye Yuan completely opened up his mind, carefully savoring the state of entering Selfless Realm the last two times.

This way, he would not be able to focus fully on dealing with Zheng Jian’s attacks. The injuries on his body became more and more concentrated.

Heavenly Dao!

Selfless Realm was conforming to Heavenly Dao!

How could it only conform to Heavenly Dao?

Ye Yuan emptied himself, adjusting his state of mind bit by bit under this kind of extreme state.

“Source Night can’t hold on anymore! Within a hundred moves, life and death will likely be decided!” Di Fan’s words carried some melancholy.

After all, Source Night’s talent broadened their horizons.

He did not expect that Ye Yuanscrewed himself over.

A hundred moves sounded a lot. But to Ye Yuan and Zheng Jian, it was merely several breaths of time.

Their attacks were too quick, swift to the point where ordinary people could not catch it at all.

“You’re dead!” Zheng Jian’s voice was akin to a death-hastening talisman, sounding in Ye Yuan’s ear.

Although he was in a critical state, he still retained his consciousness.

This voice was announcing Ye Yuan’s death.

Zheng Jian’s short sword was akin to a bolt of lightning, stabbing toward Ye Yuan’s heart.

Swish!

Zheng Jian only felt pain on his body. He was actually hurt!

Zheng Jian’s heart sunk. This was Ye Yuan’s first time striking his body!

His certain-kill blow was actually dodged by Ye Yuan and he even left behind a scar on his body?

Zheng Jian suddenly felt something in his heart, his gaze revealing great astonishment.

“Selfless Realm!”
