Chapter 2378: Senior is Going to the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace!

“Investigate! Even if you dig three feet below the ground, you also have to find them for me!”

At the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace, Palace Lord Originbright was unbelievably furious.

Three months had already passed, the southern border’s dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces were destroyed by someone.

But they did not find even a trace of inkling.

Originbright could not understand no matter how he thought. A faction that could destroy dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces in three months, how could they possibly not leave any clues behind at all?

These dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces seemed to have evaporated into thin air.

Just the divine race’s experts had a thousand people who died!

One had to know, those were all late-stage Eight-marks mighty experts!

This kind of loss had never appeared before in tens of millions of years to the divine race.

The incident this time was too big. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The subordinate said gloomily, “But, Your Excellency, this matter ... have no way to get started with the investigations! The Sentry Celestial Palaces that were destroyed, not only was everyone killed, even all the precious information inside the Sentry Celestial Palaces was also completely erased by people.”

Originbright’s expression was grim until it was almost about to drip water. He said in a cold voice, “Didn’t this matter start from the Skysouth region? Then start investigating from the Skysouth region! Go and question one sect after another. Can’t find out, kill for me! Still can’t, then destroy for me! Destroy one sect after another! Either way, the propagation ability of these ants is extremely strong and can’t be killed off. I want to see whether they are scared of death or not!”

“Yes!”

“Also, pass this matter back to the clan. Ask Celestial Master Miluo to divine it! I keep feeling that this incident is somewhat unusual!”

“Yes!”

Very soon, a sanguinary suppression was set off in the Skysouth region.

The divine race investigated the whole story of the Sentry Celestial Palaces in an extremely violent manner.

Several major sects had their sects destroyed because they could not find out anything!

For some time, everyone felt imperiled.

Of course, the more frightened one was naturally still the Ziwei Sect.

The Ziwei Sect’s status was not considered high in Skysouth. It was not their turn for a while.

But the incident this time, the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace sent out a lot of manpower.

Checking until the Ziwei Sect was also just a matter of time.

In the Ziwei Sect, voices of discontent were heard everywhere.

“That guy only knows how to kill to his heart’s content, but he put us in a dangerous situation!”

“Too irresponsible! This guy poked a hole in the sky, but wants us to bear the consequences!”

“Sect Master, we should go and report that kid! As long as we turn him over, the matter this time should be considered over! Otherwise, we’ll face a catastrophic disaster!”

... ...

In Ziwei Sect’s main hall, there were complaints about Ye Yuan everywhere.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s action of destroying the Sentry Celestial Palace, they previously still felt delighted.

But now, facing the divine race’s bloody revenge, they could not feel happy anymore.

Hearing these words, Mo Qingshan said with a gloomy look, “Report? Is your brain broken? You’re going to tell the disciples that the divine envoy died in our Ziwei Sect? Or are you going to tell divine race that our Ziwei Sect’s disciple is bringing that kid around everywhere to destroy Sentry Celestial Palaces?”

The expression of the elder who spoke previously had an embarrassed expression on his face.

He blurted it out previously without running it through his brain.

Now, hearing Mo Qingshan said it, he discovered that there was no way to whistle-blow at all!

Not saying, the Ziwei Sect might still survive.

Saying it, they would die without a doubt!

Just as everyone was at a loss on what to do, a weak voice suddenly sounded out in the hall.

“Martial Uncles, I think ... I should be able to guess why that Senior did this.”

Everyone looked over. It was the Mo Xiaocao who was sitting in the corner.

Mo Xiaocao was also one of Ziwei Sect’s geniuses, her cultivation talent extremely high.

Therefore, she had the qualifications to sit in this main hall too.

Mo Qingshan looked at his daughter rather surprisedly. He knew that his daughter had always been very clever. She might have some brilliant insights this time.

“Xiaocao, tell us about it!” Mo Qingshan said.

Mo Xiaocao nodded slightly and said, “Firstly, Senior destroying so many Sentry Celestial Palaces might be to save our Ziwei sect! Everyone, don’t get agitated. Listen to Xiaocao slowly tell you. If he didn’t destroy the Skysouth Sentry Celestial Palace, our Ziwei Sect will definitely be exterminated. But just destroying the Skysouth Sentry Celestial Palace, investigating until the Ziwei Sect is still not difficult! But if dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces are destroyed in a row, and no traces are revealed at all, it would be virtually impossible to investigate until our Ziwei Sect.”

Originally, hearing this opinion of saving the Ziwei Sect, everyone wanted to refute it.

But, after hearing Mo Xiaocao’s analysis, everyone thought about it. It was really the case.

Someone questioned, “But why did he do things to this extent for our Ziwei Sect?”

A hint of brilliance flashed across in Mo Xiaocao’s eyes and she said, “Naturally, it’s because of Qin Chao! I can tell that Senior admires Qin Chao very much! Of course, he originally never planned on implicating our Ziwei Sect either. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have said to have us abduct him to the Sentry Celestial Palace.”

The others exchanged glances, abashed expressions suddenly revealing on their faces.

Mo Xiaocao’s analysis was very reasonable.

He was thinking of how to save them, but they were grumbling about him here, and they even wanted to report him.

Mo Xiaocao continued, “Of course, Senior’s intention is probably not merely just so!”

Mo Qingshan’s gaze flickered slightly and he said, “What other intention does he still have?”

Mo Xiaocao said, “A shot arrow has no way of recalling! Since this matter has started, it can’t be settled anymore already! Therefore, this senior should be deliberately making a big deal out of things and making everyone know about it! He wants to tell us that the divine race isn’t invincible. He wants to awaken everyone’s hot-bloodedness and have everyone join forces to deal with the divine race together!”

Talking up to here, Mo Xiaocao’s face also revealed a hint of respect and said, “This senior doesn’t look old, but his breadth of vision is bigger than the sky! He, is genuinely thinking about humanity’s future!”

At this time, Mo Qingshan slowly stood up. Everyone could not help being taken aback,

“Sect Master, what are you doing?”

Mo Qingshan said, “I feel that what Xiaocao said is very reasonable! I’ll go and pay a visit to the various sects’ sect masters and hope that they can unite and deal with the divine race together!”

Actually, there was no need for Mo Qingshan to take the lead. The divine race’s sanguinary suppression already made the various major sects unable to sit still anymore.

This time, the divine race was clearly extremely furious.

Therefore, they did not have the slightest scruples when taking action too.

The moment they killed, it was in droves.

In their eyes, these sect disciples were simply a bunch of lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

Not happy, they would just kill!

Hence, the leaders of these sects came to an agreement very quickly, and planned on joining hands to deal with the divine race together!

Ye Yuan slaughtering dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces in a row already planted seeds in the hearts of all the various sects’ leaders.

When the oppression reached the limit, even pigs and sheep would also rise in revolt.

But, just as these sects reached an agreement and were about to make a move, Qin Chao returned!

He came back alone. When Mo Qingshan saw Qin Chao again, he felt like he had met another person.

Not seeing for a few short months, he felt like Qin Chao already underwent a thorough change!

“Senior went to the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace!”

Qin Chao’s first words when he saw Mo Qingshan made everyone incredibly shocked.
