Chapter 2675: Conspiracy

Buzz!

Song Wenhao only felt like he was struck by lightning, his head going blank at once.

Take them back!

What he, a proud son of heaven, obtained in the end was this!

Sweeping a glance over, those so-called proud sons of heaven were all extremely ashamed.

Clearly, what Ye Yuan said was right.

In these three months, what Ye Yuan taught them was the same.

But the result was different.

The people that Ye Yuan pointed to, all soared to the heavens in one bound!

The people that he did not point to, were all knocked down to the mortal world!

It was this miraculous!

Without this battle, no one would believe this at all.

But now, no one doubted Ye Yuan’s eyesight anymore.

Thud!

Song Wenhao directly knelt in front of Ye Yuan and said in grief and indignation, “Third Hall Master, Wenhao earnestly begs you to take me in! From today onward, I’ll definitely turn over a new leaf and listen to Lord Hall Master’s teachings respectfully!”

No one felt surprised by Song Wenhao’s behavior.

Ye Yuan already used his strength to prove to everyone that he was right.

Song Tianyang secretly commended this. Song Wenhao putting down his pride might not be a bad thing.

However, Ye Yuan smiled and shook his head as he said, “Rivers and mountains may be changed, but it’s hard to alter a man’s nature! I’m not saying that nature can’t be changed, but it’s just that how can it be so easy? Go back. What you have to do is not to put down your pride, but it is to temper your disposition. Otherwise, it will be hard to make great accomplishments!”

Ye Yuan had seen far too much walking from an ant until today.

Some people would gain enlightenment overnight after experiencing a setback.

But this sort of person was like the feather of a phoenix and horn of a Qilin, being very rare.

The tempering of disposition was a drawn out process.

In fact, it was even more arduous and drawn out than cultivation.

He saw bitter remorse in Song Wenhao’s eyes. But bitter remorse could not make him grow. It could only be said to be a start.

What Song Wenhao had to do was not to cultivate here, but it was for him to go out to the secular world and have a trial.

With his character, even if Ye Yuan let him stay here, he would still become restless after a year or two.

There was no way for such a person to become a truly powerful heavenly alchemist.

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept across the family heads’ faces and said indifferently, “You all feel that I picked these people to deliberately sing a different tune to you, to suppress you all? You all are thinking too much. On the path of alchemy, while talent is important, the talent that I understand is different from the talent that you all understand. Only a firm heart can reach the Great Beyond. On the path of alchemy, there are no shortcuts, only bitter cultivation. Each alchemy path titan is an ascetic. The first mover is not necessarily the first to reach. One step at a time is the right way!”

The words made everyone’s countenances change visibly.

Even a powerhouse like Song Tianyang revealed a pondering look too.

The Alchemy Dao understanding of peak powerhouses like them was clearly not what these juniors could compare to.

Ye Yuan’s words contained the maxim of Great Dao and touched them deeply.

And they also seemed to have understood why Ye Yuan chose Song Minzhe they all, and not Song Wenhao and the othersl.

Suddenly, they also understood why the two hall masters counted on Ye Yuan so much.

Zhao Xun previously said that he had to ask Ye Yuan for direction. Song Tianyang and the rest just treated it as a joke for them to push Ye Yuan into the spotlight.

But looking at it now, Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao was likely even above them, these grade four heavenly alchemists!

Otherwise, how could he refine true grade heavenly pills?

Song Tianyang cupped his fists and gave a bow to Ye Yuan, saying, “Many thanks for Third Hall Master’s advice; Song Tianyang received the teachings.”

“Many thanks for Third Hall Master’s advice!” The family heads cupped his fists and bowed one after another.

… …

After this battle, Ye Yuan established absolute authority in Heavenly South Pill Hall.

Even the Song and Yun two families submitted to Ye Yuan completely too.

After Song Tianyang and Yun Baiyu two people went back, they chose to enter closed-seclusion at the same time.

Half a year later, the two people exited seclusion, and both broke through to peak grade four heavenly alchemist!

After the two people exited seclusion, they came to Heavenly South Pill Hall straight away to pay respects to Ye Yuan.

Originally, when they learned that Min Nanshan broke through to become a peak grade four heavenly alchemist, they did not say it out loud, but they naturally felt sour in their hearts.

The three great families had always been competing in secret, they were naturally unwilling to be beaten.

Who knew that in merely a short half a year’s time, they actually both broke through.

And the cause of the breakthrough was naturally those words by Ye Yuan.

The two of them were wholeheartedly convinced by Ye Yuan.

In this half a year’s time, Ye Yuan and Cui Tong and the rest also established a complete reward and punishment system for Heavenly South Pill Hall.

And the highest reward was true grade heavenly pills!

The effects of grade two heavenly imperial pills were not worse than grade three heavenly pills to begin with.

Even to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses, it was extremely useful too, let alone talk about the true grade heavenly pills with horrifying medicinal effects.

This reward and punishment system made Heavenly South Pill Hall’s cohesiveness reach an unprecedented height.

The allure of true grade heavenly pills was irresistible.

As for Song Minzhe this batch of people, their strength advanced by leaps and bounds too.

These few people’s backgrounds were not bad. Their qualifications were extremely good in the first place.

Coupled with Ye Yuan’s teaching, wanting to not fly would be difficult too.

In this more than half a year, Ironcore and the Min Family had been waiting to watch a good show the whole time.

Who would have expected that they failed to see a good show. Instead, they became more and more marginalized.

On Ironcore’s side, he suffered overwhelming suppression from Heavenly South Pill Hall, virtually cutting off his supply of heavenly pills.

The Min Family, although Min Nanshan reached peak grade four, there was simply no way for him to resist the entire Heavenly South Pill Hall by himself.

The Min Family’s influence was being weakened bit by bit.

After all, the Heavenly South Pill Hall occupied more than 90% of the Land of Heavenly South’s situation. No one dared to risk universal condemnation and offend the Heavenly South Pill Hall.

Min Nanshan could be said to have exhausted his mind and body in this nearly one year but was powerless to turn the tables.

The Min Family’s situation became even worse half a year ago, when Ye Yuan obtained acknowledgements from everyone. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I didn’t expect that this boy actually had such means, to run the Heavenly South Pill Hall as solid as a metal bucket from top to bottom!” Ironcore gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

“The current Heavenly South Pill Hall is even stronger than Zhao Xun’s era! I really didn’t expect that a measly little grade two heavenly alchemist can actually do this!”

Min Nanshan’s eyes held some regret.

If he had long known that it would be like this, he would not have stood up back then to be the bird who took the lead.

With regards to Ironcore this fellow, he was full of unhappiness too.

If not for this guy’s instigation, he might not have done so back then either.

If the Min Family stayed in Heavenly South Pill Hall too, with the Min Family’s strength, they could definitely have scaled new heights!

Now, his Min Family was declining rapidly, while Song Tianyang and Yun Baiyu caught up from behind, and broke through to become peak grade four heavenly alchemists!

Except, there were no ifs in this world.

At this point now, the two of them were grasshoppers on the same rope. They were in it together.

A hint of cruelty flashed across Ironcore’s eyes and he said, “All this is because of that punk! As long as he dies, everything will return to how it was in the past!”

Min Nanshan snorted coldly and said, “That boy keeps hiding in Heavenly South Pill Hall. Experts are plentiful like clouds there. So how to do it?”

A hint of cunningness was revealed in Ironcore’s eyes, and he said with a smile, “He’ll leave very soon! The one-year period is almost up. I think that he should be departing for the Thistle South Sea Region very soon! This is our only chance!”
