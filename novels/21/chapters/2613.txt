Chapter 2619: Resign to Your Fate!

“What? Never refined before and he also dares to come out and posture? Isn’t he scared of being struck by lightning?”

“Is the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect going to become the laughingstock of the whole world? This boy is also too ridiculous.”

“Haha,?looks like this kid came to amuse everyone. It’s not bad either!”

… …

Ye Yuan’s words immediately attracted a burst of ridicule.

In reality, Ye Yuan had indeed never refined the Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill before.

In these eight years, he had been cultivating grade two basic heavenly pills as usual.

However, Ye Yuan already laid down a solid foundation in terms of grade one heavenly pills.

When he cultivated grade two basic heavenly pills, it clearly went much faster than during grade one heavenly pills.

Furthermore, after Ye Yuan refined a grand completion level grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, it indeed similarly had a miraculous effect, making his affinity increase to ten points all of a sudden!

From four points to ten points, this was a huge leap.

To Ye Yuan, the strength increment brought by this increase in six points was unimaginable.

The higher the heavenly pill’s grade, the higher the requirement of affinity naturally.

If he remained four points always, then the road in the future would naturally be difficult for Ye Yuan.

Perhaps he could become strong, but it would definitely be impossible to rampage in all directions.

Fortunately, the results were pretty good.

Feng Jing was also slightly stunned, then he immediately sneered and said, “Is that so? Then, wonder what pill formula will you use to bet with me? Don’t use those pill formulas of your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect. Those were all brought over by our Pill Alliance. If you can’t take one out, please go back!”

Feng Jing’s attitude was as domineering as before.

Members of the Pill Alliance all had this sort of superior mentality. Even if the widely-renown Luo Yunqing was present, he did not care either.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Dustfall Heavenly Pill, I believe that your Pill Alliance should be interested, right?”

Sure enough, Feng Jing’s pupils constricted when he heard that and cried out in surprise, “Dustfall Heavenly Pill! You … You actually have the Dustfall Heavenly Pill!”

It was not up to Feng Jing to not be surprised. This Dustfall Heavenly Pill was an ancient pill formula, being stored in Zhong Jianchou’s jade slip.

This pill formula was a type of grade two heavenly imperial pill!

Hence, that was why Feng Jing would be so surprised.

After Ye Yuan broke through, he did not have time to unlock the contents behind the jade slips yet.

But this Dustfall Heavenly Pill was in the previously unlocked content. It was a very valuable kind of pill formula.

Ye Yuan took a piece of jade slip out and directly threw it to Feng Jing.

After Feng Jing looked, his expression could not help changing greatly.

Very clearly, he had verified the authenticity of this pill formula.

Of course, there were only the heavenly medicines that the Dustfall Heavenly Pill required in the jade slip. As for the specifics of how to refine it, it was all hidden by Ye Yuan.

On Rainclear Continent, alchemy battles between heavenly alchemists would be held under a fair premise.

If the one party did not have the pill formula taken out by the other party, then they also needed to provide a pill formula as an exchange.

Of course, the prerequisite was that they won.

If Feng Jing lost, this Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill would be equivalent to being given to Ye Yuan on a silver platter.

And Ye Yuan did not need to take the Dustfall Heavenly Pill out either.

The alchemy battle with Qin Shun previously, that was originally the sect’s internal alchemy battle. There were naturally not so many rules.

But now, Ye Yuan publicly challenged Feng Jing, then he would have to follow the rules.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How would I dare to come and challenge without some goods?”

But a hint of greed flashed across in Feng Jing’s eyes and he said with a cold smile, “If Heaven bestows it and you don’t take it, you’ll definitely be condemned by the heavens! Since you’re in a hurry to give such a precious pill formula, then does this Feng have a reason to not want it? This Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill’s pill formula, take it!”

As he said, Feng Jing likewise threw out a piece of jade slip.

After Ye Yuan got it, he began to digest it on the spot.

While on the Pill Verdant Establishment’s side, they also started preparing matters related to the alchemy battle during this period.

Seeing this scene, Luo Yunqing was speechless for a while too.

This guy had always been learning on the spot when competing in alchemy!

The key was that his ability to learn on the spot was extremely strong!

Clearly never refined before, but the quality of the heavenly pill produced was surprisingly high.

It was just that, did not know whether he could still rampage in all directions like before when refining grade two heavenly pills after he broke through.

After all, grade two heavenly pills were undoubtedly far more complicated and difficult to understand when compared to grade one heavenly pills.

Six hours later, Ye Yuan finished deducing.

Feng Jing looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Boy, making a frantic last-minute effort and you want to win my Pill Alliance? You’re too naive! This Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill, even if this Feng performs below usual standards, I can reach sixth grade too! If I perform exceptionally well,?heh heh,?upper eighth grade is nothing difficult! Boy, resign to your fate!”

Feng Jing’s words immediately attracted a burst of exclamation.

Even if it was a grade three heavenly alchemist, being able to refine a grade two heavenly pill to the realm of upper eighth grade, it was absolutely extremely rare!

Especially that the difficulty of this Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill was not an ordinary kind of hard.

Even Ye Yuan was a little surprised too.

The other party dared to say this, he was probably not bragging.

Furthermore, he let the other party choose the heavenly pill, the other party definitely picked what he was best at.

Very clearly, this Feng Jing was god knows how many times stronger than that dabbler Qin Shun.

Being able to hold down the fort in a region, Feng Jing’s strength was indeed not what Qin Shun, that sort of guy who did things carelessly, could compare to.

Even Luo Yunqing, a hint of surprise flashed across in his eyes too. Clearly, he was shocked.

Upper eighth grade, it was not easy to reach!

He felt that if Feng Jing could refine sixth grade or seventh grade, Ye Yuan still had the strength to fight.

But if it reached eighth grade, probably even Ye Yuan would feel anxious too!

However, Ye Yuan did not care and said coolly, “Begin then. Talk so much crap.”

Feng Jing’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Boy, you’ll be crying in a while!”

The two people each arrived in front of a medicine cauldron. Feng Jing assumed his responsibility and directly started extracting the heavenly medicines.

That natural and smooth process made people dazzled for a while.

Even Ye Yuan also could not help having higher regard for the other party.

This Feng Jing really had the skills!

This Pill Alliance was not simple!

Just based on Feng Jing’s strength, Ye Yuan estimated that this Pill Alliance’s pill refining standard might be more than 100 times stronger than the outside world!

However, he did not care either.

This alchemy battle was just the start of his colossal plan.

If he lost here, then he might as well find a piece of tofu to commit suicide with.

Ye Yuan restrained his mind and started refining the heavenly pill. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, the moment he took action, it immediately attracted a series of snickering.

“This boy is indeed a joker! This affinity probably doesn’t exceed ten points, right?”

“Haha,?look at Master Feng there again, his affinity is at least 50 plus! Just this affinity, there’s no comparison between the two, right?”

“I understand, this boy probably thinks that heavenly alchemists fighting in alchemy are still the same as in the Lower Realms!?Hahaha?…”

… …

This was something within reason, Ye Yuan’s greatest shortcoming was affinity.

Sure enough, he became the object of ridicule now too.

Affinity determined the limit that a heavenly alchemist could reach.

Therefore, using affinity to judge a heavenly alchemist’s strength was acceptable!

But clearly, this did not apply to Ye Yuan.

But very soon, those people could not laugh anymore.

The heavenly medicines that Ye Yuan extracted were crystal clear, without any flaws. It was actually not the least bit inferior to Feng Jing’s!
