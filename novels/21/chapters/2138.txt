The swelling on Long Zhaotian’s face just went down a little. With Long Xiaochun’s blow, it swelled up again.

“B-Boss, did you hit the wrong person?” Long Zhaotian hurt until tears came out as he said with an innocent look.

Long Xiaochun turned to look at him and said with a grin, “I didn’t hit wrongly. Ye Yuan is my close brother. You want to beat him to a pig’s head, so I naturally have to beat you to a pig’s head.”

“C-Close brother?” Long Zhaotian said with a stunned look.

Ye Yuan was speechless and said, “Xiaochun, why did you enter the Dragon Eye Cave?”

Long Xiaochun wrinkled her nose and said, “Humph! I knew that Long Chi that old thing had no good intentions and went to find Mother. In the end, I just happened to hear her and Uncle Zhi discussing your matter. Originally, I planned on going to stop it, who knew that I was still a step late. Hence, I took advantage of the fact that they weren’t paying attention and secretly slipped inside. You were brought into the Dragon Clan by me. So how can I watch you seek your doom? Now that I entered, I have to bring you out!”

When Ye Yuan heard, he felt warm in his heart.

From the first time he laid eyes on Long Xiaochun, Ye Yuan had a feeling of being connected by blood, feeling very cordial.

Maybe they really had bloodline relations.

After all, nobody knew the origins of the dragon race’s progenitor too.

Maybe he was born in the Raindragon Stronghold?

“Sigh, you, this girl, are also too capricious. With you coming here, outside is probably already in a mess,” Ye Yuan said with a sigh.

Long Xiaochun laughed and said, “Who cares! Either way, I wasn’t happy at all staying in Raindragon Stronghold. Instead, after coming in, the feeling of being a boss is pretty good. Whatshisname, Little Tian, why haven’t you come to apologize to Ye Yuan?”

Long Zhaotian came brimming with confidence, thinking that he could gain back face at Ye Yuan here and beat Ye Yuan to a pig’s head.

Who knew that he failed to beat Ye Yuan and he himself became a pig’s head again.

In the end, he even had to admit his fault to Ye Yuan, truly aggrieving!

However, Long Xiaochun gave the order. So he did not dare to defy in the slightest.

Long Xiaochun was unruly by nature. These few days, Long Zhaotian had no lack of being tortured by Long Xiaochun and had long lost any temper.

“Y-Your Excellency, Little Tian was wrong!” Long Zhaotian said with a bitter look.

Seeing Long Zhaotian’s appearance like a bullied wife, Long Xun was tickled badly by the side.

Ye Yuan waved his hand, he could not be bothered to stoop to the level of this kind of minor character.

“Since Xiaochun, you, like to be boss, in the future, merge these two camps. You can be the boss,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Alright, alright!” Long Xiaochun had a joyful look.

... ...

The two camps directly underwent a merger. Long Xun and Long Zhaotian went through the specifics of operations, the two people naturally could not avoid some disputes.

Ye Yuan brought Long Xiaochun to his station and started chatting.

Long Xiaochun sized Ye Yuan up and down and said with a peculiar look, “Really seeing ghosts! In this sort of place, not only did your cultivation speed not slow down, but it actually became faster instead!”

Ye Yuan smiled and started revolving the Chaos Heavenspan Canon. Devilish energy poured into his body crazily.

When Long Xiaochun saw this scene, her mouth opened wide and she exclaimed, “Y-Y-You ... You can actually use devilish energy to cultivate? This ... This is really seeing ghosts! Since young, I thought that I was a freak. Only now do I know that compared to you, I’m too normal!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “You’re such an adorable little girl. How are you a freak?”

Long Xiaochun laughed and said, “I’m different from the rest.”

Ye Yuan could feel that Long Xiaochun’s smile exuded pain and loneliness.

Ye Yuan had long known that Long Chi they all called Long Xiaochun a misfortune star.

It seemed like this little lass had a sad past.

However, since Long Xiaochun was not willing to say, Ye Yuan naturally was not willing to ask more either.

“Heh heh, if Long Chi that old man know about your current situation, I reckon that it can anger him until he directly goes to reincarnate.” Long Xiaochun suddenly thought of something and started laughing.

Ye Yuan also laughed and said, “Huhu, I think so too. Honestly speaking, I really quite like this place right now and don’t really want to go out anymore. The Dragon Eye Cave is simply a cultivation paradise to me.”

Long Xiaochun was speechless as she said, “It’s also just you that treats this place like your own backyard. However ... how do we go out?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I naturally have a way.”

Long Xiaochun’s pupils constricted and she said in surprise, “You have a way?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “But right now, the most important thing is still increasing strength! Xiaochun, these next few years, I’ll have to rely on you.”

Long Xiaochun patted her chest and said, “Say it, want me to do what?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Hunt abyss monsters and get as many tarnished black devil crystals back as possible.”

Long Xiaochun said speechlessly, “Alright! The method that you cultivate is really special!”

Hence, in the following days, Long Xiaochun brought the merged two great camps and went around hunting abyss monsters.

With Long Xiaochun this abnormally strong girl around, rank six abyss monsters could not last one exchange with her at all.

Ye Yuan was only in charge of one thing, that was cultivation.

Saving the time to hunt, Ye Yuan’s realm advanced by leaps and bounds.

Three years later, Ye Yuan completed the arduous task that others were unable to complete; in 3000 years, he broke through to become a Ninth Firmament True God!

Another five years passed, Ye Yuan broke through to peak Ninth Firmament True God in one stroke. There was only a step away from the next realm!

His cultivation speed made everyone stare wide-eyed and tongue-tied.

Regardless of whether it was Long Xun or Long Zhaotian, they could only use the label freak to describe Ye Yuan.

On this day, Ye Yuan exited seclusion.

Long Xun scuttled over to greet, saying fawningly, “Your Excellency is really god-like! In a short nine years’ time, cultivating from Seventh Firmament True God to peak Ninth Firmament True God, we probably can’t find a second one in the entire Heavenspan World, right?”

This was not merely buttering up, he was truly shocked.

Ye Yuan’s cultivation speed virtually drove people mad.

With Ye Yuan’s speed of absorbing divine essence, if it were the average person, it was sufficient to burst their divine seas. But Ye Yuan was like a bottomless pit, however much you came, I would absorb however much.

Too crazy!

He had never heard before that someone could cultivate this way at True God Realm.

Ye Yuan scolded laughingly, “Stop sucking up!”

Long Xun chuckled and said, “Your Excellency, coming out of seclusion this time, are you bringing us out?”

Ye Yuan said, “No rush. Since the cultivation environment here is so good, I naturally have to break through to the Empyrean Realm in one go before going out. Otherwise, after going out, it will have to expend a great deal of effort to break through to the Empyrean Realm.”

The quantity of spiritual energy required for Ye Yuan to break through to the Empyrean Realm was extremely horrifying.

Reaching the outside world, just the cultivation resources had to make big preparations.

The tarnished black devil crystals here were abundant, and the devilish energy was also very plentiful.

Breaking through here was naturally the best choice.

“This ... Your Excellency isn’t consolidating your realm a bit before breaking through again?” Long Xun said hesitantly.

If ordinary people’s cultivation realm broke through so quickly, it was hard to avoid their realms being unstable.

Wanting to break through to the Empyrean Realm needed a very long time of preparations.

Otherwise, the chance of failure was very high.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s meaning, he wanted to break through in one stroke.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “No need! Uh, I haven’t moved around for so long. I should go out and stretch my limbs a bit.”
