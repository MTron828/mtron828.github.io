Chapter 1470 Heavy Casualties

“The fiend dogs came up! F*cking fellows!”

“Fight it out with them!”

The fiend race’s numbers were too many. Even with powerful bow and arrows suppressing, the fiend race soldiers scaled up the city walls very quickly as well.

Following that was fighting in close quarters!

Once they could not defend this first wave, their line of defense would be utterly crushed.

“Pfft!”

A human soldier hacked at a fiend captain with a slash, shouting excitedly, “Why is this fiend dog so weak?”

“My side too!”

“So weak, one chop and it’s done!”

“Hahaha, so weak! Chopping so satisfyingly!”

...

On the city wall came the human soldiers’ excited shouting.

When Wang Yifeng saw those fiends rush up so quickly, just now, his expression changed drastically too.

But he did not expect that these fiends that climbed up were so weak.

Wang Yifeng secretly heaved a sigh of relief. The southern city that side definitely could not be counted on. He could only rely on these people to guard the northern city now!

The most important thing was that there was a fiend race army here. Then the people sent to Kangding City to request reinforcements were definitely disposed of already.

They already became an isolated city now!

Originally, seeing the fiend soldiers climb up to the top of city walls, Xiu Lie was overjoyed in his heart.

But very soon, his smile turned stiff on his face. Because the first wave of attack was repelled very quickly.

He could not understand what in the world happened.

Victory was clearly in sight. In a twinkle, it ended up in smoke.

This wave directly lost several thousand people. Xiu Lie’s heart was dripping blood.

He did not have a source of troops to replenish currently. One dead was one less!

“Charge again for me! Charge up in one vigorous effect! Fiend Dragon Throwing Spears, continue firing for me!” Xiu Lie roared.

Another large wave of assault, the circumstances were shockingly similar to just now.

A large wave of people had clearly rushed up to the top of the city walls. They went up fast, but was defeated even faster!

Once they went up to the top of the city walls, it should have been like a hot knife cutting through butter. But the fiend soldiers all seemed to wane, directly deflating.

Xiu Lie’s eyes stared like wide-saucers as he roared angrily, “Charge for me! Whoever dares to take a step back, kill without mercy!”

Boom!

Xiu Lie raised his hand and it was a palm, decimating quite a number of fiend soldiers who were currently running back.

Those fiend soldiers were at a loss on what to do and could only turn around and charge in the direction of the city walls.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh ...

It was another round of arrow flurry on the city walls, exploding on the fiend soldiers’ bodies.

“Your Excellency, we can’t charge anymore!” shouted a commander as he sprinted wildly to Xiu Lie’s side.

Xiu Lie’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “What in the world is going on?”

That commander said with a face full of sorrow, “It’s Spiriteye Green Soul Powder! Somebody spread Spiriteye Green Soul Powder at the wind-gap!”

The moment Xiu Lie heard, his expression changed greatly and he shouted fiercely, “Come back! All come back for me!”

Those fiend soldiers were just about to rush up. Hearing Xiu Lie’s roar, they immediately turned around and ran back.

This back and forth was like walking a dog, looking incomparably comical.

“Hahaha! Fiend dogs, come on up!”

“Weren’t you very fierce just now? Come on up! Grandpa is waiting for you here!”

“A bunch of craven dogs, you all come up! Weren’t you very cocky earlier?”

...

On top of the city walls, the human soldiers all started shouting excitedly.

Repelling the fiend race’s two waves of offensive in a row, killing five to six thousand fiends, each and every one of them was incomparably excited.

The human’s side only paid a very small price.

Although they won rather bafflingly, this did not hinder their extremely swelled up mentality.

Xiu Lie’s expression was unbelievably grim as he asked that commander, “You’re sure that it’s the Spiriteye Green Soul Powder?”

That commander said, “Absolutely! Furthermore, this Spiriteye Green Soul Powder’s purity is very high. Just now, I only sucked in a small mouthful and almost can’t muster up any fiendish essence!”

Xiu Lie drew a cold breath and said in shock, “So powerful? How can there possibly be someone who grasps the Spiriteye Green Soul Powder’s refining method among the humans?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Spiriteye Green Soul Powder did not have any effect on humans. But against fiends, especially low-ranking fiends, it had a terrifying effect.

Once this thing drifted along with the wind, it would become colorless and tasteless.

Even inhaling a grain of powder would also make the fiend’s fiendish essence unable to muster up, and could only be at people’s mercy.

However, while this thing was formidable, even in the fiend race, extremely few people were able to refine it too.

In fact, those who knew that it existed were very few as well.

He did not expect that there was actually someone who knew how to refine Spiriteye Green Soul Powder. This was simply grievous news to them.

“Damn it! Who the hell is it, opposing us in every way?”

Xiu Lie was simply almost going crazy. This invisible opponent made him feel extremely uneasy.

First was cutting off his path of retreat, then was the Spiriteye Green Soul Powder. This guy still had no idea how many methods!

At this point, Xiu Lie would rather have a good fight with the other party.

But, he did not know who the opponent was at all!

“Your Excellency, what should we do now?” asked a subordinate who was also at a complete loss.

Xiu Lie’s expression flickered incessantly. Suddenly, he made up his mind and said in a solemn voice, “Whole army, launch an attack! Everyone, hold your breath and charge up in one vigorous effort! They only have several thousand people. As long as we can charge inside, Tiderain City will definitely be captured! All of the Origin Deity Realm commanders charge in front for me!”

The subordinates’ expressions changed and they said, “Your Excellency, do you have assurance in avoiding the giant crossbows?”

Xiu Lie said solemnly, “No assurance! But carry on waiting and we’re still dead! This hidden opponent is too terrifying. I feel that we’ve always been led by the nose by him. He clearly wants to delay us right now. Most likely ... the reinforcements are already on the way!”

The subordinates were taken aback with horror and said, “No way! The people sent out of the city to request for reinforcements were all disposed of by us!”

Xiu Lie’s expression was very ugly as he said, “We have no way out anymore! Not capturing the city, we’ll have to die! Can’t carry on wasting time! Attack!”

“Yes!”

Under Xiu Lie’s command, all of the commanders followed him and charged straight out.

Xiu Lie came before the army and shouted fiercely, “Everyone, follow me! You’re not allowed to take a step back! Kill!”

Done talking, he leaped, directly flying toward the city walls!

Wang Yifeng’s expression changed and he said sternly, “Giant crossbowmen, shoot him down for me!”

Swoosh!

A terrifying sharp arrow tore through the air and arrived, with virtually no time interval!

A mighty expert like Xiu Lie was too late to even react and only had time to slant his body a bit.

“Pfft!”

Xiu Lie gave a muffled groan. A large hole was directly shot out in his chest!

Wang Yifeng sighed in pity inwardly. If it could hit Xiu Lie’s vital areas, it would be able to take his life.

But this blow already heavily injured Xiu Lie.

In this short while, a group of commanders already leaped up to the top of city walls. Those fiend soldiers followed closely behind.

Of course, the price paid was very heavy too.

This wave of attack, the fiend race had a large group of casualties again, and already lost one-third!

The Spiriteye Green Soul Powder was still continuing. A large swathe of fiend soldiers that rushed up the city walls fell down again.

Xiu Lie ignored the injuries on his body, leaping up, directly flying up to the top of city walls.

But at this time, a figure quietly circled around to the back of the fiend race army.
