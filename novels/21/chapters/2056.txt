Chapter 2060: Lowering Head

Among the Empyrean powerhouses present, which one did not have abundant net worth?

In these hundreds of thousands of years, the Southern Border Alliance monopolized more than 70% of the entire Southern Border’s medicinal pills market. The wealth accumulated was incomparably abundant.

It was just that no matter how abundant, they also could not feed into a bottomless hole!

Moreover, although their business was huge, the majority of what they gained had to be contributed to Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas.

Without the protection of Heavenly Emperors, they were nothing.

Just like the Myriad Treasure Tower, it was precisely because their back was resting against Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure that Flutterfeather had this confidence to make a clean break from the Southern Border Alliance.

Otherwise, why would these people fight what trade war with Empyrean Flutterfeather? They would have directly called up a bunch of Empyrean powerhouses and annihilated the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Over nine years, these people felt deeply fatigued.

Fighting a war that could never be won had no meaning whatsoever!

Especially that Empyrean Chaoyuan and the seven great reclusive ancient families making a move dealt an even more lethal blow to them.

Empyrean Pilljade’s expression flickered incessantly, and he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Really damn it all to hell! I didn’t expect that they actually made the seven great reclusive families come into being unknowingly. Truly off by one move!”

Empyrean Blazing Sun sighed and said, “The chips in their hands are too strong! Even for the seven great reclusive ancient families, it’s also impossible to not be moved when they see these medicinal pills. After all, that represents strength!”

The power of medicinal pills was too strong. It could even create a great ancient family within a short few thousand years.

Just like Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, celestial deities were already everywhere within a short few hundred years just based on Ye Yuan alone.

Recalling when Ye Yuan just entered Heavenly Eagle back then, their Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses were merely just two people!

This was the power of medicinal pills.

The Myriad Treasure Tower bringing out so many epoch-making medicinal pills in one go, how could reclusive ancient families possibly not be moved?

“Sigh, now that it has come to this, saying anymore is useless. In my view, we’d better lower our heads to the Myriad Treasure Tower!” Empyrean Windrider let out a sigh and said.

He and Empyrean Lumen were the best of friends. Back then, Empyrean Lumen urged him to not get involved in this messy situation.

But in front of tremendous profits, Empyrean Windrider still failed to resist in the end.

Of course, more importantly was that he completely did not believe that a puny little Ye Yuan could make the entire Southern Border change skies.

But now, reality gave him a merciless slap.

The Southern Border’s sky really changed!

With this war, the Southern Border Alliance suffered a great loss in vitality. In the future, they could only look up to the Myriad Treasure Tower for direction.

Empyrean Windrider’s words pricked everyone’s nerves all at once.

‘Lower heads,’ these two words were something that they had always had on the tip of their tongues but did not dare to say out too.

Which of those present were not important figures that made the Southern Border tremble when they stomped their feet? Saying lowering their heads, this sort of phrase, out of their mouths represented humiliation.

In reality, how could they not tell that this war was hopeless long ago?

What made them hold on until now was face.

Killing 1000 of the enemy, losing 800 of your own forces.

They would rather cause mutual destruction to both sides with the Myriad Treasure Tower than be willing to lower their heads.

But, reaching today, they still had to lower their heads in the end!

“No way! Our Southern Border Alliance unified the Southern Border’s alchemy world, but now, we have to lower our heads to the Myriad Treasure Tower? In the future, who will still think highly of our Southern Border Alliance?” Empyrean Proudcloud was the first one to jump out to object.

Of course, he said it with a strong sense of righteousness, but everyone knew what he was plotting.

It was just that the words he said were also that nerve which everyone felt the most pain. Everyone was silent and did not speak.

The muscles on Empyrean Pilljade’s face twitched. After remaining silent for a long time, he finally slowly closed his eyes and said, “Proudcloud, this matter was caused by you, so you go to the Myriad Treasure Tower and lower your head to acknowledge fault! In addition, Younger Brother Windrider, the negotiations with the Myriad Treasure Tower, the full authority will be handed to you. Remember, it’s us admitting defeat to the Myriad Treasure Tower, and not admitting defeat to Ye Yuan!”

When Empyrean Proudcloud heard that, his face immediately turned ashen, a sense of disgrace instantly welling up in his heart.

This was Empyrean Pilljade’s action of sacrificing the knights in order to save the queen!

Empyrean Proudcloud was unwilling, but he had no choice.

Breaking away from the Southern Border Alliance?

Ye Yuan had this confidence, but he, Proudcloud, did not.

Once he broke away from the Southern Border Alliance, his outcome would be being swallowed by everyone present until not even dregs remained!

...

In the tenth year of the fierce fighting, the Southern Border Alliance finally lowered their proud heads and conceded defeat to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

On this day, Empyrean Windrider brought a group of Empyrean powerhouses and came to Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital to negotiate with Empyrean Flutterfeather.

But Empyrean Flutterfeather hung them out to dry for as long as a month.

In a pavilion halfway up Cloud Dream Mountain, several figures were currently drinking and chatting away merrily.

A drunkard old man lauded with praises unceasingly, “Fine wine! Truly fine wine! Little Friend Ye is well-deserving of the title of grandmaster, drinking this Dreamlike Wine is really like being rapt in a dream!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If Brother Beitang likes it, I’ll order people to bring a few vats over later. But this alcohol isn’t easy to brew. This Ye can’t take much out either.”

The old man’s eyes lit up when he heard that and said with joy, “Is this for real?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Could this Ye still bluff Brother Beitang?”

The old man laughed loudly and said, “Then this Empyrean won’t be courteous with you!”

This old man was precisely Beitang Ancient Family’s alchemy master, Beitang Li, whose alchemy strength virtually reaching the grand completion Dao Realm.

It was just that the Beitang Family tended to be low-profile, so it was not known by outsiders.

When the others saw the situation, they also asked for the Dreamlike wine from Ye Yuan one after another. Ye Yuan naturally satisfied them one by one.

The Dreamlike Wine indeed had a superb taste. Even people who did not like to drink alcohol also loved it so much that they could not bear to part with it.

The seven great ancient families rendered great assistance to the Myriad Treasure Tower this time, Ye Yuan naturally did not stint to give some small gifts as reciprocatory gifts.

Empyrean Flutterfeather also felt vicissitudes of emotion at one side. Even before starting the war, he also never thought that only using ten years, the Myriad Treasure Tower made the Southern Border Alliance bow their heads in submission like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves!

His initial plan was for the Myriad Treasure Tower to be able to gain a firm foothold under the pincer attack of the Southern Border Alliance. This was already his highest estimated result.

Who knew that the pill formulas Ye Yuan took out directly swept throughout the entire Southern Border, and the formulas even forced out the seven great ancient families that had always been reclusive.

These seven great ancient families were not the Myriad Treasure Tower going to beg them one by one, but them taking the initiative to come and implore!

The attraction of these pill formulas was seriously too great!

Back then, when these seven great ancient families found the Myriad Treasure Tower, Empyrean Flutterfeather said that these pill formulas were Ye Yuan’s. They refused to believe no matter what and thought that the Myriad Treasure Tower was cherishing their own old broomstick.

Later, Beitang and the rest were unconvinced and challenged Ye Yuan and were wrecked by Ye Yuan until they returned in great defeat. Only then did they believe that the pill formulas were Ye Yuan’s.

However, this was also making friends after a fight.

Right now, Beitang and the seven great ancient families had the greatest esteem for Ye Yuan and already were friends in spite of the differences in age.

With the allying of the seven great ancient families, the Southern Border Alliance became too weak to stand up to competition.

After three rounds of drinking, Beitang Li chuckled and said to Ye Yuan, “Younger Brother Ye, heh heh, our friendship is friendship, business is business. You look ... the Southern Border Alliance has already lowered their heads, shouldn’t our agreement take effect too?”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Elder Brother Beitang is really anxious! Would this Ye be a stingy person? The pill formulas will be presented right away!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan took out a bunch of jade slips and distributed them respectively to the seven great ancient families’ representatives.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
