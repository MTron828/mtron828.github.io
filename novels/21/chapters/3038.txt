Chapter 3037: A Dead Person Swears at People Too!

“Ye Yuan, this guy is so strong! He’s just ranked 1000th. If so, then how strong is the first place?” Yang Qing said with a solemn expression.

Yang Qing was proud. Especially these few years, he practically soared to the skies.

But today, he really met his match.

The powerhouses in this Thousand Souls Hall were really the utmost strongest thousand people in the long river of time!

“Is he strong? I don’t think so,” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

Yang Qing rolled his eyes and said in depression, “You tortoise grandson, I shouldn’t have talked to you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You, this person, you need to grow while being knocked down! Comprehend it. You should have reaped a lot in the fight just now.”

Yang Qing nodded and went to one side to comprehend.

The Thousand Souls Hall’s opponents absolutely only occurred once in a lifetime to geniuses.

Fighting with such opponents could improve oneself to the greatest extent.

However, this did not hold much significance to Ye Yuan.

He was indeed shocked by the strength of the powerhouses in the Thousand Souls Hall, but that was also just limited to shock.

These people’s strengths were indeed not on the same level at all when compared to the small Labyrinth Divine Palace back then.

But Ye Yuan’s improvement was greater!

The most important thing was that Ye Yuan could utilize saint force!

Forget about being the same rank as him; even if it was one or two minor realms higher than him, it was enough for Ye Yuan to sweep across too.

Hence, that was why Yang Qing was depressed.

Behind Ye Yuan, many people were itching to have a go.

A handsome youth arrived in front of Ye Yuan, coming forward on his own accord as he said, “Heavenly Saint Ye, I want to try!”

Ye Yuan recognized him. He was called Hu Gaoshan.

On the Vertical Heaven Stairs, Ye Yuan discovered some fine saplings. This Hu Gaoshan was one of them.

Actually, in the sea of faces, there would also be some people who had overlooked talents because of various reasons.

This kind of person, as long as you gave them a chance, they would turn into dragons the moment they encountered the winds of change!

Before entering the Vertical Heaven Stairs, Hu Gaoshan was very ordinary.

In fact, Ye Yuan did not see him at all in that initial group of people.

But after going through the Vertical Heaven Stairs, he was already ranked at the forefront of this one million people.

Understanding in Dao determined the height of the ceiling.

Ye Yuan explaining Dao on the Vertical Heaven Stairs was equivalent to forcefully raising these people’s ceiling.

However, Ye Yuan did not agree with Hu Gaoshan. He smiled and said, “I’ll go first. You guys watch closely! However much you can comprehend will depend on yourselves! This round will probably eliminate more than half the people!”

Everyone’s eyes lit up, was Heavenly Saint Ye going to demonstrate for everyone again?

“Many thanks, Heavenly Saint Ye!”

“Heavenly Saint Ye gives assistance to all life. We’re grateful to the point of shedding tears!”

“Heavenly Saint Ye is really a sage of ancient times!”

… …

A dense crowd of people were extremely grateful to Ye Yuan.

They all expressed that if it were not for Ye Yuan, they would not have made it through the Vertical Heaven Stairs at all.

Ye Yuan reached the status of heavenly saint. However, he did not forget to benefit the world.

This kind of person was truly rare in the 33 Heavens.

They did not need to think and also knew how proud the geniuses of other planes were. Why would they be associated with ants like them?

But Heavenly Saint Ye did not give them the cold shoulder. He helped them to improve instead.

In fact, he gave up on the title of All-Heavens List’s first place for this!

How could they not be moved?

Everyone knew that if Ye Yuan really meant business, it would have nothing to do with Yang Qing anymore.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You all don’t have to be like this. These don’t have much meaning to me. Rather than competing for these pointless things, it’s better to let everyone’s strength become a little stronger. After all, this kind of opportunity doesn’t come by often. Alright, I’m going. All of you watch closely!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan leaped and entered the battle formation.

When Ouyang Fangde saw Ye Yuan, his pupils could not help constricting. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The pressure that Ye Yuan gave him was practically suffocating him!

Compared to Ye Yuan, Yang Qing was nothing at all.

Were the youngsters now all so impressive?

Randomly encountering one and he was formidable until like this?

Against Yang Qing, he felt that he still had the strength to fight.

But, facing Ye Yuan, he actually felt powerless to resist.

This kind of feeling was … too exaggerated!

I, Ouyang Fangde, am a top disciple of the 33 Heavens’ number one sect, the Labyrinth Divine Palace!

“Make your move,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ouyang Fangde’s face fell. This guy was so arrogant!

Only to see that there was suddenly an additional judge pen in his hand, directly pointing toward Ye Yuan, the speed inconceivably fast.

Pointing All Life!

Pen Expressing Dragons and Snakes!

Ten Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains!

… …

Ouyang Fangde executed move after move, instantly clashing together with Ye Yuan.

The two people were locked in a struggle.

During the battle, Ouyang Fangde was somewhat dazed.

Could it be that the feeling just now was wrong?

This guy was actually not as strong as imagined at all?

Exchanging more than a hundred moves in a blink of an eye, Ouyang Fangde discovered that although Ye Yuan’s strength was very strong, he was still much worse than Yang Qing.

He could not help perspiring from embarrassment, wondering if he was overly sensitive?

But he did not know that those Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses outside were already completely boiling over with excitement.

“Ahh!?Turns out that this move can be broken like this!”

“Heavenly Saint Ye’s Sword Dao is so profound! However, I seem to have understood a little!”

“Ouyang Fangde’s Pointing All Life has already been used many times. I think that I’ve already found the way to resolve it.”

… …

After a thousand moves, Ouyang Fangde’s moves were basically squeezed dry by Ye Yuan.

When a move became outdated, it naturally did not pose much threat anymore.

Only then did Ouyang Fangde gradually discover that it did not seem to be the case at all.

This guy was dismantling his moves?

I … F*ck me!

“A scholar prefers death to humiliation! How can you do this?” Ouyang Fangde seemingly woke up from a dream and berated Ye Yuan angrily.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re merely a dead man condensed out of origin power. What individuality do you have? Using you to improve everyone’s strength a little is also considered a great service to mankind.”

Ouyang Fangde said gloomily, “Bullshit! This seat is the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s Hegemon Realm powerhouse, a paramount existence! You punk, you’re courting death here!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Hegemon Realm expert can still be a dead person too. Could it be that you can still jump out of the grave to beat me?”

Ouyang Fangde was speechless.

Very sadly, he was just a tool.

If Ye Yuan did not stop, he could only passively go along with Ye Yuan forever.

All the way until Ye Yuan got bored of playing, and then he could kill him.

By now, he already completely understood that the sensation earlier was completely right!

This guy’s strength was too terrifying!

It was him who was too weak. That was why he did not feel Ye Yuan’s power.

Ye Yuan possessed the chaos divine essence. The power of every move and even his style were hair-raisingly strong.

It was just that Ye Yuan suppressed his strength as much as possible in order to dismantle the moves and completely expose all of Ouyang Fangde’s flaws.

The same rank Ouyang Fangde was far too behind Ye Yuan.

Resulting in him not understanding Ye Yuan’s intention at all in the beginning.

By the time he understood, his weaknesses were already completely exposed.

“Alright, it should be about enough,” Ye Yuan said coolly, a streak of sword light flashing past.

Ouyang Fangde was dead!

Very soon, Ouyang Fangde’s body condensed once more, looking at Ye Yuan as he shouted angrily, “I … F*ck you!”

This guy was bullying people too far!

Ouyang Fangde seriously could not hold back and swore profanities.
