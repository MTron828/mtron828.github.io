Chapter 2388: Shallow Foundation

“O-Of course!”

The faces of several elders were rather awkward, but at this time, they had nothing to say.

This young man’s strength was actually evenly-matched with lord Witchcloud. He naturally had the qualification to witness their strength.

“Yang Xiong, you first! Show your strength and let Chief Instructor take a look,” Witchcloud said to an elder.

Although he lost to Ye Yuan by a notch in the alchemy battle, he had the intention of showing off in front of Ye Yuan, and he also wanted to win back one round.

These alchemists in the Alchemy Hall, he expended tremendous effort to train them.

He was still rather pleased with himself on this point.

“No need. Everyone, do it together,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Together? This ... This is also too sloppy, right?” Yang Xiong said doubtfully.

This new chief instructor always did things unexpectedly.

There were no less than a thousand alchemists present, they were all the Alchemy Hall’s elites.

Refining pills together, what could he discern?

Witchcloud was also very puzzled, but he still said, “Just do as Young Friend Ji says.”

Hence, a thousand people refined pills at the same time. The scene was a grand sight.

Ye Yuan slowly shut his eyes, soul force spreading out, covering all those present inside.

Witchcloud’s heart shook slightly, this guy wanted to observe so many people’s pill refinement through soul force?

Wasn’t this too exaggerated?

Observing one person refining pills was nothing. But such a complicated thing like pill refinement, wanting to remember every detail of a thousand people, this was virtually something impossible.

Witchcloud was not saying that Ye Yuan’s soul force was insufficient, but this act needed one’s control of soul force to reach a hair-raising level.

Even Witchcloud could not possibly fully understand everyone’s strengths and weaknesses.

Was Ye Yuan deliberately flaunting his skill, or puffing himself up at his own cost?

Or did he focus his attention on a few people, and would comment on them when the time comes?

Witchcloud could not tell, he was waiting to see.

A few days later, everyone finished the pill refinement.

In fact, there were some people who had already completed their refinement early. Seeing Ye Yuan observing with soul force, they all had scornful looks on their faces.

This new chief instructor was indeed here to posture!

This kind of low-grade performance, did he really take them to be fools?

It was true that Ye Yuan’s strength was strong, but these people were still very unhappy with him in their hearts.

After all, he rode on top of Lord Witchcloud’s head!

“Young Friend Ji, can this Alchemy Hall of mine still enter your arcane sights?” Witchcloud saw Ye Yuan withdraw his soul force and said with a slight smile.

He was still very confident regarding the Alchemy Hall’s strength.

Teaching disciples everything would make the master starve to death.

Many people would hold something back when they taught disciples.

But Witchcloud taught these people without holding anything back.

In the Alchemy Hall, there were several who reached rank three source.

Therefore, he was very confident in his Alchemy Hall.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Senior Witchcloud, do you want me to tell you the truth?”

Witchcloud’s expression choked up. Hearing this meaning, it was so-so!

One had to know, the Alchemy Hall was already the human race’s alchemy path’s strongest place. Was this fellow still not satisfied?

Could it be that he was really here to challenge them on purpose?

Witchcloud’s expression finally turned sullen.

“If there’s any problem, Young Friend Ji feel free to say, correct mistakes if any, and guard against them if none has been committed!” Witchcloud’s tone finally became somewhat unhappy.

Ye Yuan discerned the displeasure, but he still said, “To talk about strength, the Alchemy Hall is indeed very powerful. It’s just that ... want to reach the degree where it makes the divine race wary, it’s still far from enough!”

“Heh, looks like Lord Chief Instructor is looking down us people here!”

“Lord Chief Instructor really doesn’t feel backache when standing up and talking without any responsibility. Alchemy Dao is the process of accumulating day in and day out. So how can wanting to improve it be so easy?”

“Rules are intangible existences. Which one of us doesn’t want to reach the level of rules? But under the divine race’s rule, even getting a bit of spirit medicines makes one live in constant fear. How can it be that easy?”

... ...

Ye Yuan’s words immediately caused a strong backlash.

This Alchemy Hall was Lord Witchcloud’s painstaking effort. Each of them also made great efforts for the sake of resisting the divine race.

But reaching Ye Yuan’s mouth, it was like these efforts were not worth mentioning anymore.

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said solemnly, “How strong the divine race is, I think that everyone is clearer than me! The Alchemy Hall is strong, but among the divine race, there are also alchemy path powerhouses who aren’t inferior to us! We have to defeat the divine race. Do you all feel that with your level, it’s enough?”

The Alchemy Hall’s strength was indeed stronger than the alchemy path of later generations.

It was just that, it was still not strong enough

This level was definitely not up to the level that made the divine race apprehensive.

“Heh, who doesn’t know how to brag? Didn’t Lord Chief Instructor observe us refining pills? Then about the problems we have, Lord Chief Instructor, please point them out! If Lord Chief Instructor can help us improve our strength, we’re naturally willing too,” Yang Xiong said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Okay, then I’ll say them one by one.”

As he said, he came before Yang Xiong and held his palm out. That quasi-Dao pill suspended in the palm of his hand.

“Senior Yang Xiong’s strength is formidable, but your foundation is too shallow,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The moment Yang Xiong heard, his lungs also exploded in anger. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He was already rank three source, Ye Yuan actually said that his foundation was shallow!

These words were really humiliating!

“Oh? Why don’t Lord Chief Instructor talk about how this old man’s foundation is shallow?” Yang Xiong said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan ignored his anger and continued saying, “When Senior refined until the two-third mark, do you have a feeling of the spirit being willing, but the flesh is weak? The first half process of this medicinal pill can be rated as perfect. But later on, as the fusion of laws became more and more complex, the problem of your shallow foundation got exposed. Also, Senior’s control over heat is similarly like so ...”

Ye Yuan talked on and on in a flow of eloquence, pointing out Yang Xiong’s problems one by one.

Yang Xiong originally still had a disdainful look. But later on, the shock in his heart was already showing on his face.

The problems that Ye Yuan pointed out did not have the slightest error!

In the view of those people whose strength was lacking, his pill refinement had naturally reached the acme of perfection.

But in the eyes of true experts, his pill refinement could be said to be full of flaws, especially in the latter half of the process.

Even the expression on Witchcloud’s face became more and more serious.

He naturally knew about Yang Xiong’s problems. But he did not expect that Ye Yuan observed so many people at the same time and could actually still see it so meticulously.

With these many people, even he did not know, but Ye Yuan saw it.

Thinking about it carefully, it was indeed the case!

“Senior, are there any mistakes with what I said?” Ye Yuan said.

Yang Xiong opened his mouth, wanting to refute, but could not speak.

Witchcloud sucked in a deep breath and said, “What Young Friend Ji said isn’t wrong at all! It’s just that, attributing these flaws to a shallow foundation is likely not appropriate, right? Yang Xiong is also a patriarch-level powerhouse already. So how can he have this kind of problem?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, don’t be anxious. The Alchemy Hall’s people basically all have problems with unstable foundations. After I point out all of their problems, I’ll talk about them together.”
