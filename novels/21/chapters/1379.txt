1383 You Probably Can“t Be Human Anymore Today

Not a single person expected it!

Other than Ye Yuan, everyone did not expect it!

Ye Yuan killed her just like this!

The whole place was quiet for several breaths, their heads not quite able to wrap itself around it.

Even Little Fatty, Xie Jingyi, was utterly dumbfounded.

Although this year of investigation shocked and appalled him, the original intention of him doing so was also merely expressing an attitude.

Although he also felt that Qin Peiyu deserved death, he had never thought of really sentencing her to death. He just wanted to teach her a lesson.

With this, Ye Yuan really poked a hole in the sky!

“Why wouldn’t I dare to do it? Her crimes are sufficient to die a hundred times already,” Ye Yuan said coolly as he did not feel that there was anything wrong with his way of doing things.

“Y-Y-You ... Where’s the proof? Where?!” Xie Zhaoyun suddenly roared.

“Killed then killed, need what proof?” Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said.

“W-Well killed!”

“Well killed!”

“This demoness deserved death long ago!”

...

The reactions of the onlooking people seemed to be half a beat slower, only coming to a realization at this time, calling out tumultuously.

The crowd was virtually unanimous!

This Qin Peiyu deserved death!

Ye Yuan looked at Xie Zhaoyun and said coolly, “You saw it, this is the will of the people! This whore has long incurred the wrath of gods and men already!”

“W-Well killed! This whore’s death isn’t regrettable!” Xie Jingyi suddenly came forward and said in a clear voice, “The Qin Family’s people, listen up! This matter started because of me, so whatever means there are, feel free to aim at me. Lord Fatty, I, will take it all!”

Little Fatty’s voice had yet to fade when a terrifying aura locked onto him at once.

A figure leaped up, raising his hand and smacking a palm over towards him and Ye Yuan.

This palm could topple mountains and overturn the seas, and actually had the might of heaven and earth.

This person was none other than precisely Qin Nantian!

“Ye Yuan punk! Today, if I, Qin Nantian, don’t exterminate you, I vow to not be human!”

How could the palm of an Origin Deity powerhouse be what Ye Yuan and Xie Jingyi, just Grotto Profound martial artists, could resist?

Except, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of resisting at all. He just stood with his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Then you probably ... can’t be human anymore today.”

Right then, another formidable and unparalleled palm force rushed out from the side.

Bang!

The air billows formed by the clash of two mighty Origin Deity powerhouses’ palms directly sent the slightly weaker martial artists below the platform flying.

Qin Nantian’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a cold voice, “Chi Fang, what’s the meaning of this? Don’t forget where this place is! Wu Meng Capital City’s affairs aren’t your Myriad Treasure Tower’s turn to come and intervene!”

This person was precisely Chi Fang!

Chi Fang gave Ye Yuan a glance and had a helpless look too.

He did not think that this guy was so decisive, killing at the drop of a hat.

But this kind of situation at present, he was unable to sit by idly and remain indifferent too. He could only come forward.

“Qin Family Head is too serious. The Myriad Treasure Tower under City Lord, His Excellency’s, jurisdiction, is similarly a part of Wu Meng Capital City. This point, Chi Fang dare not forget,” Chi Fang said neither obsequiously nor haughtily.

Qin Nantian’s expression turned cold, and he said solemnly, “In that case, your Myriad Treasure Tower is going to protect this brat and completely go to war with the Qin Family?”

Chi Fang smiled and said, “Qin Family Head is truly somewhat irrational when speaking in a violent rage. Ye Yuan is my Myriad Treasure Tower’s guest alchemist, and he is also Wu Meng Academy’s student. Qin Family Head killing people on the streets is a bit too overboard, right?”

The moment Chi Fang’s words came out, everyone’s faces visibly changed.

Even Qin Nantian was secretly alarmed too, his furious state of mind also calming down slightly.

“What? This young man is actually the Myriad Treasure Tower’s guest alchemist at such a young age?”

“The Myriad Treasure Tower’s One-star Alchemy Gods are as plentiful as oxen hair. Why would they take in such a kid who’s still wet behind his ears to be a guest alchemist?”

“No wonder this brat is so confident. It turns out that he actually had such a reliance!”

...

Everyone all knew that the Myriad Treasure Tower did not lack alchemists!

Guest alchemists, they absolutely would not casually find a person to make up the numbers, especially a One-star Alchemy God.

In Wu Meng Capital City’s Myriad Treasure Tower, One-star Alchemy Gods were as plentiful as oxen hair. Two-star Alchemy Gods were not few as well.

If Ye Yuan did not have aspects that surpassed people, the Myriad Treasure Tower absolutely would not hire him to be a guest alchemist.

“Chi Fang! You saw it too! This boy killed my daughter under the circumstances where there was completely no evidence! Could my Qin Family be so easy to knead? Today, he must die!” Qin Nantian said in a cold voice.

The moment Qin Nantian’s voice faded, another two figures dashed up the platform, surrounding Chi Fang three people in the center!

These three people were actually all Origin Deity Realm mighty experts!

No matter how powerful Chi Fang was, he was also unable to fight three people alone.

“Tomorrow morning, the proof will be placed on Commander Zhao’s desk!”

At this time, a dignified voice suddenly sounded out.

A figure descended from the sky, causing an uproar.

“Flying through the air! Could ... Could it be City Lord, His Excellency, descending?”

“Pooh! Inexperienced fellow, in this Wu Meng Capital City, the ones who can fly are not just City Lord, His Excellency, alone!”

“That’s the Myriad Treasure Tower’s tower lord, Han Tian, a half-step Divine Lord Realm powerhouse!”

...

Han Tian looked at Qin Nantian and said, “Family Head Nantian is eager because you cherish your daughter, it’s understandable. But your daughter has indeed done quite a number of things that enrage both gods and men. It’s just that everybody dared to be indignant, but dare not speak because of the Qin Family’s power. Since this matter involves my Myriad Treasure Tower’s guest alchemist, this Han can’t sit by idly and remain indifferent either. This matter ... will be handed over to Commander Zhao to make a verdict. I wonder what Family Head Nantian’s opinion is?”

Han Tian’s appearance caught Qin Nantian by surprise.

What kind of figure was Han Tian?

That was a figure on the same level as his father, the Qin Family’s Grand Elder!

One could say that this Wu Meng Capital City, apart from City Lord, His Excellency, it was Han Tian, this level of a powerhouse!

Him coming forward, the weight of his words was completely different.

Qin Nantian never dreamed that a puny little Ye Yuan could actually make such a big shot come forward in person!

The Qin Family had long investigated Ye Yuan inside out and knew that Ye Yuan did not have any backing at all.

To talk about his greatest reliance, it was probably the Essence Cultivating Pill.

It was just that, a mere middle-grade Tier 1 divine pill could make Han Tian, this kind of character, come forward?

The Qin Family and Myriad Treasure Tower’s relationship was not considered good, but not considered bad either.

Han Tian actually utterly fell out with the Qin Family for such an insignificant brat, this did not look like a good deal no matter what!

Qin Nantian’s expression was incomparably ugly. Han Tian’s words were already said until like this, what could he do?

The matters in the city naturally needed the City Lord Manor to make a ruling.

Commander Zhao from Han Tian’s words was called Zhao Yi, the city guards’ head commander.

Wu Meng City Lord normally did not run things. The matters in the city were normally all handed to Zhao Yi to handle.

Unless it involved Han Tian, this level of a powerhouse, otherwise, it was sufficient for Zhao Yi to handle.

This matter got into such a mess, it naturally needed a conclusion. Zhao Yi to handle was naturally the most suitable. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Since Tower Lord Han personally came forward, Nantian naturally dare not say anything! I want to see just what proof your Myriad Treasure Tower can take out! If the proof is insufficient, Nantian still has to personally put this kid to death!”

Han Tian said coolly, “If Ye Yuan mistakenly killed a good person, this Han naturally can’t shield him either!”
