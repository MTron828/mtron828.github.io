Chapter 1776 Give to You.

Tigerheart suddenly trembled. His figure suddenly shot out explosively.

Breaking through to late-stage rank four, Tigerheart’s speed increased explosively, arriving at Ye Yuan’s side in a blink of an eye. He directly hauled Ye Yuan up and left.

Getting hit by only a single move, Ye Yuan’s insides were in upheaval, already sustaining serious injuries.

But at this time, Ning Tianping fell into heavy encirclement and found it very hard to break free.

Ye Yuan forcefully suppressed his injuries. Waving his hand, it was a dozen over rays of sword light, directly hacking those fierce beasts into pieces.

“Go!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, pulling Ning Tianping and getting on the tiger back together.

Behind them, a group of fierce beasts was in hot pursuit.

Fortunately, Tigerheart’s speed was extremely fast. Those fierce beasts could not catch up for the time being.

“Are you alright, Your Excellency?” Ning Tianping asked with a concerned look. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I’m fine! I’ll recover from my injuries first!”

As he said, Ye Yuan swallowed a medicinal pill and immediately started recuperating from his injuries on Tigerheart’s back.

That blow from the Sky Thunder Raging Ox Beast was extremely heavy. If it were an ordinary Fifth Firmament Divine Lord, they would have long been slaughtered.

“This Heavenly Dao tattoo is indeed powerful. Otherwise, even if I have the Nine Transformations Golden Body, I probably couldn’t withstand this blow either, right?” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion in his heart.

Entering the Heavenspan Mountain’s realm fog that time and obtaining this Heavenspan Mountain tattoo, he truly benefited endlessly.

After a short while, Ye Yuan’s complexion gradually became rosy.

“Your Excellency, that bunch of fierce beasts are like crazy, chasing us all the way and not letting us go!” Tigerheart said.

Ye Yuan’s face fell slightly and he said, “These fierce beasts seem to want to force us to a certain place! I feel that they seem to be controlled by something.”

From the beginning, Ye Yuan felt that the states of these fierce beasts were not right.

The moment these words came out, Tigerheart and Ning Tianping’s expressions both changed drastically.

“This ... Then what should we do?” Ning Tianping said worriedly.

Ye Yuan mused for a moment, his eyes revealing a firm look as he said, “Since someone wants to meet us, then let’s make a trip!”

Ning Tianping and Tigerheart were naturally very worried. But since Ye Yuan made a decision, they still carried it out firmly.

Ye Yuan naturally did not want to go through dangers. But if White Light was thrown in, then he very likely encountered danger too.

Since that was the case, he had to take this risk.

Just as they were running, a gloomy and dark cave entrance appeared ahead.

Before approaching yet, a gust of Yin wind directly blew over, making the three people feel a chill from the bottom of their hearts.

“Your Excellency, what a terrifying Yin wind. There’s likely an extremely powerful existence inside here!” Ning Tianping said.

Ye Yuan’s face fell and he said, “Go in!”

Tigerheart did not hesitate in the slightest. With a few lunges, he dashed straight in.

“Your Excellency, those fierce beasts ... didn’t seem to have chased in!” Tigerheart said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Looks like it was someone who wanted us to enter this place! Come, let’s go in. I want to take a look and what the hell this place has.”

...

After Ye Yuan three people’s figures disappeared, four to five figures appeared at the entrance of the cave.

These few people were each riding a mount.

“Heh, that rank five evil spirit inside, we were just vexed over being unable to deal with it. I didn’t expect that there were two suckers who delivered themselves to the doorstep,” said one of the gray-robed men[1].

The gray-robed man rode a white tiger, his aura seemingly very powerful.

“It’s still Eldest Senior Brother who is brilliant! Evil spirits like to possess humans the most. Once it seizes possession of those two scapegoats, it will definitely be in a period of weakness. At that time, we’ll be able to sit down and reap the spoils without lifting a finger. The Yin Spirit Stone and the Nine Yin Soul Devouring Grass inside this Blackspirit Cave will be ours!” Beside the gray-robed man, a girl dressed in a fiery-red long skirt said.

“Haha, as long as we get these two items, our Spirit Controlling Sect will definitely take first place in this trial.” Another person said.

The gray-robed man continued saying, “Speaking of which, that Fifth Firmament Divine Lord guy has such powerful strength! Under the encirclement and assault of hundreds of fierce beasts, he could actually make a full retreat. If his realm was a little higher, I’m afraid we won’t even be his match.”

Speaking of this, the other few people’s faces turned slightly apprehensive.

Ye Yuan three people’s actions had actually always been under their surveillance.

But the combat power that Ye Yuan exhibited made each and every one of them extremely shocked.

A Fifth Firmament Divine Lord was actually still able to make a full retreat under the encirclement and suppression of a group of late-stage rank four fierce beasts.

What was even more frightening was that there was even a peak late-stage rank four fierce beast inside.

At first, they only wanted to scare Ye Yuan and force Ye Yuan away.

As for Tigerheart’s life or death, they did not care at all.

Who knew that Ye Yuan actually did not escape and instead rushed into the beast horde alone.

Fortunately, that peak late-stage rank four fierce beast’s strength was quite powerful and could still suppress Ye Yuan.

Otherwise, it would really be tough for them to operate.

Even so, they were also startled by the combat power Ye Yuan displayed.

The face of the woman in red clothes also revealed a look of surprise and said, “The cultivation method that this guy cultivates is different from ours. He likely came in from the Heavenspan World. Could it be that ... the Heavenspan World’s martial artists are all so powerful?”

The gray-robed man shook his head and said, “Impossible! That kid is definitely a top prodigy in the Heavenspan World! Sword Dao law fused with third firmament spatial law, such talent is rare in the world. Even in the Heavenspan World, it’s absolutely impossible for him to be an unknown person too. He must be a major faction’s top disciple. However, this has nothing to do with us. Either way, he’s dead for sure. Let’s go in. I reckon that that kid had already been taken possession of right now. Dragging it on won’t be good for us.”

Finished talking, the few people entered inside the cave together.

This cave was very similar to the Yin Wind Den that Ye Yuan entered back then. But the evil spirits inside were clearly much more powerful compared to the Yin Wind Den.

However, the strengths of the Spirit Controlling Sect’s people were also extremely strong.

Especially the gray-robed man, his strength already reached half-step Celestial Deity Realm, the strongest existence among the party.

Ordinary evil spirits could not approach him at all.

The party gradually went deep in and also became especially careful.

Suddenly, two figures appeared ahead. The gray-robed man focused his eyes and looked. Who was it if not Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping?

The gray-robed man swept a glance around the cave and discovered that there was indeed no longer that rank five evil spirit, and was immediately overjoyed.

“Hahaha, you two fools, indeed seized possession of these two humans! Now, I’ll send you guys on your way! The Yin Spirit Stone and the Nine Yin Soul Devouring Grass are our Spirit Controlling Sect’s!” said the gray-robed man as he laughed loudly.

Right at this time, an icy-cold aura came out from Ye Yuan’s body.

He suddenly opened his mouth, looked at the gray-robed man, and said, “You deserve death!”

The gray-robed man was indifferent and said coolly, “I deserve death? Hahaha, if you were at your prime, I’d be somewhat scared of you. This appearance right now, best forget about this kind of threatening!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was icy-cold, his body emitting waves of gloomy and cold aura.

A terrifying figure drifted out of Ye Yuan’s body.

The gray-robed man’s expression changed drastically and he said in disbelief, “This ... How is this possible? You ... You weren’t possessed?”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Like to be possessed so much? Then, I’ll give him to you!”

[1] I don’t know why 2 instead of 3, maybe Tigerheart wasn’t considered since they were riding on his back?
