Chapter 1693 Who Dictates?

“They came for the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain?”

Ye Yuan did not reveal a visible change in countenance, appearing very calm.

He did not understand what this Golden Sword Pact was. But Utmost Peace Imperial City provoked them time and again. Apart from the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, there was likely no other possibilities.

Zuo Shujie nodded and said, “They activated the Golden Sword Pact and mentioned that they wanted us to hand over the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain! If not for the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, Utmost Peace Imperial City also would not go through such great trouble.”

Even under the command of the same heavenly emperor, the relationship between imperial cities was also not very harmonious.

Imperial cities were different from capital cities. Because of the geographical relationship, imperial cities were extremely far apart. It was also impossible for the imperial capital to be able to control every imperial city.

Hence, an imperial city of this level was actually relatively independent.

Therefore, some friction often happened between imperial cities, and it was also very normal.

Even if there was a valid reason, there was no incident of one imperial city destroying another in a normal situation. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

An imperial city was equivalent to the mortal world’s vassal state.

And one imperial city making a move against another imperial city needed to issue a Golden Sword Token to the other party!

The Golden Sword Pact that Utmost Peace Imperial City activated was the first mode of the Golden Sword Token. It was considered relatively gentle.

This was the direct contention between both sides’ upper echelons. The loser would have to hand over the item that the other party asked for with both hands!

And the second mode was to directly shatter this golden sword. Then it was an irreconcilable-till-death situation for both sides.

The two imperial cities would be plunged into war.

Ye Yuan gained a clear item of this Golden Sword Pact and asked Zuo Shujie, “City Lord, that Utmost Peace Imperial City’s city lord, I don’t know if you’re his match. Are you?”

Zuo Shujie’s eyes narrowed slightly, extremely shocked in his heart.

Could the meaning in Ye Yuan’s words be to really have a life-and-death struggle with Utmost Peace Imperial City?

He shook his head and said, “Ye Yuan, I know that you aren’t willing, but Utmost Peace Imperial City is powerful and is a mid-upper imperial city in strength among our Southridge Ten Cities. Our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City has no way of competing. As for that Qiao Anshan, even though he’s the same as me, both second-layered heaven Celestial Deities, he ... is already a peak second-layered heaven Celestial Deity. I’m not his match.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then if ... I lend you the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain?”

Zuo Shujie’s entire body trembled and he said rather excitedly, “If I have the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain in possession, I have at least 70% assurance to defeat him!”

However, he immediately became dejected and continued: “It’s no use. Utmost Peace has four great celestial deities. Even though three of them are first-layered heaven celestial deities, He Chong alone isn’t a match.”

Ye Yuan held his palm out, a small black hill emerged.

“City Lord, it is not that Ye Yuan is stingy. But this Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain is still very useful to Ye Yuan. Otherwise, even giving to you is fine. In these ten years, the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain will be under the charge of City Lord. I hope that City Lord uses it to win victory at the unfurling of the flag!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s palm pushed, the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain landed in Zuo Shujie’s hand.

Zuo Shujie’s shock was by no means insignificant. He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so generous, to be willing to lend the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain for him to use.

Before waiting for him to get over his shock, Ye Yuan took out another dark yellow-colored rope.

Zuo Shujie and He Chong’s gazes turned intent and they cried out, “Immortal Binding Rope!”

Ye Yuan threw the Immortal Binding Rope to He Chong and said with a smile, “Grand Elder, this Immortal Binding Rope is useless to this Ye, give it to you.”

At this time, He Chong’s entire person was in a daze.

He had never thought that he would actually own a celestial deity mystic treasure one day!

This was a celestial deity mystic treasure! Ye Yuan gave it to him just like this?

“This ... Is this ... really ... given to me?” He Chong still had a look of disbelief until now.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Can this still be fake? Lend me a gallbladder and I also won’t dare to crack jokes with Grand Elder.”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s eyes, He Chong was convinced that he was not joking with him.

He Chong sucked in a deep breath and said to Ye Yuan, “Alright, then I won’t be pretentious anymore! Ye Yuan, if you have any needs in the future, feel free to ask me!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Even if Grand Elder doesn’t say, Ye Yuan has to ask the two of you for help too.”

Zuo Shujie and He Chong exchanged a glance, both seeing surprise from the other party’s eyes.

Seemed like this Ye Yuan had long had a plan in mind!

Ye Yuan said, “In these ten years, the two of you please collect more rank four spirit medicines back, the more the better! As for the Golden Sword Pact, the two of you can rest assured. They won’t be cocky soon enough!”

Zuo Shujie and He Chong suddenly felt that this world already did not belong to them.

They came to urge Ye Yuan to leave, but now, it was different. Ye Yuan had one word for them: fight!

Could a first-layered heaven Divine Lord be dictating this struggle between Celestial Deity Realms?

Thinking about it, the two people felt that it was inconceivable.

Xuan Yu was rather worried as he said, “Ye Yuan, there are only ten years more. Do you ... have confidence in refining the Supreme Jade Void Pill within ten years?”

“What? Supreme Jade Void Pill?”

Although they were Celestial Deity powerhouses, Zuo Shujie and He Chong’s reactions were no different from Coldfeather and the others previously.

Supreme Jade Void Pill, this term, was too distant from them.

At this time, the two of them finally understood where Ye Yuan’s confidence lay.

Ye Yuan said, “I don’t know either, but I will give it my best! All in all, running isn’t a solution. Activating the Golden Sword Token this time, they are clearly coming for us. Even if I really leave, they probably won’t let Heavenly Eagle Imperial City go that easily either.”

Having said this, Ye Yuan’s expression turned cold and he said, “Since they dared to reach their hands out, then they’ll have to be prepared to be bitten!”

Ye Yuan was naturally not willing to leave. At present, close to 400 years had passed. There was still around 100 years to the 500-year-agreement.

Leaving at this time, if he missed Li-er and they all, there would be many twists and turns again.

Ye Yuan had long made a decision in his heart. Since he was not able to avoid it, then just battle!

He wanted to rely on his own power and let the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City become powerful!

...

At Utmost Peace Imperial City, Qiao Anshan’s gaze swept over the group of powerhouses below and said coolly, “This time, we must obtain the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain! If Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s people are impervious to reason, then kill without mercy!”

Wen Yilin said, “This kid called Ye Yuan has escaped several calamities time and again. This time, we absolutely can’t let him get away!”

Qiao Anshan said, “Relax, this seat has already laid down an all-encompassing net, just waiting for him to escape! Zuo Shujie that coward, after receiving the Golden Sword Token, he’ll definitely let Ye Yuan escape!”

Wen Yilin gave a thumbs up and praised, “City Lord truly takes every conceivable possibility into account! This punk called Ye Yuan is truly tired of living, to actually dare provoke a lion in its den! Not only did he kill Gao Yuan, he even snatched away the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain and Immortal Binding Rope. If he doesn’t die, it will be hard for this old man to dispel the hatred in my heart!”

Qiao Anshan smiled and said, “Relax, he’s dead for sure this time! Also, you get Yang Fan to prepare well. This time ... let him personally avenge Gao Yuan!”
