Chapter 2128: The Condition to Become a Supreme Powerhouse

“Ji Mo, how do you feel about the trip to Westspirit Region?” Sacred Ancestor High Priest looked at the Ji Mo in front of him and said with a smile that was not a smile.

With Ye Yuan clearing the hurdle, Ji Mo hastily bade farewell to Ye Yuan very quickly and returned to report to Sacred Ancestor High Priest on the mission. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At this time, Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s 11 disciples were all present.

It was just that their expressions appeared somewhat awkward, especially High Priest Redplume.

Ji Mo blushed with shame. But thinking of Ye Yuan’s soul-stirring Tai Ji developing Dao, he could not help revealing a look of admiration.

He bowed and said, “Master, Ji Mo is completely convinced! Second Sage is prodigious and is bound to be a big shot that shakes heaven and earth in the future!”

While talking, Ji Mo was very respectful.

When he mentioned Ye Yuan, it was actually like facing a senior.

If High Priest Stardrive’s demeanor was seen by people, they would definitely be incomparably shocked.

Wing laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “You apprentice brothers few people have always been arrogant at heart and haughty in manner. Apart from Master, you’ve never submitted to anyone. I didn’t expect that this time, you were actually subdued by Ye Yuan!”

Ji Mo smiled bitterly and said, “If not for seeing with my own eyes, Ji Mo finds it really hard to believe that there’s actually such an alchemy rare talent in this world! Second Sage seems to be born for Alchemy Dao. A short thousand over years and he can actually spy right at the source of Great Dao. It truly makes people sigh with admiration!”

The event during this half a year, Ji Mo felt as if it was right in front of his eyes.

Each finger that Ye Yuan pointed out seemed to have the effect of shocking the soul.

Wing smiled and looked towards High Priest Redplume and said, “Yan Hui, do you ... still have resentment in your heart now?”

High Priest Redplume’s expression was slightly red as he bowed and said, “Replying master, Yan Hui ... is convinced! It’s just, Yan Hui doesn’t understand why he, a Six-star priest, can actually do it to this step?”

Wing put away his smile and said, “Actually, this performance also made Master incredibly shocked! About this Ask Not chess game, Master has researched for tens of millions of years and was unable to achieve fusing Dao into one, but ... he did it! Looks like the day of my showdown with him isn’t far already!”

Letting Ji Mo bring Ask Not over, what Wing expected was not for Ye Yuan to break the deadlock.

Even if he sealed 50% of the power, breaking the deadlock was also not what Ye Yuan’s bit of strength could accomplish.

But Ye Yuan’s performance far exceeded his expectations.

Ye Yuan actually solved the puzzle of tens of millions of years and created a new world.

Such a result shocked the world.

It naturally also included him, Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

“Could it be that his understanding of Alchemy Dao already surpasses Master?” Yan Hui said in puzzlement.

Wing shook his head and said, “Surpassing master is naturally impossible. Him being able to complete such a heroic feat actually has elements of gaining advantage through trickery. But he has already taken his own Dao path. That’s the most crucial thing!”

“His own Dao path?” The disciples were all uncertain.

Wing slowly nodded and said, “Back then, when you all challenged the Ask Not chess game, you were all willing to be chess pieces, playing chess with Medicine Ancestor under Master’s manipulation. This is also to say that you all are walking according to the path that Master designated. Therefore, even if tens of millions of years have passed, the path that you all have taken is also merely a branch of master’s. Wanting to surpass Master is simply impossible! And looking at the Heavenspan World, sovereigns that can tide over Third Blight and above must have their own path(Dao)[1].”

When the group of disciples heard this, their facial expressions changed wildly.

This was their first time hearing the secret of becoming a sovereign powerhouse.

Wing’s words stirred up tumultuous waves in their hearts.

For countless years, they revered Master as a god. But only today did they discover that turns out they merely walked Master’s path.

“Master, this ...” Eldest Disciple Splitfeather said in great shock.

Wing waved his hand and said, “Master knows what you want to say, but that’s impossible! Unless you have the tremendous resolve to give up everything you possess now and start again anew!”

Splitfeather’s expression flickered incessantly and finally turned into a long sigh.

Wing smiled and said, “Are you all blaming Master for only telling you guys this now?”

Splitfeather was terrified as he said, “D-Disciple dares not.”

Their mouths said dare not, but did they really not have any thoughts in their hearts?

Wing naturally knew what they were thinking and said with a chortle, “Major powers that are Third Blight and above, how many do you think you can find in this Heavenspan World? From that moment when you all chose to submit inside Ask Not, your lifetime’s path was also decided. Want to become a sovereign, perseverance, willpower, talent, not one can be lacking! You all ask yourselves. If you guys are given a chance to redo it again, can you achieve Ye Yuan’s level?”

The group of apprentice brothers exchanged glances. In the end, they actually lowered their heads without any prior agreement.

The answer was clearly no.

They understood Ask Not too well!

Not submitting, it was death!

The will of a sovereign, they could not resist it at all.

But Ye Yuan could!

During these tens of millions of years, only Ye Yuan alone replaced the Sacred Ancestor’s will when challenging Ask Not, and he played a game of chess against Medicine Ancestor.

Just this point, they were already unable to surpass.

As for challenging Ask Not the second time, Ye Yuan rose up heaven-defyingly, contending with the pinnacle will of two great sovereigns with his power alone. This was even more inconceivable.

They were thrown even further behind until they could only see the dust ahead.

Hence, Ye Yuan could become Second Sage, while they could not!

Wing’s meaning was very simple. Their talents and will were insufficient to become a supreme powerhouse.

Being able to have today’s accomplishment was already a great fortune.

There were many geniuses in this world. But those truly able to tread out their own path and become a supreme powerhouse, were extremely, extremely few.

“Walking other people’s path is easy! Taking your own path is as hard as ascending to heaven! For Master being able to walk till today, how can the experiences involved be what you all can imagine? For Ye Yuan to be able to have such accomplishments at a young age, his story is likely even more exciting than the vast majority of this Heavenspan World’s supreme powerhouses!” Wing said.

Ji Mo mused and said, “In this case, that Tai Ji diagram was Ye Yuan’s Dao?”

Wing nodded and said, “Although his Dao is at the nascent level, that Tai Ji diagram gave me a feeling of being as deep as the sea. Martial Dao is difficult, but Alchemy Dao is even harder! However, I have a feeling that Ye Yuan’s future accomplishments might even be above mine and Medicine Ancestor’s!”

The group of apprentice brothers trembled all over, looking at Master in disbelief.

This appraisal was too high!

Medicine Ancestor was only a hair’s breadth away from Dao Ancestor.

Could it be that Ye Yuan could become the real Medicine Ancestor in the future?

Yan Hui’s face changed and he said, “In this case, isn’t Master warming a snake in your bosom?”

“Hahaha ... warming a snake in my bosom? Everyone is afraid of losing. The more powerful, the more afraid of failure! But they have forgotten. It’s precisely failure that let him walk until this step today! The Medicine Ancestor is afraid of being surpassed by me, so he has always been suppressing me, not letting me lift my head. But reaching Master’s realm, wanting to improve another step further is far too difficult! Master needs an opponent! Moreover, this insult, master has already held it in for 50 million years! Even if I lose to Ye Yuan, there’s still him going to challenge Medicine Ancestor! Watching him lose is also a very merry thing, so I don’t see any reason why not,” Wing said with a big laugh.
