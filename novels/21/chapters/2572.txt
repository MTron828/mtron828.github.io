Chapter 2578: This Lesser Sublime Heaven Is a Little Impressive!

“B-Broken?”

“Broken!”

“Really broken?”

“Really broken!”

… …

Everyone swarmed over to watch Lu Zhanyuan’s grand display of invincible might.

Who would have thought that the perpetrator had not been seen yet, and Lu Zhanyuan directly had his legs broken and thrown out? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Until now, everyone still had not quite come back to their senses.

Li Zhuo who was by the side was directly dumbfounded.

He thought that Lu Zhanyuan could take revenge for him. Li Zhuo did not expect that he was so useless.

Although he had his legs broken, Lu Zhanyuan was still twitching non-stop, looking very comical.

An inner disciple who was experienced and knowledgeable cried out in surprise, “Windward Topple! This must be Windward Topple! I didn’t expect that the master of this courtyard actually had such a fierce anesthetic! Furthermore, his method of poisoning is strange and unpredictable! Senior Apprentice Brother Lu really kicked an iron plate at this place!”

Somebody asked, “Senior Apprentice Brother Xu, is this Windward Topple very powerful?”

Senior Apprentice Brother Xu gave a cold laugh and said, “Powerful??Huhu!?Under Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, there’s no cure! Even if it’s a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, once inflicted with Windward Topple, their strength will fall greatly too! How can the level of anesthetic be explained with just powerful? However, this anesthetic is extremely difficult to extract. Even for ordinary grade two heavenly alchemists, it’s very hard to do it too! Didn’t expect that this Little Cloud Courtyard’s master actually has it! This person can’t be provoked!”

Finished saying, Senior Apprentice Brother Xu gave the courtyard a glance rather warily, turned around, and left.

The puny little Thousand Bird Peak became everyone’s focal point very quickly!

This matter caused a great sensation in the inner-sect and outer-sect!

A fellow who had not even entered the sect yet, his movements and traces being elusive and secretive, actually broke the legs of the inner sect’s top three, Lu Zhanyuan!

Of course, Lu Zhanyuan became the laughing stock of the inner-sect too.

Many inner disciples could not help coming to Little Cloud Courtyard, but no one dared to approach.

Windward Topple was too formidable. They did not wish to go out spasming.

But the more it was so, the more mysterious Little Cloud Courtyard seemed.

Little Cloud Courtyard’s master had never gone out before.

If there was anything, it was also his apprentice doing it on his behalf.

When Yao Qing heard about this incident, he was incredibly shocked too.

Lu Zhanyuan’s prowess, he was deeply aware of it.

With his strength, he could not last past three moves under Lu Zhanyuan’s hands at all.

But Lu Zhanyuan actually succumbed at Ye Yuan’s hands!

People were all guessing that Little Cloud Courtyard’s master must be a grade two heavenly alchemist, or even a grade three heavenly alchemist!

But only he knew that Ye Yuan was merely a Lesser Sublime Heaven, that was all!

After this matter, no one dared to provoke Little Cloud Courtyard anymore, and no one dared to be disrespectful to Green Bull Town’s ascenders as well.

Over the course of a year, there were ascenders being taken to Thousand Bird Peak one after another.

On Thousand Bird Peak, it gradually became lively.

After the one-year date was up, it was finally time for the heavenly sect’s assessment.

On this day, there were many more pairs of eyes at the entrance of Little Cloud Courtyard.

People all wanted to see just what kind of person this Little Cloud Courtyard’s owner was.

Among them included Lu Zhanyuan!

Lu Zhanyuan only recovered after lying on the bed for three months.

In Five Light Heavenly Region, heavenly pills were extremely precious.

In most cases of broken legs, it all relied on self-recovery.

Even if Lu Zhanyuan was an inner disciple, he did not dare to consume this kind of healing heavenly pills easily too.

“Out! Coming out!”

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd.

Little Cloud Courtyard’s door opened!

Everyone held their breaths, wanting to see clearly what kind of person was coming out!

A young man in white robes walked out of Little Cloud Courtyard.

Behind him even followed Lin Lan.

“L-Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum?”

“Little Cloud Courtyard’s master is actually just a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum? Furthermore, it’s even just an upper Lesser Sublime Heaven?”

“In this one year, the guy who caused a stir in the entire inner sect is actually just a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum?”

… …

The crowd burst into an uproar all at once.

No one expected that the master of Little Cloud Courtyard was actually just an unassuming Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Furthermore, looking at Ye Yuan’s appearance, he only broke through to upper Lesser Sublime Heaven not long ago.

Lu Zhanyuan was even more stunned. Immediately, he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “I actually lost at the hands of a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum? Deep humiliation! Unprecedented humiliation!”

He had thought of countless possibilities and even wondered if Little Cloud Courtyard’s master was a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum expert or not!

But they never expected that it was actually a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Swoosh!

Lu Zhanyuan turned into an afterimage and rushed over toward Ye Yuan.

“Damn ant, to dare humiliate me, I’ll kill you today!” The roar instantly spread all over Thousand Bird Peak.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s gaze looked over.

Just this look and Lu Zhanyuan’s figure stopped abruptly!

This look filled him with fear!

That unbearable memory instantly welled up in his heart.

His belly full of anger instantly turned into terror!

Ye Yuan glanced at him curiously and asked Lin Lan, “Who is he?”

With one sentence, everyone fell down.

That sentence, “break the legs, throw them out”, was still being sung on every peak.

This fellow actually did not know who he beat!

Too aggravating!

Lu Zhanyuan stood there, almost spewing out a mouthful of old blood.

Lin Lan said, “A year ago, he trespassed into Little Cloud Courtyard and was brought down by Master with Windward Topple. This disciple broke his legs and threw him out.”

Ye Yuan had a sudden realization and said,?“Oh,?it turns out it’s him. No wonder he’s so angry. Hey, if you’re not happy, you’re welcome to come to find me to take revenge at any time.”

Arrogant!

Overbearing!

He completely thought nothing of the inner sect’s number three!

This Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum was a little impressive!

Everyone looked at Lu Zhanyuan sympathetically, wanting to see what he would do.

Was it taking the risk of having his legs broken again to teach Ye Yuan a lesson, or withdrawing here?

Lu Zhanyuan stood there, unable to leave nor stay, wishing to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

He really wanted to make a move!

But reason told him that he could not make a move!

If he broke his legs, it would take three months!

Wouldn’t he end up as the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s laughingstock again?

But, not making a move, he would similarly end up as a laughingstock!

Awkward!

“Not taking revenge anymore? Then I’m leaving!” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

Finished speaking, he really brought Lin Lan and left just like that.

“Looking at what? All get lost for me!” Lu Zhanyuan’s roar came from behind.

Not walking very far, Ye Yuan ran into Yao Qing head-on.

“Huhu,?Brother Ye, you’re really incredible! This one year, you were in closed-seclusion in Little Cloud Courtyard, oblivious to the outside world. But, this Martial Secure Heavenly Sect has your legends everywhere! Breaking the legs of the inner sect’s number three, Senior Apprentice Brother Lu. You’ve already done an astonishing thing before you even entered the heavenly sect! Lord Luo’s eyesight is really amazing!” Yao Qing said with a big laugh as soon as he met him.

He had just finished speaking when he suddenly discovered that the surrounding atmosphere was not quite right.

And Ye Yuan was also currently looking at him with a smile without saying a word.

Yao Qing was taken aback. Suddenly, he saw Lu Zhanyuan in the distance and was immediately frightened out of his wits.

He secretly thought to himself that things were not good. With this, he had offended Senior Apprentice Brother Lu badly!

“Huhu,?Yao Qing, you’re very good! You are very good!” Lu Zhanyuan gritted his teeth and said one sentence, then flew away.

Yao Qing looked at Ye Yuan with a bitter face and said, “Brother Ye, you’ve harmed me badly!”

Ye Yuan had an innocent face as he said, “I didn’t do anything!”
