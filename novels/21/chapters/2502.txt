Chapter 2508: Suffocatingly Strong!

The Cangyan Mountain was located west of Heavenspan Mountain. It was originally Ancestor Fire’s bodhidharma.

Now, Ancestor Fire already perished. Hence, the place became the divine race’s new holy land.

After the Doomsday Battle, Ye Yuan agreed for the divine race to enter the Heavenspan World. The divine race also started a great migration.

And the divine race’s totem, the Eight Extreme Divinities, was naturally also ‘invited’ here.

In this place with abundant spiritual energy, the eight statues appeared even more lifelike, as if they were about to come to life.

At this time, Ye Yuan already arrived outside of Cangyan Mountain.

The entire divine race was waiting in full battle-array!

“Ye Yuan, what on earth do you want to do?” Tian Qing looked at Ye Yuan from afar and questioned.

“Today, whoever dares to stop me, I’ll kill gods if gods block, and kill Buddha if Buddha blocks!” Ye Yuan’s words were full of indifference.

Tian Qing’s expression changed slightly, he felt tremendous pressure.

The Ye Yuan today became incomparably icy-cold, giving people a chill that penetrated to the bones.

Yue Mengli blocked Ye Yuan with a flash and said, “If I block you, will you kill even me?”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted slightly, the expression on his face finally having some change.

“Li-er, don’t force me!”

Yue Mengli did not back down in the slightest and said, “If you do anything for Elder Sister Lingxue, I have nothing to say. But if you want to destroy the Eight Extreme Divinities, no can do! It’s the Eight Extreme Divinities that gave me a new lease on life!”

Yue Mengli understood Ye Yuan extremely well. He just obtained the Tear of Life, but became like this, he must have failed to save Mu Lingxue.

And him choosing to come to the divine race straight away indicated that the Eight Extreme Divinities must have something to do with saving Mu Lingxue!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said in a cold voice, “Bullshit! Who said that you have a new lease on life? Only destroying the Eight Extreme Divinities can save you! And Lingxue’s only hope also lies with it!”

Yue Mengli shook her head firmly and said, “If you want to destroy the Eight Extreme Divinities, then step over my dead body!”

When Tian Qing saw this scene, he could not help letting out a slight sigh of relief.

He understood Ye Yuan, with Yue Mengli around, Ye Yuan absolutely did not dare to mess around.

Who would have thought that Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said indifferently, “Since that’s the case, then … Universe Sword Formation, open!”

Boom!

In an instant, within a radius of a thousand miles with Ye Yuan as the center, everything was shrouded in the terrifying sword energy.

Currently, the divine race’s experts were practically all covered in this domain.

Tian Qing’s expression instantly showed that he was extremely surprised.

“This … This … is a sword formation condensed from four great rules! Your Formation Dao … reached the realm of rule too?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

There were no words that could describe Tian Qing’s shock currently.

Being in the sword formation, Tian Qing did not even dare to move!

The dangerous aura radiating from the surroundings almost suffocated him!

Only all the way until at this time did he know that Ye Yuan actually already possessed the strength to instantly kill him!

In the Heavenspan Mountain battle, Ye Yuan overpowered the divine race’s five ancestors.

At that time, it was not his limit!

They were unable to force out Ye Yuan’s limit at all!

Facing five ancestors, fusing three power of rules was already sufficient.

But now, under Ye Yuan’s rage, he revealed his strongest move, shocking everybody!

This move, Universe Sword Formation, was an astonishing sword formation created based on Universe.

This sword formation fused the four great rules that Ye Yuan comprehended, and also incorporated his ultimate comprehension of Heavenly Dao!

It could be said that the power of each rule was unleashed to the limit.

The might of this move already surpassed everyone’s imaginations!

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, activating the sword formation at once!

One streak of sword energy after another pierced directly into Yue Mengli’s body.

It restrained her in an instant.

Ye Yuan flashed and Yue Mengli just happened to fall into his arms.

He knew very well how far to go and when to stop when he made his move. He only knocked Yue Mengli out and sealed the power in his body, and did not hurt her.

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, he naturally had the confidence to do it.

Restraining Yue Mengli, Ye Yuan’s eyes turned cold and he swept all around and said, “Now, who else wants to stop me?”

Tian Qing opened his mouth, only feeling full of bitterness.

The current Ye Yuan already completely exceeded his imagination.

Ye Yuan’s might was suffocating!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan put away Universe Sword Formation, carried Yue Mengli, and walked straight into the mountain. No one from the divine race dared to stop.

He did not need people to lead the way. He could feel where the Eight Extreme Divinities was at.

The divine race’s powerhouses all exchanged glances, their expressions indescribably ugly.

“L-Lord Tian Qing, how can … he be so strong?”

“Yeah, his power already surpasses the scope of monstrous! I feel like he’s a god that’s aloof from the masses! That sort of feeling is a little like facing the Eight Extreme Divinities!”

“This Ye Yuan is too terrifying! With his monstrousness, the Eight Extreme Divinities … wouldn’t really have something happen to it, right?”

… …

His voice had yet to fade when Tian Qing interrupted his words and said in a solemn voice, “Impossible! The Eight Extreme Divinities is a generous gift from heaven. It has the strength equal to heaven! No matter how strong Ye Yuan is, can he be greater than heaven?”

Everyone thought about it and felt that it made sense too.

In the eyes of the divine race, the Eight Extreme Divinities and Heavenly Dao were the same!

Touching the Eight Extreme Divinities was touching Heavenly Dao. How could Heavenly Dao tolerate you?

Tian Qing’s gaze flickered incessantly, his figure flashing, following after.

… …

Ahead was a stretch of powerful restrictions, emitting powerful undulations.

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan casually grabbed a Sword of Void and slashed a sword move over. The restrictions collapsed with a loud bang.

Unable to stop even a single blow!

When Tian Qing who was behind saw this scene, the corners of his mouth could not help twitching slightly.

Rumble?…

Powerful undulations came out of the void.

The eight statues gradually revealed their true bodies.

As if feeling the provocative intent, the eight statues glared with fierce eyes, appearing extremely angry.

That appearance seemed like they wanted to tear Ye Yuan to pieces alive.

“Brat, you came again! To dare affront the majesty of heaven again, you’ll definitely die this time!” Inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, a familiar voice came over.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to be long-winded with him. He just said indifferently, “I’ll ask, you answer! Of course, you can choose to be silent, but these eight statues, I’ll tear it down today!”

That voice said with disdain,?“Humph!?Just based on you also want to demolish the Eight Extreme Divinities? You can come and give it a try if you have the ability!”

Clearly, he was very confident.

But at this time, Tian Qing arrived and said furiously, “Ye Yuan, the Eight Extreme Divinities is an object bestowed by heaven! Affronting heaven’s might, you’ll die without a burial ground!”

Ye Yuan completely ignored Tian Qing, lifting his hand and it was a sword!

Whoosh!

Sword light flashed past, aiming straight for a statue in the middle.

But right at this time, the fork in the statue’s hand suddenly burst forth with a terrifying to the extreme energy.

Boom!

Ye Yuan only felt his chest tighten, spewing out a mouthful of blood.

That voice laughed wildly as he said,?“Hahaha?… Saw that? This is the outcome of you offending heaven’s might! Just the likes of you, an ant, also dare to resist Heavenly Dao in vain, death isn’t regrettable!”

At the back, also came Tian Qing’s cold laughter and he said, “Ye Yuan, I warned you long ago, heavenly might can’t be offended! Now, have you tasted a bitter pill? Withdraw now! Otherwise, you’ll die very miserably!”
