Chapter 2272: Myriad Region Alchemy Conference!

“Your Excellency!”

Ning Tianping walked out of the Sea of Law and bowed deeply to Ye Yuan three times.

The current Ning Tianping had sharp eyes and was full of energy, akin to a sharp sword out of its sheath. He was giving people a feeling of having acquired a completely new outlook.

His gratitude toward Ye Yuan was expressed with these three bows.

With several decades of guarding, Ye Yuan gave up cultivating. He only spent his time comprehending Great Dao.

Ye Yuan praised him, “Life and death Great Dao, not bad! Not bad! Starting from now, you’ve truly stepped onto the path of a powerhouse!”

By the side, Ru Feng was long already shocked speechless.

A human really gained enlightenment on Dao in their divine race’s sacred grounds!

If not for seeing it with his own eyes, he would definitely feel that it was absurd nonsense.

How could lowly humans possibly comprehend the divine race’s Dao?

Furthermore, during these several decades’ time, Ye Yuan completely lacked interest in these eight god statues these several decades. He did not even want to take a look.

Ru Feng originally thought that the lucky chance he was talking about was for himself.

In the end, it was only for Ning Tianping.

He looked down on even the divine race’s sacred grounds?

Someone as powerful as him also felt a sense of frustration.

“I said before, what you all comprehend is Heavenly Dao; what humans comprehend is Heavenly Dao too. Nobody is noble or lowly. Now, do you believe it?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ru Feng’s face was black, suddenly having a feeling of getting slapped.

Even though he was not willing to admit it, he still felt that if Ye Yuan went to comprehend the god statues himself, he would definitely comprehend some things easily.

But he was disdainful!

Under his escort, Ning Tianping comprehended his own Dao!

Life and death Great Dao was also a kind of extremely strong Great Dao already.

From now on, Ning Tianping would fly to the sky with one bound, his strength advancing by leaps and bounds.

Returning to the clan, Ye Yuan refined another batch of medicinal pills, threw it to Ru Feng, and said coolly, “These medicinal pills, let them consume it once every ten years. It can suppress the toxicity for 50 years. After that, you all send Rong Xiyue to find me again. I’ll give you all the antidotes.”

When Ru Feng heard this, he said in a great rage, “Boy, we’ve already satisfied all of your demands! You’re still playing this with this old man?”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “If I give you the antidote now, can I still walk out of here? Or, I’ll be killed off by you guys as soon as I leave this place.”

Ru Feng’s face fell. This lad was astute and crafty. He was really hard to deal with.

Done with these, Ye Yuan brought Ning Tianping and left the Hidden Lineage.

Seeing Ye Yuan leave the Hidden Lineage, Ru Feng also let out a long sigh in relief and hurriedly cast the secret art to completely seal off this passageway.

“Finally we sent away that plague god! Head Elder, I feel that this boy’s threat is too great. Should we send someone to kill him off?” Ru Feng said viciously.

Ji Ling shook his head and said, “This brat is too shrewd. Furthermore, he’s proficient in spatial law. He’s not what the average person can finish off. We might even get the skunk stink all over us. Her Highness Divine Daughter’s issue is the lesson learned. Want to kill him, it has to at least be late-stage Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm. But at this juncture, appearing in the Heavenspan World is too sensitive.”

Ru Feng said gloomily, “But this boy is too monstrous. I keep feeling that he poses a huge threat to our divine race and must be eliminated!”

Ji Ling nodded and said, “I naturally know that. But he can’t wait until the day he grows up! Progenitor Daymeld has already come into being. Before long, the two world’s passageway will definitely collapse entirely. At that time, in a battle at the level of progenitor, he won’t have the qualifications to intervene at all! Before that, we’d best accumulate strength and act a little safer.”

Ru Feng’s expression turned somber and he nodded his head.

... ...

Returning to Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, Ye Yuan started closed-seclusion cultivation.

He had collected a large batch of spirit medicines in the Hidden Lineage. They were sufficient for him to cultivate to peak Chaos Realm.

Moreover, it was not like he did not do anything for so many years in the Hidden Lineage’s sacred ground.

He mutually corroborated the god statues with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and had a deeper understanding of the Chaos Heavenspan Canon.

The outline of the next realm also gradually formed in Ye Yuan’s mind.

He went into closed-seclusion cultivation more to comprehend the next realm.

Ye Yuan himself was also very curious. His cultivation system was completely different from ordinary martial artists. What kind of level would he achieve if he kept cultivating the Chaos Heavenspan Canon?

Deva?

Dao Ancestor?

Since he knew that Dao Ancestors were not truly invincible under the heavens, then he should also have hopes of reaching this realm, right?

About 20 years later, Ye Yuan exited seclusion. His current realm already reached the peak Chaos Realm!

It was just that he still did not have a mature idea with regard to the next realm.

Currently, his world was a mass of chaos. Then the next step would definitely be developing a real world.

It was just that evolving a world was clearly not such a simple matter. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

His chaos world was totally different from ordinary small worlds. The method to hew it open was naturally too complicated as well.

Ordinary Heavenly Emperors grasped Dao marks after obtaining Heavenly Dao’s recognition.

While he opened up his own path and developed a world.

There was an intrinsic difference between these two.

“Looks like got to make another trip to the Heavenspan Mountain!” Ye Yuan said with an emotional sigh.

The Heavenspan Mountain was the source of myriad life, the foundation of Heavenly Dao. Only there could he feel the most fundamental source of power and could help Ye Yuan open up his own world from there.

Ye Yuan exited seclusion and discovered that Ji Mo was already waiting outside.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Ji Mo’s pupils could not help constricting.

The current Ye Yuan actually gave him a feeling of beholding a great mountain.

That sort of feeling was akin to some kind of existence above the firmament.

But clearly, Ye Yuan was just a peak Empyrean!

He discovered that each time he saw Ye Yuan again, he would give him another level of shock.

The strength of Second Sage could be described using changing with each passing day!

“I offer greetings to Second Sage!” Ji Mo gave a bow respectfully.

Ye Yuan looked at Ji Mo and was also rather surprised, saying with a smile, “I was just about to go and meet Sacred Ancestor High Priest. I didn’t expect that you came first. Finding me for?”

Ji Mo said, “Myriad Region Alchemy Conference organized a Myriad Region Alchemy Conference and invited the Heavenspan World’s various alchemy holy lands’ countless elites to the Medicine Ancestor Bodhidharma! Lord Sacred Ancestor was also on the list of invitees. He had me come to invite you and to go along together.”

Ye Yuan could not help being slightly taken aback when he heard and immediately could not help laughing as he said, “Medicine Ancestor finally can’t hold back anymore?”

Ji Mo also smiled and said, “Second Sage’s one remark reveals heaven’s secrets! Lord Sacred Ancestor said that the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time is actually organized for you!”

By the side, Bai Tong and the rest were shocked.

Hearing the Medicine Ancestor’s invitation earlier, each and every one of them still felt honored.

After all, this was the terrifying figure standing at the summit of the Heavenspan World’s alchemy path.

Being able to receive his invitation, it was absolutely an extremely honorable thing.

But when Ji Mo said this, all of them were shocked.

The Medicine Ancestor ramping up for a fight like this, stirring up the entire Heavenspan World, it was actually for Ye Yuan?

He was merely a Seven-star Alchemy God!

The others did not understand it. Only Ji Mo understood that Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao already peeked right at the source, reaching the level of Dao pill.

If Ye Yuan was an old monster who had already been famous for a long time, the Medicine Ancestor naturally would not get into a fight.

But Ye Yuan was too young!

His youth would impact the Medicine Ancestor’s status!
