Chapter 2983: First Form of Space, Wave Washing Sand!

“World Suppression!”

Scarletplume opened his gaping maws and actually unleashed Ye Yuan’s move.

Terrifying energy undulations came from the void.

Boom!

Ye Yuan spurted a mouthful of blood with a cough, his figure shooting out backward.

“Ye Yuan, you’re really a treasure vault! I didn’t expect that spatial rule could actually be applied like this! You are really too amazing!”Scarletplume said excitedly.

The comprehension of spatial rule and its application were seriously too difficult.

His harvest today was even more than what he reaped in his previous thousands of fights.

In his eyes, Ye Yuan was completely a treasure boy that could let him continuously excavate and continuously improve.

Ye Yuan wiped the fresh blood from the corners of his mouth, and he said with a grin, “It’s fine. There’s still a lot more. Slowly learn!”

“Successive Magnificence!”

“Illuminating Day!”

“Unparalleled!”

“Tian Dun!”

“Echo!”

“Jade Cicada!”

Ye Yuan shouted one after another loudly, and a series of terrifying undulations came from the void.

Each move was stronger than the last!

The Scarletplume who originally held the absolute advantage was actually suppressed by Ye Yuan.

These eight moves were all imparted by Mi Tian.

Being grouped together, it was named Spatial Eight Styles!

Of course, with Ye Yuan’s bit of cultivation realm, he could not unleash the full potential power of Spatial Eight Styles at all.

But one-shotting those in the same rank was a definite thing.

Spatial Eight Styles was painstakingly created by Mi Tian. It was where his lifelong insights into spatial origin lay.

These eight styles that Ye Yuan used were, at the very best, simplified versions.

But the power was already sufficiently strong.

The moment Ye Yuan erupted, the Dragon City Tribe was shocked.

They all thought that Ye Yuan was already an arrow at the end of its flight. Who could have thought that he actually still had so many contingency moves?

“This kid is also too strong!”

“Just based on these eight moves, his comprehension in spatial rule is more than a level stronger than Lord Scarletplume!”

“To be able to suppress Lord Scarletplume with middle Emperor Cloud Heaven cultivation, this kid is remarkable enough too. It’s just a shame that …?heh heh.”

“It’s just a pity that his moves will become Lord Scarletplume’s moves very soon!”

… …

Although they were surprised by Ye Yuan’s suppression, they were not worried.

They were perfectly clear about Scarletplume’s might.

Improving in the midst of battle, learning in fights, without end!

The stronger the opponent, the more miserably they would often lose!

No matter how strong Ye Yuan was, his cultivation realm was too low after all.

When Scarletplume became even more powerful, he would naturally reverse-suppress Ye Yuan.

Scarletplume, who had always been calm to the extreme, actually became agitated too.

In the battle, he laughed loudly and said, “Impressive! Truly impressive! My comprehension of spatial rule is seriously too shallow! Thank you, Ye Yuan, for opening up a whole world for me!”

Scarletplume, who was being suppressed, did not feel any frustration at all. He became more and more excited instead.

Ye Yuan was unmoved and did not fear the other party secretly learning either. One move after another, they fought until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open.

Below, the patriarch was also rather excited as he said, “This youngster really exceeded this old man’s expectations. His comprehension of spatial rule is extremely deep. He can definitely pry into origin realm in the future! What a fortune, to have him come to our Dragon City Tribe, and let Scarletplume have such a fine opponent!”

While Feng Qingxuan was secretly anxious as she cursed, “This boy is really dumb! Doesn’t he know that this will make his opponent get stronger and stronger? Exposing all of his trump cards, but can’t defeat his opponent, really stupid to the max!”

At this point, Feng Qingxuan did not think that Ye Yuan would win at all.

The opponent was too terrifying!

And the patriarch’s excitement was also that Ye Yuan, this opponent, could let Scarletplume grow greatly, being not surprised at how formidable he was.

No matter how formidable, he was also just a stepping stone of Scarletplume.

The stronger the opponent, the more limitless Scarletplume’s future accomplishments.

Regarding this point, the old patriarch was all too clear.

Boom!

Boom!

The fight became more and more intense, but Scarletplume’s growth was visible to the naked eye.

Everyone saw that he was currently digesting Ye Yuan’s spatial rule rapidly.

However, this process was much slower than they imagined.

Spatial Eight Styles was too difficult and complicated!

“Successive Magnificence!”

“Illuminating Day!”

“Unparalleled!”

“Tian Dun!”

… …

“Ye Yuan, you’re no longer my match anymore! After I completely digest these eight styles, it will be enough to rank in the top five of the Mountain Challenger List’s rankings!” Scarletplume said excitedly.

His understanding of Spatial Eight Styles was still only on the surface.

The reason why it was powerful was because of the support of his cultivation realm and spatial rule.

With his horizons, no matter what moves he executed, the power would not be weak.

If all the techniques of the Spatial Eight Styles were so easy to learn, it would have been impossible to become Mi Tian’s trump card too.

But he could slowly digest these spatial rule comprehensions, turning it into his own eventually.

This was also the reason why his improvement was so great.

Ye Yuan still ignored Scarletplume and just made one move after another.

“Jade Cicada!”

Boom!

Ye Yuan was directly slammed flying out, getting injured again!

Scarletplume looked at Ye Yuan and said with a loud laugh, “Alright. All your spatial rule comprehensions, I’ve already learned them! This battle ends here! You didn’t kill An Shan and didn’t kill Da Yi. I’ll spare your life too. Concede defeat!”

Ye Yuan stood up with some difficulty. Looking at Scarletplume, he suddenly smiled.

That smile made Scarletplume feel somewhat uncomfortable.

Ye Yuan’s face did not have any depression from failure.

“Scarletplume, you really surprised me a lot! You are a very powerful opponent! But you’re not the only one who improves in battle! HAH!”

Ye Yuan roared, and the dragon race pressure on his body suddenly erupted.

Earth kun grade bloodline crushed many people until they could not breathe.

But his aura did not stop here.

Boom!

The bloodline pressure did not stagnate in the least bit, directly breaking through earth kun grade, reaching heaven qian grade!

Heaven qian grade bloodline!

At this moment, everyone was shocked.

“This guy actually broke through to heaven qian grade bloodline in the middle of a fight?”

“It’s too fake, right? When did bloodline become so easy to upgrade?”

“Earth kun grade to heaven qian grade, this is hell-difficulty, how did he do it?”

… …

To the true spirit race, the hardest to advance was not cultivation realm, but it was bloodline!

The higher up, the more difficult!

Especially reaching earth kun grade, even a tiny improvement was as hard as ascending to heaven.

As for earth kun grade to heaven qian grade this threshold, virtually no one could cross it.

The dragon race’s heaven qian grade bloodlines were mostly innate.

Those who promoted post-natal were extremely, extremely few.

But now, Ye Yuan broke through in front of everyone!

As dragon race descendants, how could they not be shocked?

Scarletplume had a look of surprise too. However, he still shook his head and said, “Heaven qian grade bloodline? I admit it. You are indeed very strong! But, thanks to you, my current strength has already improved significantly. Heaven qian grade bloodline isn’t enough yet!”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Is that so? Then, you try receiving a move from me!”

Scarletplume could not help laughing and said, “You should be clear that these eight moves are no longer useful against me! Even if you broke through to heaven qian grade bloodline, it’s the same too.”

Ye Yuan did not speak, a hint of a dangerous smile flashing across the corners of his mouth.

In a blink of an eye, the overwhelming aura on his body suddenly changed.

“I just created this move! Try receiving it! The first form of space, Wave Washing Sand!”
