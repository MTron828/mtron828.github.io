Chapter 2386: Spar

The Alchemy Hall was a very important hall of Deicide.

This hall shouldered the responsibility of all of Deicide’s medicinal pill refinement.

And the one who directly controlled this hall was precisely Witchcloud.

Witchcloud was the strongest alchemist in Deicide. His alchemy strength virtually reached the level of rule.

But today, the atmosphere in the Alchemy Hall was rather odd.

Many powerful alchemists were swarming around Witchcloud. Each and every one of them was extremely indignant.

“Your Excellency, that brat is clearly bullying you! The first day that he took office, he’s coming to the hall that you’re in charge of. Isn’t this an opening gambit?”

“I really don’t know what’s with Lord Profound Secrets, making a brat like this be the chief instructor, and even climb onto the top of Your Excellency’s head.”

“Your Excellency, you wait. We’ll definitely take him down a notch today! Just based on the likes of him, a measly little Heavenly Emperor Realm kid, he also wants to meddle in the Alchemy Hall?”

... ...

It turned out that after Ye Yuan took office, the first hall that he went to was the Alchemy Hall.

And the one in charge of this hall also happened to be Witchcloud.

In everyone’s view, this naturally became Ye Yuan provoke Witchcloud. This was deliberately suppressing him.

At this time, there were already many people waiting to watch a good show.

They all knew about Ye Yuan’s combat power.

But they had never heard before that Ye Yuan also knew alchemy.

Even if they had heard it before, they would not take it seriously either.

A Heavenly Emperor Realm brat coming to provoke the Alchemy Hall. This was looking for a rebuff.

To talk about this Alchemy Hall’s powerhouses, there was a very large portion who were groomed by Witchcloud.

Deicide’s Alchemy Hall could be said to be the strongest of the entire Heavenspan World’s myriad races, not one of them!

These people were all loyal to him.

Hence, Ye Yuan wanting to come now, each and every one of them was bound by a common hatred for the enemy, mustering everything up to teach Ye Yuan a lesson.

Witchcloud’s brows furrowed and he said, “You all don’t mess around! This chief instructor was decided by Brother Profound Secrets overriding all objections, this boy must have exceptional aspects! After he comes, take a look at what capabilities he has first before talking. Of course, if he’s just holding a position without qualifications, I’ll never allow him to meddle in the Alchemy Hall!”

After everyone heard, they could only nod their heads.

But their expressions were all indifferent.

Entering the Alchemy Hall, Ye Yuan sensed this weird atmosphere.

It seemed like everyone’s gazes that looked at him were extremely hostile.

But he did not care. Along the way, he had seen too many of such gazes.

He naturally did not come to the Alchemy Hall to make drastic changes to an organization upon taking charge, and it was also not in order to teach anyone a lesson.

In his understanding, the divine race was extremely apprehensive of the human race’s alchemy path.

This was also to say that, the previous epoch’s human race’s alchemy path was unprecedentedly developed!

With so many top masters in the last epoch, the alchemy path must have contributed tremendous power.

The Alchemy Hall, it could be said to be the factory for creating experts!

Hence, Ye Yuan chose the Alchemy Hall as his first stop.

Slowly walking in front of Witchcloud, Ye Yuan nodded slightly and went straight to the point: “Senior Witchcloud, I came today to witness the Alchemy Hall’s strength.”

Witchcloud’s heart naturally would not be as calm as he was showing.

No matter how he hinted at it implicitly, saying that Profound Secrets’ foresight definitely would not be wrong.

He was not a jealous person, otherwise, he would also not have been so trusted by Profound Secrets.

But, having a Heavenly Emperor Realm brat ride on top of his head, he felt somewhat strange no matter what.

“Everyone’s here. How does Young Friend Ji plan to witness it?” Witchcloud said indifferently.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s naturally pill refinement!”

Before Witchcloud spoke, an elder sneered and said, “Refining pills? Lord Chief Instructor, do you know how to refine pills?”

“Yeah! Want to find fault, it’s also not the turn of you, this little babe, to come and point fingers! Want to check our strength, shouldn’t you yourself show a bit of strength first?”

“If you don’t have the strength, scram as soon as possible! Lord Witchcloud manages the Alchemy Hall in good order, this place doesn’t need Lord Chief Instructor to worry about.”

The moment Ye Yuan opened his mouth, it immediately incurred ridicule.

In their view, Ye Yuan might know alchemy, but it was definitely so-so.

A dabbler wanted to show off in the presence of them, these masters?

No way!

Witchcloud wanted to open his mouth to stop everyone, but when the words reached the tip of his tongue, he swallowed them back.

These old things naturally would not be so lacking in shrewdness.

They did it on purpose, attempting to provoke Ye Yuan.

The chief instructor completely fell out with the Alchemy Hall as soon as he came, see if he still had to face to come or not.

However, Ye Yuan’s reaction was somewhat beyond their expectations.

It was only to see him smile faintly. He said, “Refining pills huh? I still have a little understanding. Since everyone wants to witness my strength, then I’ll accept deferentially rather than to decline courteously.”

The eyes of the bunch of old fogeys lit up. This kid was here to look for abuse!

An elder immediately stepped forward and said, “I’ll compete in alchemy with you! If you were to lose, you’re not allowed to come to the Alchemy Hall in the future!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said smilingly, “This senior, I have no plans on competing with you.”

The moment that elder heard, he smiled coldly and said, “What, not competing with me, do you still want to find a Seven-star disciple to compete with? It’s also not out of the question!”

The moment these words came out, it immediately incurred a wave of hooting laughter.

In their view, Ye Yuan could only compete in alchemy with the Seven-star and Eight-star disciples.

It was completely not on the same level as them.

But Ye Yuan just smiled and looked at Witchcloud and said, “Senior Witchcloud, I heard Senior Profound Secrets say that you’re Deicide’s alchemy path number one person, your alchemy strength astonishingly strong! Why don’t you and I spar, let everyone broaden their horizons as well?”

Everyone’s smiles immediately turned stiff on their faces.

Even Witchcloud himself also had a stunned look.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually going to challenge him!

Although he said it tactfully, this was undoubtedly a challenge!

“Did I hear wrongly? He ... He’s going to challenge Lord Witchcloud?”

“This kid wouldn’t have lost his mind, right?”

“I still thought that Lord Profound Secrets found some remarkable fellow, messing around for so long. It turns out that he’s a fool!”

After being stupefied, there was even more unbridled taunting.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s behavior and overestimated his own ability, they all turned their noses up in disdain, being filled with contempt.

After Witchcloud was stunned for a moment, he also smiled brightly and said, “Alright! This old man also wants to witness Chief Instructor’s strength!”

Hence, amidst the waves of ridiculing, Ye Yuan and Witchcloud started the alchemy battle.

Looking at the spirit medicines prepared in front of him, Ye Yuan had an envious look on his face.

The grades of these spirit medicines were not high, but they had already gone completely extinct in the later generations. Ye Yuan had never heard of them before.

The human race’s alchemy path failing to be revitalized, it likely had a lot to do with this as well.

“Young Friend Ji, you can start then!” Witchcloud said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head, snapping his fingers, the Tai Chi diagram suddenly bloomed.

A mysterious Alchemy Dao source power suddenly descended!

After the battle with Medicine Ancestor, Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao source already broke through to rank three!

Furthermore, he glimpsed the power of rule in that battle.

He already integrated a tiny trace of the power of rule in his Alchemy Dao!

The moment he made his move, all of them, their expressions changed!
