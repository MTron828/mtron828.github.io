Chapter 2781: Pointing at the Firmament With the Sword, Seeking Dao With the Sword!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You guys, Ye Yuan has been very calm all along. Could he really have some backup plan?” After Ye Yuan’s party left, Saint Exalt Bull Demon could not resist asking.

It was truly that Ye Yuan behaved too calmly.

Anyone who suffered this kind of treatment would be indignant, but Ye Yuan was not.

From start to end, he was like an onlooker observing from the sidelines.

Many powerhouses present were extremely apprehensive of Ye Yuan.

Got to admit, Ye Yuan’s attitude made them somewhat nervous in their hearts.

Waycloud smiled coldly and said, “Don’t you forget, it’s Heavenly Dao that cut off his path forward, and not us! Someone abandoned by Heaven, do you all feel that he has a chance to turn things around?”

The moment everyone heard, they immediately calmed down a lot.

Yeah, Heaven wanted you dead. Could you still overturn the heavens?

“You’re right! No matter how breathtaking the genius, they aren’t greater than the heavens too! From now on, there’s only the Four Great Heavenly Regions!” Saint Exalt Skyfortune said.

… …

It was silent all the way. After returning to the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, Luo Yunqing finally could not hold back anymore.

“Ye Yuan, you can leave if you want to! I’m going to fight it out to the death with them here! Even if my bones are ground to dust, I won’t let them take a step into Martial Secure Heavenly Sect too!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You, a newly ascended Saint Sovereign Heaven, even if your bones are ground to dust, can it stop them from stepping into the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect?? This place is merely a wasteland. So what if we give it to them?”

During the great battle, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was the primary battlefield.

So many Saint Sovereign Heavens fighting, plus the Eight Legions War Generals’ self-detonation, the entire sect was long already a wasteland.

But Luo Yunqing had extremely deep feelings for the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

Now, having just destroyed the Pill Alliance and being able to rebuild the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, but suddenly getting chased away to the Land of Heavenly South, he could not accept it.

The Land of Heavenly South was merely a tiny place, that was all.

In terms of area, it was only one-quarter of a heavenly region.

How could Luo Yunqing be willing?

“Ye Yuan, your Martial Dao is severed. Could it be that even your hotbloodedness was erased too? If we were to really join forces, we might not lose to them!”

Ye Yuan looked at Luo Yunqing deeply and said, “Brother Luo, so what if we revive the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect? Even if the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect rules Rainclear Continent like the Pill Alliance, so what? This place is merely a desolate land. That’s all! Could it be that your horizons are really only limited to these?”

“The five great heavenly sects’ people have always been curious. Why Zhuo Bufan that kind of heaven’s chosen would suddenly go missing. Today, let me tell you. He went to the other side of the sea! He knew that if he stayed in Rainclear Continent, he would only be sitting in the well and looking at the sky. That’s all! Don’t you want to take a look at the world outside?”

Luo Yunqing’s expression changed drastically, and he said in surprise, “How do you know …”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I saw the sword energy that he left behind in the sea!”

Luo Yunqing’s heart shook wildly. It turned out that Lord Zhuo really crossed the sea!

“But … But the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect …”

Ye Yuan cut him off and said coolly, “Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s Dao teachings naturally have to be passed down! This is giving an account to Sect Master and also giving an account to Elder He! However, it isn’t now! There’s no meaning in showing off momentary bravery!”

Luo Yunqing looked at Ye Yuan in astonishment and said in surprise, “You … This is impossible! Your road of martial arts has already been cut off by Heavenly Dao!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “My fate is up to me, not up to Heaven!”

… …

On this day, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s entire sect moved south.

Saying that it was the entire sect, there were actually not many people.

However, in the wake of Ye Yuan killing Changsheng with one sword, many of Martial Secure’s old subordinates returned too.

Wu Chengchao, Lin Lan, Wen Jingxuan, these people, all escaped death by a fluke because of Ye Yuan’s Hundred Poison Formation back then.

Now, hearing that Ye Yuan returned, they naturally returned to the sect.

Apart from them, there were also over 300 people that returned to Martial Secure Heavenly Sect too.

As for the other four sects, they were not so lucky.

They had less than 200 people when added up.

These 500 over people were the last force of the former Five Light Heavenly Region.

However, because the other regions rejected ascenders, there were several thousand ascenders that followed the five great heavenly sects and migrated to the Land of Heavenly South.

After this, Big Yellow also completely broke away from the Myriad Demons Mountain and joined the faction of Heavenly South.

The present Land of Heavenly South had Luo Yunqing three people plus Heavenly South’s four great Saint Exalts, plus two ascender Saint Exalts, as well as Ye Yuan and Big Yellow. There were 11 great Saint Exalt Heavens!

In terms of numbers, they were really not weak.

It was just that most of these people had just broken through. Their foundation was too weak.

There was actually only Big Yellow alone who deserved to be called a combat power.

In reality, what those Five Great Heavenly Regions powerhouses were truly afraid of was also just Big Yellow.

Otherwise, if the five great heavenly regions wanted to migrate, they probably really could not have done it.

However, everything was not important anymore.

Arriving at the Land of Heavenly South, Ye Yuan arrived above the sea and sat down suspended in the air.

An enormous Tai Chi diagram slowly unfurled above Ye Yuan’s head.

That appearance seemed to be comprehending heaven and earth.

“Kid, have you really thought it through? Taking this step is certain death!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Road is forged by people, and it is not bestowed by the heaven! In this life, starting from the Immortal Grove World, I’ve been going against the heaven! Great Dao crumbling, I’ll go contrary to Dao with alchemy, and reach Divine Dao! When the Heavenspan World was refined by someone with a great divine ability, I created my own cultivation method and transformed Dao to shatter the sky! In this 33 Heavens, since Heavenly Dao doesn’t tolerate me, then I’ll point at the firmament with my sword and seek Dao with the sword!”

Boom!

As he said, Ye Yuan’s chaos world exploded with a loud bang!

A terrifying energy undulation set off a series of tsunamis.

At this moment, countless gazes looked towards the sea.

Luo Yunqing’s expression changed wildly, and he cried out in surprise, “What a strong world power! Ye Yuan, he shattered his own small world. He … What does he want to do?”

Small world! It was where the foundation of martial artists lay! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

If the world collapsed, Martial Dao would be destroyed!

Ye Yuan actually shattered his own small world!

This action shocked everyone.

Big Yellow had an extremely deep comprehension in Great Dao, but he detected a trace of an unusual crisis.

“Master Ye … wants to reestablish after destruction! But … does Heavenly Dao allow it?” Big Yellow murmured.

Ye Yuan spent countless efforts to condense and form this chaos world.

To say that he was reluctant, he was naturally extremely reluctant!

But at this moment, he proceeded without hesitation!

There were geniuses in the world that were not tolerated by Heavenly Dao!

It was not just Ye Yuan alone who had their path of cultivation stripped away by Heavenly Dao.

The 33 Heavens were extremely vast. There were countless powerhouses and geniuses, being plentiful like clouds!

There were also peerless heaven’s chosens who were not tolerated by Heavenly Dao.

These heaven’s chosens were naturally unwilling to have their Martial Dao cut off henceforth.

Hence, they forged a path: a road that went against heaven!

Snatching fate from heaven, going against heaven!

Ye Yuan’s chaos world collapsed, but it was not obliterated. Instead, it gathered toward the Tai Chi diagram.

The Tai Chi slowly rotated. Countless energies were condensed in it.

An illusory sword gradually solidified, standing upside down in the center of the Tai Chi diagram, pointing at the firmament with the sword!

Crack! Crack!

Dark clouds gathered in the sky above the sea, lightning flashing.

It was as if the world was going to be destroyed in the next second!
