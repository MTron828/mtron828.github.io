Chapter 2109: Textbook Example

On a watchtower with an extremely good line of sight, the Qilin Clan’s powerhouses were all present.

Qi Chen looked in the distance and slowly opened his mouth and said, “Qi Zhen, you have to watch this alchemy battle well. Although I don’t think that he can beat you, the implications of this matter are too great, so you mustn’t be careless.”

Beside Qi Chen, a young man with a cold face stood with his hands behind his back. He was precisely Qi Zhen.

Qi Zhen was the Qilin Clan’s young generation’s number one alchemy genius, his strength formidable.

Although he was of the young generation, Qi Zhen was actually more than 30 thousand years old already.

“To talk about emperor bones, our Qilin Clan also has quite a few left behind by ancestors. Could it be that this emperor bone is different in some way?” Qi Zhen asked curiously.

Qi Chen nodded and said, “I sensed an extremely ancient aura from this emperor bone. Compared to the emperor bones in the clan, it seems to be more nobler and more mysterious! I feel that this emperor bone must be hiding our clan’s big secret inside it. Hence, we must get it!”

Qi Zhen was slightly surprised, clearly not expecting that Qi Chen would actually be so serious.

“Uncle Chen, rest assured. I won’t lose!” Qi Zhen said coolly, revealing powerful confidence.

... ...

This fight was anticipated by all.

On that day, when everyone knew that Second Sage was actually a True God Realm, the entire city was shaken.

There were criticizing voices everywhere in the city. There were questioning voices everywhere.

And today, whether Second Sage was worthy of the title or failed to live up to the name, it was also time to examine it.

High Priest Redplume’s proud disciple, an Ancestor Realm powerhouse, this was clearly the most ideal testing stone to test Second Sage’s strength. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Lord Second Sage, you watch carefully. This is my Redplume lineage’s Nero Heavenwalk Technique! I’ll use it today to tell you that you’re not worthy to be called Second Sage!”

Crimsonsky gave a cold cry, a profound aura suddenly erupted. It was as if there was only him alone left in this entire world.

Waves of profound and inscrutable aura transmitted out of the medicinal cauldron, revolving around Crimsonsky.

This was the aura of Dao!

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help letting out waves of exclamations.

The Demon Divine Region was vast, the powerhouses numerous. But Ancestor Realm powerhouses were extremely hard to encounter.

One had to know, even a major power like Xin Luo was also merely a half-step Ancestor Realm.

“This is Ancestor Realm? Indeed a celestial figure! Lord Crimsonsky is well-deserving of being High Priest Redplume’s proud disciple!”

“This is the aura of Dao! Lord Crimsonsky completely drew out all of the power of law inside the spirit medicines!”

“Too impressive! This is genuine pill refinement! Compared to Lord Crimsonsky, we’re simply trash!”

“Whatever dogfart Second Sage, he’s weak to the max when compared to Lord Crimsonsky!”

... ...

In the plaza, fanatical voices could be heard all around. Many people were instantly turned into fans by Crimsonsky.

When had these people seen before Ancestor Realm powerhouses take action? The moment Crimsonsky made his move, they naturally felt incomparably surprised.

On the watchtower, Xin Luo also had a look of surprise as he said with a sigh, “This is Ancestor Realm? Lord Crimsonsky has probably already acquired High Priest Redplume’s true legacy. Given time, he might be able to clear Ask Not as well. This battle doesn’t have any suspense!”

He, this half-step Ancestor Realm, longed for Ancestor Realm immensely.

It was just that this step was far too difficult!

Back then, Empyrean Flutterfeather was a half-step Ancestor Realm long ago but kept failing to take the final step and truly step into Ancestor Realm, all the way until he encountered Ye Yuan.

The so-called Ancestor Realm was actually tracing to the source, and one could already pry into the source of Great Dao, getting to work from the most fundamental, refining medicinal pills.

Hence, the moment Crimsonsky made his move, he drew out all of the power of law inside the spirit medicines, discarded the dregs, and re-tempered them, forming better quality medicinal pills from there!

Gongyang Lie also stroked his beard and laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Huhu, although Crimsonsky is arrogant at heart and haughty in manner, his talent is indeed extremely high. Even Master is also full of praises toward him! After today, see how Ye Yuan this brat still has the cheek to be called Second Sage!”

Ye Yuan himself appeared very calm. He was not in a rush to take action but observed Crimsonsky’s pill refinement for a while, and unwittingly shook his head slightly.

“Huhu, pill refinement isn’t competing in quarreling, whoever’s voice is louder wins. Today, this sage will teach you a good lesson, and let you know how medicinal pills should be refined.”

It was only to see Ye Yuan put his hands together. The sky suddenly dimmed, motes of stars manifesting above the sky of the stage.

Chaos Heavenly Star Art!

Demonic attraction art activating, Ye Yuan’s entire person transformed into a mirage.

The power of laws inside the spirit medicines transformed into fine flowing streams, flowing into the stars.

This scene was unbelievably beautiful!

Those who were still shouting ‘Lord Crimsonsky is incredible’ previously, already shut their mouths sensibly at this time.

They were already thoroughly dumbstruck with amazement by Ye Yuan’s pill refinement!

When Xin Luo saw this scene, he could not help staring dumbfounded with his mouth agape, unable to say a word.

Originally, Crimsonsky had an imposing momentum, attempting to directly crush Ye Yuan until he could not lift his head.

But very soon, he felt an unparalleled power burst forth, forcefully knocking aside his Alchemy Dao aura, not allowing the least bit of resistance.

In front of this power, he suddenly felt that he was extremely puny.

Crimsonsky’s heart shook wildly, he had yet to encounter such a situation before.

Even when battling on alchemy with his senior apprentice brothers, he also never had this kind of feeling before.

He felt that the Ye Yuan on the other side was akin to the sky, as though he was the earth, as though he was the entire world!

This power was too terrifying!

“Is ... Is this Ye Yuan’s true strength?” Xin Luo looked at Ye Yuan blankly, finally blurting out this sentence.

Gongyang Lie did not know pill refinement, but he also discerned something unusual from Xin Luo’s expression.

Furthermore, with his Heavenly Emperor strength, he also sensed the aura of the Great Dao source distinctly.

This aura, even he also felt waves of heart palpitations.

It was not that this power was too strong, but it was a kind of awe and veneration that came from the bottom of the heart.

Being born in this world, people would not really fear nothing.

Mortals revered gods, martial artists revered heaven and earth.

The current Gongyang Lie seemed to be facing heaven and earth.

“Just what is going on? Could it be that ... Crimsonsky froze?” Gongyang Lie said somewhat disbelievingly.

Xin Luo turned to look at him and said with a bitter smile, “This alchemy battle doesn’t have any suspense at all! Heavenly Melody Heartseal Pill is one of the most difficult to refine medicinal pills among rank six demon divine pills, the medicinal properties in the spirit medicines extremely complicated. How to extract the power of law heavily tests the standard of the priest. To Ancestor Realm powerhouses, drawing out the medicinal properties within isn’t hard, but ... Ye Yuan did it too perfectly!”

On the other side, Qi Chen’s expression was never-before solemn until today. He was also explaining the impressive aspect of Ye Yuan to his fellow clan members.

“The complexity of medicinal properties is just like the stars in the sky, with people being unable to handle it at all. Even Ancestor Realm powerhouses also don’t dare to say that they can master it fully. Even if Sacred Ancestor High Priest or Ancestor Si Chen is here, it’s probably also just Ye Yuan’s standard! If we are to say that Crimsonsky’s strength already attained a higher level, then Ye Yuan’s skill can be said to be ... textbook example!”

Behind Qi Zhen, the faces of Qi Chen and the rest became more and more surprised, and increasingly solemn.

Qi Zhen’s appraisal of Ye Yuan was too high!
