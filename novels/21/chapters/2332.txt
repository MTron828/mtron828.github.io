Chapter 2336: Giving Away Heads

“Looking at your appearance, you should have just come back from the dead, right? How many times have you died? Uh, sorry about that. It should be how many dozen times?”

Ye Yuan swept a glance over the few people’s faces, his tone full of mockery.

These few people’s strengths were not very strong. The strongest was also merely Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor, but he was mocking him here, it was really ridiculous.

Sure enough, the moment the few people heard, their faces immediately changed.

Several dozen times was a bit exaggerated. But they had indeed died more than ten times already.

But in such an environment, the mortality rate of weaklings was extremely high.

The eyes of one of them, a youth in brocade, turned cold and he said, “Brat, newcomers got to have the awareness of newcomers! Being too arrogant, you’ll die very miserably!”

The youth in brocade was called Yang Ke, the leader of this group of people, a peak Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

Their group had just encountered the ambush of an expert outside the city. In the end, their group was annihilated.

At this time, this group of people was currently upset. When they saw Ye Yuan, they could not help mocking him a little.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “The moment I entered, you guys have been ridiculing me non-stop. Now, you’re saying that I’m arrogant. Why has the side of reason been occupied by you?”

Yang Ke said in a cold voice, “In the Primeval War Realm, the words of the strong are the side of reason! Brat, if you dare to say this sort of words outside the city, you’d already be a dead man!”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Oh, is that so? Then I’ll go out of the city right now. Do you guys dare to come?”

Yang Ke was stunned, could this guy be a fool?

They were apprehensive and did not dare to make a move inside the city. But leaving the city, they would be able to strike a fatal blow.

This kind of thing was very commonly seen outside the city.

Outside the city, not only did one have to be on guard against fierce beasts that might appear at any time, they even had to take precautions against humans who pop out from God knows where.

Except, Ye Yuan was a newcomer. There was no god of war points on him at all. Killing would be in vain too.

According to the Primeval War Realm’s rules, by killing the opponent, one would be able to obtain 10% to 70% of the god of war points on them.

The higher the opponent’s ranking, the more god of war points obtained, and the fewer conversely.

In the beginning, some powerful people would intentionally wait for other people’s ranking to get high before hunting them down.

But over time, the rankings would also become more and more stable.

Challenging people who ranked higher than them was equivalent to giving away their heads.

“Hahaha, are you challenging this emperor? Seen before those who seek death, but never seen before someone like you who’s in such a hurry to court death! Just entered and you want to experience the taste of death? Rest assured, it’s exactly the same as in reality!” Yang Ke said with a loud laugh.

Even though Ye Yuan did not have god of war points on him, Ye Yuan was so arrogant. How could he yield?

Moreover, they had just been group annihilated, finding a rookie to vent was also pretty good.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’m eyeing your god of war points. Although it’s a bit less, it’s better than nothing.”

The moment the few people heard, they could not help bursting into laughter.

When Yang Ke heard that, he laughed even harder and said, “You, this newcomer, are really interesting! Good, very good! Then let’s go outside the city and cross swords, your Grandpa Yang’s god of war points are here. Take it if you have the ability!”

Ye Yuan was not long-winded either, directly turning around and heading in the direction out of the city.

In the city, many martial artists saw that there was a show to watch and could not hold back their curiosity, and also followed after.

“This newcomer is really interesting. A Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor is actually so arrogant!”

A martial artist said with vicissitudes of emotion, “Heh, those able to enter the Primeval War Realm, which one isn’t an astonishing talent outside? But after arriving here, only then will one know that there’s a heaven beyond heaven, and that there’s always someone better!”

“This kid can probably jump ranks and battle outside. But he likely doesn’t know that everyone here can jump ranks and battle! However, there’s no use at all!”

... ...

Regarding Ye Yuan’s action, the group of unpredictable children was very disdainful.

When they just entered, which one did not have their noses pointed at the sky?

But along with the passing of time, their confidence was beaten down little by little.

Until now, they already learned to tuck their tails between their legs and behave.

Accidentally offending an expert, that expert would chase after you, killing you all the way until you did not dare to go out of the city!

But it was also not absolutely safe in the city.

Because there was a time limit in the city.

Once the time was up, the Primeval War Realm’s rules would directly obliterate you!

Yang Ke’s squad had a total of six people, two Third Firmament Heavenly Emperors, and four Second Firmament Heavenly Emperors.

But even if they were Second Firmament Heavenly Emperors, they were peak existences too. They were only a step away from being a Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

Arriving outside the city, they looked at Ye Yuan like a big bad wolf saw a little white rabbit, having playful expressions on their faces.

This kid actually really came outside the city.

“Peng Yang, go and teach this little brother of ours on how to behave in Cloudaid City!” Yang Ke said to his companion.

The companion called Peng Yang had a playful look on his face as he said smilingly, “Okay, teaching newcomers this sort of thing, I’m most happy to do it! Brat, you must think that you’re very amazing, can jump ranks and challenge opponents! But, each one of us can jump ranks and battle outside! Therefore, after you die, remember to tuck your tail and ...”

Boom!

Peng Yang’s words had yet to fade and he was already dead. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan suddenly exploded with a punch, his speed unimaginably quick.

Everyone did not react yet and Peng Yang already returned to the place of rebirth once more.

Ye Yuan had a calm and collected look. It was as if he did something very ordinary.

While at this time, one gilded inscription text after another entered his body.

This was god of war points.

Casually killing Peng Yang, Ye Yuan obtained 32 god of war points.

“Just this bit of god of war points. You guys are so weak!” Ye Yuan said with some dissatisfaction.

Peng Yang’s ranking was not high, but compared to Ye Yuan, it was very high.

He obtained 30% of Peng Yang’s god of war points, which was also to say that Peng Yang’s god of war points was just in the low 100s.

Ye Yuan was just speaking his mind, but this was a great insult to Yang Ke and the rest.

God of war points being low indicated that their strength was weak!

Actually, their god of war points was not considered low either, especially Yang Ke, he could rank close to 10,000.

But they had just experienced a group annihilation and lost a lot of god of war points at once. Hence, that was why it appeared little.

Yang Ke’s gaze was gloomy and he seethed with killing intent as he said, “Brat, you actually didn’t follow the rules and sneak attacked Peng Yang!”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “A fight means a fight. What’s with so much crap? Moreover, isn’t this Primeval War Realm a land of slaughter? Could it be that when killing people , we still have to bow to each other first and say hello?”

“Hahaha ...”

A wave of guffaws came from all around.

Indeed, what Ye Yuan said made a lot of sense.

They also saw that Ye Yuan’s realm was too low, so they underestimated him.

Otherwise, why would they be long-winded with him? Most likely, the moment they went out of the city, the six of them would have attacked together and besieged Ye Yuan.

Yang Ke’s gaze was cold, and he said in a low voice, “Attack together, kill him!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Yang Ke’s patience already reached its limit.

He wanted to wreck this guy to death, and let him know the taste of being so overwhelmed with pain to the point where he wished that he was dead!

In the Primeval War Realm, being dead was not scary. What was scary was the process of death.

That process was the exact same as the real body!

Except, the reality was quite different from what he imagined.

The moment they came to blows, he discovered how strong Ye Yuan’s strength was!
