1799 Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye

“Is there a mistake? My eyesight isn’t failing, right? A Sixth Firmament Divine Lord smacked a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord flying with one slap?”

Even though there were only a few disciples in the hall, this scene still made them extremely shocked.

That disciple held his face, his teeth already knocked out. Looking at Ye Yuan, his eyes were full of fear.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with an indifferent look, “Those people got you to do things, didn’t they tell you not to provoke me? You’re the disciple assigning abodes and have the authority to assign where disciples go. I originally didn’t plan on refusing either, yet, you were looking for a beating yourself. Then I can’t be blamed.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan took the array flag, turned around, and was about to leave.

“Wait a minute! Ye Yuan, I’ll go together with you!” Ceng You suddenly said.

He turned to that disciple and said, “That whatever dog-fart abode, I don’t want it anymore! You give me an array flag! I’ll go to Firecloud Peak too!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and said, “They are making me go to Firecloud Peak because that place is definitely very dangerous. You have no need to take the risk with me.”

But Ceng You had a calm look and said smilingly, “My strength is inferior to yours, but it’s more or less an assistance! Moreover, opening up an abode, I’ll just take it as a trial!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he understood in his heart.

Ceng You was a smart man too. He gave a pointer or two and he already found his original heart.

Cultivating was sailing against the current to begin with. If this Ceng You thought that he soared to the heavens in one bound after entering the Shadowmoon Sect, that would be wasting his talents.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Let’s go together then.”

Looking at the two people’s departing back view, that disciple had a venomous look on his face.

“Heh, the Firecloud Peak is a desolate land with countless rank four fierce beasts. There are even quite a few rank five existence. There are already no fewer than several dozen people among the disciples who wanted to open up an abode. I don’t believe that you guys can still return!”

...

On Firecloud Peak, it was indeed desolate and bleak, with traces of fierce beasts everywhere.

The powerful undulations coming from the surroundings made Ceng You’s complexion somewhat pale.

“Ye Yuan, this Firecloud Peak is truly riddled with perils. Those guys really want your life!”

Ceng You immediately understood those people’s intentions after arriving at Firecloud Peak.

He vaguely knew that Ye Yuan had conflicts with the three major factions, but he did not expect that those people were actually so vicious.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “As long as the ordeals that others give me can’t kill me, it will all make me stronger. This will become a nightmare for them.”

Ceng You’s expression turned austere. He discovered that he was too far apart from Ye Yuan in terms of heart realm.

Under Ye Yuan’s influence, Ceng You’s mind also gradually settled down.

“What should we do now?” Ceng You asked.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Familiarize ourselves with the environment first. Let’s walk toward the place with the richest spiritual energy. Since it’s an undeveloped stray peak, then we naturally have to choose the best eye of the spiritual vein.”

Ceng You nodded and said, “The spiritual energy in the south-west direction seems to be rather thick. Let’s go over and take a look?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and headed in the south-west direction together with Ceng You.

Along the way, the astonishment in Ceng You’s heart grew more and more.

The strength that Ye Yuan displayed made him dare not to look straight at him.

Those ordinary rank four fierce beasts could not take a single blow at all in front of him.

Even the late-stage rank four fierce beasts comparable to Eighth Firmament Divine Lords were also not enemies that could last one exchange with Ye Yuan.

Only those peak late-stage rank four fierce beasts could tussle with Ye Yuan for a while.

But in the end, they still could not escape the fate of being slaughtered.

After separating from Baili Qingyan, Ye Yuan tempered himself in the Shadowmoon Mountain Range. Presently, his realm already thoroughly consolidated, his strength improving further as well.

Ceng You originally thought that Ye Yuan being able to smack a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord flying with one slap more or less had some elements of luck involved.

Only now did he know that that Ninth Firmament Divine Lord was too weak!

That Ninth Firmament Divine Lord was completely too weak to stand up to competition compared to these peak late-stage rank four fierce beasts.

And these peak late-stage rank four fierce beasts were similarly finished off in one blow in front of Ye Yuan.

With one comparison, the level was immediately established.

Suddenly, a flash of inspiration appeared in Ceng You’s mind. Recalling the scene of the entrance examination, his eyes revealed deep shock.

Everyone was mocking Ye Yuan, thinking that Ye Yuan only got first place by being stained with Baili Qingyan’s light.

Looking at it now, it was simply Baili Qingyan getting stained by Ye Yuan’s light!

Ceng You naturally knew Baili Qingyan’s prowess. But he believed that no matter how formidable Baili Qingyan was, it also would not be so effortless when facing peak late-stage rank four fierce beasts.

During these past few days, he personally saw Ye Yuan slay three peak late-stage rank four fierce beasts alone.

This kind of combat power already exceeded the scope of a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord!

It turned out that Ye Yuan was the number one person in the entrance examination this time!

And this glory was shamelessly usurped by the Immortal Abode Sect and Baili Qingyan.

But, why didn’t Ye Yuan contend?

Ceng You’s mind revolved like lightning, thinking of many things in an instant.

“Eh, the spiritual energy in front seems to be somewhat different,” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Ceng You said in surprise, “Different?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The spiritual energy here should be the thickest place in the entire Firecloud Peak already. But in that area, spiritual energy is extremely thin.”

Ceng You was startled and said, “Such a great distance, you can feel it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Let’s go over and take a look. There might be an unexpected find.”

The two people gradually approached. Sure enough, Ceng You discovered that the spiritual energy seemed to have disappeared all at once, suddenly becoming much thinner.

“What’s going on here? Logically speaking, this position should be the eye of the spiritual vein. Why is the spiritual energy so thin?” Ceng You said with a frown.

He did not notice that Ye Yuan’s gaze gradually became bright.

“Heh, don’t know if it’s the Cloudsword lineage or Soaring Flower lineage, they really gave us a big gift!” Ye Yuan said in surprise.

Ceng You felt puzzled and said, “A big gift? The spiritual energy here is so thin, why would it be a big gift?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Have you heard before of Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye?”

Ceng You’s entire body trembled when he heard that and said in panic, “You ... You’re talking about the Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye whose spiritual energy thickness is even above level nine!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s right!”

In a spiritual vein, there were numerous spiritual vein eyes.

They were divided into a total of nine levels according to the concentration of spiritual energy.

But above level nine, there were still some extremely hard to come across spiritual vein terrains. Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye was one of them.

These spiritual vein eyes required an extremely complex environment before it could form. Furthermore, it was very hard to identify.

Even if ordinary saw it, they might not be able to recognize it too.

Of course, this could not stump Dustless.

“Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye has the spiritual energy’s eruption obstructed by a special terrain. In the course of time, it will produce extremely thick spiritual energy. Once opened, the spiritual energy concentration would be far above level nine. Heh heh, don’t you think we picked up a great bargain?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Encountering an Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye, he was very delighted too.

He was currently very eager to increase his strength too. Being able to encounter this kind of Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye would hasten his cultivation speed ten times over. His luck was really not the ordinary kind of good.
