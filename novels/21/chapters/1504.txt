Chapter 1508 Great Dao Heavenly Melody

For the sake of this grand meet, the Blood Battle Stage did not scruple for a lockdown for half a month.

Although the losses were great, Bloodeagle did not care at all!

Ye Yuan and Ka Xin’s battle already helped him to earn three years of profit. What did a mere half a month count for?

The Blood Battle Stage that could accommodate several tens of thousands of people. Over 5000 people sitting on it seemed somewhat empty.

This time, on the main platform, there was only Ye Yuan’s lone solitary figure.

But this figure was very strapping and powerful in the eyes of the group of Fiend Apothecaries.

That was an existence that made them admire with great admiration!

Martial artists held powerhouses in awe and veneration.

Fiend apothecaries were respectful towards powerhouses!

Respect from the bottom of their hearts!

Under everyone’s watchful gazes, Ye Yuan slowly opened his mouth.

“Alchemy Dao is all-encompassing, convoluted and disorderly, seeming to have a multitude of things. As long as you sort out one end of the thread, you’ll be able to reel silk from cocoons, reaching the other shore.”

“Alchemy Dao isn’t simple and inflexible pill refinement. If you all understand it as a dreary vocation, you’ll become mediocre.”

“Alchemy Dao is a Great Dao! The Dao of medicinal pills, the core lies in the medicine, and not the pill.”

“...”

Ye Yuan’s voice rose and fell, echoing throughout the entire Blood Battle Stage.

5000 Fiend Apothecaries were dead silent, listening like they were intoxicated.

After reaching the Alchemy God Realm, Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao became even deeper.

Talking tirelessly at this time was like chit-chatting about domestic trivialities.

But in the other Fiend Apothecaries’ ears, each word was a gem, containing the maxim of Great Dao.

The sermon this time, Ye Yuan did not sleep nor rest for 15 days, talking for 15 days in a row.

To Deity Realm powerhouses, not resting for 15 days was nothing. But this kind of sermon that contained the whereabouts of Dao was extremely energy-consuming. For ordinary people to be able to last five days was already pretty good.

Ye Yuan preaching for 15 days in one go was seldom-seen in the world.

For the sake of the sermon this time, Ye Yuan also tidied up what he had learned since becoming an Alchemy God.

At this time, he talked naturally and smoothly, without the slightest bit of sluggishness.

Ye Yuan went from shallow to deep, the things that he narrated became increasingly profound.

On the first day, everyone listened like they were filled with wisdom. Many areas of Alchemy Dao that they did not understand were enlightened all at once.

On the second day, the things that Ye Yuan talked about became much deeper. There was already a small portion of people who felt fogged up in the clouds.

On the third day, the fourth day, the fifth day ...

The things that Ye Yuan talked about became more and more profound. Even Three-star Fiend Apothecaries also gradually felt somewhat taxing.

However, not a single person left.

They knew that the things Ye Yuan talked about were extremely hard to come by. Even if they did not understand a single word, it was also an exceedingly rare experience.

Ye Yuan was using a very superficial way to display the Dao of medicinal pills to them.

Although they only had a hazy nothing, this kind of experience was one of a kind.

In the past, what was in front of them was a cloud of dense fog; unable to see the direction clearly at all.

Now, Ye Yuan helped them to push aside the dense fog, letting them go in front to look around a bit.

This kind of opportunity, not everyone had it!

But they did not realize that a mysterious aura was gradually filling the air around.

This aura developed from nothing, from weak to strong.

Gradually, they discovered that Ye Yuan’s voice became more and more distant.

Ye Yuan was clearly speaking under the grandstand, but this voice seemingly came from the horizons.

“This ... What’s going on?”

“The aura of Dao! This is the aura of Great Dao!”

“Great Dao Heavenly Melody! This must be Great Dao Heavenly Melody! Master Source Night’s sermon has already triggered the resonance of Great Dao! Right now! Every word that he says contains the Dao!”

“Didn’t think that I could actually witness this moment! Great Dao Heavenly Melody, legend says that it was only triggered once when the Medicine Ancestor preached about the Dao back then!”

“My God! Could it be that this world is actually going to have another Medicine Ancestor appear? Just what kind of level has Master Source Night’s Alchemy Dao Realm reached?”

“Stop talking freaking rubbish, pay attention to the lecture! This kind of opportunity, one might not encounter once in a lifetime! We only have to comprehend a tiny bit and it will be enough to benefit for life!”

...

The current Ye Yuan was already completely immersed in the ocean of Dao, his entire person in a state of emptiness.

Preaching Dao was giving others an advancement. How was it not a kind of advancement for oneself too?

In this half a month, Ye Yuan said his own understanding of Dao word by word. It could be said to be a summary and sublimation of his own Alchemy Dao.

Therefore, he was enlightened!

The doubt and puzzlement in during this period of time were brought together and understood thoroughly at this moment.

Dustless looked at this scene with incredible shock and murmured, “It’s really Great Dao Heavenly Melody! Legends have it that back then, the Medicine Ancestor preached on Dao to a group of Eight-star Alchemy Gods. Suddenly, Great Dao resonated. Heavenly melody played, attracting the envelopment of laws. Only then did it establish the Medicine Ancestor’s name! Could it be that Ye Yuan is already the same realm as him? But he’s just Two-star Alchemy God!”

No idea how long had passed either, everyone suddenly woke up.

Looking at the stage again, Ye Yuan’s traces were already long gone.

“Master Source Night already left!”

“Mn? I feel that ... I’m going to break through!”

“Me too! Master Source Night’s sermon made me have a feeling of being enlightened. Coupled with the Dao accumulations of the Great Dao Heavenly Melody, my realm finally loosened!”

“Master Source Night is truly a god! Perhaps he can really become the second Medicine Ancestor!”

...

Those whose alchemy realms did not improve for many years, as long as one’s talent was not too poor, it all produced a trace of insight this time.

Even if one did not break through realm, their strength also had a massive advancement.

These people left the Blood Battle Stage in haste, all finding a place to enter closed-seclusion.

Inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space, in front of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan was wrapped up by the boundless aura of Great Dao.

Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes, revealing an understanding smile.

The current Ye Yuan had already broken through his realm unknowingly, reaching grand completion Heaven Glimpse.

“I didn’t expect that unintentionally planting a willow led to the willow becoming shade. A single sermon on the Dao could actually let me break through the shackles. Not only did I create the Heart Healing Heavenly Mark Pill, it even opened the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s third level’s door!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Dustless said in surprise, “Just what realm are you right now?”

Alchemy Dao was fleeting and ephemeral. Even comparing him with other Two-star Alchemy Gods, the disparity in strength could be very great.

But this realm, no one had been able to differentiate it.

Perhaps this Two-star Alchemy God could only refine one more kind of divine pill than another Two-star Alchemy God.

But, the current Ye Yuan had clearly already surpassed knowing how to refine a few types of divine pills, this kind of category. That was why Dustless would ask this.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This ... I can’t say for sure. But I think that right now, Two-star divine pills shouldn’t pose any difficulty to me anymore?”

Dustless’ pupils constricted, somewhat surprised by Ye Yuan’s words.

He knew that Ye Yuan was not someone who talked through his hat, let alone a man of hubris.

For him to dare say so, he definitely had some reliance.

Refining Two-star divine pills would not have much difficulties. This kind of words, probably only the Medicine Ancestor, this level of existence, dared to say, right?

“A long time ago, the Medicine Ancestor was once like you, triggering Great Dao Heavenly Melody when preaching on Dao. Laws descended, him achieving the realm of half-ancestor. Could it be that you and the Medicine Ancestor are already in the same realm?” Dustless said in alarm.
