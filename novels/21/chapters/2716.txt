Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Heavenly South City Lord, Zhao Xun, pay respects to five Lord Saint Exalts!”

Seeing the five great Saint Sovereign Heavens behind Ye Yuan, tumultuous waves stirred in Zhao Xun’s heart.

Ye Yuan really did it!

These were five great Saint Sovereign Heavens. This is the cultivation realm that everyone tried their utmost to achieve even in their sleep but could not attain!

The present Heavenly South City, he was shouldering both the responsibility of city lord and hall master.

“Huhu,?Younger Brother Zhao doesn’t need to be so polite. We came this time to apologize!” Bright Tiger said with a smile.

“Yeah; 50 years ago, it was the few of us who had a few screws loose in our heads, to have done that sort of stupid thing!” Saint Exalt Heavenly Rat said.

“We brought some gifts here this time to express our apology, hope that Younger Brother Zhao will forgive,” Saint Exalt Myriad Elephant said.

The five great Saint Sovereign Heavens repeatedly calling him as their younger brother made Zhao Xun’s head spin.

Lord Saint Exalts were actually calling him as their younger brother!

Furthermore, they actually came to apologize!

What in the world happened?

In reality, Zhao Xun and the rest all thought that Ye Yuan would not be able to come back.

But now, not only did Ye Yuan come back, the five exalts’ attitudes were good until it made people feel somewhat overwhelmed.

“Ah!?Lord Saint Exalts are too courteous. Here isn’t the place to chat, please enter the city to talk.”

Zhao Xun did not dare to be neglectful, but he still showed enough courtesy.

After all, they were five saint exalts!

Being called brother by five saint exalts, Zhao Xun felt indescribably uncomfortable from head to toe.

“Master Ye, please!” But the few people did not dare to go first, letting Ye Yuan go first.

Zhao Xun’s eyeballs popped out.

“Third Hall Master is really too impressive! The five great saint exalts are actually so respectful towards him!”

“Heh,?back then when the five kings attacked Heavenly Stratum, how full of high spirits were they. Now, they broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, but became very courteous!”

“Tsk tsk,?Third Hall Master pacified the Thistle South Sea Region and subdued the Myriad Demons Mountain now! Our Heavenly South City has no worries anymore!”

… …

When the powerhouses in the city saw this scene, beyond the shock, each and every one of them had a sense of pride that arose spontaneously.

Heavenly South had always been surviving between the crevices of the north and south, two major forces, living very oppressed.

But ever since Ye Yuan’s arrival, everything changed.

Ye Yuan made a trip to Thistle South Sea Region. The Thistle South Sea Region dispatched an envoy, expressing that they would never invade Heavenly South.

Ye Yuan made a trip to the Myriad Demons Mountain, five saint exalts came in person to apologize!

This Third Hall Master was really a god-like figure!

After entering the city, there naturally could not dispense with some small talk.

While talking, the five great saint exalts were all very humble, which also made Zhao Xun and the rest sighed endlessly.

They knew that the five great saint exalts were looking at the account of Ye Yuan’s face!

Thinking about it again now, Meng Frostwind really rejected what was under his nose to seek something far away!

There was clearly an amazing figure right under his eyelids, but he used an extremely deplorable method to imprint himself in people’s impressions.

Buzz!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura suddenly descended, enveloping the entire Heavenly South City.

“Whoever’s the city lord in Heavenly South City now, this exalt is Meng Frostwind! Why haven’t you come to pay respects in haste?” An earth-shaking voice reverberated throughout the entire Heavenly South City.

It was actually Meng Frostwind who had arrived!

Within City Lord Manor, everyone had looks of surprise on their faces.

“City Lord Meng he broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!” Zhao Xun said in surprise.

No matter what, breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven was not a trivial matter.

Especially that this was the Land of Heavenly South’s first Saint Sovereign Heaven!

But Wu Jian had a disdainful look as he said,?“Humph!?This damn thing still has the face to come back! If not for him, how could my Land of Heavenly South be plunged into an abyss of suffering?”

Song Tianyang also said, “Back then, when blood flowed like rivers in Heavenly South, he behaved like a cowardly tortoise. Now that he broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, he wants to come back and be the city lord!?Heh,?what a fine plan!”

With regards to Meng Frostwind’s conduct, the present Heavenly South City was extremely disdainful.

When Bright Tiger and the others. heard Meng Frostwind report his name, they were long already burning with fury in their hearts.

“This despicable villain is finally willing to show himself!?Heh heh,?he probably didn’t expect that the five of us broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven at the same time, right? Go, go out together and take care of this guy!” Bright Tiger said in a great rage.

The few people were just about to move, but heard Ye Yuan smile and say, “No hurry. This Meng Frostwind came back to show off his prestige. How unpleasant would it be if we don’t let him enjoy himself to the fullest. Moreover, if you all go out like this, it’s very easy to scare him away!”

The moment Bright Tiger and the rest heard, they could not help secretly nodding, thinking to themselves that it was still Ye Yuan who was meticulous.

Fighting one-versus-five seemed to be overwhelming, but rushing over like this, it was very easy to scare Meng Frostwind away.

If a Saint Sovereign Heaven wanted to run, it would really not be easy to kill.

But if they suddenly pulled an unusual move and surrounded him, it would not be that easy if Meng Frostwind wanted to run.

“Heh heh,?it’s still Master Ye who’s impressive!” Saint Exalt Heavenly Rat gave a thumbs up as he said.

Ye Yuan said to Zhao Xun, “Come, let’s go meet this City Lord!”

Zhao Xun nodded slightly and followed Ye Yuan out of the door.

Stepping up into the air, Ye Yuan saw a middle-aged man in blue robes, both hands behind his back and eyes turned to the sky, an appearance as if nobody on earth could beat him.

This was still his first time seeing Meng Frostwind. The first impression that he gave Ye Yuan was that of a villain intoxicated by success.

Maybe he was not like this in the past, but now, it was indeed how he looked like.

Meng Frostwind clearly noticed the two people as well, his gaze turned sullen and he said,?“Mn??Zhao Xun, I didn’t expect that you actually broke through! Looks like Heavenly South City’s person in charge now is you? However, why haven’t you guys offered greetings when you see this exalt?”

Talking toward the back, Meng Frostwind’s two eyes glared, a powerful pressure hitting them head-on.

Zhao Xun gave a cold snort and said, “Meng Frostwind, you still have the face to come back! Do you know that 50 years ago, the entire Land of Heavenly South was almost plunged into an abyss of suffering because of you?”

Meng Frostwind did not care in the slightest and said coolly, “A mere group of ants, if they died, they died. What’s the big deal? Could it be that a bunch of ants is more important than this exalt breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven? Moreover, isn’t this Heavenly South City … perfectly fine?”

In reality, when Meng Frostwind descended upon Heavenly South City, he was quite surprised too. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Heavenly South City was actually completely intact!

Waves of powerful auras came from the city, it seemed like the losses were not too big!

Back then, myriad spirits were in a mighty contingent. He had seen before that power with his own eyes.

It actually failed to destroy Heavenly South City?

However, no matter what, it was for the best that it was not destroyed.

It was not to the extent of making him take over a broken-down stall.

“You! You’re really brazen!” Seeing that Meng Frostwind did not have the slightest remorse, Zhao Xun could not help but get angry.

Meng Frostwind said coolly, “Those five brutes are powerful. This exalt wasn’t their match back then. But now, this exalt has already broken through to Saint Sovereign Heaven. I’m the true ruler of this Land of Heavenly South! It’s also time to find them to seek revenge!?Oh,?right, who’s this boy beside you? He looks a little unfamiliar.”

Zhao Xun said in a solemn voice, “He’s called Ye Yuan! You should have heard of him before!”

Meng Frostwind’s brows furrowed slightly. Seemingly remembering something, he smiled and said, “So, it’s that alchemy genius! This exalt was in a hurry to enter the mystic realm back then and didn’t have the chance to meet you. Not bad, not bad. You’ll follow this exalt in the future!”

When Zhao Xun heard that, he could not help rolling his eyes.

How had he never discovered how cocky this guy was in the past?
