Chapter 2023: Maybe One Day

“Go, find out more!” Yun Yi said, gnashing his teeth.

The manservant answered and hurriedly withdrew.

Yun Yi’s expression was very ugly. Originally he thought that Ye Yuan was just a grandmaster who held a position without qualifications. However, who knew that a little servant girl of his could actually defeat a Southern Border’s famous alchemy genius.

More importantly, that lass was just a Five-star Alchemy God!

“Could it be that ... this Ye Yuan is really an alchemy grandmaster?” Zheng Buqun said rather hesitantly.

Yun Yi smiled coldly and said, “Have you seen before a thousand years old alchemy grandmaster? Unless he’s the Medicine Ancestor’s personal disciple, otherwise ... don’t even think about it!”

Zheng Buqun could not help choking, also feeling that he was thinking too much.

Wanting to reach the grandmaster level, at least one had to be at the middle or late-stage Dao Realm too.

The breakthrough of Alchemy Dao was far too difficult. Forget about Dao Realm, even the difficulty level of Initial Realm was tremendous.

Only at the Cloudpill Summit could one see so many middle and late-stage Initial Realms, or even peak Initial Realm powerhouses.

As for those in the Dao Realm, there were far too few!

And after reaching the Dao Realm, every scrap and iota of advancement was extremely difficult.

Just like Empyrean Flutterfeather, there was the accumulation of countless years of effort before he had his present realm.

Even so, without sky-high talent, even if giving a person tens of millions of years, the person might not be able to reach the grand completion Dao Realm no matter what.

Those coming to take part in the Cloudpill Summit this time were mostly genius alchemists at the three to five thousand age bracket. For Yun Yi to be able to reach the initial-stage Dao Realm at this age, it was already shockingly talented.

As for grandmaster, how was that possible?

“Heh heh, if he can reach grandmaster standard at this age, forget about us, even Great Grandpa and Empyrean Flutterfeather they all, wouldn’t they become a joke?” Yun Yi said with a cold laugh. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Zheng Buqun nodded and said, “What Brother Yun Yi said is extremely right! Looks like this lass still has some strength. It’s just that being able to beat Du Ruofei was also just good luck!”

Yun Yi nodded his head and said, “It’s only natural!”

However, the things that developed next completely surpassed their imaginations.

Before long, the manservant returned again to report. He said, “Ning Siyu versus Zhan Jiaqing, perfect victory!”

“Ning Siyu versus Zhan Songfang, perfect victory!”

...

One news after another came over, everyone inside the room was thoroughly struck senseless.

One or two could still be said to be due to luck.

But, eliminating seven to eight in one go, could it still be luck?

This battle lasted for four days and four nights.

In the end, Yun Yi and the rest were long already numb.

Ning Siyu fought 20 over matches in a row and actually suffered zero defeat!

This kind of strength had blown up no idea how many people’s eyeballs.

The current eastern-street marketplace was long already overcrowded. More and more alchemists were drawn over.

“How can this girl’s strength be so strong? Looking at her appearance, she’s only a step away from the Dao Realm!”

“The reason for the servant depends on the master. Could it be that this Grandmaster Ye is really the number one alchemy genius?”

“This lass is here to take part in the Cloudpill Summit, right? This kind of strength, who can be her match among Five-star Alchemy Gods?”

...

The onlookers’ cries of exclamations repeated again and again. Currently, they were already prostrating on all fours in admiration toward Ning Siyu.

To be able to crush a bunch of Six-star geniuses with Five-star Alchemy God strength, this kind of battle achievement was sufficient to make her shoot to fame.

At this time, Luo Yue was covered with sweat. The shock in his heart was already unable to use words to describe.

He was not some random Tom, Dick, and Harry. His Alchemy Dao was already comprehended to late-stage Initial Realm. He was just a step away from grand completion.

But even so, after he fought with Ning Siyu for four hours, he was already firmly suppressed by Ning Siyu.

At this time, he already had no way of remedying the situation and was unable to salvage his defeat anymore.

These few days, he had been observing Ning Siyu the entire time.

From the initial disdain to shock, then to stupefaction, he long did not have the initial-most underestimating heart anymore.

But he was still confident in himself.

According to his observations, Ning Siyu’s Alchemy Dao strength was also merely at the late-stage Initial Realm. She was around the same as him.

But his age was a little older than Ning Siyu. So he was confident that he would not lose to Ning Siyu.

But after the face-off, he discovered that he was wrong very quickly!

Ning Siyu flowed continuously when refining pills, seemingly like the sea that stretched long and unbroken, without any weaknesses to exploit at all.

In the four-hour contest, he did not find any opportunity at all.

Suddenly, he felt Ning Siyu’s aura grow stronger and stronger, sharper and fiercer.

Luo Yue felt that this opponent in front of him was like a celestial deity that descended to the mortal world, her aura became incomparably mighty.

The powerful aura crushed over like toppling mountains and overturning the seas.

“Puhwark!”

Finally, he could not withstand it and spurted out a mouthful of blood.

He looked at Ning Siyu with a look of astonishment, full of disbelief.

“She ... She actually broke through!”

Ye Yuan looked at Ning Siyu, his face revealing a look of relief.

The reason why he brought Ning Siyu to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital was in order to find a breakthrough opportunity for her.

With so many geniuses gathering, this was clearly the best occasion to train.

Ning Siyu also did not let him down. Under Ye Yuan’s tremendous pressure, her courage mounted as the fights progressed, finally breaking through to the grand completion Initial Realm.

Taking this step, she would be able to push forward toward the goal of Dao Realm.

“Grand completion Initial Realm! A Five-star Alchemy God could reach grand completion Initial Realm! This ... What kind of talent is this!”

“Why has such a genius never been heard of before in the past?”

“Could it be that this girl was really groomed by Grandmaster Ye? But ... But his age isn’t even as old as this lass!”

...

There were cries of exclamations all around. Currently, they unwittingly started to waver about Ye Yuan’s strength.

At this time, Ning Siyu slowly opened her eyes and said coolly, “What does a Five-star Alchemy God reaching Initial Realm count for? When His Excellency was at Three-star Alchemy God, he already stepped into the Dao Realm! He is the true genius!”

Breaking through to the grand completion Initial Realm, Ning Siyu felt that her state of mind was already totally different.

Originally, she thought that her strength could not compete with these ancient families’ descendants.

But now, she was filled with confidence!

She already could not find an opponent among her peers.

Weren’t these Six-star Alchemy Gods defeated at her hands too?

But the more it was so, the more she felt that Ye Yuan was unfathomable.

The comprehension of Initial Realm was already so difficult, so how did Ye Yuan comprehend Dao Realm at Heaven Glimpse Realm?

Could he not bear the name of number one alchemy genius?

In Ning Siyu’s heart, the Medicine Ancestor was also merely thus, right?

It was just that her words caused a mighty uproar in the crowd.

“What? Three-star Alchemy God, Dao Realm? This ... This isn’t joking around, right?!”

“Impossible! Absolutely impossible! If it’s really like this, then wouldn’t so-called geniuses become a joke?”

“This lass, even if she won, there’s also no need to elevate that punk like this, right? Saying this sort of word, there also has to be someone who believes it!”

...

Ning Siyu reached grand completion Initial Realm when at Five-star Alchemy God; this was already outrageous to hear.

Now, she actually said that Ye Yuan comprehended Dao Realm when at Three-star, this was complete utter nonsense!

Reaching the Dao Realm when at the Three-star Alchemy God Realm, then him being at the Six-star Alchemy God Realm now, what kind of realm was he in?

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly stood up, went to Luo Yue’s side, and said coolly, “Looks like your bit of strength isn’t able to obtain the qualifications to challenge me. Go back and train more. Perhaps one day in the future, you’ll have the qualifications to challenge me.”
