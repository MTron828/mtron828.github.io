Chapter 2686: Can’t Do It Without Me!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Why … Why is it like this?”

Everyone’s faces changed wildly, clearly frightened by this scene.

What the freaking hell!

Whoever attacked Ye Yuan would be directly finished off?

What was there to play still?!

If the previous one was a coincidence, then what was the deal with these three?

Thinking back to that mysterious summoning that Ye Yuan talked about before entering, if they still did not understand what happened, then they would be a bunch of pigs!

“What the hell is this?! Why would the Land of Dragon Slumber protect this guy?” Youqing was full of puzzlement.

“Based on what! What right does this guy have, to be able to receive the Land of Dragon Slumber’s showing of favor!” Muchen said with a reluctant look.

These young powerhouses were all unreconciled to it, indignant, and had fear mixed in.

They were originally planning on teaming up to deal with Ye Yuan, this outsider, after entering the Land of Dragon Slumber.

Who knew that he had arrived home!

“Based on what? Of course, it’s based on the fact that my bloodline power is strong! I said it long ago, you all are pseudo-dragons. Now, are you guys still not convinced??Mn,?not convinced is all right, but it’s useless,” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

One sentence choked the young powerhouses present until they were speechless.

Yeah, the greatest probability was because Ye Yuan’s bloodline power was strong.

This place was the Land of Dragon Slumber. Of course, it would regard people with strong bloodline power in a more favorable light.

“Ahhh!?Help! There’s a monster!”

Right at this time, a shrill scream suddenly came from the depths of the cave.

Who could it be if not Little Dragon Girl?

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, his figure suddenly turning into a streak of electricity, dashing towards the depths.

While the others exchanged glances and also followed after respectively.

After a short time, in a narrow passageway, Little Dragon Girl was fighting as she retreated.

More than ten blood-colored afterimages forced Little Dragon Girl until she was teetering on her feet.

One had to know, even without Ye Yuan’s participation, Little Dragon Girl’s strength was sufficient to reach middle Jade Sovereign Heaven too.

But currently, under the pincer attack of more than ten blood shadows, Little Dragon Girl clearly could not hold on anymore.

Seemingly perceiving Ye Yuan’s approach, Little Dragon Girl yelled, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, quickly come and help! I almost can’t hold on anymore!”

Ye Yuan’s face fell and joined the battle with a flash.

And right at this time, those over a dozen blood shadows seemed to have seen something terrifying, all retreating in an instant.

When Little Dragon Girl saw this scene, a pair of round eyes became wide-saucers.

When the others saw this scene, they became even more convinced of their previous judgment.

“Whoa, Big Brother Ye Yuan, you’re really too incredible. They seem to be scared of you!” Little Dragon Girl looked at Ye Yuan and said with a look of worship.

But Ye Yuan frowned slightly and said in a solemn voice, “You lass, are your buttocks itching again?”

Little Dragon Girl stuck her tongue out and said cheekily, “I was curious! Don’t be angry, alright, Big Brother Ye Yuan?”

Got to admit, Little Dragon Girl was very scared of Ye Yuan.

While the others had long already had a taste of Little Dragon Girl’s fearlessness.

Seeing this scene, they could not help clicking their tongues in wonder.

This scourge yielded to Ye Yuan

“What on earth is going on?” Ye Yuan asked in a solemn voice.

Little Dragon Girl said, “Aiya, I discovered a blood-red fruit in front. It looks very impressive. I was just about to go and pluck it. In the end, these guys came out, it scared me to death!”

“Blood-red fruit?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

The moment this was said, the eyes of the others lit up.

Even a fool would also know that this blood-red fruit was not an ordinary item.

“Mn,?that fruit seems to be condensed out of blood, seemingly very impressive! With one look, I felt that it was not ordinary and wanted to go and pluck it. In the end, these guys came out. But, I don’t know why; the moment they saw you, it’s like rats seeing a cat. All ran away,” Little Dragon Girl said curiously.

Not far away, Youqing and the rest were gnashing their teeth in hatred.

What else could there be? Because this Land of Dragon Slumber was protecting Ye Yuan!

The dangers here did not seem to be dangers to Ye Yuan at all!

“Come, bring me to take a look!” Ye Yuan said.

Hence, Little Dragon Girl brought Ye Yuan and went to a remote cave.

Sure enough, a blood-red fruit was growing in the center of the cave, looking breath-taking.

One look and it was clear that it was not something simple.

“That’s … Vermillion Spirit Fruit!” Youqing said with a look of shock when he saw the fruit.

“It’s actually the Vermillion Spirit Fruit, that’s a sacred relic of the Dragon Clan!”

“A Vermillion Spirit Fruit can directly increase a segment of bloodline power! Such a treasure can simply only come by with luck, but not by searching for it!”

It was not up to these people to not exclaim in shock!

Vermillion Spirit Fruit, it was equivalent to the promotion of bloodline!

A Vermillion Spirit Fruit could let a dragon increase a segment of bloodline power unconditionally!

Nobody could resist this sort of temptation!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Several figures rushed over at once when they saw the Vermillion Spirit Fruit.

There was even a Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum among them!

Nothing could be done about it, treasures always moved people.

But right at this time, more than ten blood shadows suddenly appeared.

Each of these blood shadows was extremely powerful, instantly surrounding those few powerhouses.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

An astonishing great battle immediately erupted in the cave.

The result was that after a moment, those few people were directly thrashed.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, these blood shadows are so formidable, why don’t we join forces to deal with them!” Little Dragon Girl said.

The two of them joining hands was equivalent to a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. They naturally would not fear these blood shadows.

However, Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a smile, “No need, I’ll go and pluck it!”

Little Dragon Girl said in surprise, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, your strength is too weak. Don’t joke around!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Who’s joking with you?”

As he said, Ye Yuan’s figure drifted, directly arriving in front of the Vermillion Spirit Fruit.

Those blood shadows directly dissipated without a trace, as if they had never appeared before.

When Little Dragon Girl saw this scene, a pair of round eyes stared like wide-saucers again as she cried out in surprise, “What did you do, Big Brother Ye Yuan? Each and every one of those blood shadows have an extremely strong brutal air, they actually don’t have any reaction to you at all!”

Ye Yuan threw the Vermillion Spirit Fruit to Land of Dragon Slumber and said with a smile, “I didn’t do anything. It’s just that this Land of Dragon Slumber seems to have chosen me. Therefore, freely pick the treasures here! Here, the Vermillion Spirit Fruit!”

Little Dragon Girl shook her head hard and said, “I can’t take it! The Vermillion Spirit Fruit is too precious. Furthermore, you obtained it, I can’t hog it on my own!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You lass, stop being courteous with me. Let me tell you, the treasures of this Land of Dragon Slumber, as long as you want them, there’s none that I can’t get! Therefore, just take it!”

Little Dragon Girl said in surprise, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, you’re bragging! Back then, my Royal Father narrowly escaped death here too, before he had today’s position. What right do you have to dare say such a thing?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t believe me?”

Little Dragon Girl shook her head and said, “Don’t believe you!”

Ye Yuan extended his hand and beckoned as he said, “Come here!”

Those blood shadows were immediately like small fries, coming before Ye Yuan and kneeling down.

When Little Dragon Girl saw this scene, her two eyes immediately shone!
