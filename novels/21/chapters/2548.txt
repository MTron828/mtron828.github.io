Chapter 2554: Cleansing the Marrow!

Originally, obtaining a seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, Second Prince was already satisfied.

But now, with the others serving as a foil, seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was useless.

Unappetizing and yet not bad enough to be thrown away!

“Why? Don’t want it? If you don’t want it, you can return it to me.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Second Prince hurriedly took it back, thickened his skin, and said, “Want! Why won’t I want it!?H-Haha!”

Ye Yuan said, “Why I gave you seventh grade, you have a score in your heart! If not looking at the account of Brother Lu’s face, forget about seventh grade; there won’t even be first grade! Since you gambled on me, then you should have the most basic trust. I don’t like people who only pursue interests!”

Finished saying, he turned to Lu Yun again and said, “Brother Lu, this heavenly pill is for you. If you don’t want it, you can destroy it. But I don’t want it to be used on others.”

Lu Yun’s expression changed, and he nodded slightly.

Clearly, Ye Yuan had already seen through his intentions.

He was currently planning in his heart to give his own ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to Second Prince after returning.

Second Prince was depressed!

At this time, he wished to give himself two tight slaps.

Why did he have to speak out of turn at that time?

His mouth really owed a beating!

One sentence and two grades were gone!

Really expensive!

But after sending everyone away, Ye Yuan took out a wooden box.

A golden Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was placed inside.

It was just that the aura of this heavenly pill was different from the rest.

It was a golden pill but did not have a dazzling light.

The ninth grade golden pills that Ye Yuan gave Tang Yu and the others were all dazzling to the eyes, their aura imposing.

But this one was extremely restrained.

Restrained like it was not a ninth grade golden pill!

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered and he muttered to himself, “Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, I finally reached the realm of grand completion! Wonder what kind of effect this grand completion realm ninth grade golden pill will have!

This Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was not an ordinary ninth grade golden pill, but a ninth grade golden pill that returned to one’s original simplicity after reaching the realm of grand completion!

A year had already passed since the wager with Lin Lan.

This one year, Ye Yuan did nothing and put all of his energy into the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

Finally, the closed-seclusion this time, he advanced the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to grand completion!

These few years, through the legacies that Gu Mao left behind as well as the exchanges with heavenly alchemists such as Jiang Yu, Ye Yuan discovered the special aspects of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

The most basic heavenly pill but also the most consolidated heavenly pill!

Foundation was the root of Heavenly Stratum powerhouses.

As the saying went: a journey of a thousand miles began with a single step, this foundation was the step!

Therefore, Ye Yuan spent decades of effort all on this one medicinal pill, the intention was self-explanatory.

Cultivating the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to the realm of grand completion, when Ye Yuan attempted to refine other medicinal pills, it would naturally yield twice the results with half the effort!

The most basic refining technique of heavenly pills, a very large part of it was in this Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!

When the heavenly pill entered the abdomen, a warm current flowed in the meridians.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s mind shook.

He felt that there was something seeping out little by little.

This grand completion Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was like a high-pressure hydraulic pump, scouring his meridians continuously.

And this force even penetrated into his bone marrow.

Cleansing the marrow!

Advancing to Heavenly Stratum, the human body seemed to have reached the extreme.

The difficulty of wanting to cleanse the marrow again was too high.

But this grand completion Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill did it!

No idea how long had passed either, there was an additional pile of black mud around Ye Yuan. A foul smell greeted the nose.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, shaking all the grime on his body away.

Then, he flicked his sleeves grandly and cleared this pile of black mud away.

Ye Yuan felt wild ecstasy in his heart. He felt like he was completely reborn!

This cleansing of the marrow did not have much improvement on his strength.

But it seemed to make him a little closer to this heaven and earth.

Although, it was just that tiny bit!

He immediately shouted, “Xiao Qi, have Tang Yu fetch me the pre-natal cloud stone!”

With Ye Yuan suddenly wanting the pre-natal cloud stone, Tang Yu father and son and Jiang Yu were both alarmed.

All of them arrived at the closed-seclusion place, wondering what happened.

One point this sort of thing, did it still need to be measured again?

“What happened, Big Brother? Why did you suddenly want to test affinity?” Tang Yu asked curiously.

Ye Yuan said rather agitated, “It’s nothing. I just want to test it!”

Tang Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Big Brother, affinity is innate. It can never be changed! Even if you try again, it’s impossible for affinity to increase too!”

While talking, Ye Yuan already placed his palm on the pre-natal cloud stone.

The pre-natal cloud stone emitted a faint light!

That was right, it was a faint light!

If not for being in this dark room, it would have been almost impossible to detect it!

But it was precisely this bit of light that made Tang Yu’s heart tremble fiercely!

Back then, when Ye Yuan tested his affinity, he saw with his own eyes that there was no reaction at all!

Outside all said that Ye Yuan was one point affinity, but actually, Ye Yuan’s affinity did not reach one point at all.

It was virtually close to zero!

But now, the pre-natal cloud stone actually gave off light!

Tang Yu’s eyes nearly popped out and he said in shock, “This … how is this possible? Affinity … Big Brother, you … actually have affinity now?”

Jiang Yu also felt his breath. Staring fixedly at the pre-natal cloud stone, he cried out in surprise, “It moved! The scale moved! I-It surpassed one point!”

Ye Yuan’s affinity was slowly rising.

First was surpassing one point. Then, it slowly passed two points.

Finally, it stopped at three points!

“Three points!”

Tang Yu cried out strangely and almost jumped up. He exclaimed in surprise, “Big Brother! Y-Y-Your affinity r-rose to three points!”

In his agitation, Tang Yu’s tongue was knotted when he was talking.

Three points affinity was naturally nothing.

In fact, it did not even cross the threshold.

But Ye Yuan rose from close to zero!

Ye Yuan had a bright smile. He was very satisfied with this number.

Three points, even to the most rubbish heavenly alchemist, they turned their noses up at it in disdain too.

But, Ye Yuan yearned for it!

The handicap of affinity on his alchemy was seriously too great. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Even if he cultivated the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to the realm of grand completion, he still felt that the road ahead was vague.

But, three points was absolutely a qualitative change to Ye Yuan!

Previously, Ye Yuan was a complete and utter blind man; unable to see anything.

But now, there was finally a faint light that entered his eyes!

This step was absolutely a vital step to his path of alchemy!

More importantly, affinity could be improved!

“Heh,?didn’t expect to actually have such a harvest. What an unexpected surprise!”

Ye Yuan had a look of excitement and immediately practiced alchemy.

He was already too impatient to wait!

Sure enough, the moment he started, it was immediately a lot easier!

Although it was still a mass of chaos in the heavenly medicines, by relying on his powerful alchemy instinct, it was more than ten times easier for Ye Yuan to refine pills than before!

A ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was refined by him very quickly.

“Miracle! A true miracle! I didn’t expect that affinity can actually be increased! Three points are nothing to others, but to Younger Brother Ye, it’s simply akin to adding wings to a tiger!” Jiang Yu exclaimed.
