Chapter 1529 The Power of the Purple Extreme Hall

“Yi Han, it was all thanks to you! Now, you caused me to be dispatched here together with you!”

A rugged fiend lord was currently grumbling to Yi Han incessantly.

Yi Han had an indifferent look and did not refute it either.

She knew that whatever she said now was all wrong.

But could this be blamed on her?

Even Lord Heavenstar and Lord Di En could not see through the flaws, how could she see through?

Who would have thought that a human could actually disguise as a fiend perfectly?

Mo Han looked at this scene with a gloating face and did not talk too.

He offered to stay behind.

Mo Han’s grudge toward Ye Yuan was extremely deep. Thinking of that incomparably arrogant appearance of Ye Yuan’s, he was unwell from head to toe.

Now, he could finally make Ye Yuan kneel in front of him to beg for mercy.

How could he let this chance slip by?

“Alright, Zi Chen. You stop complaining too. Want to say who hates that kid the most right now, it’s Younger Sister Yi Han. Don’t you agree, Younger Sister Yi Han?” Mo Han suddenly spoke up.

Yi Han looked at Mo Han rather surprisedly and said with a nod, “What Brother Mo Han said is right. I wish that I can devour his raw flesh right now to vent the hatred in my heart! As long as that punk comes out, I’ll let him know what’s called a fate worse than death!”

Just as she was talking, Yi Han felt something and looked in the direction of the ruins.

Mo Han got a huge shock too and said, “The array formation ... vanished!”

The three people were first startled, then immediately revealed ecstatic looks.

Inside these ancient ruins, there were clearly many treasures hidden.

Even if they only obtained a fiend lord mystic treasure, it was a tremendous harvest too!

Suddenly, Yi Han’s brows furrowed and she said, “Something’s amiss! This array formation was fine, so how could it disappear? Could it be ... a scam?”

Mo Han also felt that it was rather somewhat odd. After ruminating for a moment, his eyes suddenly lit up and he said, “Most likely, the inheritance in this ancient ruins is already acquired by Source Night that punk. That’s why the array formation would disappear.”

Talking up to here, he laughed savagely and said, “As long as we capture that brat, all of the treasures will all belong to us!”

The other two people’s eyes also shone, revealing incomparably scorching looks.

They knew that Di Fan only made it through eight rounds and already obtained a low-grade divine lord mystic treasure.

Ye Yuan made it through 18 rounds and also stayed inside for three months. The inheritance obtained, just thinking about it made people feel excited.

Yi Han suddenly said, “My two elder brothers, if the treasures are very few, Yi Han doesn’t want anything. If there are many treasures, Yi Han only asks for a fiend lord mystic treasure to be by my side. The rest will all belong to the two elder brothers, is that okay?”

Yi Han was very smart, making concessions in order to gain advantages.

She already lowered her attitude very low and only asked for one fiend lord mystic treasure. This request was really not considered overboard.

Otherwise, if the three people had a dispute, she probably could not even scoop up anything.

Mo Han two people exchanged a glance and said with a nod, “No problem, this request isn’t overboard! If there aren’t many treasures, we can’t get a single one either. All of them have to be presented to the hall. If there are many, there is no cause for much criticism for us to keep a few pieces in private.”

“Then let’s ... rush in now?” Zi Chen said.

Mo Han smiled and said, “Rush in for what? Isn’t it fine to sit and wait here? That brat obtained the inheritance, could it be that he still won’t come out?”

Zi Chen’s eyes lit up and he said with a smile, “That makes sense!”

The three people exchanged a glance and smiled, immediately vanishing from where they stood.

Not long after, a figure slowly appeared at the hall’s entrance. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

After coming out, Ye Yuan appeared very cautious, pulling out the Junyi Sword with a vigilant look.

When Yi Han three people hiding in the void saw this scene, how could they still endure? They directly revealed themselves, surrounding Ye Yuan.

“Master Source Night, long time no see!” Mo Han said with a smile that was not a smile.

But Yi Han said coldly, “Source Night, you tricked me so bitterly! Today, I’m going to make you regret having been born in this world!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, his figure moved swiftly, directly speeding over into the abode.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Yi Han’s mouth and she said, “Running? Can you run?”

As she said, Yi Han waved a hand. A powerful world power instantly wrapped Ye Yuan up.

She thought that Ye Yuan did not have the leeway to resist in front of the world power at all.

Who knew that Ye Yuan actually directly ignored her power of the world and dashed into the ruins.

The three people’s expressions changed. They did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so troublesome.

“Chase him!”

The three people exchanged a glance, immediately making a decision.

With this alerting of the enemy, Ye Yuan probably would not come out anymore.

Either way, the array formation already disappeared, what did they still have to be afraid of?

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Three figures followed closely behind Ye Yuan, sweeping into the ruins.

The three people followed Ye Yuan, their speed swift to the extreme.

Suddenly, there was a blurry scene before their eyes, arriving inside a great hall.

This great hall was a dead end, Ye Yuan had nowhere to run anymore!

Yi Han sneered and said, “Run! Aren’t you very capable at running?”

Mo Han also smiled and said, “Master Source Night, we haven’t seen each other for three months, isn’t coming out to reminiscence about old times good? Run for what?”

But Zi Chen’s expression turned dark and he said, “Kid, hand over all of the treasures you obtained and I’ll make it painless for you!”

But entering the hall, Ye Yuan changed expressions. The original tension and vigilance had all but disappeared. What replaced it was indescribable calmness.

The calmness of being in control of everything!

“Huhu, reminiscing about old days outside, that isn’t the way to treat guests. Therefore, I invited the three of you in. Now, we can talk about the old days,” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

The three people’s expressions changed and Yi Han said in a cold voice, “What do you mean?”

“Heh, trying to scare us? Kid, with our current distance, as long as I move my finger, you’re dead!” Mo Han said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “Is that so? I don’t even need to move a finger and you’ll be dead.”

When Mo Han heard, he could not refrain from bursting into laughter and said, “This hall master really grew up being scared! Then I want to see whether you not taking action is faster, or me making a move is faster!”

Ye Yuan did not have the least bit of fear and said with a faint smile, “Then your meaning is ... no need to reminiscence about the old days anymore?”

Mo Han’s expression suddenly became savage and he shouted fiercely, “Reminiscence your uncle! This hall master will tear you into pieces right now!”

Finished talking, a horrifying aura spread out. Mo Han really extended a finger and pointed at Ye Yuan. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But right at this time, an even more horrifying aura suddenly filled the great hall.

Three streaks of flowing light descended from the sky, directly falling towards the three people.

Mo Han’s power of the world had yet to condense. Under this horrifying stream of light, he did not have the slightest strength to resist and was directly annihilated without even crying out.

Three mighty fiend lord powerhouses were obliterated by the Purple Extreme Hall just like this.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene expressionlessly and said with a sigh, “My 150 million divine essence stones, how many spirit medicines could this purchase! Forget it, forget it, can’t stay in this place for too long, better leave first.”

Rumble ...

The incomparably colossal ancient ruins actually shrunk rapidly, making the mountains tremble.

Finally, the Purple Extreme Hall turned into a grain of dust and whirled away in the direction of the human race.
