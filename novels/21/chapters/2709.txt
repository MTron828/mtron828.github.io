Chapter 2715: Cleaning Up Household!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan patted his bull head and said smilingly, “What? Not killing me anymore?”

Big Yellow sweat heavily and hurriedly said, “Master’s methods are mysterious and unpredictable. It was Big Yellow who offended Master Ye previously! From now on, Big Yellow will definitely show Master Ye the etiquette of a disciple!”

At this point, if he still did not understand why Lord Saint Exalt would address Ye Yuan as a brother, then he would really be an idiot.

A grade three heavenly pill actually let him break through to half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven. It was simply inconceivable!

Using mysterious and unpredictable to describe was not overboard in the slightest.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said,?“Mn,?after going back, I’ll give you a list. If you can gather the heavenly medicines, I’ll naturally help you to refine a Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill as well when the time comes, and help you to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.”

Big Yellow Bull’s body quivered and he said in disbelief, “I-Is this for real?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course it’s real. Otherwise, do you think Big Brother’s words were to make a fool out of you?”

Arriving in front of Bright Tiger and the rest, they gave a bow to Big Yellow.

“Paying respects to Commander Big Yellow, congratulations to Commander Big Yellow for breaking through to half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Toward these few people, Big Yellow naturally had a sense of superiority and said with a nod, “Thank you, gentlemen. The one in charge here today is Master Ye. You guys just have to listen to his orders.”

The few people trembled all over as they said in disbelief, “Master Ye?”

What kind of status did Commander Big Yellow have, to actually show Ye Yuan the etiquette of a disciple? What was wrong with this world?

Ye Yuan disappeared for a period of time and actually became ‘Master Ye’ with a sudden metamorphosis!

Although they already faintly had some conjectures previously that Ye Yuan became associated with Saint Exalt Bull Demon. But, becoming this sort of relationship all of a sudden, they still felt that it was inconceivable!

Big Yellow said coolly, “Master Ye has become sworn brothers with Lord Saint Exalt. This commander naturally addresses him as master!”

“What?! B-Became sworn brothers?” Bright Tiger King’s entire body trembled, almost biting his own tongue off.

At this moment, their pleasant surprise about losing Ye Yuan and recovering him turned into fright.

This was no joke!

A Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum became sworn brothers with Lord Saint Exalt. What the hell was this?

One had to know, Ye Yuan was a hostage-like existence at their place.

They actually took Lord Saint Exalt’s brother hostage!

This crime was heinous!

Although these few were all half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, they did not know about Saint Sovereign Heavens needing to transcend tribulations.

They were naturally also unable to understand why Saint Exalt Bull Demon would do such a preposterous thing.

“That’s right! Lord Saint Exalt said that if you see Master Ye in the future, it’s equivalent to seeing him. If anyone wants to make things difficult for Master Ye, that’s making things difficult for him!” Big Yellow said coolly.

The five people’s expressions instantly became ugly to the extreme.

“P-Paying respects to Master Ye!” Bright Tiger King was the first to react as he said rather awkwardly.

“Paying respects to Master Ye!” Myriad Elephant and the rest all bowed awkwardly as they said.

Their words carried thick fear.

What they were more scared of was Ye Yuan settling the scores afterward!

With a Saint Sovereign Heaven as a backer, it was effortless to eradicate them!

How could Ye Yuan not know their concerns? He said with a smile, “Gentlemen, don’t need to be afraid, I don’t have the intention of settling scores with you all. What I promised you all, I’ll do it too. But right now, we’d better take care of Bright Tiger King’s family matters first.”

“Family matters?” Bright Tiger said with a blank face.

The moment these words came out, the expressions of Hefeng and the rest who were behind Bright Tiger changed drastically.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t you know that Shuoyan and I getting besieged on Three Saint Mountain, it was actually the work of your few sons?”

“What?!” Bright Tiger’s tiger body trembled and he turned to look at his sons.

“Royal Father, we didn’t!” Shaba was the first to react and denied it firmly.

“Yeah, Royal Father. Think about it, with our strength, how can we possibly mobilize so many Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses? Ye Yuan he came under the patronage of a big shot and is making slanderous charges!” Hefeng also said with righteous indignation.

Purplelight Battle Wolf they all had long already hidden themselves.

Either way, there was no proof either. As long as they denied it firmly, what could Ye Yuan do to them?

The moment Bright Tiger heard, his brows furrowed slightly.

Although he doted on his youngest son Shuoyan, it was also impossible to sentence nine sons to death because of one sentence. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Master Ye, although you become sworn brothers with Lord Saint Exalt now, you also can’t slander people at random, right? This king is most clear about their strength. It’s impossible to mobilize so many Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!” Bright Tiger said.

Hearing this, Hefeng and the rest all secretly heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, they looked toward Ye Yuan gloatingly.

Shuoyan was young in the end, hearing his few older brothers quibble like this, he was long already burning with fury.

“Do you all still want face or not? The Eight-spotted Leopard and Purplelight Battle Wolf already personally admitted it. You guys are actually still putting on an act here! To think that I’ve always regarded you guys as my closest loved ones, when in fact you all are actually so vicious!” Shuoyan said furiously.

“Old Sixteen, you can’t anyhow say things! As elder brothers, we didn’t skimp out on doting you and giving in to you normally! I believe that Royal Father sees this too! Now that you found a backer, you’re going to put your hands on your brothers? Old Sixteen, aren’t you a little too vicious?” Shaba said with a look of indignation.

“Old Sixteen, you still require your own effort if you want to succeed Royal Father’s position of king. Even if you kill all of us, it won’t do if your strength is lacking!” Hefeng supplemented with a stab.

When Bright Tiger heard this, he nodded his head in even greater agreement.

He could still tell how they behaved normally.

The other nine have indeed shown consideration and care for Shuoyan.

It was just that he did not know that the situation in the past year had already changed too much.

“Old Sixteen, you’ve grown up! It’s just that this kind of method disappoints this king too greatly!” Bright Tiger let out a sigh and said with melancholy.

“You all … You all … ” Shuoyan’s face reddened to the ears in his anxiousness.

Shuoyan discovered that he was still too inexperienced.

With a few words, he was actually rebutted until he had nothing to say in reply.

He seriously could not find the evidence to refute them.

At this time, Ye Yuan patted his shoulder and said unhurriedly, “Kid, don’t need to be anxious until your face changes colors. Teach you another move today. In this world, words are feeble. Only strength is the true capital to establish yourself!”

The moment his voice faded, an origin divinity attack burst forth.

Shaba gave a muffled groan and directly fell to the ground dead.

The faces of everyone present changed.

No one expected that Ye Yuan actually made a move to kill under the circumstances where there was no valid reason at all!

“Ye Yuan, you!” Bright Tiger said furiously.

He was already guarding against Ye Yuan, but he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually instantly killed Shaba with an origin divinity attack!

Ye Yuan ignored him and still said to Shuoyan lightly, “I’ll get things rolling. I’ll leave the rest to you.”

Shuoyan’s entire body trembled and immediately nodded his head deeply.

Since words failed, then he would kill!

Shuoyan was a hot-blooded man in his bones too.

At this point, he naturally had no reason to shrink back.

Bright Tiger’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Shuoyan, you dare?!”

Big Yellow Bull snorted and said coolly, “This commander wants to see who dares to make a move!”
