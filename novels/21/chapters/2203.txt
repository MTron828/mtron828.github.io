Chapter 2207: Heaven Rewards the Faithful!

The noonday sun shone high above. Bright Moon Restaurant was bustling with activity, having all sorts of voices mingling together. It was very noisy.

But as the top restaurant in Dragonstone Imperial City, this place was the place where information was well-connected.

At this time, five martial artists were currently chatting merrily at a large table.

A man who had a scar on his face said mysteriously, “Have you guys heard? These few years, a big shot appeared in the east region of Kindness Imperial City!”

With him saying this, it indeed aroused the attention of the other few people.

A younger brother said with interest, “Elder Brother Scar, you’re the most well-informed. Tell us what incredible big shot appeared.”

Elder Brother Scar chuckled and said, “This remarkable figure isn’t in Kindness Imperial City, but in a village that’s in the wilderness of a county subordinate to Kindness Imperial City! This person is called Master Ning, his alchemy skills being exceptional!”

A companion said disdainfully, “Haha, Elder Brother Scar, you’re talking nonsense here! What remarkable great figure can appear in a wild countryside’s village?”

The moment Elder Brother Scar heard, he was immediately annoyed and said with a cold smile, “What the hell do you know?! This person is called Master Ning. Over 60 years ago, this Master Ning rose into prominence, completely turning a village that was full of mortals all into Grotto Profound Realms overnight! At present, more than 60 years have passed, those mortals that followed him back then are all Divine Lord Realm now! That tiny little village is full of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses now!”

The moment these words came out, the few people at the table sucked in a cold breath.

A village with all the people being at the Divine Lord Realm, how terrifying was this? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In just 60 years, making a village of mortals all reaching the Divine Lord Realm, was this something that a human could accomplish?

A companion said with a look of disbelief, “Elder Brother Scar, you ... you’re also being too ridiculous, right? This sort of thing, even a Six-star Alchemy God likely can’t do it too, right?”

Elder Brother Scar sipped a mouthful of wine and said with a chuckle, “Therefore, that’s why I said that he’s a remarkable great figure! Right now, the heavyweights of the several dozen imperial cities around that village, even the heavyweights of imperial capitals, are virtually all his esteemed guests! Our Dragonstone Imperial City is a little far away from Kindness Imperial City, so the news is much slower. At first, I didn’t believe it either. But a friend of mine heard this news when he was in traveling outside and really dropped by to request for pills. In the end, he broke through!”

His companions’ faces were full of shock!

Elder Brother Scar was a Third Firmament Divine Lord. Being able to be his friend, it was naturally a person at the Divine Lord Realm too.

Being able to let a Divine Lord Realm breakthrough so casually, it was definitely not what an ordinary person could do.

“Elder Brother Scar, such an astonishing great figure, would the medicinal pills be so easy to request?” A companion asked curiously.

Elder Brother Scar smiled coldly and said, “Didn’t you not believe it just now?”

The companion gave an awkward laugh and said, “Not that I don’t believe, but it’s truly that it’s somewhat fantastical!”

Elder Brother Scar had the intention of showing off as he said smugly, “Saying that that master’s medicinal pills are easy to request for, they are easy. Saying that they aren’t easy to request for, it’s also not easy. It just depends on whether you have that affinity or not.”

The companion’s appetite was also successfully whetted up and he asked with a curious look, “Oh? What does that mean?”

Elder Brother Scar smiled and said, “This master wants for nothing and only asks for Alchemy Dao records! Furthermore, as long as it’s an Alchemy Dao record, he would accept it without exception and refine medicinal pills for you. But a few years ago, it was naturally a little easier to ask for it. But along with the passage of time, the records in that master’s hands got more and more. The duplicates naturally also got more and more. This way, medicinal pills became harder to ask for. That friend of mine obtained before an Alchemy Dao record in his early years, it just so happened that that master didn’t have it. That’s how he succeeded by a fluke.”

Everyone had a look of realization and said, “So that’s how it is!”

The more Elder Brother Scar said, the more proud of himself he got as he continued, “Furthermore, I heard that this Master Ning doesn’t have any divine essence in his body, relying completely on array formations when refining pills! Even so, the quality of the medicinal pills that he refines is extremely high. The pills absolutely won’t be below divine-grade! Medicinal pills that have been refined by him have already been hiked to a sky-high price outside. Furthermore, there was demand, but no market!”

When the companions heard, each and every one of them clicked their tongues in wonder.

Not far away, a man and a woman sat by the window.

The woman had a fine gauze covering her face, her body trembling slightly.

The man opposite sighed and said, “The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment too! What they are talking about is Master Ning.”

The girl suddenly calmed down again and said softly, “Even if I search until the seas wither and rocks decay, I also have to find Young Master!”

The man let out another sigh and said, “Really envy him, to be able to have lovers like you all.”

Done talking, the man put down a few pieces of divine essence stones on the table and got up and said, “Come on. I hope that this piece of news isn’t simply a waste of effort this time.”

The girl with the fine gauze nodded slightly, got up, and left Bright Moon Restaurant with the man.

... ...

Over 60 years passed quickly. The originally quiet little village became the most bustling place in a radius of ten million miles.

Chen Village had many powerhouses coming and going every day.

In these 60 years, Master Ning’s reputation grew more and more resounding. Powerhouses of various places came due to his fame.

It alarmed the surrounding capital cities, imperial cities, and even imperial capitals.

In just 60 years, apart from refining pills, Ye Yuan only did one thing. That was reading books!

The Alchemy Dao records that he collected were enough to fill a house to the rafters. He immersed himself in the Alchemy Dao records every day.

He could not remember the things in the past, but amidst the pill refinements and Alchemy Dao records, he seemed to be able to find a trace of his past shadow.

Being very wide-read, Ye Yuan gleaned much nourishment from it.

Gathering knowledge from around the world, Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao strength also advanced by leaps and bounds unknowingly.

With the pill refining strength that Ye Yuan exhibited, there were naturally people who had devious ideas before too.

But ever since a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse entered the Chen Village and never came out again, no one dared to have designs on the Chen Village anymore.

Along with the passing of time, Ye Yuan’s injuries got better bit by bit.

Although he still did not have divine essence, over 60 years passed, his fleshy body already recovered 30-40%.

Ordinary Celestial Deity Realms were unable to get close to him at all.

“A’Ning, someone came to request for pills again! They said that they brought many precious books this time that the village doesn’t have!” A’Xiu entered Ye Yuan’s room and said joyfully.

Ye Yuan put down the jade slip in his hand and said with slight surprise, “Is that so? To talk about the Alchemy Dao records in my possession, there are really not many anymore. 60 years have passed, the Alchemy Dao records that don’t repeat also became fewer and fewer! Quickly bring me to go meet them!”

A’Xiu nodded her head and brought Ye Yuan out.

The arrivals were a man and a woman. When Ye Yuan saw the two, he clasped his hands and said, “I wonder what medicinal pills the two of you want to ask for?”

The man and woman both did not speak, but stared fixedly at Ye Yuan, their whole body trembling.

The woman gently took off her face-gauze, revealing a face that could topple kingdoms.

When A’Xiu saw this girl, she also could not help feeling ashamed of her unworthiness.

She was somewhat marveling with admiration in her heart, how could there be such a beautiful girl in the world?

However, the girl’s state did not seem to be quite right.

She was too agitated. Taking off the face-gauze, her clothes were already drenched by tears.

She looked at Ye Yuan and said agitatedly, “Young Master, Lu-er knew that you’d definitely be fine! Definitely be fine!”
