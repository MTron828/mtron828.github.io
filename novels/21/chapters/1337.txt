Chapter 1341: Terrifying Cultivation Method

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Chaos Heavenspan Canon?” Dustless mulled over this name and muttered, “Could it be that this cultivation method you created called down the Heavenspan Mountain? This ... This is impossible!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “Who cares. Either way, isn’t everybody fine right now? Uh ... Senior, how long was I in seclusion?”

“Over 300 years have already passed inside the World Suppressing Stele!”

Dustless was still somewhat shaken from shock at this time. Before Ye Yuan entered seclusion, he said that Ye Yuan needed at least several thousand years.

But now, Ye Yuan only used the outside world’s 30 years and created the Chaos Heavenspan Canon.

“Already been 30 years? I reckon that Tower Lord Yang they all are anxious again, right?” Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile.

Without his medicinal pills, for the Myriad Treasure Tower to want to stand out among the masses, it was really not too easy.

Ye Yuan was just planning on leaving seclusion but was stopped by Dustless.

“Hang on! Your current realm has already reached the peak of initial-stage Grotto Profound. It’s just one step away from being able to break through to middle-stage! This old man wants to see just how powerful this cultivation method you created is!” Dustless said.

He was currently full of doubts, very curious about this cultivation method Ye Yuan created.

What kind of cultivation method could trigger such a terrifying heaven and earth abnormal activity from the Heavenspan World?

Ye Yuan froze when he heard that and said, “What Senior says makes sense. It’s not late for me to leave seclusion after breaking through.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan flicked his long sleeves. A pile of medicinal pills appeared before his eyes.

All of them were divine-grade Divine Essence Pills!

With Ye Yuan’s present strength, refining divine-grade Divine Essence Pills was not considered some remarkable thing anymore.

If outsiders saw Ye Yuan’s extravagant cultivation style, they would definitely curse him for being a wastrel.

Divine-grade Divine Essence Pills were hard to ask for in the outside world, with demand but no supply.

But Ye Yuan ate it like broad beans!

Actually, Ye Yuan was also very eager toward the Chaos Heavenspan Canon.

Although this cultivation method was created by him, this was just the cultivation method he derived from visualization based on the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

As for how the specific results were, even he was also uncertain himself.

Therefore, Ye Yuan started consuming a Divine Essence Pill and assaulted middle-stage Grotto Profound!

The medicinal pill entering the abdomen, Ye Yuan refined it according to the Chaos Heavenspan Canon he created.

Then Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly changed!

“What wrong?” Dustless asked, rather nervously.

Ye Yuan himself also had astonishment written all over his face as he looked at Dustless and said, “Already refined!’

Dustless’s eyeballs stared like wide-circles, and he said in disbelief, “What did you say? R-Refined? You’re saying that you already refined the divine-grade Divine Essence Pill?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, similarly incomparably shocked as he said, “Yeah. I just revolved the cultivation method, and the Divine Essence Pills were refined into a wisp of divine essence, entering the divine sea. Mm? hang on, the divine essence in my divine sea seems to have become lesser!”

With this, the two people were utterly bewildered.

Dustless also detected it. Just now, Ye Yuan was already just a step away from middle-stage Grotto Profound.

But in this blink of an eye, he actually became a long way off!

“What the hell kind of cultivation method did you create? This ... This is also too freakish, right?”

Even if Dustless had lots of experience and vast knowledge, it was also his first time encountering this kind of situation.

Ye Yuan suddenly said, “Senior, although the divine essence became less, I feel that my divine essence seems to be much purer!”

Dustless thought about it and said, “Try refining a Divine Essence Pill again.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and started doing as said.

As soon as the Chaos Heavenspan Canon revolved, the Divine Essence Pill was refined almost instantly!

One had to know that for ordinary martial artists, even if their cultivation method was a very heaven-defying cultivation method, refining a divine-grade Divine Essence Pill needed half a month to a month’s effort too.

But Ye Yuan instantly refined it!

This kind of refining speed was simply inconceivable! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Yuan discovered that the Divine Essence Pill he refined it, it could not stir up even a trace of wave when it entered his divine sea.

He simply grabbed three Divine Essence Pills and stuffed them into his mouth, urging the Chaos Heavenspan Canon once more.

Three pills were still too little.

Hence, Ye Yuan refined Divine Essence Pills one after another.

Very soon, his Divine Essence Pills were depleted fully.

Close to 60, 70 divine-grade Divine Essence Pills were eaten completely by him like jelly beans.

By the side, Dustless was just dumbstruck with amazement from watching.

He had never seen before someone cultivating like Ye Yuan.

Those were 60 to 70 Divine Essence Pills, if it were others, their divine sea would probably be stuffed till it burst.

“This ... This is simply a bottomless hole! You’re initial-stage Grotto Profound currently, and the expenditure is already so great. When your realm is high, then the resources expended can be extremely horrifying to describe!’ Dustless sighed emotionally as he talked.

Ye Yuan looked at Dustless with a guileless look and said with a bitter smile, “Looks like I can only earn money non-stop. Otherwise, with my current appetite, it really can’t fill me up!”

Dustless suddenly said, “You sense your divine essence, see if there’s any changes or not?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “En, my divine essence seems to be way purer than before! Once I unleash martial techniques, the power should be able to increase several dozen percent!”

Dustless nodded and said, “Then that’s right! No wonder this cultivation method of yours was able to trigger heaven and earth abnormal activity, truly remarkable! I really didn’t think that you, this brat, actually have such a heaven-defying lucky chance!”

Regardless of whether it was the essence energy Ye Yuan cultivated in the past or the divine essence he cultivated now.

Martial artists’ cultivation methods were different, resulting in the purity of the divine essence within their bodies to be different as well.

The more inferior the cultivation method, the more impurities in the divine essence absorbed as well.

Once the cultivation time increased, the divine essence in the divine sea seemed to already be filled to the brim, but in reality, the impurities accumulated became more and more.

Once reading the cultivation bottleneck, the effect of these impurities would be infinitely amplified, affecting the martial artist’s breakthrough from there.

Some people were unable to break through a small bottleneck for all their lives. It was this reason!

Pure divine essence also had many benefits, such as greatly increasing the power of the martial techniques released, such as even greater battle endurance.

All in all, the benefits were too many to enumerate.

A powerful martial technique could allow multiplication of the martial artist’s combat power.

But a cultivation method determined how far this martial artist could walk in the end!

If Ye Yuan cultivated Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s cultivation method, then it would be absolutely impossible for his accomplishments to surpass Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

What Ye Yuan wanted was not just Empyrean or Heavenly Emperor Realm.

Regardless of whether or not there was a possibility of reaching the Dao Ancestor Realm, he had to give it a try!

Hence, that was why he thought of creating a cultivation method belonging to him.

Looking at it now, the effects were still pretty good.

“Looks like wanting to break through to middle-stage Grotto Profound, it still needs several hundred divine-grade Divine Essence Pills! Right now, the Divine Essence Pills are already depleted fully. got to go out and refine anew,” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

According to this degree of consumption, it was simply unimaginable in the future.

...

When Ye Yuan showed up at the Myriad Treasure Tower, he discovered that inside the Myriad Treasure Tower, it was stark empty, the business seemingly very bleak.

This situation made Ye Yuan very surprised.

Even if his seclusion time was a little long, it was not to the extent of the Myriad Treasure Tower becoming like this either, right?

Before he came, the Myriad Treasure Tower even contended with the other three great families.

“Hong Yin, what’s going on here? Why isn’t there a single customer in the Myriad Treasure Tower?” Ye Yuan said to Hong Yin, who was currently snoozing.
