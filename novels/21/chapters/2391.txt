Chapter 2397: Reunion that Spanned Spacetime!

A second ago, Yu Tanzhi’s momentum was astonishing, as if going to decimate this world.

But in the next second, his figure backed away involuntarily.

After a bout of tossing down, he actually returned to his original point again.

Wan Zhen’s pupils constricted, looking at this scene in incredible shock.

He thought that Ye Yuan became very strong, but he did not expect that he became so strong!

Just now, Ye Yuan merely relied on spatial law, and he forced Yu Tanzhi back to his original point without even making a move!

“This ... This is also too strong, right?”

“Why did his strength become even more unfathomable in the spacetime turbulence?”

“Originally thought that he had a slim chance of surviving, but who knew that he already made all of us look up to him!”

... ...

The shock that this scene earlier brought to the group of unpredictable children was too intense.

Originally, Ye Yuan still needed to use the True Nirvana Sword Formation to deal with them, these unpredictable children.

But 300 years passed, Ye Yuan did not even need to make a move and he forced Yu Tanzhi back.

One had to know, this was the Yu Tanzhi who had already made great progress, and not the Yu Tanzhi back then.

“Impossible! Impossible! Why is your spatial law strong to this kind of extent? What on earth did you experience inside the spatial turbulent flow?” Yu Tanzhi said with a dazed look.

This exchange just now, it hit him too hard.

Although the previous Ye Yuan was monstrous, he did not exceed their imagination.

But now, he already could not see Ye Yuan clearly anymore.

Ye Yuan already reached a level that he was too far behind to catch up.

Ye Yuan sighed quietly and said, “A cleansing of the soul, a tragic song of blood and years. Of course, you may never be able to understand these.”

Everyone had blank looks, uncertain what it meant.

Just then, several powerful auras burst out of the sky.

When Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets and the rest felt the fluctuations in spacetime, they rushed over.

When Profound Secrets saw Ye Yuan, he was overjoyed at first. But very soon, his expression changed wildly.

There was also Shang Hang who had virtually the same expression as him!

“Senior, do you feel that Ye Yuan’s aura ... seems like a person?” Profound Secrets felt that his mouth was a little dry.

That person, he would never be able to forget.

He had never seen that person’s true face before. But that person’s aura, he would never forget it.

It was him and his father! They were the ones who were called Azure and Profound Dual Saints!

It was him, who created an unprecedented flourishing age!

Shang Hang’s expression had an indescribable shock as he muttered, “This ... This is impossible! How can this be possible? He ... He ...”

In the long river of time, the time that that person existed, was merely a snap of a finger.

But it was that snap of the fingers that created a new era!

Ye Yuan superimposed the Ye Yuan in front of him together with that figure who traversed the endless long river of spacetime.

They were actually ... exactly the same! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At that time, he could not see that person’s true face clearly.

But now, he could see this person extremely clearly.

“Hang on! This ... This must be an illusion! How can this sort of thing possibly happen?” Shang Hang had a panicky look.

The others did not understand what it meant and did not know why these two great sovereigns would suddenly become so panicky.

Although Ye Yuan’s return was miraculous, it was also not to the extent of making them become like this, right?

What in the world happened?

Even Ancestor Lightning had a blank face too.

He did not know what could make a supreme major power like Shang Hang have such a visible change in countenance.

What in the world happened to Ye Yuan?

“Senior Shang, what’s wrong with you? Isn’t he just Ye Yuan?” Ancestor Lightning said in confusion.

Shang Hang trembled, only then abruptly startled awake and said, “Right! Right! Isn’t he just Ye Yuan? Misconception! Hahaha, it must be a misconception! Isn’t that so, Profound Secrets brat?”

He turned to look at Profound Secrets and discovered that Profound Secrets was currently looking at him extremely seriously.

Shang Hang was immediately like a deflated ball.

Profound Secrets shut his eyes and took a deep breath as if digesting something.

After a long time, he opened his eyes again, and slowly let out a turbid breath as he said, “Senior Shang, I think ... I understand!”

Shang Hang’s expression was ugly as he said, “What did you understand?”

Profound Secrets said solemnly, “That person appeared bafflingly and left ... Similarly incomprehensibly! Just like, he appeared out of the blue and disappeared into thin air again! Do you still remember what he said? It wasn’t unwillingness, but ... couldn’t! Why couldn’t? Because ... he doesn’t belong to that era at all! Do you still remember my father’s sudden enlightenment while on his deathbed? The heaven’s secrets that he saw through, must be this! Also ... do you remember what he last said to you?”

Shang Hang’s entire body trembled, his eyes widening and looking toward Ye Yuan.

“Hope that when you meet me again, you won’t be too surprised!

“You and I still have a bout of destiny in the future! This destiny shall span spacetime!”

Even after endless years, Shang Hang still remembered that person’s words extremely clearly,

Because that person affected his whole life!

“You ... Are you really Lord Saint Azure?” Shang Hang used all the strength in his body and asked Ye Yuan.

Hearing Saint Azure two words, Ancestor Lightning’s whole body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of astonishment, titanic waves being set off in his heart!

This name, there was long already no one who remembered it in this epoch.

But in the last epoch, he was one of the two people that the myriad races admired!

When he entered the Heavenly Hidden World, Azure and Profound Dual Saints were long gone.

But their great names had never been cut off from his ears before!

It was Saint Profound who won time for the myriad races with the shielding of heaven’s secrets.

It was Saint Azure who set up 18 inheritance grand arrays and created 18 grand ancestors!

Without these two people, there would not be today’s Heavenspan World too.

With these two people, there would not be him, this Ancestor Lightning!

But how could this blazing sun-like name be connected to this immature youth before his eyes?

Ye Yuan was silent all along. But at this time, he smiled brightly and said, “Shang Hang, long time no see! You’ve done very well!”

Thud!

Shang Hang was filled with a multitude of feelings, tears streaming down his old face. He actually directly knelt down toward Ye Yuan.

“Shang Hang is incompetent and failed to completely defeat the divine race! I’ve let Your Excellency down!” This supreme powerhouse who was akin to a divinity was crying like a child at this time.

Ancestor Lightning, Wan Zhen, Yu Tanzhi, Pang Zhen, as well as the numerous powerhouses present, all opened their mouths wide, shocked until they were unable to think.

They had long already known about this old man’s identity. He was the strongest person since time immemorial and not one of!

This person was an existence who could have a showdown with the divine race’s supreme powerhouse, Tian Qing!

He was the well-deserving human race’s number one person.

But he actually knelt down toward Ye Yuan!

Although a lot was said, they still did not understand what in the world happened.

The scene before their eyes was too shocking.

The muscles on Profound Secrets’s face twitched endlessly. But in the end, it turned into a long sigh, and he also knelt down beside Shang Hang.

“Jian Haoran pays respect to Lord Saint Azure!” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said.

No matter how complicated this was, Ye Yuan’s identity of Saint Azure was undoubtedly ascertained!

Saint Azure was an existence on par with his own father!

When he saw Saint Azure, he had to kneel!
