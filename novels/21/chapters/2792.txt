Chapter 2798: Blood Race!

Transtator: Atlas Studios

Editor: Atlas Studios

At the Heaven One Continent’s land of extreme north.

Above the sea, there was a huge region

This place had heavy fog all year round. Furthermore, it was very strange. Even

divine sense was unable to penetrate it.

The powerhouses who entered this heavy fog had never been seen to come out

before

In the course of time, this place became a region where few people tread.

Hence, people called it the restricted area of the sea.

However, at this time, there were indistinct figures in the large fog. There was

actually an army hiding in it.

In this army, each person emitted powerful blood energy from their body.

There were two of them whose blood energies were the most exuberant!

These two people, one was called Han Guang, the other was called Chile.

They were the commanders of the army, True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

“Commander Han Guang, this large fog created by the Fog Rain Cloud

Swallowing Beast is really the best place to hide our whereabouts!” Chile said

with a laugh.

Han Guang nodded and said, “If not for this region, it’s very hard to hide our

blood energy. Wanting to launch a surprise attack would realy not be easy

Fortunately, this Fog Rain Cloud Swallowing Beast that the few lord blood

emperors killed didn’t set off any waves either.”

There are still ten days. Once Commander Lou Chuan they all arrive, we’ll be

able to launch a surprise attack! At that time, those lowly humans will

definitely get a big shock! Hahaha” Talking about how he was pleased with

himself, Chile could not refrain from letting out a loud laugh.

Han Guang also smiled and said, “Yeah, all of their energy is at the south. They

absolutely won’t think that Hegemon Bloodsky crossed worlds and came,

opening a spatial passageway at sea and launching a sudden raid from the

northernmost end! The northern cities don’t have many powerhouses. We just

have to occupy a few cities and gain a firm foothold. They will be attacked in

front and from the rear! This Heaven One Continent will be ours!”

When talking, the two people seemed very excited.

Suddenly, Han Guang’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Mn?’ Someone barged in!

Mie Chen, you bring a team of 100 and kill these humans!

“I obey!

Ahalf-step True Sovereign Heaven immediately stepped out of the ranks,

bringing 100 Saint Sovereign Heaven subordinates and entering the fog.

Eleven years had already passed since the Dao tribulation annihilated the True

Sovereign Heavens.

Ye Yuan five people arrived at the periphery of Heaven One Continent, being

even more cautious.

At that time, Ye Yuan and Yang Qing caused an uproar in the sea regions. All

the powerhouses were drawn away by the two of them.

Big Yellow, Jingfei, and Xiao Qing they all were left alone.

Ye Yuan looked at the nautical chart in his hands and said with a smile, “We’re

already very close to Heaven One Continent! After passing through this fog,

we’ll be there!

The moment Yang Qing heard, he said excitedly, “Hahaha.. A new continent!

This exalt is going to dominate this continent! Only I am invincible!

Xiao Qing fawned on him by the side. “Master is amazingly talented and will

definitely reach the top within a thousand years, dominating the continent

again

Yang Qing had a smug lookas he said, “Xiao Qing, at that time, you’ll be the

number one true spirit under my command! Ye Yuan, you’ll be the number

divine general under me!

By the side, Ye Yuan three people rolled their eyes.

Who gave these two fellows the courage?

Reckon that most of the time, Yang Qing would have to pretend to be

subservient, right?

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he said in shock and anger,

Careful!

His voice had yet to fade when a hundred figures emerged from the fog8

besieging the five people from all directions!

But Yang Qing was not fearful and said with a loud laugh, “Saint Exalt

Azuresky’s journey to hegemony will begin with you guys! Watch my spear!”

Boom!

Yang Qing and his opponent forcibly exchanged a blow, and he was actually

repelled by the other party. He could not help getting a shock.

The other party was clearly somewhat surprised too, not expecting that Yang

Qing’s strength was actually so strong

Ye Yuan was not courteous, directly blowing up a grand completion Saint

Sovereign Heaven that rushed forward with one punch!

Big Yellow, Jingfei, and Xiao Qing, each used their own means to attack the

enemy.

However, among this team of 100, the weakest was also middle Saint Sovereign

Heaven. The majority were upper Saint Sovereign Heavens.

This line-up was rather scary!

They were not at all inferior to the seafolks who hunted Ye Yuan down back

then!

At present, Jingfei already reached middle Saint Sovereign Heaven too. Coupled

with the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, her combat power was quite strong.

Big Yellow went without saying; he already reached peak upper Saint Sovereign

Heaven. He was not the slightest bit afraid when facing off against grand

completion Saint Sovereign Heavens.

However, the difference in numbers still put a lot of pressure on the three of

them.

Ye Yuan was different. His aura released, ending one with one punch!

Having transcended the six-nine Dao tribulation, the middle Saint Sovereign

Heaven Ye Yuan’s strength was already extremely terrifying.

He fought with the half-step True Sovereign Heaven Yang Qing before, beating

the other party until he howled.

Therefore, even if it wasa Great Dao Transformation grand completion Saint

Sovereign Heaven, Ye Yuan killed them very casually too.

He dealt one punch each, directly beating the other party into a cloud of blood

mist.

But very soon, Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted.

He discovered to his horror and those powerhouses who were blown apart by

him, their physical bodies actually condensed again!

Apart from their auras being slightly weaker, their strength actually did not

change much!

This shock was by no means insigmificant!

In the sea of consciousness, Mi Tian cried out in surprise, “It’s the blood race!

Why would Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven have so many members of the

blood race?

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, and he asked, “Blood race?

Mi Tian said, “The blood race is an extremely powerful race. They are powerful

and extremely aggressive! The blood race relies on devouring the blood of all

races to strengthen themselves! The most terifying thing is that the life force

of the blood race is extremely tenacious. Even if there’s still a drop of blood

left, they can also re-condense their physical bodies anew!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly from listening.

Revival from a drop of blood!

This was equivalent to a race that could not be killed!

Unless your strength was much stronger than his. Otherwise, there was no way

of killing the other party at all.

“So that’s how it is! In that case, if we want to kill them, we can only

completely obliterate them/” Ye Yuan said.

Mi Tian nodded and said, “That’s right! Wanting to kill them, there’s only one

way; we need to use absolute strength and completely wipe them out!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Understood! Yang Qjng, you hold back that

half-step True Sovereign Heaven; leave the rest to me!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Yang Qing shouted, “Fucking hurry up! These guys can’t be killed at all. I

almost can’t hold on anymore!”

Facing Mie Chen by himself, Yang Qing naturally had the strength to fight. But,

next to him, there was a large group of Saint Sovereign Heavens harassing. He

was under tremendous pressure now too.

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, Universe Sword Formation releasing grandly!

In an instant, it enveloped all of these Saint Sovereign Heavens.

“KILL!

Ye Yuan shouted coldly, the Universe Sword Fomation directly launching the

strongest attack.

Clouds of blood mist exploded with a loud bang!

After experiencing the six-nine Dao tribulation, the power of Ye Yuan’s

Universe Sword Formation directly increased a lot!

These Saint Sovereign Heavens were not opponents that could last one

exchange with him at all!

Only those transformation grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens could

barely manage to block for a few rounds.

But very soon, they were killed too.

Ye Yuan’s Universe Sword Formation directly transformed into a meat grinder!

Those blood race members that revived were also directly annihilated by Ye

Yuan.

However, the power of the Universe Sword Formation was too scattered in the

end. It was unable to completely wipe out these blood race members.

Ye Yuan did not care and continued garroting.

Toward the back, it was filled with blood mist inside the sword formation.

Over there, when Mie Chen, who was fighting fiercely with Yang Qing, saw this

scene, his pupils could not help constricting.

He thought that Yang Qing was the strongest one in this party, so his first

target was to lock onto him.

As for Ye Yuan, he did not take him seriously at all.

But only now did he know that Ye Yuan’s strength was much stronger than

even Yang Qing!
