Chapter 1482 Changing Rules

On Fan Yu’s side, the one taking the lead was called Xiu Ning.

Ye Yuan’s opponent was precisely him.

However, this Xiu Ning had witnessed Ye Yuan’s means and was clearly very apprehensive toward him.

“Brother Source Night has excellent skills; Xiu Ning admires. However, Luo Qi and Pei Lan are too weak, they can’t win Starshine. Why not you admit defeat, those eight treasures obtained, we’ll share two with you, how about it?” Xiu Ning looked at Ye Yuan and said.

Luo Qi and Pei Lan two people’s expressions both changed and they said in a solemn voice, “Xiu Ning, what’s the meaning of this?”

Xiu Ning said coolly, “Everyone is one of our own and know our own backgrounds. Even if you all rely on Brother Source Night to win us, it’s also not possible to be Starshine, their group’s match. Might as well directly admit defeat.”

Luo Qi was angered by Xiu Ning until he choked and said with a cold snort, “We can’t win, does it mean that the three of you can win?”

Xiu Ning said, “Honestly speaking, no assurance. Bu, the chances are at least greater than you three, no?”

Luo Qi and Pei Lan two people both had livid faces, extremely unwilling in their hearts

But they also knew that what Xiu Ning said was right.

With two battles, Starshine and the others, the three of their strengths were indeed not on the same level as the rest; terrifyingly stable.

“You guys can’t win. I’d better go on my own,” right then, Ye Yuan said coolly.

Xiu Ning’s expression changed, but Luo Qi and Pei Lan, two people, revealed a look of great joy.

“Begin!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Xiu Ning’s expression turned dark, an iron fist attacking with a loud bang.

The moment he attacked, it could topple mountains and overturn the seas.

This Xiu Ning’s strength was indeed not what Luo Qi and Pei Lan two people could compare to. As for that Na Qi, he was even less on the same level.

Just with Ye Yuan appraising, this Luo Qi’s strength was already not inferior to the Qin Tian back then.

In comparison, Qin Tian was incredibly weak.

After all, this Xiu Ning was just a grand completion Two-star, but Qin Tian was a half-step Origin Deity.

This Xiu Ning’s concepts comprehension were exceedingly strong. His combat experience was also extremely rich. He wore a profound divine artifact glove, a pair of iron fists were actually evenly-matched with Ye Yuan.

However, the current Ye Yuan was already no longer the Ye Yuan back then.

If he encountered Qin Tian now, he did not need to rely on other people’s strength at all. Him alone would suffice.

Qin Tian was powerful, but that was also just powerful in Wu Meng Capital City.

Among the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s same-rank martial artists, those more powerful than him were too many.

Ye Yuan had experienced the tempering of the Death Cultivation Space, fighting instincts growing with each passing day.

Xiu Ning this level did not pose any threat to him at all.

Whoosh!

The Evil Extermination Sword was akin to a phantom, arriving in front of Xiu Ning’s face.

An inch further and Xiu Ning’s life would be considered gone.

“All admit defeat, we’re all our own people. It will be unsightly if lives were lost,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The other two clearly did not expect that Xiu Ning was defeated so quickly.

They were still thinking of defeating Luo Qi and Pei Lan as quickly as possible, and then go and encircle and suppress Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan would not give them the chance at all.

At this time, the other two groups all stopped.

Ye Yuan said, “I’ll only give one chance. If you still want to continue, I won’t show mercy!”

Sensing the sharp edge at the tip of his nose, Xiu Ning broke out in cold sweat all over his body.

“I ... I admit defeat!” Xiu Ning said unwillingly.

The other two people’s faces flickered for a while, but finally still admitted defeat.

Just like this, Ye Yuan’s group entered the finals without shedding a drop of blood.

Luo Qi and Pei Lan revealed wildly elated looks on their faces. They were only a step away from those eight treasures.

How could Ye Yuan not know these two people’s expressions? It was just that he sneered coldly in his heart.

In this world, the most terrifying thing was not the enemy being powerful, but overestimating your own ability.

Although treasures were good, one also had to have the life to take it!

Ka Xin looked at this scene, the expression on his face very ugly.

He called Starshine to his side and asked softly, “I didn’t expect that this punk is a character who plays a sucker to catch a sucker! You watched his fights, so how do you feel?”

Starshine said, “In my view, this kid still held back when dealing with Xiu Ning!”

Ka Xin’s brows furrowed and he said, “Then do you have confidence in winning him?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Starshine smiled and said, “Your Highness rest assured, he held back. But how could Starshine not have held back too? Moreover, this is a three-people battle. Hu Yan and Hu Luo, the two brothers’ strengths are much stronger than those two! The last fight, we’ll definitely win!”

Hearing Starshine confident words, Ka Xin’s face finally revealed a smile and said, “Not just take the victory, but also take ... his life!”

Starshine thought about it and said, “This punk’s movement technique is extremely fast, there’s some difficulty. But ... Starshine will do my best!”

Only then did Ka Xin smile with satisfaction.

In the box-room on this side, Li Ji looked at Fan Yu with a smug look and said, “How is it? Still want to send some experts over now? Hehe ...”

Fan Yu said helplessly, “Alright, alright, you’re impressive, okay? But where did you find this lad? This person is too strong!”

Li Ji smiled and said, “Picked up by the road!”

Fan Yu rolled his eyes, but he said, “This chap’s strength is decent. He can even have a showdown with that Starshine. It’s just too bad that the other two are too weak. This last round is most likely fraught with grim possibilities.”

But Li Ji said without a care, “Being able to fight to this extent, I’m already very satisfied. The last round win or not is already of no great importance. At least, they have already gained face for the Fan Family.”

Fan Yu nodded his head, feeling that Li Ji’s words made sense too.

The City Lord Manor’s resources were far from what the other three families could compare to.

Losing to them was not unjust.

...

In the last round, both parties appeared on the stage.

Starshine grinned hideously and said, “Kid, your strength is very formidable! Why not this round, let’s fight to our heart’s content, what say you?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “In what way to our heart’s content?”

Starshine said, “Last round, let’s change the rules a bit, not allowed to take the initiative to concede! Only dying in battle and being knocked out of the ring can one walk off. What do you think?”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “I don’t have objections.”

But Luo Qi and Pei Lan’s expressions changed, clearly having the intention of withdrawing.

The fiend race being warlike did not mean that they were not afraid of death.

Clearly aware that they could not match the opponent and still want to fight to the death, they were not fools either.

According to Starshine’s rules, the battle’s danger would greatly increase.

Starshine glanced at them and said disdainfully, “If you don’t dare, just directly admit defeat! These eight treasures will belong to us! Heh heh, that Blackjade Profound Spirit Ointment, I’ve asked His Highness for a long time already and he couldn’t bear to give it to me.”

Luo Qi and Pei Lan’s expressions changed again and again. Finally, they still gritted their teeth and said, “Change then, who’s afraid of whom!”

Concerning Hu Yan and Hu Luo’s strength, they had observed from the sidelines for a long time already.

Although stronger than them, it was also not strong to the point that they could not even escape.

If they could not win, just directly exit the ring would do.

“Haha, good, gutsy enough!” Starshine laughed loudly when he heard.

But Li Ji’s expression changed. She smelled a hint of a plot and spoke up, “No way!”

But Ka Xin smiled and said, “Li Ji, their two parties, one is willing to fight, the other is willing to suffer. Let’s not intervene. Or do you have so little confidence in your own household guards and feel that they don’t even have the chance to escape?”
