Chapter 2093: Heavenly Emperor’s Strike!

“Vast Wind, you issued the heaven-rank secret order to call us here. If there isn’t anything special, you’ll need to give me an account!”

Empyrean Tian Jue looked at Empyrean Vast Wind and said those words with a cold smile on his face.

Clearly, he did not really have respect for Empyrean Vast Wind.

Empyrean Tian Jue and the two great Empyreans were slightly weaker than Empyrean Vast Wind in terms of strength. But if they really fought, Empyrean Tian Jue three people also would not be that much weaker.

Hence, even though they treated Empyrean Vast Wind as their common lord, they actually did not really have respect for him.

Empyrean Vast Wind’s two eyes narrowed, and he said coolly, “My son, Feng Tianyang, has perished. Inviting everyone here is to request for everybody to take action together and block off this hunt. After the matter is done, this Empyrean will naturally repay generously.”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed.

Feng Tianyang was known as the young generation’s number one person. Once he stepped into Empyrean in the future, he would be the extreme north’s common lord.

But now, he died?

Tian Jue and the rest were wildly elated in their hearts when they heard that. But in front of Empyrean Vast Wind, they could not express it and just said with a loud laugh, “Vast Wind, what has your son dying got to do with us? Isn’t it too rash for you to send out the heaven-rank secret order arbitrarily?”

“Vast Wind, you’re too unbridled! The heaven-rank secret order is the highest secret order that we’ve agreed upon. You actually gathered all of us here for this. What evil motives do you have?” Empyrean Mie Yu said in a cold voice.

“Humph! Vast Wind, if you don’t give us an explanation today, this matter isn’t over!” Empyrean Zhen Huang said unhappily.

While the three great supreme Empyreans dealing with Empyrean Vast Wind in unison, the other Empyreans were all silent like cicadas in winter.

The scene was already going out of control.

Many Empyreans were gloating over others’ misfortune, waiting to watch Empyrean Vast Wind’s good show.

After all, even though Empyrean Vast Wind was formidable, he was not formidable to the extent of truly unifying the extreme north.

Summoning the group of Empyreans here for his son, everyone was also rather unhappy in their hearts.

Feng Tianyang’s death was actually something that had a far-reaching impact on the Northernmost Steppe.

Concerning this point, everyone had a score in their hearts.

Empyrean Vast Wind said coolly, “You want an explanation? This Empyrean will explain for you right now.”

Done talking, Empyrean Vast Wind suddenly fired a palm out. Heaven and earth changed colors because of it.

Empyrean Zhen Huang’s face revealed a look of great alarm, hurriedly raising his palm to meet the enemy.

However, a power akin to Mount Tai crushing down from above suddenly pressed over.

This palm, he was unable to contend with it!

Empyrean Mie Yu’s two eyes narrowed and suddenly pointed a finger out too.

Crack, crack, crack ...

The wind and clouds changed, lightning flashing.

The battle between middle-stage Empyrean Realms was too earth-shaking.

Yet, under this palm of Empyrean Vast Wind, the two great Sixth Firmament Empyrean powerhouses were faltering very soon.

Empyrean Tian Jue gave a cold snort and also struck a palm out.

With three great Empyreans making a move at the same time, how shocking was the commotion?

However, what was even more shocking was Empyrean Vast Wind!

His palm seemed to have come from beyond the heavens, suppressing the world.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

Very soon, the three great Empyreans could not hold on anymore, spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood at the same time, figures flying out backward.

Empyrean Vast Wind’s one palm suppressed three great Empyreans!

“Damn it! You ... You broke through to the late-stage Empyrean Realm?” Empyrean Tian Jue looked at Vast Wind and said with a look of astonishment.

Empyrean Vast Wind said coolly, “Are you all still satisfied with this explanation?”

Empyrean Tian Jue was tongue-tied for a moment and actually did not know what to say.

Empyrean Vast Wind’s gaze swept across everyone’s faces and said coolly, “Looks like nobody has objections anymore, set off then.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Done talking, Empyrean Vast Wind stepped out and shuttled into the void.

The other Empyreans exchanged glances, but still followed him in the end.

... ...

Several tens of thousands of miles outside of Jiu Luo Ji, Empyrean Ice Cloud revealed her figure, having a hint of ridicule flashed across the corners of her mouth.

“So what if you have the Heaven Shocking Lightning? Can’t catch up to this Empyrean, everything is futile!”

Except, her voice had yet to fade when a layer of ripples emerged in space. Ye Yuan’s figure slowly stepped out.

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s words were immediately cut off.

She used a gaze like having seen a ghost and cried out in surprise, “You ... How can you be so fast?”

Ye Yuan played with the Heaven Shocking Lightning in his hand and said coolly, “You seemed to have forgotten that I know spatial law.”

Empyrean Ice Cloud naturally did not forget!

It was just that she did not think that Ye Yuan’s spatial law would actually be fearsome to such a degree.

She traversed the void with the power of Fifth Firmament Empyrean. How fast was the speed?

Originally she thought that she would be able to shake Ye Yuan off, but who knew that she would be caught up so quickly.

A True God Realm could actually rely on spatial law to catch up to a Fifth Firmament Empyrean, what kind of shocking thing was this?

“You ... Just how will you be willing to let me off!”

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s complexion was ashen, looking at Ye Yuan with a terrified look.

“Let you off? Huhu, you’re probably thinking too much, you must die today!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

“You ... Are you mad? Your Heaven Shocking Lightning, there’s even a possibility of killing a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, but you’re actually using it to kill me? This kind of precious treasure is a treasure that can fortify destiny regardless of which faction it’s placed in! You’re actually wasting it like this!” Empyrean Ice Cloud cried out at the top of her voice in shock.

“So what? In my view, there’s only willing or not willing, not about it’s worth.” Ye Yuan still remained unmoved.

“You! You lunatic! Do you know once you use the Heaven Shocking Lightning to kill me, Empyrean Windlike absolutely won’t let you off! Also, that Empyrean Vast Wind, he regards this son dearly! Right now, he’s probably already on the way here. If you have the Heaven Shocking Lightning, they will absolutely be incomparably apprehensive. But, if you use it to kill me, you won’t have a reliance anymore!” Empyrean Ice Cloud’s eyes swiveled around, trying to persuade Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan said coolly, “That doesn’t need you to worry over. You also don’t need to harbor thoughts of getting lucky anymore. No matter how what, you also can’t escape death today!”

Facing Ye Yuan who was impervious to all reason, Empyrean Ice Cloud completely broke down.

She no longer had any thoughts of leaving things to luck, her figure moving and shuttling into the void, attempting to escape.

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly, right hand pushing lightly, lightly pressing the Heaven Shocking Lightning into the void.

Using spatial law in front of Ye Yuan, even if it was Empyrean Ice Cloud, it was also showing off in front of an expert!

It was only to see a horrifying to the extreme power burst out from within the void.

A blinding light could be seen distinctly even from more than a hundred thousand miles away.

At this time, it was as if there was only that area of pale-yellow light left in the world.

Rumble!

The Empyreans who were far away at Jiu Luo Ji currently had ashen pale faces.

That horrifying energy undulation was seemingly like the sound of thunder, exploding in their ears, being clear and distinguishable!

They were all very clear that this energy was released more than a hundred thousand miles away.

If released in this Jiu Luo Ji, the entire Jiu Luo Ji would probably be razed to the ground instantly!

An Empyrean powerhouse said falteringly, “This ... This is the strike of a heavenly emperor? R-Really too horrifying! Saying that it has the power to destroy the world is also not overboard!”

Currently, the group of Empyreans exchanged glances, and they actually felt somewhat grateful toward Empyrean Ice Cloud.

If she did not run away, Ye Yuan would likely have directly obliterated Jiu Luo Ji at this time!
