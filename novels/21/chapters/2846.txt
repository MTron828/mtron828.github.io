Chapter 2852 Entering Profound Grade, Extreme Medicine is Shocked!

“I lost!”

A grade six heavenly alchemist said dejectedly.

In the next second, the whole audience was shocked!

“This is already the 18th consecutive win! Goodness gracious, this Lu Daoyi is going to defy the heavens!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Grade six heavenly alchemists are almost being swept away by him! His impressiveness really wasn’t bragged about! Maybe he can really catch up to Ancestor Pinespring’s footsteps!”

“It’s pretty close! Emperor Qin Shan really took in a fine disciple!”

“Speaking of which, Emperor Qin Shan is on par with Emperor Zuo Chen to begin with. But now, the gap is widened! These two disciples are really, one is in the sky and the other on the ground!”

..

.

.

.

For half a month in a row, Lu Daoyi won 18 matches in a row, shocking the entire sect.

Leaving seclusion this time, Lu Daoyi was domineering to the extreme, and he really fought all over the Extreme Medicine Sect and was unrivaled!

These 18 people were all existences who rose above the masses among grade six heavenly alchemists.

Lu Daoyi being able to win all the battles, he was definitely powerful to the extreme.

Even when compared to the Zhou Pinespring back then, it was not far off too.

Back then, Zhou Pinespring truly swept across grade six when he was at peak grade five.

In contrast, Emperor Qin Shan’s old adversary, Emperor Zuo Chen’s disciple Ye Yuan, was really far too lacking.

A mother relied on her son to be noble, while a master relied on his disciple to be noble[1]!

If one could bring up a Hegemon Realm powerhouse, that would absolutely be infinitely glorious.

“Hey, did you guys hear? That newly accepted disciple of Martial Uncle Zuo Chen, Ye Yuan, entered the Scripture Library and made public that he’s going to break through to profound grade! Martial Uncle Fan Li urged him with good intentions, and he even shot Martial Uncle Fan Li down. It’s really making me die of laughter!”

“There’s still such a thing? Hahaha, the disciples under Martial Uncle Zuo Chen’s tutelage when compared to Martial Uncle Qin Shan has always been a notch stronger. If not for Senior Apprentice Brother Meng Yutian death in battle, their lineage would firmly suppress Qin Shan’s lineage. But now, they really completely lost face all the way to their grandmother’s home!”

“Isn’t that so! When that Ye Yuan entered the Scripture Library, he went straight up to the sixth level. That’s absolutely max posturing points! Grade five heavenly alchemist stepping into profound grade realm, if it can really be done, that will really shock the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

“Hahaha, how hilarious! That boy is also an interesting one!”

……

Talking about Ye Yuan, everyone burst into laughter.

Because of Qin Shan and Zuo Chen’s relationship, Lu Daoyi would naturally be used as a comparison too.

Not comparing was still fine, but upon comparison, the difference was really too big.

One was like the sun in the sky, being incomparably dazzling. The other was like the dust beneath one’s feet, being bleak and dim.

Especially Ye Yuan’s personality, it was what made people denounce the most.

Puffing himself up at his own cost and reveling in it, he became everyone’s laughingstock.

In this whole world, most likely apart from himself, there was no one with this sense of superiority anymore. “Tomorrow, I’ll challenge Senior Apprentice Brother Wang Ji! At that time, all senior apprentice brothers please show up and support!” Lu Daoyi surveyed the surroundings and said loudly.

With this, it shocked everyone even more.

“He’s actually going to challenge Wang Ji!” “Impressive! Wang Ji is Ancestor Pei Zhen’s disciple, he can definitely rank among the top ten in grade six!”

“It looks like Lu Daoyi still has strength to spare! With this, there will really be a good show to watch!”

Previously, who Lu Daoyi challenged were all the disciples of grade eight heavenly alchemists.

But some grade nine heavenly alchemists similarly had grade six disciples! Of course, the eyesights of grade nine heavenly alchemists were pickier. The grade six disciples that they took in were naturally stronger.

Wang Ji was one of them!

Lu Daoyi’s challenges set off bigger and bigger waves in the sect. Even some veteran Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses have already started to pay attention.

Once the strength that Lu Daoyi displayed reached a certain level, Qin Shan this small household naturally would not be able to accommodate him anymore.

At that time, those grade nine heavenly alchemists would be moved too.

… …

Regarding the outside world’s disturbances, Ye Yuan was completely clueless.

These few days, he had been immersing in the sea of Alchemy Dao all along, unable to extricate himself.

The Extreme Medicine Sect was well-deserving of being the number one alchemy sect. The records on the sixth level were truly incomparably vast.

Compared to that incomplete Labyrinth Divine Palace, the alchemy records here were clearly more comprehensive and more complete. Furthermore, countless profound grade powerhouses had appeared in the Extreme Medicine Sect’s history before.

Their handwritten notes were also stored in the Scripture Library.

These were valuable assets!

Ye Yuan could even distinctly feel that he was getting closer and closer to the realm of profound grade. It was just that all of his seriousness was pretending to be profound in other people’s eyes. Either way, profound grade could not be broken through to in a day or two, just you pretend, see when you can pretend until! “Senior Apprentice Brother, I heard that you got shot down by a junior recently and didn’t even dare to let out a fart?”

The one talking was Fan Li’s junior apprentice brother, Miao Chuan, and he was also Song Qingyang’s junior apprentice brother.

He was closer to Fan Li. Hearing that he got deflated, he specially came to see him.

Fan Li’s face was black as the bottom of a pot, and he said in a solemn voice, “The juniors now don’t know how to appreciate kindness too much! I saw that his strength was meager, and so I asked him to consolidate his foundation and take care not to reach beyond his grasp! In the end, he used the Law Enforcement Hall to pressure me! Huhu, I’m currently really looking forward to how he breaks through to profound grade!” Miao Chuan smiled and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother, rest assured. After this boy comes out, this junior apprentice brother will definitely give vent to your anger! There’s no trouble that my Law Enforcement Hall can’t look for!”

Miao Chuan was the Law Enforcement Hall’s great protector. His strength naturally could not be underestimated.

The Law Enforcement Hall’s view was fairness!

No matter who it implicated, it would take an impartial approach to all.

But the Law Enforcement Hall’s authority was also immense. If they really wanted to use the sect rules to find trouble, not many could escape it.

Fan Li nodded and said, “I’ll leave this matter to you! Senior Apprentice Brother, I, have lived to this ripe old age. Yet, I’ve really never seen such an arrogant junior before! A mere grade five heavenly alchemist wants to step into the realm of profound grade too! If he really breaks through, I’ll smack my mouth into shambles!” His voice had yet to fade when Fan Li and Miao Chuan’s expressions suddenly changed.

Inside the Scripture Library, a profound and inscrutable undulation quietly descended.

“This … Did someone break through to profound grade? It wouldn’t be … that boy, right?” Miao Chuan said.

“Impossible! This is definitely someone else breaking through. Right now on the sixth level, there are several who are stuck at the bottleneck of profound grade!” Fan Li denied it right away.

Grade five heavenly alchemist reaching profound grade, how was this possible? Didn’t that mean that Ye Yuan was even more monstrous than Ancestor Pinespring?

It was absolutely impossible for this kind of thing to happen!

The two people’s figures appeared on the sixth floor at the first moment!

In the next moment, the two people’s expressions were indescribably wondrous! “It … It’s really him! This … How is this possible? Grade five realm breaking through to profound grade? This boy is truly so monstrous?” Fan Li asked a series of questions to hide his current shock. But it could not be hidden.

This scene was seriously too shocking!

The entire Scripture Library was in an uproar!

“He really broke through! It turns out that he wasn’t boasting. He’s really amazing!” “Grade five realm breaking through to profound grade, he’s even more monstrous than Ancestor Pinespring!”

“We ridiculed him for half a month. After so long, we’re the dumbest ones!”
