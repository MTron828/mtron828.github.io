Chapter 1864: Killing People on the Spot

No need for him to remind, everyone saw it.

Not far ahead, an oasis actually appeared.

In the center of the oasis was an island. There was a stone table on the island and a box was placed on the stone table.

“Vermilion Bird true blood! It must be the Vermilion Bird true blood!”

Everyone went berserk. How could they still care about other things, rushing over toward the oasis like crazy. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“The Vermilion Bird true blood is mine! Nobody is to snatch it!”

“Kill!”

“All scram further away for Your Father!”

...

The scene that was originally still peaceful instantly lost control.

The martial artists were all beside themselves with frenzy, fighting for that box.

But very soon, those Celestial Deity Realm martial artists discovered to their dismay that that box was already being taken over by more than a dozen powerhouses. They could not go up at all.

These dozen over powerhouses were all True God Realm powerhouses.

Even though they suppressed their realms at the Celestial Deity Realm, their strength was not what ordinary Celestial Deity Realms could compare to.

Their law comprehensions were much stronger than Celestial Deity Realm martial artists, not on the same level at all.

Around the stone table, laid dead bodies that covered the ground.

Ye Yuan and Leng Qiuling did not move. Seeing this situation, Leng Qiuling’s expression dimmed, and she said, “Sure enough, this kind of lucky chance can only belong to True God Realms.”

Ye Yuan said smiling, “That might not be so.”

Leng Qiuling’s beautiful eyes lit up and she said, “What does that mean?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’ll know in a while. But before this, we still have to settle some scores.”

Among the Celestial Deity Realm martial artists, Zhuo Han’s gaze suddenly turned sharp.

He discovered that Ye Yuan was actually walking over to his side!

Could it be that he discovered me? Impossible! We have been very careful along the way, it’s impossible that he found out! Zhuo Han thought in his heart.

At this time, Ji Xun was currently among those dozen over powerhouses in order to fight for the Vermilion Bird true blood and did not have time to care about Zhuo Han at all.

Things did not develop according to Zhuo Han’s thoughts, Ye Yuan came closer and closer.

“Huhu, want to kill people, then hide your killing intent a little better. With Ji Xun around, you’re too reckless and unbridled!”

Ye Yuan’s voice entered Zhuo Han’s ears leisurely, shattering his last trace of hope.

Zhuo Han’s expression suddenly changed. How could he still dare to remain, his figure suddenly dashing out, scurrying over in the direction of the oasis.

“Master, save me!” Zhuo Han bellowed.

Those dozen over powerhouses were currently fighting in close quarters without rest. Ji Xun’s strength took a very huge advantage among these powerhouses and was already almost snatching the box.

Who knew that at this time, Zhuo Han suddenly dashed out.

And behind him, Ye Yuan’s figure arrived high up in the air.

The Frostcounter Sword sword in his hand, Ye Yuan’s certain-kill attack was already in the midst of unleashing.

“Ye Yuan, you dare?!” Ji Xun’s eyes turned bloodshot from anger as he roared.

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Do you think I dare or not?”

Ye Yuan’s timing of taking action was too cunning, it was precisely when Ji Xun could not take care of his front and rear at the same time

Ji Xun’s two eyes were blood-red. In the interval where he was in a daze, he was struck by another True God powerhouse with a blade.

“A Sword Crossing the Void!”

Zhuo Han’s movement technique was actually very fast, but what Ye Yuan used was greater teleportation!

No matter how fast he was, how could escape Ye Yuan’s sword?

A sword unleashing, Zhuo Han did not even have time to let out a scream and was utterly annihilated.

Heavenly Water Imperial Capital’s most promising genius disciple, perished!

At the same time, Ji Xun was also hacked out of the battle royal by a blade, suffering a great loss in vitality.

But he did not care about the injuries on his body at all. He looked at Ye Yuan as he roared angrily, “Ye Yuan brat, not killing you, I, Ji Xun, am lesser than human!”

Ye Yuan looked at Ji Xun and said coolly, “I’m afraid that you don’t have that chance anymore! I didn’t provoke the two of you master and disciple, but the two of you master and disciple wanted to doom me time and again. Heh, really take me to be kneaded out of clay?”

Those Celestial Deity Realm martial artists looked at Ye Yuan with astonished faces.

This kid, a Second Firmament Celestial Deity Realm, actually dared to provoke a True God Realm powerhouse like this, this was being tired of living!

But that sword just now indeed took their breaths away.

A peak Second Firmament Celestial Deity actually one-shotted a Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity!

Furthermore, the person Ye Yuan killed was not some nameless and unknown person, but Zhuo Han who was known as Heavenly Water Imperial Capital’s number one genius.

What in the world was this young man’s background?

“Hahahaha,

the Vermilion Bird true blood is mine!” Right at this time, that True God powerhouse who chopped Ji Xun flying with a blade previously, finally grabbed that box, and let out a wild laugh.

He charged out from the midst of more than a dozen True God powerhouses and finally got what he wished, acquiring the Vermilion Bird true blood.

Ji Xun’s gaze revealed a look of insanity, forcefully suppressing the injuries in his body, his figure suddenly disappearing!

Puchi!

That True God powerhouse was currently laughing away loudly when suddenly, his heart spurted fresh blood wildly. He actually had a hole punctured through from the back by someone with one sword.

The box in his hand was naturally snatched away by someone.

And the person who killed him was none other than precisely Ji Xun.

In an instant just now, he unleashed a secret art, stimulating the potential in his body, and finished off that True God powerhouse with one sword while he was off-guard.

After snatching the treasure, virtually without stopping in the slightest, Ji Xun’s figure turned into an afterimage, escaping out of the desert.

“Ye Yuan, when I refine the Vermilion Bird true blood, it will be the day where you meet your maker!” In the air, the words that Ji Xun left behind reverberated.

Talking about it was slow, but actually, the change just now happened in just an instant.

Only then did that group of True God powerhouses feel as if they woke up from a dream. Each and every one of them was in a crazed state, rushing after Ji Xun.

They only found the Vermilion Bird true blood after going through hardships, how could they possibly allow Ji Xun to monopolize it?

“Want to monopolize the Vermilion Bird true blood, no chance in hell!”

“Leave behind the Vermilion Bird true blood!”

...

After the group of True God powerhouses left, this slaughter finally calmed down.

Those Celestial Deity Realm martial artists looked toward Ye Yuan, pitying expressions on their faces.

Ji Xun obtaining the Vermilion Bird true blood, after refining, his strength would surely soar greatly.

He was originally a True God powerhouse already. So wouldn’t dealing with Ye Yuan be accomplished with ease after this?

Without the Vermilion Bird true blood, these people naturally had no need to stay anymore as well.

Amidst a series of sighs, these Celestial Deity Realm martial artists left the oasis.

Leng Qiuling came to Ye Yuan’s side and said with a sigh, “You were too impulsive! Killing a Zhuo Han is easy, but you thoroughly enraged Ji Xun like this. He obtained the Vermilion Bird true blood now. After refining, his strength will definitely improve further. At that time, he’ll be even harder to deal with.”

Even if Ji Xun could not employ the strength of True God Realm in this place, his realm could infinitely approach True God Realm.

Furthermore, Ji Xun’s law comprehension was exceedingly high. It was completely impossible for Celestial Deity Realm martial artists to be his match.

Provoking such a powerful enemy was clearly not a very wise thing.

Who knew that Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Ji Xun obtained the Vermilion Bird true blood? Huhu, most likely ... he’ll be disappointed.”

Leng Qiuling’s face changed when he heard that and said, “Mn? What do you mean?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The Vermilion Bird true blood is still here, so ... what Ji Xun brought away definitely isn’t the Vermilion Bird true blood.”

“Still here? This ... how is this possible?”

Even if Leng Qiuling was cold as ice, she was also surprised by Ye Yuan’s words.

Under the watchful gazes of everyone, Ji Xun clearly obtained the Vermilion Bird true blood, but Ye Yuan said that he did not obtain it!
