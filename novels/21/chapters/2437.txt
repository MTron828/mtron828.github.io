Chapter 2443: Not One Of!

“Ye Yuan, this is already not that era where you’re called Saint Azure! This is the era of Dao Ancestors! In front of Dao Ancestors, everything is in vain!”

Lin Chaotian had an imposing momentum, descending upon the world as if nobody in the world could beat him!

At this moment, almost one-tenth of the Middle Realms could feel the pressure of a Dao Ancestor.

The Heavenspan World was incomparably vast, one-tenth of the Middle Realms, the vastness of its area was virtually unimaginable.

It could be seen how terrifying Lin Chaotian’s current aura was.

The power of rules was akin to heaven’s might!

That kind of terrifying power, mortals simply could not imagine it!

When a Dao Ancestor got serious, heaven and earth changed colors!

In front of such heavenly might, the only one who could maintain composure was probably only Ye Yuan.

He looked at Lin Chaotian and said coolly, “Is that so? Since the era of Dao Ancestors was single handedly created by me, then let me single handedly end it! Lin Chaotian, I’m still not your match today, but before long, I’ll be back.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around and took a step out. With a disappearance and reappearance, he actually already arrived 100 thousand miles away!

Lin Chaotian’s rule cage actually did not have the slightest effect on Ye Yuan!

The entire Origin Enlighten Mountain Range’s cage existed only in name!

Dao Ancestors were ignored!

The expressions of the nine great Dao Ancestors changed wildly, their faces shocked to the extreme.

“This is impossible! How ... How did he do it?” Ancestor Fire’s face was close to distorted.

No one had ever dared to provoke the majesty of Dao Ancestors before.

But today, it was provoked by a fellow who just entered Deva Realm!

“Still in a daze for what? Attack together, must keep him back! This ancestor doesn’t believe that the nine of us joining hands can’t even hold a guy who just entered Deva Realm!” Lin Chaotian’s face was dark, his figure already disappearing from where he was, chasing after.

The nine great Dao Ancestors pulled themselves together and chased after right away.

Bang, bang, bang ...

The entire Origin Enlighten Mountain Range fell into chaos in an instant.

Outside the mountain pass gates, the faces of those powerhouses changed wildly one after another, each and everyone fleeing in disorder.

“Quickly go! The might of Dao Ancestors is too terrifying!”

Ye Yuan intentionally went in the opposite direction. But even so, with nine great Dao Ancestors attacking in unison, this commotion was still too terrifying.

Everyone felt that heaven and earth were shaking.

It was true shaking, like an earthquake.

Nine great power of rules erupted at the same time, triggering the power of heaven and earth. That kind of power could truly topple mountains and overturn the seas, it was unimaginable.

Under this kind of chaos, the entire space was completely disrupted.

Wanting to travel through space was totally impossible.

Nine auras that blotted out the skies and covered the earth caught up to Ye Yuan in virtually an instant, locking onto him firmly.

“Rule cage, lock!”

Nine great Dao Ancestors took action together.

Space seemed to really be frozen.

The few scattered flying birds were directly immobilized in the air, unable to even flap their wings.

However, Ye Yuan took another step out, walking out of the iron plate-like cage once again.

Ye Yuan turned back calmly and said, “Stop making futile efforts! You all can’t lock onto me! Forget that you all don’t know spatial law. Even if you cultivate spatial law to the realm of rule, you can’t keep me too!”

These words were indescribably domineering!

In this world, there was only Ye Yuan alone who could say this sentence calmly in front of nine great Dao Ancestors!

How could they know that the spatial law Ye Yuan used was already not the Heavenspan World’s spatial law, but the chaos world’s spatial law!

In the past, spacetime was in reverse chaos, Ye Yuan traveled through spacetime and returned to the previous epoch, and had an extremely deep understanding of spacetime law.

At that time, what he comprehended was his own spacetime law, and not the Heavenspan World’s spacetime law. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Hence, after he returned, he gave people an illusory feeling.

That sort of understanding did not disappear along with his return, but continued to accumulate, ferment, all the way until he broke through to Creation Realm!

After reaching the Creation Realm, Ye Yuan completely erupted!

The chaos world evolving heaven and earth, what it brought was not just the increase in strength, it also deepened his understanding of Heavenly Dao and the power of laws.

What Ye Yuan was walking, was a path that no one had ever walked before.

He did not need to imitate anyone’s tracks. What he had to walk was his own footmarks.

Even with Heavenspan World this blueprint, he also did not follow the Heavenspan World’s appearance to create another Heavenspan World.

He comprehended his own time law, his own spatial law.

And now, he could freely superimpose one or two spatial nodes of the chaos world with the Heavenspan World.

He could traverse through space at will within the range of his chaos world.

The nine great Dao Ancestors wanted to use the Heavenspan World’s rules to imprison Ye Yuan; wasn’t this a joke?

Just as Ye Yuan said, even if they comprehended spatial rule, it was also impossible to do anything to him!

And this was also precisely where Ye Yuan’s confidence for daring to come lied!

Ye Yuan had pride, but he was not stupid.

Something like walking right into a trap, he would not do it.

The entire Origin Enlighten Mountain Range was shocked.

At this very moment, Origin Enlighten Mountain Range attracted too much attention.

Everyone all thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure this time.

But who knew that even with nine great Dao Ancestors joining hands, they were still actually unable to deal with Ye Yuan!

“I’m blind! I’ve definitely gone blind! Even the power of rules is actually unable to lock onto Ye Yuan!”

“I somewhat believe Ye Yuan’s words now. The secret on him is too terrifying! No wonder even Dao Ancestors will be moved!”

“No wonder he dared to come! Even the power of rules can’t lock onto him, it’s tantamount to being in an undefeatable position!”

... ...

At this moment, virtually the entire Heavenspan World’s upper echelons were shaken.

That moment when the nine great Dao Ancestors joined forces, everyone thought that Ye Yuan was finished.

But no one thought that the final result actually had a dramatic change occur.

Dao Ancestor Life taking action was unable to keep Ye Yuan!

Following that, nine great Dao Ancestors joined hands and were still unable to keep Ye Yuan!

If talking about the most shocking thing in this world, it was absolutely not a Dao Ancestor being defeated, and also not Tian Qing coming into being.

This play today was absolutely the most, most shocking thing in the history of the Heavenspan World!

Not one of!

This matter shall be written into the annals of history!

A martial artist who just entered Deva Realm actually escaped alive under the teaming up of nine great Dao Ancestors!

Lin Chaotian’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

His gaze turned dark and he said, “Since I can’t lock you down, then this ancestor will shatter this entire region of space! This ancestor wants to see what you’ll use to resist!”

His voice had yet to fade when a terrifying wood power of rule bloomed once again.

Only to see his right foot stomp lightly, the earth shook and mountains swayed!

Rumble!

Fine spatial cracks spread out in all directions with him as the center.

The space within a radius of a million miles started collapsing!

Endless spatial storms were swept in from the spatial turbulent flows.

This was the strength of a Dao Ancestor!

It was just that he still underestimated Ye Yuan.

Without space being locked down, Ye Yuan could travel millions of miles in an instant. How could a Dao Ancestor hold him?

Hence, he had nothing to fear!

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Chaotian and said coolly, “Today’s matter, this Ye has remembered it! The day when this Ye returns, I’ll definitely settle this score properly with you all! Also, my secret, you can’t cultivate it!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure gradually faded, finally vanishing!
