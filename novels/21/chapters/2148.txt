Chapter 2152: Long Chi is a Pig!

“Long Chi is a pig!”

“Long Chi is a pig!”

“Long Chi is a pig!”

... ...

Over and over again, a loud and clear voice reverberated throughout Raindragon Stronghold. Everyone could hear it clearly.

Long Chi was very domineering in the Raindragon Stronghold, virtually rendering Long Xiyue to a mere figurehead.

No one dared to challenge his prestige at all.

Long Hao was also so arrogant under his wing.

But today, Protector Elder Long Chi actually did such a thing. It was truly embarrassing.

The dragons in the stronghold all revealed strange looks, but they also did not dare to show it too much, holding it in badly.

How keen was the perception of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses? They were all afraid of Elder Long Chi settling the scores afterward.

“This scene is really unimaginably beautiful! I never imagined in this lifetime that someone could actually make Elder Long Chi do this kind of thing. But today, it actually happened.”

“This Ye Yuan is really incredible! Entering the Dragon Eye Cave, not only did he come out alive, he broke through to the Empyrean Realm and even obtained the Heavenly Dragon Mark, becoming a Son of the Heavenly Dragon!”

“In the Raindragon Stronghold, Elder Long Chi virtually covers the sky with one hand. Ye Yuan doing so sweeps his face clear. Elder Long Chi definitely won’t let him off.”

“Forget it. With the identity of Son of the Heavenly Dragon, Ye Yuan is equivalent to having obtained a death-exemption golden token. What can Elder Long Chi do to him?”

... ...

The group of dragons discussed softly. Clearly, the impact that this scene brought to them was too intense.

A supreme Heavenly Emperor powerhouse actually said that he was a pig in front of everyone and even had to say it ten thousand times.

A dragon, being a pig.

This scene was truly incomparably bizarre.

At the top of the stone tower, Long Chi’s gaze never left Ye Yuan.

If looks could kill, Ye Yuan would have long died ten thousand times.

It was just a shame that Long Chi was also clear in his heart that he really could not do anything to Ye Yuan.

Long Xiyue was very delighted in her heart. These few years, she had been suppressed by Long Chi all along. Ye Yuan’s way of doing things today really got a brutal payback on her behalf.

Long Xiyue arrived in front of Ye Yuan and asked with a look of anticipation, “Ye Yuan, that ... You came out of the Dragon Eye Cave. Did you ...”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Long Xiaochun came out together with me. They are at the back and will arrive very quickly.”

Just as he was talking, several dozen figures appeared on the horizon. The one in the lead was lovely and adorable, a pair of horns growing on top of her head. It was precisely Long Xiaochun.

“Mother!” Long Xiaochun yelled.

Long Xiyue had a look of agitation on her face. But very soon, her expression turned cold, and she said in a solemn voice, “You still know to come back? After going back, face the wall for a hundred years. Not breaking through to Second Firmament Empyrean, you’re not allowed to come out!”

Long Xiaochun stuck her tongue out and said wittily: “Mother, don’t get angry first! Eh, isn’t that Long Chi? Long Chi ... is a pig! Hahahaha ... Did this old fellow’s age get to his head? To actually scold himself?”

Long Xiaochun was just thinking of saying something when she was drawn by Long Chi’s voice.

Long Chi’s voice was seriously too loud, even if Long Xiaochun did not want to hear, she also could not.

She did not react at first. But upon thinking carefully, wasn’t it Long Chi himself?

Why was this guy scolding himself?

Long Chi clearly heard Long Xiaochun’s unbridled laughter, his face black until it was practically turning purple.

The others had strange expressions and were even discussing softly. But no one dared to laugh in a flagrant manner.

But Long Xiaochun did not have the slightest scruple at all, she laughed very happily.

Very happily!

While angry was angry, Long Chi was also very surprised in his heart. Why did Long Xiaochun come out too?

When did the Dragon Eye Cave become so easy to come out?

“Hahaha ... is this old man an idiot or not? To actually scold himself!” By the side, Long Xun laughed loudly and said.

“Seeing this old man, Big Brother Tian, I, immediately have the confidence! Even this kind of idiot can cultivate to be a Heavenly Emperor. Big Brother Tian, I, can definitely cultivate to that level!” Long Zhaotian nodded his head solemnly, saying it very seriously.

“Heh, Big Brother Xun, I, am stronger than you, I can naturally cultivate to Heavenly Emperor Realm even more!” Long Xun said in disdain.

“Look at yourself, you’re not much better than this old man! Even if you can cultivate to Heavenly Emperor Realm, you’d also just be a notch stronger than him,” Long Zhaotian said.

“Pfft ...” Even if Ye Yuan was composed, he was also tickled by these two guys.

But when Ye Yuan saw Long Chi’s expression, he immediately felt very satisfied in his heart.

These two living treasures were finally of some use.

These two people chimed in one after another, Long Chi’s face already turned red from black, his face growing by virtually a fold, almost exploding.

Bang!

A powerful to the extreme pressure descended upon the entire Raindragon Stronghold.

“Where did the fools come from? To dare bullshit in front of this Emperor? This Emperor will kill you all with a palm!”

Long Chi had a look of thunderous rage. Once a Heavenly Emperor raged, the air seemed to have solidified.

“Goodness! Ye Yuan, save us!” The two people cried out strangely and hid behind Ye Yuan.

In the two of their hearts, Ye Yuan had long already become a god-like existence.

The mysterious power that Ye Yuan displayed in the Dragon Eye Cave had long brought the two of them into submission.

Even though Long Chi was a Heavenly Emperor, he was still much lousier in their hearts. That was why the two dared to be so unbridled.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Long Chi, what do you want to do?”

Long Chi’s imposing momentum stopped, a palm raised to midair, and did not dare to land anymore.

When Long Xun saw that Long Chi indeed did not make to make a move, he immediately plucked up his courage. Poking his head out from behind Ye Yuan, he called out, “You scold yourself and actually dare to say that others are fools, where did your courage come from? You listen to this little lord’s name, I’m Little Xun under Lord Ye Yuan’s command!”

Long Zhaotian also stretched his head out and called out in a clear voice, “Little Tian under Lord Ye Yuan’s command! Dumb old man, remember it! This little lord will definitely surpass you in the future!”

Long Chi was furious!

Even if he was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, he also felt that his two lungs were almost exploding at this time.

“Long Chi, it’s just been 200 times, there are still 8800 times, when are you planning to say until?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Long Chi gritted his teeth and said, “Consider yourself ruthless! Long Chi is a pig!”

“Long Chi is a pig!”

“Long Chi is a pig!”

Lord Heavenly Emperor could only continue.

Long Xiaochun had a look of surprise as she said, “What’s going on here?”

Long Xiyue pulled a long face and said, “You damn lass, having learned neither knowledge nor skill, to not even know about the Son of the Heavenly Dragon!”

Long Xiaochun pointed at Ye Yuan in surprise and said, “You’re talking about him?”

Long Xiyue’s face turned cold and she said in a solemn voice, “Insolence! You, lass, are becoming more and more unbridled, to actually dare be impolite toward the Son of the Heavenly Dragon!”

Long Xiaochun burst out laughing and said, “Mother, you don’t need to be so respectful toward him. In terms of seniority, he still has to call you grandaunt!”

Long Xiyue’s expression changed drastically, and she said angrily, “Damn girl, you ... do you want to anger mother to death?”

As she said, she was just about to make a move to take care of Long Xiaochun but was stopped by Ye Yuan.

“Dragon Lord, wait! What Xiaochun said ... is right.” Ye Yuan said with a look of embarrassment. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Long Xiyue was taken aback, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Does Dragon Lord have an elder brother called Long Qin?”

Long Xiyue’s entire body trembled, and she said in disbelief, “You ... You’re Big Brother’s descendant?”
