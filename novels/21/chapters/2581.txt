Chapter 2587: Poaching!

One was good-natured and lovely, full of youthful spirit. The other was old and decrepit, lifeless and apathetic.

When Wen Jingxuan stood with Lin Lan, there was a clear distinction between purity and impurity.

“Young lady, this old man is a grade two heavenly alchemist. I can’t bully you. You choose the heavenly pill. Choose the one that you’re best at,” Lin Lan said coolly.

Wen Jingxuan sneered and said, “A mere grade two heavenly alchemist, pretending in front of this young lady for what? This young lady’s grade one heavenly pills are much stronger than ordinary grade two heavenly alchemists! In a while, you’ll taste defeat!”

Lin Lan just remained silent and declined to comment.

Wen Jingxuan gave a cold snort and said, “Okay, since you let me choose, then I’ll pick the most basic Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Lan was taken aback and could not help laughing as he said, “Young lady, I advise that you’d better choose others. Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, you have no chance of winning!”

These few years, what he cultivated the most was Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

His current foundation was already very solid.

Although far worse than Ye Yuan, it was god knows how many times stronger compared to ordinary heavenly alchemists.

However, the more he was like this, the more Wen Jingxuan felt that he was afraid of being found out.

“Huhu,?you think that a grade two heavenly alchemist will definitely be stronger than a grade one heavenly alchemist? Master didn’t teach me advanced heavenly pills in these ten years, he only told me to lay down a solid foundation! And Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is precisely what I’m most proficient in! Competing high-level heavenly pills, I’m not as good as you. But, competing in the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, you’re far behind!” Wen Jingxuan said with a cold smile.

The words shocked Lin Lan until he stared dumbfoundedly.

When Wen Jingxuan saw the situation, she even thought that she had intimidated Lin Lan and said smugly, “Why? Scared?”

Lin Lan shook his head and said, “What a coincidence, my master taught me the same way too!?Mn,?looks like that old man still has some knowledge!”

When Wen Jingxuan heard that, she said in a great rage, “You’re an old man yourself, you actually dare say that my master is an old man!”

Lin Lan said, “Your master is an old man compared to my master”

“You!” Wen Jingxuan was choked badly.

On the grandstand, Ye Yuan could not help but smile, thinking to himself that Lin Lan was really much cuter now.

While Qin Shun’s face became black as the bottom of a pot.

“Just you wait! You’ll be crying in a while!”

Finished speaking, Wen Jingxuan calmed her spirit and focused her mind, and started extracting the heavenly medicines.

The moment she made a move, Lin Lan could not help being surprised.

This young lady’s strength really could not be underestimated!

If not for him having followed Ye Yuan, he would really not be this little girl’s match.

Wen Jingxuan’s refinement was like floating clouds and flowing water, natural and smooth, looking incomparably skillful. Clearly, she had real skills.

She was not blowing her own trumpet.

Even Wu Chengchao also had a look of surprise as he said, “Really didn’t expect that this little girl only used ten years time and laid her foundation down so solidly! Given time, she’ll be another grade three heavenly alchemist! Maybe, she can break through to grade four!”

Qin Shun said smugly, “Jingxuan girl’s foundation is much more solid than ordinary grade two heavenly alchemists! What’s laughable is that this punk thought that by sending a grade two heavenly alchemist out, he’ll be able to smoke his way through? Brat, you think that by having a protector token, you can treat it as a death-exemption gold token?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze landed on Wen Jingxuan but did not pay the slightest attention to Qin Shun.

Qin Shun thought that Ye Yuan would answer back sarcastically and prepared a whole bunch of words.

But now, it was so awkward!

With regards to Wen Jingxuan, Ye Yuan still quite approved of her.

This girl’s basic skill was indeed quite solid.

Furthermore, her refinement gladdened the heart and was very pleasing to the eye, without that sense of stagnation.

Clearly, this girl’s understanding of alchemy was very accurate.

Her talent was not bad!

Most of the 33 Heavens considered alchemy talent to be affinity.

But Ye Yuan never thought so.

Affinity was indeed very important, but just relying on affinity, it was just too biased.

Ye Yuan rarely had the thought of taking in disciples. But this time, he was indeed somewhat moved.

If Qin Shun knew that Ye Yuan was actually planning on poaching, who knew how he would feel.

A Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum was actually snatching disciples with him, this grade three heavenly alchemist!

Very soon, Wen Jingxuan’s Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was completed!

Through the Cloud Mount Mother Stone’s testing, it was actually as high as upper seventh grade!

When the result came out, it immediately caused a burst of exclamation.

“That’s amazing! Upper seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, the vast majority of grade two heavenly alchemists can’t reach it, right?”

“Heh,?Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill reaching fifth grade is easy. But if you want to reach upper seventh grade, most likely even many grade three heavenly alchemists can’t do it!”

“No need to compete anymore, that old man will lose for sure!”

… …

Wen Jingxuan had a look of pleasant surprise on her face.

In her rage, she performed exceptionally today and actually reached upper seventh grade!

Normally, she only reached middle seventh grade at the highest.

Furthermore, it was even very unstable.

She looked at Lin Lan with a proud look and said with a cold smile, “Old man, how is it? Do you yield?”

Lin Lan nodded and said, “To have such skill at a young age, this old man is impressed!”

Wen Jingxuan said with great joy, “That means that you admit defeat?”

But Lin Lan shook his head and said, “Before following Master, I wasn’t your match. But now, you’re not my match! Your talent is pretty good. But it’s too much of a shame to follow that old man. Do you want to follow my master?”

Wen Jingxuan was taken aback; this old man actually wanted to poach her?

Ye Yuan was stunned too and immediately laughed in spite of himself.

He did not expect that Lin Lan actually verbalize his own thoughts.

This old man was a little interesting.

“Huhu,?just you brag! If you have the ability, refine an eighth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill for me to see!” Wen Jingxuan said in a great rage.

Lin Lan nodded slightly and did not say anything further either, and he started refining.

The moment he made his move, everyone’s faces changed.

Lin Lan’s refinement technique was dreamlike and mystical, it was a little more brilliant compared to Wen Jingxuan.

The entire refinement was completed in one go!

With regards to the cultivation of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, Lin Lan was long already thoroughly familiar with it, there was no difficulty at all.

Furthermore, he was not as erratic as Wen Jingxuan.

The Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill that he refined, more than 90% of them were eighth grade!

When Lin Lan’s Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill landed on the Cloud Mount Mother Stone, everyone was dumbfounded.

Qin Shun even stood up abruptly and cried out in surprise, “U-Upper eighth grade! How is this possible?”

What did upper eighth grade mean?

It meant that Lin Lan’s attainments in the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill were even stronger than him!

This kind of thing was simply inconceivable!

A hint of surprise also flashed across in the sect master’s eyes.

It was also his first time seeing an upper eighth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!

Wen Jingxuan looked like she was battered out of her senses, not quite daring to believe everything before her eyes.

She actually lost!

Lost to an old geezer!

It was clear that this old man was an average slag with one glance, he should be a rookie among grade two heavenly alchemists.

But she lost!

Furthermore, she sensed that Lin Lan’s affinity was significantly worse than hers.

But the quality of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was greatly better than hers!

Upper seventh grade and upper eighth grade seemed to only have the difference of one grade.

But there was a distance of 108 thousand miles in the middle!

One had to know, even Qin Shun this grade three heavenly alchemist could not refine an upper eighth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill too!

Lin Lan looked at Wen Jingxuan and said coolly, “Lass, your talent is really very good, but following that old man has stifled you! Why not follow my master in the future? Your talent will be brought to play to the greatest extent!”
