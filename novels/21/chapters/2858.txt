“We’re not convinced! On what basis should we be the first batch to go to the Absolute Heaven Barrier?”

“Yeah, this matter was caused by Ye Yuan. If wanting to choose someone to go, it should also be him who goes first!”

“Just because Ye Yuan donated a bunch of jade slips, he can get special treatment?”

… …

In the Law Enforcement Hall, a group of people was rioting non-stop. Zheng Qian, Wang Lin, and the rest were shockingly in ranks.

The first batch of names headed to the Absolute Heaven Barrier had already been issued. None of those who opposed Ye Yuan could escape.

Even Qin Shan, this grade eight heavenly alchemist, was also sent to the front-lines.

Of course, it was not a coincidence. Ye Yuan did it on purpose.

These people jumped around the most. Of course he could not let them continue acting like tyrants.

However, Ye Yuan’s goal was naturally not to send them to death.

These people were all geniuses. Ye Yuan did not deny it.

Perhaps going to the front-lines could make them improve at a great pace.

It was just that the mortality rate at the front-lines was also extremely high. Qin Shan had a black face as he said in a solemn voice, “Martial Uncle Ming Tang, if you don’t give an explanation today, even if it’s defying the sect’s orders, we won’t hesitate

too!”

Ming Tang was a Law Enforcement Hall elder, an Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm mighty expert, his status being extremely high.

Ye Yuan’s name did not appear in the name list of the first batch, so these people immediately blew up!

On what basis?

Hence, they ran to the Law Enforcement Hall collectively to make a scene.

As the saying went: it was hard for the law to punish the collective. They all had this mentality. The overwhelming momentum was unstoppable, but making Ye Yuan go was a must!

Otherwise, they could not swallow this insult.

Ming Tang glanced at Qin Shan and said coolly, “Have you all made enough noise? Ye Yuan their party of five already left the sect a month ago and set off for South Qi Giant City!”

Everyone was dumbfounded!

What kind of place was South Qi Giant City?

The number one dangerous city below Absolute Heaven Barrier!

It was not that this city was very dangerous, but that this city’s casualty rate was too high!

Frighteningly high!

Why?

The Absolute Heaven Barrier blocked the blood race army. But when dividing Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven into two, how big was the Absolute Heaven Barrier?

Unimaginable!

This Absolute Heaven Barrier was like a ten thousand mile great wall. It stretched even longer and more unbroken than a ten thousand mile great wall.

However, to maintain the Absolute Heaven Barrier, Hegemon Realm powerhouses needed to expend a considerable effort too.

Simply put, the Absolute Heaven Barrier was like a large net.

The place where the Hegemon Realms were garrisoning, that was the nodal point of the large net.

The node was naturally as strong as iron.

But since it was a web, then there had to be gaps.

The war between the blood race and Heaven One unfolded in these gaps.

Incomparably cruel!

Heaven One Alliance built one giant city after another in these defensively weak places, planting a large army of countless powerhouses.

South Qi Giant City was the place with the largest loophole!

Of course, it was also the most dangerous place.

One could say that the army stationed there practically had no overlap with anyone from the first batch of army stationed there! The first generation army, from the high and mighty Emperor Realm powerhouses to Saint Sovereign Heaven army, had all died out!

One could imagine how dangerous South Qi Giant City was!

In the rear, no matter which sect it was, their complexions would change colors at the mention of South Qi Giant City.

No one was willing to go!

It was because South Qi Giant City was equivalent to death!

Not roughly equivalent!

That place was absolutely an incomparably cruel and savage battlefield.

That place was hell!

Ye Yuan actually went to South Qi Giant City?

A Saint Sovereign Heaven, no matter how amazingly talented you were, you would also be an ant in South Qi Giant City!

Lowly like an ant!

There were no geniuses there, only dead people!

Too cruel!

Was this guy mad?

Ming Tang’s gaze swept over everyone’s faces, and he said with a cold smile, “When you guys were afraid, others were already at the front-lines! This elder feels that Ye Yuan’s opinion is correct! You these people crack yourselves up to be geniuses, enjoying countless glory, but you all don’t know how cruel the front-lines are! You all won’t be able to grow up without experiencing the baptism of blood! Go on!”

With this, nobody spoke anymore!

Ye Yuan already went to South Qi Giant City What else could they say?

Where they were going to this time was Floating Light City.

Although that place was the front-lines too, it was not an absolutely dangerous place.

There were 108 cities below the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Among them, there were nine giant cities!

Cities that had the word ‘giant,’ were all brutal battlefields.

And among them, South Qi Giant City was the most dangerous!

……

“This is South Qi Giant City? Sure enough … it’s very cruel!”

Seeing the scene before his eyes, Ye Yuan could not help sighing lightly.

Clearly, this place had just experienced a great battle.

10.

The city walls that towered into the clouds, half of them were already demolished. Many high level Formation Dao masters were currently repairing the city walls.

Outside the city, several thousand dead bodies were casually thrown around, looking ghastly.

There weren’t bloodkins because they would not leave behind dead bodies.

Either die or revive.

Many Saint Sovereign Heaven soldiers were currently collecting the corpses, their eyes faintly holding tears. But their gazes were full of resoluteness.

The land outside the city took on a dark-red hue as if it had already been dyed thoroughly with blood,

This was not an adjective but a fact!

Ye Yuan already heard about it before coming that red-color dirt was the hallmark of South Qi Giant City!

This place was dyed red by fresh blood!

Ye Yuan few people did not see this great battle, but the degree of danger was clear just by thinking about it a little.

This battle must have been extremely fierce.

Ye Yuan had experienced the northern front battle, but that level of battle completely could not be mentioned in the same breath as this place. “Big Brother Ye Yuan, the blood race is so abominable! Jingfei wants to kill the enemy too, kill them all! Sniff, sniff …” Jingfei immediately burst into tears when she saw the scene before her eyes.

Too tragic!

Even the Yang Qing, who went about happy-go-lucky every day, also had a solemn and respectful face at this time.

“Ye Yuan, my blood is already burning!” Yang Qing said.

“Yeah, me too.”

As he was talking, Ye Yuan gave a deep bow to this stretch of land.

On top of the city walls, a gray-robed middle-aged man looked at the city wall that was currently being repaired, his expression being incredibly grim.

Ye Yuan noticed him very quickly because his aura was extremely strong. He was definitely an Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm mighty expert!

“Heh, kid, you’re new here, right? To dare come to South Qi Giant City, pretty gutsy!” An easy-going Saint Sovereign Heaven soldier came up to greet warmly. Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Some things ultimately need people to do. This brother, didn’t you come too?”

The moment the other party heard, he laughed loudly and said, “I like to hear this! Little Brother, you came to the right place! Our South Qi Giant City is the most soulful place! Fighting here, there are no regrets in death! I’m called Wang Yan. What are you called, Little Brother?”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “This little brother, Ye Yuan, is from the Extreme Medicine Sect.”

Wang Yan waved his hand and said, “South Qi Giant City has no sects, only brothers! Even if you were a flower in the Extreme Medicine Sect, it’s completely meaningless in this place

too.”

Ye Yuan was taken aback and said with a smile, “What Brother Wang says is right. This little brother has received the teachings!”

In a few sentences, Ye Yuan already felt the difference.

Originally, Ye Yuan thought that in such a savage battlefield, humanity was gray and without luster, especially having just experienced a great battle.

But Wang Yan seemed very relaxed, without the slightest psychological burden, talking in a jovial manner.

Ye Yuan could feel that it was not that Wang Yan was heartless, but that he had qi in his heart.

This qi was the soul of South Qi Giant City!

When people come here, they would be infected by this place very quickly and be assimilated!

“Brother Wang, who is that? His bearing is extraordinary.”

Ye Yuan pointed at the middle-aged man on top of the city walls and asked.

Wang Yan chuckled and said, “You don’t even recognize City Lord Feng Xiaotian. How do you live? That is our South Qi Giant City’s spiritual leader!”

Wang Yan’s words were filled with admiration.

Ye Yuan had some guesses long ago in his heart. It was indeed Feng Xiaotian!

This was South Qi Giant City’s tenth city lord.

The previous nine were all dead. They died in battle!

South Qi Giant City’s danger was not said for fun!

Even an Emperor Sakra Heaven expert like the city lord died over and over again!

However, Feng Xiaotian was different!

This person completely grew up in South Qi Giant City.

This was a god of war!

When he entered South Qi Giant City, he was only True Sovereign Heaven Realm.

Before this, he was unknown too.

But he grew up step by step during the battles with the blood race. His cultivation realm also advanced steadily, from True Sovereign Heaven to Emperor Cloud Heaven, then to Emperor Vast Heaven, and Emperor Sakra Heaven!

All the way until presently, he became South Qi Giant City’s city lord!

This was a true-blue god of war!

In each battle, he would lead his men in a charge, killing until the bloodkins were trembling with fear.

Under this kind of battle intensity, for him to be able to live until now and even reach the peak realm of Emperor Sakra Heaven, it was simply unimaginable. Of course, it was also precisely because of this that he already became a god of South Qi Giant City, the idol in everyone’s hearts!

Ye Yuan suddenly said, “It turns out that he’s City Lord Feng! But, looking at his appearance, he seems to be frowning heavily. Did he encounter some problem?”

Wang Yan heaved a slight sigh and said, “The blood race is getting crazier and crazier, and also increasingly stronger! This time, they even collapsed half of the city walls. The city protecting grand array is badly damaged and difficult to repair! Without the city protecting grand array, we might not be able to stop the blood race army! The few big shots are currently having a headache!”
