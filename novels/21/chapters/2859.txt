Chapter 2865 Too Inefficient!

Ye Yuan and Wang Yan were currently chatting when Feng Xiaotian suddenly shouted, “Brothers in the city, those who know Formation Dao, please gather below the southern city wall!”

“I know!”

“I know too!”

“City Lord Feng needs us. Let’s hurry up!”

……

Virtually instantaneously, those powerhouses who knew Formation Dao flooded towards the city walls one after another.

Ye Yuan witnessed what was called a hundred responses to one call.

Being able to serve Feng Xiaotian seemed to have become a kind of glory.

“I’m not going to continue talking to you any longer. I’m a grade five heavenly formation master. City Lord Feng is summoning people. I need to go!” Finished saying, Wang Yan ignored Ye Yuan and ran in haste.

This level of grand array naturally did not need grade five heavenly formation masters originally.

But now, Feng Xiaotian was clearly making a Hail Mary effort too. Ye Yuan did not hesitate and joined those heavenly formation masters too.

“Eh, Brother Ye is actually a heavenly formation master too?” When Wang Yan saw that Ye Yuan came over, he could not help being very surprised.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I know a little bit.”

Wang Yan nodded and said, “Mn, it’s a crucial moment now. Those who have money offer money, those with strength exert strength. Later, you follow me. You can ask me anything that you don’t understand.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Then I’ll have to thank Brother Wang very much.” Very soon, a thousand heavenly formation masters gathered below the southern city walls. There were grade five and grade six experts.

As for grade seven and grade eight heavenly formation masters, those already belonged to the top powerhouses. They were all repairing the grand array on the city walls.

Feng Xiaotian cupped his fists to everyone and said, “Brothers, everyone saw it too. The city wall’s city protecting grand array is badly damaged at present, almost paralyzed. The blood race is attacking us more and more frequently. In at most five days, they will make a renewed effort after failure. Without the city protecting grand array, it will be very hard for us to guard South Qi Giant City. Therefore, this Feng needs everyone’s help!” Those heavenly formation masters immediately replied, “Serving City Lord Feng is our honor!”

A hint of reluctance flashed across in Feng Xiaotian’s eyes, and he gave a deep bow to the thousand heavenly formation masters.

The cultivation realms of grade five and six heavenly formation masters were too low. There was a tremendous risk when repairing this kind of grand array that approached origin level.

A single misstep and they would be drained dry by the origin power contained in the grand array.

But at this time, Feng Xiaotian had no other choice either.

Ye Yuan could not help feeling vicissitudes of emotion. This place was really different!

Feng Xiaotian merely gave a yell, and a thousand heavenly formation masters stepped forward resolutely, without even a trace of hesitation.

This was simply unimaginable in the Extreme Medicine Sect.

This was life-threatening!

“This Feng … will be counting on everyone!” Feng Xiaotian said with a choke.

“City Lord Feng doesn’t need to be courteous. This is our responsibility!” Everyone said in unison.

Got to admit, Feng Xiaotian was very charismatic.

His every movement and action gave people an amiable and approachable feeling.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan could tell that Feng Xiaotian attached great importance to his men, and it did not seem to be hypocritical.

Very soon, there were many grade seven heavenly formation masters that came over and brought these thousand over people away.

The parts that grade five and six heavenly formation masters could repair were not many. But there was strength in numbers. Their participation would speed up the restoration of the grand array. “One grade six heavenly formation master, bring along ten grade five heavenly formation masters. The ten of you grade six heavenly formation masters follow me to assist me in repairing the grand array. Whatever I make you all do, just follow, make sure not to act on your own, understood?” A grade seven heavenly formation master arrived in front of Ye Yuan and the rest, and he directly picked out 110 people and left.

The others were the same too.

This way of division could reduce the casualties to a minimum.

“This seat has already divided this piece of grade seven heavenly formation’s formation base. The 11 of you will be in charge of this area! Remember, you have to be super careful, make sure not to make any mistakes!”

The grade six heavenly formation expert who brought Ye Yuan said respectfully, “Yes, Lord Qi Li!”

This person was called Liu Yi. He was quite successful in the aspect of formations.

With regards to Qi Li’s order, Ye Yuan did not pay attention to it. He had already started to size this majestic heaven-shocking grand array up and down!

Ye Yuan had similarly seen before many array formations with tremendous power in the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s records. His knowledge and experience could not be mentioned in the same breath as these people.

This city protecting grand array was an extremely complicated interlinked grand array. Furthermore, it touched origin realm and was only a step away from a true origin grand array.

An interlinked grand array was not what a grade nine heavenly formation master could set up. It must have been jointly produced through numerous heavenly formation masters.

This grand array was linked to the Absolute Heaven Barrier, sealing off all paths of retreat.

If the blood race wanted to breach the Absolute Heaven Barrier, there was only breaking through South Qi Giant City.

It was just that South Qi Giant City had experienced a series of fierce battles, the power of this grand array was long already less than a tenth.

After experiencing the previous battle, it was even more ruined now.

It could be seen from this how terrifying the battle before they came was. “ARGH!!”

Suddenly, a miserable cry came over, startling Ye Yuan awake.

A grade five heavenly formation master was already devoured by the grand array.

However, the others did not even turn their heads around.

It was not that they were numb, but that they had to race against time!

In South Qi Giant City, dead people were really something that was all too normal.

Sorrow this kind of emotion was the most useless.

If people died, then the debt had to be repaid in blood!

Repairing the grand array meant that they could kill more bloodkins, and they would be able to avenge everyone!

“Kid, what are you still in a daze for? In South Qi Giant City, there’s no time for you to grieve over losses! Hurry up and get to work!” Liu Yi shouted coldly at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said, “Repairing like this, forget about five days. Even if it’s 50 days, it can’t be repaired entirely at all.”

Liu Yi’s brows furrowed slightly, thinking to himself that this new kid really had a lot of crap!

The adults still did not know whether or not it could be repaired entirely. Was it your turn, a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, to speak? “That’s not something that you should worry about! You just care about repairing. There’s no need for you to worry about anything else!”

Ye Yuan still did not have the intention of taking action. He just said lightly, “These over 1000 people aren’t even enough to fill the crevices between the teeth. After the people die out, it’s impossible to finish repairing too. And the repaired grand array will still be too weak to stand up to a single hit. This way, we’re purely wasting time.”

Liu Yi exploded the moment he heard it and said with a cold smile, “Huhu, then you mean that we’re resigning ourselves to doom here? New kid, I don’t care where you’re some bullshit genius from. In South Qi Giant City, just obey orders! Are you doing it or not? If you’re not doing it, hurry up and get lost for Your Father!”

Ye Yuan did not get angry and just said coolly, “Give me an hour. I think I can repair the formation base here by myself.” What Ye Yuan was referring to was the range of these 110 people, and not their ten people range.

The array formation that these 110 heavenly formation masters were working on reached several tens of thousands.

Even if they did not sleep or rest, it simply could not be repaired without a day’s time.

Now, Ye Yuan actually shamelessly boasted that he could finish repairing in an hour by himself. Was this not a joke?

Liu Yi laughed from extreme fury and said, “Kid, I think that you’re not here to repair the grand array but here to cause trouble, right? Get lost! I don’t have the time to listen to you boast here!”

Wang Yan also did not think that Ye Yuan could boast so much. Did you freaking specifically come to South Qi Giant City to posture?

But you did not know that this place was not a place to posture at all, right?

There was only killing and obedience here!

“Ye Yuan, here isn’t the Extreme Medicine Sect! You got to judge the situation when you’re boasting, alright?” Wang Yan urged.

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “I’m not boasting. Whether or not it can be done, the outcome will be seen in an hour! Also, I hope that everyone can stop. Repairing like this will only cost lives in vain. It’s too inefficient!”

“Hah, boy, what high-sounding sentiments! These 1000 people stopping for an hour, do you know how much work is going to be delayed? Can you afford to bear this loss?”.

“Yeah, even the grade nine heavenly formation master over there, Master Zi Yang, can’t help it. Are you, a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, more impressive than him?”

“Hurry up and get lost. If you keep messing around and delaying everyone’s time, we’ll directly send you on your way!”

For a moment, everyone’s spearheads pointed at Ye Yuan.
