“Huu ... Huu ... Huu ...”

Ye Yuan’s breathing became heavier and heavier. The face-off with his other self also became more and more ability falling short of one’s desire.

These two people already had a great battle in the Death Cultivation Space for three days and nights. Even if Ye Yuan’s divine essence consumption was extremely small, he also could not quite sustain anymore at this time.

After all, his opponent was not someone else, but himself!

This opponent was too strong. In these three days, Ye Yuan virtually used all of his means once, but just could not do anything to the other party.

“Haha, why are you getting weaker and weaker? Seeing my other self so weak, it really feels shameful! So ... you go to hell!”

The other Ye Yuan had a mocking smile, the strength in his hands becoming greater and greater.

The two people were evenly matched from the beginning. Until now, Ye Yuan could only be wary of warding off blows already.

The other Ye Yuan’s moves did not deviate from Ye Yuan’s vital areas, making Ye Yuan face constant danger.

“Heh heh, in this Death Cultivation Space, my divine essence is limitless. But your divine essence will become lesser and lesser along with the consumption of battle. Your final outcome can only be death!” said the other Ye Yuan with a loud laugh.

This cloned Ye Yuan did not have the least bit of compassion for the original body.

The mission that this space gave to him was to kill the original body!

In this space, the clone body’s divine essence would continually be restored.

While Ye Yuan himself, although Ye Yuan drew the surrounding spiritual energy when fighting, the recovery speed clearly could not match up to the clone’s.

Hence, as time went on, Ye Yuan would be in greater danger!

Outside the space, Dustless paid close attention to Ye Yuan with a nervous look, clenching both fists together nervously.

He knew that Ye Yuan already arrived at an extremely dangerous juncture.

If Ye Yuan still could not find the method to defeat himself, he was bound to die inside.

Once death cultivation activated, even he was unable to stop it too.

Dustless knew that Ye Yuan encountered his greatest challenge since birth.

Because his opponent was not someone else, but himself.

This Death Cultivation Space’s terrifying aspect lied here.

Regardless of how powerful your strength was, if you did not have the determination to overcome yourself, you would never be able to walk out of here.

“Come on, Ye Yuan! Don’t disappoint this old man!”

The expression on Dustless’s face was almost twitching, displaying the tension in his heart currently.

The reason why he suggested such a dangerous cultivation method was because he knew how difficult it was for Ye Yuan to create the second level Chaos Heavenspan Canon.

If Ye Yuan was unable to surpass himself, he might never find this hint of opportunity as well.

Even if he found it, it would also be no idea how many years later.

At that time, Mu Lingxue would have long been dead.

The current Ye Yuan needed powerful strength.

He needed to seize the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone for Mu Lingxue!

Although this method was perilous, it was the most effective method to squeeze out potential.

When people faced their true self, then get pressed to the limits, they would try everything to surpass themselves, seeking a lease of life from there.

Except, people able to do it were extremely, extremely few!

Actually, this Death Cultivation Space was an incomplete product of Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove had once captured quite a number of people before to go in and experiment, in order to perfect this Death Cultivation Space.

He hoped to find a method that could squeeze out potential and also reduce the mortality rate.

Among them had Origin Deity Realm martial artists, Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, even ... Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses!

Adding them up, there were probably hundreds. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was just that the final result, not a single person came out of the death cultivation!

Those able to cultivate to the Celestial Deity Realm could be said to be one-in-ten-thousand geniuses.

But such geniuses were unable to overcome themselves too.

The danger of this cultivation method could be imagined!

When Dustless proposed this method, he was actually very conflicted in his heart too.

It was just that spending a long time with Ye Yuan, Dustless more or less received a bit of Ye Yuan’s influence.

On one hand, Ye Yuan’s talent was absolutely very terrifying.

On the other hand, Ye Yuan’s spirit of betting it all on one throw also unknowingly affected him.

Swish!

A sword edge tore apart Ye Yuan’s clothes, slicing his muscles.

Dustless’ expression changed. Ye Yuan was starting to get injured!

This was not a good sign. It showed that Ye Yuan’s divine essence reserves were already inadequate to support this battle.

However, this battle had to carry on.

Swish!

Swish!

Swish!

...

Wound after wound was torn open on Ye Yuan’s body!

“Hahaha, you’re too weak! Weaklings shouldn’t exist in this world! Give up!”

The clone’s sword hacking on the original self’s body seemed to have a bloodthirsty delight.

Ye Yuan’s divine essence became more and more drained. His physical abilities were almost reaching the limits too.

Fighting with himself, the load on the body was too great!

The current Ye Yuan felt like he almost could not raise his sword anymore.

“So tired ... Could it be that ... this is the end?” Inside Ye Yuan’s mind, this voice kept on echoing.

...

“Immediately go and call Ye Yuan, no matter what he’s doing right now! After two hours, if I don’t see the person, you all ... will bear the consequences yourself!”

In the White Night Sacred Palace’s great hall, Azurepeak sat on the palace lord’s position, his face sullen.

This White Night Sacred Palace’s grand elder had such haughty airs. He, this divine envoy, descended, and he was actually in closed-seclusion!

Bai Chen’s expression changed and he said, “Lord Divine Envoy, Grand Elder he just went into a retreat not long. At this time, he’s probably at a critical juncture in cultivation. Telling him to exit seclusion at this time probably isn’t appropriate, right? Why not ... Lord Divine Envoy, stay in the White Night Sacred Palace for some time first. When Grand Elder leaves seclusion, Bai Chen will definitely notify Your Excellency right away, alright?”

Bang!

Bai Chen’s voice had yet to fade when Azurepeak gave a palm with a wave of a hand, directly striking him flying.

“Puhwark!”

This Azurepeak was a grand completion Heaven Glimpse Realm. How could Bai Chen’s bit of strength be enough to look at?

If not because he was the White Night Sacred Palace’s palace lord, this palm would probably directly take his life.

This Lord Divine Envoy was so arrogant!

“The divine palace’s orders, do you think that it’s a joke? This divine envoy says two hours, means it’s two hours! Could it be that ... whatever grand elder really is as the rumors say, an intruder? Mn?”

Azurepeak stared with his eyes wide. Everyone’s hearts turned cold.

The moment this unwarranted charge was put on, once ascertained, it would be an apocalyptic catastrophe!

Bai Chen struggled to crawl up, glaring at Azurepeak.

He was just about to flare up but was forcefully pressed down by Mo Yun.

But Bai Xiu came forward at this time and said to Azurepeak with clasped hands, “Lord Divine Envoy, this hearsay is absolutely a rumor! Most likely, it was intentionally cooked up by the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace, that bunch of guys. Lord Divine Envoy, please investigate! Grand Elder Ye Yuan had once taken action many times. His strength wasn’t rejected by Heavenly Dao in the slightest. It’s absolutely impossible to be an intruder!”

Azurepeak gave him a glance coldly and said, “This divine envoy is on orders from high up this time, and brought the Tianlu Shrine over. Whether or not he’s an intruder, one test and it will be known! Now, don’t make this divine envoy repeat it again. After two hours, this divine envoy wants to see him!”
