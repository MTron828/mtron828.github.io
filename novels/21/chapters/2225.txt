Chapter 2229: Fine, Give You Face!

After Jiu Shang died, Ye Yuan’s heart realm reached perfection, his thoughts flowing smooth, his strength reaching greater heights.

Presently, he was already comparable to Fifth Firmament Empyreans.

With the strength of Ye Yuan’s fleshy body, forcefully contending with a Seventh Firmament Empyrean was no problem at all.

And he did not even utilize any martial technique at all.

“Chi Jue, what are you dragging your feet for? Just a human brat, and yet you still haven’t taken care of it until now?”

“Haha, I said that you all, these corpses, only have a body full of boorish muscles and don’t have any use at all!”

“It’s also not useless, at least it can be used as a meat shield!”

At this time, another three figures arrived, encircling Ye Yuan in the middle.

These three people were shockingly all late-stage Empyrean mighty experts!

Empyrean Chi Jue snorted coldly and said, “The three of you, stop gloating over others’ misfortune here! This punk has a perfect seventh transformation golden body. His fleshly body strength is not beneath mine! Furthermore, he’s even a Seven-star Formation God. His strength isn’t to be underestimated!”

The other three people revealed shocked faces, looking toward Ye Yuan with amazement.

These three great ghost empyreans were respectively Ghost Seven, Si Chen, and Demoncloud.

They were the same as Empyrean Chi Jue. They were the four late-stage Empyrean generals under Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge’s command.

An Empyrean Demoncloud said with a cold laugh, “Perfect seventh transformation! Heh heh, looks like Old Chi, you ran into a tough nut this time! However, perfect seventh transformation is completely useless in front of my Ghost Dao Hundred Runes!”

Ye Yuan looked at the four great Empyreans and said coolly, “Looks like I have to beat you all down before you guys know pain!”

If it were before, Ye Yuan would still need to be very careful, using a scheme to rescue Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean out.

But presently, his strength already did not need to act in a secretive manner. He could just directly kill to the doorstep, neat and tidy.

Shinra Ghost Region was this kind of lawless place, where the weak were prey and the strong feasted.

Therefore, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to talk rules with them at all, directly beating them into submission.

Of course, on the account of Heavenly Emperor’s face, he would not deal a killing blow.

Otherwise, he would be fine, but Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean would be dead for sure.

“Huhu, truly a shameless boasting brat! This Empyrean will place an order for your blood in advance! Brothers, attack together!”

Empyrean Si Chen laughed coldly, the seals in his hands already started kneading.

“Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, Myriad Ghosts Devouring Hearts!”

All of a sudden, shrill screams of countless fierce ghosts suddenly sounded out, making people feel like their hearts were tearing apart as they listened to it.

The ferocious ghosts wailed shrilly as they chomped down on Ye Yuan.

“Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, Vast Sea Ghost Hands!”

Empyrean Demoncloud gave a fierce cry, an enormous ghost palm descended from the sky, directly slamming toward Ye Yuan.

“Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, Innumerable Ghost Shadows!”

Empyrean Ghost Seven cried strangely. Countless dark shadows extended out from underground, intertwining over toward Ye Yuan.

Three ghost talismans were executed. They were all Empyrean level ultimate moves, with their power being incomparably formidable.

One attacked the heart, one was a frontal clash, and one was a restraint. Coupled with Chi Jue this meat shield, the attacks of the four great Empyreans simply left no room for criticism!

“Hahaha, brat, die!” Empyrean Si Chen cried out strangely.

Facing the ghost shadows that blotted out the skies and covered the earth, Ye Yuan just lightly spat out a word!

“Immobilize!”

The air instantly solidified!

The amusement in the four great Empyreans’ eyes disappeared and what replaced it was terror.

They could not move anymore!

The shackle of Heavenly Dao froze everything.

Whatever move, whatever ghost shadows, were all frozen.

“True Sword Hollow Etch!”

Ye Yuan swung his bone sword, four streaks of sword light instantly fired out.

Boom, boom, boom, boom!

Four figures flew out backward in four directions!

Three Ghost Dao Empyreans were directly cleaved into two. But very soon, their bodies merged together. It was just much fainter.

As for Chi Jue, a large wound was opened up on his chest, a ghastly sight.

Defeating four Empyreans with one move!

The four great Empyreans looked at Ye Yuan with terrified faces, their gazes full of shock.

“Heavenly Dao True Word, controlling space! This ... This ...” Si Chen said with a look of horror.

Ye Yuan stood with his sword behind his back as he said coolly, “It’s just a warning this time. Keep forcing me and next time, you won’t be able to recover!”

This sword move, Ye Yuan already held back.

Otherwise, how could there be a possibility of them recovering?

One had to know, back then inside the Blackflame Cave, Ye Yuan annihilated hundreds of Empyreans by himself!

Now that he broke through to middle-stage Chaos Realm, would he think anything of a few guys who had not even reached Eighth Firmament?

The expressions of the four great Empyreans were very ugly. Only now did they discover what kind of a monster they faced!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan raised his head to look at the sky and said coolly, “Looking for so long, isn’t it time to show yourself? Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge!”

A figure slowly walked out of the void, looking at Ye Yuan, amazement in his eyes.

The arrival’s aura was faintly discernible; hard to grasp. It was shockingly a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

Who could this Heavenly Emperor be if not Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge?

Ye Yuan killed all the way inside and caused such a huge commotion. As a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, it was naturally impossible for him to not detect it.

It was just that he felt that the Empyreans could take care of Ye Yuan. In the end, the four great Empyreans all came out and were taken care of by Ye Yuan with one sword.

That scene just now completely astounded him. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ye Yuan could actually control space-time, making space-time freeze!

Although he was not involved earlier, he sensed that this Heavenly Dao True Word’s binding power was immensely strong. Even if it was him, it would be difficult to escape the constraints too!

Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge looked at Ye Yuan, his gaze was actually somewhat wary.

“Young man, this Heavenly Emperor doesn’t seem to have provoked you in the past. Why did you run to my Yin Huai Manor and cause such a big disturbance?” Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge used sullen anger to suppress his dread.

But Ye Yuan did not care at all and said coolly, “I’m just here to bring Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean away, but nobody was willing to talk nicely.”

Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood. You barged inside with such swagger and wanted people, who would talk nicely with you?

Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge said coldly, “If you bring him away with one word, wouldn’t this Heavenly Emperor not have any face?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Fine, I’ll give you face!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan clasped his hands at Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge and said coolly, “Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge, please raise your hand high up in mercy and let Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean go!”

Said please, but Ye Yuan’s tone did not have any intention of pleading at all.

If you were willing, you had to give.

Not willing to give, you also had to give!

The Empyreans all had strange looks on their faces. This human boy was really overbearing and so arrogant!

Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge’s expression was livid as he said in a solemn voice, “Do you really take it that this Heavenly Emperor doesn’t dare to do anything to you?”

Ye Yuan said calmly, “If I leave, you can’t keep me behind. If I want to kill people, you can’t stop it! Don’t believe it? You can give it a try!”

Finished talking, he clasped his hands again and said, “Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge, please raise your hand high up in mercy and let Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean go!”

Time Freeze coupled with spatial law, it was very easy for Ye Yuan to escape in front of a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

But wanting to stop Ye Yuan’s assassination, it was not possible unless these Empyreans hid inside Yin Huai Manor every day!

Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge gnashed his teeth in hatred, wishing to smack this guy to death with one slap.

But he really did not dare try!

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean was merely a minor character of little importance.

These Empyreans by his side were not what one Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean could compare to.

If they all died, wouldn’t he become a lone general without an army?

Even if it was a Heavenly Emperor, wanting to take in so many Empyreans was not so easy too.

Empyrean powerhouses were leviathans of a region. So how could they become other people’s subordinates so easily?
