Chapter 2858 Words Hell-Bent on Shocking People to Death!

Vintage!

It was still a vintage!

They were all vintages!

Chen Feiwen looked at one after another. He was shocked until it could not be any greater!

A small hill-like pile of vintage records!

Then would there be any that’s there to make up the numbers inside?

Chen Feiwen grabbed one inside. This was even more incredible.

He had never even heard of the name before!

However, based on the records logged in this jade slip, he could tell that it was extremely precious at a glance!

Seeing Chen Feiwen, who became increasingly more shocked, Wang Lin and the others finally could not laugh anymore.

You wouldn’t be freaking acting out a play with Ye Yuan, right?

One or two, I believe!

Three or five, I believe too!

But, don’t tell me that in this hill-like pill of jade slips, it was all filled with incredible records, right?

Suddenly, Chen Feiwen stopped his movements. Looking at Ye Yuan with a solemn face, he said, “Martial Uncle Ye, this matter is of utmost importance. It concerns the sect’s prosperity and decline. I can’t make a final decision anymore! I’ll go and report it to the sect master right away and have him make the final call!”

Finished saying, he immediately flashed away, leaving behind the dumbfounded-looking crowd.

This … already rose to the level of the sect’s prosperity and decline?

Martial Uncle, could you not exaggerate things to raise an alarm?

Just a bunch of lousy jade slips; was there a need?

A moment later, Song Qingyang came, Fan Li came, several of the sect’s big shots all came!

It was a matter of the sect’s prosperity and decline. They could not refrain from making their moves!

With regards to Ye Yuan, Song Qingyang was already speechless. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

My little ancestor, can’t you keep a lower profile?

How did things end up as some major matter that caused a great sensation in the entire sect?

Facing the look in Song Qingyang’s eyes, Ye Yuan returned a helpless look.

I didn’t want to either!

But, since someone forced me to take contribution points out, then I could only begrudgingly agree.

These things should be enough for him to do whatever he pleases in the sect after redeeming for contribution points, right?

When Song Qingyang and the others arrived at the Merit Hall, they picked up those jade slips that piled up like a small hill. The more they looked, the more solemn their expressions were, and the more shocked their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan.

Did this guy dig up all the Alchemy Dao treasures across the heavens?!

Too impressive! Each of these jade slips was worth a fortune. They could not be measured in monetary terms at all.

Of course, they were unable to be measured using contribution points too!

With these alchemy records, one could even create another Extreme Medicine Sect!

Too impressive!

Song Qingyang already could not find the words to describe Ye Yuan.

It was as if only the word ‘impressive’ could showcase Ye Yuan’s prowess.

Seeing the expressions of the group of big shots changing one after another, Wang Lin they all finally broke down.

Everyone present was curious about just how incredible these jade slips that Ye Yuan took out were!

Including Wang Lin they all!

They lost so unwillingly!

Song Qingyang put down the jade slip in his hand, spat out a turbid breath heavily, and said to Ye Yuan, “Ye Yuan, the value of these jade slips are simply incalculable! How about this? The sect won’t reward you contribution points anymore either. From now on, whatever you need, ask the sect directly! All kinds of resources that you need to cultivate, the sect will supply it limitlessly!”

The moment these words came out, the whole place was shocked! W-Was it so amazing?

This reward was too freaking amazing! What were contribution points? Those who entered the sect could not do without it!

Within the sect, everything that you did revolve around contribution points!

Regarding this point, the sect master, elders, even the Extreme Light Pavilion and Hegemon Realms were all like that!

Did the sect master need contribution points for whatever heavenly medicine he needed?

Yes!

If the sect master wanted something from the sect, then he would have to exchange for it by taking out the corresponding value! But Song Qingyang’s words meant that from today onward, Ye Yuan no longer needed to worry about contribution points!

He could take whatever he wanted!

Too crazy! Ye Yuan was only grade five realm currently!

After he stepped into Emperor Realm, or even reached Emperor Sakra Heaven in the future and needed those grade nine heavenly medicines, was it still taking whatever he pleased?

Yes!

It was because the use of these books was too great!

Song Qingyang did not doubt in the slightest that these records were able to advance the Extreme Medicine Sect’s alchemy path strength by a significant deal!

After today, all of the Emperor Realm powerhouses in the sect would probably make a headlong rush to enter the Scripture Library and borrow these records!

Their strength would advance by leaps and bounds for some time to come!

Looking at things from a broader perspective, Ye Yuan taking these alchemy records out would let the strength of the Heaven One Alliance side rise tremendously!

It would have enormous significance on the war as a whole!

Therefore, the contribution points were already impossible to measure!

And exemption from contribution points, this had probably never happened in the history of any major sect before.

In the history of the Extreme Medicine Sect, Ye Yuan was the only one!

This little martial uncle was really amazing!

How many earth-shattering major things had he already done as soon as he entered the sect?

“I agree! These records are too precious! Using it can practically make a fresh start elsewhere and create another Extreme Medicine Sect! This reward isn’t overboard!” Fan Li said with a nod.

“I have no objections either! Hurry up and arrange it. I’m going into closed-seclusion right away! With these things, I might be able to comprehend origin!” Miao Chuan was too impatient to wait. “I agree!” “I agree too!”

The few big shots present were virtually unanimous.

Then the whole place erupted into an uproar!

Crazy! Really insane!

“Did you hear it? Create another Extreme Medicine Sect! This Ye Yuan is simply incredible!”

“This guy really has tremendous fortune, to actually be able to obtain so many treasures!”

“Wang Lin they all have set the explosives on fire! With this, they blew themselves up until nothing remained!”

…

…

The whole place was in an uproar, discussing animatedly.

The scene before their eyes was seriously too shocking!

Especially Fan Li’s comments, it practically drove the Extreme Medicine Sect disciples present crazy.

This guy was insane, right!

The things that could establish a sect, you gave it to the sect just like that?

People were all selfish. The value of these things was sufficient to move them.

Starting a sect and establishing a faction, standing proudly at the apex!

Who did not want this sort of thing?

Just as everyone was inexplicably shocked, Ye Yuan waved his hands nonchalantly and said, “No need. These jade slips, I planned on donating them to the sect in the first place. It’s just that after entering the sect, I was anxious to break through to profound grade and forget to deal with them. Now, it’s great. Sect Master, I’ll use them to exchange for 54,450 contribution points. In addition, just reward me with some grade five heavenly medicines will do.”

In the next second, the whole place became dead silent!

Even Song Qingyang was stupefied on the spot too!

Was this boy crazy?

He was actually going to donate these treasures to the sect free of charge?

These were all priceless treasures. You gave them away so casually?

Although they were on the receiving side, Song Qingyang still felt that it was too rash and too improper!

Prodigal!

As for 54,450 contribution points, what the hell did that count for!

“Y-You’re not joking, right?” The corners of Song Qingyang’s mouth twitched slightly as he said.

He had already been completely defeated by this little martial uncle!

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “When I acknowledged Master Zuo Chen as my master, I told him that I’ll be giving these treasures on me to the sect. In return, I’ll get to freely browse inside the Scripture Library. Now, since I’ve already entered the Scripture Library, everything naturally don’t have to be mentioned anymore. However, I have a request. These jade slips that I donated are open to all sect disciples for free!”
