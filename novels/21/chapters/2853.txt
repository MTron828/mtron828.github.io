Chapter 2859 Most Difficult in History!

“This guy is crazy, right? That’s limitless contribution points!”

“With limitless resources, cultivation speed will advance by leaps and bounds, and he can use countless grandmist treasures to arm himself, he … actually doesn’t want it?”

“Donating so many records, it’s just for him to repay the Scripture Library’s contribution points? What a waste! However, Wang Lin and the others, their faces are also slapped resoundingly!”

……

You could say that again.

Wang Lin wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into right now.

Didn’t you say that 50 thousand contribution points were very hard to get?

I could earn 500 thousand, five million, 50 million, but I don’t want to!

I just want 50 thousand contribution points!

How is it? Does your face hurt?

Song Qingyang was speechless. This little martial uncle was too good at posturing!

However, he still shook his head and said, “No way, that way, the sect will owe you too much! This kind of treasure is astonishing!

If it was an ordinary disciple and the sect profited at his expense, then fine.

But who was Ye Yuan? Little martial uncle!

Even if you gave me, I would not dare to take it too!

Ye Yuan naturally knew what he was thinking about and said with a smile, “If Sect Master feels that you owe me too much, then I have a suggestion. I wonder if Sect Master is willing to listen to it?”

Song Qingyang nodded and said, “Say it!”

Ye Yuan said, “Now that a great enemy stands before us, if we’re still fettered by old conventions, it’s no different from committing suicide. Since our Extreme Medicine Sect is an alchemy overlord, then we should shoulder the responsibility of an alchemy overlord. I feel that some of the sect’s resources can be opened up to the entire Heaven One! Such as the Scripture Library, such as some training grounds.”

The moment these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar!

This was a big move! What a sect relied on to establish itself across the heavens were these resources.

Therefore, no matter which sect it was, they would be very stringent with these resources.

Ye Yuan could easily enter the Scripture Library, that was because his status was high enough.

For ordinary disciples, even if it was staying in the Scripture Library for a day, they would have to budget it stringently, let alone people outside of the Extreme Medicine Sect.

Now, Ye Yuan was actually going to share these resources in the Scripture Library with Heaven One Continent. This was simply insane!

Many disciples looked at Ye Yuan like looking at an idiot. Who did you think you were?

When was it your turn to come and meddle in this sort of thing?

Suddenly, a figure appeared, pointing at Ye Yuan’s nose as he scolded, “Impudent! Ye Yuan, who the hell do you think you are? How the sect operates, how can it be what you can speak recklessly about? These resources are all where our Extreme Medicine Sect’s foundation lies. Opening it up to the entire Heaven One is severing the sect’s foundation! You have malicious motives!”

This person was none other than precisely Qin Shan!

This mighty Emperor Vast Heaven expert went onto the playing field personally.

However, Ye Yuan did not know him. He just said with a strange expression, “Did you turn dumb from cultivation? If I want to sever the sect’s foundation, would I still take these things out?”

Qin Shan’s face turned black, and he said in a great rage, “Conceited brat! You have no respect for your elders and engage in wild talks here. You should be punished for your crimes!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

At this time, an Emperor Sakra Heaven sect elder suddenly spoke up, “Sect Master, this boy is too haughty, treating his elders with contempt. He should be killed!”

He was called Jiang Yuandao, a backbone figure of the conservative faction.

Ye Yuan’s words displeased him greatly too.

Not just him, Ye Yuan’s words immediately attracted the strong opposition of the conservative faction.

Immediately, the spearheads of all the Emperor Realm powerhouses pointed at Ye Yuan.

At present, the majority of the Emperor Realm powerhouses remaining in the sect belonged to the conservative faction.

Therefore, their voices of condemnation toward Ye Yuan grew higher than the previous wave. It was virtually one-sided!

Out of their mouths, Ye Yuan became a criminal who committed the most heinous crimes, and they would not be content with anything less than killing him.

Everyone felt that Ye Yuan was finished!

Incurring public wrath, Zuo Chen could not protect you too!

Although Song Qingyang and the group of upper echelons had calm faces, there were indescribable peculiarness in their hearts.

Disrespecting elders?

Your Father doesn’t even dare to be so unbridled in front of Little Martial Uncle. You guys are really awesome!

However, Ye Yuan’s words indeed had too great an implication. They had no choice but to be cautious.

It was just that with Ye Yuan’s identity, since he said this kind of words, was that the will of the ancestors?

“All shut up for me!” Song Qingyang yelled coldly. The world became quiet.

He said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, the implications of this matter are too great. This sect master can’t make the decision! But I’ll report your idea to the Extreme Light Pavilion and let the pavilion elders make a final decision!”

Ye Yuan said with clasped hands, “Then I’ll have to trouble Sect Master!”

Everyone burst into an uproar again! Were the heavens changing? The suggestion given by a Saint Sovereign Heaven was actually going to be reported to the Extreme Light Pavilion? Too crazy!

It was as if countless face-slapping sounds had sounded out in the air.

While Jiang Yuandao, Qin Shan, and the rest were staring with their mouths agape.

Sect Master and the group of big shots would actually care about a junior’s view?

Even if you donated these treasures, you could not use it to put pressure on the sect too, right?

But very soon, everyone felt relieved.

After all, having donated these treasures, Sect Master was letting Ye Yuan’s face look a little better for the time being.

Reporting to Extreme Light Pavilion?

It did not exist!

“Ye Yuan, such a good opportunity just now. It would have been great for you to exchange for an Imperial Extreme Pill too! In order to posture, you’re not even caring about your brother anymore?” Yang Qing said weakly.

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said coolly, “Imperial Extreme Pill for what? The sect’s heavenly pills are also nothing more than this. I’ll refine a better one for you and let you posture and slap faces, alright?”

Yang Qing’s eyes lit up, and he said excitedly, “Is this for real?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Of course it’s real!”

Zheng Qian sneered and said, “Huhu, what high-sounding sentiments! Who do you think you are, to actually look down on the sect’s heavenly pills! Don’t forget. You’re only grade five realm! So what if profound grade? Can you refine profound grade heavenly imperial pills? What a joke!” Wang Lin similarly said disdainfully, “Huhu, in the entire Extreme Medicine Sect, there’s only you, one heavenly alchemist! Profound grade expert, how formidable!”

Ye Yuan gave Wang Lin a glance and suddenly said with a smile, “Senior Apprentice Brother Wang, doesn’t your face hurt?”

Wang Lin was taken aback, his face really turning somewhat hot.

He was seriously too oppressed!

Targeting Ye Yuan time and again, in the end, this guy slapped his face each time!

How shameful!

“You guys can naturally mock me. However, you have to be prepared to be slapped by me!” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

These words were domineering!

Entering the sect for ten years, how many earth-shattering major things had Ye Yuan done?

Starting from the first day, Ye Yuan had already caused a great sensation. Then, each time was more impressive than the last, and each time more sensational than the last.

Until now, it was as if the entire Extreme Medicine Sect was revolving around Ye Yuan.

What right did a divergent cultivator trash have?

“What heavenly medicines did he take?” Qin Shan asked with a solemn face.

“Crane Needle Profound Tea, Five-Directional Divine Rain …” Wang Lin reported a series of heavenly medicine names, his gaze full of mockery.

Qin Shan could not help being stupefied when he heard it and said, “Infinite Comprehensive Pill?!

Wang Lin smiled and said, “Exactly so! This boy really doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Just broke through to profound grade for ten years and he dares to refine the Infinite Comprehensive Pill, which is known as the most difficult in history! Hahaha … That Yang Qing is probably going to be scammed to death by him!”

Qin Shan also could not help laughing as he said, “This boy, really … Infinite Comprehensive Pill, even if I take action, being able to refine true grade is already pushing it to the point of bursting! Where does he get the courage to dare refine this?”
