Chapter 2031: The Summit Starts

Among Qiandan Pavilion’s dozen over Empyreans, there was Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s Seven-star Alchemy God.

Yun Yi went to ask that Empyrean after the incident. The result made him unbelievably surprised.

Something that more than ten Empyreans could not accomplish, Ye Yuan only used less than two days and resolved it.

This was also to say that Ye Yuan crushed more than ten Empyrean powerhouses, Seven-star Alchemy Gods! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This kind of strength could simply use horrifying to describe.

Even at Empyrean Pilljade here, he also did not dare say that he could firmly suppress so many Empyreans.

Did this title of grandmaster still need to be doubted?

“The truth is more terrifying than the rumors? Then ... Then what kind of situation is it?” The youth surnamed Duan stammered.

Just looking at these rumors currently, Ye Yuan’s monstrousness was already shocking enough.

A result that was more terrifying than the rumors, to what degree of freakishness did Ye Yuan have to be!

Yun Yi smiled bitterly and said, “Don’t ask anymore. The Cloudpill Summit is about to begin, you’ll know very soon.”

Done talking, Yun Yi waved his hand with somewhat waned interest and took his leave.

Over these 3000 years, Yun Yi thought that he was overwhelmingly talented, standing at the apex of the Southern Border.

But it was not until he heard of Ye Yuan’s monstrousness that he suddenly discovered that his pride was not worth mentioning at all.

He was more than twice as old as Ye Yuan, but he was already standing at a height that was hard for him to reach in this lifetime.

The blow that this kind of reality dealt to him was too strong.

The most terrifying isn’t that you are stronger than me, but that no matter how hard I work, I also can’t catch up to your footsteps.

How much time did he, Yun Yi, needed to sit and debate on Dao with a group of Seven-star Alchemy Gods?

10 thousand years?

50 thousand years?

Or 100 thousand years?

He, Ye Yuan, only used less than 1500 years!

Even if he only used ten thousand years, how powerful would the Ye Yuan then be?

This sense of setback simply could not be described using words.

...

“Grandpas, could it be that ... we’re giving up just like that? Withdrawing from the Cloudpill Summit, our Zheng Family will definitely suffer a great loss in strength!”

On the way back, Zheng Buqun gnashed his teeth in hatred.

He never would have thought that that unremarkable young man actually really defeated his ancestor, making the Zheng Family fall into a situation of eternal damnation.

Zheng Qiyuan smiled coldly and said, “Giving up? How can it be possible! That brat’s deducing ability is indeed very strong, but I don’t believe that his pill refining ability is also as strong as his deducing ability! Grandpa has mucked around in the Cloudpill Summit for so many years, so how can my connections be what a little brat can compare to? This time, I want him to reveal his true colors!”

Zheng Buqun’s eyes lit up and he said in pleasant surprise, “Grandpa has a contingency plan?”

Zheng Qiyuan smiled and said, “Of course, what the path of alchemy relies on isn’t words, but thoroughly honed strength! He is only a brat who’s merely a thousand over years old. Could it be that he can compete with Seven-star Alchemy Gods that have refined pills countless times? When at the Peak Alchemy Meet, I’ll see what he has to be arrogant about!”

Zheng Buqun was overjoyed when he heard that. Ye Yuan indeed still would not have a good outcome.

Who did not know how to engage in an empty talk?

But alchemy never had shortcuts. Your comprehension ability could be very high, deducing could be very impressive, but when it came down to genuine pill refinement, only experiencing thoroughly tempering, could one have accomplishments.

Which one of them, these Seven-star Alchemy Gods, was not an old monster who had lived for hundreds of thousands, even millions of years?

The medicinal pills that they had refined before were sufficient to pile up to form a mountain!

How could a mere Ye Yuan possibly be a match?

...

Amidst the series of exclamations, the curtains of the Cloudpill Summit were finally drawn.

On this day, alchemy powerhouses gathered in Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.

Several tens of thousands of alchemists gathered together in the plaza!

These tens of thousands of alchemists were all the elites among elites of the Southern Border’s alchemy world.

Up on the high platform, a hundred Empyrean powerhouses sat up straight, imposing aura awing all those present.

This kind of grand line-up could only be seen at the Cloudpill Summit, this kind of grand occasion.

These 100 Empyrean powerhouses were all leviathans of a region, being peak Alchemy Gods.

But at this time, these Seven-star Alchemy Gods could only sit below.

On the highest part of the platform, there were still 14 seats left vacant.

Everyone knew that these 14 seats represented the highest standard of the Southern Border’s alchemy world!

Each one was a grandmaster-class alchemy powerhouse!

Suddenly, a powerful aura came out of the void.

A middle-aged man dressed in loose white robes slowly walked out, akin to a god.

Empyrean Pilljade, peak Seven-star Alchemy God, Ninth Firmament Empyrean super powerhouse.

Under Heavenly Emperor, Pilljade was revered as supreme!

Empyrean Pilljade’s gaze swept, majesty birthing on its own.

“Today, the Cloudpill Summit begins. Pilljade thanks everyone for honoring with a visit! This Empyrean knows that many people came to take part in the Cloudpill Summit aiming for the 13 grandmasters. Now, this Empyrean will invite the 13 grandmaster powerhouses who have arrived! Heavenly Soul Great Imperial Capital, Empyrean Blazing Sun!”

Empyrean Pilljade’s voice had just faded when a fire-like man stepped out of the void. Nodding his head slightly to everyone, he walked towards his seat.

“Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital, Empyrean Flutterfeather!”

The Empyrean Flutterfeather dressed in azure loose robes walked out with a slight smile and clasped his hands slightly, then walked toward his own seat.

“Cloud Tremor Great Imperial Capital, Empyrean Luoshui!”

...

Empyrean Pilljade introduced one by one. The former few were all the masters of the six great peak holy lands. Each one was an apex existence of the Southern Border.

After these six Empyreans came onto the stage, they each sat on the two flanks of the empty middle seat.

The middle-most seat belonged to Empyrean Pilljade.

After the six sovereigns took the stage, Empyrean Pilljade continued introducing.

“Empyrean Lumen, Zhuge Ancient Family’s alchemy authority!”

“Empyrean Qianyu, from the Northday’s Lu Family!”

...

Six Empyrean powerhouses were finished introducing. Suddenly, the air seemed to have solidified, the entire plaza was dead silent.

Everyone knew that this final grandmaster was this Cloudpill Summit’s main attraction.

The Cloudpill Summit had not even started yet and this grandmaster who did not even reach Empyrean already chased the Zheng Family out of the Cloudpill Summit forever.

More importantly, he was the only alchemist who became a grandmaster at Six-star Alchemy God in the history of the Cloudpill Summit!

Even Empyrean Pilljade also paused slightly before slowly opened his mouth and said, “The last one, an extraordinary talent, invited by Empyrean Flutterfeather at a thousand over years of age, becoming this Cloudpill Summit’s grandmaster! Ye Yuan, from Southridge’s Heavenly Eagle Imperial City!”

Empyrean Pilljade finished introducing, Ye Yuan’s figure slowly stepped out of the void.

Everyone’s gazes all gathered on that ridiculously young grandmaster.

“Southridge’s Heavenly Eagle Imperial City? What is that place? Never heard of it before!”

“This kind of small place could actually produce a grandmaster?”

“This Ye Yuan really has the ability to hold the position of grandmaster? Although the Zheng Family withdrew from the Cloudpill Summit, I heard that they lost a bet. Just how much strength this Ye Yuan has, nobody knows either!”

“It’s a pity that we can’t challenge grandmasters. Otherwise, testing a bit and we’ll know.”

...

Although there had long already been Ye Yuan’s legends in Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital, when they really saw Ye Yuan, everyone still could not resist sucking in a cold breath.

Too young!

This age should be standing below and taking part in the alchemy battles together with them.

But now, he sat on the grandmaster seat.

“Brother Pilljade, letting a little child whose hair isn’t even fully grown sit on a grandmaster seat, where will the faces of us, these 100 Seven-star Alchemy Gods, go?”

Ye Yuan had not taken his seat yet when a voice dripping with sarcasm sounded out.
