Chapter 2887 Taking a Risk!

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

A series of rhythmic heartbeats came from the depths of the void.

Ye Yuan’s heart seemed to be seized by something, making his entire person want to explode.

“Puhwark!”

Finally, Ye Yuan could not hold back, and a mouthful of blood sprayed out.

This power was too terrifying!

It was even more terrifying than Hegemon Cloudmount’s aura! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Was this the power of the Chaos Bloodstone?

Ye Wugui gave Ye Yuan a glance and said, “Not bad. The power of the Chaos Bloodstone is virtually irresistible below Emperor Realm. Even if you entered this stretch of nothingness, you’d directly exploded too! Your bloodline power is really very strong!”

Finished saying, he directly brought Ye Yuan and headed for the depths of the void.

That heartbeat sound became stronger and stronger. Ye Yuan’s heartbeat also became increasingly fiercer, as if it was being controlled.

Suddenly, amidst the nothingness, a blood-red giant heart entered Ye Yuan’s eyes.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted as if somebody had given him a blow.

This scene was too shocking.

That blood-red heart was red until it was seemingly going to drip blood, giving people an awe-inspiring feeling.

The first feeling Ye Yuan got when he saw it was that it was evil!

There seemed to be something extremely terrifying inoculating in this heart.

Ye Yuan did not expect that the Chaos Bloodstone was actually a heart!

Furthermore, some kind of terrifying existence seemed to be currently inoculating in this heart!

Ye Yuan had a strong sense of unease in his heart.

“Endless blood origin is contained in the Chaos Bloodstone! As long as one can obtain the recognition of the Chaos Bloodstone, advancing to Hegemon Realm will just be a matter of time,” Ye Wugui said with a smile.

Ye Yuan gave a look of ‘anticipation’ very appropriately but became alert in his heart.

This blood race was likely holding in store an enormous secret!

“Senior, have you heard of this thing before?” Ye Yuan asked Mi Tian.

Mi Tian also had a solemn look as he shook his head and said, “Unheard of! This thing is very dangerous!”

“Mn, I have this feeling too! Senior, can we … destroy it?” Ye Yuan suddenly proposed a bold idea.

Mi Tian jumped in fright and hurriedly said, “Don’t mess around! The thing inside here has already reached high attainment. It’s absolutely not what the current you can destroy! Don’t even think about it. This thing is very sensitive. You’ll die!”

Ye Yuan was startled too. His level was much worse than Mi Tian. His perception was naturally not as profound as Mi Tian’s.

Even Mi Tian was so fearful; this thing must be extraordinary.

He did not expect that coming here this time, he actually discovered the massive secret of the blood race.

The existence of the Chaos Bloodstone was absolutely top secret among the blood race’s top secrets. Only the blood race’s upper echelons had the qualifications to know.

Ye Yuan could be let in. That was because his talent was seriously too strong, sufficient to suppress an era!

“But do we wait for him to be born just like this?” Ye Yuan said.

Mi Tian said, “This isn’t where his main body lies! The Chaos Bloodstone that you see is merely a clone of his! The blood race spans the 33 Heavens. Most likely, his clones are also numerous! Want to destroy him, one must find his main body!”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, this thing was so formidable, and it was actually not even his main body?

Then how powerful was his main body?

This … was too terrifying!

Mi Tian also stared at the Chaos Bloodstone in the distance and said with a sigh, “No wonder the blood race couldn’t be eradicated from start to end. With this thing around, the blood race can’t be exterminated! And the blood race is merely his tool, that’s all! The blood race being addicted to blood, continuously sucking the blood of myriad races and strengthening their population, it’s actually strengthening the Chaos Bloodstone! One day in the future, when he breaks out of the Chaos Bloodstone, it will probably be the catastrophe of the 33 Heavens!”

Mi Tian had participated in the battle to exterminate the blood race too. At that time, he thought that the blood race was wiped out.

But who knew that several hundred thousand years later, the blood race bounced back.

In these several hundred years, the blood race had already strengthened up anew.

In just a mere Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, there were already dozens of Hegemon Realm powerhouses.

“All right. You use your blood essence and offer up as a sacrifice to the Chaos Bloodstone first. Then you’ll be able to establish a trace of connection with it and comprehend the origin of blood! Of course, how much you can comprehend, that will depend on your good fortune,” Ye Wugui said.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, a crazy idea suddenly arising in his heart.

Mi Tian sensed his idea right away!

“Boy, you’re crazy! You’re courting death!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Then if he is born, do you think that the Hegemon Realms across the heavens are his match?”

W

Mi Tian was taken aback, immediately falling silent.

This was just a measly little clone, and Mi Tian already felt a great terror.

Then just how strong was his main body?

Hegemon Realms had strong and weak ones.

Powerful Hegemon Realms, their strength was unimaginable.

But, to match up against this Chaos Bloodstone, it was likely not sufficient too.

“Hence, once he is born, I’m afraid that even the thing that the Labyrinth Divine Palace couldn’t accomplish would be achieved by the blood race! Rather than that, it’s better to take a risk once! Such an opportunity probably won’t come a second time! After the blood race comes to realize the truth that I’m a fake, it will be even harder than ascending to heaven to want to sneak in here again!” Ye Yuan said.

Mi Tian said in a solemn voice, “But, once discovered by him, you’ll be dead for sure!”

Ye Yuan said, “He didn’t discover that I’m a human, so he’s not omnipotent! I have faith in my Dao!”

Ye Yuan’s Dao was his Dao sword.

The method that he spoke of was to split off a wisp of Dao sword and hide it in the blood essence, letting the Chaos Bloodstone absorb it.

This was equivalent to planting a seed in the Chaos Bloodstone.

It was naturally impossible for the current Dao sword to destroy the Chaos Bloodstone.

But Ye Yuan was confident that there would be a chance in the future!

After his strength grew, his Dao sword would become stronger too.

At the critical moment, if Ye Yuan detonated the Dao sword and destroyed this clone in one stroke, even the main body would suffer serious damage too!

But once this Dao sword could not hide from the Chaos Bloodstone’s eyes and ears, Ye Yuan would die right away!

Ye Yuan was indeed a prodigy, but he was after all only Saint Sovereign Heaven.

It was indeed too risky to do so.

“Mn? What are you hesitating for?” Ye Wugui’s brows could not help furrowing when he saw that Ye Yuan did not move for a long time.

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said, “I’m not hesitating. It’s just that seeing the mother stone for the first time, my heart couldn’t calm down for a long time.”

Ye Wugui came to understand and said with a smile, “That’s of course! Our blood race is in perfect harmony with the mother stone. The first time you see it, it’s like returning to your mother’s womb. Having this shock is also ought to be.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan did not hesitate either, directly ‘forcing out’ a drop of blood essence, flying towards the Chaos Bloodstone.

This blood essence was naturally not Ye Yuan’s.

He only refined the Blood Imitation Pill. He still had a human’s blood in essence.

If he sent it over, he would definitely be exposed.

However, Ye Yuan’s Dao sword suppressed many bloodkins’ blood essence.

Many of their blood essences were extremely powerful.

Ye Yuan could naturally hide from Ye Wugui by splitting off a drop.

The blood essence got closer and closer to the Chaos Bloodstone, Ye Yuan’s heart rate was also accelerating.
