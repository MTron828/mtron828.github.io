Chapter 1704 Break the Legs, Throw Out!

“Blind? Pooh! Your eyes are the ones that are blind!”

Jian Yu was furious when he heard that. This guy was cursing him to go blind!

Ye Yuan was naturally not cursing him, but that Jian Yu’s aura viewing art was indeed lacking.

If it was like Jian Zhentao, as long as he look at him continuously, his eyes would definitely be blind.

It was precisely because his strength was lacking that he could not see through his actual situation, making it seemed like he had no rank.

That little girl’s father was similarly so.

Ye Yuan gave him a look and waved his hand and said, “This young master is getting my fortune told. If you want to get your fortunes told, queue up. Not getting it told, immediately get lost, don’t jump up and down here, repulsing people.”

Jian Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “Brat, you have divination done here already violated this young master’s ban! You dare to oppose my Jian Family?”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was tickled and said, “Ban? What ban is here saying that I can’t get divination done here?”

Jian Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly and he looked at that young lady and said, “Xiaoran, why don’t ... you tell him what the outcome will be?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, looking at the girlie curiously.

Ran-er seemed to be like a startled little bunny, her complexion ashen pale, giving people a feeling of unable to help showing tender care when one saw her

Seeing Ye Yuan use a probing gaze to look over, Ran-er said sobbingly, “S-Sir, sorry, it ... it was all Ran-er who harmed you! You ... You hurry up and go, otherwise ... otherwise they will break your legs! Young Master Jian Yu has warned us father and daughter, saying that if anyone has divination done here, he’ll break their legs!”

Jian Yu said with a smug look, “Heard that, kid? Don’t blame this young master. Want to blame, blame Xiaoran! Go on, break this punk’s legs for this young master!”

Over a dozen subordinates rubbed their fists and wiped their palms and surrounded over.

The surroundings, when everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them could not help revealing a look of reluctance.

“Sigh, this kid is also unlucky, to actually provoke Jian Yu this great demon king.”

“Xiaoran this lass also has a bitter fate. Their father and daughter duo are being forced into a dead-end!”

“Who asked Jian Yu this great demon king to unwittingly take fancy on Xiaoran this lass? What sin have they committed?!”

...

Clearly, everyone was very apprehensive of this Jian Yu.

Right at this time, a figure suddenly dashed out, flying straight for Jian Yu!

“Jian Yu, I, Zhang Haotian, will fight it out with you! Even if I die, I also won’t give Xiaoran to you!”

This was extremely sudden. Everyone did not react to it, but it gave Jian Yu a big fright.

Bang!

Suddenly, a figure blocked in front of Jian Yu, sending Zhang Haotian flying with one punch.

Zhang Haotian collapsed on the ground, fresh blood spewing wildly without ceasing.

Zhang Haotian was merely a second-layered heaven Divine Lord, one leg was even crippled.

Jian Yu’s subordinate was also first-layered heaven Divine Lord at the very least. So how could Zhang Haotian be a match?

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, his brows could not help furrowing slightly.

The ins and outs of the matter, he had also roughly figured it out.

This Jian Yu took fancy of Zhang Xiaoran’s looks and wanted to have her for himself. But Zhang Haotian and Zhang Xiaoran did not agree.

Hence, even though Jian Yu forbade them father and daughter from setting up a stall, he did not make things difficult for them either. He came up with a lousy rule of beating anyone who came to get a divination.

When this father and daughter two people had no livelihood, they would naturally give in obediently.

Zhang Xiaoran was naturally unresigned to it. So taking the chance when Jian Yu was not around, she pulled Ye Yuan over to get his fortunes told.

She did not know that Jian Yu dispatched informants around them. The moment Ye Yuan sat down, he knew.

The baffled looking Ye Yuan was swept into this farce without rhyme or reason just like this.

“Zhang Haotian, you’re courting death! You all, break this kid’s legs for me first, then carry them father and daughter away for me!” Jian Yu said in a great rage.

“Yes!” The bunch of subordinates received the orders and rushed over towards Ye Yuan glaring like ravening tigers. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Tianping, cripple all of them for me and throw them out!”

“Yes, my lord!”

Ning Tianping answered, suddenly releasing the aura of a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord. Everyone’s faces changed.

When Ye Yuan entered the city, he did not want to be too ostentatious, so he had Ning Tianping restrain his aura.

Jian Yu also saw that Ning Tianping’s strength was not strong, that was why he was so arrogant.

How could he have thought that Ning Tianping was actually a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord already at a young age!

These few years, Ning Tianping’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds following by Ye Yuan’s side. He had long broken through to become a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

The moment he made his move, how could these initial-stage Divine Lord Realm family guards be his match?

It was only to hear miserable screams linger on incessantly. The entire street instantly became a chaotic mess.

Ning Tianping did not kill people either. It was just that each person had their legs broken by him.

These family guards lay on the ground, wailing without ceasing.

The surrounding onlookers were all dumbfounded with shock.

“What background does this young man have? To actually bring alone a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord as his follower!”

“It’s really funny, this young man’s destiny doesn’t even enter the ranks and is simply a trash. But there’s actually a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord following by his side!”

“Probably he himself and his family clan doesn’t know at all, right? Coming to Extreme Light Imperial City this time, his true colors will probably be revealed.”

...

At the same time, they were marveling at Ning Tianping’s strength. Those stall owners also became curious about Ye Yuan’s identity.

Quite a few people secretly mustered up divine essence, observing Ye Yuan’s destiny, and discovered that it was indeed a dried-up well without ripples; unable to even stir up a hint of a wave.

Unranked!

“Your Excellency, what to do with this guy?” Ning Tianping asked very calmly.

Jian Yu’s face had long turned white. He completely did not expect that he actually kicked a metal plate this time!

“You dare to touch this young master? This young master is a member of the Jian Family! If you touch me, that’s climbing on top of the Jian Family’s heads! You have to think about the consequences!” Although Jian Yu was afraid, at the thought of the Jian Family’s strength, his back immediately straightened up.

Sure enough, the moment Ning Tianping heard, he immediately revealed a look of hesitation.

They came to seek help from the Jian Family this time. If they offended the Jian Family, it would not be easy to clean up the mess.

Jian Yu observed his expression and words, and immediately said to Ning Tianping smugly, “Kid, your strength is pretty good, sticking with this young master in the future is definitely much more promising than that good-for-nothing! I’ll tell you very responsibly, that kid is simply a trash who can’t enter the ranks!”

When Ning Tianping heard that, his face revealed a strange look.

If His Excellency was trash, then all in this world was waste residue.

He laughed in spite of himself and said, “Fool, your aura viewing art is really lacking! Wait till you cultivate it entirely and then come and look at His Excellency again. You’ll know why he said that your eyes didn’t go blind!”

At this time, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Still waiting for what? Break his legs and throw him out! Being noisy in this place!”

Jian Yu’s expression changed greatly when he heard that and said, “You ... You really dare to make a move? You ... You have to think of the consequences well! Those who touch my Jian Family’s members all don’t have a good outcome!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Just your bit of strength is also fit to represent the Jian Family? Then the Jian Family really doesn’t have anyone anymore! Tianping, do it!”

“Yes, my lord!”

With Ye Yuan’s order, Ning Tianping no longer hesitated, directly sweeping over and breaking Jian Yu’s two legs in no time flat.

“Argh! Brat, you’ll regret it! Ahh!” On the street, came Jian Yu’s shrill and miserable screams.
