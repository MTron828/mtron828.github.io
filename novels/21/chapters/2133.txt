Chapter 2137: Big Brother Xun Will Protect You

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Inside the dark dense woods, several figures crisscrossed, the battle situation very intense.

A white figure passed through between more than a dozen black monsters. The situation was alarmingly dangerous.

However, that white figure was extremely nimble. No matter how dangerous the situation, he could always turn danger into safety in the end.

This white-clothed youth was precisely Ye Yuan.

Currently, close to a year’s time already passed since Ye Yuan entered the Dragon Eye Cave.

Ye Yuan’s aura was much stronger compared to when he just came in.

In this one year, Ye Yuan hunted several thousand rank six abyss monsters, obtaining large amounts of black crystals.

Of course, how could one not wet their shoes if they frequently walked by the roadside? Ye Yuan naturally encountered Empyrean Realm abyss monsters before too.

But Ye Yuan was long prepared. He had long laid down the spatial node technique. The moment he ran into Empyrean Realm abyss monsters, he would immediately run.

Therefore, although the abyss monsters here were strong, Ye Yuan’s survival ability was stronger.

Up until now, Ye Yuan did not encounter real danger either.

“True Sword Hollow Etch!”

A roar came over, noiseless sword energy instantly erupted with horrifying energy. Three black abyss monsters were directly blown up.

“Roar, roar!”

The remaining abyss monsters seemed to have become enraged, pouncing toward Ye Yuan crazily.

“Humph! You brutes really have no idea of death or danger! Grand Universe Palm!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and suddenly fired a palm out.

The dragon pranced the vast expanse of open ground, roaming the nine heavens unhindered.

Four to five abyss monsters were directly blown up!

“Roar, roar, roar!”

The remaining abyss monsters became even more furious, one ball of horrifying energy undulations after another exploded by Ye Yuan’s side.

“True Sword Hollow Etch!”

With another noiseless sword energy, Ye Yuan reaped the lives of the abyss monsters without any mercy.

Battling for a day a night, Ye Yuan finally annihilated all of these abyss monsters.

“Huu ... This batch of guys are really formidable, even if a Ninth Firmament True God was here, they would probably be blown up in one move by them too,” Ye Yuan huffed a turbid breath as he spoke.

The strength of this batch of abyss monsters, all of them were above Eighth Firmament True God Realm.

But their combat strength was extremely horrifying. Human Ninth Firmament True Gods were not their match at all.

Ye Yuan’s present strength already infinitely approached an Eighth Firmament True God. Coupled with his fleshy body’s strength, he had virtually no opponents under Empyrean.

But even so, with his strength, he also expended tremendous effort before slaying them.

Ye Yuan packed up all of the black crystals and said with a smile, “Heh, this batch of abyss monsters are strong, but the black crystals are also purer and stronger. With this batch of black crystals, I should be able to break through to Eighth Firmament Origin Pill!”

In this one year, Ye Yuan completely treated the Dragon Eye Cave as a cultivation treasure land.

As long as he saw rank six abyss monsters, Ye Yuan’s two eyes would definitely shine, killing them.

If Long Chi was here, he would definitely be angered until he vomited blood.

His method that he thought of as brilliant became Ye Yuan’s wedding gown.

But in this one year, Ye Yuan also figured out some of the Dragon Eye Cave world’s rules.

Which place was dangerous, which place was safe, which place had powerful abyss monsters coming and going, he had an idea in his heart.

As long as he did not overshoot this boundary, there was no great danger.

This dense forest at present belonged to a more dangerous place. There were many late-stage True God Realm abyss monsters coming and going.

Following the increase in Ye Yuan’s strength, the initial-region’s abyss monsters already did not pose any challenge to him.

Finding a secluded place, Ye Yuan laid down a bunch of protective array formations and started refining the black crystals.

When the devilish energy entered the body, Ye Yuan’s realm started loosening up.

Several days later, Ye Yuan’s aura skyrocketed, finally stepping into Eighth Firmament Origin Pill.

“Breaking through is getting harder and harder!” Slowly opening both eyes, Ye Yuan could not help saying with an emotional sigh.

“But the price paid is still worth it! Right now, even though I’m at the Eighth Firmament Origin Pill, in terms of divine essence thickness, I’m probably even stronger than ordinary Ninth Firmament True Gods! Putting aside True God Realms, even when facing Empyrean Realms, it’s at least also not without the slightest strength to fight back anymore. After breaking through to the Ninth Firmament Origin Pill, when I unleash all of my means, even facing a First Firmament Empyrean shouldn’t be anything difficult too!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s gaze became sharp and he said in a solemn voice, “Li-er, after I breakthrough the next realm, I’ll fetch you back home! Lin Changqing, 2000 years hasn’t arrived. But I wonder how gifted your so-called genius is!”

It was already close to a thousand years in a twinkle, Ye Yuan’s longing for Li-er did not stop for a second.

And Lin Changqing’s overbearingness was also fresh in Ye Yuan’s mind.

That Lin Changqing cracked himself up to be a genius that felt that Ye Yuan was like an ant.

At that time, Ye Yuan just entered the Celestial Deity Realm, but Lin Changqing was already an Empyrean.

But a thousand years passed, Ye Yuan was already a dragon flying in the sky and only a step away from Empyrean.

What realm did he, Lin Changqing, cultivate to?

The Sea of Law the last time, as well as clearing Ask Not, both brought tremendous inspirations to Ye Yuan, with the outcome being extremely far-reaching.

Regarding the next realm, Ye Yuan already had a general idea in his mind.

Ye Yuan had a feeling that the next realm would be greatly different.

The iron law that Empyreans could not be leapfrogged was a joke at Ye Yuan here.

Ye Yuan had confidence that as long as he broke through, his strength would absolutely not be beneath Lin Changqing.

“Eh? There’s actually someone here, and it’s even a human.”

As he was lost in thought, a voice suddenly sounded out not far away.

Another person said, “Heh, an Eighth Firmament True God? to actually be able to survive in the Star Devil Forest, really hit the jackpot!”

“Why would a human brat appear here? Could it be that ... he entered from a spatial rift?”

Ye Yuan turned his head to look and saw three dragon race youths with disdain and mocking looks on their faces.

The person in the lead was a scarred youth. He walked in front of Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Boy, do you know what place this is?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Dragon Eye Cave.”

The scarred youth’s two eyes narrowed and could not help revealing a look of disappointment.

Knowing about the Dragon Eye Cave, then he probably did not enter from a spatial rift.

It was absolutely impossible for humans to know about this place.

The scarred youth said with a smile that was not a smile, “Oh? You actually know that it’s the Dragon Eye Cave. Then you still dare to swagger about here in the Star Devil Forest? Truly, the ignorant are fearless!”

Ye Yuan smiled as he answered with a question, “Could it be that there’s some genuinely safe place in this Dragon Eye Cave?”

The scarred youth could not help suffocating, being choked badly.

This place was the world abyss monsters, a safe place was just relatively speaking.

The scarred youth said, “Kid, consider yourself lucky to run into us. Walking by yourself in the Star Devil Forest with your bit of strength, when you encounter a powerful abyss monster, you won’t even know how you die. Since we met, follow us in the future. With Big Brother Xun protecting you, it won’t be that easy even if you want to die too!”

“Alright,” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This one year had always been him going solo, it was too dreary.

Furthermore, in this kind of place, an additional person was always an additional portion of strength.

These few people were clearly veterans here already and should understand this place better. Understanding the situation from them was pretty good.

As for ‘Big Brother Xun protecting you’, this sort of word, Ye Yuan automatically ignored it.
