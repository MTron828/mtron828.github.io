Chapter 1280: Tears of Life!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Spatial turbulent flow?” Ye Yuan had a bewildered look, not sure what it meant.

“An empyrean world is a sealed-off small world that is incompatible with the Heavenspan World. In an empyrean world, even if one cultivates to True God Realm, they will also be unable to ascend to the Heavenspan World! Because every empyrean world has a World Locking Gate! This World Locking Gate cuts off the empyrean world and the Heavenspan World. In between, is endless spatial turbulent flow,” Kunwu said.

Ye Yuan was startled in his heart and said, “Then the Deity Realm powerhouses 100 thousand years ago, didn’t they all pass through the World Locking Gate, and entered the Heavenspan World?”

A hint of disdain flashed across the corners of Kunwu’s mouth, and he said, “They went out through the World Locking Gate. As for how many were able to reach the Heavenspan World, there’s no way of knowing.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes became wide-saucers, finally understanding Kunwu’s meaning.

This turbulent spatial flow was too terrifying!

The Deity Realm powerhouses that left the Immortal Grove Region 100 thousand years ago were at least no less than a hundred people.

Even though the Deity Realm had declined, there were definitely Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm existences among them.

Such a powerful lineup, but Kunwu used ‘how many’ this quantifying term to describe it. It could be seen how many people would die in the turbulent spatial flow1!

One had to know that those Deity Realm powerhouses were all the Immortal Grove Region’s apex existences!

Those who survived in this turbulent spatial flow was actually not even one-tenth! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Kunwu knew that Ye Yuan understood and said with a smile, “Now, you still want to go to the Heavenspan World?”

A hint of viciousness flashed across in Ye Yuan’s gaze, and he said, “Even if this turbulent spatial flow is any more terrifying, it’s also not as terrifying as losing Lingxue! The Heavenspan World, I must go and brave it! Senior, please point out the right path!”

Kunwu laughed in spite of himself and said, “Truly an infatuated one! But this turbulent spatial flow is just the first test that you have to face! The second condition is the truly difficult one!”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said, “Senior, please say!”

Kunwu was also solemn as he said, “Legends have it that on the Heavenspan Mountain, there’s a kind of spring water called Tears of Life. In the legends, this Tears of Life flows down from the top of the Heavenspan Mountain. As long as one consumes a drop, even if they only have a trace of spiritual consciousness existing, they can come back to life too! It’s rumored that very, very long ago, somebody had once found this Tears of Life before. But that’s just a rumor. Nobody has really found it before. At least, with Immortal Grove’s realm, he had never seen it before.”

Hearing Kunwu said so, Ye Yuan also heaved a sigh in relief.

“Senior, even if this junior has to dig three feet deep into the Heavenspan Mountain, I must also find this Tears of Life!” Ye Yuan said firmly

Heaven rewards the faithful. If there was a glimmer of hope, he would not give up!

He believed that there would come a day where he could find this Tears of Life.

It was just that his words made Kunwu and Dustless laugh at the same time.

Ye Yuan had a blank look, unsure what was going on.

Dustless smiled lightly and said, “Kid, you’re really an ignoramus who’s fearless! That Heaven Passage Mountain isn’t what you can dig as you like! That’s the Heavenspan World’s Dao enlightening holy land! Only when you reach the Divine Lord Realm and open up an inner world, can you step onto the Heavenspan Mountain! Otherwise, you’ll be crushed into meat paste by the Heavenspan Mountain’s power of laws! And Divine Lord Realm powerhouses can only climb up 10 miles. Further up, only by reaching Celestial Deity Realm, can one set foot on it. The things that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove haven’t seen are at least above 10 thousand miles! Even if you can cultivate to the Heavenly Empyrean Realm, no idea what year it will be already!”

Ye Yuan drew a cold breath when he heard. Only then did he know this Heavenspan Mountain’s extraordinariness.

He was still curious before, why the world outside would be named after a mountain. It turned out that it was actually this reason.

Kunwu added, “I forgot to tell you, the nine great Dao Ancestors gained enlightenment on Dao above a million miles on the Heavenspan Mountain, and from there, obtained the recognition of a law, becoming a Dao Ancestor! Many people all speculated, if there’s really Tears of Life, it’s very likely above a million miles! But how much assurance do you feel you have in cultivating to become a Dao Ancestor?”

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, finally knowing why Kunwu said that it was virtually impossible!

Because wanting to become a new Dao Ancestor, there must be an old Dao Ancestor who passed away!

This difficulty was simply comparable to ascending to heaven.

Ye Yuan’s expression instantly became incomparably ugly. He suddenly discovered that Kunwu saying so much was equivalent to wasting his breath.

“Senior, this ... Could it be that there’s no other way?” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

Kunwu gave him a glance and said with a nod, “There are two more ways!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, not expecting that Kunwu actually said two more ways all of a sudden!

“Senior, please say!” A glimmer of hope could be seen in Ye Yuan’s eyes again.

Kunwu let out a sigh and said, “The first method is to invite one of the Dao Ancestors to take action, and have him help look for the Tears of Life! The second method is to invite the Life Dao Ancestor to take action! What he obtained was the recognition of Life Laws. If he’s willing to take action, he should be able to save this lass. Of course, this is just my conjecture! In the Heavenspan World, the strongest person that one is able to see is also just Heavenly Emperor. Dao Ancestors have already not appeared for goodness knows how many years. Nobody had seen them before at all.”

Ye Yuan’s mind was in a mess. Saying these words was pretty much the same as not saying.

Summing these three methods up only had one point, that was that he must have a Dao Ancestor take action, or reach the realm of Dao Ancestor.

This ... was virtually something impossible.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s absent-minded look, Kunwu and Dustless exchanged a glance and was also helpless.

They could see through Ye Yuan’s feelings for Mu Lingxue. But, wanting to save a person who only had a trace of spiritual consciousness remaining, this difficulty was too great.

“Give up. This matter to you is simply impossible! In fact, in my opinion, the likelihood of you passing through the turbulent spatial flow is virtually zero! Stay in the Immortal Grove Region to be your controller well!” Kunwu let out a sigh and said.

After a long time, Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath, his emotions seemed to have calmed down considerably.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Kunwu and Dustless also let out a sigh in relief at the same time.

If Ye Yuan died in the turbulent spatial flow, the Immortal Grove Region would become a masterless empyrean world again.

Before long, it would thoroughly decline and wither away.

Their relationship with Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was not shallow, and they were naturally unwilling to see this kind of thing happen.

“Senior, please tell me the way to pass through the World Locking Gate!” Ye Yuan said with a resolute gaze.

Kunwu, the two of them, were greatly surprised. They even thought that they heard wrongly.

They already stated the pros and cons very clearly. But Ye Yuan was still obstinately stuck in a delusion.

For a girl, taking a completely impossible path, and might have the possibility of losing his life at any moment, this was simply incomprehensible.

The powerhouses of Heavenspan World were not what an empyrean world’s ant could be presumptuous enough to surmise!

Even if Ye Yuan controlled the Immortal Grove Region, he was still the bottommost-level existence in the Heavenspan World!

Even if Ye Yuan was amazingly talented in the Immortal Grove Region, reaching the Heavenspan World, even a dragon had to coil up too!

“You have to think carefully!” Kunwu said in a deep voice.

Ye Yuan’s expression was a never before seen determination. He nodded and said, “I’ve thought of it very clearly! If I must become a Dao Ancestor to save Lingxue, then I’ll become the Heavenspan World’s tenth Dao Ancestor!
