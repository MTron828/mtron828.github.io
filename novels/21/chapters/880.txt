Chapter 884: Invitation Coming from the Third Level

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It was just luck! This Ye normally don’t have such a high success rate when refining pills. These few days of seclusion, no idea why either, my moral character suddenly erupted, so I refined nine medicinal pills. Even the Seven Aperture Exquisite Pill that I’m normally unable to refine actually succeeded too,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

But Si Yin was speechless when she heard it.

Refining pills this sort of thing could rely on moral character too 1 ?

Although refining medicinal pills indeed had components of luck inside, that was directed at a single medicinal pill.

Refining nine different medicinal pills due to good luck, how heaven-defying to what degree did this luck have to be?

Do you really take this Exalt to be a fool?

However, apart from luck, was there still any better explanation?

Forget it if it was some other medicinal pill, but the Seven Aperture Exquisite Pill could not be refined just based on strength.

A success rate of 50%, this was also a bit too terrifying, right?

Thinking about it carefully, luck was also the best explanation.

This involuntarily made Si Yin confused.

“Alright. Doesn’t matter how, Sir is truly an alchemy genius hard to come across once in a thousand years! Moreover, Sir’s martial strength is shocking. Continuing to cultivate, perhaps you might be able to become the next Soul Martial Divine King!” Si Yin sucked in a breath deeply and said.

Ye Yuan said with a laugh, “Haha, I won’t dare to think about the Soul Martial Divine King. Let’s think about the issue of points.”

Si Yin’s face reddened, and she also became conscious of her loss of composure. She nodded and said, “The Seven Aperture Exquisite Pill is comparable to Tier 8 medicinal pills. Exchanging for 150 points is naturally not an issue. I’ll help Sir to go exchange it for points straight away. Sir, please follow me.”

Si Yin brought Ye Yuan into the inner-pavilion. After exchanging the medicinal pills to points, she took out a jade slip very seriously and handed it to Ye Yuan.

“Sir, although this Slaughter Sword Art is sold to you, you must swear a Heavenly Dao Oath to absolutely not spread this martial technique outside,” Si Yin said solemnly.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “That’s of course.”

Si Yin said that this martial technique when cultivated to the extreme, one’s strength would be on par with the Ten Great Divine Kings.

This level of martial technique, if it was at the outside world, forget about being sold, one would not even get to see it. Regardless of which faction it was, regarding this kind of martial techniques, they would all cherish it very dearly.

Although the Asura Arena circulated it, it was also not possible to allow it to spread around outside freely.

But it was precisely because so that Ye Yuan had even more suspicions. There must be something strange about things being abnormal. Since this cultivation method was so formidable, why would the Asura Arena display it publicly?

The Chaotic Devil Sea was a very mysterious region in the Divine Realm. Nobody knew just who this place was ruled by.

At one point, there were major forces that attempted to invade the Chaotic Devil Sea. But without any exception, they all failed. Furthermore, their outcomes were all very miserable.

As time passed, no one else dared to have designs on this region anymore.

But to say that the Slaughter Sword Art could be cultivated to the realm of the Ten Great Divine Kings, Ye Yuan had some doubts.

If that was really the case, why had he never heard before of the Chaotic Devil Sea producing any powerful characters?

Right in front of Si Yin, Ye Yuan swore a Heavenly Dao Oath before receiving the spirit halo jade from the other party’s hands.

Spirit halo jades were jade slips used specially to inscribe Tier 9 cultivation methods. Its properties were very special, and it was also extremely rare.

Ye Yuan reckoned that just this jade slip made from spirit halo jade was probably worth 10 points!

The moment it entered his hands, Ye Yuan’s divine sense had yet to sink inside when a surge of killing qi pounced from head-on. It actually made Ye Yuan involuntarily revolve Heart Like Monolith.

Seeing this sort of situation, Ye Yuan could not help being secretly shocked too.

This martial technique really seemed to be incredible!

Inside the spirit halo jade was definitely just a replica cultivation method and it actually had such power.

Looks like what Si Yin said before were mostly true. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sir obtained such a martial technique, don’t you wish to take a look?” Si Yin said with a gleeful smile.

This words had some spurring on intention.

But what kind of person was Ye Yuan, how could he fear this sort of spurring?

Smiling immediately, Ye Yuan directly sunk his divine sense into the spirit halo jade.

Boom!

Instantly, inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness teemed with violent killing intent. It actually wanted to control his will!

Ye Yuan was long prepared, revolving Heart Like Monolith to the limits, and forcefully suppressing this killing desire.

“Slaughter Sword Art First Level, Killing Song of the Sword! One killing song startles heaven and earth. Myriads of life are desolate and bleak.”

Only after forcefully suppressing the violent killing intent in his sea of consciousness did the contents of the first level appear in front of Ye Yuan.

With Ye Yuan’s current Slaughter Intent, he could only cultivate this first level’s move as well.

Just briefly skimming over it, Ye Yuan was greatly shocked.

Only then did he know that turns out the Slaughter Concept could actually still be used like this! No wonder Si Yin said that this martial technique could rival the strength of the Ten Great Divine Kings. Looks like what she said was not false.

If this first move was mastered, it was absolutely not beneath the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art’s seventh layer martial technique.

Ye Yuan was currently savoring the lingering appeal of the Slaughter Sword Art’s first level and was incomparably shocked in his heart. But he did not notice that the astonishment in Si Yin’s eyes was even greater than his.

Ye Yuan was not the first person to acquire this martial technique. But when the others sunk their divine sense inside the spirit halo jade, they all became unbelievably savage very quickly. There were even some people who got controlled by the killing intent within and attacked Si Yin violently.

Of course, the final outcome definitely would not be good.

However, Ye Yuan just became absent-minded briefly, then it was controlled by him.

“This Ye Yuan, his mind is unshakable! His heart realm cultivation has reached Heart Like Monolith Realm at least! I really don’t know how on earth he cultivates at such a young age!”

Inside this Asura Arena, Si Yin had seen before God knows how many geniuses. But not one could give her such a great shock like Ye Yuan.

Presently, Ye Yuan already withdrew out of the spirit halo jade and gave praise repeatedly, “Not bad! Pretty good!”

Si Yin put away her thoughts and said with a smile, “Does Sir feel that you got more than your money’s worth now?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right! Buying this martial technique for 500 points, this Ye profited at other people’s expense instead.”

This level of martial techniques were all priceless treasures and completely had no way of measuring using essence crystals. Although 500 points was an astronomical figure, learning a martial technique like this, it was indeed above its money’s worth.

Obtaining such a cultivation method, Ye Yuan could not quite contain his excitement anymore either, planning on going back to enter a retreat and cultivate this cultivation method.

But he had yet to leave when his path was blocked by someone.

The arrival was very polite. Clasping his hands at Ye Yuan, he asked, “May I ask if you’re Lord Ye Yuan?”

“Exactly so. What guidance do you have?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The person said, “This one is Sun Qi, the number one battle general under the third level’s Lord Demon King. Lord Demon King heard that Lord Ye Yuan is an outstanding young talent and wants to get acquainted with you, and specially order this lowly one to come here and invite milord up to the third level to have a chat.”

There were quite a few people in the outer-pavilion. Seeing Sun Qi, all of them were taken aback.

“It’s actually Lord Sun Qi! I heard that he’s the number one battle general under the Demon King; an expert ranked 58th on the Earth Carnage Proclamation! He’s actually so courteous to Ye Yuan!”

“Looks like Ye Yuan really made a name for himself. He hasn’t entered the third level yet, and he won Lord Demon King’s recognition, sending Lord Sun Qi personally here to invite. Truly remarkable!”

For a moment, there were many discussions inside the Asura Shop.
