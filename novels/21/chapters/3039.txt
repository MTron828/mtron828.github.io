Chapter 3038: You’re Cheating!

“All understood?” Ye Yuan asked.

The group of people in a file all nodded their heads like chicks pecking for rice.

Clearly, there were quite a few people who really understood.

Ye Yuan and Ouyang Fangde fought for a day and a night with no less than 3000 moves.

Ouyang Fangde’s moves were virtually crushed by Ye Yuan.

If they still did not understand, then Ye Yuan was really going to beat people up.

Of course, it was not all of them either.

Ouyang Fangde was not really some rookie.

Among these over one million people, it was already very impressive that some of them could understand it.

There was still a large portion who could not crack it even if they were taught.

“Understood!”

“Many thanks, Heavenly Saint Ye! Watch me pummel him!”

“I understand too! What strongest thousand people in history? It’s nothing more than this!?Hahaha?…”

“You didn’t see that Ouyang Fangde’s expression. It’s really hilarious!”

“No rush. I feel that his expression will be even more depressed after a period of time!”

… …

Very soon, Hu Gaoshan came forward on his own accord and was the first to enter the battle formation.

Ouyang Fangde’s expression was very unfriendly.

He already understood that he was played like a monkey for a day by Ye Yuan!

Yet, he could not do anything about it.

“That scoundrelly punk was dismantling moves for you all, right? Very good, you can suffer my wrath then!” Ouyang Fangde said in a cold voice.

Hu Gaoshan laughed and said, “Ouyang Fangde, you’re thinking too much! Next up, what you can do is to be trampled by us over and over again!?Hahaha?…”

Ouyang Fangde sneered and said, “Do you think that by dismantling the moves, you can resolve it? You’re too naive!”

Hu Gaoshan did not back down in the least bit and said, “Whether or not I’m being naive, you’ll know in a while!”

“Then let me see it! Pen Expressing Dragons and Snakes!”

The judge pen danced like dragons and phoenixes, swift and fierce to the extreme.

In a same rank battle, this move practically had no solutions!

But Hu Gaoshan’s comprehension ability was high. He had long already seen through Ouyang Fangde’s weakness.

Compared to when he just entered the Vertical Heaven Stairs, Hu Gaoshan could be considered to have been reborn anew.

Although somewhat strained, he still barely managed to avoid Ouyang Fangde’s Pen Expressing Dragons and Snakes.

Ouyang Fangde’s face became black as the bottom of a pot.

Nearly succeeded!

The strength of this guy opposite of him was really very weak!

This kind of weakling was absolutely a target for being one-shotted!

Top 1000 in history, this was really not randomly proclaimed.

Yet, he could not do anything to Hu Gaoshan.

His moves no longer had any secrets in front of Hu Gaoshan.

Too much was exposed!

In the beginning, Hu Gaoshan was still somewhat reserved.

He knew that Ouyang Fangde was very strong. Ouyang Fangde and him were not on the same level at all.

Fortunately, he knew his opponent’s weaknesses very clearly.

Hence, he narrowly avoided his opponent’s attacks time and again.

Until the back, Hu Gaosha gradually got used to his opponent’s tempo.

Furthermore, he gradually improved in the midst of battle!

Ye Yuan’s explanation on Dao previously, coupled with the dismantling of moves in this round, made him achieve mastery through a comprehensive study of the subject.

Hence, Ouyang Fangde was in tragedy.

Every move, every style, he fought until he was extremely aggrieved.

He felt boundless strength from head to toe but could not unleash it at all.

Boom!

Finally, after several hundred moves, Hu Gaoshan saw an opening and took his life in one move!

Hu Gaoshan was victorious!

“I … I actually won!?Hahaha?… I won!”

In an instant, Hu Gaoshan fell into wild ecstasy.

Although he knew that he could definitely win, but when it really arrived at this moment, he still had a feeling like he was dreaming.

Not long ago, he was still an ant-like existence.

But now, he clearly felt his power! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Everything was bestowed by Heavenly Saint Ye!

He only came to the Labyrinth Divine Palace to give it a try. He knew that he definitely could not even clear the Vertical Heaven Stairs.

But now, he beat the powerful Ouyang Fangde!

He came before Ye Yuan and bowed respectfully as he said, “Many thanks for Heavenly Saint Ye’s grace of guidance. Hu Gaoshan will engrave it in my heart!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Go to the side to comprehend. You should have reaped considerable harvests in this battle!”

Hu Gaoshan said respectfully, “Yes!”

Following that, Ouyang Fangde broke down.

One after another entered the battle formation. Then, he was brutalized over and over again.

He hated, hated why Ancestor had to replicate even his emotions so perfectly.

Wasn’t I just a tool?

Shouldn’t I not have feelings?

Who am I?

Where am I?

What am I doing?

Ouyang Fangde started to doubt life; even though his life had already ended long ago.

“Ye Yuan, you’re cheating! This is cheating!?Ahh, ahhh, ahhh!?Ancestor, take me in!” In the battle formation, Ouyang Fangde completely broke down.

But he was still a tool. He still needed to repeat the battles.

Then he was wrecked over and over again.

Half a month later, the battle ended. There were a total of more than 300 thousand people who passed the first round assessment.

This was also to say that Ouyang Fangde was abused more than 300 thousand times!

Those that remained were all those who could not understand. Ye Yuan did not let them participate.

Of course, there were also those who were not afraid of death and insisted on taking part, then were immediately one-shotted by Ouyang Fangde.

Later on, no one dared to do it anymore.

Only then did they know that Ouyang Fangde was really very strong.

If you did not understand the other party’s moves, then you should not join in the fun. You would die.

Yang Qing looked at Ye Yuan and rolled his eyes, and he said, “You’re really a demon! You look at how you’ve tormented him and turned him into that state!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re actually showing sympathy for a tool? Him alone going through hardships to let everyone become strong, what’s bad about this?”

Yang Qing’s mouth curled, and he said, “I’m going!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Be careful!”

Yang Qing nodded slightly, directly entering the battle formation.

In this half a month, he had already cleared seven rounds. Now, he was going to challenge the eighth round.

These seven rounds similarly had considerable harvests to Yang Qing.

His strength improved significantly!

However, Yang Qing’s path forward also became more and more difficult.

After just five rounds, he discovered that his opponents got stronger and stronger!

Originally, when he arrived at this round, he wanted to challenge these 1000 people with a spear.

In the end, he discovered that this was virtually something impossible.

Ye Yuan did not stay idle either. He started challenging the second round.

Those 300 thousand people did not move their gazes, staring at Ye Yuan’s battle formation.

A ravaging for several hundred thousand was about to start again very soon.

Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven, Wang Ningyang cleared five rounds. Her expression was very ugly.

A series of wails came from inside the battle formations.

“Why is this damn Ouyang Fangde so strong?”

“Making it through ten people, this is simply something impossible!”

“Freak! This Thousand Souls Hall is really too freakish! No wonder the Labyrinth Divine Palace virtually annihilated the 33 Heavens. The strengths of their disciples were really too strong!”

… …

Different from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, this place had long already become a scene of wails.

Many people were directly finished off by Ouyang Fangde in the first round and did not even have time to escape.

Wang Ningyan looked at the Thousand Souls List in the great hall, her expression solemn as she said, “Damn it, these guys are too strong! At this rate, we can’t catch up to Yang Qing at all! Just what kind of monster did Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven produce?”
