Chapter 2582: Great Dao Returning to One!

“So strong! This is the rule of Yang! It can be said to be half of the power of the world! This power completely crushes those of the same rank!”

“Although Lu Zhanyuan suppressed his realm to upper Lesser Sublime Heaven, his strength can probably sweep across Lesser Sublime Heavens, right?”

“Not on the same level at all! That Yun Qing is simply weak like a child in front of Lu Zhanyuan!”

… …

The moment Lu Zhanyuan made his move, it immediately evoked a series of exclamations.

Compared to Yun Qing, Lu Zhanyuan was like a tumultuous violent wave, while Yun Qing was just a little trickle.

The two could not be mentioned in the same breath at all.

Lu Zhanyuan’s sun rule was peerlessly domineering.

Great Trichiliocosm Xun Yang Palm!

Unleashing a palm, it was as if a world was fired over, being unbelievably terrifying.

Ye Yuan swung his sword in a circle, being composed and collected, and he uttered coolly, “Universe!”

The moment the domain formed, there was no weakness to exploit!

Boom!

The two clashed and were actually evenly matched!

“Dual Polarity!”

“Four Symbols!”

“Six Unity!”

“Eight Diagrams!”

Ye Yuan’s sword art was akin to raging river waters, stretching long and unbroken.

The changes in the sword art also contained the maxim of Great Dao!

Dao begets one, one births two, two births three, three begets myriad life!

The beginning had come again, with endless variations!

No matter how fierce and domineering he, Lu Zhanyuan, was, he could only fight with Ye Yuan until they were evenly matched in strength.

Those people mocking Ye Yuan were long already dumbfounded.

The originally one-sided battle actually fought until they were locked in battle!

Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao was ever-changing, suave and carefree, elusive and unpredictable.

“This … How can he be so strong? That … That’s the inner sect’s number three, pre-natal grade five Sun Dao Physique!”

“A trash can actually comprehends Sword Dao to such a realm? Truly inconceivable!”

“No Dao physique, lower-inferior aptitude, this … this entrance assessment is simply a joke!”

… …

This was really gaining worldwide fame and success in one battle!

Ye Yuan’s sword art that was impregnable truly exhibited Sword Dao to the extreme.

His Sword Dao did not oppress people by force and was also merely at the first level of Sword Dao rule.

But his application of Sword Dao reached the acme of perfection, a realm that took people’s breath away in astonishment!

Ingenuity in varying tactics depended on mother wit!

Therefore, even when facing the powerful Lu Zhanyuan, he still did not show the slightest signs of defeat.

Protector Mo and Han Qianyun two people were dumbstruck with amazement from watching.

“Is … Is this guy really of lower-inferior aptitude? This sword art is likely not beneath Luo Yunqing already, right?” Protector Mo said in surprise.

“Heh,?more than just not beneath him! If Luo Yunqing suppressed his realm, I’m afraid that he isn’t this person’s match! Strange, could it be that this assessment grand array is actually spoiled? This guy is really a genius?” Han Qianyun similarly said in surprise.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s breathtaking performance, many people had the idea that the grand array was broken.

Protector Mo said, “At this time, it’s not good for Junior Apprentice Brother Lu! That boy is too stable!”

Han Qianyun recovered from the surprise and said smilingly, “No need to worry. Junior Apprentice Brother Lu he isn’t so easy to deal with! He has already comprehended that move!”

Protector Mo said in surprise, “You’re talking about birthing Yin from extreme Yang?”

Han Qianyun smiled and said, “What else can there be?”

Protector Mo said in shock, “If he comprehended this move, then that brat will be in danger! Junior Apprentice Brother Lu is probably going to employ a killer move!”

Sure enough, right at this moment, Lu Zhanyuan gave an angry yell, the imposing aura on his body skyrocketing!

“Terrific lad, I underestimated you! Your ability to pretend to be a pig to eat a tiger is very good! But it ends here! My pre-natal grade five Sun Dao Physique isn’t a joke!”

Lu Zhanyuan gave a loud cry and said, “Watch out! Extreme Yang births Yin! Grand Heaven Yang Melancholy Cloud Hand!”

Extreme Yang was not scary.

What was scary was extreme Yang birthing Yin!

This was the same logic as extreme toughness birthing softness.

It was just that this rule of sun power was God knows how many times higher level than extreme toughness birthing softness!

Once this move was unleashed, the power increased by more than ten times!

No matter how perfect Ye Yuan’s swordsmanship was, it was also impossible to block this kind of powerful strength!

“A shame, this move is too strong. Ye Yuan probably won’t be able to block it!”

“This person is too arrogant, insisting on offending the inner sect’s number three. Otherwise, with his strength, the sect will definitely want him!”

“Challenging an upper-superior aptitude with a lower-inferior aptitude, Ye Yuan can be sufficiently proud too!”

… …

When many people saw Lu Zhanyuan’s move, they could not help sighing.

Ye Yuan’s combat power made them have a feeling of rising phoenix-like from the ashes.

It let them see hope too.

It was just that this life-and-death fight was ultimately still Lu Zhanyuan who won!

However, Ye Yuan just smiled coolly and said, “Extreme Yang birthing Yin, only carries a trace of the power of extreme Yin, that’s all! You’re still too far away from Yin Yang harmony! Today, I’ll let you take a look at what’s called Yin and Yang complementing mutually, universe forming naturally!”

“Eight Diagrams!”

“Six Unity!”

“Four Symbols!”

“Dual Polarity!”

“Uni . .. verse!”

Originally, Ye Yuan’s sword technique went from simple to complex; incomparably gorgeous.

But now, Ye Yuan’s sword technique went from complex to simple, returning to one’s original simplicity, returning to ‘Universe’ again!

This process was not a process of regression, but contained the maxim of Great Dao!

Going from simple to complex, deriving myriad life!

Going from complex to simple, Great Dao returning to one!

Yin and Yang complementing mutually, Universe … formed naturally!

Sword Dao was also a Great Dao that developed heaven and earth!

The power in this increased exponentially!

Even if a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum was here, they might not be able to block this strike of Ye Yuan’s too!

On the grandstands, the group of protectors suddenly stood up, looking at Ye Yuan with astonished faces. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Impressive! This boy’s comprehension ability is absolutely seldom-seen in the world!”

“Inoculating Great Dao with Sword Dao, this Sword Dao should be his own comprehension! Universe forming naturally, mowing down all resistance!”

“Sigh!?Lu Zhanyuan’s comprehension of Dao can’t compare to Ye Yuan’s even if he whips his horse! The disparity! The disparity!”

… …

People who understood the sword could see through the sharpness of this sword with one glance.

Going from simple to complex, many people could do it.

But the power of going from complex to simple was tremendous, the difficulty also increased exponentially!

Without an extremely deep understanding of Dao, there was no way of using this move at all!

Only to see Ye Yuan unleash a sword, the fierceness of this sword directly split the force of the Grand Heaven Yang Melancholy Cloud Hand and landed on Lu Zhanyuan’s body.

“Pffft!”

Lu Zhanyuan spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, his figure flying out backward.

He was defeated!

However, it was not over.

This was a life-and-death battle!

Ye Yuan did not stop, the long sword following like a shadow, following right after.

Lu Zhanyuan’s expression changed wildly, a feeling of danger welling up in his heart.

It was just that he was already injured at this time and could only forcefully resist it.

Boom!

Another sword!

Lu Zhanyuan was directly sent flying.

If not for him being a major cultivation realm higher, his divine essence incomparably thick, that sword previously would have already taken his life.

It was just that Ye Yuan clearly did not have the intention of letting him go, each sword faster than the last.

Lu Zhanyuan was pushed to his limit and his heart was burning with anxiety.

Boom!

He did not hesitate in the slightest, instantly unlocking all of his strength, and he roared angrily, “Damn thing, I’m going to kill you!”

The current Lu Zhanyuan had already completely fallen into a rampage.

He did not expect that he actually lost to a lower-inferior aptitude trash in a fair fight!

He could not accept this result!
