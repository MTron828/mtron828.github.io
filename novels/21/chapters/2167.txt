Chapter 2171: Stomping Heaven’s Chosen Underfoot!

The heavenly emperor powerhouses were long already motionless. Their reaction was sufficient to prove how great the shock that Long Yuan’s strength brought to them was.

Long Tianyu stroked his bear and said with a smile, “You guys are also looking down on Long Yuan too much. This isn’t his true strength. However ... using it to deal with Ye Yuan is sufficient.”

“W-What? This still isn’t all of his strength?” When Long Zifeng heard this, his eyeballs almost popped out. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Divine Lightning Devastation, without heaven-defying talent, there was simply no way to awaken it.

But Long Tianyu said that this was still not Long Yuan’s true strength.

Then how horrifying was this guy’s true strength?

The group of heavenly emperors could not help but somewhat start having doubts about life.

Long Tianyu had a smug look and said with a faint smile, “Long Yuan is my Heavenly Dragon Stronghold’s most talented Son of the Heavenly Dragon in this one million years, not one of! His talent can be ranked even when looking at the entire Dragon Clan! In the future, it’s virtually a sure bet for him to become a Transcendent Heavenly Emperor!”

All of the heavenly emperors were speechless. Originally they thought that Ye Yuan could become a black horse in the Battle of Dragon Sons this time, or even post a threat to Long Yuan.

But looking at it now, everyone was thinking too much.

Ye Yuan’s talent was not even worthy of carrying Long Yuan’s shoes!

So what if Atavism Dragon Soul? So what if perfect seventh transformation?

The dragon race’s strongest talent was still bloodline power, still innate divine abilities!

Morningstar nodded slightly, revealing a look of approval. Clearly, he was very satisfied with Long Yuan.

This time, even Long Xiaochun did not dare to speak out and shoot Long Tianyu anymore. Because she was also somewhat in doubt about whether Ye Yuan could withstand such a terrifying lightning sea anymore.

... ...

In the midst of the endless lightning sea, Long Yuan stood proudly.

“Now, do you know the disparity between you and me? A thousand years later, you simply won’t be able to imagine my realm! Didn’t even comprehend innate divine abilities, just the likes of a trash like you also dare to talk wildly about talent?” Long Yuan said with a disdainful look.

Ye Yuan had no joy nor sorrow on his face and said calmly, “Who told you that I didn’t comprehend an innate divine ability?”

Long Yuan’s expression changed, but then he saw the bloodline pressure on Ye Yuan’s body suddenly erupt.

That imposing momentum was actually not much weaker than him.

The spirit of a true dragon transformed into an enormous dragon and revolved around Ye Yuan, it was actually like a living thing!

An aura that came from great antiquity made the entire lightning sea start trembling.

That boundless dipper lightning that drove the heavens actually seemed to have intelligence, not daring to approach Ye Yuan.

Long Yuan’s expression changed wildly, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

“That ... What kind of innate divine ability is that? Why have I never seen it before?” Long Zifeng cried out in surprise.

Not just him, all of the heavenly emperors had blank looks on their faces.

Clearly, they all had not seen Ye Yuan’s innate divine ability before.

Only the light in Morningstar’s eyes grew brighter and brighter!

“Heretic Dragon Dominating Space! How long has it been since anyone in my Dragon Clan has awakened it!” Morningstar said with an emotional sigh.

Long Xiaochun seemed to understand and not understand and asked doubtfully, “Heretic Dragon Dominating Space? It sounds like it’s very badass. Is it very impressive?”

“Heretic Dragon Dominating Space! It’s actually Heretic Dragon Dominating Space! This ... This wouldn’t be the legendary innate divine ability, right?” Long Zifeng trembled all over and cried out in surprise.

“My God! The first innate divine ability that this fellow awakened is actually Heretic Dragon Dominating Space?” A Heavenly Emperor cried out strangely.

“I ... I take back my words before. These two people are both monsters!”

There was an uproar among the heavenly emperors, being stunned by the scene before their eyes.

Only Long Tianyu’s expression looked somewhat unnatural.

Morningstar nodded and replied Long Xiaochun: “A very impressive innate divine ability! Our dragon race is a species that Heaven looks after, with our bloodline containing the power of Heavenly Dao. Therefore, the innate divine abilities that we awaken are extremely powerful. However, Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter, this level of innate divine ability, compared to Heretic Dragon Dominating Space, is far too lacking! Even Divine Lightning Devastation is also a magnitude weaker compared to Heretic Dragon Dominating Space!”

“Heretic Dragon Dominating Space is an innate divine ability that contains spatial law, bringing the might of heaven and earth, the power being unimaginable. More importantly, this innate divine ability, it’s already been at least ten million years since anyone has awakened it in my Dragon Clan!”

Long Xiaochun sucked in a breath and cried out in surprise, “So incredible? Ye Yuan’s spatial law is very formidable. No wonder he can awaken this innate divine ability.”

Morningstar said in surprise, “So that’s how it is, no wonder! The awakening of our Dragon Clan’s innate divine abilities is actually closely related to the inclinations of our bloodline. In Long Yuan’s bloodline, lightning-attribute laws are the most lively, so he awakened Divine Lightning Devastation. But wanting to awaken Heretic Dragon Dominating Space can’t be accomplished by merely having slight knowledge about spatial law. It looks like Ye Yuan’s spatial law is at least rank six and above!”

Hearing Morningstar’s analysis, the group of heavenly emperors was dumbfounded.

Witnessing Long Yuan’s talent earlier, each and every one of them was incredibly shocked and immediately cast Ye Yuan aside like a pair of worn-out shoes.

They did not think that in a blink of an eye, the talent that Ye Yuan displayed immediately overshadowed Long Yuan.

They naturally did not know that Ye Yuan broke through rank seven at the same time with his perfect seventh transformation plus essence, energy, and spirit three paths.

Under such a stimulation, awakening a formidable innate divine ability was merely ordinary!

These two people’s talents already completely exceeded the heavenly emperors’ expectations.

Just as the group of heavenly emperors was in shock, Long Yuan and Ye Yuan two people were dealing blow for blow and already reached a white-hot stage.

Long Yuan saw that the situation was not good, it was naturally impossible to give Ye Yuan another chance to display his innate divine ability.

“Lightning punishment! Obliterate for me!”

It was only to see him shake a finger, hundreds and thousands of wrist-thick blots of dipper lightning that drove the heavens suddenly fell down from the void.

Long Yuan was akin to a sovereign who controlled divine lightning, his momentum unstoppable.

Amidst the endless lightning sea, an enormous circular-shaped aura seemed to be like another world.

Ye Yuan was situated inside. Suddenly, he took a step out!

“Roar!”

The spirit of the true dragon gave an astonishing roar. Dragon claw virtually synchronizing with Ye Yuan, it stepped onto the void.

Bang!

This step, the entire heaven and earth trembled!

The space of the Mist Battlefield seemed to have been trampled into pieces.

Those hundreds and thousands of bolts of dipper lightning that drove the heavens were actually forcefully scattered away by the power of this stamp!

Long Yuan only felt a sweetness in his throat, a mouthful of blood mist spraying out wildly, already sustaining heavy injuries.

The lightning sea dissipated, the true dragon vanished.

Everything returned to tranquility.

Ye Yuan stood in the air, but swapped positions with Long Yuan, looking down from above.

Under this stomp, it trampled all of Long Yuan’s pride to smithereens!

“This is your so-called talent? So-called pride? Very ordinary! Wonder if I have the qualifications to talk about a thousand years later now?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Long Yuan’s eyes were full of unwillingness. He had always thought that he was the Dragon Clan’s junior generation’s strongest genius.

In Heavenly Dragon Stronghold, he had never encountered a match before.

His pride was higher than the heavens.

But today, somebody actually trampled all of his pride underfoot.

He was unwilling!

He was unresigned!

All of a sudden, the Heavenly Dragon Mark on Long Yuan’s forehead seemed to burn like a cluster of fire!

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up slightly, a little surprised.

At the outside world, the group of heavenly emperors cried out in surprise one after another.

Long Yuan awakened a second time!
