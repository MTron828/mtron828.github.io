Chapter 2693: Returning to the Original Owner!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan was silent, everyone looked at him with complicated expressions.

Who could have thought that by making a trip to the Land of Dragon Slumber, this measly little Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum could actually decide the life and death of the seven great kings?

After a moment of silence, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Alright, I can spare his life. But death penalty can be spared; punishment can’t be escaped! Black Flood Dragon King, cripple your own cultivation,and then I can let you off. From now on, you’ll stay in this Thistle South Sea Region and be an idle dragon king!”

Black Flood Dragon King’s expression changed and he scolded angrily, “You might as well kill me!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you’re not willing, then I can only do it myself.”

It was only to see him recite a spell. The Emerald Sea Divine Conch activated again!

Boom!

Hundreds of water dragons suddenly condensed in the deep sea.

Each water dragon had the cultivation of Jade Sovereign Heaven!

Hundreds of Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, what kind of concept was that?

Back then, when the Pill Alliance besieged the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, they merely mobilized around 100 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

But Ye Yuan directly summoned more than 100 water dragons!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A hundred water dragons bombarded Black Flood Dragon King wildly, making everyone’s expression change from watching again.

The torrent just now, versus these hundred water dragons, was two different kinds of impact.

But without a doubt, they were both extremely strong!

Furthermore, these over a hundred water dragons were not completely disorderly.

Their fighting method was far stronger than those that Black Flood Dragon King and Little Dragon Girl summoned.

“Too strong! Completely different levels!”

“Black Flood Dragon King could only summon several water dragons of similar strength to his when he used the Emerald Sea Divine Conch. But Ye Yuan summoned hundreds of water dragons that’s even higher realm than him in one go. This is called disparity!”

“That’s right. Ye Yuan definitely has true dragon bloodline! I didn’t expect that a true dragon bloodline actually appeared in my seven great sea regions! The heavens of the seven great sea regions are going to change!”

… …

At this time, they all realized that the appearance of Ye Yuan, this true dragon, would make the seven great sea regions’ arrangement undergo massive changes.

If Ye Yuan had the intention to seek hegemony, he could even dominate the seven great sea regions now and become the king of the seven seas!

Black Flood Dragon King was severely injured in the first place. Amidst the wild bombardment, he could still barely manage to hold on at the beginning.

But later on, he gave up completely.

After a bout of indiscriminate bombardment, Black Flood Dragon King directly became a cripple.

He sank to the bottom of the sea, his aura being feeble to the extreme.

Ye Yuan arrived in front of Black Flood Dragon King and said coolly, “You only had yourself to blame for this, can’t blame me!”

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, must … must you do this?” Little Dragon Girl said in tears.

It was still Ye Yuan’s first time seeing years in this girl’s eyes.

However, he still said cruelly, “This is my bottom line! If he isn’t crippled, then we can only fall out and become enemies! You should know, this incident wasn’t started by me!”

Black Shark and the rest were all silent like cicadas in winter at this time.

It was not that they did not want to take action, but that Ye Yuan was too powerful.

The Ye Yuan who possessed the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, his might was already sufficient to overthrow the entire Thistle South Royal Clan!

Pray tell, who could resist these hundreds of Jade Sovereign Heaven water dragons?

Little Dragon Girl wept bitterly, but she nodded her head and said, “Okay!”

Ye Yuan also did not expect that Little Dragon Girl actually nodded her head at this time.

He even thought that he was going to fall out and become enemies with this girl because of Black Flood Dragon King.

However, even if he killed Black Flood Dragon King, he would not make things difficult for Little Dragon Girl either.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and did not talk rubbish either, directly going up and crippling Black Flood Dragon King’s cultivation.

Seeing the king of the seven seas become a cripple, the expressions of each and every one of the sea race powerhouses present changed slightly.

That was one of the strongest seven people in the seven seas!

But there were also some dragon sons that had a hint of smugness that flashed across their eyes.

They knew that Ye Yuan’s foundation was not in the sea and that he would definitely return to the shore.

Therefore, in the wake of Black Flood Dragon King being crippled, Thistle South Royal Clan’s decline already became inevitable.

Thistle South Sea Region was the closest to land. It could be said to be the most prosperous sea region.

The other sea regions had the intention of encroaching on it long ago. It was just that due to Black Flood Dragon King’s might, they did not dare to take action all along.

But now, Black Flood Dragon King was already crippled.

The chance came now!

“Uncle Black Shark, carry Royal Father, let’s go back!” Little Dragon Girl already stopped crying at this time and ordered Black Shark expressionlessly.

He did not see much hatred in Little Dragon Girl’s eyes.

But he felt that Little Dragon Girl seemed to have matured at this instant!

Little Dragon Girl was playful, but she was not stupid.

She knew what the Thistle South Royal Clan had to face now that Black Flood Dragon King was crippled.

Therefore, she had to become strong!

It was not calm and tranquil in the sea.

The seven great royal clans’ open and covert contentions had never ceased before.

In the past, there was Black Flood Dragon King suppressing the others. Hence, Little Dragon Girl could live a carefree life.

But now, her brothers, her mothers, all needed her to protect them!

Right at this time, a streak of flowing light flew by.

The Emerald Sea Divine Conch stopped in front of her.

Little Dragon Girl looked at Ye Yuan with some surprise, uncertain what it meant.

When the others saw this scene, their expressions changed greatly too.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, you …”

“The Emerald Sea Divine Conch is yours in the first place. I’m returning it to you now! With your current bloodline power, if you control the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, your strength won’t be weaker than half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven! I’ve also left the method of controlling the Emerald Sea Divine Conch inside. With your intelligence, you should be able to learn it very quickly.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Talking until here, Ye Yuan’s gaze turned dark and swept across the face of the numerous powerhouses and said, “From today onward, you’re the Thistle South Royal Clan’s new dragon lord!”

The expressions of those dragon sons concocting a scheme could not help changing drastically at this time.

They looked at Ye Yuan with incomprehensible expressions, not understanding why he would do this.

That was a grandmist treasure!

Grandmist treasure, that was a treasure that Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses used!

He actually casually gave it to Little Dragon Girl?

Little Dragon Girl also looked at Ye Yuan with a look of surprise, as if she did not know him.

She also did not expect that Ye Yuan actually returned the Emerald Sea Divine Conch to her!

Before that, Little Dragon Girl had always believed that the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was hers.

But now, she already understood, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch simply belonged to the Land of Dragon Slumber.

And the Land of Dragon Slumber’s inheritance had already been completely acquired by Ye Yuan.

Therefore, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch belonged to Ye Yuan!

The power that the Emerald Sea Divine Conch unleashed in Ye Yuan’s hands, was much greater than unleashed in her hands!

Ye Yuan possessing the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was equivalent to suddenly advancing a major cultivation realm, and could even overpower Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

Such a massive lucky chance, he actually did not want it?

It was impossible for this kind of thing to happen to anyone.

But, Ye Yuan did it!

She shook her head hard and said, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, this is yours. I can’t take it!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Take it! The Emerald Sea Divine Conch belongs to the sea. It can only unleash its greatest power in the sea! Following me to land, it won’t be able to even unleash half of its power. Therefore, it is better for it to follow you. Furthermore, without it, you won’t be able to protect your royal father and royal mother, as well as your siblings. So, don’t need to refuse me.”

Little Dragon Girl’s eyes could not help becoming wet, nodding her head hard at Ye Yuan..
