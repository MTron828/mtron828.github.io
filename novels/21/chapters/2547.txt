Chapter 2553: Ninth Grade Golden Pill!

A Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, as the name suggests, it was the heavenly pill that consolidated one’s foundation and nurtured one’s essence.

It was the foundational medicinal pill among heavenly pills, but it was also one of the most important medicinal pills.

At the beginning of cultivation, whether the foundation was good or bad, it had a direct relationship with one’s future achievements.

The higher the quality of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, the more solid the foundation of the martial artist would naturally be.

On the markets, the price of an upper third grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was already very considerable. It could be sold for 50 heavenly crystals.

One had to know, one heavenly crystal could let an ordinary person live for as long as a year in the imperial city!

A fourth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, the price was directly double!

Even the price of the worst lower fourth grade heavenly pill had to reach 100 heavenly crystals too.

As for a fifth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, it had to be sold for at least 500 heavenly crystals.

Of course, this was just in theory.

Lin Lan had not taken action to refine Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills for many years already. It was naturally impossible to want to see fifth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills.

Therefore, fifth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills were basically just a legend.

Then, the scarcity of seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills could be imagined.

Furthermore, when the quality reached seventh grade, it would tend to go from a quantitative change to qualitative change. The heavenly pill would often have some inconceivable fringe effects to develop the human body’s potential.

Therefore, the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill that Ye Yuan refined became a sought-after item in an instant.

Each seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill that the Tang Family put out was often hiked to a sky-high price of ten thousand heavenly crystals!

Many martial artists simply shrank back at the sight of it!

But there was no choice either. Cultivation was something that burnt money to begin with.

Therefore, the strong grew stronger and the weak grew weaker.

And the popularity of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill also drove the various businesses of the Tang Family.

The Tang Family made a lot of money.

Even Second Prince could not sit still anymore!

Lu Yun brought Second Prince and paid a visit to ask for pills!

“Younger Brother Tang Yu, I say, this prince has treated you pretty well these few years, right? In a while, when Master Ye exits seclusion, you have to put in a good word for me!” Second Price said with earnest.

Now, even Second Prince’s term of address for Tang Yu changed.

Calling younger brother, the tone carried currying favor.

This kind of attitude was unimaginable in the past.

What kind of status did Second Prince have and how proud was he? How could he address a measly little family’s young master as a brother?

But now, everything changed.

Tang Yu could not help feeling vicissitudes of emotion, feeling that when he was forced to call ‘Big Brother’ back then, it was really the wisest decision in his life!

“Huhu,?Second Prince Your Highness, don’t need to worry! Actually, you don’t need to beg me, Big Brother is most loyal to friends! Back then, Master Yun stood firmly on his side. Just based on this, you won’t go without a Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill! Furthermore, this time, Big Brother even made me invite Younger Sister Xuezhen. There’s likely to be a big play leaving seclusion this time!” Tang Yu said with a smile.

Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion this time had been a while again.

Before going into a retreat, Ye Yuan specially instructed Tang Yu to invite Yang Xuezhen over.

Clearly, there were benefits to give her.

Ye Yuan refined so many Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills previously and did not even give it to his own people.

Very clearly, this was saving the even better things for his own people!

Eighth grade?

Even thinking about it felt a little exciting!

So many years have passed, the present Yang Family also could not compare with the past anymore.

With the Tang Family father and son’s guidance and support, the Yang Family was also one of the few large family clans of the imperial city now; enough to rank in the top five.

Hearing Tang Yu’s words, Second Prince’s body trembled all over and he said with pleasant surprise, “Is this true?”

Tang Yu nodded and said, “It’s true”

Right then, Xiao Qi ran in, gave a bow to everyone, and said, “Master Ye has exited seclusion. Everyone, please go over!”

Everyone’s mind could not help trembling, sprinting over.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Tang Yu said with a look of excitement, “Big Brother! Is there some good stuff this time?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said,?“Huhu,?you guessed it again! That’s right, there’s indeed good stuff!”

The moment Tang Yu heard, he was overjoyed and said, “Big Brother, could it be that … you broke through to eighth grade?”

Ye Yuan took out an exquisite wooden box, handed it to Tang Yu, and said smilingly, “This is yours!”

Then, he passed Yang Xuezhen a wooden box and said, “Xuezhen, this is yours!”

Subsequently, Tang Jinhua, Lu Yun, Jiang Yu, also each received a wooden box.

Only Second Prince did not.

Depressed! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Seeing Second Prince being coy and shy there like a little wife, Tang Yu could not resist asking, “Big Brother, Second Prince has helped the Tang Family out considerably these few years. Can you … also give him a Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill?”

With Second Prince’s identity, he had naturally eaten Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills before too. Furthermore, the grade was not low.

Lower fifth grade!

But, what did lower fifth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills count for in front of seventh and eighth grade?

As long as he could swallow a seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, he might be able to breakthrough to grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven very quickly!

Ye Yuan gave Second Prince a glance, thought about it, and also took a wooden box and handed it over to him.

Tang Yu could not quite hold back his excitement and said, “Big Brother, can I open it to take a look?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Go on!”

Tang Yu chuckled and opened the box very carefully.

The slit opened up in the box and a dazzling golden light seeped out of the crack.

Apart from Ye Yuan, everyone present trembled all over, their eyes revealing extremely shocked expressions.

“Golden light! N-Ninth grade golden pill! C-Could this be a ninth grade golden pill?” Lu Yun cried out involuntarily.

Hearing ‘ninth grade golden pill’ these four words, Tang Yu’s hand almost trembled and threw away the box.

These four words were too magical!

Those were the four words that existed in legends!

It was merely just legends!

When heavenly pills entered ninth grade, they did not need to use the Cloud Mount Mother Stone to test it anymore.

Because a golden-colored medicinal pill was the hallmark of ninth grade!

However, everyone knew about ninth grade golden pills, but no one had ever seen one before.

Because nobody could refine a ninth grade golden pill at all!

Forget about a tiny little Eastward Country, even in the entire True Yang Heavenly Domain, it was unheard of that anyone could refine a ninth grade golden pill too!

Even the most, most simple Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!

When heavenly pills reached seventh and eighth grade this level, sometimes, it was not what ‘effort’ this word could improve anymore.

This level reached the point to compete in talent!

Regardless of which profession, wanting to get started, you could do it as long as you put in enough effort.

But, if you wanted to reach the pinnacle in this line and promote to the ranks of masters, you needed sufficient talent!

And wanting to refine a ninth grade golden pill, the requirement for talent was almost freakish!

Tang Yu thought before that Ye Yuan could break through to eighth grade.

But he never dreamed that Ye Yuan could reach ninth grade!

He never thought that he would actually have a chance to consume a ninth grade golden pill!

“Big Brother, this … this …” Someone who was as eloquent as Tang Yu was actually somewhat tongue-tied and choking at this time!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This is what you deserve! These few Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills, yours and Xuezhen’s are upper ninth grade. Brother Lu and Jiang Yu’s are middle ninth grade. Tang Jinhua’s is lower ninth grade.”

Second Prince was taken aback and said, “Master Ye, then … what about mine?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Lower seventh grade!”

Second Prince’s face turned black, and he almost threw the wooden box on the ground.

This treatment was also too far off, right?
