Chapter 1604 Returning Domineeringly

“The few of you are merely ants living under Ye Yuan’s wings! Without Ye Yuan, you guys are nothing!”

Zhou Wei’s words struck the heart one by one, deeply provoking the few people’s self-esteem.

Especially White Light, his anger rushed to his head with a whoosh.

“A scholar prefers death to humiliation! This little lord, I, will risk everything and fight it out with you today!”

White Light’s figure flashed, transforming into a fierce tiger and rushed over toward Zhou Wei.

A hint of an imperceptible smile flashed across the corners of Zhou Wei’s mouth, and he suddenly smacked a palm out.

White Light only felt a burst of power that was strong until it made people despair surround him from all directions.

“Puhwark!”

White Light sprayed out a mouthful of fresh blood, feeling like the bones in his body cracked.

Yue Mengli’s expression changed, hurriedly catching him.

But the immense force directly knocked her flying out too.

Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were too strong!

Zhou Wei looked at this scene coldly and said coolly, “Do you see that? Can’t even receive a single palm from me, and you still dare to say that you all aren’t ants? If not because you all are staying here, you guys would already be dead people now. However ... you all can’t stay too long.”

Yue Mengli looked at Zhou Wei and said in a cold voice, “Treating us like this, aren’t you afraid of Second Elder finding out?”

Zhou Wei laughed loudly and said, “Second Elder is currently in seclusion, and his few disciples that are close to Ye Yuan are also all busy right now. When you all are chased out of the inner city and die outside, do you think that Second Elder will kill a protector for a dead man?”

Yue Mengli’s expression changed and she said in a cold voice, “Looks like Head Elder that side finally can’t control the situation any longer!”

Zhou Wei smiled and said, “Therefore, want to live, earn divine essence stones desperately then! Now, hand over our divine essence stones! There are a total of five of you, according to the rules, you have to pay 2.5 million divine essence stones.”

White Light gritted his teeth, wanting to stand up, but he could not do it at all.

Yue Mengli’s gaze was cold and she looked at Zhou Wei and said, “We’ll pay!”

As she said, Yue Mengli took out a storage ring and threw it to Zhou Wei.

By the side, Long Zhan clenched his teeth and said, “Miss Li-er, I ... I’ll leave the city today, you all don’t need to pay so many divine essence stones for me!”

Yue Mengli said, “Stop! If you go out of the city now, do you think that you can see tomorrow’s sun?”

Long Zhan could not help choking and gritted his teeth and said, “Long Zhan is merely a lowly life. It was His Excellency who gave me the chance to be reborn! Today, what does it matter if I return my life to His Excellency?”

Yue Mengli’s eyes were firm as she said, “We came together. So wanting to go, we naturally go together too! This kind of word, don’t say anymore in the future.”

Zhou Wei looked at this group of people and said with an amused look, “Looks like each and every one of you is still harboring hopes of getting lucky in your hearts! Those who enter the spatial inheritance, I’ve yet to hear of any who return alive. You guys, just give up on the idea forever! Haha ...”

Zhou Wei left with a loud laugh. Everyone was angry until their faces were livid.

But just as Zhou Wei said, leaving Ye Yuan, they were really powerless to contend with these Divine Lord Realm powerhouses!

Actually, when Ye Yuan left, he left them hundreds of millions of divine essence stones.

But after a hundred years, five people’s cultivation expenditure was not small.

Originally, with Second Elder’s support, they could still barely manage to maintain.

But these few years, they were exploited by Zhou Wei. The remaining divine essence stones on hand right now were also merely four to five million. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

And today, more than half was gone all at once!

The next time Zhou Wei came again, they could not afford it.

...

Originally thought that Zhou Wei would come again after a year, who knew that he came again after a few days!

“Zhou Wei, the tax that you want us to pay, we’ve already paid. What do you still want?” Li-er’s good-temper also could not quite hold back from erupting anymore.

Zhou Wei smiled and said, “Who told you all that the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s tax is just one kind? The one collected last time was headcount tax. But the one collected this time is spiritual energy tax! The inner city’s spiritual energy is ten times of the outer city. You all staying here, your cultivation speed is several times faster than others, could it be that you shouldn’t pay a bit of tax?”

Li-er’s face changed and she said, “How much do you want again this time?”

Zhou Wei smiled and said, “Not a lot, not a lot, two million will suffice!”

“Two million! Why don’t you go and rob us!” Li-er said, denouncing him.

Zhou Wei said coolly, “This is all the City Lord Manor’s rules. If you don’t pay, then sorry, you all might have to move out of the inner city.”

Yue Mengli’s expression flickered incessantly. She really could not take out that many divine essence stones anymore.

She drew a deep breath, seemingly making a very big resolve, and said, “Fine, we’ll move out!”

“No way! Sister-in-law, you stay, we’ll go!” White Light said.

“Elder Sister Li-er, you can’t go!” Lu-er also said.

Li-er said, “You guys don’t need to say anymore, my mind is made up! Everyone pack up, we’ll leave right now!”

Zhou Wei had a smug look and said, “Huhu, that’s more like it. Ants like you guys are only fit to go stay in the outer city or capital cities. An inch of land in the inner city is like an inch of hold, you all staying here is simply a waste.”

Facing Zhou Wei’s reproving, the few people just endured it.

Packing up for a while, and then the few people were just about to head out when suddenly, a burst of powerful aura surged to the sky from the Martial Tower’s direction.

The entire imperial city’s spiritual energy swarmed over frenziedly in the direction of the Martial Tower.

At this time, the spiritual energy in that direction seemed to be drained by a pump. The other directions’ spiritual energy poured over there crazily.

“Mn? What’s going on? Someone is breaking through?” White Light said in surprise.

“Who’s breaking through? To actually be able to create such a terrifying effect?” Long Zhan also revealed a shocked expression.

Zhou Wei’s expression also changed slightly, but he snorted coldly and said, “Whoever breaks through is none of your business! Could it be that it’s Ye Yuan breaking through? Heh heh, this commotion, even a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse likely can’t match up too. Quickly get lost, this place isn’t a place that you all should stay!”

At this moment, the entire imperial city was startled.

This breakthrough was like an enormous pump, frenziedly plundering the spiritual energy in all directions.

“What’s going on? Could it be some elder who broke through?”

“This commotion, even fourth or fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord probably can’t match up too, right?”

“Just who is breaking through, this is also too crazy, right? So much spiritual energy entering the body, even Divine Lord Realm powerhouses will burst too!”

...

Countless martial artists were swarming in the direction of the Martial Tower, wanting to see who it was, causing such a terrifying commotion when breaking through.

Seeing Yue Mengli stalling and not moving, Zhou Wei’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “You guys are not leaving yet, could it be that you want this protector to personally send you all out?”

Yue Mengli still did not move. She suddenly opened her mouth and said, “It’s Big Brother Yuan! It’s Big Brother Yuan breaking through! He came back!”

Zhou Wei’s expression changed and he scolded angrily, “What nonsense are you saying?! Ye Yuan already died in the spatial inheritance, so how can he possibly be breaking through? Moreover, can this commotion be an Origin Deity Realm martial artist breaking through?”

Yue Mengli turned and gave Zhou Wei a glance, and said coolly, “Zhou Wei, if it’s really Big Brother Yuan who came back and you still dare to chase us out, you should know the outcome!”

Zhou Wei’s face changed, and his heart involuntarily started racing.
