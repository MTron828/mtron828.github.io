Chapter 2777: Sacrificing One’s Life to Save Others!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Above the void, sword images permeated!

Ye Yuan’s one sword formation trapped 16 powerhouses!

Eight Legions War Generals, their strength was even a level stronger than that Zhao Ding.

Adding in the remaining branches’ alliance chiefs, this group of people’s strength was not weak!

If it was a melee, Ye Yuan’s side would definitely have a lot of casualties.

Especially the Eight Legions War Generals, the eight people seemed to be of one body, advancing and retreating together. Their combat power was not the slightest bit weaker than an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven too.

“True Soul Explosion!”

Ye Yuan borrowed the sword formation and arrived not far from an alliance chief. Suddenly, he shouted and executed the origin divinity attack on him.

That alliance chief’s figure turned sluggish, and he was immediately pierced through by more than a dozen transformed swords.

The dead body fell with a loud bang.

After breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, Ye Yuan’s chaos divine essence skyrocketed in strength and already reached peak middle Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Even if the other party cultivated the Vajra Dharma Body, it was difficult to withstand too.

Having Ye Yuan get close to you was a one-way road that led to death!

With Ye Yuan’s current origin divinity strength, he could execute origin divinity attack within 500 feet.

Coupled with an extremely fast movement technique, killing Saint Sovereign Heavens was not considered very hard to him.

Like chopping and dicing vegetables, the remaining eight alliance chiefs were killed off by Ye Yuan very soon.

However, the Eight Legions War Generals were extremely powerful.

Although they were being suppressed, they could barely manage to withstand the power of the sword formation.

“True Soul Explosion!”

Ye Yuan launched an origin divinity attack against one of them.

Suddenly, his expression changed, feeling that his origin divinity ran into a wall and actually suffered a backlash?

“A puppet? These eight people’s origin divinities actually linked up as one. When you launch an origin divinity attack against one of them, it’s equivalent to facing eight people at the same time! This guy’s means are indeed extraordinary!”

Suffering a hidden loss, it made Ye Yuan even more sure of Li Changsheng’s origins.

However, not being able to use origin divinity attacks was fine too.

Just using the All-Encompassing Sword Formation, Ye Yuan could eradicate the eight people too. It just took more time, that was all.

On the other side, Li Changsheng fought one-against-60, being beaten until he spewed three liters of blood.

Especially Big Yellow’s coquettish hoof, it simply came and went like a shadow, almost impossible to resist.

Everyone said that it was hard for two fists to fight four hands, unless one was strong until they could instantly kill those in the same rank. Otherwise, facing so many Saint Sovereign Heavens, they could only take a beating.

However, Li Changsheng was formidable too.

In front of the attacks that made mountains cry out and the seas howl, he actually managed to hold on.

“AHH!?You bunch of aboriginals, this exalt definitely won’t let you all off! Want to kill this exalt, then die together! Explode for me! Explode! EXPLODE!”

Suddenly, Li Changsheng roared wildly. A terrifying energy undulation made the expressions of all the Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse change one after another.

The auras on the Eight Legions War Generals became extremely unstable.

Their bodies started inflating all of a sudden like balloons being pumped with air.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed wildly, an extremely dangerous feeling assaulting him.

These guys were going to self-detonate!

“Quickly spread out!”

Ye Yuan roared wildly at the sky, his figure instantly disappearing.

The 60 Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses scattered and fled in all directions virtually at once.

However, it was already too late!

Bang, bang, bang?…

The bodies of the Eight Legions War Generals exploded with a loud bang. There seemed to be an additional sun above the sky!

A terrifying to the extreme energy filled every region of space.

There was no way of dodging at all!

This energy undulation was enough to blow a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven to death too!

Furthermore, it was an indiscriminate attack.

“Damn it! C-Can’t escape it!”

The faces of those Saint Sovereign Heavens were full of despair. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Everything happened too suddenly. They had no chance to escape at all.

While right at this time, a giant mountain suddenly appeared out of thin air, blocking everyone’s figures!

Boom!

The intense explosion directly blasted the giant mountain away.

A terrifying air billow blew everyone away.

“Huah!”

Ye Yuan directly vomited a large mouthful of blood, his figure whirling away into the distance like a kite with a broken strength.

Li Changsheng suffered the aftermath of the shock too and directly spewed out a mouthful of blood.

However, he laughed wildly and said,?“Hahaha?… Fool, to actually help this bunch of trash block the disaster, bearing most of the explosion himself! This exalt is leaving! Boy, I’ll definitely seek revenge for this enmity!”

After he was done talking, Li Changsheng’s figure flashed, and he directly escaped into the void.

If Ye Yuan really wanted to leave, he could have left.

But at that moment just now, Ye Yuan used the Myriad Realms Mountain and blocked most of the explosion’s power.

Otherwise, at least half of the Saint Sovereign Heavens present or more would probably have to die!

“Master Ye!”

Big Yellow’s expression changed wildly, chasing after Ye Yuan in haste.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s figure flashed, and he disappeared!

Big Yellow’s expression changed again!

Ye Yuan went to pursuit!

That explosion just now, Ye Yuan’s injuries must be extremely severe.

He actually disregarded his injuries and chased after Li Changsheng!

There was no one who could keep up with Ye Yuan’s speed here. They could only passively watch the two people disappear.

Looking in the direction Ye Yuan disappeared, Saint Exalt Waycloud sighed and said, “Younger Brother Ye is righteous!”

Just now, he was closest to the center of the explosion. If not for Ye Yuan tanking most of the attack, he would have long died.

Even so, he still suffered serious injuries.

Everyone nodded one after another, agreeing greatly with Waycloud’s words.

People were all selfish. Ye Yuan’s heart to seek revenge was stronger than anyone.

If he escaped by himself just now, then go chase after Li Changsheng, he would be able to face the opponent with his strongest combat power.

But he chose to save everyone!

At the moment of life-and-death, Ye Yuan could make such a decision. This was absolutely not what everyone could make.

At this moment, Ye Yuan used his actions and filled everyone with admiration!

However, they were also powerless to help Ye Yuan with anything anymore.

Although none of the Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses present died, the explosion earlier made them all sustain extremely serious injuries.

“I hope that Younger Brother Ye can succeed in taking revenge!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said with a sigh.

They knew that if they did not kill Li Changsheng this time, they probably would not be able to kill him anymore again.

A grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven, if he was at his peak state, even if it was Ye Yuan this heaven-defying existence, it was impossible to be his match too.

… …

On the other side, Ye Yuan chased after with all his strength while coughing blood.

His injuries were too severe. Even his consciousness was somewhat blurry already.

He used up all the heavenly imperial pills previously.

Now, he could only rely on his willpower to hold on.

But he understood that this was the one and only chance!

Letting Li Changsheng go, the consequences would be too dreadful to contemplate!

The explosion earlier, Li Changsheng suffered the aftermath too. Right now, he was very miserable too.

The two people, one in the front and one behind, their speed was quick to the extreme.

Li Changsheng was currently fleeing at high speed when suddenly, his expression changed, and he said in a cold voice, “This boy actually still chased after me!?Humph!?This aura is faintly discernible. He is already someone who’s about to die, and he actually still dares to chase after. You really think that this exalt can’t kill you?”

Although he said so, Li Changsheng did not dare to stop.

There were still many Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses at the back. If he was intercepted, he would really be dead for sure.

He could feel that Ye Yuan’s aura was very weak.

Clearly, the explosion earlier caused immense harm to Ye Yuan.

As long as he dragged it out, Ye Yuan might just die himself.
