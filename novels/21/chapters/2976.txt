Chapter 2975: Phoenix Nine Ensembles!

“H-How can this be? The Heavenly Phoenix God Exterminating Fist was actually blocked so easily?”

“Feng Ning’s strength is extremely strong among her peers. He actually doesn’t even need to make a move?”

“Even if he absorbed that little wench’s blood essence, he shouldn’t be so strong either, right?”

… …

The phoenix race’s Emperor Realm powerhouses were all shocked by Ye Yuan’s effortless force.

They naturally knew about bloodline martial artists, but no matter how strong bloodline martial artists were, it was also impossible to unleash the power of bloodline fully.

Otherwise, what was the true spirit race for?

Although Feng Qingxuan’s bloodline was heaven qian rank, after Ye Yuan fused with it, he could at the very most, unleash the power of battle god grade.

But Feng Ning’s bloodline was proper peak battle god grade. It was even a minor realm higher than Ye Yuan.

No matter what, Ye Yuan should not be so relaxed too.

But, the moment Ye Yuan made his move, it was too appalling!

Currently, Ye Yuan was just involuntarily emitting the aura of the phoenix race. His bloodline power was not displayed.

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “It’s impolite not to reciprocate. You should have a taste of my Heavenly Phoenix God Exterminating Fist too.”

Finished saying, the phoenix bloodline in his body erupted.

“Earth kun grade! A human actually reached earth kun grade! How is this possible?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I … I can just find a piece of tofu to commit suicide with!”

“What a strong bloodline aura, I … I’m so envious!”

… …

When the phoenix clan powerhouses saw this scene, they virtually wanted to cry.

A human’s phoenix bloodline was actually same level with Feng Ninesong!

This was too depressing!

The improvement of bloodline power was too difficult. They all, these people, were only left with envy and jealousy.

It was not that Ye Yuan intentionally held back. But, if he erupted with heaven qian grade bloodline, Feng Ning probably could not have even withstood a single move and would definitely have died on the spot.

Ye Yuan naturally did not mind killing people.

But, regarding this situation today, he was an outsider to begin with. As for who was right between Feng Qingxuan and Feng Ninesong, he did not know.

This kind of internal clan power struggle, it was hard to say who was right or wrong.

The reason why he was guarding here was merely because it was a transaction.

Ye Yuan had his own principles when doing things, so he did not want to kill people.

Otherwise, these people in front of him would have long died.

It was impossible for Feng Ninesong to be his match too.

In the next moment, Ye Yuan threw a punch out. It was amazingly indeed the Heavenly Phoenix God Exterminating Fist that Feng Ning executed just now!

Feng Ning’s pupils constricted, her mind in great shock!

Heavenly Phoenix God Exterminating Fist was the Fire Phoenix Clan’s secret technique. How did this guy know?

Furthermore, the power was even so strong!

Boom!

Feng Ning vomited fresh blood wildly, her figure flying several tens of thousands of feet out, all the bones in her body broken, looking extremely miserable.

However, her little life was spared.

All those present were dead silent.

The scene was somewhat wrong!

Originally thought that exterminating this human was just a matter of lifting a hand. Who knew that this kid did monstrous things time and again and was actually so troublesome.

Feng Ninesong’s expression was already frosty to the extreme as she said in a solemn voice, “Not only did you dare to secretly fuse with phoenix blood essence, you even dare to secretly learn my Fire Phoenix Clan’s secret technique. Today, this young lady will sentence you to death in the name of the Fire Phoenix Clan!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Miss, withdraw. I really don’t want to kill people. After that miss succeeds in her nirvanic rebirth, I’ll leave. At that time, I won’t mind if you all pursue her again.”

Feng Ninesong smiled coldly and said, “It’s too late to only beg for your life now!”

Ye Yuan was stupefied. Was this young lady misunderstanding something?

I was clearly warning, how did it become begging for my life when it reached you?

However, Feng Ninesong was no longer listening to his explanations. The peak earth kun grade bloodline in her body erupted, directly displaying her fire phoenix original form.

Got to admit, Feng Ninesong was very strong!

Compared to Feng Ning, she was quite a lot stronger.

Her strength was not in cultivation realm but an all-round powerful!

This was the strength bestowed by bloodline!

It was not without reason that the chaos true spirit lineage could stand at the apex of all the heavens.

“It’s the Phoenix Nine Ensembles! Looks like Lord Ninesong is genuinely enraged! That boy is dead for sure!”

“Heh,?my Fire Phoenix Clan’s Phoenix Nine Ensembles, only earth kun grade bloodline can barely manage to execute the powerful secret techniques! I want to see how this boy blocks!” Feng Ning said in anger.

“Phoenix Nine Ensembles, each ensemble is life and death! Nobody can rival this move!”

… …

A strange phoenix cry sounded out. Feng Ninesong soared in the sky, circling around indeterminately.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene without moving his gaze. The origin of blood in his body worked in concert with the phoenix bloodline, continuously analyzing this move.

He also felt the power of this move!

This move was even stronger than the dragon race’s Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist. It was the true core secret technique of the Vermilion Bird Clan.

Coupled with the origin of blood, Ye Yuan could distinctly feel that bloodline fluctuations of Feng Ninesong.

Observing the actions, understanding the meaning.

Feng Ninesong’s move did not have too many secrets in front of Ye Yuan.

“Boy, prepare to die!”

Feng Ninesong cried out, swooping down.

At this moment, the earth seemed to be burning.

The air became very red under the influence of the Phoenix Nine Ensembles.

And right at this moment, a phoenix phantom condensed and formed behind Ye Yuan, akin to the original body descending!

However, it was a Heavenly Phoenix God Exterminating Fist again.

“Heaven qian grade! My God, how is this possible?”

“It turns out that he even concealed his bloodline power. He actually reached heaven qian grade bloodline already!”

“I … F*ck me! Even a human can reach heaven qian grade bloodline, then what is our Fire Phoenix Clan for?”

… …

Feeling the bloodline power that erupted on Ye Yuan’s body, these Fire Phoenix Clan powerhouses actually felt ashamed of their unworthiness.

This human’s bloodline power flung them ten streets behind!

Without a doubt, what Ye Yuan fused with was Feng Qingxuan’s blood essence. But even so, how could a human possibly fuse with it 100%?

Boom!

Just as everyone was in shock, two phoenix phantoms collided together.

Feng Ninesong was shaken off, but Ye Yuan was directly blasted several thousand feet flying.

When he stabilized his figure, a trace of fresh blood flowed down the corners of his mouth.

Clearly, he was already injured.

Feng Ninesong’s heart shook wildly. This boy actually perfectly fused with the phoenix blood essence!

And he relied on the might of the bloodline power to forcibly withstand the Phoenix Nine Ensembles.

The pride in Feng Ninesong’s was being ravaged mercilessly.

“Lord Ninesong is mighty!”

“This boy dared to fuse with phoenix blood essence. Exterminate him!”

“This kid has exhausted all his tricks. Let him feel the wrath of our Fire Phoenix Clan!”

… …

Feng Ninesong winning, the envious and jealous Fire Phoenix powerhouses danced with joy.

So what if bloodline was strong? Your cultivation realm was low!

“Boy, do you know that you’ve committed my Fire Phoenix Clan’s taboo? Today, you’ll definitely die!” Feng Ninesong said coldly.

She was jealous too!

Her bloodline power had already reached the limit and could not be improved anymore.

But this human punk actually perfectly fused with heaven qian grade bloodline!

Where would she, this Fire Phoenix Clan’s proud heaven’s chosen, put her face?

In the next second, the Phoenix Nine Ensembles started again!

Boom!

Ye Yuan was injured again!

Three attacks in a row, each stronger than the last, Ye Yuan responded to them with the Heavenly Phoenix God Exterminating Fist.

But, after the third time, Feng Ninesong’s moves underwent samsara, executing the first ensemble.

Ye Yuan knew that this Feng Ninesong only knew or could only display three ensembles!
