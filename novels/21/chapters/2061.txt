Chapter 2065: It’s You All Who Haven’t Seen Much of the World

The void vibrated, several young girls fluttering with immortal qi slowly walked out.

The girl in the front was dressed in clothes whiter than snow. Although she was not a beauty, she was also quite pretty. It was just that there was an additional trace of viciousness between her brows, giving people a feeling of keeping strangers away.

The few people strained their eyes and looked into the distance. A large-scale city rose up from the ground ahead, looking magnificent.

Beside the white-clothed girl, one of them said, “Senior Apprentice Sister Xun, this is the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City that Little Junior Sister said, right? I didn’t expect that a mere imperial city is actually so magnificent too!”

Mentioning that Little Junior Sister, a hint of disdain and mockery flashed across in her eyes.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun pursed her mouth and said scornfully, “A mere imperial city made so luxuriously, the person managing affairs must like to do grandiose things to impress people, not making any contributions. Humph! I get angry at the mention of that wretched girl! If not for her, we also wouldn’t have needed to travel across the Heavenspan Mountain and run to the Southern Border from the Northern Border.”

The pretty junior apprentice sister smiled and said, “That wretched girl feels that she has the Profound Yin Divine Physique and looks down on Eldest Senior Sister. Master’s kindness toward her is as weighty as a mountain, but she doesn’t think about repaying it, and even wanted us senior apprentice sisters to run here from far away to capture people! Really damn it! When we capture the person she’s in love with, we’ll have to teach him a good lesson.”

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun did not express anything and just said coolly, “Come on, enter the city first before talking. Figure out that kid’s situation first. Otherwise, if we beat the grass and startle the snake, it wouldn’t be good if he runs.”

The party of five followed the crowd and entered Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Only after entering the city did the five people detect Heavenly Eagle’s prosperity. It actually did not lose to ordinary imperial capitals. This made them very surprised.

Compared to the number of martial artists here, this city was not big, but appeared too small. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Senior Apprentice Sister Xun, is this really a little imperial city? Why do I feel like this place is even more flourishing than the average imperial capital?” The pretty junior apprentice sister looked left and right and said in surprise.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun frowned and said, “This place has medicine shops in great numbers, alchemy prevalent, looks rather like an alchemy holy land. That girl said before that her little lover is an alchemist. Looks like it matches. There’s an inn ahead. Let’s go over and inquire about it.”

The few people entered an inn and found a table next to a window and sat down.

When the waiter came over, the pretty junior apprentice sister hurriedly asked, “Waiter, I see that your Heavenly Eagle Imperial City seems to have a lot of alchemists!”

The moment the waiter heard, he could not help saying with a proud look, “Ladies, you came from other places, right? Huhu, our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City is the Southern Border’s number one alchemy holy land. If you want to request for pills, then you came to the right place.”

The moment the few junior apprentice sisters heard this, they could not help snickering.

The pretty junior apprentice sister said in amusement, “Number one in the Southern Border? A little imperial city also dare claim to be the Southern Border’s number one? Your place is remote and has probably never seen before how big the world outside is, right?”

Her meaning was saying that Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s people had never seen much of the world.

It was just that the pretty junior apprentice sister’s laughing made everyone around her laugh instead.

“Little girl, not that we haven’t seen the world. It’s that you all haven’t seen how big the world is! You go out and inquire and you’ll know that our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City is number one in this Southern Border. I guarantee this is the truth!”

“Haha, even if Seven-star Alchemy Gods arrived at our Heavenly Eagle, they also have to bend their backs and walk!”

“Little girl, do more homework before going out. Otherwise, you’ll become a joke when you reach the place!”

...

There were kind laughters all around. But it was incomparably ear-piercing to these few people.

The pretty junior apprentice sister’s face turned red and was about to fly off the handle, but she heard Senior Apprentice Sister Xun cough lightly.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun looked at the waiter and asked, “This little brother, since your place here is an alchemy holy land, then have you heard of a young man called Ye Yuan before?”

As if afraid that the waiter had not heard of him before, Senior Apprentice Sister Xun added, “Heard that his age isn’t old, his alchemy skills ... should still be passable.”

The moment these words came out, the whole place was silent. Extremely strange looks appeared on everyone’s faces.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun and everyone immediately also realized that something was wrong. Could it be that her words violated some taboo?

But they did not take it to heart. A mere imperial city, even if it violated some taboo, what could they do to her?

“Why? Did this young lady say something wrong?” Senior Apprentice Sister Xun asked curiously.

The waiter revealed a strange look and said, “That’s not it, however ... if Lord Ye’s alchemy skill is still passable, then other alchemists can find a piece of tofu to commit suicide with.”

“Oh? In that case, he’s very impressive?” Senior Apprentice Sister Xun did not take it seriously and asked coolly.

She was already very convinced that the people of this imperial city developed a wildly arrogant personality because it was too out-of-the-way.

Think that they were invincible under the heavens with a few formidable alchemists in the city.

Ignorance was truly terrifying!

She had still heard of the Southern Border’s alchemy world before. The most powerful ones were Empyrean Pilljade as well as the leaders of the six great holy lands.

When was it a puny little imperial city’s turn to assume hegemony?

The waiter smiled and said, “Impressive? Huhu, more than just impressive! Tell you this then. Even if Seven-star Alchemy Gods came, they would also have to respectfully call His Excellency ‘grandmaster’!”

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun pursed her mouth, a disdainful look on her face.

This bunch of country bumpkins was truly wildly conceited to the extreme!

But the waiter was not aware at all and said without caring about others, “Heh heh, turns out that you want to meet Lord Ye. Then you all came to the right place. If it’s at other places, you really can’t meet him. But Lord Ye likes our shop and frequently comes to patronize our shop. Eh, what a coincidence, Lord Ye is here!”

The waiter shot a glance and just happened to see a young man bringing two followers downstairs, coming up the inn slowly.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s gaze turned intent, a hint of joy flashing across in her eyes.

It was truly wearing out iron shoes in a fruitless search and finding it by chance without even looking for it!

When the waiter saw that Ye Yuan came, he hurriedly went over to greet. Ye Yuan already went up the second floor.

“Haha, Lord Ye is here, the box room is already prepared, Your Excellency please enter.” The waiter said with a broad grin.

Ye Yuan casually fished out a piece of high-grade divine essence stones and threw it to the waiter, saying with a smile, “Thanks for the trouble. Take this.”

The waiter received it with a chuckle and said smilingly, “Thank you, Your Excellency, for the reward!”

At this time, the second floor’s guests all stood up and gave a bow towardsYe Yuan, shouting in unison, “Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a laugh, “All sit, all sit. This Ye’s mouth was just feeling itchy and came to have some dishes.”

Everyone laughed and all sat down.

Ye Yuan being close to the civilians was known to all in Heavenly Eagle. Hence, everyone did not mind and were also not scared that they would affront Ye Yuan.

Rather, when Ye Yuan glimpsed and saw Senior Apprentice Sister Xun five people, his brows could not help furrowing.

These few people concealed their cultivation and seemed ... to have enmity towards me?

No time for him to think too much either, Senior Apprentice Sister Xun five people already got up.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun used a tone of looking down from a height and said coolly, “You’re Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “It’s precisely this Ye.”

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun continued, “Then do you know Lu-er?”

When Ye Yuan heard that, his expression changed wildly.

When Senior Apprentice Sister Xun saw Ye Yuan’s expression, she was immediately certain and said indifferently, “Looks like I’m right. Lian Xin, take him down.”
