Chapter 2234: Bluffed Them

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

... ...

One after another, there were miserable screams coming over non-stop.

One Empyrean after another was directly sucked in the blood pools.

The Empyreans had panicky looks. They could not see the opponent at all.

Wu Jiang’s expression was very ugly, and he said in a solemn voice, “This place is normally just the activity area of rank six powerhouses. Why did so many damn things pop out now suddenly?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered and he said, “A precious treasure coming into being. Having this kind of phenomena is also normal. Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil, activate!”

Ye Yuan had transcended seven Nirvanic Tribulations. The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil had long been cultivated to an extremely high realm already.

At this time, the moment the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil activated, the world immediately became different.

Amidst the bloody light, one gray figure after another was moving about everywhere.

These guys were hidden in the bloody light, the bloody light became their natural protective defense.

Even for Empyreans, it was very hard to discover them too.

Whoosh!

One of the gray figures suddenly shot out, flying toward Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade.

But Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade was completely clueless.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp, and he cried out coldly, “Sword of will, chop!”

A transparent sword instantly condensed and chopped toward that gray figure with inconceivably swift speed.

“Yike!”

That gray figure emitted a strange cry and tunneled back into the blood pool with a whoosh.

Hearing the strange cry from behind, Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade was greatly startled, only then, knowing that he had gone to the gates of hell and came back.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s gaze flickered slightly and marveled with admiration. “Such condensed soul force, almost turning corporeal! His divine soul has likely already reached grand completion rank seven! This boy isn’t simple!”

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn sneered and said, “So what if grand completion rank seven? How long can he still live in this place?”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives nodded and said, “The stronger he is, the better it is for us naturally! With him around, at least we can take action later. With the blood pool having unusual changes, there will be quite a number of good stuff that will come out. But correspondingly, it would also be a lot more dangerous.”

The other Heavenly Emperors nodded one after another, deeply feeling that way too.

Ye Yuan made a move to slay that gray shadow and stopped taking action.

Let things drift if they did not affect one personally.

Under such circumstances, standing out in the limelight did not have any good outcome.

If not for saving Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade, he definitely would not have taken action.

From time to time, there were still Ghost Dao powerhouses that were directly dragged into the blood pools.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives pointed at Ye Yuan and opened his mouth and said, “You, go and take care of those gray shadows!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “If I say no?”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s tone carried a majesty that did not allow questioning as he said coolly, “Not taking action, you die!”

Clearly, with the eyesight of these Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, they could see those gray shadows.

It was just that none of them were willing to make a move.

These gray shadows were all soul bodies, killing all of them required tremendous expenditure of soul force.

The Heavenly Emperor powerhouses clearly wanted to preserve their strength to deal with those dangers at the back.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives speaking had much greater weight than Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn.

After all, he was a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor super powerhouse!

By the side, Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn smiled coldly and said, “Brat, being a cannon fodder has to have the awareness of being a cannon fodder! Go or die!”

These Heavenly Emperor powerhouses did not care at all, directly putting it out on the table.

In front of them, Empyrean powerhouses could only be cannon fodders.

Empyrean powerhouses dominated the secular world.

But in front of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, they were still ants!

Ants did not have the qualifications to negotiate terms!

Ye Yuan’s expression flickered indeterminately but did not take action after a long time.

Wu Jiang’s expression changed slightly, and he urged, “Brother Ye, preserving your life is important. We can’t afford to provoke Heavenly Emperor powerhouses!”

Finally, Ye Yuan’s tightly clenched fists loosened. He slowly turned around, his figure moving, directly catching up to a gray shadow.

“Sword of will, kill!”

Ye Yuan’s sword of will was incomparably swift and fierce. One sword landed. It directly slaughtered that gray shadow.

His figure moved swiftly, attacking like lightning, killing more than ten gray shadows in a blink of an eye.

When those gray shadows saw that they were unable to hide their figures anymore, each and every one of them hid inside the blood pools and no longer bubbled.

When the Empyreans saw that Ye Yuan was so ferocious, each and every one of them was extremely frightened too.

If this sword of will were to chop on their bodies, it would be fatal!

Even though their bodies were long already corporeal, they were still soul bodies in the end.

This sword of will’s damage to them was even stronger than divine essence martial techniques.

Ye Yuan stopped, appearing somewhat dispirited and inert.

Those gray shadows were all rank seven soul bodies, their strength comparable to middle-stage Empyrean Realm.

Killing so many soul bodies, it was naturally somewhat ‘too much’ for Ye Yuan’s soul force to bear.

He looked at Heavenly Emperor Ninelives coldly and said, “Satisfied now?”

Finished talking, he sat down cross-legged, planning on recovering soul force.

But at this time, Ninelives said coolly, “Not need to recondition, carry on walking. Do you plan on making so many people wait for you to rest up?”

Done talking, he flicked his sleeves grandly and said, “Continue forward!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and suddenly stood up, assuming a posture like he was going to risk his life, but he was held back by Wu Jiang.

“Forget it, forget it! They are all Heavenly Emperors. We can’t afford to provoke them!” Wu Jiang urged.

These Heavenly Emperors did not view him as a person at all. They were simply ordering him about like a beast of burden!

Seeing Ye Yuan get deflated, Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn said with a smug look, “Huhu, brat, this place isn’t the place for you to act wildly! Got resentment, hold it in! Not stifling it ... you’ll die!”

The moment Heavenly Emperor Ninelives released his imposing aura, a terrifying pressure descended on Ye Yuan’s body.

“Still not moving? Do you really want to force this emperor to take action?” Heavenly Emperor Ninelives said coldly.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed several times. Finally, he still drew a deep breath, turned around, and left.

“Very good, I’ve remembered this!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

“Huhu, he’s threatening us! An Empyrean is threatening Heavenly Emperors!” Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn laughed in spite of himself.

“His strength is indeed pretty good. Just that his brain is a little flawed, can’t understand the situation,” Heavenly Emperor Zhao Hun said coolly.

Another Heavenly Emperor said with a cold face, “Reckless and blind thing! If not for being a little useful, this emperor would have long killed him!”

Toward Ye Yuan’s threat, they naturally would not take it to heart.

In their view, making you all be cannon fodders, you would have to endure it!

In fact, you even had to express a thousand thanks!

Putting on airs, you don’t have that qualification.

“Young Master, are ... are you alright? It’s all me who’s useless!” Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade said with self-reproach.

Ye Yuan gave a wink and transmitted his voice, “I’m fine. I’m just bluffing them.”

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade was startled in his heart, looking at Ye Yuan with a shocked face.

How was this possible? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

That degree of soul force expenditure earlier, even ordinary late-stage Empyreans would find it somewhat too much to bear, let alone Ye Yuan?

How could he know that Ye Yuan’s divine soul was incomparably condensed to begin with?

After essence, energy, and spirit three paths fused into one, his divine soul was even formidable to the extreme, far surpassing those in the same rank.

Previously in the Immortal Grove World, in front of Ji Zhengyang’z grave, Ye Yuan’s thoughts flowed smoothly, his heart realm reached perfection, and his divine soul even already reached the grand completion realm of rank seven.

This degree of consumption was nothing at all to Ye Yuan.

In the process of advancing, with Ye Yuan absorbing some more carnage energy and converting it to soul force, it would be able to make up for the deficit.

Facing seven great Heavenly Emperors, it was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to display all of his trump cards.

Therefore, he definitely feigned an appearance of his soul force being depleted.
