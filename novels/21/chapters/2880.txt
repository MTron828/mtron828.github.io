Chapter 2886 Heavy Grooming!

“This little Bloodazure absolutely has the look of a Hegemon! Big Bloodazure also has very high hopes of reaching Hegemon Realm!” “I heard that the clan has already let Little Bloodazure go and comprehend the Chaos Bloodstone! It means that the Blood God Temple is also very optimistic about him!”

“Indeed, that boy is too monstrous! After he breaks through to Hegemon Realm, the Absolute Heaven Barrier will surely be breached!”

... ...

Two people having the same name Bloodazure amazed the world with their brilliant feats, shocking the blood race.

This matter became a legend.

Hence, everyone called the higher cultivation realm Yang Qing as Big Bloodazure and the lower cultivation realm Ye Yuan as Little Bloodazure.

The appearance of two great Hegemon candidates made the blood race boil over with excitement.

Yang Qing was good. The blood race’s powerhouses had already boasted Ye Yuan to the heavens.

Actually, the Heaven One Alliance was grooming Hegemon Realm powerhouses. How was the blood race not nurturing Hegemon Realm powerhouses too?

As long as there were sufficient Hegemon Realms, the Absolute Heaven Barrier would no longer be a problem.

This was the fundamental way.

As for South Qi Giant City, that level of battle, it was actually merely a petty brawl.

The blood race would not care about a few people dying.

But they cared a lot about geniuses with the potential to step into Hegemon Realm.

Selecting the hundred sons, forming a powerful competitive mechanism in the clan, all these were in order to give birth to even more Hegemon Realms.

At this time, within the Blood God Temple, it was a flourishing scene too.

“Congratulations, Wang Zuo! Congratulations, Wang Zuo! Our blood race has gained another genius!”

“This Little Bloodazure’s light simply can’t be concealed at all! With his bloodline strength, stepping into Hegemon Realm is virtually a sure bet!”

“This guy is absolutely a character who’ll suppress an era! Our blood race is mighty!”

“Such a genius roaring into existence, our blood race isn’t far from unifying all the heavens!”

In the Blood God Temple, many Emperor Realm powerhouses were extremely excited.

Ye Yuan’s appearance was absolutely a figure who would suppress an era.

This kind of character was not frequently seen.

Even Lord Wang Zuo did not count as suppressing an era too!

Before Lord Wang Zuo grew up, he still had many competitors.

Although those competitors were surpassed by him in the end, to say that he was invincible in the world, it was not counted.

If one had to say, the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s final palace master was more apt!

Ye Yuan was such a genius!

This kind of figure appearing, it was naturally a sign of victory for the blood race.

Everyone was naturally happy too.

“Huhu, Owlfly, you’ve done pretty well this time! Later, you can go and comprehend the Chaos Bloodstone for ten days too!” Lord Wang Zuo said with a laugh.

Owlfly could not help being wildly elated when he heard it!

Chaos Bloodstone, that was his long cherished

goal!

Today, he was finally getting his wish!

Hopefully, after comprehending the Chaos Bloodstone, he would be able to find the opportunity to break through the Hegemon Realm and soar to the heavens with one bound!

At that time, wouldn’t the few of you trash still have to grovel at this seat’s feet?

“Many thanks, Lord Wang Zuo!” Owlfly said with wild ecstasy.

Wang Zuo nodded his head and to Ye Wugui, “Wugui, Bloodazure’s matter will be left to you! You have to ensure his safety, but don’t let him become a flower in a greenhouse, understood?”

Ye Wugui nodded his head and said, “Lord Wang Zuo, rest assured; Wugui understood what should be done!”

With regards to Ye Yuan’s grooming, the Blood God Temple had already made arrangements.

Allowing him to be and at the same time give him adequate resource guarantee!

What could be given to him, Lord Wang Zuo absolutely would not be stingy!

Hence, that was how Ye Yuan obtained the opportunity to comprehend the Chaos Bloodstone.

One had to know, Owlfly this grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse was only given ten days. It could be seen how valuable the chance to comprehend the Chaos Bloodstone was.

But Ye Yuan, a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, Wang Zuo gave him a month!

It was just that Wang Zuo never dreamed that the genius he was exerting all his effort to nurture was precisely the Ye Yuan that he hated to the core!

The current Ye Yuan was extremely delighted!

The blood race’s hidden stash really broadened people’s horizons!

All kinds of natural treasures appeared in a dazzling array in the Blood God Temple’s warehouse, making Ye Yuan’s eyes blur.

Among them, there were many items that were the specialty products of the other two continents. They could not be found on Heaven One Continent at all.

Ye Yuan had only seen these things in the Hundred Herbs Illustrated Handbook before.

But there were many here!

Ye Yuan was not courteous either, directly keeping these precious heavenly medicines.

By the side, the guard’s face was twitching.

This guy was really not courteous, specifically picking the good stuff to take!

But, thinking about it, he felt at ease too.

If they could give birth to a Hegemon Realm that suppressed the contemporary era, what did these natural treasures count for?

“Relax. After I break through to Hegemon Realm, I’ll lead the blood race to roam the myriad worlds unobstructed! At that time, you’ll turn your nose up at these lousy things!” Ye Yuan said to the guard.

The guard smiled and said, “Huhu, then this seat is really looking forward to the arrival of that day!”

The strength of the Treasure Depository Pavilion’s guard was naturally not ordinary.

This one in front of him was an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse!

After collecting a whole bunch of heavenly medicines, Ye Yuan took an astronomical figure of heavenly crystals. Then he went to the blood pool.

The Blood God Temple’s blood pool was much smaller.

But Ye Yuan could feel that its effect was more than ten times stronger than Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City’s!

How blessed!

The moment Ye Yuan entered the blood pool, the hundred sons went completely crazy.

The energy in their blood pool was currently being plundered by Ye Yuan crazily.

Their eyes turned green.

“F*cking hell, do you still want people to live or not?”

“F*ck, the benefits all got seized by you! Are you finished yet?” “Your Father narrowly escaped death before obtaining the hundred sons spot, and only obtained the chance to enter the blood pool after going through all kinds of hardships and difficulties! I beg you, save some of us!”

......

Sound of cursing words echoed in the blood pool.

But Ye Yuan did not care that much at all. He just plundered crazily.

Nurturing the Dao sword required massive amounts of blood essence source.

And the Blood God Temple’s blood pool was purer and more refined.

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword was currently rapidly growing toward peak Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Finally, Ye Yuan’s Dao sword was saturated and seriously could not absorb any more.

The next time, Ye Yuan was going to make preparations to break through to True Sovereign Heaven.

And the Blood God Temple’s blood pool was already drained by Ye Yuan.

Everyone’s gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was filled with hatred. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This guy was simply walking other people’s path, leaving others with nowhere to walk!

Breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven, this was a huge hurdle, Ye Yuan needed to be prudent too.

Although he currently had the power of blessing augmenting himself, it did not mean that he could ignore the Dao tribulation.

Currently, he was using the Blood Imitation Pill to conceal his body’s aura, hiding from the probing of Heavenly Dao.

But, once he recovered his human identity, it would immediately call down Dao tribulation.

Furthermore, this time, it would definitely come together with the upper Saint Sovereign Heaven one.

That power would be no trifling matter!

Hence, Ye Yuan was currently suppressing his realm and not planning to break through.

At present, Ye Yuan still had an even more important thing to do, that was to go and experience this Chaos Bloodstone!

This thing was the blood race’s mother stone, its power was naturally extraordinary.

Perhaps he could find the secrets of the blood race from it.

Under Ye Wugui’s lead, Ye Yuan entered a void space.

Upon entering the space, Ye Yuan seemed to have had his acupoints hit by someone, freezing in stupefaction!
