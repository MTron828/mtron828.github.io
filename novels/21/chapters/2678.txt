Chapter 2684: Mysterious Summoning!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Land of Dragon Slumber, it was an enormous karst cave at the bottom of the sea.

Standing in front of the karst cave, Ye Yuan felt that the blood in his body was boiling.

Ye Yuan attempted to suppress it, but could not do it at all.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, what’s wrong with you?” Little Dragon Girl asked a little curiously.

“I feel that there seems to be something calling me in this Land of Dragon Slumber.” Ye Yuan said.

“Hah,?do you really take yourself to be a true dragon? Land of Dragon Slumber has been sleeping here for at least ten thousand years. Why would it summon you? Idiot!” Youqing said with a cold smile on his face.

“Brother Youqing, perhaps he really has a deep relationship with this Land of Dragon Slumber! Really enviable!” Muchen similarly sneered as he said.

“Huhu,?he’s demonstrating how he’s different from the rest! We all can’t feel the Land of Dragon Slumber’s summoning, only he can feel it, how impressive! I’ve also never heard before that who in our seven great sea regions have felt before the Land of Dragon Slumber’s calling! Impressive! Impressive!”

… …

Ye Yuan’s words immediately drew laughter from the crowd.

In their view, the Land of Dragon Slumber was a dead place. How could it possibly summon Ye Yuan?

Especially Youqing, he was directly pressed to the ground by Ye Yuan a few days ago.

This was simply unprecedented humiliation to him.

If he could, he would immediately kill Ye Yuan now.

Actually, the ones who entered the Land of Dragon Slumber this time were not just the seven great royal clans. There were also many tribal powerhouses.

It was just that they did not have the qualifications to enter the banquet; that was all.

These tribal powerhouses, some of them were quite strong, even reaching the realm of Jade Sovereign Heaven already!

Youqing was afraid of Ye Yuan’s poison, but he had some Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses by his side too, which was sufficient to kill Ye Yuan.

It was just that in front of Black Flood Dragon King, it was not convenient for him to take action.

Youqing already made up his mind. After entering the Land of Dragon Slumber, the first thing he would do was to kill Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan ignored everyone’s ridicule. The blood in his body was already somewhat going out of control.

Under the watchful gazes of the people, Ye Yuan involuntarily moved closer to the Land of Dragon Slumber.

One step, another step.

It was not Ye Yuan taking the initiative, he could not help it.

The calling from the depths of the Land of Dragon Slumber was getting stronger and stronger.

When Youqing saw this scene, he sneered even more as he said, “You guys, look, this guy is planning on entering first in order to prove the summoning of the Land of Dragon Slumber!?Hahaha?…”

“Roar!”

Youqing’s voice had yet to fade when a blood-red dragon qi rose up from Ye Yuan’s body.

The blood red dragon qi condensed into a giant red dragon in the deep sea.

“HAH!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was also at this moment that Ye Yuan roared, the aura on his body surging to the sky.

Everyone’s laughter abruptly ceased.

Because Ye Yuan was about to break through!

In reality, he already reached peak Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum when he broke through the last time and could break through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum at any time.

However, Ye Yuan was afraid that his cultivation realm would be unstable, so he kept suppressing it and did not break through.

Just now, all the blood in Ye Yuan’s body seethed once again under that mysterious power’s calling.

His cultivation realm actually broke through involuntarily!

This sort of feeling was almost the same as when he sensed the Emerald Sea Divine Conch back then.

At that time, Ye Yuan was very confused too. He did not know why he had this kind of feeling with the Emerald Sea Divine Conch.

But now, he understood!

The Emerald Sea Divine Conch must have originated from the Land of Dragon Slumber.

“Hehehe?…”

Little Dragon Girl let out a burst of silver-bell-like laughter and said to Youqing, “Big Brother Youqing, didn’t you say that it’s impossible for the Land of Dragon Slumber to summon Big Brother Ye Yuan? Now, he hasn’t even entered the Land of Dragon Slumber and he directly broke through!”

Youqing’s expression was livid, a look of disbelief on his face.

How could this guy possibly break through directly?

Furthermore, the blood dragon that was wandering continuously in the sky above the Land of Dragon Slumber made it clear to all that Ye Yuan had indeed felt the calling of the Land of Dragon Slumber!

This dragon qi was really so strong!

“Could it be that he really felt the summoning of the Land of Dragon Slumber? How is this possible?”

“The Land of Dragon Slumber would actually take the initiative to summon a human?”

“What capability does this boy have, to actually be able to get the Land of Dragon Slumber’s summoning?”

… …

The powerhouses who were still ridiculing Ye Yuan just now, could not laugh anymore at this time.

Ye Yuan’s breakthrough was like a resounding slap, slapping onto their faces.

It turned out that Ye Yuan really felt the Land of Dragon Slumber’s summoning!

And it was precisely because of this that the sea race powerhouses present were even more green with envy!

Especially the dragon race powerhouses, they were even more jealous.

This Land of Dragon Slumber was the place where a true dragon slumbered in the legends.

The greatest wish of the seven great sea regions’ dragon race was to be able to evolve into a true dragon one day.

But they had never obtained the Land of Dragon Slumber’s show of favor before.

Not only that, the powerhouses of the seven great sea regions that died in the Land of Dragon Slumber were beyond counting.

But, what right did a brat that came from the human race have, to directly break through a major realm before even entering the Land of Dragon Slumber?

When Black Flood Dragon King saw this scene, beyond the shock he was feeling, he was even more ecstatic in his heart.

The purer Ye Yuan’s bloodline was, the greater his hopes of breaking through!

Perhaps, after he absorbed Ye Yuan’s dragon marrow, he would be able to become a true dragon in the future, who knows?

“Mn??The Black Flood Dragon King wants to harm me?” Ye Yuan was shocked in his heart.

Currently, the dragon qi in his body had fused into one with the mysterious power that came from the depths of the Land of Dragon Slumber.

Every detail here could not escape his perception.

The Black Flood Dragon King was the most powerful existence among these people, and he was also the clearest existence in Ye Yuan’s perception.

Therefore, this tiny hint of killing intent that Black Flood Dragon King revealed was caught by him keenly.

Ever since coming to Thistle South Dragon Palace, Black Flood Dragon King could be considered to have conducted himself rather kindly.

But Ye Yuan did not expect that he actually concealed his intention so deeply.

If not for fusing with this mysterious power, he would not have been able to detect it.

“Humph!?I hope that you don’t make a move against me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind tearing down your Thistle South Dragon Palace!” Ye Yuan snorted coldly in his heart.

Black Flood Dragon King was Thistle South’s strongest powerhouse, a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. Ye Yuan was naturally not his match.

But, if Ye Yuan wanted to kill people, he might not be able to stop him either.

At this time, earth-shaking changes were currently happening in Ye Yuan’s small world.

Sublime Realm three heavens, Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum; it was actually the expanding and perfecting of the small world.

When he was in the Heavenspan World, the Chaos Heavenspan Canon that Ye Yuan created was completely based on the Heavenspan World.

But only after walking out of the Heavenspan World did Ye Yuan realize what was called as a real heaven!

The rules of the 33 Heavens were complicated and profound to the extreme.

Reaching Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, Ye Yuan felt that his small world no longer had a limit.

Formless, limitless!

The so-called Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Heaven without limit, Dao without limit!

Ye Yuan revolved according to the cultivation method of the Wordless Heavenly Skill. The boundary of the chaos world became blurry.

He could feel that his world was becoming more consolidated and stronger.

“The Wordless Heavenly Skill and my Chaos Heavenspan Canon are of the same lineage, well-deserving of being the cultivation method that could let Yan Jadetrue roam the Rainclear Continent unhindered! Even if I don’t use Great Dao Transformation now, my strength is two to three times that of those in the same rank too!” Ye Yuan said with joy..
