Chapter 3063: I Am “Heaven”!

“You’re interested in this kind of junk? Stop wasting time, hurry up and find something good!” When Yang Qing saw Ye Yuan dig out such an unremarkable thing, he could not resist urging.

The moment Ye Yuan saw the Heaven word, a hint of surprise flashed across in his eyes.

Although he had never been to the Labyrinth Divine Palace before, he was not unfamiliar with the Labyrinth Divine Palace at all.

Ye Yuan understood that those truly top powerhouses were all aiming for the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings.

What were the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings?

No one knew!

But Mi Tian knew that the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s rise was precisely because of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings!

And the last generation Labyrinth Divine Palace’s palace master, Hegemon Heavenless, relied on the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings and reached an inconceivable realm.

The 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings had a total of 12 scrolls.

The most important volume among them was the Heaven scroll.

A character for heaven was written on this goat-skin scroll.?Could this be the Heaven scroll?

Ye Yuan also did not expect that he actually found such a precious treasure in an unassuming side hall.

If it were others, when they saw this junk covered in dust, they would definitely turn their noses up at it.

......

But Ye Yuan cultivated the Eternal River’s chaos and had a sensitivity different from ordinary people toward some things.

The moment he laid eyes on the goat-skin scroll, he felt its extraordinariness.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan was someone with a great destiny in the first place. Coupled with the Extreme Medicine Sect’s blessing power, being luckier than others was very normal too. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Heh,?this isn’t some junk. We might have picked up a treasure!” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

When Yang Qing heard that, he sized it up carefully again and said disdainfully, “Screw off! Just this junk, I reckon that it’s just some lousy cultivation method recorded in it. You’re treating it as a treasure too?”

Ye Yuan said, “Do you know about the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings?”

Yang Qing was stupefied and said, “You wouldn’t tell me that this junk is the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, right? Got to be kidding! Who do you think you are? You can randomly pick up a treasure?”

Ye Yuan did not expect that Yang Qing really knew about it. Hence, he nodded his head and said, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, this is the Heaven scroll in the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings!”

Yang Qing looked at Ye Yuan like looking at a fool and said with a loud laugh, “The Heaven scroll is the most important volume in the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings. Even Great Beyond powerhouses will be moved! You’re telling me now that this junk is the Heaven scroll? Stop fooling with me. Do you take me to be a three-year-old child?”

Boom!

Right at this time, a loud noise came over.

The entire Labyrinth Divine Palace seemed to have started swaying.

Yang Qing’s expression changed, and he cried out in surprise, “Goodness me, there are really Great Beyond powerhouses! Could it be that they are all aiming for the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Apart from the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, what else can move them?”

Yang Qing looked at Ye Yuan with a look of contempt and said, “Then, you’re telling me that you picked up the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings??H-Hur hur … hur hur hur …”

The two people went out of the great hall only to see three figures standing in a triangle formation above the void. They were currently fighting until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open.

The three people carried the might of heaven and earth with every move and stance. Even the Supreme Hegemons who were fighting fiercely previously had already kept a good distance away too.

They could not afford to provoke!

Great Beyond powerhouses were too strong!

The black-robed middle-aged man said in a cold voice, “Old Man Endless! If you still don’t give up, you’ll definitely die here today!”

On the other side, a woman in a whiterobe similarly said fiercely, “Old Man Endless, hand over the Heaven scroll and I can spare you from death!”

Ancestor Endless was holding the Heaven scroll, his momentum unstoppable!

Fighting two-on-one, he actually did not show the slightest hint of getting defeated.

He actually snatched the Heaven scroll from Hegemon Ming Hui’s hands!

The Heaven scroll in his hand had an archaic Heavenly Dao aura that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life, giving people a soul-stirring feeling.

One look and it was clear that it was not ordinary!

“Haha,?Younger Sister Profound Ice, don’t say this kind of spiteful words! If I hand over the Heaven scroll, do you think that you can walk out of here today?” Ancestor Endless said with a loud laugh.

Hegemon Profound Ice snorted coldly and said, “Then don’t blame this younger sister for being merciless!”

Finished saying, the three people’s auras were released, and they actually clashed together again.

Below, Zhou Xianchen looked toward Ancestor Endless with a look of shock and muttered, “I didn’t expect that Ancestor actually personally took action! Just what is the Heaven scroll in his hand?”

Not far away from him, Zhang Hexin said with a cold laugh,?“Heh,?haven’t you heard before? The Labyrinth Divine Palace’s ultimate treasure, the first volume of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, it’s the Heaven scroll! It’s said that back then, Old Man Heavenless could only reach an inconceivable realm because he comprehended the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings fully! Do you think your ancestor will be moved by it?”

Zhou Xianchen’s entire body trembled, only then knowing what the thing that his ancestor was fighting over was.

Ancestor’s strength was unfathomable. But it was far too difficult to want to improve further.

This Heaven scroll was clearly his hope of advancement!

Hence, he secretly cheered Ancestor on, hoping that Ancestor would win.

And those Supreme Hegemons were long already extremely shocked!

This was because these three mighty Great Beyond powerhouses were actually humanity’s three supreme heavens’ three mighty Great Beyond Hegemons, Xiu Ming, Ling Hua, and Endless!

It was just that, the names that came out of their mouths were actually wrong!

“Why is Ancestor Endless calling Hegemon Ling Hua Hegemon Profound Ice?”

“Mn??Isn’t one of the palaces among the 12 Heavenly King Palaces the Profound Ice Heavenly King Palace? Could it be …”

“Also, they are calling Xiu Ming as Burning Sky. There’s a palace called Burning Sky Heavenly King Palace among the 12 Heavenly King Palaces too! This … This …”

“Could it be that the three of them are actually from the Labyrinth Divine Palace?”

“This is impossible! Back then, Hegemon Samsara led all the heavens and was said to have slaughtered the Labyrinth Divine Palace completely. How can there possibly still be remnant spawns?”

“Ancestor Endless is the Alchemy Dao’s number one person! Among the 12 Heavenly King Palaces, there’s one called True Pill Heavenly King Palace too! These three people’s identities are almost certain!”

… …

This deduction made everyone dumbfounded from shock.

No one could have expected that humanity’s three supreme heavens’ strongest people were actually from the Labyrinth Divine Palace!”

Today, the truth was finally revealed.

The truth of history was always complicated and confusing!

While at the other side, Yang Qing looked at Ye Yuan and laughed loudly as he said, “Ye Yuan, you say that it’s the Heaven scroll in your hand, right??Hahaha,?really too hilarious! If what’s in your hand is the Heaven scroll, then what’s that in Ancestor Endless’ hand? The items in the two of your hands completely can’t be mentioned in the same breath!?Hahaha?…”

Swoosh!

All of a sudden, Yang Qing felt like he had disappeared.

More accurately speaking, he was currently standing above the sky, overlooking everything!

Below, three Great Beyond powerhouses were currently in the heat of fierce fighting. Numerous powerhouses kept a good distance away. There was even a group of geniuses currently searching for treasures.

Every movement and action in this world fell into his eyes.

Of course, he even felt that another person existed beside him.

That person was Ye Yuan.

But he could only feel him and not see him.

This … What was going on?

“Ye Yuan, where are you?” Yang Qing’s heart shook wildly, and he could not resist asking.

“I’m right beside you! How do you feel now?” Ye Yuan’s voice came over.

Yang Qing drew a deep breath and said, “I feel like I’m the heaven right now! Everything in the world seems to be in my grasp! This … Could it be …”

“Yes, it’s the goat-skin scroll in my hand!” Ye Yuan’s voice came over again.
