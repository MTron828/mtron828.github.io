Chapter 2642: Driving Back the Enemy

“A way? What method can you have?” Su Peiyun said disdainfully.

But, just as she was talking, Ye Yuan already leaped and jumped into the sea.

At this time, those merfolk were merely a dozen over miles away from the boat.

With Ye Yuan jumping, he faced off against the merfolk army in virtually an instant.

This scene stupefied Huang Haoyan, Su Peiyun, and the rest.

“W-What does this guy want to do?” Su Peiyun said in surprise.

“Who cares about him! If he wants to seek death, it can’t be blamed on us! Let’s quickly go!” Huang Haoyan said.

The stupefied ones were not just them. There was also the merfolk army.

They never thought that there was actually someone who dared to jump down from the boat at this time!

Wasn’t this courting death?

Could it be that this boy was tired of living?

Ye Yuan looked at the merfolk leader and said coolly, “Give me face and give them a way out. How about it?”

The merfolk leader was enraged and said, “Where did this punk come from, to dare spout nonsense in front of this general! Smash over for me; tear him to shreds!”

Having received the order, each and every one of them in the army flashed their harpoons and spears, and they charged over toward Ye Yuan.

Several thousand people in a mighty contingent, this kind of power made the expressions of the few people on the ship change.

They knew that in this ocean, there would often be conflicts between races, the fighting was even more terrible than on the mainland.

But the interior of these races was incomparably united.

An army of 3000 humans was absolutely not the match for 3000 merfolk.

Let alone that there was only Ye Yuan alone facing them.

On the ship, a companion suddenly cried out in surprise, “I understand now! The method that he spoke of was to challenge the entire merfolk army by himself! Is this guy a moron?”

Su Peiyun two people were taken aback and also came back to their senses.

It was just that in their view, this was no different from courting death.

Su Peiyun rolled her eyes and said, “A fool who overestimates his own ability! Him coming to Thistle South Sea Region alone to roam is a very foolish behavior to begin with!”

The army got closer and closer to Ye Yuan. Finally, they clashed!

Boom!

Waves splashed!

Ye Yuan’s skinny figure was instantly engulfed by the army and seawater.

Huang Haoyan shook his head and said, “The ignorant is fearless! A shame, this guy didn’t even block for a second!”

With regards to Ye Yuan’s behavior of seeking death, Huang Haoyan and the rest did not have much pity.

What he found regrettable was that Ye Yuan could not tie down the merfolk army in the slightest.

The merfolk army was still rushing towards them.

But very soon, they discovered that something was not right.

The huge wave had been churning endlessly. Furthermore, it was extremely irregular; completely different from before.

And the speed of the army’s advance also gradually slowed down.

Suddenly, a figure rose into the sky, bringing along a pile of minced meat which exploded.

The eyes of the few people on the boat became wide-saucers!

However, this figure disappeared in a flash and landed in the merfolk army once more.

“I-Is my eyesight failing? Just now … was it that boy?” Huang Haoyan was shocked until he was even stammering when speaking.

Su Peiyun also had a look of shock as she said, “He … He actually didn’t die? That’s the merfolk army!”

Under the assault of an army of several thousand merfolk, not only did Ye Yuan not die, he actually still had the leeway to retaliate!

How could they not be shocked?

What was more, this guy was just a mere middle Greater Sublime Heaven!

Before long, the changes in the merfolk army became more and more apparent.

The army was already in utter disarray.

Huang Haoyan saw it clearly, the merfolk leader also had no choice but to lead his men to rush back to the central army.

Amidst the army and waves, a blood-stained white figure appeared and disappeared, appearing bizarre and mysterious.

The more Huang Haoyan and the rest watched, the more shocked they got. The more they looked, the more jittery they became.

This guy actually killed the entire merfolk army until they were in a sorry state with his power alone?

They naturally did not know that along with Ye Yuan comprehending spatial rule, coupled with this month of frenzied killing, he already comprehended the second form of Great Dao Transformation!

The form of the All-Encompassing Sacred Tree already grew into a seedling from a sprout!

The transformed swords already evolved from two to eight!

Furthermore, the power increased greatly!

Unless he similarly encountered second form powerhouses, otherwise, Ye Yuan was virtually invincible in Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Coupled with that Ye Yuan’s power was profound and his breath was drawn-out, as well as that he was highly proficient in Formation Dao.

It was also akin to flat ground in the army.

Unless a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse appeared, otherwise, to Ye Yuan, there was not much difference between killing one and killing a thousand.

However, in the eyes of Huang Haoyan and co who did not know the inside story, it was totally different.

At this time, his companion suddenly said, “Brother Haoyan, when that boy got on the ship before, his aura was very chaotic! Furthermore, he came over from this sea region. You look, so many true spirit seafolk died in this sea region, they wouldn’t have … all been killed by him, right?”

“Impossible!” Huang Haoyan seemed to have had his tail stepped on, nearly jumping up. Shaking his head repeatedly, he said, “So many seafolk, unless it’s a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum senior, otherwise, how can it be possible …”

Talking until here, he could not carry on speaking.

Because he knew that it was extremely likely!

At least, there was more than 90% probability!

If it was not Ye Yuan, that would also be too coincidental!

Turning back to look at those countless corpses, Huang Haoyan felt rather parched.

“He wouldn’t have killed all the way over, right?” Huang Haoyan looked at Su Peiyun and revealed a smile that was even uglier than crying.

When ordinary humans entered the sea, they would have many methods to evade these seafolk.

Unless one’s strength reached Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, otherwise, who dared to kill all the way over?

In the ocean, the numbers of the true spirit sea race simply could not be tallied.

Their numbers were hundreds, even thousands of times of the human race!

Furthermore, in the ocean, the strength of these seafolk increased greatly, far surpassing same rank humans.

Under this kind of circumstances, he killed his way over.

Even thinking about it felt scary!

The smile on Su Peiyun’s face did not look any better than Huang Haoyan’s.

In her heart, Huang Haoyan was the chosen one.

When Ye Yuan just appeared, she looked down on him from the bottom of her heart and her words were very unpleasant too.

In the end, he was unbelievably impressive.

Luckily, Ye Yuan did not have malicious intent. Otherwise, when she made a move to deal with Ye Yuan earlier, he would have directly killed her. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Just her bit of strength, it was really not enough to look at in front of Ye Yuan.

The merfolk leader cried out strangely repeatedly and disregarded his subordinates too, turning tail and running. He shouted,?“Wawawa!?This boy is too strong, we’re not a match! Quickly retreat! Quickly retreat!”

Ye Yuan seemed to be in his own backyard amidst the army of thousands.

Killing here and there, nobody could stop him at all!

The merfolk leader was extremely strong and barely managed to escape death. But one arm was severed by Ye Yuan too.

How could this merfolk leader still dare to continue fighting?

Came quickly, left quickly too.

With a howl, the merfolk army disappeared without a trace, only leaving behind a pile of corpses floating on the surface of the sea.

Ye Yuan’s movement technique was extremely fast. With a few ups and downs, he already caught up to the large ship.

When his figure landed on the deck again, the few people on the boat immediately tensed up fully.

This guy was simply a ruthless murderer!
