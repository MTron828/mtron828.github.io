Chapter 2341: Qin Hu, You’ve Screwed Me Over This Time!

“My greatest plus point is that I’m a man of my word! Furthermore, you seem to have forgotten. I said before to kill you until you don’t dare to go out of the city.”

Ye Yuan was very calm and did not feel surprised because Qin Hu brought a helper.

Furthermore, he felt very interested in this Mo Xi from listening to the other people’s discussions instead.

With regards to such a big point giver, it would not do if he was not interested either!

Mo Xi looked at Ye Yuan with a look of amusement and said with a light smile, “Huhu, kid, you really don’t know about the immensity of heaven and earth! The Primeval War Realm’s waters are much deeper than you think. You can’t play just because you’re talented!”

He naturally knew about Ye Yuan’s strength. It was just that fighting two-on-one, it was useless no matter how strong Ye Yuan was.

Ye Yuan looked at Mo Xi and suddenly said, “Your esteemed self is helping Qin Hu. Are you also going to kill this Ye until I don’t dare to go out of the city?”

Mo Xi could not help laughing as he said, “Of course! Qin Hu and I are extremely close friends in reality as well. You killed him once. So how can I make it easy for you? Your question was very moronic!”

But Ye Yuan smiled brilliantly and said, “That’s good then. I can set my mind at ease.”

The others were all speechless. This kid was too defenseless, he could still smile at this time!

Moreover, these words were indeed moronic enough!

You could set your mind at ease?

At ease about what?

“The two of you don’t go out of the city anymore in the future. Otherwise, if I see once, I’ll kill once!” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

“Hahaha ... Mo Xi, this kid probably still hasn’t figured out the situation until now! Looks like he’s underestimating you. Showcase your strength and let him take a look!” Qin Hu said with a loud laugh.

Mo Xi nodded his head and said coolly, “Okay!”

One mysterious and profound power of law after another suddenly descended, echoing around Mo Xi.

Earth, fire, water, wind!

It was another four kinds of power of laws!

Furthermore, these four kinds of power of laws were different from Qin Hu’s. They could form a perfect closed loop, the power unable to be mentioned in the same breath.

This Mo Xi’s strength was much stronger than Qin Hu’s!

At the same time, four beads of different colors slowly rose up, revolving around him.

The power of the four kinds of laws suddenly increased significantly again and also emitted a rhythmic tempo along with the four beads.

“These four beads are called the Four Directional Beads, a set of peak heavenly emperor spirit treasure! They correspond respectively to earth, fire, water, and wind, four kinds of power of laws, and are able to make my strength become a lot stronger! Kid, you try repeating those words earlier!” Mo Xi looked at Ye Yuan and said with a faint smile.

While on the other side, Qin Hu’s power of laws had already been released.

His entire cultivation was all on his sword, his strength also fearsome.

It was just that compared to Mo Xi’s Four Directional Beads, it was significantly lousier.

The two of them joining forces, it was hard to find a rival among this Cloudaid City’s Fourth Firmament Heavenly Emperors.

No matter how great Ye Yuan’s strength was, it was also impossible to be their match!

“Hahaha, kid, lost all hope, right? Mo Xi’s strength is even above mine! With the two of us teaming up, are you still harboring hopes of getting lucky in your heart?” Qin Hu said smugly.

Seeing Mo Xi’s strength, everyone was incredibly shocked.

Everyone only heard that he was impressive, but it seemed like his strength was very high. Earlier, they thought he was about the same as Qin Hu.

But looking at it now, that was not the case!

“So strong! I didn’t expect that Mo Xi’s strength is much stronger than Qin Hu’s!”

“This kind of power of laws doesn’t have the slightest flaws at all. Furthermore, with the augmentation of a peak heavenly emperor spirit treasure, its power is unimaginable!”

“No wonder it’s said that Mo Xi’s ranking is actually above Qin Hu’s. Looks like his god of war points were all used on these four beads!”

“This boy, not listening to the advice of the elderly, suffering is right ahead! Asked him to not get too greedy, but he wouldn’t listen!”

... ...

Many people present all started gloating over his misfortune. It was true that Ye Yuan’s strength was strong, but he did not listen to other people’s words.

They clearly had good intentions but were treated as ill-intent.

Actually, it was them who were thinking too much. Ye Yuan just wanted to get more god of war points, that was all.

And right at this time, Ye Yuan finally touched his swords.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh ...

Suddenly, a thousand over swords scattered all around, dancing wildly in the air.

Seeing this scene, Yang Ke’s entire body trembled, and he actually gave a low cry rather agitatedly, “He finally deployed his swords! I indeed didn’t guess wrongly! What he’s strongest at isn’t the physical body, but ... Sword Dao! No, wait, there’s also ... Formation Dao!”

A thousand over swords, it was impossible to just be Sword Dao.

A bunch of Empyrean spirit treasures smashing over, he could blast it to dregs with a punch, what was there still?

At this time, Yang Ke had a strong feeling that he might be witnessing the birth of a miracle!

This newcomer was too formidable!

“Boss, what are you agitated for? Even if he knows Sword Dao and Formation Dao, it’s also impossible to be those two people’s match, right?” Peng Yang said.

Another person said, “Yeah, these two are too strong! If that punk is the same rank as them, there’s still a show. But, his realm is too low!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Ke suddenly smiled and said, “Heh heh, you guys just watch!”

Ye Yuan’s face did not show the slightest change in expression. He just said coolly, “I said before, I will kill until you guys don’t dare to go out of the city! Do you guys really think that this Ye is kidding?”

“Hahaha ... this is your trump card? This pile of metal scraps and you want to deal with us teaming up?” When Qin Hu saw the situation, he said with a loud laugh.

Mo Xi also shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “Huhu, kid, you really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Using a bunch of Empyrean spirit treasures and you want to deal with the two of us? Too naive!”

Ye Yuan gave them a cold glance and said coolly, “Is that so?”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Suddenly, the sword formation unexpectedly erupted!

Sword Dao source and Formation Dao source reverberated between heaven and earth, enveloping Qin Hu and Mo Xi two people inside all at once.

All of a sudden, a feeling of immense danger welled up in their hearts, making the two people’s faces change wildly.

“Two great source powers! Qin Hu, you’ve screwed me over this time!”

When Mo Xi saw Ye Yuan take action, his mind shook heavily.

He shouted at the top of his voice, roaring angrily.

At the same time, Qin Hu’s expression also changed wildly, and he yelled, “Talk again later! Let’s join hands first to repel the enemy!”

It was already too late to want to run!

Ye Yuan’s speed was too fast, the swords coming and going were merely a matter of an instant.

In a blink, Ye Yuan’s sword formation already covered Mo Xi.

In an instant, he felt a huge cage covering him firmly, unable to break free at all.

This sword formation was too scary!

His Four Directional Beads’ power was tremendous, but no matter how great his power was, in front of source power, it was too weak until it could not stand up to a breeze either.

The power of source, that was an existence that only Deva Realm powerhouses could touch!

This guy was just a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor. So how did he comprehend it?

Even though Ye Yuan’s sword formation was formed with metal scraps, his power was currently being divided on 1,008 swords. He should not not have much power left.

Qin Hu had a conflicted look. He wanted to run, but he still endured it.

The loss outweighed the gain in doing so!

Hence, he released his full strength and rushed over toward Ye Yuan.

But he had yet to arrive when he saw the sword formation dice Mo Xi into minced meat as if chopping vegetables and cutting melons!

For a moment, everyone was shocked!
