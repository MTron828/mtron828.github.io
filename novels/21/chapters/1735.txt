Chapter 1739 Purple-eyed Devil Ape

The party quietly sneaked over toward the cave. Suddenly, a series of roars came from in front.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed and he said, “Not good, this aura ... The Purple-eyed Devil Ape went berserk!”

The other people’s faces also turned pale. The horrifying aura coming from in front made their hearts palpitating.

Duan Peng’s complexion was ashen as he said, “Once the Purple-eyed Devil Ape goes berserk, its strength rivals a Seventh Firmament Divine Lord! This ... What should we do?”

Everyone seemed to be in deep thoughts due to his words. But this was interrupted when they saw a Purple-eyed Devil Ape in a bloody battle with a behemoth.

That behemoth’s strength was also peerlessly powerful, already reaching peak middle-stage rank four!

However, the Purple-eyed Devil Ape after going berserk was obviously a notch stronger!

A pair of enormous fists were like two cannonballs, beating that behemoth until it did not have the slightest strength to retaliate.

Ye Yuan’s eyesight was excellent, one look and he saw that the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit within the cave was already mature!

This behemoth was clearly drawn over by it.

Once the Purple-eyed Devil Ape took care of this behemoth, it would definitely go pluck the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit straight away.

“It’s a Scarlet Armored Beast! No wonder it could force the Purple-eyed Devil Ape to go berserk!” Ye Yuan said.

Yu Jing sensed the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s raging strength. Her face was white as a sheet of paper as she said, “Ye Yuan, why don’t ... we give up? This Purple-eyed Devil Ape is too powerful. Even though your strength is strong, but ...”

Yu Jing did not continue, but her meaning was already very clear.

Ye Yuan most likely was not this Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s match, so it was better to not take the risk.

Everyone had a score in their hearts. Even though Ye Yuan’s strength was extremely powerful and could even one-shot Sixth Firmament Divine Lord powerhouses, facing off against Seventh Firmament Divine Lords, it was still not enough.

Between a Seventh Firmament Divine Lord and a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, there was a massive bottleneck. The strength difference was tremendous.

If Ye Yuan could break through to become a Fourth Firmament Divine Lord, it would be a cinch.

However, Ye Yuan was only a Third Firmament Divine Lord right now. He was two stages away from the berserk Purple-eyed Devil Ape.

This kind of gap was not what talent could make up for.

After all, between each minor realm of the Divine Lord Realm, the gap was tremendous too, let alone two stages.

Duan Peng opened his mouth and did not speak.

He knew that he did not have the right to speak currently.

But letting him retreat right now, he was indeed unwilling.

Accompanying Ye Yuan into the Evil Water Ravine, he took on a great risk too.

In the end, it was all for naught, how could he be willing?

Right at this time, they could hear a loud noise in the distance. The Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s iron fist directly blasted the Scarlet Armored Beast flying, causing it to be dead until it could not be are more deader.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, his figure scurrying out like lightning.

“Carry out according to the original plan!”

Throwing down this sentence, Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared.

When he appeared again, he already swept to the vicinity of the Purple-eyed Devil Ape.

The four people’s expressions changed drastically, not expecting that Ye Yuan was actually so decisive. Wanting to stop it was already too late as well.

Duan Peng’s expression changed several times and he gritted his teeth and said, “Brother Ye is truly someone who values friendship. Being able to find him this time was my, Duan Peng’s, blessing!”

Among the Skydemon Mountain Range’s teams, being able to run into this kind of friend, that was really a rare species.

Yu Jing said with a worried look, “Yeah, Brother Ye is a good person!”

As the saying went: a friend in need is a friend indeed. It was pretty much like this.

Facing a powerful adversary, Ye Yuan stepped forward bravely without any hesitation. This sentiment, who could remain unmoved?

Ye Yuan stepped into the void and rushed over toward the cave. His goal was shockingly the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit!

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape had just resolved a powerful foe. It did not expect another one to spring out again, it was angered until it bellowed wildly.

It was currently in a berserk state. Its aura was extremely powerful.

Seeing Ye Yuan, it raised its hand. It was a punch, the speed swift to the extreme.

With the Purple-eyed Devil Ape under a berserk state, regardless of whether it was power or speed, it soared dramatically.

Even if Ye Yuan used spatial law, the difference was still too big.

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a flint, Ye Yuan clashed with the Purple-eyed Devil Ape.

The moment he made his move, it was his strongest attack! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Spirit Concealing Sword

Rumble!

Ye Yuan felt his internal organs shifted positions, figure flying out backward, fresh blood spurting wildly in the air.

But the Purple-eyed Devil Ape was also not much better. This sword of Ye Yuan was incomparably swift and fierce and actually opened up a wound on its chest.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape was thoroughly enraged. A Third Firmament Divine Lord human actually injured it!

Fierce beasts had savage and cruel temperaments to begin with. Under its rage at this time, it went even more utterly crazy.

In the distance, Duan Peng and the rest revealed appalled looks, looking at this scene in extreme shock.

“So strong! Turns out that this is Brother Ye’s true strength! That sword earlier was really too terrifying!” Duan Peng said in shock.

“A Third Firmament Divine Lord actually injured the Purple-eyed Devil Ape after going berserk, crossing two stages! This ... This is too inconceivable!”

Yu Jing exclaimed, “No wonder Brother Ye has always been calm and composed. Turns out that Luo Yong they all were simply clowns jumping around in his eyes!”

Ordinary Third Firmament Divine Lords, forget about clashing with the Purple-eyed Devil Ape, they could be smacked into minced meat by a palm-wind of the other party more than several hundred feet away.

But Ye Yuan actually forcefully exchanged a blow with the Purple-eyed Devil Ape and even injured the other party. This subverted common sense too much.

Suddenly, Duan Peng’s face changed and he said, “Wait, after this guy goes berserk, regardless whether defense or recovery ability, it can be rated as freakish! This bit of injury is simply nothing to it!”

It was only to see the wound on the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s chest in the midst of recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape lifted its head to the sky and gave a long roar, pounded its chest twice fiercely, then its figure flew out like a cannonball!

Ye Yuan also did not expect that this Purple-eyed Devil Ape was actually so powerful.

That sword just now was virtually his strongest attack already. It actually only left behind a shallow wound on the other party’s body.

But his goal was not to clash head-on with the Purple-eyed Devil Ape but to draw the other party away.

Hence, he borrowed the counter-shock, figure dashing out like lightning.

“So fast!”

Ye Yuan was secretly shocked in his heart. This Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s speed seemed to exceed his expectations.

Ye Yuan who comprehended spatial law, his speed far surpassed ordinary people’s. Even Sixth Firmament Divine Lords also could not keep up with his speed.

But this Purple-eyed Devil Ape after going berserk was actually even faster than him!

Ye Yuan had already not felt such a strong sense of oppression for very long. He did not expect that he was forced to such a degree by a fierce beast today.

One ape and one human, both figures were extremely swift, vanishing from everyone’s line of sight in a blink.

Duan Peng brought everyone and revealed their figures, speeding over in the direction of the cave swiftly.

Yu Jing was very flustered and said, “That Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s speed is so fast. Brother Ye will ... will be fine, right?”

Yu Jing was very worried about Ye Yuan, her words already carrying sobbing.

Duan Peng’s expression was also very ugly, but he still said, “This is the chance that Brother Ye risked his life to create for us. If we can’t even do this well, then we’d be letting him down too much! Brother Ye is a lucky fellow. He’ll definitely be fine!”
