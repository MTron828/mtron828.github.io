Chapter 1786 You Should Thank Miss Baili

Baili Qingyan’s words made Zhong Hanlin had a stunned face.

Why did these words sound like coquettishness between lovers?

Zhong Hanlin felt jealous and his killing intent towards Ye Yuan immediately strengthened several degrees.

Ye Yuan was taken aback and turned to Zhong Hanlin and said, “You get started then.”

Making him beg Baili Qingyan, that was impossible.

A man must have a backbone.

Baili Qingyan was taken aback and said in exasperation, “You this guy, want to keep up appearances to cover up your predicament! Zhong Hanlin’s strength isn’t what you can imagine!”

She felt that she could finally take Ye Yuan down a notch. She did not expect that Ye Yuan would rather be killed than be willing to beg her. This made her feel a loss of face.

But Ye Yuan said without a care, “Is that so? Maybe he isn’t as strong as imagined.”

These two people, one chiming in after the other, Zhong Hanlin felt that he was very redundant.

And this also made him very enraged.

“Reckless and blind thing, you can go die already!”

Zhong Hanlin gave a furious roar, suddenly throwing out a palm.

The powerful world power of Ninth Firmament Divine Lord instantly crushed over from all directions towards Ye Yuan.

“Blazing Sun Astral Palm!”

Bang!

The place where Ye Yuan stood was immediately leveled to the ground.

Zhong Hanlin revealed a look of disdain and said, “Can’t stand up to a single blow!”

An inexplicable hint of sadness flashed across Baili Qingyan’s eyes. She also did not know why she actually had a feeling of emptiness.

“This is your strength? Doesn’t seem to be much.”

Ye Yuan’s figure slowly walked out of the void and was actually completely unscathed.

Zhong Hanlin’s face revealed a look of disbelief as he said, “How is this possible?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I said before, maybe you’re not as strong as imagined.”

Zhong Hanlin’s face fell and he said angrily, “Punk, don’t get smug too early. I didn’t use my full strength at all just now! Now, I’ll let you take a look at my true strength!”

While talking, Zhong Hanlin brandished his long spear, it was shockingly a celestial deity mystic treasure.

His aura surged to the sky, his entire person was like a long spear, the momentum astonishing.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, revealing a rather surprised look.

This Zhong Hanlin’s strength was indeed formidable.

The moment this domineering spear momentum came out, Ye Yuan felt the pressure that came from head-on.

With his current strength, he was still not Zhong Hanlin’s match.

But Ye Yuan was not worried.

That evil spirit which Dustless subdued did not even fear First Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouses, let alone a puny little Zhong Hanlin.

He was just about to release the evil spirit but saw Baili Qingyan move daintily.

“Soft Cloud Heavenly Sacred Spear!”

Right at this time, Zhong Hanlin’s overbearing spear suddenly thrust out.

“Mist Wave Traceless Sword!”

Baili Qingyan’s sword energy was overwhelming, rushing over with a diagonal stab, facing off with Zhong Hanlin’s certain-kill spear.

Bang!

Two mighty peerless geniuses exchanged blows at this moment.

The intense divine essence undulations obliterated everything in the middle.

Zhong Hanlin and Baili Qingyan each retreated more than ten steps before barely managing to stand firm.

As a bystander, Ye Yuan took the two people’s strength into his sights.

Even though the two people looked to be evenly-matched in strength, Zhong Hanlin fighting to a draw with Baili Qingyan with his domineering spear already lost by a hair.

Zhong Hanlin completely did not think that Baili Qingyan would actually suddenly rush out. At this time, his expression was livid as he said, “Junior Sister Qingyan, you actually attacked me for this good-for-nothing?”

Baili Qingyan said coolly, “You should leave! He’s my companion, so I won’t let you kill him.”

Zhong Hanlin’s face changed when he heard that and said, “You wouldn’t really be interested in this kid, right?”

Baili Qingyan’s face turned cold and she said, “That has nothing to do with you! Still not going, don’t blame me for not being courteous!”

Zhong Hanlin was angered until he stomped about in a frenzy. Carrying his long spear, he pointed at the Ye Yuan behind Baili Qingyan and said, “Kid, if you’re a man, step forward and have an open and above-board battle with me! What kind of man are you considered, hiding behind a woman?”

Ye Yuan had both hands behind his back as he said calmly, “You should be thanking Miss Baili. Otherwise, you would already be a dead man now.”

When Baili Qingyan heard these words, she could not resist rolling her eyes.

Why were the words said by this guy so unpleasant? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

I saved you currently, alright?

It was fine if you were not grateful, you still wanted to posture.

Although Ye Yuan dodging Zhong Hanlin’s palm just now surprised her a little, she did not think that Ye Yuan had the ability to deal with Zhong Hanlin, let alone talk about killing him.

When boasting, at least come up with a draft, okay?

Zhong Hanlin sneered and said, “Is that so? I’m standing right here, come kill me if you have the capabilities! I really want me to kill you!”

A cold light flashed across in Ye Yuan’s eyes and he said coldly, “You really want me to kill you?”

Baili Qingyan was speechless. Interrupting Ye Yuan’s words, she said, “Alright, Zhong Hanlin, you go! He and I are currently teammates. If I can’t even bring him out, it will be very bad for my reputation. Whatever grudges you guys have, talk again in the future. But right now, no way!”

Zhong Hanlin gritted his teeth when he heard that. Pointing at Ye Yuan, he said, “Fine then, I’ll let this punk live a little longer! A month later, I’ll definitely take your life!”

Finished talking, Zhong Hanlin’s figure moved, disappearing.

Baili Qingyan turned around and looked at Ye Yuan crossly as she said, “Will you die if you don’t brag? Based on your strength, can you kill him?”

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not explain much.

But this scene was even more of a guilty conscience in Baili Qingyan’s eyes.

This guy was clearly hiding behind her, putting up a bold front.

There were no words along the way.

Baili Qingyan was very upset with Ye Yuan and naturally could not be bothered to acknowledge him.

Ye Yuan naturally would not court a rebuff, so he also did not take the initiative to talk.

Even Baili Qingyan herself could not understand why she would take action to save Ye Yuan that day.

On the road after that, when encountering powerful fierce beasts, it was still Baili Qingyan acting to dispose of them.

But Baili Qingyan was very certain that Ye Yuan indeed had the strength to jump realms and battle.

Ordinary newly-ascended late-stage rank four fierce beasts, he could resolve them.

And this also surprised her greatly.

With Baili Qingyan’s talent, jumping realms and battling was naturally not an issue.

But when she was Fifth Firmament Divine Lord, dealing with a peak Sixth Firmament Divine Lord was already her limit.

A Seventh Firmament Divine Lord was absolutely impossible for her to defeat.

But Ye Yuan clearly had this strength. No wonder this guy was so cocky.

“Eh? There’s a cave here, perhaps there are fierce beasts inside!” Baili Qingyan said with joy.

Along the way, the fierce beasts that they encountered were not considered many.

And two people forming a team required even more heavenly demon crystals.

Hence, that was why Baili Qingyan would be so excited at finding a place where there might be fierce beasts.

Either way, she was bold stemming with superb skills and did not fear fierce beasts either.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Go in and take a look then.”

The two people did not walk for long when three brass bell-like eyes appeared in the two people’s light of sight.

Roar!

An earth-shaking loud roar echoed out, making the two people’s hearts shock.

Baili Qingyan’s expression changed and she cried out in shock, “This is a Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast! Looking at this aura ... it’s already almost breaking through to rank five! Quickly run!”

Finished talking, Baili Qingyan’s figure leaped, speeding hastily toward the cave entrance.
