Chapter 2502: You Seem to be Scared!

Under the watchful gazes of the people, the Cangli Heavenly Fire on Ye Yuan’s body gradually extinguished.

As for that terrifying Nihility Karmic Fire, it was akin to a rock falling into the sea; not stirring up any waves at all.

Recalling back then, that unknown existence’s Eight Extreme Heavenly Fire did not even refine Ye Yuan, and let Ye Yuan achieve the chaos origin divinity instead.

Although the Nihility Karmic Fire was strong, compared to the Eight Extreme Heavenly Fire, it was worlds apart. How could it threaten the present Ye Yuan?

This Nihility Karmic Fire was a joke!

And Ye Yuan’s physical body was the limit of existence in the Heavenspan World.

The Dragon Clan’s paramount cultivation method coupled with the perfect Nine Transformations Golden Body, was there any kind of flame in this world that could incinerate him? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Furthermore, talking about playing with fire, Ye Yuan was the ancestor of playing with fire!

Although he did not cultivate fire-attribute law and was unable to condense all kinds of terrifying flames.

His fire controlling technique had long already reached the acme of perfection.

Wanting to use fire to burn him was easier said than done!

Originally, everyone was doubtful and trying to guess what kind of means Ye Yuan would use to face these two mighty flames.

But no one could have thought that he actually did not block them!

He did not care at all!

Tian Qing had an inert face and blinked his eyes fiercely, thinking that he had a misconception.

“He … He’s actually completely unscathed! Completely unharmed! This … How is this possible? Those are Cangli Heavenly Fire and Nihility Karmic Fire! He actually didn’t even employ divine essence? I’m not dreaming right?”

He felt that his understanding had been seriously challenged.

These two legendary flames could not be seen randomly.

But the result was too surprising.

“I-It’s impossible, right? It was so far away and I even had a feeling of being evaporated just now. Yet, Lord Saint Azure he’s actually completely unscathed?”

“Two legendary flames and they were actually unable to make Lord Saint Azure take action?”

“It’s really too impressive! No wonder Lord Saint Azure kept on ignoring Lin Chaotian. It turns out that he really doesn’t care!”

… …

The powerhouses around were all marveling with admiration endlessly.

Even if they did not understand the origins of these two mighty flames, they could also feel the horror of these two clusters of flames.

But Ye Yuan’s casualness really shocked him.

Of course, the one who was most shocked was none other than Lin Chaotian himself.

He used his most terrifying means in a state of extreme fury.

As a result, Ye Yuan did not even have any interest in making a move!

How could this not frighten him?

He was really scared!

“A-Are you the devil? This … Even this and you are fine? Impossible! You … You must be forcefully enduring it!” Lin Chaotian bellowed.

For the first time, Ye Yuan looked Lin Chaotian in the eye and said coolly, “You … seem to be scared!”

Lin Chaotian’s expression changed and he said angrily, “Scared? This ancestor is currently humanity’s number one person, the human race’s sovereign! Would I be scared of you, a guy who isn’t even a Dao Ancestor? Ye Yuan, if you have the capability, let’s fight upright and openly!”

He was really scared!

Anyone could tell that what he was yelling was threatening in manner but inwardly shaky.

The feeling that Ye Yuan gave him was too strange!

He boasted that he already understood Ye Yuan very well.

But that scene earlier, he suddenly discovered his understanding of Ye Yuan was actually extremely limited.

This person was always outside of your understanding!

Each time, he felt that everything was under control.

However, things never developed in the direction that he imagined.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Chaotian with interest and he said with a faint smile, “Okay!”

That smile carried indescribable contempt.

Lin Chaotian was greatly triggered. Two power of rules surged frenziedly once more.

“Heaven Wielding Golden Crow! Myriad Fire Consecration!”

Lin Chaotian roared, carried a large golden bird, and rushed toward Ye Yuan.

The current Ye Yuan was still taking his own sweet time.

It was only to see him reach his hand out and grab in the void. A transparent long sword impressively appeared in his hand.

Seeing this scene, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

“I-Is that sword a sword of void?”

“Insane! Really crazy! He … He’s actually using space as a weapon!”

“This … Can it still be played like this?”

… …

There were shocked voices all around.

Tian Qing’s pupils constricted, and he said, “The void as a sword, this boy indeed comprehended spatial rule! However, if it’s merely spatial rule, it’s not a great threat to this ancestor too!”

He weighed it over and felt that he should not fear Ye Yuan.

After all, back then when Shang Hang fused space and time, two great rules, Shang Hang could not do anything to him.

Now, he corroborated his Dao to become an ancestor, his strength increased greatly.

A Sword Dao rule, a spatial rule, was not enough to pose a threat to him.

Swoosh!

At this time, Ye Yuan finally moved!

Only to see his figure flash, already arriving in front of the golden crow.

Facing the human who provoked him so much, that golden crow roared, as if wanting to completely devour Ye Yuan.

“Roar!”

The golden crow’s two wings shook, swallowing directly towards Ye Yuan.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly and he did not unleash some earth-shaking big move either, rushing straight for the golden crow.

“Chi! Chi! Chi!”

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint

That golden crow was directly hacked into countless chunks, dissipating into nothing.

“This … This …”

Lin Chaotian opened his mouth wide, looking at this scene in disbelief.

He relied on this move to reach a draw with Progenitor Tian Qing!

In front of Ye Yuan, it actually did not even have excess strength to fight back?

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Chaotian with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Is this the strength of humanity’s sovereign? Aren’t you afraid of people laughing their heads off by being the human race’s sovereign?”

Lin Chaotian’s pupils constricted, finally revealing a fearful expression.

He was not a fool. Ye Yuan’s casual mood was not a pretense!

This guy was really impressive!

Clearly, before this, his spatial law had not reached grand completion yet.

In a short one month’s time, his spatial law actually reached the realm of rule!

With Sword Dao rule and spatial rule fusing, the current Ye Yuan was too strong!

This kind of strength was simply unreasonably strong!

At this time, Lin Chaotian finally wanted to back out.

Swoosh!

Lin Chaotian urged his divine essence to the extreme, running into the distance.

Ye Yuan seemed to have long expected it. His figure just swayed and he already blocked in front of Lin Chaotian.

His teleport was much faster than Lin Chaotian’s movement technique.

“Why? Weren’t you very arrogant before? Didn’t you want to unify the human race? Is our human race’s sovereign running away?” Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Lin Chaotian’s expression was indescribably ugly.

He thought that after he became a Dao Ancestor, he would be able to tower above all of humanity.

Who would have expected that in a short one month’s time, Ye Yuan actually became strong to such an extent!

Suddenly, his gaze flickered and he took out a small crystal.

Tear of Life!

Lin Chaotian said in a stern voice, “Ye Yuan, if you dare come over, this ancestor will crush it! The Tear of Life is a rule item. As long as it’s shattered, it will return to heaven and earth!?Heh,?this ancestor knows that this thing is very important to you. Just try if you dare to kill this ancestor!”

This was his final trump card!
