Chapter 2495: Who Is Number One?

“Ahhh!!”

With a miserable scream, Zhang Zhen fell to the ground.

From start to end, Ye Yuan never lifted his head once.

Dealing with Zhang Zhen’s level of strength, it only needed a burst of sword energy and it was enough.

He was only a foot away from the water rule crystal.

Close at hand, but far away at the horizon!

Zhang Zhen looked at the water rule crystal in front of him, still desperately crawling forward.

He extended his severed arms, attempting to grab the water rule crystal.

But right at this time, another streak of cold light flashed past.

His two arms were gone.

In the distance, came Ye Yuan’s icy-cold voice. Ye Yuan said, “Man dies in pursuit of wealth, birds die in pursuit of food! It’s just that you got to have a bottom-line as a person! Yesterday’s karmic cause, today’s karmic effect. Everything was you bringing trouble upon yourself!”

Pang Zhen laughed wildly when he saw the situation and said,?“Hahaha?… Zhang Zhen, you also have this day! Gratifying! How gratifying!”

Zhang Zhen was very smart. These few years, he did not deliberately be friendly with Pang Zhen.

But some things, he would always do it thoughtlessly.

He would let Pang Zhen see it or know about it by chance.

In the course of time, Pang Zhen was firmly convinced of Zhang Zhen’s character.

So along the way, he did not doubt Zhang Zhen at all.

But in the end, he was still deceived by Zhang Zhen!

He experienced a narrow shave with death, obtaining the Tear of Life.

But in the end, it benefited Lin Chaotian!

That burst of fury almost drove him crazy.

Now, finally venting this frustration, how could he not be happy?

Wan Zhen snorted coldly and said, “Just now, you probably also didn’t expect that you’d have such an end, right? Serves you right!”

Sword energy seeped into Zhang Zhen’s body through his wounds, overwhelming him to the point where he wished that he was dead.

Despair!

The disparity between him and Ye Yuan was too great!

He also understood that Ye Yuan did it on purpose.

Able to see, unable to eat!

Nothing was more despairing than this.

He was only a step away from Dao Ancestor.

But he would never become a Dao Ancestor!

Ye Yuan extended his hand and beckoned. The rule crystal flew into his hand.

Zhang Zhen could only watch this scene, powerless to do anything.

Done with these, Ye Yuan no longer cared about him, treating Pang Zhen and the rest dedicatedly.

Zhang Zhen sprawled on the ground just like that, not daring to move.

Ye Yuan’s action was too terrifying. Zhang Zhen did not have any possibility of running away at all.

Currently, he was terrified to the extreme in his heart. The taste of awaiting death was not good.

Time slowly trickled by. The wood spirit divine essence within the three people’s bodies, all were forced out of their bodies bit by bit by Ye Yuan.

The three people’s injuries also gradually recovered.

Pang Zhen’s severed limbs also slowly grew out under Ye Yuan’s treatment.

“Your Excellency, Lin Chaotian obtained the fire rule crystal. He’ll definitely refine it right away. Once he refined the fire rule crystal, his strength will definitely increase greatly,” Pang Zhen said worriedly.

Ye Yuan was indifferent as he said coolly, “His appetite is very big, but he has to be able to swallow it too. The scores between me and him should also be settled now. The three of you stand guard over me. I’ll go into closed-seclusion here.”

“Closed-seclusion?”

The three people were stunned when he heard that.

Others came to the Heavenspan Mountain in order to compete for the position of Dao Ancestor.

Ye Yuan was exceptionally different, to actually come up the mountain to go into closed-seclusion and cultivate.

Was this competing in cultivation speed with Dao Ancestors?

One had to know, the time needed to refine a rule crystal was not considered long. At most one month and you could digest it fully.

With Ye Yuan going into closed-seclusion now, could he surpass Lin Chaotian within a month?

After Lin Chaotian refined the fire rule crystal, his strength would not be one plus one equals two so simple.

Wood-attribute rule plus fire-attribute rule, the power produced was seriously too terrifying.

Even if Ye Yuan went into closed-seclusion and broke through now, could he surpass Lin Chaotian who had two great rules gathered onto one body?

The few people all felt rather baffled by Ye Yuan’s choice.

Right now, the most important thing should be catching up to Lin Chaotian and not let him refine the rule crystal.

However, Ye Yuan’s authority had long already penetrated deep into the marrow. Regarding his decision, the few people naturally would not resist.

Ye Yuan made them stand guard, then they would stand guard.

“Your Excellency, what about this guy?” Pang Zhen pointed at Zhang Zhen and said.

“I’ll leave him to you,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ye Yuan knew that the one who hated Zhang Zhen the most was Pang Zhen.

This opportunity to take revenge, he naturally had to leave it to Pang Zhen.

Sure enough, Pang Zhen rubbed his fists and wiped his palms. His gaze when looking at Zhang Zhen was full of ill-intent.

He had been stifling this frustration until now.

After handing over this matter to him, Ye Yuan ignored him and started cultivating on his own.

His sword energy already seeped through the body, destroying Zhang Zhen’s life force.

With these three people’s strength, it was naturally impossible to let him run.

Ye Yuan’s realm already reached the limit, it was impossible to make any more breakthroughs.

What he wanted to break through was naturally law comprehension. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Between time and space, these two great laws, Ye Yuan’s time law fell into a state of stagnation, but his spatial law became stronger and stronger.

Before entering the Heavenspan Mountain, his spatial law actually already reached the level of rank five source.

After entering the Heavenspan Mountain, the spatial law here was virtually the Heavenspan World’s supreme law.

In this place, even Dao Ancestors were unable to teleport. It could be seen how powerful the spatial rule here was.

Walking along the way, the spatial rule here was also of great inspiration to him.

What he had to do now, was to pool all these inspirations together, then make a breakthrough.

The realm of rule was already not far away.

… …

At the end of the road was a deep and quiet passageway.

When Lin Chaotian saw this passage, he was immediately wildly elated.

Outside of this passageway, it was impossible to refine rule crystals.

To become a Dao Ancestor, you must enter this passageway to refine the rule crystal.

But now, he was only a step away from becoming a Dao Ancestor a second time.

He believed that as long as he became a Dao Ancestor again, his strength absolutely would not be inferior to Ye Yuan.

Even if Ye Yuan could really break the shackles, it was also impossible for him to be weaker than Ye Yuan.

Because his might was endowed by heaven.

Thinking up to here, he gripped the fire rule crystal in his hand a little tighter.

“Ye Yuan, you’ll never be able to imagine how powerful this ancestor will be after possessing two great powers of rule! No matter how great your talent is, heaven is an obstacle that you’ll never be able to overcome.”

Lin Chaotian laughed loudly as he entered the passageway.

Time went by day by day, Lin Chaotian’s aura also grew with each passing day.

A month later, Lin Chaotian’s imposing aura surged to the sky.

A terrifying power of flames made his entire person look like a god.

“Hahaha?… This ancestor transformed from Dao Ancestor Life to Dao Ancestor Firespirit! I’m likely the number one person since ancient times! Ye Yuan, this ancestor wants to see how strong you are, and whether or not your divine soul can be shattered by this ancestor!”

Lin Chaotian was incomparably wild at this time. He felt that he was unbelievably powerful.

Ye Yuan’s bizarreness previously was utterly not worth mentioning under his power!

With two great rules augmenting him, the position of Dao Ancestor descended. He already became the number one person in the world!

It was just that he did not know that currently, spatial rule descended upon Ye Yuan. His entire person became incomparably illusory.
