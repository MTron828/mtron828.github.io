Chapter 1282: An Ant Trying to Topple a Tree

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Yue Ji nodded her head and said, “Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was a fiend race newly-ascended Heavenly Emperor a million years ago. Back then, he was an empyrean powerhouse at the height of his popularity along with Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and several others. They all had extremely high hopes of breaking through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm. And among them, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang had been enemies for a long time already. After that, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang obtained a Heavenly Emperor Dao Fruit in a heavenly emperor world, and broke through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm first.”

Ye Yuan’s face fell, and he said, “It was Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang who killed Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove? And then sent you all here to seize treasures?”

Yue Ji gave a bitter laugh and said, “In the eyes of a heavenly emperor, we’re merely ants. We haven’t even reached the Divine Lord Realm, so how can we possibly reach Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s level? Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was also not killed by Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang. His means were exceedingly formidable, even a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse found it difficult to kill him too! Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang just severely wounded him. As for who killed him, it’s unknown.”

From Yue Ji’s words, Ye Yuan had a preliminary impression of the Heavenspan World as well.

The Heavenspan World was similarly a world filled with slaughter and struggles. In fact, it might be even more brutal than the Immortal Grove Region.

Ye Yuan even suspected that because Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was too severely injured, he was killed by some thieves and the likes who were coveting treasures.

Except that had nothing much to do with Ye Yuan anymore.

Ye Yuan knew very little about Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and was far from talking about love or hate.

The Immortal Grove Region choosing himself was just a kind of instinctive protection towards the Heavenly Dao itself. It just thought that he could take on the responsibility.

Putting it bluntly, it was a kind of mutual exploitation.

While he did not fail to live up to the Heavenly Dao’s expectations either, achieving his present realm.

This kind of inheritance was different from Long Teng’s inheritance. Ye Yuan did not have the obligation to go and help him take revenge.

But Kanuo and Yue Ji were sent by Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang, so that was different.

Disregarding that he was Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang, even if he was Dao Ancestor Jiu Shang, Ye Yuan would definitely eradicate him too!

It was just that looking at it now, the hope was very slim.

Ye Yuan did not speak, waiting for Yue Ji to continue talking.

“Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang had always coveted Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s Soul Suppressing Pearl and wanted to make it his own. Hence, that’s why he sent Kanuo and me to search for the Immortal Grove Region. As a result, it was indeed found by us!” Yue Ji said.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was scorching as he said, “Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang already ascended to the Heavenly Emperor Realm, so why would he still covet an empyrean spirit treasure?”

Yue Ji smiled bitterly and said, “The rarity of heavenly emperor spirit treasures can be described seldom-seen! And the Soul Suppressing Pearl could be said to be top-grade among the masses! It was precisely because Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove had this empyrean spirit treasure, that he had always suppressed Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang. It’s just that didn’t expect that Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s luck was better than Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s. In the end, it was he who broke through first.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, finally having a rough understanding of the beginning and end of the fiend race’s invasion.

“Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang, is it? One day, I’ll let you know that ants can topple trees too!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was sharp, seething with killing intent.

Seeing this scene, Yue Ji could not help being stunned.

This kind of big-talk, only this one in front of her dared to say it.

A heavenly emperor was the strongest existence in the Heavenspan World. Even Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang, who had just ascended a million years ago, was also not what an empyrean world’s ant could resist.

...

The great battle already stopped, but the Divine Realm was still making progress with no signs of stopping.

The entire human territory was already utterly destroyed by this war.

The original human race setup was already thoroughly smashed.

Countless human martial artists were turned into fiend slaves by Kanuo, and then utterly obliterated by that attack of Ye Yuan’s.

The remaining humans returning to the human region anew were bound to experience a very long period of shuffling.

However, these were all not what Ye Yuan was concerned about.

Humans were especially adept at the law of survival. Once time passed, they would definitely establish a new order.

When Ye Yuan returned to the dragon clan, Fang Tian led everyone over.

They naturally inquired about Mu Lingxue’s situation right away.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Lingxue is fine for the time being. It’s just that her situation is very bad. Senior, I came back to tell you all that I’m leaving! Brother Teng, the Divine Realm’s matters in the future will have to trouble you.”

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone startled.

Fang Tian’s expression changed, and he said, “Sure enough, are you going to the outside world?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan revealed a look of surprise and immediately smiled and said, “Looks like Senior already guessed it! This world that we’re in is merely a small world that a Martial Dao powerhouse opened up, called Immortal Grove Region! Outside, there’s an even broader world! Want to save Lingxue, I have to go there!”

Even if Fang Tian already guessed it, hearing Ye Yuan say it out, he was still shaken to the core.

“Ye Yuan, just what realm are you at right now? It seems like the Deity Realm isn’t as strong as you!” Fang Tian drew a deep breath and said.

When the others heard this, they also could not help perking their ears up.

This was the question that every one of them paid attention to!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m indeed initial-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm currently. It’s just that my situation is somewhat special. If I really have to say, I’m barely considered half-master of the Immortal Grove Region.”

“Hiss ...”

Everyone drew a cold breath. This matter was not difficult to understand.

That was also to say that Ye Yuan was the Immortal Grove Region’s true god!

A god that towered above all beings!

Recalling Ye Yuan’s growth experiences, everyone felt like they were dreaming.

“Then ... do we still have hopes of breaking through to the Deity Realm?” Teng Yun asked with fear and anxiety in his heart.

This question was similarly the question that everyone was most concerned with.

Since Ye Yuan broke through to Deity Realm, then could they ... break through to the Deity Realm or not?

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I induced Heavenly Dao with Alchemy Dao, completing the Heavenly Dao of initial-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm within my body, obtaining Heavenly Dao’s recognition from there. You guys are unable to replicate it.”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s reply, everyone’s faces all involuntarily revealed a look of disappointment.

Ye Yuan smiled and continued, “But everybody rest assured, this is just temporary! As long as I can reach the outside world, when my strength increases in the future, I’ll naturally have ways to make Immortal Grove Heavenly Dao rise again! At that time, all of you will be able to break through to the Deity Realm!”

One sentence made everyone pleasantly surprised.

Except, Fang Tian’s expression was still somewhat unnatural. He discerned the overtones in Ye Yuan’s words.

Everyone dispersed. There was only Fang Tian and Ye Yuan left inside the great hall.

Fang Tian said, “Ye Yuan, tell me honestly, this departure for the outside world probably won’t be so smooth, right?”

Ye Yuan smiled. He knew that he could not hide from Fang Tian. Hence, he briefly recounted the matters of the turbulent spatial flow, including the riddle of the disappearance of the Deity Realm powerhouses 100 thousand years ago.

Fang Tian’s heart shook when he heard this. He was aware how perilous that turbulent spatial flow was.

“No way! You definitely can’t go! Over 100 thousand years ago, there were at least 100 Deity Realm powerhouses. They faced near certain death when banding up together and entering the turbulent spatial flow! You by yourself, how can you possibly pass through the turbulent spatial flow?” Fang Tian said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Senior, my mind is made up, don’t urge anymore! Lingxue sacrificed her divine soul for me, how can I watch her die helplessly? Don’t talk about near-certain death, even if it’s a certain death, I have to brave it too!”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s attitude, Fang Tian knew that he could not persuade. Hence, he let out a sigh and said, “You’re a good boy that regards feelings and ties highly! Forget it, on your trip, you must be careful!”
