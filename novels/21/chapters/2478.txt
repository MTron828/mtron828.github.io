Chapter 2484: Bear the Consequences Yourself!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bang!

The seat under Ancestor Lightning shattered into dust.

He had a gloomy look. It could be seen how furious he was at this time.

“This bunch of animals, this ancestor treated them well, why did they betray this ancestor?” Ancestor Lightning said furiously.

Below, Pang Zhen stood proudly and said indifferently, “Ancestor, it is public sentiment! The things that you all have done already chilled the hearts of the martial artists under the heavens. Why would they stand on your side?”

Ancestor Lightning’s gaze turned sharp and he said angrily, “Shut up, you unfilial child! Are you planning to go to his side too?”

“Yes!” Pang Zhen said without hesitation.

Boom!

A terrifying pressure immediately erupted.. Ancestor Lightning’s palm was already pressed on top of Pang Zhen’s head.

Just a bit more and it could take his life!

But Pang Zhen’s expression did not change, and his heart did not race. He stared straight at Ancestor Lightning just like that.

As if he did not care about his own life at all.

Ancestor Lightning had a look of thunderous rage. But he could not press this palm down no matter what.

“Scram! Get lost for this ancestor! In the future, you’re no longer a member of my Pang Family!” Ancestor Lightning said with an angry roar.

Pang Zhen knelt down and did three kowtows toward Ancestor Lightning, and said, “No matter whether Ancestor acknowledges or not, I’m a member of the Pang Family!”

Finished talking, he got up and left. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Similar scenes were happening to the various great Dao Ancestors.

The nine great Dao Ancestors were forsaken by friends and allies, virtually becoming completely solitary.

Their fury could be imagined.

There were even many of their direct lineage martial artists, such as the likes of Pang Zhen, who defected from their camp.

Because they had a better choice now.

… …

On this day, in front of the Heavenspan Mountain, the nine great Dao Ancestors and the divine race’s eight great progenitors were shockingly present.

Over on the divine race’s side, there were roughly over a hundred people.

While on the nine great Dao Ancestors’ side, it appeared rather deserted.

When Tian Qing saw this scene, he could not help smiling as he said,?“Huhu,?the exalted Dao Ancestors actually only have these few people by their side, it’s beneath your dignity!”

Lin Chaotian’s expression was very ugly. Giving a cold snort, he said, “There are only just a few rule crystals. Why do I want so many people for?”

Tian Qing had an expression of sudden enlightenment and he said,?“Oh,?so that’s how it is!?Hahaha?…”

Amidst the laughter was full of mockery.

Lin Chaotian and the rest were angered until their expressions were livid.

Right at this time, many small black dots appeared on the horizon.

Everyone’s expression turned intent. Ye Yuan arrived!

The little black dots gradually grew bigger. A large dense group of people was following behind Ye Yuan. There were likely six to seven hundred people.

Treasure Pig was sleeping soundly in Ye Yuan’s arms.

Beside him, Sacred Ancestor High Priest, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, and the rest were shockingly present.

Among the others, Deva Fifth Blights were not in the minority too.

There were only a total of 1080 pieces of Heavenspan Tokens. But Ye Yuan’s side occupied more than half and was even more than the sum of the other two parties.

It could be seen what kind of shocking level Ye Yuan’s prestige reached.

Seeing those familiar figures behind Ye Yuan, the expressions of the few Dao Ancestors became very ugly.

“Zhang Zhen! Wang Jin! Xu Zheng! You guys are excellent! Very good!” Lin Chaotian’s eyes wanted to spew fire as gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Zhang Zhen, Wang Jin, and Xu Zheng were all generals under Lin Chaotian that were held in high regard.

Lin Chaotian also knew that his reputation had gone bad now. So the ones he sent out were all his trusted confidants.

But he did not expect that even these trusted subordinates turned their backs on him.

The confidants that he sent out, in the end, only a scanty few people returned.

Seeing Zhang Zhen and the rest currently, coupled with Tian Qing’s jeering remarks earlier, it could not help but upset him greatly.

Feeling Lin Chaotian’s powerful pressure, the expressions of Zhang Zhen and the rest also changed slightly.

After all, Lin Chaotian’s accumulated awe was too strong.

“Humph!?Lin Chaotian, that thing that you all did, don’t you all have any idea in your hearts? As long as one isn’t a fool, they won’t continue to work themselves to the bone for you!” Sacred Ancestor High Priest said with a cold snort.

Lin Chaotian’s power of rule blossomed and actually had an appearance like he was all set for a showdown.

“Is that so? Then this ancestor wants to see whether or not he can protect you all!”

The moment Lin Chaotian’s aura released, that terrifying pressure made everyone’s expressions change abruptly.

Ye Yuan was very strong, but he had not reached the realm of rule after all.

Furthermore, casting a big move like Nine Dragons Descending Upon the World might not be able to deal with Lin Chaotian too.

Lin Chaotian could not kill Ye Yuan, but if he wanted to kill Zhang Zhen these people, Ye Yuan probably could not protect them either.

They sought Ye Yuan’s protection but did not expect that Lin Chaotian was so decisive, planning on going on a killing spree outside of the Heavenspan Mountain.

On the other side, Tian Qing looked at this scene calmly, an appearance of watching a joke.

The human race’s internal friction, he naturally welcomed it greatly.

“Heh,?there’s also this ancestor!”

Ancestor Fire gave a cold laugh, the power of flame rule also bloomed quietly.

“Such a good thing, how can this ancestor miss it?” Dao Ancestor Destruction also joined in.

The nine great Dao Ancestors were actually going to join forces again.

These few people’s subordinates had practically all run off. They had a stomach full of grievances to begin with.

Now that there was a chance to make Ye Yuan suffer a loss. They were naturally happy to see it happen.

The few people were all looking like a cat that ate the canary, an appearance of cornering Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan had a calm expression from beginning to end. It was as if these few people did not exist at all.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly moved!

It was only to see his figure suddenly disappeared from where he originally was, already appearing in front of Ancestor Fire in a blink of an eye.

Ancestor Fire’s expression changed and he shouted, “Courting death!”

Terrifying flame power erupted in an instant.

The entire sky seemed to have been burned red; incomparably terrifying.

But Ye Yuan actually ignored this horrifying temperature and pointed a finger at Ancestor Fire.

The current Ye Yuan, his entire person seemed to be a sharp sword

A sharp sword that could cut through heaven and earth!

Seeing this scene, the expressions of Lin Chaotian and the rest changed wildly.

Sword Dao rule! He … He already reached the realm of Grand Ancestor!” Lin Chaotian cried out in surprise.

The current Ye Yuan had a terrifying power of rule surrounding his body.

That sharpness tore straight through the firmament, making people unable to look straight at it!

The Tian Qing who was originally harboring the attitude of watching a show, his pupils shrunk too.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan advanced to the realm of Grand Ancestor so quickly.

This guy’s improvement was simply unreasonable!

Just as everyone was shocked, Ye Yuan and Ancestor Fire faced off.

Boom!

A terrifying to the extreme force directly swept out.

Ancestor Fire spurted a mouthful of blood wildly, his figure flying out backward!

Tian Qing’s pupils constricted and he exclaimed, “What a swift and fierce sword! What an overbearing finger! This finger of his condensed without releasing, condensing Sword Dao to the extreme. Exploding it at one point, it’s far more brilliant than Ancestor Fire’s technique! The moment Ye Yuan entered the realm of Grand Ancestor, his strength already far surpassed the Grand Ancestor Proud Sword back then, reaching an unimaginable realm! Among the nine great Dao Ancestors, I’m afraid that apart from Dao Ancestor Life, there’s already none who is his match!”

This review was transmitted into everyone’s ears.

Everyone was inexplicably shocked.

Just one finger defeated Ancestor Fire!

This level of strength stunned everyone, including Lin Chaotian!

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, looking at Lin Chaotian as he said coolly, “You make a move then. But bear the consequences yourself.”

This domineering declaration made everyone feel shocked.

Lin Chaotian’s expression was even ugly to the extreme.

What a huge loss of face!
