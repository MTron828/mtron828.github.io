Chapter 1945: Crushed!

“Deathsoul Gate?” Bai Chen’s brows furrowed, clearly never heard of this name before.

But below, Leng Qiuling’s expression instantly became deathly pale.

“Bai Chen, this Deathsoul Gate is notorious in the Heavenspan World; raping and looting, committing arson and murder, their evil doings knows no limits. Ordinary martial artists tremble with fear when they see them. This Deathsoul Gate is incomparably mysterious, no one knows where they are hiding at. But places that they pass through is like locusts passing through, the people will definitely be plunged into misery and suffering.”

Leng Qiuling’s voice transmission made Bai Chen’s expression changed.

“Heh heh, looks like there are still some knowledgeable people in this city. You already know that my Deathsoul Gate isn’t to be trifled with. Hurry up and call Ye Yuan out. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not being courteous,” said the black-clothed man.

“Master has already been in seclusion for several years and isn’t able to meet you. If you want to request for pills, come again after some time,” Bai Chen’s expression was slightly dark as he said.

The black-clothed man gave a cold laugh and said, “People that my Deathsoul Gate wants to see, even if he’s inside a coffin, he’ll also have to come out!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

That appearance was incomparably arrogant, not taking Bai Chen, this True God Realm, seriously at all.

Bai Chen’s brows furrowed and his tone also became cold as he said, “Disturbing people’s closed-seclusion is akin to killing their parents! Your esteem self is a little too overbearing!”

But the black-clothed man said in derision, “Killing people’s parents, I, Mo Qing, have done it no idea how many times! What’s the harm in killing one more time? Since he’s not coming out, then I’ll kill until he comes out, starting from you!”

Finished talking, Mo Qing released his aura. The world power of a True God Realm suddenly released, clouds of black energy coiling up, giving people a soul-stirring feeling.

“Peak First Firmament True God!” Bai Chen’s expression changed as he cried out in surprise.

He broke through to the True God Realm for less than 10 years and just barely managed to stabilize his realm.

It was clearly somewhat taxing to deal with this Mo Qing.

The disparity of a minor realm of True God Realm was even greater than Celestial Deity Realm.

Even within the same small realm, the gap would also be massive.

“Je je, just the likes of you, this little baby who just entered the True God Realm, also dare to oppose me? Five Ghosts Open Gate!”

Mo Qing spread out both hands, five skulls flew out of his sleeves, turning into five streams of flowing light and flowing over toward Bai Chen.

Bai Chen’s face fell, a pitch-black long spear suddenly appeared in his hand.

This long spear was a middle-grade true god mystic treasure that Ye Yuan spent a huge price to get for him when at the Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital.

With a spear in his hands, Bai Chen’s entire imposing aura suddenly erupted.

The five skulls emitted sobbing sounds, lingering around Bai Chen’s ears.

Bai Chen was alarmed inwardly and hurriedly revolved his state of mind, wanting to resist this voice that struck the divine soul directly.

But, the noise that these five skulls emitted seemed to be magical, making him unable to focus.

Bai Chen was unresigned to fold his arms and wait for death, the tip of the spear shook, world power suddenly unfurling.

That bone-infesting sound immediately diminished significantly.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

Spear unleashing like rain, Bai Chen’s spear danced impenetrably, not giving the five skulls any chance.

Mo Qing gave a cold snort and said, “Brat, what capability does it count as to rely on the advantage of weapons! Since you want to court death, then I’ll send you off!”

Finished talking, the spell in his hand changed. The five skulls actually opened their mouths one after another, spitting out wisps of black fog towards Bai Chen.

Bai Chen’s expression changed greatly, immediately feeling like his spear technique sunk into a bog.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The five skulls were connected in heart and mind, under Mo Qing’s control, there was virtually no dead angles.

“Netherworld Five Ghosts Slaughter!”

The speed of those five skulls suddenly became incomparably fast. Bai Chen’s two eyes could not keep up at all.

Bang!

It was only to hear a loud bang. A skull directly breached Bai Chen’s world domain, smashing onto his protective divine essence, smashing him flying out.

Bai Chen tasted sweetness in his throat, spurting out a mouthful of blood.

Except, it was not over yet.

Those five skulls all arrived in quick succession, not giving him the slightest time to catch his breath at all. They were actually going to drive him to his death!

Bang!

Another blow, Bai Chen felt like his entire chest was rupturing.

Even if he had the advantage in weapons, he was still not this Mo Qing’s match!

In the city, inside the Martial Tower, Bai Tong let out a slight sigh, his figure about to dash out.

It was naturally impossible for him to watch Bai Chen get killed by the other party.

But right at this time, a voice came over.

“No need, let me!”

Bai Tong’s gaze turned sharp, his eyes revealing a look of astonishment.

In the city, everyone looked high up at the sky, anxious looks on their faces.

This Deathsoul Gate’s True God Realm powerhouse was too strong. Bai Chen who just entered the True God Realm was not his match at all.

Right at this time, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Bai Chen.

Bang!

Ye Yuan threw a punch casually, directly sending the five skulls scattering everywhere.

When Bai Chen saw Ye Yuan, he said with a look of pleasant surprise, “Master, you finally came out of seclusion!”

Ye Yuan turned around and said, “Swap with me. You go and rest.”

When Bai Chen saw Ye Yuan, his two eyes became wide-saucers as he said in surprise,

“Master, you ... you ...”

The current Ye Yuan was much taller, face as fair as jade, skin like condensed snow, valiant and heroic in bearing, looking like he returned to 17 or 18 years old, like he returned to boyhood from old age.

The present Ye Yuan was absolutely a handsome to the extreme pretty boy.

If not for that the contour profile of the face was still similar to Ye Yuan, Bai Chen virtually did not dare to recognize him.

Below, when everyone saw Ye Yuan’s face, each and every one of them was also incredibly surprised.

“Eh ... did His Excellency also cultivate Senior Bai Tong’s cultivation method, returning to boyhood from old age?”

“Tsk tsk, Lord Ye Yuan’s current face is really handsome until it makes people despair!”

“You look at those female cultivators, each and every one of them are becoming love-crazed!”

...

They did not know why Ye Yuan would have such a big change when he came out of seclusion this time.

They were even more unaware of how terrifying of an agony Ye Yuan suffered to be able to have his current transformation.

Only the Bai Tong inside the Martial Tower, his face revealed an astonished look.

He knew that Ye Yuan succeeded!

The current Ye Yuan looked just like a tender youth who was inexperienced in the ways of the world, looking harmless to man and beast.

No matter how one looked, Ye Yuan was like a scholar without the strength to bind a chicken.

But Bai Tong knew that Ye Yuan returned to his original simplicity!

His physical body was already cultivated to a flawless realm, all of his power fused into the bones and muscles.

Unassuming if not released, astonishing people once it was unleashed!

“You’re Ye Yuan? Looks very weak! Boy, take a trip with me!” Mo Qing looked at Ye Yuan and asked coolly.

The realm that Ye Yuan currently displayed was just Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity.

In Mo Qing’s view, it was naturally too weak.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly disappeared on the spot. Mo Qing’s two eyes went wide, his hair standing on end, a feeling of incredible danger welled up in his heart.

Without the slightest hesitation, he instantly summoned the five ghosts and compressed world power to the limit.

Bang!

Mo Qing’s figure immediately flew several miles away.

The five skulls directly fell apart to pieces, shattering into a pile of dust.

Mo Qing barely managed to stabilize his figure. Looking at Ye Yuan like he saw a ghost, he said in horror: “What powerful fleshy body strength! You ... You’re at the sixth transformation golden body? No, wait, even if it’s the sixth transformation golden body, it’s also impossible to shatter my Five Ghosts Open Gate with one punch!”

“Injured my disciples, you ... are courting death!” Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him as he said coldly.
