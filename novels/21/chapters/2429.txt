Chapter 2435: So What if I Hit You?

Origin Enlighten Mountain Range was the closest mountain range to Heavenspan Mountain. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The spiritual energy was abundant, being virtually no less than the Heavenspan Mountain.

This place was the bodhidharma of Dao Ancestor Life and also the forbidden place of all powerhouses.

At this time, two figures cut through the sky, arriving at the edge of Origin Enlighten Mountain Range.

“Halt! Who goes there?!” More than a dozen figures suddenly appeared, blocking the two people’s path.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ brows furrowed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “Lin Lang, you don’t even recognize this emperor? To actually dare stop me!”

This Lin Lang was a genius figure among the Lin Family’s descendants, a Deva Third Blight mighty expert.

Lin Lang cupped his fists and said smilingly, “So, it’s Lord Profound Secrets. Of course, you can enter Origin Enlighten Mountain Range. But ... he can’t!”

As he said, Lin Lang pointed at Ye Yuan.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets snorted coldly and said, “Lin Chaotian wants to see Saint Azure, now that I brought him here, you want to block him outside the door?”

The moment Lin Lang heard, he looked towards Ye Yuan in surprise and said, “You’re that Ye Yuan who let a formidable enemy go for a woman? Heh, he’s also worthy to be called Saint Azure? In my opinion, calling him a traitor is more like it!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ gaze turned dark. How could he not know that Lin Lang was doing it on purpose?

A measly little Lin Lang definitely did not dare to be so unbridled.

Behind him was definitely Lin Chaotian instigating it.

What did Lin Chaotian want to do?

At this time, Origin Enlighten Mountain Range already became the meeting place of the entire Heavenspan World’s wind and clouds. There must be countless people paying attention to this scene.

Lin Lang’s words were incisive!

Ye Yuan ignored Lin Lang, but turned to Profound Secrets and asked, “Who is he?”

Profound Secrets said in a deep voice, “Lin Lang, Lin Chaotian’s fourth-generation grandson!”

“Oh.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head lightly, indicating that he got it.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan flung a slap over indifferently.

This slap was too ordinary, ordinary until it was like an ordinary person.

But there were still several Deva Second and Third Blight experts protecting him by his side.

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, they immediately rushed up.

“Impudent! This place is Origin Enlighten Mountain Range, you actually dare to attack Young Master Lin Lang!”

A group of people swarmed up, rushing toward Ye Yuan.

While Lin Lang had a mocking expression on his face. How could such an ordinary slap land on his body?

Pah!

A clear slapping sound suddenly spread out. It was clearly audible in the entire mountain range.

Lin Lang was completely unprepared, his entire person directly being slapped flying, spinning dozens of rounds in the air before stabilizing his figure.

His face was burning hot and already had an additional five fingerprints.

The faces of those dozen over powerhouses changed wildly. They had clearly already stopped Ye Yuan. So how did Ye Yuan go over?

These dozen over people were all Deva Realm mighty experts. They actually did not even see clearly how Ye Yuan made his move.

Even Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets also had a shocked look.

After Ye Yuan broke through, it was still his first time seeing Ye Yuan make a move.

This kind of strength could simply one-shot Deva Third Blight powerhouses!

The scariest thing was that even he did not see clearly how Ye Yuan made his move.

Ye Yuan’s application of spacetime law already reached a level that made one’s hair stand on end!

One had to know, one blight tribulation one firmament. The gap between Deva Realm was incomparably huge!

Ye Yuan just broke through to Deva Realm, his strength actually already reached such a terrifying level.

When he reached the pinnacle of Deva Realm, how incredible would that be?

At this time, he finally somewhat understood why Lin Chaotian would dread him so.

Maybe after Ye Yuan grew up, Tian Qing was also merely thus, right?

They were really unable to imagine an existence that even Grand Ancestor Spacetime was helpless against, Ye Yuan could kill him at will.

“You! You dare to hit me?” Lin Lan looked at Ye Yuan, having a look of disbelief on his face.

His status was even higher than Pang Zhen, this so-called unpredictable child!

Because he was the descendant of Dao Ancestor Life!

Dao Ancestor Life was the sovereign called the number one Dao Ancestor!

Now, Ye Yuan actually sent him flying with one slap in front of Origin Enlighten Mountain Range’s gates.

This was simply unprecedented shame and humiliation!

What bullshit saint azure! He, Lin Lang, did not care.

There was only Dao Ancestor Life in his eyes!

“So what if I hit you?” Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back as he said coolly.

Lin Lang had a spiteful look as he said furiously, “You, a shameless person who betrayed the human race, what qualifications do you have to hit me?”

Pah!

His voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan sent him flying with a slap again.

This time, Lin Lang’s face was swollen on both sides.

Ten fingerprints were clearly visible.

“Say another word and I’ll kill you!” Ye Yuan was very calm. It was as if talking about something very ordinary.

Sure enough, Lin Lang did not dare to speak anymore.

Among the more than a dozen Deva powerhouses, each of them was dumbfounded with shock.

They were here to protect Lin Lang, but now, they completely became decorations!

Only when he saw Lin Lang shut up, did Ye Yuan slowly said, “This saint’s merits and demerits isn’t you, a junior’s turn, to come and comment! Even if Lin Chaotian is here, he’ll also have to be careful when speaking to this saint! Who gave you the courage to talk nonsense here? Get lost!”

Lin Lang’s expression changed wildly. Being yelled at to get lost in front of his own home’s door, his face was really utterly lost.

It was just that he did not expect that this Saint Azure was actually strong to this extent.

Profound Secrets was greatly relieved of his anger and said with a sneer, “Lin Lang, if you don’t know how high Saint Azure’s seniority is, best scram back and ask Lin Chaotian! This Heavenspan World’s myriad races’ leaders are also several hierarchies lower when they see Lord Saint Azure! Who the hell are you, to dare point your fingers and comment on him?”

... ...

At this time, in Origin Enlighten Hall, Lin Chaotian sighed slightly and said, “Lin Huan, you go!”

“Yes!” Behind him, a middle-aged man who was serving by his side stepped out of the ranks, and answered respectfully, and went out of the hall.

Only after Lin Huan left did Lin Chaotian say, “Looks like this ancestor still underestimated Saint Azure! This ancestor thought that he just broke through. So his strength is at most able to suppress Deva Second Blights, and he is absolutely not a match for this many Deva Third Blights. But who knew that his strength is actually already able to one-shot Deva Third Blights! Really too terrifying! Did you all see it?”

Ancestor Fire also had a shocked face as he said, “Deserving of being the eternal Saint Azure, this kind of monstrous strength is really too terrifying!”

Ancestor Water’s gaze was piercing as he said, “Brother Chaotian, do you really think that there’s something that can break the shackles on him?”

Lin Chaotian smiled and said, “Absolutely won’t be wrong! Back then, the Heavenspan Mountain had abnormal activities, spiritual energy resuscitating, with the broken world completely restoring back to how it was. All this coincided greatly with Ye Yuan’s appearance! Later on, this ancestor sent someone to investigate this. After several thousand years, I finally found a clue! Roughly over three thousand years ago, a heavenly shocking scene appeared above the sky of a small Jewelhill City of the Southern Border. The phantom of the Heavenspan Mountain actually descended upon a puny little county! This sort of thing is simply fantastical!”

“And this matter just happened to be exactly the same time when calculated according to the time of the Heavenspan Mountain’s spiritual energy resuscitating! This shows that back then in Jewelhill City, there must have been an earth-shattering huge incident that happened! At first, what major incident can there be in a puny little country? Originally, this ancestor had no clues either! But as luck would have it, the place that Ye Yuan first appeared was precisely in Jewelhill City!”
