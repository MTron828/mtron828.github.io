Chapter 1239: Divine Beast Realm

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What kind of a freak is this guy?”

“E-Exhausting me to death!”

“Can’t, I can’t anymore! I ... I can’t muster up a trace of essence energy anymore!”

These few people wailed their lungs out. They unleashed all of their abilities but was still unable to shake Ye Yuan in the slightest.

The looks that they currently looked at Ye Yuan with at this time were full of fear and shock.

This person was too strong!

He stood there unmoved and did not even attack, and they were already tired out.

This way of fighting was simply too despairing.

Ye Yuan approached with a smile, looking at them.

Those few demons almost jumped up like they had their tails stepped on.

“Y-Y-You ... What are you doing? I’m warning you, our young patriarch is very formidable! When he comes over, you’re dead for sure!”

Ye Yuan was smiling, but in their eyes, it was like a weasel greeting the chicken happy new year.

“Your young patriarch? You have the dragon race, tiger race, phoenix race, among you all. I’m very curious about what kind of existence your young patriarch is.”

Ye Yuan had long seen through that these few demons were actually almost pooling together the Four Symbols Family Clans.

Could it be that inside this space, there was still another Four Symbols Family Clans?

These people’s strength were not strong, just initial-stage Tier 9.

But their age was not considered old either. In the demon race, they could absolutely count as geniuses.

But their overall strength was more than a magnitude stronger than the demon race outside.

“I-If you have the guts, let us go. When our young patriarch comes, you’ll definitely get it!” said one of them.

Ye Yuan laughed when he heard that and said, “Okay, I’ll let you guys go and wait right here for your young patriarch to come.”

Those few people were akin to being granted amnesty when they heard and fled helter-skelter.

“Big Brother, this place is so strange!” White Light said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This place seems to be ... rather interesting.”

Before long, those few demons who fled previously returned again.

But this time, there were a lot more that came together with them.

A group of people surrounded a young man. That young man had a haughty look, but his strength was not weak; already peak Tier 9.

But this bit of strength, Ye Yuan naturally did not place it in his sights.

“You’re the human who barged into the Divine Beast Realm and even injured my clan members? Now, are you prepared for a reckoning?”

That young man thought nothing of Ye Yuan at all. With his strength, dealing with a human initial-stage divine king, wasn’t it capturing with ease?

Ye Yuan did not reply the other party’s question, but he said with great interest, “So, this place is called the Divine Beast Realm. No wonder there are so many Four Symbols Family Clans’ demons. It’s just, I wonder what relationship is there between you guys and the Divine Realm’s Four Symbols Family Clans?”

“Insolence! Young Patriarch is asking you a question, what’s with your attitude?” someone immediately berated by the side.

Young Patriarch’s face also darkened.

He was arrogant, but that one opposite was even more arrogant than him!

He discovered that Ye Yuan did not take him, this young patriarch, seriously at all.

While at this time, there was someone in the crowd with shifty eyes swiveling around, currently sizing Ye Yuan up carefully.

“I-I-It’s ... It’s you! Y-Y-You ... Why are you here?!” exclaimed that person suddenly.

The young patriarch frowned, with his face revealing displeasure as he said solemnly, “You know him?”

At this time, everyone all revealed curious looks.

That clan member was called Long Zhen. Among them, he was not considered very outstanding.

Back then, going out to have a trial, he was even pummeled black and blue and came back. This matter was the Divine Beast Realm’s laughing stock for a very long time.

It was just that time passed, his talent also gradually exhibited, and he also hugged Young Patriarch’s thigh, that was why everyone did not dare to make fun of him.

Long Zhen seemed to be somewhat afraid of Ye Yuan and said with an ugly expression, “He ... He’s that punk who impersonated the dragon lord back then in the Endless World!”

The moment these words came out, everyone was stunned, and immediately burst out laughing.

“Hahaha ... Long Zhen, you wouldn’t have eaten the wrong medicine, right? You’re saying that this is the person who bashed you into a pig’s head back then? How can a Lower Realms’ aboriginal possibly show up in the Divine Beast Realm?”

“Long Zhen, looks like a considerable psychological shadow was left on you back then! Now, when you see a human, you take him to be that person.”

“Yeah, just how many years had passed, how can a human possibly cultivate to initial-stage Divine King?”

...

Those clan members all made fun of Long Zhen. They totally did not believe that Ye Yuan was that guy who pummeled him into a pig’s head back then.

However, the astonishment in Ye Yuan’s heart was not the slightest bit lesser than Long Zhen’s.

Just now, when Long Zhen cried out, he felt that he looked familiar.

Later, hearing their conversation, he was even more shocked.

The one who was similarly unbelievably shocked was also White Light.

He also knew about the matter of Ye Yuan thrashing the dragon lord back then. He did not expect that they actually met here!

The two people exchanged a glance, both revealing a look of incredulity.

Could it be that this place was actually ... behind that Dark Forest?

This was also a little too miraculous, right?

“You guys ... Why don’t you guys believe me? He ... He’s really that punk!” Long Zhen could not help saying vexedly and angrily.

Young Patriarch gave a cold snort and said coolly, “No matter who he is, for a human showing up here, there’s only one outcome. That is death!”

Done talking, Young Patriarch lifted his hand, and it was a palm move. The sound of a dragon roar came howling out.

“Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!”

Seeing this move, Ye Yuan smiled, even White Light smiled.

Even Li-er who was quiet also smiled.

Showing off in the presence of an expert was talking about this, right?

Ye Yuan unleashed a palm casually, similarly the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!

One palm unleashing, the clan members on the Divine Beast Realm’s side all visibly changed countenance.

How could this human know the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm?

However, they already could not afford to over-think anymore.

Two azure dragons met on a narrow path, looking like the commotion would rend the air.

But sadly, the young patriarch’s azure dragon was immediately crushed.

Dealing with the young patriarch, Ye Yuan did not even need to utilize the divine rank dragon wave. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He possessed a Nine Transformations Golden Body. Casually displaying a martial technique, the power was also not what the average person could withstand.

Clearly, the young patriarch did not have this qualification yet.

Boom!

Young Patriarch was directly sent flying out.

“You ... How do you know the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm?”

Ye Yuan did not deal a killing blow. That young patriarch just suffered some light injuries. But the astonishment in his heart could not be put into words.

“Just the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm, is it very rare?” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly.

Everyone was speechless.

Was it not rare?

In this Divine Beast Realm, those able to cultivate the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm, this kind of divine technique, could be counted on one hand.

The young patriarch was one of them.

This kind of Divine Dao martial technique was not what ordinary people could cultivate.

But Ye Yuan’s attainments on this path was clearly more than a grade higher than Young Patriarch.

They thought that Ye Yuan was posturing. Actually, Ye Yuan was just stating a fact.

Voice of the Dragon God, this martial technique, was god knows how many times stronger than the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm.

Furthermore, the dragon race Divine Dao martial techniques that Ye Yuan grasped were far from just these.

“Now, can you answer this young master’s question? Actually, I just want to know what kind of region this place is,” Ye Yuan asked coolly as he looked at everyone whose shock were incapable of increasing further.
