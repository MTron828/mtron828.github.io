Chapter 1896: Magnanimous

“Do you dare or not?!”

The world was silent, there was only Ye Yuan’s voice reverberating.

What difference was there between such a declaration and committing suicide?

“Hahaha!” All of a sudden, Lin Changqing laughed wildly without ceasing.

After a while, the laughter gradually stopped, Lin Changqing said in a clear voice, “Do I dare or not? Do you think I dare or not? If this Empyrean doesn’t even dare to answer the challenge of an ant, what Great Dao do I still need to seek?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, a stream of soul force crept out.

“Since that’s the case, let’s sign a divine soul contract!”

Lin Changqing snickered and said, “Why? Are you still scared that this Empyrean will go back on my word?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Aren’t you scared that I’ll renege?”

Lin Changqing’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold snort, “Is this Empyrean scared of you?”

On Lin Changqing’s side, a stream of soul force also extended out.

Two streams of soul force met in the air, an aura of Heavenly Dao merged into the two people’s divine souls.

This 2000-year bet was officially effective.

If anyone violated the divine soul contract, they would get a backlash from Heavenly Dao, the consequences extremely serious.

“Heh, really a foolish ant! Want to stipulate a battle with this Empyrean, you also have to accept the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill first. In that case, you at least still have that tiny trace of hope. As for now ... haha ...”

Lin Changqing was pleased with himself for a while because what could be accomplished in 2000 years, he was all too clear in his heart.

The Heavenspan World had so many Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas, but it had never been heard of that anyone could break through from Celestial Deity to Heavenly Empyrean within 200 years.

Moreover, these 2000 years’ time, could it be that he, Lin Changqing, would be marching on the spot?

With his talent, 2000 years was enough to make great progress!

In this battle, he did not have any possibility of losing.

“Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill, are you talking about this?”

A small bottle appeared in Ye Yuan’s hand at no idea when. The moment the mouth of the bottle opened, a medicinal fragrance that made people asphyxiated instantly suffused between heaven and earth.

Just that tiny bit of medicinal fragrance that escaped already made people intoxicated.

Lin Changqing’s pupils constricted, looked at the small bottle in Ye Yuan’s hand in disbelief, and cried out in shock, “You ... How can you have a vast spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill?”

Being born in a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda, Lin Changqing naturally knew how difficult it was to refine a vast spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill.

Even in great imperial capitals, the chances of a void spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill appearing was small until it could be ignored too.

Although rank five divine pills already did not have any effect on Lin Changqing, this did not mean that this medicinal pill that Ye Yuan took out was worthless.

On the contrary, this one medicinal pill was invaluable, its price unable to be estimated!

If Ye Yuan placed this Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill in great imperial capitals, it would absolutely drive all Celestial Deity powerhouses, even True God powerhouses crazy.

As for imperial capitals, that went even more without saying.

Vast spirit divine pills only had a possibility of appearing in a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda, this kind of place.

Furthermore, the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill, this kind of level nine medicinal pill, forget about Five-star Alchemy Gods, even for Seven-star Alchemy Gods, barely anyone could refine it too.

Above divine-grade, purple spirit, void spirit, vast spirit, end spirit, spiritlink, each rank was harder than the last.

The further up, the more terrifying the difficulty.

Reaching this kind of boundary, the difficulty of refining was completely unrelated to the hard work of the alchemist.

Some alchemists whose talents were ordinary could reach Four-star Alchemy God, Five-star Alchemy God, even Six-star Alchemy God through effort.

But, in terms of medicinal pill quality, they could not possibly reach vast spirit divine-grade this level, no matter how hard they work too.

Refining this level of medicinal pill, one needed to have an extremely profound understanding of Alchemy Dao.

If using purple spirit divine-grade has units, between void spirit and vast spirit, was separated by a million purple spirits!

To the vast majority of alchemists, they could not possibly refine a vast spirit divine pill in all their lives too!

Vast spirit divine pills this kind of thing, they only belong to those Alchemy Gods with exceedingly high talents.

Lin Changqing was shocked beyond words, he used a purple spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill to humiliate Ye Yuan?

Truly laughable!

Unrelated to self-esteem, would the Ye Yuan who possessed a vast spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill care about a measly purple spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill?

Tong’er had a mocking look on his face and said, “How can he have? Of course he refined it himself.”

Lin Changqing’s face was finally no longer composed. He said with a disbelieving look, “He refined it himself? Do you think that this Empyrean will believe it? A Celestial Deity Realm refining a vast spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill? Do you think I’m stupid?”

Tong’er shrugged his shoulders and said coolly, “Believing it or not is your business. I have no need to prove anything to you; Ye Yuan naturally needs to do that even less.”

Lin Changqing suddenly laughed loudly and said, “I understand, this medicinal pill must have been obtained by you inside a mystic realm! But, so what if it’s a vast spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill? In front of this Empyrean, you still don’t have any chance!”

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan casually flung his hand, the small bottle in his hand flew over toward Lin Changqing.

Subconsciously, Lin Changqing reached his hand out to receive, catching the small bottle in his hand.

“This medicinal pill doesn’t have any use to me. If you have any junior that needs it, I’ll give it to you.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Everyone looked at this scene with incredible shock, eyeballs almost popping out.

This ... This was also too reckless, right?

That was a vast spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill, he was actually going to gift it to his deathmatch opponent?

Those Celestial Deity all cried out in alarm and went crazy! It was too much of a wanton waste of God’s good gifts!

Pfft!

But Leng Qiuling, Tong’er, and the rest could not resist laughing.

Previously, Lin Changqing used a medicinal pill to humiliate Ye Yuan. Now, Ye Yuan returned an eye for an eye, using a vast spirit divine pill to retaliate. This was much more effective than a measly purple spirit divine pill.

Lin Changqing’s expression was extremely ugly. Logically speaking, he should destroy this medicinal pill right away.

But he hesitated!

A vast spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill was too precious!

Subconsciously, he could not bear to destroy it.

He naturally did not need this medicinal pill. But just as Ye Yuan said, he had people in his family who needed it!

A vast spirit Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill was equivalent to a True God powerhouse.

Furthermore, the potential of this True God would get a massive development and might become a Heavenly Empyrean powerhouse in the future.

When medicinal pills reached vast spirit this level, the significance was absolutely not as simple as being a medicinal pill.

Otherwise, with Lin Changqing’s experience and horizons, how could he possibly care about a mere rank five divine pill?

“Don’t need to feel embarrassed. Even though you nearly killed me today, I still have to thank you. You brought me Li-er’s news, this is a piece of tremendous good news to me. In the future, if you still need any medicinal pills, you can come to find me to refine anytime. Uh ... but you still need to prepare the spirit medicines yourself.”

Seemingly seeing through what Lin Changqing was thinking, Ye Yuan took another stab viciously.

But these words, it came from the bottom of his heart.

Although he was almost killed today, being able to get Li-er’s new, he was very happy instead. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At the very least, he knew that Li-er was doing very well currently.

Bang!

Lin Changqing was angered until his entire body trembled. The moment he used strength, the small bottle shattered to dust.

The vast spirit divine pill naturally dissipated with the wind too.

Lin Changqing stared intently at Ye Yuan, wanting to see a hint of heartache from his eyes.

However, he was disappointed.

Ye Yuan’s expression was calm to the extreme. There was no visible change in countenance toward the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill’s destruction at all.

This meant that he really did not care!

Lin Changqing was practically going nuts, he did not expect that today would actually play out like this.
