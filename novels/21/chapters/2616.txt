Chapter 2622: True Grade!

“Uncle Wen!”

“Yes!”

In the crowd, a fist shadow rumbled out. Kan Feihong was directly blasted into meat paste.

By the side, Sun Xu’s expression suddenly changed, not understanding why.

Everyone looked sideways. They saw an old man and a youth in the crowd.

The young man walked out slowly and said with a cold snort, “Surrendering without fighting, humiliating the Pill Alliance’s face, you deserve to die!”

“L-Lord Holy Son? Cloud Leisure Establishment’s Sun Xu pays respect to Lord Holy Son!” Sun Xu’s expression changed slightly, already guessing Cang Yongning’s identity.

Beside Ye Yuan, Luo Yunqing also had a solemn look as he said, “That old man’s strength is quite strong. He’s a Jade Sovereign Heaven expert!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, paying no attention to it.

Since it was an alchemy competition, he was not afraid that the Pill Alliance would cause problems.

While killing people was easy, wanting to restore reputation was difficult.

Wanting to win back face, the Pill Alliance would have to compete in alchemy honestly with him!

Cang Yongning did not even look at Sun Xu, but he turned to Ye Yuan and said with contempt, “The light of a firefly also dares to contend for glory with the bright moon! Brat, you dare to provoke my Pill Alliance, do you know the consequences?”

The moment Cang Yongning took the stage, he gave people a powerful deterrence.

That aura of looking down on everything made people give sidelong glances.

Ye Yuan seemed to be an ant in his eyes.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Provoke the Pill Alliance??Huhu,?do you want face or not? Your Pill Alliance boycotted my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect and forced Brother Luo to break his sword and lower his head, and coerced my disciple to become a furnace! But now, you want to make a false counter-charge, is your Pill Alliance all born under the year of the Dog?”

Cang Yongning’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “How razor-tongued and eloquent, boy, arrogance needs to be backed using strength! Otherwise, you’ll only become a laughingstock! Do you really think that by winning some trash, you have the qualifications to challenge the Pill Alliance?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “You’re associated with this trash, doesn’t that make you a trash too? So your Pill Alliance is a pile of garbage?”

“Hahaha?…”

Ye Yuan’s words immediately attracted a burst of laughter.

Cang Yongning’s face fell, and he said with a cold snort, “Punk, you’re very arrogant! Since you’re so arrogant, do you dare to bet your life or not?”

“What’s not …”

“No way!” Ye Yuan spoke halfway and was interrupted by Luo Yunqing.

Ye Yuan’s existence was the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s future hope, there must not be any accidents.

This Holy Son gave him an extremely dangerous feeling. He could not watch Ye Yuan take the risk unfeelingly.

It was not that he was not confident in Ye Yuan, but that he did not want Ye Yuan to take risks.

Cang Yongning laughed mockingly and said, “If you don’t dare, kneel down and admit fault!”

“Brother Luo, calm down. You don’t think that I wouldn’t even be able to win a trash, right?” Ye Yuan gave Luo Yunqing a glance and said with a faint smile.

Luo Yunqing’s brows furrowed slightly, but he was still not at ease.

This young man was guarded by a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. He was definitely not an ordinary person in the Pill Alliance.

With the Pill Alliance sending him here, they probably had the confidence that he would definitely win.

Therefore, he had no choice but to be careful.

Ye Yuan looked at Cang Yongning and said, “I’ll bet with you!”

Cang Yongning smiled and said, “Okay, you and I draw up an origin divinity curse! The loser will die by origin divinity backlash!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “As you wish!”

Luo Yunqing still wanted to say something, but Ye Yuan said, “Brother Lou, shrinking back here, it will waste all the previous efforts! You wouldn’t think that the Pill Alliance really only had this sort of trash, right? Their strength is stronger than we imagine! Furthermore, only by defeating the holy son, can it demonstrate the Pill Pavilion’s might even more!”

In reality, Ye Yuan had long felt it.

The Pill Alliance was an extremely powerful organization. Their heavenly alchemists had gained knowledge on the essence of Alchemy Dao.

In fact, it achieved the same wondrous effect with different means as his alchemy path.

The opponents that Ye Yuan defeated along the way, their basic skills were all extremely solid and their strength was extremely formidable.

And these were still merely just the heavenly alchemists garrisoning outside.

Then how strong were the Pill Alliance’s internal heavenly alchemists?

With Ye Yuan fighting all this way, it was in order to force out the Pill Alliance’s true strength.

If they could not even see the opponent’s true strength, then this war need not be fought anymore too.

Since this young man in front of him was able to become the holy son, his strength was naturally extraordinary.

At least, it would definitely be much stronger than those before!

Luo Yunqing’s expression flickered indeterminately and he could only say, “Then you be careful!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, turned around, and set up an origin divinity curse with Cang Yongning!

But after signing it, Cang Yongning laughed loudly and said, “Boy, wait to suffer the origin divinity curse and die! You probably haven’t even figured out the grades of heavenly pills, right? The world only knows that heavenly pills are divided into nine grades, and grand completion ninth grade is the limit! But they don’t know that my Pill Alliance can refine even higher grade heavenly pills! Above ninth grade is true grade!”

One stone stirred up a thousand ripples!

Cang Yongning’s words immediately caused a huge response.

They had never heard before that there was an even higher quality above ninth grade!

Because no one had ever been able to refine it!

Ninth grade was already a legendary grade in their mind, much less true grade that had never been heard of!

“True grade, what kind of grade is that?”

“Since the Pill Alliance’s holy son said so, doesn’t that mean that he can refine it?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“It turns out that he dug a hole for Ye Yuan!”

… …

After the shock, people also understood one after another, the reason why Cang Yongning was betting his life with Ye Yuan.

He was certain that Ye Yuan had never heard of true grade before. It was naturally even more impossible to refine true grade.

As long as Ye Yuan signed an origin divinity curse with him, then Ye Yuan would die without a doubt!

What a malicious guy!

Luo Yunqing’s gaze turned sharp and he said in a cold voice, “Boy, you cheated!”

Without another word, Luo Yunqing’s long sword was unsheathed and he rushed over.

Uncle Wen gave a cold snort and slammed a fist out.

Boom!

With a collision, Luo Yunqing was actually shocked until he fell back.

But Uncle Wen did not budge an inch!

“Jade Face Swordsman, indeed extraordinary! Blocked my punch and you can actually come out safe and sound!” Uncle Wen praised.

But Luo Yunqing’s expression was very ugly.

This old man’s strength was extremely strong, he was not a match!

“Brother Luo, betting lives was something that both parties were willing to do in the first place! Since the origin divinity contract is already signed, let’s talk about it after fighting! Moreover, I believe that it isn’t such an easy thing for him to want to refine true grade either, right?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Cang Yongning smiled and said, “That’s right! Refining true grade can come by with luck but not by seeking it! In the Pill Alliance, many elders have refined true grade and they could only reach it one-in-ten as well. But my strength has already surpassed many elders! When I refine five times, there will be one time where it can reach the realm of true grade! Otherwise, how do you think I became the holy son?”

True grade, this was an unfamiliar term to everyone.

They had never heard of it before, let alone seen it.

But without a doubt, this was definitely a realm that was out of reach.

The Pill Alliance’s elders were at least grade four heavenly alchemists too!

This kind of realm can only reach one-in-ten too; it could be seen how strong Cang Yongning’s strength was!

Before this, Ye Yuan had never heard of this realm before as well.

Even Zhong Jianchou’s jade slips did not have it.

Clearly, Zhong Jianchou had never reached this realm before too.

Ye Yuan’s heart sank slightly. This Pill Alliance’s background was deep beyond imagination.

One could tell from Cang Yongning’s words that most likely, the vast majority of the Pill Alliance’s grade four heavenly alchemists, could reach the realm of true grade!
