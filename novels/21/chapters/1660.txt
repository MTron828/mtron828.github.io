Chapter 1664 Exposed

“Careful, Young Patriarch!”

From far away, when Uncle Huang saw Ye Yuan’s seal, his face similarly revealed a look of great shock.

It was only to see his figure suddenly dash out, wanting to save Jing Lu.

However, he was too far away. Ye Yuan’s Nirvana Seal arrived in an instant.

“Netherkill Extreme Light Sword!”

Seeing such a terrifying seal art, the scent of death hit him head-on. How could Jing Lu still dare to slight it? The moment he made his move, it was his strongest attack.

He was risking his life to counterattack!

Breaking through to become a second-layered heaven Divine Lord, the power of his sword techniques naturally increased greatly too.

But in front of Ye Yuan’s Nirvana Seal, it still somewhat paled in comparison.

This Nirvana Seal gave people a very strange feeling like it was an envoy who hooked the soul; very terrifying.

Rumble!

The two attacks collided together like comets!

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan and Jing Lu flew out backward at the same time.

Ning Tianping’s expression changed and hurriedly went up to catch Ye Yuan, exclaiming, “Your Excellency, are you alright?”

Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and said, “I’m fine, go!”

Ning Tianping was shocked inwardly and immediately did not dare to stay, bringing Ye Yuan, figure speeding away like lightning.

“Young Patriarch!”

Uncle Huang also rushed over, but Jing Lu’s situation was clearly not too good, life force rapidly dissipating. It looked like he could not survive anymore.

Everyone present was incomparably shocked.

“D-Dead?”

“My eyesight isn’t failing, right? Young Patriarch Jing Lu died just like this?”

“What seal art is that? To actually be able to kill a second-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse?”

“Can’t be ... that this seal art is the treasure he obtained in the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate, right?”

...

Uncle Huang’s eyes turned blood-red, his gaze revealing a murderous look as he roared angrily, “Ye Yuan, if I don’t kill you, I’m not human!”

Finished talking, he put away Jing Lu’s corpse, turned into a stream of flowing light, and chased after.

Fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord, his strength was far stronger than third-layered heaven Divine Lord, practically equivalent to a major realm.

His speed was far from what Ning Tianping could compare to.

Ning Tianping sprinted madly. Suddenly, he sensed a terrifying aura catching up from the rear and his expression could not help changing.

“Your Excellency, that person caught up!”

Ye Yuan’s complexion was pale. His injury was not serious, but that Nirvana Seal’s consumption on his divine essence was too terrifying.

His entire person seemed to be wrung dry!

One had to know, Ye Yuan’s divine essence could not compare to ordinary people. When battling, in terms of endurance, he was even stronger than first-layered heaven Divine Lords.

Even so, him using one Nirvana Seal move nearly drained him into a human jerky!

This move could only be used as a trump card.

Otherwise, firing this move out, he would be directly invalidated.

But the power of this move also indeed surpassed imagination. It was even stronger than the Misty Sword Art.

“Ignore him! I’ll recover divine essence first!” Ye Yuan said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Kid, you were too reckless! With your current strength, provoking such a powerful opponent, isn’t this courting death?” Mo Lifei suddenly said.

Ye Yuan just smiled palely and did not speak.

But Ning Tianping said, “Just a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord, His Excellency still hasn’t taken him seriously.”

Mo Lifei could not help choking. Could it be that this kid still had other methods?

But just now, when Ye Yuan fired out the Nirvana Seal, Mo Lifei was deeply astonished.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s divine essence was actually able to support the Nirvana Seal.

That kind of power was truly terrifying.

The three people, you chase, I ran, ten thousand miles in a flash. Riverluck Capital City became smaller and smaller.

Right at this time, several figures suddenly appeared at the horizon.

The moment Uncle Huang saw, he could not help being overjoyed as he called out, “Xiang Yunfei, Sun Qing, Zheng Shan, stop that boy for me! They killed Young Patriarch!”

These few people were precisely Melody Sun Imperial City’s reinforcements!

When the few people heard Uncle Huang’s yell, they involuntarily trembled all over, hurriedly stopped Ning Tianping.

Ning Tianping no longer had a way out being pincered in front and from the rear.

Finally, the four people formed an encirclement ring.

“Huang Hai, what’s going on? Is what you said just now true?” Xiang Yunfei looked at Uncle Huang and asked in a solemn voice.

Huang Hai’s expression was very ugly as he gritted his teeth and said, “Talk again after this matter is over. After killing these two villains, this old man will naturally take my own life to offer an apology!”

Xiang Yunfei trio’s hearts sunk to rock-bottom. It seemed like Young Patriarch Jing Lu really died!

Jing Lu’s status in Melody Sun Imperial City was too high. The impact of his death on Melody Sun Imperial City was too great. Saying that it was an earthquake was also not overboard.

Xiang Yunfei’s two eyes narrowed, looked at Ning Tianping, and said in a cold voice, “You killed Young Patriarch? Do you know what kind of consequences you have to bear?”

“Not him, it’s that Origin Deity Realm kid!” Huang Hai interjected.

The three people’s expressions changed. Sun Qing said angrily, “Huang Hai, do you take us to be three-year-old kids? Can an Origin Deity Realm kid kill Young Patriarch?”

Huang Hai said in a solemn voice, “If it was that kid who made a move, could this old man not be alert? It’s because it was too unexpected that this old man couldn’t save Young Patriarch in time! Moreover, Young Patriarch was killed in a direct confrontation by that Origin Deity Realm kid after breaking through to second-layered heaven Divine Lord!”

“WHAT?!”

The three people spoke in unison, their eyeballs almost popping out.

They felt that Huang Hai was simply telling bald-faced lies.

Origin Deity Realm, forget about killing in direct confrontation, even sneaking attacking, it was also impossible to kill a second-layered heaven Divine Lord!

Huang Hai knew that they did not believe and said in a solemn voice, “This matter was personally witnessed by thousands of people, can this old man still talk nonsense? Enough crap, after capturing these two punks, I’ll tell you guys more in detail.”

The three people were incomparably shocked in their hearts, but locked onto Ning Tianping and Ye Yuan from far away.

“Kid, cripple your divine sea right now and surrender without resisting. I can make it painless for you!” Xiang Yunfei said coldly.

Ye Yuan had long swallowed divine essence recovering medicinal pills. At this time, his divine essence already recovered a little.

Hearing Xiang Yunfei’s words, Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “Was your head pressed by a door? Why should I cripple my divine sea? Jing Lu provoked me time and again, and already had killing intent towards this young master. Not killing him, do I wait for him to come and kill me?”

Seeing Xiang Yunfei three people, how could Ye Yuan still not understand what was going on?

This Jing Lu clearly called for reinforcements to come and kill him!

Xiang Yunfei said with a cold snort, “Razor-tongued! Since that’s the case, then this seat will personally take action and let you suffer the anguish of purgatory on earth, so as to comfort Young Patriarch’s spirit in heaven!”

This Xiang Yunfei’s strength was the strongest, a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse!

At this time, him attacking in a violent rage, the impetus was extremely horrifying.

Smacking a palm out, the powerful world power seemed to be like a large mountain crushing over.

“Damn it! You, punk, can really make trouble! Only at the Origin Deity Realm and you attracted such a powerful opponent! Forget it, you guys quickly escape. This seat will risk my life to help you all escape!” Mo Lifei heaved a sigh and was about to use the last trace of his remnant soul’s power to cover the two people’s escape.

But Ye Yuan said, “Senior, don’t have to do so, it’s still not the end of the road yet! Tianping, go!”

Rumble!

After a huge rumble, Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping ... vanished!

Xiang Yunfei’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “Mn? Where are they?”

Swoosh!

A stream of flowing light suddenly sprang out, directly flying past Xiang Yunfei.
