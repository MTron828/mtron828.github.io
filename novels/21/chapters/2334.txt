Chapter 2338: Prodigal Son

The woman in red’s expression turned cold as she said, “Empyrean spirit treasure? Sir, are you making fun of this girl?”

There were still some martial artists buying swords in the Sword Pavilion currently. Hearing these words, they could not help glancing over sideways with mocking faces.

Those able to enter the Primeval War Realm were all Heavenly Emperor powerhouses. No one would use Empyrean spirit treasures.

This guy asked for Empyrean spirit treasures the moment he opened his mouth. He was used to being poor, right? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

But Ye Yuan asked with a serious look, “Not making fun of Miss. I’m serious! Either way, the swords here are all made of energy and laws. Since it’s able to create heavenly emperor spirit treasures, then it can create Empyrean spirit treasures too, right?”

Seeing that Ye Yuan’s expression did not seem to be fake, the woman in red said with a frown, “Can is can. It’s just that ... no one has ever bought Empyrean spirit treasures before. Furthermore, you’re using Empyrean spirit treasures to deal with Heavenly Emperors, isn’t this a joke?”

By the side, a burly man said mockingly, “Haha, Miss Redleaf, can’t you tell yet? This kid is clearly a pauper who can’t take out god of war points to buy Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a nod, “That’s right, I just arrived today and can’t take out too many god of war points. Therefore, I can only substitute it with Empyrean spirit treasures.”

Redleaf was enlightened and said, “Like this huh, then you can go outside the city to hunt down fierce beasts and obtain god of war points. Hunting those lowest grade Azure Light Beasts, the money saved can still be used to buy a heavenly emperor spirit treasure.”

Azure Light Beasts were one of the lowest level fierce beasts in the Primeval War Realm. Its strength was relatively weak, but the god of war points obtained from hunting it was also pitifully little.

Every 100 Azure Light Beasts killed would only obtain one god of war point.

However, Azure Light Beasts were actually not as easy to kill as Redleaf said.

They appeared in groups and often went together in hundreds or thousands.

Furthermore, the so-called weak was just relatively speaking.

Even if it was the Azure Light Beast, their strength was significantly stronger than ordinary First Firmament Heavenly Emperors too.

To martial artists who were weaker, wanting to obtain sufficient god of war points was not easy.

“Haha, Miss Redleaf, let him do what he wants! This kid is just a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor. Wanting to get the god of war points for a heavenly emperor spirit treasure, who knows how many years he’ll have to wait until!” That burly man mocked once more.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he glanced at that burly man.

Who knew that that burly man glared and threatened, “What, brat? Not convinced? Keep staring! Do you believe that I will kill you every time I see you?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Very good, I’ve remembered you!”

When the burly man heard Ye Yuan’s words, he could not help laughing loudly as he said, “Haha, I am really so scared! Did you guys hear that, he’s remembered me! Brat, then you remember my name, Qin Hu! This name will become your nightmare in the Primeval War Realm!”

“It’s over. This kid probably doesn’t know who Qin Hu is, right? A young calf doesn’t fear the tiger!”

“Qin Hu is a famous demon king. Furthermore, he likes to stir trouble a lot and already killed until many unpredictable children don’t dare to go out of the city anymore!”

“He’s a Fourth Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. It’s said that his ranking already reached the top 8000!”

... ...

When everyone saw Ye Yuan’s unconvinced appearance, each and every one of them could not help secretly shaking their heads.

Newcomers should be more low-profile, they could not afford to provoke everyone.

But Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Qin Hu, mn, I’ve remembered this name. This period of time, you don’t go out of the city anymore. It’s very dangerous!”

Qin Hu’s face turned black, and he said with a cold smile, “Nice one, punk! Not many people dared to talk to me this way in this Cloudaid City yet! In order to reward your bravery, I will make your divine soul tremble!”

But Ye Yuan could not be bothered to pay attention to him anymore and turned to Redleaf and said, “Miss has misunderstood. This Ye doesn’t want one sword, but 1012 swords! Additionally, I need 12 Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures.”

Redleaf had a shocked face and said, “You just came today and already have so many god of war points?”

The others, inclusive of Qin Hu, all had suspicious faces.

Clearly, they did not think that Ye Yuan had this strength.

“Heh, just you brag! You, a newcomer, can have so many god of war points?” Qin Hu said with a look of disbelief.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to care about him and shrugged as he said to Redleaf, “This Ye isn’t bored until the extent where I’ll come and make fun of Miss Redleaf. However, I only have 247 god of war points, the remaining seven god of war points, using it to exchange for a thousand over Empyrean spirit treasures should be sufficient, right?”

Ye Yuan thought so. After all, Empyrean spirit treasures were worthless in this place, being less than even trash.

Apart from Ye Yuan, no one was interested at all.

Redleaf’s vermilion lips opened wide, unable to close her mouth for a long time.

He only arrived at the Primeval War Realm today, and he actually already obtained 247 god of war points!

God of war points were not so easy to get, especially to a martial artist who looked very weak like Ye Yuan.

Redleaf said, “Sir, you might not know what god of war points means, right? 247 god of war points, to many people, that takes more than ten years to obtain.”

She felt that Ye Yuan spending god of war points like this was too wasteful.

Simply a prodigal son!

Not just her, the other martial artists present also thought so.

But Ye Yuan did not dare at all. Taking a look at Qin Hu, he said, “It’s fine. After spending them, there’s still someone who’ll come and give me more!”

In his heart, he already regarded Qin Hu as a cash withdrawal machine.

Qin Hu’s face turned black, the anger in his heart growing even more.

He already made up his mind to make this punk not dare to leave the city again!

When Redleaf saw that she could not persuade Ye Yuan, she could only say, “Alright. Since Sir insists on doing so, then the thousand over Empyrean spirit treasures, I’ll count it as five god of war points then. It’s a total of 245 god of war points, sir please pay the bill.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and followed Redleaf and arrived in front of a jade plate.

He put his palm on it, one gilded rune after another was pulled out of his body, entering the jade plate.

His god of war points was instantly only left with two pitiful ones.

And his ranking also dropped to the last place at once.

Seeing that Ye Yuan really paid so much god of war points, everyone could not help having shocked faces.

But even more was still feeling that this guy was too prodigal!

Other people’s ten years’ worth of god of war points, he spent it in one go!

Moreover, he bought so many Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures, what was the use?

Ye Yuan took the swords and was immediately satisfied.

With the sword formation, his strength would be stronger.

But he had his own plans. He planned on slowly exchanging these thousand over Empyrean spirit treasures into all Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures!

At that time, the power of his sword formation would be extremely terrifying!

This was actually very hard to realize outside.

After all, the outside world’s Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures were very rare.

Wanting to collect a thousand swords was very, very difficult.

Killing people and seizing treasures this sort of thing, Ye Yuan could not do it yet.

But in this Primeval War Realm, it was very easy to do so.

The Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures here were only composed of energy and laws. They could be supplied limitlessly.

As for god of war points, he did not care at all.

As long as his strength was strong enough, would he still be scared that there was no god of war points?

Wasn’t there going to be god of war points being delivered right away soon?
