Chapter 916: Divine Essence

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Long Zhan formed seals with both hands. A cloud of black gas emitted from within Long Zhan’s black shadow and directly entered inside Long Teng’s body.

After the black gas entered Long Teng’s body, his aura instantly strengthened considerably.

“This is my last trace of soul force. Saving it is pointless too, might as well give it to you. With this trace of soul force, you should be able to recover 30-40% of your strength. Plus the Skandha Divine Stone, before long, you should be able to recover to your peak condition,” Long Zhan said calmly.

Ye Yuan was slightly startled in his heart by the side. This wisp of remnant soul of Long Zhan’s was clearly feeble to the extreme already. It actually still had such power.

The might of Deity Realm powerhouses was indeed unimaginable!

“Thank you very much, Lord Long Zhan!” Long Teng bowed respectfully and said.

Long Zhan waved his hand and said, “My soul force being depleted, I’m only left with a trace of residual consciousness. Whether it’s going with the wind or returning to the original body, I’m looking forward to it very much too! Brat, don’t forget your promise!”

Finished talking, Long Zhan’s body became more and more illusionary, all the way until it finally disappeared.

And right at this time, a hard object the size of a short stick slowly flew out from the void and came to Ye Yuan’s hand.

When Long Teng saw this item, he was immediately extremely agitated: “Sacred Dragon Token! It’s really the Sacred Dragon Token! It’s been missing for over 100 thousand years already. I didn’t think that it was actually buried inside this Heavenly Slaughter Pit! Just what in the world happened back then?”

Ye Yuan said curiously, “This thing is really your dragon race’s treasure? No matter how I look at it, it’s also not much different from a fire rod?”

One could not blame Ye Yuan for being curious too. This thing that looked similar to a short staff in front of him was really too unremarkable.

Its whole body was pitch-black. There were even traces of wear and tear on the staff’s body. It did not have the slightest trace of essence energy undulation either. Compared to the overwhelming astoundment from when it made an appearance, the difference was too great.

This kind of lousy toy actually also dared to claim to be the dragon clan’s supreme treasure?

“Rubbish! The Sacred Dragon Token is a divine artifact! How can it be what you and I can appraise? A divine artifact coming into being, most likely ... turbulent days are really going to arrive!” Long Teng said with a solemn expression.

Divine Dao dwindling to zero, all divine artifacts were also submerged in history.

Now that a divine artifact had descended upon the world anew, Long Teng kept having a foreboding premonition.

“Speaking of divine artifacts, what is the Vast Heaven Stele? Also, the Soul Suppressing Pearl. Ugh ... I can’t understand what it’s all about!” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

Long Teng was speechless. Divine artifacts were likewise incomparably mysterious to him.

Forget about him, even Fang Tian did not figure out just what kind of the existence the Vast Heaven Stele was either.

“Forget it, forget it. Better go out first. Since it’s good stuff, keep it first then say. But ... how should we go out?” Ye Yuan said speechlessly.

Long Zhan that fellow disappeared just like that, leaving them trapped inside this cave.

Long Teng said, “This place should be an independent space. Want to get out of here, we must shatter the space here.”

“Mm, the Voice of the Dragon God was so powerful, and it had no way of shattering this space. In our current states, we can’t get out at all!” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

The Voice of the Dragon God’s sound wave attacks were very powerful. It even made tremors appear in the space. But it still did not shatter this space.

Although Ye Yuan’s strength advanced greatly, to make him shatter this space, he examined himself and knew that he did not have this ability either.

Long Teng mused for a moment and suddenly said, “According to the records in the clan, the Sacred Dragon Token has the ability to shatter the void! Wasn’t it hidden in the void previously too?”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up when he heard that, and he took the Sacred Dragon Token out once again.

He poured essence energy into the Sacred Dragon Token. But, there was no reaction at all.

“As expected, is it a fire rod?” Ye Yuan said speechlessly.

Long Teng shot him a glare and said crossly, “Divine artifacts are used by Deity Realm powerhouses. Want to activate the Sacred Dragon Token, you must use divine essence!”

“Divine essence? What’s that?” Ye Yuan said with a baffled look.

“Divine essence, simply put, it’s the essence energy that Deity Realm powerhouses use! After mystic qi enters the body and gets refined by Deity Realm powerhouses, it will convert into divine essence!” Long Teng explained.

Regarding Long Teng knowing these things, Ye Yuan was not surprised. The dragon race was one of the races with the longest legacy. They were bound to know some things that the outside world did not know.

But counting in this time, it was Ye Yuan’s second time hearing mystic qi this name. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“But ... where do I get divine essence? Without divine essence, isn’t this just a fire rod in my hands?” Ye Yuan said speechlessly.

“Divine essence, don’t you have it on you?” Long Teng suddenly looked at Ye Yuan with a smile that was not a smile.

Ye Yuan could not help being stunned when he heard that. Suddenly startling awake, he said, “You’re saying ... that strange essence energy in my essence energy sea?”

Long Teng said smilingly, “That’s right! These divine essences are incomparably precious. They were all obtained by Fang Tian at the Godsfall Mountain Range after exhausting his abilities back then. Each drop is incomparably precious. But didn’t expect that in the end, it benefited you, this brat.”

Ye Yuan was speechless. Turns out that he had been in possession of a treasure all along but was not aware of it! This strange essence energy was actually the divine essence used by Deity Realm powerhouse!

Except, martial artists under Deity Realm were completely unable to unleash the true power of divine essence.

To Ye Yuan, the function of divine essence was merely to instant-cast martial techniques.

If those Deity Realm powerhouses found out that he used divine essence like this, they would definitely be enraged until they climb out from a corpse pile.

But fortunately, Ye Yuan was also aware that this thing was very precious and had never really used it since obtaining it until now.

Ye Yuan shot Long Teng a cross glare and said, “You knew these long ago and actually didn’t tell me all along! Weren’t you afraid that I squander these divine essences away?”

Long Teng said with a smile, “You obtained it, it naturally belongs to you. How to use it is also your business.”

Ye Yuan was thoroughly defeated. He sucked in a deep breath and carefully mobilized several drops of divine essence, and poured it into the Sacred Dragon Token!

All of a sudden, the Sacred Dragon Token gave off a dazzling light. Ye Yuan had yet to activate it when a terrifying aura transmitted out like when it just appeared!

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Ye Yuan suddenly deployed it, abruptly giving a smash towards the void. This area of space actually fragmented apart inch by inch in a split second!

Boom!

The entire space suddenly collapsed. Ye Yuan’s and Long Teng’s figures shrunk and were sucked away by some kind of mysterious force.

Puff, puff, puff ...

Above the pavilion’s second floor, those several dozen lanterns instantly all extinguished.

Seeing this scene, Shao Kai suddenly stood up and said with a frown, “What happened? Ye Yuan he ... Something wouldn’t have happened, right?”

“Boss Ye is so formidable, it’s impossible for something to happen,” An Ren said.

With a whoosh, space lightly fluctuated. Ye Yuan’s figure appeared inside the pavilion-building once more.

Seeing Ye Yuan appear, An Ren said with a hearty laugh, “What did I say? In this world, a person able to make Boss Ye get into an accident has yet to be born!”

An Ren’s idolization towards Ye Yuan already reached a blind degree.

But Shao Kai’s expression changed and he said, “Ye Yuan, you ... you broke through again?”

Ye Yuan merely went to that space for several days time and actually broke through three minor realms in a row. He was already almost breaking through to Phaseless Realm!

This sort of improvement speed was truly too outrageous.
