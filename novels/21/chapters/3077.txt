Chapter 3076: Tearing Through the Boundary!

“Refine for me!”

Heavenless roared angrily. The Extreme Dao True Fire on Cloudneon and the others suddenly became stronger.

Everyone let out a muffled groan without prior agreement, their auras dropping considerably all at once.

It looked like they were not going to make it.

Yang Qing could not stand it a long time ago. If not for Cloudneon splitting off a portion of soul force to help him resist the Extreme Dao True Fire, he would have long died.

Seeing everyone falter, Heavenless laughed loudly. “Hahaha! Ye Yuan brat, this ancestor can’t do anything to you. But did you think I am helpless against your friends? This ancestor wants you to regret what you’ve done!”

Incarnating into chaos, Ancestor Heavenless had given up too much.

Outside of this world, he lost the ability to take the initiative to launch attacks.

Hence, he could not do anything to Ye Yuan at all. He could only vent his fury on Ye Yuan and the rest.

Yang Qing’s entire body was being burned by the blazing fire, and no longer looked human.

His entire body was chapped. It was as if a layer of skin was going to shed.

He gritted his teeth and said with a cold smile,?“Heh,?this old man is really a coward. Just you wait. After this seat achieves Great Beyond Realm, I’ll definitely thrash you until not even your mother can recognize you!”

Feng Qingxuan was at her last breath as she said, “Already someone who’s about to die. What are you still posturing for? But, knowing that Ye Yuan didn’t die, I can also close my eyes in death.”

......

Her eyes carried endless reluctance to part.

But the vitality of life on her body gradually started dissipating.

Right at this time, a thick divine essence wrapped her entire body up.

A surge of spatial power separated the Extreme Dao True Fire and forcibly pulled Feng Qingxuan out.

A chill struck. Feng Qingxuan’s entire person immediately felt much more awake.

It was a sea of chaos before her eyes.

A figure was standing not far away. With chaos divine essence flooding out of his body, who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

There was also Cloudneon, Yang Qing, and the rest who were rescued along with her.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s several thousand powerhouses were also brought out by Ye Yuan.

These several thousand people actually withstood the test of the blazing fire and survived.

In fact, Ye Yuan even brought Kong Tan, Yu Ran, and the rest of the younger generation Hegemon Realm powerhouses out.

Feng Qingxuan was wildly ecstatic!

“I … I actually didn’t die?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I promised you all to save everyone. I naturally won’t go back on my words.”

Yang Qing looked at Ye Yuan and said with a dazed look, “You … are already Emperor Sakra Heaven?”

Clearly, the key point that he was focusing on was different.

Ye Yuan breaking through to Emperor Sakra Heaven meant that he could wreck Yang Qing without employing the Dao sword.

Unbearable!

Why was it that in a blink of an eye, this guy was going to catch up to him again?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Even Kong Tan could cross a major realm. I wouldn’t be worse than him, right?”

“Pffft!”

Kong Tan spewed out a mouthful of old blood and nearly fainted in anger.

He really almost fainted.

Each and every one of them was incomparably weak right now. They were just hanging on with one final breath.

“Yeah! Big Brother Ye Yuan is really a peerless talent. He’s very different from us mortals. Previously, I had some misunderstanding with Big Brother Ye Yuan. It was all this younger sister’s fault. The life-saving grace this time, Yu Ran will bear it in mind.”

Yu Ran also turned pale at this time, but her attitude was already very different.

She did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually save her.

After all, it was not pleasant previously.

No matter what objective Ye Yuan had, he saved her life after all.

When Ye Yuan heard that, he just nodded his head slightly and did not express much.

He naturally saved Kong Tan and the rest for a purpose.

After going out this time, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven would definitely come under attack on all sides.

The blood race, soul race, and also the various races in all the heavens, they would not be friendly to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, especially since his own existence was a huge latent danger.

The Chaos Bloodstone, Hegemon Samsara, Ancestor Heavenless, these three supremacies all viewed him as a thorn in the side.

Therefore, allies were very important.

In the Labyrinth Divine Palace, it was mostly geniuses having disputes caused by personal feelings and not irreconcilable enmity.

Saving these people, even if they did not bear the kindness in mind, they would at least be embarrassed to kick them while they were down.

Only Kong Tan’s face turned bright red.

During the Labyrinth Divine Palace trip this time, although he broke through the fetters in one stroke and broke through to Hegemon Realm, his face was utterly lost.

Originally thought that he was the child of destiny, the ruler of all the heavens in the future.

Who knew that he actually became a jumping clown in the end!

Being poked fun at by Ye Yuan, he did not even dare to let out a fart.

If it were before, he would definitely rebut Ye Yuan.

But, feeling that incomparably thick chaos divine essence around, he kept his mouth shut sensibly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This chaos divine essence was too strong!

A genius like him, the fiendish skill that he cultivated was incomparably pure. His fiend essence was also incomparably thick.

But compared to Ye Yuan’s chaos divine essence, it was like glass meeting diamond.

Too fragile!

This chaos divine essence did not have the slightest discordance when it met with the Eternal River’s chaos.

It was also precisely because of this chaos divine essence that they could survive in the Eternal River.

As long as Ye Yuan rescinded the chaos divine essence, they would immediately be crushed into dregs by the Eternal River’s chaos!

Only at this moment did he deeply experience why the dignified Ancestor Heavenless would be so fearful of Ye Yuan.

“Many thanks for Brother Ye’s life-saving grace. My World’s End Pavilion owes you a favor!”

“Many thanks to Brother Ye for helping out. Our firespirit clan won’t forget your kindness!”

“Brother Ye, if you’re free in the future, come to our Flying Cloud Clan to be a guest. I’ll definitely satisfy Brother Ye!”

… . .

The geniuses who were rescued cupped their fists and saluted Ye Yuan one after another.

This kindness was not small!

However, those that Ye Yuan rescued were all juniors. Ye Yuan did not save a single one of those Peak Hegemons and Supreme Hegemons.

The divine essence consumed to save a Supreme Hegemon was too much.

No matter how strong Ye Yuan was, he was also merely an Emperor Sakra Heaven.

Now, one Cloudneon already consumed half of his energy.

Bringing another one would take his life.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Just a matter of lifting a hand. It’s not worth mentioning. But everyone shouldn’t be happy too early. With three great overlords coming into being, a sanguinary slaughter will surely be set off in the 33 Heavens. Nobody can stay detached from the matter. Therefore, from now on, everyone will be on the same boat. Everyone, take care of yourselves.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan brought everyone and headed to the nearest Eternal River branch stream.

Rumble?…

Behind, the Labyrinth Divine World gave off intense tremors.

It turned into a huge fireball in an instant!

When everyone saw it, their expressions could not help but change.

If they did not come out, they would probably all be refined now, right?

Thinking of how those Supreme Hegemons all fell in the Labyrinth Divine World, they rejoiced jubilantly.

“Ye Yuan brat, you ruined my grand plan! When this ancestor recovers my physical body, I’ll cross worlds and come! I’ll definitely exterminate your Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven until not even chickens and dogs are spared! Not even chickens or dogs will be spared!”

From behind came Ancestor Heavenless’ bellow.

This furious roar made even the Eternal River tremble.

Everyone’s faces turned pale, afraid that Ancestor Heavenless would chase after.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “No need to worry. He’s badly wounded now and needs to focus fully on refining the pill. He can’t chase after us at all.”

Suddenly, everyone saw that there were two more powerful auras not far away.

Only to see that Hegemon Samsara and Chaos Bloodstone were both cleaving through the waves and advancing, their imposing momentum shocking the heavens.

These two great supremacies’ main bodies arrived in person, but at this time, they were gasping heavily for air, seemingly very wretched.

But Ye Yuan’s chaos divine essence was like a large ship, carrying everyone forward along with the waves very comfortably.

Everyone exchanged glances, incredibly shocked in their hearts.
