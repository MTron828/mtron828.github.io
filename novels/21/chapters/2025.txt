Chapter 2029: As You Wish!

“Hahaha! I said it, right? This kind of combination, it’s totally impossible to refine the Seven Treasure Cloud Wind Pill!”

Seeing Empyrean Lumen failed, Zheng Qiyuan immediately had an ecstatic look.

It was just that there was no one who concurred with him at all.

The laughter gradually stopped, Zheng Qiyuan had an embarrassed look and could only laugh dryly twice and brush it off.

Except, his eyes when looking at Ye Yuan became even more baleful.

If not for this brat, he also would not be isolated by everyone.

Empyrean Lumen looked toward Ye Yuan and said, “Grandmaster Ye, when this Empyrean was refining just now, there was always a wood-attribute energy messing things up inside. The medicinal pill wasn’t able to condense at all. This method ... doesn’t work!”

The others all looked at Ye Yuan, revealing worried looks.

Once he failed, Ye Yuan would not be able to refine pills anymore in this life.

To an alchemist, this was simply worse than even killing him.

Especially that Ye Yuan’s attainments in alchemy were even so high.

However, Ye Yuan seemed to be completely fine. He just said coolly, “Since it doesn’t work, change to the second kind then.”

Empyrean Lumen nodded his head and started refining the pill according to the second proposal.

Ye Yuan watched with a calm expression, but his views on Empyrean Lumen gradually changed.

Looks like he misunderstood him.

Empyrean Lumen was clearly different from the rest. Calling him over was not in order to embarrass him, but purely wanting to see his strength.

About this point, Ye Yuan could see from his attitude in refining pills.

With Ye Yuan’s eyesight, even if Empyrean Lumen did any cheating actions, how could it escape his eyes?

However, the first proposal’s failure was clearly a problem of the spirit medicines’ combination and not Empyrean Lumen’s lack of effort.

Time slowly trickled by, fine beads of sweat also seeped out on Empyrean Lumen’s forehead.

His control of the medicinal cauldron fell shorter and shorter of his wishes.

Finally, there was another puff. It failed again!

All of the Empyreans’ faces changed slightly. This was the second failure. It also represented that Ye Yuan did not have a way out anymore.

“Heh, Brother Lumen, this time, it should be the fire-attribute power causing trouble, right? Next, it should be the thunder-attribute’s turn! This kind of low-level mistake, any alchemist wouldn’t make it. He actually pledged in all solemnity, saying that it will definitely succeed. Truly ignorant! In my view, he’s completely clueless about alchemy and is simply a pretty vase! That speech previously was likely taught to him by Brother Flutterfeather.”

Two failures made Zheng Qiyuan’s confidence soar. He was more and more certain that his thinking was correct.

As it should be, pure wind-attribute spirit medicines mixing in other attributes, how to integrate?

Empyrean Purplewing’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Grandmaster Ye, why not ... forget about it? As long as you open your mouth, this Empyrean and Brother Flutterfeather will speak up to bail you out. Absolutely no one will dare to do anything to you!”

Hearing this, Zheng Qiyuan’s face could not help changing.

“Brother Purplewing, are you oppressing people by force?” Zheng Qiyuan said in a solemn voice.

Empyrean Purplewing said coolly, “So what if yes?”

“You!” Zheng Qiyuan could not help choking.

In this land of Southern Border, Empyrean Purplewing was still alright, but Empyrean Flutterfeather’s status was too revered.

His Zheng Family was at the very most a third-rate holy land, being far worse than even Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital.

Now, seeing as Ye Yuan was about to lose, Empyrean Purplewing actually took Ye Yuan’s side. Could it be that he did not mind Ye Yuan snatching his grandmaster token?

Right at this time, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Brother Purplewing’s good intentions, this Ye appreciates it. However, this Ye am a man of my word and naturally won’t renege. Isn’t there still another formula? The victor hasn’t been decided!”

Hearing this, the group of Empyreans could not help secretly shaking their heads.

Still young in the end!

Ruining his brilliant future to show off momentary bravery, was there a need?

Moreover, there was still Empyrean Flutterfeather and Empyrean Purplewing, this level of big shots vouching for him.

But Zheng Qiyuan was overjoyed in his heart. But he had a sneer on his face as he said, “Brat, stop saying it with such dignified airs. Aren’t you relying on the fact that you have Brother Flutterfeather backing you up? So you’re emboldened by support?”

Ye Yuan gave him a nonchalant glance and said, “Don’t you just want to goad me into swearing a Heavenly Dao Oath? As you wish!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan swore a Heavenly Dao Oath in front of everybody.

Everyone stared dumbfoundedly with agape mouths!

This ... This little fellow was also too capricious, right?

At this point, Ye Yuan’s chance of winning was already extremely small, he actually swore a Heavenly Dao Oath.

With this, even if Empyrean Flutterfeather’s means were immensely formidable, there was also no way out.

“Now, it’s your turn,” Ye Yuan looked at Zheng Qiyuan and said coolly.

Zheng Qiyuan chuckled and said, “This wager, you will lose for sure. So what if this Empyrean swears a Heavenly Dao Oath?”

Finished talking, Zheng Qiyuan also swore a Heavenly Dao Oath.

Empyrean Purplewing shook his head with a pitying look.

This Ye Yuan was a member of the Myriad Treasure Tower no matter what, but being rendered unable to refine pills because of this kind of dispute caused by personal feelings, it was too regrettable.

“Brother Lumen, begin then!” Zheng Qiyuan had a smile all over his face as he looked at Empyrean Lumen and said.

Empyrean Lumen sighed slightly and started the third refinement.

Time slowly trickled by, it was very calm the whole time inside the medicinal cauldron, currently advancing according to routine.

After more than two hours, the medicinal cauldron suddenly started vibrating. The moment Zheng Qiyuan saw this, the excitement on his face could not be concealed anymore, saying with pleasant surprise, “Hahaha! Indeed it couldn’t hold out anymore! Like I said, how can thunder-attribute possibly integrate into a wind-attribute medicinal pill?”

The faces of the group of Empyrean changed, revealing looks of pity.

This time, Ye Yuan really suffered a crushing defeat! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Empyrean Purplewing let out a sigh, his gaze looking over toward Ye Yuan. But he discovered that Ye Yuan had a calm expression, and was actually not worried at all.

Could it be that this kid was really a layman, so he did not care that he could not refine pills?

But that shouldn’t be so!

In a blink, a hundred breaths passed, the medicinal cauldron was still quaking.

Another 15 minutes passed, the medicinal cauldron was still vibrating.

Two hours passed, the medicinal cauldron was still shaking.

But the medicinal pill still did not become a failed product!

Zheng Qiyuan was long already incomparably anxious. He was shouting madly in his heart, hoping that the medicinal pill would become invalid.

But, the pill refinement was still progressing systematically.

Suddenly, the medicinal cauldron shook. Zheng Qiyuan did not have time to rejoice yet when the vibration completely subsided.

Zheng Qiyuan’s face immediately fell.

“This ... How is this possible? It’s actually not a failure!”

“Could it be that this third proposal can really succeed?”

“Too magical! Currently this sort of situation, it looks like the thunder-attribute has already completely calmed down and should be integrated into the medicinal pill!”

...

A series of exclamations came from all around.

This situation was what all of them did not anticipate from start to end.

Thunder-attribute was the most violent and also the hardest to fuse. Who knew that after the medicinal cauldron vibrated for more than two hours, it actually fused successfully!

Right at this time, Empyrean Lumen’s face revealed a hint of excitement as he cried out, “Condense!”

The light faded away, everything returned to tranquility.

Everyone knew that the pill formed!

“This ... How is this possible? How ... How did he do it? How can thunder-attribute possibly be integrated into a wind-attribute medicinal pill?”

Zheng Qiyuan’s legs swayed. He actually could not quite stand firm.

Everything that happened before his eyes, he found it hard to believe.

Victory was clearly within grasp, but in the end, it was an overwhelming defeat!
