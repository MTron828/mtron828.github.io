Chapter 2583: Perhaps, He Found Me Pleasing to the Eye!

Dong!

The previous second, Lu Zhanyuan had a threatening manner.

The next second, he fell out of the sky and convulsed non-stop.

Spasmed … again!

Everyone did not even find out when he was poisoned.

When Lu Zhanyuan flew off the handle, everyone thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

But in a blink, he was spasming.

But in the next second, something even more surprising happened.

Ye Yuan brandished his long sword and stabbed toward Lu Zhanyuan like lightning!

He was going to kill!

Protector Mo and Han Qianyun’s faces changed greatly and they exclaimed in unison, “You dare!”

These two people did not hesitate at all, displaying their movement techniques and turning into two sharp arrows rushing over.

Two mighty Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratums, their speed could be imagined.

But sadly, they were fast, but Ye Yuan was faster than them!

Ye Yuan unleashed his spatial rule, his movement technique being swift to the extreme.

Although it could not compare to the two great protectors, he had an edge in that he was closer to Lu Zhanyuan!

Puchi!

This sword of Ye Yuan’s directly attacked a vital!

Lu Zhanyuan died!

The whole place was deathly silent.

On the day of the entrance assessment, a guy who had not entered the sect yet, he actually killed the inner sect’s number three!

This was too arrogant!

Too domineering!

Too … seeking death!

They said that it was a life-and-death battle, but everyone did not take it seriously at all.

Originally, it was a one-sided killing.

How could an ant be the opponent of a giant dragon that pranced in the sky?

Yet, this ant trampled the giant dragon to death.

Everyone was caught off-guard!

Two great Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum protectors were too late to save too!

“Spatial rule!” Protector Mo said in surprise.

Originally, he thought that with his speed, even if he was slightly far away from Lu Zhanyuan, he could save him too.

But who knew that Ye Yuan’s speed was unbelievably fast!

No one could have thought that apart from his Sword Dao being unparalleled, Ye Yuan’s spatial rule was also so formidable!

In the battle with Lu Zhanyuan, Ye Yuan only used Sword Dao rule from start to end.

It could be seen how powerful his Sword Dao was presently!

And spatial rule had an unexpected effect at the last moment.

Han Qianyun’s gaze was dark as he said in sullen anger, “You, very good! You haven’t entered the sect yet and already dared to kill the heavenly sect’s inner-sect disciple, what audacity!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “There are thousands of people bearing witness here that Li Zhanyuan set a life-and-death battle with me. What’s wrong with me killing him?”

Han Qianyun said with a cold smile, “Insolence! What status did Junior Apprentice Brother Lu have, who the hell do you think you are? A lower-inferior aptitude ant also dares to compare to Junior Apprentice Brother Lu in the same breath!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Yeah, I’m an ant. But he died at my, this ant’s, hands!”

Han Qianyun said in a great rage, “Rubbish! That’s you being treacherous and cunning, using poison to paralyze Junior Apprentice Brother Lu!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “Either way, you just refuse to see reason! Everyone saw that it was him who broke the rules first! I think that if it was me who was killed right now, you guys would probably say ‘serve him right’ very calmly, right?”

Han Qianyun smiled coldly and said, “That’s how it is! Today, even the Jade Emperor can’t save you too!”

Done talking, the Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum aura on his body suddenly released. Everyone’s faces changed.

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and looked at Protector Mo and said, “I won. So can I enter the sect now?”

Protector Mo frowned and said, “Are you a fool? Killing Junior Apprentice Brother Lu, you actually still want to enter Martial Secure Heavenly Sect? You probably don’t know that he’s Elder Shi Feiyu’s personal disciple! And Elder Shi Feiyu is a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse! What Junior Apprentice Brother Han said is right. Even if the Jade Emperor comes today, he can’t save you too!”

The ascenders all shook their heads and sighed, thinking to themselves that Ye Yuan was too impulsive.

Take a step back and it would be endless blue skies, enduring for a short while and it would be smooth waters.

The difference in their status from inner disparity was too great.

Even if Ye Yuan killed Lu Zhanyuan, there was only a road that led to death too.

Everyone knew that Ye Yuan was in the right.

But who would talk reason with him?

“Is that so? Then I wonder if this thing can save my life?” Ye Yuan smiled faintly and took out a token.

It was precisely the green-wing protector token!

“Green-wing token! You … How can you have a green-wing token!” Protector Mo exclaimed in surprise.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “This token was naturally given by Senior Luo.”

After finished speaking, Ye Yuan raised his hand slightly and threw the token to Protector Mo.

Protector Mo inspected the token and discovered that there was indeed Ye Yuan’s identity information on it.

There was also Luo Yunqing’s divine sense branding inside!

It was absolutely true!

“This … This is impossible! How can Senior Apprentice Brother Luo possibly hand the green-wing protector token to a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum! What capability do you have?” Protector Mo could not believe it.

Han Qianyun’s gaze turned sharp too, this reversal scene caught him by surprise.

A lower-inferior aptitude trash became the sect’s green-wing protector with a sway of his body. His status was even a level higher than his?

“What?! Green-wing protector!”

“Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, Luo Yunqing gave the green-wing token to him?”

“This guy wouldn’t have picked it up, right? This sort of thing is too fantastical!”

… …

Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s protectors and disciples were all shocked until they could not be more shocked.

Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s purple-wing protectors that were responsible for guiding new ascenders had the right to directly bestow the authority of a green-wing protector.

This kind of situation had occurred before in the past. It was not uncommon.

Some ascenders were very tenacious and were able to survive in the four great heavenly regions and even reach Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Only for such a person would a purple-wing protector grant the green-wing token, letting them directly become green-wing protectors!

But Ye Yuan was just a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

This sort of thing had never happened before in the entire sect’s history.

Ye Yuan was merely a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum. Furthermore, he was even a lower-inferior aptitude Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

What right did he have?

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “How do I know? Perhaps, Senior Luo found me pleasing to the eye.”

Believe my ass! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Found you pleasing to the eye and gave the green-wing token to you?

One had to know, only by reaching Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum did one have the qualifications to become a protector.

As for a green-wing protector, not only did one’s strength have to reach upper Limitless Sublime Heaven, they even had to have made great contributions to the sect.

This fellow who had just ascended had yet to make the smallest contribution. His cultivation realm was even just Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Luo Yunqing actually gave such an important token to him!

Puzzled!

Shock!

Depressed!

In Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, one needed to endure at least several thousand years to get a green-wing token.

But Ye Yuan actually got it before even entering the sect!

Protector Mo looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Why didn’t you take it out earlier if you have the green-wing token! Is it very interesting to pretend to be a pig to eat a tiger like this?”

He wished to kick a foot onto Ye Yuan’s face right now!

Clearly Ye Yuan had the green-wing token, but he wanted to turn the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect upside down before taking it out!

This fellow did it on purpose, right?!

Right now, how should he clean up this mess?

Protector Mo could not help feeling his head hurt.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You look at their reaction!”

Protector Mo was taken aback and could not help turning his head to look at the rest.

Sure enough, the expression on each person’s face was fascinating to the extreme.

“I originally planned on entering the sect first. I’ll wait for Senior Luo to come back before talking. But this Lu Zhanyuan provoked me time and again. Just now, he even wanted to kill me in a flagrant manner. Could it be that he shouldn’t be killed?” Ye Yuan said indifferently.
