Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

The large blood-colored bell emitted a series of bell chimes, reverberating throughout the heavens.

Every time it rang, Yuan Zheng would spurt a mouthful of blood wildly.

As for Wu Shang, he was unable to get close at all.

Ye Yuan’s strength could not be cracked at all.

This scene shocked everyone deeply.

“Hahaha … Blood race’s trash, weren’t you guys very arrogant just now? What’s the matter now? All gone mute? What bullshit Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons, in front of us Azure and Ye combo, they can’t withstand a single blow at all! The invincible in the same rank that Your Grandpa Yang was talking

about earlier is our Azure and Ye combo! When the two of us join hands, we’re unmatched among Saint Sovereign Heavens!”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s grand display of invincible might, Yang Qing suddenly became excited again.

This kind of opportunity to posture and slap faces, he would not let it go.

Hence, this Azure and Ye combo appeared bafflingly.

Everyone could not help rolling their eyes.

But no one could refute it.

Right now, Yuan Zheng two people were currently being abused madly by Ye Yuan. They did not even have the chance to fight back.

The hope of the blood race’s powerhouses that had just ignited, it was directly extinguished by Ye Yuan’s immense strength.

Bloodspirit saw that the situation was not good, and his figure moved, about to charge toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan had been guarding against the blood race this side long ago. Before Bloodspirit could move out, Ye Yuan’s aura suddenly skyrocketed, smashing a punch towards the two.

Boom!

The void trembled. Yuan Zheng two people were smashed into pieces by Ye Yuan with one punch before they had time to scream.

By the time Bloodspirit rushed over, Ye Yuan already brought the two people’s blood essence as well as the large blood-colored bell and made his get-away.

Looking from far away figures of Ye Yuan and the others, Bloodspirit had immense hatred.

But he did not dare to chase after.

The deaths of the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons, this was absolutely a huge matter in the blood race.

Yuan Zheng three people dying here was an extremely troublesome thing to him as well.

It was not that Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons never died before, but they were often killed by the Heaven One Alliance’s powerhouses.

There were really not many who died at the hands of someone in the same rank.

Of course, there were those who were defeated. But, directly being obliterated by someone in the same rank, that was a joke.

It was not that there were none stronger than the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons in the same rank. But wanting to kill them was far too difficult.

But today, this joke actually happened before their eyes.

In the blood race camp, people were shocked to the extreme.

“Damn it! How could a guy from a remote continent be so powerful?” Bloodspirit said hatefully.

‘When Han Guang saw this scene, he started dumbfoundedly and mumbled, “This brat, in just a few days of not seeing him, how could he have become so strong?”

He suddenly felt a chill in his heart. He kept crying out for revenge, but if he really went out, he probably would not have been able to return.

As for ordinary bloodkins, they were even more shocked to the core.

Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons, those were all god-like existences in their eyes.

Now, they were actually slaughtered by someone!

“That’s the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons, they … they died just like this?”

“That guy is only just middle Saint Sovereign Heaven. He hasn’t even reached upper Saint Sovereign Heaven! After he reaches grand completion Saint Sovereign heaven, that will truly be invincible in the same rank!”

“How could such a monster appear in the Heaven One Alliance? This guy will definitely be our blood race’s formidable enemy in the future!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The blood race had always had a sense of superiority in front of the Heaven One Alliance.

But now, their sense of superiority was ruthlessly trampled underfoot by Ye Yuan.

‘When the advantage of revival no longer existed, the blood race also did not appear as powerful anymore.

At least, Ye Yuan could disregard the blood race’s advantage of revival.

“Hahaha, you bunch of weak chickens, come out and fight again if you have the ability! What bloodline is powerful? What number one race across all the heavens? You guys can really brag! Got beaten by your Grandpa Yang until you don’t even dare to release a fart anymore!”

“Don’t you all have 100 sons? Only three came out now. Call those in front out too! My Azure and Ye combo will beat the shit out of them all the same! Why is nobody talking anymore? Your Grandpa Yang is an expert that’s lonely and desolate as snow!”

“Also, that guy just now called whatever Bloodspirit, right? Just you wait! After your Grandpa Yang breaks through to True Sovereign Heaven, I’ll beat you into blood dregs!”

After Bloodspirit returned, Yang Qing rode Xiao Qing out again.

The blood race’s powerhouses were all angered until they had livid expressions. But, they really could not send anyone out anymore.

No matter how Yang Qing taunted them, the blood race’s side had no reaction at all.

“Let him shout. We’ll just shut the camp! Whoever dares to yell about going out to fight again will immediately be sentenced to death!” Bloodspirit gave a death order with a cold face.

Hence, no one dared to call anymore.

In reality, even if Bloodspirit did not give the order, nobody would dare to call about going out to fight anymore as well.

Got to be kidding; even the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons died. Send who else out to fight?

But it was really aggravating!

Yang Qing’s mouth was really loathsome until it was unbeatable.

His strength was not considered top-notch, but his taunt skill was really invincible under the heavens.

He clearly suffered serious injuries, but looking at his smug appearance, how did he look like an injured person?

The blood race army’s powerhouses were all beyond furious, but there was nothing that they could do.

How aggrieving!

In the void, the Heaven One Alliance’s Emperor Realm powerhouses were all stunned.

These few little fellows actually beat the blood race until they did not dare to go out?

Although the blood race was apprehensive of them sneak attacking, Ye Yuan they all relied on real ability to make the blood race huddle up at home too.

Including Dan Fei, they were all extremely shocked.

Although they knew that Ye Yuan was a divergent cultivator and had powerful strength, being powerful to this extent still exceeded their expectations.

No wonder this guy dared to come and provoke them. He was really fully prepared.

“There’s really no one coming out? Don’t blame your Grandpa Yang for not giving you a chance. If there’s really no one coming out, your Grandpa Yang is leaving,” Yang Qing said with a look of regret after scolding for half a day.

This half a day, he did not repeat a single sentence, scolding extremely satisfyingly.

Scolding people like this and others could not even rebut, how enjoyable!

“Alright, go back. They don’t dare to come out anymore,” Ye Yuan also said with a look of regret.

Seeing Ye Yuan few people’s departing back views, the blood race powerhouses could finally heave a sigh of relief.

“These few gods of plague finally left!”

“Yeah, I was scolded by this guy until I was even doubting life!”

“say, you guys, are we … really very weak?”

At the Northern View City’s camp, Wei Liang slammed his fist heavily and said excitedly, “Really exhilarating! This seat has experienced hundreds of major and minor battles, but there hasn’t been once that feels as good as this time!”

The action of blocking the door this time was really incomparably liberating.

Even they, these Emperor Realm powerhouses, were incomparably excited too.

The battle with the blood race was too depressing.

You clearly killed the opponent. In the end, the other party resurrected immediately.

The next battle, they would similarly deal with you in their strongest state.

But once you got inflicted with blood corruption poison, it was basically waiting for death.

Ye Yuan directly killed three Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons in this fight and killed close to half the chiliarchs!

This was killing absolutely. The other party did not even have the chance to revive!

Furthermore, the blood race army was blocked in the camp and scolded, and they did not even dare to release a fart.

Utterly satisfying!

This kind of victory was really satisfying!

Although the scale of this battle was not large, it was incomparably liberating!

An Emperor Realm powerhouse said with a loud laugh, “Hahahal It’s really great! Ye Yuan’s crushing victory feels really great! Also, Yang Qing that punk is loathsome, but he’s very tastefully loathsome!”

“It’s still my first time seeing the blood race like cowards, not daring to even release a fart! Relieving! Too relieving!”

“You didn’t see. It’s silent in the blood race camp! Each and every one of those soldiers, they were flushed red but couldn’t vent it! Hahaha, really too great!”

Each of the Emperor Realm powerhouses felt amazing.

They thought that Ye Yuan was in incredible danger in this fight.

How could they know that a few little fellows actually brought such a relieving battle.

Furthermore, this fight had huge harvests!

Eliminating 300 Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons and close to half the chiliarchs, this held even greater significance than annihilating an army of 50 thousand.
