Chapter 1273: Supporting the Sky With One Hand!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Puu, puu, puu!”

In midair, the human race and demon race powerhouses virtually spewed blood at the same time. The barrier that a group of powerhouses used every last ounce of strength to create, crumbled with a loud bang!

Over a dozen figures fell down from the air powerlessly. The fiend palm continued to land neither too fast nor too slowly.

“Senior Fang Tian!”

Teng Yun yelled out, mustering the not much remaining essence energy, bundling up Fang Tian, who was on the brink of death.

“This ... What’s going on here? How ... How could he be so strong?”

“Human and demon, two race’s dozen over peak powerhouses, actually couldn’t even last past two breaths of time? My ... My eyesight isn’t failing, right?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“This fiendgod seems to be somewhat different from those previously! He ... He’s so strong!”

“Where’s the Heaven Surmounting Divine King? Why hasn’t the Heaven Surmounting Divine King showed up until now? Could it be that ... he ...”

...

Only at this time did the human and demon, two race’s martial artists, know how powerful Kanuo’s strength was!

That apocalyptic palm was not shouted out to scare people!

Under a palm, Fang Tian plus over ten human and demon, two race’s pinnacle powerhouses, were all defeated. What trump cards did they still have to resist?

At this time, someone finally thought of Ye Yuan and discovered that he never appeared before from start to end.

This human race’s leader actually fled on the eve of battle?

For a moment, resentful scoldings spread among the crowd.

Of course, even more were ... feeling fearful!

The true fiend dharma idol’s palm was still slowly landed. The earth was trembling.

The more it was this sort of time, the more they hoped for there to be the appearance of a savior, and were also disdainful towards Ye Yuan’s action of fleeing in the face of danger.

More and more people scolded him, getting increasingly nastier.

All of the spearheads were all pointed at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan left in secret. The people who knew were not many.

Even the two race’s upper echelons, those who knew were also a meager lot.

Seeing this scene, Teng Yun seriously could not resist and shouted angrily, “ALL SHUT UP FOR ME!”

Teng Yun’s voice was akin to a great bell, directly suppressing all of the rebuking voices.

“You all these ignorant fools! Ye Yuan he entered deep into the god-forbidden region to search for an opportunity to become a deity in order to deal with Kanuo, facing certain death! You all, these useless fellows, each and every one of you only know how to blame heaven and other people. Think carefully, have you worked hard before yourselves?”

Everyone all quietened down, their faces revealing abashed expressions.

They suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan really had not appeared in a long time.

No one thought that he actually entered the god-forbidden region.

That was a place that even Deity Realm powerhouses did not dare to step foot into!

Looks like the Heaven Surmounting Divine King they all had long known that this fiendgod’s strength was unstoppable. That was why he would use this kind of extreme method to search for a last hint of turning point for the human race.

But could he succeed?

It had been over 100 thousand years. How many peerlessly talented people were unable to open that magical door too?

Could the Heaven Surmounting Divine King succeed?

“Hahaha ... Tremble! Despair! Everything that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove created, this deity is going to utterly destroy it today! Hahaha ...”

In the air, Kanuo’s high and mighty laughter came over.

In this day and age without Deity Realm, he was an invincible existence!

“Quick! O-Open up the 28 Constellation ... Spirit Guarding ... Grand Array!”

At this time, that feeble voice of Fang Tian came over.

Teng Yun was uncertain what it meant, but he still reacted at the first moment!

“Quick! The Four Symbols Family Clans activate the spirit guarding grand arrays at the same time!” Teng Yun roared loudly.

Even though the four clans were not together, they had an array formation that transmitted news amongst themselves.

Teng Yun’s order spread across the four clans right away.

The grand arrays activated. The spirits of the four symbols surged to the sky, working in concert with each other from a distance!

Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, the spirits of the four symbols seemed to have obtained impel, converging above dragon clan’s sky in an instant!

The spirits of the four symbols each gave a long roar, forming a terrifying resonance with each other.

An enormous barrier condensed and formed at the dragon clan’s sky.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s gaze that despaired revealed hope once more.

Everyone did not expect that the four clans activating the spirit guarding grand arrays at the same time, could actually have such an effect.

Boom!

The giant black palm landed right onto the barrier, shaking until the earth quaked.

“Blocked it! Didn’t think that the Four Symbols Family Clans still had such a formidable grand array!” A series of thrilled voices came from in the crowd.

Seeing that the barrier was actually effective, Teng Yun was greatly surprised too.

He had never heard before that the Four Symbols Family Clans’ spirit guarding grand arrays actually still had such an effect.

“Senior, it worked!” Teng Yun said with joy.

Fang Tian shook his head powerlessly and said, “I-It’s useless.”

The current Fang Tian had already reached the brink of death. He was just hanging in there with one last breath and might die at any time.

But Fang Tian’s words made Teng Yun’s heart sink.

But Kanuo looked at this scene coldly and said with a cold sneer, “Four symbols resonance? Heh heh, if it’s the four clans’ progenitors here, this four symbols resonance would naturally be powerful! But it’s a shame, oh,

it’s a shame!”

A black bead was faintly discernible on Kanuo’s forehead. His fiendish energy skyrocketed several times all of a sudden!

That true fiend dharma idol’s power similarly skyrocketed several times!

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Under the demonic palm, that barrier only lasted for several breaths of time, and cracks actually started to appear.

That ear-piercing sound made the faces of the two race’s martial artists turn deathly pale in an instant.

Still could not work!

The cracks on the barrier became more and more. Finally, unable to withstand the power of the palm, it thoroughly collapsed!

The spirits of the four symbols could not withstand this kind of power either, directly turning into nothingness.

Rumble ...

The gigantic palm came closer and closer. The pressure got increasingly closer.

Split ...

The giant palm had yet to completely land, and a group of martial artists whose strength was slightly weaker already could not withstand this pressure, vomiting fresh blood in large mouthfuls.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Landing a fraction more, quite a few martial artists’ bodies exploded straight away, being convulsed into meat paste.

The faces of Teng Yun and the rest were incomparably ugly. This Kanuo was too strong, strong until it made people despair!

He finally knew now, why Ye Yuan wanted to enter deep into the god-forbidden region, to seek out that virtually impossible hope.

Without Deity Realm, they had no chance of victory at all!

“Puhwark!”

The giant palm was already hanging over their heads. Teng Yun finally could not resist spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood.

That attack previously already exhausted most of his strength. Currently, he was already a spent force, and he still had to branch out a portion of essence energy to go protect Fang Tian.

He was already almost at his limits!

“Could it be that it ends here?” Teng Yun said with unwillingness.

“Hahaha ... Immortal Grove Heavenly Fiendgod is nothing more than this! You suppressed this deity for a million years, today, this deity shall get it all back, both principal and interest! Brahma True Fiend, kill for me!”

In the midst of Kanuo’s wild laugh, the giant palm landed with a loud bang.

Looks of despair surfaced on everyone’s faces. This front and back hundred breaths of time, they had seemingly fallen to the 18 levels of hell.

In the crowd, tragic cries rose one after another.

This was the cry of despair!

Boom!

Right at this time, the giant palm suddenly stopped!

Air billows rolled out, directly sweeping out 100 thousand miles away.

The air billows swept up a series of fierce gales, blowing until everyone’s eyes could not open.

When they came back to their senses and focused their eyes to look over, only to see a tiny and frail body, actually use one hand, and supported the Brahma True Fiend’s palm!
