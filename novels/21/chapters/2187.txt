Chapter 2191: Escape!

The black fur subsided; his divine essence quietly changed.

Inside the chaos world, Ye Yuan recovered his original looks.

When Li-er saw this magical scene, her beautiful body shuddered, with her eyes full of disbelief.

Ever since being captured, Yue Mengli had been living in despair and fear every day.

Fear toward the future, fear toward the unknown. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

She knew that she could not see Ye Yuan anymore!

But, in the midst of this despair, Ye Yuan actually broke through the layers of blockades and shackles, and then he arrived in front of her.

Her shock could be imagined!

Surprise, worry, longing ... countless emotions interweaved in Yue Mengli’s heart.

“Big Brother Yuan, I ... I’m not dreaming, right!” Yue Mengli’s eyes were blurred by tears as if she was in a dream.

Ye Yuan walked forward and lightly hugged Li-er as he said, “Of course it isn’t a dream. Big Brother Yuan came to fetch you home.”

“I even thought ... I even thought that I won’t ever see you anymore! Sniff, sniff ...”

Ten years of despair, being snatched from the jaws of death, the agitation in Yue Mengli’s heart currently simply could not be controlled.

Her state of mind was like grabbing onto a piece of driftwood before drowning.

That sort of agitation was simply hard to put into words.

How could Ye Yuan not know Yue Mengli’s feelings?

He did not speak either, just lightly hugging her like this as he said, “Cry. It will feel a little better after crying out.”

No idea how long passed either, the crying gradually stopped. Only then did Yue Mengli slowly lift her head. She looked at Ye Yuan as she said, “Big Brother Yuan, s-sorry, I ...”

Ye Yuan helped her to wipe away the tears and said with a light smile, “Silly girl, is there still a need to say this sort of words between you and me? There’s no need to say anything. I understand.”

These 2000 years of scrambling, who did Yue Mengli do it for?

Of course it was for him, Ye Yuan!

As for this kind of outcome, it was naturally not what Li-er hoped for either. How could Ye Yuan blame it on her?

One sentence, 2000 years of grievances, all melted away.

After feeling sad, Yue Mengli felt even more shocked.

With her current Second Firmament Empyrean strength, she actually could not see through Ye Yuan’s cultivation!

“Big Brother Yuan, is ... is this your world? It seems ... to be different!”

Only at this time did Yue Mengli notice it. She saw the surrounding scenery and discovered that it was greatly different from ordinary small worlds.

She was rather surprised. Just what kind of boundary had Ye Yuan reached at the moment?

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right, my world is called chaos world. It’s indeed different from ordinary small worlds. I’ll tell you about this again in the future. We have to think of a way to get out of here first.”

Yue Mengli shook her head and said, “Big Brother Yuan, I know that you’re very impressive, but it’s no use! This room’s restrictions were laid down by the Divine Race’s Nineorigin. His strength is unfathomable.”

Ye Yuan asked curiously, “Just what kind of race is this Divine Race? Why would you become their Divine Daughter?”

Yue Mengli said, “They said that the Divine Race is a race that’s blessed by heaven. Hence, they call themselves as the Divine Race. The Divine Race has a sparse population, but each one is unbelievably powerful. As for me ... I don’t know either, but it might be related to my spirit and body fusing into one.”

When Ye Yuan heard that, his brows could not help knitting tightly together.

A race blessed by heaven! Such high-sounding sentiments!

Regardless of whether it was the human race or the demon race, they both did not dare to utter such big talk.

“Then why would this Divine Race get mixed up with the abyss monsters?” Ye Yuan said.

“Abyss monsters take pride in serving the Divine Race, and they obey the Divine Race absolutely! As for the relationship between them, I don’t know.” Yue Mengli clearly did not know much either.

But Ye Yuan was incomparably shocked in his heart, abyss monsters were extremely strong, far surpassing same rank humans.

But such a proud race actually bowed their heads in submission toward the Divine Race.

It could be seen that this Divine Race was definitely very powerful!

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “The restrictions here are extremely powerful. Even space is sealed. But as long as we leave this house, I have confidence in bringing you out!”

Li-er revealed a difficult look as she said, “But they won’t let me go out of this house at all.”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Relax, leave it to me!”

... ...

Exiting the stone house and switching on the restrictions, Manya let out a long sigh in relief.

“Huhu, Mosius, this brat that you brought is pretty good! If he can coax Divine Daughter, you will be considered to have rendered a major accomplishment. At that time, this emperor will transfer you to the Divine Capital!” Manya looked at Mosius with a look of praise.

These few days, Yue Mengli’s performance gave him a terrible headache.

Today, he could finally heave a sigh in relief.

He was naturally very satisfied with this kid who performed pretty well.

Mosius said sincerely, “Sharing Lord Manya’s burdens is Mosius’ honor!”

Manya nodded slightly and said coolly, “These few days, Lord Nineorigin has been handling the matter of the two world’s passageway. I reckon that it’s almost time. Once the two worlds’ passageway is secured, we’ll be able to send Divine Daughter into the abyss space. Oh, right, what were you looking for me for?”

Mosius said, “Subordinate came to report to Lord Manya that these few days, there was another batch of human powerhouses who entered the passageway again. This batch of human powerhouses was very strong, but they were still beaten off by us. But this time, this subordinate only had a pyrrhic victory, the casualties being extremely heavy.”

Manya’s two eyes narrowed and he said with a smile, “You this fellow, turns out that you’re complaining to this emperor about being hard up. Relax. Later, I’ll transfer some manpower from the other outer-region commanders there to you!”

Mosius was overjoyed and said, “Many thanks, Lord Manya!”

Manya chuckled and said, “Want to thank, thank this kid that you brought! If he placates the Divine Daughter, what does this minor matter count for?”

The abyss monster race was quite unruly. Making them deal with women, it was simply even more torturous than going down to the 18th level of hell to Manya.

Ye Yuan’s appearance today completely liberated him. So how could he not be happy?

This way, he also did not have his former airs when talking to Mosius, and he was very cordial.

No idea how long had passed either, movements came from inside.

“Lord Manya, Divine Daughter has already agreed to stay! She says that she has something to tell Lord Manya. Lord Manya, please come in.” Inside the stone house, there was a restriction that transmitted one’s voice outside. Ye Yuan’s voice came from inside.

The moment Manya heard, he could not help being overjoyed, hurriedly opening up the restrictions.

The moment the stone door opened, Manya was about to enter the stone house.

But right at this time, he suddenly discovered something amiss.

There was no abyss monster in the house, but an additional human!

Manya immediately felt that it was not good and was about to erupt.

However, it was already too late!

“Immobilize!”

Ye Yuan bellowed, the vital energy in his body surging crazily.

With this Time Freeze, he virtually used all of his strength!

Instantaneously, the power of Heavenly Dao restrained Manya.

However, Manya was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. He was far from what the current Ye Yuan could immobilize.

Dao marks swam on his body. He was about to burst through the fetters of Time Freeze in a moment!

However, Ye Yuan only needed this brief moment!

When he opened his mouth, spatial law was already set in motion, bringing Li-er and teleporting outside of the stone house.

“Spatial node technique!”

Ye Yuan brought Li-er and Mosius, executing the spatial node technique, returning to Mosius’ territory in an instant!
