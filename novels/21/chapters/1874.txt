Chapter 1878: Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace

“What a powerful attack! It’s simply impeccable!”

“Why did this Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean suddenly become so strong?”

“This is the 81st rune of the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, Innumerable Ghost Shadows! He actually cultivated to such a boundary already!”

“No, wait, he definitely didn’t have this strength previously. What in the world did Ye Yuan do to him?”

...

Ye Yuan’s words were still ringing in their ears, he said that he could help Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean chase these two mighty fiend race Empyreans away.

Just now, they were the same as the two great Empyreans, taking it to be a joke.

They did not expect that in a blink of an eye, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean really brought down these two mighty fiend Empyreans with one blade.

Ye Yuan looked at that rapidly shrinking space, letting out a slight sigh of relief in his heart.

This blade arrived quickly and also left quickly, not like the great battle previously. The ripping of space was continuous and the destructive power was also completely different.

Previously, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s fight with the two great Empyreans, he did not have the chance to approach Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean at all. He could only enter the cave to draw their attention.

Ye Yuan looked at the two great fiend Empyreans and said coolly, “Now, is it still a joke or not?”

Qiao Yuan’s expression was very ugly. An exalted Empyrean powerhouse was actually made a mockery off by a Celestial Deity Realm.

However, what on earth did this boy do, to actually make Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s strength increase greatly?

Ghost Dao Hundred Runes’ 81st rune, that was a Ghost Dao that even Empyrean powerhouses found hard to comprehend, and Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean actually used it.

“Kid, don’t you be impudent! The victor hasn’t been decided yet! Eymond, attack together!”

Qiao Yuan gave a fierce cry, fiendish energy immediately surging on his body.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp and he said coldly, “You guys really want to go to the point of no return for a Seven-Colored Aegirine?”

Qiao Yuan sneered and said, “So what?”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “I don’t care, but Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s real treasures should be inside that palace. But if you guys want to really fight it out with Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean, the Immortal Grove World will likely fall apart to pieces. At that time, that palace will drift into spatial turbulent flows and you guys can forget about finding it again!”

The moment Qiao Yuan heard, the imposing momentum on his body immediately diminished significantly.

What Ye Yuan said was right, they already sensed that the Immortal Grove World could not withstand Empyrean-level battles at all.

Once they fought it out to the bitter end, the entire world would collapse and that palace would definitely crashed into a spatial turbulent flow.

Wanting to enter the palace at that time would be virtually impossible.

However, Qiao Yuan still did not give up and said to Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean, “Wild Blade, this kid said to give you the Seven-Colored Aegirine, but he didn’t give it to you. Could it be that you’re going to stomach this insult?”

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean gave Ye Yuan a glance and said coolly, “I hit it off very well with this little brother. That Seven-Colored Aegirine, I’ll give it to this little brother!”

“WHAT?!”

Qiao Yuan’s eyeballs went wide, disbelief written all over his face.

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean fought with them for the greater part of a day for the Seven-Colored Aegirine. Now, he actually gave the Seven-Colored Aegirine to Ye Yuan?

The others similarly had astonished looks, feeling that this scene in front of them was seriously too subverting.

One had to know, they had a bloody battle with those Ghost Dao powerhouses for a long time for the Seven-Colored Aegirine.

Now, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean actually made the decision and gave the Seven-Colored Aegirine to Ye Yuan.

This ... This made people too peeved!

Of course, what they had even more was envy.

That was a Seven-Colored Aegirine, giving a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse to use was simply a wanton waste of God’s good gifts!

This thing was something that could let Empyrean powerhouses advance.

“Just nice, I was called out by them from the Senro Ghost Realm and can still stay for a few days. I’ll follow along with Little Friend Ye Yuan then.” Just as everyone was unbelievably surprised, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean threw out another heavyweight bombshell.

Qiao Yuan’s face turned black and nearly had an impulse to curse and swear.

This guy could be off doing anything, but he just had to be Ye Yuan’s bodyguard!

He was originally still planning on finishing Ye Yuan off along the way. Now, nothing could be done.

No one would have thought that a great struggle for the Seven-Colored Aegirine would actually conclude like this.

The group of True God Realms fought fiercely for more than ten days, in the end, even Empyrean powerhouses took action. But nobody obtained the Seven-Colored Aegirine in the end and instead let Ye Yuan, this Celestial Deity Realm, get it.

Helpless, the party could only rest their hopes on that palace.

Three great Empyreans blazing the trail, there naturally would not be much danger on the way.

Very soon, the group of people arrived on that tallest mountain peak.

Only after arriving before it did everyone feel the majesty and magnificence of this palace.

But Ye Yuan’s gaze landed on a young man by his side.

That person seemed to have noticed Ye Yuan too and flashed a friendly smile at Ye Yuan, saying, “Brother Ye, we meet again! You’re really impressive, to actually be able to snatch the Seven-Colored Aegirine from the hands of a group of Empyrean powerhouses!”

This person was none other than precisely Tang Yan!

Ye Yuan did not expect that this Tang Yan who concealed his abilities actually walked all the way here!

One had to know, previously in the Asura Ghost Domain, the Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses who challenged the Heaven Killing Sword Formation had pretty much all fallen.

Especially those itinerant cultivators without backers, the casualties were even terrifyingly huge.

Ye Yuan did not think that Tang Yan actually pulled through.

“Huhu, Brother Tang indeed keeps your ability hidden deeply! This Ye admires!” Ye Yuan also clasped his hands and said with a smile.

Ye Yuan touched his own heart and felt that he was rather accurate at reading people. But this Tang Yan, he could not see through.

Tang Yan smiled and said, “What ability do I have to hide? It was merely hiding from place to place and barely managing to walk until here, that’s all. Even so, this Tang also narrowly escaped death several times.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Tang is modest.”

“Heh, finally arrived at Old Fart Immortal Grove’s lair! Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace! Heh heh, that thing should be hidden in here, right?” Qiao Yuan chuckled and was about to step into the great hall.

He was brave stemming from great ability and was also not afraid of whatever contingency Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove set up.

“Hold on!” Ji Xun suddenly shouted.

Qiao Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said, “Mn? What’s wrong, Old Fogey Devilfeather?”

Empyrean Devilfeather could not even take care of a True God Realm right now, how could Qiao Yuan take him seriously?

Jiu Shang said in a solemn voice, “Lord Jiu Shang sent you two pigs here, isn’t he afraid of spoiling the important affair?”

Qiao Yuan snorted coldly when he heard that and said, “Devilfeather, stop putting on stinky airs in front of Your Father! If you’re formidable, why would you be suppressed by Old Fart Immortal Grove for five million years?”

Ji Xun’s face turned black and was practically about to rampage.

But he was currently a tiger who had ended up in an open plain, so how could he be Qiao Yuan’s match?

It was only to see him snort coldly. He said, “Okay then! If you want to seek death, go in then!”

Qiao Yuan’s brows furrowed and he calmed down instead.

Suddenly, his gaze swept and landed on a Third Firmament True God.

“You, go in first!” Qiao Yuan said in a cold voice.

That Third Firmament True God’s face changed but hesitated.

Qiao Yuan said in a cold voice, “If you’re not going, die!”

As he said, powerful fiend essence burst forth, crushing that Third Firmament True God until he could not catch his breath.

Empyrean powerhouses were too strong!

Bang!

Qiao Yuan did not give him time to hesitate at all, suddenly slamming a fist out, immediately blasting him into dregs.

Then, his gaze landed on another True God Realm and said, “You, go in!”

The moment that person heard, his face was immediately ashen.

But at this time, it was not allowed for him to refuse at all.

Carrying flustered emotions, he walked towards the main entrance of the palace.

Buzz, buzz ...

Bang!

A horrifying energy undulation landed. That True God powerhouse did not even let out a scream. He directly turned to ashes.
