Chapter 2537: One Point Heavenly Alchemist!

The Dao fire gradually ceased. There was dead silence in the hall.

In Ye Yuan’s palm, a ball of almost transparent paste of Dragonbone Grass stunned everyone.

The more it was crystal clear, the less impurities there were.

When these two balls of Dragonbone Grass were put together, there already did not need anyone to judge them.

It was also precisely because of this that these people were deeply shocked.

“A-Are my eyes failing me? He … Is he really one point affinity?”

“Yeah! With one point affinity, how did he do it? Did he break the barrier of heavenly alchemist?”

“This ball of Dragonbone Grass is pure to the extreme. I’m afraid that even if Master Lin takes action, he might not be able to win too!”

… …

Tang Yu was utterly dumbfounded by the side.

This move was seriously too stunning!

One point was a kind of humiliation among heavenly alchemists.

But Ye Yuan let it shine with dazzling light!

Ye Yuan really did it!

He rewrote history!

What on earth had he done in the past 18 years?

Second Prince originally came to witness this wager with a playful mentality.

But now, he was shocked by Ye Yuan until he could not speak.

His perception would not be wrong. Ye Yuan’s affinity absolutely did not exceed three points!

But he really did it!

Only now did he understand that Ye Yuan did not live in his world at all.

He could really ignore Gu Mao’s provocation!

A person with one point affinity just refined the Dragonbone Grass.

This was a miracle!

“H-Huhu,?Master Ye’s means really broadened this prince’s horizons! I didn’t expect that Master Ye could actually extract the Dragonbone Grass with one point affinity. This is truly unprecedented and unrepeatable!” Second Prince laughed dryly, resolving the awkwardness from before.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Like this, there’s no need to judge anymore?”

Second Prince waved his hand repeatedly and said, “No need to judge, no need to judge! This wager, it’s naturally Master Ye who won! It’s just that, this prince is very curious. Master Ye’s affinity is clearly extremely poor. So how can you extract this Dragonbone Grass? Could it be that Master Ye has some secret method?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The moment he said this, the bystanders immediately perked their ears up.

This secret method was definitely an earth-shaking secret method!

Who would have thought that Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “No secret method! Reading a book a hundred times, the meaning naturally becomes clear. In these 18 years, I extracted hundreds of thousands of Dragonbone Grass and just trained it into instinct, that’s it.”

“H-Hundreds of thousands of Dragonbone Grass! My god, is he crazy?”

“In 18 years, he only did this one thing? This amount, could it be that he never rested?”

“Lunatic! Really a mad man! However, even if he extracted the Dragonbone Grass, it’s also impossible to become a heavenly alchemist! The Dragonbone Grass is just the most basic homework!”

“This guy is a monomaniac! In order to win the bet, he pushed himself into a lunatic! But, it’s useless! Some heavenly medicines are a thousand times, ten thousand times more complicated than the Dragonbone Grass! He can’t possibly practice each type like this!”

… …

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, everyone could not help drawing a cold breath.

The Dragonbone Grass that Ye Yuan extracted in these 18 years was probably comparable to the sum of the Dragonbone Grass that they refined in 1800 years.

This kind of crazed and dreariness, they felt despair just thinking about it.

Alchemy was a very interesting cultivation, but also a kind of very boring cultivation.

Life needed regulating, people who refined pills needed it even more.

But Ye Yuan was completely a lunatic.

When Gu Mao heard Ye Yuan’s words, he also sneered and said, “So what if you won this match??Heh,?other heavenly medicines are much more complicated than the Dragonbone Grass, and refining a heavenly pill is countless times more complicated! You’ll need to spend several thousand, even several tens of thousands of years to learn one type of heavenly pill! This is still the simplest heavenly pill!?Heh heh,?trash will always be trash!”

Ye Yuan looked at Gu Mao and said coolly, “I think that you are thinking too much! Some things, as long as you find the trick, you can naturally draw parallels from inference. That’s right. My affinity is indeed very poor, but I’ve already learned the trick now! Just like a mortal blind person, one’s sense of hearing tends to be very keen. As long as they keep on training, they will be able to master the ability to determine positions by listening to the wind. Extracting other heavenly medicines, I’m indeed much worse than you all innately. But, it doesn’t mean that I can’t become a heavenly alchemist!”

Finished talking, he held his palm out, and there was a stalk of Purple Compact Incense in his hand.

It was only to see flame dance in his hand again. The Purple Compact Incense gradually melted, finally similarly turning into a paste.

The paste of Purple Compact IncensePurple Compact Incense showed a purple-blackish color. It was clearly not too pure.

But, compared to when Ye Yuan first refined the Dragonbone Grass, it was God knows how many times better!

Seeing this scene, Gu Mao’s eyes went wide.

The Purple Compact Incense’s extraction was much harder compared to the Dragonbone Grass. Logically speaking, if Ye Yuan wanted to extract it, he would need to spend another 20 years or even 30 years at least.

But, this Purple Compact Incense that Ye Yuan extracted now could already compare to the average apprentice.

At most three years, he would be able to reach the level of the Dragonbone Grass!

Calculating this way, wouldn’t Ye Yuan really have hopes of becoming a heavenly alchemist?

It was a little slow, but so what?

As long as one could refine a heavenly pill, that would do!

One point affinity heavenly alchemist?

Everyone exchanged glances, instantly falling into deep shock.

If this incident were to spread, it would absolutely be a major event that would cause a great sensation in the entire alchemy world!

Heavenly alchemist, even 29 points affinity would not cut it.

This was an iron law! No one had ever been able to break it!

But now, a one point heavenly alchemist actually appeared!

How could this not be shocking?

Second Prince also said in shock, “W-What kind of path can let a one point affinity become a heavenly alchemist?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Instinct! When pill refinement becomes your instinct, even amidst chaos, you can still discern the direction! These 18 years, I was training this instinct! Actually, I could already reach Gu Mao’s standard a few years ago. But my instinct wasn’t strong enough yet! Even now, I’m still not very satisfied. Maybe one day in the future, I’ll be able to rely on instinct to differentiate heavenly medicines very easily!”

Everyone opened their mouths wide with shock on their faces.

When pill refinement becomes an instinct!

What was instinct?

That was people’s natural ability!

Such as when you saw something sharp, you would instinctively avoid it.

Such as when you saw beautiful things, you would instinctively want to possess them.

Such as when you lose friends and relatives, you would instinctively be overwhelmed to the extent that you wished you were dead.

But they had never heard of someone who could treat pill refinement as an instinct!

This was using instinct to go and sense the impurities and essence in a heavenly medicine.

Each one must be differentiated clearly. How terrifying an instinct did this require?!

Just thinking about it was scary!

Ye Yuan did not have affinity, so he used instinct to be his eyes, to ‘see’ the chaos in the heavenly medicine.

He did it!

The Dragonbone Grass already explained everything!

Suddenly, the heavenly alchemists present all felt ashamed of their unworthiness!

In the face of Ye Yuan’s persistence, they were not fit to be called heavenly alchemists at all!

Because they could not do it instinctively!
