Chapter 2130: Meeting With a Mishap in the Stronghold

Lush mountains and blue rivers, birds chirped, flowers fragrant, and monkeys crying.

A lonely boat flowed down leisurely along the current in the midst of the mountains and water.

Several people stood on the boat, admiring the beautiful scenery on both shores, laughing with praises unceasingly.

“Young Master, this place is really so beautiful! If we can live here together with Elder Sister Li-er they all, how great would that be!”

Seeing this otherworldly paradise-like scenic view, Lu-er’s heart gave rise to a yearning for it.

As for Loneswan and the rest, they had yearning looks on their faces.

East Suppression Pseudo World was extremely mysterious, barely anyone in the entire Heavenspan World knew.

He did not expect that he could actually enter here one day.

It was all thanks to their master!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Beauty is beautiful, but it secretly conceals killing intent! How can there truly be some otherworldly paradise in this world?”

Lu-er opened her mouth wide and said in disbelief, “Secretly conceals killing intent? Why don’t I feel it at all?”

It was not just Lu-er. Even Loneswan had a blank look, clearly not discovering any dangers.

Ye Yuan said, “With the Dragon Clan’s power, how can the restrictions laid down be easily seen through? These two shores are brimming with vigor and vitality, too beautiful to be absorbed all at once, and may be rated as perfect. However, things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme. The more it’s a place like this, the more dangerous it is instead. The surroundings of this brook are full of powerful restrictions everywhere. I’m afraid that even if a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse comes, once the person triggers the restrictions, they would turn to ashes too.”

When everyone heard, their hairs could not help standing on end.

The environment here was too beautiful. It was very hard for them to link it together with danger.

By the side, a hint of surprise flashed across in Long Zhi’s eyes, and he said with a marvel: “Well-deserving of being Second Sage, seeing through the actual situation with one glance. Looks like Second Sage has already touched the source of Great Dao.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just a wild guess. Rather, this Ye is somewhat surprised that Senior Long Zhi actually agreed to let me enter the Dragon Clan.”

Although Long Zhi had some qualms, he still agreed in the end.

Resting for a few days in Westspirit Region, he brought Ye Yuan and company and set off for the East Suppression Pseudo World.

Long Zhi smiled and said, “Honestly speaking, Long Zhi is also very curious about Second Sage.”

Long Xiaochun immediately jumped up and said, “Yeah, yeah, you’re really an enigmatic man, full of mysteries from head to toe!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “You’re also an enigmatic girl!”

Giggling and laughing along the way, suddenly, everyone seemed to have passed through a thin film.

Everyone realized that they had probably already entered East Suppression Pseudo World.

The scene did not change, it was still green hills and blue waters, birds tweeting and the flowers fragrant.

But the dragon race bloodline in Ye Yuan’s body suddenly started boiling with excitement, as if the blood in his body was going to evaporate.

Feeling the pure dragon race pressure on Ye Yuan’s body, even Long Zhi’s expression changed slightly too.

This bit of pressure was naturally unable to make him visibly moved. But the purity of Ye Yuan’s bloodline, even he was also unbelievably surprised.

Long Zhi could not help being secretly alarmed. Just what was this guy’s background? Why would he have such a pure bloodline?

He did not know that Ye Yuan’s bloodline was incomparably pure to begin with.

Now that he transcended six levels of Nirvanic Tribulation and achieved the perfect sixth transformation golden body, his bloodline evolved to an inconceivable level.

Of course, his future path was even more bumpy and thorny too.

The perfect seventh transformation would be a life-and-death ordeal to Ye Yuan!

“It’s like having returned home! Could it be that my root is actually here?” Ye Yuan raised his head to the sky, feeling endless vicissitudes of emotion in his heart.

Walking all the way from the Immortal Grove World, Ye Yuan wandered all over the world.

Now, he actually had a feeling of returning home. It was really inconceivable.

“Xiaochun, Xiaohai, you guys settle Second Sage down first. I’ll go to the clan to report completion on the mission first,” Long Zhi said.

Long Xiaochun waved her hand and said, “Quickly go! Quickly go! Having me here will do!”

Long Zhi nodded his head, his figure moving, disappearing from everyone’s line of sight.

No idea how long they traveled either, the few people finally got ashore.

The party was very swift on their feet, leaping into the air and flying over toward inland.

Several days later, an enormous stronghold appeared in front of everyone.

After landing and entering the stronghold, Ye Yuan was also very curious and started looking around.

Inside the stronghold, there were men and women, elderly and young, their expressions peculiar.

The appearance of Ye Yuan and his group immediately drew many people’s attention.

But Ye Yuan discovered that each and every one of these dragons revealed a strange look. Inside those eyes exuded a thick look of fear, and actually avoided them like the plague. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“East Suppression Pseudo World has a total of nine great heaven strongholds, 81 earth strongholds, and countless black strongholds and yellow strongholds. The Raindragon Stronghold that we’re at is one of the 81 earth strongholds! Uncle Zhi is our Raindragon Stronghold’s protector elder ...”

Long Xiaochun was clearly very enthusiastic, introducing to Ye Yuan the East Suppression Pseudo World’s local customs and practices.

According to what Long Xiaochun said, the nine great heaven strongholds ruled East Suppression Pseudo World. Only dragons with the noblest bloodline had the qualifications to enter the heaven strongholds.

That place was the Dragon Clan’s core, countless supreme powerhouses.

But even the 81 earth strongholds were also equivalent to the outside world’s Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas.

Each earth stronghold had a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse garrisoning!

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan and the rest could not help feeling overcome with emotion.

The dragon race was well-deserving of being an ancient variant species. The might of their strength was simply unimaginable.

“Xiaochun, why do I feel that your clansmen seem to be very scared of us?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

Long Xiaochun chuckled and said, “How so? No need to care about them. Come, I’ll bring you guys to the residence.”

By the side, Long Xiaohai wanted to speak but swallowed the words back. At the end, he still did not speak up.

It was just that how could this scene hide from Ye Yuan’s eyes?

But if they did not say, it was also not convenient for Ye Yuan to inquire more. He could only gloss it over.

Long Xiaochun brought Ye Yuan to a stone house that was not small and stayed there.

“Brother Ye, you stay here first. Tomorrow, I’ll bring you to stroll around Raindragon Stronghold.” Long Xiaohai said with clasped hands.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble you!”

After Long Xiaohai left, Ye Yuan directly went into closed-seclusion to cultivate and did not speak for the entire night.

Early morning the next day, Ye Yuan went out of the stone house and was planning on strolling around nearby, but then he saw a large group of people crowding around ahead, raising a big hue and cry.

Moving close to take a look, he was immediately greatly enraged.

Three dragon race young men were actually surrounding Lu-er and Yang Fei-er, their expressions very obscene.

“Hahaha, human girls, this young master hasn’t tasted before yet! Girl, follow me, Long Hao. I’ll guarantee that you’ll be merry as an immortal everyday in the future!” A man in the middle with shaggy eyebrows and a very obscene expression actually reached his hand out to touch Yang Fei-er’s chin[1].

At this time, Yang Fei-er and Lu-er were already being restrained and did not have the strength to resist at all.

These three dragon race men were very powerful. Looking at their auras, they were already peak rank six.

Although Yang Fei-er was also a Ninth Firmament True God, how could she be a match for members of the dragon race at the same rank?

As for Lu-er, although she was extraordinarily talented, her strength was much weaker after all.

At this time, Yang Fei-er and Lu-er’s clothing were somewhat in a mess. Clearly, they had experienced a fight just now.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, flames of fury surged to his head.

“Stop!” Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, divided the crowd, and walked out.

The moment Long Hao turned his head and looked, he could not help sneering coldly as he said, “Yo, isn’t this the human brat who came together with that misfortune star? Why? These two beauties are your women? Starting from today, they belong to me!”
