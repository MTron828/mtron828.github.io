Chapter 2149: Grandaunt

Feeling the explosive power coming from his body, Ye Yuan was extremely satisfied with this physical body.

The tribulation of rank seven nirvanic tribulation was the nightmare of body cultivators.

Without an indomitable strong will, there was completely no way to transcend.

But to Ye Yuan, this was precisely his forte.

This process was incomparably painful. But pulling through, sweetness would come after the bitterness.

With a perfect seventh transformation golden body, one’s vital energy was exuberant like the noonday sun shining high above.

Ye Yuan felt that even if he did not utilize divine essence now, he could blow up an Empyrean level abyss monster with one punch.

“Heh heh, breaking through this time is really a metamorphosis! Essence, energy, and spirit three paths are akin to a nirvanic rebirth, causing my strength to skyrocket!” Ye Yuan said with an emotional sigh.

“Essence, energy, and spirit fusing, it’s truly incomparably terrifying! It’s just too bad that apart from you, no one in this Heavenspan World can do it at all!” Dustless also marveled with admiration.

Ye Yuan nodded with a slight smile. Suddenly, he made a slight sound of surprise. A dragon-shaped mark appeared between Ye Yuan’s brows.

“Looks like ... that senior was indeed unfathomable, to actually leave behind this mark on my body unknowingly! However ... this mark seems to be like a seed, containing tremendous power inside, waiting for me to develop.”

Feeling this imprint, Ye Yuan immediately connected it to Bai Chen.

To be able to plant a mark on his body unknowingly, apart from that Bai Chen, who else could there be?”

Currently, he still could not feel danger from this imprint, so he simply allowed it to take its natural course.

“Ye Yuan!”

“Lord Ye!”

... ...

Suddenly, a series of surprised yells came from afar. It was precisely Long Xiaochun they all who rushed over.

“I knew that you’d be fine!”

Long Xiaochun had a look of pleasant surprise. Suddenly, her face changed and she said in surprise, “You ... You broke through?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Huhu, fusing essence, energy, and spirit three paths, I also didn’t expect that the nirvanic tribulation would suddenly arrive. Originally, the tarnished black devil crystals were not enough to use. Who knew that those Empyrean Realm abyss monsters actually delivered themselves to the doorstep, resolving my imminent problem.”

When everyone heard, they could not help being speechless.

To be able to treat Empyrean level abyss monsters as preys, Lord Ye was also one of a kind.

A hint of cunningness suddenly flashed across in Long Xiaochun’s eyes and she suddenly threw a punch out.

A horrifying power made the space give off cracking sounds.

Ye Yuan chuckled and also threw a punch out.

Bang!

Long Xiaochun’s figure flew out backward and retreated several hundred feet in a row before barely managing to stabilize her figure.

While Ye Yuan did not budge an inch.

Seeing this scene, Big Brother Xun and the rest all had shocked faces.

They all knew that Long Xiaochun was an abnormally strong girl. Her pair of fists could practically have a showdown with First Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters.

But this freakishly strong girl actually lost to Ye Yuan in one punch!

Furthermore, looking at the appearance, Ye Yuan did not use full strength at all.

Ye Yuan just broke through to Empyrean Realm and did not even have time to consolidate his realm yet, and his strength was actually so strong already! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“How impressive! Indeed well-deserving of being the perfect seventh transformation golden body! If you gave it your all, it’s likely that your strength already doesn’t lose to Second Firmament Empyreans!” Long Xiaochun marveled.

Ye Yuan said casually, “If it’s dealing with a Second Firmament Empyrean, it shouldn’t be anything difficult.”

This was the powerful aspect of the perfect seventh transformation!

Breaking through to rank seven, it would be an explosive increase in strength.

Coupled with a powerful cultivation method and martial technique, jumping realms to battle in Empyrean Realm would also be a cinch!

“Freak!” Long Xiaochun could not help rolling her eyes.

She was absolutely synonymous with genius in the Dragon Clan.

But in front of Ye Yuan, she really could not find any sense of superiority at all.

This guy was too freakish!

Ye Yuan sized Long Xiaochun up, a peculiar look on his face.

Long Xiaochun was looked at by Ye Yuan until all her hair stood on end and she said, “W-What are you doing, looking at me like that.”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh, “I broke through to rank seven, my Atavism Dragon Soul has already completely awakened.”

Long Xiaochun said doubtfully, “So what?”

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “It turns out that the Immortal Grove World’s dragon ancestor was actually your mother’s big brother ...”

The moment this came out, Long Xiaochun’s expression also became odd.

Suddenly, Long Xiaochun finally could not contain it anymore and burst out laughing.

“Hehehe ... Come, come, come! Call me grandaunt! Hahahaha ... I’m dying of laughter, hahahaha

...”

Long Xiaochun laughed herself into fits, convulsing heavily, virtually almost not able to breathe.

By the side, Long Xun and the rest were also holding in their laughter at the beginning.

In the end, they finally could not hold it in and collectively burst into laughter.

They never would have thought that there was actually still this layer of relationship between Ye Yuan and Long Xiaochun.

Ye Yuan was speechless. He had treated Long Xiaochun as a little sister all along.

But after he awakened the Atavism Dragon Soul, some of the Immortal Grove World’s dragon ancestor’s memories also appeared in his head.

It turned out that the dragon ancestor and Raindragon Stronghold’s dragon lord were actually brother and sister.

This also explained why he felt very close when he saw Long Xiaochun.

Several million years also, the dragon ancestor felt self-assured for being a genius and wanted to follow his progenitor’s footsteps, and he barged into the Dragon Eye Cave alone.

Who could have thought that he fell into a hopeless situation inside the Dragon Eye Cave that was plagued with dangers in the end?

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove accidentally stumbled into the Dragon Eye Cave from a spatial rift and saved the dragon ancestor, Long Qin, as well as the four great divine beasts’ progenitors.

These few mighty divine beasts followed Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove in order to repay the life-saving grace.

And the four great progenitors also propagated in the Immortal Grove World.

Who could have thought that later, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was killed, the four great progenitors’ whereabouts also became unknown.

But in the dragon ancestor’s memories, he had a younger sister called Long Xiyue, who was precisely the current Raindragon Stronghold’s Dragon Lord.

This way, Ye Yuan was actually many times junior relative to Long Xiaochun.

This label ‘grandaunt’ was ought to be called out.

But to make Ye Yuan call her this, it was too difficult.

With this, the seniority was off.

“Ye Yuan, quickly call, quickly call! Otherwise, Grandaunt will be unhappy. Call and there will be a reward! Hehehe ...” Long Xiaochun ridiculed.

Ye Yuan could not help rolling his eyes. With this, he would never be able to lift his head in front of Long Xiaochun.

Of course, making him call Long Xiaochun grandaunt, that was impossible.

“Alright, stop messing around! It’s getting late, we should go out!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Sure enough, one sentence immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

“Your Excellency, is this real? You can really bring us out?” Long Xun said in pleasant surprise.

The others also had looks of anticipation. This kind of place was simply akin to hell to them.

Ye Yuan secretly let out a sigh of relief and said coolly, “Of course! My spatial law is already comprehended to the sixth firmament. What does looking for a mere spatial rift count for? Moreover, there are also coordinates of a spatial rift in my inheritance memory.”

Before breaking through to the Chaos Realm, it would really still be somewhat troublesome for Ye Yuan to look for a spatial rift.

But during the explosive, Ye Yuan’s consciousness entered a very profound and mysterious realm and knew this third layer seal like the back of his hand.

The spatial rift coordinates that he currently grasped were no less than five.

Long Xiaochun was also distracted by Ye Yuan and hurriedly said, “Then still waiting for what? Hurry up and go! This damn place, I don’t wish to stay for a second longer!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly and said, “Follow me then.”
