Chapter 1504 Redeeming Favor

Pfft!

A cloud of green smoke emerged from the medicinal cauldron. The medicinal pill inside already became a scrap pill.

Ye Yuan sighed slightly and said, “Failed again! Could it be that this medicinal pill to restore the divine sea really can’t be refined?”

In order to refine the medicinal pill to help Xie Jingyi recover his divine sea, this half a year, Ye Yuan had already failed no idea how many times.

He attempted no less than one thousand over ways of combining spirit medicine, but he never succeeded even once.

These one thousand over kinds of combination methods were just the results that he derived in the end.

There were at least several tens of thousands of pill formulas derived in his mind.

It was just that in the end, a vast majority of them was rejected by him.

In order to derive this brand new pill formula, Ye Yuan could be said to have cudgeled his brain.

However, the result made him very disappointed.

“You’ve already done your best. Even though Alchemy Gods are Deity Realm powerhouses, they don’t dictate all life on earth too. There are times when human strength would not do. You don’t have to be discouraged either. A medicinal pill to repair the divine sea had never been heard of in the Heavenspan World. It’s easier said than done for you to want to develop it yourself.” Dustless’ figure appeared and consoled him.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m not discouraged. In fact, through this half a year of deducing experiments, I feel that I’m already very close to it! It’s just that, this layer of windowpane paper can’t be poked through from start to end, making me somewhat depressed. I have a feeling that as long as I poke through this layer of windowpane paper, my alchemy strength will advance a step further!”

Dustless looked at Ye Yuan in surprise, as if he did not know the latter.

He knew that Ye Yuan’s current alchemy level was already far stronger than the Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove in the same period.

Advancing a step further, he even did not quite dare to imagine it.

Could it be that this guy did not have a limit?

“Water will flow when a channel is formed. Being too deliberate can be counterproductive instead. This period of time, why don’t you relax a little first? Perhaps, you’ll straighten out your ideas one day,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “It’s also time to leave seclusion. I’m afraid some people are already tired of waiting.”

Ye Yuan exited seclusion, Long Zhan was long already waiting for him.

“Master, there’s a Blood Yama Hall’s guest waiting for you in the box room,” Long Zhan said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly and said, “You withdraw then, I’ll handle it.”

Walking two steps, Ye Yuan suddenly turned back and said, “You go and find Fan Yu to fetch a batch of spirit medicines over, just say that I said it. This is the formula. You’ve already been stuck at half-step Origin Deity for very long, right?”

Hearing this, Long Zhan involuntarily trembled all over. A surge of wild elation welled up in his heart and he hurriedly knelt down and said, “This lowly one has already been stuck at this step for 15 thousand years!”

Ye Yuan gave an ‘mmn’ and said, “Your talent is pretty good. Originally, entering the Heavenspan World, you could break through to Origin Deity. It’s just a shame that it was delayed. Looking on the account of your diligence and earnestness these few years, I’ll give you a ride!”

Long Zhan’s entire body trembled agitatedly as he said, “Long Zhan thanks Master very much!”

Ye Yuan voiced his assent and turned around and left.

Long Zhan’s pair of fists were gripped tightly, his face appearing somewhat red because of excitement.

These 100 thousand years, it was his first time being so agitated.

His state of mind that was originally akin to low-level of water finally produced a trace of ripple.

For 100 thousand years, he bemoaned how tragic his own fate was all the time.

His entire person seemingly fell into darkness, all the way until Ye Yuan’s appearance.

Long Zhan had never thought that this bumpkin who came out of the Immortal Grove World like him actually had such outstanding talent.

The entire Capone Capital City was stirred until waves ran high by his new master.

All forces were revolving around his master.

“Sigh! One misstep and every step became wrong! Got to double down my efforts from now onwards. I hope that I can get Master’s forgiveness in the future!” Long Zhan said with a sigh.

...

When Ye Yuan saw Yi Han, he could not help being somewhat surprised.

“Source Night pays respect to Hall Master. I didn’t think that Hall Master actually arrived in person,” Ye Yuan said with clasped hands.

A hint of surprise flashed across Yi Han’s gaze and she said with a smile, “You actually guessed my identity long ago! Looks like I still underestimated you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Didn’t think of it at that time. But after coming back from the Hundred Knows Hall, I thought carefully, and I realised that Hall Master had many suspicious points on you.”

Yi Han smiled sweetly and said, “No wonder Ka Xin would die at your hands. His level of skill is far too lacking compared to you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Hall Master is too kind.”

Yi Han giggled and said, “I even find that I didn’t praise enough! It looks like I indeed didn’t find the wrong person.”

Ye Yuan gave Yi Han a glance with a profound expression and said, “Hall Master coming personally, could it be to have me return the favor?”

Yi Han gave Ye Yuan a glance reproachfully and said with devilish flirtatiousness: “You slippery little fellow, not even willing to help Elder Sister with a small favor. Must I use favor to pay it off??”

Ye Yuan broke out in goosebumps all over and said with a smile, “This favor of Hall Master isn’t small! If my conjectures are right, there are already quite a few capital cities’ Fiend Medicine Halls that have gathered at Capone Capital City, right? The moment I start a sermon on Dao, the entire Eminent Orchid Imperial City’s Blood Yama Hall’s Fiend Medicine Halls’ strength will collectively rise a major level. How big this favor is, Hall Master is adept at this and don’t need me to calculate, right?”

Yi Han had a bitter look on her face, looking delicate and pitiful. Truly a nuisance character.

She heaved a sigh and said, “The news of the Blood Yama Hall is all shared. The other capital cities’ hall masters learning about your existence, they naturally won’t let me off. So many people came to find me, I can’t very well push all of them away, right? Don’t look at how Big Sister is in charge of the Blood Yama Hall, Big Sister also has times where things are difficult!”

That expression of Yi Han made people unable to resist loving her upon seeing her, making people’s bones go soft.

Except, if not because he could not beat her, Ye Yuan wished that he could give a tight slap!

This woman really calculated well, wanting the horse to run and also wanting the horse to not eat grass.

You think that by putting on an act, this little lord will promise you?

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly and said indifferently, “Hall Master, kill me then. Don’t talk about this matter!”

Yi Han’s expression instantly turned from sunny to overcast. A moment ago, she was still thinking of seducing Ye Yuan. The next instant, her face was already cold as frost. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A piercing cold killing intent arrived with a howl, but Ye Yuan was firm as a rock and not cowed in the slightest.

He knew that Yi Han absolutely would not kill him.

She personally came forward and took his favor, she definitely had something to request of him.

Sure enough, Yi Han’s killing intent quietly subsided and she said gloomily, “You punk, really impervious to everything! Speak then, what conditions do you have!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “Two! The first, this is considered half a favor, realized right now! The second, a month later, you’ll gather everyone to the Blood Battle Stage, I’ll preach on Dao for half a month continuously. How much they can comprehend will depend on themselves. I don’t have time to waste on this daily. Uh ... There’s still one more, that is that whatever Blackjade Capital City’s Fiend Medicine Hall’s people, this lord won’t wait upon them! Have them scram!”

Ye Yuan knew that wanting to use this to cash in all of the favor, Yi Han absolutely would not agree.

Therefore, he had no choice but to go for second best, consume half a favor first before talking.

Yi Han sighed slightly and said, “You brat, really not willing to suffer any bit of loss at all! Fine then, Big Sister will promise you.”

Finished talking, Yi Han took out the blood essence contract and slightly kneaded a seal. The blood essence in the contract began to combust.
