Chapter 2609: Three Laws Versus Five Laws!

The youth had red lips and white teeth and was extraordinarily handsome, like the boy-next-door.

But when Ye Yuan saw him, he felt pressured.

This kind of pressure was like facing Changsun Xingyu back then.

This person was very strong!

“Three laws transforming, indeed formidable! You all didn’t lose in vain! I didn’t expect that a genius such as yourself actually appeared in the outside world!” The youth looked at Ye Yuan, his eyes revealing a look of appreciation.

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “You’re not bad either.”

Beside the youth, a burly man immediately scolded, “Insolence! How are you speaking to Holy Lord, His Excellency?”

The youth waved his hand slightly, motioning for the burly man to back down, and said coolly, “His strength isn’t beneath Li Cheng’s! From today onwards, he’s the Holy Mountain’s Fourth Holy Lord! You all are not to be impolite!”

The burly man was greatly alarmed and repeatedly said yes. Bowing toward Ye Yuan, he said, “I pay respects to Holy Lord!”

The others also had shocked expressions on their faces. No one expected that this newcomer actually became a holy lord!

But an unwillingness to submit was clearly written on their faces. It was just that they did not dare to say anymore.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to pay attention to the burly man and said to the youth,?“Oh??There are actually two powerhouses such as yourself on this mountain?”

The youth nodded and said, “I’m called Han Yi, the Chief Holy Lord. The Second Holy Lord is called Ji Zhe, Third Holy Lord is called Li Cheng. From now on, you’ll be the Holy Mountain’s Fourth Holy Lord!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “What bullshit holy lord, not interested! I came here to find people to spar with. Your strength is not bad. So why don’t we have a fight?”

He had no interest in living a life of being a local despot.

What Ye Yuan wanted was to consolidate his foundation, then break through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

He did not have time to keep wasting in the Land of Exile.

However, all the powerhouses in the mountain looked at Ye Yuan with surprise.

This guy actually refused to be a holy lord!

Furthermore, he even dared to be so unbridled in front of Chief Holy Lord, really courting death.

The youth took it in stride and said smilingly, “You’re not my match!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Haven’t fought before, how would you know?”

The youth shook his head and said with a smile, “You’re an extremely rare three rules transformation. But I am five laws transformation! Do you feel that you have a chance of winning?”

Although Ye Yuan had never heard of three laws transformation, it was very easy to guess that the meaning of three laws meant three kinds of power of rules.

He was a little surprised. This youth actually comprehended five kinds of rules at the same time?

No wonder he could live a life of being a local despot and proclaim himself as holy lord, he indeed had some capability.

However, Ye Yuan did not think that his own three laws were lousier than the other party!

Sword, space, formation, three paths, they seemed as different night and day, to be as different as chalk and cheese, but Ye Yuan forcibly combined them together and it transformed and took shape.

When these three paths reached the extreme, they could all form their own universes.

They were absolutely top Great Daos!

If you understood more rules, it would definitely be stronger?

Ye Yuan never thought this way!

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “If I was sure of success, I would have killed you with one sword and be done with it. Why would I go so far as to talk nonsense with you here? It’s because there’s no certainty of winning that we have to fight! Otherwise, what’s even the point of me coming to the Land of Exile?”

The youth looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly and said with a nod, “You seem to be different from the rest! Forget it. I’ll have a battle with you today and let you know the disparity between three laws and five laws!”

Finished saying, a lotus platform already appeared in the youth’s palm.

There were five lotus seeds on the lotus platform!

Clearly, each lotus seed represented a kind of power of rule!

The moment this five-star lotus appeared, Ye Yuan felt unprecedented pressure.

But his All-Encompassing Sacred Tree was already raring to go.

Fear did not exist!

This word was not in his, Ye Yuan’s, dictionary.

The youth smiled and said, “My transformation form is called Five-star Lotus. If you can last 30 moves under the Five-star Lotus, you’ll be Second Holy Lord from now on! Ji Zhe can only last 28 moves under my Five-star Lotus! He’s the same as you, also three laws transformation!”

When everyone heard it, each and everyone was extremely shocked.

Even this mountain full of transformation powerhouses was also like that.

They only knew that the three great holy lords were not what they could compare to. But they never knew that the gap between Chief Holy Lord and Second Holy Lord was actually so great!

Hearing these, their gazes when looking towards Ye Yuan became sympathetic.

This boy was so arrogant, he finally ran into his match now, right?

But Ye Yuan was disdainful and said coolly, “Bring it on, so much nonsense! All-Encompassing Sacred Tree, go!”

Ye Yuan was not long-winded either, his entire person turning into a sharp sword, flying straight for Han Yi!

Two rays of sword light surrounded Ye Yuan’s body, overflowing with a murderous aura!

After leaving seclusion, it was Ye Yuan’s first time unleashing both swords together!

That power was more than a level stronger than when fighting with everyone previously.

Everyone’s countenances changed one after another!

Only now did the transformation powerhouses who besieged Ye Yuan previously know that they had already made a trip to gates of hell and back.

Ye Yuan’s movement technique was extremely fast, arriving in front of Han Yi in virtually a blink of an eye.

Han Yi’s pupils constricted too, being startled by Ye Yuan’s strength!

However, what kind of figure was Han Yi? Although he was startled, he did not panic.

Only to see him urge his spell, the five lotus seeds flew out instantly, splitting into five directions, completely enveloping him.

And at this time, Ye Yuan arrived!

Boom!

A loud noise, the two people each took several steps back!

Everyone was dumbfounded with shock!

“My eyesight isn’t failing, right? That boy actually fought to a draw with Chief Holy Lord?”

“This is impossible! How can three laws versus five laws possibly fight to a draw?”

“Just what the hell did this boy comprehend?”

… …

Five laws transformation, this was virtually the ultimate form of transformation.

It could be said to be invincible!

However, Ye Yuan actually fought to a draw against Chief Holy Lord, Han Yi’s five laws, with three laws!

Although they only exchanged one move, Ye Yuan’s skill level was evident at a glance.

It was not up to them to not be surprised!

Ye Yuan beamed and said, “Bragged too hard; I was wondering how formidable you were! Five laws are also nothing more than this!”

The expression on Han Yi’s face finally changed! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Sword, space, formation!?Heh,?terrific lad, I underestimated you! These three kinds of ultimate rules, you actually fused them into one, and even succeeded in transformation! Two swords, one Yin and one Yang, perfect without any flaws, how formidable! You have the qualifications to have a battle with me!”

Although surprised, Han Yi did not turn angry from embarrassment but was faintly very excited instead.

It was as if feeling happy to find an opponent.

He saw through that Ye Yuan was three laws transformation with one glance. But as for the specifics, he could not tell without fighting.

In the collision just now, he clearly felt sword, space, and formation, these three great rules. He could not help being greatly surprised.

He naturally knew how formidable these three rules were.

What was even scarier was that the Great Dao Transformation that this boy comprehended was the perfect form!

Perfect form was a form with no weakness to exploit.

Just like a world, like nature itself, without defects!

The budding two green leaves seemed normal, but in fact, they represented the two polarities of the universe.

The power that these two extreme forces burst forth with was unimaginable!

Although he comprehended the five elements rule, he did not reach this realm.

Hence, even though he comprehended five laws, his power was greatly discounted.

Feeling the other party’s fighting intent, Ye Yuan laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… That’s more like it! Fight again!”
