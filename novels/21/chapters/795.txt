Chapter 799: Holy Follower

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I lost ...”

Nalan Chu was very calm and did not have a sense of loss from being dragged down from his throne by someone as imagined.

“You didn’t lose. If this was a life and death battle, it’s hard to say who the victor will be.” Ye Yuan said.

Nalan Chu shook his head and said, “Lost means lost. I won’t find excuses for my own failure. Furthermore, I know that even if this were a life and death battle, the one who wins, in the end, would definitely be you as well!”

Nalan Chu could sense the bloody aura in Ye Yuan’s sword intent, indicating that the battles Ye Yuan experienced before were definitely much more than him.

Suddenly, Nalan Chu turned around and said to the high platform with clasped hands, “First Elder, from today onwards, I’m withdrawing from this selection competition!”

“What?! Nalan Chu wants to withdraw from the competition!”

“What kind of joke is this?! Even if Nalan Chu lost, he’s at least number two as well, right? Furthermore, what he comprehended is the extremely rare Light Supreme True Intent. The holy land should be grooming him heavily. He actually chose to withdraw!”

“This guy wouldn’t have been triggered due to losing this time, right?”

Nalan Chu’s decision caused an uproar among the crowd.

Although Nalan Chu lost, the degree of his genius was indisputable.

But now, he actually chose to withdraw.

This Nalan Chu was also too much of a glass-heart, right?

But thinking about it wasn’t strange either. After all, a genius like Nalan Chu had never lost before until now. Looks like the impact this defeat had on him was rather huge.

First Elder mused for a moment and said, “Why?”

“Nalan Chu wishes to leave the holy land and go out to make my own break! I hope that First Elder will grant it!” Nalan Chu said firmly.

A period of silence again. Nalan Chu was not anxious either, awaiting First Elder’s reply.

After a long time, First Elder slowly opened his mouth and said, “Go then. Remember, the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land is your home!”

Nalan Chu bowed down and thanked, “Many thanks to First Elder for granting it!”

Finished talking, he turned around to Ye Yuan again and said, “What you said is right. I’ve indeed never met true geniuses before! Ye Yuan, thank you for thoroughly beating me awake today. One day, I’ll definitely defeat you!”

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Okay, I’m waiting for you.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Nalan Chu being able to comprehend the Light Supreme True Intent, it could be seen how high his talent was. If he kept on huddling up in Crimson Afterglow, his talent would be wasted.

The Crimson Afterglow Valley was a lucky chance, but it might not be Nalan Chu’s lucky chance.

The paths of a powerhouse were many. But being trapped in a corner lording over others was definitely not the path of a powerhouse.

Therefore, Ye Yuan naturally admired this decision of Nalan Chu very much.

Moreover, Nalan Chu was different from geniuses like Wu Jiantong. He was not afraid to lose and was adaptable too. He was bound to have accomplishments in the future.

Nalan Chu left the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land just like that. This was what everyone all did not expect.

Before the competition started, Nalan Chu was already internally decided as the candidate for first place. In the end, he actually took the initiative to give up the competition.

But Nalan Chu’s withdrawal also made the struggle for the top ten become even more white-hot.

In the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s holy hall, an elderly silhouette appeared rather lonely.

First Elder stood by the side, his expression clearly quite agitated.

“Holy Lord, your current body, sending three people in is already the limit. How can you send three more people in?” First Elder gritted his teeth and said.

This old silhouette was actually the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s Holy Lord!

It was just that most likely, no one could have thought that the Holy Lord was actually old until such a state.

Hearing First Elder’s words, the Holy Lord turned around and looked at him, and said with a smile, “I already don’t have much time anymore. Take this opportunity that this bunch of old bones still has some use and strive to preserve some successors for the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land. Sigh, I, Tu You, am incompetent, to actually let the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land be ruined at my hands. The selection competition this time indeed discovered a few fine saplings. If they can remember the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s kindness with gratitude, the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land might be able to be rebuilt in the future.”

First Elder’s tears ran down his old face when he heard that and said, “If Holy Lord didn’t deal with that holy follower in order to save the few of us back then, how could you have forcefully executed the Chaotic Essence Singular Qi Grand Technique, resulting in a great loss of longevity? The calamity of today is not Holy Lord’s fault, but the fault lies with us!”

Tu You smiled as he waved his hand and said, “This matter had already passed. No need to say anything. Sending a few of them in, I only lose some longevity; I will not pass away immediately either. You don’t have to be like this.”

Chen Qin had tears in his eyes and did not speak. But the self-reproach in the depths of his heart was anything but little.

“Holy Lord, just what background was that holy follower? His strength was actually so formidable? Clearly he only had Phaseless Realm strength, but even you weren’t a match for him either.” Chen Qin saw that Tu You had made up his mind and could only change the topic.

Tu You revealed a solemn expression and actually said with some fear, “Regardless of what background, it’s not what we can afford to provoke. These few years, I spent considerable effort and only just probed out a tiny bit of information as well. These recent few decades, the holy artifacts stolen were not just our Crimson Afterglow Holy Land. Just these few regions nearby our White Valiant Region, their figures appeared several times before. It’s just that this kind of incidents are happening daily in various corners of the Divine Realm. So no one cares about it.”

Chen Qin was startled inwardly when he heard that. He didn’t expect that Holy Lord was actually inquiring about the other party’s information in the dark these few years. And he actually knew nothing about it too!

Chen Qin knew that Tu You trusted him very much. But this incident, he was kept in the dark from beginning to end.

That only meant one thing: this matter was absolutely very dangerous.

Most likely, the Holy Lord expended a considerable price in order to probe out this tiny bit of information.

“What did Holy Lord ... discover? Just what background was that whatever holy follower?” Chen Qin could not hold back the curiosity in his heart and ask.

Regarding this holy follower, he hated to the bones. If there weren’t for that incident back then, Holy Lord would probably have broken through to Second Level Dao Profound, and the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land would have already become a Rank Eight Holy Land.

But now, all hope was lost!

Even whether the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land could be preserved or not was a question.

The Holy Lord gave a sigh and said, “In these recent few decades, there were quite a few major forces’ holy artifacts that were stolen or snatched away. Among them, there was no lack of Rank Eight, Rank Seven, even Rank Six Holy Lands. Of course, there were also some small forces. And at the back of these incidences all had those black-robed peoples’ silhouettes. Their forms of address were different, but all carry a ‘holy’ word! There are holy follower, holy soldier, even holy general! And among them, the holy followers with the weakest strength has late-stage Phaseless Realm strength!”

Chen Qin was greatly alarmed when he heard that. Even a holy follower had such terrifying strength. Then how powerful would the strength of that whatever holy general be?

One had to know that that holy follower which appeared in the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land was merely just late-stage Phaseless Realm but forced the First Level Dao Profound Realm Tu You to forcefully display a cultivation art which reduced longevity, resulting in his foundations to be utterly ruined.

The strength of this mysterious power was simply too terrifying.

This kind of power was completely not what their Crimson Afterglow Holy Land could afford to provoke.

“In order to inquire about this intel, I paid an extremely heavy price and almost implicated the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land. So later on, I also dispelled plans on taking revenge. This kind of force is completely not what we can provoke. Therefore, that’s why I would organize the Quasi-Holy Son selection competition this time to preserve some successors for the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land,” Tu You said with a slight sigh.
