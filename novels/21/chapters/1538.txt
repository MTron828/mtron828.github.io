Chapter 1542 My Territory, I Make the Call

“Will grant all requests? Heh, truly shameless boast! This old man has immersed in alchemy for so many years and still doesn’t dare to say this kind of big talk! No need to go and care about him. In a few days, their signboard will get smashed.”

Spreading from mouth to mouth, the news of Miracle Hand Parlor’s will grant all requests signboard spread out very quickly.

Wu Feng heard about this Miracle Hand Parlor very soon. But regarding the will grant all requests signboard, he scoffed in derision.

In this world, there was actually someone who dared to claim to grant all requests!

“Master, really don’t need to care? I heard somebody saw that the presiding alchemist actually refined a rank three divine-grade divine pill!” said the manager.

Wu Feng snickered when he heard that and said, “Rank three divine-grade divine pill? Something that propagates erroneously, you actually believe it too! Would someone capable of refining rank three divine-grade divine pills be inside a small medicine shop in this south city?”

But the manager said, “Master, I say ... could it be that kid who cured Zhu Yongtian? That Miracle Hand Parlor is the current Thunderclap Gang’s business.”

Wu Feng’s expression turned stiff, instantly becoming incomparably ugly.

That being said, it was really possible!

“Humph! Isn’t he very capable? Then we’ll send a big gift over! I want to see how he grants all requests!” Wu Feng said with a cold smile.

...

The Sun Moon Gang’s headquarters, Luo Yu and He Xiao were also very interested in this newly emerged Miracle Hand Parlor.

“I’ve already inquired, Master Wu Feng already sentenced Zhu Yongtian to death. It seems like he was brought back to life by this newcomer kid from the Miracle Hand Parlor!”

Luo Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly. This kid that popped out of no idea where actually ruined their good thing.

Zhu Yongtian was Xing Guan’s right-hand man. His death was a tremendous loss to the Thunderclap Gang.

He did not expect that Zhu Yongtian was actually saved by someone in the end. Furthermore, he was even brimming with vitality now, so how could this not anger Luo Yu?

He Xiao smiled and said, “This kid has such high-sounding sentiments! Don’t talk about Master Wu Feng, even those masters in the inner city don’t dare to hang such a signboard too!”

Luo Yu said, “Heh, he’s still young in the end. Saving Zhu Yongtian, he thinks that he’s an alchemy divine physician already. This kid went crazy wanting to be famous, right?”

He Xiao said, “Since he wants to become famous, then let’s help him!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The two people exchanged a glance, revealing a knowing smile.

...

Ning Siyu looked at the Ye Yuan currently diagnosing people’s pulse, a hint of fascination revealing in her eyes.

Was this guy really around the same age as her?

Why could he be impressive to such a degree?

These few days, she followed along by Ye Yuan’s side, becoming a little medicine boy who filled prescriptions and refined medicine. But ... she actually did not have any complaints at all.

Under her endless pestering, Ye Yuan finally agreed to let her stay.

Once the news of the will grant all requests signboard spread out, the guests who dropped in naturally could not dispensed with.

In-between this, there were naturally quite a few complicated and rare illnesses, and also quite a few martial artists who were heavily injured and on the verge of death.

But arriving in front of Ye Yuan, not a single one could actually stump him.

One could say, it was curing the illness when the medicine took effect.

The will grant all requests signboard was really not joking around.

At least all the way until now, a situation that could stump Ye Yuan had not occurred yet.

Ning Siyu’s own alchemy standard was already very high. The majority of the situation here, she could resolve it.

But there were that few cases, she was really helpless to do anything.

However, Ye Yuan had the power to transform something rotten into magical. Until now, no accidents had occurred.

Furthermore, each one that came to the Miracle Hand Parlor, Ye Yuan could virtually do it perfectly!

Ning Siyu touched her own heart and asked herself, even those that she could handle, she could not do it as well as Ye Yuan too.

No, should say way worse!

This guy was simply not human!

Over a few days, Ning Siyu was already thoroughly subdued by Ye Yuan.

“Even though this guy boasted a lot, he really has the capital to boast!” Ning Siyu said to herself.

Little Huan looked at Ning Siyu, feeling that she did not quite recognize her young lady anymore.

Was this still that lawless and rampant young lady?

These few days, her young lord was well-behaved like a little maid in front of Master Ye.

If Master Ye asked her to go east, she absolutely would not dare to go west!

Even the young lady’s master did not have this ability to subdue her too!

However, Master Ye was really too incredible.

Seemed ... even more incredible than the young Lady’s master!

“Get lost! All get lost for me! I want to see a doctor, so the others all scram to the back!”

Suddenly, three to five burly men barged right into Miracle Hand Parlor, driving all of the people outside.

Bang!

The burly man in the lead directly slapped a palm on the table, shattering the table to pieces and said highly-spiritedly, “Brat, attend to me first!”

Ye Yuan currently had his eyes closed, reading someone’s pulse. He did not even lift his eyelids and said indifferently, “Your illness can’t be cured, leave.”

That burly man was stunned and said, “Motherf*cker, you didn’t even open your eyes, how do you know that my illness can’t be cured? Don’t you claim to grant all requests? Why, it’s bluffing people! I will smash your signboard right now! Who ask you to cheat people!”

Ye Yuan still said unhurriedly, “Idiocy can’t be cured, there’s only reincarnating anew!”

“Hahaha!”

Ye Yuan’s words immediately tickled everyone.

The burly man’s face turned red and he bellowed, “All shut up for your father! Who dares to laugh again, your father will make you never able to laugh out loud!”

Everyone’s face changed, all shutting their mouths sensibly.

Everyone all recognized who this burly man was. He was the Silverfeather Gang’s sixth head, Chen Biao, a guy who killed people without batting an eyelid.

If he said to kill people, it was never joking around with you.

“Kid, you dare to fool me? Do you know who I am?”

Chen Biao pointed at Ye Yuan, already reaching his nose.

Ye Yuan said calmly, “Don’t care who you are, go to the back and queue up. Those who cause trouble here, there’s no treatment without exception!”

Chen Biao was just about to fly off the handle when a hulking man barged in from outside.

“Chen Biao, you dare to cause trouble in our Thunderclap Gang’s territory? Do you believe that I’ll exterminate you right now?”

This hulking man was none other than precisely Meng Huo.

He heard that Chen Biao came to the Miracle Hand Parlor in great haste, and he immediately brought people to rush over.

Chen Biao’s eyes swiveled and he said with a smile, “Your father isn’t causing trouble. Your father came to see a doctor today! I have a brother who got a strange illness that can’t be cured no matter what. When we heard that this Miracle Hand Parlor will grant all requests, we came to see a doctor.”

The moment Meng Huo heard, his brows involuntarily knitted together and looked toward the stretcher that Chen Biao brought.

A middle-aged man laid on the stretcher, his complexion waxy, both eyes deeply sunken, already on his dying breath.

He was clear in his heart: this guy definitely came specially to find trouble.

This illness was probably not that easy to treat.

“Then what’s with this?” Meng Huo pointed at the shattered table and said in a deep voice.

Chen Biao said coolly, “Wasn’t I worried about my brother’s safety and was somewhat anxious?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Want to see a doctor, queue up. Not seeing, get lost!”

Chen Biao said in a cold voice, “Humph! There are still so many people in front. If my brother were to die, can you shoulder the responsibility?”

Ye Yuan said without a care, “If he dies, he dies, what has it got to do with me? My territory, I make the call! Queuing up is my rule here. I’m not going to see you. you can get lost already!”
