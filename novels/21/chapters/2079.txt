Chapter 2083: Self-Satisfied

Everyone’s hearts turned cold. Was this opposing Master Ji?

Everyone knew that at present, in this Northernmost Steppe, Master Ji’s limelight was in full bloom, even crushing Ice Cloud Tower until it had to bow its head in submission.

And Feng Tianyang was the extreme north’s number one person of the junior generation, a peerless heaven’s chosen, a powerhouse who was about to step into Empyrean.

These two great gods were going to clash head-on?

Empyrean Xiao Yu’s brows furrowed and he said, “Tianyang, Master Ji enjoys a high prestige and commands universal respect. I’m afraid ... this isn’t appropriate, right?”

Feng Tianyang was unrivaledly domineering as he said with a cold snort, “What’s inappropriate about it? I’ve long wanted to meet this Ji Qingyun. I want to see if he’s really as impressive as the legends say.”

He was not an alchemist and did not have that much awe and veneration toward Ye Yuan at all.

In his view, no matter how impressive this Master Ji was, if he could not be used by him, what use was there?

Since he wanted to meet Master Ji, and there was also such a good excuse, so why not use it?

As for whatever lone man and woman, Feng Tianyang was not worried at all.

In this land of extreme north, no one dared to touch his, Feng Tianyang’s, woman.

Seeing Loneswan not moving, Feng Tianyang said in a cold voice, “What, Loneswan? Can’t hear my words?”

At this time, Feng Tianyang was already very impolite when speaking.

Facing Empyrean Loneswan, he even dropped the honorifics and actually directly called him by name.

Loneswan’s expression flickered incessantly. Vast Wind Assemble was powerful; he could not afford to provoke Feng Tianyang!

Among the extreme north’s factions, they were mutually interdependent and also exercised control over each other.

A major faction like Vast Wind Assemble, its strength exceeded the other factions by significantly a lot. Others naturally could not afford to provoke it.

In the Northernmost Steppe, the situation of one faction swallowing another was not rare.

For the Vast Wind Assemble to have such a scale, it was the result of Empyrean Vast Wind going on expeditions all around.

It was precisely because Empyrean Vast Wind was very domineering, sweeping across the extreme north, that Feng Tianyang had the confidence to treat these Empyreans as he pleased.

Empyrean Ice Cloud was already frightened by Ye Yuan and could only warn, “Tianyang, that Master Ji’s personality is very proud. I’m afraid that ...”

Feng Tianyang sneered and said, “Scared of what? Isn’t Senior Ice Cloud just worried that there will be no one supplying medicinal pills in the future? Rest assured, Lu-er will be this Feng’s wife in the future. Why would I ignore her parental home? Senior Xiao Yu, we’ll supply Ice Cloud Tower’s medicinal pills in the future. There’s no problem, right?”

Empyrean Xiao Yu understood in his heart that Feng Tianyang was making an example out of Ji Qingyun!

It was just that Feng Tianyang was the same as his father, being extremely domineering. He could only nod and said, “No problem!”

The moment Ice Cloud heard, she immediately felt assurance in her heart and said smilingly, “Then ... I really thank you so much, Honorable Nephew Tianyang!”

He Xiangyun was long already bursting with joy behind Empyrean Ice Cloud and complained tearfully, “Master, that Master Ji is really too arrogant. You have to stand up for me!”

That day, she escorted Lu-er to Ye Yuan there. In the end, she was directly dealt a few slaps by Ye Yuan. Until today, the swelling still had not gone down.

After He Xiangyun who had a stricken senseless look returned, she complained tearfully to Empyrean Ice Cloud.

Although Empyrean Ice Cloud was angry, how could she still dare to offend Ye Yuan? She could only swallow the insult and humiliation silently, and swapped with Second Eldest Sister, Yang Fei, to go over.

But now, it was different!

Empyrean Ice Cloud said coolly, “Since that’s the case, you take a trip together with Empyrean Loneswan then. If that Ye Yuan dares to go against Honorable Nephew Tianyang’s orders, directly detain him and bring him here!”

Empyrean Loneswan’s face changed and he said in a cold voice, “Ice Cloud, what’s the meaning of this? Could it be that you’re ignoring this Empyrean?”

“Humph! Loneswan, could it be that you’re deeming this Feng as nothing?” Empyrean Ice Cloud had not spoken yet when Feng Tianyang said with a cold snort.

Loneswan’s expression changed several times. Snorting coldly, he flicked his sleeves and left.

Empyrean Ice Cloud was overjoyed in her heart. She originally thought that Feng Tianyang was just playing with Lu-er. Looking at it now, he clearly regarded Lu-er with great importance. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

With the Vast Wind Assemble as a backer, who would she still be scared of in this Jiu Luo Ji?

“Xiangyun, what are you still in a daze for?” Ice Cloud said coolly.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across He Xiangyun’s face and she followed after.

The group of Empyreans was silent like cicadas in winter. Clearly, they did not expect such a big hoo-haa to occur the moment they met.

Although they were all not willing to offend Master Ji, Feng Tianyang clearly did not think so.

Everyone also discerned that Feng Tianyang wanted to take Ji Qingyun in to use for himself.

If he could not compel him to submit, then he would destroy him.

Although everyone felt that it was a shame, they also did not say anything.

After all, in this Northernmost Steppe, the strong reigned supreme.

In the end, Ji Qingyun was merely a True God Realm.

Even if He Xiangyun went, he was not a match against her.

... ...

He Xiangyun was self-satisfied and already plotting on finding Ye Yuan to settle the scores.

She had lived in this Jiu Luo Ji for so many years and had yet to suffer such unprecedented humiliation before.

She had the personality of seeking revenge for the smallest grievance to begin with. Now that she found a chance, how could she not take revenge?

Previously, not daring to make a move was dreading Empyrean Loneswan on one hand. On the other hand, it was that Ye Yuan’s prestige was too strong, she did not dare to offend.

But now, with Feng Tianyang backing her up, what was she still afraid of?

A mere Ye Yuan, so what even if his pill refinement was any stronger?

With her Ninth Firmament True God powerful strength, wouldn’t trampling on Ye Yuan still be effortless?

“Master, Vast Wind Assemble’s Feng Tianyang has arrived. He said to have you send Miss Lu-er over. Also ... Also ...”

Talking up to here, Empyrean Loneswan truly found it hard to speak out anymore.

At this time, He Xiangyun followed closely behind. Seeing Empyrean Loneswan’s appearance, she could not help laughing mockingly and said in a clear voice, “Ji Qingyun, get out for your grandaunt! Lord Tianyang orders you to immediately bring that sl*t over and offer an apology to him!”

Empyrean Loneswan’s brows furrowed slightly, opening his mouth but did not say anything.

The Vast Wind Assemble was powerful. He, Loneswan, alone, could not afford to provoke!

However, no one answered.

He Xiangyun clearly did not have that patience. Not answering was perfect.

If Ji Qingyun went obediently, she would really not have the reason to explode.

“Senior Loneswan, I believe that you’ve also heard Lord Tianyang’s words. Now, it’s Ji Qingyun making light of Lord Tianyang, don’t blame Xiangyun for taking action!”

Finished talking, He Xiangyun was just about to make a move to destroy the door.

Empyrean Loneswan snorted coldly and said angrily, “Get lost! How can Master’s prestige be what you can violate?”

He Xiangyun’s face changed, but she was not afraid. She then said with a cold smile, “Senior Loneswan, you’re also an exalted Empyrean. To actually acknowledge a Six-star Alchemy God as a master? Now, Lord Tianyang is clearly going to take care of Ji Qingyun. With Vast Wind Assemble’s might, could it be that you wish to resist with your power alone?”

When talking, He Xiangyun had a smug look.

With Feng Tianyang backing her up at the back, why would she think anything of one Empyrean Loneswan?

Empyrean Loneswan’s face changed several times. Finally, he said with a dark expression, “Stay here obediently for this Empyrean. If you dare to move rashly, this Empyrean definitely won’t spare you!”

Done talking, his figure moved and he was planning on pushing the door and entering.

Right at this time, the hall’s door opened with a creak. A figure slowly walked out.

When He Xiangyun saw Ye Yuan, a hint of delight from taking vengeance flashed across on her face. Pointing her finger, she said in a commanding tone, “This young lady thought that you had a tough and unyielding character, and would rather break than bend. Didn’t expect that ... you’re a loser too! Call Lu-er and take a trip with this young lady!”

A faint smile hung on Ye Yuan’s face and he walked over leisurely, his aura growing stronger and stronger.
