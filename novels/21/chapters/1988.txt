Chapter 1992: Perfect Victory!

“He’s all healed? Could it be that what he ate was an immortal pill?”

“This recovery speed is also too fast, right? Previously, I saw that he clearly had an appearance like he was going to die, but now he’s healed in just three days?”

...

When everyone saw Ye Yuan walk toward the Empyrean bone devil, each and every one of them was shocked until they could not close their mouths.

Three days ago, Ye Yuan could not even crawl to his feet.

Three days later, he was completely fine.

Just what kind of medicinal pill did this fellow eat?

“Senior, please make your move!” Ye Yuan said with a scorching gaze.

The bone devil looked at Ye Yuan quietly and slowly opened his mouth and said, “Junior, you’ve already exhausted your potential. It’s impossible to receive the third sword move. This third sword move fused five kinds of laws. You’re simply unable to imagine its power.”

Everyone sucked in a cold breath.

Five kinds of laws; was this really what human strength could accomplish?

Could that era’s geniuses all be able to casually fused four or five kinds of laws?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “No need to say anymore. Senior, please make your move!”

The bone devil said calmly, “The doomsday battle buried too many things in oblivion. You’re not in the wrong. There’s no need for this kind of lame dignity at all. But since you wholeheartedly seek death, then this Empyrean will grant your wish. You watch closely.”

Done talking, the Empyrean bone devil raised his sword once more.

It was still the exact same posture. It was just that this time, it was ordinary to the extreme.

It was as if the entire world became silent.

Just raising the sword, Ye Yuan felt the scent of death hit him head-on.

This sword move, one could not use words to describe it.

Seeing extraordinary amidst ordinary, the sound of thunder between silence.

Everything lied with the sword itself.

This was an extremely profound utilization of Sword Dao. It was brilliant in every way!

People who used the sword that could control it to such a level, Ye Yuan seldom saw it in his lifetime.

It seemed like the other party was the same as him when he was alive, also employing other power of laws with Sword Dao, and reaching the pinnacle from there.

It was just that, fusing four kinds of power of laws with Sword Dao was truly inconceivable.

All of the children of destiny felt asphyxiated. They became wiser this time, staying far away from the center of the two people’s battle, in case they were implicated.

Last time, it was just serious injuries and vomiting blood. This time, it was hard to say.

The Empyrean bone devil said that the power of this sword move was 50 times stronger than the second sword move!

This kind of increment could be rated as horrifying.

They seriously could not imagine what Ye Yuan would rely on to withstand this third sword.

But without a doubt, they all hoped for a miracle to appear.

If Ye Yuan died under this sword, they would have to accept the bone devil’s three sword moves.

Of the remaining people, who had the confidence to block the bone devil’s sword move?

If Ye Yuan died, they would all have to die.

But the problem was, could Ye Yuan block it?

Just as they were questioning, the Empyrean bone devil unleashed his sword.

This time, there was no sword energy. The Empyrean bone devil was going to approach him!

The Empyrean bone devil gripped his sword, stabbing straight for Ye Yuan’s heart.

But Ye Yuan did not move and did not even use Sword Hollow Etch.

Gave up?

Anyone knew that when the Empyrean bone devil’s sword arrived in front of Ye Yuan, that would be a heaven-shocking attack.

Quicker than words could tell.

Without even a blink of an eye, the Empyrean bone devil arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

“Careful, Brother Ye!”

“Brother Ye!”

...

Song Yu and the rest did not know what Ye Yuan wanted to do. Seeing the situation, they turned pale with fright.

Everyone cried out in shock, totally not knowing what Ye Yuan wanted to do.

But right then, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

From Ye Yuan’s dantian area, countless blue fine threads crept out, tangling over toward the bone sword.

Puu, puu, puu ...

The air gave off a series of detonating sounds. Places that the bone sword arrived at, the blue fine threads were actually broken.

But, as the fine threads became more and more, the speed of the bone sword’s advancement also became slower and slower.

“This is ... Dao mark?”

It was the Empyrean bone devil’s first time having a fluctuation in emotion.

How could a Second Firmament True God possibly cultivate Dao mark?

This sword’s power was too great. At first, the Dao marks could not tie it down at all.

But later, the Dao marks became more and more, and increasingly denser.

Finally, the bone sword was entangled.

However, the Dao marks did not stop there. Instead, they continued creeping up, tangling over toward the bone devil.

Gradually, the bone sword was unable to advance an inch further anymore.

The Empyrean bone devil turned pale with fright, the force in his hand becoming stronger.

Second Firmament True God became Third Firmament True God, then became Fourth Firmament True God. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But, it still would not do!

The aura on the Empyrean bone devil’s body became stronger and stronger. When it soared all the way to Seventh Firmament True God, finally, the blue fine threads broke with a snap!

When at Ninth Firmament True God, Ye Yuan finally could not endure the Empyrean bone devil’s powerful strength and was blasted flying out.

Everyone looked at this scene in tremendous shock. They were given a scare.

Such a powerful Empyrean bone devil was actually forced to raise his cultivation realm in the end before he could break free of those blue fine threads.

Where was the agreed-upon terrifying sword move?

Where was the agreed-upon same cultivation realm?

This third sword, the Empyrean bone devil was completely defeated!

Ye Yuan did not even make a move yet and the Empyrean bone devil was defeated by Ye Yuan’s horrifying blue fine threads.

This scene made everyone’s jaws drop. They looked toward Ye Yuan in incredible shock.

The current Ye Yuan already slowly crawled up from the ground.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s ghostly-white eyes, everyone unwittingly felt a chill in their hearts.

What an icy-cold pair of eyes this was!

The current Ye Yuan, his disposition became like a different person from before.

That pair of eyes seemed to overlook all life, not carrying the slightest emotion.

Heavenly Dao!

That was the aura of Heavenly Dao!

How could a Second Firmament True God have such a terrifying aura on his body?

“You talked about how ancient geniuses were so and so; how the third sword was so and so. Looking at it now, it’s also merely thus,” Ye Yuan looked at the bone devil coldly and said indifferently.

Provocation!

Ye Yuan was provoking here!

He was provoking an Empyrean level powerhouse!

Was this guy mad?

However, using the Empyrean bone devil’s words against himself, Ye Yuan indeed made him slap his own face now.

Ye Yuan did not only block this sword move. He even forced the Empyrean bone devil to raise his strength until reaching the Ninth Firmament True God Realm.

This was equivalent to the Empyrean bone devil slapping his own face!

Although they did not do it, these children of destiny actually had a liberating feeling.

From the Empyrean bone devil’s mouth, ancient geniuses were merely able to barely manage to block the third sword move.

But Ye Yuan already forced the Empyrean bone devil to raise his realm to the Ninth Firmament True God Realm.

This proved that Ye Yuan’s talent was far more outstanding compared to ancient geniuses!

The Empyrean bone devil used hollow eyes to stare at Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan used a cold pair of eyes to look at the Empyrean bone devil.

Two uncommon eyes stared just like this, silently.

After a long time, the Empyrean bone devil slowly said, “I take back my words from before! True God Realm comprehending Dao mark, this sort of thing is unheard of. Your talent, people already can’t use common sense to judge it.”

As he said those words, the Empyrean bone devil threw the bone sword in his hand. The bone sword flew toward Ye Yuan.

Everyone’s faces changed drastically. The Empyrean bone devil actually yielded!

“This bone sword is yours. As for His Excellency’s emperor bone, you can bring it away too! Such a prodigy coming into existence, I’m afraid ... the next doomsday battle isn’t far already, right? Your Excellency, I’ve already completed my mission, and I should also rest.”

After the Empyrean bone devil finished speaking, his entire body directly turned weathered, scattering and dispersing with the wind.

Ye Yuan put away the bone sword expressionlessly and slowly walked over toward the top of the bone mountain.

On the summit, the Qilin emperor bone gave off waves of light halo, stirring people’s souls.
