Chapter 2383: A Historic Meeting!

This wait was a thousand years!

In a hidden spatial rift, Ye Yuan and Qin Chao were currently cultivating.

“Senior, you’re really too formidable! I never dared to imagine that someone can comprehend these four great laws to such a level! But why have I never heard of you before this?”

The longer he spent time with Ye Yuan, the more incredulous he felt.

How could a person be monstrous to such a degree?

During these 1000 years, Ye Yuan’s space and time, two great laws, could be said to have flourished with each passing day.

His spatial law already reached rank two source!

Time law already reached 1:300 too!

One had to know, these were two great supreme laws. Being able to advance by an inch in ten thousand years already had to thank one’s lucky stars.

But Ye Yuan completely surpassed Qin Chao’s imagination.

Ye Yuan gave Qin Chao a glance and said smilingly, “This matter, saying it is somewhat fantastical. I also don’t know if teaching you swordsmanship is right or wrong. But since I came, I have got to do something.”

Qin Chao was confused and said, “What’s wrong with teaching me swordsmanship?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “These things, you won’t understand. Uh ... even I don’t understand it myself.”

In this world, Ye Yuan discovered that his speed of comprehending spacetime law was even faster than in the Primeval War Realm!

He felt that this might be due to traversing through spacetime.

It was just that, his sudden appearance broke the balance of the original world in the first place.

Then, was there still meaning in him cultivating these things?

To teach or not to teach Qin Chao, he had also hesitated before.

To kill or not to kill divine race members, he had likewise hesitated before.

But later on, he figured things out.

Since he came here, even if he did nothing, he had already changed the course of the world.

Then, what difference did doing more or doing less make?

Right now, under this spacetime, the human race had clearly not risen yet.

Ye Yuan did not know if this was that era in the last epoch. But since he came, there was no harm in leaving behind Dao teachings to make the human race become a little stronger.

Seeing the human race being bullied by people like this, but not doing anything, this was not his, Ye Yuan’s, style.

Hence, he went to do it without hesitation.

He was very optimistic about Qin Chao. So he was willing to use a thousand years’ time to teach him swordsmanship.

In 1000 years, Qin Chao already went from Empyrean Realm and broke through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor!

“Are you homesick? Or thinking of somebody?” Ye Yuan looked at Qin Chao and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Qin Chao’s face turned red but still nodded his head very shamelessly.

These few days, Qin Chao was always somewhat distracted when practicing the sword. So how could Ye Yuan not tell?

This kid was thinking of Mo Xiaocao.

“Alright. After not going out for so long, it’s also time to go out and take a look,” Ye Yuan got up and said.

Qin Chao’s expression changed and he said, “Senior, you mustn’t! You’re currently already a thorn in the divine race’s eyes! How can you risk your life?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “They aren’t qualified enough to capture me yet! Come on!”

Although the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain did not come with him, Ye Yuan discovered that he could mobilize the power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain across time and space!

Shielding heaven’s secrets with the power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, no one could discover it!

... ...

At Ziwei Sect, the Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse had not left yet.

Although they knew that there was little hope of finding Ye Yuan, Miluo did not give up.

But Ye Yuan quietly entered the Ziwei Sect. How could a mere initial-stage Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm discover it?

Returning to Ziwei Sect, the first thing was not to go and see Mo Xiaocao but to offer greetings to Mo Qingshan.

Seeing Qin Chao, Mo Qingshan’s heart shook wildly.

“You ... You broke through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm so fast?”

Before Qin Chao left, he was merely a Third Firmament Empyrean.

In just a short 1000 years, he already reached the Heavenly Emperor Realm. How could Mo Qingshan not be surprised?

After offering greetings, Qin Chao smiled and said, “Over the past thousand years, Senior went to great lengths to refine many miraculous medicinal pills for me. Roughly 100 years ago, I broke through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm.”

Mo Qingshan opened his mouth wide, looking at Ye Yuan in shock.

He never thought that Ye Yuan was actually an alchemy master!

What kind of medicinal pills could push a Third Firmament Empyrean to become Heavenly Emperor Realm within a thousand years?

If becoming a Heavenly Emperor was so easy, then what was the point of cultivating bitterly?

This young man was really mysterious to the extreme!

In reality, spiritual energy was abundant in this era. Many spirit medicines that were not seen in later generations could all be found here.

To Ye Yuan, casually refining a few rank seven medicinal pills was truly too effortless.

After a bout of small talk, Mo Qingshan forcefully pressed down his shocked state of mind and said to Ye Yuan, “Ye Yuan, a major power of our human race has been waiting a thousand years for you in the Ziwei Sect just to meet you. Wonder if you’re willing to meet him?”

Ye Yuan was rather surprised and said, “Oh? What’s going on, let’s hear it.”

Mo Qingshan recounted the entire sequence of events but discovered that Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly became very fascinating.

It was his first time seeing this young man have fluctuations in emotion.

“You said that he’s called Profound Secrets?” Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and asked.

... ...

When the two people met, they were very calm on the surface, but it was already squalling heavily in their hearts.

What Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was surprised by was that a Heavenly Emperor Realm martial artist appeared in Ziwei Sect and he was actually completely clueless.

What Ye Yuan was surprised by was that this Profound Secrets was not the other Profounds Secrets!

Then this person should be the father of that Profound Secrets of the future generation. He was the powerful existence who sacrificed himself to shield heaven’s secrets!

Only all the way until this moment did Ye Yuan suddenly come to realize the truth, which era he arrived at!

He actually returned to the era of the future generation Profound Secrets’ father in an accident arising from many causes!

At this time, the Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets in front of him had not died yet. Clearly, the colossal plan of the myriad races had not truly begun yet.

Then right now, was it the years before the human race’s great prosperity?

“Am I revisiting history or does this period of history really exist? Why do I feel like everything is a dream? What are time and space? Just what kind of existence am I?”

Seeing Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ father, Ye Yuan’s heart produced even more questions.

He traveled through spacetime, but did this period of spacetime really exist?

If it did not really exist, history was everything that already happened.

But if it really existed, then what was he counted as?

He could not figure it out after racking his brains!

“Really miraculous! You’re clearly standing in front of me, but why do I feel like you don’t exist?” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets broke the silence first, exclaiming with a look of surprise.

His attainments in the path of divination had long already reached the acme of perfection.

Even the divine race’s Celestial Master Miluo was inferior to him in this path. It could be imagined how formidable his strength was.

But a living person was standing in front of him, and yet he gave Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets an extremely unreal feeling.

How ludicrous was this sort of feeling?

He had imagined many kinds of meeting circumstances but never thought that it would be like this.

Ye Yuan also came back to his senses from the shock and said with a smile, “Perhaps, your feeling is right. I really don’t exist. Or should I say that I’m a special existence?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s pupils constricted. He did not expect that what he got was actually such an answer.
