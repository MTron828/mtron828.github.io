Chapter 1147: Terrifying Divine King Domain

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Under the mask was a sage-like appearance.

He looked like he was just an old man with a benevolent countenance.

Even Ye Yuan was also cheated by this old man.

This person was actually ... Han Qing Zi who presided over Ye Yuan’s alchemy battle in Cloudmarsh City!

Honestly speaking, when he saw this face, Ye Yuan was shocked too.

In the Divine Realm, Han Qing Zi could be said to be a rare clear stream and would never take part in any conflicts. His reputation was very good.

Ye Yuan never would have dreamed that this guy was actually such a slaughterer who posed as a person of high morals.

Ye Yuan suddenly recalled that when the Immemorial Medicine Garden opened back then, he never saw Han Qing Zi’s traces all along.

Since he went to Cloudmarsh City, it was impossible to not enter the Immemorial Medicine Garden to take a look.

Ye Yuan did not pay any attention at that time. Looking at it now, this guy had definitely hidden in an obscure corner all along, waiting for the right moment.

And it was precisely because of his cautiousness that he avoided the calamity that time.

The depth of this person’s cunningness was seriously too terrifying!

He also did not expect that Han Qing Zi’s Martial Dao strength was actually so formidable!

“Looks like I was overly persistent! Dealing with you, why is there a need for the divine sword?!”

Han Qing Zi did not care about Ye Yuan’s astonishment and had an appearance of sudden enlightenment.

Very clearly, the time of Han Qing Zi obtaining Su Wo’s inheritances was not very long.

Ye Yuan reckoned that it was also just the likes of over a thousand years.

It was also precisely from that time that he set up such a trade fair, developing it in secret, only awaiting to soar to the skies in one bound.

Over a thousand years, Han Qing Zi did not walk very far out along the true Great Dao of the Sword.

He was at best equally matched in strength with Ye Yuan right now.

However, the divine sword Ziya was ultimately not Evil Extermination’s opponent. This was already a fact that was verified before a million years ago.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said contemptuously, “You don’t even trust your own sword, how can you win me?”

“Killing you, just divine king domain is sufficient!”

Han Qing Zi gave a cold laugh. His divine king domain suddenly activated. A violent sword intent instantly filled the entire stretch of space.

His divine king domain was even broader than Hei Meng’s. It actually reached 20 thousand feet!

What Han Qing Zi said was right. Him using divine art to battle Ye Yuan was met with counter attacks each time.

Although the power of the divine king domain was inferior to the divine sword, with the divine sword’s augmentation, not only was the power of his divine king domain stronger, the area covered was even wider!

But this sword domain was very heterogeneous.

The divine sword Ziya still emitted light quivering sounds. Clearly, it was quite opposed to this.

Divine swords had spirits. It was expressing its displeasure toward Han Qing Zi’s way of doing things.

Within 20 thousand feet radius, Ye Yuan could not even execute greater teleportation and was directly shrouded by the divine king domain.

For a moment, he seemingly sunk into a sea of swords.

Ye Yuan’s divine king domain was directly shattered by himself. Currently, it was unable to condense at all.

At this time, he could only rely on the Evil Extermination Sword in his hand to forcefully resist these sword intents.

Reaching the realm of the Ten Great Divine Kings, they were already disdainful to use divine king domains anymore.

Like the Heaven Stabilizing Divine King, when he was dealing with Ye Yuan, he directly overpowered with Divine Dao laws.

In front of Divine Dao laws, any divine king domain was trash.

However, Han Qing Zi’s current strength was at the stage between Void Mystic powerhouses, closing in on the Ten Great Divine Kings.

His Divine Dao comprehensions were also just that tiny bit stronger than Ye Yuan’s. He was completely unable to crush Ye Yuan.

But the sword intent in his divine king domain carried Divine Dao laws. It was much stronger compared to ordinary divine king domains.

Even if Ye Yuan brandished the Evil Extermination Sword until not even a drop of water could trickle through, it was hard to ward off the all-pervasive sword intent too.

This was the terrifying aspect of a divine king domain.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.

The ever-present sword intent stabbed at every opportunity, slicing onto Ye Yuan’s body every now and then.

Before long, Ye Yuan’s body had a series of additional injuries.

The injuries became deeper and deeper, while the blood flowed more and more, looking gruesomely horrific.

“Hahaha, truly what a shame! A genius like you is indeed Absolute Heaven’s one and only successor. It’s just a pity that geniuses are all short-lived ghosts! Absolute Heaven was like this, you ... are similarly like so!”

Han Qing Zi’s essence energy was thick, pushing the divine king domain to the limits, not giving Ye Yuan the slightest opportunity to catch his breath at all.

At this time, the Nine Phoenix Island was long already in a chaotic mess.

Han Qing Zi was an alchemy path master. He had operated on this island for over one thousand years and naturally would not have just this bit of manpower.

Apart from Hei Meng and Duan Lingfeng, a Void Mystic powerhouse clashed together with Jiang Taicang.

As for Kuang Tianming, Ye Yuan left Elder Tan and Zhao Qian to him for safety.

When those stall owners saw this battle array, how could they still dare to stay? Each and every one ran away from the island.

What made Qiu Yuqiu rather surprised was that at this time, Shark One actually joined the group battle, dealing with Duan Lingfeng together with him.

With him joining in, Duan Lingfeng’s pressure skyrocketed.

Meanwhile, Hei Meng and Ao Qian were locked in a fierce struggle. Within a short time, there was no way of determining the victor.

The commotion of a 20 thousand feet divine king domain was extremely great. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When the Ao Qian and Qiu Yuqiu, who were currently in the heat of fierce fighting at the front mountain, detected this power, their expressions changed drastically.

Ao Qian examined himself and thought that under such a powerful divine king domain, he would lose for sure beyond all doubt!

Furthermore, he knew that His Excellency’s art of greater teleportation only had a distance of 10 thousand feet.

“Hahaha, you’re going to lose if your mind is wandering! But don’t you worry, when Elder Brother takes care of that punk, he’ll come and send you guys down below to accompany him.”

When Hei Meng saw this divine king domain, he was wildly exhilarated.

Han Qing Zi’s strength, he was all too clear.

Although that brat’s strength was not bad, encountering his elder brother, that was absolutely certain death without chances of survival.

Ao Qian’s expression darkened, and he involuntarily increased essence energy some more, wanting to end the battle fast.

But Hei Meng clearly detected his intentions and was not in a hurry at this time anymore. Instead, he fought a seesaw battle with him.

Ao Qian’s strength was a slight notch above Hei Meng’s. But wanting to take Hei Meng down was not something that could be done in a short time.

This way, his heart burned with even greater anxiety.

“Big Brother Kuang, do you think ... Young Master Ye will be fine or not?”

Over here, when Zhao Qian saw that divine king domain, her face was nervous until it became deathly pale.

Kuang Tianming’s complexion was not good either. But he still consoled, “Relax, Ye Yuan won’t be defeated so easily.”

These words even sounded rather uncertain to himself.

The expression of Elder Tan by the side changed again and again but did not say anything.

Clearly, he was not optimistic about Ye Yuan too.

Over 20 thousand radius divine king domain, this was too terrifying.

According to what he knew, the Eight Great Super Holy Lands’ holy lords’ strengths were also merely 10 thousand over feet.

...

Ye Yuan wielded the sword and guarded his vital areas. But the ever-encroaching sword intent still made the injuries on his body become more and more severe.

Although his Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art progressed at a remarkable pace, facing sword intent that contained Divine Dao laws, it was still not quite adequate to look at.

Unless, he could cultivate the Human Path chapter to the great circle of perfection realm, then he could disregard these sword intents.

But sadly, he could not do it.

“Haha, Ji Qingyun, I gave you the chance, but you insist on wanting to deliver yourself to death! Now, I’ll see what you have to take revenge! En?”

Han Qing Zi was currently being pleased with himself when all of a sudden, his expression changed drastically.
