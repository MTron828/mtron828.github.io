Chapter 956: Struggle for Spirit Springs

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan trio headed towards the deep areas. Along the way, it was peaceful as well.

The Vastsun Bright Moon Realm was extremely vast. But the number of spirit springs was very scarce and not that easy to encounter.

As for who could obtain it, it would have to depend on their respectively lucky chances.

Of course, apart from the eye-baptizing spirit springs, there were still many heaven and earth rare treasures within the mystic realm. Those with good luck would similarly reap significant harvests.

When the three people walked to a region of mountain valleys, suddenly, the place ahead was covered in mist, like a mortal world paradise.

Yue Jianfeng could not help being overjoyed as he said in exhilaration, “It’s an eye-baptizing spirit spring. Furthermore, the grade isn’t low! Li-er, let’s go and check it out. If it’s a top-grade spirit spring, it will be yours.”

Eye-baptizing spirit springs were divided into five grade, respectively: low-grade, middle-grade, high-grade, top-grade, and the legendary heaven-grade.

It was said that if a martial artist acquired a heaven-grade spirit spring, it would produce a spirit physique second only to the innate Moonlight Heavenly Eye Physique, with exceedingly powerful ocular powers!

It was just that heaven-grade spirit springs were too rare. The Yue Family entered the Vastsun Bright Moon Realm so many times and also merely obtained it a measly few times before.

Hence, if Yue Mengli could obtain a top-grade spirit spring, it was already expressing thanks to heaven and earth.

Top-grade spirit springs were also not that easy to run into.

“It’s indeed a top-grade spirit spring! Heh, luck this time is really not bad. Just entered the mystic realm for two day’s time and we ran into a top-grade spirit spring! Li-er, you quickly enter the spirit spring. With this top-grade spirit spring, your ocular powers will have hopes of approaching the Divine Luo Realm!” Yue Jianfeng said delightedly.

Ocular arts was a type of magical, yet mysterious technique, equivalent to adding an auxiliary martial technique for the martial artist.

Powerful ocular arts could exterminate the opponent with a wave of one’s hands. Moreover, it was impossible to guard against.

Ocular arts were not just the Vastsun Flameheart Pupil and Moonlight Heavenly Eye, these two types. The Divine Realm’s ocular arts had a wide variety. There were all sorts of abilities.

It was just that these two types of ocular arts were the most renowned in the Divine Realm.

However, no matter what kind of ability the ocular art was, the strength of the ocular art were divided into relative superiority or inferiority.

Ocular arts did not have noble or lowliness. But ocular strength had its own division of realms.

Regardless of what kind of ocular art, they were all divided into Mortal Embryo, Profound Dipper, Purple Essence, Spirit Indulgent, Divine Luo, these five great realms. 1

To ocular art martial artists with postnatal physiques, the highest realm they could reach was Spirit Indulgent.

And in reality, ocular art martial artists capable of reaching Spirit Indulgent realm were exceedingly few. Unless they obtained a heaven-grade eye-baptizing spirit spring, otherwise, there was basically no hope in this lifetime.

The vast majority of ocular art martial artists all stopped at Profound Dipper and Purple Essence, these two realms.

Yue Jianfeng’s ocular powers were already very strong. But it was also merely Purple Essence Realm. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

While an innate Moonlight Heavenly Eye Physique like Yue Mengli’s, the moment they were born, it was Spirit Indulgent Realm! This aspect was what all postnatal martial artists could not compare to at all!

One had to know that a peerless expert like Yue Jianqiu, his ocular powers realm was also merely just Spirit Indulgent Realm.

Eye-baptizing spirit springs, martial artists could only use once in their lifetime. Hence, what grade of eye-baptizing spirit spring Yue Mengli used was very particular.

Top-grade eye-baptizing spirit springs were Yue Mengli’s lowest needs. Otherwise, it would be wasting her innate spirit physique too much.

If she could reach the legendary Divine Luo Realm, then Yue Mengli’s Moonlight Heavenly Eye would be terrifying!

However, Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Li-er, don’t go in.”

Yue Jianfeng’s expression changed, and he said, “Ye Yuan, what’s the meaning of this?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Just a top-grade spirit spring. Even if Li-er used it, it’s also not possible to reach Divine Luo Realm. It’s too wasteful.”

Yue Jianfeng could not help choking up and said crossly, “Do you think that Divine Luo Realm is that easy to reach? My Yue Family ...”

“Your Yue Family produced a total of 58 innate Moonlight Heavenly Eye Physiques in these 100 thousand years. But only one person reached the Divine Luo Realm,” Ye Yuan interjected first.

Yue Jianfeng did not think that Ye Yuan was actually so familiar with the Yue Family’s domestic affairs but still said huffily, “Since you know this, you should know how hard Divine Luo Realm is to attain. Why do you still want to stop Li-er?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “A great era is coming. Powerhouses will definitely gather. Your Yue Family’s past experiences are already useless. If somebody is able to reach the Divine Luo Realm in this age, it’s bound to be Li-er! Or how do you know that she can’t acquire the legendary Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil?”

Yue Jianfeng drew a deep breath. He did not think that Ye Yuan’s ambition was actually so great!

Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil, something that he did not even dare to think about, Ye Yuan actually had his eyes set on this.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said smilingly, “You think that Han Tong they all did not scruple to expose a divine artifact and also had to enter the Vastsun Bright Moon Realm, it would be for the sake of this mere top-grade spirit spring, right? Or perhaps, a heaven-grade spirit spring?”

Yue Jianfeng’s expression was incomparably ugly. His mouth was dry as he said, “They did it ... for the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil!”

“Even an outsider had ideas on the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil. But your Yue Family itself don’t even dare to think about it?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Yue Jianfeng could not help choking up. Ye Yuan’s words rendered him speechless.

At this moment, he felt like his setup were seriously too small, and not as far-sighted as a junior’s way of looking at things.

“Heh heh, since you guys don’t care for a measly little top-grade spirit spring, then give it to us brothers!” suddenly, a boorish voice sounded out.

Several figures suddenly dashed out, surrounding Yue Jianfeng trio in the center.

The one in front was a very skinny man. Looking from the aura exuding off his body, he was actually already a Fifth Level Dao Profound powerhouse!

Behind him were five to six people, all First Level and Second Level Dao Profound martial artists.

This group of people’s strength was very formidable!

Seeing that skinny guy, Yue Jianfeng’s expression changed as well, and said solemnly, “Wang Yao, are you making an enemy out of my Yue Family here? Even if we let you obtain the top-grade spirit spring, are you sure that you can escape the Yue Family’s pursuit?”

Fifth Level Dao Profound powerhouses were all illustrious existences.

This Wang Yao, Yue Jianfeng naturally recognized.

Previously, Han Tong opening up a passageway, this Wang Yao was the group that saw the opportunity arise the quickest, and also the group with the most formidable strength.

Wang Yao knew that the Yue Family definitely would not allow outsiders like them to go in unchecked. So after entering, he got involved with this group of people, for the sake of dealing with the Yue Family’s members.

Yue Jianfeng’s strength was very strong. Originally, Wang Yao did not want to clash with him either. But seeing this top-grade spirit spring, it was not up to him to not be moved.

“Heh heh, man dies in pursuit of wealth, birds die in pursuit of food! With this top-grade spirit spring, breaking through to Sixth Level Dao Profound is also in sight! Why would I not take this risk?” Wang Yao said with a cold smile.

Yue Jianfeng said in a solemn voice, “The spirit springs within the Vastsun Bright Moon Realm all belong to the Yue Family and Zhou Family. You, an outsider, wants to get a share too? I want to see how much capability you have! Ye Yuan, you bring Li-er and escape first. Wait until I dispose of Wang Yao, then I’ll catch up with you guys!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said with a helpless look, “Escape? Just a bunch of trash, why do we have to run? You fight yours, our side here don’t need you to care.”

“Heh heh, my brothers, he, a Phaseless Realm brat, is looking down on us. What should we do?” Wang Yao said with a smile that was not a smile.

“What should we do? Of course, it’s teaching this brat how to respect people!” said a Second Level Dao Profound powerhouse with a cold smile.
