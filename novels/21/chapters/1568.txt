Chapter 1572 Returning Home

Xie Zhaoyun who used to be proud of the success he attained in the past seemed very cautious in front of Xie Jingyi now.

He was afraid!

He was afraid of Elder Ye squaring accounts after the autumn harvest and making things difficult for the Xie Family.

With Ye Yuan’s present status, wanting to eradicate the Xie Family was simply as easy as turning over a hand.

Didn’t they see that the powerful Qin Family turned to dust with a snap of a finger?

Even the second-layered heaven Divine Lord clueless already became a cripple too. Most likely, his life could not be preserved.

That was a second-layered heaven Divine Lord!

The Xie Family was afraid of offending the Qin Family back then and threw a rock down the well, directly striking Xie Jingyi’s name off the Xie Family’s register.

This caused Xie Zhaoyun to be even more uneasy right now.

Although he had little contact with Ye Yuan, it was clearly not very pleasant.

He never dreamed that this little fatty in front of him would actually have a day where he rolled over.

Back then, Xie Jingyi’s divine sea was destroyed. He had once inspected it, there was no possibility of recovery at all.

Who could have guessed that Elder Ye actually brought Xie Jingyi back to life miraculously?

It was no wonder that Elder Ye could become the Pill Tower’s elder too, this means was simply fantastical.

“Oh, Little Yi, Big Brother was extremely happy to hear that you came back and already rushed over from Brilliant Peace City,” Xie Zhaoyun said with a face wreathed in smiles.

Little Fatty’s eyes narrowed slightly and did not have the intention of making conversation.

Xie Zhaoyun had an awkward look, but at this time, he did not have any dissatisfaction.

He knew Ye Yuan’s relationship with Xie Jingyi. The Xie Family’s life and death depended on Xie Jingyi.

As long as he was willing to open his mouth, the Xie Family would be considered saved.

In fact, if Xie Jingyi was willing, the Xie Family might even soar to the sky with one bound, becoming the boss of Wu Meng Capital City!

It was just that the premise of all this was to repair the relationship with Xie Jingyi.

“That ... Also, the ancestor has already re-entered Little Yi, you, into the clan register,” Xie Zhaoyun continued speaking.

But what answered him was still silence.

Xie Zhaoyun was palpitating with anxiety and fear. He felt that the little fatty in front of him was no longer that innocent and pure little fatty anymore.

“Oh, Little Yi, I know that you hate Third Uncle in your heart, hate the Xie Family, but under that sort of situation back then, the Xie Family was compelled by circumstances too! The Qin Family covered the sky with one hand, our ... our Xie Family couldn’t afford to offend! You also know that Qin Xiao is a member of the Qin Family. How ... How can we dare to resist?! Oh, Little Yi, Third Uncle knows that you’re unhappy in your heart. If you can’t vent your anger, then just kill Third Uncle. As long as you can forgive the Xie Family, you can do anything!”

Talking to the back, Xie Zhaoyun shed tears while talking; an appearance of sacrificing his life heroically for a cause.

But right at this time, Xie Jingyi slowly opened both eyes, his gaze icy to the extreme.

“Do you think that ... I don’t dare to kill you?”

Xie Zhaoyun’s entire body was akin to falling into an ice cellar, being covered in goosebumps by that icy gaze of Xie Jingyi.

Xie Jingyi gave a cold snort and said, “Xie Zhaoyun, stop pretending in front of me! Do you think that I’m still that fool who’s ignorant of the ways of the world back then? Put that away! If you really disgust me even more, I’ll pull the Xie Family up by the roots!”

Xie Zhaoyun’s entire body trembled, being shocked by that cold killing intent of Xie Jingyi.

He finally realized that this Xie Jingyi before his eyes was no longer that innocent and pure little fatty anymore.

He would really kill people!

The Xie Family was already clouds and mist that had come and gone to him.

Xie Zhaoyun was silent like cicadas in winter and actually did not dare to make a sound again.

A dignified Origin Deity Realm powerhouse did not even dare to breathe loudly in front of a half-step Origin Deity.

“Get lost!” Little Fatty said coldly, scaring Xie Zhaoyun until his neck shrunk.

How could he still dare to remain, running away like a puff of smoke?

After Xie Zhaoyun left, Ye Yuan walked in from outside.

Only after seeing Ye Yuan did Xie Jingyi’s expression ease up slightly.

Ye Yuan knew that Xie Zhaoyun came to find Little Fatty before, but he did not say anything, but said, “Come, I’ll bring you to a place.”

Little Fatty was stunned and said, “Where to?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’ll know after going.”

...

The violent spatial turbulent flow continuously scoured this endless space.

Here, it was impossible for any living things to survive.

But at this time, a stream of flowing light passed through the layers of turbulence, breaking the ice and advancing.

Inside the Purple Extreme Hall, Ning Siyu, Liang Wanru, and Xie Jingyi, three people, were shocked beyond their wildest imaginations.

“Master Ye, this ... this hall is really too impressive, to actually be able to pass through a spatial storm! Could ... this be a celestial deity mystic treasure?” Ning Siyu marveled in wonder.

“Celestial deity mystic treasure? No, this is a true god mystic treasure! A peak true god mystic treasure!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

The three people opened their mouths wide and could not close them for a long time.

True god mystic treasure, what kind of concept was that?

Little Fatty and Liang Wanru were still alright, but Ning Siyu’s understanding was completely not what the two of them could compare to. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

True god mystic treasure, that was absolutely an existence that made the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City go crazy.

Once known by the outside world, there would be countless celestial deities, even true god powerhouses who would make a move to snatch it.

Ning Siyu finally understood why Ye Yuan would be so calm when facing those Divine Lord powerhouses.

With this Purple Extreme Hall, he did not fear those Divine Lord powerhouses at all.

This was his greatest trump card!

However, Ning Siyu felt very pleased in her heart too. Ye Yuan bringing her here meant that he treated her as one of his own already.

Ning Siyu was completely Ye Yuan’s little fangirl right now and definitely would not betray him. Instead, she was proud of this.

“However ... what did you bring us to a small world for? Could it be that this place has some precious treasure coming into being? This small world is very concealed, how did you discover it?” Ning Siyu said curiously.

By the side, Liang Wanru felt puzzled too. But very soon, her gaze gradually became bright.

Also, the Long Zhan not far away, he was incomparably agitated in his heart too.

Over 100 thousand years had passed, he was finally able to return to his hometown!

Ye Yuan glanced at Liang Wanru and said with a smile, “Wanru, didn’t you already guess something?”

Liang Wanru herself did not quite dare to believe it either, but she still said, “Could ... Could you really have ...”

Right then, then Purple Extreme Hall rushed straight out of the spatial turbulent flow, passing through the World Locking Gate.

Ye Yuan brought everyone and moved, arriving above the sea.

Ye Yuan said to the three people with a smile, “Welcome to my hometown, the Immortal Grove World!”

Ning Siyu’s eyes went wide and she said in disbelief, “Y-Y-Y-You’re saying that you came from this small world? Impossible! Absolutely impossible!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “As a matter of fact, I came from here. About this, Wanru can testify.”

Liang Wanru’s astonishment was not the slightest bit less than Ning Siyu’s.

Although she had some surmises previously, getting Ye Yuan’s confirmation still made her feel incredulous.

Liang Wanru drew a deep breath and said, “No wonder you were so severely injured back then. It turns out that ... you passed through the spatial turbulent flow! But ... how is this possible? You had just broken through to Grotto Profound Deity Realm back then!”

Ning Siyu was shocked again, her mouth opening wide, full of astoundment.

Initial-stage Grotto Profound passing through the spatial turbulent flow?

Was this an Arabian night fantasy tale?

Also, how could a martial artist who came out of a small world possibly be so monstrous?

The so-called geniuses in small worlds were less than even trash when placed in the Heavenspan World!

Ning Siyu never dreamed of this degree of monstrosity until no more common sense can be associated with that the freakish Elder Ye actually came from a small world!
