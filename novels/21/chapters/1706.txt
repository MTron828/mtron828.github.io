Chapter 1710 Domineering

When Jian Ping saw Ye Yuan, he said with a cold smile, “It’s you! Heh heh, enemies really meet on a narrow path!”

Jian Shaoning’s brows furrowed and he said, “Junior Brother, you know each other?”

Jian Ping smiled and said, “More than knowing each other! Heh heh, my eyes were almost blinded by this kid! Eldest Senior Brother, no matter what this punk is here for, don’t agree with what he wants!”

Jian Shaoning chuckled and said, “That’s for sure, still need Junior Brother to say?”

Ye Yuan’s face turned cold, his eyes when looking at Jian Ping was full of coldness.

This guy was seeking death to the end!

If the last trace of hope of him getting Li-er’s news was cut off, even if offending the entire Extreme Light Imperial City, he would also have to kill this guy.

Being looked at by Ye Yuan like this, not only did Jian Ping not have the least bit of awareness, he instead had a provocative look as he said, “Brat, are you very angry right now? Heh heh, it’s useless, this is the outcome of offending this young master!”

Jian Zhentao’s face fell and he said, “Move aside, I’m going to request an audience with Pavilion Lord!”

Jian Shaoning sneered when he heard that and said, “Jian Zhentao, don’t you forget your identity! You’re no longer the Profound Secrets Pavilion’s elder currently, what right do you have to go and meet Pavilion Lord?”

Jian Zhentao’s face fell and he said, “This old man isn’t an elder, but also didn’t withdraw out of the Profound Secrets Pavilion! Jian Shaoning, if you dare to block my path, then you and I will have a battle today!”

Jian Shaoning laughed loudly and said, “Fight then, am I scared of you?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Jian Ping smiled coldly and said, “Jian Zhentao, you’re my eldest senior brother’s defeated foe. Raising flowers and grasses for 200 years, why? Fortified your ambition?”

Jian Zhentao ignored Jian Ping and looked at Jian Shaoning as he said, “Are you giving way or not?”

“Not giving way, can you do anything to me?” Jian Shaoning said with a disdainful look.

Jian Zhentao gave a cold snort and suddenly smacked a palm out.

Jian Shaoning laughed coldly and directly met it. The two people instantly clashed together.

“Heh, this is also too fast! Elder Jian Zhentao has just come back and already went to war with Elder Jian Shaoning.”

“But Elder Zhentao isn’t Elder Shaoning’s match at all, this is inviting humiliation!”

“He’s doing it for that kid, right? Wonder who he is, to actually stand up for him like this.”

...

The battle between two great elders immediately attracted a lot of people to surround and watch.

But everyone was not very optimistic about Jian Zhentao. After all, the two people had exchanged blows in the past, Jian Zhentao had fewer wins and more losses.

But very soon, everyone discovered something amiss.

Jian Zhentao’s aura was currently rising steadily!

The moment they started, Jian Shaoning discovered that something was wrong.

This Jian Zhentao seemed to be different from in the past!

Bang!

Suddenly, Jian Zhentao smacked a palm out, directly blasting Jian Shaoning flying out.

Jian Shaoning’s essence sea churned, looking at Jian Zhentao with a look of disdain as he said, “You ... You actually touched that threshold!”

Jian Zhentao said coolly, “I still need to thank you! If not for you kicking me out of the Profound Secrets Pavilion, I’d probably also just be ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord in this lifetime, right? To really talk about it, Little Friend Ye Yuan, the source of this matter is still on you! Thinking about it now, Little Friend Ye Yuan has deep fortunes, I benefited from your light!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s Senior whose fate should be so. How is there Ye Yuan’s credit?”

Jian Zhentao shook his head and said, “Members of my Jian Family believe in this kind of destiny the most. My strength is feeble and can’t see through, but I can also guess some of it. Alright, let’s go.”

Jian Shaoning’s expression was incomparably ugly as he said in angrily, “Jian Zhentao! Don’t you dare!”

Jian Zhentao brought Ye Yuan and walked past from the side, disinclined to even give him a glance.

Without warning, a horrifying aura descended from the sky!

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan three people were akin to being struck by lightning, directly spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood.

“Celestial Deity powerhouse!” Ye Yuan’s face changed and he gritted his teeth and said.

Clearly, this Celestial Deity powerhouse was not friendly.

Ahead, a figure slowly walked out, gaze like lightning.

The moment Jian Shaoning and Jian Ping saw, they could not help saying with joy, “Master!”

Jian Zhentao’s expression similarly changed and he exclaimed, “Grand Elder Tianhua!”

Jian Tianhua looked at Jian Zhentao coldly and said in a solemn voice, “Zhentao, you’re becoming more and more unruly! Is there still me, this grand elder, in your eyes?”

Jian Zhentao’s expression changed and he gritted his teeth and said, “Zhentao ... Zhentao doesn’t dare!”

In front of a Celestial Deity powerhouse, Jian Zhentao had no confidence at all.

Jian Tianhua gave a cold snort and said, “You don’t dare? If I didn’t come, were you going to tear down this Profound Secrets Pavilion? Mn?”

A calm talk, but with the words fused with the pressure of a Celestial Deity powerhouse. Jian Zhentao spewed out another mouthful of old blood.

“Even if your two eyes regained sight, you still haven’t regained the position of elder currently. You actually dared to attack a Profound Secrets Pavilion’s elder? Who gave you such gall? Mn?” Jian Tianhua said in a cold voice.

By the side, the others were silent like cicadas in winter.

While Jian Shaoning and Jian Ping had excited looks. With Jian Tianhua standing up for them, their waist immediately toughened up.

“Master, Jian Zhentao insisted on bringing this unknown brat to see the pavilion lord just now. I stopped him and he attacked me; simply unbridled in his truculence!” Jian Shaoning reproached angrily.

Jian Tianhua gave Ye Yuan a glance and said with a cold snort, “Pavilion Lord comprehends heaven’s secrets every day, so how could he have time to meet an irrelevant kid? Zhentao, you’re becoming more and more absurd! Come, men! Detain Jian Zhentao into jail and imprison for 30 years, so as to punish him!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, he did not expect for matters to reach such a state.

In front of a Celestial Deity powerhouse, he did not have the slightest capital to resist at all.

This Jian Tianhua was clearly intentionally suppressing Jian Zhentao in order to stand up for his disciples.

But he was a Celestial Deity powerhouse, and none of them had the capital to rebut at all!

“Senior, this doesn’t concern Senior Zhentao. It was this Ye who made him bring me to go request an audience with the pavilion lord with treating his eyes as the condition! If Senior wants to punish, just let it fall on this Ye!” Ye Yuan blocked in front of Jian Zhentao and said neither obsequiously nor haughtily.

If not for the sake of meeting the pavilion lord, Ye Yuan would have long fallen out now.

But in order to get Li-er’s news, he had to endure!

If he even offended a Celestial Deity powerhouse, he would likely really have no chance anymore.

Jian Tianhua looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “This is my Profound Secrets Pavilion’s internal affair! Who the hell are you, to dare intervene in this seat’s affairs? Also, you arbitrarily barged into the Profound Secrets Pavilion, could it be that you still want to escape this seat’s punishment? None of you three can escape!”

Finished talking, Jian Tianhua’s body gave off a peerlessly powerful world power and crushed over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s complexion turned deathly pale all at once!

This was the world power belonging to a third-layered heaven Celestial Deity, how powerful was it?

Ye Yuan secretly revolved chaos divine essence, forcefully resisting this pressure that could topple mountains and overturn the seas.

Jian Tianhua was slightly surprised in his heart, not expecting that a measly little second-layered heaven Divine Lord could actually withstand his pressure.

He sneered inwardly and was just about to make a move to take Ye Yuan down when a nonchalant voice suddenly echoed in the Profound Secrets Pavilion.

“Tianhua, let him come up!”

Jian Tianhua’s expression changed, his eyes full of doubt, as he said unwillingly, “Yes, Pavilion Lord!”
