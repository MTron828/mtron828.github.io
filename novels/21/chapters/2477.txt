Chapter 2483: Forsaken by Friends and Allies

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was afraid!

A power capable of controlling a world was seriously too terrifying.

Therefore, he would rather not go and uncover this lid.

Because uncovering it would mean going to confront it.

Just like the mortals in his small world, no matter what boundary they cultivated to, it was also impossible to defeat him.

How could they possibly defeat such an existence?

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Sorry, I have to do this thing. Because if I don’t do it, I won’t be able to save Li-er. Relax. Regardless of who he is, he will be faced by me!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled bitterly and said, “Face? What will you use to confront him?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Maybe I can really break the shackles?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ entire body trembled and he said in alarm, “I-Is this really true?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I have a feeling that my cultivation realm hasn’t reached the end yet! It’s just that, for the time being, I haven’t found the way to break through yet.”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets had a look of astonishment and he said, “How is this possible? Deva Fifth Blight is the end. How … How did you do it?”

Ye Yuan said, “Actually, Lin Chaotian guessed half of it correctly. I indeed became powerful because of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. It’s just that my greatest reliance isn’t the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, but a set of cultivation methods that I comprehended from the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. It’s precisely this set of cultivation methods that made me who I am today. But unfortunately, your small worlds have already been set, and you can no longer cultivate this set of cultivation methods anymore.”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ pupils constricted and he said, “A cultivation method capable of breaking the shackles! C-Could it be that our cultivation was all wrong?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “My small world isn’t opened up by myself, but it evolved and formed naturally. When you all cultivate to the Deva Realm, the small world already reached the end form. But my small world isn’t fully formed yet. This is also why I don’t need to cross the Deva blight tribulation.”

Monstrous waves were set off in Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ heart.

The impact that Ye Yuan’s words had on him was seriously too strong.

Ye Yuan’s small world actually had not taken shape yet!

The cultivation method of everyone in the Heavenspan World was actually wrong!

What was even scarier was that Ye Yuan actually walked out a path that belonged to himself!

This talent simply rendered people speechless.

Others all used one in a million to describe talent.

But Ye Yuan was the only one in the Heavenspan World!

Among trillions of living beings, he was the only one!

After a long time, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “No wonder! No wonder how this emperor divined it, I wasn’t able to see through your destiny too. Your destiny has already jumped outside of Heavenly Dao. How can it be what a mortal could divine? Whatever unpredictable child, whatever talks of destiny, it doesn’t exist to you!”

The two people were currently chatting when Jian Yunxin came.

“Lord Saint Azure, Father, there’s a Deva Fourth Blight martial artist outside called Zhang Zhen, who says that he has an urgent matter to see Lord Saint Azure,” Jian Yunxin said.

Ye Yuan said, “Did he say anything?”

Jian Yunxin shook his head and said, “He didn’t say anything. He says that the matter is of utmost importance and must see you in person.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Let him come in then.”

Before long, a middle-aged man wearing a navy blue robe walked in under Jian Yunxin’s lead.

The moment the arrival saw Ye Yuan, he knelt down and said, “This lowly one Zhang Zhen pays respect to Lord Saint Azure, Lord Profound Secrets!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Get up. What are you looking for me for?”

Zhang Zhen fished out a very strange-looking stone. But the moment this stone appeared, an aura of Great Dao immediately filled the great hall.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ pupils constricted and he said, “Heavenspan Token!”

Ye Yuan asked rather curiously, “This strange stone is the Heavenspan Token?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets nodded and said, “This aura can’t be wrong!”

Zhang Zhen said, “This lowly one came here to offer the Heavenspan Token to Lord Saint Azure!”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “Such a treasure, you actually want to offer it to me?”

Zhang Zhen nodded and said, “Yes!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Can you tell me the reason?”

Zhang Zhen said, “To be candid, this lowly one is Dao Ancestor Life’s subordinate! This Heavenspan Token was also snatched from the hands of numerous powerhouses under his orders!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he became even more curious.

Lin Chaotian’s subordinate was actually giving the Heavenspan Token to him?

Only to see Zhang Zhen continue, “But this lowly one doesn’t want to work for that shameless man anymore! Lord Saint Azure understands and sympathizes with martial artists of my generation, making contributions high until it shocks the world. This lowly one admires Lord Saint Azure greatly! Therefore, this lowly one is willing to offer this token to Your Excellency! Furthermore, to be honest with you, this lowly one still has another Heavenspan Token in my hands. I hope that I can get Lord Saint Azure’s protection and bring me into the Heavenspan Mountain!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he immediately understood.

The struggle for Dao Ancestor this time was totally different from last time.

They all, these Deva Realm martial artists, could only be the vassals of the various great Dao Ancestors.

Otherwise, there would not even be a chance to enter.

Hence, regardless of who obtained the Heavenspan Token, they would probably have to choose to join a faction.

Over on the nine great Dao Ancestors’ side, their reputation already went sour. Even their own subordinates were actually unwilling to follow them anymore!

This Zhang Zhen actually wanted to seek his protection.

When Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets heard that, he could not help laughing as he said,?“Hoho,?the public attitude! Lord Saint Azure’s name of being a saint already reigns supreme in the Heavenspan World! I reckon that Zhang Zhen is just the beginning. In the future, I’m afraid that there will be even more martial artists coming here to seek your refuge.”

Zhang Zhen followed up, “Yes! Lord Saint Azure had extremely high prestige in the eyes of martial artists of my generation! Whoever mentions Lord Saint Azure all can’t help but give a thumbs up.”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he could not help being speechless too.

He also did not expect that such a thing would actually happen.

However, he shook his head and said, “Leave, I can’t protect you.”

Zhang Zhen was taken aback and his expression immediately changed drastically and he said, “Your Excellency, w-why is this? Could it be that … Your Excellency looks down on me because of my background?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “It has nothing to do with your background. It’s just that when I enter the Heavenspan Mountain, I won’t be taking part in the struggle for Dao Ancestor. I’ll naturally be unable to protect you.”

Zhang Zhen opened his mouth wide and said with a look of disbelief, “Y-Your Excellency is actually not competing to be a Dao Ancestor?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I’ll enter the Heavenspan Mountain, but it’s just in order to obtain the Tear of Life. I’m not interested in the position of Dao Ancestor.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Zhang Zhen was utterly speechless.

Presently, the entire Heavenspan World was crazy for the position of Dao Ancestor.

Outside, blood already flowed like rivers for a single Heavenspan Token.

But this big shot actually turned his nose up at the position of Dao Ancestor!

He thought about it and said, “Your Excellency, accept this Heavenspan Token. I only request for Your Excellency to bring me into the Heavenspan Mountain. After entering the Heavenspan Mountain, this lowly one will naturally go and find lucky chances on my own. What does Your Excellency think?”

Ye Yuan was just thinking of opening his mouth to refuse when Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said, “Lord Saint Azure, if you reject, they can only choose the nine great Dao Ancestors. With these people’s shitty characters, they will definitely only be making use of these people. I’m afraid that in the end, they won’t be able to avoid the end result of dying. Right now, apart from you, no one can guarantee their safety. Moreover, you definitely won’t let those few people off. There has got to be someone replacing them so that you can make a move. Isn’t that so?”
