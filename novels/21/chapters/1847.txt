Chapter 1851: Confounding Black and White

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Leng Hao’s heart was practically jumping out of his throat.

Happiness came so suddenly!

No, wait, should say that his many years of hard work had not been in vain!

Foster Father he still kept his thoughtfulness in mind!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Several figures dashed straight onto the stage, surrounding Ye Yuan in the middle.

But Leng Xu’s face changed and he said furiously, “Uncle, no matter how displeasing to the eye you find me, you also can’t confound black and white, right? This matter has nothing to do with Ye Yuan. You let him go, I’ll shoulder all of the charges!”

The current Leng Xu was really disappointed to the max with the Leng Family.

He had never wanted to fight for anything before. But the vortex of the mundane world insisted on dragging him in, stirring him up until he was reduced to pieces.

This feeling made him somewhat mentally and physically exhausted.

Because of Ye Yuan, he was able to stand on the stage dignified and openly today, defeat Leng Hao, and win back his own heart.

Because of Ye Yuan, he could walk out of decadence and find that former self.

Now, if Ye Yuan was dragged down because of this matter, he could not forgive himself no matter what.

However, Leng Hongxiu’s face fell and he said, “Insolence! Your meaning is that I lied in front of so many people? You keep saying that Leng Hao is like this, like that, this is all your one-sided words! Then how do I know how many things you’ve done to let down the Leng Family? Back down!”

Leng Xu’s complexion was like dead ash, but he refused to take a single step back. Blocking in front of Ye Yuan, he said stubbornly, “I’m not backing down!”

Leng Hongxiu’s face turned dark and he said, “I announce that starting from today, Leng Xu’s position of young patriarch is abolished! Leng Hao is the Leng Family’s new young patriarch! All attack for me, take both of these two down for me!”

The moment Leng hao heard this, his face revealed a hint of wild elation.

So many years of long-cherished wish, he finally got his wish!

Furthermore, looking at the situation today, Leng Xu would find it hard to escape death.

Heh, a man knows when to yield and when not to. Just an outsider, is it worth it to die for him?

In his heart, he was very disapproving of Leng Xu’s way of doing things.

But it was also precisely because of this that it gave him an opportunity to exploit.

At this time, Han Dongjun laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha, Leng Hongxiu, don’t need to trouble you to take action against this little animal. I’ll directly capture him and be done with it!”.

Leng Hongxiu nodded his head lightly and did not say anything.

Now that it came to this, whoever capture Ye Yuan was the same.

In the black-clothed man’s sea of consciousness, he naturally saw many things.

Many of them even harmed the Leng Family’s interests.

But there was one thing, a very large part of the things was done for him and Leng Qiuling.

With this, it was sufficient!

What he searched was not Leng Hao’s soul. He could only deduce Leng Hao’s goal through these things.

Although it was wrong for Leng Hao to have done these things in order to become the young patriarch, it was also not unforgivable.

The most important thing was that Leng Hongxiu inherently felt empathetic for Leng Hao.

He was also suppressed by his big brother back then until he could not lift his head. All the way until he gave birth to an excellent daughter that it eased up somewhat.

So he knew how difficult it was for Leng Hao to obtain his status today with his identity.

Han Dongjun laughed loudly and looked at Ye Yuan with a smug look as he said, “Brat, you got no temper now, right? Your mouth is formidable, but sadly, your strength is too weak! In front of me, Han Dongjun, you’re just an ant! Ants, can’t possibly escape my control!”

Finished talking, Han Dongjun’s world power released, and arrived with a howl!

The violent world power crunched over towards Ye Yuan, confining all of the space around him.

Ye Yuan could only get captured without resistance!

Bang!

A loud noise came over, Han Dongjun’s entire person pounced onto the ring.

However, Ye Yuan’s figure was already gone.

“This ... What’s going on here? Where’s Ye Yuan?”

Everyone looked at this scene with astounded faces. They did not even blink their eyes, but Ye Yuan disappeared without any traces just like this.

Rather, Leng Hongxiu’s expression changed. That calm and collected expression finally had a trace of change.

“Are you looking for me?” Up above in the sky, Ye Yuan stood in the air as he said coolly.

Han Dongjun’s face changed and he exclaimed, “S-Spatial shift! How is this possible?”

“Spatial shift? Fourth Firmament spatial law? My God!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No wonder this kid is so arrogant, he actually comprehended spatial law!”

“Unless it’s a True God powerhouse, otherwise, nobody can keep him behind at all!”

...

The crowd immediately burst into an uproar.

Their strength was too weak and could not see clearly how Ye Yuan escaped Han Dongjun’s certain-kill blow just now.

The Fourth Firmament spatial law, this kind of law comprehension was virtually a god-like existence to them.

Although people who comprehended spatial law were few, they were also not zero.

In a place like the imperial capital, there would still occasionally have that one or two appear.

But, being able to cultivate spatial law to the fourth firmament, spatial shift this step, there were absolutely none!

Ye Yuan having this magical ability, within Celestial Deity Realm, no one could make him stay at all.

Han Dongjun’s spatial confinement seemed powerful. But in front of Ye Yuan, it was simply child’s play.

It was too easy for him to want to escape Han Dongjun’s confinement.

“You said just now, I’m an ant, and that it’s impossible to escape your control. Then ... what say you now? You can’t even catch an ant and also dare to speak wildly here?” Ye Yuan looked at Han Dongjun, a mocking look on his face.

The expression on Han Dongjun’s face was extremely ugly. He boasted too big just now, how could he have known that Ye Yuan still had such a contingency plan?

Now, it was really losing face until his granny’s house.

Seeing the Leng Family people’s amused smiles, he had an aggrieved look.

Ye Yuan could display spatial shift. No matter how many people he brought, it was also impossible to keep Ye Yuan behind.

Now, going back to request for reinforcements, Ye Yuan would have long escaped to God knows where.

Therefore, he could only cast a pleading look towards Leng Hongxiu.

“Leng Family Head, my son’s death, Leng Xu can’t escape responsibility either! I hope that the Leng Family gives me an account!” Han Dongjun was still assuming an arrogant air.

When the old patriarch died, the Leng Family’s strength fell greatly.

The present Han Family’s strength was even a bit stronger than the Leng Family. He did not need to give the Leng Family this face!

Leng Hongxiu’s face fell and he said, “Insolence! Who the hell do you think you are, to also dare speak to me like this?”

“Puhwark!”

Under Leng Hongxiu’s powerful pressure, Han Dongjun directly spewed out a mouthful of blood.

“Leng Hongxiu, you!”

Leng Hongxiu’s expression was dark and he said in a cold voice, “A tiger not demonstrating his power, you really take me to be a sick cat? Even if my Leng Family is far from before, it’s also not what a random nobody like you can provoke! Now, immediately scram for me! I’ll detain the person. If you want the person, have Han Tianyu come find me personally!”

Once a True God was enraged, how mighty was that!

Han Dongjun’s face was ashen. His expression changed several times, and he finally roared, “Leave!”

After he left, Leng Hongxiu looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Young man, let yourself be seized without any resistance. If I take action, the aftermath will be hard to say!”

Ye Yuan did not speak yet, but then he heard Leng Qiuling behind him heaved a sigh. She said, “Lord Father, this matter, let’s stop here!”
