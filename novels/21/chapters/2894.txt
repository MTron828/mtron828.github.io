Chapter 2900 Taking the Initiative to Attack!

“Brother Clearcloud, long time no see!” When Feng Xiaotian saw the arrival, he shouted with a smile.

Dozens of Emperor Realm powerhouses came toward them, the commotion very huge.

These people were precisely transferred over from the various sects!

There were over 100 thousand people who came to South Qi Giant City this time.

The various major sects had virtually exhausted all that they had.

The one in the front was precisely the Extreme Medicine Sect’s Extreme Light Pavilion’s head pavilion elder, Hegemon Cloudmount’s eldest disciple, Li Clearcloud.

This time, even he moved out too.

Seeing Feng Xiaotian, Li Clearcloud also greeted warmly and said with a smile, “Little Tian, your strength seems to have grown stronger again! It looks like you’re not far from Hegemon Realm anymore!”

Feng Xiaotian smiled bitterly and said, “Hegemon Realm is easier said than done! Brother Clearcloud’s strength is immense. Aren’t you lacking this opportunity too?”

Li Clearcloud was not of the cowardly faction. Many years ago, Li Clearcloud had fought shoulder-to-shoulder with Feng Xiaotian before.

It was just that at that time, Feng Xiaotian’s strength had not reached Emperor Sakra Heaven, and he was just a junior.

But at that time, he was already a rising new

star.

Li Clearcloud’s gaze landed on Ye Yuan, his expression somewhat strange.

When Feng Xiaotian saw the situation, he was about to introduce Ye Yuan to Li Clearcloud, but Ye Yuan beat him to it and said, “I pay respects to Eldest Senior Brother!”

Feng Xiaotian’s pupils constricted. Eldest senior brother?

Wouldn’t that be ...

Sure enough, Li Clearcloud gave a cold snort and got angry as he said, “You, this fellow, you’re also messing around too much. Do you not want your life anymore?”

Although he was angry, the concern in his words was not only expressed in words but also on his face.

Ye Yuan bowed and said, “Eldest Senior Brother lectured rightly. Ye Yuan won’t dare the next time.”

Only when Li Clearcloud heard it did his expression become slightly better.

Feng Xiaotian looked toward Ye Yuan and said with a bitter smile, “Younger Brother Ye, you hid from this brother badly! It turns out that you’re actually Ancestor Cloudmount’s disciple!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Previously, it was also being compelled by circumstances. I hope that Brother Feng can forgive me.”

But Feng Xiaotian sighed and said, “Ancestor Cloudmount truly has discerning eyes like burning torches! His disciples are all astonishing like devas! Younger Brother Ye even surpasses the ancients and amazes the contemporaries!”

Presently, Ye Yuan’s limelight was too strong.

Over on the blood race’s certain-kill name list, he had likely long already ranked above Hegemon Cloudmount’s disciple, this status.

Therefore, there was naturally no need to hide his identity anymore as well.

But, once it was announced, there was another uproar.

Everyone’s admiration for Ye Yuan spewed forth even more in an unceasing flow of words.

As Hegemon Cloudmount’s disciple, he could originally have cultivated in the rear with peace of mind. Nobody would have said any gossip.

But he entered the enemy camp by himself, creating this unprecedented great victory!

It was not up to the people of the world to decide not to admire!

......

In the City Lord Manor, South Qi’s upper echelons were all present.

Feng Xiaotian said, “With Brother Clearcloud holding down the fort in South Qi Giant City, this Feng’s heart can finally be set at ease! These few years, South Qi Giant City’s losses have been too heavy. Subsequently, we finally have time to hide our capabilities and bide our time!”

An unprecedented great victory also let Feng Xiaotian breathe a sigh of relief.

He knew that a brief period of peace had finally arrived. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

During these few centuries, South Qi Giant City had never relaxed for a moment.

The blood race’s attacks continued uninterruptedly, not giving them any chance to catch their breath at all.

Otherwise, South Qi Giant City also would not have been so arduous. Li Clearcloud also nodded and said, “Little Tian has fought hard repeatedly. I believe that you have considerable harvests too. This time, you can go into a closed-seclusion and attempt to assault the Hegemon Realm! We desperately need a Hegemon Realm now!’

Feng Xiaotian smiled bitterly and said, “I’m ashamed to speak of it, but while there were some gains, I still ... don’t have a clue with regards to the Hegemon Realm!”

Others were trapped for tens of thousands of years, or hundreds of thousands of years in front of this hurdle. Just how long did he take to assault the Hegemon Realm?

Right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly said, “Brother Feng, Eldest Senior Brother, I feel that ... now isn’t the time to rest yet!”

Li Clearcloud frowned and said, “Little Junior Brother, what do you mean?”

Ye Yuan said, “Now that Heaven One had a great victory, Giant Net City is empty. It’s precisely the perfect opportunity for us to strike! If we miss it this time, I’m afraid ... there won’t be an opportunity like this anymore!”

“Hiss ...”

The Emperor Realm powerhouses present all sucked in a breath of cold air.

This big shot’s words were really hell-bent on shocking people to death!

Taking the initiative to attack!

It had been several thousand years. This was something that the Heaven One Alliance had never thought of!

But it came out of Ye Yuan’s mouth!

Feng Xiaotian’s pupils constricted, greatly stirred. But very soon, he suppressed this impulse.

It was too risky!

Li Clearcloud frowned and said, “Little Junior Brother, I know that you’ve rendered a contribution without equal, but aren’t you being too overambitious and unrealistic by wanting to take the initiative to attack? It’s true that we won a fight, but the blood race isn’t some random Tom, Dick, or Harry that can be casually kneaded! The Heaven One Alliance can’t afford to mess around anymore!”

These words were already somewhat heavy.

But the people present all thought so. It was just that these words were more appropriate for Li Clearcloud to say.

This time, the various major sects had virtually swarmed out in full force.

These people were the final elites of the sect!

If these people suffered losses, Heaven One would really not be able to resist anymore.

Furthermore, the blood race’s terror was already deeply rooted in people’s hearts.

Even a powerhouse like Li Clearcloud was extremely apprehensive of them too.

For thousands of years, they had always been in a situation of being passively beaten.

Taking the initiative to attack?

You have got to be kidding!

The blood race could afford to lose, but we could not bear the loss!

Ye Yuan was indifferent as he said coolly, “In order to kill Hegemon Edgeless, Hegemon Youjin is also seriously injured! At this moment, he’s at Giant Net City! Giant Net City’s true elites have already been slaughtered by me! Those remaining are nothing to fear! After a series of great battles, Giant Net City’s Emperor Realms have suffered heavy losses too! Now, with Eldest Senior Brother holding down the fort, we have new forces joining too! The blood race totally won’t expect that we will launch a surprise attack on Giant Net City! If we’re lucky, it’s also not impossible for us to kill Hegemon Youjin too! Eldest Senior Brother, the opportunity can’t be missed. An opportunity missed won’t come again!”

Slay Hegemon You Jin!

These words made everyone palpitate with excitement to do it.

That was a Hegemon Realm!

If they killed a blood race Hegemon Realm, that would be a contribution without equal!

But could this really work?

The Heaven One Alliance had not gone out of the Absolute Heaven Barrier for several thousand years ago.

This resulted in everyone having an instinctively fear of beyond the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

But Ye Yuan’s analysis still moved them immensely.

They knew that Ye Yuan was the Blood Divine Son. He knew the situation of the blood race very well.

Do it or not?

“Why don’t ... we ask Divine Lord His Excellency for instructions?” Li Clearcloud said hesitantly.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Divine Lord won’t agree! This is the last of Heaven One’s cards. He won’t take this risk! But this risk is worth taking! Furthermore, the blood race won’t give us much time! Giant Net City is extremely important to the blood race too. They will definitely mobilize forces to replenish the lack of troops over here! We can only seize this time interval! Eldest Senior Brother, Brother Feng, if we don’t kill a Hegemon, our victory is completely meaningless! So what if there are ten years to catch our breaths? It’s merely eking out a meager existence! After ten days, the blood race will still stage a comeback! The chance to kill You Jin is only this one time! If we miss it, it will really slip by!”
