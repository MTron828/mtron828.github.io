Chapter 2331: Conferred the Status of an Ancestor!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, the stream of people were as many as schools of carps crossing the river, countless alchemy path powerhouses gathering from all directions.

On the day of the sermon, the noise and shouting were in great commotion.

A million alchemy path powerhouses gathered in Heavenly Eagle. It was a grand sight to behold.

Of course, this was just a very small part.

Even more alchemy path powerhouses were still on the way.

Ye Yuan was dressed in ceremonial clothes, sitting suspended on top of an enormous Tai Chi diagram. His eyes were shut closed, resting his mind.

An aura of Great Dao filled the entire space.

“That’s Second Sage’s Dao? Indeed extensive and profound! Just one look and I feel that it’s unfathomable!”

“Legends has it that Second Sage is already the alchemy path’s number one person! I didn’t expect that he’s actually going to spread his Dao to all life! Blessing all ages, truly a saint!”

“Us small fries really have a huge lucky chance this time.”

... ...

To the vast majority of alchemy path powerhouses, they did not know what it was at all.

Alchemy was just refining pills.

Only a handful of people could enter Dao.

But Ye Yuan hosting a sermon and spreading Dao would be a massive lucky chance to these people.

Normally, forget about Ye Yuan, even a Seven-star Alchemy God was also an existence that they could not touch.

But today, Ye Yuan’s actions would benefit the world!

Sacred Ancestor High Priest and his disciples, as well as a group of progenitors, were currently shockingly present, listening to Ye Yuan spread Dao.

These few days, Wing and Ye Yuan compete in alchemy many times, being equally matched.

While he benefited immensely!

Ye Yuan’s Dao was different from Medicine Ancestor. Medicine Ancestor’s Dao was unparalleledly tyrannical and overbearing.

Alchemy path powerhouses who had fought against him before, it was hard for their Dao hearts to inevitably lose balance. Wing was a victim of it.

Ye Yuan’s Dao was even and calm, exhibiting a majestic atmosphere.

Debating on Dao with Ye Yuan, Wing unknowingly actually recovered his own Dao heart, his strength advancing by leaps and bounds!

However, debating on Dao was one thing. That was just some small exchanges.

While today, Ye Yuan spreading Dao, that was elaborating his Dao teachings. It was the demonstration of the essence of his Great Dao.

This action absolutely held extraordinary meaning to progenitor level, and to those old fellows who had been stuck before Dao pill for countless years.

Ye Yuan slowly opened his eyes and started preaching on Dao.

“My Dao is not another path. Spreading Dao today, it’s to open up your Dao hearts.”

“A myriad Great Daos, Alchemy Dao is a special path.”

“What is Alchemy Dao? One pill, one world!”

“Then today, we’ll start with Divine Essence Pill ...”

... ...

Following Ye Yuan talking tirelessly, below burst into an uproar.

Divine Essence Pill!

The alchemy path’s number one powerhouse was actually talking about the Divine Essence Pill!

What was the Divine Essence Pill?

That was a rank one divine pill, the most basic divine pill!

This level of medicinal pills, they could refine a large bunch with a wave of a hand.

That was a medicinal pill that was given to rookies who just entered Deity Realm to eat!

My pants were already taken off, you’re making me look at this?

For a moment, dissatisfaction, contempt, spurn, and cursing sounded out all around.

High-sounding words, this was simply duping people!

Wing’s brows furrowed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Quiet! If there are any more noisemakers, die!”

An astonishing aura instantly covered the whole place.

Once a Deva Fourth Blight was enraged, it was not what they could withstand.

Immediately, it became quiet.

Wing gave a cold snort and said, “Ye Yuan preaching on Dao, this is the fortune of your lifetimes! Listen carefully, even if you just comprehend a fraction, it’s also enough for you all to benefit for life!”

Even though everyone did not dare to speak up due to Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s power, they were still disdainful.

Divine Essence Pill this sort of thing, what was nice to listen?

Toward these commotions, Ye Yuan did not care at all.

His time was limited. However much could be comprehended, it could only depend on these people themselves.

Although the Divine Essence Pill was shallow, it was the foundation of Great Dao.

Now that he had climbed to the summit, turning back to look at this kind of medicinal pill again, his opinion was naturally different.

The current Ye Yuan could casually refine rank one divine pills that were 100 times stronger than the Divine Essence Pill.

But why did he start with the Divine Essence Pill?

The Divine Essence Pill was a pill formula that had been handed down from ancient times. After countless years of baptism, it was a pill formula that had been tempered endlessly.

Even though the medicinal pill was simple, it contained the maxim of Great Dao!

Gradually, the expression on everyone’s face changed.

The original disdain, ridicule, conceit, turned into the current shock, admiration, and absorbed in thought.

Only now did they know that turns out a tiny little Divine Essence Pill actually contained so many truths!

The things that Ye Yuan talked about, they had never thought about them before.

He refined a Divine Essence Pill in front of everyone.

Each step, he analyzed deeply, demonstrating his own Dao little by little.

A tiny little Tai Chi diagram formed in the void.

Everyone’s expressions became incomparably shocked.

But among them, someone’s shock was greater than the others.

This person was Sacred Ancestor High Priest!

“It turns out that this is his Dao! A tiny little Divine Essence Pill actually hides such a great Dao! Rank one divine pills, we already overlooked such pills much. Then what about rank two divine pills, rank five divine pills, rank eight divine pills?”

“Many geniuses are all rootless weeds. They seemed powerful but were no use at all despite looking good. But his strength is a strength that has been tempered endlessly!”

“We have been searching for the fleeting and ephemeral Dao, but he has been focusing on every tiny bit! By now, he already became a sea!”

“I finally understand what the two races’ Dao is missing!”

Of the people present, Wing was closest to Dao.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s spreading of Dao, his thoughts and feelings were the deepest.

Their Dao had indeed built a 100 thousand foot building.

But their 100 thousand foot buildings lacked bricks and tiles. The buildings were full of holes.

Such a building, the higher one built, the more dangerous it was! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Therefore, his Dao failed in front of Medicine Ancestor, and he also lost himself.

But, even if Ye Yuan was defeated, he was the victor too!

Because his Dao was too stable!

Although the other progenitors did not feel as strongly as Wing, they also benefited a lot.

Following that, Ye Yuan gradually developed the entire system of rank one divine pills with the Divine Essence Pill as the foundation.

Only then did everyone discover that turns out among all the rank one divine pills, there existed all kinds of connections.

The shock in everyone’s hearts grew stronger and stronger!

Ye Yuan provided for them a brand new perspective. This was the perspective of God!

They were currently standing at the perspective of God, re-examining rank one divine pills.

Finding everything fresh and new!

Being filled with wisdom!

Enlightening the benighted!

They were more and more unable to describe their current feelings anymore.

What Ye Yuan exhibited for them was a brand new alchemy path cultivation system!

If in the past, Alchemy Dao relied on inheritances.

Today, Ye Yuan’s alchemy path was the great accomplishment of everyone gathering there!

This was a complete, brand new cultivation system that could stand up to scrutiny and could create countless alchemy path powerhouses!

Just like that, from rank one to rank two, all the way to rank eight divine pills.

Ye Yuan expounded his cultivation system little by little, spreading his Dao, clearly displaying the sequence of ideas in front of everyone.

Many people still thought that it was simple at first. But later, they could not understand at all anymore.

The further back, the more obscure and difficult it was to understand.

The one-year period arrived in a blink.

That moment when Ye Yuan stopped preaching on Dao, the tens of millions of powerhouses present were silent.

Wing’s gaze was deep and suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Today, Ye Yuan will be conferred the status of an ancestor!”
