Chapter 1472 Narrow escape!

Behind the fiend army, the tidewater-like human army arrived with a roar.

The addition of the reinforcements made the already almost collapsing fiend army thoroughly lose the last trace of hope.

The moment the human army charged, the fiend army immediately fell to pieces.

A siege battle played out into a one-sided slaughter.

Day after day of fierce battles, the fiend race had long reached the brink of collapse.

With the addition of reinforcements at this time again, they were directly routed.

On top of the city walls, Xiu Lie’s gaze revealed a look of despair when he saw the earth-shaking battle-cry.

He knew that these 30 thousand troops were considered to have thoroughly fallen here!

“Xiu Lie, offer up your life!”

Right then, a figure tore through the air and arrived, heading straight for Xiu Lie.

When Wang Yifeng saw the arrival, he said with a look of pleasant surprise, “Lord Wu Tianxiang!”

He had long been an arrow at the end of its flight under Xiu Lie’s strong attack, looking as if he was about to lose.

Wu Tianxiang suddenly arriving finally let him heave a sigh of relief.

This Wu Tianxiang was precisely Kangding City’s defending army’s great general, a half-step Divine Lord expert!

The current Wu Tianxiang had a soaring momentum, while Xiu Lie was already severely wounded. The two people’s strengths were not on the same level at all.

One exchange and Xiu Lie was suppressed in all aspects.

In the army, Ling Feng finally let out a long sigh in relief.

These few days, he sprinted madly day and night, finally bringing the reinforcements in the nick of time!

Otherwise, the outcome would be too ghastly to imagine!

After being saved at the natural chasm, Ye Yuan had him go to Kangding City to request for reinforcements.

At that time, Ling Feng felt that it was definitely too late. But Ye Yuan insisted on making him go over, saying that they would definitely make it.

He did not expect that they really made it!

But seeing the desolation of the battle situation here, even Ling Feng could not help being greatly moved too.

The defending army on the city walls did not look like much, so how did they resist this 30 thousand fiend army?

One had to know, the northern city’s defenses could not compare to the southern city’s. All kinds of fortifications completely could not compare.

Under the situation where the numbers were extremely disadvantaged, they actually persisted for so long!

Suddenly, Ling Feng recalled Ye Yuan’s calm and composed face, and could not help being startled inwardly.

“Could it be ... Ye Yuan’s work? Impossible! He’s just one person, how can he possibly resist the fiend race’s 30 thousand troops?”

Suddenly, his gaze flitted to those destroyed fiend crossbows, and he could not help being greatly surprised.

Very clearly, it was impossible for the guards in the army to rush out to destroy the fiend crossbows!

Then, who ruined the fiend crossbows?

It could not be that the fiend soldiers themselves broke it, right?!

Could it ... really be Ye Yuan?

Ling Feng drew a cold breath. The more he thought, the more likely this was!

He surveyed the surroundings, but could not see Ye Yuan’s figure at all.

Kangding City’s army was like a bulldozer, directly charging over from the center of the fiend army!

At this time, Tiderain City already did not need to shut the city gates tightly anymore. After Wang Yifeng withdrew, he ordered people to directly open the city gates, welcoming Kangding City’s army.

“Leave 5000 people behind, the rest will all rush to the southern city and defend Tiderain City to the death!” In midair, Wu Tianxiang said in a clear voice.

With Kangding City’s army massacring them in one round, the fiend army was only left with several thousand people already.

Leaving behind 5000 people plus the northern city’s defending army, it was sufficient to clear up the mess.

At the southern city’s side, they were still bombarding indiscriminately, both sides fighting until the sky and earth dimmed.

The fiend army over there was seriously too many; unable to kill finish at all.

“Xiu Lie, prepare to die! Today, you stumbled right into a trap! Don’t blame this general for not being courteous!” Wu Tianxiang laughed loudly and said.

Xiu Lie’s aura became weaker and weaker, looking as if he was about to be defeated.

He snorted coldly and said, “Want to kill me? You dream on! Heavenly Fiend Blood Escape Grand Release!”

Suddenly, Xiu Lie’s entire body burst apart. A cloud of blood mist wrapped around the fiend soul, instantly flying out several miles away.

Wu Tianxiang’s expression changed, not expecting that Xiu Lie still had such a card to play.

But Xiu Lie’s blood escape’s speed was too fast. With his movement technique, he could not catch up at all.

Looking in the direction Xiu Lie escaped, Wu Tianxiang heaved a long sigh and said, “Such a pity! Let that fellow escape. In the future, we probably can’t dispense with going through a lot of trouble!”

A fiend infiltrating into the human race’s central region. Furthermore, it was a half-stop Divine Lord Realm powerful existence.

How the consequences would be was really hard to say.

Wang Yifeng went up to greet at this time, saying with clasped hands, “Lord Tianxiang, the people we sent out were all killed by the fiends, how did you get the news? I even thought that we were dead for sure this time!”

Wu Tianxiang froze and said, “Wasn’t Ling Feng sent by you?”

Wang Yifeng was stunned too and said, “Ling Feng? This name is so familiar ... uh, I remember now. Didn’t he go to spy on the military movements? It’s actually him! This kid really made a huge contribution this time!”

Ling Feng failed to return after a long time, Wang Yifeng even thought that he had long died at the fiend race’s hands.

After all, with his strength, the likelihood of being discovered by the fiend race was very high.

Of course, those soldiers who came back said that there was still a person together with Ling Feng. But he was just at the initial-stage Heaven Glimpse Realm and could not play any part. He did not pay attention anymore.

He did not expect that it was actually Ling Feng who went to ask for reinforcements.

This contribution was really too big!

...

Southern City, Guo Changmin stood proudly on top of the city walls and said in a clear voice, “Sandcliff, your scheme has already fallen through! The 30 thousand fiend troops that came over from Fiend Calling Ridge’s natural chasm have already been completely annihilated. Xiu Lie has already been executed! Kangding City reinforcements have already arrived. Do you all ... still want to continue fighting?”

Sandcliff’s expression changed greatly and he said with an astonished look, “Impossible! Fiend Calling Ridge that side prepared 100 thousand troops, how can it possibly be just 30 thousand?”

This conclusion was seriously too beyond his expectations.

Even if the intel was leaked, how could 100 thousand troops possibly become 30 thousand?

But, looking at the densely packed reinforcements on the top of the city walls, it was not up to him to not believe!

The northern city’s fiend army was probably really completely annihilated already!

Sandcliff was currently depressed until he wanted to vomit blood. Just what went wrong with the originally seamless plan?

Several decades of preparations actually concluded in such a crushing defeat, how would he give an account to the higher-ups when he went back?

He lost over half this time, looking like he was about to knock open the southern city’s gates, but the reinforcements suddenly arrived, directly making his many days of making it through bloody battle turn into zilch.

This campaign was simply defeated incomprehensibly.

Sandcliff did not know that his words made Guo Changmin get a huge shock too!

Fiend Calling Ridge that side actually had 100 thousand fiend troops!

He believed that Sandcliff absolutely would not lie to him at this time.

Then, where did the other 70 thousand troops go?

If 100 thousand fiend troops all came over, even if he was long prepared, the northern city would have long been captured too!

Several thousand people against 100 thousand people, the conclusion had no suspense at all.

This war was truly won too by a fluke, won too bafflingly!

As if there was an invisible large hand helping them at the back.

Guo Changmin forcefully pressed down the astonishment in his heart and said indifferently, “Maybe those 70 thousand fiends had long fallen into the natural chasm! Sandcliff, if you want to keep fighting, this Guo will accompany you to the end!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The expression on Sandcliff’s face was exceedingly ugly. Struggling for a long time, he finally gritted his teeth and said, “Whole army, listen up! Withdraw!”

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

On top of the city walls came all of the defending army’s crazed cheers!
