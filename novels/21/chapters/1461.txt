Chapter 1465 A Genius“s Thoughts

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

...

Each and every one of the fiend race powerhouses moved like lightning, dashing towards the place where Ye Yuan dup originally stood. They saw the back view of the two people jumping off the cliff.

Xiu Lie’s face was extremely grim and said, “Just two initial-stage Heaven Glimpse? How did he finish off five squads without a sound?”

“Your Excellency, they ... probably still have other people? Two measly human Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artists, even if their strength is powerful, it’s also impossible to make five squads completely wiped out,” a subordinate said.

Xiu Lie nodded his head and heaved a sigh as he said, “Looks like ... our side here is already exposed. It’s already impossible to want to swoop down on Tiderain City. Our 10 years of effort is ruined overnight!”

The others were similarly incomparably disappointed. They were originally very much looking forward to this battle. Who knew that news actually leaked at the eleventh hour, this made their military exploits be wiped out in a day.

What they did not know was that they were actually very close to success.

It was just too bad that Ye Yuan just happened to lose his way and came to this area, and even ran into the five squads who were patrolling.

Otherwise, with Ling Feng their strength, how could they possibly send the intel back?

“Notify Sandcliff’s side, and just say that the surprise army appearing out of nowhere on this side already lost effectiveness. We can only join forces to attack fiercely,” Xiu Lie said solemnly.

He shot a glance at the natural chasm that was deep until the bottom could not be seen and said with a cold snort, “Those two punks got off lucky!”

...

After Ye Yuan duo jumped off the cliff, their bodies plummeted at a terrifying speed.

That speed was more than ten times faster than when they fell normally.

The terrifying gravitational field even made them unable to adjust their falling down posture. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ling Feng already despaired. He felt that his body would be destroyed by this huge gravitational field before he even reached the bottom.

The further down, the greater this gravitational field’s force, and the faster the speed. Ling Feng felt like the blood vessels in his whole body were about to burst.

It was just that under this kind of circumstances, he could not even accomplish crying out.

Suddenly, Ling Feng’s expression changed. His falling speed was actually slowing down. The effect of the gravitational field on him was actually reducing!

This shock was by no means insignificant!

This natural chasm, the further down, the more terrifying the gravitational field. It was not what human strength could contend with at all.

Ling Feng knew that there had once been a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse who attempted to find out about this natural chasm’s situation. But he never came back.

Ever since then, no one else dared to have ideas about this natural chasm.

Ling Feng turned out and took a look at Ye Yuan, his gaze full of an incredulous look.

Ye Yuan’s eyes were tightly shut, his body emitting a strange forcefield.

Ling Feng did not notice it previously. Only now did he abruptly startled awake. This strange forcefield was currently becoming stronger at a rapid rate!

And this forcefield was clearly what made their falling speed slow down.

Ling Feng suddenly felt like the forcefield around them was like a spring. The further down, the stronger the forcefield.

Finally, the two people’s figures abruptly stopped, suspending in midair!

Ling Feng looked at Ye Yuan with an astonished look and said, “You ... How did you do it?”

Ye Yuan’s mind stirred, a wooden stick appeared in his hand. It was precisely the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood!

“There is a strange forcefield inside this natural chasm. It’s a great supplement to my Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood. The further down, the stronger this forcefield, and the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood is growing crazily. And now, it finally reached a state of equilibrium,” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

Ye Yuan’s Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood was constantly brought along on him. But it had always been stuck at peak Tier 9 and did not break through to divine rank.

Encountering this strange gravitational field this time, it was an opportunity for the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood.

Originally, Ye Yuan was planning on finding a chance to come over and let the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood absorb the magnetic force to evolve.

It was just that the plan could not keep up with the changes. He did not expect that they were actually discovered so quickly.

Driven to the wall, Ye Yuan could only take the risk and try, jumping straight into this natural chasm.

Sure enough, the forcefield here did not disappoint him.

The further down, the faster the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood’s evolution.

In this short while, the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood actually directly broke through two ranks under this terrifying force field, reaching the level of divine rank two!

Ling Feng looked at the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood, shocked until he could not close his mouth.

His back was drenched in a cold sweat. He looked at Ye Yuan with a strange look and said, “You ... You’re using the natural chasm’s gravitational field to evolve the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood?”

He was not really afraid earlier. But looking back now, Ling Feng felt like his legs turned soft.

What if the evolution failed, wouldn’t the two of them have to shatter to pieces?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Under that sort of situation, did we still have other choices? The one coming over earlier was a half-step Divine Lord fiend race powerhouse!”

Ling Feng opened his mouth and stopped talking.

Indeed, this was the best way.

Most importantly, they won the gamble!

However, this guy in front of him looked young, without the slightest experience. But when doing things, he was really crazy!

Perhaps it was precisely because of so that he would think of joining the human race army, right?

“But ... even if you have the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood, how did you do it?” Ling Feng said in surprise.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “When I saw the fiend race’s flying boat earlier, I was thinking about this problem. This natural chasm’s gravitational field is so strong, for them to be able to overcome the natural chasm, they definitely made use of this gravitational field! So I was thinking, if I created a gravitational field too, I can use this gravitational field to produce a repulsive force or not, and I’ll be able to suspend in the air! Heh, trying it out, it’s indeed like so! Presumably, aboard the fiend race’s flying boat, they definitely created a gravitational field too, that’s how it let them be able to fly across the natural chasm!”

Ling Feng stared with his mouth agape from listening. This guy was simply a genius!

The fiend race used no idea how many years before coming up with this method. But it was cracked by Ye Yuan in a second.

It was simple to say, but achieving it was absolutely not an easy thing.

This natural chasm’s gravitational field was too strong. Wanting to neutralize this forcefield could not be accomplished by casually creating a flying boat with a forcefield.

A little bit off and it could only be the outcome of the boat being destroyed and people perishing in the end.

If not for so, the fiend race also would not use so many years to research such a small-scale flying boat.

For Ye Yuan to be able to do this was because his control over the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood had long reached the degree of superlative heights already.

During the process of falling, Ye Yuan had been adjusting the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood’s gravitational field all along, attempting to reach a state of equilibrium with the natural chasm’s gravitational field.

In-between this, the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood was still evolving crazily. To be able to achieve this in a short several breaths of time was simply inconceivable.

Seeing Ling Feng’s expression, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Come on, it’s getting late. Let’s circumvent this section before going up, don’t walk right into the trap. Oh, right, Captain Ling, this matter of the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood, hope that Captain Ling keeps it secret for me.”

Ling Feng froze and immediately nodded his head.

This Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood evolving to divine rank two was a rather powerful treasure. It could even become one of Ye Yuan’s trump cards.

This kind of thing, Ye Yuan was naturally unwilling to let others know.

He and Ye Yuan were just casual acquaintances and were not considered to have a very deep friendship. For Ye Yuan to willingly save his life was already not easy.

After all, under this kind of circumstances, an additional person was an additional point of risk.
