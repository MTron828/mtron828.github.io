Chapter 1634 Full of Cunning Tricks

ye yuan obtained the origin magnetism spirit wood for already so many years. he had long already fused into becoming one with it, no distinctions between each other.

using it as a bridge to communicate with the origin magnetic divine mountain at this time went very smoothly.

the origin magnetism spirit wood and origin magnetic divine mountain originated from the same source. it could be said to be from the same root. there naturally wasn’t that much aversion towards ye yuan.

under the three people’s astonished gazes, ye yuan slowly walked out once more, heading toward the origin magnetic divine mountain.

“why is such a powerful origin magnetic field totally useless against him?” song yu said in shock.

“the origin magnetic field actually lost effectiveness! what in the world did he do just now?” ka suo also said in shock.

lei yi had sharp eyes as he exclaimed, “you guys look above the origin magnetic divine mountain! that’s ... origin magnetism spirit wood!”

when the three people saw the origin magnetism spirit wood, they could not help coming to a realization, finally knowing why ye yuan could come and go freely under the cover of the origin magnetic divine mountain.

origin magnetism law was a kind of very rare and unique law. the people that could comprehend it were extremely, extremely few.

people as strong as the song yu trio could only release world power to resist the heavy pressure of the origin magnetic field too.

but ye yuan, he could utilize origin magnetism law to neutralize the origin magnetic field!

“damn it! this boy’s luck is also too heaven-defying. not only did he comprehend spatial laws, but there’s also actually even origin magnetism spirit wood, this kind of supreme treasure!” ka suo howled.

ye yuan’s luck made him envious and jealous.

amidst the three people’s complicated gazes, ye yuan slowly came in front of the origin magnetic divine mountain.

the origin magnetic divine mountain was black all over, the height of three people; very thick and strong. ten people could not wrap their arms around it too.

ye yuan’s hand lightly put on the origin magnetism spirit wood, pouring divine essence inside, and started refining the origin magnetic divine mountain.

but right at this time, song yu and lei yi exchanged a glance, suddenly revealing a vicious look.

ka suo was an old monster who had lived for a million years, he immediately detected something amiss.

swoosh!

swoosh!

two figures tore through the wind and arrived, rushing over toward him.

ka suo’s figure dodged bizarrely, avoiding the two people’s attacks.

“heh, you humans are indeed all treacherous people!” ka suo said with a cold laugh.

song yu sneered and said, “the fiend race is cruel and savage, butchering living things! what trust is there to talk about with you, an aberrant lifeform?”

lei yi nodded and said, “no need to be long-winded with him, kill him!”

ka suo laughed loudly and said, “want to kill this seat, you guys are still a bit inexperienced!”

at that time, in order to acquire the origin magnetic divine mountain, none of the three wanted to overly expend energy, so that was why it formed a delicate agreement.

now, looking as the origin magnetic divine mountain was being taken by ye yuan into his bag, the balance between them was naturally broken.

even though lei yi was an itinerant cultivator, humans and fiends were mortal enemies. now that there was a chance to kill ka suo, he naturally would not hesitate.

moreover, ka suo, this kind of old monster who had lived for a million years, there was definitely quite a number of good stuff on him.

killing him could also make up for the deficit this time.

as for ye yuan, they already gave up.

he and song yu both understood, their current states could not kill ye yuan at all.

hence, they set the target on ka suo.

if he was at his peak state, ka suo naturally did not fear the two. but at this time, it was still rather taxing for him to face the two people’s joint forces.

“old devil ka suo, finishing you off, eminent orchid imperial city will be considered to have lost an arm too! today, you just remain behind here!” song yu said with a cold smile.

song yu had long consumed some medicinal pills and forcefully suppressed his injuries. breaking out into fierce fighting at this time, he did not hold back in the slightest too.

“damn it! song yu punk, today’s grudge, this old man has remembered it!”

ka suo retreated as he fought, retreating towards the outside of the canyon.

very soon, the three people disappeared, only leaving behind ye yuan alone refining the origin magnetic divine mountain.

...

outside the canyon, a group of people were unable to return above and could only quietly wait for the result.

heavenly eagle imperial city’s side was filled with sorrow. ye yuan’s demise was a tremendous blow to them.

suddenly, zheng qi’s gaze turned intent, sweeping over towards the depths of the canyon.

a figure was currently fleeing over here in a fluster. who was it if not gao yuan?

zheng qi’s stomach full of rage was just unable to give vent. seeing gao yuan, he finally found an opening to vent.

his figure swept away, directly receiving him.

“old fogey! today, let’s settle old scores and new together, die!”

zheng qi shouted loudly, wielding his sword and advancing.

gao yuan was currently in a state of trepidation, afraid of those three people chasing after. but he did not expect that there was a tiger at the back, a wolf in front. at this time, he was blocked head-on by zheng qi. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“zheng qi, this old man isn’t free to mess around with you right now! get lost for this seat!” gao yuan said in a great rage.

today was gao yuan’s most aggrieved day.

he thought that he calculated everything. so he did not expect to be defeated at the hands of an origin deity realm brat.

inside mystic realms, it had always been him scamming people. when had he been scammed by people before?

but this time, starting from the fiend calling ridge, he was scammed all the way, all the way until being scammed by ye yuan in the end, even almost dying under the joint attacks of three great celestial deity powerhouses.

now, even zheng qi this small fry dared to bully him.

how could zheng qi give way? he saw that gao yuan was seriously injured, it was precisely the best timing to take revenge. it was naturally impossible to let the other party go.

at this time, utmost peace imperial city still had some people remaining. when they saw that gao yuan was being stopped, they immediately wanted to take action and help.

but heavenly eagle imperial city was currently the group of people being in the best state. how could they let these people go over?

heavenly eagle imperial city’s people immediately surrounded them in the center. ning tianping smiled coldly and said, “this is the enmity between them. i want see who dares to make a move!”

utmost peace imperial city’s people already lost more than half along the way. right now, these people’s bodies were also carrying injuries.

at this time, heavenly eagle imperial city’s powerhouses were simply like a group of fierce tigers, while the opposite was a group of sickly cats. once they fought, there was not the slightest bit of suspense at all.

ning tianping secretly sighed in his heart. if not for elder ye, they probably could not even accomplish blocking the adversary currently, right?

but sadly, a genius of his generation actually perished just like this.

that side, zheng qi completely had a fighting style without heed for his life, each move not leaving the vitals.

under serious injuries, how could gao yuan still be a match, shouting in anxiety?

“zheng qi, are you crazy? if you dare to kill me, utmost peace imperial city will never rest until you guys are dead!”

“the matter back then can’t blame me at all, it was all wu xingtang himself who was greedy, that was why he lost his life!”

“zheng qi, i was wrong, okay? let’s shake hands and make up!”

gao yuan cried weirdly, finally even yielding and begging for mercy. but zheng qi turned a deaf ear to it.

zheng qi was not a fool either, such a fine opportunity, once he missed it, he had to wait for god knows how many years!

today, he must kill the other party!

seeing that zheng qi listened neither to reason nor bowed to force, gao yuan cried out, “zheng qi, what are you risking your life so desperately for? ye yuan that boy isn’t dead. if you have the time to waste with me here, why haven’t you hurry up to go save him?!”

zheng qi’s face that was calm was finally visibly moved.

he stopped the sword in his hand and said in a cold voice, “what did you say?!”

not just him, heavenly eagle imperial city’s everyone was all stunned.

they saw ye yuan being killed by ka suo with their own eyes, how could he possibly not die?

gao yuan said, “i initially also thought that ye yuan this punk died. who knew that he didn’t die and even sneaked inside. but now, he’s being besieged by three great celestial deity powerhouses, his life and death are unknown. you still have the time to waste here with me?”
