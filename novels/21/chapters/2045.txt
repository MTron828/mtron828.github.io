Chapter 2049: Sea of Law

“Turns out it’s like this! Turns out that it’s like this!”

In the crowd, Lin Tong’s eyes became brighter and brighter. It was as if clouds and mist were scattering away in the dark night, with stars lighting up.

Listening attentively for a day and night, he suddenly saw the light like pushing away the clouds to see the moon.

The confusion in the past was cleared away by Ye Yuan little by little.

Lin Tong gradually discovered that Grandmaster Ye’s sermon was totally different from Empyrean Pilljade’s.

The things that Empyrean Pilljade talked about were vague and insubstantial. After listening, one would feel that it was very impressive. But after carefully experiencing it, they would discover that it could not be understood at all.

But the things that Grandmaster Ye talked about seemed to be tailor-made for him.

Where the Dao was, the meaning could be understood, but it could not be expressed with words.

No matter how high the realm, how powerful the strength was, if the things expressed were not correct, others could not understand at all either.

And Ye Yuan was just like a teacher who was well-versed in teaching methods, analyzing Alchemy Dao with penetrating criticism.

Especially to these bottom-level alchemists, it was even more beneficial.

Regarding preaching on the Dao, Ye Yuan did not do anything if he was not preaching, but as long as he began lecturing, he would prepare seriously.

Since those that came to listen to the lecture were mostly initial-stage and middle-stage Initial Realm alchemists, the content that he talked about was targeted at this demographic.

To the current Ye Yuan, this kind of content was very simple and easy to understand. Expressing it was naturally very smooth too.

But when others listened, it was like Great Dao Heavenly Melody, being filled with wisdom.

The aura on Lin Tong’s body got stronger and stronger. A mysterious aura of Dao gradually descended upon his body.

“Mn? Hang on, what a mysterious aura! This ... What’s going on here?”

Lin Tong was greatly alarmed in his heart because he felt that the surrounding law undulations were too powerful.

He currently felt like the sky had fallen.

Boundless power of law surrounded him. It was like he fell into the ocean of Alchemy Dao.

Beyond the surprise, Lin Tong was more wildly elated. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Seeing such vast Alchemy Dao law was like entering a treasure mountain to him, so how could he return empty-handed?

Hence, he frenziedly wanted to collect these Alchemy Dao laws!

Lin Tong listened very attentively. He did not discover at all that the current Tianyue Plaza scattered out with Ye Yuan as the center, and was already densely packed full of figures.

This was an ocean of several hundreds of thousands of people!

And among these people, there were many people who were the same as Lin Tong, all stuck at one point for many years, being unable to advance an inch.

During this period of several days’ time, many people’s realms that did not move for many years finally broke through the shackles after listening to Ye Yuan’s sermon.

The plaza where Empyrean Pilljade was at did not have a single figure anymore.

He also stopped preaching and entered meditation.

But at this time, his two eyes suddenly snapped out, shooting out rays of brilliant light, gaze staring fixedly at the southwest corner.

A boundless and vast power of law descended from the sky, enveloping the entire Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.

Even separated so far away, Empyrean Pilljade also vividly felt that boundlessness.

This vast power of law was extremely horrifying. Even when he broke through to the Ancestor Realm back then, it was also just a drop in the ocean compared to this.

“This ... This is the Sea of Law descending?” Empyrean Pilljade said in astonishment.

Suddenly, his figure moved, vanishing from where he was.

At the east side of the great imperial capital, the plaza in front of Empyrean Flutterfeather was similarly stark empty.

Suddenly, his eyes went wide, looking in the southwest direction with an astonished face.

“This is ...”

Empyrean Flutterfeather muttered a sentence under his breath, his figure moving, immediately disappearing from where he was.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

The grandmasters’ figure virtually all disappeared at the same time.

It was not just them. How could the Seven-star Alchemy Gods in the city not sense this vast power of law? All of them hurried over toward Tianyue Plaza.

“Flutterfeather, I’m afraid that this child ... isn’t what your Myriad Treasure Tower can contain!” Empyrean Pilljade said calmly without even turning his head.

Although his words were calm, the shock in his eyes could not be concealed no matter what.

Empyrean Flutterfeather smiled bitterly in his heart, but his face was calm as he said, “That doesn’t need Brother Pilljade to worry about.”

Empyrean Pilljade gave a cold snort and stopped speaking.

“This ... This is Sea of Law! Alchemy Dao’s Sea of Law! I didn’t expect that this Empyrean can actually see this extraordinary view in my remaining years! The realms of hundreds of thousands of people more or less had advancements and triggered Heavenly Dao, bringing down the Sea of Law! This kind of grand occasion is likely hard to come across once in ten million years too, right?” Empyrean Windrider said with vicissitudes of emotion.

“Grandmaster Ye is well-deserving of the title of grandmaster. Previously, we actually even doubted his strength. Looking at it now, our title of grandmaster fails to live up to the title in front of him!” Empyrean Lumen shook his head and said with a bitter smile.

“No wonder Grandmaster Ye can attract a full turnout of the city. His understanding of Alchemy Dao is much deeper than us!”

The moment these words came out, the group of Empyrean secretly nodded.

They only came here a short while. But just this short while, the things that Ye Yuan talked about, even they also felt endlessly beneficial.

The content was superficial content.

But the depth of Ye Yuan’s understanding was completely not what they could compare to.

In comparison, their understanding of Initial Realm somewhat had the meaning of lapping up information without digesting it.

An Empyrean shook his head and said, “This kind of grand occasion, probably only the Medicine Ancestor and that demon race’s Sacred Ancestor can trigger it. It’s just that with their identities, why would they preach on the Dao to these ordinary alchemists?”

“Stop talking nonsense, the Sea of Law descending is a massive lucky chance for us as well! Comprehend it well!” Empyrean Pilljade said in a solemn voice.

Sea of Law, as the name suggested, was an ocean of law.

How vast was Alchemy Dao? It was hard to understand one-ten-thousandth of it in a lifetime too.

But this Sea of Law was Heavenly Dao’s blessing. It was a massive lucky chance that was hard to come by once every ten million years.

Even if Ye Yuan preached on the Dao one more time, it would also be very difficult to trigger anymore.

This kind of Sea of Law, even to Ancestor Realms, it was also a massive lucky chance.

Reaching Pilljade’s level of boundary, even wanting to improve a trace was harder than ascending to heaven.

But with the Sea of Law, they could feel Heavenly Dao in close range. Breaking through would clearly be much easier than cultivating themselves.

The group of Empyreans turned solemn in their hearts, hurriedly recollecting their thoughts and stepping into the Sea of Law, and started comprehending Alchemy Dao.

This Sea of Law descending, Ye Yuan naturally detected it long ago.

This kind of major lucky chance that only came by once in a thousand years, logically speaking, he should immediately stop and comprehend laws.

No one knew how long this Sea of Law would last.

But he did not.

He kept on preaching on Dao and did not stop.

One day, two days ...

In a blink, half a month was already up. Ye Yuan’s sermon finally ended. Only then did he shut his eyes and meditate, starting to feel the Sea of Law.

“Grandmaster Ye is truly trustworthy!”

“Grandmaster Ye actually didn’t stop preaching on the Dao for our sakes!”

“No can do! After this Cloudpill Summit ends, I’m going to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City immediately to repay his grace of preaching!”

...

In the crowd, those alchemists were shedding tears of gratitude toward Ye Yuan.

How much comprehension time that Ye Yuan had forsaken, they had a score in their hearts.

Winning sincerity with sincerity, how could others not feel moved?

But Ye Yuan did not pay attention to this. His mind and body already sunk into the Sea of Law, entering a state like an old well without ripples.

A profound power of law revolved around him.
