Chapter 2423: Completely Reborn!

All of a sudden, the situation changed drastically!

The divine race army retreated like the tide, this made the coalition forces somewhat at a loss on what to do.

What came immediately was a burst of ecstasy!

They did not know what happened, but they knew that they were saved.

But Ni Xuan and the group of upper echelons had solemn expressions on their faces.

This place had not entered the influence range of Eight Void Mountain’s grand array yet. Ye Yuan they all were luring the enemy deep in using themselves as bait.

It was just that, how could a mere unpredictable army be able to resist the entire divine race’s army?

This battle was too dangerous.

Ni Xuan they all had also urged Ye Yuan before, to not risk his life. But Ye Yuan said that if he did not take the risk, he would have to use the coalition forces’ lives to take the risk!

The two sides’ armies, the numbers were too many. It was impossible for all of them to enter the range of Eight Void Mountain’s grand array.

Once both sides went to war, in this kind of narrow place, it would be a life-and-death battle.

At that time, there would be countless casualties.

In contrast, the unpredictable army being the bait would be much more agile.

Hence, he did not scruple to risk his life to be the bait.

Daymeld’s ultimate goal was him. As soon as he appeared, the divine race would inevitably pour the power of the whole army to encircle and suppress him.

Currently, it was indeed the case!

Except, this war tactic was seriously too dangerous. Once the army fell into heavy encirclement, Ye Yuan would undoubtedly die.

One had to know, the opponent this time was not just several dozen Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realms.

Disregarding the others, just one Daymeld was terrifying to the extreme.

“The three armies, listen to this order! Attack the divine race army and work in concert with the unpredictable legion!” Ni Xuan said in a stern voice.

... ...

The unpredictable army fell into the sea of divine race army very quickly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

A mere 70 thousand people, they were insignificant like an ant in front of the entire divine race army.

But the combat power of these 70 thousand people was surprisingly powerful!

The places that it passed through, the divine race army actually did not have any who could last more than an exchange.

The powerful divine race army appeared like a bunch of clay chickens and pottery dogs in front of this unpredictable army.

These few months, the divine race army had long already been accustomed to victory.

Suddenly seeing such a courageous human army, it shocked them.

“Why is there such a powerful legion in the human army?”

“Too strong! I feel that they are like a moving fortress; unable to shake at all!”

“I got it! They are that mysterious army that annihilated the Divine Children Legion! Really so strong”

... ...

The unpredictable army was like a bulldozer. The places that it passed through were all mowed down.

This kind of might was something that the divine race army had never experienced before.

In their perception, the human race was a bunch of ants; not worth mentioning at all.

All the way until they encountered the unpredictable army.

But they did not notice that in the unpredictable army, there was a figure who was illusory and did not make a move to kill the enemy.

The unpredictable army may seem scattered, but actually, they were extremely organized.

These unpredictable children, every three people formed a combat unit, becoming a miniature combat group.

Each combat unit formed a slightly larger combat group, so on and so forth!

This army was carrying out a group battle with precisely a powerful array formation.

This array formation was somewhat similar to Yuan Zhen three people’s Lesser Three Origin Formation back then, but it was much more brilliant than theirs.

But the entire unpredictable army had many invisible threads controlling, and the end of the threads was held in Ye Yuan’s hands!

It was him controlling the entire unpredictable army in battle.

The time that he returned was not long, the warriors of the unpredictable army were still unable to fully control the battle formation that he created.

Hence, he thought of an idea: controlling every unpredictable child as a sword!

He planted a sword intent in each person and conveyed orders with the sword intent.

Each unpredictable child only needed to move and fight according to his instructions, and they would be able to maximize their combat effectiveness!

Furthermore, being controlled by him compared to the unpredictable children fighting on their own, the power unleashed was several times greater!

The current unpredictable army, their combat effectiveness was more than a hundred times stronger than when they fought with the Divine Children Legion back then!

Among the unpredictable children, each one of their combat power was extremely fearsome.

Now, with the help of array formation, they were even more invincible!

“Your Excellency, can’t anymore! We almost can’t stop them anymore!”

“They are too strong! We can’t stop them at all! Only by sending Nine-marks powerhouses over can we stop them!”

... ...

The divine race’s battle will was very strong. But even so, they were also killed by the unpredictable army until they felt chills.

At this time, Tian Lin brought a group of Nine-marks powerhouses and just happened to arrive in time.

Seeing this scene, he could not help giving a cold snort and said in a solemn voice, “A bunch of ants also dares to challenge the majesty of the divine race! Attack together! Destroy this bunch of guys!”

Done talking, he took the lead and charged toward the unpredictable army.

The moment Heavenly Dao True Martial was unleashed, a horrifying combat power spread out.

This squad had several dozen divine race powerhouses, and also close to 100 Deva Realm abyss monsters.

This kind of strength was sufficient to squash a human army of several million experts.

With hundreds of Nine-marks powerhouses attacking in full force, how shocking was the commotion?

When the divine race army saw this scene, each and every one of them was greatly aroused!

Pffft!

Puu, puu, puu!

... ...

Tian Lin who took the lead was blown up right away.

Following that, those Nine-marks powerhouses behind him were blown up one after another.

A hundred over Nine-marks powerhouses were practically slaughtered cleanly by the unpredictable army in an instant.

The impact that this scene brought to the divine race army was seriously too strong.

Although Tian Lin was initial-stage Nine-marks, his combat power was already equivalent to Deva Second Blight.

In front of an army formed by a group of Heavenly Emperor Realms, he actually did not survive a single exchange.

This level of lethality was too terrifying!

A momentary silence actually appeared on the originally noisy and chaotic battlefield.

In a single exchange, a hundred over Nine-marks powerhouses were killed. It really shocked the divine race army.

“G-Got to be joking, right? Those were all Nine-marks lords! They even activated Heavenly Dao True Martial. They couldn’t even last a single clash?”

“Even the Divine Children Legion doesn’t have this kind of ability either, right?”

“Monsters! This army is really a group of monsters!”

... ...

For a moment, the divine race army actually did not dare to step forward. They were daunted by the unpredictable army’s overkill.

However, they did not move, but the unpredictable army did not have the intention of stopping.

With Ye Yuan controlling the army and brandishing the butcher’s knife, they charged all the way. The places that they passed through were akin to a no man’s land.

The divine race army wailed all around.

When the news in front came over, Ni Xuan as well as the group of major powers were dumbstruck with amazement.

“This ... This is a joke, right? A hundred over Nine-marks powerhouses were killed in a single exchange?”

“The last time they faced-off against the divine children army, although they won, their losses were very grievous too. Just how long has it been? How did they become so strong?”

“Tsk tsk, Lord Saint Azure is indeed well-deserving of being Lord Saint Azure, he truly transforms the rotten into something magical! That army of young masters actually became so strong after letting him drill them!”

The group of big shots was marveling endlessly.

But right at this time, auras that blotted out the skies and covered the earth surged over from the distance one after another. It was akin to a huge wave attacking them.

Ni Xuan’s expression changed and he said, “Daymeld arrived! Let us hurry up and get on it!
