Chapter 2631: Proof!

Duan Yongchun’s gaze turned dark, and he looked toward Feng Xuanyi and said, “Sect Master Feng, don’t blame me for not giving you face! If your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect doesn’t give this elder an explanation today, don’t blame this Duan for not being courteous!”

While talking, Duan Yongchun’s aura suddenly erupted, looking toward Ye Yuan with an unfriendly expression.

Feng Xuanyi’s expression changed, he knew that Duan Yongchun really got angry.

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “An idiot like you, don’t know how you became an elder! You want an explanation? Fine, I’ll explain it to you! Wu Chengchao, come in!”

Ye Yuan’s voice passed right through the great hall.

Very soon, Wu Chengchao came in.

Wu Chengchao was just a sect protector. He did not have the qualifications to take part in this level of alliance meeting.

However, Ye Yuan specially summoned him over.

Seeing Wu Chengchao, everyone was very puzzled.

“Wu Chengchao pays respect to the sect masters and elders!” Facing so many Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, Wu Chengchao’s expression was somewhat pale.

“Ye Yuan, what’s the meaning of you calling a sect protector here?” Duan Yongchun said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan ignored him, turned to Qu Yan, and said, “Elder Qu, are you interested in fighting a match with our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s grade three heavenly alchemist?”

Qu Yan raised his eyebrows, obviously a little surprised.

He was Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s elder and also Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s one and only grade four heavenly alchemist, he naturally had the qualifications to be here.

But he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually had him compete in alchemy with a Martial Secure Heavenly Sect protector.

If it was Ye Yuan taking action, he would naturally directly surrender.

But, against a puny little grade three heavenly alchemist, he did not take him seriously.

Qu Yan smiled and said, “Looks like Elder Ye feels that this old man isn’t his match?”

Ye Yuan was not reserved either, nodding as he said coolly, “That’s right! Wu Chengchao was single-handedly trained by me. You’re not his match!”

Murmur!

There was an uproar in the great hall.

This boy was also too not low-profile!

Did you think that everyone was a genius like you?

Ye Yuan had not entered the sect for a long time either. It was merely a short ten years.

Considering this period, he was not in the sect for a very long time.

Ye Yuan casually taught Wu Chengchao, and then he could deal with Elder Qu Yan?

Highly boastful!

“Hahaha?… It’s hilarious! Ye Yuan, is it possible that you saw that the current atmosphere was very depressing and are deliberately trying to diffuse the tense?” When Duan Yongchun heard that, he could not help laughing loudly.

Ye Yuan looked at him with a smile that was not a smile and said coolly, “Elder Duan, when I competed in alchemy with the Pill Alliance’s Holy Son, I signed an origin divinity curse. Why don’t you try it too?”

Duan Yongchun’s expression changed, and he immediately shut up.

Although he did not feel that Wu Chengchao could win in his heart, but agreeing to an origin divinity curse because of this sort of thing, he would be pretty much insane.

Seeing Duan Yongchun’s expression, Ye Yuan said with a cold smile, “If you don’t dare, shut up! Elder Duan, no one will treat you as a mute!”

“You!” Duan Yongchun choked up until he could not speak.

Qu Yan looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly, not understanding where Ye Yuan’s confidence came from.

He naturally knew about Wu Chengchao. The five great heavenly sects only had few famous heavenly alchemists. Even so, who did not know the others?

No matter how terrible Wu Chengchao was, he was, at any rate, a grade three heavenly alchemist too. He could barely manage to enter Qu Yan’s sights.

It was just that in his view, Wu Chengchao’s strength was very average.

In fact, he belonged to the low-end among the five great heavenly sects’ grade three heavenly alchemists.

Such a guy was casually trained by Ye Yuan for a few dozen years and he could defeat him?

He did not believe it!

“Since Elder Ye has this intention, fine then. What’s the harm in this old man taking action once?” Qu Yan said.

Actually, Qu Yan admired Ye Yuan very much.

An ascender whose affinity was only one point being able to reach this point, it was simply outrageous to hear.

Qu Yan’s affinity was very high. That was how he could reach the realm of grade four heavenly alchemist.

Ye Yuan’s appearance could be said to be a milestone figure to ascender heavenly alchemists.

If there was an opportunity, he would naturally be willing to ask Ye Yuan for advice or two.

As for why Ye Yuan was so strong, as a grade four heavenly alchemist, Qu Yan naturally wanted to know very much.

Therefore, he gave Ye Yuan some face!

“This … Ye Yuan, can Wu Chengchao do it?” Feng Xuanyi pulled Ye Yuan to one side and could not resist asking.

He also did not expect Ye Yuan to suddenly pull an unusual move, to actually make Wu Chengchao go against Qu Yan!

He had confidence in Ye Yuan, but Wu Chengchao … he really did not have much confidence.

One had to know, these few years, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s heavenly medicines were scarce. Wu Chengchao did not have that many heavenly medicines to practice as well.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Sect Master rest assured, Ye Yuan won’t mess around. Wu Chengchao’s current strength is definitely above Qu Yan’s!”

Although Ye Yuan said it with certainty, Feng Xuanyi was still not confident.

When this scene landed in Duan Yongchun’s eyes, there naturally could not dispense with a bout of cold sneers.

If Wu Chengchao won, then things could naturally be discussed.

But if Wu Chengchao lost, this matter could be seized on to make an issue out of it!

In his view, the Pill Alliance was not very aggressive and would not take part in the Five Great Heavenly Regions’ struggles.

How could an alchemy faction have such great ambitions?

The main hall was very large, the alchemy battle venue was in the center of the main hall.

All of the elders could see the two people compete in alchemy clearly.

Qu Yan’s strength naturally went without saying.

When grade four heavenly alchemist was put out there, no matter how weak he was, he could not be that weak.

Rather, it was Wu Chengchao, no one was optimistic about him at all.

These two people’s alchemy battle was not as earthshaking as Ye Yuan and Holy Son.

It could be said that it was all within the scope of mortals.

Therefore, until that moment when the medicinal pill’s quality came out, there was no way to tell who was stronger.

After several hours, the two people’s grade three heavenly pills came out of the furnace respectively.

The heavenly pill was chosen by Ye Yuan, grade three Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!

When Qu Yan’s heavenly pill was put on the Cloud Mount Mother Stone, the scale reached upper seventh grade very quickly!

This result naturally attracted a series of exclamations.

“Haha, good, indeed well-deserving of being Master Qu Yan, his skills are extraordinary!”

“A grade three Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill being able to reach upper seventh grade, it already exceeded the limits of a grade three heavenly alchemist!”

“Heh heh,?I don’t believe that he, Wu Chengchao, can reach eighth grade!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

… …

When many elders saw this result, they all had gloating faces.

Clearly, Wu Chengchao’s Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill did not reach ninth grade. Then, only by reaching eighth grade, could he suppress Qu Yan.

This was virtually impossible to a grade three heavenly alchemist.

Actually, Wu Chengchao himself was also not confident.

In the past 20 years, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect did not have sufficient grade three heavenly medicines for him to practice at all.

But, he did not spend his days in a muddle-headed manner.

These 20 years, he used even more time to study grade two heavenly pills and grade one heavenly pills.

These methods were all taught to him by Ye Yuan.

Wu Chengchao did not feel resentment because Ye Yuan made use of him.

On the contrary, he was very grateful to Ye Yuan.

Because he could see his own improvement in alchemy path strength!

With a flustered feeling, Wu Chengchao moved his own grade three Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill onto the Cloud Mount Mother Stone.

The scale skyrocketed!

The moment when the scale stopped, the entire hall cried out in exclamation!

“Middle eighth grade! This … How is this possible? Based on Wu Chengchao’s strength, he can actually cultivate the grade three Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to middle eighth grade!” Duan Yongchung cried out strangely with a look of disbelief.
