Chapter 1408 Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone

A warm current flowed in Ye Yuan’s abdomen. His divine sea was currently in the midst of slowly expanding.

This was the fifth Weeping Spirit Fruit that he swallowed. He finally found the opportunity to break through.

At this time, he was currently breaking through the bottleneck, further expanding the divine sea!

Ye Yuan’s divine sea exuded an archaic aura that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life. It was as if it came from ancient times.

The Weeping Spirit Fruit’s strength was being continuously refined by the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, pouring into his divine sea.

Finally, the divine sea started expanding outwards, expanding, forcefully expanding the space of Ye Yuan’s dantian area by a great deal.

With this expansion, the divine sea became empty all at once.

Then, Ye Yuan started to frantically absorb the outside world’s spiritual energy, pouring it into the divine sea.

No idea how long had passed either, everything quietened down.

“This Chaos Heavenspan Canon truly seizes the good fortune of heaven and earth! The divine essence inside your divine sea is getting thicker and thicker, almost becoming a starchy paste already! The thickness of this divine essence may be rated as invincible within the same realm!” Dustless said with an emotional sigh.

Other people’s divine sea was akin to a vast ocean.

But the divine essence inside Ye Yuan’s divine sea was extremely thick, already almost turning into a lump of paste.

This was also to say that when the realm was the same, the thickness of Ye Yuan’s divine essence was what others were unable to match.

Ye Yuan said, “In a blink, already cultivated to grand completion first level. It looks like the mission for the period of time next is to create the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s second level. It’s just that so many years have passed, I still don’t have any leads at all.”

These few years, Ye Yuan had always been trying to create the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s second level but had ended without any fruits.

Ye Yuan knew that the higher the realm, the greater the difficulty of creating this cultivation method.

In particular, the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, this cultivation method, had once triggered a heaven and earth phenomenon. The difficulty was even more conceivable.

The more profound the comprehensive, the clearer one needed to be about Heavenly Dao, and overall understanding. This absolutely took time and effort.

Ye Yuan’s Grotto Profound Realm was not yet perfected. His understanding of Heavenly Dao was still stagnated at the comprehension of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and was naturally unable to create the second level.

Now, Ye Yuan already cultivated to Grotto Profound to the grand completion. The biggest goal of the next step was to create the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s second level[1].

“You should go out to experience and temper. Shutting yourself in the room to make a cart, this second level cultivation method probably isn’t so easy to create.” Dustless suggested him.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Indeed. After coming to the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, too much time was on closed-seclusion cultivation. It’s precisely because of that I would go and take part in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time. The battle with Jin Yu, I still gained quite a lot.”

Dustless nodded and said, “Mn, it’s good that you have this idea. But there’s something that you still have to take heed of.”

Ye Yuan said curiously, “Senior, please say.”

Dustless said, “The Soul Suppressing Pearl can protect Mu Lingxue, that lass’s spiritual consciousness from extinguishing. But it doesn’t mean that it can let her spiritual consciousness forever not extinguish! My state, you’re also aware. I could only recover some power by borrowing those evil spirits’ strengths. But I’m still too far away from my peak state.”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed and he said with a frown, “Senior, why didn’t you tell me this in the past?”

Dustless smiled and said, “What can you do if I tell you? To you, the biggest task is to cultivate! Some things, I’ll naturally tell you when the time comes.”

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath and said solemnly, “Then what should I do now?”

Dustless said, “Go find Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones! The impurities of evil spirits are too many, unable to support my maintaining this lass’s spiritual consciousness for a long time. Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are a good tool to nourish the divine soul and can help me restore my strength further. As long as my divine soul recovers to Two-star, I can preserve this girl’s divine soul from extinguishing for ten thousand years!”

Ye Yuan’s heart sunk and he said, “Only ten thousand years?”

Ye Yuan knew that the cultivation in the future will probably easily require several hundred or thousands of years. Ten thousand year’s time was really not considered very long.

Dustless nodded and said, “Once a person dies, the spiritual consciousness dissipating is nature’s maxim. Maintaining her spiritual consciousness from extinguishing goes against the heavens to begin with. Unless one can reach Dao Ancestor, that kind of height, otherwise, nobody can ensure that her spiritual consciousness won’t dissipate at all! Your current strength can barely enter the martial arts world to experience and temper, and search for Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones in the martial arts world. Your state in the past, telling you this kind of thing won’t have any use apart from interfering with your cultivation.”

Ye Yuan admitted that if Dustless told him this news earlier, it would indeed have affected his cultivation.

More haste, less talk. Ye Yuan knew that Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness could not be imperishable and would be bound to be overly eager for success. The impact on his future would probably be very great.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Senior, I’ll go to the academy to accept missions right now, and enter the martial arts world!”

Ye Yuan knew that the academy’s inner-court students could accept missions and go out to train.

Some were like Wang Song, appointed as a region’s city lord.

However, Wang Song they all did not have confidence in themselves or had no courage to enter the martial arts world.

Powerhouses who truly had strength would enter the martial arts world to train, completing the missions provided by the academy.

And the Immortal Grove World was one of the martial arts worlds!

The Heavenspan World had existed for God knows how many billions of years. The powerhouses accumulated were goodness knows how many.

One had to know that being able to cultivate to the Divine Lord Realm, one could hew open an inner-world, going a step further to derive a small world. That was the martial arts world.

Hence, the Heavenspan World had many spatial rifts that were all connected to martial arts worlds.

Those ownerless martial arts worlds were the perfect places for Heavenspan World powerhouses to explore and seek treasures.

Because each martial arts world had its own unique aspect. It might give birth to natural treasures unavailable in the Heavenspan World.

Some far back era martial arts worlds, it might be left behind by a Heavenly Emperor, even a Transcendent Heavenly Emperor. Inside might contain the cultivation methods and supreme treasures left behind by these major powers.

Once obtained by people with heaven-defying destiny, they could even leap over the dragon gate. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Apart from this, martial arts worlds still had something that everyone coveted: the Dao Fruit!

Powerhouses above Divine Lord Realm would condense a Dao Fruit belonging to them.

They would normally hide the Dao Fruit in their own small world to nurture. Once an explorer obtained the Dao Fruit, that was truly soaring to the skies in one move.

Just like Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang, he ascended to Heavenly Emperor one step ahead of Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove because he obtained a Heavenly Emperor Dao Fruit.

Of course, martial arts worlds also contained enormous dangers. A single mishap and one would perish, their Dao disappearing.

Firstly, Deity Realm powerhouses also existed in martial arts worlds. Some were even very powerful.

Secondly, there were also some danger zones in martial arts worlds, such as the Immortal Grove World’s Godsfall Mountain Range.

Quite a number of martial artists never came out again after venturing in.

Dustless said, “No rush. I know that you’re worried about that lass, but I have a score in my heart. There’s probably still some time before you breakthrough to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm. But before going to a martial arts world, cultivate Sword Dao laws to grand completion first-layered heaven first, thoroughly completing this Sundering Stars move!”

[1] I also don’t understand why the previous paragraph says not perfected, but this paragraph says already reach grand completion. Think author made a mistake somewhere.
