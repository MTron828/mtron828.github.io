Chapter 2051: The Superficiality of Human Relationships

“Duan Yunfei, have you trained Serene Cloud Three Hundred Hands a thousand times? You dare to slack off here?” Yun Yi looked at the Duan Yunfei currently basking in the sun, reproaching angrily.

Duan Yunfei was the youth surnamed Duan who ridiculed Ye Yuan back then. When choosing a master, Duan Yunfei similarly joined in choosing Ye Yuan without the slightest hesitation.

After their group of people came to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, they joined the Pill Tower. It was just that according to Ye Yuan’s instructions, they could only become medicine boys. Disregarding these miscellaneous chores, what they cultivated were also the most basic alchemy techniques.

To these alchemy geniuses who were arrogant at heart and haughty in manner, this was simply something that could not be tolerated.

They had to repeatedly do some dreary things every day, there was no time to cultivate at all.

In their view, it was completely wasting time.

This was not tempering them at all, but making fun of them.

In less than half a year, more than ten people left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

After a year, another seven to eight people could not endure it and left.

These genius disciples more or less had some background.

Later, after they heard the news of Ye Yuan’s demise, one after another left in swarms.

Now that ten years had passed, the original 40 people only had three scanty people left.

Apart from Yun Yi and Duan Yunfei, there was also a young man called Yang Xuan.

Yang Xuan was the Five-star group’s 20th place, which was also the last place. But only he persisted until now.

Even Luo Tianqi also immediately chose to leave after hearing that Ye Yuan fell.

“Heh,

Brother Yun, if you didn’t make me stay behind, I, Duan Yunfei, would have long left! A lousy Serene Cloud Three Hundred Hands, I’ve already trained no less than several tens of thousands of times. What use is there? Moreover, Ye Yuan is already dead. Is there still meaning in continuing to persist?” Duan Yunfei said with a disdainful face.

Yun Yi’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold snort, “Duan Yunfei, I kept on making you cultivate diligently, but you wouldn’t listen! Reading a book 100 times, the meaning can naturally be seen. Refining pills is also the same logic! If you trained in the Serene Hand Three Hundred Hands diligently, there will absolutely be a different feeling.”

Duan Yunfei chuckled and said, “Enough of that! Merely a rank one or two alchemy technique, what kind of different feeling can there be? You already trained diligently for ten years, but I didn’t see that your realm had any breakthrough either! Forget it, forget it! I don’t have the time to waste time here. Brother Yun, you’re really not leaving together with me?”

By the side, Yang Xuan said, “Brother Duan, what Brother Yun said is correct. I also didn’t expect that these foundational alchemy techniques still had such miraculous comprehensions in the past. If you cultivate diligently, it will really be different!”

Duan Yunfei gave a cold snort and said, “What has it got to do with you? Do you think you can call me Brother Duan? Get lost!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yun Yi’s brows knitted tightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “You really want to go?”

Duan Yunfei said coolly, “Brother Yun, it’s not that I’m criticising you, but no matter how great Ye Yuan’s talent was, he also played himself to death! Your talent is currently the Southern Border’s number one, but you want to waste your time here?”

Yun Yi heaved a sigh and said, “Forget it! There is little common ground for understanding between persons of differing principles. Leave! It’s just that, hope you don’t regret it in the future!”

Duan Yunfei smiled and said, “Regret? How is that possible! Brother Yun, the one regretting will be you! It’s already been ten years, yet Ye Yuan didn’t even wake up. Do you feel that he can still wake up?”

Finished talking, Duan Yunfei left with a loud laugh.

Yang Xuan let out a sigh and said, “Brother Yun, I really didn’t expect that you could actually persist until this step.”

Yun Yi was somewhat lost in deep reverie. Hearing Yang Xuan said this, he smiled slightly and said, “Is it that in your eyes, I’m just a silkpants, and that I can’t endure hardships and suffering?”

Yang Xuan blushed. Clearly, he thought so.

But in these ten years, Yun Yi’s actions and conduct indeed made him view him in a different light.

He was the one among everyone who could bear the most hardships and also cultivated the most diligently.

Even these rank one and two alchemy techniques, he had long already memorized them thoroughly, but he still practiced them again and again fastidiously,

When everyone was about to leave, it was also Yun Yi who spoke up and urged earnestly.

It was just that no one listened to him at all.

Musing for a moment, Yang Xuan suddenly said, “Brother Yun, then do you feel that ... Grandmaster Ye can really come back?”

Yun Yi’s gaze turned intent. Heaving a sigh, he shook his head and said, “Honestly telling you, I also don’t know!”

Yang Xuan said in surprise, “T-Then you’re still staying here?”

Yun Yi smiled bitterly and said, “If it were five years ago, I still had some confidence that Grandmaster Ye can return. But it’s already ten years now, that side has already sent news that Grandmaster Ye’s body is already totally without any breathing. It’s completely the manifestation of not having any life force. The reason why I stayed here is that I felt that Grandmaster Ye wasn’t just testing us. He was really teaching us things. Ever since arriving at the Pill Tower, I discovered that turns out one can cultivate like this. The things that we originally overlooked are too many. Yang Xuan, I think that you also have the same feeling, right?”

Yang Xuan nodded his head seriously and said, “It’s indeed like so! A towering skyscraper is constructed from its very base. We think that our alchemy talent is outstanding, but we neglected the importance of foundation. I think that for Grandmaster Ye to be able to have such terrifying strength at a young age, a very large part of the reason comes from this, right?”

Yun Yi nodded his head, deeply feeling that way too.

In these 10 years, Empyrean Pilljade called him back many times, but he refused to go back no matter what.

He was waiting, waiting for a miracle to appear!

...

Empyrean Flutterfeather looked at the Ye Yuan inside the Sea of Law, his gaze was extremely complicated.

“Ye Yuan, are you really dead? This Empyrean doesn’t believe that you’ll die in this matter. But ... it’s been ten years. Why haven’t you woken up yet?” Empyrean Flutterfeather said with a sigh.

“Heh heh, Brother Flutterfeather came again? It’s already been more than ten years. You still haven’t given up? This kid pried into Heavenly Dao, his divine soul has long been wiped out already. You’re actually still thinking that he can come back to life?” Empyrean Proudcloud said with a snicker.

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s brows furrowed slightly and said with a cold snort, “Proudcloud, these few years, the few of you went against the Peak Alchemy Meet’s agreement and secretly ate Heavenly Eagle’s territory. Do you really think that my Myriad Treasure Tower is to be trifled with?”

Empyrean Proudcloud laughed loudly and said, “Brother Flutterfeather’s words are not right! Ye Yuan has already died. The places that Heavenly Eagle has jurisdiction over naturally became ownerless lands. Such a large territory, if those martial artists don’t have medicinal pills, how to cultivate? We’re also blessing a region by doing so, right?”

Flutterfeather’s gaze turned slightly cold and was just about to fly into a rage when suddenly, his expression changed, gazing toward the Sea of Law in alarm.

But Empyrean Proudcloud laughed wildly and said, “Hahaha! The Sea of Law has started dissipating! Brother Flutterfeather, you can help Ye Yuan collect his corpse already.”

Not far away, the Sea of Law that had been calm all along finally had activities.

The vast power of law made the spiritual energy around Tianyue Plaza produce intense undulations.

Rumble!

Right at this time, the winds and clouds suddenly changed. The sky gradually became dim.

In the space where the Sea of Law was at, a violent storm suddenly swept up. Limitless heaven and earth spiritual energy closed in toward the Sea of Law frenziedly.

Countless heaven and earth spiritual energy condensed to form a spiritual energy fog, turning corporeal!

And this storm was formed with Ye Yuan as the center!

Empyrean Flutterfeather was wildly elated in his heart. He then laughed coldly and said, “Collect corpse? Looks like ... there’s no need anymore! I think you’d better think about how to give an account to the alliance!”
