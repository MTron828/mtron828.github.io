Chapter 2072: Treat You to a Cup of Wine

“How can it be? Master Song Cao actually lost in a fire battle?”

“That small tottering flame, which can be smashed with one smack, Master Song Cao actually failed to beat it?”

“Could it be that this boy is really a fire control master that conceals deeply?”

... ...

Cries of exclamations sounded out all around, clearly not expecting that such a sudden turn of events would occur.

Jiu Luo Ji’s top alchemy master actually lost to an unknown little fellow.

“Just this bit of capability? You disappoint me too much,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Song Cao got a shock. A solemn expression was revealed on his face, and he said in a deep voice, “Terrific lad, I underestimated you! Watch this!”

Done talking, Song Cao formed seals with both hands. The divine fire turned into a giant hammer and suddenly smashed over towards that small cluster of fire.

Bang!

The giant hammer directly crumbled.

Song Cao’s expression changed drastically. This time, he was genuinely shocked.

If that time previously was just him doing it casually, then this time he already unleashed 70% of his strength. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It actually could not even withstand a single blow in front of this small falteringly cluster of fire?

Wu Ling’s small mouth opened to form a circle, looking at this scene in disbelief.

“Big Brother, did Master Song Cao underestimate the enemy too much? This ... This is also too unreal, right?”

Wu Song’s expression was solemn as he shook his head and said, “I’m afraid that it’s not as simple as underestimating the enemy! I also felt that that small flame just now was too weak to stand up to a gust of wind. But looking at it now, the flame was compact to the extreme! So in the view of outsiders, they can’t feel the temperature and aura at all. This fire-controlling technique has reached the acme of perfection!”

Wu Ling could not resist looking toward Ye Yuan. Could it be that this hateful guy was actually a fire-controlling expert?

“Not bad this time, the flame is much more condensed. However ... it’s still far too lacking. If you’re still not convinced, you can try again,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

In his view, that handling just now was still okay.

Compared to the flashiness without substance before, it was clearly much more condensed.

The alchemists of this Northernmost Steppe would frequently protect the body and expel the cold with flames and were indeed much stronger than alchemists of other places in terms of fire controlling technique.

It was just that this bit of strength was still inadequate in front of Ye Yuan.

One had to know, his alchemy strength was the Southern Border’s number one person.

And what was a foundational skill of alchemy?

It was naturally fire control!

In terms of fire control, the world was so big, but there were really scanty few that could win Ye Yuan.

“Kid, don’t you get cocky! Watch this Song get rid of it for you to see!”

Song Cao gritted his teeth and made his move once more.

It was just that no matter how he cast the fire control technique, that small cluster of faltering fire was just like a small diamond, standing steadfast.

Unleashing seven to eight moves in a row, Song Cao still could not do anything to the flame. His face was grim until it was almost dripping water.

Ye Yuan also got somewhat impatient and said coolly, “You’re too weak. Better invite your master to come out. In order to reward you, I’ll treat you to a cup of wine.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan poured a cup of wine and pushed it in front of Song Cao. Fragrance immediately suffused everywhere.

Song Cao’s expression flickered indeterminately, but he discovered to his dismay that he already unleashed all of his ability and really could not do anything to this small cluster of flames.

He even had a feeling that even if his master, Empyrean Loneswan, was here, he might not be able to do anything to it too!

But very soon, he chased this kind of ridiculous notion out of his head.

How was this possible?

His master was a Seven-star Alchemy God! He was invincible in this Jiu Luo Ji!

How could a mere brat who was still wet behind his ears possibly make his master helpless to do anything?

Song Cao’s attention was drawn over by the thick wine aroma very soon.

This wine was too fragrant!

Fragrant until it made people unable to refuse!

Song Cao could not resist swallowing his saliva and finally still downed it in one shot amidst everyone’s questioning gazes.

“Good wine! Truly fine wine! This old man has never drunk before such a delicious wine!”

The moment the wine entered the mouth, Song Cao could not resist giving praises from the bottom of his heart.

He felt a stream of top-quality wine flow into his stomach, which then instantly set his whole body on fire, making each of his pores open up.

It was as if a blazing sun rose in his heart, warming his entire body.

In comparison, the Raging Fire Brew that he had always cherished was simply like garbage.

When everyone saw Song Cao’s pleased appearance, they no longer doubted the Sunshine Glow.

Previously, everyone was still half-dubious, suspecting if Wu Song was pretending or not.

Now, with Master Song Cao personally confirming it, who else would still doubt?

It was just that this way, the group of martial artists hankered after the Sunshine Glow even more.

The feeling of being able to see but not being able to drink was truly uncomfortable!

“Kid, I’ll help you bring the challenge letter! But this wine ...” Song Cao stared fixedly at the small flask in Ye Yuan’s hand, his goal self-explanatory.

He said nonchalantly, “I said one cup, it means one cup. Don’t give me that look. You go back and tell your master that as long as he, Empyrean Loneswan, accepts the challenge, if this Ji loses, this Sunshine Glow’s recipe will be offered up with both hands. Don’t use this kind of eyes to look at me. With your paltry cultivation base, you can’t snatch it away.”

Song Cao’s eyeballs swiveled around, clearly already having the thought of snatching it.

In a place like Jiu Luo Ji, there was no justice and law at all.

Things that caught your fancy, just snatch it.

As long as your fist was big, whatever you say works.

By the side, someone saw that the atmosphere was not right and warned out of goodwill, “Master Song Cao, just now, Lightning Blade Wang Hang was planning to take action to snatch, and was defeated by him with one punch!”

Song Cao’s face changed and he cried out in surprise, “Lightning Blade Wang Hang? He fused two kinds of power of laws, his strength being already comparable to Fifth Firmament True God. He was actually blown up with one punch?”

That person said again, “Master, so many people were watching it. Could I still be deceiving you?”

Song Cao’s gaze turned intent, only then discovering that it seemed like Ye Yuan really could not be underestimated anymore.

It was only to see his gaze turned dark and he said, “Okay! This old man will help you deliver the challenge letter, but I hope that your alchemy skill isn’t just a little bit of fire controlling technique! Farewell!”

Finished talking, Song Cao put away the challenge letter and directly left.

... ...

News spread extremely fast!

Jiu Luo Ji had existed for God knows how many tens of thousands of years already. It had never been heard of that someone dared to challenge Empyrean Loneswan.

A Seven-star Alchemy God was a divine master in the Northernmost Steppe. Their status was extremely venerated.

Now, a hothead that popped out from God knows where actually wanted to challenge Empyrean Loneswan!

For some time, Jiu Luo Ji that had already been quiet for a long time started boiling with excitement.

“No way, right? Where did this kid pop out from? Never heard before that a remarkable young alchemist emerged in Jiu Luo Ji!”

“Might have come over from the Northern Border? The brat who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth actually dares to challenge a Seven-star Alchemy God. Heh heh, there’s a good show to watch now.”

“I heard that that kid completely defeated Empyrean Loneswan’s accomplished disciple, Master Song Cao, in a fire battle. Wonder if it’s real or fake.”

“Heh, it’s probably that kid deliberately fabricating it in order to grow his reputation, right? Master Song Cao’s fire controlling technique, saying that it’s number one in Jiu Luo Ji is not even overboard. Just based on that kid?”

“But I heard that this boy has a kind of wine in his possession that’s extremely delicious! Empyrean Loneswan only accepted the challenge for the sake of this recipe.”

... ...

The news spread out, questioning voices were everywhere in Jiu Luo Ji.

All because of this unknown boy who was going to challenge the god of Alchemy Dao in their hearts!

No one thought that Ye Yuan had hope. This was completely a suicide-style challenge.
