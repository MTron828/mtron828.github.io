Chapter 2591: Pill Alliance

“Is that so? Then the Worrisome Heart Callousness is also in order to teach her to test poison?” Ye Yuan looked at Qin Shun and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Qin Shun was immensely shocked and scolded angrily, “Bullshit! What Worrisome Heart Callousness! What nonsense are you spurting?”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “There are really quite a number of wondrous formulas in your hands! It’s just a pity that this Worrisome Heart Callousness, this Ye knows about it too! Not admitting is fine. Bring a stalk of Pity Star Grass here. It will naturally be verified.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Shun’s expression changed wildly, and he actually fell silent.

While the others had baffled looks, not knowing what the two were talking about.

Wen Jingxuan frowned and said, “Master, what are you guys talking about?”

Qin Shun’s expression was complicated, but he did not open his mouth.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Worrisome Heart Callousness is a kind of strange poison. There are very few people who know about it! The poisoner just has to fuse his own blood into the poison, then let the woman drink it, and he’ll be able to turn her into his most loyal furnace! However, this poison isn’t easy to refine, and poisoning is likewise not easy. Of course, the symptoms after getting poisoned aren’t obvious. If it’s someone who doesn’t know it, it’s extremely difficult to discover. Fortunately, you aren’t poisoned deeply and can still be saved. Once this poison encounters the Pity Star Grass, the Pity Grass Star will wither and turn yellow.”

Hearing that, everyone was incredibly shocked.

This Qin Shun was actually a beast in human clothing, posing as someone with high morals and plotted against his own disciple?

Wu Chengchao opened his mouth wide and said with a look of shock, “Worrisome Heart Callousness! No wonder! No wonder Chen Yuerong and Li Xinran, those girls, became somewhat odd after becoming your disciple! After that, they died in sect missions! It turns out that you actually poisoned them with such an unscrupulous poison!?Heh,?you got bored of them and made them go and seek their own doom, is that it?”

Wen Jingxuan had a blank face. She was stunned by what Ye Yuan said.

The master that she respected actually did such a shameless thing!

This old thing was simply coveting her looks!

“Therefore, are you still planning on going together with him?” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

“Good! Very good! Brat, I’ve remembered you! In the future, this old man will definitely tear you to shreds! Also, Feng Xuanyi, you should know the consequences of offending the Pill Alliance!”

Qin Shun turned angry from embarrassment and threw down harsh words, then flicked his sleeves and left.

His face was utterly lost!

If he left because of a dispute, he could still garner some people’s sympathy.

But now, the matter of the Worrisome Heart Callousness was exposed, he really lost all standing and reputation.

Worrisome Heart Callousness, even Wu Chengchao could not tell. He did not expect that it was actually seen through by Ye Yuan!

Therefore, he hated Ye Yuan to the bones.

Swoosh!

Luo Yunqing’s figure flashed, blocking Qin Shun’s path.

Qin Shun sneered and said, “What, Luo Yunqing? Could it be that you’re still planning on killing me? Do you know the consequences of offending the Pill Alliance?”

Feng Xuanyi said in a solemn voice, “Let him leave!”

Luo Yunqing had a look of unwillingness on his face, but in the end, he still moved aside.

While Qin Shun had a smug look as he strutted away.

Everyone was extremely shocked. They did not expect that an entrance assessment actually played out until like this in the end.

After Qin Shun left, Feng Xuanyi said in a solemn voice, “It ends here today. The entrance test will be conducted on another day. All withdraw! Ye Yuan, Yunqing, Elder Shi, you guys come with me!”

… …

In the hall, the atmosphere seemed a little heavy.

The sect producing a scum like Qin Shun, nobody looked good.

“Ye Yuan, you were too rash in this matter! Offending the Pill Alliance, our sect’s heavenly pills in the future will get into an even more dire state!” Shi Feiyu shot Ye Yuan a fierce glare and said.

“Enough!”

Feng Xuanyi shouted coldly and said, “Shi Feiyu, if not looking on the account of your face as an elder, I’ll definitely punish you severely today!”

“You, a dignified elder, don’t think about looking for talents for the sect, and even want to doom Ye Yuan to death! I don’t believe that you can’t tell Ye Yuan’s value to the sect!”

“Also, have you ascended for too long and already forgot about hotbloodedness when in the Lower Realms? No matter how formidable the Pill Alliance is, when can they ride on top of our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s head? He, a puny little grade three heavenly alchemist, is even a second-rate existence in the Pill Alliance. His face is bigger than my, Feng Xuanyi’s face?”

Shi Feiyu completely did not dare to make a sound being countered by Feng Xuanyi.

Only then did he know that Feng Xuanyi had already tolerated him for very long!

At this time, Ye Yuan asked curiously, “Is this Pill Alliance … very powerful?”

Luo Yunqing nodded his head and said, “More than just powerful! It can be said that they are Rainclear Continent’s number one major faction …”

It turned out that this Pill Alliance was actually the heavenly alchemist alliance.

Of the various major factions on this Rainclear Continent, more than 60% of the heavenly alchemists originated from the Pill Alliance.

Not only did they control the massive amounts of heavenly medicines, pill formulas, refining techniques, they even controlled the most abundant heavenly alchemist resources.

Many sects’ heavenly alchemists originated from the Pill Alliance.

Such as Wu Chengchao!

However, those like Wu Chengchao did not belong to the Pill Alliance’s own people.

Their internal faction had strict ranks, it was not what anyone could enter as they liked.

And Qin Shun was a proper member of the Pill Alliance!

Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s heavenly alchemists’ strength was too weak. It was difficult for one person to support it.

Being helpless, Feng Xuanyi moved out in person and spent a lot of money to hire Qin Shun.

Who would have thought that this guy was actually such a despicable and shameless person!

Furthermore, the Pill Alliance’s heavenly alchemists were very strong!

The heavenly alchemists that the various major sects sent over to the Pill Alliance, their strength was significantly worse compared to them,

Qin Chao was not considered very strong in the Pill Alliance, but his strength was much stronger than Wu Chengchao.

When Ye Yuan heard, he could not help suddenly seeing the light.

Even Feng Xuanyi did not want to completely offend the Pill Alliance too.

This Pill Alliance controlled all of the Rainclear Continent’s alchemy path resources.

The other sects could only depend on them to survive.

The other heavenly alchemists’ outcomes were much worse compared to those from the Pill Alliance. So how to compete?

Therefore, no matter how you sects fight among yourselves, I stand firm as a rock!

It was also precisely because of this that he could take out so many valuable and obscure pill formulas.

It was just that Qin Shun never expected that the pill formulas were all swiped away by Ye Yuan!

Luo Yunqing finished explaining, and thenFeng Xuanyi followed up, saying,”Ye Yuan, this sect master carried out a huge bet for you! I hope that you won’t let this sect master down!”

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Since Sect Master bet on Ye Yuan, then Ye Yuan naturally can’t let you down. Competing in refining pills, I, Ye Yuan, examine my own conscience and feel that I won’t lose to anyone.”

Only then did Feng Xuanyi turn his anger into joy and say, “Does Elder Ye have a way to increase my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s alchemy path strength within a short time?”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Could Sect Master be joking? Alchemy this sort of thing, how can there be a crash course? Not the slightest hint of lies can be allowed on this!”

“This … Isn’t it because there’s no choice either! You’re able to increase affinity! As long as affinity increases, our strength will naturally rise!” Feng Xuanyi said.

What he valued Ye Yuan most of all was also precisely this aspect.

To ascenders, affinity was a weakness!

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “It’s useless. The effect of Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill on Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratums is negligible! Let alone talk about Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum protectors! Sect Master, if you want to make Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s alchemy path become strong, leave everything in this area to me. Don’t ask too much about other things! Otherwise, forgive this Ye for being powerless to do anything too!”
