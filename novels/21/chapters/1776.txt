1780 Heart of the Void Realm

“Tell you? Heh heh, dream on! Even if I die, I won’t tell you anything!”

The current Sikong Xiu was already close to going mad, his dignity was already utterly ravaged.

His hatred toward Ye Yuan also reached the peak.

But Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “You misunderstood. I didn’t have the intention of listening to you speak. What you say, I won’t believe it either. So, I’ll see for myself.”

Sikong Xiu froze when he heard that and laughed wildly as he said, “You want to soul-search? Hahaha, my Spirit Controlling Sect is most proficient in the divine soul path. My realm is also a lot higher than yours. You actually said to me that you want to soul-search? Ignorant fool!”

Ye Yuan looked at Sikong Xiu very calmly and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Is that so?”

Bang!

Ye Yuan directly stomped Sikong Xiu to the ground with a foot, divine soul pouring into his sea of consciousness frenziedly.

Sikong Xiu’s realm fell greatly, but his divine soul was still very powerful.

Logically speaking, it was totally impossible for Ye Yuan to want to soul-search.

Sikong Xiu naturally thought so as well. His soul force also poured out frenziedly, wanting to directly extinguish Ye Yuan’s divine soul.

But right at this time, a mysterious energy was directly pumped into his sea of consciousness.

His divine soul seemed to be instantly frozen, unable to move at all.

That sort of feeling was like having his hands and feet bound up. He could only passively watch Ye Yuan’s divine soul searching willfully in his sea of consciousness.

Sikong Xiu was overwhelmed with shame and anger. All of his secrets were displayed in front of Ye Yuan unreservedly.

When the Spirit Controlling Sect disciples saw this scene, each and every one of their faces changed drastically.

Ye Yuan really succeeded!

This young man in front of them was too scary! Who on earth was he? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After a slight while, Ye Yuan’s divine sense withdrew, his eyes revealing a ruminating expression.

“Ye Yuan, I’m going to kill you! Kill you!”

Sikong Xiu pounced over toward Ye Yuan with a roar. Ning Tianping flashed, directly sending him flying with a slap.

The current Sikong Xiu was already an arrow at the end of its flight. With Ning Tianping’s current skills, dealing with him was easily accomplished.

“A trash like you wants to kill His Excellency?” Ning Tianping said disdainfully.

Ye Yuan looked at Sikong Xiu and said with a cold smile, “Your Spirit Controlling Sect is really worse than animals! White Light, Tianping, Tigerheart, kill all of them, spare none.”

This Spirit Controlling Sect committed many evils and had utterly no humanity to speak of.

This Sikong Xiu was even more wicked, raping and looting, committing all kinds of atrocities.

This kind of person, if Ye Yuan did not run into him, then forget it

Since he provoked him, Ye Yuan naturally would not be soft-hearted.

These Spirit Controlling Sect disciples were all in very sluggish states currently because of summoning the guardian sacred beast. White Light three people disposed of those few like chopping vegetables.

“Big Brother, I really didn’t think that you could actually search for me until here! If not for you, I probably ...”

White Light’s expression dimmed. Thinking of that life worse than pigs and dogs from henceforth, he could not help feeling lingering fear.

Ning Tianping could not resist saying, “Brother White Light, you don’t know how great a price His Excellency expended in order to find you.”

Ye Yuan glared fiercely and said angrily, “You talk too much!”

Ning Tianping stuck out his tongue and sensibly shut up.

White Light was moved inwardly. With Ning Tianping saying so, how could he still not understand in his heart?

“Alright, don’t listen to this punk talk nonsense. It’s good that you’re alright.” Ye Yuan patted White Light’s shoulder and said.

White Light nodded his head and said no more.

Between him and Ye Yuan already did not need to say too many feeble words to thank.

If Ye Yuan was in trouble, he would likewise throw caution to the winds and go save him.

Only after a bout of small talk did Ye Yuan know that White Light did not want to come to the Demon Divine Region on his own initiative, but he was compelled against his will.

Back then, after he left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, he accidentally stumbled into a grotto.

White Light obtained the tiger clan’s legacy inside the grotto and was also trapped there for as long as several hundred years.

Later, White Light’s strength advanced a lot, and he could finally walk out of the cave.

Who knew that walking out from there, he already arrived at the Demon Divine Region.

Then later on, Ye Yuan knew about it.

When he knew the whole story, his entire person was stunned there.

He did not think that he treated Blackpupil as a brother, but Blackpupil took him to be a fool.

But after hearing the Blackpupil was tortured to death by the Heavenly Tiger King, White Light also felt at ease.

No matter what, Big Brother already avenged him.

“Big Brother, what should we do now? Did you find any useful clues from that Sikong Xiu?” White Light asked.

The urgent matter on hand was for the few people to find a way out.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Bamboo Groove Void Realm has a void realm heart. Void realm hearts are a singularity that connects the Heavenspan World and void realms. It can continuously draw energy from the Heavenspan World without ceasing, maintaining the void realm’s consumption. As long as one can find the void realm heart, they will be able to find a way back.”

White Light frowned when he heard that and said, “This void realm heart is so important. So it definitely isn’t that easy to find, right?”

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “This Bamboo Groove Void Realm is an empyrean level void realm. Many major sects also have True God Realm powerhouses holding down the fort. Wanting to barge into the place where the void realm heart is at is simply nothing more than wishful thinking.”

The three people could not help drawing a cold breath when they heard. This void realm heart was so important, it was definitely held in the hands of the most powerful characters.

Empyrean level powerhouses, blowing a breath could turn the few of them into dust. Wanting to barge into the place where the void realm heart was at was simply an impossible mission.

“Your Excellency, this ... could it be that we have to keep on waiting here?” Ning Tianping’s expression changed slightly as he said.

Ye Yuan said, “Not necessarily so as well! The faction in charge of the void realm heart is called Bamboo Groove Holy Temple. Under the Bamboo Groove Holy Temple, there are more than ten True God level sect forces. Every thousand years, these True God level sect forces would undergo the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, and the top five of the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave will have the qualifications to become the Bamboo Groove Holy Temple’s disciple. And these five people will also obtain the qualifications to enter the void heart realm to gain enlightenment on Dao!”

Inside the void realm heart, there were the lifetime comprehensions of the major power who created this void realm left behind.

So it was not only an important treasure for maintaining the operation of the void realm, it was also an excellent place for comprehending Dao.

“Big Brother, your meaning is that we have to join these sects, then take part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave?” White Light said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not us, it’s me! This Bamboo Groove Void Realm martial artists’ legacies are extremely ancient. The divine essence that they cultivate is also different from the Heavenspan World. When you guys arrive at the sects, as long as you utilize divine essence, you’ll immediately be found out. So, the few of you wait in the Purple Extreme Hall and cultivate well. I’ll bring you all back to the Heavenspan World.”

White Light shrugged and said, “Alright. Big Brother, your cultivation method is too freakish. So it is better to leave this kind of thing for you to do.”

He knew that Ye Yuan’s cultivation method could even simulate the fiend race’s fiend essence, let alone this Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s divine essence.

Ye Yuan carried out soul-search on Sikong Xiu and naturally knew the exit of the sundered boundary.

He let White Light and the rest enter the Purple Extreme Hall. He then headed toward the exit that led to the Bamboo Groove Void Realm himself.
