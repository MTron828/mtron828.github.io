The current Ye Yuan already put his body and mind into the pill formula.

These people’s discussion, he did not hear a single word of it.

When Lumen saw this scene, a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes.

This focus level was also too terrifying, right?

Was Ye Yuan pretending to be profound?

Maybe not!

This kind of focused expression could not be intentionally made.

But he also knew that for Ye Yuan to want to digest this ancient formula, it would definitely need a very long time. So he said, “Then ... Let’s continue discussing.”

“May I ask, Brother Lumen, what was the fifth kind of spirit medicine that everybody deduced?” Just as everyone was planning on continuing to discuss, Ye Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and asked.

Empyrean Lumen was taken aback when he heard that and said, “The fifth kind of spirit medicine was proposed by Brother Purplewing. He felt that it should be Element Heart Illusionary Love Grass. We’ve discussed for as long as half a month and unanimously feel that the fifth kind of spirit medicine is it!”

Empyrean Purplewing said with a proud look, his eyes when looking at Ye Yuan was full of provocation.

However, Ye Yuan did not look at him at all but frowned and was lost in thought.

Everyone looked at him with baffled faces, not knowing what this meant.

“Could it be that Grandmaster Ye has some views?” Empyrean Lumen asked curiously.

Ye Yuan suddenly shook his head and said, “The fifth type of spirit medicine isn’t the Element Heart Illusionary Love Grass.”

The moment the voice landed, Empyrean Purplewing’s face turned black and he almost lost it.

“Humph! This lad is wildly arrogant! The result that we unanimously approved of, you want to overthrow it with one word? Brat, I’ve tolerated you for very long! Don’t put on an act if you don’t know!” Empyrean Purplewing said in a thunderous rage.

The others also secretly found it funny, watching the show by the side.

Empyrean Purplewing finally could not hold back anymore.

Zheng Qiyuan had a gloating expression on his face as he said disdainfully, “In less than 15 minute’s time from start to end, you denied the result that we discussed for half a month? Brat, you’re very capable! Why don’t you say why the Element Heart Illusionary Love Grass is wrong?”

Even Empyrean Lumen also frowned slightly and said, “Grandmaster Ye, the Seven Treasure Cloud Wind Pill is a wind-attribute medicinal pill. Qing You Lian, Qingluo Yunzan, Flowing Cloud Daywind Fruit, and Redundant Spirit Flower; these four kinds of spirit medicines are all wind-attribute spirit medicines among rank seven spirit medicines. The one that is most compatible with them is none other than the Element Heart Illusionary Love Grass. What is inappropriate?”

Ye Yuan did not speak. His eyes glued on the pill formula on the light screen.

The group of Empyreans sneered coldly without ceasing. They already confirmed that this kid was simply holding a position without qualifications.

Furthermore, their tolerance already reached the limit.

If you really had the ability, then it was naturally another matter altogether. But you were full of shit and still wanted to posture here, then it was your wrong.

“Heh heh, what a fine Grandmaster Ye. This is the in-depth discussion that you spoke of? Stop making a spectacle of yourself here. The world of Seven-star Alchemy Gods is what you’ll never be able to imagine!” Zheng Qiyuan finally caught the chance and said with a cold smile.

“Young man, stop pretending to know when you don’t! It’s not that by holding a grandmaster token you’ll really be a grandmaster.”

“Ignorant! Kid, this place isn’t a place that you should come, hurry up and get lost!”

...

The group of Empyrean already completely lost patience. Today’s trap already completely stripped Ye Yuan off.

This guy was a complete and utter conman!

The grandmaster token in his hands was simply a kind of insult.

However, Ye Yuan did not seem to have heard their words. His eyes were still staring fixedly at the light screen.

Zheng Qiyuan snorted coldly. Reaching his hand out to grab at Ye Yuan, he even said, “Asked you to get lost, didn’t hear?”

But his hands had not touched Ye Yuan yet, and suddenly Ye Yuan opened his mouth.

“It’s true that the Seven Treasure Cloud Wind Pill is a wind-attribute medicinal pill. The other four types are also indeed wind-attribute spirit medicines. On the surface, it looks like the Element Heart Illusionary Love Grass is indeed the most suitable fifth type of spirit medicine. But the composition style of this medicinal pill isn’t like this!’ Ye Yuan ruminated as he said this.

“Oh? Pray tell!” Empyrean Lumen said with great interest.

Zheng Qiyuan withdrew his hand resentfully. His expression was seemingly embarrassed.

Ye Yuan continued explaining, “When placed in a medicinal pill, an attribute can have thousands, tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of ways of expression. The former four types of spirit medicines looked to be disorderly and unsystematic, but actually, they abide by a kind of rule, that is the speed characteristic of wind-attribute. But the Element Heart Illusionary Love Grass clearly doesn’t belong to this category ...”

Ye Yuan spoke with confidence and composure, making everyone’s faces become solemn.

He analyzed the four types of spirit medicines in detail. The attributes that each type of spirit medicine contained as well as the pairing between spirit medicines, he spoke about it as if enumerating his family’s heritage.

The expression on everyone’s faces went from the initial-most disdain, to shock, then to deep thought later.

Unknowingly, they were already completely drawn in by the things Ye Yuan said as if they were students that were listening respectfully to their teacher.

Empyrean Lumen was extremely shocked in his heart. He had never considered these things before.

The thing that they discussed for more than a month was actually totally repudiated by Ye Yuan in 15 minutes!

This bit of time was roughly just enough for Ye Yuan to skim through the ancient formula once.

Could it be that ... Ye Yuan only swept one glance and already completely understood the pill formula?

Instantly understood?

This ... How horrifying did this kind of comprehension ability have to be!

Could it be that this guy did not need to use his brain?

The more Empyrean Lumen thought, the more terrified he felt.

He discovered that Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao was much deeper than his, and it was already pointing straight at the source of Alchemy Dao.

This kind of understanding was not what a high realm could accomplish.

The understanding of the source of spirit medicines was not limited to realm but it could determine one’s realm.

The height of Ye Yuan’s horizons made the group of Seven-star Alchemy Gods perspire from embarrassment.

Zheng Qiyuan’s expression became uglier and uglier. He did not think that Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao was actually so deep, even flinging him behind several streets.

Just this one pill formula, Ye Yuan already analyzed until he deconstructed it entirely.

There were quite a few areas where even he, this Seven-star Alchemy God, did not understand.

Empyrean Lumen’s eyes became brighter and brighter. Suddenly, he smacked his thighs and cried out in surprise, “So that’s how it is! So that’s how it is! Why didn’t I think of it? Grandmaster Ye, then in your view, what’s the fifth type of spirit medicine?”

Ye Yuan’s string of words earlier gave him a feeling of being enlightened all of a sudden.

But who knew that Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Haven’t thought of a suitable one for the time being. Give me some time.”

Saying finish this sentence, Ye Yuan closed his eyes and fell into rumination.

He only glanced at the pill formula once after all. He could understand the pill formula, but wanting to make up for the spirit medicines naturally could not be done in a short while.

The other Empyreans naturally understood. Completing a pill formula was not something that could be accomplished in one go. Not only did it need to undergo precise deductions, it even had to go through numerous trials.

Only when the medicinal pill was refined could it be considered a complete success.

A short 15 minutes, forget about Ye Yuan, even if the Medicine Ancestor came, he could not do it either.

But even so, it was also sufficient to astonish the group of Empyreans.

Those Empyreans used an expression like they had seen a ghost to look at Ye Yuan, not knowing what they should say.

Was this guy really just a thousand over years old?

Such profound understanding, even old monsters that had lived for millions of years could not match up too!
