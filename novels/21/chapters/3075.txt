Chapter 3074: Ruined My Great Plan!

“I … I almost can’t hold on anymore. Cloudneon, do you think Ye Yuan … can find the Universe volume?” Feng Qingxuan’s breathing was barely perceptible as she said to the Cloudneon next to her.

Cloudneon’s situation was not much better than hers too.

Her soul body was faint. Even if she had myriad origins, she could not withstand being refined by the blazing fire too.

There were several Supreme Hegemons who were already refined.

Cloudneon had formidable strength by relying on the Cloud Dream Soul Physique and forcefully held on until now.(Search New Novel* )

Among the over 50 thousand people that Ye Yuan brought, there was only one-third left now.

Yang Qing’s strength far surpassed his peers. But at this time, he already could not hold out as well.

“It’s too hard! Putting aside that there are tens of thousands of residences here, even if he can really find a Heavenly Dao Painting, it might not be the Universe volume too! This possibility is negligible!” Cloudneon said weakly.

“Ye Yuan will definitely find it!” Although Yang Qing was weak, these words had a decisiveness that could chop iron.

Cloudneon shook her head and did not argue.

Her personality was cold, and she did not like to argue with people.

If there were really any altercations, she would just kill them.

Yang Qing saw that she did not believe him. He said, “You all don’t know this but Ye Yuan has the Extreme Medicine Sect’s power of blessing on him, his luck is heaven-defyingly good! Otherwise, how do you all think he found so many Heavenly Dao Paintings?”

......

The look in Cloudneon’s eyes gradually became somewhat lax.

The Extreme Dao True Fire on her body also gradually grew more vigorous.

She could not hold on much longer!

Hegemon Realm powerhouses were the targets that were prioritized.

Instead, it was those under Hegemon Realm that had higher hopes of survival.

With Cloudneon being a Supreme Hegemon, Ancestor Heavenless naturally would not let her off too.

“I … I can’t anymore! Ye Yuan, where are you? I … I really want to see you one last time!” Feng Qingxuan’s consciousness became a little blurry.

The current Ancestor Heavenless was very pleased with himself!

The several hundreds of thousands of years’ worth of plan, it was finally going to be realized!

“Hahaha?… Samsara, Blood Progenitor, you guys never dreamed that it’s this ancestor who had the last laugh, right? This heavenly pill, this ancestor will name it Great Beyond Flower Blooming! From now on, above in the heavens and beneath the earth, I alone reign supreme! I’m called Heavenless. I am heaven!” Ancestor Heavenless said excitedly.

How aggrieving was the defeat back then?

Now, he staged a comeback and finally had the last laugh. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Trampling all the heavens and myriad worlds under his foot, how glorious was this.

“Also, Ye Yuan punk won’t be able to make it in time anymore! In another two hours, this ancestor will be able to refine everyone! So what if he’s lucky? You ultimately can’t escape death!” Ancestor Heavenless’ voice spread throughout the entire Labyrinth Divine World.

Right at this time, a surge of origin power suddenly descended!

Spatial origin!

Ancestor Heavenless’ smugness abruptly stopped!

“This … How is this possible? It had just been three months, and he actually comprehended spatial origin?” Ancestor Heavenless was shocked.

Spatial origin was one of few great origins that was the hardest to comprehend out of the myriad origins and rules.

In terms of difficulty, it was no less difficult than samsara origin and the origin of blood.

How could this kind of heaven-defyingly complex origin power be easy to comprehend?

The Dao of space, very few people dared to dabble in it.

Because origin, this hurdle, one might get stuck for tens of thousands of years!

Once you were unable to break through to Hegemon Realm, then you would be forcibly ground to death by Dao tribulation.

Only Progenitor Mi Tian, this kind of natural-born Hegemon, dared to spend countless years to go and gain enlightenment on spatial origin and attain Great Dao.

Ancestor Heavenless touched his own heart and felt that he was amazingly talented, but he also did not dare say that he could comprehend spatial origin within three months!

Even if there was the Universe volume, it would be impossible too!

Yet, Ye Yuan accomplished it!

How could this kid be so monstrous?

At the same time, Ye Yuan’s imposing aura was currently rising crazily.

Ancestor Heavenless’ expression changed drastically because he discovered that Ye Yuan was currently absorbing the Labyrinth Divine World’s power to increase his cultivation realm!

Was this boy crazy?

He incarnated into chaos. The Labyrinth Divine World was his physical body.

Now, with Ye Yuan absorbing the Labyrinth Divine World’s power, it was equivalent to drawing out his power!

“Damn it! Boy, you’re courting death! Hurry up and stop! Otherwise, this ancestor will exterminate you first!” Ancestor Heavenless’ furious voice reverberated throughout the entire Labyrinth Divine World.

Ye Yuan naturally would not stop. Ever since he entered the Labyrinth Divine Palace, he comprehended two great origins consecutively, and he also comprehended the Universe scroll.

Actually, he could have broken through long ago.

But before this, he chose not to break through in order to not alarm the enemy.

At this time, when he comprehended spatial origin, his cultivation realm seemed like the floodgates opening, rising in a surging tide.

Ancestor Heavenless was utterly horrified because Ye Yuan’s speed of extracting the power of chaos was seriously too fast and too much!

His power was being diminished rapidly.

He actually discovered that him absorbing the Eternal River’s power was not as fast as Ye Yuan absorbing it!

Originally, Hegemon Samsara and the Chaos Bloodstone, who were already on death’s door, were startled awake again by this sudden turn of events.

Their eyes became brighter and brighter.

An unforeseen accident really occurred!

It was Ye Yuan!

In an instant, they even felt that the power of the Extreme Dao True Fire had also weakened by a lot.

“Damn punk, you ruined my great plan! This ancestor will kill you! Die for this ancestor!”

Heavenless was furious. The Extreme Dao True Fire around Ye Yuan instantly engulfed him.

“Ye Yuan!” Cloudneon and the rest were originally pleasantly surprised. But at this time, they turned pale with fright.

They knew how great the power of this Extreme Dao True Fire was.

Once Ancestor Heavenless deliberately targeted Ye Yuan, then Ye Yuan would die beyond a doubt.

Hegemon Samsara and Chaos Bloodstone exchanged a glance. The other party instantly understood tacitly!

At this time, they felt that the Extreme Dao True Fire that suppressed them was clearly weakened by a great deal.

Heavenless’ power had quite a bit that was drawn out to begin with. Now, he was also deliberately targeting Ye Yuan. He naturally did not have that much energy to place on Samsara two people.

An opportunity like this, how could sly foxes like them possibly let it go?

At virtually the same time, the two people erupted again!

“Old Man Heavenless, watch this!”

A shocking power suddenly erupted.

Although they were being refined to the point of death, they had always retained the power of a single blow.

Being able to be named three great supremacies with Ancestor Heavenless, the two of their strength could be imagined.

Boom!

The Labyrinth Divine Palace shook violently!

The spatial node that they bombarded actually had a large hole that was blasted out.

The Eternal River’s power of chaos flooded in crazily.

“Hahaha?… Old Man Heavenless, you were pleased with yourself too early! You never dreamed that you’d fall at the hands of a measly little Emperor Vast Heaven, right? Old thing, this progenitor is leaving!” The Chaos Bloodstone gave a loud laugh, turned into a streak of bloody light, and tunneled right into the chaos.

Hegemon Samsara smiled and said, “Old Man Heavenless, although this progenitor is seriously injured, who will emerge victorious is not yet known! Ye Yuan, this boy, he really gives people a pleasant surprise!”

Finished saying, he also turned into a wisp of green smoke and tunneled out.

Ancestor Endless three people, as well as many Supreme Hegemons, were all not refined yet.

Seeing a large hole being blown out in the Labyrinth Divine World, Ancestor Endless three people’s eyes flickered, directly tearing across the air.

However, those Supreme Hegemons were not so lucky.

Although the vast majority of the people among them had not been refined yet, they no longer had the strength left to escape anymore.

Only several powerful individuals followed Ancestor Endless three people and escaped.
