Chapter 2393: Farewell

“Is it possible that Your Excellency is afraid of death?”

Shang Hang just admitted his fault, but the expression on his face at this time became gloomy again.

Toward Ye Yuan’s behavior of cravenly clinging to life instead of braving death, he was very disapproving.

Ye Yuan was unable to stifle his laughter and said, “You’ll understand in the future.”

Shang Hang had a sullen face as he said, “Humph! All excuses! Who can know about the future? Even Lord Profound Secrets can’t possibly calculate events of the future too. So how would you know? In fact, you don’t even dare to show yourself with your true self!”

Ye Yuan patted his shoulder and said with a smile, “I said this before. You’ll understand in the future. The destiny between you and me isn’t over.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan turned around and left, leaving behind the stunned-looking group.

... ...

With the inheritance grand arrays, Inquire Heavenly Palace became the land of inheritance.

Every day, countless geniuses gathered here, cultivating inside the inheritance grand arrays.

This place became the manufacturing plant of powerhouses.

When Profound Secrets and Witchcloud and the rest learned of this, each and every one of them was inexplicably surprised.

At this time, no one felt conflicted with this decision of Profound Secrets’s anymore. On the contrary, they felt that he was extremely wise. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As for Ye Yuan, he dwelled in deep seclusion these days and rarely showed his face, becoming mysterious.

But very soon, another incident happened that made the entire Deicide’s upper echelons become depressed.

“Puhwark!”

Jian Rufeng vomited fresh blood, his entire person appearing very downcast.

This was already the seventh time he vomited blood today.

These days, the frequency of his blood vomiting had clearly increased dramatically, casting a shadow over the entire Deicide.

“Didn’t you say that there’s still at least several thousand years’ time? Why ... is it like this?” Witchcloud’s expression was ugly as he said.

Jian Rufeng had a haggard face, but his spirit was very healthy. He smiled and said, “Huhu, Old Friend, this is a good thing! With your intelligence, can’t you guess why is it like this?”

Witchcloud’s frowned and mused for a moment. Suddenly, his two eyes went wide and he exclaimed, “You’re saying that the inheritance grand arrays, which Young Friend Ji created, made the auras of the Heavenly Hidden World’s geniuses skyrocket? That’s why it added a heavy burden on you, and it hastened the arrival of this day?”

Jian Rufeng nodded slightly and said, “This boy is truly a rare genius of the current age. With him around, why worry that our great cause won’t succeed?”

Witchcloud frowned and said, “But don’t you feel that he’s a little strange recently? I heard the people below say, he said that he won’t be taking part in the war with the divine race! Could it be that he’s actually someone who clings to life and fears death?”

Jian Rufeng waved his hand and said, “How can someone who clings to life and fears death challenge the Sentry Celestial Palace by himself? My old friend, you make the arrangements. Three days later, my Jian Family’s 100 people shall die martyrs in the performance of our duties and permanently shield Heavenly Hidden World.”

Witchcloud’s expression changed. His eyes were glimmering with tears as he said, “Must it be so fast?”

Jian Rufeng smiled and said, “What difference does a day earlier make? What does a day later matter? What’s coming, will always come. Oh, right, have Ye Yuan come too, I have some words to say to him.”

... ...

Three days later, several hundred thousand geniuses gathered.

The Jian Family’s 100 major powers stood behind Jian Rufeng in silence.

Many geniuses already had their eyes brimmed over with hot tears.

The silence currently, was the prelude to a tragic song.

Everyone knew what was going to happen next.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he felt sorrow in his heart too.

He did not expect that because of his inheritance grand arrays, it actually accelerated Jian Rufeng’s death.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was the present era’s top major power. But his power alone was insufficient to shield heaven’s secrets.

Hence, these 100 major powers of the Jian Family would be martyred together with him.

The Jian Family was really an admirable family!

Ye Yuan saw that there was a child beside Jian Rufeng, who vaguely had the appearance of the Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets of the later generations.

Ye Yuan was astonished, he did not expect that he could actually meet the next generation Profound Secrets here.

Jian Rufeng stood proudly, his gaze sweeping over the group of geniuses, revealing a look of relief.

Seeing these geniuses mature well one by one, was the drive for his willing martyrdom!

These geniuses were the human race’s future.

“Seeing you all grow so quickly, this ancestor feels relieved! This ancestor dying in the cause of justice isn’t considered a major event originally. But calling you all over today, it’s to awaken the hot blood in your hearts with my death. Resistance will lead to death! Today, it’s this ancestor dying for the cause of justice. In the future, the vast majority of you guys will similarly have to be martyred!”

“You all remember this. Dying is very easy; those who are alive are the ones carrying the burden and advancing! The burden on you all is thousands of times heavier than this ancestor! I hope that from this day forth, you all will go and cultivate with a thousand, ten thousand times the effort, to exchange for the future hope of all races! Do you all understand?”

Each of Jian Rufeng’s words was heavy, shocking the soul.

The geniuses present all choked up.

Jian Rufeng used his lofty sentiments to infect everyone present, including Ye Yuan.

At this moment, the blood within his body seemed to be immolating too.

How much did he want to stay behind, to fight side-by-side with these lovable people!

Ye Yuan thought of this.

It was just that he knew that that was impossible. Because the feeling of him leaving became stronger and stronger.

He seemed to be able to feel an inexplicable call.

“Understood!”

The reply was as loud as a clap of thunder.

Jian Rufeng looked at the child next to him, a hint of doting flashing across in his eyes.

“He’s called Jian Haoran, this ancestor’s youngest son. He possesses this ancestor’s bloodline. After I die, he’ll be the next generation Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets!” Jian Rufeng said.

“We pledge our lives to protect Young Master Haoran!” The group of geniuses said in a clear voice.

But Jian Rufeng shook his head and said, “There are no cowards among my Jian Family’s men! Haoran, although you’re young, Father’s unfulfilled ambitions need you to fulfill them! Can you do it?”

Although Jian Haoran was young, under Jian Rufeng’s influence, he already had the air of a general.

His childishness had yet to shed, as he said in a childish voice, “Our Jian Family occupies the destiny of the human race, and we should be the first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts! Devoting my life to duty, till my heart ceases beating!”

Jian Rufeng laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha, indeed my good son!”

In such adverse circumstances, the Jian Family could become such a leviathan, they indeed occupied the human race’s destiny.

But Jian Rufeng did not pat himself on the back, and instead regurgitation-fed the human race with the Jian Family’s destiny, which was truly able to evoke praises and tears.

Ye Yuan felt touched. Jian Haoran said this, and his family also did so.

Even after tens of billions of years, his original intention never changed too.

The Jian Family’s people were indeed remarkable!

Suddenly, Jian Rufeng’s gaze looked toward Ye Yuan, and his pupils could not help shrinking.

He had not seen Ye Yuan for some time already. Seeing him again at this time, he discovered that the aura on Ye Yuan’s body underwent a huge change.

Ye Yuan this person was clearly standing there, but it gave him an extremely unreal feeling.

As if, he was independent outside of this world!

He could not help but recall those rumors, could they ... be true?

But what in the world was going on?

“Ji Qingyun, can ... you stay and save the myriad races from extreme misery?” Jian Rufeng asked, being rather uncertain.

Originally, he was very optimistic about Ye Yuan.

With him around, that was why he would leave with peace of mind.

But, if Ye Yuan was not around, then would their efforts still succeed?

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan, waiting for his answer.
