Chapter 2246: Deva Five Blights!

Got to admit, Daymeld’s strength was too formidable.

Up to this day, he was the most powerful existence that Ye Yuan had encountered.

Even if he was at the same realm, the Time Freeze drained his vital energy to cast, yet it merely froze the opponent for a split second only.

As for the light sword slash, Ye Yuan even practically depleted his divine essence.

Ye Yuan’s all-out strike was still unable to cut him down.

One had to know, this was the prerequisite of Daymeld being suppressed for an epoch, and he was even seriously wounded by the Limitless God Killing Bow.

He said that he killed before the Dragon Ancestor. Ye Yuan did not know if it was real or fake, but without a doubt, he was extremely powerful!

But this sword of Ye Yuan’s already damaged Daymeld’s foundation. He probably could not come out to wreak havoc within a short time.

Ye Yuan swallowed a few more medicinal pills and started recovering his divine essence and vital energy.

There were many powerhouses around. Ye Yuan did not care to be careless.

While right at this time, three figures flew across the air, flying straight for the Limitless God Killing Bow!

They were Heavenly Emperor powerhouses!

At this time, there were actually still Heavenly Emperor powerhouses hiding nearby!

Clearly, they were here harboring the mentality of picking up what slipped away. They did not expect that it was really picked up by them.

The three great Heavenly Emperors unfolded a crazed battle above the void, fighting until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open, divine essence flying everywhere.

The three people vied with each other, neither willing to give in half a step.

If anyone freed themselves, the other two would join hands and attack.

All in all, it was a chaotic battle.

Everyone retreated far away, fearful of being affected.

Clearly, these three people were already in a state of madness.

Ye Yuan’s cultivation method revolved quietly and was currently recovering his physical strength rapidly.

He detected that there were many incomparably powerful auras currently rushing over here.

Not far away, Heavenly Emperor Quicksand sneered and said, “A bunch of things who overestimates their own ability, is a Dao artifact also what you guys can encroach upon? Little Friend Ye, this Dao artifact was within easy reach of you earlier. Why didn’t you take it?”

At this time, Heavenly Emperor Quicksand’s strength also recovered a little and was able to move freely.

He looked at the Limitless God Killing Bow above the void, his gaze being full of greed and regret.

Such a precious treasure, how could he not be moved?

It was just that in his current state, wanting to vie for it was completely not possible.

But just now, Ye Yuan was clearly the closest to that Dao artifact.

With Ye Yuan’s movement technique and means, taking away the Limitless God Killing Bow would be akin to taking something out of his pocket. But Ye Yuan actually did not even look at it.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The divine bow coming into being, the commotion was too great. Probably even Deva Realm powerhouses will be alarmed. I don’t want to be pursued by the entire world. Moreover, I have an even more important thing to do.”

Heavenly Emperor Quicksand felt surprised. He discovered that Ye Yuan really paid no attention to this Limitless God Killing Bow.

Not only this young man had formidable strength and his comprehension ability was extremely high, but his mind was also exceedingly terrifying too.

Even an old monster like him found it hard to control himself when he saw the Limitless God Killing Bow, and yet Ye Yuan could actually remain aloof and indifferent. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Pausing for a bit, Ye Yuan continued, “Oh, right. Senior Quicksand, this Ye has something to ask for advice.”

Heavenly Emperor Quicksand was grateful for Ye Yuan’s life-saving grace and hurriedly said, “Dare not talk about giving advice. Whatever Little Friend Ye has, just ask away.”

Ye Yuan said, “According to what I know, above Heavenly Emperor is Dao Ancestor. That Daymeld talked about Deva Fourth Bligh powerhouses What was it all about?”

Ye Yuan’s understanding of cultivation realms mostly came from Dustless.

But Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was merely a peak Empyrean, and he did not know about the secrets above Heavenly Emperor at all. There was naturally no way of mentioning Deva Realm too.

Heavenly Emperor Quicksand was a late-stage Heavenly Emperor supreme powerhouse. So he was bound to know some secrets.

“It’s also normal that Little Friend Ye doesn’t know. Deva Realm powerhouses, those are all figures high above the clouds, this Heavenspan World’s true hegemons! Even though Heavenly Emperors have long lifespans, it will be exhausted one day. Ordinary Heavenly Emperors, if they die, they die. But after one’s strength reaches Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor, every trillion years, they will experience a blight tribulation! There are a total of five blight tribulations, going by Deva Five Blights. Each blight tribulation will be a life-and-death trial. Countless Heavenly Emperors have died during the blight tribulations. However, once a blight tribulation is weathered through, it will be a nirvanic rebirth, and one will glimpse a portion of Heavenly Dao source, their strength greatly improving from there. This realm is Deva Realm!” Heavenly Emperor Quicksand explained.

Ye Yuan felt enlightened when he heard that, only then, knowing what was Deva Realm.

It turned out that there was actually still such a realm between Heavenly Emperor and Dao Ancestor.

This realm was also the Transcendent Heavenly Emperor that Dustless talked about in the past.

It was just that with Dustless’s level, he could not come into contact with such existences yet. That was why there was a misunderstanding.

Even though Heavenly Emperors were unable to become Dao Ancestors, they could glimpse the source of Heavenly Dao through the Deva blight tribulations, reaching the level of ‘Dao’ from there.

He also finally understood why Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouses would be called supreme powerhouses.

It was because they had to face the baptism of the Deva blight tribulations at any time.

“Then how strong are Deva Fifth Blight powerhouses? Daymeld said that he once slew before a Dao Ancestor-like existence. Could it be that Dao Ancestors aren’t invincible?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

Heavenly Emperor Quicksand smiled bitterly and said, “Forget about Deva Fifth Blight, even Deva First Blight powerhouses are outrageously strong! Once a Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor transcends a blight tribulation, it will be sufficient to instantly kill Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouses! Of course, Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperors that can transcend the tribulation are one in a million. Without sufficient accumulations, crossing a blight tribulation is equivalent to seeking death. As for how long Deva Fifth Blight is, this emperor really isn’t too clear. Forget about Deva Fifth Blight, even Second Blight, those who can transcend it are also exceedingly few. Those able to reach Third Blight, Fourth Blight, are all this Heavenspan World’s supreme figures!”

Pausing for a bit, he continued, “As for Dao Ancestor ... according to what I know, they are indeed stronger than Deva Realm. As for how much stronger, that’s not what I can know. That level of existence isn’t what this emperor can come into contact with at all. But I feel that even if Deva Fifth Blight powerhouses are inferior to Dao Ancestors, they should also be about the same, right?”

Clearly, Heavenly Emperor Quicksand could not come into contact with the truly formidable existences yet.

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered incessantly. Only at this point did he truly seem to understand the Heavenspan World.

But that Daymeld’s strength was really formidable to the extreme.

Eight Deva Fourth Blight and above powerhouses were actually unable to kill him and could only suppress him here.

This guy’s strength might really not lose to Dao Ancestors.

It seemed like wanting to know these secrets, he could only go and ask Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Only that level of powerhouse would know such secrets.

“So that’s how it is. Many thanks, Senior Quicksand! This Ye has other important matters and will take my leave here!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure swept past, finding Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade in the crowd that was surrounding and watching.

“Hahaha ... this Dao artifact is this emperor’s!”

Coincidentally at this time, among the three great Heavenly Emperors, there was finally someone who shook off the other two and grabbed hold of the Limitless God Killing Bow.

However, just as he was laughing wildly, the Limitless God Killing Bow erupted with rays of brilliant light.

An arrow flashed past, that Heavenly Emperor directly exploded, turning into nothingness.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he could not help shaking his head.

These Heavenly Emperors had lived to a ripe old age, but they could not gauge how much ability they had.

How could this level of treasure be what they could encroach upon?

“Go!” Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade and left.

Not long after he left, several dozen powerful to the extreme auras arrived with a whistle.

Each person’s aura was above Heavenly Emperor Quicksand!
