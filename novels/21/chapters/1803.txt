1807 You are Afraid.

“You ... actually ... really killed him?”

Qian Ye looked at the Zhong Hanlin who was already thoroughly dead. His eyes was full of disbelief.

Under everyone’s watchful gazes, Ye Yuan actually really killed a person!

That Heavenly Bud Peak’s Antehall head elder’s expression was even ugly to the extreme.

He thought that his prestige was big enough, his status high enough, but Ye Yuan completely ignored him.

It was still fine if he did not say. The moment he said, Ye Yuan directly trampled Zhong Hanlin to death.

“This ... This poked a big hole in the basket!”

“Is this guy crazy? There has never been anyone who dared to kill people within the boundaries of sub-peaks, this guy is seeking death!”

“He might be thinking of mutual destruction. After all, the Soaring Flower lineage is too much!”

...

Regarding this kind of suicide-style murder, everyone was full of puzzlement too.

It could only be thought that Ye Yuan lost his mind in his hatred and wanted to perish together with Zhong Hanlin.

Deacon Zheng’s expression was sullen to the extreme and he roared furiously, “What audacity! Take him down for me!”

Behind him, two Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses had long accumulated their power, awaiting release.

Under the word of command, they sped towards Ye Yuan like lightning.

“Stop!”

A delicate voice came over, Baili Qingyan’s figure appeared in the nick of time, blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

This sudden change made Ye Yuan rather surprised.

Baili Qingyan turned around and glanced at Ye Yuan, her eyes full of complicatedness, seeming to have thousands of words that she wanted to say. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, now was clearly not the time to speak.

Baili Qingyan’s sudden appearance caught everyone by surprise.

“Deacon Zheng, although Ye Yuan violated the sect rules, this matter was incited by Qian Ye and Zhong Hanlin to begin with! They wanted to kill Ye Yuan time and again. I saw it with my own eyes!”

The present Baili Qingyan was different from when she just entered the sect.

The person she was back then still appeared somewhat inexperienced, being impeded by Jiang Xueyan in all respects like a little sister.

But now, her aura was already totally different.

When she spoke, she radiated awe without being angry, with the dignified manner of a sovereign.

With over 200 years passed, Baili Qingyan had long broken through to the Celestial Deity Realm already. Her current aura was not the slightest bit weaker compared to Qian Ye as well.

Prodigies were prodigies, their rising trend was not what anyone could stop.

The moment she spoke, the weight was different. Even Deacon Zheng also did not dare to casually say to take him down.

At this time, that Antehall head elder snorted coldly and said in anger, “Humph! Baili lass, this kid is too overweening, to actually kill my Heavenly Bud Peak’s disciple with the most potential in front of this elder! If I don’t kill him today, how will I still be this Antehall head elder in the future?”

Here, his strength was the greatest, his position also the highest.

But Ye Yuan did not give any face at all. Now, he could not quite maintain his dignity anymore.

Baili Qingyan said to him with clasped hands, “Elder Tao, Ye Yuan was indeed improper in doing this, but he’s in the heat of anger right now. Doing unwise actions is also within reason. Baili Qingyan apologizes to you on his behalf! But this matter, Baili will bring Ye Yuan up to the Law Enforcement Hall and confront with Qian Ye! Ye Yuan his crime doesn’t deserve death!”

Qian Ye looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “So many years have passed, you’re still so useless! You can forever only hide behind a woman’s back!”

Baili Qingyan’s expression turned cold and she said in a cold voice, “Qian Ye, you shut up for me!”

Qian Ye laughed loudly and said, “Why, could it be that I said wrongly?”

Baili Qingyan was just about to say something, but Ye Yuan walked in front of her and said coolly, “Qian Ye, you self-righteous fool! This time, you won’t have such good luck anymore! Today, our score should be settled properly!”

The moment these words came out, everyone looked at Ye Yuan like looking at an idiot.

Bro, you can hardly fend for yourself right now, alright?

Posturing can change time and venue.

To also be able to utter this kind of big talk, really don’t know what you’re talking about.

Sure enough, Qian Ye burst out laughing when he heard it and said, “I won’t be so lucky? Punk, you’re soft in the head, right? What’s the situation currently, can’t you see clearly yet?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I came today to take Zhong Hanlin’s life and yours! Now, he has already gone first. Very soon, I’ll send you to go see him.”

Qian Ye sneered when he heard that and said, “With just you?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “With just me! Do you dare to have a fight with me?”

Baili Qingyan’s pupils constricted and she cried out in shock, “Ye Yuan, are you mad? He’s a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse!”

Qian Ye laughed wildly when he heard that and said, “Hahaha ... you, a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, want to challenge me? What qualifications do you have?”

Ye Yuan looked at Qian Ye with a smile that was not a smile and said, “You are scared!”

Qian Ye smiled coldly and said, “I’m scared? Heh heh, brat, goading techniques are useless! You, a measly outer-sect disciple. what qualifications do you have to challenge me?”

What Ye Yuan said was right, Qian Ye was really a little lacking in self-confidence.

It was not that he was scared of Ye Yuan, but it was just that he felt that Ye Yuan’s unpredictability was too great.

When Ye Yuan was at Second Firmament Divine Lord, he could cross three minor realms to battle. Furthermore, it was even one-versus-two. Furthermore, it was even with Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin, this kind of elite.

Not seeing for 200 years, how Ye Yuan’s combat strength was, Qian Ye really could not be sure.

Right now, Ye Yuan was in a certain-death situation. He had no need to fight to the bitter end with Ye Yuan.

Win, he had no benefits at all.

Lose, he would not be able to raise his head in the future.

Although Qian Ye was very confident, Baili Qingyan still perceived a trace of Qian Ye’s lack of confidence.

The shock in her heart could not be described with words.

These 200 years’ time, she obtained the sect’s heavy grooming. Her strength had long soared to the sky in one bound already, leaving her peers behind.

Could it be that Ye Yuan’s present strength was actually not worse than hers?

Was ... this possible?

The present Ye Yuan was merely Ninth Firmament Divine Lord!

“Humph! Does this brat want to fish in troubled waters? A Ninth Firmament Divine Lord challenging a Celestial Deity Realm? Overestimating his own ability! In my view, there’s no need to compete. What Qian Ye said was right, you’re a criminal and have no right to compete! Baili Lass, move aside!” Elder Tao said with a cold snort.

Baili Qingyan’s expression changed and she said, “Not moving! Even if Ye Yuan made a mistake, it also needs to be up to the Law Enforcement Hall to punish! Ye Yuan, follow me to the Law Enforcement Hall!”

Baili Qingyan pulled Ye Yuan and was about to leave.

Everyone’s faces changed. With Baili Qingyan’s present identity, no one really dared to do anything to her.

Ye Yuan’s protective talisman was very emboldened!

“Baili Lass, do you want to rebel?” With Elder Tao having his face rebuffed time and again, he was already almost losing himself in rage.

Right at this time, a horrifying aura descended from the sky.

A figure slowly walked out of the void.

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan felt his heart palpitate. He felt like the whole world was about to collapse.

In an instant, his whole body was drenched in sweat!

At this moment, it was like someone used their hand to clutch his heart, making him unable to even breathe.

True God Realm powerhouse!

This was the first thought that flashed through Ye Yuan’s mind!

That person’s gaze was like lightning. Staring at Ye Yuan coldly, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “Sect decree, those who kill fellow apprentices, kill without amnesty! Now, you can go and die!”

Done talking, that person did not give Ye Yuan the slightest chance to argue too, pointing a finger out casually!
