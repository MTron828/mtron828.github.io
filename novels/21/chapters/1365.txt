Chapter 1369: You’re Afraid!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan was indeed rather surprised. Little Fatty passed the first round so laboriously, so Ye Yuan did not expect that he actually earned points in the second round.

Looks like this joker, Little Fatty, was not as simple as he looked on the surface!

Although this second round was done under a very fair environment, it was also considered each trying to outshine the other.

Each person had some of their own trump card ability, even if being restricted in various ways.

But with Xie Jingyi successfully passing the round, Ye Yuan was happy for him too.

“Heh, couldn’t tell that you really have some capability!” Ye Yuan laughed and said.

Xie Jingyi also smiled and said, “The one who’s capable is you! Although cultivation realm was adjusted accordingly, being able to pass through the second round with your strength is already very difficult to begin with!”

Time passed day by day. One martial artist after another was killed in the consciousness space, then came out.

In this round, Ye Yuan’s results were not only not considered outstanding, it even somewhat paled in comparison.

But all these, Ye Yuan actually expected it to some extent and was also not really dejected.

Ever since coming to the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan had already set his mind straight.

He was no longer a proud son of heaven who possessed a lifetime’s experience and was also unable to crush all the way like in the past.

But he could take it one step at a time, walking firmly!

In reality, Ye Yuan’s cultivation path had only just begun.

It was very normal for him to not be able to compete with those disciples that large families groomed heavily.

But then again, his middle-stage Grotto Profound strength being able to do it to this extent already crushed countless powerhouses.

He believed that when his cultivation realm rose, he absolutely would not be worse than these so-called geniuses.

After a month, the second round, Earth Carnage, ended. Qin Shao shook the others off behind with the result of 40 waves, leaving them far behind in the dust.

After two rounds, he ranked first with 315 points!

But what everyone did not expect was that Brilliant Peace City’s Jia Chong actually caught up from behind after this round, surpassing Su Yuecang, and ranking in as second!

His result was 36 waves.

Seeing Jia Chong obtaining this result, Xie Jingyi’s expression became very ugly again.

And just as the results were announced, Jia Chong actually walked over toward Xie Jingyi.

He looked at Xie Jingyi with a haughty look and said disdainfully, “I didn’t expect that you, this kind of trash, could actually clear two rounds too! But ... it’s useless! You saw it yourself too, the disparity between you and me is like a firefly versus the bright moon! You don’t take a piss and check yourself out either, are you worthy of Lin Xiu?”

This action of his immediately caught everyone’s attention.

After two rounds, Jia Chong’s performance was too eye-catching. It would not do even if people did not want to pay attention to him.

It was just that, everyone did not expect that Jia Chong would run in front of a little fatty to put on a show of force.

Xie Jingyi’s face turned from green to white, but his entire body was shuddering, unable to even speak.

He was really afraid of Jia Chong!

Jia Chong was too strong. To be able to charge to the position of second place out of a million people, his strength could be imagined.

Furthermore, this kind of might was an all-rounder might.

Xie Jingyi did not even have the qualifications to be proud in front of him.

Regarding Xie Jingyi’s performance, Jia Chong was very satisfied.

A cold glint suddenly appeared in his eyes as he said in a cold voice, “Also, if you let me hear you say that you’re Ah Xiu’s man again next time, you’ll die very horribly!”

Xie Jingyi opened his mouth, desperately wanting to refute, but he just could not speak up.

Being love rivals with such a person was too dangerous.

“You’re afraid!”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan, who was beside Xie Jingyi, spoke up.

One sentence stupefied everyone.

Jia Chong’s eyes narrowed, and he looked at Ye Yuan, saying in a cold voice, “I know you, Ye Yuan! Your first round’s performance was pretty good. I originally thought that you were a formidable opponent, but sadly ... your strength is too poor! What? You want to stand up for this trash?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said again, “You’re afraid!”

No idea why, seeing that strength smile of Ye Yuan’s Jia Chong actually felt somewhat lacking in confidence.

“What a joke! You’re saying that I’m afraid of this trash? Hahaha ... Does everyone think it’s funny or not!” Jia Chong said with a loud laugh.

Of course, not only that he felt it was funny, the others similarly felt that it was ridiculous. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jia Chong was the current test’s second place. No matter what, he was also not what a trash who barely passed could compare to.

“This Ye Yuan seems to have a pretty good relationship with that fatty. He’s standing up for him. It’s just that these words are said rather bafflingly!”

“Heh, I really didn’t think that Brilliant Peace City’s number one genius is actually a love rival of this fatty.”

“Jia Chong would be afraid of this little fatty? Isn’t this making a joke?”

“This little fatty is a joker. Could it be that it infected Ye Yuan? Hahaha ...”

...

Ye Yuan’s words made no sense but incurred a wave of mockery.

No matter looking from which angle, Jia Chong had no reason to be afraid of a rookie like that too.

It was just that Ye Yuan appeared rather calm as he said coolly, “Firstly, I know that you didn’t place him in your sights at all before, thinking that there’s no way he passes the test. Hence, you were disdainful to come and show off your excellence to him as well. But you’re doing it now! This indicates that him passing two rounds consecutively already almost has the qualifications to stand on the same platform as you! You saw his potential, so you ... felt threatened!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was heated, enunciating each word, saying it reasonably.

The people who made a lot of noise just now all shut their mouths sensibly at this time.

Ye Yuan’s words actually made them unable to refute!

Jia Chong’s face fell, as if Ye Yuan’s words struck his sore spot, digging out the things in the depths of his heart.

Honestly, even he himself also did not know why he wanted to come over just now.

This Xie Jingyi, he did not attach any importance at all.

“Humph! Fallacy! I came to warn him just because he talked big just now, saying that he’s Lin Xiu’s man! He isn’t worthy!” Jia Chong said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This is precisely the second point I’m talking about! You couldn’t wait to come and demonstrate your sovereignty, indicating that you’re not confident! If you have absolute confidence, you would only brush this kind of thing away with a laugh. Because he doesn’t post a threat to you. Now ... you’re afraid!”

Jia Chong’s expression changed. Ye Yuan’s every word struck the heart, making his heart sink.

Even he himself could not resist doubting himself too. Could it be that I’m really scared?

Jia Chong’s expression was incomparably ugly. A bout of faintly imperceptible killing intent locked onto Ye Yuan and Xie Jingyi.

But Ye Yuan did not care at all and said coolly, “If you want to prove that Lin Xiu’s is yours, then use your strength to obtain her heart, then show off in front of Fatty. This kind of pointless threat will only make you seem very intolerant.”

Jia Chong’s expression was grim until water was dripping out, and he said in a cold voice, “What a joke! What qualifications do you have to judge me! When your strength surpasses mine, then come in front of me to talk nonsense! But very good, right now, you’ve successfully aroused my fury. I’ll make you and this fatty know what’s called despair!”

Ye Yuan replied, nonchalantly, “Relax, that day won’t be too far off. There isn’t any difficulty in surpassing you.”
