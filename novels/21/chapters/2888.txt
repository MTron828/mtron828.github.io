Chapter 2894 Sold and Still Counting Money!

Giant Net City was completely boiling over with excitement!

Blood Divine Son His Highness went on a solo run and directly punched through South Qi Giant City!

This kind of glorious battle achievement was unprecedented.

Furthermore, Blood Divine Son His Highness actually had the power of origin on his body!

There was actually the power of origin on a Saint Sovereign Heaven’s body!

The general populace did not know the existence of the Chaos Bloodstone.

But it did not matter. It was sufficient for them to know that a Saint Sovereign Heaven had the power of origin in his body.

Ye Yuan’s prestige had no equal for some time.

Even when You Jin heard this news, he was stunned too.

He felt that this Blood Divine Son was unreliable and somewhat had grandiose ambitions without real ability. He did not expect that he really had some skill.

Even with the power of origin protecting, it was not an easy thing to pierce through South Qi Giant City either.

Otherwise, Bloodpromise, these few origin powerhouses, would have long charged over.

The encouragement that this battle brought to the blood race was enormous.

They deeply believed that Giant Net City’s army could break through the Absolute Heaven Barrier under the lead of the Blood Divine Son and render a peerlessly amazing contribution!

What Ye Yuan wanted was precisely this effect.

Three days later, the army was done assembling!

Even though it was said that it was 200 thousand people, actually, there were only 180 thousand at present.

In these few days of sieging the city, the blood race still lost 20 thousand.

Ye Yuan stood before the army, awe-inspiring as if he was without equal in the world.

His gaze swept across the army, and he shouted, “Everyone, this is this liege’s first battle, and it’s also the battle to rectify our name! In this battle, this liege will lead you all and breach South Qi Giant City, completing a noble exploit without equal! Do you all trust

me?”

The blood race advocated strength. Ye Yuan had long already proven his strength in the hundred sons battle.

The solo run three days ago even made his prestige reach a level like it was the noonday

sun!

“Your Highness will definitely win!”

“The blood race will definitely win!”

......

Over 200 thousand people’s voices shook the sky, reverberating throughout the whole world. Their gazes, when looking at Ye Yuan, were filled with looks of worship.

They firmly believed that this was the leader that was leading them toward the light!

Bloodpromise watched this scene and could not help feeling incredibly ashamed too.

He had led the army for so many years and never enjoyed such prestige before either.

With this momentum, why worry that South Qi Giant City would not be destroyed?

Facing Ye Yuan, he actually felt ashamed of his unworthiness.

“Set off!”

Under his word of command, the army departed!

Bearing down the borders in large numbers, South Qi Giant City experienced the pain of despair once again.

Especially when they saw this army’s mental outlook and aura were already totally different.

In the past, the blood race suffered repeated setbacks and had low morale.

Their combat power often could not be unleashed.

But today, this army had an unstoppable momentum, as if they were reborn anew.

They were clear in their hearts that it was because a new leader was born among them!

This new leader was actually someone who killed his way into South Qi Giant City!

This was absolutely the greatest humiliation to South Qi’s soldiers.

“Brother Feng, this situation is bad!” Feng Xiaotian’s right-hand man, similarly an origin powerhouse, Chen Yi, said with a frown.

Feng Xiaotian’s brows also furrowed tightly.

What the hell was Ye Yuan doing?

That day, he gave him a look, making him deliberately go easy.

This clearly made Ye Yuan’s prestige reach the peak.

But what help was this to this war? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

This guy would not have turned traitor, right?

As for what medicine Ye Yuan was selling in his gourd, Feng Xiaotian was not clear either.

Repelling 200 thousand blood race elites, this was absolutely not an easy matter.

Even if Feng Xiaotian believed in Ye Yuan, he also could not figure out what Ye Yuan could use to save South Qi Giant City.

“Let’s see what happens first!” Feng Xiaotian said in a solemn voice.

Far away, Ye Yuan stood before the army, awe-inspiring!

He looked at Bloodpromise and said coldly, “Bloodpromise, Feng Xiaotian will be left to you! The number of our Emperor Realms is three times that of theirs! This time, if you still can’t deal with Feng Xiaotian, carry your head to come see me!”

Bloodpromise’s expression turned somber, and he said in a solemn voice, “Your Highness rest assured, I’ll definitely take Feng Xiaotian down this time!”

As he said, he led the Emperor Realm powerhouses and charged straight for South Qi Giant City.

Over on the Heaven One’s main camp, each and every one was akin to facing a great enemy, awaiting the fierce onslaught of the blood race army.

However, Ye Yuan suddenly pointed at one of the True Sovereign Heavens and said coolly, “You, bring 3000 men and attack in that direction!”

“Yes!”

The True Sovereign Heaven was very excited, bringing 3000 men and immediately rushed over.

Everyone, including the Heaven One army was waiting for Ye Yuan’s next order.

But ... there were none!

That True Sovereign Heaven thought that they were just the vanguard and that the remaining army would come over right away.

But he did not see any movements until his death.

“Why? Your Highness, why!” On his deathbed, that True Sovereign Heaven shouted crazily.

3000 versus 15 thousand, and it was even while withstanding the city protecting grand array.

The Heaven One army simply killed them as easy as blowing away dust!

Furthermore, the direction that Ye Yuan pointed to was precisely where the grand array was extremely strong.

These people directly became cannon fodders and did not even stir up a single wave.

Why?

The blood race army also really wanted to ask, but Ye Yuan’s current prestige was like the noonday sun.

Although they had misgivings, they believed Ye Yuan without a shadow of a doubt and felt that Ye Yuan’s action definitely had a deep meaning!

“You, bring 3000 people and go attack in that direction!”

Ye Yuan pointed at another True Sovereign Heaven and gave the same order. However, the direction of the attack this time changed to a different place.

Except, this place was similarly where the grand array was extremely strong!

The True Sovereign Heaven hesitated for a bit but still brought 3000 men and rushed right away.

On the battlefield, obeying orders came first!

The result was the same as before.

The Heaven One army wiped out 6000 blood race troops virtually unscathed. Everyone was struck senseless!

What ... the hell was this?

Courting death?

The third time, Ye Yuan pointed at another True Sovereign Heaven and still brought 3000 people.

This time, everyone’s faith in Ye Yuan finally wavered.

People were not stupid. Nobody was willing to court death.

The True Sovereign Heaven said, “Your Highness, may I ask why?”

Ye Yuan said, “Are you willing to sacrifice for the blood race?”

The True Sovereign Heaven nodded and said, “Of course! But I don’t want to die meaninglessly!” Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How can it be meaningless? Bloodpromise that fool doesn’t know anything. He only knows how to attack the city like a headless fly. It’s been several centuries, and he’s completely clueless about where the weakness of South Qi Giant City lies! That’s right, you all are delivering yourselves to death, but your deaths are absolutely not meaningless! Although this city protecting grand array is powerful, it has weak spots too! As long as we figure out the weak spots, breaching South Qi Giant City will be as easy as turning over our hands! Therefore, if you figure it out, you’ll be our blood race’s heroes! It looks like we have some casualties now, but in the end, we’ll definitely lose a lot less people!”

Whoosh!

The blood race seethed with excitement!

Indeed well-deserving of being Blood Divine Son His Highness, peerlessly brilliant!

Ye Yuan’s explanation immediately convinced everyone.

And when the Heaven One army there heard Ye Yuan’s words, they immediately felt like they had fallen into an ice cellar. The joy of victory from earlier immediately vanished without a trace.

And just as Ye Yuan said, no matter how strong the array formation, it had weak spots too.

Once the weak spots were found, then they would not be able to resist at all!

It was not that Bloodpromise was stupid, but it was that the blood race really knew absolutely nothing about Formation Dao.

Therefore, he could only use brute force.

The Heaven One army’s powerhouses all had solemn expressions.

This Blood Divine Son was indeed different!

At least, he still understood the Dao of Array Formations a little.

This was already remarkable!

Sure enough, under Ye Yuan’s fooling, that True Sovereign Heaven brought 3000 men to go and die again!

The battle had not been fought yet, and the blood race had already lost ten thousand men!

Behind Ye Yuan, Yang Qing had no expression, but his heart had long already blossomed with joy.

This guy was too capable of hoodwinking others!

The blood race, this bunch of fools, was sold by him and still counting money for him!
