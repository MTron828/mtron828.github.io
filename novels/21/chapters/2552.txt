Chapter 2558: Take Your Life!

“Heh,?Old Second, this play of yours deceived everybod. It played out really beautifully! As your elder brother, I’m ashamed of my inferiority!” Eldest Prince looked at Second Prince and said with a cold smile.

While Second Prince had a blank face, he completely did not know what was going on.

But he was very thrilled!

Before Ye Yuan made his move, his heart had leaped to his throat, fearing that Ye Yuan would be a goner with a moment of carelessness.

Who knew that Ye Yuan seemingly had divine help, refining all of the heavenly medicines in one go!

“Royal Brother, it was clearly you who played tricks, but is playing the blame game here! This younger brother is the one who’s ashamed of my inferiority!” Second Prince similarly smiled coldly as he said.

“Humph,?you don’t need to be proud of yourself! Extracting heavenly medicines is just the first step! AJasper Regeneration Pill has dozens of heavenly medicine combinations. The complexity isn’t what a Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill can compare to!” Eldest Prince said with a cold snort.

Second Prince did not show weakness in the slightest too and said, “Big Brother, you’re flustered! Ye Yuan has already created too many miracles. So how do you know whether or not he’ll create a miracle again this time?”

Emperor Qiao Kaiyuan sat up straight, closing his eyes. No one knew what he was thinking.

… …

Ye Yuan turned a deaf ear to the outside world’s matters.

He placed all of his energy on the pill refinement.

Ye Yuan’s understanding of alchemy had always been different from others.

People tend to pursue higher level medicinal pills, but then they neglected the foundation.

They thought that by refining higher level medicinal pills, those basic medicinal pills would naturally be mastered.

Not so!

This kind of understanding was one-sided!

In Ye Yuan’s understanding, the foundation was far more important than high level medicinal pills.

Similarly a grade one heavenly pill, no matter how complicated, it was also composed of some basic refining techniques.

As long as one thoroughly grasped these basic things, refining high difficulty heavenly pills was merely something that happened naturally with ease.

In these five years, although he had been studying basic heavenly pills, he had mastered the basics of grade one heavenly pills extremely well.

In the following years, Ye Yuan studied more than 20 kinds of basic heavenly pills.

Each type, he practiced it to the realm of grand completion ninth grade!

If let people knew about these things, it would surely cause a huge uproar.

But it did not matter if people did not know.

This kind of strength would be fully released when refining the Jasper Regeneration Pill!

Of course, being able to reach this step in such a short time, what he relied on was not just his perseverance, there was also his thousands of years of accumulated terrifying experience, as well as his extraordinary alchemy talent.

Not one could be lacking!

Now, Ye Yuan’s instinct was already extremely terrifying.

Although he had never extracted these heavenly medicines before, by relying on his powerful instinct as well as four points of affinity, he could completely extract them.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan fired out a stream of divine essence. Several dozen kinds of heavenly medicines entered the medicine cauldron one by one.

The pill refinement started!

At this moment, his decades of hard training were all poured into the medicine cauldron!

It was easy to say, but refining the Jasper Regeneration Pill was indeed a very big challenge.

With Ye Yuan’s character, he naturally would not fight a battle that he did not have confidence in.

This one month’s time, Ye Yuan studied the properties of the Jade Moon Orchid, Mountain Root Fuyu, and the rest of the heavenly medicines very thoroughly.

And the pill formula, he deduced it countless times too.

While it was complicated, it was not impossible for Ye Yuan.

Let alone that four points affinity let him ‘see’ even more things.

Ye Yuan’s fire control, refining technique, all gave people a master-level feeling. It naturally attracted a series of exclamations.

The expressions of Lin Lan and the rest were very ugly.

Even the emperor who had his eyes closed all along to rest also came to the window again, and looked down on Ye Yuan refining the pill.

But very soon, Ye Yuan became somewhat overwhelmed.

The Jasper Regeneration Pill was too complicated!

Compared to basic heavenly pills, this was an extremely huge project.

From a dozen over heavenly medicines to dozens of heavenly medicines, the increase in difficulty was not as simple as one plus one equals two.

Affinity!

In the end, it was still affinity!

Four points of affinity struggled to make ends meet!

When the difficulty rose exponentially, Ye Yuan felt the inadequacy of affinity once again.

Ye Yuan’s breathing became more and more labored.

The sweat on his forehead became more and more too.

Smiles gradually showed on the faces of Lin Lan, Xie Hua, and the rest.

“Crashing! He’s finally crashing! Freaking hell, scared me to death! Heh, this bit of affinity also wants to refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill, truly a fool’s talk!” Xie Hua said with great delight.

Previously, his nerves had always been tightly wound.

Now, he finally let out a long sigh of relief.

Lin Lan sneered and said, “The difficulty of refining a Jasper Regeneration Pill, even Nation Teacher’s affinity can’t support it. Just based on his tiny bit of pitiful affinity, he also wants to refine it?”

Eldest Prince laughed loudly when he saw the situation and said, “Old Second, this is the miracle that you spoke of? Hahaha … I think this is called overestimating his own ability! The Jasper Regeneration Pill hasn’t even refined until one-third currently, he already almost can’t hold on anymore! I want to see how you make a comeback!”

Second Prince originally had a hopeful look too, but at this time, he also started panicking.

He could even feel Ye Yuan struggling on the second floor.

But the refining process of the heavenly pill was less than one-third!

The emperor glanced, shook his head, and said, “The situation is beyond salvation!”

Then, he returned to his seat again and closed his eyes to rest.

Time went by little by little. Ye Yuan was struggling more and more.

Even his hand was trembling!

Regardless of whether body, divine essence, or origin divinity, Ye Yuan’s limit reached its end.

When Lin Lan saw this scene, the smile on his face grew thicker.

“Huhu,?fleshly body and origin divinity are still fine, but divine essence is a hard criterion! He’s only middle Lesser Sublime Heaven. So his divine essence isn’t enough to support him to finish refining the Jasper Regeneration Pill at all! After his divine essence is exhausted, this nation teacher wants to see what he’ll use to refine the pill!” Lin Lan said with all smiles.

And at this moment, Ye Yuan suddenly stomped his foot, and a whirlwind rose from the ground!

“Gather for me!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry. A powerful suction force gathered the surrounding spiritual energy over.

Ye Yuan’s hands did not rest, directly injecting the spiritual energy into the medicine cauldron.

Everyone was stunned!

There was still this kind of strategy?

“Instantly forming a formation! Borrowing strength to refine pill! This guy …” Lin Lan’s smile instantly froze on his face.

Ye Yuan’s approach was like he was slapping his face on purpose.

He just finished speaking and Ye Yuan flung a vicious slap over!

Borrowing power to refine a pill was an extremely profound method.

When refining pills normally, no one dared to try it at all.

Because it was not their own strength, there was no way of doing what the heart wished in terms of control at all.

Even if it was Ye Yuan, he would not employ this move unless it was a last resort too.

“Condense for me!”

Ye Yuan gave another low cry. The Dao fire dissipated and the spirit gathering formation disappeared. Then, he plopped his bottom onto the ground and his lower and upper eyelids kept hitting.

He was seriously too tired! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

A Jasper Regeneration Pill practically hollowed him out.

“Damn affinity! Really almost took my own life!” Ye Yuan could not resist swearing.

Right then, Lin Lan arrived in front of Ye Yuan and said while looking down from a height, “Affinity didn’t take your life, but this nation teacher will take your life!”
