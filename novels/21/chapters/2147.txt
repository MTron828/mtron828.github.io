Chapter 2151: Ten Thousand Times, oh, Ten Thousand Times!

Long Chi’s complexion alternated between green and white, finally turning into embarrassment from anger that filled his chest.

“So what if you’re an Empyrean? In front of this Emperor, Empyreans are ants! If this Emperor wants to suppress them, what can you do to me!”

Long Chi gave an angry roar. With his Heavenly Emperor pressure suddenly releasing, he was about to make a move against Ye Yuan.

“Stop!” Dragon Lord cried out, directly making a move to stop Long Chi.

Long Chi’s face fell and he said angrily, “What’s the meaning of this, Dragon Lord? This boy can’t be killed, but could it be that the others can’t be suppressed either? As Raindragon Stronghold’s protector elder, could it be that this Emperor doesn’t even have this bit of authority?”

Dragon Lord’s two eyes narrowed, and she said in a cold voice, “Long Chi, be more clear-minded! You open your eyes and take a look at his glabella!”

Long Chi was taken aback when he heard that and looked over toward Ye Yuan once more.

With this careful look, his pupils could not help constricting!

“Heavenly Dragon Mark!” Long Chi cried out in surprise.

He was being mocked by Ye Yuan earlier and under his rage, he did not detect the mark at Ye Yuan’s glabella.

Upon looking at this time, he could not help breaking out in cold sweat.

Ye Yuan was originally planning on flashing his identity and requesting Dragon Lord to take action. He did not expect that Long Chi was actually very apprehensive of the mark on his glabella.

“That’s right, it’s precisely the Heavenly Dragon Mark! Seeing the Heavenly Dragon Mark is akin to seeing the ancestor! If you keep on pestering endlessly, even I can’t protect you too!” Dragon Lord said in a solemn voice.

Long Chi’s face was like a chameleon’s, changing again and again.

This fellow made a trip into the Dragon Eye Cave. Not only did he break through to Empyrean Realm, he actually even obtained the Heavenly Dragon Mark!

Long Chi could not help feeling depressed. What on earth had he done!

Wasn’t it said that the Dragon Eye Cave was a hopeless land? Why was it that this guy seemed to have been enlightened after going in, swapping a fowling piece for a big gun in ten years?

Long Chi’s current mood was already unable to use words to describe.

Finally, Long Chi gritted his teeth and gave a deep bow to Ye Yuan, and said, “Long Chi pays respect to Son of the Heavenly Dragon!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan was very surprised. He also did not expect that this mark was actually so useful.

The other Heavenly Emperors as well as Empyreans bowed down one after another.

“We pay respects to the Son of the Heavenly Dragon!”

Ye Yuan looked towards the Dragon Lord and asked, “What does this Heavenly Dragon Mark represent?”

Dragon Lord said in surprise, “You don’t know?”

Ye Yuan shook his head.

Dragon Lord was speechless and explained: “The Heavenly Dragon Mark is the dragon race’s supreme existence, a recognition given to a junior, representing that he has hopes of becoming a Transcendent Heavenly Emperor! This is also a symbol of identity in the Dragon Clan, being called the Son of the Heavenly Dragon! The position of Son of the Heavenly Dragon is equivalent to a heaven stronghold’s dragon lord. Even if a Heavenly Emperor sees, they would have to pay respects too!”

Ye Yuan was also struck dumb when he heard. This tiny mark actually represented such a lofty status.

But very soon, a hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and he said, “Then ... do I have the authority to impose sanctions on him?”

While talking, Ye Yuan pointed at Long Chi with his finger.

Long Chi’s expression turned stiff, his face becoming extremely ugly.

A hint of delight also flashed across Dragon Lord’s eyes, and she said with a nod, “That’s of course! Long Chi, why haven’t you made apologies and asked for punishment from the Son of the Heavenly Dragon?”

Long Chi was exasperated in his heart!

At this very moment, he finally experienced what was called shooting oneself in the foot.

He cracked himself up to be clever, forcing Ye Yuan into the Dragon Eye Cave.

In the end, Ye Yuan came out, becoming the Son of the Heavenly Dragon!

Son of the Heavenly Dragon, the status was equivalent to a heaven stronghold’s dragon lord; how noble was the status?

Offending the Son of the Heavenly Dragon was equivalent to offending the heaven stronghold’s dragon lord.

Even if he was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, he could not bear this charge either!

“Long Chi ... Long Chi unintentionally offended the Son of the Heavenly Dragon. Long Chi hopes that the Son of the Heavenly Dragon can forgive!” Having no choice, Long Chi could only lower his head.

He discovered with his peripherals that a hint of a strange smile was currently flashing across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, and his heart could not help thumping.

What did this boy want to do?

Humph! Whatever you want to do, I, Long Chi, am an exalted Heavenly Emperor, what can you do to me?

Making apologies to you is already making the greatest concession!

“Forgiveness, that’s impossible. Since you offended me, you naturally have to be punished!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Long Chi pulled a long face and said, “Ye Yuan, don’t reach for a yard after taking an inch!”

Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and said with a cold smile, “Reaching for a yard after taking an inch? Heh, you should rejoice that I’m only Empyrean Realm. If I’m Heavenly Emperor Realm right now, just based on you making a move against Lu-er just now, I’d have long smacked you to death with one slap! You should be very clear why Long Hao was smacked to death by me!”

Not mentioning Long Hao was still fine, upon mentioning Long Hao, Long Chi gnashed his teeth in hatred even more.

This guy killed Long Hao. Now, he even had to lower his head to him. It was truly unprecedented humiliation!

Dragon Lord Long Xiyue said coolly, “Long Chi, you’re very clear about the crime of offending the Son of the Heavenly Dragon. In Raindragon Stronghold, things are still okay. If it’s reported up, the matter probably won’t be so easy to clean up. Furthermore, don’t you forget, he’s Second Sage! Son of the Heavenly Dragon plus Second Sage, huhu ...”

Long Xiyue did not carry on saying, Long Chi should understand her meaning.

Second Sage was indeed nothing in the Dragon Clan. But Second Sage plus Son of the Heavenly Dragon, that was totally different.

The Priest Temple was a titan of the demon race to begin with. Their strength was not much weaker than the Dragon Clan.

These two titles added together, it was equivalent to two great mountains!

Even if Long Chi was a Heavenly Emperor, his outcome would be very miserable too.

Long Chi sucked in a deep breath and gritted his teeth and said, “Ye Yuan, don’t go too overboard! Forcing a Heavenly Emperor into a life-and-death struggle, you know the consequences!”

Now that it came to this, Long Chi had no choice but to lower his head too, accepting Ye Yuan’s punishment. Even though he was a thousand times unwilling.

But if this matter were to blow all the way up to the top, the consequences would still be too much for him to bear.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said coolly, “Relax, I’ve always repay evil with good. I won’t make things difficult for you.”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s grinning appearance, a bad premonition flashed across in everyone’s hearts.

While Long Xiyu had a curious look. She also really wanted to see what Ye Yuan was going to do.

“You go to the top of the stone tower and yell ten thousand times, ‘Long Chi is a pig!’ this phrase. Mn, need to shout louder. Let the entire stronghold hear,” Ye Yuan said with a beam.

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces revealed strange looks.

Making a Heavenly Emperor do this sort of thing, to think that this guy could think of it.

Dragon Lord nearly failed to hold it in and spurted out, hurriedly covering her mouth and laughing.

Long Chi’s face changed and he roared angrily, “Brat, you ... you’re bullying people too far!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Bullying people too far? Huhu! This matter was caused by Long Hao. Who’s right and who’s wrong, don’t you have any idea in your heart? When you coerced me to enter the Dragon Eye Cave with Lu-er their lives, why didn’t you say bullying people too far? When you made a move to deal with Lu-er, why didn’t you say bullying people too far? Now, just making you yell a bit, you’re saying that I’m bullying people too far? Not doing? Also can, I, a mere Empyrean, have no qualifications to make a Heavenly Emperor do anything. But there will always be someone who will make you do a little something.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan snorted coldly, flicked his sleeves, and left.

“Hold on!” Long Chi’s face changed, stopping Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan stopped his figure and said coolly, “Ten thousand times, not a single time less!”

Long Chi nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood. He had not spoken yet and this boy already blocked off his words.
