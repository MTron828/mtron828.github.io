Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“How arrogant! Although this guy has some potential, wanting to surpass Jia Chong, he’s probably still a little too tender.”

“Looking at Jia Chong’s strength, he’ll also be top three no matter what in the third round, right? Overall strength being so powerful, Ye Yuan really dared to say it!”

“Heh, this kid is probably puffed up! I thought that his first round’s results were not bad and could disregard other people. He also doesn’t think about it, even the first round, Jia Chong wasn’t much worse than him either.”

...

Ye Yuan’s words immediately kicked up a wave in the crowd.

These words were rather arrogant!

Ye Yuan’s first round’s performance was indeed eye-catching. But in the second round, he immediately revealed his true colors.

His overall strength was not on the same level as Jia Chong at all.

With two rounds, Ye Yuan’s results already faded into the crowd.

Forget about Jia Chong, even some who were ranked slightly behind also caught up from behind, surpassing him.

“Hahaha ... You really dare to say that?! I want to take a look at how you surpass me! Why not ... let’s compete in the third round, how’s that?” Jia Chong said oppressively.

The third round, Illumination, was about competing on comprehension ability!

Willpower, strength, comprehension ability, this was the true objective of the Wu Meng Academy’s three rounds of assessment.

Only by completely passing the three rounds was one worthy of Wu Meng Academy’s grooming, becoming an official student.

Jia Chong was certain that Ye Yuan was just threatening in manner, but inwardly shaky, and did not dare to compete with him.

Judging from bone age, he was about the same as Ye Yuan.

However, he was grand completion Grotto Profound right now, while Ye Yuan was just middle-stage Grotto Profound.

Just judging from cultivation realm, it was already sufficient to indicate many problems.

Martial Dao willpower this thing was unrelated to cultivation realm. But comprehension ability this thing had considerable relationship with cultivation realm.

Ye Yuan looked at Jia Chong with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Alright, how to compete?”

Jia Chong sneered coldly in his heart. Looks like this guy was puffing himself up at his own cost, stubbornly hanging on till the end.

“Since that’s the case, then let you lose everything! Let you know what’s the outcome of standing up for this trash!” Jia Chong laughed coldly in his heart.

“Compete in points! The one who wins gets all of the other party’s points! Do you dare?” Jia Chong said in an imposing manner.

Ye Yuan was delighted the moment he heard and said with a smile, “Since you’re so generous, then your points, I’ll take it upon myself and accept it.”

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan like looking at a fool, feeling that this guy was really crazy.

Xie Jingyi pulled Ye Yuan’s clothes and whispered, “Brother, I’ve received your kind intentions. But don’t compete with him. You’re not his match. This guy is known as Brilliant Peace City’s number one genius, his comprehension ability being abnormally high! Whatever cultivation methods and martial techniques reach his hands, there’s none that he can’t comprehend!”

Jia Chong laughed loudly and said, “Heard that? Ye Yuan, bragging also depends on the target! Not anyone can proclaim to be a genius!”

But Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him and said to the old man on the platform with cupped fists, “Student Ye Yuan, requests Teacher to be a witness and arrange for a wager agreement with him!”

The old man had long been paying attention to the situation over here. But he did not say anything.

Wu Meng Academy encouraged this kind of competition. Gambling agreements that did not affect the whole, they did not forbid such things. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was just that like today, drawing up a gambling agreement before even entering the sect, it was really not frequently seen.

The old man nodded and said, “Can!”

Ye Yuan’s actions made everyone stunned.

Agreed upon just like this?

This Ye Yuan’s head wouldn’t be defective, right?

“Ye Yuan, this ...”

“Alright, stop being foolishly sentimental! If you’re a man, clear this third round properly, don’t let people look down on you!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Xie Jingyi had remorse and guilt written all over his face. Hearing Ye Yuan say so, he gritted his teeth and said, “You rest assured, I definitely won’t disappoint you! Jia Chong, don’t blame us for bullying you! Teacher, Ye Yuan’s points aren’t enough, so I’ll bet all of my points too! If we win, the points all belong to Ye Yuan; if lose, our points will all go to him!””Access Read.live if you like watching manga,comics.

It was also unknown where Xie Jingyi’s courage came from either, to actually make this kind of decision.

Previously, when he saw Jia Chong, he could not even speak. He did not expect that he actually still had such a hot-blooded side.

The look in Xie Jingyi’s eyes, Jia Chong disliked it a lot!

He suddenly discovered that this opponent he had always looked down on seemed to have really grown up!

“Heh, fools! Since you’re gifting points to me for free, then I’ll accept it! I’ll let you guys know what’s called disparity!” Jia Chong said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan looked at Xie Jingyi rather surprisedly, patted his shoulder, and said with a smile, “Relax, won’t lose. His points, let’s each take half.”

Everyone was speechless. This had not begun yet, and they already started dividing the loot?

This guy was also too condescending.

The old man could not stop sizing up Ye Yuan rather curiously. He very much wanted to see a trace of uneasiness from Ye Yuan’s eyes.

But he was disappointed.

Ye Yuan had an appearance of having a well-thought-out plan, not putting Jia Chong in his sights at all.

He was very perplexed, just where Ye Yuan’s confidence lay.

The second round already thoroughly exposed Ye Yuan’s true standards.

Maybe he had potential, but it was absolutely not as powerful as what he displayed in the first round.

Age similar to Jia Chong, but two minor realms lower than him, the disparity was already very apparent.

Of course, these doubts, he only kept them in his mind. He was very curious to what extent Ye Yuan could do it.

“Alright, being able to walk to this step, everybody already proved your strength. This third round is a test, but to you all, it’s a lucky chance too! How much you can comprehend will depend on your good fortune!” said the old man coolly.

Hearing the old man’s words, everyone’s faces all faintly revealed looks of anticipation.

Three rounds of entrance examinations, this third round was the most mysterious.

Although everyone knew that what this round tested was comprehension ability, they did not know the specifics of the test contents.

Because this third round’s test was strictly confidential to the outside world.

“Now, you all swear a Heavenly Dao Oath, you’re not to reveal anything about this third round’s test contents to the outside! Those unwilling to swear the oath can withdraw right now!” said the old man seriously.

Ye Yuan was also very curious. It looked like the contents of this third round’s test seemed to be rather extraordinary!

Under the old man’s lead, everyone participated in the Heavenly Dao Oath.

“Now, you all return to your respective lotus seats! The test content of this third round is to comprehend a set of cultivation method! The name of this cultivation method is Wu Meng Wargod Formula!” said the old man nonchalantly.

A stone stirred up a thousand-story wave. The old man’s words immediately made the remaining people seethe.

“It’s actually the Wu Meng Wargod Formula! I didn’t expect that we can actually comprehend the Wu Meng Wargod Formula!”

“Wu Meng Wargod Formula is City Lord, His Excellency’s, primary cultivation method! One can cultivate all the way to Divine Lord Realm! No wonder! No wonder this third round’s test content has always been kept confidential to the outside!”

“It’s truly a good fortune of three lifetimes! Being able to comprehend the Wu Meng Wargod Formula, even if eliminated in this round, it’s worth it too!”

“Even if just comprehended a tiny bit, this set of cultivation method is also sufficient to let us benefit for life!”
