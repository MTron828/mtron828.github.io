Chapter 1343: Essence Cultivating Pill

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although he had long guessed a little, the Myriad Treasure Tower being so miserable still made Ye Yuan very surprised.

The Myriad Treasure Tower was a Heavenly Emperor’s business, to actually perform so miserably.

“So, we can only rely on our own efforts?” Ye Yuan said.

Hong Yin nodded helplessly and said, “It’s this logic! But ... they have a Two-star Alchemy God! We can’t win this battle, no matter what!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “A Two-star Alchemy God sounds impressive, but in Jewelhill City, those that can use up to Two-star divine pills, and can afford to use them, how many are there?”

Hong Yin said, “But the Wang Family’s Tier 1 middle-grade divine pills’ quality are all very high. They already squeezed us to the point of death.”

Ye Yuan said with a nod, “En, Tier 1 middle-grade divine pills are indeed a problem. Looks like I’ll have to break through earlier.”

Hong Yin was stupefied, somewhat uncertain what it meant.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Alright, I’ll go and meet Tower Lord. Oh, right, is Miss Wanru still alright?”

Mentioning Miss Wanru, Hong Yin smiled and said, “Couldn’t be better! Miss Wanru’s martial arts talent is really very incredible. Her strength already surpassed mine now!”

Ye Yuan’s brows shot up, and he said, “She improved so quickly?”

Liang Wanru breaking through to the Deity Realm was also just a matter of these few decades. But Hong Yin was a Deity Realm powerhouse long ago.

In a short few decades, Liang Wanru surpassed Hong Yin. This kind of improvement speed could be described using terrifying.

Hong Yin suddenly changed to a wistful expression and said, “Yeah, I’m already no longer Wanru’s match now! I say, Sir, you saved Wanru and also discarded her to one side without caring. It doesn’t seem to be too good to her, right? Our Wanru thinks about you every day until she’s infatuated!”

Ye Yuan was stunned when he heard that, shook his head, and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. This Ye’s heart is long committed already. I saved Miss Wanru just because she’s my savior and didn’t mix in the feelings of men and women.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan directly turned around and left, leaving Hong Yin behind with a bitter smile.

Ye Yuan felt his head swell too. His own affairs had yet to be sorted out, did not expect to leave behind a love debt again here.

It was just that Liang Wanru was his savior, Ye Yuan could not sit by idly and remain indifferent no matter what.

He owed Li-er and Mu Lingxue too much and could no longer accommodate others in his heart.

“Looks like I’ll have to reduce contact with Miss Wanru in the future. Otherwise, she’ll probably fall deeper and deeper,” Ye Yuan muttered to himself helplessly.

When Yang Rui saw Ye Yuan, it was like seeing a bright light in the darkness.

“Oh my! Younger Brother Ye, if you still didn’t leave seclusion, our Myriad Treasure Tower would have to close down shop for good!” Yang Rui pulled Ye Yuan and said.

Under this situation currently, Ye Yuan was his only hope.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Tower Lord need not worry. The Myriad Treasure Tower’s matters, I’ve already learned from Hong Yin there.”

Yang Rui’s gaze glinted. At first it was a pleasant surprise. But very soon, it was doubt again as he said, “You really have a way? But ... it seems like there’s still a very long way to go from the middle-stage Grotto Profound!”

Want to refine Tier 1 middle-grade divine pills, one naturally required their strength to reach the middle-grade Grotto Profound first.

The disparity between Deity Realm powerhouses was too great. Wanting to leap realms and refine divine pills, that was virtually something impossible.

After Ye Yuan cultivated the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, his realm did not increase, but fell instead, looking almost the same as before he went into closed-seclusion.

Therefore, Yang Rui expressed doubt toward Ye Yuan’s words.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Tower Lord rest assured, you just send the word out. Our Myriad Treasure Tower is going to roll out a brand new Tier 1 divine pills. The effects are double compared to the Essence Increasing Pill, the price unchanged! Additionally, this kind of medicinal pill is available in all varieties, from low-grade to divine-grade!”

Every time Ye Yuan said a word, Yang Rui would be a degree shocked in his heart.

Essence Increasing Pill was a medicinal pill that middle-stage Grotto Profound used to cultivate. The medicinal efficacy was even greater than the Divine Essence Pill.

When martial artists took Divine Essence Pills until it had no more effect, they would normally choose to buy Essence Increasing Pills.

The journey of cultivation, without the assistance of medicinal pills, it was as hard as ascending to heaven.

Not many had Ye Yuan’s heaven-defying means, to be able to refine divine-grade medicinal pills unceasingly.

Hence, they could only purchase higher-level medicinal pills.

Talking solely on medicinal effects, the medicinal effects of divine-grade Divine Essence Pills were about the same as high-grade Essence Increasing Pills.

However, divine-grade Divine Essence Pills were much more expensive than high-grade Essence Increasing Pills. The reason was that divine-grade medicinal pills could be consumed limitlessly.

It was just that to the vast majority of martial artists, divine-grade medicinal pills were just of little help.

Even if they could afford divine-grade Divine Essence Pills, it was also not possible to consume it long-term.

Therefore, divine-grade medicinal pills were generally just a gimmick. Those who really purchased them were actually not many.

After Wang Xuanfeng came to the Wang Family, he rolled out several kinds of heaven-grade Tier 1 middle-grade divine pills, which were naturally very popular.

Jewelhill City’s alchemists purely had to hit the jackpot to refine heaven-grade divine pills.

But Ye Yuan actually said that he was going to launch a brand new kind of Tier 1 divine pills. This made Yang Rui shocked until his jaws dropped.

“Younger Brother Ye, you ... you can’t joke around with me, right? D-Double the effect of the Essence Increasing Pill? Why have I never heard of such a medicinal pill before?”

Yang Rui felt that Ye Yuan must be joking.

Even in Wu Meng Capital City, the cultivation medicinal pills that middle-stage Grotto Profound used were also Essence Increasing Pills.

He had never heard before what kind of medicinal pill’s medicinal properties was double that of the Essence Increasing Pill!

Furthermore, the price was even the same as the Essence Increasing Pill.

This was truly too fantastical.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “It’s also very normal for Tower Lord to not have heard of it before. This divine pill’s name is called Essence Cultivating Pill. This Ye saw this medicinal pill in a very ancient classic record. If Tower Lord feel worried about this Ye, then Tower Lord can also promote it again after waiting for this Ye to refine it.”

Ye Yuan giving Yang Rui a heads-up right now was naturally in order to garner eyeballs and let the Essence Cultivating Pill’s temperature heat up first.

This way, it was naturally beneficial to the Myriad Treasure Tower’s business.

If launching it after refining, they would naturally lose the initiative in terms of time.

Actually, this Essence Cultivating Pill was not what Ye Yuan saw in some records. It was not even taught to him by Dustless.

This Essence Cultivating Pill was a pill formula Ye Yuan created when he entered Dao with alchemy!

Ye Yuan never adhered rigidly to pill formulas when refining pills.

The majority of alchemists, when refining pills, all of them refined according to pill formulas, familiarizing with the medicinal properties through pill formulas.

But Ye Yuan’s focus was always on the spirit medicines, comprehending pills formulas with spirit medicines as the foundation.

If not for so, he would also be unable to create the Dao Defying Pill, that kind of heaven-defying pill formula.

When at the Immortal Grove Region, he already created numerous pill formulas.

Now, Ye Yuan entered Dao with alchemy, creating the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, this cultivation method, his understanding toward Alchemy Dao also became even deeper.

Coupled with that, he already fully grasped those several thousand kinds of Tier 1 spirit medicines’ medicinal properties, creating a few pill formulas was nothing much to Ye Yuan.

The Essence Cultivating Pill was one of them.

Yang Rui’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “Younger Brother Ye, this brother doesn’t mean that, don’t you misunderstood me! It’s just that Younger Brother’s words are too shocking, that’s why this brother would be so astonished.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Tower Lord don’t have to stand on ceremony. For this Ye to be able to have today, it was all thanks to the Myriad Treasure Tower. This Ye isn’t someone who shows ingratitude for kindness, why would I get angry because of this small matter?”
