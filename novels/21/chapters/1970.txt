Chapter 1974: Black Corpse and Green Corpse

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Ye Yuan and the rest unleashed all of their means, bombarding that cluster of black entities indiscriminately.

But those black entities did not get the least bit of wound.

This time, Ye Yuan saw clearly. This cluster of black entities looked like a group of black apes, black hair growing all over their bodies, with their mouths revealing sharp tusks.

They were neither human nor ghost, being hideously horrifying.

Furthermore, the defensive power of these guys was extremely formidable. Just now, he utilized the Stellar War Banner, and it actually did not leave behind any marks on their bodies.

“B-Black corpse!” Song Yu looked at that group of black things, his complexion deathly pale as he said.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Black corpse? What’s that?”

Song Yu’s expression was ugly as he said, “After martial artists die, their corpses will undergo all sorts of unusual changes under some special environments. This kind of black corpse is the hardest to tangle with. Its defensive power is extremely fearsome. It is akin to a wall of bronze or iron, being impervious to swords and spears, as well as virtually immune to divine essence attacks!”

Ye Yuan only came to a realization after he heard that.

These black corpses were also around Second Firmament True God Realm, but their defensive power could virtually rival him.

Encountering this sort of thing was indeed very troublesome.

Furthermore, the speed of this thing was extremely fast; unable to shake off at all.

A hint of a smile suddenly flashed across Ye Yuan’s face.

Competing on the physical body?

Huhu!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan put away the Stellar War Banner and said to Song Yu, “You protect them, leave these guys to me.”

Song Yu was stunned and said, “Leave them to you?”

He knew that Ye Yuan cultivated the body and martial arts concurrently. But Ye Yuan’s fleshy body power was also merely comparable to First Firmament True God. So how was he to fight with so many black corpses?

Just as Song Yu was in a daze, Ye Yuan already shot out like an arrow that left the bow.

Bang!

It was only to hear a dragon roar sound out. A black corpse in front of him was blasted until it flew straight out backward.

“Awoo!”

The black corpse let out a shrill scream, extremely ear-piercing in this fog.

Song Yu and everyone’s pupils constricted, looking at this scene in great astonishment.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Ye Yuan’s fists were unleashed like the wind, each punch hitting the flesh, unfolding a fierce close quarter fight with seven to eight black corpses.

From time to time, those black corpses emitted shrill screams, making people shudder with fear. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Inside the fog, Extreme Luck’s people were long already dumbfounded with amazement looking at the blurry shadows.

“How ... How can his fleshy body actually be so fearsome?” Guo Jingyang said.

“Yeah, his fleshy body is clearly only comparable to a First Firmament True God, but this combat power is actually able to thrash those Second Firmament True God black corpses! No wonder when he was among the battle spirit army, those battle spirits could not get close to him at all,” Ma Chang also said in surprise.

This fleshy body strength already completely exceeded their imaginations.

On combat power and defensive power, Ye Yuan far surpassed same rank powerhouses, and he was even a magnitude stronger compared to a Second Firmament True God.

They reckoned that even if Ye Yuan did not borrow the power of empyrean spirit treasures, violently thrashing Second Firmament True Gods was also nothing difficult.

In the crowd, Liu Yi’s gaze suddenly turned intent. As if recalling something, he cried out in surprise, “It’s the perfect sixth transformation golden body! Ye Yuan must have cultivated the perfect sixth transformation golden body!”

“What?! Perfect sixth transformation golden body? This ... How is this possible?” Song Yu cried out in surprise.

Everyone knew how difficult cultivating the perfect sixth transformation golden body was, and how dangerous it was.

This sort of thing was practically impossible to happen.

However, apart from the perfect sixth transformation golden body, they could not find any reason to explain everything before their eyes.

Ye Yuan fighting one-versus-eight, actually beat until these black corpses wailed in pain.

This combat power was simply off the charts.

However, just as everyone was in shock, they did not detect that danger was already quietly closing in.

Ever since Ye Yuan reached the grand completion of Dao Realm, his divine soul was much stronger than those in the same rank.

Suddenly, he had a foreboding feeling well up in his heart, and he could not help yelling loudly, “Careful, there’s danger!”

When Song Yu and the rest heard that, they could not help being startled inwardly, immediately going on alert. But it was already too late.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Eight green shadows arrived in front of them like ghosts.

Song Yu’s expression changed drastically. There was no time to think much. He suddenly hacked out more than a hundred streaks of sword lights.

But the speed of each of those green shadows was too fast, he was actually unable to lock on.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

There were three green shadows who were directly bombarded flying away.

But there were still five green shadows that rushed into the squad.

The other few people also each used their means, wanting to resist.

But their strength was ultimately much worse off compared to Song Yu.

“Ahh! Save me!”

A scream came over. One of the people was directly hauled away by the five green shadows, having no time to even resist.

“Explode for me!”

Right at this time, a roar suddenly came over. The power of stars suddenly unleashed, and it actually reached first despite launching later!

Those five green shadows were directly blown up by Ye Yuan’s Stellar War Banner.

It turned out that Ye Yuan had already finished off those eight black corpses and arrived in the nick of time to save people.

“So stinky!”

All of a sudden, a fishy stench came over. Those green monsters that were blown apart had green juices flowing all over the ground.

Ye Yuan held his breathing and asked, “Hu Fei, are you alright?”

The current Hu Fei was still suffering from the shock. Only after hearing Ye Yuan’s words did he suddenly startle awake. Shaking his head, he said, “I-I’m fine, thank you, Ye Yuan!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Since all of us are companions, there is no need to be too courteous. These monsters come and go like shadows inside the fog. It’s impossible to guard against them entirely. Everybody, be more careful.”

Song Yu similarly had not recovered from the shock yet. Just now, the speed of those green monsters, each one was too fast. If not for his strength being above the average person, he would likely have been hit already too.

Suddenly, his expression changed, and he said, “I got it! Ye Yuan, these are green corpses!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Green corpses?”

Song Yu nodded and said, “Green corpses are also a kind of corpse variant. What it likes the most is to suck human blood. These green corpses’ whereabouts are strange, making us unable to guess. It can even transform into a human form. But its greatest weakness is that its defensive power is very weak. The one who sucked Qian Feng’s blood dry previously was likely a green corpse!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Black corpse then green corpse, this place really has strange things of every variety!”

Song Yu’s expression suddenly changed, and he said, “Not good! The blood of green corpses is poisonous! Hu Fei he ...”

When everyone heard that, their faces all changed, looking over at Hu Fei.

“Hu Fei, you ...” Guo Jingyang cried out in shock.

Hu Fei was also stunned and asked doubtfully, “W-What’s wrong with me?”

His face already started rotting, becoming incomparably hideous. But he seemed to be completely clueless.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he roared loudly, “Hu Fei, open your mouth!”

At this point, Ye Yuan already quietly replaced Song Yu’s position, becoming everyone’s backbone.

In his one sentence, Hu Fei instinctively opened his mouth.

Whoosh!

A medicinal pill flew straight into his mouth, melting the moment it entered his mouth!

Then, everyone saw that the places that were rotting on his face and body were actually recovering frenziedly.

One side was rotting, one side was recovering.

Two overbearing forces crossed swords fiercely inside Hu Fei’s body.

Hu Fei screamed miserably. He fell to the ground, and he started rolling about in agony.
