Chapter 1730 Skydemon Mountain Range

Skydemon Mountain Range stretched for goodness knows several hundreds of millions of miles. Countless great demons were hidden inside.Connected together with the Skydemon Mountain Range was the Demon God Plain.

The Skydemon Mountain Range and Demon God Plain together formed the entire Demon Divine Region.

This place was a paradise for the demon race.

At this time, six plain-clothes martial artists were currently moving inside the Skydemon Mountain Range.

A lean middle-aged man said with an unhappy look, “I say, Boss Duan, why do we need to bring along a Third Firmament Divine Lord trash?”

His voice was very loud and did not have the intention of covering it up. Clearly, it was deliberately said for people to hear.

Boss Duan looked at the young man walking quietly behind the team and said helplessly, “No choice. Recently, the savage beasts in the Skydemon Mountain Range seems to be abnormally irritable. The people willing to enter the mountain are not many in the first place. It so happens that I acted slow this time. The strong ones were all snatched by other teams already.”

The lean middle-aged man previously said unhappily, “Boss Duan, the logic of better to go without than have something shoddy, don’t you know? Bringing such a trash over, can he be of help? Later, he even wants to divide up our natural treasures. Isn’t this picking up a bargain for free?”

“Alright, Luo Yong, already came, what’s the use of saying this? An additional person is always an additional portion of strength.”

At this time, a beautiful woman in the team could not listen anymore and came out to mediate things.

This girl was called Yu Jing, the sole female in the team. She was a peak Fifth Firmament Divine Lord.

Seeing Yu Jing speak, Luo Yong immediately changed to an ingratiating expression and said with a smile, “Heh heh, Young Sister Jing already spoke, then I won’t pursue it anymore as well. If not looking on the account of Younger Sister Jing’s face, this Luo definitely wouldn’t have come this time. However, if this kid doesn’t put in any effort and still wants to take a share of the loot, this Luo won’t agree to it no matter what!”

Boss Duan said, “I’ve long talked to Brother Ye about this, don’t you worry.”

Luo Yong gave a cold snort and stopped talking.

Yu Jing moved to the young man’s side and whispered, “Little Brother Ye Yuan, this Luo Yong is like this. He can’t suffer any losses at all. You don’t take it to heart.”

This young man was naturally the Ye Yuan who came from afar.

He originally wanted to enter the Skydemon Mountain Range alone. But under Dustless’s persuasion, he still gave up.

There were many hunting small teams in the Skydemon Mountain Range, one person was too conspicuous.

The strength that Ye Yuan exhibited was not strong either. It would attract quite a few people’s covetous eyes. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Even though Ye Yuan was not afraid, it would be better to avoid troubles.

Moreover, these hunting teams were very familiar with the Skydemon Mountain Range’s situation. Which place was relatively safe, which place was relatively dangerous, they were very clear of it.

Following them would allow him to understand some of the Skydemon Mountain Range’s situation first.

Otherwise, diving into some great demon’s territory headlong, even if Ye Yuan had three heads and six arms, he would also die until he could not be any more deader.

In the nearby Linyao Imperial City, there were places that specifically recruited martial artists.

This kind of team was formed temporarily.

Boss Duan’s name was Duan Peng. He was a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord.

When he wanted to enter the mountain, he would go to the recruiting place to select martial artists and find a few good men to help.

Of course, he would also negotiate the prices with these recruiters.

The natural treasures obtained in the Skydemon Mountain Range naturally had to allocate some to them as well.

With Ye Yuan’s Third Firmament Divine Vortex Realm, naturally no one took fancy to him in the city.

If not for having to pick the leftovers, Boss Duan would not even give Ye Yuan a glance.

Ye Yuan smiled and said to Yu Jing, “Thank you, Elder Sister Jing, for helping me out of the predicament.”

Yu Jing smiled and said, “I say, kid, your nerves are also really plucky, to actually dare promise Boss Duan! The place that he wants to go to isn’t where you can go. If my surmises are right, you should be some large family clan’s disciple, coming to the Skydemon Mountain Range to train, right?”

In this Skydemon Mountain Range, the level of strength naturally determined the different places that could be penetrated deep.

Those like Ye Yuan, even though they would not just hang around the peripherals, it was clearly far from the place that Duan Peng was going.

“Yes, it’s this younger brother’s first time entering the Skydemon Mountain Range. I’m totally clueless about this place. Can Elder Sister Jing tell me and let me gain some knowledge and experience?”

Ye Yuan pushed the boat along the current, requesting Yu Jing to tell him about the Skydemon Mountain Range’s knowledge.

Yu Jing seemed to be very close towards Ye Yuan, this next-door-little-brother. Hence, she started to talk endlessly.

Hearing Yu Jing’s explanation, Ye Yuan also gleaned considerable gains.

Yu Jing’s experiences were all gained by her predecessors, and at times, their lives. The things she shared with Ye Yuan were very valuable.

Where was safe, where was dangerous, which places could be gone to, which places could not be gone to, it was all very detailed.

A moment of carelessness and it would be eternal damnation.

The great demons in this Skydemon Mountain Range even had Heavenly Emperor level existences. The dangers involved could be imagined.

Of course, that sort of place, the average person was unable to approach it at all and would die at the peripherals until not even dregs remained.

The two talked happily along the way, but there was an unfriendly gaze by the side, constantly casting over toward Ye Yuan’s side.

Luo Yong was clearly interested in Yu Jing, so his impression of Ye Yuan would definitely be even worse.

“Hey, kid, stop asking questions anymore! Right now, we’ve already entered a dangerous zone and might run into fierce beasts any time, you shut your mouth up for me!”

Luo Yong could not hold back and came up to interrupt the two people’s conversation.

Ye Yuan had not spoken yet, but Yu Jing lost it first.

“Luo Yong, it’s Ye Yuan’s first time coming to the Skydemon Mountain Range, but is it my first time coming too?”

Luo Yong could not help choking and said in a solemn voice, “Younger Sister Jing, the Skydemon Mountain Range hasn’t been too peaceful recently. Who knows whether there are high-level fierce beasts haunting in the vicinity or not?”

Yu Jing could not help feeling stifled when she heard this. What Luo Yong said was reasonable too.

At present, it was not very peaceful in the Skydemon Mountain Range. Situations where squads were completely wiped out would frequently appear.

Their voices had yet to fade when rustling sounds came from the woods.

Everyone’s faces changed, each drawing their weapons, an appearance of facing a great enemy.

Suddenly, an enormous black centipede slowly sprung out of the woods.

When everyone saw the centipede, they immediately relaxed.

“Gave me a scare, turns out that it’s a Raging Fire Centipede that just entered middle-stage rank four!” Luo Yong heaved a sigh in relief.

This black centipede was roughly equivalent to Fourth Firmament Divine Lord martial artists. Their group was naturally not afraid.

Suddenly, Luo Yong thought of something, a hint of a smug smile flashed across the corners of his mouth.

He said to Ye Yuan, “Brat, this centipede isn’t strong, you go take care of it.”

Yu Jing’s expression changed and she said, “Luo Yong, what’s the meaning of this? How can Ye Yuan’s strength possibly deal with this Raging Fire Centipede?”

Luo Yong shrugged and said, “The fierce beasts that we encounter, this is probably the weakest already. This kid is at any rate peak Third Firmament Divine Lord as well, doesn’t he want to train? Don’t even dare to deal with a Raging Fire Centipede, still train for what?! Moreover, we have so many people here. How can we watch him go and still die in the end? Boss Duan, don’t you say so?”

Duan Peng cursed in his heart, this guy was really insidious.

But what Luo Yong said, he really had no way of refuting it.

Duan Peng was just about to open his mouth but heard Ye Yuan say coolly, “Fine, I’ll go.
