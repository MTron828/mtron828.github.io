Chapter 2256: Paying Back in His Own Coin!

Such a showdown made people watch until they became bedazzled.

The Eight-star Formation Gods by the side had long already watched until they were intoxicated.

Each and every one of them opened their eyes wide, fearful of missing the slightest detail.

Array formations were dead, people were living.

The battle of magics between two peak Formation Dao experts was just like an educational competition to them.

How could concentrating on studying here for them be as directly beneficial as watching two top experts demonstrating personally?

The two people changed positions, the height of them scaling got higher and higher.

Ye Yuan did his best to hold on under Heavenly Eye’s powerful attacks.

Riverword two people followed behind. Even their breathing was practically about to stop.

“This kid can really endure it. He’s not dead until now!”

“Truly a shame. The restrictions in front, I haven’t comprehended yet. I already have no way of keeping up with them.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“They already fought to the height of 2600 over miles. The restrictions up there are also getting more and more dangerous. I reckon that that punk can’t hold on much longer.”

... ...

The two people’s showdown in magical abilities already passed eight days and eight nights in a blink.

During this period, Ye Yuan guarded against Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s frenzied attacks, making everyone’s jaws drop.

In other people’s view, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye had clearly already squeezed Ye Yuan to the limit. Ye Yuan had the possibility of tumbling at any time.

But Ye Yuan held in there just like this for eight days and eight nights!

During these eight days and eight nights, both parties scaled a height of more than 2000 miles.

Eight Void Mountain’s array formations, above 2800 miles were Deva Realm grand arrays!

Except, in the midst of such a confusing battle, nobody discovered that Ye Yuan’s eyes became brighter and brighter.

In these eight days and eight nights, Ye Yuan’s comprehension of Formation Dao could virtually catch up to the total sum of all his previous comprehensions already!

Over 60 years of comprehending Dao made Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao be remolded anew.

And these eight days and nights of comprehension let Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao scaled new heights!

Especially that Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye had an original view of the comprehension of Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions.

Ye Yuan and him battling in magical abilities were equivalent to corroborating his comprehensions with the other party.

The two of their relationship was like an extremely wise master guiding the disciple step by step.

Ye Yuan’s method of comprehending Formation Dao followed the same pattern as Alchemy Dao.

These complex to the extreme array formation restrictions were merely just one foundational array formation after another in Ye Yuan’s eyes.

No matter how complicated the array formation, it was merely arranging these foundational array formations in an extremely ingenious method, making the power increase greatly from there.

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s speed of comprehending array formations far surpassed the average person.

Back then at Fiendflame Mountain, Ye Yuan was able to deconstruct the rank eight grand array with an extremely fast speed because of this.

However, his own comprehension was one aspect. Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s comprehension was another aspect.

Those able to reach Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s boundary all strode out their own ‘Dao’.

In the eyes of ten thousand people, there were ten thousand stories.

The same array formation restrictions, the things that different people comprehended were naturally different.

Paying back in his own coin was able to let Ye Yuan’s comprehensions towards these array formations be even deeper, and could even pry into the source of the person who set up the formations!

The reason why he provoked Heavenly Eye, the objective also lay precisely here.

There was indeed disparity between him and Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye. But the gap between them was far smaller than others imagined.

While Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye was strong until it made people despaired, wanting to kill Ye Yuan was absolutely not such an easy matter too.

At least, one would have to reach the height above 2800 miles too!

But, when they fought until above 2800 miles, Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao strength was another boundary.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye did not know what it meant, unleashing attacks frenziedly.

While Ye Yuan fell back little by little, letting Heavenly Eye think that he reached his limit and could finish him off very quickly.

Actually, his current Formation Dao strength could no longer be mentioned in the same breath as when he was at the foot of the mountain long ago!

It was just that nobody knew.

Everyone thought that Ye Yuan was about to die, but they did not know that he was accumulating strength to deal Heavenly Eye three people a lightning blow!

Ye Yuan did not come to Eight Void Mountain at random. Along the way, he had already planned everything out.

The array formations here were formidable to the extreme. As long as his Formation Dao strength was strong enough, he could completely rely on the array formations here to exterminate Deva Realm powerhouses!

And what he wanted to do was to make someone suffer from their own scheme!

Along the way, Ye Yuan already determined from the clues and inklings that this Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye was absolutely not to be trifled with.

Therefore, he did it very carefully.

Along the way up the mountain, Ye Yuan advanced gradually and entrenched himself at every step, feigning an appearance of gradually not being able to hold out.

He had once laid down array formations, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye should have some understanding of his strength.

If he did it too fiercely, it would give himself away instead.

Therefore, he used the technique of concealing his strength and let Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye think that he was almost reaching his limits little by little.

He was continuously comprehending array formations. But towards the back, he shrunk his defensive circle and let Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye think that his comprehension was getting harder and harder.

But his true strength was advancing by leaps and bounds!

Shui Yuan and Lonesoul were still unaware. Seeing Ye Yuan’s defensive circle already being compressed to the limit, they could not help being greatly excited.

“Hahaha ... brat, aren’t you very capable? This emperor wants to see when you can last until!” Shui Yuan said with a big laugh.

Lonesoul also said, “Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye, double up! Make this brat turn to ashes!”

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye nodded his head slightly and said in a clear voice, “Boy, the array formations here are already almost reaching the limits of Eight-star Formation Gods. Your strength should be about this much, right? Any further up and you’ll die beyond a doubt!”

Roughly 2000 miles, there was the boundary between Eight-star Formation Gods and those who surpassed Eight-star Formation Gods.

Surpassing 2000 miles was the domain of Deva Realm!

Under this, even if Deva Realm powerhouses accidentally set off restrictions, they could also rely on powerful strength to hang in there and not die.

But any further up and the power of the restrictions would soar exponentially.

Once a Deva Realm powerhouse set it off, they would die without a doubt!

Ye Yuan was still unconvinced as he said, “Humph! Three old fogeys! If you have the capabilities, breach my defensive circle before talking!”

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye laughed loudly and said, “This Deva comprehended Dao on Eight Void Mountain. It’s akin to walking on flat ground below 3000 miles. How can it be something that you, this brat, can compare to? Just you watch! This Deva will breach your defensive circle and let you die without a burial ground!”

While talking, Ye Yuan already broke through the distance of 2000 miles.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye laughed loudly, suddenly firing out countless streams of divine essence, the power even skyrocketing several times.

Ye Yuan’s defensive circle was compressed to the extreme all of a sudden.

In the restrictions that he was at, there was virtually no place to stop for a rest already!

At this moment, Ye Yuan and the others were placed in jeopardy!

However, Ye Yuan similarly fired out countless streams of divine essence like mirages, barely managing to clear this dangerous hurdle.

Except, everyone could tell that Ye Yuan probably could not block the next round of attacks anymore.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye three people gave a loud laugh, directly charging past 2800 miles this threshold!

“Brat, prepare to die! Fool, the space above 2000 miles is the place where this emperor can truly put my abilities to good use!” Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye gave a cold laugh. The divine essence that fired out this time even skyrocketed several times!

Deva Realm array formations were incomparably complicated. The array elements were naturally in abundance too, the points that could set off restrictions naturally became increasingly more.

At this point, he was a hero with no place to display his prowess!

However, right at this moment, Ye Yuan’s fingers moved like phantoms, firing out countless streams of divine essence.

The numbers were above Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye!

The unexpected eruption made the entire Eight Void Mountain fall into shock!
