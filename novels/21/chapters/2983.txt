Chapter 2982: Scarletplume’s Terrifying Ability!

“In over 200 years, several thousand major and minor battles, not a single defeat! He grew from a little fellow who was unknown to the public into a powerhouse that daunts people! Of course, the scariest thing about this kid isn’t his battle result of flawless victories, but his terrifying learning ability! After each battle, his improvement would be very shocking.”

“Don’t look at how he’s only 21st place. What his opponents ranked in front of him are most afraid of is his challenge! This kid is destined to stand at the summit! In the future, regardless of whether or not he can enter Heavenly Dragon Island, he’s definitely able to step into the realm of Hegemon! Therefore, this man that you’re interested in doesn’t have any chance of winning!”

The patriarch had indescribable pride when talking about Scarletplume.

However, what he said was really very frightening.

Scarletplume’s road to maturity was simply too dazzling.

He was not a genius in the traditional sense, but he was absolutely a terrifying existence.

Going against the wind all the way, achieving his present accomplishments, Scarletplume was simply a miracle.

Feng Qingxuan also had a look of shock on her face. She did not expect that who Ye Yuan challenged was actually such an opponent.

This … was completely looking for abuse!

Boom!

As if affirming what Feng Qingxuan was thinking, Ye Yuan was slammed down by a punch from Scarletplume.

This scene was similar to the one just now.

Previously, Ye Yuan beat Da Yi until he did not have the slightest strength to fight back.

But now, Scarletplume was beating Ye Yuan until he did not have the strength to fight back.

From the beginning until now, Ye Yuan was basically in a situation of being passively beaten.

Scarletplume’s devastation was all-around.

Dragon City Tribe completely boiled over with excitement!

“Lord Scarletplume is really cool to the max!”

“Impressive! Impressive! Impressive! Lord Scarletplume is really an invincible existence!”

“I admit that that punk is very formidable. But it also serves as a foil that Lord Scarletplume is even more formidable like this!”

“Several thousand matches and yet to taste defeat! Who does this punk think he is, to actually dare challenge Lord Scarletplume?”

… …

Being swept away by Ye Yuan for two matches in a row, Dragon City Tribe’s powerhouses felt a loss of face.

But, luckily, they had Lord Scarletplume!

With him around, victory was guaranteed!

“Ground Thorn!”

The mountain full of hubbub could not affect Scarletplume at all.

Only to see him point his fingertips, undulations appeared in space again.

Countless earth spikes suddenly grew out of the earth.

Ye Yuan’s figure was currently falling. Once pierced, he would become a hedgehog.

“Shattering Space!”

Once again, Ye Yuan used this move.

He forcefully used the backlash force and forcibly made his body change directions in the air, avoiding the Ground Thorn.

However, in the next second, Scarletplume was already waiting for him!

“Shattering Space!”

It was only to hear Scarletplume yell out. He actually launched the exact same move as Ye Yuan!

The void shattered!

Tidal water-like energy undulations completely submerged Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was greatly astonished in his heart. Having no time to think too much, a Shattering Space rumbled out again.

Boom!

The void trembled, and Ye Yuan’s figure flew out backward, but Scarletplume did not budge an inch.

Scarletplume looked at Ye Yuan and said calmly, “It turns out that spatial rule can still be applied like this. You really broadened my horizons! Thank you for letting me comprehend a deeper level spatial rule!”

Ye Yuan’s body was covered with scars everywhere.

He did not gain the slightest advantage in this exchange of blows.

Or should one say he was completely being passively beaten?

He did not think that Scarletplume was actually so strong!

What was even more frightening was that the other party’s learning ability was extremely strong.

In the midst of battle, he actually comprehended his Shattering Space move!

Shattering Space this move naturally originated from Mi Tian.

With regards to the understanding of spatial origin, he had no equal in every heaven and myriad worlds.

Mi Tian was just his original name.

His Hegemon title was actually Hegemon Space!

Across the heavens and myriad words, there were numerous powerhouses. It was also not that there were no Hegemons who comprehended spatial origin.

But only Mi Tian was crowned the title of Hegemon Space! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It could be seen how far he walked on this path.

Shattering Space this move was one of Ye Yuan’s trump cards. It had immense power.

But he never expected that Scarletplume actually completely stole it in the midst of battle.

This kind of opponent, it was really his first time encountering in his life.

Ye Yuan had absolute confidence in himself.

He was not proud, but he had never underestimated his own abilities.

Ye Yuan knew that his talent and strength were absolutely not inferior to anyone else.

It was just that he did not expect to actually encounter such a powerhouse in the Dragon City Tribe.

Sure, he could find many excuses, such as his cultivation realm being inferior to his opponent, such as he had engaged in battle consecutively.

But Ye Yuan was not Da Yi. He would not make excuses for himself.

He admitted that in terms of absolute strength, he was inferior to Scarletplume!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan clearly felt that Scarletplume became stronger than at the start, in the midst of battle!

This guy was simply born to fight.

Especially when encountering an opponent like Ye Yuan, it unleashed his potential even more.

Scarletplume’s battle was like playing chess.

You thought of three steps; he already thought of beyond ten steps.

Prediction, application of moves, it was all precise to the extreme.

It was Ye Yuan’s first time feeling helpless!

“No need to thank me! I still have many moves; you can comprehend even more!” Ye Yuan said.

“Then I’ll really have to witness it! I also didn’t expect that you’re really a superb opponent!” Scarletplume said.

Up until now, Scarletplume showed neither joy nor sorrow all along.

He did not pat himself on the back because he had the advantage and was also not overjoyed because he learned the method of utilizing space.

Everything was like it was someone else’s business.

Got to admit, such an opponent was too troublesome.

“World Suppression!”

Ye Yuan threw a punch out. Space fluctuated.

Terrifying force grew stronger and stronger with each layer of space that arose.

A hint of surprise flashed across in Scarletplume’s eyes.

It was as if a shark smelled the scent of blood.

Ye Yuan’s moves had greatly broadened his horizons.

“Oh!”

From below came a series of exclamations.

Clearly, they also felt the terror of this move.

“Shattering Space!”

Scarletplume unleashed this move again.

Boom!

The terrifying energy undulation sent each of them flying.

But the look in Scarletplume’s eyes became incomparably bright.

It was like Ye Yuan opened a new door for him.

“Impressive! Really too impressive! You really make my hot blood boil!” Scarletplume said excitedly.

“Huhu,?saw it? This is Scarletplume! No matter how strong you are, unless you instantly kill him in one move, he’ll always grow stronger in the midst of battle! His opponents were usually much stronger than him. But nobody could beat him! He is naturally born to fight!”

“This kid called Ye Yuan, his comprehension in spatial rule is extremely deep. Shattering Space and World Suppression, the power of these two moves are also ridiculously strong. But Scarletplume will become stronger in this kind of fights! His opponents will always despair because of this!” The patriarch said with a smile.

Feng Qingxuan was silent.

Ye Yuan’s combat power was really strong until it made her extremely surprised.

No matter whether it was Shattering Space or World Suppression, they were both moves that were strong until they made people despair.

But to Scarletplume, they were moves that made his opponents despair!
