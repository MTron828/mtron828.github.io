Chapter 2252: Advancing Gradually and Entrenching Himself at Every Step!

Above the void, several figures flashed away.

In a short half a day’s time, both parties’ distance already shrunk until there were just a few tens of thousands of miles between them.

This distance was already barely enough to let Deva Realm powerhouses attack.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s movement technique was too fast. It was very hard for them to lock onto Ye Yuan.

After attacking, they were bound to be delayed for a while, which would let Ye Yuan slip away.

Moreover, Shui Yuan and Lonesoul two people were both secretly at loggerheads, neither willing to eat a loss.

For caution’s sake, Shui Yuan three people did not unleash attacks.

“Brat, you can’t escape! Stop now and hand over the Limitless God Killing Bow. This emperor can spare you from death!” Lonesoul said in a clear voice.

“Boy, you have exceptional talent! As long as you hand over the Limitless God Killing Bow, not only will this Deva not kill you, I’ll even take you in as a disciple!” Shui Yuan was not willing to show weakness and similarly shouted.

These two people saw that Ye Yuan was young and goaded him with words from time to time.

But Ye Yuan completely ignored them.

By the side, Heavenly Eye smiled coldly and did not speak, secretly cursing the two for being fools.

He had long detected that Ye Yuan was a young man with extremely strong mental capacity and was absolutely not an ordinary person.

From him hiding from the two people’s eyes and ears, then leaving, then setting up restrictions, as well as the spatial node technique, these were all not what the average young man could think of.

This young man did not only have outstanding strength, but his mind was also even meticulous to the extreme.

It was simply a joke for these two people to want to use words to disturb Ye Yuan.

However, he did not expose it either.

Either way, Ye Yuan was already a turtle in the jar. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Sure enough, before long, Ye Yuan’s voice came from in front.

“Are the two of your heads kicked by donkeys? Such idiotic games, better don’t play it in front of this young master! If you have the capability, chase after!”

The moment the two people heard, their faces turned green.

This kid was too arrogant!

“Brat, after this Deva catches you, I’ll definitely let you taste the feeling of a fate worse than death!” Shui Yuan said furiously.

Both parties’ distance got closer and closer!

Over 70 thousand miles!

60 thousand miles!

... ...

20 thousand miles!

10 thousand miles!

At this distance, the two already had sufficient assurance in being able to seriously injury Ye Yuan.

“Brat, you’ll die very horribly!” Lonesoul said with a cold smile.

Finished talking, the two people virtually made their moves at the same time. A terrifying undulation rippled out above the void.

But right at this time, the two people’s faces changed.

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan disappeared!

Heavenly Eye’s expression changed wildly and he said, “Fine lad, truly cunning! This area is an irregular space. In this place, his spatial law is able to unleash its greatest effect! No wonder he suddenly made a detour north! It turns out that this is waiting for us here!”

Only then did Shui Yuan react to it. His expression was grim to the extreme, and he said in a solemn voice, “Damn brat, too despicable!”

Lonesoul said in a cold voice, “After capturing this brat, this Deva will definitely boil him well!”

A duck that entered the mouth had flown away, the two of their fury could be imagined.

With this hold-up, the distance that finally managed to shrink was pulled apart from Ye Yuan once more.

At this point, they did not have other ways too, and could only toughen their scalps and chase.

But upon entering irregular space, their speed suddenly fell, and they no longer traveled ten thousand miles in an instant like before anymore.

To them, it was like driving on a flat road, then suddenly turning into a mountain slope with irregular bumps.

Irregular space was like a maze. It was very easy for people who did not know spatial law to get lost inside.

Even if they were Deva Realm powerhouses, their perception of spatial law was still very blurry.

Their current advancement speed was not even as good as an Empyrean’s advancement speed normally.

The more they could not catch up to Ye Yuan, the more anxious they got.

The more anxious, the slower the speed.

In the end, both parties’ distance pulled further and further apart.

“Damn it! Where on earth did this punk pop out from? How can he be so crafty?” Shui Yuan said in an explosive rage.

Lonesoul smiled coldly and said, “Isn’t it still because you’re too dumb?”

Shui Yuan was greatly enraged when he heard that and said, “I’m dumb? Heh heh, said it like you’re very smart! Even if you know he’s running this way, what methods do you have?”

“Alright, alright, stop arguing! Keep arguing and that punk will be escaping to god knows where! This area of irregular space can’t stop us for long. We’ve already left behind divine sense imprints on his body. Even if he runs to the ends of the world, he can’t escape either! What I’m curious about right now is what on earth does this brat want to do!” Heavenly Eye said with a frown.

Shui Yuan said, “What can he still do? Take it one step at a time! With his bit of strength, even if he runs to the end of the Heavenspan World, he can’t escape the palm of our hands too!”

Lonesoul sneered and said, “Shut your mouth and listen to Brother Heavenly Eye!”

Lonesoul had clearly realized it too. Among the three of them, Heavenly Eye had the sharpest mind.

Heavenly Eye shook his head and said, “I don’t know what he’s trying to do too, but ... with my judgment, this boy absolutely won’t be running around wildly like a headless fly! Chase first! See where he runs to!”

The two people stopped talking, displaying their movement techniques to the limits and continued to pursue.

A day later, Heavenly Eye suddenly felt the divine sense imprint left in Ye Yuan’s body suddenly accelerate.

“That brat already exited the irregular space. He’s heading toward the northwestern direction! Northwest direction, what place can let him shake off our pursuit?” Heavenly Eye frowned and racked his brain.

Hearing Heavenly Eye’s words, the two people were absorbed in thought.

“There are quite a number of dangerous places in the northwest direction, Windless Valley, Sea of Lightning, Blackwater Marsh, are all in this direction. I reckon that he might be thinking of hiding in these dangerous places, make us not dare to chase him further in!” Shui Yuan said.

Heavenly Eye nodded and said, “There’s indeed this possibility! But along the way, there are quite a number of dangerous places. Which one is his target?”

Lonesoul said, “These dangerous places are all the same to him, all death after entering! I reckon that he’ll hide inside when he’s nearby after he’s driven into a corner!”

Heavenly Eye shook his head and said, “Wrong! He definitely has a target! It’s just that we haven’t thought of it yet! This brat is really an interesting opponent!”

Along the way, Heavenly Eye had witnessed many of Ye Yuan’s means, and this actually caused his fighting spirit to set ablaze.

People all said that he opened his heavenly eye. Actually, what people did not know was that with the heavenly eye being opened, the mind’s eye opened!

Using incredible meticulousness to describe him was all too apt.

These countless years, those able to compete with him in intellect, he had not encountered before yet.

It was also precisely by relying on remarkable intellect that no matter which mystic realm he went to, he could scheme against his rivals perfectly.

But along this way, he was plotted against by Ye Yuan dead in his tracks and did not gain any advantage at all.

He had never thought that catching an Empyrean little fellow would actually take so much effort.

This made him have a feeling of humiliation!

Not catching Ye Yuan would likely affect his Dao heart, making him have flaws during his next blight tribulation.

A full four days passed. Only then did Shui Yuan three people come out of the intricate irregular space. This made Shui Yuan three people have a feeling of going nuts.

This area of irregular space was huge, they got lost inside many times before finally finding the exit.

The current Ye Yuan had long already run until he was out of sight.

Suddenly, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye had a flash of inspiration and said in shock, “I got it! This brat is going to Eight Void Mountain!”
