Chapter 2650: Exploded!

Ye Yuan taking the field immediately aroused great expectations.

Casually giving a few words of guidance and it greatly improved a grade three heavenly alchemist’s strength.

This kind of means was simply inconceivable.

Then how was his own strength?

“Three elders, for fairness sake, I suggest this round to collectively refine grade two heavenly pills,” Jiang Li gave a bow to Cui Tong three people as he said.

Cui Tong three people exchanged a glance and said with a nod, “As it ought to be.”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan spoke up, saying, “No need!”

Cui Tong’s brows furrowed and he said, “Grade two heavenly pill and grade three heavenly pill can’t be mentioned in the same breath at all. Even if you can refine a heavenly imperial pill, it’s also much inferior compared to the medicinal pills that they refine. How will you compete with them like this?”

Although the medicinal effects of grade two heavenly imperial pills rivaled grade three heavenly pills, it was not comparable to all grade three heavenly pills.

If not, grade three heavenly pills also would not be called grade three heavenly pills.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’ll refine my grade two heavenly pill; they’ll refine their grade three heavenly pill. If you all feel that my heavenly pill isn’t as good as theirs, just judge it as a loss.”

“Huhu,?what an arrogant kid!”

“What do you think you’re refining? To actually dare look down on us so much!”

“A mere grade two heavenly alchemist is unbelievably arrogant! I want to see how much capability you have!”

… …

The moment the other few cities’ heavenly alchemists heard, they immediately exploded.

Ye Yuan was clearly not taking them seriously!

Cui Tong’s brows furrowed even tighter. He was seriously unable to imagine what basis Ye Yuan had to be so conceited.

Could it be that the grade two heavenly pills he would refine are different from the rest?

“Forget it. Since you insist, do as you say then! I wonder, what kind of grade two heavenly pill do you want to refine?” Cui Tong said.

“Grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!” Ye Yuan still had a calm and collected appearance as he said.

Once again, everyone exploded.

“What the hell? Grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill competing with grade three heavenly pills whose difficulty approaching heavenly imperial pill? Is this kid’s head spoiled?”

“Ha! Haha!?One really can see anything after living a long time! It’s still Your Father’s first time seeing such a mind-boggling grade two heavenly alchemist!”

“Not just that, right? If my guess is correct, Master Jiang Li is probably going to refine a grade three heavenly imperial pill! Even if Master Jiang Li only refines third or fourth grade, it’s also not what the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill can compare to, right?”

… …

The faces of the other eight people, including Jiang Li, all became black as the bottom of a pot.

Did this boy come to mess with them?

Even Cui Tong had a stunned look too.

“Grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, what kind of joke are you making, Young Friend Ye? Could it be that you’re making fun of the few of us?” Cui Tong said with slight anger.

“Whether or not it’s making fun of the few of you, it will naturally be clear to you after the refinement is completed. Isn’t it jumping too fast to a conclusion by talking about these now?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Cui Tong’s brows furrowed tightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “Okay, then this old man will wait and see! But I’ll say the unpleasant things first. If you’re really making fun of the few of us old fellows, we won’t let you off when the time comes!”

“Up to you!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Amidst the questioning voices, this round of alchemy competition began.

Su Yi, Ge Ling, and the rest were long already thunderstruck until they were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.

They even thought that Ye Yuan had some trump card.

Who would have expected that he actually brought out a grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Could this thing win?

They racked their brains and could not figure it out either.

But, once the alchemy competition started, everyone’s gazes were drawn over by Ye Yuan.

Cui Tong three people’s gazes even turned intent, revealing solemn expressions.

“What impressive techniques, this old man actually can’t see through it!” Cui Tong said in surprise.

Another judge said with surprise, “It turns out that grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill can still be refined like this? This old man really broadened my horizons!”

Ye Yuan’s refining technique was extremely complicated and elaborate.

But every move and action carried the lingering charm of ‘Dao’, making people recollect the aftertaste endlessly.

Even if the heavenly alchemists present were fools, they would know that Ye Yuan’s strength was extraordinary too.

But very soon, something that surprised them even more happened.

A surge of Great Dao accumulation descended from the sky!

Boom!

The powerful pressure made everyone’s faces change.

The refinements of Jiang Li and the rest immediately suffered disruption.

Under this surge of Great Dao accumulation, bystanders were not able to contend with it at all.

Boom!

A burnt smell spread out, a heavenly alchemist’s heavenly pill was ruined.

Boom!

Without holding out for long, another person’s pill was ruined too.

For safety’s sake, Jiang Li did not refine a heavenly imperial pill.

Against a grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, just using an ordinary heavenly pill would suffice.

He had the intention of showing off his strength too, to let Ye Yuan take a good look at what was called an alchemy path genius.

But now, under the Great Dao accumulation, even his soul force was somewhat flickering, he could not concentrate at all.

In a short while, he already made several mistakes, severely affecting the quality of the heavenly pill.

The pressure of the Great Dao accumulation became stronger and stronger.

Boom!

Finally, it landed in Ye Yuan’s medicinal cauldron.

Pill formed!

Very soon, Jiang Li finished refining too.

His mood was irritated to the extreme.

He knew that the quality of the heavenly pill was definitely bad.

“Brat, you cheated!” Jiang Li pointed at Ye Yuan and said angrily.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a smile, “The judge hasn’t even said anything. Is it up to you to tell them what to do? If this is considered cheating, then you cheat for me to take a look.”

“Alright, Jiang Li. Ye Yuan didn’t cheat! However, this old man is very curious now, is what you refined really the grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill?” Cui Tong said.

Jiang Li gnashed his teeth in hatred, his face full of indignation.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Whether it is or not, wouldn’t you all know if you take a look.”

As he said, Ye Yuan urged with his palm, a crystal clear heavenly pill flew in front of Cui Tong.

An aura of Great Dao instantly spread out.

“Is … Is this really a grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill?”

“I’ve never heard before that a grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill can be transparent!”

“What a magical refining technique! It’s unheard of!”

… …

Everyone looked at that heavenly pill, all with looks of wonder on their faces.

Cui Tong studied it in detail for a long time, his two eyes almost burrowing into the heavenly pill.

“Have you seen enough, let me look!” Another judge could not resist urging.

With their eyesight, they could naturally perceive this pill’s extraordinary nature and naturally wanted to study it.

True grade had never appeared before in the Land of Heavenly South!

Now that it emerged, it would surely shock the world!

The three people looked it over and over, all not understanding.

Finally, Cui Tong could not resist and placed it on the Cloud Mount Mother Stone.

Ye Yuan just smiled slightly and did not stop it.

Only to see the scale on the Cloud Mount Mother Stone soar to full scale almost instantly.

Then it exploded with a loud bang.

Everyone present turned pale with shock!

The Cloud Mount Mother Stone actually exploded!

Cui Tong stood up suddenly. Looking at Ye Yuan with an astonished expression, he asked, “Young Friend Ye, just what grade is this pill? This old man has never seen before a heavenly pill that could blow up the Cloud Mount Mother Stone!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “This pill is a true grade heavenly pill! Above ninth grade is true grade! I wonder if this true grade heavenly pill can match their grade three heavenly pills or not?”
