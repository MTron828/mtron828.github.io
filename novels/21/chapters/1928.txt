Chapter 1932: Making an Apology

Wang Jian looked at the small medicinal bottle in his hand, being shocked speechless.

“Vast spirit divine pill! This ... How is this possible? This is a level eight difficulty Crimson Fire Nine Brilliance Pill!”

The moment these words came out, the whole crowd was amazed.

Before this, Ye Yuan had once refined vast spirit divine pills. It was just that after arriving at the darkviolet arena, he rarely refined vast spirit divine pills anymore. Even void spirit was seldom refined.

Everyone thought that this was because the difficulty of the medicinal pills grew, Ye Yuan’s strength was no longer sufficient to refine it anymore.

Only now did they know that turns out they all thought wrongly.

A big mistake!

When Ye Yuan exchanged blows with them, he did not even use 30% of his strength.

He was playing around!

Level eight difficulty vast spirit divine pill, what kind of concept was that?

This kind of strength was sufficient to sweep across blackscale level powerhouses.

Blackscale level powerhouses, forget about vast spirit divine pill, even purple spirit divine pills had to depend on luck too.

But Ye Yuan refined a vast spirit divine pill directly.

This disparity was too great!

Could it be that Ye Yuan was already equipped with the strength to become an alchemy celestial level powerhouse?

Thinking up to here, everyone was filled with shock.

Yu Ying looked at this scene in a daze. Until now, he was unable to believe it.

He lost, defeated very thoroughly.

In merely several dozen breaths from start to end, he thoroughly fell apart under Ye Yuan’s tidewater-like offensive.

But Ye Yuan refined a vast spirit divine pill!

This kind of strength was a summit that was far beyond his reach for life.

Ye Yuan slowly came before Yu Ying and said coolly, “Master, please.”

Yu Ying’s entire body trembled, the expression on his face changing again and again.

The reason why he made this bet was that he felt that he would not lose.

But the result was that he was defeated.

Not stepping into Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital in this lifetime, the consequence was too severe to him.

His prospects were great, with hopes of entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion.

But now, everything turned into bubbles.

Seeing that Yu Ying did not react, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Lost and still want to renege, is this Springwind Hall’s style?”

Yu Ying was still silent. It was just that the muscles on his face were twitching. Clearly, he was struggling greatly in his heart.

Going back on his word in front of so many people, how did he still have face to meet people in the future in this Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital?

But making him leave Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital, he was unwilling too.

“Young man, must you compel people like this?” Just as it was awkward, a figure slowly walked out, going up the stage.

Yu Ying’s expression changed, hurriedly bowing as he said, “Hall Master! I ...”

Ye Yuan sized up this fatty in luxurious clothing. This attire was just like a tycoon or local tyrant.

Ye Yuan did not expect that he was actually the Springwind Hall’s hall master.

This fatty gave Ye Yuan an unfathomable feeling.

“Compelling people? Heh, this show today, everyone saw it. Just who is being overbearing, I believe that everyone has a score in their hearts,” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

The fatty had a face full of flesh as he smiled and said, “Elder Yu won’t come and find trouble with you without rhyme or reason. This matter has to have a cause, right?”

Yu Ying snorted coldly and said, “This boy relies on that his talent that surpasses people and so he doesn’t pay any attention to people. His words even insult my Springwind Hall! As Springwind Hall’s elder, how can I endure it?”

The fatty said, “You heard it too, my Springwind Hall is also a major hall of the Myriad Treasure Tower no matter what. Little Brother, you insulting like so, probably isn’t appropriate, right?”

“Insult the Springwind Hall? Heh, you guys want to chase this Ye out of the great imperial capital just based on a one-sided account, truly a mighty show of power! Elder Jiang Yuan, you’re also here right? Why don’t you reveal yourself?” Ye Yuan suddenly said in a clear voice.

The moment these words came out, the expression of the Jiang Hua beside Jiang Yuan changed abruptly.

But Jiang Yuan gave a cold snort, figure drifting out.

Facing Ye Yuan, Jiang Yuan snorted coldly and said, “Ye Yuan, I heard that you shot to fame in the darkviolet arena and so I sent a subordinate to offer up lavish gifts, wanting to make acquaintances. But you injured him severely and even insulted my Springwind Hall with words, where’s the reasoning?”

Springwind Hall’s three big shots standing in sharp opposition to Ye Yuan currently, it also caused a stir.

Although Ye Yuan’s talent was outstanding, his strength extremely formidable, in this matter, it seemed that it was really Ye Yuan’s fault.

Below the stage, gesturing and pointing at Ye Yuan could not be helped.

But Ye Yuan was unmoved and said coolly, “Elder Jiang Yuan, the servant that you spoke of is Jiang Hua, right?”

Jiang Yuan snorted coldly and said, “Of course!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then ... where is he right now?”

“Heh, you still dare to challenge face to face? Then I’ll let everybody take a look at that haughty visage of yours! Jiang Hua!” Jiang Yuan gave a cold snort and shouted.

But nobody answered.

Jiang Yuan’s brows furrowed and he shouted once more, “Jiang Hua!”

No one answered still!

Jiang Yuan’s heart thumped, secretly thinking that it was not good.

He still wanted to shout again, but was interrupted by Ye Yuan who said, “No need to shout anymore, he definitely slipped away already.”

The expressions of the three Springwind Hall big shots changed at the same time. With this, they finally knew that the matter was not that simple.

“This ... What’s going on here?” Jiang Yuan was somewhat thrown into a panic. He faintly felt that something was amiss.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Of course he doesn’t dare to come out and confront face to face. This matter, as long as you and I meet, he’ll have nowhere to hide. Elder Jiang, you, an exalted Springwind Hall elder, was actually wrapped around a servant’s little finger, and even caused such a big scene, truly laughable!”

That hall master’s expression also changed slightly, knowing that they might really have been tricked by someone today. Frowning, he asked, “Little Friend Ye, what in the world is going on?”

Ye Yuan did not hide it either, roughly narrating the situation of going to the Jiang Manor that day, making the three people’s faces change abruptly.

“It’s also very simple to want to prove this matter, as long as Elder Jiang goes to the gatehouse to inquire about it, I believe that it will be clear at a glance. As for saying that I injured him and insulted the Springwind Hall, there was no such thing. Because since that day, I never saw him again,” Ye Yuan said.

Jiang Yuan’s knuckles cracked from clenching, his jaws tightly clenched. Clearly, he was already enraged to the extreme.

He did not expect that he, a dignified hall elder, actually became a blade in a servant’s hand.

And this blade did not just slash himself, it even wounded the Springwind Hall.

Today, even Hall Master came forward in person, Springwind Hall could be said to have lost face all the way to their granny’s house.

He wished to slice and dice Jiang Hua up right now.

Yu Ying’s expression was similarly livid. He suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Since that’s the case, why did you admit it readily?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “If I said it back then, would you believe?”

Yu Ying could not help choking when he heard that, only then recalling that Ye Yuan had indeed asked him before, but he shoved it back readily.

Even if Ye Yuan explained, he would not believe it at all either. He would only think that Ye Yuan was denying it.

About this, Ye Yuan was naturally well aware of it, so he completely could not be bothered to explain too.

When explaining without strength, everything was feeble. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Strength was the king’s path. He made Yu Ying submit, then came forward to explain. The persuasiveness was naturally much stronger.

At this time, the hall master suddenly cupped his fists at Ye Yuan and said, “Little Friend Ye, this matter was all my Springwind Hall’s fault, I apologize to you on behalf of Elder Yu and Elder Jiang!”
