Chapter 2104: Domineering

The red-haired youth’s eyes lit up as he said with some surprise, “What thick Qilin bloodline power! That young man definitely has my Qilin Clan’s precious treasure on him!”

By the side, a beautiful girl nodded and said, “I also felt it, Big Brother Yun, that person ... seems to be a human.”

The red-haired youth frowned and said, “How can my Qilin Clan’s precious treasure land in the hands of a human? Come with me!”

Done talking, the red-haired youth brought the few people and stepped forward, blocking Ye Yuan four people.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, his face revealing a doubtful look. He did not seem to have offended these few people before.

The red-haired youth had an interrogating look on his face as he said in a solemn voice, “Human, do you have my Qilin Clan’s precious treasure on you?”

Ye Yuan was taken aback and immediately thought of the Qilin emperor bone. Could it be that these few people were of the Qilin Clan?

The Qilin Clan’s bloodline was noble and not inferior to the dragon race. They rarely walked around outside. He did not expect that he actually ran into them here today.

Looks like this Qilin Clan might have some secret art that was able to feel bloodline power, that was how they would sense the Qilin emperor bone on him.

But even if he was of the Qilin Clan, being stopped by this bunch of brainless people, and even had an appearance of you owe me money, why would Ye Yuan go along with it?

Ye Yuan had long thought it over in his heart, but did not show the slightest bit on his face as he said coolly, “So what if I do, so what if I don’t?”

The red-haired youth said in an overbearing manner, “Humph! Then it means you do! How can my Qilin Clan’s precious treasure fall in the hands of a human? Hurry up and hand it over!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he did not get angry but laughed instead. This person’s logic, ordinary people really could not understand it.

“Hur hur, if I don’t hand it over?” Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said.

The red-haired youth smiled coldly and said, “Human, you probably don’t know about my Qilin Clan’s awe-inspiring reputation, right? Even Sacred Ancestor High Priest also has to give in to our Qilin Clan a little! You dare to forcibly occupy my Qilin Clan’s precious treasure. Have you thought about the consequences properly? I’ll give you a chance now! Hand over the precious treasure, then kowtow and admit your fault to us. This matter will be considered dropped! Otherwise, humph humph!”

The red-haired youth did not finish speaking, but the meaning was already very clear.

It was just that these words sounded all the more ridiculous to Ye Yuan.

Could it be that these guys did not come into being for a long time and their brains were rotted?

There was no lack of people purchasing natural treasures in the marketplace. Seeing that there was a show to watch, a large group naturally crowded around.

But when they heard that these youngsters were of the Qilin Clan, everyone’s faces revealed surprised expressions.

“They are actually of the Qilin Clan! Weren’t they normally in the Qilin pseudo world? Why did they come into being?”

“I heard that the Qilin Clan’s talent is extremely strong. Nobody is a match in the same rank at all. Jumping realms and challenging is also commonplace!”

“That human kid actually provoked the Qilin Clan. He’ll probably suffer a big loss.”

... ...

In the demon race, some races were natural kings, with their strength far surpassing those in the same rank.

Such as Ye Yuan, it was as easy as eating and drinking for him to jump realms and battle with the dragon race’s cultivation method and martial technique.

Later, he attained the perfect sixth transformation golden body, his strength even one-shotting those in the same rank.

The Qilin Clan’s talent was virtually equivalent to the dragon race, their strength could be seen at a glance.

This red-haired youth’s strength was late-stage rank six, being roughly equivalent to the human race’s Eighth Firmament True God, his strength closing in on peak rank six.

In everyone’s eyes, Ye Yuan was naturally far from a match.

It was just that even a clay bodhisattva had some anger too. This red-haired youth repeatedly made trouble out of nothing, and even wanted him to kneel down and beg for mercy. It finally aroused Ye Yuan’s anger.

“Is that so? Also not afraid of telling you, I really have a Qilin Clan’s treasure on me. It’s just ... come and get it yourself if you have the capability,” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

The red-haired youth did not take Ye Yuan seriously at all. Looking at Loneswan behind Ye Yuan, he said with a cold smile, “Your reliance is this Empyrean, right? Huhu, Uncle You is also an Empyrean, I believe he won’t be weaker than that Empyrean behind you.”

Behind the red-haired youth, there was a middle-aged man glaring, his aura restrained. People did not expect that he was actually an Empyrean.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Really so much crap! Would dealing with a trash like you still need to rely on others?”

The red-haired youth laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Haha ... It’s still my first time hearing that someone dares to say that my Qilin Clan is trash. Brat, if I don’t tear you apart today, who will still respect my Qilin Clan in the future?”

Done talking, the red-haired youth surged with blood vitality. A powerful bloodline power suddenly erupted.

The shock of the commotion was even somewhat stronger than a Ninth Firmament True God.

When everyone saw this power, their faces suddenly changed. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Everyone said that the Qilin Clan was powerful, but that was all just legends. There were barely any who had really seen before.

But the strength that this red-haired youth exhibited currently actually made him have an impulse of submitting.

At this time, they finally knew how powerful the Qilin Clan was.

The red-haired youth’s long hair fluttered, both hands seizing two clusters of fire, as if he was stepping on fire-wind wheels[1].

He looked at Ye Yuan coldly and said in a solemn voice, “Kid, I give you one last chance. Hand over the Qilin precious treasure, kneel down and admit your fault. I’ll spare you from death! Otherwise, when my fist lands, it will be hard for you to want to live!”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said, “Looks like your family’s elders didn’t teach you how to behave before coming out. Today, I’ll take action on behalf of your family’s elders, and teach you properly.”

The red-haired youth’s face turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “Punk, it’s you who is courting death! You can’t blame me! Fire Qilin Blessing!”

The red-haired youth struck a fist out, the entire street seemed to be set on fire.

Qilin was a fire-attribute divine beast, its power boundless. It was indeed not fake.

Boundless power of law thoroughly wrapped Ye Yuan up and did not give him the chance to escape at all.

“The Qilin Clan is indeed powerful. This punch, probably even a peak rank six will also be blown up, right?”

“This kind of inheritance martial technique, when cultivated to the peak, it has the power to obliterate heaven and earth. It really makes people envious!”

“Sigh, that kid is also asking for it. People want the Qilin Clan’s treasure, just give it to him. Why seek death himself?”

... ...

There was a series of exclamations coming from all around. They were all shocked by the red-haired youth’s punch.

At the same time, they also secretly shook their heads, feeling that Ye Yuan was too insensible.

He did not have strength, yet guarded the treasure to the death, was there a need?

“Do you think that only you have bloodline power? Then I’ll let you take a look at what’s called a true Qilin bloodline!”

Bang!

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan’s body erupted with an extremely powerful blood vitality. The might of the momentum was actually even above the red-haired youth!

When people from the Qilin Clan saw this, each and every one of their faces suddenly changed.

Ye Yuan’s perfect sixth transformation golden body was extremely restrained. Not taking the initiative to release it, outsiders could not tell at all.

Hence, in everyone’s view, Ye Yuan was merely a peak Sixth Firmament True God human martial artist. How could he withstand the red-haired youth’s punch?

Completely erupted at this time, how outrageous was the commotion?

Only to see him throw an ordinary punch out, not using any martial technique at all. Qilin bloodline power surged to the sky!

Bang!

With two fists meeting, the red-haired youth fell back more than ten steps in a row before barely managing to stabilize his figure.

While Ye Yuan did not budge an inch!

The red-haired youth’s eyes went wide, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief as he said, “How is that possible? Your Qilin bloodline power is actually even stronger than mine!”
