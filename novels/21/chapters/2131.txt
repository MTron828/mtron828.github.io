Chapter 2135: Dragon Eye Cave

“Dragon Eye Cave! No way!”

Hearing this name, Dragon Lord’s expression changed, and she immediately rejected it.

Long Chi smiled coldly and said, “Then according to Dragon Lord’s meaning, Hao-er died in vain? Or are you going to let this emperor go and kill those few humans to take revenge for Hao-er?”

Dragon Lord’s gaze turned cold, and she said in a solemn voice, “Dragon Eye Cave is the Dragon Clan’s forbidden area. If even a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse goes it, it will be hard to come out too. You’re asking Ye Yuan to go in, isn’t it making him seek death?”

“What a joke! Not letting him go to a dangerous place, could it be letting him go to a safe place? This emperor not smacking him to death with one slap is already very frustrating. As for the Dragon Eye Cave, if he really has a heaven-defying destiny and comes out of there, then this emperor also has nothing to say anymore!” Long Chi looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold laugh.

The Dragon Eye Cave was filled with dangers. Forget about rank six, even if it was rank seven, no one came out before too!

Unless one’s strength reached Heavenly Emperor Realm, only then did one barely have the ability to protect themselves.

Even so, it was also very dangerous.

Long Chi did not believe that Ye Yuan could really come out after entering the Dragon Eye Cave.

As for that agreement, it could just nicely be used to deal with Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s fury. It could be said to satisfy both sides.

Killing Ye Yuan and also leaving Sacred Ancestor High Priest with nothing to say.

Thinking up to here, Long Chi also could not help rubbing his hands in glee.

Such a genius idea, only he could come up with it.

“Fine, I’ll go!” Ye Yuan’s gaze became heavy as he said.

Dragon Lord frowned and said, “Young man, you don’t know what kind of place Dragon Eye Cave is and dare to agree to it? This Lord is telling you, going in with your strength is certain death!”

Ye Yuan understood that Dragon Lord being concerned for him was likely because of Long Xiaochun.

But this Long Chi was incomparably cunning and definitely would not give him the chance.

If he did not go in, he might really make a move against Lu-er they all.

“Many thanks for Dragon Lord’s concern. Ye Yuan appreciates it. But so what even if it’s a dragon’s lair or tiger’s den? What kind of scene have I, Ye Yuan, not seen before? Old Thing, sure, I can go in, but you have to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath! You’re absolutely not allowed to harm Lu-er they all!” Ye Yuan looked at Long Chi and said in a deep voice.

“Haha,

straightforward enough! You rest assured, as long as you sign the agreement, this emperor will naturally swear the Heavenly Dao Oath to set your mind at ease,” Long Chi said with a loud laugh.

... ...

Coming out of the stone house, Long Xiaochun and Long Xiaohai immediately came up to greet.

“Ye Yuan, they didn’t make things difficult for you, right?” Long Xiaochun said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I already said, that old thing doesn’t dare.”

Only then did Long Xiaochun set her mind at rest and said with a laugh, “Hehe, looks like Second Sage this title is still pretty useful! That Long Hao, I’ve long found him displeasing to the eye! Well killed! Humph!”

“Xiaochun!” Long Xiaohai gave a warning gaze, the latter hurriedly shut her mouth.

Lu-er still did not quite believe it and said, “Young Master, is it really fine?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course! Do you still not believe your young master?”

When Lu-er heard this, only then did she smile, being satisfied.

Deep in the night, Loneswan appeared in Ye Yuan’s room, his expression somber.

The other people’s thoughts were pure and did not suspect things. But he lived to a ripe old age, how could he really rest his heart?

After all, this place was the Dragon Clan and not the Priest Temple.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan definitely had something to talk about by calling him here.

Ye Yuan looked at Loneswan’s expression and could not help smiling as he said, “There’s no need to have this expression. Aren’t I perfectly fine?”

Loneswan’s expression was solemn as he said, “I wonder what instructions Master has?”

Ye Yuan said, “Tomorrow morning, I’ll enter the Dragon Eye Cave and might be gone for a very long time. If I come out within ten years, there’s naturally no problem. If I don’t come out within ten years, you bring them and leave East Suppression Pseudo World and return to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to quietly wait for news.”

Loneswan’s expression changed and he said, “Master, what ... what kind of place is this Dragon Eye Cave?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know either, but it’s definitely a dangerous place. That old dog used your lives to threaten me, making me enter this Dragon Eye Cave. You don’t need to have this expression either. Master has cleared before many dangerous places, so how can it be that easy for that old dog to want to doom me to death?”

Loneswan’s expression was solemn as he said, “But ...”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “There are no buts. This period of time that I’m not around, you take good care of Lu-er they all. If this lass knows that I went to the Dragon Eye Cave, she definitely won’t agree to it. Tell her after I leave. In addition, you also have to practice your alchemy diligently. After Master comes out, I’ll be evaluating you!”

Loneswan’s expression flickered incessantly. Only after a long time did he slowly nod his head and said, “Yes, Master! Master has to be more careful on this trip!”

... ...

Early next morning, before the sky was bright, Ye Yuan arrived outside a stone tower situated in the middle of Raindragon Stronghold. Long Zhi was already waiting there.

“You really thought it through about this? The moment you go, it will likely be hard to turn back!” Long Zhi said.

“If I don’t go, will that old dog let me off?” Ye Yuan answered with a question.

Long Zhi sighed and said, “If I had long known it would be like this, I shouldn’t have brought you guys here!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Saying anything now is too late! But I’m afraid that it’s not so easy for that old dog to want my life!”

“There are a lot of evil things inside the Dragon Eye Cave. Furthermore, they are incomparably ferocious. This Stone Brilliant Tower is used to suppress the Dragon Eye Cave,” Long Zhi looked at Ye Yuan and said with a complicated expression.

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised. He did not expect that the Dragon Eye Cave was actually in the middle of Raindragon Stronghold.

The Dragon Clan’s habitat was actually built at such a dangerous place. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It was just like this place was specially constructed in order to suppress the Dragon Eye Cave.

“Come on, follow me. Long Chi they all are already waiting for you. Take care not to touch the array formation; otherwise, immortals can’t save you too,” Long Zhi warned.

Ye Yuan followed Long Zhi into the stone tower and went down the stairs. No idea how deep they went down either.

Suddenly, it suddenly became bright in front, the two people arrived in a great hall.

In the center of the hall, purple light revolved, like a cave entrance. Inside exuded thick evil devilish aura.

This was still after being sealed.

It was not known how strong the devilish aura inside the Dragon Eye Cave was.

If someone with Celestial Deity Realm and below cultivation was here, they would likely immediately be frozen into ice cubes by this devilish aura.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, immediately feeling the danger of this Dragon Eye Cave.

No wonder Dragon Lord’s expression became like that the moment she heard Dragon Eye Cave.

Long Chi and Long Yu were both here. When they saw Ye Yuan, they made no attempt to conceal the delight on their faces.

“Ye Yuan, we came to send you off!” Long Yu’s words carried a double meaning as he said delightedly.

Ye Yuan already recovered his cool and said with a faint smile, “Then I’ll have to trouble you guys. I even thought that you should be sending Long Hao off at this time.”

Long Chi’s face fell, and he said with a cold smile, “Relax, there’s you accompanying on the road to the netherworld, Hao-er won’t be lonely.”

Ye Yuan laughed when he heard it and said, “Then you guys have to pray that I don’t die. Otherwise, after I go there, he’ll die once more.”

When these father and son two people saw Ye Yuan’s appearance, they gnashed their teeth in hatred.

“Humph! Razer-tongued! See if you can still laugh after you enter the Dragon Eye Cave! Enough crap! Brought the contract?” Long Chi said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan took out a jade slip and said coolly, “Swear it then.”
