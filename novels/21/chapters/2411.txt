Chapter 2417: Who’s Scheming Against Who?

“The present myriad races coalition forces is really much weaker compared to the last Doomsday Battle! These guys can’t take a single blow at all!”

At the summit of the high mountain, Daymeld stood with his hands behind his back, pointing at the country.

Just earlier, the divine race army crushed the coalition forces again and mowed down all resistance.

He stood here, ascending to a height. He enjoyed the distant view, taking everything into his sight, and was filled with lofty sentiments.

Just three months ago, both sides officially went to war!

In the three months, both sides had experienced dozens of major and minor battles. The coalition forces were unable to stop the divine race’s iron hoofs at all.

The divine race army headed all the way east and was already almost reaching the boundary between the West Realms and Middle Realms.

The myriad races coalition forces fought as they retreated, and they could not organize a decent battle at all.

“But Your Excellency, Ye Yuan hasn’t shown up until now. I’m afraid that he doesn’t dare to show face anymore. If we continue fighting, once we fight until the Middle Realms, I’m afraid that it will alarm the Dao Ancestors!” Yu Qin said worriedly.

At this point, both sides were extremely sensitive.

Once Dao Ancestors took action, that would be the situation of not resting until one was dead.

Most importantly, the divine race’s few great sovereigns did not have absolute confidence in dealing with the Dao Ancestors.

No doubt that Tian Qing’s battle with the Dao Ancestors previously made the humans extremely apprehensive.

But the divine race also realized the might of the Dao Ancestors’ strength!

Daymeld laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Hahaha ... Yu Qin, you’re also looking down on this progenitor too much! You take a look. What place is it if we continue advancing from here?”

Yu Qin was taken aback and said, “Further ahead and it’s the Eight Void Mountain Range! Does Your Excellency have any brilliant plans?”

Daymeld smiled and said, ‘Yu Qin, your ability to have an overview of the overall situation is still a bit lacking! You take a look again. What shape is our divine race army assuming currently?”

Yu Qin was uncertain what it meant and swept his eyes towards the distance.

The eyesight of this level of powerhouses was extremely good. One look and he could tell the army’s shape.

He was suddenly startled and said, “Your Excellency, our army seems like ... a pocket!”

At this time, the divine race army was just like an enormous pocket, enveloping the myriad races coalition forces up.

Looking from afar, it was just like a pocket enveloping the myriad races coalition forces up.

Originally, with the numbers of the divine race, it was impossible to achieve this.

But, the myriad races alliance’s troops were not as many as imagined at all.

The divine race had the support of the abyss monsters, they were already not worse than the myriad races coalition forces in terms of numbers.

“Hahaha, what you said is right, it’s a pocket!”

Daymeld’s face was rather pleased with himself as he said, “I’ve always been deliberately suppressing in three directions, forcing them in the direction of the Eight Void Mountain! Ten billion years ago, Grand Ancestor Skyformation isolated our divine race army with his power alone! Today, this progenitor will borrow his power and catch the myriad races coalition forces like catching a turtle in a jar! When they know that the array formation which their ancestor laid down actually became the thing that cuts off their final way out, they will definitely be very despaired, right?”

Talking about how he was pleased with himself, Daymeld laughed loudly without ceasing.

His individual combat strength was naturally extremely strong.

But being able to achieve victory in the great battle between two armies had more of a sense of accomplishment.

Yu Qin’s two eyes lit up when he heard that and said with a sigh of admiration, “Your Excellency is impressive! These three months, Your Excellency actually unknowingly forced them into a hopeless situation! Now, even if they react to it, it’s also too late to turn around too! Except, if that kid doesn’t appear again, what shall we do?”

Daymeld smiled and said, “Don’t you worry. They will definitely come out! At that time, I’ll give them a way out and intentionally give them a slim chance of survival! This army’s combat power is extremely strong, Ni Xuan will definitely send them to attack this weak link. At that time, we’ll round them up in one fell swoop!”

“Brilliant! Truly brilliant! Lord Daymeld took every conceivable possibility into account, it’s really our divine race’s blessing!”

Yu Qin did not stint with praises in the slightest. He was really impressed.

Daymeld mapped out a strategy in the command tent and had long already calculated everything, only waiting for the fish to bite the bait!

With such a commander, how could he not be amazed?

Daymeld smiled and said, “It’s also not that I took every conceivable possibility into account, but that the human army reminded me! Three months ago, the two armies fought several great battles in a row, yet they retreated in the direction of the Eight Void Mountain! They were unintentional, but I did it intentionally! Hahaha ...”

He originally did not pay attention to the retreat route of the myriad races coalition forces.

But after several times, Daymeld suddenly saw the Eight Void Mountain Range!

This place was the divine race’s place of humiliation back then!

Grand Ancestor Skyformation turned the entire Eight Void Mountain into a mountain of restrictions overnight, slaughtering countless divine race powerhouses.

That battle was the battle that the myriad races coalition forces fought to their heart’s content.

Grand Ancestor Skyformation’s awe-inspiring reputation had spread far and wide ever since.

Circumstances changed with the passing of time. Who could have thought that the Eight Void Mountain restrictions that massacred countless divine race members back then would actually become the insurmountable obstacle of the myriad races coalition forces?

Thinking up to here, Daymeld had unspeakable delight in his heart.

Presently, Grand Ancestor Skyformation had long since passed away. It was impossible for the human race to have anyone who can cross the Eight Void Mountain Range!

“Pass on the order, the army will continue to advance toward Eight Void Mountain Range!”

... ...

When Daymeld was laughing loudly at the top of the mountain, there were similarly roaring guffaws inside the myriad races coalition forces’ camp.

“Hahaha ... Daymeld is really ‘smart’! Honestly speaking, I was really scared that he’s too dumb to think of Eight Void Mountain!” Ni Xuan said with a big laugh.

Long Yi also smiled and said, “Then you’re looking down on him too much. He’s the three armies’ commander after all. If he can’t even see this, then he’d also be too dumb.”

“Tsk tsk, it’s still Lord Saint Azure who is incredible. He really took every conceivable possibility into account! It’s a pity. If he could remain ten billion years ago, maybe we wouldn’t have needed to experience this battle!” Shi Potian said with vicissitudes of emotion. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

On that day, Ye Yuan recounted the origin of Saint Azure for everyone to hear. Everyone was dumbstruck with amazement.

This sort of thing was seriously too fantastical. They did not dare to believe it at all.

It turned out that the human race’s Dao teachings in the last epoch were actually passed down by Ye Yuan!

For this, they even asked Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets to confirm this matter.

After getting an affirmative answer, no one dared to look down on Ye Yuan anymore.

Compared to this, Ye Yuan entering the enemy camp alone appeared too piddling.

One had to know, the human race’s today was created by Ye Yuan single handedly!

Since that was the case, those terrifying restriction grand arrays on Eight Void Mountain Range were actually all created from the Dao teachings that Ye Yuan left behind!

Although Grand Ancestor Skyformation’s strength later on was God knows how many times stronger than Ye Yuan, when it came down to it, they were still from the same direct line of lineage.

Dealing with the divine race army with Eight Void Mountain Range’s peerless grand arrays, Daymeld would never have dreamed of this, right?

How could he know that Ye Yuan this Saint Azure traveled through spacetime and triggered the grand arrays again?

This sort of thing, even thinking about it, made them felt excited.

On the other end, Daymeld thought that he had cornered the myriad races coalition forces, cutting off the army with Eight Void Mountain’s grand array.

While on this end, the myriad races coalition forces planned on re-activating Eight Void Mountain’s grand array and slaughtering the divine race army again!

“Speaking of which, we’re really ashamed! Concerning this new world created by the ancient sages with hot blood, we’re powerless to protect it! Lord Saint Azure traveled through spacetime. He has to face the divine race’s incursion twice. He really carries a heavy burden and has a long road ahead! Saint Azure is well-deserving of being a virtuous saint through the ages!” Ni Xuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Everyone nodded their heads one after another, deeply feeling that way too.
