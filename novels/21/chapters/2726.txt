Chapter 2732: Tyrannical Seven-star Heavenly Sect!

Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly changed.

Sure enough, it was Inklight Forest!

“What location in Inklight Forest?” Ye Yuan’s tone became solemn.

The old man gave a coordinate, but wasn’t that precisely the site that the Heavenspan World was at?

At this point, Ye Yuan no longer had any hope of getting lucky in his heart!

It was just that he was very perplexed; why would the Heavenspan World have associations with this whatever Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm?

Ye Yuan started worrying about Li-er they all.

He frowned and said, “What kind of abnormalities happened there?”

The old man answered, “A few days ago, bloody light suddenly rose to the sky there, dyeing the dark night red. Linking all sorts of rumors previously, only then did we confirm that that place is the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm!”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath, his heart being in a fluster.

“Have you all sent people in before?”

The old man shook his head and said, “The bloody light is extremely strong right now. We can’t enter at all! However, that bloody light is currently weakening and we’ll be able to enter very soon. We don’t have assurance. That’s why we sent out the hero invitations, inviting more powerhouses to enter together.”

But the moment Ye Yuan heard, he became even more worried.

He did not know what kind of change happened in the Heavenspan World.

Were Li-er they all still well?

“Big Yellow, send him on his way!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Right!” Big Yellow received the order and directly ended the old man.

… …

Bang!

In a secret chamber of the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, it specially enshrined a life tablet.

That place was the previous, previous generation sect master’s life tablet!

The disciple guarding the hall was suddenly startled awake and his expression could not help changing wildly.

“Things are bad, Ancestor Lu Zhengxin’s life tablet has shattered!”

Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s upper echelons fell into extreme shock and panic very quickly.

At this critical juncture, the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s greatest trump card, the three tribulations Saint Sovereign Heaven ancestor, actually died!

Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s sect master, Chen Tai, returned from Jadefork Peak, his expression terrifyingly grim.

There were only him and Head Elder, two people, who knew that Lu Zhengxin existed!

“Sect Master, what in the world happened? Who could kill Ancestor?” Head Elder said with a sorrowful face.

“Don’t know who did it! But it’s definitely a Saint Sovereign Heaven that’s lurking among those people! Not only did he kill Ancestor, he even took away that mysterious power at the back mountain! What ruthless means! This is equivalent to severing our Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s lineage!”

Talking until here, Chen Tai gnashed his teeth in hatred.

But more of it was helplessness.

The reason why Lu Zhengxin was able to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven was entirely because of comprehending that cluster of grandmist energy. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, Lu Zhengxin actually could not leave that cave at all.

Because his fourth Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation was long overdue.

He could shield heaven’s secrets inside that cave and delay the arrival of the fourth Dao Tribulation.

This was also the reason why the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect would decline.

No successors!

But, as long as he was around, he would be the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s guardian deity.

Now, the deity was dead!

The mysterious power that could help step into Saint Sovereign Heaven also disappeared.

There was still no news about the Heavenspan Mountain.

The Jadetrue Heavenly Sect was really on the verge of extinction this time.

Ye Yuan did not know that him taking away the grandmist energy would cause such a heavy loss to the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

Of course, even if he knew, he would not care either.

He did not have any good impression of the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect in the first place.

If not for Yan Jadetrue, how could the Heavenspan World have been deceived for hundreds of millions of years?

“What should we do now?” Head Elder said with a solemn face.

“Absolutely can’t let the outside world know about this matter. We must pretend like everything’s fine! The Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm trip this time is our last chance! As long as we can find the Heavenspan Mountain, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect will still have hope of continuing!” Chen Tai said in a solemn voice.

Their Saint Sovereign Heaven was dead and they did not even dare to investigate it. They could only swallow the grievance.

… …

A month’s time passed in a flash.

Several hundred powerhouses were gathered in Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

There naturally could not dispense with some friction.

But ever since Big Yellow knocked Shi Yue over with a kick, no one dared to provoke him anymore.

Everyone knew that the large yellow bull next to him was not to be trifled with.

In the marketplace, Ye Yuan found a lot of good stuff.

On the day of departure, Ye Yuan already could not wait for it.

Chen Tai arrived before everyone and said with clasped hands, “Thank you, fellow daoists; Chen Tai is endlessly grateful! The Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm opening this time, this sect promises everyone that as long as we find Ancestor Jadetrue’s Heavenspan Mountain, we won’t take anything else! But, if anyone wants to snatch the Heavenspan Mountain from this sect, the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect will be irreconcilable till death with them! Although our Ancestor Zhengxin is in closed-seclusion all year round, if you really provoke him into taking action, it’s likely that no one will gain any advantage!”

When Ye Yuan heard this, he could not resist exchanging a glance with Big Yellow.

Although he did not know Lu Zhengxin this name, he guessed it too.

This Chen Tai actually used a dead person to threaten everyone. It was really impressive enough.

However, Ye Yuan naturally would not express anything. If he showed it, it would mean that he was killed by him.

There was no benefit apart from becoming the common target for scorn.

Moreover, there were likely hidden dragons and crouching tigers among the Jade Sovereign Heavens present!

“Sect Master Chen, rest assured. We only seek natural treasures and won’t fight with you!”

“Yeah, we’re entering the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm merely in order to seek a lucky chance to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

“That’s your Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s; we won’t snatch it!”

… …

The moment Chen Tai said it, everyone’s hearts turned fearful, making their positions known one after another.

Legends had it that the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect was still hiding a Saint Sovereign Heaven. No one knew whether it was real or fake.

But most believed it.

After all, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect was once True Yang’s number one sect, its foundation being extremely deep.

Seeing everyone make known their positions, Chen Tai was very satisfied too and said with a nod, “Alright, everyone, let’s set off!”

“Wait a minute!”

Everyone was just about to move out when Tang Quan spoke up.

Seeing him open his mouth, everyone knew that there was a show to watch.

These few days, they had been curious all along.

The Seven-star Heavenly Sect was not easy to deal with.

Got slapped in the face for no reason, but did not fight back.

Everyone was finding it odd. But they did not expect that Tang Quan was waiting here.

“What is it, Elder Tang?” Chen Tai asked.

Tang Quan looked in Ye Yuan’s direction and said coolly, “Wei Yu is our Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s next sect master. Someone actually dared to slap his face. It’s equivalent to slapping our Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s face! In this True Yang Heavenly Domain, no one dares to slap my Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s face yet! Today, in front of everyone, we naturally have to gain back this face.”

Everyone present was shrewd. They naturally knew Tang Quan’s intention of doing so.

He was using this incident to shock all of the True Yang heavenly sect’s powerhouses, that his Seven-star Heavenly Sect was not to be provoked!

In reality, there were really not many people who dared to provoke the Seven-star Heavenly Sect.

Even if the other person’s strength was lacking.

But Ye Yuan was one of those few people.

When Wei Yu saw Tang Quan speak up, he looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Punk, today, kneel down and acknowledge your fault in front of everybody, and waste your own cultivation. Then, deliver that large yellow bull to the Seven-star Heavenly Sect. This matter will be considered dropped. Otherwise, you can forget about going anywhere today!”

When everyone heard, they could not help secretly applauding.

Wei Yu was well-deserving of being a sect master successor, his mind was very meticulous too.

He had clearly seen through this large yellow bull’s extraordinariness too, that was why he would say that.

If the Seven-star Heavenly Sect obtained Big Yellow and groomed him, he would surely be a major combat force in the future!
