Chapter 1857: Still So Shameless

The demise of three Empyreans did not stop those powerhouses from advancing wave after wave.

However, the powerhouses who entered Heavenly Sun Mountain Range, not one was able to return alive.

A month later, finally no one dared to arbitrarily enter the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range anymore.

Powerhouses from everywhere started converging in Thousand Soar Imperial Capital, discussing how to enter this Empyrean abode.

A city lord said, “Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was a peak Empyrean powerhouse from five million years ago. His strength had already reached an inconceivable level and can even effortlessly annihilate Empyrean powerhouses.”

Another person said, “In my view, it’s likely difficult for us, these True God powerhouses, to enter inside.”

“This Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove has such formidable strength. There must be countless lucky chances inside this abode. Giving up just like this, who is willing? Moreover ... if we can obtain Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s Dao Fruit ...”

The moment these words came out, the atmosphere within the hall immediately tensed up.

Empyrean Dao Fruit, who did not want?

Furthermore, this was not an ordinary Empyrean Dao Fruit, but a peak Empyrean Dao Fruit!

Among these people, it was impossible for there to be someone who could reach this level in their lifetime.

Gu Tianque said, “Now, someone already discovered that martial artists below Celestial Deity Realm will be fine entering the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range. There have already been True God Realm martial artists who tried it before. As long as one suppresses their realm to Celestial Deity Realm, they won’t be attacked when going deep into the mountain range. But, inside this Heavenly Sun Mountain Range, it is still filled with dangers. I feel that we’d better cooperate with a united effort, and think of a way to enter the abode first. I wonder what’s everyone’s opinion?”

Hearing Gu Tianque’s words, everyone all nodded their heads in succession.

Don’t look at how they were all True God Realm powerhouses. In front of Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, they were simply no one.

A thousand, ten thousand going in, it was also seeking doom.

Hence, banding up together first was indeed a pretty good option.

“Since everyone doesn’t have objections, then let’s set off together ten days later, and enter the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range.” Gu Tianque gave the final word.

After discussing, the group of True God powerhouses all dispersed. But Heavenly Water Imperial Capital’s city lord, Ji Xun, stayed behind alone.

“Mn?

Brother Ji looking for me, could there be something?” Gu Tianque pretended to be uncertain as he said.,

Ji Xun secretly cursed sly old fox and said with a smile, “Huhu, old pal, my Heavenly Water Imperial Capital and your Thousand Soar Imperial Capital have always been of the same breath and branch. That good-for-nothing disciple of mine, Zhuo Han, has admired Lass Qiuling for a long time already. You think. Shouldn’t us, these elders, bring a romance to a happy ending?”

Gu Tianque chuckled when he heard that and said, “The matters of youngsters, leave it to them to worry about it. You also know this disciple of mine, who she wants to choose as a Dao companion, that’s not what I can persuade.”

Finished talking, Gu Tianque immediately left and did not seem to have the intention of continuing to chat.

Ji Xun’s brows furrowed, not understanding what medicine this Gu Tianque was selling in his gourd.

In the past, Gu Tianque was still rather keen about Zhuo Han and Leng Qiuling’s affairs, even though Leng Qiuling’s attitude had always been uninterested.

But now, even Gu Tianque this old fellow did not seem willing anymore.

...

As Ji Xun’s favorite disciple, Zhuo Han naturally came along to Thousand Soar Imperial Capital too.

In reality, the True God powerhouses that came this time, quite a few brought along their juniors

A massive lucky chance like an Empyrean inheritance, even if they all, these disciples, obtained a tiny bit, it was also endlessly beneficial.

Moreover, the Immortal Grove Abode this time, it was already confirmed that only Celestial Deity Realm and below powerhouses could enter.

But at this time, Zhuo Han already entered Thousand Soar Mansion himself. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“This junior apprentice brother, I wonder if Junior Apprentice Sister Leng Qiuling is in Thousand Soar Mansion?” Zhuo Han had a refined and courteous appearance, but his words exuded haughtiness.

That Thousand Soar Mansion disciple sized him up and said, “Who are you? The Thousand Soar Mansion doesn’t allow any random person to come in.”

Zhuo Han smiled and said, “I’m Heavenly Water Imperial Capital’s Zhuo Han. Junior Apprentice Sister Leng is precisely this Zhuo’s fiancée. In fact, I’m not considered an outsider.”

Zhuo Han deliberately increased his volume, like he was afraid that people did not know him.

That disciple was startled when he heard that and said, “Turns out that it’s Senior Apprentice Brother Zhuo, apologies, apologies! Senior Apprentice Sister Leng is currently at the practicing field, I’ll bring you over.”

Zhuo Han’s fame in imperial capitals was still very resounding, this disciple had clearly heard before.

Furthermore, the rumors about Zhuo Han and Leng Qiuling were not some secret in Thousand Soar Mansion. It seemed like City Lord His Excellency had the intention of matchmaking the two.

This disciple naturally did not dare to slight him.

“It turns out that he’s Zhuo Han. Indeed worthy of being Heavenly Water Imperial Capital’s number one genius, to actually be able to catch up to Senior Apprentice Sister Leng’s cultivation speed.”

“Yeah! Heard that the Manor Lord intends to matchmake the two, they are really a match made in heaven!”

“However, Senior Apprentice Sister Leng recently got rather close with a boy called Ye Yuan, this is really seldom-seen.”

“Hey, that punk is merely a Second Firmament Celestial Deity, how can he be worthy of Senior Apprentice Sister Leng?”

...

When Zhuo Han heard the surrounding disciples’ discussions, he originally enjoyed it greatly. But when he heard Ye Yuan this name, his expression suddenly changed.

This name was simply his nightmare.

Even if several hundred years had gone by, it was still fresh in his memory too.

Of course, he hated Ye Yuan to the bones too, and he had long wanted to find Ye Yuan to settle the scores. But, Ye Yuan had never been heard of after he left the Heavenspan Mountain. hence, this plan also reached a deadlock.

He did not expect that he heard this name once more today.

“Could it be that ... this Ye Yuan is that punk on the Heavenspan Mountain? Impossible! That person just now said that he’s Second Firmament Celestial Deity! With that punk’s talent, it’s impossible to cultivate so quickly!”

Very soon, Zhuo Han dismissed this thought.

He and Leng Qiuling were the same, both feeling that this Ye Yuan was not that Ye Yuan.

Following that disciple, Zhuo Han came to the practicing field. Thousand Soar Mansion’s disciples were currently sparring, while Leng Qiuling was currently watching the fights by the side.

Upon seeing Leng Qiuling, Zhuo Han’s two eyes immediately lit up and he said in a clear voice, “Junior Apprentice Sister Leng, not seeing for many years, you’re indeed still so breathtakingly beautiful!”

Leng Qiuling turned her head. Seeing Zhuo Han, her brows immediately knitted together.

This guy really lingered on like a haunting ghost!

“This place is Thousand Soar Mansion. What are you here for?” Leng Qiuling said coldly.

But Zhuo Han did not mind and said smilingly, “Look at what Junior Apprentice Sister Leng is saying. I’m here to see my future wife, is there a problem?”

The moment these words came out, the surroundings immediately burst into an uproar, all guessing this young man’s identity.

But Leng Qiuling’s gaze turned cold and she said frostily, “Keep talking nonsense and be careful that I won’t be courteous toward you! Now, immediately disappear for me!”

Zhuo Han laughed and said, “Why does Junior Apprentice Sister Leng have to be like this? Master he already went to bring up the proposal of marriage for me. You and I will tie the nuptial knot sooner or later.”

Leng Qiuling’s expression became colder and colder, practically about to condense into ice.

“Huhu, so many years of not seeing, Young Master Zhuo is still so shameless! Haven’t even checked your Eight Characters yet and you’re putting up a front here, be careful that it will be hard to wind up the matter[1]!”

Right at this time, a figure appeared beside Leng Qiuling.

Zhuo Han focused his eyes and looked, and immediately flew into a rage!
