Chapter 2614: Brother Luo, Fight or Not!

“No way, right? How can this Li Zhuo be so useless, to actually be frightened to death?”

“It’s not that he’s useless, but that Ye Yuan’s aura is too strong! That Li Zhuo had his legs broken by Ye Yuan, and then Ye Yuan killed Lu Zhanyuan in front of him. Now, he entered the Land of Exile and could still return safely. These cast a huge shadow in Li Zhuo’s heart! Coupled with the fact that he’s someone who bullies the weak and fears the strong to begin with, that’s why he’d be scared to death!”

“Ever since Ye Yuan entered the sect, the impact that he caused is seriously too great! Killing Lu Zhanyuan, battling with Qin Shun and Shi Feiyu, paralyzing the entire sect, entering the Land of Exile, which incident wasn’t earth-shaking? Becoming his enemy is the most terrifying thing!”

… …

Ye Yuan scaring Li Zhuo to death in three steps caused a huge shock on Thousand Bird Peak.

His domineering return spread throughout the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect very quickly like a hurricane.

Ever since entering the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, each incident that Ye Yuan had done, they were all shocking.

Now that he returned domineeringly, just what kind of sensation would he cause? Everyone was also waiting to see.

Of course, the first thing that Ye Yuan had to face was the sect’s fury!

Being completely boycotted by the Pill Alliance, resulting in humiliating the sect, and forfeiting its sovereign rights, all these made Ye Yuan become the common target for scorn.

If he died in the Land of Exile, then forget it. Yet, he came back!

This matter, how should he get through it?

But everyone was not optimistic about it.

This matter was already not what human strength could change.

No matter how strong Ye Yuan was, it was also impossible to resist the entire Pill Alliance.

Especially these few years, everyone had already completely witnessed the Pill Alliance’s strength.

Right at this moment, a powerful aura was heading straight for Thousand Bird Peak.

When everyone saw the situation, their expressions changed one after another.

“Ye Yuan, hand over your life!” Han Qianyun’s furious to the extreme roar instantly reverberated throughout the entire Thousand Bird Peak.

The pressure of a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum was also urged by him to the extreme in an instant.

When Han Qianyun woke up, he felt his face hurt badly.

He transformed a mirror with a spell to look at the reflection and discovered that his face was trampled full of shoe prints.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan did not trample plainly but employed divine essence to leave many shoe prints on his face.

These shoe prints could not be removed in a short time!

With Ye Yuan stepping on his face time and again, this made Han Qianyun unable to tolerate it!

In his rage, he sprinted straight for Thousand Bird Peak.

At this time, Ye Yuan was currently treating Lin Lan’s injuries.

Lin Lan had a lot of old injuries, he could not recover in a short time at all. Ye Yuan could only ease them for the time being.

Facing the Han Qianyun who came in a rage, Ye Yuan just turned his head back and gave him an indifferent glance.

The expression of the enraged Han Qianyun suddenly changed drastically!

Swoosh!

He retreated at an even faster speed than when he came.

When this scene landed in everyone’s eyes, they were incomparably stupefied.

What was going on?

Didn’t you come to kill people?

He gave you a glance and you had the piss scared out of you?

Repelling the enemy with one look, furthermore, the enemy here was even Han Qianyun, a sect protector!

This made Ye Yuan’s image become incomparably stalwart in everyone’s eyes.

Cultivation realm never seemed to be a big deal in front of Ye Yuan.

“Didn’t you want me to hand over my life? My life is right here. Come and take it!” Ye Yuan’s words also revealed a trace of iciness.

Li Zhuo said it earlier; he acknowledged Han Qianyun as master.

Then Li Zhuo treating Lin Lan high-handedly probably could not dispense with Han Qianyun’s instigation.

If he had long known it would be like this, he should have finished him off on Flowing Cloud Peak just now!

But sadly, the enhanced version of Windward Topple was already used completely. He only put on an empty-fort strategy just now.

Han Qianyun, this idiot, indeed fell for it.

Of course, it was also primarily because Han Qianyun was frightened into intimidation by Ye Yuan. So he was the same as Li Zhuo.

He already had a psychological trauma toward Ye Yuan. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Don’t you be arrogant! Since you came out, the crime of the sect suffering distress should also be repaid! I want to see how you get through this today!” Han Qianyun said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Then don’t need you to worry about it, I feel that you’d better worry about yourself! Jingxuan, send him back.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan directly got up and left.

Han Qianyun’s expression changed and he said, “You want to run!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Run? Why do I have to run? Jingxuan, Lin Lan, and Elder Luo’s matter, you master and disciple played a part, right? You’d better wash your neck clean and wait for death!”

Finished saying, he went straight down the mountain.

Han Qianyun wanted to stop him, but he also did not dare.

However, Ye Yuan’s action attracted many people’s gazes.

People also followed him one after another and went down the mountain.

Outside of everyone’s expectations, Ye Yuan arrived at True Feather Peak.

This place was Luo Yunqing’s residence.

As sect elders, they all had independent mountain peaks as residences.

However, on this True Feather Peak, there were no luxurious buildings and also no disciples that crowded around.

There was only a thatched cottage and a tiny courtyard.

In the courtyard, a sword was hanging in it quietly.

Luo Yunqing was currently looking at this sword intently, his face full of solemnness and a conflicted expression.

After a long time, he extended a finger out and was going to tap the sword body.

He gave a long sigh and said, “I’m sorry, old pal!”

“Senior Luo, this Ye came to seek guidance. Will you grant a battle?” Right at this time, a voice came from outside the thatched cottage. It was precisely Ye Yuan.

Luo Yunqing’s expression changed, immediately revealing a look of wild elation.

He suddenly stood up and looked outside of the courtyard. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

“Brother Ye! You came back!” Luo Yunqing said with a pleasant surprise.

Ye Yuan’s face had no joy nor sorrow, but then a surge of sword intent billowed to the sky, and he said coolly, “Brother Luo, fight or not?”

Luo Yunqing’s entire body trembled, his eyes revealing a hint of solemn melancholy as he shook his head and said, “Brother Ye, from today onward, I’m swordless!”

Ye Yuan did not have the slightest ripple and spoke up again, “Brother Luo, fight or not?!”

His aura became stronger and stronger, surging straight for the sky!

This kind of astonishing sidelong glance also made everyone give sidelong glances.

Even Luo Yunqing revealed a look of surprise too.

How could a guy who just broke through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum have such a fierce sword intent?

As if sensing Ye Yuan’s sword intent, the long sword hanging in the courtyard actually emitted a series of light cries!

Luo Yunqing had become one with his sword, he could naturally feel his old pal’s intention.

It wanted to fight!

Just earlier, Ye Yuan saw that Luo Yunqing actually wanted to break his sword.

With this thought, Luo Yunqing’s ambition was ground flat.

Not others who ground down his spirit, but he himself!

Not grinding it down, he could not lower his head!

Only by breaking the sword could he step out of the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

The cutting edge of the sword depended on this saying: if gods block, kill gods; if Buddha blocks, kill Buddha!

Once the spirit was lost, one would no longer advance an inch!

It was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to allow this sort of thing to happen. Therefore, he did not have small talk with Luo Yunqing, but he directly declared battle!

The noise and shouting were long already in great commotion outside of the courtyard.

Everyone was shocked by Ye Yuan’s way of doing things.

“He actually challenged Luo Yunqing! Doesn’t he know that Luo Yunqing is a transformation powerhouse?”

“He’s helping Luo Yunqing find himself again!”

“This guy is really nuts! Luo Yunqing isn’t Lu Zhanyuan that sort of farce. Even if he suppresses his realm, he can also instantly kill Lu Zhanyuan!”
