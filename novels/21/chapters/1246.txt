Chapter 1250: Transfigured Heaven Stabilizing Divine King

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Inside a mountain ridge not far from the Soul Refining Sect space, figures huddled together. Several martial artists were currently being hunted down by a desolate beast.

“Split up and run! This desolate beast’s speed is too fast! Once it catches up, none of us can escape,” suddenly, one of them shouted.

That desolate beast’s aura was turbulent. Moreover, its speed was bizarre, looking like it was about to catch up to the few people.

Right at this time, everyone just felt a blur before their eyes, as if a figure passed by them.

Boom!

Flesh and blood flew everywhere!

The few people turned deathly pale from fright and discovered that the desolate beast was already smashed into meat paste.

A figure had his back facing them, standing with hands behind his back.

The few martial artists could not help exchanging glances, shocked by the other party’s skill.

“Many thanks for Senior taking action to help!” The few people bowed their bodies to salute.

That person slowly turned around. When everyone saw the other party’s face, their faces all changed drastically!

“Heaven Stabilizing Divine King! You ... You’re actually not dead!”

The few people turned pale from fright. The one who saved them was actually Zhuge Qingxuan, who they thought had already died inside the Soul Refining Sect space.

“Jeje, you guys seem to ... hope for this seat to die very much?” Zhuge Qingxuan suddenly said with an eerie laugh.

The current Zhuge Qingxuan’s temperament was akin to a different person from before.

Although the Zhuge Qingxuan in the past was overbearing, he did not have any sinister feeling at all.

But now, just this smile made a chill run down people’s spines.

Giving him a glance, there was a feeling like falling into an ice cellar.

“T-This lowly one doesn’t mean that! We heard that Your Excellency encountered a huge problem in the Soul Refining Sect space, and even thought that ...”

That person wanted to explain but was directly cut off by Zhuge Qingxuan with a wave of his hand.

“This seat asks you, where’s Ye Yuan now?!” Zhuge Qingxuan said.

The few people’s expressions changed, virtually shaking their heads at the same time.

The Heaven Surmounting Divine King was the savior of them brothers. How could they betray the Heaven Surmounting Divine King?

“Your Excellency, the Heaven Surmounting Divine King actually came as well? This lowly one ... never saw him!” That person at the front of the few people said.

“Jeje, still dare to play this sort of little tricks in front of this seat? Looks like the few of you are good brothers, right? Since that’s the case ...”

While talking, Zhuge Qingxuan casually pointed a finger out.

Pierce!

A martial artist’s forehead directly had a large hole pierced through, toppling stiffly onto the ground without even having time to resist.

“Fourth Brother!” When that person in front saw this scene, his eyes turned bloodshot from rage.

“Give you three breaths of time!” Zhuge Qingxuan said coolly.

The eyes of that person in the lead because bloodshot, glaring at Zhuge Qingxuan angrily.

“Three breaths your ass! You despicable fellow, you aren’t even fit to carry shoes for the Heaven Surmounting Divine King! Heaven is really blind, to actually not make you, this mongrel, die inside! Brothers, even if we’re exterminated today, we can’t betray the Heaven Surmounting Divine King either! Attack together with me and kill this vermin!”

There was a total of five people in this party. They were originally itinerant cultivators who became sworn brothers because their temperaments were congenial. The older brother was already a Void Mystic powerhouse, and the other few people were also all Divine King Realm powerhouses.

They originally did not have much feeling toward the struggle between the Heaven Surmounting Divine King and Heaven Stabilizing Divine King. But entering the Godsfall Mountain Range this trip, they were first chased by Zhuge Qingxuan to be cannon fodders, then moved by Ye Yuan later.

Disregard thorough awakening, but to say betraying Ye Yuan, they were not willing!

In their hearts, Ye Yuan was the hero of the human race, and their only hope.

Betray Ye Yuan was not much different from personally burying the human race.

Zhuge Qingxuan killed number four but did not make them brothers fearful. Instead, it stimulated the courage in their bones!

Except, their strength was utterly not worth mentioning in Zhuge Qingxuan’s eyes.

Seeing the four people go crazy, Zhuge Qingxuan gave a cold laugh and casually pointed a finger out, like crushing dead leaves and branches, killing the four people.

“Jeje, that brat has such impressive skill, to actually seem to have forced a bewitching potion down these people’s throats. This feels ... like the Absolute Heaven back then! You’re ... far inferior compared to him.”

Suddenly, the words that Zhuge Qingxuan said dripped with sarcasm.

The next instant, he recovered to his original tone and said with a cold snort, “None of your business! You were merely a dog that was driven out by Absolute Heaven to the Heavenly Dao back then, that’s all!”

“Jeje, your shameless appearance very much has the style of Zuo Zong back then! Right now, you and I are of one body, that punk is our common enemy. Don’t scold yourself anymore. Without this deity, you can’t kill him!”

“Humph! Be more obedient for this seat! Otherwise, this seat wouldn’t mind perishing together with you!”

“Screw off! People like you, this deity understands too well! You won’t perish together with me! Don’t talk rubbish anymore, that punk is probably about to enter the god-forbidden region now already! You let this seat control the body and display the Blood Escape Tracking Grand Art, I’ll definitely find that brat’s tracks!”

“If you have a way to track, why didn’t you say earlier?”

“Jeje, you didn’t ask either! How can this deity’s means be what the likes of mortals like you can surmise? Even the Zuo Zong back then also had to fear this deity somewhat!”

“...”

Turns out that on that day, Zhuge Qingxuan and Li Gui had a great battle, and directly collapsed the space.

Originally, Li Gui’s strength was a magnitude greater.

But at the critical moment, because Li Gui’s undying evil ghost was not completed, it resulted in his divine soul having a fatal flaw. Having the opportunity grasped by Zhuge Qingxuan, it actually ended up as the outcome of both being defeated and wounded in the end.

However, Li Gui’s means were truly fantastical. He actually carried a wisp of remnant soul and charged straight into Zhuge Qingxuan’s body, wanting to seize possession.

The two people had another great battle inside Zhuge Qingxuan’s body.

In the end, no one could do anything to the other.

Who knew that the two people’s divine souls actually tangled together in the end.

Now, the two people were sharing a body.

The Heaven Stabilizing Divine King became neither human nor ghost appearance now.

...

“Done!”

Divine Beast Realm, Ye Yuan was inexplicably surprised.

A drop of fresh blood oozed out on his fingertip.

“Quick, drip the sacred ancestor blood essence onto the Sacred Dragon Token!” the old ancestor hurriedly said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and dripped that drop of blood essence on the Sacred Dragon Token.

Boom!

A terrifying dragon pressure billowed into the sky. The sound of a dragon roar reverberated throughout the vast expanse of open ground.

Ye Yuan felt that his fleshy and blood finally produced a trace of resonance with the Sacred Dragon Token.

However, it was merely just a tiny trace.

The might of a heavenly divine artifact, with his current strength, he was unable to unleash it at all.

Even in the Divine Dao Era, heavenly divine artifacts were extremely rare too.

Wanting to activate the Sacred Dragon Token, one must condense sacred ancestor blood essence with a Divine Dao secret art, and then drip it on the Sacred Dragon Token.

This kind of Divine Dao secret art was condensed with divine inscriptions. For ordinary people to want to comprehend it, it was absolutely not the work of a day.

But this was nothing to Ye Yuan, this Atavism Dragon Soul. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He only used three days’ time and thoroughly comprehended this set of Divine Dao secret art.

“Come, give the power a try!” the old ancestor said with a faint smile.

It was also his first time witnessing the power of the Atavism Dragon Soul. These few days, when he saw Ye Yuan comprehending the divine inscriptions, his jaws really hit the ground in shock.

Ye Yuan nodded his head, a rod swung out.

Boom!

An over 70 thousand feet large mountain was leveled to the ground just like that!
