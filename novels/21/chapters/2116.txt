Chapter 2120: You Knew That I Was Around?

Apart from Gongyang Lie who did not feel surprised, the pupils of the other Heavenly Emperor powerhouses shrunk. They were clearly stunned by this scene just now.

A True God Realm powerhouse grasping Dao mark, this kind of thing was unheard of.

Ye Yuan actually used Dao mark to break Heavenly Emperor Zixu’s restrains, this was simply inconceivable.

But very soon, each and every one of them shook their heads and sighed.

This Ye Yuan was really courting death!

Even if he grasped Dao mark, the two people’s strengths were not on the same level at all.

Ye Yuan’s eyes were icy-cold as he said, “Mine means it’s mine! Want to bring away the emperor bone? Not unless you step on my corpse!”

Ye Yuan could be said to have experienced a thousand hardships to obtain the emperor bone.

Obtaining the emperor bone, Ye Yuan was equivalent to the emperor bone’s master. He absolutely did not allow others to take the emperor bone away.

Even if the emperor bone was taken away by the Qilin Clan, it would also be impossible for them to obtain the emperor bone’s recognition.

“Huhu, you think that with the Dragon Clan protecting you, this emperor really doesn’t dare to kill you?”

Heavenly Emperor Zixu’s fury that had just calmed down rose up once more.

This kid was simply ignorant.

He turned to Long Zhi and said in a solemn voice, “Long Zhi, this emperor has already given your Dragon Clan face! If you guys dare to stop again, don’t blame this emperor for being ruthless!”

Long Xiaochun was just about to speak when she heard that, but how could Long Zhi give her the chance? He directly made a move and imprisoned her.

“Let me go! Uncle Zhi, still not letting go, I’m going to cry!” Long Xiaochun screamed.

Long Zhi casually pointed a finger, Long Xiaochun’s eyes rolled back and actually fainted.

Long Zhi carried the unconscious Long Xiaochun and said coolly, “Lord Zixu rest assured, Long Zhi won’t stop you again.”

Similarly a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, Long Zhi was very clear that the dignity of a Heavenly Emperor could not be violated.

Today, for Long Xiaochun’s sake, Heavenly Emperor Zixu already put down his dignity and did not stoop to her level.

But if they reached for a yard after taking an inch, no one could bear the fury of a Heavenly Emperor.

The term divine war could indeed threaten Heavenly Emperor Zixu, but it was also impossible to make a Heavenly Emperor give in limitlessly.

For the sake of not letting Long Xiaochun mess around, Long Zhi could only knock her out.

Indeed, launching a divine war for a True God Realm was not worth it!

Even though Long Zhi was very curious about Ye Yuan, this curiosity was not enough to let him protect Ye Yuan to death.

Heavenly Emperor Zixu nodded slightly, turned to Ye Yuan, and said with a cold smile, “Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk! Hell has no gate, yet you want to barge inside! Now, nobody can save you from up in the heavens to down below the earth!”

“Who said that nobody can save him?”

Just as Heavenly Emperor Zixu’s aura surged to the sky, a man in a blue garment slowly walked out of the void with his hands behind his back, blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

The arrival was a middle-aged man with a long flowing beard, his complexion rosy akin to Marquis Guan Yu[1]. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The middle-aged man with a flowing beard looked very ordinary, just like a mortal. But Heavenly Emperor Zixu’s facial expression was an unprecedented solemnness.

Seeing this middle-aged man in blue, Heavenly Emperor Zixu was akin to facing a great enemy as he said in a deep voice, “Who is your esteemed self? Could it be that you also want to butt into my Qilin Clan’s affairs?”

With his strength, he actually could not see through the blue-clothed man’s depths.

Ye Yuan looked at the back view of the man in blue and said coldly, “You finally came out!”

The man in blue ignored Heavenly Emperor Zixu, but he turned his head and said with surprise, “You knew that I was around?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I didn’t know, but I could feel that there was someone watching here!”

The man in blue was slightly taken aback and said with a nod, “No wonder Master conferred you Second Sage. The title of Second Sage is fully deserving.”

The moment these words came out, everyone broke out into a commotion.

The pupils of the few great Heavenly Emperors also shrunk, their gazes revealing astonishment.

Who was the person who conferred Ye Yuan as Second Sage?

Sacred Ancestor High Priest!

This man in blue actually called Sacred Ancestor High Priest as his master. Then his status was already almost certain!

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s 11 disciples, each one was an earth-shaking great figure.

Even the weakest High Priest Redplume was a late-stage Heavenly Emperor peerless powerhouse.

This one in front of them was clearly not High Priest Redplume; otherwise, Gongyang Lie would not have no reaction at all.

Then who was this person?

Even Ye Yuan’s icy-cold eyes also shrunk slightly.

He had long felt that someone was watching here. Furthermore, this aura, he had a very familiar feeling.

Hence, that was why he risked his life and also had to snatch the emperor bone back.

Giving the emperor bone to others with both hands was not his, Ye Yuan’s, style.

It was just that he also did not expect that Sacred Ancestor High Priest actually sent his own disciple over personally!

The entire incident was started by Qi Zhen. With the unexpected turn of events until now, several Heavenly Emperor powerhouses showed themselves.

In the end, it actually startled Sacred Ancestor High Priest!

Gongyang Lie had also never seen before the man in blue. But his status was high above, so Gongyang Lie had clearly heard about him before.

From the clues and inklings, he determined the identity of the man in blue and hurriedly bowed in salute and said, “Could Your Excellency be ... High Priest Stardrive?”

The man in blue looked towards him and said coolly, “That’s right. It’s precisely this venerable.”

“It’s actually High Priest Stardrive! That’s Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s seventh disciple! His status is even above High Priest Redplume’s!”

“I didn’t expect it! Really didn’t expect it! I can actually see High Priest Stardrive’s true self one day!”

“Looks like we all underestimated Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s resolve!”

... ...

All the demon race powerhouses in the city had devout looks, looking at the High Priest Stardrive above the void.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest was a paramount existence, his disciples similarly enjoyed the worship of the demon race powerhouses.

Their lineage created countless powerhouses for the demon race and also let the demon race be able to stand tall in the Heavenspan World.

This man in blue was precisely Ji Mo who was always by Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s side. He was known as High Priest Stardrive.

It was just that the name Ji Mo, extremely few people knew of it.

Gongyang Lie had a look of astonishment, and he slowly knelt down and said, “Old Servant Gongyang Lie, offer greetings to High Priest Stardrive!”

Ji Mo gave a cold snort and directly pointed a finger out.

Bang!

Gongyang Lie’s figure flew out backward, spurting out a mouthful of blood with a cough.

But he hurriedly crawled up and knelt back down.

Ji Mo said coolly, “Crippled ten thousand years of your cultivation and imprisonment for 5000 years of confinement! Go!”

Gongyang Lie’s complexion was deathly pale as he prostrated deeply and said, “Thank Lord Stardrive’s kindness of not killing!”

He smiled ruefully to no end in his heart.

He thought that Second Sage was merely conveniently set by Sacred Ancestor High Priest. What did a mere True God Realm count for?

But he severely underestimated Ye Yuan’s status in Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s heart!

High Priest Stardrive arriving here was absolutely not representing himself, but he was actually representing Sacred Ancestor High Priest!

Sending High Priest Stardrive over, the significance was extraordinary.

That was virtually equivalent to Sacred Ancestor High Priest arriving in person!

Everyone opened their eyes wide, looking at this scene in disbelief.

Similarly a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, Gongyang Lie was simply like an ant in front of High Priest Stardrive!

Crippled your cultivation and confined you, you still had to thank the Lord for his kindness!

But everyone understood in their hearts that High Priest Stardrive was enraged because Gongyang Lie offended Ye Yuan.

The Qilin Clan bore down upon the borders with a great army, but not only Gongyang Lie did not protect Second Sage, he also actually even took the initiative to hand over Second Sage. He already committed a severe offense.
