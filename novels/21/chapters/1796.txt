Chapter 1800 Enough to Guard the Door

Bang!

When Ye Yuan laid down the last divine essence stone, the originally thin spiritual energy suddenly spewed out frenziedly like a volcanic eruption.

That violent spiritual energy was akin to materializing; visible to the naked eye.

Ceng You’s face revealed a look of wild elation as he said with a big laugh, “Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, this time, it’s really all thanks to you! I didn’t expect that we actually ran into an Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye. Under such berserk spiritual energy, me breaking through to become an Eighth Firmament Divine Lord is also a matter of within these few days!”

He originally felt that Ye Yuan coming to open up an abode was too dangerous. That was why he came to help.

In the end, he did not help much and got a great bargain for nothing.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “With this spiritual energy’s concentration, our cultivation shouldn’t have any worries within a thousand years. However, we have to cover up the eruption of spiritual energy here. Otherwise, it will definitely attract the coveting of observant people.”

Ceng You deeply felt that way too and said with a nod, “What you said is right! But wanting to block such berserk spiritual energy is probably not easy!”

Ye Yuan smiled and started bustling around again.

After several hours, the spiritual energy in this place returned to tranquility. On the surface, it did not look any different from the other places again.

But under the tranquility, that turbulent and surging spiritual energy made each of their pores relax and open up.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s bustling figure, the shock in Ceng You’s heart grew stronger.

This guy was simply unfathomable!

The two people were currently busying about when Ceng You suddenly felt his heart palpitate.

Several horrifying auras suddenly appeared from all directions.

Following that, three fierce beasts with different forms slowly walked out of the dense woods from three directions.

A deer-form fierce beast said in human language, “Heh, didn’t expect that there’s actually a spiritual eye with such thick spiritual energy on this Firecloud Peak!”

Very clearly, these three fierce beasts had already unlocked spiritual wisdom.

“Ye Yuan! This ... Three rank five fierce beasts!”

Ceng You instantly turned deathly pale. The joy of encountering the Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye immediately evaporated into thin air.

Ye Yuan was still busying about with his own things and did not seem to have the intention of paying attention to these three fierce beasts at all.

A wild boar similarly spoke in the human tongue, “Kid, in order to reward you, your Grandpa Pig will personally eat you!”

Another giant bear said, “Damn fat pig, old deer, this place has nothing to do with you, get further away!”

“Damn black bear, who the hell do you think you are? Do you really think that Grandpa Pig will be scared of you?”

The three fierce beasts did not place Ye Yuan and Ceng You in their sights at all, as if this place was already their territory.

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly stood up and said with a look of relief, “Finally done with it!”

That giant bear said, “Heh heh, this kid has some capability, to actually completely conceal this spiritual eye. Completely can’t see anything strange from the outside. Alright, kid, quickly run. Grandpa Bear gives you ten breaths of time. If you can escape, that’s your life being tenacious.”

Ye Yuan ignored him and said with Ceng You with a smile, “The remaining is opening up the abode. Stop stoning, quickly get to work.”

Ceng You was about to go crazy. How could this guy’s nerves be so thick? Didn’t you see that rank five fierce beasts talking to you?

That old deer laughed loudly as he said, “Hahaha, damn black bear, you are being ignored by a rank four punk, truly disgraceful!”

The giant bear was angered when he heard that and said, “Brat, Grandpa Bear is talking to you. Did you hear me?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Damn black bear, you were talking to me?”

The giant bear had black lines on its head. This kid completely did not know what being scared was!

“Damn brat, to dare make fun of your Grandpa Bear, be careful that Grandpa Bear smacks you into mush with one smack!” The giant bear was greatly enraged and slowly raised its enormous bear claws, assuming a posture of smacking toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The three of you guys took a liking to the Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye? If you guys want to cultivate here, can as well, but you have to protect the abode well for me. Otherwise, I’ll kick you all out.”

Ye Yuan’s words made the three fierce bests thoroughly dumbfounded.

Ceng You listened until his scalp tingled. Ye Yuan was crazy, right? To actually provoke three great rank five fierce beasts!

“Hahaha, this brat actually wants us to guard his door! Looks like he’s really a fool! Grandpa Bear will send you on your way!”

The giant bear laughed loudly, smacking a slap toward Ye Yuan.

This slap was truly daunting to the extreme.

The might of the Celestial Deity Realm could not be stopped!

But right at this time, an incomparably cold aura suddenly appeared.

The moment this aura appeared, it was actually even stronger than the giant bear’s palm!

Bang!

The giant bear’s large body was directly sent flying out.

When the other two fierce beasts saw this scene, their eyes were full of astonishment. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

How could they have thought that Ye Yuan actually still had such a powerful evil spirit following around him?

Ceng You looked at that evil spirit, a chill running down his spine.

He did not think that not only was Ye Yuan’s own strength powerful, but there was also actually still such a terrifying evil spirit following by his side.

“Roar!”

The giant bear roared and said angrily, “Damn brat, to actually dare sneak attack me! You’re dead for sure! A mere evil spirit, you think that you can rest easy without a care?”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Big stupid bear, you alone isn’t enough. Get the two of them to attack together. Although the three of you are a bit weak, it’s enough to guard my door for me.”

Ye Yuan’s words made the giant bear even more infuriated.

“Punk, Grandpa Bear will tear you to pieces!”

While talking, the giant bear waved its terrifying giant paw, clashing together with the evil spirit.

This time, he brought out all of his strength!

However, the giant bear discovered that he was wrong very quickly.

Outrageously wrong!

Ye Yuan’s words just now were not a false statement.

This evil spirit was too strong!

In a few rounds, it beat him until he did not have the slightest strength to retaliate, crying out strangely.

The giant bear shouted, “What are the two of you still stoning for? Don’t you guys want to cultivate here anymore?”

When the wild boar and old deer heard this, they exchanged a glance and also joined in the fray.

With three fierce beasts attacking together, the situation finally took a turn for the better.

However, the evil spirit under Dustless’s control was seriously too strong.

His Ghost Dao Hundred Runes was used at the highest level, forcefully raising the evil spirit’s combat power several levels.

Three rank five fierce beasts were actually suppressed firmly by an evil spirit.

By the side, Ceng You was long dumbstruck with amazement from watching.

This evil spirit’s aura was logically speaking not as strong as the three fierce beasts, but his combat power was abnormally terrifying.

Sure enough, around freaks were all freaks!

It was just that he could not figure out, why would a rank five evil spirit submit itself to Ye Yuan?

Three beasts and a ghost fought intensely for a full two hours, fighting until the entire Firecloud Peak was thrown into chaos.

On Firecloud Peak, wails of fierce beasts would transmit over from time to time.

The giant bear shouted, “Not fighting anymore! Not fighting anymore! We ... We admit defeat!”

The three powerful fierce beasts had bloody noses and swollen faces at this time, wounds all over their bodies, their auras incomparably disorderly. They were finally beaten into submission by Dustless.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How is it? Agree to guard my door for me now?”

The three fierce beasts exchanged glances and actually could not make up their minds for a moment.

They were Firecloud Peak’s kings, but guarding the door for a human was too shameful.

But they also could not resist the temptation of the Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye.

How frustrating!
