Chapter 2957: Great Battle Erupts, Cloudneon Displays Her Power!

“Being in such a hurry to kill me, you became angry from embarrassment?” Ye Yuan looked at Bloodmourn and said with a light smile.

Bloodmourn’s expression changed, and he cried out in surprise, “You … You’re of the Imperishable Soul Physique? There’s actually a second Imperishable Soul Physique in this world? This is impossible! Even if it’s the Imperishable Soul Physique, you received this seat’s blow. It’s impossible not to die either!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s why I said that you all couldn’t kill Hegemon Imperishable! Even a Hegemon can’t kill me, an Emperor Cloud Heaven. Progenitor Imperishable’s soul body is on a completely different level from me! Even if three great Supreme Hegemons join forces, so what?”

Everyone was suddenly enlightened!

It turned out that this was the true Imperishable Soul Physique!

Even if died until not even residue remained, you could still revive!

This scene made the Nirvanic Soul Clan’s powerhouses become invigorated at once.

It was indeed as Ye Yuan said; the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique could not be killed!

“Humph!?Your measly deceptive trick can deceive others, but do you think that you can hide from this seat? The Nirvanic Soul Clan’s methods simply have no way of hiding in front of my soul race!” Jun Yi said with a cold laugh.

Ye Yuan knew that he could not hide it. He did not plan to hide it either.

Even Cloudneon could see through it. How could the Hegemons from the soul race not see through it?

In reality, Yu Tian and the others had seen through it too.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m not planning on hiding from anyone! I just want everyone to know how hard it is to destroy the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique! Even if many Emperor Sakra Heavens come, so what? With your strength, killing me many times, it will naturally be effortless, but so what? Can you truly kill me?”

Jun Yi gave a cold snort but did not speak.

Clearly, he could not kill!

Ye Yuan continued, “You can’t kill me, this rookie who just entered Emperor Realm. Then how powerful is Hegemon Imperishable’s Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique? If the three great Supreme Hegemons are several realms stronger than him, then there’s naturally no problem killing him. It’s just a pity that they are the same rank!”

The eyes of Yu Tian and the rest lit up. They were convinced!

Honestly speaking, it was also their first time witnessing what was the true Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!

Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique could actually borrow the power of heaven and earth to instantly recover!

Such a soul physique, how terrifying was it?

No wonder Progenitor Imperishable had experienced countless battles but could never fall from beginning to end.

They knew that back then when Progenitor Imperishable led the Nirvanic Soul Clan to rise up, he had fought with the Qi Soul Clan countless times.

At that time, he was still not the invincible Hegemon Imperishable!

But, no matter what means the Qi Soul Clan used, they were unable to kill him.

That was how he had this name, Imperishable!”

Yu Tian drew a deep breath and said, “This seat understands! Everyone, listen up. No matter what grudges we had in the past, the biggest goal of all of us from the Nirvanic Soul Clan today is to live! We don’t fear death, but we don’t treat death lightly!”

Wang Ning nodded and said, “East Soul Region’s people, heed my order. Every person that can escape counts as one! As long as we get out of the Sea of Evil, they won’t be able to trap us anymore!”

“Heh heh,?Old Ghost Yu Tian, didn’t expect that this old man, I, will actually have a day where I join forces with you!” North Soul Region’s Hegemon Wu Wen said.

“Hahaha,?this old woman, I, have lived for hundreds of thousands of years, I’ve lived enough too! Today, I’ll fight it out with this bunch of sons of bitches!” West Soul Region’s leader said.

For a moment, everyone who had originally lost their wills actually soared with fighting spirit!

Ye Yuan’s words had already completely activated them.

Bloodmourn was furious until he gnashed his teeth in hatred. The situation that they had meticulously created was actually messed up by an Emperor Cloud Heaven brat!

What shocked him even more was that the Nirvanic Soul Clan actually had another true Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique appear again after Hegemon Imperishable!

Given time, this boy would soar to the sky, and then the Nirvanic Soul Clan would be at the height of its power!

“Everyone, we can’t let a single person off today! Wu Jia, you don’t need to take part in the fight anymore. Kill that boy called Ye Yuan at all costs!” Bloodmourn said in a solemn voice.

“Lu, you go too! This boy can’t be kept alive!” Jun Yi said with a deep gaze.

The Qi Soul Clan was the one that was more apprehensive of Ye Yuan!

If the Nirvanic Soul Clan really tided over this calamity, then it would be a grave threat to the Qi Soul Clan in the future!

Therefore, Ye Yuan must die!

The Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was too terrifying!

The three great races’ Hegemon Realms had a total of 23 people.

The numbers were quite a few, but wanting to completely kill ten great Hegemons, the difficulty was still quite high.

But even so, they still transferred two great Hegemons to specially deal with Ye Yuan.

It could be seen how much importance they attached to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan fell into a desperate situation at once.

He naturally knew the logic that the hunter would shoot the bird that sticks out. But this was an opportunity.

First of all, if the Nirvanic Soul Clan was really completely wiped out, he would have to die too!

Secondly, if he could really bring the Nirvanic Soul Clan out, then Progenitor Imperishable would owe him a huge favor.

This would be of great help to him lending the Purple Ripple Umbrella.

However, what he could do was also just these.

He could only hope that after pulling themselves together, Yu Tian these guys could have a few more of them survive.

“Cloudneon, regardless of Ye Yuan’s identity, he’s our Nirvanic Soul Clan’s benefactor! You escort him out!” Yu Tian looked towards Cloudneon and instructed.

Even when facing such a desperate situation, Cloudneon did not show the slightest expression either. She just nodded her head lightly.

But Ye Yuan was speechless for a while. People already sent two Hegemons to come kill me. You guys were just sending an Emperor Sakra Heaven?

Wasn’t this killing people?

“Ye Yuan, rest assured. Cloudneon’s strength is more powerful than you imagine! She’ll ensure your safety!” Yu Tian said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said solemnly, “Have a few more survive!”

Yu Tian laughed loudly and said, “Don’t you worry, the few of us old fellows aren’t so easily killed!”

“Let’s go!”

Cloudneon said coolly and Ye Yuan rushed out with Cloudneon in spite of himself.

The great battle instantly broke out!

Ye Yuan only heard heaven-shocking explosion sounds coming from behind.

It was as if the entire abyss was going to be blown apart!

The battle of Yu Tian, this level of powerhouses, was seriously too terrifying.

The aftershocks of the battle were naturally extremely terrifying.

With the likes of his strength, he could only become cannon fodder.

The pitiful Wang Qian turned to ashes in the instant the great battle erupted.

Even if he merged with the origin, it could not save him either.

Ye Yuan two people were not out of danger. Even if Cloudneon helped protect him from the vast majority of the force, he still felt like his soul body was going to be scattered.

In front of them, there were seven to eight origin powerhouses that directly blocked off the two people’s escape routes.

Although origin powerhouses were inferior to Hegemons, they could virtually be said to be the strongest under Hegemons already.

It was also that two great Hegemons issued a certain-kill order on Ye Yuan. Therefore, Cloudneon this side immediately attracted considerable firepower!

Dozens of firepower fired over in unison. Ye Yuan felt like the sky was going to collapse.

However, amidst the torrential storm, a white beautiful figure strolled over leisurely! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

A surge of origin power spread out, and Ye Yuan’s eyes went wide.

Those dozens of unbelievably powerful attacks actually seemed to have grown eyes, brushing past the two of them.

Amidst the violent storm, it was only to see Cloudneon point a finger. Terrifying soul force directly stabbed toward the soul race origin powerhouse that was coming head-on like a sharp sword.

That origin powerhouse gave a miserable cry and directly turned to ashes!

Origin powerhouses were actually not opponents that could last one exchange with her!
