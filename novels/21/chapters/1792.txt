Chapter 1796 Sudden Drumbea

“Is there a mistake? This kid is also posturing too hard, right? To actually want to contend for the finale with Baili Qingyan!”“Heh, ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth! Who does he think he is?”

Ye Yuan’s request immediately caused a series of boos.

What the finale represented was strength and status. Ye Yuan was a freeloader in everyone’s eyes, what right did he have to be the finale?

Jiang Xueyan’s brows furrowed when she heard that and said, “What does this guy want to do? He’s using this method in order to fight for vindication? This kid is also too childish, right?”

Baili Qingyan was similarly at a loss, not knowing what Ye Yuan was doing here.

Deacon Hong frowned slightly and said, “You and Baili lass are tied for first place, as long as she has no objections, there’s no problem.”

Finished talking, everyone’s gazes looked over toward Baili Qingyan.

Jiang Xueyan was just about to speak when Baili Qingyan agreed without hesitation, “No problem, I’ll go first!”

Jiang Xueyan stomped her feet angrily, secretly thinking that this girl was so worrying.

Was this the time to yield out of courtesy?

Baili Qingyan took a stop out, arrived high up in the air, akin to a fairy maiden descending upon the mortal world, her beauty transcendent.

The disciples below all revealed worshiping looks.

Baili Qingyan gave Ye Yuan a glance with a complicated expression but discovered that Ye Yuan was currently looking at her with a smile, involuntarily making her stupefied.

What medicine was this fellow selling in his gourd?

This scene was another flavor when it landed in everyone’s eyes.

Baili Qingyan collected her mind, divine essence surging on her body. Suddenly, she cast out a silk ribbon, which flew over toward the Jadelight Drum like lightning.

Dong!

Thus far, the most sonorous drumbeat spread out.

The shockwave coming of the Jadelight Drum rippled out like breaking a dead branch from a tree, leveling the trees in the several mile radius to the ground.

Seeing such a shocking commotion, everyone’s countenance also changed visibly.

This strength was even above Duan Qinghong two people!

Deacon Hong’s face revealed a look of approval as he said with a nod, “Not bad! Not bad! Baili Qingyan, high-grade tier six! Passed the test!”

Jiang Xueyan’s face revealed a relieved smile. With this, their Immortal Abode Sect suppressed the other two lineages until they could not even lift their heads anymore.

Furthermore, Baili Qingyan’s performance also provided powerful proof for her breathtaking first round!

Now, who would still suspect that was not done by Baili Qingyan?

Most likely, even Duan Qinghong they all also would not suspect it, right?

Her gaze looked over toward Ye Yuan away, and she could not help sneering.

“Foolish fellow, think that you can snatch away Baili’s limelight like this? Even though you comprehended spatial law, your realm is too low! But the Jadelight Drum’s requirement for cultivation realm is very high!”

Although she witnessed Ye Yuan’s powerful strength, Jiang Xueyan was not optimistic about Ye Yuan.

She, as the Shadowmoon Sect’s disciple, naturally knew the Jadelight Drum’s power.

The higher the realm, the deeper the comprehensions toward Dao, and the louder the drumming would be too.

Although Ye Yuan’s attack power was high, his realm was too low!

If he used full strength to attack the Jadelight Drum, he would only suffer an even stronger countershock force!

Hence, Baili Qingyan’s first place was already locked in.

Ye Yuan wanting to be the finale, this action was merely the laughable dignity of a man.

Baili Qingyan’s performance made everyone marvel with admiration, and also made Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin feel ashamed of their unworthiness.

They had always been pursuing Baili Qingyan previously. But her potential was more than a level stronger than theirs!

Baili Qingyan said to Deacon Hong with clasped hands, “Thank you, Deacon Hong!”

Deacon Hong nodded his head as he smiled and said, “Baili lass is indeed pretty good! High-grade tier six, among all of the former seasons’ assessments, it also ranks among the best. It’s just a pity that it missed by a step and didn’t break through to tier seven.”

Baili Qingyan said, “Qingyang will cultivate even harder in the future and won’t let the sect down!”

Deacon Hong smiled and said, “Mn, cultivate well! The Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave this time, hope that you can have a place!”

Baili Qingyan nodded slightly and floated down.

Jiang Xueyan went up to welcome with a smile and said, “Baili, you indeed didn’t disappoint me!”

But Baili Qingyan’s attitude was somewhat cold as she said coolly, “Senior Apprentice Sister, there’s still someone who hasn’t taken the stage, don’t be happy too early.”

But Jiang Xueyan said without a care, “Although that kid’s talent is high, his realm is too low after all! Even if he’s stronger than Duan Qinghong they all, it’s also impossible to surpass you!”

Baili Qingyan shook her head slightly but did not dispute.

She kept feeling that Ye Yuan doing this had a deep meaning.

Most likely, it would not be that simple.

Furthermore, it was clearly impossible for Han Yong to surpass Zhao Zhao, but he broke through to tier five.

And Han Yong’s relationship with Ye Yuan was very good. Could this just be a coincidence?

“Last one, Ye Yuan!”

After repeated calls, it was finally Ye Yuan’s turn to appear on the stage.

However, he did not come out yet and there was another wave of booing.

Clearly, everyone was very disdainful of his finale that overestimated his own ability.

“This guy is really utterly without shame, this bit of strength also dare to snatch the finale!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Heh, Miss Baili is magnanimous and doesn’t haggle over it with him. This guy even went from bad to worse.”

“Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, don’t even know whether or not he can make it sound and he dares to snatch the position of the finale.”

...

Originally, Baili Qingyan was a genius at the same level as Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin in everyone’s eyes.

But now, Baili Qingyan’s status in their minds already far surpassed those two people.

The present Baili Qingyan outshone the others.

Coupled with that kingdom-toppling looks of hers, she already became the goddess in everyone’s hearts.

A goddess that could not be profaned!

But Ye Yuan this guy actually dared to blaspheme the goddess and snatch her finale position.

Towards these questioning voices, Ye Yuan naturally paid no attention to it.

He slowly walked out of the crowd but did not fly up high to the sky.

Then, he just flicked lightly, carrying a light breeze, blowing towards the Jadelight Drum.

This movement was like brushing off dust; relaxed and natural.

It was just that this action made everyone feel very perplexed.

Even Deacon Hong’s face revealed a very doubtful look.

“What is this guy doing again? Have to admit, he really knows how to gain notoriety by doing something sensational!”

“What he did just now is already beating the drum?”

“No divine essence undulation at all! This guy knows that he’s going to reveal his true colors and gave up?”

...

Dong!

Just as the ridiculing voices grew higher than the previous wave, an earth-shattering drumbeat sounded out, overshadowing all of the sounds all at once.

In the entire world, only the Jadelight Drum’s drumbeat was reverberating.

The faces of everyone present all changed visibly.

The sound of this drum was actually identical to Baili Qingyan’s!

That power plowed once more within the radius of several miles!

Everyone all used incomparably horrified gazes to look at Ye Yuan. But even more were confused faces.

Was this drumbeat just now really done by Ye Yuan?

But how could that kind of casual and light action cause such a big commotion?
