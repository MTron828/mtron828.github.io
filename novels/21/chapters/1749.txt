“Uh, why does Senior say this? I read very seriously and very carefully!” Ye Yuan said very sincerely.He had indeed read very seriously and did not have any slipshod aspects.

The white-haired old man snorted coldly and said, “Seriously? Carefully? You read 532 classics in less than 14 days, averaging 30 to 40 books a day. You’re telling me seriously and saying carefully?”

Ye Yuan was taken aback for a moment, only then understanding what the white-haired old man meant. He could not help saying with a bitter smile, “Senior, I really read very seriously and absolutely didn’t gloss over!”

The white-haired old man discovered that Ye Yuan’s talent was astonishing and naturally had very high expectations of him.

But Ye Yuan’s attitude of reading the classics made him very unhappy.

Now that he came to remind him, he actually still refused to admit it. This made him even more upset.

The white-haired old man gave a cold snort and said, “You said you read very serious, fine. Then I ask you, what’s the most important take-away point for Zi Ming Godherding Fire Controlling Art?”

Zi Ming Godherding Fire Controlling Art was precisely a demon race fire controlling art that Ye Yuan read.

The white-haired old man also saw through that Ye Yuan’s fire controlling technique was developed with the human race’s fire controlling techniques as foundation, and he did not seem too proficient in the demon race’s.

While the Zi Ming Godherding Fire Controlling Art was also a more obscure foundation fire controlling art of the demon race.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he smiled and said, “Is Senior testing me?”

The white-haired old man did not deny it and said coolly, “If you can’t answer, stare at one book and read properly when you enter in the future!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Zi Ming Godherding Fire Controlling Art, the most important thing is engraving the fire in one’s heart, heart follows the mind, heart and fire becoming one, controlling fire and connecting divinity!”

The moment the white-haired old man heard, he could not help being slightly surprised.

This was a very obscure knowledge. He did not expect that Ye Yuan answered it in one fell swoop.

He did not give up and asked again, “Fire control is your forte, answering doesn’t mean anything. Come again, how many key nodal points does the Howling Rain Sky Direction Art have?”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and opened his mouth again, describing the few nodes clearly.

The white-haired old man clearly did not believe it, asking question after question, the speed getting faster and faster.

Ye Yuan knew that this old man was doing it for his own good and did not find it bothersome, answering fluently, without any omissions.

The more the white-haired old man asked, the more shocked he was in his heart.

Could it be that this kid used over ten days and learned all of the things others learn in several hundred, even thousand years?

Was this a freaking freak?

What was more damnable was that not only did Ye Yuan answer fluently, he frequently added in his own opinion, which was extremely insightful!

Many comprehensions actually made the white-haired old man have a feeling of suddenly being enlightened.

Those classics that Ye Yuan read, the white-haired old man had long read before no idea how many times. Saying that he could read it backward was not over the top in the slightest.

But he discovered now that he read several tens of thousands of years of classics, and his understanding was actually not as deep as this young man in front of him!

This ... was too f*cking hell!

The white-haired old man suddenly discovered that there was a myriad of profanities that galloped across in his heart.

This was not testing the other party, it was purely seeking a beat down!

However, he was still so wretched, asking Ye Yuan questions non-stop. Because Ye Yuan’s understanding was indeed greatly beneficial to him.

Finally, the white-haired old man stopped asking. He looked at Ye Yuan with a face like he saw a ghost and said, “Kid, you aren’t messing with this old man, right? These classics, you wouldn’t have read them before, right?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior must be joking. You’ve already asked a hundred questions. Even if I read before the classics, it also wouldn’t so coincidentally match each one, right?”

The white-haired old man thought so too. 500 over kinds of books, there were always some wrong areas.

If he did not read it just now, there would always be some questions and could not be answered.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan also would not be bored to the extent of coming to make fun of him, this gate-keeping old man.

But the more it was like this, the more shocked the white-haired old man was in his heart.

What kind of talent was needed to have such terrifying memorizing ability and comprehension ability?

He waved his hand and said, “You can go!”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “Many thanks, Senior!”

After Ye Yuan left, the white-haired old man’s figure also flashed, disappearing.

...

“Lord Chi Feng, you have to take revenge for us! You look at the three of us, really ... really no face to meet people anymore!”

Hu Feng’s appearance was indescribably miserable.

Ye Yuan directly sent their divine fires back at that time, giving them a dose of their own medicine, the power was extraordinary.

More than ten days had passed, even though they got much better, there were still burn marks inside and out, looking like poodles.

Most of these priest trainees had priest patrons.

Speaking of which was coincidental too, Hu Feng’s backer was precisely Chi Feng.

At this time, the hair on top of Chi Feng’s heart already grew back anew, recovering to that domineering appearance.

Chi Feng snorted coldly and said, “The three of you really lost all of my face! Slept three days and nights in the latrine and actually don’t even dare to come back! You guys are really capable!”

Hu Feng said with a bitter expression, “Your Excellency, you aren’t aware. That punk’s fire controlling technique is really incredible! The three of us added together aren’t his match either!”

Chi Feng’s expression changed, having a bad premonition, and asked in a solemn voice, “What’s that punk’s name?”

Hu Feng three people exchanged glances, clearly forgetting Ye Yuan’s name.

Right at this time, a youth in white walked into the dormitory.

“It’s you!”

Hu Feng and Chi Feng few people turned their heads to look, crying out strangely in unison.

When Ye Yuan saw these few people, he instantly understood something and said with a smile, “Welcoming a low-level apprentice like this, the line-up is a little too big, right?”

But Hu Feng said in surprise, “Your Excellency, you know this punk?”

Chi Feng asked back, “It was this brat who burned you all until like this?”

Hu Feng nodded and said, “Yeah, it’s this kid! I beg Your Excellency to help us take revenge!”

Chi Feng had a strange look, thinking to himself, avenge your ass!

Your father isn’t even his match, yet you guys still asked me to help you take revenge!

But in front of subordinates, he naturally would not yield.

In reality, after the fire battle the last time, he already thought about taking revenge.

This kid’s attainment in fire control was extraordinary. But in alchemy, he was definitely inferior to him,

Otherwise, he would not be a low-level apprentice but a true priest already.

Chi Feng looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Kid, dare to bet with me again or not?”

Ye Yuan raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, “Still dare to bet with me? Aren’t you scared of losing until you don’t even have pants to wear? Should I be calling you a wealth scattering boy or not?”

Hu Feng three people exchanged glances, not knowing what happened, but still said in a great rage, “Stinky brat, you, a low-level apprentice, dare to humiliate Lord Chi Feng? He’s a lord priest of the temple, are you tired of living?”

Chi Feng said impatiently, “Alright, alright, stop talking nonsense! Brat, you chose the gambling method the last time. This time, I’ll pick! Do you have the balls or not?”

Ye Yuan looked at Chi Feng and said with a smile that was not a smile, “You don’t need to aggravate me. Since you want to be a wealth scattering boy, if I were to refuse, wouldn’t that be seen as holding others back from achieving success? Say it, what’s the wager?”

Chi Feng said in a solemn voice, “Let’s compete in pill refinement!”
