Chapter 3102: Pivotal Point of Life and Death!

Silence all around!

Everyone’s faces revealed a look of extreme shock.

The powerful Hegemon Bloodpromise was actually directly annihilated under Ye Yuan’s stomp!

Looking at the Ye Yuan standing in the sky, the blood race powerhouses all felt a shudder, including Yi Xue!

In that moment just now, the feeling that Ye Yuan gave people was invincibility, that he could not be defeated!

The powerful tribulation cloud actually took the initiative to retreat. It could be seen how terrifying he was!

“This … What move is this? Why do I feel like Heavenly Dao had descended?”

“Lord Bloodpromise actually died. He didn’t even have the chance to revive!”

“What a terrifying move! This move had already surpassed the domain of a divine ability! Most likely, it’s simply impossible for Great Beyond Realm ancestors to create it too!”

…..

Ye Yuan said that this was the strongest move that he created after he achieved mastery through a comprehensive study of what he learned.

But the power of this move already exceeded their understanding.

Therefore, they were alarmed and scared!

Heaven Trampling Five Steps, it was Ye Yuan’s epitome work.

Visualizing the Heaven volume, other people’s strengths could all advance by leaps and bounds. Hence, it was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to march on the spot.

As the most important volume of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, the Heaven volume was actually the general interpretation of Great Dao.

After Ye Yuan visualized it, he had a feeling of suddenly connecting things together.

Alchemy Dao, Formation Dao, Sword Dao, as well as his origin Great Daos, everything and everything, all merged together into an organic whole under the Heaven volume.

Heaven Trampling Five Steps, it was born in response!

Reaching Ye Yuan’s current realm, he could already vaguely sense breaking through to Hegemon Realm, this pivotal point of life and death.

This battle was the battle that would determine his fate!

The battle with Heavenly Dao would be the most terrifying battle in his life.

In comparison, Progenitor Bloodstone, Ancestor Heavenless, so on and so forth, they were nothing.

And the Heaven Trampling Five Steps also represented his determination to trample Heavenly Dao!

This move was unleashed with momentum. It was different from all martial techniques.

But the power was incredible.

However, although the power was great, the sequela was similarly great!

After using this move, same as the ultimate moves of Chi Shang, Meng Jin, and the rest, his entire person would collapse.

Of course, this was not the most important thing.

The most important thing was that, after using this move, he could clearly feel the backlash of Heavenly Dao!

This move was a demonstration of power to Heavenly Dao. How could Heavenly Dao possibly be aloof and indifferent?

These were just the common tribulation clouds. It was very easy to resolve. But, in the final battle, it would be absolutely impossible to overcome it so easily.

Ye Yuan could even feel that the final Dao tribulation was currently brewing.

Such as now, Ye Yuan could distinctly feel that the Dao tribulation was getting closer and closer.

Utilizing this move was inducing the final Dao tribulation.

If the Dao tribulation descended in advance, with his current strength, he did not have the power to resist at all.

Therefore, this move could not be used easily.

Using it was tantamount to slow suicide!

But, for Feng Xiaotian’s sake, Ye Yuan used it without the slightest hesitation!

Of course, with Ye Yuan’s current strength, it was not enough to take the third step at all, let alone talk about the fifth step.

Forcibly taking the steps, without waiting for the Dao tribulation to descend, his own physical body would not be able to withstand it.

This move was too brutal!

“Kill! Leave behind!”

New novels chapters are published ᴏn !

Ye Yuan yelled angrily. All the general obeyed the order, charging towards the blood race’s remnants.

For some time, a whirlwind swept away the last clouds!

After repeated fierce battles, Yi Xue was already seriously injured.

He was burning with anxiety in his heart, wanting to get away. But Mi Tian and Zhao Yue tied him down fiercely. He could not escape at all.

Just a moment ago, he never thought that he would actually fall here!

But now, he was a little alarmed and frightened in his heart!

Ye Yuan’s appearance not only let Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven make a great comeback, it even had the intention of completely annihilating the enemies that came to invade. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Suddenly, Mi Tian gave a cold laugh and said, “You’re scared!”

During this great battle that lasted for three days and nights, Mi Tian was really aggrieved to the extreme.

With concern in his heart, he could not unleash his strongest combat power at all.

Clearly, Yi Xue had calculated all these.

But Ye Yuan’s appearance completely erupted the grievance that accumulated in his heart for three days.

Before this, how overweeningly arrogant was Yi Xue?

But now, he was like a dog that lost its home!

Yi Xue was being entangled by Mi Tian. Zhao Yue’s blow struck him hard in the chest.

Pffft!

Yi Xue’s chest was directly smashed through.

However, his wound was healing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It was just that the speed was much slower than before.

Zhao Yue did not know fatigue at all. No matter how many times the opponent recovered, Zhao Yue would have the patience to continue destroying him.

“You think that you all have won?” Yi Xue smiled coldly as he returned fire.

“At least for this battle, we’ve won!” Mi Tian said.

“You can’t imagine Progenitor’s strength at all! He’s only one last step away from Great Beyond. Reaching our level of boundary, you should know what that means. Ye Yuan’s strength is decent, but just now, you should have sensed something too, right?” Yi Xue smiled coldly.

Ye Yuan’s Heaven Trampling Five Steps let him feel a kind of throbbing that came from the soul.

He had never felt this kind of throbbing before.

That was the fury of Heavenly Dao!

The fury of Heavenly Dao was hidden above the ninth heaven!

Reaching their level, their perception was naturally not what ordinary people could compare to.

The moment these words came out, Mi Tian’s expression turned cold.

Clearly, he felt it too.

“Haha, looks like you’ve felt it too! Tell me, can he really break through the shackles that no one since ancient antiquity has broken?” Yi Xue was covered all over in blood but said with a wild laugh.

“Under Heavenly Dao, all are ants! This ancestor also really wants to see just what kind of scale this unprecedented Dao Tribulation will be!”

“Heaven Trampling Five Steps, whether it will be you trampling on heaven or you being trampled underfoot by Heavenly Dao! This ancestor will really be waiting anxiously to see!”

“Mi Tian, even if you kill me, your Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven can’t escape the fate of being destroyed too! After Progenitor comes into being, your Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven won’t have a single fowl or dog remaining!”

The current Yi Xue was at the end of his rope, but his words were akin to a clap of thunder, exploding in everyone’s ears.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses were shocked. They did not know what Mi Tian and Yi Xue felt.

But without a doubt, what Ye Yuan would be facing, was an unprecedented great calamity!

Mi Tian frowned hard and said in a solemn voice, “You talk too much! You can go and die already! Zhao Yue, do it!”

Finished saying, saint force surged on the two people’s bodies, already preparing to launch a shocking blow.

But Yi Xue was not afraid and said with a loud laugh, “Come on! Bring it on! My strength will eventually return to Progenitor’s body. He’ll bring me to watch your Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven be destroyed!”

Rumble!

Two formidable forces fell with a loud bang.

Yi Xue had already given up resisting. He knew that he could not escape anymore.

Right at this time, a blood-colored barrier suddenly appeared above the void, completely covering Yi Xue.

Boom!

The void trembled heavily; that blood-colored barrier was actually as stable as Mount Tai!

“Let’s go!”

A voice came from within the void.

Yi Xue was overjoyed when he heard and said, “Many thanks, Progenitor, for saving me! Hahaha, Mi Tian, I’ll watch you die without a burial ground with my own eyes!”

Finished saying, he tore apart space and directly escaped.
