Chapter 1286: World Locking Gate!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This person, Ye Yuan, in front of him gave Lu Linfeng a feeling of being above the clouds.

This kind of strength, what was it if not someone in the Deity Realm?

Furthermore, Lu Linfeng faintly had a feeling earlier, that aura that saved him was actually identical with the Heavenly Dao’s!

Fang Tian looked at Lu Linfeng with sympathy and said, “You didn’t guess wrongly. Ye Yuan, he indeed broke through to Deity Realm. He is now the Divine Realm’s sole Deity Realm powerhouse!”

Lu Linfeng’s entire body trembled, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of bizarreness.

For the sake of today, he had prepared for who knows how many years and expended god knows how much effort.

Before today, Lu Linfeng had been very confident.

He was confident that his approach was the most genius idea in the Divine Realm’s 100 thousand years.

Not saying that it was definitely able to break through to the Deity Realm, but it was absolutely the most promising.

In the end, he failed!

This was originally nothing. After all, over these 100 thousand years, the people who failed were too many.

But a Deity Realm powerhouse actually really showed up in front of him!

Nothing was more demoralizing than this.

Ye Yuan knew that him appearing at this time was not some good timing. But Lu Linfeng’s relationship with him was not shallow.

To really calculate, he was even half a disciple of his.

Allowing Lu Linfeng to be killed by heavenly tribulation, Ye Yuan could not do it.

“Impossible! Even I failed, and you ... How did you accomplish it?” Lu Linfeng said, battered out of his senses.

These words sounded very arrogant, but Lu Linfeng indeed had the capital to be arrogant.

He derived a Heavenly Dao belonging to him with Formation Dao. This talent, this boldness, this strength, apart from Ye Yuan, there really was not a second person.

Even Fang Tian was also inferior to Lu Linfeng in certain aspects.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What you walk on is the Formation Dao, what I walk on is the Alchemy Dao. You derived Heavenly Dao with array formations, I completed Heavenly Dao with the Alchemy Dao; that’s all there is to it.”

Lu Linfeng’s gaze turned intent, and he muttered, “Completing Heavenly Dao with Alchemy Dao, completing Heavenly Dao with Alchemy Dao! That’s all ... there is to it?”

He naturally understood Ye Yuan’s words. In fact, Ye Yuan’s path had the same ingenuity of achieving the same goal via different means with him.

It was just that, he failed, while Ye Yuan succeeded!

Lu Linfeng keenly realized the profundities in Ye Yuan’s words. One derived Heavenly Dao with Formation Dao, the other completed Heavenly Dao with Alchemy Dao.

It looked almost the same, but actually, it was diametrically opposed!

Ye Yuan’s words were very vague, but it made Lu Linfeng suddenly feel refreshed.

Ye Yuan was telling him that his idea was too unrealistic, that was why it would fail.

Lu Linfeng could not refrain from recalling that terrifying heavenly tribulation and involuntarily palpitated with anxiety and fear.

He suddenly felt that something was wrong. Deity Realm was strong, but just now, he himself already touched the threshold of Deity Realm too. It seemed like it was still somewhat enough to choke when dealing with this heavenly tribulation.

“Ye Yuan, the heavenly tribulation just now ... even if you’re Deity Realm, it’s also impossible to resolve it so easily, right?” Lu Linfeng asked probingly.

Fang Tian smiled and said, “Ye Yuan isn’t an ordinary Deity Realm! You have been in closed-seclusion all along and probably don’t know what happened in the Divine Realm. Ye Yuan is already the Divine Realm’s controller now, surmounting above all life.”

“C-Controller?” Lu Linfeng’s pupils constricted. He was frightened by this term.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “Old Fart Lu, you don’t need to be disheartened either. With your talent, as long as you cultivate according to conventional routine, there’s still a chance to corroborate the Great Dao again. Making a move earlier was just returning the favor of you imparting to me your knowledge.”

Lu Linfeng’s face was ashen pale, and he said with self-ridicule, “Talk is cheap for you, corroborate the Great Dao again? Easier said than done! This path doesn’t work. This Lu’s years of effort is equivalent to being in vain.”

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Great Dao leads to the same destination. How can your efforts be wasted? You should just cultivate with peace of mind. In the future, there will be an opportunity to cultivate to the Origin Deity Realm. When the time comes, it will be the time for this method of array amplifying Heavenly Dao to give off its brilliance! That’s all this Ye has to say. Old Fart Lu, you take care!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought Fang Tian and Skydistant along with him and disappeared from where they were.

Lu Linfeng trembled. Looking at the direction Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared, he did not come back to his sense for a long time.

Ye Yuan’s few short sentences revealed a lot of information!

Could it be that Ye Yuan really had a way of making that vanished Heavenly Dao of the Divine Realm’s return again?

Highly probable!

Ye Yuan’s current realm was already what he could not see through.

Furthermore, listening to the meaning in Ye Yuan’s words, after Origin Deity Realm, there were actually even higher realms!

But these were too far away for him.

Ye Yuan’s words re-ignited Lu Linfeng’s hope.

He got a backlash from Heavenly Dao, his strength greatly diminished. But Ye Yuan’s move already minimized Heavenly Dao’s damage to him to the greatest degree, preserving his foundation.

As long as he cultivated hard, he could still return to the peak.

...

Three months later, in the land of extreme east of the Divine Realm, at the end of the Garnersky Sea Region, there was a stretch of heavy fog.

The feeling that the stretch of fog gave people was extremely dangerous. Even Ye Yuan’s gaze revealed a look of dread too.

Several figures stood in the air. Ye Yuan, Fang Tian, Skydistant, Yue Mengli, White Light, Long Teng, and the rest, all came here to see Ye Yuan off.

There were four phantoms behind Ye Yuan. They were precisely the spirits of the four symbols!

“What, scared? There’s the realm barrier protecting here, the violent spatial turbulent flow can’t come in. Once you pass through the World Locking Gate, it’s the endless spatial turbulent flow after that! Do you ... still want to brave it?”

A voice came from within the void. It was precisely Kunwu.

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said, “Senior, don’t need to persuade anymore. Ye Yuan’s mind is made up!”

“Heh, truly a brat who doesn’t turn back without hitting the south wall! Forget it, if you want to court death yourself, others can’t stop you either,” Kunwu said in a disappointed and angry tone.

Ye Yuan slowly turned around and gave a bow towards the spirits of the four symbols, and said, “I’ll have to trouble four seniors!”

The spirits of the four symbols were the totem powers of the four clans and did not have consciousness. But they were subjected to the domination of the Sacred Dragon Token, that was why Ye Yuan could bring them here.

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought out the Sacred Dragon Token. A sacred aura instantly radiated the entire sea region.

The spirits of the four symbols also each split into north, south, east, west, revolving around the Sacred Dragon Token and standing in the air.

Suddenly, four clear cries billowed to the sky. The spirits of the four symbols opened their enormous mouths at the same time and spewed out a surge of powerful laws undulation, converging over towards the void.

“World Locking Gate, open!”

Four arcs of light shot to the sky and finally gathered in one place above the void.

An archaic aura that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life came from above the void.

A massive stone door manifested!

Following the appearance of this stone door, everyone only felt like their divine souls were about to collapse and dissipate.

This aura that suppressed everything truly made people collapse.

Ye Yuan’s body gave off an aura belonging to Heavenly Dao, enveloping everyone. That feeling of collapse instantly vanished into nothing.

Everyone looked at that archaic gate, unbelievably shocked.

“This is the World Locking Gate? What a powerful aura! Not reaching the Deity Realm, one can’t withstand this kind of frightening pressure at all!” Fang Tian said with a sigh.

“No idea how those Deity Realm powerhouses back then knew about this exit either. Those selfish fellows had best all be buried in the turbulent spatial flow!” White Light said with indignation.
