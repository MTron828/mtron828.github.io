1384 Favor

Inside a study room in the Myriad Treasure Tower, the atmosphere seemed somewhat oppressive.

Han Tian took his time to brew immortal tea.

This process was very long, but he did not speak all along.

Ye Yuan was not in a hurry either and just silently watched Han Tian just like this.

Finally, Han Tian brewed a cup of immortal tea and passed in front of Ye Yuan.

“You, kid, are really shrewd. A favor made the Myriad Treasure Tower and Qin Family turn against each other,” Han Tian said with a smile.

Ye Yuan got up to receive the teacup and similarly smiled and said, “Since Tower Lord made a move, you naturally think that Ye Yuan’s favor is worth this price!”

Han Tian chortled with laughter when he heard that and said, “For a mere Grotto Profound Realm to dare speak like this in front of this tower lord, you ... are the first!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Powerhouses also walk over from weaklings step by step. This Ye Yuan has no need to look down on himself.”

Han Tian nodded his head as he smiled and said, “Well said! But, people with the qualifications to say these words are not many! I admit that you’re one of them!”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Many thanks for Tower Lord’s praise!”

What a joke, Xiao Feng took a trip to Jewelhill City and interacted with Ye Yuan for a bit, and touched that threshold.

A puny little middle-stage Grotto Profound could have such magical power.

If he did not have the qualifications to say these words, who was qualified?

It was just too bad that his Dao was completely different from Xiao Feng’s. Finding Ye Yuan was no use either.

Otherwise, how could he let go of this opportunity?

One had to know that Wu Meng Capital City already had not produced a single Divine Lord Realm powerhouse in 100 thousand years!

Ye Yuan this kid was too fiendish!

It was just that this point, if Han Tian did not say, it was absolutely impossible for outsiders to know.

Even if Xiao Feng broke through his realm, no one would believe that his breakthrough had anything to do with Ye Yuan either.

Of course, apart from Han Tian!

If not for Xiao Feng admitting it personally, he absolutely would not believe it either.

It was true that the Essence Cultivating Pill’s profits were great, but it was just a middle-grade Tier 1 divine pill after all. If not because of this point, how could Han Tian possibly make a move? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“However ... you were still too rash today! Qin Nantian dotes on that lass the most. You doing so, there’s no more leeway to turn things around with the Qin Family,” Han Tian said.

“Huhu, his Qin Family already sentenced me to death. Even if I don’t make a move today, would they let me off?”

Ye Yuan recounted Qin Tian’s attitude. Han Tian was also secretly alarmed when he heard it.

If it were others, even if the Qin Family really had this kind of attitude, they would also think of ways to mitigate it.

Ye Yuan, on the other hand held this mindset: you are ruthless, I’m even more ruthless than you!

The moment he made his move, he directly killed Qin Peiyu.

“But my Myriad Treasure Tower is an outside force in the end. How would you know that me coming forward will settle the Qin Family?” Heavenly Dao said rather interestedly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s precisely because the Myriad Treasure Tower is an outside force. Hence, you all understand about keeping out of harm through discretion even more. The Qin Family’s scandalous materials, the Myriad Treasure Tower definitely won’t lack any. That girl caused the entire capital city to have a foul atmosphere, so how could you guys possibly not have her evidence in your hands?”

Han Tian was really quite surprised this time. He originally thought that Ye Yuan just randomly stumbled upon it under impulse. He did not expect that Ye Yuan had long had a well thought out plan!

That Little Fatty had some intelligence in trivial matters, but compared to Ye Yuan’s level-headedness and farsightedness, the gap was too far away!

Ye Yuan seemed reckless, but in reality, everything was already calculated.

Especially under this kind of sudden outbreak situation, for Ye Yuan to still be able to maintain such a calm head, it was truly hard to come by.

Han Tian examined his own self in his heart. Even if he was in Ye Yuan’s position, he could not do better than him too.

“Huhu, since that’s the case, how do you plan on returning this favor of mine?” Han Tian said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Wait until after I breakthrough! There is a pill formula that I still haven’t comprehended thoroughly. After breaking through, it should be almost there.”

Han Tian’s eyes lit up, and he said, “The same kind of medicinal pill as the Essence Cultivating Pill?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head.

“Heh, you punk, not putting your thoughts on alchemy is simply a waste!” Han Tian said, rather excitedly.

An Essence Cultivating Pill brought such immense profits to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Another even higher level medicinal pill, the Myriad Treasure Tower would really make a killing.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How does Tower Lord know that this Ye doesn’t have achievements in Martial Dao?”

Han Tian could not help choking up when he heard that.

Honestly, he really did not discern that Ye Yuan had any saving grace in Martial Dao.

...

Seeing Ye Yuan, Xie Jingyi had an embarrassed look.

“Ye Yuan, I ...”

“Huhu, that whore, I’ve long been pissed off at her! Your play today is to the satisfaction of the masses!” Ye Yuan laughed loudly, easing Little Fatty’s embarrassment.

After this incident, Ye Yuan’s vigilance toward Xie Jingyi was also completely dispelled.

Little Fatty also did not expect that he would cause such a big problem for Ye Yuan.

Even more so, he did not expect that Ye Yuan’s backing was actually so strong.

Although the Myriad Treasure Tower was an outside force, Han Tian’s strength was placed there, nobody dared to underestimate him.

“H-Haha, Lord Fatty, I, have finally done an earth-shattering major thing! Hiss ...”

When Little Fatty saw Ye Yuan’s attitude, he knew that he did not blame him.

On the contrary, because of this matter, Ye Yuan already completely accepted him.

This made a large rock in his chest finally land on the ground.

It was just that talking pulled at the wounds, hurting until he twitched.

The leather whip in Qin Peiyu’s hands was a divine artifact. Even when not employing divine essence to lash on people’s bodies, the outcome was seeing the flesh with each whip. Furthermore, it was very hard to use divine essence to treat.

Resulting in until now, the injuries on Little Fatty’s body did not improve much either.

Ye Yuan threw him an exterior-injury medicinal pill and said curiously, “How in the world did you catch that girl? How did you get yourself hurt all over?”

Little Fatty ate the medicinal pill, the whip marks and bruises on his body were currently getting better before he briefly recounted the process of him capturing Qin Peiyu.

It turned out that this fatty had long inquired thoroughly about Qin Peiyu’s travel route and deliberately dressed as a defenseless beggar, accidentally bumping into Qin Peiyu.

Qin Peiyu was surrounded by experts, Little Fatty naturally could not get close.

But when Qin Peiyu saw that Fatty was round like a meatball, her interest was stoked in an instant, using her whip to lash Little Fatty until he rolled around on the ground, like playing a spinning top, looking very interesting.

It was just that Qin Peiyu was entertained, but Fatty suffered.

A divine artifact lashing on the body was not some fun thing.

But it was also precisely because of this that that expert relaxed his vigilance. Fatty saw a gap and restrained Qin Peiyu with one shot.

That expert held back for fear of hurting Qin Peiyu. Naturally, the expert did not dare to approach either.

Little Fatty sealed Qin Peiyu’s divine sea before dragging her onto Wu Meng Plaza.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance. Feeling guilt in his heart, he said with a sigh, “Sigh, why did you do this? This matter was my fault, I shouldn’t have made wild guesses. You’ll ... lose your life like this!”

Little Fatty chuckled and said, “You, Ye Yuan, are clever. I, Little Fatty, am not dumb either! You’re a warmhearted person, lending a helping hand when we met by chance! There must be a reason that you had some suspicions toward me!”

Ye Yuan was stunned, not expecting that this guy’s heart was clear.

Little Fatty suddenly changed his expression again and said very carefully, “Ye Yuan, is it really okay? That Qin Nantian left ruthless words before leaving.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “He’s merely giving himself a way out. The things that the Qin Family themselves did, he’s even clearer than us! This incident, he can only swallow the broken teeth into his stomach!”
