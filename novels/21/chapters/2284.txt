Chapter 2288: Kneel and Apologize

“Looks like this emperor still has to do it!”

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not take any action, Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather calmly pointed a finger out and was about to eradicate Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, a figure suddenly blocked in front of Ye Yuan and casually waved his hand, extinguishing this attack.

Seeing the arrival, Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather’s pupils constricted, and he said with a bow, “Lord Zi Jin!”

Zi Jin ignored him. He turned around and gave a bow toward Ye Yuan, saying, “Medicine Ancestor’s disciple, Zi Jin, offers greetings to Second Sage.’

Hearing the name Second Sage, Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather’s expression changed wildly.

Who in the world did not know him!

This alchemy world’s upstart, Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather had long heard of his name like a thunderclap piercing the ear.

But he had not seen Ye Yuan before!

A chill ran down Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather’s back. Only then did he know that he caused huge trouble.

The commotion at this side was blown up very big and already attracted quite a number of powerhouses to stop and watch.

Hearing Zi Jin’s words, everyone looked toward Ye Yuan, extremely surprised.

“He’s the legendary Second Sage? I really couldn’t tell! So young and he’s actually already so impressive!”

“I heard that Second Sage’s alchemy strength can already rival peak Eight-star Alchemy Gods, wonder if it’s true or fake.”

“Tsk tsk, Lord Azurefeather was too much just now. This matter probably can’t be settled.”

... ...

The name of Second Sage had long already been resounding like the roar of thunder in the alchemy world.

It was just that the people who had seen Ye Yuan before could be counted with one’s fingers.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Huhu, your Cloudheart Realm’s way of hospitality, this Ye is considered to have experienced it.”

Zi Jin’s gaze flickered slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “Azurefeather, why haven’t you come over and apologize to Lord Second Sage!”

Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather could only toughen his scalp and come over. Giving a bow toward Ye Yuan, he said, “Azurefeather didn’t know that Second Sage has arrived, resulting in offending Second Sage. Please pardon my offense!”

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “Brother Azurefeather, what did you say just now? This Ye didn’t hear clearly. Can you repeat it again?”

Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather’s expression was extremely ugly, Ye Yuan’s warning was still ringing in his ears.

Just now, he still did not feel anything. But currently, his face felt burning hot, like he had been slapped twice.

Of course, these two slaps were dealt by himself.

He postured too much earlier.

Just finished saying that Cloudheart Realm’s people would never apologize to outsiders, in a blink, he slapped his own face.

“Azurefeather had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. I hope that Second Sage can calm your anger.” Azurefeather was helpless and could only apologize once again.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you don’t deal with affairs fairly and show off your power, forget it. But just now, you had killing intent toward this Ye! You wouldn’t think that this will slide with such a light and floaty sentence, right?”

Azurefeather’s expression changed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Lord Second Sage, this emperor is at any rate Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor too. You don’t need to be so persistent, right? Don’t be too ruthless, so that we can meet on good terms in the future!”

A Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor naturally had the pride of a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

This level of a powerhouse was already standing at the summit of the Heavenspan World.

Deva Realm powerhouses mostly remained reclusive, very rarely did anyone show their face.

And Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperors could be said to be existences that rule a region of the world.

Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather knew that Ye Yuan’s status was extraordinary, but he was only a little guy who just entered Heavenly Emperor after all.

Him apologizing to Ye Yuan was already giving adequate face, he was actually still not satisfied!

Ye Yuan ignored him, but looked at Zi Jin and said with a smile, “Brother Zi Jin, what do you say?”

Zi Jin’s expression was also ugly. He did not expect that Ye Yuan had not entered Cloudheart Realm yet and both sides already fell out so badly.

To be honest, he also did not know why Master regarded Ye Yuan so highly.

But Master gave the instructions, to have him make sure to settle Ye Yuan down well.

In contrast, Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather’s face was nothing.

“Azurefeather, kneel down!” Zi Jin suddenly said in a solemn voice.

Azurefeather’s expression changed drastically and he said, “Lord Zi Jin!”

“Kneel! Apologize!” Zi Jin’s tone became unprecedentedly harsh.

Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather had a look of unwillingness on his face. Looking at Ye Yuan fiercely, he wished to kill him.

But, under Zi Jin’s powerful pressure, he could only grit his teeth and kneel.

Following Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather kneeling down in the air, a series of exclamations came from the sides.

A Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor actually knelt down toward someone!

This level of existence had always been high and mighty in their eyes, akin to gods.

But now, a god-like existence in their eyes actually knelt down!

If Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather knelt to a Deva Realm, they would not be so surprised too.

But, the target of his kneeling was merely a little guy who had just entered Heavenly Emperor!

No matter if Ye Yuan was the Second Sage; he was too young after all.

Not everyone had the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s level of judgment, being able to discern Ye Yuan’s extraordinariness.

In the hearts of the vast majority of the people, Ye Yuan was merely just a genius. That was all.

A genius and a powerhouse were two totally different concepts.

A powerhouse, that was a leviathan who truly commanded a region; his every movement and action could affect the direction of the Heavenspan World.

While a genius only had the potential of becoming a powerhouse.

Before growing up, geniuses were merely just geniuses too.

But such a person actually pressured a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor into kneeling and apologizing!

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather and said coolly, “Looks like Brother Azurefeather is very unconvinced.”

Azurefeather glared at Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice, “Today’s matter, Azurefeather has noted it down!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Are you very confused? Doesn’t matter, you’ll understand very soon.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned to Zi Jin and said, “Brother Zi jin, how to deal with those two?”

Over there, Leng Tianhao was long already frightened silly, even forgetting his pain. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Who was he posturing in front of just now?

Second Sage!

His big brother, Leng Tianqi was indeed formidable, but he was also merely the Medicine Ancestor’s grand-pupil.

While Second Sage was an existence on equal footing as the Sacred Ancestor High Priest!

Even his big brother’s master was a junior in front of Ye Yuan too!

He actually said to Baili Qingyan just now that there was no future in following this boy?

Zi Jin gave Leng Tianhao a glance and said coolly, “Cut off both hands and punish him by confining him back in the clan for 5000 years! Wonder if Second Sage is still satisfied with this punishment?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Can!”

Whoosh!

A cold light flashed, Leng Tianhao’s two hands were severed at the wrist.

“Ahh! My ... My hands!” Leng Tianhao screamed miserably.

With Zi Jin taking action, the wounds carried the power of source.

Wanting to regrow a pair of hands was probably not so easy.

An alchemist losing both hands was tantamount to cutting off all of his future.

This punishment could not be said to not be heavy.

“Bring him back and confine for 5000 years! If anyone in the Leng Family is unconvinced, say that this is my verdict!” Zi Jin looked at the old man and said coolly.

His level of status and strength, a single word was worth a thousand pieces of gold.

He said to confine for 5000 years, the Leng Family absolutely would not dare to let him out at 4999 years.

The Leng Family’s ancestor’s strength was strong, but in front of the Medicine Ancestor, he was nothing.

Furthermore, legends had it that the Leng Family’s ancestor was originally a nominal disciple of the Medicine Ancestor.

Regarding Zi Jin’s words, the Leng Family absolutely would not dare to defy.

Everyone was extremely puzzled when they saw this scene.

They did not understand why Lord Zi Jin would be so respectful toward Second Sage.

The old man’s expression changed several times. But in the end, he still brought away Leng Tianhao who was wailing in pain and left.
