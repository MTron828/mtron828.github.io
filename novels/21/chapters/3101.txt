Chapter 3100: Illusionary Flowers Burying Gods!

“So strong! He … He can actually stand up to a Peak Hegemon has an equal!”

“This is also too monstrous. Emperor Sakra Heaven versus Peak Hegemon, this is something unprecedented!”

“If he were to really break through to Hegemon Realm, how terrific would that be? Most likely, even Progenitor won’t be able to restrain him too!”

…..

Practically all of the blood race powerhouses trembled!

What this punch broke was the rule since time immemorial, frightening them greatly!

The powerful talent and combat power that Ye Yuan exhibited were sufficient to make myriad worlds tremble.

He looked at Bloodpromise and said coldly, “Peak Hegemon is nothing more than this too! Now, I’m going to fight side by side with Brother Feng. Do you still have any objections?”

Bloodpromise’s face had long already become black as the bottom of a pot.

When Ye Yuan piggybacked Feng Xiaotian, it seemed so laughable.

No one thought that Ye Yuan could really avenge Feng Xiaotian.

It was because the die was already cast.

But in a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan produced clouds with one turn of the hand and rain with another, directly reversing the battle situation, encircling Bloodpromise and turning Bloodpromise into a turtle in the jar.

......

Until now, people also did not think that he really had the strength to contend with Bloodpromise.

After all, Bloodpromise was not an ordinary person!

He was a blood race’s genius, a powerful Peak Hegemon!

The group of Peak Hegemons was commanded by him. This was sufficient to see his status in his blood race.

But Ye Yuan told the world how strong he was with just one punch!

Battling Hegemons did not need one to be in the Hegemon Realm at all.

Suddenly, Bloodpromise’s aura changed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Do you really think that this is my true strength? Even if you can jump realms and battle, so what? Want to beat me, be careful that it will cost your own life too!”

At this point, he no longer harbored any mentality of getting lucky.

He already had some realization that this was a certain-death situation. It was impossible to make Ye Yuan let him off.

A beast at bay would put up a desperate fight!

Since that was the case, he naturally had to put up a desperate fight!

As long as he killed Ye Yuan, he would have profited too!

The current Bloodpromise seemingly attained new life. Even his entire person’s temperament changed.

He was far removed from the masses to begin with, his momentum shocking. It was just that two people appeared in his life, one Feng Xiaotian and one Ye Yuan.

This made him become somewhat irritated and somewhat lacking in confidence.

But, at the brink of desperation, the hot-bloodedness in his bones was already completely stimulated.

Seeing this scene, many people started to worry.

“This guy wouldn’t be playing with fire and burn himself, right? Bloodpromise, this guy, isn’t someone that’s easy to deal with. His combat power that erupts, having all means of retreat be cut off, would definitely be very shocking!” When Yang Qing saw this scene, he said rather worriedly.

Feng Qingxuan bit her lips lightly and said, “This guy just likes to mess around! Victory is clearly within grasp, but he insists on showing off his ability!”

Yang Qing shook his head and said, “You don’t understand. Some things have to be done! If it were me, I’d be the same too!”

Feng Qingxuan frowned, her eyes revealing a look of worry.

She indeed did not understand, but she was very worried about Ye Yuan.

At present, Yang Qing and Feng Qingxuan had already stepped into Hegemon Realm, their strength extremely formidable.

However, under this kind of great battle, their strength was still too weak.

At this time, they had all sustained heavy injuries, but they were still killing the enemy courageously.

Within a short time, Bloodpromise’s imposing momentum directly rose to the apex of Peak Hegemon!

He was only half a step away from Supreme Hegemon too!

One blood-colored petal after another spilled over from Bloodpromise’s body, scattering over heaven and earth.

Very soon, countless blood flowers teemed the sky.

Swoosh!

A blood flower floating straight toward Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan dodged slightly, avoiding the blood flower.

Puchi!

A gash was actually cut open on Ye Yuan’s face!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. He had clearly just avoided the blood flower but was cut!

Puchi!

A gash was also cut on Feng Xiaotian’s shoulder, fresh blood flowing down.

Ye Yuan’s heart turned slightly cold. These blood flowers were not simple!

He looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Are you thinking why would you get injured when you clearly avoided my God-Burying Flower?”

Ye Yuan did not answer. Bloodpromise seemed to not have the intention of letting him answer too, and continued, “This move is called Illusionary Flowers Burying Gods! It’s a divine ability that I comprehended when I broke through to Peak Hegemon. Even Feng Xiaotian hasn’t tried this move before too! This move is derived from my lifetime’s comprehension. Experience it well!”

“Ye Yuan, you’re going to pay the price for your conceit! If you ordered them to kill me, there wouldn’t be the current consequence. Now, it’s too late! If I’m dying, you’ll have to be buried in death with me too!”

Suddenly, Bloodpromise became brutal, and everyone’s expression changed.

Blood flowers that filled the sky swept over toward Ye Yuan frenziedly.

Bloodpromise said that it was too late. It was because the current Ye Yuan was already completely encircled by God-Burying Flowers and could not get out at all.

Ye Yuan’s expression was unchanging, his figure directly turning into an afterimage, disappearing!

Pffft!

Pffft!

Pffft!

Above the void, the sound of sharp knives tearing flesh and blood would come over from time to time.

Yang Qing’s expression changed drastically, and he said, “Not good, Ye Yuan is in danger! His spatial origin is actually being restrained!”

Blood flowers that filled the skies danced wildly, giving people a breathtaking feeling.

But amidst this stunning beauty, killing intent crisscrossed, making people feel a chill run down their spines.

Everyone felt the power of this move!

Everyone knew about Ye Yuan’s spatial means.

But here, Ye Yuan actually did not have the leeway to unleash it!

Cloudmount’s pupils constricted, and he roared wildly at those bloodline warriors, “What are you all still waiting for? Attack together and kill Bloodpromise!”

Among the bloodline warriors, there was already quite a number who had regained their intelligence.

It was only to hear a few wild roars. The bloodline warriors made up of Hegemons mobilized!

Bloodpromise’s expression changed slightly, but the seals in his hand became even more phantasmagoric.

“No need!”

Amidst the blood flowers came Ye Yuan’s cold yell.

A figure appeared. When everyone saw Ye Yuan, they could not help feeling a chill in their hearts.

The clothes on Ye Yuan’s body were sliced into ribbons.

Some exposed skin was flayed open and the flesh torn. It was a ghastly sight.

Those with sharp eyes could even see that something seemed to be propagating in those flesh and blood, attempting to corrode them.

Compared to Ye Yuan, there were actually only a scanty few wounds on the body of Feng Xiaotian, who was behind him!

Very clearly, the vast majority of the attacks were blocked by Ye Yuan with his own body.

“Hahaha … Really loyal to brothers! Feng Xiaotian is merely a dead man. But you’d rather receive the baptism of the God-Burying Flower yourself than be willing to let this dead person get injured? How touching! How … stupid to the extreme!” When Bloodpromise saw this scene, he could not help letting out a wild laugh.

Ye Yuan’s actions were simply laughable to the extreme in his eyes.

Carrying a dead man and saying that he wanted to fight side by side.

Now, being in a disadvantageous position, he would rather suffer serious injuries than be willing to let a dead person suffer any bit of harm.

Was this called loyalty?

This was called stupidity!

Ye Yuan looked at him and still said calmly, “How can someone like you understand what genuine brotherhood love is?”

Bloodpromise laughed loudly and said, “I understand! Of course I understand! The so-called brotherhood love is to set off for the Yellow Springs together! Therefore, you can set off together with Feng Xiaotian! This seat will send you off!”

A surge of explosive origin suddenly poured out wildly from Bloodpromise’s body.

He was burning his life force!

Above the void, the density of the God-Burying Flower became extremely terrifying, virtually covering the sky and blotting out the sun.

Ye Yuan’s entire person was completely submerged! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When everyone saw this scene, their expressions changed wildly!
