Chapter 2694: Fighting the Previous Generation!

“It’s here?”

Ye Yuan looked at the two islands ahead and was absorbed in thought.

Between the two islands was a glimpse of the sky.

That appearance was clearly being split by someone with a sword!

Currently, Ye Yuan was very far away from the island. But a sword energy that made the heart palpitate was faintly coming from there.

A dragon head and human body seafolk was standing next to Ye Yuan. Who could it be if not the Black Flood Dragon King?

More than a year had passed since the trip to the Land of Dragon Slumber.

Ye Yuan did not leave Thistle South Sea Region right away, but held down the fort in the dragon palace for as long as a year, stabilizing the situation in Thistle South.

Black Flood Dragon King hated Ye Yuan to the bones, but he had nothing to say about Ye Yuan’s behavior and conduct.

At present, he had already become a cripple and could only resign himself to fate.

After staying for a long time, Ye Yuan’s understanding of the sea race also became better.

Not long ago, Ye Yuan learned from Black Shark that more than ten thousand years ago, a human powerhouse had once crossed the seven great sea regions and set off for the south.

At that time, it caused a mighty uproar in the seven great sea regions.

Actually, the seven great sea regions back then were not like the current situation. They were under the rule of three Saint Sovereign Heavens.

The appearance of that human powerhouse triggered a joint attack by the three great Saint Sovereign Heavens.

As a result, four great Saint Sovereign Heavens unfolded a grand battle in this stretch of sea region that Ye Yuan was standing at.

The human powerhouse slew the three great Saint Sovereign Heavens here by himself with one sword.

This island was cleaved apart by the human powerhouse’s one sword slash!

Ever since then, the seven great sea regions had fallen into chaos.

Only all the way until later seven great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens rose up did the seven great sea regions recover to their current situation.

“That’s right, it’s here! That great battle caused a great sensation in the entire seven great sea regions. Back then, I was just a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven and had the fortune to witness that grand battle. That human powerhouse was too strong!”

Mentioning that person, Black Flood Dragon King still had lingering fear in his heart now.

One had to know, a human fighting with the sea race in the ocean was a great disadvantage to begin with.

But that person suppressed the three great Saint Sovereign Heavens from beginning to end.

That sort of power virtually made people despair.

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered indeterminately, he thought of someone.

Zhuo Bufan!

Calculating from the time, it seemed to be precisely what happened after Zhuo Bufan’s disappearance.

There was a legend at that time that Zhuo Bufan walked toward the sea and left. It was just that people did not know whether it was real or fake story.

But looking at it now, perhaps this really happened.

Ye Yuan could not think of anyone who had this ability apart from Zhuo Bufan, to be able to overpower three great sea race Saint Sovereign Heavens with his power alone!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan stepped forward and walked toward the island.

Black Flood Dragon King’s expression changed, and he said, “You can’t go! That sword energy is priming with the power of Great Dao. It has stayed on this island for more than ten thousand years and still hasn’t decayed too much to this date! Even us, these half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens, can’t enter the center of the sword energy too! If you go, you’ll die without a burial ground!”

Ye Yuan ignored him and continued advancing.

The further he advanced, the more piercing cold the sword energy became.

Swish!

A wound was cut on Ye Yuan’s face, fresh blood dripping down.

However, Ye Yuan was oblivious and continued advancing.

And the sword intent in his body actually involuntarily seeped out of his body, turning into a small seedling.

When Black Flood Dragon King saw this scene, he could not help saying gloatingly, “Not listening to the advice of the elderly, suffering is right ahead! How can the power of a Saint Sovereign Heaven be what you can imagine? But it’s best that you get hacked into minced meat by this sword intent!”

Black Flood Dragon King was conflicted about Ye Yuan currently.

He hoped for Ye Yuan to go and die from the bottom of his heart.

But, the present Thistle South Sea Region’s situation also indeed needed him to stabilize.

In his view, Ye Yuan’s action was no different from seeking death.

Even if he controlled the Emerald Sea Divine Conch to defeat him, under this sword intent, he was still insignificant like an ant.

In his sea of consciousness, Mi Tian said, “What a domineering sword energy, you can’t get in.”

Clearly, he also felt this astonishing sword intent and woke up from his deep sleep.

“I know,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“You’ll die like this.” Mi Tian said.

“I won’t. I want to see until which point I can walk,” Ye Yuan said.

Ye Yuan did not underestimate his own capability, but he was not conceited until he thought that he could compare to Zhuo Bufan currently.

But, regarding this legendary figure, he indeed really wanted to broaden his knowledge.

Walking until here, Ye Yuan basically already confirmed that this sword intent was indeed left behind by Zhuo Bufan.

Because this sword intent was somewhat similar to Luo Yunqing.

Who Luo Yunqing admired the most and held in greatest esteem in his life was Zhuo Bufan.

So, he walked Zhuo Bufan’s path too. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was just that Luo Yunqing’s sword intent was far too lacking when compared to Zhuo Bufan.

The sword energy became fiercer and fierce, and increasingly dense, virtually unavoidable.

The wounds on Ye Yuan’s body became more and more.

He was carefully feeling the flow of the sword intent, feeling this unparalleled, domineering sword intent.

Ye Yuan was greatly stirred!

Zhuo Bufan was well-deserving of being an existence that could overwhelm Rainclear Continent.

Too strong!

Ye Yuan’s sword intent was like a firefly compared to the bright moon in front of this sword intent!

This sword intent was too pure, too sublime!

Too … powerful!

This kind of strength was an unreasonable strength!

No matter how exceedingly formidable your means, I would cut it with one sword!

For more than ten thousand years, the sword intent condensed and did not scatter. It could be seen how powerful this sword intent was.

The further forward, the stronger the oppressive force.

Sword intent was secondary, but Ye Yuan felt that astonishing will from the sword intent.

This was the root of Zhuo Bufan’s might!

However, this also aroused Ye Yuan’s pride!

At this moment, Ye Yuan completely entered a state of selflessness. His entire being was used to feel the sword intent.

This shocking sword intent dashed around on the island, seemingly disorderly and unsystematic.

But Ye Yuan was similarly proficient in Sword Dao. He could feel the faintly discernible rule undulation in it.

This was Sword Dao. This was a world of swords!

How could it possibly be disorderly and unsystematic?

The eight transformed swords fully bloomed at this moment.

They unfolded a frenzied exchange with Zhuo Bufan’s sword intent.

But Ye Yuan’s hand was gripped on the branch.

The ninth transformed sword!

At this moment, Ye Yuan urged his Sword Dao to the extreme.

He was currently in a situation as if fighting with an invisible opponent, the battle situation fierce to the extreme.

Far away, Black Flood Dragon King watched until his countenance changed visibly.

He completely did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually be strong to such an extent.

Furthermore, the road that Ye Yuan covered currently already far exceeded ordinary Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

This place was the seven great sea regions’ legendary place.

Every year, there were powerhouses and geniuses that came here to challenge the sword intent.

But there were very few who could survive.

In these ten thousand years, many genius powerhouses had sprung up in the sea race too.

There was once a genius that had extremely high hopes of reaching Saint Sovereign Heaven. When he was at peak Jade Sovereign Heaven, he came to challenge the sword intent here.

In the end, he fell at a place that was still ten thousand feet away from the island.

Stepping on the island and entering that fissure, that place was where the sword intent was at the height of its power.

And currently, Ye Yuan was 15 thousand feet away from the island!

This result already made many Jade Sovereign Heavens perspire from embarrassment..
