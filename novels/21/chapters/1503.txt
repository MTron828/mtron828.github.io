Chapter 1507 No Way!

“Younger Sister Yi Han, you’re a dignified Fiend Lord powerhouse and even a Blood Yama Hall’s hall master. A puny little Two-star Fiend Apothecary, you can’t even subdue him?”

In front of Yi Han was a man in black robes. His expression was somewhat dark, clearly very unhappy.

Yi Han saw him getting angry, but she just smiled sweetly and said, “Big Brother Mo Han, talk is cheap! Wait until after entering the ancient ruins, you can deal with him however you like. But right now, I really can’t subdue him! Don’t you question this. This brat is clever and isn’t easy to knead. Things that he isn’t willing to do, even if you break him in half, he won’t take a step back either!”

This Mo Han was Blackjade Capital City’s Blood Yama Hall’s hall master.

Kong Xiao could only pass this matter for him to know through secret channels in his helplessness.

Mo Han regarded this matter quite highly too and immediately rushed over from Blackjade Capital City.

He knew that Blackjade Capital City had already become all of the capital cities’ laughing stock, angering him until he directly gave Kong Xiao two large slaps.

If not looking on the account that his alchemy skills were pretty good, he would have directly eradicated Kong Xiao.

Angry was angry, but what should be remedied ultimately had to be patched up.

Hence, he personally found Yi Han, but who knew that Yi Han actually said that she had no way.

A Fiend Lord powerhouse was actually powerless against a Fiend General. Wouldn’t it make people laugh their heads off if this got out?

Mo Han said with a cold snort, “You’re powerless against him, is it? I’ll go and meet him personally. I want to see just how tough his bones are!”

Yi Han said coolly, “If you want to pressure him with strength, I advise that you’d better not go! Putting aside whether he agrees or not, if you get on his nerves, my side isn’t easy to clean up the mess! You also know what entering the ancient ruin this time means. I don’t want him to show up for work but not exert himself after going in. You have to know, I only tethered him with the blood essence contract!”

Mo Han’s expression was slightly dark as he said, “Your meaning is to have me go and beg him?”

Yi Han smiled and said, “Why not? Don’t think that your status is noble. You aren’t aware that his current standing among Fiend Apothecaries, probably even you, this Blood Yama Hall Master, can’t compare too! Don’t talk about Two-star Fiend Apothecaries, even that bunch of Three-star Fiend Apothecaries all maintained manners of a student in front of him too. It is just that his current realm is still significantly lacking. When he grows up, you and I are both not enough to look at in front of him!”

Mo Han’s gaze turned slightly intent, looking at Yi Han rather surprisedly.

This appraisal was also a bit too high, right?

He knew this Ye Yuan was formidable. But his understanding of Ye Yuan was all gotten from hearsay.

Mo Han came to find Yi Han straight away. He really did not understand the situation inside the city right now.

Could it be that this Source Night was really formidable to this kind of degree?

“Alright then, I promise you not to overwhelm him with force! I want to take a look at just what kind of person this brat is” Mo Han said in a solemn voice.

...

“No way!”

When Ye Yuan found out Mo Han’s intention of coming, he directly threw him these two words.

Mo Han’s expression instantly turned dark.

This punk was also too freaking arrogant, right?

He was an exalted Blood Yama Hall Master, a Fiend Lord Realm powerhouse, you actually did not even acknowledge me?

Mo Han was just about to fly off the handle but saw Yi Han winking at him non-stop.

Mo Han forcefully pressed down the anger in his heart and said, “This matter was all Kong Xiao’s fault. I’ve already severely punished him and removed his position as the hall master! Master Source Night, you’re a magnanimous person. Don’t stoop to his level.”

Although he said so verbally, a Fiend Lord powerhouse lowering his head to a Fiend General, this was simply unprecedented humiliation.

After the matter of the ancient ruins had passed, he would definitely find a chance to deal with this brat.

With Ye Yuan’s eyesight, how could he not perceive that the other party’s words were not sincere?

He just said indifferently, “I have my principles. Since I said to blacklist Blackjade Capital City, I never intended to take it back. Whoever comes to plead is useless too!”

“You!” Mo Han could not help being exasperated. This punk was also too impervious to everything.

He, a Fiend Lord powerhouse, already put the words to this kind of extent. Ye Yuan actually did not even give face!

“Alright, you state the terms! As long as we can let our people listen to you preach on the Dao, I’m willing to pay a certain price!” Mo Han said.

Yi Han by the side could not help revealing a peculiar expression. Why did this sound so strange?

A feeling of ... asking for it.

But Mo Han himself clearly did not think so. He was currently in a fit of anger and very aggrieved, how would he think of these?

However, Ye Yuan still said coolly, “Hall Master Mo Han, I think that you’re misunderstanding something. Even if you give me your position as hall master, I don’t care for it too. Alright, please go back.”

The Mo Han who had restrained his anger and suppressed indignation all along finally exploded.

“Me! What a rampant punk, do you really think that this hall master doesn’t dare to do anything to you?”

While talking, a surge of powerful pressure spread out from Mo Han, crushing over toward Ye Yuan.

Yi Han was long prepared. The power on her body suddenly released too, blocking Mo Han.

“Brother Mo Han, too far! If you’re like this, I won’t be courteous anymore!” Yi Han said in a solemn voice.

Mo Han said with a cold snort, “Yi Han, I’ll give you face this time! Punk, don’t land in my hands! Otherwise, you’ll die very horribly!”

Finished talking, Mo Han directly shuttled through the void, disappearing.

Yi Han looked at Ye Yuan and could not help saying with a bitter smile, “Why did you have to do this? What’s in it for you to offend a Fiend Lord powerhouse?”

But Ye Yuan said indifferently, “Even if the sky falls, isn’t there Hall Master Yi Han to support? I have my principles in doing things. Some things that are done, one will have to bear the consequences.”

Yi Han looked at Ye Yuan with gloomy resentfulness and said, “You brat, really making people worry!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

...

A month’s time, more and more capital cities’ Fiend Apothecaries gathered in Capone Capital City.

For some time, Capone Capital City became the holy land of Fiend Apothecaries.

Through Capone Capital City’s Fiend Medicine Hall’s statistics, the Fiend Apothecaries that came to listen to Ye Yuan preach on Dao this time were a total of 5000 over people.

These fiend apothecaries were subordinates of the Fiend Medicine Halls.

The others, even Capone Capital City’s Fiend Apothecaries, did not have the qualifications to listen to Ye Yuan preach the Dao.

Capone Capital City’s Fiend Apothecaries had long heard of Master Source Night’s great reputation.

It was just too bad that they were not in a favorable position, and could not get the moon first too.

How could the Fiend Medicine Hall possibly let other forces’ Fiend Apothecaries come and benefit from their own light?

Capone Capital City’s Fiend Medicine Hall’s Fiend Apothecaries all felt honored.

This kind of grand occasion, they had never seen before from birth until now!

All of the Fiend Apothecaries were akin to making a pilgrimage, pouring into Capone Capital City.

Due to overwhelming numbers, the Fiend Medicine Hall had long been unable to accommodate the Fiend Apothecaries’ observation.

Therefore, it was stipulated later on that only the hall masters of the various capital cities’ Fiend Medicine Halls could enter inside to observe.

Finally, it was time for the sermon on this day.

Passing from mouth to mouth, the Fiend Apothecaries later had already long learned how terrifying Ye Yuan’s strength was from the initial-most batch of Fiend Apothecaries.

Regarding this sermon, it could be said to be anticipated by millions.
