Chapter 2800: Secretly Killing!

Translatcr: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Chile, chase after! Kill them for me!”

Han Guang?s angry roar reverberated above the sea.

One sword inflicted heavy wounds onto him!

What Ye Yuan’s sword chopped was his Dao!

The current Han Guang, although he revived, his strength was greatly

diminished and was not even as good as Chile.

Actually, without waiting for Han Guang?s instructions, Chile chased into the

fog right away,

But, merely a short while later , he retreated again.

“Commander Han Guang, their auras disappeared!” Chile said with a solemn

expression,

Han Guang?s gaze turned intent, and he shouted angrily, “Everyone heeds my

order. Conduct a carpet search in the fog! Once you discover their traces, kill

without amnesty!”

This army was composed of 5000 blood race Saint Sovereign Heavens!

After obeying the order , 5000 people searched the fog in an orderly manner,

Han Guang and Chile also entered the fog. However, Han Guang’s brows

immediately knitted together.

I was seriously injured by that brat and can’t sense them anymore! Damn it! I

didn’t expect that that punk is actually a divergent cultivator! Furthermore,

he’s so powerful!- Han Guang was also stunned by Ye Yuan’s sword.

Directly crossing a major realm to chop the enemy, what kind of terrifying

strength was this?

If not for the tenacious vitality of the blood race, he would have immediately

died from that just now!

Lord Commander, what should we do now? That boy seems to have the means

to hide in this fog!” Chile said in a solemn voice.

Han Guangs gaze flickered, and he said somberly, ?you go straight to the other

side to guard. We absolutely cant let them enter Heaven One Continent! That

boy only has the power of one strike. presently, his Dao sword suffered

damage. It’s absolutely impossible to slash out a second time! As long as they

dare to show their faces, kill them! I’ll wait for Commander Luo Chuan they all

here. Once the army arrives, well immediately charge into Heaven One

Continent. At that time, whether or not they get out won’t matter anymore!”

Chiles expression turned somber, and he obeyed the order and left.

In the fog, the figures of Ye Yuan and the rest became dusky, merging into one

with the surrounding fog, making it extremely difficult to find.

In this fog, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch could unleash the greatest effect.

Even if these Saint Sovereign Heavens passed by them, they could forget about

finding them too.

Master Ye, are you alright?” Big Yellow asked concernedly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ye Yuan’s complexion was deathly pale as he said weakly, “I wont die.

However, my Dao sword has been severely damaged and needs to be nurtured

This move held incredible power, but it was a mutual destruction fighting

The Dao sword was linked to Ye Yuan’ s life. They were bound together for good

or ill.

Dao sword was where Ye Yuan’s foundation lay. Once it was executed at full

power , its power was much stronger than the Sword of Heaven Killing. But the

sequela was also immense.

Within half a month, Ye Yuan had no way of taking action.

Ye Yuan’ s Dao sword was currently in the Myriad Realms Mountain, mrrowing

the grandmist energy to nurture.

Grandmist energy was the source of all things. It could nurture the Dao sword.

If not for this, he would not be able to re-condense the Dao sword within a few

you this fellow, to actually still be hiding such a powerful move, are you

planning on using it to ambush me, this Heaven One Continent’s overlord?-

Yang Qing cried out strangely.

Jingfeis mouth curled, and she said disdainfully , ?With your pathetic

appearance , Big Brother Ye Yuan can pummel you with one hand. Is there still

a need to sneak attack you?”

Yang Qing smiled coldly and said, “That’s just temporary! This exalt is going to

break through to True Sovereign Heaven right away. At that time, wouldn’t I

abuse him a thousand times over?”

Alou keep talking nonsense, and you can get out for me! Go face the blood race

army alone by yourself!” Ye Yuan yelled coldly.

The moment Yang Qing heard, he indeed shut up sensibly.

These blood race members were too strong. They could not be killed at all, If he

went out, it would be certain death!

“Master Ye, that True Sovereign Heaven already went to the other side. We

can’t get out now either. What do we do?” Big Yellow said worriedly,

“Kill!”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned cold, and he said, “This fog is our natural barrier!

That middle True Sovereign Heaven was heavily wounded by my Dao sword. He

definitely won’t be able to recover to the peak within a month. The True

Sovereign Heaven on the other side is afraid of us entering the Heaven One

Continent. He absolutely won’t dare to come in easily. Then we’ll kill them until

they are terrified!”

The moment Yang Qing heard, he could not help being greatly excitedly and

said, “Heh heh, this is good, this is good!”

lingfei, who craved nothing short of the world being plunged into chaos, was

naturally very excited too.

With two True Sovereign Heavens around, they had nowhere to hide under the

Emerald Sea Divine Conch too.

But, if it was just one True Sovereign Heaven, when the Emerald Sea Divine

Conch activated water rule and hid in the fog, it was like nature itself!

They could turn into hunters in the fog.

And the blood race army would be their prey!

Damn it, where are those few fellows hiding? We’ve already searched the fog

several times and didn’t even see a damn thing! Could it be that they can still

evaporate into thin air?”

They must have some concealment means. We cant lower our guard! ?

“Sigh, what methods can they have? That strongest punk is already half- dead!

But, got to say, that sword of his was really terrifying, to actually kill

Commander Han Guang with one sword! I’m still a little scared until now!?

Stop talking nonsense! Hurry up and search! This fog is too big. The 5000 of

us can’t even set off any waves after spreading in. ?

A blood race team was currently searching the fog Due to that, their divine

sense detection range was very small. They could only patrol back and forth

continuously.

It was just that three days had passed. They did not find Ye Yuan five peoples

shadows at all.

The army of 4900 people split into squads of 49, carrying out a carpet search

of the entire fog area.

This squad was one of them.

At the back of the team, a ball of water quietly enveloped the three people who

were talking just now, without making a sound-

These three people were merely middle Saint Sovereign Heavens. Being

covered up by this ball of water, they got a big shock and instinctively wanted

to cry for help. But, they could not cry out in the water curtain at alL

At this time, a figure appeared.

Yang Qing looked at these three people with a playful face and sudden ly

stabbed a spear towards one of them.

This spear did not have the slightest rule fluctuation.

But, after the tip of the spear pierced into the body of that blood race member,

a terrifying destructive power exploded in his body.

That blood race member was directly wiped out by Yang Qing.

At the same time, the two blood race members beside him also directly turned

into nothingness without making a sound.

It turned out that Ye Yuan injected two streams of sword energy and directly

garroted these two.

Yang Qing gnashed his teeth in hatred and said angrily, “You snatched my

people again!”

Ye Yuan made a shushing hand gesture, signaling for Yang Qing to leave.

The two figures escaped into the fog again, disappearing.

Very soon, another squad passed by them.

When Yang Qing saw this scene, his expression could not help changing

slightly.

They nearly got exposed.

“You this fellow, killing people too slowly!” Ye Yuan looked toward Yang Qing

and said lightly.

Yang Qing was angered until his expression was livid, but there was nothing

that he could do.

Wanting to immediately obliterate and also not make any sound, it was really

difficult!

Sniff yowre really a freak!

Even killing people is faster than me!
