Chapter 2632: Convincing!

A salted fish had a day where it gained a new lease on life too!

Even Wu Chengchao himself also did not dare to believe this result in front of him.

Look at the surprised expression on his face and one would understand.

“W-When did I become so strong?” Wu Chengchao looked at his own two hands as he said with a look of disbelief.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s not that you’re strong, but that they are too weak! Your current strength is not even as good as those establishment lords that I challenged!”

Hearing this, Qu Yan’s old face could not help turning red, immediately feeling a little angry from embarrassment.

But, on second thought, what Ye Yuan said was the truth too.

Compared to the likes of Ye Yuan and Cang Yongning, he was really far too lacking.

One had to know, he was already a grade four heavenly alchemist, but he was not as good as a grade two heavenly alchemist in refining grade two heavenly pills. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The difference in between was not just an iota.

Ye Yuan looked at Duan Yongchun and said with a cold smile, “Elder Duan, don’t know if you’re satisfied with this explanation or not?”

Duan Yongchun’s face turned black and he said with a cold snort, “What can this explain?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Can’t even tell from this, that’s why I called you stupid!”

“You!” Duan Yongchun nearly lost it.

Ye Yuan ignored him, but had a serious expression as he said in a solemn voice, “Calling everyone stupid might sound a little nasty, but this is how things stand!”

One sentence made the expressions of these elders become even uglier.

However, Ye Yuan did not care at all and continued, “Why does the Pill Alliance sell medicinal pills to you all, but also cherish their heavenly medicine techniques? If not for the holy son making a move, you all, these Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, probably won’t even know that there’s true grade, right? Use your brain slightly to think and you’ll also know that there are malicious motives being covered up here!”

“The hostility between native powerhouses and ascenders has been long-standing. If Zhuo Bufan had the same thought as you guys back then, pinning hopes on that native powerhouses will coexist in peace with you all, then there also wouldn’t be today’s Five Light Heavenly Region anymore! Or is it that you all have ascended for too long and already take yourselves to be a native faction? It’s just that, you take yourselves to be a native faction, but do others treat you as their own people?”

Ye Yuan’s words were naturally filled with ridicule.

The words were harsh, but the logic was not wrong.

Got to admit, these people indeed had this kind of mentality that was making mischief.

They naturally would not think that they were native powerhouses. But the long period of peace had ground away their spirit.

They were already not those ascenders back then long ago!

There were reasons why ascenders were powerful. Firstly, it was because their road toward their present status was filled with trials and tribulations. Secondly, it was because of the Rainclear Continent’s environment.

The Five Great Heavenly Regions were extremely hostile towards ascenders, this also left ascenders no choice but to rise up in resistance.

But Zhuo Bufan won over a great heavenly region and let ascenders have a place to rest.

Hence, people started living a peaceful life after achieving some small accomplishments, feeling satisfied and content.

It was also precisely because of this mentality that propagated the attitudes of the likes of Duan Yongchun.

“Huhu,?what’s most laughable is that the five great heavenly sects are of the same breath and branch. In the end, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was boycotted by the Pill Alliance, there was actually not one sect that lent a helping hand! It seemed like the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect getting destroyed will give you all a great deal of benefits! Have you guys thought before, that the Pill Alliance wants to crumble the five great heavenly sects through precisely this kind of means? Today, it’s the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect. Tomorrow … will it be your Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect?”

These words made the faces of the four sects’ sect masters become unnatural.

They only made up their minds to fall out with the Pill Alliance because of Ye Yuan’s rise too.

If not for this, they really would not have been able to make up their minds.

Prior to this, they indeed had the thought of protecting personal interest and staying out of trouble.

But Ye Yuan and Cang Yongning’s alchemy battle directly swept them in and forced them to break away from the Pill Alliance.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was scorching as he continued: “That’s right! Breaking away from the Pill Alliance now will indeed have a pain period for a while! But if we don’t experience this period of pain, ascenders will never be able to lift our heads up! Yes, my current strength is indeed inferior to the chief of the Pill Alliance! But how can you dare say with certainty that I’ll be inferior to him in the future? If the Holy Son came into being, can you imagine that there would be an ascender heavenly alchemist to defeat him?”

“As for grade four heavenly alchemists, this isn’t a problem at all! You guys have seen Wu Chengchao’s strength too! I have the confidence to let him reach the realm of grade four within ten years! Moreover, we still have Qu Yan and Dong Rui, the two elders. Their realm is already there. It’s just that their foundation isn’t stable. As long as they join the Pill Pavilion, this Ye dares to guarantee to let them take out heavenly pills that won’t lose to the Pill Alliance within 30 years!”

These words made the five great sect masters shudder all over!

What they wanted was this!

It was just that in their view, while Ye Yuan was formidable, it was far too difficult to make others reach Ye Yuan’s realm. This was why they were somewhat lacking in confidence.

“Elder Ye, is this true?” Yang Jie could not resist asking.

“Yeah, Elder Ye, you can’t make this joke in front of all of the elders!” Feng Xuanyi also said rather worriedly.

Even Qu Yan was also somewhat nervous as he said, “Elder Ye, can this Qu really do it?”

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “Elder Qu, you don’t need to belittle your own capability! Actually, you guys merely had both eyes hoodwinked by the Pill Alliance! Under such shallow and ignorant circumstances, you guys could still reach the realm of grade four heavenly alchemist. Your alchemy path talent is likely even stronger than the Pill Alliance’s elders! It’s just that you guys didn’t know the right way to cultivate. That’s all! As long as you guys join the Pill Pavilion, this Ye dares to guarantee to let your strength be reborn anew within 30 years!”

Ye Yuan was naturally not saying these with all talk but no promises. In reality, he already had a score in his heart when he observed Qu Yan refining the pill just now.

Wu Chengchao’s talent was pretty good too.

But Qu Yan’s talent was significantly stronger than Wu Chengchao.

The things that Wu Chengchao could do, if Qu Yan wanted to do them, it would not take much time at all.

Just as grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, for example, Ye Yuan spent nearly 20 years’ time in order to cultivate it to the extreme back then.

But to Qu Yan, probably spending a few months’ time would be enough.

It was just that they did not know the right method.

The words made Qu Yan feel like a maiden with love in the air, his heart going pit-a-pat.

Virtually without thinking, Qu Yan said, “Okay, I’ll join the Pill Pavilion!”

At this time, Dong Rui also stood up and said, “This old man joins the Pill Pavilion too!”

With four grade four heavenly alchemists joining the Pill Pavilion at the same time, this weight became heavy!

To ascenders, these two were solitary seedlings. Their statuses were evident at a glance.

In the sect, the two of their statuses even did not lose to the sect master.

Yang Jie’s gaze swept across everyone’s faces and he said coolly, “Who else has objections?”

Duan Yongchun opened his mouth, still wanting to say something. But in the end, he did not speak.

“Alright! Then this matter is settled like this! From today onwards, the five great heavenly sects will join forces and completely purge the Pill Alliance’s forces out of Five Light Heavenly Region! In addition, we’ll also exhaust the power of the five sects to help strengthen the Pill Pavilion! Ye Yuan, whatever your Pill Pavilion needs, feel free to open your mouth! But, all jokes aside, if the big talk that you boasted today isn’t realized in the future, don’t blame this sect master for not being courteous!” Yang Jie said in a loud voice.
