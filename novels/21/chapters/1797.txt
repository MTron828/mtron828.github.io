Chapter 1801 Three Beasts Showing off Their Power

Outside Firecloud Peak, three figures stood in the air.

The person in front was wearing a blue long-robe. His aura was powerful. He was already a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse.

If Ye Yuan were here, he would be able to recognize that this person was precisely Qian Ye.

And the two people behind him, one was the Zhong Hanlin who had entered the sect not long, while the other was that disciple who arranged for Ye Yuan to enter the Firecloud Peak to open up an abode.

“Wang Quan, pretty well done this time. From today onward, you’re my Soaring Flower lineage’s outer-member. This medicinal pill is your reward.”

Qian Ye casually threw a medicinal pill over, his tone full of arrogance.

However, Wang Quan did not mind at all. In fact, he was wildly ecstatic instead.

“Many thanks, Senior Apprentice Brother Qian Ye! In the future, if Senior Apprentice Brother Qian Ye has any instruction that you want to give, Wang Quan offers his service. Feel free to speak up. Wang Quan will definitely brave any danger to perform my duty!”

Qian Ye nodded his head and said, “You’re certain that they entered Firecloud Peak?”

Wang Quan hurriedly said, “Senior Apprentice Brother, rest assured. That day, I constantly kept watch on him and saw that the two of them indeed entered Firecloud Peak.”

Qian Ye said coolly, “The spiritual energy on Firecloud Peak is sparse. Furthermore, there are quite a few rank five fierce beasts. That punk has high regard for himself, going along with the current, wanting to come here to train. But if he encountered rank five fierce beasts, that’s certain death. Come, let’s go take a look.”

Qian Ye was very confident in his own strength. Even if he ran into rank five fierce beasts, he also had confidence in retreating unscathed.

Right at this time, several more figures flew closer from afar.

There were three groups of people among the arrivals. They seemed to have made an appointment, arriving at this desolate Firecloud Peak at the same time.

Qian Ye’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold smile, “You guys really know how to pick up a bargain!”

Beside Duan Qinghong, a youth in white said, “Heh, Qian Ye, don’t say that. It’s your movement that was too fast.”

This person’s aura was not the slightest bit weaker than Qian Ye’s, also a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse.

These two people were of the Cloudsword lineage.

There were also two other groups of people. One batch was the Immortal Abode lineage’s Jiang Xueyan. The other batch was the Devil Elephant lineage; who could it be if not Song Ting?

“Heh, you can’t say that. Screwing a puny little Ye Yuan to death doesn’t take much effort. Didn’t you take his life by playing a small trick?” Jiang Xueyan said with a smile.

Qian Ye pursed his lips and said disdainfully, “When we were at the Shadowmoon Mountain Range, you insisted on doing something superfluous and stopping me. Now, you’re going to kill him.”

Jiang Xueyan smiled and said, “Times have changed. You were going to make a move against Baili at that time!”

Qian Ye gave a cold snort and said, “Enough crap! Since everybody is here, why not go to Firecloud Peak and take a look. I believe that with the few of our strengths, making a round-trip exploration shouldn’t be an issue.”

The moment these words came out, everyone all nodded.

Several mighty Celestial Deity Realm disciples taking action, even if there were rank five fierce beasts, they could also deal with it.

The party went down to the Firecloud Peak and started searching for Ye Yuan two people’s traces.

The traces that Ye Yuan left behind were very obvious. There were quite a few places on the mountain that had traces of fighting. They were not hard to find.

Qian Ye and the rest did not spend much time and found the corpses of fierce beasts strewn all over the ground.

When they saw the corpses of those three peak late-stage rank four fierce beasts, the expressions on their faces became solemn.

“This kid’s combat power is too strong! Just a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord and he can actually kill three peak late-stage rank four fierce beasts! Furthermore, it looks like the battle didn’t last long!” Qian Ye said with a solemn face.

But Jiang Xueyan said coolly, “What’s so strange about it? How do you think he got first place in the first round’s assessment? Therefore, he must die!”

Everyone all nodded when they heard it. The appearance of such a genius would break the balance of the three major factions.

This kind of situation was absolutely not allowed to happen.

Ye Yuan being assigned to Tianying Peak, the three major factions clearly contributed to it.

Otherwise, with the talent that Ye Yuan displayed, even if he did not have a powerful faction behind him, it was also absolutely impossible to be assigned to Tianying Peak.

The Cloudsword Sect’s Celestial Deity Realm disciple, Yi Qingxiang, said with a smile that was not a smile, “The spiritual energy ahead is getting richer and richer. Looks like the abode he chose lies not far ahead. But this kind of place is also very close to rank five fierce beasts’ territories already, right?”

Hearing Yi Qingxiang’s words, everyone also revealed knowing smiles.

Even if Ye Yuan had astonishing talent, encountering rank five fierce beasts were also certain death.

Everyone followed Ye Yuan’s footprints and gradually closed in on the place where the Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye was at.

“This Firecloud Peak is really a remote hinterland! The place with the thickest spiritual energy also can’t compare to a level three abode.”

Feeling the surrounding spiritual energy, Qian Ye said with a disdainful look.

The other people’s faces also revealed expressions that deeply felt that way too.

The abodes that they cultivated in, those were all very high-grade spiritual eyes. Toward the Firecloud Peak, this sort of place, they naturally looked down on it.

Tianying Peak was originally the spiritual vein with the most impoverished spiritual energy, and Firecloud Peak was even a stray peak with very sparse spiritual energy within the radius of Tianying Peak. The spiritual energy here could be imagined.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

All of a sudden, a series of beast roars echoed out.

Countless powerful auras instantly rang from all directions.

When the few people heard, their scalps immediately tingled.

The aura of each fierce beast was extremely powerful. Among them, there were several which were clearly rank five fierce beasts.

“Not good! Why would so many fierce beasts suddenly appear? Quickly go! I can’t stay in this place!” Jiang Xueyan’s expression changed greatly as she said.

However, her voice had yet to fade when three fierce beasts directly scurried out of the dense woods, surrounding the few people in the center.

“Desolate Cloud Ancient Bear! Gold Rainbow Skyfiend Deer! Dragon Thunder Mystic Hog!”

When Qian Ye saw these three rank five fierce beasts, he was frightened out of his wits.

Although these three fierce beasts were only initial-stage rank five, their strengths were definitely much stronger than them, these First Firmament celestial deities.

If it was only one, the few of them could still barely manage to deal with it.

Three appearing all at once, this was simply fatal!

These three fierce beasts were naturally those three that Ye Yuan subdued.

They were finally still unable to resist the temptation of the Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye and chose to submit.

After all, Firecloud Peak’s spiritual energy was still relatively speaking a little too impoverished.

“Reckless and blind things, to actually dare interrupt Grandpa Bear’s cultivation, deserve to die!”

The Dragon Thunder Mystic Hog said, “Damn black bear, talk what nonsense with them? Just directly kill them”

The Gold Rainbow Skyfiend Deer also said, “Kill! Grandpa Deer, I, still have to cultivate!”

The three people did not take nonsense either, directly charging over towards Qian Ye and the rest.

In an instant, the few people were forced until they were in a fluster by three incomparably powerful fierce beasts.

“These few fellows already unlocked spiritual wisdom; we’re not their match! Quickly run!” Jiang Xueyan yelled.

How could the few people dare to linger, frantically wanting to break out of the encirclement?

However, how could these three fierce beasts be easy to get along with? Wanting to run was not that easy too.

For some time, Qian Ye and the rest fell into a bitter fight.

That Wang Quan was only a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord. Being hit by a slap from the Desolate Cloud Ancient Bear, he directly died until not even dregs remained.

It was a pity that he joined the Soaring Flower lineage for less than a day and ended up perishing, with his Dao disappearing.

The group of people retreated as they fought, wanting to fly out of the boundary of Firecloud Peak. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At that time, no matter how strong these three fierce beasts were, they also did not dare to chase after anymore.
