Chapter 1448 Say Goodbye

Refining the Dao Fruit, Bai Chen directly soared a major realm!

Although Bai Chen’s realm was still not enough to look at in front of the Sky Foothill Palace Lord.

But in the Sky Foothill World, he was invincible!

“Mn?”

Bai Chen snorted coldly, akin to a thunderclap, blasting until the Sky Foothill Palace Lord moved several steps back in a row.

A trace of blood flowed out of the corner of the Sky Foothill Palace Lord’s mouth. He actually already suffered internal injuries.

“S-So strong!”

“What Palace Lord is displaying right now is merely him at the Heaven Glimpse Realm, but he could injure a grand completion Origin Deity powerhouse with a sound! Is ... this the strength of a sovereign?”

Everyone was dumbfounded with shock by Bai Chen’s means!

The expressions of those few Origin Deity powerhouses behind the Sky Foothill Palace Lord all changed drastically when they saw this scene.

“This ... This old man, Mu Jian, pays respect to Lord Sovereign!”

Although he had intense unwillingness, Mu Jian knew that the disparity between him and Bai Chen was too great!

Not submitting, he had to die!

With him kneeling, the other seven Origin Deity powerhouses also followed and knelt down.

“Sky Foothill seven elders pay respects to Lord Sovereign.”

Bai Xiu had an excited look and also brought the White Night Sacred Palace’s people to follow and bowed down, saying excitedly, “We pay respect to Lord Sovereign!”

Bai Chen said coolly, “This day forth, the Sky Foothill Divine Palace is dissolved on the spot. The White Night Sacred Palace will replace the Sky Foothill Divine Palace and rule Sky Foothill!”

Mu Jian’s gaze turned intent and he involuntarily cried out, “Lord Sovereign, this ... this ...”

Bai Chen’s gaze turned intent and he said in a cold voice, “Why? Do you have objections?”

Sensing Bai Chen’s killing intent, Mu Jian was alarmed inwardly and hurriedly said, “D-Dare not! Mu Jian dares not!”

Bai Chen’s voice and expression relaxed slightly and he said coolly, “This Bai won’t meddle with secular affairs as the sovereign! As long as you all don’t become disloyal, you’ll naturally be put in an important position anew.”

Mu Jian’s eyes lit up, and he hurriedly said, “Mu Jian doesn’t dare! From today onward, Mu Jian will definitely do everything in my power to assist the White Night Sacred Palace to manage the affairs under the heavens!”

Bai Chen lightly grunted, slowly turned around, and looked in Ye Yuan’s direction.

Ye Yuan was currently sizing Bai Chen up with interest. After taking control of Heavenly Dao, his demeanor indeed became different.

His horizons were already not on the same level as these people.

Bai Chen flicked in long sleeves and knelt down toward Ye Yuan.

“Disciple Bai Chen thanks Master for your grace of rebirth! From this day forth, Master Ye Yuan is Sky Foothill’s father. As long as Master has instructions, the entire Sky Foothill will definitely go through fire and water!” Bai Chen said with a solemn look.

Bai Chen’s words made everyone’s countenance change.

Bai Chen’s current identity was already completely different.

He was the master of a world. Wanting to kill Ye Yuan was but a matter that could be done with ease.

But Bai Chen actually paid such solemn respects to Ye Yuan and even revered Ye Yuan as his superior, putting the latter at the position of the sovereign’s father.

As long as Ye Yuan was willing, he could summon wind and call for rain in the entire Sky Foothill World!

Except, they all looked down on Ye Yuan too much.

And also underestimated Ye Yuan’s strength too much!

If it were anybody else, they would be at Bai Chen’s mercy in the Sky Foothill World.

But Ye Yuan would not!

The Sky Foothill World’s Heavenly Dao was but an extremely small portion of the Heavenspan World’s Heavenly Dao.

Ye Yuan controlled the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. He could completely not be fettered by the Sky Foothill Heavenly Dao.

If Bai Chen really had any wicked designs, Ye Yuan could completely rely on the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s power to contend with Heavenly Dao.

It was also to say that Ye Yuan was entirely on the same starting line as Bai Chen. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In front of Ye Yuan, Bai Chen was just a Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artist!

With Ye Yuan’s strength, if he really wanted to kill Bai Chen, it was akin to taking something out of his own pocket.

However, Bai Chen indeed did not disappoint him.

His attitude showed that Ye Yuan did not misjudge people.

Ye Yuan smiled as he helped Bai Chen up and said, “It’s good that you have this thought. But ... Master is leaving!”

Bai Chen’s expression changed and he said, “Master, you have to face all kinds of killing in the outside world. How can it be as leisurely and carefree as the Sky Foothill World? How about you stay behind and rule the Sky Foothill World together with me?”

Ye Yuan shook his head with a smile and said, “Master only reached the Heavenspan World after experiencing hardships. How can I give up easily? Master has things that must be done!”

Bai Chen thought about it and said, “Then ... I’ll go to the Heavenspan World together with Master! With Bai Chen’s current strength, I should be able to help master.”

Ye Yuan patted his shoulder and said with a smile, “Bai Chen, don’t underestimate the heroes under the heavens! You have to bear in mind in the future, there is always someone better and a heaven beyond the heavens! The sovereign of a world is nothing in the Heavenspan World! You can control the life and death of everyone here, but going to the Heavenspan World, you are but an ordinary Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artist. Your urgent matter on hand is to completely digest the power of the Dao Fruit and became a true Celestial Deity powerhouse. At that time, you’ll go to the Heavenspan World to find me.”

Bai Chen refined the Dao Fruit. But wanting to break through to Celestial Deity Realm still required the accumulation of time.

After all, people at the Celestial Deity Realm were too powerful. Wanting to reach it could not be done in a short time.

According to Ye Yuan’s estimations, for Bai Chen to want to cultivate to the Celestial Deity Realm, it at least needed 200 years’ time.

Even if he went to the Heavenspan World now, he could not be of help to Ye Yuan at all.

Hearing these words, Bai Chen involuntarily revealed a disappointed look.

“But ... Alright, I’ll listen to Master and absolutely won’t look down on the heroes under the heavens! When I achieve Celestial Deity Realm, I’ll definitely go to the Heavenspan World and brave it!” Bai Chen said with a firm gaze.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Okay, Master is waiting for you in the Heavenspan World!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s expression became stern and he said somberly, “Oh, right, before you break through to the Divine Lord Realm, you absolutely mustn’t show anything unusual! If there are people from the outside world coming in for trials, you have to pretend not to see. Whatever that should be done should still be done. Make sure not to let the cat out of the bag, got it?”

Seeing Ye Yuan instruct so solemnly, Bai Chen knew the severity and said with a nod, “I understand! Rest assured, in these few decades, I’ll definitely tuck my tail between my legs and behave.”

Each small world was a treasure vault with limitless resources, and also an excellent place for training disciples under them.

But if this small world broke free from control, Wu Meng City Lord would likely not let the matter go.

Once he personally enters the Sky Foothill World, then Bai Chen would be in danger.

“Alright, it’s getting late. Master should leave!” Finished talking, Ye Yuan was planning on leaving.

“Wait a minute, Master!”

Bai Chen suddenly stopped Ye Yuan, turned to Mu Jian, and said, “Does the Sky Foothill Divine Palace have Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones?”

Mu Jian did not dare to conceal and hurriedly said, “Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are too hard to come by. The consumption these few years were also not small. Presently ... there are only three pieces left!”

Bai Chen’s brows furrowed. Mu Jian’s expression changed, his heart thumping away.

Clearly, Bai Chen was unhappy.

“Forget it, bring it all!” Bai Chen said coolly.

This kind of precious thing, Mu Jian naturally kept it on him.

Only to see him take out three pieces of milky-white stones. It was precisely the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone.

Bai Chen handed them to Ye Yuan and said helplessly, “Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are too rare. This disciple can only do so much. When I thoroughly take control of Heavenly Dao, I’ll definitely bring Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones to go and find Master!”

Ye Yuan was not courteous either, directly putting it away.

Other things, he could not care. But Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones, he needed it too much.

“Alright, Master will accept it. Farewell!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure moved, vanishing from where he originally was.
