Chapter 2357: The Powerful Wan Zhen!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Suddenly, a cold light appeared around Ye Yuan.

Puchi!

Ye Yuan did not look at that guy at all and his body was already pierced into a sieve, kicking the bucket.

Opposite, Wan Zhen’s pupils constricted.

Ye Yuan killed a top ten powerhouse so effortlessly!

Really very strong!

In Cloudaid City, people opened their mouths wide, looking at this scene with shocked faces.

“So strong! That’s a powerhouse ranked in the top 10. He killed the other person without even giving him a look!”

“Is that time law? Indeed well-deserving of being a supreme law. It’s really too strong!”

“Just how strong is Ye Yuan’s current strength? From his appearance, it seems like he’s going to fight with Wan Zhen!”

... ...

Everyone had looks of anticipation. They really wanted to take a look at just who was stronger and who was weaker between the former number one and the current number one.

While time law was powerful, Wan Zhen had experienced these few years of training. Just how strong he was, they were unable to judge as well.

Everything would only be known after fighting!

After all, Wan Zhen was three minor realms higher than Ye Yuan!

“Time law is indeed impressive!”

Wan Zhen laughed loudly, causing the pressure of an Eighth Firmament Heavenly Emperor to suddenly bloom!

During these ten years’ time, Ye Yuan fought crazily. Currently, his realm improved further and was already comparable to Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

Among the unpredictable children, especially among these top 1000, even half a minor realm lower was fatal too.

But Ye Yuan was going to challenge the Eighth Firmament Heavenly Emperor Wan Zhen with a Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor cultivation realm.

But, no one felt that there was anything wrong.

Ye Yuan’s trump cards were too many! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

All of a sudden, five kinds of power of laws suddenly descended, forming a perfect closed loop around Wan Zhen.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Fusing the Five Element Laws! Brother Wan indeed kept to your own counsel!”

Wan Zhen laughed loudly and said, “It’s not that I kept to my own counsel. It’s just that I didn’t have a chance to display it!”

Five Element Laws, just comprehending one was nothing.

This was the most basic power of law, what the vast majority of martial artists comprehended was one or two of the Five Element Laws.

Those with stronger talents would comprehend three kinds.

In fact, the Lu Ziyi whom Ye Yuan had once seen before, she was extremely talented, comprehending all of the Five Element Laws.

But comprehending was easy, while fusion was hard!

Wanting to fuse the Five Element Laws into one, this was something harder than ascending to heaven.

The difficulty was no less than Ye Yuan’s comprehension of the two great supreme laws!

Five elements fusing into one, the power would not be the slightest bit inferior to the supreme laws!

Five elements, mutually promoting and restraining each other.

If it could be fused into one, it would be able to continue in an endless cycle. One thought, one world; it was exceedingly powerful.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan could feel that Wan Zhen’s five power of laws was extremely balanced.

These five kinds of power of laws, there was you in me, me in you; nothing the least bit superfluous.

This kind of five elements fusion could be rated as perfect!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said, “Brother Wan’s Five Element Laws is probably more than this, right?”

Wan Zhen smiled and said, “That’s right! My water law, fire law, and wood law, already reached the level of source! It’s just that once the five elements balance is broken, the power will be inferior to now instead. Hence, these three laws are almost useless to me.”

Even Ye Yuan also sucked in a breath of cold air.

He originally thought that Wan Zhen comprehended one or two source powers. Did not expect that he actually already comprehended three kinds!

One day, if he comprehended five great source powers at the same time, and achieved the balance of the Five Element Laws once more, that would be too terrifying!

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said, “It was this Ye who underestimated the heroes of the world! Brother Wan’s talent is unprecedented since time immemorial! What’s even rarer is that Brother Wan’s considerations are huge and can take a broad view of the world; truly hard to come by!”

Wan Zhen smiled and said, “Younger Brother Ye, stop overselling me! In terms of talent, who can compare to you? Oh, Time law! This Wan tried for a long time, but I still gave up in the end! Now, with Younger Brother Ye synchronizing time and space, your combat power is unparalleled under the heavens. Enough talk, let’s fight!”

Ye Yuan was also filled with lofty sentiments and laughed loudly as he said, “Hahaha, come and fight!”

At this time, it already became a mess in the cage. It was incomparably chaotic everywhere.

But these two only had the other in their eyes.

A treasure pagoda suddenly appeared in Wan Zhen’s hand.

Only to see his expression turn solemn, the aura of the treasure pagoda billowing to the sky, and suddenly slamming over towards Ye Yuan.

The speed was unbelievably fast.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, the sword formation suddenly rising, meeting the treasure pagoda.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

The two people’s battle gave off a loud noise.

One massive energy undulation after another rippled out between the two of them. No one dared to approach them at all.

Inside the cage, those unpredictable children were all shuddering with fear, choosing to stay away from these two people very consciously.

An unpredictable child could not resist cursing, “Damn, these two fellows are really strong! Similarly top ten, the disparity isn’t just a little bit!”

“That one who’s using the sword formation, still thought that he was easy to bully just now, didn’t expect that he’s so strong. Luckily I didn’t make a move!”

“Time law coupled with two great source powers, this kid is simply a freak! Also, there’s the other guy. He actually achieved the perfect balance of the five elements! These two aren’t human at all!”

... ...

Regardless of which city it was, the gap between the top ten was very large too.

Under normal circumstances, the top three or top two was an echelon. It was even be divided into two or three echelons at the back.

As for how strong each city’s number one was, it would only be known after competing.

But Wan Zhen and Ye Yuan’s fight made them realize the disparity.

Amidst the chaotic battlefield, a black figure stood in the air, with the power of lightning on his body surging crazily.

No one dared to approach this person at all! The power of lightning on his body was too strong!

Even a fool could also guess that this person was the successor of Dao Ancestor Lightning, Pang Zhen!

His gaze was already drawn by Wan Zhen and Ye Yuan’s gazes.

“Heh, I really didn’t expect that besides us, another guy who can rival Wan Zhen actually popped out. This kid is very strong! Looks like the supreme position this time is very troublesome!”

A youth dressed in ink-black long robes fanned his fan, arriving beside Pang Zhen.

Others were afraid of Pang Zhen, but he did not seem to care at all.

This youth fanning his fan was Noble Carefree, Yu Tanzhi, who was as famous as Pang Zhen and Wan Zhen.

Pang Zhen snorted coldly and said, “The supreme position is mine. Nobody can snatch it away! Wan Zhen can’t, you, likewise can’t!”

Yu Tanzhi laughed and said, “Pang Zhen, you’re always like this! Who can get the final position of supremacy, not reaching the end, who will know?”

Pang Zhen’s gaze turned cold, the aura on his body surging as he said in a solemn voice, “Looks like you want to have a go at me?”

Yu Tanzhi put away his fan and said smilingly, “Fighting, naturally got to fight. But before this, shouldn’t we clean up these trash first? Also, those two, isn’t it good to let them fight first?”

Pang Zhen withdrew his aura and said coolly, “Mn, what you said makes sense!”

Swoosh!

Finished talking, his figure suddenly disappeared, his speed being inconceivably swift.
