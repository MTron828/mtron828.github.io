Chapter 3005: Such a Big Disturbance?

“Fine lad, you’re really gutsy! You’re going to trample heaven underfoot!” When Mi Tian heard those words, he could not help drawing a cold breath.

Heavenly Dao was boundless. The more he reached such a realm, the more he could feel the fathomlessness of Heavenly Dao.

Putting aside other things, just this Eternal River was an existence that they could not cross.

What they pursued was merely just passing through the Door of Eternal Life and transcending to the Great Beyond. That was all.

But even if they really transcended, they also did not dare say to trample Heavenly Dao underfoot! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

But Ye Yuan dared!

“Heaven wants to eradicate me. So why can’t I trample the heaven? Being alive in this world, it’s to ask to be quick to settle grudges and favor. Heavenly Dao has a spirit, and I’ll trample him underfoot. Heavenly Dao is boundless; then I’ll control him in my hands!” Ye Yuan was filled with lofty sentiments as he said.

Mi Tian could not help smiling bitterly as he said, “I hope that when you reach my realm, you still dare to say such things.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior doesn’t know my road to rise. So you don’t know what I think in my heart. No matter what kind of realm I reach, this is the Dao in my heart, and it won’t change!”

The people discussed the cultivation method, but a great storm had already arisen in the outside world.

The Eternal River whirlpool grew bigger and bigger and already affected Hegemon Realms.

The cultivations of many Hegemon Realms were interrupted by these tumultuous Eternal River waters.

A dragon race Hegemon flew into a thunderous rage as he said, “Motherf*cker! Which tortoise’s grandson actually dares to cause trouble in the Eternal River? This seat will exterminate you!”

Another Hegemon cried out in surprise,?“Mn??It’s that boy Ye Yuan! Hasn’t he become a cripple? How did such a big disturbance come about??Eh,?he … he’s absorbing the power of chaos to cultivate!”

“He scattered his cultivation in order to absorb the power of chaos here? Freaking hell, is this boy crazy?”

“The power of chaos here can’t be absorbed at all. He’s courting death!”

“Your Father just had a bit of comprehension, and it was all ruined by this punk! Your Father is telling you, if not for that this kid rendered a great contribution, Your Father would directly pinch him to death!”

… …

Beyond the shock, the Hegemon powerhouses were extremely furious.

You messed around yourself and even did not let Your Father cultivate. This was called occupying the latrine and not taking a dump!

However, Ye Yuan was not stuffed until he exploded. His realm was still getting higher and higher.

Lower Lesser Sublime Heaven to middle Lesser Sublime Heaven, then to upper Lesser Sublime Heaven, Ye Yuan’s aura grew stronger and stronger!

Along with it, the chaos vortex grew larger and larger.

Looking from the sky, it was like a nebula, being extremely beautiful.

Of course, the turmoil of the Eternal River branch stream also grew increasingly fiercer.

The dragon race Hegemons were no longer able to cultivate.

On the other hand, along with the passage of time, the power of chaos also gradually flowed into Mi Tian’s dragon heart.

This chaos true dragon started resurrecting!

He was born in the Eternal River. This place was like his mother river.

Everything seemed to like returning to his mother’s womb.

The dragon heart started to draw nutrients.

Half a year later, Ye Yuan reached grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum and broke through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum in one stroke.

Boom!

The water of the Eternal River became even more violent and already affected the other few branch streams of Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven.

At the White Tiger Clan, more than ten Hegemon Realm powerhouses were currently comprehending Dao in their Eternal River branch stream.

Suddenly, a roar rose to the sky.

“I?#^%^#!?Just a bit more and Your Father is about to gain enlightenment on Dao. How is this person so fucking wicked? It’s the dragon race! Long Jian, the few of you tortoise grandsons, do you really think that your Grandpa Tiger is scared of you guys?”

Swoosh!

This Supreme Hegemon headed toward the dragon race with a cry.

Vermilion Bird Clan, Fire Phoenix, Yuan Chu, Qing Luan, and the rest of the branch clan Hegemons were all furious.

“Humph!?What’s the dragon race doing? The entire Eternal River is turned completely upside down! Sisters, let’s go together and get an explanation!”

Under the suggestion of the Qing Luan Clan’s Supreme Hegemon, more than ten Hegemon Realm powerhouses headed toward the dragon race.

The Black Tortoise Clan’s old tortoises were a little simple-minded, but at this time, they flew into a thunderous rage too. Many Hegemons headed for the dragon race.

Apart from them, some of the other true spirit Hegemons also came to the dragon race one after another.

The entire Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven was completely in chaos.

“Lord Long Jian, things are bad! The White Tiger Clan’s Hegemon Bai Zhi has brought more than ten tiger race Hegemons to come and denounce publicly for crimes!” Long Min entered the Eternal River’s void in a panic and reported.

Long Jian said coolly, “Panicking for what? Let them wait. A mere White Tiger Clan, can they still overturn the heavens?”

The dragon race’s might was not said for fun!

They had the most Hegemons and were the strongest!

More than ten Hegemons denouncing publicly for crimes, if it were anywhere else, it would absolutely be a heaven-shocking major event.

But in the dragon race, it was no big deal.

Long Jian was most interested in Ye Yuan now. He really wanted to see just how far Ye Yuan could go.

This guy would not really cultivate his cultivation realm back, right?

If he could really do it, that would be really incredible!

Everyone knew that the Eternal River’s power of chaos was good stuff, but they were unable to make use of it!

Long Jian also really wanted to know how strong Ye Yuan was.

Hence, the dragon race really left the White Tiger Clan there to be ignored.

A few more days passed. Long Min ran in panic again, and he said while sweating profusely, “Lord Long Jian, things are really bad this time! The White Tiger Clan hasn’t left yet; the Vermilion Bird Clan’s Luan Qinghe and the Black Tortoise Clan’s Xuan Taiqing have led more than 20 Hegemon Realms, and they all came!”

Long Jian gave Long Min a glance in surprise and said, “Such a big disturbance?”

Long Min smiled bitterly and said, “Too big! This boy cultivating in the Eternal River branch stream has already swept throughout the entire Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven! Currently, the entire Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven is in havoc, not just the Hegemon Realms. With Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven falling into disarray, it’s virtually going to be utter havoc!”

Long Jian swallowed his saliva and could not resist glancing at Ye Yuan, and said crossly, “This brat can really cause trouble! He just broke through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum. If he were to cultivate to Emperor Cloud Heaven, wouldn’t all the heavens and myriad worlds be in complete havoc?”

The Eternal River was the source of all worlds. When the Eternal River was in upheaval, all the worlds would naturally have all kinds of phenomena happen.

Yet, Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven had a lot of Hegemon Realms. Three great clans were joining hands and coming forth. Long Jian felt tremendous pressure too!

“Go, this seat will go out and take a look! With Progenitor Mi Zhen holding down the fort, I reckon that they wouldn’t dare be unbridled too!?Humph!”?Long Jian was still proud.

The dragon race’s greatest reliance was that they were a Great Beyond Realm powerhouse.

With Progenitor around, what was there to be scared of?

As soon as Long Jian showed himself, Hegemon Bai Zhi blew his top.

He had waited here for seven to eight days already and did not even see Long Jian’s face. How could he not be furious?

But the dragon race had great power and influence. He really could not do anything about it.

However, Luan Qinghe and Xuan Taiqing were here too. He became filled with confidence at once.

“Long Jian, what’s the meaning of this! What the hell is your dragon race doing? It’s throwing the entire Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven into a tizzy! If you don’t give an explanation today, this seat will demolish your dragon clan!” Bai Zhi said.

Long Jian said coolly, “Bai Zhi, don’t talk rubbish with this seat! If you have the ability, try to do it for me to see!”

“You!” Bai Zhi could not help choking.

Let him demolish; he really did not dare.

“Brother Long Jian, you’re in the wrong here! Although your dragon clan is the leader of Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, now, it’s making people be in chaos. Our Vermilion Bird Clan won’t sit by idly and remain indifferent too!” Luan Qinghe said coolly.

“Our Xuanwu Clan wants an explanation too!” Xuan Taiqing said coolly.
