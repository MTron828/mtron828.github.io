Chapter 3025: Reversing The Battle Situation!

Ten great Hegemons descending, the battle situation instantly had a reversal!

This force was seriously too powerful!

Under Long Jian, Luan Qinghe, and Hegemon Imperishable’s pincer attack, Wang Zuo and Hegemon Bloodsky were instantly suppressed.

When Wang Zuo’s peripherals glimpsed Ye Yuan, who was hugging Cloudmount, his pupils could not help constricting.

Ye Yuan!

Why would this guy appear here?

Could it be that these top supreme powerhouses were actually brought by him?

This thought was so shocking!

“It’s this kid! Back then, it was this kid who destroyed this seat’s spatial passageway!” There was also Hegemon Bloodsky, who was similarly shocked. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He recognized Ye Yuan!

Back then, he thought that it was a spatial origin Hegemon opposite the passageway.

But only later on did he learn that that was merely a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, that was all!

A Hegemon actually lost to a Saint Sovereign. Bloodsky nearly fainted in anger.

Whoosh!

A sword tore across the air, breathtaking to the extreme, hitting Wang Zuo with incomparable precision.

Boom!

Wang Zuo was directly blown into smithereens by Zhuo Bufan’s sword.

The eyes of the three great Supreme Hegemons lit up, and they could not help but take another look at Zhuo Bufan.

Clearly, none of them expected that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven actually had such an astonishing sword cultivator!

“Many thanks to everyone for helping out. I can still fight! Leave one person to help me. You guys go and help the rest!” Zhuo Bufan held his sword while standing. Although heavily wounded, it did not affect his stubbornness in the slightest.

Although ten great Hegemons descended, there were too many blood race Hegemons. It was several times that of the Heaven One Alliance.

Otherwise, this fight would not have been so difficult either.

Zhuo Bufan’s meaning was very clear: kill the other Hegemons first!

Long Jian instantly determined the battlefield’s situation and said with a nod, “Luan Qinghe, Imperishable, the two of you go, leave this place to us!”

The two people naturally did not have objections, nodding slightly and leaving immediately.

With two great Supreme Hegemons joining the fight, the surrounding battle situation instantly underwent a reversal.

Originally, Heaven One’s Hegemons became fewer as they fought. There were not many left.

Around 60 to 70 Hegemons were besieging Heaven One’s remaining ten plus Hegemons.

One could say that the outcome was a foregone conclusion.

But, with Supreme Hegemons and a group of Peak Hegemons joining, the combat power could be imagined!

Dozens of Hegemons were pushed back repeatedly!

“Zhao Yue, kill for me! Kill until he can’t revive!” Ye Yuan’s two eyes were blood-red. His roar could be heard distinctly across the entire battlefield. His current fury could be seen.

Cloudneon guarded by his flank, staying vigilant against other people’s sneak attack.

Zhao Yue ignored the others too, just focusing on Hegemon Qing Yao and attacking frenziedly.

Hegemon Qing Yao was a Peak Hegemon too, his strength being very formidable.

But, under Zhao Yue’s berserk attacks, he did not have the strength to fight back at all.

Zhao Yue’s combat strength already approached Supreme Hegemon!

Ordinary Peak Hegemons were not his match at all.

Moreover, he was currently in a state of frenzy.

Qing Yao was going crazy.?F*ck, Cloudmount was not finished off by me alone. What are you fixated on me for?

Cloudmount and Blacksun were very strong. He only succeeded after seven great Hegemons joined forces to attack too.

Furthermore, it was even under the situation where Cloudmount’s life force was virtually exhausted!

But this scene was coincidentally seen by Ye Yuan.

Then Qing Yao fell into a tragedy!

He saw through that apart from this Zhao Yue, the strength of the other Peak Hegemons were also just like that.

Wanting to kill someone in the same rank within a short time was totally impossible.

But Zhao Yue’s strength was too strong!

“Master, this disciple came late!” Ye Yuan’s eyes were slightly red.

He had encountered many sad things in this lifetime, but he had virtually never shed tears before.

But Cloudmount really poured all of his love and care into Ye Yuan.

He even did not stint to fall out with the Heaven One Alliance for him!

Therefore, when he saw this scene of Qing Yao sneak attacking Cloudmount, his entire person went completely mad.

“Not late, not late! Just in time!?Haha,?this seat hasn’t died yet, what are you crying for?” Cloudmount said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan did not speak.

Cloudmount would not die, but his life force expenditure was too severe. Furthermore, he was very heavily wounded. In the future, he would be equivalent to a cripple.

This injury was very hard for Ye Yuan to repair even if Ye Yuan reached the level of blooming a myriad flowers with one thought.

Cloudmount’s and Blacksun’s injuries were an exchange with Heavenly Dao, using their lives to exchange for power.

Unless Ye Yuan could defy heaven to change fate, otherwise, Cloudmount would be pretty much the same as a living corpse.

To a Peak Hegemon who possessed a supreme status and strength, this was worse than killing him.

But Cloudmount did not care at all.

He was really very happy when he saw Ye Yuan and said with a smile,?“Haha,?I really didn’t expect that in merely a rushed 100 years, you could actually have such accomplishments! Well-deserving of being my, Cloudmount’s, disciple! Old Fogey Blacksun, are you very jealous right now??Hahaha?

… My youngest disciple’s face-slapping means, really have my, this master’s, style!”

Cloudmount laughed extremely happily.

On the other side, Hegemon Blacksun was much more miserable.

Nobody cared about him at all!

He fell heavily onto the ground and could not move at all.

Furthermore, the most important thing was that he got slapped again!

Just earlier, he was still saying in all solemnity that Ye Yuan was controlled by the Chaos Bloodstone.

But in a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan brought a large group of experts, descending from the sky like celestial soldiers, overcoming the raging tides!

Uh,?karma was really instant!

Being controlled naturally became utter nonsense.

With Heaven One’s present situation, as long as Ye Yuan looked on indifferently, there was no need to put on such a big show at all.

Let alone that even without the blood race, if Ye Yuan brought this force, it was sufficient to sweep across Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven too!

“Quickly retreat! Return to the Blood God Temple!” Wang Zuo yelled out, directly running wildly.

Even if it was just Long Jian and Zhuo Bufan two people, he and Bloodsky were not a match either.

He knew that this battle was completely lost!

This force that Ye Yuan brought was simply destructive.

To carry on fighting, everyone would die here.

Under Wang Zuo’s word of command, dozens of Hegemons turned around and ran.

Although the people that Ye Yuan brought were strong, they were unable to stop so many people from running away too.

However, Luan Qinghe and Imperishable two people killed wildly all the way, annihilating more than ten blood race Hegemons.

It was also that the blood race’s revival ability was too strong. It was already very hard to be able to have this battle result.

Of course, the most tragic was Qing Yao.

He had Zhao Yue glued onto him, unable to shake off at all.

Zhao Yue’s speed and combat strengths were all above him.

“F*ck you, Your Father will fight it out with you!”

Bang!

Then he was blown apart by Zhao Yue.

Being killed over 20 times in a row, Qing Yao was finally unable to revive and died thoroughly.

“Master, I’ll kill Wang Zuo that old dog to avenge you!” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

“Master believes you! Over so many years, Master is tired too. This time, just nice that I can have a break!” Cloudmount said with a smile.

Ye Yuan’s expression dimmed. He knew that Cloudmount was consoling him.

However, he was powerless to do anything about it right now.

Before long, the group of Hegemon Realms returned.

Long Jian said, “Those two Supreme Hegemons were seriously wounded by us and executed spatial methods to escape. After killing more than ten Hegemon Realms, the rest have all run away. Now, what should we do?”

All of the Heaven One Hegemons were incomparably shocked, inclusive of Cloudmount.

This dragon race Supreme Hegemon actually listened to Ye Yuan’s orders!

Correct, it was not discussing but awaiting Ye Yuan’s orders!
