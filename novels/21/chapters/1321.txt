Chapter 1325: Kid, New Here, Right?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“How does it feel?”

“Too weak! This evil spirit is merely initial-stage One-star, even not enough to fill the gaps between my teeth at all.”

“This ... Senior, your appetite is also a bit too big, right?”

“Bullsh*t! The Soul Suppressing Pearl is an empyrean spirit treasure. Even if you catch a few Four-star, Five-star evil spirits, it’s also not enough for this old man to digest!”

“Fine, what on earth should I do then?”

“Late-stage One-star evil spirits and have got to be three to five hundred no matter what!”

“Senior, this is daylight robbery. How long can three to five hundred last?”

“Barely enough for ten years! If I can devour a Two-star evil spirit, I can last a hundred years.”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said huffily, “Do you think that I can get you a Two-star evil spirit right now? If I really run into one, whether it is you devouring him or him swallowing me up is hard to say!”

“Haha, I’m just saying! But, if I can really devour a Two-star evil spirit, I’ll be able to help you cultivate the divine soul, and advance the divine soul realm,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, having his heart palpitate with eagerness by Dustless’s sentence.

After breaking through to the Deity Realm, Ye Yuan’s divine soul cultivating means were somewhat failing to make ends meet.

The Medicine God’s Soul Canon was just an incomplete article. It could help Ye Yuan cultivate to grand completion Tier 9 but somewhat lacked the strength to carry on.

Want to walk even further along the alchemy path, one must have a systematic divine soul cultivation method.

In this aspect, the Soul Suppressing Pearl was clearly an expert!

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan could not help thinking of his main cultivation method.

After reincarnating, what Ye Yuan had always been cultivating was the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art.

In the Immortal Grove Region, the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art was a pinnacle-most cultivation method and could be cultivated all the way to Origin Deity Realm.

But to the current Ye Yuan, this cultivation method was clearly unable to satisfy his ambitions already.

“Looks like everything has to start from scratch!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Dustless said, “Immortal Grove’s cultivation method is imprinted inside the World Suppressing Stele. His cultivation method was comprehended from the World Suppressing Stele and is one of the best cultivation methods in the Heavenspan World! If he didn’t fall, he might have been able to become a Transcendent Heavenly Emperor!”

“Transcendent Heavenly Emperor?” Ye Yuan asked wonderingly.

“En, Transcendent Heavenly Emperor. Actually, it’s peak Heavenly Emperor, the most powerful existence beneath Dao Ancestor! Immortal Grove’s cultivation method is sufficient for you to cultivate to becoming a Transcendent Heavenly Emperor!” Dustless explained.

Only npw was Ye Yuan enlightened. According to Dustless’s way of saying things, the cultivation method that Immortal Grove comprehended could be said to be a top-rate cultivation method of the Heavenspan World already.

After all, in the Heavenspan World, it was totally impossible to cultivate to the Dao Ancestor Realm.

Achieving Transcendent Heavenly Emperor was already the greatest possibility.

However, Ye Yuan fell silent.

He mused for a moment and said, “Senior, you said ... Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s cultivation method was comprehended from the World Suppressing Stele?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Dustless said with a cold smile, “Heh, your heart is also a bit too big! Reaching the Heavenspan World now, you should know the difficulties of cultivating above Deity Realm. To actually not have given up on the boundary of Dao Ancestor yet?”

Ye Yuan asking like this, Dustless naturally knew what Ye Yuan was trying to do straight away.

But these words were filled with mockery towards Ye Yuan, ridiculing that Ye Yuan overestimated his own ability.

But Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Senior, I know that reaching the Dao Ancestor Realm is as hard as ascending to heaven, but the Transcendent Heavenly Emperor Realm is utterly meaningless to me! If I want to save Lingxue, I must cultivate to the Dao Ancestor Realm. Isn’t that so?”

But Dustless said with a cold snort, “Compared to cultivating to Dao Ancestor Realm, this old man still feels that asking a Dao Ancestor for help is a little more reliable! If you’re really able to cultivate to Transcendent Heavenly Emperor Realm, you’ll have the qualifications to ask a Dao Ancestor for help.”

But Ye Yuan said stubbornly, “This doesn’t clash with cultivating to Dao Ancestor Realm!”

Dustless choked up and could not help being speechless.

Only after a long time did Dustless say, “Fine then, this World Suppressing Stele was actually obtained by chance by Immortal Grove back then at the Heavenspan Mountain; incredibly marvelous! It’s akin to a limitless treasure trove. When Immortal Grove just obtained it, it was just an ordinary piece of rock. Later, Immortal Grove continuously developed it, while its grade also continued to increase. When Immortal Grove cultivated to Empyrean Realm, it was already an empyrean spirit treasure.”

Ye Yuan was also extremely surprised when he heard it. He did not expect that the World Suppressing Stele’s background was actually so great!

The Heavenspan Mountain’s might, Ye Yuan already learned of it from Dustless and Kunwu’s mouth.

World Suppressing Stele, turns out it was a piece of rock on the Heavenspan Mountain!

“In this case, the World Suppressing Stele completely doesn’t need to be sanctified. It only needs to be developed continuously, and it can advance into a heavenly emperor spirit treasure?” Ye Yuan said in surprise.

Dustless said, “In theory, it’s like this!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Alright, when Senior devours enough evil spirits, I’ll enter inside the World Suppressing Stele and comprehend my own Dao!”

Dustless was speechless.

He discovered that Ye Yuan, this fellow, was simply a stubborn donkey!

Once he decided on a matter, he could not be pulled back no matter how one pulled.

It was like this back then in the turbulent spatial flow; now, it was still like this.

...

“Elder brothers, I wonder where there are more late-stage One-star evil spirits in this Yin Wind Den?”

Ye Yuan wandered inside the Yin Wind Den for a long time and discovered that most of them here were all some mortal-grade evil spirits. Occasionally, he could run into initial-stage One-star evil spirits.

These evil spirits were completely useless to Dustless.

Ye Yuan discovered that this place expanded in all directions. Wanting to find late-stage One-star evil spirits was too difficult, and he could only seek help from others.

The few people turned around. Seeing Ye Yuan’s cultivation, they could not refrain from looking at him with a gaze like looking at a fool.

“Kid, new here, right? Your bit of strength, better wander around the outer-ring! This place is already close to the danger zone. Your bit of strength isn’t even enough to fill the crevices between the evil spirits’ teeth!” Chang Liang said.

This group of people was precisely the Yin Wind Seven Heroes who were shot while lying down at the peripheral!

After the seven people came in, they headed straight for the danger zone.

The seven of them mucked around here all year round and were incomparably familiar with the Yin Wind Den.

Whenever there were powerful evil spirits, there would be natural treasures; they had this assumption in their hearts.

As for the Wang Family, although their strengths were powerful, they were really not familiar with this place.

Chang Liang also did not expect that they would run into Ye Yuan here.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Elder brothers, you all should be very familiar with this place, right?”

He saw that these few people’s gazes were very clear-cut, not like him, anyhow running around like a headless fly. He knew that these few people should be regulars of this place.

Chang Liang’s brows furrowed and he said, “The seven of us are called the Yin Wind Seven Heroes. Do you think we’re familiar with this place or not? Kid, we still have to go search for natural treasures and have no time to be long-winded with you. If you don’t want to die, wander around this neighborhood and see if you have the luck to pick up something that was missed out or not.”

Regarding Chang Liang’s sincere advice, Ye Yuan did not take it seriously at all.

What was important was that Chang Liang they all were familiar with this place.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Elder Brother and the others, since you all are familiar with this place, then bring me to go find late-stage One-star evil spirits. As long as I find the place, I’ll give you all 5000 low-grade divine essence stones as commission. How’s that?”
