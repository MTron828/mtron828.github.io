Chapter 2756: Then You Have to Hurry Up and Break Through!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Yan Jadetrue’s soul force was extremely powerful and extremely keen.

He had been paying attention to Ye Yuan’s every action and movement of absorbing the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation.

There was not the slightest anomaly!

“Enough!”

Yan Jadetrue was overjoyed and snatched the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation over.

This thing was too precious. Using it to probe was okay, but too much would be a waste.

This thing was the key that concerned whether or not he could break through to True Sovereign Heaven!

If it was used up by Ye Yuan, how would he still break through to True Sovereign Heaven?

Ye Yuan looked at Yan Jadetrue and said with a frown, “Now, you can let Li-er they all go, right?”

But Yan Jadetrue said with a smile that was not a smile, “Ye Yuan, you’re too dangerous! This exalt doesn’t want to be like your opponents, becoming the stepping stone on your road to maturity in the end! If I let them go, what will this exalt use to constrain you? Of course, if you have the ability, you can shuttle back and forth across countless planes and find your loved ones and friends.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said in a cold voice, “What the hell do you want?”

He knew that Yan Jadetrue was very troublesome. It was naturally impossible to let matters go so easily.

Letting people go at this time was simply impossible.

However, Ye Yuan was not in a hurry either. As long as Yan Jadetrue used the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation to cultivate, he would succumb eventually.

He did not appear overly enraged either because he knew that Yan Jadetrue knew him very well.

Behaving like he was burning with fury at this time would reveal a flaw instead and arouse the other party’s suspicions.

In reality, starting from when Ye Yuan showed himself, the two people had already been fighting a battle of wits and a contest of strength.

Ye Yuan understood that his every action and movement was being observed by the other party.

Even if he revealed a little flaw, the other party would have suspicions aroused.

It was Ye Yuan’s first time seeing Yan Jadetrue’s true body. It could be said that he did not understand the other party at all.

But he could toy with a world in the palm of his hand and could escape from the Labyrinth Divine Palace, that kind of forbidden land, with his life. It was absolutely not what the average person could accomplish.

Battling with this guy, Ye Yuan perked his spirits up 120%!

Therefore, Ye Yuan was extremely careful about every expression and sentence.

Yan Jadetrue seemed very satisfied with Ye Yuan’s reaction and said with a faint smile, “Nothing. This exalt is planning on killing you after breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven! After killing you, I’ll kill everyone related to you! Honestly speaking, this exalt really doesn’t have absolute confidence in making a move against you right now. But, letting you grow unchecked, this exalt will feel even more worried.”

This appraisal could be rated as high.

He, a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven, even though he was just of an origin divinity body, he did not have confidence in killing an upper Jade Sovereign Heaven.

Of course, this also showed that he knew Ye Yuan very well.

Because if he made a move, he really might not be able to keep Ye Yuan behind.

Moreover, there was even a powerful Big Yellow by his side.

Yan Jadetrue was of an origin divinity body. His combat power would definitely be greatly reduced.

He was not of the soul race, incomparably proficient in all kinds of origin divinity secret arts.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly, and he said in a cold voice, “In other words, you won’t rest until one of us is dead?”

Yan Jadetrue smiled and said, “Ye Yuan, why don’t … we play a game?”

“How to play?” Ye Yuan currently had no other way and could only play with the other party.

“I’ll return to the 33 Heavens right now and enter closed-seclusion to break through to True Sovereign Heaven! I left behind an origin divinity imprint in their bodies and can kill them with just a thought. You can traverse all the heavens’ planes now and go look for your loved ones and friends, and can also enter closed-seclusion to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

“If you break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven or find them before I break through to True Sovereign Heaven, I’ll flee far away from home and avoid you after breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven! But, if this exalt breaks through to True Sovereign Heaven first, then … sorry about it! I’ll kill all of them right away and then come kill you! How is it? Isn’t this game very interesting?”

Yan Jadetrue looked at Ye Yuan as if certain that he would play with him.

Yes, he knew Ye Yuan very well!

Precisely because he understood him that this so-called game of his was actually revealing his apprehension toward Ye Yuan.

Only by breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven did he have sufficient confidence to kill Ye Yuan!

In fact, even if Ye Yuan broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, he would also choose to leave right away.

Even if he really broke through to True Sovereign Heaven at that time!

He would rather face the uncertain at sea than face Ye Yuan.

He made use of Ye Yuan, but he also dreaded Ye Yuan.

Precisely because he knew Ye Yuan too well, that was why he dreaded Ye Yuan!

The present Ye Yuan was no longer that little bug that he could pinch to death at will.

This guy was only a major cultivation realm lower than him.

In reality, he himself also understood that making Ye Yuan go get the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation was playing with fire in itself.

A single mishap and it was setting fire to himself.

But the temptation of True Sovereign Heaven was too great!

Not getting the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation, not breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven, he would always be a walking corpse.

He who only had an origin divinity body was a dog who lost its home!

Therefore, he chose to gamble.

But kidnapping Ye Yuan’s kin would mean fighting it out with Ye Yuan to death.

He could not kill these people. If he killed these people, he did not dare to imagine what kind of degree the rampaging Ye Yuan would reach.

In fact, even if he broke through to True Sovereign Heaven, he was also not willing to have a frontal clash with the Ye Yuan who broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!

So, he was gambling too!

If Ye Yuan broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, he would not make a move against Ye Yuan’s kin. He would also have sufficient time to escape the Rainclear Continent.

That was as long as he reached True Sovereign Heaven.

Of course, if he broke through first, he would have sufficient confidence to finish Ye Yuan off.

At that time, he would have nothing to fear.

Both parties were sensible people. Ye Yuan instantly understood the other party’s plans and said in a solemn voice, “Okay, I’ll play this game with you!”

Yan Jadetrue smiled.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan did not act contrary to his expectations.

Everything was under control!

Ye Yuan passed Big Yellow a storage bracelet, and he said, “Big Yellow, you bring the things in here and return to the Myriad Demons Mountain first! Distribute the heavenly pills in it to the half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens of Myriad Demons Mountain and the Land of Heavenly South!”

Big Yellow hesitated briefly before taking it.

“Take care, Master Ye!” Finished saying, Big Yellow leaped and left the Heavenspan World.

Ye Yuan looked at Yan Jadetrue and said coolly, “If you want to play this game with me, you’ll have to hurry up and break through!”

Yan Jadetrue was just about to retort when he heard that but saw Ye Yuan suddenly turned into a true dragon. He took a stride, stepping out, escaping directly into the void and tearing through the boundary.

Seeing this scene, Yan Jadetrue’s expression changed wildly.

Feeling the remnant aura, Yan Jadetrue’s expression was solemn as he said, “There’s no mistake. This is the aura of a chaos true spirit! This kid actually advanced to a chaos true spirit with a mortal body! I even thought that he’d choose to break through first. I didn’t expect that … he actually chose to find people first! What this kid said was right. I should hurry up and break through!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, his expression changed, and he could not help laughing as he said, “What am I scared of? Even if he can traverse the void, it will delay cultivation time too! Even if he can really find his loved ones, after this exalt breaks through to True Sovereign Heaven, could it be that he can still run?”

That might be the case, but Yan Jadetrue’s origin divinity instantly turned into an afterimage and vanished from the Heavenspan World!
