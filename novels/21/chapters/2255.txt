Chapter 2259: Substituting Arrow With Sword!

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye fleeing Eight Void Mountain was akin to the tiger returning to the mountains, a fish entering the seas!

As long as he recovered slightly, with Ye Yuan’s bit of strength, he could just wait to be slaughtered, unless he could attain Dao in Eight Void Mountain. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Riverword’s expression changed, and he said, “The Limitless God Killing Bow’s power is extremely strong, but your strength ...”

Ye Yuan said, “Relax! I have a score in my heart! Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye is too strong. I can’t let him leave!”

Riverword’s gaze glimmered and he said with a nod, “Okay, you be careful!”

After talking, he did not hesitate either, taking out the Limitless God Killing Bow. He passed it to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan did not say a word, removing the restrictions on the bow in no time flat. A terrifying surge of power engulfed the wildness!

The entire Eight Void Mountain was stunned by the Limitless God Killing Bow’s horrifying aura.

“Dao artifact! It’s a Dao artifact! What terrifying power, no wonder the three of them pursued until here!” When someone saw the Limitless God Killing Bow, even the pitch of their voice changed.

A terrifying backlash force gushed out of the Limitless God Killing Bow, wanting to kill Ye Yuan like killing those Heavenly Emperors.

But right then, an even more majestic and imposing aura suddenly released from Ye Yuan’s body, suppressing the Limitless God Killing Bow’s power.

That was the pressure of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!

Dao artifact! The reason why it was called Dao artifact was that the powerful Dao accumulations hidden inside were akin to Heavenly Dao personally descending.

But any Dao artifact still paled in comparison when in front of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!

The Limitless God Killing Bow’s haughtiness that had just shown its head was thoroughly suppressed by Ye Yuan.

All this was quietly completed in the instant that Ye Yuan gripped the Limitless God Killing Bow. Bystanders did not detect it at all.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help turning pale with fright. Riverword even had a look of astonishment.

Such a precious treasure, there was simply no way of controlling if one’s strength was not up to par.

But Ye Yuan actually did not suffer the least bit of backlash when holding it in his hand.

In fact, he felt fear, this emotion, from the Limitless God Killing Bow!

This made him feel extremely absurd!

Why would a Dao artifact fear an Empyrean?

But the more he denied it, the stronger this feeling got.

Ye Yuan gripped the Limitless God Killing Bow in his hand, his aura instantly skyrocketed to the peak.

It was as if the enormous Eight Void Mountain only had him alone left!

“Sword, come!”

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned, countless divine essence gathered over from all directions, forming a light sword!

Bow arched, sword notched!

These movements were completed in one go, akin to floating clouds and flowing water – natural and smooth.

Eight Void Mountain’s powerhouses were already dumbstruck with amazement. Ye Yuan actually substituted the arrow with a sword by condensing a sword with the power of source!

Every element was not something that should happen to a martial artist at Ye Yuan’s realm.

Yet, these impossible things gathered onto his person alone!

Ye Yuan’s essence, energy, and spirit poured into the Limitless God Killing Bow crazily. However, a Dao artifact was a Dao artifact after all.

All the strength in Ye Yuan’s body was virtually depleted in an instant.

While he merely only pulled an extremely small angle on the Limitless God Killing Bow.

But just this extremely small angle was sufficient!

“Go!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, fingers letting go slightly. The light sword disappeared with a swoosh.

Rumble!

A breath later, an astonishing loud boom came from the distance.

Talking about it was slow, but actually, from when Heavenly Eye left to Ye Yuan chasing after, then to drawing the bow and releasing the arrow, it was merely several breaths time.

With Heavenly Eye’s current speed, it was merely a distance of several million miles.

This distance did not count as far at all to a Dao artifact’s arrow.

Ye Yuan’s divine sense was constantly locked hard onto him. With this arrow tearing across the sky, it arrived in an instant.

A Dao artifact coupled with Ye Yuan’s sword of source, how astonishing was the power?

No need to look, Ye Yuan also knew that Heavenly Eye would have to recuperate for more than a thousand years even if he did not die this time.

The entire mountain was silent. Everyone put down the things in their hands and looked at this young man who was a nobody.

In several days, among the three great Deva Realm powerhouses, two were dead and one was seriously injured.

This proud battle achievement was sufficient to be written in the annals of history!

Thinking back now, everyone also felt like they were dreaming.

“Just what kind of freak is this boy? This emperor has comprehended on Dao at Eight Void Mountain for many years and it simply can’t compare to his measly few days!”

“Not only is his comprehension ability exceptional, but he can also even suppress Dao artifacts and comprehend the source of Sword Dao! How can there be such a monstrous person in this world?”

“This boy clearly has a Dao artifact in his hands. But why do I actually not have the desire to snatch it over?”

“Dealing with him must have a surefire plan! Once you can’t kill him, the consequences will be catastrophic!”

... ...

Eight Void Mountain was the holy land of the formation path, the hidden lucky chances were countless.

The powerhouses that come here to comprehend formations and excavate treasures were too many to enumerate. Even high-level Heavenly Emperors were not in the minority too.

It was just that these few days, Ye Yuan and Heavenly Eye two parties sent the Eight Void Mountain into a tizzy.

Seeing Ye Yuan cut down Deva Realms overwhelmingly, this kind of impact was seriously too strong, resulting in the treasure being in front, but they did not dare to have designs on it.

A few days ago, the people who had designs on it had all already turned to dust.

Even Deva Realm powerhouses died, let alone them?

Of course, there were quite a few people who saw that Ye Yuan was debilitated, their gazes revealing murderous gleams too.

But no one dared to come forward.

The place where Ye Yuan was located was at the fringe of the restrictions. He could enter Eight Void Mountain at any time.

Inside restrictions, Ye Yuan was close to invincible!

The high altitudes of Eight Void Mountain naturally had several Deva Realm experts hidden too.

Originally, the fight here had nothing to do with them, they could not be bothered either.

But that instant when Ye Yuan took out the Limitless God Killing Bow, there were still quite a few people who were moved.

It was just that there was still nobody who dared to take action.

The overturned cart in front was a warning for those people behind. Ruining one’s cultivation base for a Dao artifact was not worth it!

“Go, up the mountain!”

Ye Yuan threw the Limitless God Killing Bow back to Riverword and swallowed medicinal pills himself, rapidly restoring his physical strength.

But leaving Eight Void Mountain at this time was clearly not a wise move.

Eight Void Mountain’s powerhouses were too many, rashly leaving without recovering to peak state was equivalent to a lamb walking into the tiger’s mouth.

Right now, everyone was looking at him. It was hard to guarantee that people would not be moved.

Being stimulated by Ye Yuan previously, quite a few middle and late-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses all went straight down the mountain and comprehended on Dao from the beginning.

At this time, there were quite a lot of powerhouses at the foot of the mountain too.

As for those with weak strength at the foot of the mountain, they were currently quaking in their boots.

After all, Dao artifact this sort of thing, the power was truly too great!

Ye Yuan holding the Limitless God Killing Bow in his hand earlier, there was even a misconception that he could shoot through this sky!

That arrow earlier, people reckoned that even a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor would find it very hard to receive.

This arrow also let Ye Yuan have a clear understanding of how terrifying Dao artifacts were. No wonder so many people would be moved.

Ye Yuan brought the two people and went straight up to 2800 miles.

it was only to see him repeatedly snap his fingers, the power of restrictions suddenly erupted.

This scene gave everyone a fright.

“What’s he doing? Committing suicide?” Someone cried out in surprise.

But, in the next instant, Eight Void Mountain’s spiritual energy suddenly surged, gathering over toward Ye Yuan this side.

At the 3000 miles area, a Deva Realm formation path expert had a stunned look as he said in shock, “This ... Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions can still be played like this? Looks like this Deva was really ridiculously wrong these few years!”

It turned out that the Eight Void Mountain’s restriction that Ye Yuan triggered was actually a Spirit Gathering Grand Array!
