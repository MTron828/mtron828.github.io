Chapter 3008: No Matter What, the Boss Is Still Stronger!

“No need to go anymore! Whoever dares disturb Ye Yuan’s cultivation, this progenitor will definitely execute them!”

An indifferent to the extreme sentence announced the return of a supreme overlord!

Mi Tian transformed into a middle-aged human, fluttering with immortal qi, and had an imposing appearance.

He just stood there and did not release any pressure. But everyone’s imposing auras were all suppressed by him!

This was the former Dragon Clan overlord!

This was the powerhouse who once made the Dragon Clan incomparably glorious!

His gaze was not focused on any particular person, but everyone seemed to be stared down by him.

Kong Nie, Qian Yu, Long Jian, Bai Zhi, Luan Qinghe, Xuan Taiqing, so on and so forth; everyone’s eyes had immense shock.

Of course, Mi Zhen was the most shocked.

His eyeballs were almost popping out.

This guy, who should originally have died, actually returned alive and well!

This … How was this possible?

Why was he here?

Why did he come out of the Eternal River?

Countless questions appeared in Mi Zhen’s mind. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You … You actually didn’t die?” Kong Nie stammered, asking everyone’s doubts.

Mi Tian smiled faintly and said, “You seem very surprised?”

An Hegemon Realm, if he died, he died. If he lived, he lived. It was not a big problem.

But a Great Beyond Realm powerhouse resurrecting from the dead, that was absolutely a major event that affected all the heavens!

Back then, when the news of Mi Tian’s demise spread, it shocked the heavens.

Especially Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, huge waves were set off!

The Dragon Clan also started to decline since then.

But today, Mi Tian returned domineeringly. A storm would surely be set off in the 33 Heavens again!

Kong Nie snorted coldly and said, “Old fellow, stop playing tricks here. You think this ancestor is scared of you?”

Mi Tian was indifferent and said coolly, “You can come and try.”

Kong Nie felt contempt!

“Humph!?An old thing that disappeared for god knows how many years, do you really think that this ancestor is scared of you? Today, this ancestor will let you know that presently, it’s no longer your era anymore!”

Boom!

The moment Progenitor Kong Nie’s aura was released, a fiendish energy billowed to the sky, instantly sweeping across the entire Heavenly Dragon Island.

Each and every one of the Hegemon Realm powerhouses avoided like the plague.

This level of powerhouse engaging in a fight was seriously too frightening!

If it was really a life-and-death great battle, demolishing a world was not impossible too.

On Heavenly Dragon Island, fiendish energy rolled.

Kong Nie’s body directly grew until it reached the horizon!

Everyone drew a breath of cold air, being dumbfounded by this shocking change.

This was the earliest ancestor of all True Fiend Dharma Idols!

“True Fiend’s Rage!”

With a huge roar, Progenitor Kong Nie smashed a fist over. The void trembled violently.

Progenitor Mi Tian did not dodge, throwing a punch out leisurely.

If Ye Yuan were here, he would definitely be incredibly shocked.

It was because he was too familiar with this move!

Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist!

But, when this punch was executed at Mi Tian’s hands, it was totally different from Ye Yuan!

A formidable aura of eternal life emanated from Mi Tian’s body.

In an instant, the two titans exchanged a blow in the void.

Boom!

Everyone felt the entire Heavenly Dragon Island shaking.

Then they were dumbstruck with shock.

Progenitor Kong Nie’s body was directly beaten back to its original form!

The true fiend body was actually blown apart by Ancestor Mi Tian with one punch!

Mi Zhen’s pupils constricted. The awe-inspiring power of this punch was no less than back then!

“S-So strong! Is this the ancestor of the Dragon Clan who once suppressed the myriad realms? He hasn’t even unleashed his true body!”

“Could it be that the news of his demise back then was fake, and he was actually hiding himself to cultivate?”

“This punch is also too strong, right? Progenitor Kong Nie actually can’t last one exchange with him! He’s ultimately stronger!”

… …

Everyone nodded their heads one after another, feeling that these words were extremely right.

The battle of Great Beyonds, it was most soul-stirring, easily fighting until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open.

But, although this battle was impressive, it was not as cruel as everyone imagined.

Mi Tian’s punch defeated the enemy domineeringly!

Progenitor Kong Nie’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

His eyes when looking at Mi Tian carried some fear amidst the shock.

Progenitor Kong Nie and Progenitor Mi Zhen, both were old monster-level existences.

But Mi Tian’s birth was far earlier than theirs.

Before they became famous, Mi Zhen’s reputation already shook the heavens.

The soul race had Hegemon Samsara. Nobody dared to go and provoke at all.

But Mi Tian went!

He beat Hegemon Heavenly Soul until he could not do anything about it and even borrowed the soul race’s soul canon from Hegemon Samsara’s hands to read.

This matter, even ordinary Great Beyond powerhouses did not dare to do it too.

Now, he returned domineeringly, suppressing myriad realms with one punch!

“Still not convinced? If you’re not convinced, the two of you can come together! Today, you can demolish Heavenly Dragon Island. But tomorrow, you can forget about keeping your old lairs; best to move houses early,” Mi Tian looked at the two mighty Great Beyond powerhouses as he said coolly.

Great Beyond Realm powerhouses were naturally not so easy to kill.

But Mi Tian alone could demolish their old nests!

You could not even defend against it!

Therefore, in wars between heavens, and battles of Great Beyond Realms, it rarely affected the family.

Kong Nie and Qian Yu, two mighty Great Beyond powerhouses, were suppressed until they had no temper.

Qian Yu said in a solemn voice, “Old Man Mi Tian, you’re a little too overbearing, right? A brat from your family is cultivating, and you’re going to make a hundred Hegemons from all the heavens wait?”

Mi Tian said nonchalantly, “This progenitor has always been overbearing. Is this your first time hearing about it? If you have the ability, you guys can come out with a brat to turn the Eternal River upside down too! This old man is very fair. When the time comes, I absolutely won’t even let out a fart!”

All the Hegemons’ faces turned black.

Are you freaking kidding me?

Where would I go to find a brat?

“Moreover, can you all only cultivate in the Eternal River? All the heavens and myriad worlds, they were formed by the Eternal River. Each blade of grass and each tree contains Great Dao! You all are holed up in the Eternal River everyday. When can you catch up to this old man?” Mi Tian continued to deliver deadly blows.

Actually, Mi Tian also holed up in the Eternal River all day in the past.

But Ye Yuan’s words made him suddenly see the light.

Only then did he realize. He was too narrow-minded in the past!

Each person’s Dao was different.

The existence of all the heavens and myriad worlds was an extremely philosophical thing in itself.

Perhaps a very minor thing could open a new world!

Everyone pursued the Door of Eternal Life, the water of the Eternal River, but abandoned the great forest. It was attending to the superficials and neglecting the fundamentals sometimes.

It was just that when these words were said, the group of Hegemons found it extremely grating on the ears.

Freaking hell, talk is cheap!

“Old Thing, consider yourself ruthless! This time, Your Father admits my bad luck!” Kong Nie gnashed his teeth in hatred and directly tore through the void and left.

This face could not be regained anymore!

Ever since, the Dragon Clan resumed to having two mighty Great Beyond powerhouses holding down the fort once more, sitting firmly on the number one seat of all the heavens.

This era was ultimately the era of the old men!

The Kong Nie who tore through the void was somewhat sour.

“Farewell!” Qian Yu had a cold face and directly dissipated into nothing.

The other Hegemons exchanged glances, dispersing one after another.

The Great Beyond Realm old monsters all ran away. What were they staying behind for?

Looking for abuse?

While at this time, all of the members of the dragon race were excited until they were almost jumping up and down.

Except for Mi Zhen …
