Chapter 2312: Medicine Ancestor’s Invitation!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“That’s my great-grandson! Did you guys see that? He’s called Yun Yi! That’s my great-grandson! My great-grandson won the championship of the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time! Hahaha ...”

In the crowd, Empyrean Pilljade danced excitedly and started yelling around.

Even though Empyrean Pilljade was arrogant, he had never thought that his family’s child would actually be standing on the stage of the entire Heavenspan World, and that he would become the alchemy path’s number one person!

It was not that he did not want to, but with his level, he did not dare to think about this step at all.

Poverty restricted his imagination!

To him, the greatest expectations he had of Yun Yi was succeeding his position and dominating the Southern Border.

But Yun Yi’s current achievements had already far exceeded what he defined, reaching a level that he could not imagine.

Defeating Zou Rui, the current Yun Yi was already equivalent to the young generation’s number one person!

How did the current Empyrean Pilljade still remember Yun Yi’s betrayal? How did he still remember his resentment and enmity with Ye Yuan?

All that was left in his head was just a word: pride.

Beside him, Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure, as well as Empyrean Flutterfeather, all had dumbfounded faces.

Clearly, they also found it hard to imagine this result.

The other people looked at Empyrean Pilljade with strange faces, like they were looking at a fool.

“Seen before those who claimed kinship, never seen before someone who claimed kinship like this.”

“He won and he’s your grandson, where have you been? Only running out to claim kinship now, I’ll even say that you’re my grandson now!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Screw off, you! With just your poor and shabby appearance, can you teach such an excellent great-grandson?”

... ...

Nobody believed Empyrean Pilljade at all.

The powerhouses on Feather Mountain all had fixed seats, if Yun Yi was really Empyrean Pilljade’s great-grandson, he should be seated in a very revered place, and not the same as them, standing in this tiny corner.

This kind of lie could only make him appear very laughable and ignorant.

Empyrean Pilljade’s face turned black, immediately having a look of shame on his face.

Yeah, if he chose to support Yun Yi back then, then the current situation would be completely different.

When everyone saw his appearance, they were even more certain that he was boasting.

... ...

Amidst the huge shock, the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference finally came to an end. A Southern Domain’s small faction called Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma became famous all over the world.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy personally gave two copies of Medicine Ancestor’s handwritten notes to Yun Yi and Ning Siyu, then carried out a bout of praises with a smile.

Yun Yi was currently more and more like Ye Yuan and naturally remained indifferent whether granted favors or was subjected to humiliation.

While Ning Siyu only had Ye Yuan this master in her eyes. Whatever Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s praise, she did not care at all.

Just as everyone thought that the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time would end with Cloudpill Summit’s crushing defeat, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy arrived before Ye Yuan.

“Second Sage, Master invites you up Cloudheart Mountain to debate on things.”

Everyone’s minds trembled, the Medicine Ancestor was personally moving out!

The real highlight was here!

The moment these words came out, it was as if the air had solidified.

The Medicine Ancestor was already not just the name of a powerhouse, he already became the insignia of Alchemy Dao.

He was the ceiling of Alchemy Dao!

He was the Dao Ancestor of Alchemy Dao!

He was not a Dao Ancestor, but in the hearts of all alchemists, he was a Dao Ancestor!

An invincible existence!

Even a powerhouse like Sacred Ancestor High Priest also could not challenge his prestige.

But today, Ye Yuan’s one lineage, master and disciples three people overpowering Cloudheart Realm, dealt Cloudheart Realm a vicious slap.

The Medicine Ancestor finally could not sit still anymore!

He was a transcendent existence and rarely showed face in the world.

For countless years, only when Sacred Ancestor High Priest went up the mountain back then to seek Dao did he take action one time.

Today, for Ye Yuan, he finally made a move once more.

One was a rising star, startlingly talented, the best in the present era.

One was Alchemy Dao’s founder, reigning for countless years, invincible under the heavens.

These two people’s fight would definitely cause a shocking wave.

Then, would Ye Yuan accept the Medicine Ancestor’s invitation or not?

Everyone was waiting to see it!

Only to see Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Can’t finally bear to take action? Huhu, had to insist on this Ye giving a slap before he’s willing to make a move. Why is there a need?”

Everyone got a shock. Did this guy make light of Medicine Ancestor?

Everyone present took pride in being able to meet Medicine Ancestor.

Being able to obtain his guidance, they even wanted to prostrate in worship.

But Ye Yuan actually did not have the least bit of awe at all.

Someone who cultivated the alchemy path actually had no respect for the totem-like Medicine Ancestor!

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy smiled and said, “Whatever dissatisfaction Second Sage has, you can go and tell Master. Lastingjoy is just acting on orders.”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said smilingly, “Brother Lastingjoy, this Ye really looks forward to being able to fight with Brother Lastingjoy one day.”

Lastingjoy smiled and said, “It’s a great honor for Lastingjoy to be able to be thought highly of by Second Sage. However, this emperor only gained enlightenment on Dao by chance back then. For so many years, my progress has been very slow and has long already been surpassed by Junior Apprentice Brother. Second Sage defeated Junior Apprentice Brother, this emperor is naturally not a match.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Lead the way.”

He would not naively think that Lastingjoy was really inferior to Distantbook.

He heard before that this Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy and the Medicine Ancestor were existences of the same era, and had already lived for no idea how long.

To be able to become the Medicine Ancestor’s eldest disciple and even comprehend Dao pill source, how can he possibly be a mediocre person?

Seeing this Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy gave Ye Yuan an unfathomable feeling.

How his strength was, it was hard for Ye Yuan to jump to conclusions rashly. But he had a feeling that even if this Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was not as good as Sacred Ancestor High Priest, Ye Yuan reckoned that he was also not far off.

At least, he was definitely stronger than Heavenly Emperor Distantbook.

But this guy put on an appearance of being very simple and honest, giving you a feeling of defenselessness, his sense of existence being extremely low.

This guy was playing the fool, so Ye Yuan could not be bothered to haggle over it with him too.

After all, the Medicine Ancestor was the alchemy path’s superlative.

Seeing the alchemy path’s highest peak was the most important objective of Ye Yuan’s trip.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy turned around and said to everyone, “The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference ends here. Master and Second Sage’s game, everyone can head to Cloudheart Mountain to observe! If you’re not interested, you can leave.”

Finished talking, he brought the group of ancestors and left.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy said so, but such a grand occasion was hard to come across in tens of millions of years. So how could they miss it?

Therefore, everyone rushed toward Cloudheart Mountain.

It thoroughly exploded in the crowd!

“You guys, between Medicine Ancestor and Second Sage, who do you think will win and who will lose?”

“Look at what you’re saying; how ignorant! It’s true that Second Sage is formidable, but it was already extremely difficult for him to defeat Heavenly Emperor Distantbook. Still want to beat the Medicine Ancestor?”

“Heh, so many years have passed. There’s already no one who knows the terror of Medicine Ancestor anymore! He is a summit that can’t be scaled! On the path of Alchemy Dao, he’s the Heavenspan Mountain!”

“Heh heh, I hope that Second Sage can still grow up after experiencing this battle!”

... ...

This was a showdown without any suspense. The only thing to watch was how terribly Ye Yuan would lose.

Back then, after the Sacred Ancestor High Priest lost to Medicine Ancestor, he was in depression for a very long period of time.

All the way until later, he founded the Priest Temple and groomed demon race alchemy rare talents.

Then now, similar to Sacred Ancestor High Priest, could Ye Yuan experience this unprecedented setback and stand up again?
