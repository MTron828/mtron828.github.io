Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What did you say? Whalebillow the four of them are not that human’s match?”

When Yun Yang heard about this kid, he suddenly stood up, a look of disbelief in his eyes.

Wu Tuan’s turtle face was almost squeezing into a ball as she said bitterly, “Yes, Lord Yun Yang! Lord Waycloud asked you to move faster. Any slower and they won’t be able to withstand anymore!”

Yun Yang felt like he was listening to a book from heaven. With four great war generals going into battle together, unless it was a war between sea regions, it was completely impossible.

Five great war generals each ruled a region. They were all existences who had millions under them and only one person above them.

To be able to make them join forces, what kind of terrifying strength did that require? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A human lower Saint Sovereign Heaven actually forced the four people to do this!

“Damn it! Lord Sovereign is currently in closed-seclusion to deal with the True Sovereign Dao tribulation. He can’t get away! Inviting the war generals of other sea regions to take action will definitely cause us to bleed!”

Yun Yang called three people over and instructed: “The three of you, go to Ding Xiang Sea Region and Pei Yun Sea Region right now. You must invite two general-level powerhouses to take action! As for the price, as long as they are willing to take action, each person will have three Sea Soul Pills!”

Everyone’s expressions changed, and they cried out in surprise, “Sea Soul Pill! Your Excellency, Sea Soul Pills has to do with entering True Sovereign Heaven. Isn’t this too costly?”

Yun Yang waved his hand and said, “How can True Sovereign Heaven be so easy to enter? Sea Soul Pills can strengthen the origin divinity and greatly increase the chances of breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven, but that’s all. With these guys’ shrewdness, would they be willing to make a move if we don’t pay the price? Alright, you guys go, if Lord Qian Kui really blames, this exalt will shoulder it!”

Yun Yang already said so. They naturally did not dare to say anymore.

After the three people left, Yun Yang passed the order, commanding all of Qian Kui Sea Region’s grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens to all rush to the battlefield!

Anyone who defied the order would be executed without pardon!

After the order was passed, Yun Yang brought Wu Tuan as well as seven to eight grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens. They whizzed away to the battlefield.

… …

“Lord Yun Yang is here too!”

“This … This is the entire Qian Kui Hall swarming out in full force!”

“Could it be that so many people can’t take this kid down too?”

… …

Seeing the battlefield getting bigger and bigger, the expressions of the Saint Sovereign Heavens present changed one after another.

They originally thought that it was just a trivial matter.

Just killing a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven, how major could it be?

But now, it actually caused the Qian Kui Hall to emerge in full force!

Feeling more and more powerful auras, Ye Yuan felt a headache too.

He already showed mercy in his action, alright?

Could it be that these seafolks were all lunatics?

If he did not kill people, did they really take him to be a soft persimmon?

If not for being apprehensive of True Sovereign Heavens, he would not care about these seafolks’ life and death.

The reason why he showed mercy was merely because he did not want to offend True Sovereign Heavens terribly.

But now, they were bullying others too far!

Yun Yang brought seven to eight grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens and joined the battlefield. Ye Yuan’s pressure suddenly increased!

He exclaimed, “Everyone, this Ye has already shown mercy. Can’t you really not tell? If you keep pushing me like this, don’t blame this Ye for not being courteous anymore!”

Eight grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens, plus five grand completion transformation realms, this combat power could already be called terrifying.

Ye Yuan was strong, but it was also impossible to be so strong.

At this time, he already had his full strength being forced out too and was unable to hold back anymore.

What was left was a life and death battle!

Ye Yuan did not want to offend a sea region to the core, but these guys were bullying people too far.

The trouble that Jingfei caused was not small, but later on, he also asked about it. It was not really a serious matter. There was no need to be irreconcilable till death.

It was also precisely because of this that he had been pulling his punches all along.

Otherwise, at the beginning, Ye Yuan could have directly employed the Universe Sword Formation and annihilated Whalebillow and Starshine!

“Boy, it’s also not that we can’t stop. As long as you hand over that girl, everything can be discussed! Otherwise, my Qian Kui Sea Region’s face won’t tolerate a human like yourself to provoke like this!” Whalebillow also shouted.

In reality, they were scared too!

The participation of Yun Yang and eight great grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens merely fought to a draw with Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s sword formation was seriously unbelievably strong.

But now, the arrow was notched on the bow and had no choice but to release it!

If they could not keep Jingfei behind, they were seriously unable to give an explanation.

Both sides stuck to their guns just like that.

Over there, Jingfei, who had been rejoicing all along, also could not laugh anymore with this.

No matter how mischievous she was, she also knew that she caused big trouble this time.

How could she have thought that the momentary mischievousness previously would have caused the entire Qian Kui Sea Region to riot?

This joke blew up a little too big.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, why don’t … you hand Jingfei over??Sniff sniff

?… I … I was wrong!” Jingfei cried while running.

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “What a joke! If the sky falls, I’ll shoulder it! Big Yellow, there are more and more of them. You quickly bring Jingfei south and break out of the encirclement. I’ll rush over very soon!”

“Yes, Master Ye!”

Big Yellow felt a headache too, wishing to smack Jingfei to death with one slap.

This lass was too capable of causing trouble!

However, Big Yellow had been together with Ye Yuan for a long time, and he already understood Ye Yuan’s temper very well.

At this time, he absolutely would not abandon his companion and leave.

When Ye Yuan was holding back previously, he was naturally holding back too. The Coquettish Profligate Hoof did not erupt with full power.

At this time, he no longer held anything back. With a roar, his body suddenly started twisting strangely.

Boom!

A kick thrust out, the three to four middle Saint Sovereign Heavens in front were directly burst apart by him!

Carving open a bloody path, Big Yellow headed straight for Jingfei.

With another hoof kick, it sent those Saint Sovereign Heavens chasing after him flying.

Then, he took Jingfei and sprinted south.

“Chase! You must keep that lass behind for this exalt! Yuan Chen, you go and help, kill that bull!”

Whalebillow bellowed, ordering one of the grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens to get out of the battlefield and pursue.

When Ye Yuan heard that, a hint of cold light flashed across his eyes, and he yelled coldly, “This Ye wants to see who can leave! Kill!”

At this time, Ye Yuan was genuinely enraged too.

It was only to see him yell fiercely. The Universe Sword Formation suddenly became fierce.

Previously, he had always been focusing on defense; offense was secondary.

Now, he could not care less anymore, directly turning the Universe Sword Formation into a killing move!

For a time, cold light erupted brilliantly!

That Yuan Chen was just about to leave the battlefield when he was directly pierced by dozens of sword lights, falling into the sea.

This was Ye Yuan’s first time employing a killing move!

However, as soon as the killing move came out, Ye Yuan’s defense was greatly weakened too.

After all, they were five great transformation experts present. Under this blow, he suffered some injuries too.

Seeing Ye Yuan suddenly become fierce, Whalebillow and the rest were greatly shocked.

Only then did they know how terrifying the power of this sword formation was!

Before, Ye Yuan was really holding back too much.

Otherwise, if they came one by one, they would have died long ago!

But, once Ye Yuan’s killing move was unleashed, and once a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven fell, this matter really could not be resolved anymore.

Whalebillow shouted loudly, “Boy, you dare to kill people! Today, it’s irreconcilable till death!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned fierce, and he said with a cold snort, “Do you all really think that I’m scared of you? This Ye gave in time and again, but you all keep pushing it! Reaching the limit of my patience, then there’s no need to tolerate anymore!”
