Chapter 2037: Unrelenting

“Grand completion Dao Realm! This is definitely grand completion Dao Realm!”

“My God! What did I see? A thousand over years old grand completion Dao Realm, is there still justice?”

“Terrifying! Too terrifying! I’ve never seen before such a monster! No wonder he dared to look down on the numerous Seven-star Alchemy Gods, he indeed has this capital!”

...

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, the entire plaza was boiling over with excitement.

The eyes of those junior disciples revealed extremely fervent expressions. The idolizing feelings were not only expressed in words but also on the face.

No one could have thought that Ye Yuan was actually a grand completion Dao Realm mighty expert. This was too inconceivable to an alchemist that was only a thousand over years old.

Overwhelming!

An absolutely domineering crushing!

At this very moment, everyone was in the midst of shock.

This kind of domineering crushing, only people in the grand completion Dao Realm could do it.

But such a young person reaching the grand completion Dao Realm already exceeded everyone’s imagination.

What kind of concept was grand completion Dao Realm?

In the entire Southern Border, at the Cloudpill Summit presently, it represented the highest standard.

And these 100 over Seven-star Alchemy Gods that were able to reach the grand completion Dao Realm did not surpass the number of fingers on both hands.

One should not look at how there were more than ten grandmasters up there. Those able to reach the grand completion Dao Realm were only the seven great peak holy land’s masters.

As for the invited grandmasters, they were basically all late-stage Dao Realm. They were still a hair away from reaching grand completion.

But who among these Seven-star Alchemy Gods did not trudge for several hundred thousand years along the alchemy path, or even a million years before they had today’s accomplishments?

But today, a True God Realm junior, a thousand over years old brat, was actually already grand completion Dao Realm!

This kind of astoundment simply could not use words to express.

How powerful was Empyrean Proudcloud? But even so, he actually almost vomited blood under Ye Yuan’s pressure.

Under Ye Yuan’s light, Empyrean Proudcloud was dim like stars in a haze; practically could not be seen.

At this very moment, Empyrean Proudcloud only wanted the alchemy battle to hurry up and end. He already almost could not bear it anymore.

A strong sense of humiliation welled up crazily in his heart.

He knew that Ye Yuan definitely detected his trick, that was why he attacked him in such a fierce manner.

Except, why was this guy able to block his divine soul attack?

He thought that he did it at the behest of gods and ghosts, who knew that it could not do anything to Ye Yuan at all.

I better ... I better directly give up and admit defeat! Empyrean Proudcloud thought bitterly in his heart.

“Huhu, a dignified Seven-star Alchemy God only has this bit of strength? Really disappointing!” Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s ridiculing reached his ears.

Empyrean Proudcloud gritted his teeth and said, “Brat, d-don’t you get cocky! I’ll let you take a look at this Empyrean’s strength!”

Empyreans had the pride of an Empyrean. With Ye Yuan’s nonchalant goading, how could Empyrean Proudcloud endure it? Gritting his teeth, he erupted once more.

It was just that his aura had yet to appear and it was extinguished by Ye Yuan without the least bit of mercy.

In front of Ye Yuan, he actually did not have the slightest leeway to resist.

“Condense!”

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, and a pill was formed!

While at this moment, Empyrean Proudcloud seemed to have experienced a great battle, his entire person appearing somewhat feeble.

Although an Empyrean’s divine soul and divine essence was extremely thick and Ye Yuan could not really do anything to him, teaching him a bit of a lesson was still achievable.

In this alchemy battle, the two people were not on the same level at all. For Empyrean Proudcloud to want to refine pills under Ye Yuan’s heavy pressure, he had to expend several times, even several dozen times of Ye Yuan’s effort.

Even if he was an Empyrean, he was also incredibly weary at this time.

When everyone looked at this scene, they could not help casting pitying gazes towards Empyrean Proudcloud.

“Really too strong! It’s still my first time seeing a Six-star Alchemy God torment a Seven-star Alchemy God until like this.”

“Ye Yuan really overpowered Empyrean Proudcloud with strength, the title of grandmaster is well-deserving!”

“Don’t you guys forget! What Ye Yuan used was just a celestial deity mystic treasure, but what Empyrean Proudcloud used was an empyrean spirit treasure!”

...

The moment this came out, the surroundings fell silent.

Empyrean Proudcloud was crushed by Ye Yuan until he was black and blue all over under the circumstances of holding all the cards.

This strength could really use horrifying to describe.

“Ye Yuan, vast spirit divine-grade!”

“Empyrean Proudcloud ... middle-grade!”

The judge gave Empyrean Proudcloud a rueful glance and slowly said.

“Hahaha!”

A wave of laughter came from below.

An exalted Seven-star Alchemy God actually only refined a middle-grade when refining a rank six divine pill. It was simply a massive joke.

The current Empyrean Proudcloud wished to find a hole in the ground to tunnel into.

Before the alchemy match, how fired up with boundless enthusiasm was he? Completely not putting Ye Yuan in his eyes.

But now, reality gave him a resounding slap.

In front of Ye Yuan, he was nothing.

Empyrean Proudcloud’s gaze secretly shot a glance at Ye Yuan, filled with enmity.

This kid made him utterly lose his face today!

When had he, an exalted Empyrean, a Seven-star Alchemy God in the late-stage Dao Realm mighty expert, suffered such humiliation before?

However, nobody was paying attention to him anymore. Everyone’s gaze was focused on Ye Yuan.

A thousand over years old grand completion Dao Realm! This was too terrifying!

With Ye Yuan’s talent, he might be able to become a second Medicine Ancestor in the future!

At this time, Empyrean Purplewing suddenly opened his mouth and said, “I believe everyone has already seen Ye Yuan’s strength. There shouldn’t be anyone with objections about him sitting on a grandmaster seat anymore, right?”

Empyrean Purplewing was already completely convinced by Ye Yuan. At this very moment, he no longer had any complaints about Empyrean Flutterfeather handing the grandmaster token to Ye Yuan.

On the contrary, he was full of admiration toward Ye Yuan.

Such a young grand completion Dao Realm, it was absolutely adding wings to a tiger to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

“Of course there’s no objections! If even a grand completion Dao Realm can’t sit on a grandmaster seat, then who else is fit to sit up there?”

“There’s no need to compete anymore for those at the back too, Grandmaster Ye’s title lives up to his name!”

...

The group of Empyreans no longer had objections. Ye Yuan already used his strength to convince all of the Seven-star Alchemy Gods from the bottom of their hearts.

But right at this time, a discordant voice slowly sounded out. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Since he accepted the challenge, then he naturally had to finish competing in the alchemy battles. He’ll hand over the grandmaster token if he loses a match, this was what he said. How can he go back on his word?”

The one who spoke was precisely Empyrean Pilljade.

Everyone’s hearts turned cold, not expecting that Empyrean Pilljade was actually still biting on and not letting go!

Empyrean Purplewing frowned and said, “Brother Pilljade, Ye Yuan already proved his strength, what significance is there still to continue competing?”

But Empyrean Pilljade smiled and said, “Even if this Empyrean agrees, I’m afraid that Brother Chaoyuan won’t agree too, is that right, Brother Chaoyuan?”

Everyone’s gazes looked toward Empyrean Chaoyuan collectively.

“What’s the meaning of this? Could it be that Empyrean Chaoyuan can still be Grandmaster Ye’s match?”

“Empyrean Chaoyuan is merely in the Empyrean seats. At the very most, he’s also evenly-matched in strength with the invited grandmasters. What meaning is there to continue competing?”

...

On the plaza, a series of wondering voices came over.

Empyrean Chaoyuan rarely took action. Everyone only knew that he was formidable, but they did not know how impressive he was.

Seeing Empyrean Pilljade inquire, Empyrean Chaoyuan slowly stood up and was just about to speak, but he saw Ye Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and said, “This Ye is a man of his word! This alchemy battle ... will continue! Brother Chaoyuan, please don’t stint in enlightening me with your teachings!”
