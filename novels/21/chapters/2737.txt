Chapter 2743: The Pill Alliance’s True Strength!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and also let out a long sigh in relief.

That corrupt corpse king’s claw had already almost reached his face just now. His life was really hanging by a thread.

He saved everyone on a whim just now, his heart racing from it too.

These were all Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses. It would be such a shame if they died.

“You all are thinking too much, it’s not that I’m not taking prior transgressions to heart. I just feel that you guys are all Saint Sovereign Heavens. It would be such a shame if you died. Better to leave behind a useful body and do something meaningful.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Everyone frowned, hearing Ye Yuan’s overtone.

“Brother Ye seems to know a lot about this Labyrinth Divine Palace?” Saint Exalt Purplesun said.

Along the way, Ye Yuan schemed against them time and again, like he had arrived at his own home.

Especially just now, there were many lamps on this path. Yet, Ye Yuan knew the one that triggered the restriction.

This was somewhat unusual.

Ye Yuan did not hide it either and said coolly, “I can bring you all out, I can also share with you all part of the natural treasures here. In fact, I can even help you all step into middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, even upper Saint Sovereign Heaven! But …”

All the Saint Exalts listened up, their faces full of doubts.

Why did this boy suddenly change his character?

Furthermore, could upper Saint Sovereign Heaven be broken through because you said so?

“Brother Ye, if you have anything to say, just say it,” Saint Exalt Purplesun said with a smile.

Ye Yuan knew that they did not believe it and said coolly, “Do you know why Big Yellow is willing to follow me?”

What else can there be? Because you can refine heavenly imperial pills!

Grade four heavenly imperial pill, the medicinal effect was not weak anymore!

However, while grade four heavenly imperial pills could greatly improve Big Yellow’s strength, it was insufficient to let these people break through to upper Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Everyone smiled and did not speak.

Big Yellow gave a cold snort and said disdainfully, “A bunch of frogs at the bottom of a well! Do you all know that I was still just grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven several years ago? Now, a few years later, which one of you is my match?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The expressions of the Saint Exalt powerhouses changed, all revealing looks of astonishment!

They thought that Big Yellow was originally Saint Sovereign Heaven and that Ye Yuan refining grade four heavenly imperial pills was just superfluous.

They did not expect that Big Yellow this Saint Exalt was actually single-handedly created by Ye Yuan!

This was terrifying!

A Jade Sovereign Heaven that could create Saint Sovereign Heavens at will. This … was a little too monstrous, right?

“Saint Exalt Big Yellow, is this true?” Saint Exalt Waycloud sucked in a breath of cold air and said.

“Huhu,?if Master Ye can only refine ordinary heavenly imperial pills, do you think that this exalt would follow him so willingly?” Big Yellow said.

The moment everyone heard it, they felt that it made sense.

Saint Exalt true spirits were not only proud, but they were also unfriendly towards humans let alone talk about being their mounts.

Furthermore, even if Ye Yuan could refine ordinary heavenly imperial pills, the two of their statuses should be reversed and not Ye Yuan taking the initiative.

This indicated that Ye Yuan’s alchemy path strength was even more formidable than they imagined!

“No need to keep guessing. You all are Saint Exalt powerhouses. You should have heard of true grade before, right?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The moment these words came out, the expressions of the Saint Sovereign Heavens present changed abruptly.

True grade, this was an unfamiliar term in the past.

But, ever since the astonishing great battle that Ye Yuan of Martial Secure Heavenly Sect had with the Pill Alliance’s holy son, Cang Yongning, the name of true grade also spread.

However, this level of heavenly pill was not circulated on the market at all, but monopolized by the Pill Alliance!

In reality, more than a hundred years had passed, not only did the Five Great Heavenly Regions’ various major heavenly sects’ alchemy path strength not improve, it regressed significantly instead.

Because the Pill Alliance’s current monopoly was even more stringent.

Monopolizing heavenly pills was tantamount to controlling the various major heavenly sects’ lifeblood, clutching their throats.

“True grade heavenly pill! Ye Yuan … could it be that you’re … you’re …” Saint Exalt Waycloud suddenly remembered something and looked at Ye Yuan with a look of horror.

The others were not dumb either, linking these two terms together, if they still did not know who Ye Yuan was, then they could really find a piece of tofu to commit suicide with.

When Ye Yuan was ‘killed’ back then, he was still only Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Logically speaking, he was just an unknown junior.

But that was not the case.

Ye Yuan established the Pill Pavilion back then, defeated the holy son, achieved true grade, and stirred up monstrously huge waves in the Five Great Heavenly Regions.

If it were not for this, the Pill Alliance also would not have exterminated the Five Light Heavenly Region with ruthless means.

Others did not know, but how could these Saint Exalts not know?

They just rarely showed their faces in front of people. It did not mean that they really shut themselves away from worldly affairs.

“I heard that the Pill Alliance’s Alliance Chief personally took action and killed you! You … You actually didn’t die?” Saint Exalt Skyfortune had a look of shock too.

“Heh,?how can this Ye die so easily before avenge the great enmity? Rather, it’s you all, these Saint Sovereign Heavens. You became the Pill Alliance’s lackeys so willingly?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Actually, seeing these Saint Sovereign Heavens, Ye Yuan already roughly guessed the Pill Alliance’s strength today.

These Saint Sovereign Heavens that came today were probably already more than half of the Five Great Heavenly Regions’ power.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that the Five Great Heavenly Regions actually had so many hidden Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

However, for the Pill Alliance to be able to suppress so many Saint Sovereign Heavens, their strength could be seen at a glance!

Saying lacking was likely a little too much.

Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were aloof from worldly affairs, the Pill Alliance did not have a big influence on them.

But they did not dare to intervene in sect affairs anymore as well.

Back then, the Pill Alliance destroyed the five great heavenly sects with ruthless means and killed five great veteran Saint Sovereign Heavens, shocking all of the Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

How could they still dare to say a word of dissent?

“Huhu,?Brother Ye, you said it lightly. Do you know how strong the Pill Alliance’s true strength is? Do you know that destroying your five great heavenly sects back then was actually carried out at the same time? And that Alliance Chief who took action to kill your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was merely the alliance chief of the Pill Alliance’s branch!” Saint Sovereign Skyfortune also said with a helpless look.

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s eyes also flickered and he said, “The Pill Alliance’s general alliance’s Li Changsheng, is an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven super powerhouse! According to what I know, the Saint Exalt powerhouses that the Pill Alliance possesses are no less than 20! Do you know that we all, these old undyings added together, also don’t surpass 20? The strongest is also merely middle Saint Sovereign Heaven! What else can we do if we don’t be lackeys?”

Ye Yuan also drew a cold breath as he listened.

It was still his first time learning about the Pill Alliance’s true strength.

He originally thought that he already survived well enough in Heavenly South and the Myriad Demons Mountain, and returning to destroy the Pill Alliance would not be a problem.

He did not expect that the Pill Alliance’s general alliance was actually an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven super powerhouse!

This way, it was really a little troublesome.

However, even if it was an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven, it was impossible to make him give up on revenge too.

No powerhouse, then he would create a powerhouse!

After a moment of silence, Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “Right now, the Pill Alliance has monopolized all of the alchemy resources, their Saint Sovereign Heavens will get stronger and stronger. But you all can only rush ahead into danger and come to this kind of dangerous place.. When one aspect was weaker, the others would be stronger. In less than a thousand years, the Rainclear Continent won’t have any other heavenly sects! Could it be that you all are willing?”
