1499 Attaining the Acme of Perfection, Drawing Parallels From Inference!

“Haha, with this bit of strength, he also dares to challenge His Highness Ka Xin! Really tired of living!”

“Ignorant fool! Now, he knows the strength of the King of Blood Battle, right?”

“Hey, is he dead? Not dead, quickly stand up and carry on letting His Highness Ka Xin abuse!”

...

On the stand, a wave of intense cheering erupted.

No one had sympathy for Ye Yuan.

On the Blood Battle Stage, only the victor would obtain applause and admiration. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Losers, no one had sympathy!

In their view, Ye Yuan challenging His Highness Ka Xin was totally overestimating his own ability.

Bloodeagle secretly heaved a sigh in relief. He was nervous just now until his palm broke out in a sweat, thinking that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually pulled through.

“Heh, this kid has such incredible insight! A little bit later and he’d be defeated,” Bloodeagle said.

You Ming said, “Breaking the fist momentum at the risk of getting injured, this kid is still very daring and resolute. It’s just that, the speed which he relies on to face his enemies is utterly restricted. Truly can’t see the chances of winning!”

At this time, You Ming already fully confirmed that that packet of powder indeed did not affect Ka Xin’s strength. Then what on earth was its effect?

Ye Yuan racked his brains, could it be that it was doing pointless endeavors?

“Don’t you still have an even faster move? Why didn’t you use it? Heh heh, let me see just how fast you are,” Ka Xin said with a satisfied look.

Ye Yuan secretly revolved the Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art to recover his injuries. A cold light appeared in his eyes and he said in a cold voice, “As you wish!”

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared.

Those on the grandstands whose strength did not reach Fiend Commander Realm could not see Ye Yuan’s shadow at all.

It was as if Ye Yuan disappeared into thin air!

“Where is he? Why is he gone?”

“Could it be fast until we can’t see? This ... is also too fast, right?!”

“A high-rank Fiend General can actually be swift to this kind of degree? No wonder he dared to challenge His Highness Ka Xin. He really has some ability!”

“Heh, it’s no use! The King of Blood Battle is undefeatable! This kid is hard-pressed to escape death!”

...

When Ka Xin saw this scene, his expression could not help turning intent!

Even faster!

Compared to facing off with Starshine they all the last time, the speed of Ye Yuan’s Phantom Kill move was much faster again!

Last time, he could still see Ye Yuan’s figure clearly. But this time, with his visual prowess, he actually only saw a blurry shadow.

How could the improvement be so great in a year’s time?

Not only breaking through a minor realm, the power of laws even improved further too!

The Blood Battle Stage’s grandstands actually had a total of three levels.

However, the third level’s grandstand was never open to the public.

This was a secret room. The outside world could not perceive it at all.

Inside this room, a man and a woman, two figures, were currently staring at the ring below.

The woman was very beautiful. Even if just standing there, she gave people a bewitching sensation.

If Ye Yuan was here, he would be able to recognize that this woman was precisely the Yi Han who received him at the Hundred Knows Hall!

When Yi Han saw Ye Yuan use Phantom Kill, a trace of amazement was revealed in her gaze, and she said to the man beside her: “What terrifying talent. He actually drew parallels from inference, comprehending spatial laws through Sword Dao laws!”

The man’s face also revealed a shocked expression and said, “No wonder he can be selected by you. This boy’s talent is indeed astonishing! Drawing parallels from inference, this requires one’s utilization of Sword Dao laws to reach the acme of perfection before they can accomplish it. His power of laws isn’t strong. What is strong lies with putting it to use!”

When people cultivated the power of laws, they only knew to cultivate the strength of the power of laws. But extremely few people practiced application of the power of laws.

No matter how strong the power of laws, if one did not know how to apply it, it was like a child swinging a broadsword; unable to unleash the true might of the power of laws.

The way of application was similarly divided into realms: first glimpse at the door, achieving mastery through comprehensive study, unity of mind, as well as the most fleeting and ephemeral, acme of perfection[1]!

Ye Yuan had always been able to defeat the strong as the weak. The reason lied in his realm of application.

To the vast majority of martial artists, they pursued the realm of laws blindly but neglected the application of laws. Hence, they stopped at the first glimpse at the door.

A minority of martial artists who fought in more actual combats, they could reach the realm of achieving mastery through comprehensive study.

An extremely small portion of the people was able to cultivate to the extent of unity of mind through countless battles.

As for the realm of acme of perfection, those who could reach it were like feathers of a phoenix and the horn of a Qilin.

On one hand, it hinged on talent. On the other hand, it also depended on how much a person’s actual combat experience was.

Of course, very few people spent their energy to go and practice the way of application. Because this required expending a large amount of time, with the losses outweighing the gains.

Once they missed the golden period of cultivation, it would be very hard for their realm to want to break through.

When Ye Yuan was at the Sword Tomb, he could be said to have been subjected to all kinds of torment before he comprehended Sword Dao laws. Not because he was a masochist, but because he was experiencing each sword’s true essence, experiencing the way of application!

Therefore, he was able to trigger the resonance of all of the swords!

Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao laws power advanced very slowly. Not because his comprehension was poor, but because he spent a great deal of time on the way of application.

Leaving the Sword Tomb, Ye Yuan currently had the Death Cultivation Space.

There, he could feel the inadequacies of his sword art even more distinctly.

For him to be able to kill his way out of the Death Cultivation Space time after time and never failing, what it relied on was not a fluke.

After Ye Yuan broke through to late-stage Heaven Glimpse and entered the Death Cultivation Space several times, he finally trained the way of application to the acme of perfection realm.

And this time, during the time Ye Yuan was in the Death Cultivation Space, when he urged Phantom Kill to the limits, his mind suddenly became more agile as luck hit, comprehending a trace of spatial law power!

After this trace of spatial law power merged into his movement technique, it made Phantom Kill this move become even more illusionary and abstruse.

Even with Ka Xin’s strength, he found it hard to capture his figure.

Ka Xin’s expression changed. He discovered that he actually could not keep up with Ye Yuan’s speed anymore!

He only said a sentence provocatively just now, wanting Ye Yuan to exhibit Phantom Kill, but did not expect that what he saw was actually the Phantom Kill after evolution!

“Brahma True Fiend Dharma Idol! Protect me!”

Ka Xin gave a fierce cry, his fiendish energy surging. A true fiend dharma idol condensed behind him!

The true fiend dharma idol lied prostrated on the ground and actually protected Ka Xin’s entire person firmly in the middle.

Then the entire space exploded!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Everyone could only see Ye Yuan’s figure and only saw that the true fiend dharma idol’s body was bombarded countless times within an extremely short time!

Bang!

Following a huge bang, the true fiend dharma idol dissipated with a loud bang. Ka Xin’s body flew out backward.

While at this time, Ye Yuan’s figure also revealed himself, appearing rather ragged.

Although his realm broke through, Phantom Kill’s power became greater. The consumption of divine essence also became much greater.

It was also just him. If it were others, they were completely unable to support Phantom Kill this move while being in the same realm.

On the grandstands, it was deathly quiet.

They were all stunned by this scene!

Their King of Blood Battle was actually struck flying by someone?

Furthermore, the one who sent him flying was merely just a high-rank Fiend General!

In Capone Capital City, nobody had ever thought that they could jump realms to defeat Ka Xin before.

But Ye Yuan did it!
