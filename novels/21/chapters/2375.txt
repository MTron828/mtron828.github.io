Chapter 2381: All Parties Alarmed!

“We’re not going anywhere, we’ll wait right here for Senior to arrive.” Qin Chao said calmly.

The expressions of the group of sect masters immediately became embarrassed to the extreme.

If that senior came, slaughtering all of them in his unhappiness was nothing difficult too!

One had to know, even Originbright that kind of powerhouse, failed to keep Ye Yuan back.

Furthermore, looking at the ruthlessness of Ye Yuan’s actions, he would not mind slaughtering all of them.

An emaciated sect master said with a pitiful expression, “Goodness gracious, my little ancestor, don’t throw a tantrum anymore! This old man knows that we’ve offended you guys badly this time, take pity on us, these old bones!”

Mo Qingshan looked at these sect masters with a look of surprise. It was as if it was his first time knowing them.

These people normally all had their eyes growing on top of their heads. Apart from the divine race, they paid no attention to anyone.

Now, they actually became this sycophantic appearance.

Qin Chao suddenly sighed and said, “Senior said, pitiable people must have hateful aspects! If our human race can be united, why would we be bullied by the divine race until like this? The population of all the races added up is more than 100 thousand times that of the divine race! Even if we used numbers to pile, we’d pile them to death too!”

When the sect masters heard this, they all exchanged glances.

While that was true, just the population of the human race was as many as billions of trillions. How could it be easy to talk about uniting?

“Nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it! I’m not making you all go and court death, just letting you all know that being a human ... is much more interesting than being a pig or dog!”

Suddenly, a voice sounded out faintly. A youth in white clothes walked out of the void.

The expressions of the group of sect masters changed wildly, already guessing who the arrival was.

There were many powerful array formations guarding inside this dungeon. They were actually completely clueless when this young man entered!

This shock was by no means insignificant!

Originally, they had only heard rumors about Ye Yuan’s strength.

But seeing it with their own eyes currently, it really shocked them.

Just based on this kind of means, it was effortless for Ye Yuan to kill them! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When Qin Chao saw Ye Yuan, he had an excited look on his face and said in pleasant surprise, “Senior! You barged into the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace alone and awed the southern border, bolstering our human race’s prestige, truly awe-inspiring!”

Although he was very confident in Ye Yuan, when he heard about Ye Yuan’s deeds, he was still extremely carried away.

That impressive sight, how great would it have been if he was present!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That was me taking by surprise, going too suddenly. They were not prepared, that’s why it was like this. If they were prepared, I probably won’t be able to come back anymore. Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm is indeed powerful!”

Don’t look at how Ye Yuan came and went like the wind, Ye Yuan was still incredibly shocked having witnessed Originbright’s strength.

Back then, he was almost killed by Originguard. At that time, he did not even have the strength to fight back and was also unable to experience the might of a Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm.

Now, he comprehended three great sources, his strength virtually invincible in Heavenly Emperor Realm.

Only at this time could he truly understand the prowess of a Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm.

If under the circumstances where the other party was prepared, even if he unleashed his sources simultaneously, it would probably be hard to escape too.

However, Ye Yuan mentioned it casually, but it was completely not the case at all when the sect masters present heard it.

The might of Nine-mark Heavenly Dao Realms did not need Ye Yuan to explain at all.

That was an existence that they could not understand!

But Ye Yuan leisurely circled one round right under the eyelids of an incomprehensible existence and casually killed a few people.

How could they imagine this kind of means?

“Y-Your Excellency, we have no intention of being enemies with you. Your Excellency, please lift your hand high up in mercy and let us go!” Wu Tianqiao said sobbingly and had long lost his majesty back then.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you all killed Qin Chao, I’d definitely have slaughtered your entire sects! But since he’s unharmed, I’ll let you guys off! However ... if any one of you dares to be an accessory to a tyrant’s crimes, and help the divine race to bully your race, I’ll kill once when I see once!”

Hearing this, the large rock in the hearts of the group of sect masters landed.

Fortunately, this lord was not a demon lord who killed people without blinking.

... ...

Puff!

In an extremely secret underground palace, a middle-aged man suddenly vomited blood, his entire person becoming dispirited and inert.

By the side, a white-haired old man asked, “Profound Secrets, still can’t divine it?”

The middle-aged man shook his head and smiled bitterly, and said, “This child’s secrets are too vague as if it isn’t in the operation of Heavenly Dao at all! This kind of character, it’s still my first time encountering! Witchcloud, this boy may be the key to our peerless genius plan’s success. We must find him!”

Witchcloud said in surprise, “You’re actually so optimistic about him?”

The middle-aged man’s gaze was deep as he said, “Have you heard before any human Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor who can escape from under the hands of a Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm’s subordinate? Furthermore, Originbright isn’t an ordinary Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm. With his strength, ten Deva Third Blights are not a match either!”

Witchcloud nodded and said, “This boy is indeed too monstrous! But logically speaking, such a terrifying talent, he should have been discovered by us long ago. Why did he suddenly pop up now? I feel like he jumped out of thin air!”

The middle-aged man nodded his head and said, “You’re right! I’ve always been paying attention to the operation of Heavenly Dao. But ever since several months ago, Heavenly Dao seemed to suddenly have a trace of deviation and fluctuation! This trace of fluctuation is extremely minute. I believe that with Miluo’s ability, he can’t detect it yet! It’s also precisely after that, that this monstrous fellow suddenly appeared! If this is a coincidence, it’s also too coincidental!”

Witchcloud had a look of shock and said, “There’s actually such a thing! Such a major thing, why did you only say it now?”

The middle-aged man smiled and said, “If not for the thing he did this time being too heaven-shocking, how could I have taken notice of him? How can the unpredictableness of Heavenly Dao be what ordinary people can surmise?”

Witchcloud thought about it and felt the same. That kid remained in obscurity previously. If not for challenging the Sentry Celestial Palace by himself and warning the divine race, stirring up a monstrous wave.

How could they have paid attention to a measly little Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor?

The middle-aged man said, “The matter brooks no delay! This matter is no trivial matter, I must make a trip in person. I’ll leave ‘Deicide’ to you!”

Witchcloud nodded and said, “Relax, we’ve almost entered orbit already. With me around, there won’t be any problems!”

... ...

At the same time, inside the divine race’s highest ruling institution, Titan Palace, an old man with white eyebrows was similarly vomiting fresh blood wildly.

Beside him, a robust middle-aged man said with a dark expression, “Celestial Master, even you can’t divine this kid too?”

Miluo shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “Lord Tian Qing, it’s as if this boy is outside of the Five Elements, jumping out of the Three Realms. I’m unable to divine at all! It’s still Miluo’s first time encountering such an unpredictable person! As if ... he appeared out of thin air!”

The robust middle-aged man beside Celestial Master Miluo was the divine race’s Heaven Lineage’s progenitor, the divine race’s most terrifying existence: Tian Qing!

They were similarly divining Ye Yuan.

But even Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets could not divine him. So let alone Miluo?

Hearing what Miluo said, Tian Qing’s brows furrowed even harder and he said in a deep voice, “Heavenly Dao has always been under our control. But now, an unpredictable person appeared. This boy must be eliminated! Inform all Sentry Celestial Palaces! They must find this kid’s tracks at all costs!”
