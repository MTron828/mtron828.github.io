Chapter 2214: Just Running an Errand

Ye Yuan’s words made the minds of Heavenly Eagle’s people tremble!

His Excellency was still so domineering when speaking!

No idea why, those words coming out of Ye Yuan’s mouth were so convincing.

Even if he was currently just a cripple.

“With you around, Heavenly Eagle is safe and sound? Hahaha ... really making this Empyrean die of laughter! A cripple who doesn’t even have divine essence actually dares to say this sort of boast!” Empyrean Pilljade laughed loudly and said.

The big shots on the Southern Border Alliance’s side also all shook their heads one after another and could not help laughing.

A trash who did not even have divine essence, why would they take notice of him?

But Ye Yuan completely ignored Empyrean Pilljade. With a flick of his fingertips, a pale-yellow line appeared between the two main camps. It was as if a line was drawn in the sky.

“Those who cross the line will be killed without mercy!” Ye Yuan’s nonchalant words came out, appearing somewhat careless.

With this, the Southern Border Alliance’s side ridiculed even harder.

“Hahaha, a cripple actually dares to utter this kind of shameless boasting! Everyone, attack for me! I want to see how a cripple can kill us without mercy!” Empyrean Proudcloud jumped around the happiest, bringing a bunch of subordinates and rushing over.

“Wanting to block the entire Southern Border Alliance by drawing a line, you, this cripple, are also overestimating your own ability too much!”

“Everybody attack together! See how this cripple kills without mercy!”

... ...

Quite a number of Empyreans completely turned their noses up at Ye Yuan’s threat and brought a large group of people, directly charging over.

When Pilljade saw this scene, he could not help sneering coldly.

Although he was being restrained by Empyrean Chaoyuan, both side’s combat strengths were not on the same level at all.

Ye Yuan’s actions were purely messing around.

The expressions on Heavenly Eagle’s side changed, Bai Tong and the rest were about to rush over. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

But Ye Yuan turned around and said coolly, “All back down!”

Everyone’s faces changed, stopping one after another.

Soon, the Southern Border Alliance army broke through that line Ye Yuan drew.

Proudcloud took the lead and said with a cold smile, “Brat, this Empyrean broke through this line now, what can you do to me? Today, this Empyrean is going to ...”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s fingers snapped lightly, and he said indifferently, “Hundred Schools of Thoughts Nine Profound Heaven Subduing Grand Array, kill!”

Above the void, streaks of golden light lit up, slicing space into pieces like countless blades.

Empyrean Proudcloud’s words were said halfway when suddenly, his whole body was torn apart!

He could not talk anymore.

The Third Firmament Empyrean, Empyrean Proudcloud, died!

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s sky, miserable cries suddenly sounded out. The dead bodies of countless powerhouses fell down in succession.

Powerhouses that crossed that yellow line all died.

In virtually an instant, the Southern Border Alliance’s side suffered heavy casualties.

Those powerhouses who had not crossed the line yet turned pale with fright and stopped one after another. How could they still dare to advance?

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan with horrified faces, as if they had seen a malefic star.

In a short dozen over breaths, there were thousands of Empyreans and True Gods that fell.

However, they did not even know how they died!

Empyrean Pilljade’s pupils constricted, a pair of eyes glued on Ye Yuan, full of shock.

Array formation!

In an instant, Ye Yuan laid down an enormous array formation above the void.

Those who entered this array formation were all garroted!

The problem was, even he, this Ninth Firmament Empyrean mighty expert, actually could not tell how Ye Yuan laid down the formation too!

When did this boy’s array formation attainments become so powerful too?

Forget about True God Realms, Empyrean Proudcloud was a Third Firmament Empyrean mighty expert, he was actually dismembered like chopping vegetables just like that!

How great was the power of this array formation?

It was deathly silent above the void. No one dared to underestimate Ye Yuan this cripple anymore.

While the Southern Border Alliance army also all stopped before the yellow line. No one dared to take half a step over the line anymore!

Empyrean Chaoyuan looked toward Empyrean Pilljade with a strange look and said with a cold smile, “Cripple? Huhu, Pilljade, your eyesight is as poor as before!”

“Lord Ye Yuan is mighty!”

“Lord Ye Yuan is mighty!”

... ...

When Heavenly Eagle’s subjects saw this scene, each and every one of them started shouting madly with excitement.

Even without divine essence, His Excellency’s invincible might still could not be violated!

Empyrean Pilljade burned with fury. Clenching his jaws tightly, he shouted angrily, “Ye Yuan punk! This Empyrean wants to see how many tricks you have! Southern Border Alliance, heed my command! All Empyrean powerhouses, attack together! Annihilate Heavenly Eagle!”

No matter how strong Ye Yuan’s array formation was, it was also impossible to block late-stage Empyrean powerhouses.

Those grandmasters were all late-stage Empyrean mighty experts. It was simply nothing more than wishful thinking for a mere array formation to want to block them.

Empyrean Windrider and those grandmaster powerhouses were aware that they could no longer look on with folded arms.

None of them thought that this act today would actually be forced into such a plight.

But the arrow was notched and already had no choice but to release.

Not taking down Heavenly Eagle today, there would no longer be the Southern Border Alliance in the future.

Therefore, Ye Yuan had to die!

More than ten late-stage Empyrean super powerhouses moving out, how shocking was the commotion?

Let alone that there were even several dozen Empyreans behind them!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Gentlemen, listen to this Ye’s word of advice! Withdraw now and everything can still be discussed. Crossing this line, that’s becoming this Ye’s mortal enemy! From this day forth, irreconcilable till death!”

Empyrean Pilljade burst out laughing when he heard that and said, “From this day forth? How are you going to have any day after today! Boy, this Empyrean knows that you’re some bullshit Second Sage, but that’s the demon race’s title, are you planning on bringing it to the human race to threaten us? Let me tell you, today, no matter who comes, you can’t be saved either!”

“Oh? Is that so?”

Empyrean Pilljade’s voice had yet to fade when a figure slowly walked out of the void.

The moment this person appeared, the faces of Empyrean Pilljade and the rest of the powerhouses changed one after another.

What a terrifying aura!

This person gave them an unfathomable feeling.

Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

Empyrean Pilljade’s pupils constricted and he said in a solemn voice, “No matter who your esteemed self is, Heavenly Emperor powerhouses are not to interfere in worldly affairs! Let alone that you’re even a demon Heavenly Emperor! Could it be that you’re planning on making a move against us at the risk of universal condemnation?”

The demonic aura on the other party’s body billowed to the sky. How could Empyrean Pilljade not recognize?

He already roughly guessed the other person’s identity. It was just that he paid no attention to it.

Forget about the demon race’s Heavenly Emperor, even if Sacred Ancestor High Priest came in person, he also would not dare to behave atrociously in the human race’s territory!

Heavenly Emperors were not to intervene in worldly affairs. This was the unspoken rule that all Heavenly Emperors abided by.

Moreover, a demon race’s major power running to the human race territory to kill people, once this sort of thing happens, things would blow up.

The Heavenly Emperor powerhouse stood with his hands behind his back as he said coolly, “This emperor is Stardrive under Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s command. I only came over to run an errand. You all don’t have to make a big fuss.”

The moment these words came out, everyone sucked in a cold breath.

High Priest Stardrive!

Those present were mostly involved in alchemy. So how could they not know High Priest Stardrive’s reputation.

This was one of the 11 disciples under Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s command!

Hang on, what did he say just now?

Run an errand?

What kind of figure was High Priest Stardrive? Who had this qualification to be able to make him run an errand?

Suddenly, everyone’s gazes shifted to Ye Yuan, being incredibly shocked!
