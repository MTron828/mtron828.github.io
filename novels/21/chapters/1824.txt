Chapter 1828 Deadly Blow

Just one move!Really only used one move!

No fierce counterattacks, and no flashy exaggerated martial techniques.

What they saw was just a light finger action.

The various major sects’ disciples were all staring dumbfoundedly, looking at this scene in disbelief.

He Yuan’s grandiose and heroic words from before immediately became brainless clamoring at this moment.

Was the High Clarity Sect very strong?

These words that seemed very comical previously was affirmed by Ye Yuan with strength.

The High Clarity Sect was very weak!

The big commotion that He Yuan made appeared too boastful in front of Ye Yuan’s casualness.

Ye Yuan looked at He Yuan who fell to the ground coolly and said, “Your wrath is so weak. I still have things to do, leaving first.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s figure moved, disappearing from the ring, only leaving behind the dumbfounded looking people.

“This kid is so strong!”

“Is he really only No. 64? Could it be that the Profound Realm Tablet made a mistake?”

“Defeating He Yuan with one move, probably not many people can do that, right?”

...

Below the stage, Yang Shen’s expression was very ugly.

Ye Yuan’s played down finger smacked the High Clarity Sect’s face resoundingly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

During the past ten thousand years, the High Clarity Sect had never been defeated so embarrassingly before.

Today, He Yuan did it.

“Li Yiping, the next match is you, right? You have to win back this face!” Yang Shen said with a dark look.

The expression of a youth with short hair behind him turned somber and he said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Yang, rest assured. No matter how strong he is, it’s also impossible to be my match!”

This Li Yiping was ranked fifth among the High Clarity Sect’s eight disciples, a middle-stage Second Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse.

Compared to He Yuan, he was no idea how much stronger.

The High Clarity Sect had no weaklings, this was not said for fun.

Even if rank fifth, Li Yiping’s strength did not pale in comparison to other sects’ number one and number two.

Therefore, he dared to make this big boast.

...

Inside the pill refining room, when Little Tong saw Ye Yuan return, he revealed a slight look of surprise.

“Faster than I expected!” Little Tong said.

The Treasure Pig who was originally sleeping flew up with a whoosh and bored right into Ye Yuan’s bossom, wriggling its pig-head continuously.

Little Tong’s face fell, and he said with a cold snort, “You stupid pig, only know how to eat!”

Treasure Pig poked his head out of Ye Yuan’s bosom and made a funny face at Little Tong.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That guy was too weak. I defeated him in one move, so it’s not worth talking about.”

Little Tong’s pupils constricted slightly, somewhat surprised at Ye Yuan’s strength.

But very soon, he became totally indifferent to this and said coolly, “The spirit medicines are already all prepared, you can start refining pills.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Haha, many thanks. Didn’t expect that you, this brat, is still pretty useful.”

Little Tong’s face turned back and instantly wanted to explode, but at the thought of how he could not beat Ye Yuan, he was immediately like a deflated ball.

“Damn brat, when this empyrean recovers his strength, you will see. I’ll definitely beat you until your buttocks open up!”

Ye Yuan felt that Little Tong was bored and idle. Hence, he had him help sort out the spirit medicines and do some preparation work before refining pills.

He did not expect that Little Tong did the work in this area extremely meticulously.

Since Ye Yuan entered the Heavenspan World, it was still his first time encountering.

Hence, he guessed that this Little Tong’s grandpa must be an extremely formidable alchemist.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan discovered that Little Tong’s insight in Alchemy Dao was extremely deep.

Occasionally chatting gave Ye Yuan a feeling of suddenly seeing the light. This made Ye Yuan give rise to the idea of meeting Little Tong’s grandpa.

The moment Ye Yuan refined pills, he thoroughly forgot about time.

All the way until three days later, Ye Yuan’s pill refinement was interrupted by Xu Yan.

“What’s wrong, Elder Xu?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

He said before that without special circumstances, don’t interrupt his pill refinement.

With Xu Yan coming to find him, something must have happened.

Xu Yan’s expression was very ugly and he said to Ye Yuan, “You go and take a look at Yi Qingxiang, he probably can’t take part in the competition at the back anymore. If there wasn’t any choice, I also wouldn’t come find you.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, having a foreboding premonition in his heart, and said with a nod, “Okay, I’ll go take a look.”

Yi Qingxiang was carried back. When Ye Yuan saw the Yi Qingxiang on the bed, he also felt somewhat unbearable to look straight at him.

Yi Qingxiang was brutalized too dreadfully. His entire being was beaten out of shape.

Especially the face, his eyes were beaten until they popped out, virtually unable to recognize his original appearance anymore.

This degree of injury would basically bid farewell to the competition at the back already.

According to normal circumstances, without eight to ten years, it was likely very hard to recover.

His brows furrowed and he asked Xu Yan, “Was it done by High Clarity Sect’s people?”

No need to think, it must have been that High Clarity Sect’s people felt that it was a loss of face, and deliberately gained back some ground from Yi Qingxiang.

Except, the attack was a bit too vicious.

Under such fierce battles that lasted for a long time, knowing how to protect oneself was also a kind of strategy.

Under normal circumstances, when one saw that the situation was beyond salvage, they would admit defeat.

But very clearly, the other party did not give him the chance to concede.

Xu Yan said angrily, “Yi Qingxiang was unlucky too. He ran into High Clarity Sect’s disciples this time as well, it was the Bian Ziqiu, ranked fourth among them. There’s a great disparity between the two of their strengths. Yi Qingxiang wasn’t a match to begin with. Who knew that that punk took advantage of Yi Qingxiang inattentiveness the moment he came up and immediately removed his lower jaw, making him unable to even speak. Following that, Bian Ziqiu pummeled Yi Qingxiang wildly in the ring. If not for this kid was smart, he would already be a dead man now.”

The Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave did not forbid killing. If there was no chance to admit defeat, dying on the stage was not impossible too.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed, shooting out two rays of cold light.

High Clarity Sect this bunch of fellows was seriously too much.

Although he and Yi Qingxiang had some grudges, he was different from Qian Ye. Ye Yuan did not have a direct conflict with him.

Now, Yi Qingxiang did not dare to do anything to him too.

High Clarity Sect doing so was simply aiming for him, Ye Yuan.

Yi Qingxiang was merely an innocent bystander who was implicated.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that these guys actually dealt a deadly blow to Yi Qingxiang for so-called face.

At this time, Ye Yuan’s fury was really stoked.

Ye Yuan said in a low voice, “Relax, with me around, he can’t die! The next match, he’ll also take the field.”

The moment Xu Yan heard this, his eyes revealed a trace of surprise.

He had never seen before what kind of alchemist could cure such heavy injuries within a few days.

Since entering Upper Groove Court, Ye Yuan had been fiddling about in the pill refining room every day. Just how strong his Alchemy Dao strength was, Xu Yan completely did not know as well.

“Senior Apprentice Sister Baili, Senior Apprentice Sister Jiang, when you guys run into High Clarity Sect’s Second Firmament Celestial Deity disciples in the future, best to concede defeat straight away. Otherwise, they might deal a deadly blow to you guys too!” Ye Yuan said to the two in a solemn voice.

Jiang Xueyan’s face changed, revealing a look of fear.

But Baili Qingyan was incomparably indignant and said in a cold voice, “Impossible! I want to see how strong High Clarity Sect’s disciples are!”

Seeing Baili Qingyan’s resolute look, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, knowing that he could not persuade her, and could only say: “Alright then, but you have to be careful yourself!”
