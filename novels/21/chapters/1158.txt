Chapter 1162: Bedevilment!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Monstrous killing intent surged to the sky.

Ye Yuan’s eyes actually became a blood-red color.

This killing intent, even inside Bright Moon City, it could be felt clearly.

A dense crowd of martial artists flew out from inside Bright Moon City.

Very clearly, they were all startled by Ye Yuan’s killing intent.

“Kill!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes were scarlet. Sensing those experts who flew over, his figure vanished from sight in an instant!

When he reappeared, there were already several figures who dropped down from the sky.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The current Ye Yuan was like a killing machine.

Places that he passed through, not a blade of grass survived!

Regardless whether was it the Vastsun City’s powerhouses or that mysterious Divine Martial Hall’s martial artists, not one survived!

Ye Yuan’s killing intent virtually materialized! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

His formidable strength practically made everyone despair.

Whatever Dao Profound Realm martial artists or Divine King powerhouses, even Void Mystic powerhouses could not last past one second under Ye Yuan’s hands!

Seeing such an astonishing spectacle, how could those people still dare to remain?

Arriving with a fierce and imposing momentum, fleeing in a wretched plight!

“Don’t kill me! Ahh!”

“Quickly run! Ji Qingyun went mad!”

“Devil! This is a devil! Quickly run!”

...

For some time, miserable cries lingered on the ears!

The entire sky became a field of carnage.

No matter how fast they ran, how could they be faster than Ye Yuan’s sword?

The more he killed, the redder Ye Yuan’s eyes got.

Gradually, he actually already lost his original heart!

Two figures soared to the sky and actually acted in contravention, welcoming Ye Yuan.

One of them had fiendish energy billowing into the sky. His strength was very formidable at one glance.

“Lord Bloodrain, looks like this Ye Yuan seems to have entered bedevilment!”

The one talking was precisely Zhou Jia.

When he saw Ye Yuan’s appearance of crazed slaughtering, he felt the delight of rejoicing over other people’s misfortune instead.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil was acquired by Ye Yuan. How could Zhou Jia not hate him?

Bloodrain smiled lightly and said, “Looks like Lord Holy Son’s scheme is very effective! This Ji Qingyun indeed fell into madness when he heard news of the Yue Family’s lass’s demise.”

Zhou Jia hurriedly fawned as he said, “Haha, Lord Holy Son truly took every conceivable possibility into account! No matter how strong Ji Qingyun is, he’s a cripple after entering bedevilment too! Hahaha ... Kill, kill away! The more you kill, the deeper you’ll lose yourself. We prepared sufficient baits for you. When you kill finish, you’ll become a walking corpse that only knows slaughter!”

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Bloodrain’s mouth, looking towards Ye Yuan rather interestedly.

Puchi!

A streak of bloodlight flashed past. The first person to escape back was directly killed by Bloodrain.

“Deserters in the battlefield, die!” Bloodrain’s cold voice sounded out, making everyone’s heart turn cold.

“He’s only one person. Everybody attack, kill him! This is your only way out!” Bloodrain said coldly.

Everyone’s heart turned cold. Front and back, both were death!

Lord Bloodrain’s strength, they were very clear.

While over there, it was just Ye Yuan alone!

In an instant, everyone’s eyes turned red. Countless figures charged over towards Ye Yuan.

However, all of the struggles were futile.

Under Ye Yuan’s hands, they did not have the least bit of strength to retaliate!

Zhou Jia was still watching Ye Yuan kill people with a broad grin. But to the back, the expression on his face became increasingly solemn.

Ye Yuan was too strong!

“This ... Just how long has it been? How can his strength be terrifying to such a degree?” Zhou Jia’s complexion was white as a sheet as he said in shock.

Bloodrain swept a glance over him and said with a cold smile, “What? Scared?”

Zhou Jia was startled inwardly, his expression ugly as he said, “H-How can that be possible?”

Swish!

Just as they were talking, a streak of terrifying sword energy whistled past, directly slaughtering a large swathe.

Force wind swept past, scaring Zhou Jia until he shuddered.

Zhou Jia looked at Ye Yuan with incomparable terror and alarm. He seriously could not figure out how that youth could grow to such an extent.

“Relax. With me around, he can’t hurt you!” Bloodrain said fully confident.

Actually, he looked down on Zhou Jia from the bottom of his heart. It was just that he still had some use right now. That was why he did not kill him.

Only when he heard Bloodrain’s words did Zhou Jia loosen up considerably.

...

Inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda, it was long in utter disarray already.

“M-Milord entered bedevilment! At this rate, Milord will thoroughly lose himself!” Ao Qian said incredibly worriedly.

“What to do here? Without Milord’s permission, we can’t go out at all!” Jiang Taicang also had a panicked look.

Lu-er did not speak by the side. But the worried expression on her face betrayed her.

“Oh, right, Elder Teng! Elder Teng is the Vast Heaven Pagoda’s artifact spirit! He must have a way!” Ao Qian suddenly thought of something and shouted.

Right at this time, Long Teng’s figure materialized.

The moment he came out, everyone crowded over.

“Elder Teng, quickly think of a way!”

“Yeah, Elder Teng, hurry and think of a way. At this rate, His Excellency will be a goner!”

Everyone clamored to speak, all burning with anxiety.

Long Teng waved his hand and said, “You guys can’t go out now! He’ll kill you guys together! Moreover, even if you all go out, it’s useless too!”

“Then ... Then what should we do?” Jiang Taicang said anxiously.

Long Teng’s gaze turned towards Lu-er. Then, everyone’s gazes looked towards her.

“Lu-er?”

“That’s right! Apart from her, nobody can save Ye Yuan here! Only she can stir up the soft spot in the deepest part of Ye Yuan’s soul! However ... there’s a possibility of failure too! And the price of failure is death! At that time, not only will Lu-er, you, die, Ye Yuan will utterly enter bedevilment too, never to awaken again! Lu-er, are you ... willing to give it a try?” Long Teng said with a serious expression.

Clearly, he was also not very confident.

But, the matters between Ye Yuan and Lu-er, he was still aware.

Ye Yuan walking from the Endless World until now, if talking about who was the person he was closest to, it had to be Lu-er!

Only the person that he was closest to could rouse Ye Yuan, who currently entered bedevilment.

The moment Lu-er heard, she said without hesitation, “Grandpa Long Teng, let me out then! Even if I die under Young Master’s sword, I’ll have no regrets too!”

Long Teng let out a sigh and said with a nod, “Alright, but right now ... isn’t the time yet!”

...

The Ye Yuan with two bloodshot eyes finally detected Zhou Jia this existence!

The moment his two eyes turned back, Zhou Jia’s entire person almost shrunk, as if there was a feeling of being stared at by the god of death!

When Bloodrain saw this scene, he could not help sneering coldly.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure instantly vanished from sight!

Greater teleportation!

However, Bloodrain captured Ye Yuan’s trail!

Boom!

An intense collision. It actually directly blasted Ye Yuan back.

However, Ye Yuan was not discouraged. Instead, he seemed to become even more berserk.

His target was Zhou Jia!

Because in his subconscious, Zhou Jia should know Li-er’s whereabouts.

Regardless of whether alive or dead!

Even though Ye Yuan entered bedevilment, his combat instincts were still there.

Bloodrain’s strength was indeed formidable. It was even a notch above Han Qing Zi!

But this time, Ye Yuan’s Domain of Sword opened up!

Chiii!

A rain of blood scattered everywhere!

The insufferably arrogant Bloodrain was actually killed in one exchange!
