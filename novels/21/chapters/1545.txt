Chapter 1549 Slightly Larger An

When the spiritual energy completely dissipated, the aura on Huang Qian’s body already became stronger.

Although he was still unconscious, everyone knew that he was already saved.

“This ... He can also break through while asleep. Why doesn’t this kind of good thing happen to me?”

“Screw off! This is thanks to Master Ye’s medicinal pill! This is cleansing the marrow, letting that boy cast off his old self and be reborn anew.”

“This medicinal pill is really too heaven-defying! Not only can it cure poison, but it can also actually help him break through! These 50 million divine essence stones are definitely worth the money!”

...

Right at this time, Huang Qian slowly opened his eyes.

“Second Uncle? I ... What’s wrong with me?” Huang Qian said with a dazed look.

Huang Haoran had a broad smile on his face and said, “Qian-er, you quickly check if there is still anything off with your body?”

Huang Qian was uncertain what it meant, but still complied with his words and checked, and said with a frown, “It’s ... It’s not right!”

Huang Haoran’s expression changed and he said anxiously, “What? What’s wrong?”

With Huang Qian saying so, the rest also became nervous.

Especially Ding Song and the rest, each and every one of them were inexplicably delighted, perking their ears up.

“I ... I feel that I seemed to have been remolded anew! The speed of absorbing spiritual energy is much faster than in the past! My cultivation talent seems to have improved considerably from before! What in the world happened, Second Uncle?” Huang Qian suddenly said with an excited look.

“...”

Everyone was speechless. This was called not right?

Clap!

Huang Haoran directly gave Huang Qian a slap and said crossly, “You little punk, you’re trying to scare your second uncle? I asked you to check if something is wrong with your body, this is called something wrong?”

Although Huang Qian’s current strength was already almost catching up to Huang Haoran, in front of Huang Haoran, he did not seem to have the awareness of a powerhouse.

Huang Qian smiled bitterly and said, “It is something wrong! Why would my cultivation talent improve so much out of the blue?”

Huang Haoran was dumbstruck for a while and discovered that what Huang Qian said seemed to be very logical. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He had just woken up and suddenly discovered that his talent improved a lot, wasn’t this something wrong?

Huang Haoran was incredibly shocked in his heart. He did not expect that the Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill was actually so heaven-defying.

This kind of transformation was simply being reborn anew!

One had to know, cultivation talent this thing was the hardest to change.

A medicinal pill, not only could it purge an incurable poison, it could even improve cultivation talent.

Spending these 50 million divine essence stones, it was definitely worthwhile!

Except ... Master Wu Feng that side, it was hard for Huang Haoran to deal with him.

Huang Haoran was full of bitterness in his heart but also knew that this kind of thing ultimately could not be avoided.

The surrounding onlookers looked at Huang Qian with envious faces. This guy’s luck was simply off the charts, to actually be able to meet Master Ye, this kind of alchemy divine physician. This was the fortune cultivated for several lifetimes.

As for Ding Song and the rest, their faces became ugly to the extreme.

Ye Yuan treating Huang Qian was equivalent to officially announcing that their action of looking for trouble today failed!

They finally witnessed Ye Yuan’s strength. This guy was simply a freak, sweeping across the entire south city with his strength alone.

Today, Ye Yuan was equivalent to sweeping away the faces of all the alchemists in the south city.

Didn’t you guys come to find trouble? What now?

Now, they thoroughly blew up the reputation of the Miracle Hand Parlor!

They could predict that before tomorrow morning, the news of Ye Yuan single-handedly challenging the five major factions would spread throughout the entire south city, even the entire outer city!

Miracle Hand Parlor would definitely become the hottest medicine shop in the south city.

“Little punk, why haven’t you gone to thank Master Ye yet? If not for Master Ye snatching you from the jaws of death, you’d have entered the gates of hell in a few days! You got poisoned by an ancient strange poison, even Four-star Alchemy Gods are powerless to do anything. It was Master Ye who cured you!” Huang Haoran scolded.

Although he was scolding, the joy on Huang Haoran’s face could not be concealed no matter what.

Buzz!

Huang Haoran’s words ignited everyone!

“Master Wu Feng indeed got a Four-starAalchemy God to come and look before!”

“Turns out that this is where Master Wu Feng’s confidence lies! It’s just that he probably never thought that a poison even a Four-star Alchemy God could do nothing about was actually cured by Master Ye!”

“More than that! Huang Qian this kid simply hit the jackpot! Putting aside curing the poison, he even saved many years of bitter cultivation. Now, even his cultivation talent has been enhanced!”

“I feel that ... 50 million divine essence stones were simply too cheap! Master Ye charged a conscience price!”

...

A commotion broke out inside the Miracle Hand Parlor all at once. Only then did they know that Huang Qian had indeed gotten a Four-star Alchemy God to take a look before.

That was a Four-star Alchemy God!

Same as martial arts realm, the disparity between Four-star Alchemy Gods and Three-star Alchemy Gods was also immense.

However, Ye Yuan completed the task that even a Four-star Alchemy God could not complete.

How could this not astonish them?

Ning Siyu’s gaze never left Ye Yuan’s body from the very beginning.

Others did not know how terrifying this Purple Quill Marrow Extermination poison was, but she knew.

This poison was a difficult problem throughout the ages. No one had ever resolved it before!

But Ye Yuan did it!

Just which step did this guy walk until on the path of alchemy?

“Eh? Master Ye?”

Huang Qian looked at Ye Yuan in surprise. This ridiculously young kid was the person who cured him?

But he naturally did not have any doubts about Huang Haoran’s words, immediately bowing down to salute and said, “Huang Qian gives his thanks to Master Ye’s life-saving grace.”

Clap!

Clap!

Clap!

At this time, clear applause sounded out. A powerful aura suddenly appeared in the Miracle Hand Parlor, crushing everyone until they could not catch their breath.

“Divine Lord Realm powerhouse!” Somebody exclaimed.

Such a powerful aura, it could only be a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse.

Xiao Riyue divided the crowd and slowly walked into the lobby.

An aura that showed disdain on all under the heavens was displayed in its entirety.

“X-Xiao Riyue! You ... You broke through to Divine Lord Realm?”

When Meng Huo saw that familiar figure, his complexion was white as a sheet, his eyes full of disbelief.

It had always been said that Xiao Riyue was in a closed-seclusion to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, but few would believe that he could really break through to the Divine Lord Realm.

But now, he really broke through!

This was simply devastating news to the Thunderclap Gang!

“Humph!”

Xiao Riyue snorted coldly, directly sending Meng Huo flying.

“Is this divine lord’s name what you can call directly?” Xiao Riyue said in a cold voice.

This blow of Xiao Riyue’s was much stronger than Luo Yu’s, immediately dealing heavy injuries to Meng Huo.

He turned to look at Ye Yuan and said with a light smile, “Master Ye is truly impressive! A poison that even a Four-star Alchemy God can’t resolve, you actually resolved it! Your esteemed self’s Alchemy Dao attainments are simply transcendent!”

Ye Yuan furrowed his brows and said in a solemn voice, “You injured my people in my medicine shop?”

Xiao Riyue was stunned and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “A mere ant, if injured, then he’s injured, what’s the big deal?”

From Xiao Riyue’s tone, Ye Yuan could infer his objective of coming.

But this guy was truly a little too rampant.

He would not think that he was invincible because he broke through to the Divine Lord Realm, right?

“You also just transformed from an ant, being cocky for what? Moreover ... you’re merely a slightly larger ant right now!” Ye Yuan said disgruntledly.
