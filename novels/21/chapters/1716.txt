1720 Vanished Sword

“Heh heh, the guy who’s courting death is here!”

“Tsk tsk, I really admire his courage, to actually threaten to kill Xiahou Yun!”

“Eh, this guy ... seems to have broken through!”

“It’s true, his aura is indeed much stronger! However ... it’s useless. His greatest reliance is his fleshy body. Martial arts breakthrough can’t change any outcome.”

...

When Ye Yuan came to the vicinity of the sixth ring, he immediately attracted a wave of ridicule.

Six rounds passed, and only eight people remained currently.

These eight people would battle to determine the final, first place.

At the Hundred Battles Arena, the second place did not have any meaning.

Only the person who got the first place could get the Profound Secrets Pavilion’s grand elder’s guidance.

Passing by Xiahou Yun, he smiled scornfully and said, “This is your final reliance? Huhu, what can a Third Firmament Divine Lord change?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s sufficient to kill you!”

Xiahou Yun burst into laughter and said, “Fine, then this young master will wait for you to come and ... kill me!”

Seventh round, eight into four; Ye Yuan’s opponent was a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord. He passed the round effortlessly.

Of course, Xiahou Yun was even more relaxed than he was. His opponent directly forfeited.

With Gao Shun’s lesson, who still dared to find him to try their hand? Unless they were tired of living.

The eighth round was similarly like so!

Ye Yuan’s strength was already the number one person apart from Xiahou Yun. Extreme Light Imperial City naturally had to put their fight at the last.

In the ninth round, Xiahou Yun and Ye Yuan finally faced off!

On the grandstands, Jian Ping was excited until his face flushed red. He seemed to have already seen the spectacle of Ye Yuan being blown up by Xiahou Yun with one punch.

Standing on the ring, Xiahou Yun smiled faintly and said, “Brat, I’m very curious how you’re going to receive my punch!”

Done talking, Xiahou Yun performed a stance, exactly identical to when killing Gao Shun back then.

The atmosphere below the ring immediately became different. A strange aura practically made people suffocate.

Before this, the shock that this punch gave them was too intense.

What was different was that the punch before this, Xiahou Yun struck only after the enemy had struck.

But this time, he struck first to gain the initiative.

The moment was already formed, what followed was a destructive blow!

Bang!

A punch slammed out, the entire space seemed to be shattered.

An invisible force rumbled over towards Ye Yuan like blotting out the skies and covering the earth, the speed incomparably fast.

Bang!

The grand array behind Ye Yuan emitted gave off intense shaking. The entire ring seemingly started to quake.

Xiahou Yun’s expression changed and he cried out in shock, “Spatial law, Third Firmament!”

Ye Yuan had never truly displayed the power of spatial law before in front of people.

Most people thought that Ye Yuan merely comprehended some superficial knowledge.

But in reality, he already comprehended Third Firmament spatial law.

This was a remarkable achievement!

Although destruction law was powerful, compared to spatial law, it was still a notch inferior.

The geniuses on the grandstands were all shocked until they could not close their mouths.

“A-Actually avoided it!”

“How ... How did he do it?”

“Truly unimaginable! Is ... Is this the true power of spatial law?”

...

Ye Yuan looked at Xiahou Yun and said coolly, “Destruction law is nothing more than this!”

Xiahou Yun’s gaze turned intent, anger immediately rising in his heart.

He was actually looked down upon!

Comprehending destruction law, he grew up amidst praises and envious voices.

Today, he was actually despised by another person!

He gritted his teeth and said, “Stop posturing! Just now was merely an appetizer! Now, it’s the real deal!”

Xiahou Yun’s figure moved, floating over toward Ye Yuan, swift as lightning!

On the grandstands, someone cried out in shock, “Law of wind! Turns out that Xiahou Yun even comprehended rank four wind law! This guy is truly a freak!”

“Law of wind in conjunction with destruction law is simply sweeping forth ever-victorious!”

“Ye Yuan is in danger! He shouldn’t have gone to provoke Xiahou Yun!”

...

Xiahou Yun’s figure was extremely fast, punches throwing like the wind.

Waves of explosion sound emitted within the array formation. Space seemed to be smashed until it warped.

While Ye Yuan’s entire figure disappeared.

People knew that Ye Yuan activated spatial law!

But the undulations coming from Xiahou Yun’s attacks made each and every one of them turn deathly pale.

Such concentrated attacks, the ripples were much stronger than when killing Gao Shun back then.

Under the cooperation of wind law, Xiahou Yun’s attacks virtually had no dead angles, covering all over the ring.

In everyone’s view, Ye Yuan had nowhere to hide at all!

Suddenly, Xiahou Yun’s attack stopped. The entire ring returned to tranquility.

Xiahou Yun panted a little. Such fierce attacks likewise had a considerable burden on him.

“Humph! So what if spatial law? See if you don’t die still!” Xiahou Yun said with a cold snort.

On the ring, Ye Yuan’s figure was already gone.

“Sure enough, Ye Yuan still died!”

“Under such horrifying attacks, how can he possibly survive?”

“Xiahou Yun is really too strong!”

...

In everyone’s view, Ye Yuan had long been blasted to scraps already. Under such concentrated attacks, it was completely impossible for anyone to survive.

“Rather interesting. It’s just too bad that it’s still too weak!” A voice sounded out in thin air.

Xiahou Yun’s expression changed drastically. Who was this if not Ye Yuan’s voice?

This guy actually was not dead yet!

Only to see a hint of ripple surface in space. Ye Yuan’s figure slowly walked out.

Everyone burst into an uproar!

Couldn’t even die like this?

Was spatial law really overwhelmingly powerful?

Ye Yuan looked at Xiahou Yun and said coolly, “Wind law acting in concert with destruction law, indeed pretty good. It’s just a pity that you can’t even accomplish fusing laws!”

Xiahou Yun’s expression changed and he said in a cold voice, “Stop pretending! Destruction is an ultimate level law, how can wanting to fuse it be that easy?”

Two independent laws and fusing laws, that power was completely different.

How could Xiahou Yun possibly not understand this point?

He had once attempted to fuse these two kinds of power of laws countless times. It was just a pity that ... he could not do it!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Is it really that difficult? Why don’t you say that you’re too dumb?”

Xiahou Yun sneered and said, “I’m dumb? Heh heh, this is really the funniest joke that I’ve heard before! These 3000 over people, who dares to say that their talent is greater than mine?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a smile, “Can’t even achieve fusing laws, aren’t you dumb?”

Xiahou Yun spat: “Stop making sarcastic remarks, do you think that you’re superior to others for comprehending spatial law? Or is it that you think that my strength merely stops here?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Bring it on then! This time, I’m going to attack too. You have to receive it well.”

Xiahou Yun said indifferently, “A trash who only knows how to use spatial law to dodge, do you think that this young master will really be scared of you?”

While talking, Xiahou Yun slowly put on a white glove. It was shockingly a peak divine lord mystic treasure!

Immediately after, Xiahou Yun’s aura skyrocketed. An aura that was even more horrifying than before spread out.

“Annihilation Divine Fist!”

Ye Yuan slowly pulled out the Junyi Sword, his entire person becoming illusory.

“Hang on, where’s Ye Yuan’s sword?”

“Yeah, I clearly saw him holding his sword in his hand just now, why is it gone?”

“This ... Do you feel that Ye Yuan’s entire person is somewhat surreal?”
