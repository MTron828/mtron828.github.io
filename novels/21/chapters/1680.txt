Chapter 1684 Medicinal Pill Unusual Change

After Ye Yuan left, Coldfeather said with an astonished look, “This ... He should have just broken through not long ago, right? He’s already able to refine such a high level of difficulty medicinal pill?”

Xuan Yu mused for a moment and said, “The power of Dao Realm is not what the likes of us can surmise. To us, we’re still stuck at the shallow realm of seeing a mountain as a mountain. He has likely already reached the realm of seeing a mountain as not a mountain! What he came into contact with is the source of Alchemy Dao. Learning yields twice the result with half the effort. It is far from what the likes of us can imagine.”

Coldfeather was completely clueless about Alchemy Dao, but he knew Xuan Yu’s strength.

Xuan Yu saying this showed that Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao boundary was already unimaginable.

He suddenly thought of something and said to Xuan Yu, “Did you feel that this kid’s realm is somewhat difficult to ascertain? It doesn’t seem as simple as a first-layered heaven Divine Lord!”

Xuan Yu nodded and said, “Seeing him just now felt like he was completely reborn anew. Moreover, I couldn’t see through his actual situation. It seems like a first-layered heaven Divine Lord, but at the same time it is not!”

Coldfeather drew a deep breath and said, “I have a feeling that this kid’s accomplishments in the future, we probably can’t imagine it!”

Xuan Yu nodded his head, deeply feeling that way too.

After several hours, Ye Yuan came out of seclusion.

Ye Yuan handed over two medicinal pills, seeming slightly tired as he said, “This is the Pure Yang Strong Divine Pill and Mystic Longevity Replenishing Essence Pill. Let Brother Zheng consume it.”

Clearly, these two medicinal pills were not easy for the current him.

The Pure Yang Strong Divine Pill’s effect was to purge the Yin energy within the body, while the Mystic Longevity Replenishing Essence Pill’s effect was to nourish the blood and vitality, recovering one’s energy.

Zheng Qi used the Crazed Sword Evanescent, the vital essence within his body had long been emptied out already. It was very hard for ordinary medicinal pills to replenish it.

Hence, that was why Xuan Yu had always been at a loss on what to do. Because he could not refine a high-grade Mystic Longevity Replenishing Essence Pill. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

When Xuan Yu saw the two medicinal pills, his entire body involuntarily shuddered and he said in surprise, “D-Divine-grade! You just broke through and can actually already refine these two medicinal pills to divine-grade. This is truly inconceivable!”

These two medicinal pills were not simply. It was difficult for Xuan Yu to even refine superior-grade pills. Ye Yuan just broke through to rank four and could actually refine divine-grade already. It was not up to him to not be surprised.

This also showed that after breaking through to rank four, Ye Yuan’s pill refining standard already surpassed him in all aspects!

Right now, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s Alchemy Dao’s number one person also officially changed hands!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Xuan Yu, I wasn’t just thinking about how to break through in these close to 400 years’ time! Rank four medicinal pills, I’ve long become thoroughly familiar with them. What was missing was just the level of attainment.”

Xuan Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Even so, it’s also sufficiently astonishing!”

400 years?

Xuan Yu already immersed in rank four medicinal pills for more than 40 thousand years. Ye Yuan only used 400 years and already completely defeated him.

This ... was perhaps the disparity between mortals and geniuses, right?

But Xuan Yu did not have the thought of being jealous of Ye Yuan but felt happy for him instead.

The current Ye Yuan truly held extraordinary meaning to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City already.

Ye Yuan said, “Brother Coldfeather, Brother Zheng’s body is empty and already can’t refine medicinal pills himself. You go and help him refine the medicinal pills.”

Coldfeather nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll take him there straight away.”

After the two people left, Ye Yuan was just about to go into seclusion to recover his divine essence when someone outside came to report that the Ning Family’s Ning Zhiyuan was requesting an audience.

The moment Xuan Yu heard, he could not help sneering as he said, “Heh, really materialistic! Back then, when you weren’t able to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, he dropped a rock down the well at the elders meeting. Now, when he heard that you broke through, he’s the first one to come to find you!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Just the way the world works! You go and tell him, just say that I’m currently helping Head Elder Zheng Qi refine pills and isn’t free to meet guests.”

The servant did not dare to disobey and could only back down.

These two were both big shots that could not be offended!

...

Outside the Zheng Manor’s front door, Ning Zhiyuan’s expression was somewhat ugly.

He was the head of the Ning Family, an eighth-layered heaven Divine lord powerhouses. Now, he was actually turned down at the door!

“Oh, Tianping, this kid is also a little too arrogant, right? This family head already came to seek an audience in person, he actually isn’t even meeting!” Ning Zhiyuan said with a frown.

Ning Tianping gave him a glance and said with a sigh, “Family Head, it’s not that I’m lifting His Excellency up. Ever since he stepped into Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s gates again, this is already an era that belongs to him! His alchemy strength, I believe that you’re very clear. As long as he’s willing, he can groom a small family clan to become a leviathan like the Ning Family within a few hundred years! Do you think he has the capital to be arrogant or not?”

Ning Zhiyuan could not help choking when he heard that and was indeed incredibly regretful in his heart.

He, this family head, was actually not even as far-sighted as a junior.

The return of Ning Tianping’s investment in Ye Yuan would be unimaginable!

Ning Zhiyuan already knew that the cultivation method Ning Tianping was currently cultivating was no longer the Ning Family’s cultivation method anymore. It was a peak rank six cultivation method!

And this lucky chance, Ye Yuan turned his nose up at it, giving it to Ning Tianping with both hands.

This matter was top secret, Ning Tianping only told Ning Zhiyuan alone.

What kind of concept was a peak rank six cultivation method?

That was a cultivation method that could cultivate all the way to peak True God!

With Ning Tianping’s talent, cultivating to Celestial Deity Realm was simply like playing around.

Pausing for a bit, Ning Zhiyuan eased up his tone and said to Ning Tianping, “Oh, Tianping, you’re currently the closest person to Ye Yuan. Why don’t ... you help put in a good word for the Ning Family? Let him not hate the Ning Family anymore, alright?”

Ning Tianping smiled bitterly and said, “Family Head, not that I’m not willing to speak up for the Ning Family. His Excellency this person, you don’t understand. He has his own very firm set of views and clearly distinguishes kindness and hatred! As long as it’s a person that he acknowledges, he can put his life on the line under any circumstances and won’t ever hesitate. But if it’s somebody that he doesn’t acknowledge, even if you wear your tongue out, it’s useless too! If the Ning Family wants to reconcile with His Excellency, Family Head, please show your sincerity. As long as His Excellency is willing to let the past misdeeds become bygones, on the account of my face, he’ll more or less take care of the Ning Family a little. But Family Head, not that I’m exaggerating things to raise an alarm, this is also the last chance!”

Ning Tianping had followed Ye Yuan for a long time and already knew Ye Yuan very well.

Wanting to shake Ye Yuan’s judgment of a person, that was impossible, even for him.

In Ye Yuan’s eyes, he, Ning Tianping, was Ning Tianping. The Ning Family was the Ning Family, these were two different things.

Ye Yuan absolutely would not show extra care to the Ning Family because of Ning Tianping.

Hearing Ning Tianping’s words, Ning Zhiyuan was slightly fearful in his heart.

He suddenly realized that the Ning Family already reached a very crucial fork in the road!

...

No idea how long had passed either, inside the hidden chamber, Coldfeather was currently helping Zheng Qi refine the medicinal pills when suddenly, his expression changed, hurriedly withdrawing his divine essence.

He looked at Zheng Qi in great shock and muttered, “This medicinal pill ... seems to be somewhat unusual! Zheng Qi, do you feel it?”

Zheng Qi’s spirit already recovered 50% to 60% at this time. Hearing that, he nodded and said, “Grandmaster, I already feel it! Most likely ... I’m going to break through!”

Coldfeather’s gaze turned intent and he said in shock, “What? These two medicinal pills are only supposed to help you recover from your injuries, but you’re actually going to break through?”
