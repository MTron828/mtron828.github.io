Chapter 1313: Act out the Full Play When Putting on a Show

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Manager Su was still very capable and experienced when handling matters. He really sealed this news completely shut and did not reveal a hint of breeze.

Wang Lingbo naturally knew his own Poisonfeather Thousand Night very clearly.

Counting the medicinal efficacy of a heaven-grade Detoxification Pill, Liang Wanru’s limit was also just 40 days.

So, early this morning, he sent his sister, Wang Pianran, over.

Wang Pianran brought along a large group of people, surrounding the Myriad Treasure Tower until not even water could flow through.

What made people’s jaws drop was that Wang Pianran actually wore a white-colored mourning dress, the tears on her face not yet dry.

The surrounding people had quite a number of busybodies as well as the three great families’ eyes and ears.

Myriad Treasure Tower and the Wang Family’s conflict had quite a number of people all watching the joke.

Of course, it was watching the Myriad Treasure Tower’s joke.

What the Wang Family was most proficient at was using poison. And the Poisonfeather Thousand Night was even the Wang Family’s masterpiece, killing people imperceptibly.

Everyone all knew that in this Jewelhill City, no one could resolve the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s poison!

It was precisely because so that everyone’s countenance all changed when talking about it.

Even the Lin Family and Lu Family were very wary of the Wang Family too.

After all, open spears were easy to dodge, but hidden arrows were hard to defend against.

“Su Linpu, quickly hand over the person for me! My family’s Wanru is the Liang Family’s member in life and the Liang Family’s ghost in death! Quickly hand over the person!”

“Oh,

right, didn’t your Myriad Treasure Tower’s new guest alchemist say that he can cure the Poisonfeather Thousand Night poison in my family’s Wanru? You all call her out for me to take a look!”

“Sniff, sniff ... My Wanru! You died so unjustly!”

...

Wang Pianran swayed her body of excessive flesh, shouting at the top of her voice, and actually wailed bitterly in front of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s front door.

She kept going “my family’s Wanru,” calling dearly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This acting really caught everyone by surprise.

Wasn’t this Wang Pianran a wicked woman, putting her hands on her own stepdaughter?

What was going on with this play today?

Wang Pianran cried very sadly as if her biological daughter had died.

Previously, the Wang Family already put in sufficient work to stir this matter up until it bubbled with noise.

Wang Lingbo’s objective was very clear. Since somebody dared to challenge the Wang Family’s most formidable Poisonfeather Thousand Night, then the Wang Family would take this chance to smack him to death!

At the very least, he had to smack that hateful brat to death and destroy his reputation!

As long as Ye Yuan’s reputation was ruined, that would be a hot potato. The Myriad Treasure Tower absolutely would not dare to keep him anymore.

As long as he did not have the Myriad Treasure Tower’s protection, however the Wang Family wanted to knead Ye Yuan, that was at their free rein.

He failed to humiliate Ye Yuan that day and was instead humiliated badly by Ye Yuan. This made Wang Lingbo unable to stomach this grievance no matter what.

Not screwing Ye Yuan to death, he would not give up.

A cripple also dared to contend with him, this Jewelhill’s overlord? He really did not know how the word death was written!

“That fat sow is really disgusting! That body full of fats is almost crushing the ground!”

“Isn’t that so? It’s fine if she’s ugly, her heart is even incomparably vicious, to actually give her own stepdaughter the Poisonfeather Thousand Night!”

“Yeah, but what’s playing out here today? Could it be that the rumors previously weren’t real?”

“However, does the Myriad Treasure Tower really have the ability to cure the Poisonfeather Thousand Night? Once this boast is thrown out, if they can’t do it, it wouldn’t be easy to clean up the mess!”

“Heh, the Poisonfeather Thousand Night can be said to be Jewelhill City’s number one poison. Unless it’s a divine-grade Detoxification Pill, otherwise, it’s incurable! That newly recruited guest alchemist of the Myriad Treasure Tower poked a big hole in the basket this time! His days are probably very tough, right?”

“Isn’t that so! I heard that this guest alchemist is a cripple. To actually dare let out grand words, saying that he wanted to resolve the Poisonfeather Thousand Night. Isn’t this reaching his face out to let people hit?”

...

Through the Wang Family’s schemes, the matter of the Myriad Treasure Tower challenging the Poisonfeather Thousand Night already became a hot topic.

Not only was no one optimistic about the Myriad Treasure Tower, there were even quite a number of people who were very contemptuous of Ye Yuan, feeling that Ye Yuan was purely a troublemaker, causing such a big problem for the Myriad Treasure Tower.

If this matter was not handled well, the impact on the Myriad Treasure Tower would be too great.

At this time, Manager Su finally came out after being called repeatedly.

Seeing Wang Pianran’s head held high acting, he was unbelievably pleased in his heart.

“Heh, even we didn’t expect that Ye Yuan was actually able to refine the divine-grade Detoxification Pill. Wang Lingbo, you probably didn’t expect it even if your dreams, right? If they didn’t spread this matter, we would have dropped it. Now, everybody knows about it, that’s digging a pit for yourself to jump! The expression on this dumb woman’s face in a while will definitely be very wonderful!” Manager Su sneered coldly his heart.

Being secretly pleased was secretly pleased, but Manager Su was also an extremely shrewd person, how could he show it?

Yang Rui making him seal off the news was in order to maximize the interests of the Myriad Treasure Tower and ruthlessly smack the Wang Family’s face. He pushed Ye Yuan this alchemy master out along with it!

That way, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s situation in Jewelhill City would be greatly improved.

As for Wang Pianran, this fat sow’s farce, Manager Su just sneered coldly in his heart.

“This is the Myriad Treasure Tower’s territory. It’s not allowed for you, a woman, to behave atrociously! If you’re sensible, hurry up and leave! Otherwise, don’t blame our Myriad Treasure Tower for not being courteous!” Manager Su said solemnly.

Seeing Manager Su’s appearance, Wang Pianran was even more smug in her heart, and said with a sneer, “Su Linpu, so many pairs of eyes are watching! I don’t believe that you all, such a massive Myriad Treasure Tower, dare to bully me, a woman!”

Manager Su’s brows furrowed, and he said solemnly, “Wang Pianran, what the hell do you want? Aren’t you scared of throwing away your husband family’s face like this?”

Wang Pianran smiled coldly and said, “Heh, your guest alchemist brought along Luo Jian and forcefully barged into the Liang Family, abducting our family’s Liang Wanru, and seriously wounding my husband and second uncle. It’s already bullying people too far! My family’s pitiable Wanru, you died so unjustly!”

Manager Su said unhappily, “Frivolous quibbling! Miss Wanru is Ye Yuan’s savior, him breaking into your Liang Family to save people is an unquestionable moral truth! Whence the talk of abducting? Rather, you all actually inflicted the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s poison onto your own stepdaughter, truly venomous as a viper!”

Wang Pianran’s eyes swiveled around, secretly pleased in her heart. This old punk finally fell into the trap!

“Su Linpu, you don’t throw slanderous charges! Wanru normally hates me the most. She hates that I snatched her mother’s position, so she opposes me at home. My temper isn’t good, so I quarrel very badly with her, that’s true! But, poisoning her this time is just lightly punishing her, so that she’ll be aware of the overwhelming odds against her! I have the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s antidote in my hands, how can I possibly watch her die unfeelingly? No matter how she is, she’s my husband’s daughter at any rate. Rather, that boy lusted after her beauty and abducted her away, and even ran in front of my brother to let out grand words without feeling shame, saying what, he could cure the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s poison! But now, it harmed her life! Sniff, sniff ... that pitiful daughter of mine, you died so tragically! That boy is the true culprit who caused your death!”

One had to admit that this fatty’s acting skills were really on point. The tears fell on command, crying very miserably.

This wail really deceived quite a number of people.

Her venomous woman image faded away considerably all at once.

Because she confounded black and white, now, quite a few people were glaring at Manager Su.

Ye Yuan was the real culprit, then the Myriad Treasure Tower was naturally the accomplice.

Wang Pianran said it reasonably and logically, and also did not conceal her shrew side, making the surrounding audience unable to hate her instead.
