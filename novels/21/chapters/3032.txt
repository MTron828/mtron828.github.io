Chapter 3031: Labyrinth Divine Palace Appears!

“Find him? Give up hope! This old thing is mysterious to the extreme. Unless he takes the initiative to show himself, otherwise, no one can think about finding him! However, this old thing is really strong. Back then, if the Labyrinth Divine Palace did not disturb his cultivation, they would have probably long succeeded in unifying all the heavens!” Long Jian knocked him down without the slightest mercy.

Hegemon Samsara was the most mysterious existence among the Hegemons in all the heavens!

Similarly, an existence that was the worst to provoke!

No one knew how strong he was. But, without a doubt, his strength was sufficient to make everyone hold him in awe and veneration.

If one could find someone that could confront the Chaos Bloodstone in all the heavens, then it was none other than him.

But unfortunately, if he did not take the initiative to show himself, no one could find him.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned to Hegemon Soul Intent. The latter smiled bitterly and said, “Nobody can find Progenitor Samsara, including Lord Heavenly Soul!”

Ye Yuan also sighed when he heard that and said, “We inflicted heavy wounds on Blood Twenty Three. This is the best chance to utterly defeat him. He has already obtained four great chaos true spirit bloodlines. Once he studies it thoroughly, his strength will likely be unimaginable. After Blood Twenty Three’s strength completely recovers, he might really be able to transcend the Great Beyond! Sigh, what a pity!”

Ye Yuan learned from Long Jian and the rest that this Chaos Bloodstone was called Blood Twenty Three.

Everyone also guessed that the Chaos Bloodstone’s clones in all the heavens were actually numbered in numeral order.

For example, the Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven’s clone was called Blood Two.

With regards to this kind of situation, everyone also felt very regretful. But Hegemon Samsara, this kind of existence, was simply within sight but beyond reach.

Everything could only be left up to fate.

A discussion without a conclusion, in the end, they could only disperse on their own.

The great battle stabilizing, Long Jian and the others naturally did not have the need to stay behind either and returned on their own.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had a Zhuo Bufan holding down the fort. It was sufficient to defend themselves for the time being.

Ye Yuan was also not someone who placed his hopes on others.

Therefore, he also was secretly determined to work harder at cultivation.

Having missed this opportunity, Ye Yuan felt that in the future, the Chaos Bloodstone would probably reach an extremely terrifying realm.

It might be possible that even Hegemon Samsara would not be a match too!

Of course, he was currently unable to understand that kind of realm, it was just a strong feeling.

Thus, for everything, he could only rely on himself.

Several thousand years later, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven welcomed a period of rare tranquility.

There were a thousand things that needed to be done.

The Extreme Medicine Sect had already become Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s supreme holy land, becoming the leader sect of all the major factions.

Very soon, Ye Yuan and Zhuo Bufan worked out plans and started to rest and recuperate.

The Extreme Medicine Sect, as well as the various major factions, opened up their resources to all martial artists.

Ten years later, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven also gradually got on the right track.

And in these ten years, Ye Yuan inquired for intel from all worlds. The blood race seemed to have ceased all activities, suddenly disappearing without a trace.

This piece of news made Ye Yuan even more uneasy.

People with a discerning eye all knew that this was the quiet before the storm!

After the Chaos Bloodstone emerges, that would be a battle that swept across all the heavens!

Fortunately, Ye Yuan and the others inflicted heavy wounds on Blood Twenty Three. If the Chaos Bloodstone wanted to transcend the Great Beyond, it would not be that easy too.

For more than ten years, Ye Yuan did research on bloodlines while cultivating.

Jiang Zhennan still had some deformities but already mostly recovered, and he did not seem so frightening anymore.

For the sake of his brothers who suffered the same disaster as him, he was willing to be Ye Yuan’s experiment.

However, the result of the experiments made him more and more ecstatic.

He really saw hope!

Of course, Zhao Yue’s situation was more complicated than theirs. Ye Yuan was also at a loss on what to do for some time.

Thus, Jiang Zhennan became even more respectful and held even greater esteem for Ye Yuan.

This kind of peaceful situation lasted all the way until the 17th year after the war.

On that day, all the heavens shook!

Above the void, an enormous group of palaces emerged!

It looked like a mirage.

Those palaces were towering and grandiose, giving people a heavy feeling of majesty.

“What is this? Why do I feel like it’s the end of the world? Could it be that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven is going to suffer a great calamity again?”

“What a mysterious palace! Why do I feel like I’m suffocating from so far away?”

“You guys, look! There’s a passageway there that seems to lead straight to the palaces!”

Above the palaces, a passageway extended out.

It was just that the people were wavering and not advancing, not daring to go to the passageway.

Suddenly, several powerful auras appeared above the void.

The moment people looked, their hearts immediately calmed down greatly.

The arrivals were precisely Zhuo Bufan and Ye Yuan and the others.

Ye Yuan looked at the palace phantoms in the distance. A familiar feeling arose spontaneously.

“Is that … the Labyrinth Divine Palace?” Ye Yuan said.

“Labyrinth Divine Palace?” Zhuo Bufan was somewhat confused. Clearly, he did not know about the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

The Labyrinth Divine Palace swept across all the heavens back then, causing countless casualties. But it also formed a disjointed generation in that era.

Apart from some of the old fellows, there were not many people who knew about the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was already ruled by the Labyrinth Divine Palace back then.

Even Cloudmount, this kind of powerhouse, was also a Hegemon powerhouse who rose up after the Labyrinth Divine Palace fell.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “It’s the Labyrinth Divine Palace. There’s no mistake! This is the real Labyrinth Divine Palace, where their holy land is!”

This palace’s style and aura were exactly the same as the small Labyrinth Divine Palace that Ye Yuan had once entered.

But that kind of abstruse aura was much stronger than the small Labyrinth Divine Palace.

Therefore, Ye Yuan determined that this must be the real Labyrinth Divine Palace!

It was just that why would this Labyrinth Divine Palace appear here?

He recounted the origins of the Labyrinth Divine Palace, making everyone dumbfounded from listening.

A Hegemon said with a solemn expression, “You’re saying that after the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s war, the entire holy land went missing. Why did it suddenly appear here now? Could it be that they are going to stage a comeback again?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “This palace is very illusory. It’s not where its main body is! Being able to create such an effect for a palace, this method is truly inconceivable! It’s just that this palace has a lifeless atmosphere. It has probably long been desolate. It probably won’t bounce back.”

That Hegemon Realm expert then said somewhat fearfully, “But, even I, this Hegemon Realm, feel a huge crisis!”

This palace gave him a very dangerous feeling.

In this world, there were not many places that could make Hegemon Realms feel danger.

Zhuo Bufan suddenly said, “Why don’t I go and probe it first?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I know that Brother Zhuo’s Sword Dao is fearless, but the terror of the Labyrinth Divine Palace isn’t what you can imagine! Although you’re a Supreme Hegemon, if there’s really a danger, you might not be able to escape too! We’d better not act rashly without careful consideration.”

Suddenly, the void trembled, and a middle-aged man suddenly appeared before everyone.

The moment the middle-aged man appeared, he looked toward the palace in the air, his expression solemn.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, and he said with joy, “Senior Mi Tian, I was just about to go find you. I didn’t expect that you would actually come!”

Mi Tian nodded his head and said, ‘Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven indeed has it too!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he said, “Why? Could it be that the Labyrinth Divine Palace actually appeared in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven too?”
