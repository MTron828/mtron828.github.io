Chapter 2706: Instantly Killing Jade Sovereign Heaven!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Golden Eagle Dual Fiends’ second brother heard that, he said with a loud laugh,?“Haha,?this human wouldn’t be a fool, right? He said that he’s going to deal with the two of us!”

The older brother said disdainfully, “Humans have always been ignorant and arrogant, thinking that they are number one under the heaven! Actually, they are all a bunch of idiots!”

Hei Fang and the rest of the leaders all snickered incessantly.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s words had hit their humor point.

Amidst the snickering, Ye Yuan moved.

He did not utilize spatial law. He rushed over unremarkably just like that.

In the eyes of Golden Eagle Dual Fiends and the rest, he was weak to the extreme.

The golden eagle second brother said with a laugh, “You all look, this boy has such swift movement technique. This commander is very scared!”

Him ridiculing Ye Yuan naturally attracted a series of guffaws.

Ye Yuan got closer and closer to them. Very soon, he was within a range of a thousand feet.

In their view, Ye Yuan’s behavior was purely seeking death.

The older brother had a sullen face and said with a cold snort, “Stop playing! Just kill him!”

Amidst the laughter, the second brother’s aura released and his figure leaped, greeting Ye Yuan with golden light radiating all over his body.

Countless feathers shot out, carrying a bone-piercing cold rule of wind; swift and fierce to the extreme.

“Golden Sword Eagle Feather! Go and die for me!”

A lower Limitless Sublime Heaven would definitely be shot into a sieve under this terrifying attack.

Everyone thought so.

Because in their eyes, Ye Yuan was too weak!

But right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly accelerated to the extreme, making everyone see a blur.

Buzz!

Before the golden eagle second brother understood what was going on, he only felt his head go dizzy, a momentary lapse appearing in his consciousness.

He was alarmed and instinctively felt that something was amiss.

But, he was unable to control his consciousness.

Because his origin divinity was attacked by Ye Yuan!

At the same time, an astonishing dragon roar burst forth.

Ye Yuan took out the Dragon Spring Sword!

Currently, Ye Yuan was already less than a thousand feet away from the golden eagle second brother.

Unleashing the Dragon Spring Sword at this distance, the speed was swift to the extreme!

“Old Second!”

When the golden eagle older brother saw that the second brother was still in a daze, he could not help yelling. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

At the same time, his figure moved explosively, making a move against Ye Yuan.

This strike was too terrifying!

That swift and fierce sword intent actually fused the power of a true dragon!

Caught completely off-guard, even a Jade Sovereign Heaven would have to die with regrets too!

But it was too late!

The golden eagle second brother leaping just now, his distance was already less than 200 feet away from Ye Yuan.

Under this distance, with Ye Yuan suddenly launching a sneak attack, he had no way of guarding against it at all.

Boom!

The golden eagle second brother’s body was directly chopped into several pieces!

When the golden eagle older brother saw this scene, his eyes turned bloodshot from anger!

The entire Three Saint Ridge was deathly silent.

No one expected that the Golden Eagle Dual Fiends actually became the Golden Eagle Single Fiend in a blink of an eye!

In this instance earlier, from Ye Yuan launching an origin divinity attack, to activating spatial rule to avoid the Golden Sword Eagle Feather attack, then to executing the Dragon Spring Sword, everything was virtually accomplished in one breath!

Quicker than words could tell!

In just a blink of an eye, a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse was killed!

Actually, the moment Ye Yuan saw the Golden Eagle Dual Fiends, he had been considering countermeasures.

With his strength, dealing with a Jade Sovereign Heaven was more than enough.

But two Jade Sovereign Heavens, furthermore, they were twin brothers, it was beyond his means.

Ye Yuan knew that once such twin brothers joined forces, their strength far surpassed those of the same rank.

Therefore, he deliberately took action slowly in the beginning, behaving not the slightest bit surprised at all, looking just like an ordinary lower Limitless Sublime Heaven. It was to show weakness to the enemy!

When it reached within a thousand feet, that was his world!

Sure enough, he killed the golden eagle second brother in one exchange.

Finishing off the golden eagle second brother, dealing with the golden eagle older brother would be much easier.

But this scene was simply inconceivable to the extreme in the eyes of the true spirits that covered the hills and valleys.

Although there were countless true spirits in the Myriad Demons Mountain, Jade Sovereign Heaven true spirits were absolutely not some cabbages.

They were powerhouses that stood at the apex of the Myriad Demons Mountain!

Even a powerhouse like Bright Tiger King valued Jade Sovereign Heavens greatly too.

Especially the Golden Eagle Dual Fiends, they were absolutely the strongest existences in this radius of ten thousand miles.

Even Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses did not dare to provoke them easily too.

Now, one was actually killed in a single exchange!

“Is my eyesight failing? Second Commander actually died just like this?”

“What treasure is in his hands, how can it be so strong?”

“A lower Limitless Sublime Heaven actually finished off a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven. This … This is too fake!”

… …

The shock in everyone’s hearts was virtually beyond containment.

However, Shuoyan had long expected it!

He had seen before Ye Yuan took action. The outcome of the golden eagle second brother underestimating the enemy could only be death!

And he also knew that this was the chance that Ye Yuan created.

Therefore, he made his move!

“Kill!”

Shuoyan yelled out a little childishly, but carried an indomitable momentum as he rushed towards the Blackthorn Boar!

One should not look at how Shuoyan was young. His strength was not weak at all!

The Blackthorn Three Saints’ Old Third was still in a daze. Caught by surprise, he was killed by Shuoyan in one exchange!

Shuoyan taking the lead also greatly roused the morale of his men.

They followed behind Shuoyan and directly smashed the Three Saint Ridge army.

Three Saint Ridge’s true spirit army was still shocked by Ye Yuan’s astonishing strike at this time.

By the time they came to their senses, they were already being killed until they only had the ability to parry but did not have the strength to fight back!

Only then did the other factions return to their senses. Secretly scolding crafty, they also rushed over toward Shuoyan’s army.

The golden eagle older brother turned a blind eye to these.

There was only Ye Yuan left in his eyes, full of hatred!

The golden eagle older brother gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Origin divinity attack! Spatial rule! Grandmist treasure! Good! Terrific lad! You concealed really deeply!”

Succeeding with one strike, Ye Yuan was not in a hurry to attack either, saying with a smile, “Thanks for the praise. But you don’t need to look at me like this too. Lions will go all out to catch the rabbit. Do you guys think that by being Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, you’re invincible under the heavens?”

“Yeah! We underestimated the enemy. But now, we won’t! Boy, you killed my younger brother, this commander will definitely slice you into a thousand pieces today! Apocalyptic Storm!”

The golden eagle older brother directly showed his true body. The moment he spread his wings out, a storm immediately howled in the space around Ye Yuan.

In the storm, countless wind blades were extremely swift and fierce, practically slicing space apart.

It also became hard for Ye Yuan’s spatial rule to be exhibited amidst this!

Got to say, this golden eagle older brother’s rule comprehension was extremely strong. His strength could not be underestimated.

But it was precisely because of this that Ye Yuan not letting the two of them join forces was the wisest choice.

In the storm, Ye Yuan brandished the Dragon Spring Sword seamlessly until not even wind could penetrate.

The golden eagle older brother’s wind blades actually did not have the slightest chance.

This scene made everyone extremely shocked again.

If Ye Yuan one-shotting the golden eagle second brother earlier gave some suspicions of taking advantage by trickery, then now, it was the perfect display of his strength!

By relying on a Dragon Spring Sword, Ye Yuan’s strength was actually not the slightest bit weaker than the Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, the golden eagle older brother!
