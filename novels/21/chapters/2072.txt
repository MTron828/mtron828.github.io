Chapter 2076: Aweing the Group of Empyreans

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, thinking to himself that the thing he waited for finally came.

He naturally did not do so many things in order to show off his power and make a name for himself. It was actually in order to make these Empyreans pay him a visit.

Jiu Luo Ji had nine great Empyreans. Ye Yuan, as an outsider, running over to ask for people without rhyme or reason was no different from a lamb being thrown to the wolves.

Then what could let him get close to these Empyreans?

It was naturally alchemy!

Since Empyreans revered alchemy immensely, then as long as he displayed his alchemy strength, would these Empyreans still not look to him for help?

In addition, Ye Yuan also took out the Sunshine Glow, this major killing tool. These Empyreans would view him in a different light even more.

As for Empyrean Loneswan wanting to acknowledge him as master, this exceeded Ye Yuan’s expectations.

Eight Empyreans appearing in unison, the atmosphere in the hall became heavy all of a sudden.

Song Cao and the rest of the disciples waited upon them carefully, not daring to even breathe loudly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Yuan sat up straight, looking calm and composed.

The eight great Empyreans all sized Ye Yuan up with curious faces, clearly all carrying a trace of doubt.

They never would have thought that Empyrean Loneswan’s master was actually so young.

“Master, Disciple will introduce to you. This is Sword Star Pavilion’s Empyrean Void Sword,” Empyrean Loneswan said.

“Master Ji!” Empyrean Void Sword said with clasped hands.

Ye Yuan looked over, nodded his head slightly, which was considered to have greeted Empyrean Void Sword.

Empyrean Void Sword’s brows furrowed, thinking to himself that this boy was so arrogant.

Empyrean Loneswan appeared slightly awkward, but he knew that Master had great ability. Being a little cold and arrogant was normal. Hence, he carried on making introductions to several others.

“This is Ice Cloud Tower’s master, Empyrean Ice Cloud. Her ice-attribute laws have reached the acme of perfection, with her strength being powerful.”

But the fourth one that Empyrean Loneswan introduced was a middle-aged woman who had already partly lost her good looks but still retained her graceful bearing.

Actually, from the moment she came in, Ye Yuan’s attention was placed on her.

Among Jiu Luo Ji’s nine great Empyreans, only this Empyrean Ice Cloud was a woman. Who could it be if it was not her?

“Mmm.” Ye Yuan still grunted a response perfunctorily.

Empyrean Ice Cloud gave a cold snort and said, “Your esteemed self is also a little too arrogant, right? We’re this Jiu Luo Ji’s masters no matter what. Us greeting you and you gave us this kind of attitude?”

The moment Empyrean Loneswan heard this, he knew that it was going to be bad. Others did not know, but he knew that his master was not being arrogant. It was his master having the confidence.

How could ordinary Empyreans enter his eyes?

It was just that Empyrean Ice Cloud, this old lady’s temper, was not an ordinary kind of cold arrogance. How could she stand Ye Yuan’s attitude?

Sure enough, the other Empyreans were all reserved. But reaching her, it broke down.

Clearly, the other Empyreans also knew Empyrean Ice Cloud’s temper and were all waiting for her to jump out.

Everyone was not a fool. For Empyrean Loneswan to be able to acknowledge such a young person as his master, this young man definitely had aspects surpassing others.

Although they all did not believe it, they also would not be silly enough to go and offend the other party.

After all, they were all here to request for pills, and not to look for trouble.

Once they offended the master, where would they go to find medicinal pills?

Sure enough, Ye Yuan’s eyelids raised slightly and he said indifferently, “If Empyrean Ice Cloud feels like this Ji’s attitude is haughty, you can leave first. You all came here simply for the sake of requesting for pills. Since you have something to ask this Ji, then whatever attitude I have, you have to endure it. Isn’t that so?”

The moment the group of Empyreans heard, they all thought, terrific fellow, indeed clashed!

How venerated was Empyrean Ice Cloud’s status in this Jiu Luo Ji? When had she suffered this kind of wrong before?

It was only to see her laugh. She then said, “Huhu! What a wildly arrogant Master Ji! I wonder if your ability is as great as your spirit!”

Ye Yuan gave her a light glance and said coolly, “How can my ability be what you can gauge? I already said, those who don’t believe me can very well leave.”

“You!” Empyrean Ice Cloud’s frosty eyebrows rose in anger and she suddenly stood up.

With her flying into a rage, Empyrean pressure swept over toward Ye Yuan crazily. She actually wanted to take action.

With this, Empyrean Loneswan was enraged too. He said with a cold snort, “Ice Cloud, letting you all come in is Master giving you guys face. But you’re not giving this Empyrean face like this! This place doesn’t welcome you! Please leave! Also, don’t come and beg this Empyrean for medicinal pills for your Ice Cloud Tower anymore in the future!”

Empyrean Loneswan had long already prostrated on all fours in admiration toward Ye Yuan these few days.

Although he was an Empyrean, he would never put on any airs of an Empyrean in front of Ye Yuan.

Who could have thought that this Ice Cloud did not give face at all, and actually questioned Master in front of him, and even wanted to attack? How could he tolerate it?

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s expression darkened. Empyrean Loneswan’s move was too vicious!

In this Northernmost Steppe, Seven-star Alchemy Gods could be this arrogant.

No one dared to offend a Seven-star Alchemy God. Once offended, one could only feel endless regret. Their cultivation could only rely on luck in the future!

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s face was extremely ugly, standing there, at a loss on what to do.

The others were also secretly startled. They all did not think that the normally incomparably lofty Empyrean Loneswan was actually so respectful toward Ye Yuan.

Empyrean Void Sword hurriedly stepped forward to be a mediator, saying with a smile, “The two of you, don’t get angry. Since Master Ji is Empyrean Loneswan’s master, then he naturally has genuine ability. Younger Sister Ice Cloud, you also have to fix your temper.”

Empyrean Ice Cloud gave a cold snort but did not dare to make a sound anymore. But she still had a stubborn look on her face, not having the intention of backing down.

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh and said, “I know that everyone questions my strength, but how can my ability be what you can imagine! As long as you all can pool together enough spirit medicines, this Ji will create ten Empyreans for you, where’s the difficulty in that?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces revealed disbelieving expressions.

Which of them did not corroborate their Dao as Empyreans after narrow escapes, bathed in bloody slaughters in this Northernmost Steppe.

How could Empyrean powerhouses be created as you wished?

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s face had an even more apparent sneer.

But this time, she learned to be smart and just smiled coldly and did not speak.

“Heh, you all don’t put on those expressions. That day when I had the alchemy battle with Master, I didn’t open my furnace. But do you all know what grade was Master’s Earth Nether Imprint Pill?” Empyrean Loneswan said with a cold smile.

Empyrean Void Sword said hesitantly, “What grade was it? Could it have been ... superior-grade?”

Another Empyrean said, “Heaven-grade?”

“Huhu, you all see for yourselves!”

Empyrean Loneswan laughed coldly and threw a small bottle to Empyrean Void Sword.

Empyrean Void Sword caught the medicine bottle curiously. The others all stared at all, similarly having curious faces.

Looking at Empyrean Loneswan’s appearance, could it be divine-grade?

Except, they denied this notion very quickly. How was this possible?

Earth Nether Imprint Pill was a level nine medicinal pill. They knew that Empyrean Loneswan could at most only refine high-grade.

Even if this Ye Yuan was formidable, he was also merely a Six-star Alchemy God. At the very most, it was also just peak heaven-grade.

Empyrean Void Sword probed with divine sense and his expression suddenly changed wildly, looking at Ye Yuan with a horrified face, as if he had seen a ghost.

“Brother Void Sword, just what grade is it?”

When everyone saw his expression, they became even more curious.

Could it really be divine-grade?

Void Sword threw the small bottle to another Empyrean and said with a sigh, “Brother Huiming, you see for yourself!”
