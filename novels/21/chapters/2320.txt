Chapter 2324: Provocation!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A white phantom tore through the starry sky and went straight into the starry web.

The white phantom glimmered, like a ghost, giving people an extremely strange feeling.

“Hahaha, bring it on! This time, I’ll send you on your way!”

When Yuan Zhen saw Ye Yuan come over once more, he was not angry but was overjoyed instead.

Ye Yuan challenged them continuously. Although he got seriously injured, it could still be regarded as that he retreated unscathed.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s approach of rushing looked like he was toying with them.

No matter how your floodwaters surged, I remain steadfast and unmoved!

The shame of the divine race powerhouses was successfully stirred up by Ye Yuan.

One had to know, Ye Yuan was facing 36 thousand people alone!

“Yuan Zhi, you and I team up to cast Hell Suppressing Heavenly Star. This time, we must eradicate this punk!” Yuan Zhen said.

Another one of the hubs, Yuan Zhi, immediately responded, “Okay! This brat is too cocky. We must kill him this time!”

The large-scale spell jointly cast by two great hubs, that was the combined strike of 6000 people!

This level of power was simply terrifying to behold.

Below the starry sky, an enormous cage suddenly descended, enveloping Ye Yuan all at once.

Then, the entire cage was seen shattering into pieces, and space collapsed!

Inside the cage, space shattered, forming one fragment after another, shimmering away like crystals. It was very beautiful.

This was also the origin of the Hell Suppressing Heavenly Star.

But this scene was endless despair when it landed into the eyes of the human powerhouses! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Second Sage!”

A feeling of sorrow spread in the human camp.

The terrifying undulation coming from above the void made the human powerhouses quake in their boots.

The power of the Hell Suppressing Heavenly Star was likely several times greater than before!

Under those attacks previously, Ye Yuan already sustained serious injuries, let alone this time!

They saw it clearly. Ye Yuan did not escape that region of space at all and that he was enveloped tightly by the Hell Suppressing Heavenly Star.

Under such circumstances, Ye Yuan had no possibility of escaping at all.

“Hahaha ... this time, see if you still don’t die!”

Yuan Zhen’s laughter came from above the void.

“Who asked you to show off! Who ask you to posture! This time, see how you still posture!”

“An ant-like human also dares to provoke the noble divine race?! Death isn’t regrettable!”

... ...

Ye Yuan’s actions were actually merely in order to seek a path of survival. Even so, him assaulting the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art time and again looked more like posturing to the divine race.

Killing Ye Yuan now was very satisfying in their view.

But right at this time, amidst the luscious Hell Suppressing Heavenly Star, a white figure slowly walked out.

All of the divine race immediately shut up!

The faces full of mocking smiles turned into shock.

This scene was too inconceivable!

Ye Yuan was clearly already an arrow at the end of its flight previously. So how could he walk out of the Hell Suppressing Heavenly Star?

This question echoed in the minds of all the divine race powerhouses.

More importantly, this scene was too pretentious in the view of all the divine race powerhouses!

When the human powerhouses saw this scene, they were incomparably roused.

As long as Ye Yuan did not die, they had a glimmer of hope.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan took another step out and started moving about within the boundary of the starry web once again, the intent of provocation extremely strong.

When Yuan Zhen saw this scene, his lungs were about to explode from anger.

This time, Ye Yuan’s intent of provocation was too obvious.

That meaning was like saying, you come and hit me, come and hit me!

Yuan Zhen gnashed his teeth in hatred and shouted angrily, “Kill for me! Extreme Space Annihilation!”

The void exploded, terrifying energy and Heavenly Dao power shook in the void.

This time, Yuan Zhen was truly enraged!

One terrifying attack after another exploded in the void. The Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art’s various spells were displayed, sending out astonishing undulations.

And inside the void, a white phantom was indeterminate, shuttling back and forth inside.

This time, Ye Yuan was not like before, retreating after charging once. Now he kept on swaying in front of the starry web.

He shuttled back and forth in front of the various center pivot powerhouses. But no matter how terrifying the attack was, they were unable to touch him.

The more Yuan Zhen fought, the more alarmed he got, and he said in fury, “Attack together, can’t keep on letting him probe anymore!”

The other center pivot powerhouses were also extremely alarmed, immediately working in concert with Yuan Zhen.

This Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art, all of the center pivot powerhouses had their minds connected to know what the others were thinking.

Ye Yuan’s current actions made them palpitate with anxiety and fear.

Hence, they no longer cared about other things and planned on joining hands to cast the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art’s strongest move!

Grand Spatial Rend Art!

The power of this move was extremely horrifying. Once cast, even Deva Fourth Blight powerhouses would need to avoid it.

Of course, such a powerful attack also had huge disadvantages.

Once this move was executed, everyone’s strength would be drawn out too much.

Within a short time, the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art would fall into a period of weakness.

Of course, this weakness was relative.

The power of over 30 thousand people combined together, no matter how weak, would not be that weak.

A burst of apocalyptic power oscillated endlessly in the void.

The horrifying to the extreme spatial source power rose mightily amidst the spatial turbulent flow.

This surge of horrifying power made the expressions of all the human powerhouses change wildly.

Too strong!

Suffocatingly strong!

This power was not even weaker than Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest they all!

To these Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, this burst of power was too terrifying.

“Lord Second Sage, quickly come back!” Ji Mo roared wildly at the void.

There was seemingly a pair of large hands continuously tearing at the spatial turbulent flow.

Space shattered once more, a massive spatial storm surged up in the darkness, like a spatial tsunami was stirred.

Unbelievably terrifying explosion sounds reverberated throughout the whole world!

However, Ye Yuan did not retreat. He was still dashing about amidst the spatial storm, like a surfer in a tsunami.

However, the tsunami got larger and larger, and increasingly terrifying. Ye Yuan’s figure flickered inside, shaking people to the core as they watched.

On the other side, Originguard sensed something and looked toward the starry web in surprise and said, “This kid is really amazing enough, to actually force out the Grand Spatial Rend Art!”

Medicine Ancestor and Wing two people were currently already covered in blood all over, their injuries extremely severe.

Seeing this scene, the two of their eyes lit up, revealing hopeful looks.

Originguard looked at him and could not help laughing as he said, “Put away your unrealistic hopes! Once the Grand Spatial Rend Art is executed, the void will be annihilated and everything will return to silence. How can a mere brat like Ye Yuan be able to resist it?”

The spatial storm became more and more violent, and increasingly hair-raising.

Ye Yuan’s figure was gradually engulfed by the tsunami, and never surfaced again.

Yuan Zhen and the rest panted heavily, their complexions pale as they let out a long sigh in relief and said, “This guy is finally dead!”

On the humans’ side, the hope that just ignited was utterly extinguished by the Grand Spatial Rend Art.

But right at this time, a weak voice suddenly sounded out in the crowd.

“Everyone, listen to my command! After three breaths of time, everyone must use their strongest move and attack the direction that I point at!”

The one speaking was precisely Ye Yuan!

Everyone did not know when he actually returned to their side. Furthermore, appearing in the crowd.

But hearing what he said, everyone’s hearts turned somber, all getting ready.

Ye Yuan ignored others and began counting down!
