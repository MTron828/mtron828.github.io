Chapter 1357: Kicking a Metal Plate

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The old man furrowed his brows, clearly not recognizing Wang Song for a moment.

“You’re a student of Wu Meng Academy?” said the old man in puzzlement.

Wang Family went forward to bow and said, “Student Wang Song, Brightraise City’s Wang Family’s disciple, an inner-court earth camp student. I was fortunate to have attended Teacher Xiao’s alchemy lesson before.”

The old man came to a realization and said, “So that’s how it is. Looking at your appearance, you should be carrying out a mission outside, right? Why did you get into a conflict with the Myriad Treasure Tower?”

Wang Song could not help being alarmed when he heard and hurriedly pointed at Ye Yuan and said, “Teacher, don’t misunderstand it. I didn’t get into a clash with the Myriad Treasure Tower, but that punk killed my younger brother. I came to find him to take revenge! He’s Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s guest alchemist and not considered a member of the Myriad Treasure Tower ...”

He knew that this one in front of him was Wu Meng Capital City’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s chief alchemist!

This old man was precisely Xiao Feng who came from afar!

He ran to the Myriad Treasure Tower to kill people and just happened to get caught by him in the act. How could he not explain clearly?

This one’s status in Wu Meng Capital City was too high. Even Wu Meng Academy hired him to be a guest teacher.

Him dealing with the Myriad Treasure Tower, it was fine if his teacher did not encounter him. However, the latter happened to come across him!

Wang Song was currently talking and discovered that Xiao Feng’s expression became very ugly, and even though that his teacher was outraged on his behalf. He could not help feeling pleased with himself inwardly.

He believed that his teacher would stand on his side.

After all, Ye Yuan was not considered the Myriad Treasure Tower’s people, while he was considered as Xiao Feng’s student.

“Is his name Ye Yuan?” Xiao Feng asked with a solemn face.

Wang Song was currently talking. Suddenly being cut off by Xiao Feng, he could not help choking up and said with a nod, “That’s right. He’s called Ye Yuan.”

Xiao Feng’s expression changed and no longer bothered with Wang Song. He hurriedly came before Ye Yuan and said joyfully, “You’re Ye Yuan, Little Brother Ye?”

Everyone was collectively petrified!

An Origin Deity Realm powerhouse called Ye Yuan as Little Brother Ye?

The most shocked was none other than Wang Song.

Other people did not recognize Xiao Feng, but Wang Song knew his status in Wu Meng Capital City.

Even the City Lord Manor had to look to him for help!

In Wu Meng Capital City, Origin Deity Realm powerhouses were not easily found, but there were still always some around.

But peak Three-star Alchemy Gods could be counted on one’s fingers!

Even Wang Song himself held this teacher in esteem too.

But now, his teacher actually addressed Ye Yuan as his brother.

This was too subverting!

In that tone, it even carried a trace of ... respect!

That was right. It was respect!

Ye Yuan did not know Xiao Feng and could not see through his depths either. He just said coolly, “You’re the Three-star Alchemy God that the Myriad Treasure Tower sent?”

Xiao Feng froze and said, “You knew that I was coming? This old man is Xiao Feng, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s chief alchemist. Uh ... I’m also Wu Meng Academy’s guest teacher.”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s gaze swept toward Wang Song, Xiao Feng supplemented a sentence.

He was very astonished. When Ye Yuan saw him, there was no surprise in his gaze at all, as if everything was within expectation.

A Three-star Alchemy God, even an ordinary Three-star Alchemy God, also rarely condescended to capitulate their standing, and come to Jewelhill City, this kind of place.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said, “Are you carrying healing medicinal pills on you?”

Xiao Feng froze again, but seeing the heavily injured Yang Rui, he understood very quickly. He fished out a medicinal pill, handing it to Ye Yuan.

“If the medicinal strength of Three-star divine pills, he definitely can’t withstand it. I only have this Two-star high-grade Divine Healing Pill on me. The medicinal strength might be quite strong, so let him take half,” Xiao Feng said rather embarrassedly.

Xiao Feng as a peak Three-star Alchemy God, why would he carry that many Two-star medicinal pills on him? That was also too deigning.

A Two-star Divine Healing Pill was already the lousiest medicinal pill on him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan received that Divine Healing Pill and broke the medicinal pill into two halves for Yang Rui to consume before saying, “Thank you very much, Master Xiao Feng!”

This scene made everyone endlessly envious.

That was a Two-star high-grade divine pill. Even if one had money, they could not buy it in this Jewelhill City too.

“What background does this Ye Yuan have? That old man is the Myriad Treasure Tower’s chief alchemist! Such a major figure is actually so courteous toward a junior!”

“Speaking of which, this Ye Yuan is really incomparably mysterious. A puny little middle-stage Grotto Profound actually subdued a middle-stage Two-star evil spirit.”

“Yeah! There’s even the Essence Cultivating Pill! Ah, do you guys think ... this old man wouldn’t be here for the Essence Cultivating Pill, right?”

“Very likely! This medicinal pill is too incredible! It’s impossible for the Myriad Treasure Tower to not be moved. Heh heh, the Wang Family’s people were arrogant and domineering. With this, they kicked a metal plate!”

...

There was a lot of discussion in the crowd, guessing close to the mark as well.

It was just that they never would have dreamed that Xiao Feng coming to find Ye Yuan was actually to learn how to refine the Essence Cultivating Pill from him.

A peak Three-star Alchemy God finding a One-star Alchemy God to learn pill refinement, no one would believe it even if it was spread out.

The expression of Wang Song by the side was incomparably ugly. He knew that Ye Yuan could not be killed today.

But Xiao Feng being here, he did not dare to leave either. It was truly unbelievably awkward.

What was laughable was that he still said that he wanted to demolish the Myriad Treasure Tower previously and kill Ye Yuan. Now, the big talk was utterly too big and could not be taken back.

The medicinal pill that Xiao Feng refined was indeed powerful. The injuries on Yang Rui’s body took a turn for the better very soon.

He struggled to get up, and then he respectfully gave a deep bow toward Xiao Feng, saying, “Jewelhill City’s Tower Lord, Yang Rui, pays respects to Elder Xiao!”

He was similarly incomparably shocked in his heart. He was previously still half-dubious, half-believing of Ye Yuan’s words. He did not think that upstairs actually sent Xiao Feng, this big shot, here!

Yang Rui knew that Xiao Feng was Wu Meng Capital City’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s pillar.

He was still secretly speculating in his heard. It wouldn’t be that even Elder Xiao could not refine the Essence Cultivating Pill either, right?

It was very likely!

If Elder Xiao could refine it, upstairs probably would not send people over.

The more he thought, the more astounded Yang Rui got.

“En, it’s been hard on Tower Lord Yang.”

Toward Yang Rui, Xiao Feng just nodded his head nonchalantly. This was still looking on account of Ye Yuan’s face.

Normally, Yang Rui did not have the qualifications to meet him at all.

Xiao Feng turned to Ye Yuan again and asked, “Little Brother Ye, I wonder what’s with this incident here today?”

One was his student, one was the Myriad Treasure Tower. He naturally had to figure things out properly and not deal with it casually.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “The right and wrong, the entire Jewelhill City is all very clear. His younger brother’s death is nobody’s fault but his own, can’t blame others!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan briefly recounted the matter of the Wang Family, making Xiao Feng frowned heavily.

Xiao Feng shot Wang Song a glance and said furrowed brows, “Wang Song, I wonder if you have anything to say?”

Wang Song’s expression was very ugly. Chen Yongnian did not say so detailed in the message. He just said how cruel Ye Yuan was, killing his younger brother.

Anger rushed to his head, and he immediately rushed over.

But he did not expect the whole story of the incident was actually like this.

However, in his heart he did not feel that Wang Su did anything wrong.

His younger brother wanted to kill, you should stick your head out and let him kill!

But, at this moment, he had no choice but to lower his head too.

He knew that this one in front of him could not be offended!

As for Ye Yuan, he could only give the matter further thought.

“It ... It was this student who didn’t figure out the whole story. When I heard that my younger brother was killed, I was unbelievably resentful and indignant in my heart. I directly rushed over,” Wang Song said unwillingly.

“Since it’s your fault, then apologize to Little Brother Ye and let this matter drop!” Xiao Feng said coolly.
