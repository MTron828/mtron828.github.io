Chapter 1307: Inviting Humiliation?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Elder Feng, how is it?”

Inside a box room of the Myriad Treasure Tower, Ye Yuan being anxious and fretful was asking Feng Ping who was currently taking Liang Wanru’s pulse.

Feng Ping was Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s chief alchemist. Under Manager Su’s recommendation, he agreed to diagnose Liang Wanru’s pulse.

Ye Yuan was currently a so-called Alchemy God, but he could only refine Divine Essence Pills. Regarding Liang Wanru’s situation, there was nothing he could do about it at all.

Feng Ping shook his head and said with a sigh, “Miss Wanru’s body is that of a mortal, but she’s suffering from a divine rank slow-acting poison. How can her body endure it? Right now, the poison has already entered the viscera, and is about to reach the heart!”

Ye Yuan’s expression could not help changing when he heard that. He did not have divine essence currently and was unable to help Liang Wanru diagnose her pulse.

But this poison entering the heart, he, as an experienced alchemist, naturally knew how dangerous it was.

No matter how weak the poison, as long as it entered the heart, then it was difficult for even immortals to save!

“Elder Feng, could it be that there’s no other way?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

Feng Ping shook his head and said, “To detoxify this poison, it must be a one-star divine-grade Detoxification Pill! In this Jewelhill City, there’s still no one capable of refining a one-star divine-grade Detoxification Pill!”

A divine-grade Detoxification Pill, that was truly a god-like existence.

Forget about being in Jewelhill City, even a two-star alchemy god might not be able to refine it either.

Divine-grade medicinal pills required absolute strength plus heaven-defying luck before one could refine successfully.

By the side, Manager Su also sighed and said, “I know this girl. Although she can’t talk, her disposition is very pure. I didn’t expect that Liang Mingyu actually did this kind of tiger eating its own cubs thing, truly utterly devoid of conscience!”

Elder Feng revealed a disdainful look and said, “Liang Mingyu this person is too snobbish. Back then, in order to draw close to the Wang Family, he married Wang Pianran before his wife’s corpse was cold. It has always been passed down as a joke in this Jewelhill City.”

Manager Su suddenly had a look of wanting to speak but swallowing the words back, but it drew Ye Yuan’s attention.

“Manager Su, do you have any way that can save Wanru?” Ye Yuan hurriedly asked.

Feng Ping gave Manager Su a glance and said, “Don’t think about it, it won’t work.”

Manager Su said, “Yeah, Ye Yuan, this path truly can’t work. Better not say, in case you are troubled by it.”

Ye Yuan said curiously, “Where did this come from? Manager Su, Miss Wanru is this Ye’s benefactor, no matter how difficult the matter, this Ye is willing to go do it too!”

Feng Ping smiled and said, “This matter, you probably really can’t do it.”

Ye Yuan had a puzzled look. Manager Su let out a sigh and said, “The poison that Miss Wanru is inflicted with is called Poisonfeather Thousand Night. It’s the Wang Family’s non-transmissible secret. This kind of poison, as long as it doesn’t enter the heart, the Wang Family’s Wang Lingbo can treat it!”

“That Wang Pianran is precisely Wang Lingbo’s biological sister!”

Ye Yuan’s brows knitted together. Feng Ping and Manager Su’s meaning was already very obvious.

This was the Wang Family’s poison; only the Wang Family could cure it.

And the Wang Family was precisely Wang Pianran’s maiden family!

Have Ye Yuan go and beg the Wang Family?

Ye Yuan going to the Liang Family this time to abduct people and even had Luo Jian seriously injure the second elder and Liang Mingyu, the grudge was already set in stone.

With Wang Pianran that woman’s ruthlessness, how could she possibly let her own brother save Liang Wanru?

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath and asked Feng Ping, “Elder Feng, how long can Miss Wanru still last?”

Feng Ping thought about it and said, “That’s hard to say. Probably the latest is also tomorrow!”

Ye Yuan’s face fell, and he asked again, “Elder Feng, Ye Yuan wants to request a one-star heaven-grade Detoxification Pill from you, is it allowed? Of course, this Ye don’t want it for free either. This Ye can use a hundred heaven-grade Divine Essence Pills to compensate.”

Feng Ping gave Ye Yuan a glance and said smilingly, “According to what I know, you seem to only know how to refine Divine Essence Pills currently, right? Do you plan to refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill yourself? Give up! There’s absolutely no way!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I’ll go to the Wang Family, if they agree to hand over the antidote, it’s naturally a happy ending. If they don’t agree ... then there’s only this Ye taking action myself!”

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone greatly astonished.

They had already discerned that he was an extremely proud person from this incident of Ye Yuan forcefully breaking into the Liang Family.

This matter of lowering his head to people, it should be that he absolutely would not do it.

Moreover, everyone had a score in their hearts that even if Ye Yuan deigned himself, the possibility of the Wang Family agreeing was virtually zero.

For the sake of Liang Wanru this lass, Ye Yuan was actually willing to suffer such humiliation!

“Ye Yuan, have you thought clearly?” Manager Su was visibly moved as he said.

But Ye Yuan smiled broadly and said, “Miss Wanru suffered such a tribulation because of me. She had a life-saving grace to me, why would I, Ye Yuan, not throw this face out? Even if there’s only a feeble ray of hope, this Ye have to give it a try too!”

Everyone was visibly moved. They did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually such a loyal and sentimental person!

Elder Feng and Elder Su were both extremely shrewd people. They had long seen through that Ye Yuan’s gaze when looking at Liang Wanru was without the slightest lust, indicating that he did not have presumptuous ideas towards Liang Wanru.

Then Ye Yuan was doing this just in order to repay the kindness!

At this time, Ye Yuan felt the corners of his sleeves more. Turned out that it was Liang Wanru who pulled it.

Lowering his head to take a look, he saw that two clear streams of tears were flowing down Liang Wanru’s eyes.

Even though she was very weak at this time, her mind was still clear.

Ye Yuan was actually willing to suffer such humiliation for her, she was very upset in her heart.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Miss Wanru, you don’t have to be like this. This Ye has a score in my heart. You rest assured, this Ye will definitely save you!”

Liang Wanru nodded slightly, but her emotions were somewhat agitated.

...

“Brother, you have to stand up for me this time! You don’t know how arrogant that brat who’s surnamed Ye was at that time! He didn’t place our Wang Family in his sights at all ...”

At the Wang Family’s residence, Wang Pianran was just like a machine gun, besmirching Ye Yuan in front of Wang Lingbo.

Wang Lingbo stood with his hands behind his back, quietly listening to his sister’s complaints, but did not express anything. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He knew this younger sister’s temperament. It was already pretty good to have 10% of everything she said to be credible.

Furthermore, how could the Liang Family’s matters need Wang Pianran to sow discord?

He knew long ago!

“Pianran, you tell me honestly, just what secret is there on that Ye Yuan’s boy’s body?” Wang Lingbo said with a heated gaze.

Wang Pianran was stunned when she heard that, her gaze started becoming evasive.

“Brother, you ... what do you mean?”

Wang Lingbo said with a smile, “Pianran, a married woman should stand by her man, this is correct. But don’t you forget, who was the one who gave you your position in the Liang Family! The Liang Family can be pulled, but ... also have to be struck! Do you think that Liang Mingyu obeying you in every way is really because you have power over major issues?”

Wang Pianran was suddenly startled. Only then did she realize that Elder Brother definitely executed many means behind her back these few years.

Liang Mingyu was hesitant to take action in fear of damages, and that was why he would please her in every way!

“Brother, I ... I ...”

Wang Lingbo’s one sentence made Wang Pianran completely flustered.

In term of schemes, she was far too lacking!

“The more stable the Wang Family’s position in Jewelhill City, the more pleasant your little days will be! Wouldn’t you say so?” Wang Lingbo still said with a smile.

Wang Pianran nodded her head woodenly.

“So, just what secret is there on that boy’s body?”
