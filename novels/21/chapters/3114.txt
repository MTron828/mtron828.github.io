Chapter 3113: Apocalyptic Tribulation, Start!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Progenitor Bloodstone sized Ye Yuan up rather interestedly and did not feel angry.

“Want my life? This Dao really wants to know what right do you have to want my life! This Dao is already invincible under the heavens!” Bloodstone said coolly.

He was not showing off anything. He was just stating a fact.

Indeed, he no longer had any threat until this sky.

Let alone that Ye Yuan still had a tribulation that could not be overcome!

!!

“You corroborated your Dao with the blood of all living creatures, bringing a catastrophe to the 33 Heavens! It defies heavenly harmony and must suffer the wrath of Heaven!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

“Hahaha … Violates heavenly harmony? What’s wrong with exchanging the lives of a bunch of ants for this Dao to attain Great Dao? Moreover, this shouldn’t have come out of your mouth, right? Ye Yuan brat, you probably still don’t know what tribulation you shall be experiencing, right? The 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse is a calamity of Heaven’s condemnation! For countless years, the strongest person only made it to the ninth tribulation! Divergent cultivators are people who are spurned by Heavenly Dao! Heaven wants to eradicate you. You have no choice but to die!” Bloodstone said with a light laugh.

The expressions of Mi Tian and the others changed.

However, Ye Yuan did not panic like they had imagined.

He just said coolly, “If heaven wants to destroy you, it will definitely drive you insane first! You think that you’re invincible but don’t know that Heavenly Dao understands! You won’t have a good outcome!”

Progenitor Bloodstone smiled sinisterly and charmingly as he said, “Ignorant brat! This Dao is the envoy of Heavenly Dao. Why would Heavenly Dao deal with me? Ye Yuan, you’re the only person that could make this Dao suffer losses several times. This Dao respects you. I’ll let you die with dignity! Alright, since this Dao is the envoy of Heavenly Dao, I will be executing justice on behalf of Heavenly Dao now, and then I will send you on your way! Rest assured, this Dao will … destroy this world!”

The expressions of everyone in the world became fearful.

With Ye Yuan standing in front of Progenitor Bloodstone, it was simply striking a rock with an egg!

The current Ye Yuan still remained at peak Emperor Sakra Heaven. What would he use to deal with Progenitor Bloodstone?

“Ye Yuan, quickly come back! You can’t deal with him by yourself!” Mi Tian shouted angrily.

“F*cking hell! This guy didn’t bring me along when playing the hero!” Yang Qing also shouted coldly and was about to charge out of the realm.

When everyone from the blood race saw this scene, each and every one sneered coldly.

Today, no one could stop them!

The blood race would be the 33 Heavens’ royal lineage from now on!

All lives were ants!

“Heh, a bunch of ants who are struggling on their deathbed! Displaying their slight skill in front of Progenitor, what a joke!” Chi Hu said with a cold laugh.

“An ant trying to shake a big tree, overestimating their own ability! Does Ye Yuan think that it’s very brave for him to die? From now on, who will still remember Ye Yuan? Only my blood race will rule the myriad worlds!” Yi Xue said with a heroic spirit.

Progenitor Bloodstone did not even need to move his fingers to kill people.

The corners of his mouth just smiled evilly and charmingly. The aura of the Great Dao of Blood directly rolled toward Ye Yuan.

The Great Dao of Blood was invisible and intangible. It could not be blocked at all!

Just one thought, and it could blow Ye Yuan up.

Bang!

With a muffled groan, a figure flew out!

“This … What’s going on? There’s actually someone who can hurt Progenitor in this world?”

“What kind of hex did Ye Yuan use? Why is he completely fine? This is impossible!”

“It’s merely a thought for Progenitor to kill someone! What on earth happened? Could it be that Ye Yuan is even stronger than Progenitor?”

… . .

All of the bloodkins fell into immense shock!

Because this muffled groan was not emitted by Ye Yuan, but it was by Progenitor Bloodstone!

Progenitor Bloodstone seemed to have suffered a heavy blow, directly being sent flying out by the backlash force.

And from start to finish, Ye Yuan did not move a muscle!

The figures of Yang Qing and the rest directly stopped in midair, looking at this scene with blank faces.

This was also too freaking supernatural!

This scene truly made people feel incredulous.

The invincible Progenitor Bloodstone was actually sent flying!

The key point was that they did not even know what had happened.

Only the unknown could make people afraid.

An invincible existence was actually defeated by an Emperor Sakra Heaven. How could this not shock people?

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Seems like you aren’t qualified to kill me yet!”

The moment these words came out, everyone was even more confused.

And at this time, Progenitor Bloodstone barely managed to stabilize his figure, his expression extremely ugly as he said, “It turns out that you felt it long ago!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Regarding my tribulation, I naturally understand it best! You call yourself the envoy of Heavenly Dao. Didn’t Heavenly Dao tell you this? Wanting to kill me, it also needs Heavenly Dao to take action itself. Who the hell do you think you are?”

Everyone was dumbstruck with shock!

Progenitor Bloodstone was actually injured by Heavenly Dao!

With this, everything was clear.

It turned out that Ye Yuan was envied by Heavenly Dao. Currently, his tribulation was near at hand. Heavenly Dao absolutely did not allow anyone to intervene!

At this time, with Progenitor Bloodstone making a move against Ye Yuan, he was looking for a rebuff. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ye Yuan’s life was Heavenly Dao’s!

All of a sudden, chaos rolled, and dark clouds gathered overhead, making people somewhat unable to catch their breath.

Everyone felt that the sky seemed to be brewing an extremely terrifying storm.

Ye Yuan’s clothes fluttered.

Clearly, he was the center of the storm!

Everyone backed away unconsciously, afraid of being swept in.

It was because this pressure was truly too terrifying!

These people in front were seemingly able to feel the wrath of Heavenly Dao!

The 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse was finally here!

Progenitor Bloodstone looked at Ye Yuan and said hatefully, “Fine! Then this Dao will watch with my own eyes how you die under Heavenly Dao!”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Others can’t overcome it, but it doesn’t mean that I can’t overcome it! I, Ye Yuan, have never resigned myself to fate when cultivating from a mortal until now! So what if I am a divergent cultivator? So what … if it is an apocalyptic tribulation? If Heaven wants to exterminate me, I’ll kill this Heaven!”

Boom!

Amidst the chaos, a clap of thunder suddenly rang out.

It was as if Heaven was feeling furious at Ye Yuan’s words!

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan with immense shock.

This guy was really too arrogant!

Killing Heaven!

This sort of words, even if one reached Progenitor Bloodstone’s level of realm, one would also not dare to say it!

“Scatter! Quickly scatter! This apocalyptic tribulation is too terrifying, don’t get swept inside!” Someone clamored in the blood race.

Everyone retreated one after another. The pressure of this apocalyptic tribulation was getting more and more terrifying. They felt that they had not retreated far away enough yet!

“Heh, killing Heaven! Really overestimating your own ability! This Dao controls a Dao and is already invincible in the world. Want to kill Heaven? It’s simply a fool’s talk! He probably still doesn’t know what Heaven’s might is like! But it doesn’t matter. Very soon, he’ll understand how ignorant he is!” Progenitor Bloodstone said with a cold laugh.

The more one reached his level of realm, the more they understood the unfathomable nature of Heavenly Dao.

No one knew what Heavenly Dao was.

But all the heavens and myriad worlds were operating under the rule of Heavenly Dao.

This was indisputable!

What right did Ye Yuan, a mere ant, have to fight for fate with Heaven?

At this time, there was only Ye Yuan alone left in the massive chaos space.

The others all retreated far away, not daring to come over.

Ye Yuan alone was standing before Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s boundary wall, his clothes fluttering, akin to a lonely hero.

Yang Qing’s expression changed, and he said, “This guy, he wants to protect Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven with the apocalyptic tribulation!”
