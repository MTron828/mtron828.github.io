Chapter 1826 Three Moves are Too Many, Just One Move

14 True God level sects, 64 disciples gathered on the practicing field.But everyone’s attention was on the Shadowmoon Sect, on Ye Yuan.

Yi Qingxiang felt these gazes that had ill-intentions and could not resist somewhat feeling fear.

“Elder Xu, why ... why are they using this kind of eyes to look at us?”

Elder Xu said coolly, “Staying in Upper Groove Court with our strength will naturally arouse their displeasure. One has to know, even the High Clarity Sect doesn’t have the qualifications to stay in it. In a while, you guys have to be careful.”

Yi Qingxiang and Jiang Xueyan’s faces immediately became very ugly. These few days, they had all obtained considerable benefits cultivating in Upper Groove Court.

But this benefit obtained had a price too.

This kind of treatment that did not match one’s status was very easy to arouse other people’s displeasure.

This was what they did not take into account previously.

“This ... This is all Ye Yuan’s fault!” Jiang Xueyan said gloomily.

Yi Qingxiang also complained, “Yeah, this guy just loves to stand in the limelight!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he could not help shaking his head and laughing in spite of himself.

This was human nature, when it was beneficial to them, they would feel that it was natural and right. But once a problem occurred, they would feel that it was all your fault.

But Baili Qingyan was indignant and said with a cold smile, “That day when you guys checked in, weren’t you still dancing merrily with joy? If not for Ye Yuan, you all would have to stay in the woodshed! As a True God level sect’s disciples, this is your bit of pitiful dignity?”

At this time, Little Tong was hugging Treasure Pig had a childish voice, but behaved like a senior as he said, “Do the two of you still want face or not? Did Ye Yuan beg you guys to stay inside? Or is it that you guys feel that with your strength, as long as you’re not targeted, you can get the qualifications to enter the temple?”

The two people could not help choking up when they heard it. This little devil was not old but did not give any face when talking.

The two people exchanged a glance, and both fell silent.

What Little Tong said was right, even if not targeted, it was also impossible for them to get the qualifications to enter the temple.

Hearing that Ye Yuan was going to take part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, Little Tong was very interested and insisted on coming no matter what.

Each Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave would have a fixed number of 64 people participating.

As for the allocation of places, it was allocated to the various major sects according to the sect’s strength by the temple, by taking into consideration the circumstances.

This quota was not fixed, but in the recent few sessions, High Clarity Sect, Ruyi Sect, and a few other major sects, each one of them occupied seven to eight spots.

The places of the other weaker sects reduced in turn.

The Shadowmoon Sect possessed four spots. It was considered not few, but actually, there was basically not much hope.

After all, among the 64 people, there were only a mere five final spots.

The Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave was a fierce battle, the conclave would last for several months, even as long as a year.

The disciples taking part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave would fight battles. Every day, only five matches were carried out, all the way until all of the people finished fighting.

Finally, the five people with the highest victory rates were eligible to enter the temple.

This kind of fierce fighting was a test to all the disciples, and also the opportunity to all disciples.

Disciples able to come to the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave were the best among the various major True God level sects. Not one was mediocre.

Even those sects that were weaker similarly could not be underestimated. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In the matches in the past, there was no lack of examples of some powerful sects’ disciples being brought down by small sects’ disciples.

Furthermore, over the period as long as several months, some people would learn from other people’s strong points, their strength advancing by leaps and bounds, even charging into the top five in the end.

It was not that this did not happen before in the past.

Du Rufeng held a rectangle-shaped jade tablet and said in a clear voice, “Alright. Now, everyone, inject divine essence into this jade tablet. The jade tablet will automatically help you all generate a number and automatically pair.”

The Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave this time was presided over by precisely him.

When the group of disciples heard that, they sent out their divine essence one after another.

For some time, divine essence with all kinds of colors flew everywhere in midair, and finally injected into the jade tablet.

After everyone injected their divine essence, the jade tablet suddenly erupted with rays of brilliant light, emitting a light.

On the light screen displayed everyone’s numbers.

Ye Yuan searched it for a bit and discovered that his number was actually in the last place: No. 64.

In the crowd, someone suddenly burst into laughter and said, “Hahaha, a genius who stayed in Upper Groove Court is actually No. 64, how hilarious!”

“Really shameless! This bit of strength and he also has the face to stay in Upper Groove Court. If I were him, I’d have long moved away!”

With him laughing, quite a few people all guffawed along with him.

The words were full of ridicule towards Ye Yuan.

Everyone knew that for the Shadowmoon Sect to be able to stay in Upper Groove Court was entirely because Ye Yuan hit it off with that pig.

Actually, he did not have the qualifications to stay in Upper Groove Court at all!

Ye Yuan felt baffled and asked Xu Yan, “What’s so funny about No. 64?”

Xu Yan had not spoken yet when Little Tong interjected, “You aren’t from the outside world, right? To not even know this? The jade tablet in Du Rufeng’s hand is called Profound Realm Tablet. It can accurately determine your realm through your divine essence. You’re No. 64, which means that your realm is the lowest among these 64 people! Who do you think they should mock if not you?”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he came to a realization, only then, becoming aware of this jade tablet’s prowess.

This thing was simply a demon revealing mirror, making you bare everything!

Similarly, initial-stage First Firmament Celestial Deity, each person’s realm could not possibly be exactly the same too.

Cultivation realm was linear. Cultivating one more day, there was a possibility of being that trace higher than other people’s realm.

Of course, because of differences in cultivation methods and differences in talent, cultivation speed would vary.

Suddenly, the light screen showed dense text once more.

Du Rufeng said, “All of your matches are already displayed here. Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave started officially from today! Don’t want to have your match, you can decide not to attend. If you miss your match, you’ll be issued a loss!”

Finished talking, Du Rufeng even glanced at Ye Yuan meaningfully.

Someone exclaimed, “Eh, that kid’s fight is tomorrow. His opponent is ... High Clarity Sect’s He Yuan!”

Ye Yuan’s existence was even more resounding than High Clarity Sect’s Yang Shen and the Ruyi Sect’s Luo Zhen.

Straight away, everyone saw his opponent in the first round, faces revealing gloating expressions one by one.

“Heh, this kid is really unlucky, encountering He Yuan in the first round!”

“Although He Yuan is High Clarity Sect’s last place, he’s also peak First Firmament Celestial Deity. Furthermore, his strength is much stronger than other sects’ same rank martial artists!”

Just as everyone was discussing animatedly, a youth in purple came before Ye Yuan and said with a look of amusement, “Upper Groove Court’s genius, tomorrow, you have to give guidance! Make sure not to concede defeat too quickly. Otherwise, everybody will be disappointed. How about ... three moves?”

“Hahaha ...” A wave of laughter came from all around.

This youth in purple was naturally He Yuan without a doubt.

Except, he did not come over to greet, but to intentionally humiliate Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Three moves are too many, just one move!”
