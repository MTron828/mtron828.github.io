Chapter 2542: Painstaking Care and Thought!

When Tang Yu heard this, his hair stood on end.

He was really afraid that Lu Yun would smack the two of them to death in his rage.

However, Lu Yun did not.

He was not as angry as Tang Yu imagined, but very calm instead.

“Don’t you worry. With this old man around, no one can touch the Tang Family!” Suddenly, Lu Yun said such a thing.

Tang Yu opened his mouth wide with a look of disbelief.

This was Master Yun!

Even His Majesty also had to show him some respect when he saw him!

In this Eastward Country, if he stomped his foot, the entire country would have to tremble.

Now, he actually compromised toward Ye Yuan!

Furthermore, the meaning in these words was that he was actually even going to shield the Tang Family!

Tang Yu somewhat doubted whether his own ears heard wrongly or not.

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “What do you want to obtain?”

Lu Yun shook his head and said, “I don’t need anything. Just one thing, Second Prince will maintain a cooperative relationship with the Tang Family in the future!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Can!”

Hearing Ye Yuan agree, Lu Yun’s expression eased up slightly and he said with a faint smile, “Young Friend Ye, if you’re free in the future, you can go to the royal family to find this old man! This old man has once traveled around various countries and still know quite a bit about True Yang Heavenly Domain’s local customs and practices.”

Ye Yuan’s eyebrows raised up, and he said with a smile, “Elder Lu, rest assured. This Ye will go when I have time.”

Lu Yun nodded slightly and left with a faint smile.

Tang Yu’s mouth had never closed until now.

He was dumbstruck with amazement by the contents of these two people’s conversation!

The three people present were all extremely clever people.

Lu Yun and Ye Yuan seemed to have only exchanged a few words, but had already crossed swords back and forth several times!

Firstly, Lu Yun made known his position that no one could touch the Tang Family.

The meaning of these words was that he, Lu Yun, would be the Tang Family’s protective cover in the future.

Not Second Prince, it was Lu Yun! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This concept was totally different!

Second Prince’s status was high, but in front of the Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum Lu Yun, it was nothing!

With him as a guarantor, even if His Majesty wanted to touch the Tang Family, he would also have to think thrice before acting.

This was a huge bargaining chip!

However, Ye Yuan asked Lu Yun what he wanted.

Lu Yun did not want anything, just for the Tang Family to cooperate with Second Prince.

It was cooperate!

Not a vassal!

Let alone a lackey!

This sentence was equivalent to raising the Tang Family’s status to a position equal to that of Second Prince.

Tang Yu was not stupid. He naturally understood that the Tang Family did not have this qualification.

Then who?

Ye Yuan!

Actually, Lu Yun wanted to kidnap Ye Yuan onto Second Prince’s chariot to help Second Prince seize the throne.

But Lu Yun understood that with Ye Yuan’s pride, it was absolutely impossible to agree.

However, it did not matter if he did not agree.

As long as the Tang Family was tied onto this chariot, would he still be afraid Ye Yuan would not take action at the critical moment?

Of course, Ye Yuan was not a fool either, it was impossible to not be able to tell Lu Yun’s intentions.

However, Ye Yuan still agreed.

Only like this did Lu Yun set his mind at ease.

In the end, he even invited Ye Yuan to the royal palace, which was tantamount to a discussion among peers.

From start to end, Lu Yun was clinging onto Ye Yuan!

Or should he say, he lowered his social status, wanting to find a good helper for Second Prince!

“B-Big Brother!” Tang Yu already did not know what he should say.

He only knew that he made the right bet!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I make clear distinctions between grievances and gratitude. This is what your Tang Family deserves.”

Tang Yu knelt onto the ground with a thud and said to Ye Yuan with cupped fists, “Big Brother, you’ll always be my, Tang Yu’s, big brother in the future!”

Calling out ‘Big Brother’ in the past was being forced by Ye Yuan.

Later, it was in order to curry favor with Ye Yuan.

But now, this ‘Big Brother’ came from the bottom of his heart.

From now on, not only did the Tang Family not decline, it was very likely to become one of the top major clans of the imperial city instead!

… …

“Master Yun, why?” On the way back, Second Prince could not resist asking.

Lu Yun said coolly, “Do you know why Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s native powerhouses reject ascenders?”

Second Prince was taken aback and said with disdain, “Why else? Lower Realms ants also dare to contend for glory with the bright moon! They don’t even have affinity, indicating that they are people who are abandoned by heaven. Couldn’t we despise them?”

But Lu Yun smiled slightly and shook his head and said, “What you said is the perception of most people. But I don’t think so! This old man feels that native powerhouses are jealous of ascenders, that’s all!”

Second Prince was stunned again and could not help laughing as he said, “Master Yun, you couldn’t have made a mistake, right? Us? Jealous of them? Just like that Ye Yuan, he cultivated bitterly for 18 years and only learned the extraction of one type of heavenly medicine with his intelligence. What’s there for us to be jealous of?”

Lu Yun nodded and said, “You’re right. They indeed don’t have our nature-endowed advantage. But it’s also precisely because of so that this is their greatest advantage! You only know that Five Light Heavenly Region survives between the crevices of the other heavenly regions. Then, have you thought before on what basis can a measly little Five Light Heavenly Region survive among the many native heavenly regions?”

Second Prince was stunned again and again. He had really never thought about this problem from this angle before.

Lu Yun gave him a glance and said, “Because they are very strong!”

Second Prince could not help laughing as he said, “Strong? Master Yun, I admit that Ye Yuan is an exception! But the other ascenders are simply akin to ants!”

Lower Realms shook his head and said, “You’re wrong! The ascenders in your impression of being weak are just because they just ascended and haven’t adapted to a supreme world like Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. And this period is also the most vulnerable period for ascenders. However, once they pass this most difficult period, their strength will become very terrifying! Being able to reach Heavenly Stratum in the Lower Realms planes, which of these people don’t have countless bones and corpses under their feet? Their temperament, talent, they are all one in a million! As long as give them a chance, they will be able to soar to the sky with one leap!”

“Back then, when this old man traveled all over the various states and nations, I saw an itinerant cultivator ascender challenge five same rank powerhouses with the realm of middle Lesser Sublime Heaven, and killed three of the other party, and injured two in the end! This old even had seen before an upper Lesser Sublime Heaven ascender went head-on against a grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven native powerhouse, and he defeated him! This is just one of those that I’ve seen. The examples that I’ve heard are even more! Therefore, you should understand how terrifying the strength of ascenders who are able to reach Five Light Heavenly Region alive are, right?”

The corners of Second Prince’s mouth twitched slightly, his eyes revealing shock.

Clearly, these were things that he had never heard of before.

Eastward Country was just content to exercise sovereignty over a part of the region; that was all. The things that he was able to come into contact with were too few.

“Master Yun’s meaning is that Ye Yuan has already tided over the most difficult period? That’s right! His strength is indeed very strong! He can even defeat upper Lesser Sublime Heavens!” Second Prince recalled the scene of Ye Yuan defeating Zhao Yu two people and said with a solemn expression.

However, Lu Yun shook his head and said, “You’re wrong again! It’s not that Ye Yuan has tided over the most difficult period, but that he’s an extremely strong existence among ascenders too! Comprehending spatial rule isn’t scary. What’s scary is that he applied spatial rule to the transcendent realm! He’s a dragon among men. A tiny little Eastward Country can’t trap him! With his help, your chances of defeating that elder brother of yours will greatly increase!”

Second Prince’s entire body trembled. Only then did he know of Lu Yun’s painstaking care and thought!
