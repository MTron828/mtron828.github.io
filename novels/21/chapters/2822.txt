Chapter 2828: Decisive Battle Begins, Heaven One’s Desperate Situation!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

More than a dozen figures were currently moving swiftly through the air.

The great battle was at an explosive point!

‘These dozen over figures were naturally the 15 Emperor Realm powerhouses from Heaven One.

“I say, we pinned all of the hope on a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven. Isn’t it taking things a little too trivially?” Lu Feng said.

Lu Feng was the Heaven One army’s number three figure, his status second only to Dan Fei and Zuo Chen.

“although Ye Yuan joined the alliance not long ago, he rendered amazing merit and created too many impossible miracles! This current situation, apart from gambling, we have no other choice either!”

“Huhu, Wei Liang, didn’t you turn your nose up at Ye Yuan before? Why are you speaking up for him now?” Dan Fei scoffed.

Wei Liang’s old face turned red, and he said, “Either way, I feel that this boy is confident!”

Lu Feng snorted coldly and said, “How can a mere middle Saint Sovereign Heaven possibly destroy the spatial passageway? Want to destroy the spatial passageway? It has to at least gather the full power attacks of 5000 Saint Sovereign Heavens before it might be achieved!”

Dan Fei nodded and said, “Over at Ye Yuan there, it’s just a solution borne out of desperation. This seat doesn’t harbor much hope. The Saint Sovereign Heaven army has no hope in the first place as well. The most important thing is still our side! At that time, I’ll tie down two Emperor Vast Heavens and

create a chance for you all. Once there’s a chance, you guys immediately get out of the battlefield and go destroy the spatial passageway!”

Hearing this, everyone fell silent.

They knew that Dan Fei was planning to exchange for a glimmer of opportunity with death!

suddenly, figures flashed, and more than ten figures blocked the way.

Dan Fei’s expression turned dark and he said in a cold voice, “Li He, this battle, there’s no rest until we’re dead!”

The one in the front was precisely the blood race’s leader, Li He!

“Dan Fei, you and I are also considered old acquaintances already. Can we still not know each other? With our strength, we can at most just perish together. But, after you die, this seat won’t die!” Li He said with a relaxed smile.

There were only so many Emperor Realm powerhouses. Dan Fei and Li He were old enemies too, knowing each other through and through.

If an ordinary Emperor Realm powerhouse was threatened like this, then they would definitely have some fear.

But this kind of threat was not considered a threat to the blood race at all.

It was because they could not kill the opponent!

“Humph! Whether or not you’ll die, we’ll only know after fighting!” Dan Fei gave a cold yell and was about to attack.

But Li He was not in a hurry and said smilingly, “No rush, no rush, Dan Fei. Your opponent isn’t just this seat alone! This time, this seat even found you an opponent!”

While speaking, there was a vibration in the void. Another elegant figure stepped out of the void.

Seeing the arrival, Dan Fei’s pupils constricted, and he sucked in a breath of cold air and said, “Lotuswear!”

Awoman was dressed in blood-colored long robes, giving people a cold but breathtaking feeling.

She looked at Dan Fei, using a talking-down tone as she said coolly, “Dan Fei, this seat has come over, so you absolutely have no chance to destroy the spatial passageway. Give up on this! Withdraw now, and this seat can still leave you with your life!”

Dan Fei’s expression was extremely ugly, and he said in a solemn voice, “Dream on! Even if I die, this seat also won’t let your blood race succeed!”

Lotuswear was indifferent and said coolly, “Forgot to tell you, but Lord May has already entered the passageway. He will arrive in at most a day!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of all of the Heaven One powerhouses changed wildly!

May was one of the blood race’s Emperor Sakra Ten Heavens!

Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm, the top 100 ranks were called Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons.

While Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm similarly had a ranking, it was Emperor Sakra Ten Heavens!

Emperor Sakra Ten Heavens, they were the strongest ten people in Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm!

These ten people were major figures whose reputation could truly shake the heavens, their strength formidable to the extreme.

May was ranked tenth!

He was a famous butcher, his strength being incredible. The Heaven One powerhouses that died in his hands were too many to count!

May entering the spatial passageway indicated that the spatial passageway was already very stable.

‘The blood race sending him over, it was to play the role of stabilizing the world.

If he really came over, then this battle had no suspense anymore!

“If you feel that you can take the passageway away from this seat’s hands within a day, then you can very well come and give it a shot,” Lotuswear still said coolly.

But Dan Fei was already burning with anxiety in his heart!

‘There was absolutely no hope for him regarding this.

Lotuswear’s strength, he was clear about it. She was even 30% stronger than Li He!

These two great heavyweights joining forces, their side here had absolutely no hope.

‘Then there was only counting on the Saint Sovereign Heaven army that side?

But, with the current stability of the passageway, 5000 people might not be able to take it down too!

Even if they could take it down, could they get through?

Could it be that heaven truly wanted my Heaven One Continent to perish?

Awave of despair could not help rising in Dan Fei’s heart!

Suddenly, a figure flashed across his mind.

Ye Yuan!

He said that he could destroy the spatial passageway. Could he really do it?

No, it was impossible!

A measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, it was simply impossible to destroy such a stable spatial passageway!

But this boy had created miracles time and again.

Maybe this time, he could do it too?

No idea why, a tiny hint of hope sparked in Dan Fei’s heart.

He hoped that this boy could really create a miracle!

Suddenly, his gaze turned cold, and he shouted fiercely, “Everyone, follow me to kill the enemy! For the sake of Heaven One’s glory, there’s no regret in dying!”

“No regret in dying!”

All the Emperor Realm powerhouses called out in unison, charging towards the blood race!

“Hahaha … You bunch of blood race trash! Your Grandpa Yang said before, after breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven, I’ll definitely kill you all until you cry for your daddy and mummy! Weak! Too weak!”

Above the void, it was a melee.

‘The Heaven One army and the blood race army fought in close quarters. The killing was extremely tragic.

In this battle, both sides had to conquer or die. There was no path of retreat at all. Each soldier was fighting for their life!

Yang Qing’s long spear was imbued with a soaring resolve, killing the blood race’s three great True Sovereign Heaven until they steadily lost ground.

Hence, he started showing off again.

The last time, after Ye Yuan administered treatment for him, Yang Qing had blessings come to him in the disguise of misfortune and finally broke through the final layer of windowpane paper, breaking through to the True Sovereign Heaven Realm. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After reaching True Sovereign Heaven, Yang Qing’s combat power soared and could directly deal with middle True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

Now, he was fighting three great peak lower True Sovereign Heavens by himself. He overwhelmed his opponents until they could not catch their breath.

Just as he was being pleased with himself, a dragon roar cut across the firmament, smashing towards one of the True Sovereign Heaven.

Boom!

That lower True Sovereign Heaven was directly smashed into a cloud of blood mist!

“Great Commander Ye Yuan is mighty and domineering!”

“Great Commander Ye Yuan’s combat power is unparalleled, dominating the world!”

Kill, Kill, kill! The blood race is merely a bunch of clay chickens and pottery dogs, KILL!”

After a punch, a series of frenzied cheering came over. The Heaven One army’s morale rose to the peak at once.

Currently, Ye Yuan had already become the spiritual pillar of the Heaven One army.

His every movement and action affected the morale of the soldiers.

This punch earlier, Ye Yuan killed a True Sovereign Heaven as a Saint Sovereign Heaven. How imposing and domineering was that?

Hence, the momentum soared!

“ARHH! Ye Yuan, you snatched Sovereign Azuresky’s limelight again! This sovereign won’t let you off!” Yang Qing cried out strangely.

Ye Yuan’s punch was indeed domineering just now. But, being able to kill a True Sovereign Heaven with one punch was because Yang Qing strained most of the opponent’s energy.

It was just that those soldiers did not care about these at all.

The person was killed by Ye Yuan. They acknowledged Ye Yuan.

Yang Qing was originally being pleased with his posturing but was overshadowed by Ye Yuan all at once. He could not help being depressed to the extreme..
