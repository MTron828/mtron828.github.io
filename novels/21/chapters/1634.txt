Chapter 1638 Too Courteous

“Ye Yuan, thank you!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Facing Ye Yuan, tears flowed down Zheng Qi’s old face.

Achieving his long-cherished wish made him feel as if a heavy weight was lifted from his mind.

Originally, he already lost all hope. It was Ye Yuan who pulled him out of despair.

The gratitude in his heart was already unable to use words to express. He could only say these simple four words.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Head Elder’s sincere heart, Ye Yuan admires it. This minor thing isn’t worth mentioning. This place isn’t suitable to stay for long. We’d better hurry up and leave.”

The two people returned to find Ning Tianping and the rest. Ye Yuan displayed spatial laws and brought everyone back above the cliff.

“Finally we can see the sun! This trip is really aggrieving!”

“Yeah, my realm was suppressed so much for no reason. It felt really awful!”

“All thanks to Elder Ye! Otherwise, probably none of us can escape this time.”

...

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s people all sighed with vicissitudes of emotion.

Life and death, two different worlds; they all, these elders and protectors, had never experienced such a dangerous place before.

It was not that those fierce beasts were powerful, but it was that their realms were being suppressed.

This kind of powerlessness made them feel terrible, feeling despair.

Luckily, they had Ye Yuan. That was how they escaped alive.

Although Heavenly Eagle Imperial City also had casualties this time, compared to the other imperial cities and itinerant cultivators, their losses were the least.

Therefore, they were grateful to Ye Yuan from the bottom of their hearts.

The party was just about to leave when suddenly, two figures flew over swiftly. They were precisely the Song Yu and Lei Yi who left and had returned.

The two of them joined hands and severely injured Ka Suo, but that guy still escaped.

Returning above, they were no longer restrained by the origin magnetic field, recovering to Celestial Deity Realm.

The two people consulted it over and turned back once more.

Ye Yuan looked at these two people with a smile that was not a smile and said coolly, “What? The two of you want to commit highway robbery?”

Song Yu said in a solemn voice, “Hand over the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain! Otherwise, you can forget about walking out of River Eternal Imperial City! Even if we can’t do anything to do, do you think that they can escape?”

Ye Yuan took out the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, held it in his hand, and said with a faint smile, “If you want it, then I’ll give it to you!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan lightly sent it with one hand. The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain flew towards the two with immense speed.

The two people did not feel the undulation of the power of laws at all and even thought that Ye Yuan really gave up.

The two recovered to Celestial Deity Realm. If Ye Yuan did not utilize the power of laws, this Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain did not pose much threat to them.

When the two saw this, they could not help being overjoyed, falling over each other to go and catch the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain.

However, when they touched the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, they only felt a tremendous force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas transmitting over.

Rumble!

“Puhwark!”

Caught by surprise, the two people were brutally struck, figures flying out.

And the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain suffered the counter-shock, returning to Ye Yuan’s hands again.

“You guys are really too courteous. Since you all don’t want it, then I’ll reluctantly accept it,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

The surrounding people were all dumbfounded with shock, looking at this scene with extreme astonishment.

Song Yu and Lei Yi were Celestial Deity powerhouses!

Even though they were heavily injured, Celestial Deity powerhouses were Celestial Deity powerhouses, existences that could not be defeated.

Now, they were actually smacked flying by Ye Yuan with a mountain!

The power of this enormous mountain was simply too terrifying.

Toward the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, everyone’s eyes became incomparably heated.

Except, Ye Yuan smacked two Celestial Deity powerhouses flying with a mountain. So how could they still dare to have designs on the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain?

Song Yu and Lei Yi’s insides were in upheaval currently, a breath stifled in their chests, unable to breathe. They could not speak at all.

They did not expect that the power of this toss could actually be so fierce.

Careless!

How could this punk possibly spit out the thing that he ate so easily?

But they also did not expect that this Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain was actually so heavy, to actually be able to smash them, Celestial Deity powerhouses, to heavy injuries.

Of course, this was primarily still because they were seriously wounded, their strength less than 10%.

Right now, they piled injuries on top of injuries and virtually could not move anymore.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists toward Ling Zikun and said, “Head Elder, we’ll be going back. There is no need to see us off.”

Ling Zikun’s expression was not too good either. After all, Song Yu was their grand elder.

It was just that he was being suppressed by Ye Yuan right now, how could he still dare to make a move?

Hence, Ye Yuan brought Heavenly Eagle’s people, boarded the flying boat, and left under everyone’s eyes.

...

The news of Ye Yuan seizing the precious treasure and returning astounded the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s upper echelons.

Apart from this, another news that roused people’s morale came over, Second Elder Xuan Yu broke through to half-step Celestial Deity Realm!

Clearly, this was thanks to Ye Yuan!

The higher-ups announced that Xuan Yu would replace Ruo Xu, becoming the Pill Tower’s head elder.

For some time, the top of the city walls showcased a big royal flag.

Hearing that Ye Yuan returned, Xuan Yu came to visit straight away.

“Huhu, congratulations, Head Elder!” Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said.

Xuan Yu scolded with a laugh, “You brat, still giving me this crap! If not for you, it’s impossible for me to break through too.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s all on Head Elder whose talent surpasses people. What has it to do with me? However ... Second Elder is probably unresigned to it, right?”

Xuan Yu sighed and said, “Isn’t that so? This old man doesn’t mind about empty reputation, but Ruo Xu is different. These days, he claimed to be sick and didn’t come out, practically in a state of semi-retirement already.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “If he didn’t react at all, then you’d have to be more careful. As for now, he can’t play any tricks either.”

Xuan Yu nodded his head. Regarding these things, he was really not adept at it.

But he did not come today for this matter. Hence, he furrowed his brows and said, “Zheng Qi actually used Crazed Sword Evanescent this move. Now, his realm regressed, longevity greatly damaged. I ... I’m also at a loss on what to do!”

Ye Yuan used rank three divine pills and preserved Zheng Qi’s life. But it could not let him recover back to new.

Currently, Zheng Qi’s realm directly fell to the initial-stage Divine Lord Realm. Furthermore, his lifespan did not have much remaining. He was already a cripple.

Xuan Yu had just become head elder, this naturally became a responsibility that fell on him.

But Zheng Qi’s losses this time were extremely great. Ordinary medicinal pills had no effect on him at all. Even if Xuan Yu had broken through his realm, he was unable to refine the necessary pills as well.

Refining peak rank four divine pills were not like refining rank three divine pills. For Xuan Yu to want to refine high-grade medicinal pills, it was virtually impossible.

Hence, he came to seek help from Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan also sighed when he heard that and said, “I’m unable to refine rank four divine pills right now, and am also at a loss on what to do! I’ll impart to you some methods. You only need to preserve Head Elder Zheng Qi’s life first. As for the rest, better wait for me to break through to the Divine Lord Realm before talking.”

Xuan Yu’s eyes lit up and he said, “Going out this time, you found the opportunity to breakthrough?”

Ye Yuan laughed bitterly and shook his head and said, “Honestly, I don’t have any clues.”

Xuan Yu got a shock when he heard that. Normally, with Ye Yuan’s heaven-defying talent, breaking through to Divine Lord Realm should not be difficult.

Even if he was temporarily unable to break through, it was also impossible to keep on not having clues to breakthrough!

“How is this possible? The cultivation method that you cultivate should be very powerful, breaking through to Divine Lord Realm should be something that happens naturally without additional effort!” Xuan Yu said.
