Chapter 1615 Brutalized to Tears

“Huu ... Huu ... Huu ...”

Gu Han panted heavily for air. His divine essence was already close to being exhausted, and he was tired until he was virtually collapsing from exhaustion.

But no matter how hard he tried, he could not touch the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves.

The surroundings were dead silent. Their breathings were virtually about to stop.

All along, they had heard that spatial laws were very powerful; one of the supreme laws.

But just how strong spatial laws were, they had not seen it personally.

But today, they truly witness the might of spatial laws!

No one doubted Gu Han’s strength. Being able to fuse two kinds of laws to this degree, his strength was already extremely daunting.

To say that he was undefeatable in the same rank was also not an exaggeration.

However, he still could not even touch a sliver of Ye Yuan’s sleeves!

Everyone understood. If Ye Yuan wanted to kill Gu Han, he would not survive within a single breath of time.

“T-Too strong! Are these spatial laws? Simply undefeatable!”

“Grasping space, all attacks can’t touch the other party at all, how to fight still?”

“No wonder it’s called a supreme law. This level of strength, it’s impossible for anyone to be Elder Ye’s match beneath the Divine Lord Realm!”

...

People came back to their senses, but now they had a clearer understanding of Ye Yuan’s might.

This level of strength, probably only the Divine Lord Realm’s world power could resolve it.

“I ... I lost! Sniff, sniff ... I lost!” Gu Han finally shed unwilling tears and conceded.

Yes, he cried!

Today, it was his most agonizing failure in several hundred years.

There had never been an opponent who made him so powerless before.

This made his self-esteem had an intense sense of setback.

Alchemy Dao, crushed until he was badly battered and bruised.

Martial Dao, could not even touch the corners of his sleeves.

Genius?

This was simply a joke!

When people saw this scene, each and every one of them was stunned.

They did not expect that Gu Han was actually brutalized to tears.

But thinking about it, they felt that it made sense too.

Peers encountering Ye Yuan was really a tragedy.

From the beginning, this was a mistake.

If not for this case, on what basis could Ye Yuan set on the throne of elders?

At this moment, people actually inexplicably had an additional trace of favorable impression toward this arrogant Gu Han.

Mn, also sympathy.

In this one month, the impression that Gu Han gave people was very impetuous and arrogant, very overbearing. The feeling that it gave people was very uncomfortable.

But looking at it now, he was merely still a child.

Even though Gu Han’s age was much younger than Ye Yuan, he clearly did not have Ye Yuan’s legendary experiences. He naturally could not possibly remain indifferent when granted favors or be subjected to humiliation like Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that Gu Han actually did something like this. After being momentarily dazed, he went up to pat his shoulder and said coolly, “Victory and defeat are common for soldiers. You only lost for a period of time, so it’s no big deal.”

Gu Han slapped Ye Yuan’s hand away and said with tears in his eyes, “I don’t need your pity! Are you trying to use the attitude of the victor to humiliate me right now? Dream on!”

This sentence made the hint of favorable impression that just appeared in everyone immediately vanish like soap bubbles.

But Ye Yuan did not get angry and said coolly, “Do you think that I have that need?”

Gu Han could not help choking when he heard that. He looked at Ye Yuan and opened his mouth, but he could not speak. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yeah, Ye Yuan was not someone in the same world as him at all!

His bit of pride was worth nothing in Ye Yuan’s eyes!

He was the Pill Tower’s elder, an apex figure of the imperial city.

While him?

He indeed had a lot of potential and might become River Eternal Imperial City’s apex figure in the future too.

But that was many, many years later.

His gap with Ye Yuan would only grow bigger and bigger along with the passage of time, and not shrink!

Ye Yuan looked at his expression and said with a smile, “You only saw my strength, but your don’t know what I’ve experienced. Strength never comes out of thin air, for me to be able to defeat you, it’s not just winning you in terms of talent. I admit that you’re indeed extraordinarily talented, but thousands and tens of thousands of years later, you might not be stronger than our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s disciples! Therefore, if you come to compare notes, we welcome it. But you were too overbearing when doing things, so we don’t welcome you.”

Only when Gu Han heard this did he know why Ye Yuan took action.

He suddenly realised it. Had he gone too overboard?

Winning one’s opponent and even deliberately humiliating the opponent, this kind of thing happening to anyone, they would not be happy either.

“I ... I was wrong!” Gu Han said in a low voice.

The sword-grasping man suspected whether he heard wrongly or not. Little Junior Brother actually admitted his fault to others!

Someone as proud as Little Junior Brother actually admitted fault to others!

Everyone exchanged glances, all dumbfounded.

This stubborn and unruly young man actually admitted his fault to Elder Ye!

Too awesome!

Ye Yuan looked at Gu Han and said with a smile, “Even if you win against all of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s genius disciples, I can’t be bothered to care about you either. But you won and even wanted to humiliate your opponent, I can’t put up with that. You’re slapping the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s face. I, as a Pill Tower’s elder, naturally have to make a move to teach you a lesson. Leave then, with your talent, your future prospects will be limitless. But if you keep on putting on airs and looking down on people like this, you’ll suffer a big loss sooner or later. Today, I only made a move to teach you a lesson, but your enemy probably won’t let you off easily.”

Gu Han gritted his teeth and said, “I ... Many thanks for Elder Ye’s teachings!”

Finished talking, Gu Han bowed three times to Ye Yuan respectfully, turned around, and left.

The sword-grasping man and the rest were scared of Gu Han meeting with a mishap and hurriedly followed after.

A senior apprentice brother said, “Little Junior Brother, you ... You don’t have to take it to heart. Victory and defeat are common fare for soldiers, next time, let’s just win back!”

Gu Han gave him a glance and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother, do you think that I have a chance to win him?”

That senior apprentice brother choked when he heard that. He very much wanted to say can, but he knew that if nothing too unexpected happened, Gu Han probably could not catch up to Ye Yuan for the rest of his life.

The disparity between them was not what hard work could make up for at all!

Gu Han suddenly turned around and said to the sword-grasping man, “Eldest Senior Brother, the precious treasure coming into being this time, I want to go too!”

The sword-grasping man was not too surprised and said with a smile, “I have no objections. But ... it still requires Master’s approval.”

Gu Han nodded his head, turned around, and left.

...

“Tsk tsk, Elder Ye is Elder Ye, really too impressive!”

“Yeah, that kid has been showing off these few days. Not only did Elder Ye brutalize him to tears, he even made him admit his fault obediently. Such means, I’m convinced!”

“Whatever kind of genius, once they meet Elder Ye, that’s a tragedy!”

“Haha, Elder Ye is simply a genius killer! In the past, Song Qiyang was like this. Now, this Gu Han was also like this.”

...

The news of Ye Yuan brutalizing Gu Han to tears made everyone talk with great gusto.

Ravaging Gu Han was within everyone’s expectations.

But they never thought that Gu Han actually took the initiative to admit fault in the end, his attitude sincere.

Such a stubborn and unruly genius, this simply made people’s jaws drop.

In the corner building, Ling Zikun finally heaved a long sigh and said to Ruo Xu, “Oh, Ruo Xu, it’s almost time. We should also talk about business.”
