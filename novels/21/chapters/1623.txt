Chapter 1627 One Against Five

if it was a normal circumstance, zheng qi was naturally not gao yuan’s match.

but gao yuan was currently wounded. it was not a minor injury, so his strength greatly diminished. meanwhile, zheng qi had the strength to fight.

zheng qi attacked with fury, each move not without targeting vital parts of the body.

gao yuan was not zheng qi’s match at this time at all, being repeatedly forced back.

when heavenstar saw the situation, he said with a stern cry, “kill ye yuan for me!”

how could the two forces still hold back, battling into groups one after another?

even though the fiend race plus utmost peace imperial city, they had the advantage in numbers, heavenly eagle imperial city won in that they virtually did not have any expenditure.

at peak state currently, dealing with those remnant soldiers and generals was naturally nothing difficult.

heavenly eagle imperial city’s dozen over people plus river eternal imperial city’s large numbers, both sides actually fought until they were evenly-matched.

however, in the end, ye yuan’s side was still lacking in numbers, missing five first-layered heaven divine lord powerhouses.

these five people surrounded ye yuan in the center, using gazes like looking at a dead person to look at ye yuan.

the person in the lead said in a solemn voice, “source night, during last time, there was the blood yama hall protecting you. so this fiend lord couldn’t do anything to you. but today, you must die!”

ye yuan gave him a glance and he asked confusedly, “do we know each other?”

that person said in a cold voice, “you don’t know me, but you killed the prince that i’m most proud of! today, this score, we should settle it!”

the moment ye yuan heard, he came to a realization.

it turned out that this guy was ka xin’s father, capone capital city’s city lord, ka long!

“huhu, my life is right here, take it away if you have the ability,” ye yuan said indifferently.

right now, gao yuan and heavenstar fought two on one, before barely managing to be roughly on par with zheng qi.

gao yuan glimpsed at this side and was immediately overjoyed.

five first-layered heaven divine lords dealing with an origin deity realm, even if he comprehended spatial laws, it was certain death too!

gao yuan laughed loudly as he said, “haha, that cocky brat is about to die right away. aren’t you going to save him? oh, right, you can’t go, hahaha ...”

zheng qi sneered and said, “ye yuan doesn’t need me to go and save at all!”

gao yuan chortled and said, “hahaha, don’t need you to go save? then who’s saving him? heaven? hahaha ...”

zheng qi smiled coldly and said, “you’d best take care of yourself first!”

even though the numbers were a bit much, zheng qi felt that the numbers were not a problem at all.

since ye yuan could kill a rank four fierce beast, then the number of people was not a deciding factor.

gao yuan’s punch seemed to have landed on cotton every single time. it was very depressing for him.

“brat, this fiend lord is here to take your life!”

ka long laughed savagely. lifting his hand, it was a punch, slamming over toward ye yuan.

this punch encompassed world power, the power extremely formidable.

ordinary origin deity realm martial artists were absolutely out of luck under this punch.

but sadly, ye yuan was not an ordinary origin deity realm martial artist.

ye yuan’s spatial laws unfolded, easily avoiding this punch.

the other four people knew that ye yuan knew spatial laws. they immediately blocked all of ye yuan’s paths of retreat, and they rushed over toward him.

with five great first-layered heaven divine lord realm powerhouses, violent world power reverberated in this region of space.

however, ye yuan did not have the intention of running away at all.

the moment junyi sword came out, sword energy crisscrossed!

rumble!

all of a sudden, ye yuan’s aura skyrocketed. one of the four people was caught off-guard and was directly sent flying out by ye yuan.

ka long and the other three people only felt their chrysanthemum[1] clench, being stunned by the scene before their eyes.

what did they see?

an origin deity realm martial artist sent a divine lord realm powerhouse flying with one sword?

this joke was not funny at all!

however, ye yuan did not give them time to be shocked. a sword arrived again, rushing over toward ka long.

a powerful sword energy pounced from head-on. ka long’s expression changed wildly, instantly bucking up 120% to deal with it.

rumble!

the collision of world power and sword energy, evenly-matched!

ka long’s heart shook violently and he roared, “everybody, don’t underestimate the enemy! this kid ... this kid has the strength to kill first-layered heaven fiend lord!”

this roar of his transmitted into everyone’s ears.

apart from heavenly eagle imperial city and gu han, the others were all shocked.

zheng qi smiled coldly and said, “saw that? ye yuan doesn’t need heaven to save him. he can save himself!”

gao yuan’s eyeballs nearly popped out. the shock in his heart could not be any greater.

how can an origin deity realm defeat a first-layered heaven divine lord?

hang on!

that fiend race fiend lord powerhouse said that ye yuan had the strength to kill a first-layered heaven fiend lord, and not to defeat one!

gao yuan keenly captured the intricacies in ka long’s words and was even more incomparably shocked in his heart.

“kill him! five of you rank four powerhouses, could it be that you can’t even take care of an origin deity realm?” gao yuan roared madly.

ka long’s face fell, very unhappy with gao yuan’s words.

a human actually dared to tell him what to do.

but now was clearly not the time to haggle over this. the most important thing right now was still killing ye yuan!

“everybody, be more careful, and play it safe! don’t give him any chance to take advantage of the situation!” ka long was also very experienced, immediately communicating with the other four people, changing the battle tactic.

the five people surrounded ye yuan and no longer advanced rashly like before, but planned on having a protracted battle with ye yuan.

but how could ye yuan be led by the nose by them?

his figure drifted from place to place, suddenly left and right, forcing the five people to teeter on their feet.

ye yuan’s misty sword art made a showy display of its ability, but each move’s trajectory could not be predicted, causing a tremendous problem to the five.

fortunately, the five people were all veteran rank four powerhouses. there were even two who were suppressed at the third-layered heaven divine lord realm, barely managing to persist in battle.

ye yuan fought one versus five and actually faintly took the upper-hand. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

gao yuan, heavenstar, di en, and the rest, they were all incredibly shocked in their hearts. they completely did not expect that the battle would develop into the current situation.

according to their plans, as long as they killed ye yuan, this battle could also end. everyone could search for treasures in peace.

but now, both parties were actually deadlocked!

puchi!

suddenly, blood splattered!

a moment of carelessness, that divine lord realm martial artist who was severely wounded by ye yuan previously was actually stabbed right through by ye yuan with a sword move. it was obvious that he was dead due to the move just now.

when ka long and the rest saw this scene, their scalps could not help tingling.

with five against one, not only were they not able to suppress an origin deity realm martial artist, the other party killed a person instead!

this result was simply fantastical.

when gao yuan and the rest saw this scene, their hearts shook violently too.

they all realized that ye yuan was not just a supporting cast among their party, but had a standing that belonged to himself.

under the situation where realms were suppressed, ye yuan could go one-on-five. this combat strength was sufficient to let him have a certain right to speak!

bang!

gao yuan shook off zheng qi and said in a cold voice, “stop! all don’t fight anymore!”

heavenstar and di en also stopped the fiend race powerhouses. this fierce fighting finally stopped.

zheng qi smiled coldly and said, “you want to fight and we fight, you want to stop and we stop, who do you think we are?”

gao yuan’s face fell and he said, “we already have heavy casualties! keep on fighting, nobody can think about getting the treasure! this old man admits that i’ve underestimated this boy! now, everyone, abandon your prejudices. wait until we find the treasure, it’s not late for everybody to fight it out again!”
