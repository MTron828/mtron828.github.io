Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bang!

Saint Exalt Waycloud thrust a palm out. The body of the corrupt corpse was directly decimated by half.

But the corrupt corpse did not care at all, and it still brandished its sword and charged over.

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s brows furrowed slightly, clearly feeling that it was troublesome to deal with.

The other Saint Exalts also took action one after another, planning on killing these corrupt corpses.

But another group of corrupt corpses rushed out from the flank.

The corrupt energy on these corrupt corpses’ bodies had virtually turned corporeal. Their strength actually did not pale in comparison to Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

The faces of the group of Saint Exalts changed. When their moves landed on the other party’s body, the other party was actually completely unscathed and just took a few steps back before charging over again.

Bang!

Waycloud and the other party exchanged a punch and were directly pushed away, flying out backward.

“Damn it, these corrupt corpses are impervious to swords and spears, untainted by myriad laws, they can’t be killed at all! Waycloud gritted his teeth and said.

Boom!

There was the sound of a dragon roar and a streak of sword light flashed past. The head of a corrupt corpse immediately exploded like a watermelon, and then it fell to the ground and stopped moving.

Everyone’s faces changed, looking towards Ye Yuan in amazement.

This sword was precisely released by Ye Yuan using the Dragon Spring Sword.

“The weakness of these corrupt corpses is their heads. Just chop them off will do!” Ye Yuan said.

Only when everyone heard that did they come back to their senses, all kinds of moves smashing toward the corrupt corpses’ heads desperately.

But it was easier said than done.

Although these corrupt corpses did not have much intelligence, they still had instincts. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

They protected their heads one after another, there was no way to break it at all.

Furthermore, even if those ordinary Jade Sovereign Heavens hit on the heads, they were unable to break it too.

Rather, it was the attacks of half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens that were fast and ruthless, that could break the heads of the corrupt corpses like Ye Yuan.

Everyone was extremely shocked, only then knowing that the power of Ye Yuan’s blow was already comparable to that of a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven!

This guy was just middle Jade Sovereign Heaven!

If Saint Sovereign Heavens did not emerge, his strength was actually already comparable to that of half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens.

The surrounding corrupt corpses got more and more. Furthermore, their strength got stronger and stronger.

At this time, peak lower Saint Sovereign Heaven corrupt corpses already appeared.

“Damn it, just how many corrupt corpses are there here? At this rate, we all have to die here!” Saint Exalt Skyfortune gritted his teeth and said.

Ye Yuan also frowned slightly. He finally knew what they all encountered.

This was just entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace, and there were already so many powerful corrupt corpses.

Going deeper in, it was bound to be even more dangerous.

“They seem to be forcing us into that passageway. We can’t go over! There must be even more powerful existences there!” Saint Exalt Purplesun said anxiously.

“Otherwise, what should we do? Entering is death, retreating is also death!” Saint Exalt Yuan Yi roared angrily.

“Senior, what should we do now?” Ye Yuan frowned and said.

Clearly, he felt the pressure too.

More than a dozen Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm corrupt corpses had already appeared around them. At this rate, the Saint Exalts would not be able to hold on any longer.

“Well ... let Big Yellow blaze a trail and head northwest direction, I remember back then there’s a Treasure Depository Pavilion there! If I didn’t guess wrongly, the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation should be there. That little fellow’s strength wasn’t very strong, it’s impossible to go very deep. Reaching that place is already the limit,” Mi Tian said.

“Big Yellow! There!” When Ye Yuan heard that, he gave a cold cry without hesitation.

Big Yellow received the order and his body started twisting.

Following that, a bull hoof suddenly kicked out. A Saint Sovereign Heaven corrupt corpse in front directly had its head blown apart.

Furthermore, the remnant momentum was unabated, the row of corrupt corpses at the back were all kicked flying.

Under Mi Tian’s guidance, Big Yellow’s Coquettish Profligate Hoof already attained a higher level. Its power could not be mentioned in the same breath.

Plus, his cultivation realm soared greatly. By relying on the Coquettish Profligate Hoof, even if he encountered middle Saint Sovereign Heavens, he had the power to fight too!

At this time, Big Yellow erupted with his full strength, and directly carved out a bloody path.

“Let’s go!”

The two people lunged and dashed out of the encirclement.

All the Saint Exalts were startled by this kick. Seeing Ye Yuan two people escape, they followed after without thinking.

“Follow!” Saint Exalt Waycloud shouted.

One figure after another galloped out. But those powerhouses that were being entangled fell into an encirclement again very quickly.

“ARGH!!”

“ARGH!!”

... ...

One miserable scream after another came over, those people were engulfed by the corrupt corpses very soon.

Among them even included a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

He was entangled by two Saint Sovereign Heaven corrupt corpses and failed to get away immediately, but fell into a heavy encirclement.

Hearing the miserable screams from behind, everyone did not dare to turn their heads back either and could only flee desperately.

“Roar!”

Right at this time, a boorish roar came from behind.

With this roar, the corrupt corpses at the back had an outbreak collectively and chased after this side frenziedly.

That corrupt energy, which swept up, made the faces of the Saint Exalts change wildly.

“Not good! This is a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven corrupt corpse. He already has intelligence! If he catches up, we’ll be dead for sure! These guys were driving us in his direction just now! Now, he has turned angry from embarrassment!” Saint Exalt Waycloud’s expression changed as he said.

They felt that there was an astonishing aura from behind that already reached the level of grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven.

If he caught up, these people would all have to die.

Originally, that corrupt corpse had cornered these people. Who knew that Big Yellow suddenly erupted, completely disrupting his deployment.

Hence, he got angry.

Grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven corrupt corpse, the speed was extremely fast.

In this narrow passageway, he looked like he was going to catch up.

“Kid, the lamp that’s diagonally right ahead is a restriction! Quickly go and turn it on!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he turned to the side, letting everyone escape first.

At this time, that grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven corrupt corpse was already near at hand.

When Ye Yuan saw it, he felt his scalp tingle too.

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan turned the lamp.

Buzz, buzz ...

That corrupt corpse’s claw was practically in front of Ye Yuan’s face already.

But right at this time, an extremely powerful restriction force appeared in the passageway.

Before that corrupt corpse had time to react, it actually directly turned into a wisp of black smoke and died!

As for the corrupt corpses following behind it, they also turned to ashes in an instant.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he drew a breath of cold air too.

What a powerful restriction!

A grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven corrupt corpse, how fearsome was its strength?

Most likely, even a human who was similarly grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven was not his match.

It was actually vaporized in an instant!

Only at this moment did Ye Yuan experience what was called powerful!

It would likely be a cinch for this restriction to deal with True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses too!

When those Saint Exalts saw this scene, each and every one of them slumped to the ground, having happiness from surviving a calamity.

“B-Brother Ye, t-thank you for saving us!” Saint Exalt Purplesun’s complexion was deathly pale as he said.

“Brother Ye, thank you so much!”

“Many thanks, Brother Ye, for not taking prior transgressions to heart and saving our lives!”

... ...

The Saint Exalts powerhouses gave thanks one after another.

Just now, it was really a hair’s breadth between life and death.

They almost caught up.

Saint Sovereign Heaven, the gap of a minor realm was too big!

Even if they joined forces, it was impossible to be a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven’s match too.

If not for Ye Yuan, they would have all been dead for sure.

Feeling the joy of surviving a calamity, how could they still have hostility toward Ye Yuan? There were only feelings of gratitude.

However, they were very surprised too. How did Ye Yuan know that there was an invisible restriction switch here?

Just now, if Ye Yuan wanted to plot against them, they would also be like that corrupt corpse just now, turning into ashes!
