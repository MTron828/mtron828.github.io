Chapter 2179: What Kind of Ant You Are!

With Ye Yuan as the center, a circular aura slowly pushed outward.

Under Ye Yuan’s aura, Lin Changqing’s world domain seemed like paper paste, directly being crumbled apart.

That feeling was like an egg meeting a rock.

Lin Changqing’s expression changed wildly, frenziedly urging his world power, attempting to block Ye Yuan’s advancement.

However, it was no use at all!

The two people’s engagement was like a strongman and a child pushing each other.

The strongman pushed the child completely one-sidedly.

The aura extended out very quickly, reaching a distance of 5000 feet.

This radius of 5000 feet was water-tight and impregnable. Ye Yuan was the sovereign!

Everyone looked at this scene in shock. They were unable to imagine why Ye Yuan’s domain would be so solid.

The Lin Changqing who was likewise a Second Firmament Empyrean actually did not even have the strength to fight back.

Lin Changqing’s himself, his eyeballs even popped out.

He looked at Ye Yuan with a stunned face, just feeling that his mind was somewhat numb and unable to wrap itself around this.

“You ... You ... Second Firmament Empyrean, this ... How is this possible?”

Lin Changqing somewhat doubted whether or not his eyes had problems.

He thought before, Ye Yuan was extraordinarily gifted and could break through to the True God Realm in a short thousand years.

He could even break through to the late-stage True God Realm.

But he never dreamed that Ye Yuan only used a short thousand years’ time to go from being a Celestial Deity to becoming a Second Firmament Empyrean!

Now, Ye Yuan was already standing on the same starting line as him!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s domain power was extremely condensed. It was clearly more than a level higher than him.

This indicated that Ye Yuan did not pursue speed blindly and disregard his foundation.

This ... How was this possible?

Zheng Yufeng also opened his mouth wide, with disbelief written all over his face.

Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing had always been called a monster in Fallen Maple Bodhidharma. His talent was extremely great and his cultivation speed extremely fast.

But his talent was simply trash in front of Ye Yuan!

“Remember that a certain somebody said before, I and Li-er and you, will never be people of the same world! You said it correctly! You and I will never be people of the same world!”

Ye Yuan’s words struck the heart directly, making Lin Changqing’s mind trembled.

The same sentence, but the meaning that it had was entirely different.

That was a kind of contempt that looked down from a height!

A thousand years later, Ye Yuan and his positions had quietly switched over.

He had never thought much of Ye Yuan before from the bottom of his heart.

An ant that came from an imperial city, how could he compete with him, this peerless heaven’s chosen that came from a Bodhidharma?

But Ye Yuan used Second Firmament Empyrean cultivation and shattered all of his pride to smithereens!

This was just a thousand years!

Another thousand years, what realm would Ye Yuan reach?

The 2000 years agreement ... was truly laughable!

A thousand years later, just based on his cultivation realm, Ye Yuan would be able to trample him to death like stepping on an ant!

Zheng Yufeng had a vacant look, he finally understood what Ye Yuan’s words when he entered the mountain meant.

“A thousand years later, I can even kill him by puffing out a breath. Is there still a need to compete?”

Yes, there was naturally no need to compete anymore!

A thousand years later, Ye Yuan would at least be at the middle-stage Empyrean Realm, or even a late-stage Empyrean Realm major power.

While Lin Changqing would at most be a Third Firmament Empyrean.

But even if Ye Yuan was only at the late-stage Empyrean Realm, smacking Lin Changqing to death with one slap would be sufficient.

So what even if fused together three kinds of law powers?

Suddenly, Lin Changqing seemed to have thought of something, his gaze turning intent.

Right, I still fused three kinds of law powers!

Even if he is Second Firmament Empyrean, so what?

In the same rank, I’m invincible!

He sucked in a deep breath, the proud demeanor on his body recovered once more, and he looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Good! Since your present realm already caught up to mine, then our life-and-death agreement can be brought forward in advance!”

These words were somewhat shameless, even Zheng Yufeng felt his face turn red.

He clearly knew that he would not be able to win a thousand years later, he wanted to bring the fight forward now, what was this if not shameless?

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Changqing, his eyes full of pity as he said with a light smile, “Are you sure?”

Lin Changqing smiled coldly and said, “What? Are you scared?”

Ye Yuan laughed loudly and said, “Lin Changqing, back then, when you came to Heavenly Eagle, you viewed me as an ant and said that I couldn’t match up to Li-er. Today, I’ll let you see that you’re just an ant in my eyes, and also just how powerful Li-er’s man is!”

Hearing Ye Yuan said it like this, Lin Changqing felt his jealousy peak.

He thought that by relying on his talent, he would be able to move Junior Apprentice Sister Meng Li one day.

He also knew that for so many years, Li-er’s heart had never wavered before.

And now, Ye Yuan even grew to the extent of making him fearful.

Looking at it now, these two people were so fitting.

He became a clown instead!

But at this point now, it was clearly not the time to want face anymore.

“Fine, since that’s the case, then let’s amend the divine soul contract and start the life-and-death wager now!” Lin Changqing said with a cold sneer.

But Ye Yuan shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “The ignorant are truly fearless! You’re still obsessing over the wager? That is no longer important! Isn’t your reliance having fused together three kinds of law powers? Now, I’ll stand right here, unleash your strongest strike. I’ll let you see what kind of an ant you are!”

Lin Changqing could not help being taken aback when he heard that.

Could this guy be a fool?

On Sunset Peak, a wave of snickering also came over.

“Where did this guy pop out from? Ran all the way here from afar to seek death?”

“Heh heh, strength is decent, but his head isn’t useful.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“In this world, I’ve yet to hear that in the same rank, someone dares to withstand an attack that fused three kinds of laws!”

... ...

After a thousand years of growth, Lin Changqing was no long no longer his goal.

Lin Changqing’s talent compared to Long Yuan was worlds apart.

Long Yuan was trampled underfoot by Ye Yuan, let alone Lin Changqing?

Killing Lin Changqing was merely a matter of snapping a finger.

Even if he really killed, Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple also would not dare to say much.

But this place was the Bodhidharma that Li-er was at any rate. Furthermore, it looked like Li-er should have received considerable benefits in this place.

Even though Lin Changqing was Li-er’s pursuer, he could tell that he had more of admiration toward Li-er and was not shameless like Long Hao.

If he really killed Lin Changqing, it would not be good for everyone, and it would also make things difficult for Li-er.

Therefore, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to kill him either.

However, Ye Yuan still wanted to let Lin Changqing know that not only was he, Ye Yuan, worthy of Li-er.

Furthermore, in this world, only he was worthy of Li-er!

Canceling the divine soul agreement, Lin Changqing was still somewhat in the clouds, feeling puzzled.

Could this guy really be a fool?

“Ye Yuan, have you thought carefully? If this sword of mine goes down, you’ll die!” Lin Changqing said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “I’m just letting you take a look at how great the disparity between you and me is!”

Lin Changqing’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Since you’re bent on seeking death, I presume that Li-er won’t blame me either! Bluecloud Truefeather Sword!”

One sword unleashing, three kinds of power of laws interweaved together, virtually slicing space apart.

The incomparably swift and fierce sword light slashed through the void and headed straight for Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back. Facing this astonishing sword, his expression did not change and his heart did not race, without the slightest intention of avoiding.

Bang!

The void trembled, the earth shook.

But Ye Yuan was as stable as Mount Tai, not budging an inch!
