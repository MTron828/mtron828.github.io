1836 Heavenly Dao is Heartless!

Han Jianqing’s eyes were bloodshot, already losing his reason.

He roared at Du Rufeng, “This brute killed six of my High Clarity Sect’s top disciples! Not killing him today, how will I give an account to the sect master when I go back?”

Du Rufeng said coldly, “That’s your business! As long as Ye Yuan didn’t violate the temple’s rules, no matter how many people he kills, it doesn’t matter too!”

Fresh blood kept flowing out of the corners of Han Jianqing’s mouth and he said in a cold voice, “The temple isn’t fair! The moment this Ye Yuan came, you all let him stay in Upper Groove Court, based on what? If say that Ye Yuan is a disciple that the temple groomed, then why didn’t you tell us beforehand? hy must you take such a path?”

Once a person lost their reason, the angle of thinking about problems became very extreme.

In Han Jianqing’s view, Ye Yuan was definitely a disciple that the temple groomed in secret. However, he was deliberately instructed to participate in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave. Wasn’t this nauseating people?

Du Rufeng’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “Han Jianqing, keep talking nonsense and slandering the temple, you’ll bear the consequences yourself!”

At this time, several figures appeared next to Du Rufeng. These were all the temple’s elders. All of them were True God Realm powerhouses.

Seeing such a line-up, Han Jianqing seemed to have a basin of cold water splash down overhead.

One Du Rufeng and he was not a match already, let alone so many True God powerhouses.

“I’m ... unreconciled to it!” Han Jianqing roared angrily.

Du Rufeng’s expression eased up slightly and he said coolly, “The Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s original intention was to let the disciples who enter the temple obtain more harvests and stimulate greater potential. The reason why it doesn’t forbid killing is to let them let loose. But actually, situations where massacres are caused are exceedingly rare. This time, it was originally you all who initiated trouble first but want to blame others. What logic is this? Right and wrong, everyone has a weighing scale in their hearts. I believe that no need me to say anymore and everyone is also clear in their hearts!”

When everyone heard that, they secretly nodded their heads.

This matter was indeed provoked first by the High Clarity Sect. But the result now was that the arm could not twist the thigh, and wanted to vent their anger on Ye Yuan.

In reality, at first, everyone indeed felt bitter about the Shadowmoon Sect staying in Upper Groove Court. They had unhappiness in their hearts.

But by now, they had long already tossed this kind of thinking to the back of their minds.

Ye Yuan possessed incomparably powerful martial strength and also possessed superb alchemy skills. He indeed had the qualifications to stay in Upper Groove Court.

Moreover, they all knew that the cause of all these was the Treasure Pig.

Even though they all did not know what the Treasure Pig was, without a doubt, its origins were not ordinary.

Du Rufeng’s gaze was scorching as he said, “Han Jianqing, on the account that you were rash for a moment, you’re spared from death! But you insulted the temple. Death penalty can be spared, but it’s hard to escape punishment. Today, you’ll be expelled from the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm and return to the sect to be confined for a thousand years, not to leave the mountain! Do you submit?”

Han Jianqing’s face turned ashen, and he raised his head to the sky and heaved a long sigh as he said, “Forget it, Han Jianqing accepts the punishment!”

In the Bamboo Groove Void Realm, no matter how powerful the sect, they could not contend with the temple too.

The temple was a paramount existence.

Because they had Empyrean powerhouses!

This battle ending, the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s situation became even more complicated and confusing.

Yang Shen was already dead, he was naturally unable to become the temple’s disciple.

This way, the struggle for the second camp became abnormally fierce.

While Ye Yuan also tasted his Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave loss because of the fight with Yang Shen.

This coma of his lasted ten days and nights, directly missing the next fight, and was issued with a loss.

However, even if he lost, he still firmly occupied the throne of first place.

Furthermore, everyone all knew that they were no longer able to shake Ye Yuan’s position.

...

Ten days later, Ye Yuan finally slowly opened both eyes.

“You’re awake!” When Baili Qingyan saw Ye Yuan wake up, she could not help being excited.

Little Tong’s face also showed a rare smile and said with a faint smile, “Like I said, this kid won’t die, but you guys don’t believe.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes looked a little confused, the gaze that looked at Baili Qingyan was somewhat unfamiliar.

That unfamiliar look gave Baili Qingyan a fright.

“What? You ... You don’t even recognize me anymore?” Baili Qingyan’s face changed and said.

But very soon, Ye Yuan’s eyes recovered clarity and he said with a smile, “Ha, S-Senior Apprentice Sister Baili what, why would I not recognize? Maybe the time that I was in a coma was a little long, and there’s some issues. Unleashing that martial technique is still a pretty big burden on me.”

Only then did Baili Qingyan feel relieved and said with a smile, “I really didn’t expect that even the Yang Shen who comprehended time laws died in your hands!”

By the side, Yi Qingxiang also said, “Ye Yuan, you aren’t aware of this, but when our Shadowmoon Sect disciples go out now, we really feel extra proud. This is all thanks to you!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

No matter where, people respected the strong and looked down on the weak.

Thinking about Zhu Wen’s attitude when they first came, it truly felt like a lifetime had passed.

Now, Zhu Wen’s attitude towards them already underwent a 180-degree great transformation, addressing them as brothers on every occasion.

And all these stemmed from the talent and strength that Ye Yuan displayed.

After sending everyone away, Ye Yuan’s expression became somewhat ugly.

“You seem to be not quite right!” Little Tong said.

Ye Yuan was taken aback when he heard that and forced a smile as he said, “How so? I’m completely fine right now.”

Little Tong looked intently at Ye Yuan and said in a childish tone, “I can feel that a subtle change happened to you. But as for the specifics of what the change is, I can’t pinpoint it either.”

Ye Yuan looked at Little Tong rather surprised, this kid’s eyes were so discerning!

He let out a sigh and said, “You saw the Divine Vestige Space?”

Little Tong nodded his head and did not speak.

He naturally saw the Divine Vestige Space. Furthermore, that Divine Vestige Space gave him an extremely dangerous feeling.

Ye Yuan continued: “This martial technique seemed to have affected my temperament!”

Talking up to here, Ye Yuan’s expression also became solemn.

Recalling the him inside the Divine Vestige Space, Ye Yuan felt very unfamiliar with the former.

The him at that time was like an ice-cold machine, not having the slightest emotion.

Even if he recovered now, Ye Yuan could feel that the him at that time affected the current him.

About this matter, Ye Yuan could not quite understand it.

Logically speaking, the Divine Vestige Space was a product of the Chaos Heavenspan Canon after cultivating to rank five. It was the accessory of this cultivation method and should not have this kind of sequela.

But why would this kind of strange situation occur?

Could it be that the Chaos Heavenspan Canon he cultivated had a problem?

Ye Yuan could not figure out after racking his brains!

He also communicated with Dustless about this situation, but Dustless was at a loss too.

When Little Tong heard that, his brows furrowed too and he said, “This martial technique of yours is indeed formidable. I sensed a strong Heavenly Dao aura within. Clearly, this Divine Vestige Space of yours hasn’t reached grand completion yet. But you have to know one thing ... ‘Heavenly Dao is heartless’!”

Ye Yuan’s face changed, and his brows were practically knitted together as he ruminated further. “Heavenly Dao is heartless? Heavenly Dao is heartless! How could this be?”
