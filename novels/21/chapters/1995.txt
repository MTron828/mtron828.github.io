Chapter 1999: Lowly Commoner

Although this was on a bustling street, the entire city was incomparably quiet. Only this pleasant-sounding voice was reverberating.

Lu Ziyi walked over lightly just like that as if a heavenly maiden descending upon the mortal world.

That appearance made all life topple.

But in the eyes of the current Ye Yuan, this was a skeleton.

A pink skeleton!

She was heartless, she was cold, and she looked down on all living things.

In her eyes, she was heaven, not allowing the slightest bit of defiance.

“Your Excellency, hurry and go! It will be too late if you still don’t leave!”

“Your Excellency, I’m called Jiang Ming!”

...

Jiang Ming only spoke a few sentences to Ye Yuan in total, the words still ringing in his ears.

It was also Ye Yuan’s first time seeing this young Divine Lord Realm martial artist. He could see Jiang Ming’s feelings of idolization toward him from the other party’s eyes.

He was innocent.

But this woman killed him in front of him just like that!

Unforgivable!

An icy-cold killing intent instantly swept throughout the entire street.

On the streets, it was as if the temperature suddenly fell several degrees.

Lu Ziyi looked at Ye Yuan expressionlessly and said while having a pitying look, “Are you angry for a lowly commoner? Truly pitiful! It likewise also shows your incompetence! You couldn’t save him and similarly can’t save yourself too.”

Not that Ye Yuan did not want to save, but that that sword move earlier grasped the situation too well.

His heart was full of worry over White Light and the rest. The moment he moved, he called forth all of his energy, and then the sword came from another direction. He had no time to turn around and save Jiang Ming at all.

Even if he knew spatial law, it also could not make it in time!

Ye Yuan’s two eyes were icy-cold as he questioned, “In your eyes, is human life akin to grass? You are targeting me, so why make a move against an irrelevant person!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lu Ziyi had a calm look as she said, “A mere lowly commoner. If he’s killed, then he’s killed, what can you do to me? Moreover, he isn’t an unrelated person. He tipped you off. Rebelling against us by giving information is the same crime as revolting!”

By the side, Deng Wei could not help laughing as he said, “Really a foolish guy! He’s clearly so weak, yet he still wants to share his sympathy with such a lowly commoner. I really don’t know how he cultivated reaching his realm.”

Dai Yang also laughed in spite of himself and said, “This kid’s cultivation speed is pretty fast. The intel that we received was that he might have broken through to the True God Realm already. I didn’t think that he’s already Third Firmament True God. However ... it’s still too weak!”

Lu Ziyi said coolly, “Rootless wood, waterless duckweed; no matter how high the realm, it’s also futile.”

These three people chimed in one after another. Heavenly Eagle’s martial artists were uncomfortable all over when they listened.

In the eyes of these proud chosen of heaven, they all, these people, were simply insignificant existences.

One more, one less, it completely did not matter to these proud chosen of heaven.

Of course, it was like this in the entire Heavenspan World.

It was just that after experiencing Ye Yuan’s rule, they felt that this was a heavenly paradise.

Ye Yuan was different from these high and mighty proud chosen of heaven!

He would fly into a great rage for an insignificant civilian.

This kind of warm feeling was what they had never experienced before.

Ye Yuan looked at Lu Ziyi, his face frosty as he said, “The three of you keep harping about him being a lowly commoner. Do you really think that you’re dragons or phoenixes among men? In my eyes, you guys are the out-and-out lowly plebeians!”

His words were full of ridicule.

Lu Ziyi’s expression was calm and did not get angry. She just said coolly, “Indulging in contention of mouth and tongue? That laughable dignity of yours is actually utterly worthless. Okay, I’ll give you a chance, if you can win any one out of the three of us, I can bring my men and leave.”

Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s understanding of Ye Yuan was actually not much.

They received a tip-off, saying that Ye Yuan was acting autonomously. It was only then they started paying attention to such a remote Southridge Ten Cities.

Looking into it slightly, they discovered that Southridge Ten Cities’ situation was indeed somewhat abnormal.

Hence, that was why there was this operation.

The reason why they sent out such a powerful line-up was that they knew that a Fourth Firmament True God powerhouse had once appeared here before.

As for Ye Yuan, they did not place him in their eyes at all.

But Ye Yuan’s appearance indeed made these three people somewhat surprised.

Logically speaking, Ye Yuan at most just broke through to the True God Realm currently. Who knew that he already reached the Third Firmament True God Realm so quickly.

But, even if it was Third Firmament True God, Lu Ziyi still did not take him seriously.

Initial-stage True God Realm and middle-stage True God Realm were on completely different levels.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was frosty as he said, “No need! Today, none of you can leave! In your eyes, Jiang Ming is a lowly commoner. But in my eyes, he’s ten thousand times nobler than you all. Hence, I’ll use your blood to hold a memorial ceremony for Jiang Ming!”

Deng Wei laughed loudly when he heard it and said, “Ignorant thing, to actually place that lowly commoner in the same category as us. Are you trying to infuriate us? Well, you’ve succeeded. You’ll regret it.”

Finished talking, he slowly walked out, aura becoming stronger and stronger, climbing to the peak very quickly.

A Fifth Firmament True God!

When the martial artists in the city saw this commotion, each and every one of their expression changed abruptly. They could not help worrying for Ye Yuan.

They knew that every minor realm of True God Realm had a tremendous disparity; let alone that there was a small stage between Ye Yuan and Deng Wei!

He looked at Ye Yuan and said with a pitying look, “Originally planned on detaining and bringing all of you to the great imperial capital. Looking at it now, there’s no need anymore.”

It was only to see two kinds of power of law fuse together in perfect harmony, his aura rising a level once more.

Horrifying heaven and earth spiritual energy gathered over crazily.

“So strong! This is wind and lightning, two powers of law fusing. Furthermore, these two kinds of laws are already cultivated to middle-stage rank six.”

“Truly well-deserving of being a genius that came from a great imperial capital. He’s actually this strong!”

“Lord Ye Yuan isn’t looking too good. Although he also has law fusion, the realm disparity is too great!”

...

The martial artists in the city could not refrain from worrying about Ye Yuan.

Reaching True God Realm, jumping realms and battling became increasingly difficult.

Moreover, Deng Wei, this kind of genius was an existence invincible in the same rank to begin with.

“A bumpkin like you will never understand the difference between you and a true genius. If you can receive this Wind Lightning True Grand Palm and not die, this genius can consider sparing your life!”

Deng Wei’s gaze turned cold and suddenly threw a palm out, aiming straight for Ye Yuan.

But, amidst everyone’s shocked gazes, Ye Yuan did not move a muscle.

Yes, there wasn’t the slightest bit of law undulation on Ye Yuan’s body. He also did not condense any heaven and earth spiritual energy.

He ... actually stood there and let the other party hit!

Everyone was stunned!

Facing a powerhouse who was two minor realms higher than him, he actually stood there and did not move?

Everyone’s hearts leaped to their throats, looking at Ye Yuan with worried faces.

Lu Ziyi just smiled coldly and said, “Stupid!”

This palm arrived in an instant and bombarded Ye Yuan’s body solidly, erupting with an intense speed.

Everyone looked at this scene in complete bewilderment, not knowing why Ye Yuan would do this.

Deng Wei looked at that ball of light with a contemptuous look and said disdainfully, “Foolish thing, think that he’s an unkillable cockroach?”

But very soon, the light dissipated. A figure stood there proudly, standing stone still.
