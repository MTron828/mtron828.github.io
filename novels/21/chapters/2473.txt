Chapter 2479: Three Progenitors Battling Saint Azure!

Boom!

Originsmile’s speed was inconceivably swift. In a blink, it was another punch!

The confrontation this time was evenly matched again.

On humanity’s side, the group of Dao Ancestors was puzzled.

What kind of Heavenly Dao True Martial was this? It was totally useless!

Continue fighting at this rate, even if they punched a hole in the sky, it could not determine the victor too, no?

“Heh, this Profound Lineage’s progenitor is a fake! His Heavenly Dao True Martial is actually completely useless!”

“Since Saint Azure reached the realm of a Grand Ancestor. So how can this bit of attack power do anything to him?”

“This guy is here to play a fool, right?”

… …

On humanity’s side, everyone revealed contemptuous looks.

Of course, Originsmile was very powerful.

But they were no longer worried about Ye Yuan. Because he already reached the realm of Grand Ancestor. Furthermore, he was even the strongest primeval dragon.

This degree of attack could no longer hurt him.

It was just that a hint of an imperceptible slight smile flashed across the corners of Tian Qing’s mouth.

Boom!

Originsmile did not stop, throwing another heavy punch.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed greatly. His figure retreated immediately.

This punch just now actually gave him an overwhelming pressure!

Originsmile’s movements were unbelievably swift. He threw a punch again, not giving Ye Yuan a chance to catch his breath at all.

One punch after another!

The expression on everyone’s faces finally changed.

They discovered that something was amiss very quickly. Ye Yuan could not hold out more and more in front of Originsmile.

Bang!

Finally, Ye Yuan could not bear it, spurting a mouthful of fresh blood wildly. He flew away.

Tian Qing smiled and said, “Among the divine race’s progenitors, which one isn’t a veteran of a hundred battles? Heavenly Dao True Martial, Thousand Martial Myriad Catties! With each punch thrown, the power is five times the previous punch! Stacking it up, the power will be extremely terrifying! Having Originsmile unleash more than a dozen punches in a row, even this progenitor will get seriously injured too! This bunch of fools actually ridiculed Originsmile for being a fake? Who gave them the courage?”

Over on humanity’s side, the expressions of the group of Dao Ancestors changed abruptly.

This Heavenly Dao True Martial sounded average and looked even more ordinary.

But it was actually unbelievably terrifying!

One had to know, Originsmile’s one punch already possessed incredibly terrifying power in itself.

Wanting to withstand this punch was extremely difficult to begin with.

That kind of fist clashing, only Ye Yuan this strongest primeval dragon dared to do it.

How could the other Dao Ancestors dare to clash like that?

Wanting to deal with this move, unless it was winning with one move, or you could avoid all of his attacks.

Except, against a powerhouse standing at the summit of the Heavenspan World, how difficult was it to achieve this?

Therefore, this move had virtually no flaws!

To continue fighting with Originsmile, the more the other party fought, the stronger he got. There was no solution at all!

Originsmile stood in the air and said smilingly, “This trick can’t do anything to you. But it’s still not your turn to come and be arrogant in front of this progenitor yet! Your threat is no threat! This Heavenspan World is our divine race’s!”

He said could not do anything was because he knew Ye Yuan’s strange movement technique.

But, if Ye Yuan really wanted to threaten them, he needed to bring out sufficient strength, and defeat them head-on!

Without sufficient strength, his threat appeared laughable.

Ye Yuan stabilized his figure, wiped away the bloodstains at the corners of his mouth, and said with a grin, “Is that so? You’ve already used your Heavenly Dao True Martial, but I haven’t made a move yet!”

The current Ye Yuan still had extremely exuberant blood vitality, like he had not gotten injured at all.

Originsmile could not help criticizing in his heart, secretly scolding freak.

Grand completion Nine Transformations Golden Body was too terrifying!

Even if a Dao Ancestor took this punch of his, it was also impossible to be like Ye Yuan; completely fine.

However, his face was still very calm and he said, “It’s no use. This move of mine, Thousand Martial Myriad Catties, unless you have absolute strength, otherwise, it has no counter! Back then, your human race had three Grand Ancestors who died under this move!”

Ye Yuan’s smile reined in, a cold light flashing in his eyes.

The 18 grand ancestors were like his disciples, but they all died at the hands of the disciples.

Now, Originsmile actually had a smug appearance. How could Ye Yuan not be angry?

It was only to hear a cold laugh. He said, “Is that so? Then take a look at whether you can block it or not!”

Ye Yuan pressed his palms together, causing an astonishing dragon might to rise up to the sky.

Rumble?…

The astounding dragon might desired to compete with heaven’s might! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Originsmile’s expression instantly changed wildly.

This pressure gave him an extremely dangerous feeling.

At the same time, there was also Tian Qing as well as the divine race’s various lineages’ progenitors whose expressions changed.

“This move, could it be … Nine Dragons Descending Upon the World?” Beside Tian Qing, a progenitor said in surprise.

Tian Qing nodded slightly, his expression solemn as he said, “Won’t be wrong! It’s that move! The previous generation primeval dragon’s strength was lacking and could only summon three true dragon spirits. But it already caused considerable problems for us. Looking at Ye Yuan’s power … there’s likely no less than six!”

His voice had yet to fade when three golden true dragon spirits flew out from the horizon, traversing indeterminately amidst the strong wind and rain.

“Roar!”

The three true dragon spirits rushed toward Originsmile frenziedly under Ye Yuan’s guidance.

Bang, bang, bang?…

The three true dragon spirits bared their fangs and brandished their claws, clashing together with Originsmile.

These three true dragon spirits, each one had Grand Ancestor level strength!

Three dragons teaming up actually directly suppressed Originsmile.

Originsmile’s Thousand Martial Myriad Catties was unable to link up at all.

For a time, the battle fell into a stalemate.

But at this time, Ye Yuan’s hand movements changed irregularly, and palms faced the sky.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

Another three true dragon spirits flew out, heading straight for Originsmile.

Tian Qing’s expression changed wildly and he said in a solemn voice, “Yi Feng, you go and help him!”

Yi Feng was the Yellow Lineage’s progenitor!

Yi Feng did not say a word, directly joining the battle.

However, the six true dragon spirits overlaying together was not as simple as one plus one equals two.

These six true dragon spirits, each one had a different attribute.

Attacking together, the power multiplied!

When Tian Qing saw this scene, the corners of his mouth twitched slightly and he said, “This guy is really unreasonable monstrous! If we wait for him to step into the realm of rule, this progenitor won’t be able to do anything to him either!”

Suddenly, his expression changed again, and he cried out in surprise, “A se-seventh one!?Hiss?… This guy!”

It was only to see Ye Yuan’s seals change again. The seventh true dragon spirit stepped out of the sky.

With seven true dragon spirits joining forces, they forced the two great progenitors into a fluster, practically without the strength to fight back!

Over on humanity’s side, everyone was stunned!

Suddenly, a group of powerhouses arrived with a howl. Seeing this scene, one could not help laughing excitedly as he said,?“Hahaha?… it’s the primeval dragon’s supreme innate divine ability, Nine Dragons Descending Upon the World! His Excellency is actually able to summon seven true dragon spirits! He’s really my Dragon Clan’s strongest through the ages!”

The arrival was precisely Long Yi. With him, there were Bai Chen and the rest.

When Long Yi saw the scene of seven dragons battling two progenitors, he yelled excitedly.

Nine Dragons Descending Upon the World!

However, when casting this move, what each generation of primeval dragon could achieve was different.

But in the records of the Dragon Clan, the most was also just five true dragon spirits.

Ye Yuan actually summoned seven at once!

Suddenly, his expression changed and he cried out in surprise, “T-The eighth!”

It was only to see another true dragon spirit tunnel out of the void, heading straight for the battlefield.

Tian Qing’s entire body trembled, and he gritted his teeth and said, “Damn it! This progenitor doesn’t believe that you can still summon nine true dragon spirits! Bo Yi, you go too!”
