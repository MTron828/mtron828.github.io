Chapter 2902 Creating Another Shocking Victory!

“Li Clearcloud? You actually haven’t died under the Dao tribulations! Huhu, just the likes of you also want to kill me?” You Jin looked at the arrival, full of disdain.

He naturally knew Li Clearcloud. In reality, the two had fought many times.

But in the end, You Jin was still one step ahead, stepping into Hegemon Realm.

Li Clearcloud was still blocked outside the door of Hegemon Realm until now.

With regards to Li Clearcloud, You Jin was naturally disdainful.

Li Clearcloud said coolly, “If you were at your prime, I’m naturally not your match. But ... since you’re seriously wounded by the Absolute Heaven Barrier’s power, this is a god-sent opportunity to kill you!”

You Jin said disdainfully, “No matter how seriously injured, this seat is a Hegemon too! You, a trash who can’t even reach Hegemon, want to kill me too?”

Li Clearcloud said coolly, “Wouldn’t you know after trying!”

Finished saying, Li Clearcloud pointed a finger, the power of origin came rolling in!

The terrifying pressure made everyone’s expression change drastically.

Among them, it naturally included You Jin!

He had a look of horror as he said, “Nine origins! You ... You actually comprehended nine origins!’

Li Clearcloud ignored You Jin’s horror and pointed a tyrannical finger at You Jin.

Divine ability, Nine Absolutes Life-Seizing Finger!

You Jin was horrified, blood energy in his body surging to the sky, desperately wanting to stop this finger.

The composure just now had disappeared without a trace.

What replaced it was a look of alarm and fear.

Boom!

The bloody light on You Jin’s body directly had a large hole punched through by Li Clearcloud, his entire person being pierced through

This finger was fearsome to the extreme.

It was also Ye Yuan’s first time seeing Li Clearcloud attack. It was truly breathtaking to the extreme.

This was probably the number one person under Hegemon, right?

“Is this a divine ability? Indeed amazing! Presently, I have the power of origin in my body too. I wonder if I can comprehend a divine ability or not!”

Ye Yuan looked at Li Clearcloud, who was practically poking a hole in the sky. His thoughts could not refrain from flying elsewhere.

Divine abilities were the martial techniques used by Hegemon Realm powerhouses, the power formidable to the extreme.

Although Li Clearcloud was not Hegemon Realm yet, he comprehended nine origins. His strength could virtually rival some of the weaker Hegemon Realms already.

For Ye Yuan to dare come and kill a Hegemon, his greatest reliance was naturally Li Clearcloud.

However, not all Hegemon Realms could comprehend a divine ability.

Divine abilities were somewhat similar to the true spirit race’s innate divine abilities.

It was just that origin powerhouses needed a lucky chance to comprehend divine ability. Hegemon Realms with divine abilities, their strength was naturally a great deal stronger than Hegemon Realms without divine abilities.

Li Clearcloud already grasped a divine ability in the origin realm. It truly took everyone’s breath away.

When Feng Xiaotian saw this scene, he also muttered, “That’s a true divine ability technique! Once Brother Clearcloud enters Hegemon Realm, he’d likely be able to instantly kill same rank Hegemons! Impressive! Impressive!”

“That’s a divine ability? How strong!”

“Shattered a Hegemon Realm with one finger, really too impressive!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Heh heh, today’s battle, we’re destined to shock the world!”

......

Swoosh!

A surge of blood light rose to the sky. You Jin was going to escape!

Li Clearcloud laughed heartily and chased after with a lunge.

It was only to hear extremely terrifying fighting sounds coming over from the horizon, making people quake in their boots.

And over here, it was virtually a one-sided massacre!

Blood light shone brightly on Ye Yuan’s body, charging into the army all by himself, akin to a no man’s land.

His thick accumulations erupted. After breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven, he charged to peak lower True Sovereign Heaven in one stroke.

Under grand completion True Sovereign Heaven, few were his match.

When Ye Yuan was still only upper Saint Sovereign Heaven back then, he was already invincible in Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Now, he was naturally even more powerful.

And he drained two blood pools in succession. His bloodline power was already strong until it was incapable of further increase too.

Under a punch, even if it was a True Sovereign Heaven, they would be directly one-shotted too.

With him around, the fights below Emperor Realm seemed to go much more smoothly, especially since this 100 thousand strong army was Heaven One Alliance’s elite martial artists to begin with!

As soon as the army arrived, they swept away all obstacles in the way.

It was the Emperor Realm fights that appeared a little worrisome.

But at this time, Feng Xiaotian similarly had an unparalleled divine might, fighting until Bloodpromise vomited blood repeatedly.

Just as Ye Yuan expected, after consecutive battles, the blood race’s Emperor Realms had similarly suffered heavy losses.

But on Heaven One’s side, many new fresh blood were injected.

On the Emperor Realms’ side, it was still Heaven One who occupied an absolute advantage.

The conclusion seemed to already have been destined!

While at this time, in the Absolute Heaven Barrier, the Hegemons had lost composure!

Receiving the news that came over from South Qi Giant City, Hegemon Cloudmount was virtually going nuts.

“This little scoundrel, is he mad? The power of the Light of Blood Eye, even Emperor Realm powerhouses can’t withstand it too! He led this 100 thousand strong army. Isn’t it going to court death? Moreover, no matter how injured a Hegemon Realm is, that’s also a Hegemon Realm! Li Clearcloud, that bastard, actually accompanied Ye Yuan to go crazy together! I-It’s angering this seat to death!” Hegemon Realm Cloudmount let loose a torrent of abuse.

This bunch of guys actually directly went out of the Absolute Heaven Barrier without even giving any heads-up! The previous victory was by relying on the power of the city protecting grand array.

Did these damn things really think that they were invincible under the heavens?

“Humph! Old Man Cloudmount, fine disciples that you’ve taught! It’s fine if they die, but if this army of 100 thousand is lost, your Extreme Medicine Sect will become a sinner!” Hegemon Blacksun’s voice came over.

Hegemon Cloudmount’s face turned black, but this time, he surprisingly did not rebut.

Divine Lord was full of anxiety as he said, “This battle, even if we win, it will be a pyrrhic victory too! Many people have never experienced the prowess of the Light of Blood Eye. With the enhancement of the Light of Blood Eye, Giant Net City’s 200 thousand strong army will become ferocious savages! This time, Feng Xiaotian and Ye Yuan are really messing around too much!”

Hesitating for a moment, Hegemon Pinespring said, “Master, Little Junior Brother was once the blood race’s Blood Divine Son. He should understand the blood race’s tricks a little. Perhaps he has a way to deal with the Light of Blood Eye?”.

“Huhu, Light of Blood Eye, even if it’s us Hegemons, we can only forcefully destroy it too. It can’t be suppressed at all! Can he, a measly little True Sovereign Heaven, really overturn the heavens?” Hegemon Blacksun said with a cold smile.

“What Brother Blacksun said is right! Ye Yuan has indeed created many miracles, but this time, it’s too reckless! I heard that going out of Absolute Heaven this time was him strongly pushing for it. How preposterous!” another Hegemon said.

“In my view, Ye Yuan has probably let the consecutive victories get to his head! Right now, he probably already doesn’t even know what he’s surnamed, right? Blood Divine Son, huhu, what a great title!”

......

The group of Hegemons was extremely furious at this time.

South Qi Giant City actually went to attack arbitrarily without even giving any notification.

It was simply not showing them, these Hegemons, any respect!

Over 100 thousand elites!

Once they died at Giant Net City, the consequences were simply unimaginable!

Facing such a circumstance, Hegemon Cloudmount felt tremendous pressure too.

These few days, he really showed off to the extreme.

Who knew that in a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan sold him out!

Furthermore, Li Clearcloud, this scoundrel, actually accompanied Ye Yuan, a little fellow, to mess around!

Right at this time, a figure sped over from the horizon.

“Giant Net City great victory! Giant Net City great victory! Hegemon You Jin was killed! An astonishing great victory!”
