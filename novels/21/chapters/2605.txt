Chapter 2611: Perfection

From this day on, the two people would undergo a great battle on Xianyun Mountain every ten days to half a month.

After a fight, the two people would each go into a retreat to comprehend what they learned in this battle.

Ye Yuan’s strength and Han Yi’s strength were not that much different. One could not do anything to the other.

In each battle, the two people practically fought until they were close to collapsing.

Both parties’ battles also had mutual wins and losses.

In the beginning, Han Yi’s odds of winning were still a little higher.

After all, his five laws transformation had been comprehended for a long time. His first form was also a little more mature.

But along with the passage of time, Han Yi’s advantage was continuously being eroded by Ye Yuan.

The two were both peerless geniuses. Under such battles where they both met their match, they made rapid progress.

However, Ye Yuan was a notch better in the end.

Although the two people were both improving rapidly, Ye Yuan’s improvement was clearly faster.

Three years later, Ye Yuan and Han Yi’s victories were basically equilibrium already.

Another three years later, Han Yi could rarely beat Ye Yuan anymore.

Another two years passed, Han Yi could basically just take a beating.

Nine years later, Han Yi’s first form Five-star Lotus, finally reached the realm of perfection!

Because of this too, his strength improved greatly, suppressing Ye Yuan once again.

Five elements not perfected and five elements perfected, was two entirely different concepts.

Five elements circulating, reproducing in endless succession, it was absolutely one of the most powerful rules closed loops!

But the Dao of Universe that fused sword, space, and formation, these three rules, was no less inferior in comparison.

What Han Yi was strong in was his rule realm.

However, Han Yi was not smug for too long.

Five years later, Ye Yuan caught up again.

The two people’s combat power was once again equal.

Later, Han Yi was completely suppressed by Ye Yuan again.

This time, he was utterly convinced.

On Xianyun Mountain, rumbling sounds came from time to time.

Two figures crisscrossed, making the group of transformation powerhouses incredibly shocked.

Similarly transformation powerhouses, the disparity was too great!

“Lord Ye Yuan is really a monster! In just a short 14 years, his first form is almost reaching grand completion!”

“What’s scary is that his fighting talent is too strong! These recent few matches, he suppressed Chief Holy Lord until Chief Holy Lord can’t lift his head at all!”

“Isn’t that so? I originally thought that Chief Holy Lord was incredibly talented. But only after seeing Lord Ye Yuan did I know what’s called there’s always someone better, and heaven beyond heaven!”

… …

During these 14 years of fighting, these people had witnessed Ye Yuan’s growth with their own eyes.

Those able to comprehend Great Dao Transformation, their talents were all one-in-a-million.

But Han Yi’s talent absolutely left people far behind in the dust among this group of people!

However, Han Yi was far worse when compared to Ye Yuan.

Hence, that was why they would feel vicissitudes of emotion.

Boom!

Ye Yuan caught Han Yi’s slip-up and was unforgiving after gaining the momentum, the Universe Dual Swords aiming for the vitals with each move, and finally completely defeated Han Yi.

“I concede!”

Han Yi was helpless and could only admit defeat.

Universe Dual Swords returned to their places. Presently, the young sprout had already grown a lot. It would be a seedling if it continued developing.

This also indicated that Ye Yuan’s first form already reached the realm of grand completion.

Han Yi rolled his eyes and said unhappily, “You this fellow, can’t you save me some face?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Face is earned by yourself, not given by others. If I gave way to you, what’s the point of this spar?”

Han Yi’s mouth curled and he said unhappily, “You’re really boring! Not fighting anymore, not fighting anymore! There’s also no point in continuing to fight anymore. Your Father is going to ascend!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said in agreement, “Indeed, there’s no point in continuing to fight anymore. You and I have both reached our bottlenecks, we can’t improve even if we carry on fighting like this. It’s time to break through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.”

Ye Yuan’s All-Encompassing Sacred Tree and Han Yi’s Five-star Lotus had both already reached the limit of Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, it was very hard to make any more breakthroughs.

Wanting to improve further, they had to break through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Breaking through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum was just water that flowed naturally when the channel formed to these two people.

If they were willing, they could have long broken through.

But a hint of reluctance flashed across Han Yi’s face, and he said disappointedly, “With this farewell, I also don’t know when we can see each other again.”

He was different from Ye Yuan. After he ascended, he would go to the Land of Exile’s second level.

But Ye Yuan would be directly teleported out.

These two people fought for 14 years and also improved together for 14 years, it was naturally inevitable that some feelings of appreciation of each other would be born.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’ll be waiting for you outside!”

Han Yi’s entire body trembled, his gaze suddenly turning to Ye Yuan.

But very soon, it dimmed again and he said with a bitter smile, “It’s useless. This Land of Exile was personally created by Zhuo Bufan. Forget that I’m just Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum; even if I reach grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven, it’s also impossible to go out.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So what? Only with an unyielding heart, can one reverse the firmament. Could it be that you accept your fate?”

The martial artists in the land of exile all had ways of seeking death.

But each person’s circumstances were different.

Han Yi ascended from a great trichiliocosm together with his wife.

They were originally a pair of immortal lovers. Han Yi’s wife was also very beautiful.

Who would have expected that his wife was actually fancied by a small country’s prince and actually forcibly defiled?

His wife was ready to die to preserve her chastity and felt ashamed to face Han Yi. So she committed suicide.

Han Yi at that time had just ascended not long ago. His strength was not strong. So how could he resist a country’s power?

In his rage, Han Yi cultivated frenziedly. Not only did he cultivate to grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum very quickly, he even comprehended Great Dao Transformation.

Who knew that under his fury, he actually massacred a country with his power alone!

This matter caused a great sensation.

Later, he was captured and thrown into the Land of Exile.

After Ye Yuan learned about this matter, he also sighed endlessly.

Han Yi’s methods were too fierce. Being captured and put inside, he only had himself to blame as well.

However, his nature was not like this.

His beloved wife suffering this kind of humiliation. Anyone would probably go crazy too.

Han Yi’s gaze turned intent, and he immediately revealed a hint of a smile and said, “Fine lad, I, Han Yi, never accept fate! After going out, I have to cultivate well. Don’t get surpassed by me instead after I go out!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Just the likes of you, you aren’t qualified enough yet!”

Han Yi’s face turned black, but he also felt that it was not too likely.

This boy was simply a freak.

Han Yi felt that he was already monstrous enough, but this boy was even more monstrous than him!

In future cultivation, if there were no accidents, Ye Yuan would only shake him off further and further behind.

However, Ye Yuan’s monstrousness also deeply stimulated him.

Han Yi also secretly resolved himself to definitely work hard and not lag behind Ye Yuan.

“You this fellow, really not cute at all! However, you’ll be dragged down by the secular world after going out. But I can only advance in the midst of slaughter. So I might not be worse than you!” Han Yi’s gaze was piercing. He was not someone who easily admitted defeat.

On this day, two array formation lights descended on top of Xianyun Mountain.

Watching the two people disappear, everyone’s faces revealed a trace of relief. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Finally gone! With these two around, I was even doubting life.”

“These two people’s talents are too terrifying. Staying together with them can cause us to lose motivation!”

“I have to cultivate hard! I have to regain confidence!”
