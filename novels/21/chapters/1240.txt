Mother and Son Linking Hearts

“Ancestor, the matter that happened in the day, you’re already aware, right?”

Ao Li stood outside a cave, hands by the side.

Clearly, he was very respectful toward the old ancestor inside the cave.

Only after a long time did a voice that sounded like having had experienced the many vicissitudes of life come out from inside the cave.

“Are you blaming me for not taking action?”

Ao Li’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “Ao Li dare not!”

“Huhu, even if I make a move, I might not be able to do anything to him either,” that aged voice said.

Ao Li’s trembled all over, his gaze revealing a look of shock as he said, “This ... How is this possible!”

“If Heavenly Dao was intact, it’s naturally as easy as turning my hand to eradicate him! But right now, this deity is also merely just a slightly stronger divine king powerhouse, that’s all. In this world, there might be no one capable of winning me.”

That aged voice called himself this deity. This Divine Beast Realm’s old ancestor was actually a genuine Deity Realm powerhouse!

Probably, the entire Divine Realm’s powerhouses could not imagine that inside this Godsfall Mountain Range, there actually hid a Deity Realm powerhouse.

But Heavenly Dao was missing. Even a deity realm powerhouse did not have the glory back then as well.

Hence, when Ao Li heard the ancestor’s words, he was deeply shocked.

The reason why he was able to comprehend Divine Dao laws, comprehend divine rank dragon wave, was entirely because there was the ancestor’s guidance.

In Ao Li’s eyes, even if Heavenly Dao was missing presently, he was also the most powerful being.

But these words today made Ao Li have a feeling of a hero past his prime.

“He ... On what basis?” Ao Li said in disbelief. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“In this world, there’s a type of person called a true genius! No matter how hard you try, you’re unable to surpass too! Right now, his essence, energy, and spirit haven’t reached grand completion yet. When he truly reaches grand completion and attains Half-Deity Realm, he’ll probably have no opponent in this world anymore!” The ancestor said rather despondently.

In his words, they carried ineffable emotions.

Ao Li was deeply shocked by the ancestor’s appraisal!

What was called no matter how hard you try, you’re also unable to surpass?

“Sigh ... go back! You tell him, this deity will send him off.” The ancestor said with a long sigh.

Ao Li left in a despondent mood. He did not even know how he left.

Someone as talented as him actually heard such an evaluation. This made him totally unable to accept it.

But he was actually unable to refute.

Ye Yuan’s age was much younger than his, but his strength already steadily surpassed him!

Could it be that there was still anything more persuasive than this?

After Ao Li left, a female voice sounded out inside the cave.

“Right now, do you regret your actions back then?”

“Yes! I didn’t expect that ... this old man also have times where I make an error of judgment!”

The woman clearly did not expect that the old ancestor actually acknowledged it so shamelessly and could not help falling silent.

After a moment, the old ancestor continued, “He seized possession and reincarnated and most likely suffered a huge accident in the outside world. Could it be that ... you’re not going out to take a look?”

“No matter what unforeseen event, he already grew up now. Given time, even you might not be his match either, what can I still not let go of?” The woman said.

The ancestor heaved a sigh again and said, “Sigh, an ill-fated destiny!”

...

An entire night’s time, Ye Yuan’s heart was in turmoil.

If it were normally, he did not need to do anything at all and would be able to enter meditation.

But today, he could not do it no matter what.

Only all the way until past midnight, did Ye Yuan fall asleep.

At this time, his divine soul actually turned into an azure dragon and emerged from his body.

After the dragon soul left the body, meandering out, it actually flew over towards that cave.

But arriving outside the cave, Ye Yuan discovered that inside the cave faintly exuded a powerful undulation.

He circled at the entrance of the cave for a long time before finally returning to his body before dawn.

“Big Brother Yuan! Big Brother Yuan! Are you alright?”

By his ear, came Li-er’s shouting. Ye Yuan abruptly startled awake.

He was covered his sweat, his entire person seemingly hauled out of the water.

“I ... I was dreaming? No, wait, this wasn’t a dream! That cave is definitely peculiar!” Ye Yuan muttered to himself.

Li-er had a baffled look and said curiously, “What cave? Big Brother Yuan, what are you talking about?”

Ye Yuan pulled Li-er and went outside. As they walked, he said, “Come, go with me to find a cave!”

The two people called White Light and were about to leave the clan, but was stopped by Ao Li.

“Where are you guys going?” Ao Li asked with a serious expression.

Ye Yuan was not polite and said, “None of your business, move aside!”

Ao Li knew that Ye Yuan was not to be trifled with and controlled his temper and said, “Old ancestor already agreed to send you away. It doesn’t seem very nice for you to be like this, right?”

“This Divine Beast Realm seems to have some connections with me. You move aside, I’m just going to find a cave and not harm you all!” Ye Yuan forcefully pressed down the anxiety in his heart and said.

The moment Ao Li heard Ye Yuan say cave, he knew that he seemed to have known something.

A cave that was able to make Ye Yuan feel out of the ordinary, there was only the place where Ancestor was in closed-seclusion.

“What a joke! What connections do my Divine Beast Realm’s matters have to do with you?” Isn’t your esteemed self’s worry a little too much?” Ao Li said with a cold smile.

What a joke, how could he possibly let Ye Yuan go and disturb the old ancestor’s quiet cultivation?

Ye Yuan felt irritation in his heart and said in a deep voice, “If you still don’t move aside, don’t blame this young master for not being courteous!”

Ao Li also lost his temper and said in a cold voice, “If you want to go over, not unless you step over my dead body!”

“Humph! Then I’ll have to offend!”

Ye Yuan did not say another word. Lifting his hand, it was a Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!

This palm, Ye Yuan did not hold back in the slightest. The moment he attacked, it startled the heavens and shook the earth!

Ao Li’s expression changed and could only respond with the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm.

The result had not the least bit of surprise.

Ye Yuan’s one palm succeeding, he did not have the intention of staying, bringing Li-er and White Light and rushing over.

This palm alarmed the clan members. People rushed out one after another but discovered that Ye Yuan was long gone already.

Even Patriarch Ao Li could not stop Ye Yuan, who else could stop him?

Ye Yuan followed the sensation of his divine soul leaving the body last night and found that cave before long.

Seeing this cave, Ye Yuan’s feelings were actually somewhat agitated, somewhat flustered.

“It’s this cave, exactly the same as my dream!” Ye Yuan said.

“Big Brother Yuan, just what secret is inside this cave?” Li-er said curiously.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know either, but we should be able to know when we go in!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought the two people and was able to enter inside, but his expression suddenly changed.

A figure slowly walked out from inside the darkness, gradually becoming distinct.

This was an old man whose hair and beard had turned all white, looking advanced in age.

But, the undulations faintly emitting from his body made Ye Yuan’s heart palpitate endlessly too.

This old man was not simple!

“Didn’t this deity agree to send you away? What are you so impatient for?” The old man said with slight displeasure.

The old man’s words filled Ye Yuan trio with shock!

“This deity! You ... You’re a Deity Realm powerhouse!” White Light cried out in shock.

The old man gave a self-mocking laugh and said, “Huhu, Deity Realm powerhouse? That’s something a very long time ago already. Right now ... at most considered a half-deity!”
