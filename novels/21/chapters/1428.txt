Chapter 1432 Addressing as Brothers

Swish!

All of a sudden, the Tianlu Shrine burst forth with a dazzling golden light, shining until everyone could not open their eyes.

Azurepeak’s expression turned sharp, his deadpan face finally revealed a surprised expression.

“This ... This is ...”

It was also the group of White Night powerhouses’ first time seeing the Tianlu Shrine and they did not know what this golden light represented.

Bai Chen could not resist asking, “Lord Divine Envoy, what ... what does this golden light represent? Is Grand Elder ... an intruder or not?”

Azurepeak’s expression turned cold and he said solemnly, “Intruder my ass! The guy who spread this rumor will die a horrible death! Elder Ye is pure until he cannot be purer Sky Foothill martial artist!”

Everyone was first stunned, and immediately revealed a look of great joy.

Since Azurepeak said so, then it was impossible for Ye Yuan to be some intruder anymore!

The shock in Bai Chen’s heart could not be any greater. He looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

Ye Yuan just smiled slightly, giving him a calm look.

Except, the elation on Bai Chen’s face, at this time he did not need to act at all.

This result, he was really too surprised!

Only he and Mo Yun two people knew best. Master Ye Yuan was absolutely an outside trial-taker.

But just what method he used, to actually even outsmart the Tianlu Shrine?

One had to know that all of the outside world’s trial-takers, even grand completion Heaven Glimpse trial-takers, could not escape the Tianlu Shrine’s verification!

Yet, only Ye Yuan did it!

This kind of ability was simply inconceivable.

To be able to change the exterior aura and hide from the Tianlu Shrine’s investigation, this was not anything impressive.

But the blood in a martial artist’s body, how did one change the aura to hide from the Tianlu Shrine’s investigation?

He naturally did not know that Ye Yuan did not use some secret art to conceal the aura in his body, but simulated the Sky Foothill Heavenly Dao’s aura with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

This kind of imitation was not on the surface, but fused into every inch of the skin on his body, including the blood!

Forget about a measly little Tianlu Shrine, even the real Heavenly Dao could not distinguish it!

Bai Chen discovered that this master he acknowledged was simply an omnipotent god!

It seemed like there was nothing he could not do!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Seems like this Ye Yuan’s identity shouldn’t have anything worth suspecting, right?”

At this time, Azurepeak’s face actually squeezed out a hint of a smile and said to Ye Yuan with clasped hands, “Elder Ye, I’ve given offense previously! But Azurepeak is here under orders and didn’t have the intention of being hard on the White Night Sacred Palace. Please excuse me.”

The moment these words came out, White Night’s group virtually did not dare to believe their own ears.

Such a proud Divine Envoy Azurepeak was actually so courteous to Ye Yuan?

This ... This was not logical!

It seemed like the issue lay with that golden light.

It was just that, no idea what that golden light represented.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What’s Lord Divine Envoy saying here? You’re a divine envoy, representing the paramount Sky Foothill Divine Palace. To be able to welcome Lord Azurepeak is our White Night Sacred Palace’s honor!”

Azurepeak suddenly felt that this Ye Yuan looked so pleasing to the eye.

“Don’t keep calling Lord Divine Envoy, I’m a few years older than you, just call me Big Brother Azurepeak!” Azurepeak said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan did not stand on ceremony either and said with a smile, “Big Brother Azurepeak!”

The two people exchanged glances and smiles, writing off all enmity.

“Alright, this matter is settled, I’ll also have to go back to report on completion of the mission!” Azurepeak said with clasped hands.

“Since that’s the case, I won’t hold Big Brother Azurepeak back anymore. Take care!” Ye Yuan also clasped his hands and said.

Azurepeak bade farewell to everyone. When he turned around and left, he said with vicissitudes of emotion, “This child is actually able to trigger the Tianlu Shrine’s golden light, indicating that he has grasped the complete Sky Foothill laws. No wonder his strength is so powerful! This child’s future is limitless and is bound to enter the Sky Foothill Divine Palace in the future! Building good relations with him might be beneficial to me in the future.”

Finished talking, his figure flashed, disappearing from where he was.

In the White Night Sacred Palace, everyone finally truly relaxed.

“That golden light is definitely remarkable! You all didn’t see Lord Azurepeak’s expression It changed at that time!”

“Heh heh, Grand Elder actually addressed Lord Divine Envoy as his brother. Let me see if the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace, that bunch of trash, still dares to be arrogant!”

“The Autumn Rain Sacred Palace, that bunch of trash, used this kind of despicable method to disgust us when they can’t beat us. Truly too abominable!”

“One of these days, we’ll exterminate that bunch of grandsons!”

...

Everyone tried to get a word in, but Ye Yuan fell into contemplation.

Was it really a stumbling block done by the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace? Afraid not! Ye Yuan thought.

...

“What did you say? The divine palace’s divine envoy went to the White Night Sacred Palace and then left just like that?”

When Qin Tian heard this news, he nearly jumped up.

No, wait, should be almost spilled the beans.

“Yes, Palace Lord! Somebody saw that when Ye Yuan saw the divine envoy out, they addressed each other as brothers, their relationship appearing rather good,” that subordinate said.

A mouthful of coagulated blood in Qin Tian’s chest nearly spewed out.

He forcefully suppressed that mouthful of coagulated blood and said coldly, “Alright, it looks like it was this palace lord who made a mistake. Withdraw, continue keeping a close watch for me!”

“Yes, Palace Lord!”

After that subordinate withdrew, the coagulated blood that Qin Tian suppressed could not be endured anymore, spouting out. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“This is impossible! That Tianlu Shrine is so formidable. How in the world did Ye Yuan avoid it? Could it be that he came out of the Sky Foothill World to begin with? No way! This coordinate had restrictions placed by City Lord, His Excellency! It’s impossible for somebody to escape the Sky Foothill World! Just how many secrets are hidden on this damn fellow’s body?”

Qin Tian was depressed!

Failed to screw Ye Yuan over, his heart was struck with anger for a moment and his injuries actually worsened once again.

“Looks like there’s only making a move myself personally after healing my injuries!”

...

Inside the World Suppressing Stele, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes.

His aura was much stronger compared to before.

“I didn’t expect that after expending so many medicinal pills, I actually only cultivated to the half-step Heaven Glimpse Realm. This Chaos Heavenspan Canon is truly too resource-intensive,” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Without a doubt, the Chaos Heavenspan Canon was a top-tier powerful cultivation method in the world.

But the money-burning extent of this cultivation method, Ye Yuan felt greatly overwhelmed too.

Before he came, he used points and divine essence stones to exchange for a large batch of spirit medicines. It was actually only able to support him cultivating to the half-step Heaven Glimpse Realm.

If it were others, they would have long cultivated to initial-stage Heaven Glimpse.

“This cultivation method of yours is indeed unusual. The resources expended is a lot, but it can exchange for powerful strength. What’s there to be unsatisfied with? Fortunately, you entered the Selfless Realm last time and already created the second level cultivation method. You only need an opportunity now and you can break through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm!” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That death cultivation was really very scary. I almost died under my own sword at that time! Such a perverse cultivation method, I really don’t know how Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove thought of it! However, while this method is dangerous, it’s really very effective. For people, their greatest opponent is not the enemy, but themselves!”

Right at this time, a communication talisman broke into Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion area.

Ye Yuan checked it, the corners of his mouth revealing a hint of a smile.

The Divine Ruins was finally about to open up!
