Chapter 3101: Heaven Trampling Five Steps!

Countless God-Burying Flowers was like a rain of blades, dense until it was impermeable.

People could even see that inside that flower rain, space was being sliced into strips, being incomparably sharp.

Everyone could tell that Ye Yuan was likely fraught with grim possibilities!

“This … What to do about this?”

“Heavenly Saint Ye he actually died just like this?”

“Damn it! Kill Bloodpromise and avenge Heavenly Saint Ye!”

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses all went crazy.

First was Feng Xiaotian dying in battle, then it was Ye Yuan being killed. They were already beyond furious.

Countless powerhouses roared, charging over toward Bloodpromise.

Over elsewhere, Yi Xue also calculated everything and let out a loud laugh, “Mi Tian, you calculated everything and also didn’t calculate Bloodpromise’s strength, right? He repeatedly suffered defeat in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, but why was he still put in such an important position by us? However, this seat also didn’t expect that Ye Yuan actually took the road to ruin himself!”

Mi Tian’s face revealed a sorrowful expression.

He already completely could not feel Ye Yuan’s aura. Although he harbored a glimmer of hope in his heart, he knew that Ye Yuan was likely fraught with grim possibilities!

Indeed as Yi Xue said, he underestimated Bloodpromise too much!

“Zhao Yue, let us kill him!”

Mi Tian gave an angry roar, joining hands with Zhao Yue, rushing toward Yi Xue frenziedly.

“Hahaha …”

Looking at the wildly surging God-Burying Flowers, Bloodpromise let out a delighted laugh.

“A fool who overestimates his own ability! So what if he broke through to chaos grade bloodline? So what if he has saint force? So what if he can jump realms and battle? In the end, didn’t he still die under this seat’s Illusionary Flowers Burying Gods? Ye Yuan, this seat admits that you’re very monstrous! But using this seat’s life to exchange for your life is worth it!”

He knew that it would be impossible for him to escape his doom. But at this point, using his life to exchange for Ye Yuan’s life, it was really too worth it!

Ye Yuan’s monstrousness could no longer be described in words.

Once Ye Yuan died, all the heavens would no longer have an existence that could pose a threat to Progenitor anymore!

Hegemon Samsara and Progenitor Heavenless similarly could not!

As long as enough Blood Ward Beads were saved up, Progenitor would be able to come into being and break through the shackles that no one had ever broken through before, transcending the Great Beyond!

Therefore, he was overjoyed!

“Lord Bloodpromise is mighty!”

“Lord Bloodpromise is our blood race’s number one meritorious official!”

…..

Far away, the blood race’s powerhouses were unbelievably invigorated.

Killing Ye Yuan was even more important than winning this great battle.

Dong!

Just as they were happy, a loud noise came from above the void.

The dense God-Burying Flowers collapsed with a loud bang!

Originally, flying flowers drifted, natural and unrestrained.

Now, fallen flowers lay strewn all over the footpaths, the sun setting in the west mountain!

This sound came too suddenly, resulting in everyone not reacting in time.

But, directly scattering the flying flowers all over the sky, this visual effect was too strong.

However, this was just the prelude!

Fine cracks actually appeared in the surrounding space.

The entire void was like a broken mirror, cracks spreading out like cobwebs.

Following that, the void trembled. Many Hegemon Realm powerhouses actually could not stand firm and fell one after another!

Bloodpromise’s expression changed drastically, his figure swaying with uncertainty.

Suddenly, a formidable force passed through space, directly transmitting onto his body.

“Pffft!”

Bloodpromise spurted a mouthful of blood wildly, directly being blasted flying out.

He was shocked to the extreme. Until now, he completely did not know where this attack came from!

But he knew that this was absolutely Ye Yuan’s work!

That sound not only interrupted his casting, making the God-Burying Flowers all over the sky directly crumble, it even seriously injured him!

But what on earth did Ye Yuan do?

At this point, he actually still had a trump card?

The fragmented flowers dissipated; a figure emerged.

When everyone saw him, their pupils constricted!

Under Ye Yuan’s feet, fine cracks spread out. It was actually the center of all the cracks.

His body was incomparably tragic, wounds and scars everywhere.

However, Ye Yuan’s current imposing momentum was powerful to the extreme.

This was a kind of momentum, like saber momentum or spear momentum, but it was not on the same level at all.

Ye Yuan’s momentum was seemingly going to trample this blue sky to pieces!

He was merely an Emperor Sakra Heaven.

But, the tyrannical aura that was spilling from his body currently, it actually suppressed Mi Tian, Yi Xue, and the rest of the Great Beyond powerhouses.

It was as if he was the only sovereign under this stretch of sky!

“What a strong momentum! I’ve never thought that momentum could actually be so strong! Could it be that this is his final trump card?” Yi Xue’s pupils constricted as he said in shock.

This move of Ye Yuan’s already exceeded his imagination.

This move was unparalleled among his contemporaries!

Although his cultivation realm was significantly higher than Ye Yuan, it was also impossible for him to unleash such a terrifying move even if he exerted all his strength!

Fresh blood spurted wildly from Bloodpromise’s mouth, and he roared angrily, “W-What move is this!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coldly, “Ever since gaining enlightenment on the Heaven volume, I had a new breakthrough in my understanding of Heavenly Dao again! Finally, I achieved mastery through a comprehensive study of my lifetime’s learning, and created this move: Heaven Trampling Five Steps! Just now, it was the first form: Trampling Mountains and Rivers with One Step, Quiet Extermination of All Things Like the Night! Now, I’ll let you witness the second form: Trampling the Eight Desolates with Two Steps, Inverting the Universe Myriad Extinction!”

Ye Yuan did not talk nonsense, his foot slowly raising. His entire person’s imposing momentum actually rose to another level on top of the original basis!

The firmament quivered!

Crack!

Crack!

Crack!

Terrifying tribulation clouds condensed and formed above the void.

Seemingly issuing a warning with regards to Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum.

Bloodpromise’s complexion was deathly pale. Under this imposing momentum, he could not give birth to any desire to resist at all.

If Ye Yuan just now was the monarch who overlooked the world proudly.

Then Ye Yuan now was the emperor who ruled all life!

Everything had to submit under his feet!

But, seeing the tribulation clouds, Bloodpromise seemed to have grasped the last life-saving straw!

“Hahahaha … Heaven trampling! Heaven trampling! You’re going against heaven and will not be tolerated by Heavenly Dao! No matter how strong this move of yours is, so what? Heavenly Dao … won’t tolerate you!” Bloodpromise pointed at Ye Yuan and said crazily.

Ye Yuan looked at him like looking at an idiot and said coolly, “I’m a divergent cultivator to begin with. What do I fear going against heaven! If Heavenly Dao doesn’t tolerate me, I’ll trample this Heavenly Dao underfoot!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In the next instant, Ye Yuan seemed to have exhausted all the strength in his body, stepping down!

At this moment, that tiny body of Ye Yuan’s seemed to be as high as heaven and earth, akin to a celestial deity!

Boom!

The void trembled heavily!

The surrounding space directly shattered!

The void turbulent currents flooded in crazily.

Extreme Medicine Sect’s mountain pass gates fell apart to pieces under his stomp!

Extreme Medicine Sect’s various mountain peaks and ranges were leveled to the ground at this instant!

.

The scariest thing was that the terrifying tribulation cloud was actually directly scattered under this stomp of Ye Yuan’s!

Bloodpromise looked at this scene dumbfoundedly, already forgetting his shock.

What did he see?

That tribulation cloud could easily exterminate a Peak Hegemon!

But, under this stomp of Ye Yuan’s, it actually did not even have strength left to retaliate.

Could it be that Ye Yuan had already reached a state above Heavenly Dao?

But very soon, he felt at ease.

A force that was even more terrifying than earlier, transmitted over from god knows where.

His body was directly reduced to nothingness under this force!

Ye Yuan put Feng Xiaotian down, his expression somber as he said, “Brother Feng, I’ve avenged your enmity toward Bloodpromise on your behalf!”
