Chapter 1308: Wang Family’s Humiliation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hey, kid, the family head isn’t free today. You go back first. If you want to meet him, wait here tomorrow morning!”

A steward-like middle-aged man was currently shouting at Ye Yuan rudely.

Three days had already passed since Ye Yuan entered the Liang Family to rescue someone.

During these three days’ time, Ye Yuan waited at the Wang Family’s gate-house every day early in the morning.

All the way until the sun set, what he got was all the same sentence.

Ye Yuan knew that this was Wang Lingbo deliberately hanging him out to dry.

But Ye Yuan did not reveal the slightest hint of unhappiness. He just clasped his hands slightly at that doorman and bade his farewell.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, the doorman also felt somewhat surprised.

“This kid is really tenacious. If it were others, they wouldn’t be able to take it long ago,” the doorman muttered to himself.

These few days, they changed ways to make things difficult for Ye Yuan, various kinds of suddenly turning hostile, even pouring tea on Ye Yuan’s face. But Ye Yuan did not have any complaints. After smiling slightly, he stood at one side and waited again.

Just today, a Wang Family’s descendant came to the gate-house and gave Ye Yuan a beating with blocking the way as the reason. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Yuan still did not fight back when beaten and did not talk back when scolded.

Honestly speaking, even the doorman himself also could not quite look on anymore.

If it were others, they would have long left in a rage.

But Ye Yuan forcefully endured it.

The time limit that Ye Yuan set for himself was five days. After five days, if Wang Lingbo was still not willing to meet, he would cultivate himself, and refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill!

Ye Yuan had sought a heaven-grade Detoxification Pill from Fengping. After Liang Wanru consumed it, it temporarily suppressed the spread of the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s poison.

Fortunately, the heaven-grade Detoxification Pill was effective enough and was able to delay the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s poison for 40 days before flaring up again.

This way, Ye Yuan would have 40 days of buffer time.

The refining difficulty of the Detoxification Pill was much greater than the Divine Essence Pill.

But to Ye Yuan, this was an incidental thing.

According to Dustless’s way of saying, the next step was to practice refining the Detoxification Pill. It just happened to lay down the foundation for the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill.

However, Ye Yuan had to first cultivate the Divine Essence Pill to divine-grade.

This task was very difficult. Ye Yuan himself also did not know whether or not it could be completed, and he also could not bear to watch Liang Wanru suffer.

Therefore, being aware that the Wang Family was deliberately insulting him, he also forcefully tolerated it.

Fortunes changed, there would come a day where the Wang Family had to pay the price for their actions.

Luo Jian followed behind Ye Yuan unhurriedly; a glimmer flashed across his eyes.

This kind of look was rare on him.

“Haha, Brother, it’s really liberating! You really don’t know how arrogant this brat was at the Liang Family that day! I didn’t expect that he doesn’t even dare to let out a fart until now! Looks like that little girl still has some means, to actually enthrall this boy until he loses his head, willingly suffering such humiliation for her.”

Getting to know the ‘fruits’ of these few days, Wang Pianran laughed very delightedly.

Wang Lingbo smiled faintly and said, “This boy is arrogant at heart and haughty in manner, but can suffer such humiliation. This determination isn’t easy to deal with! This kind of person, if can’t become friends with, then there’s ... only making him die!”

But Wang Pianran was indifferent as she said, “Brother, you worry too much! Just a cripple. If not relying on the Myriad Treasure Tower, he’d die however I want to make him die!”

Wang Lingbo glanced at this foolish sister of his, shook his head, and said no more.

He called the doorman over and instructed, “Tomorrow morning, when that boy comes, directly lead him to the great hall.”

...

The next day, when Ye Yuan showed up at the Wang Family’s great hall, Wang Lingbo, Wang Pianran, Liang Wanrong, were already waiting in an arranged order, in the solemn manner of a tri-hall joint hearing.

Ye Yuan did not mind either. He just clasped his hands at Wang Lingbo and said, “Ye Yuan has seen Family Head Lingbo!”

Wang Lingbo narrowed his eyes as if he did not see Ye Yuan at all. His attitude was very haughty.

“You’re the Myriad Treasure Tower’s newly promoted guest alchemist?”

“Yes!”

“Looks very ordinary! You’re looking for me for the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s antidote?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right? Miss Wanru is at any rate Family Head Lingbo’s niece. Hope that you can raise your hand in mercy and let her off!”

“Huhu, niece? Ye Yuan, you’re telling bald-faced lies here! My brother only has one niece, that is Rong-er! That whore, if she dies, she dies! To dare be mentioned in the same breath with my family’s Rong-er?” Wang Pianran giggled.

That face piled up with fats looked incomparably hideous.

Wang Lingbo said coolly, “What Pianran said is right, that lass has no blood relations with me at all, on what basis should I save her? Or is it that you can take out something that can move this family head?”

While talking, a glint flashed across Wang Lingbo’s eyes.

Beast taming arts that could command a late-stage Tier 1 divine beast, even Wang Lingbo also had to be tempted.

Ye Yuan looked at Wang Lingbo and said coolly, “I know that you all want the beast taming art, but I don’t have any beast taming arts at all!”

Wang Pianran immediately berated, “Do you take us to be three-year-old children? You, a cripple, but can control a late-stage Tier 1 divine beast. Without beast taming arts, how can you possibly do it?”

Ye Yuan did not talk nonsense. A surge of faint dragon pressure was released.

Feeling this surge of dragon wave, Wang Lingbo’s pupils constricted.

Although this bout of pressure was not strong, it was indeed an authentic dragon race pressure!

He finally knew that Ye Yuan was not lying, his eyes revealing a thick look of disappointment.

His face turned cold, and he said, “Since you don’t have beast taming arts, then what right do you have to make me save an unrelated person? Moreover, that lass’s existence is a threat to Rong-er in itself!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “This Ye has nothing valuable. But, as long as Family Head is willing to save Miss Rong-er, this Ye is willing to refine pills for the Wang Family for 10 years, and not take a single cent!”

Wang Lingbo smiled disdainfully and said, “Do you really think that I’ll believe that you’re some guest alchemist? An alchemist would go and seek help from Feng Ping? Just a cripple, what medicinal pills can you refine? However ... I can give you a chance. If you accomplish it, it’s not that I can’t save that girl.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Family Head, please say.”

Wang Lingbo smiled coldly and said, “Your actions, Rong-er is very upset. She has already cried about it to me several times! As long as you can make her happy, it’s not impossible for this family head to save her.”

Liang Wanrong walked down from the hall at this time, circled around Ye Yuan twice, and said smugly, “Boy, didn’t think that you’d land in this young lady’s hands one day, right? Weren’t you very cocky? Didn’t you look down on this young lady? If you have the capabilities, say it one more time!”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and bowed deeply to Liang Wanrong and said, “It was this Ye who was rude, hope that Miss Wanrong doesn’t take offense!”

Liang Wanrong said delightedly, “Want me to not take offense, also can! I just have one request, kneel down, and call this young lady grand-aunt thrice! Maybe if I’m happy, I’ll let Uncle give you the antidote!”

Behind Ye Yuan, Luo Jian involuntarily gripped his sword, truly somewhat unable to look on anymore.

But all of a sudden, Liang Wanrong’s gaze became hazy. Her complexion became flushed, and she pounced toward Wang Lingbo.
