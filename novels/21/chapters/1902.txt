Chapter 1906: Conditions

Outside the city, there was a densely packed army. Three great True God powerhouses were at the front.

Ahead, Ye Yuan’s sword detained Yu Jinsong, bringing Jiang Jadehall falling back.

“Brat, we’ve already let him go and you’re still not letting him go, aren’t you afraid of Heavenly Dao’s backlash?” That Second Firmament True God said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You all followed all the way, isn’t it to wait to kill me after I let him go?”

“Humph! Do you think that you can escape? The monk can run, but the temple can’t run! Unless you disregard the life and death of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City!” Yu Jinsong said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan already swore a Heavenly Dao Oath, so he was not afraid that Ye Yuan would not let him go. Hence, he also became brazen and unbridled.

Ye Yuan’s bottom-line, the City Lord Manor had long investigated it inside out. Yu Jinsong knew that using this to threaten Ye Yuan was definitely useful.

Who knew that Ye Yuan replied coolly, “You can send people to destroy Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, I’m powerless to stop it too. But, starting from today, you’ll have to keep your nerves constantly tensed. Otherwise, maybe someday, you’ll become a deceased soul under my sword.”

Yu Jinsong’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “You’re threatening me? Do you know how many True God powerhouses my City Lord Manor has?”

Ye Yuan was still calm as he said, “I’m just expounding a fact. There were many True God powerhouses present today too, but they failed to protect you.”

The moment these words came out, not just Yu Jinsong, those few True God powerhouses also had awkward faces.

Yu Jinsong’s expression flickered incessantly. He was really scared.

Ye Yuan came and went like a shadow. Furthermore, he was extremely adept in spatial law. It was truly impossible to guard against. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

What was more terrifying was that blue space!

After he was taken into the Divine Vestige Space by Ye Yuan, his entire person did not have any strength to resist at all.

The various kinds of powers of law that he grasped actually all lost effect!

That feeling of powerlessness still made him have lingering fear in his heart until now.

He did not wish to experience that sort of feeling again!

At the thought of being stalked everyday by such a bizarre person, Yu Jinsong unwittingly felt chills up his spine.

Yu Jinsong gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “You! Consider yourself ruthless!”

Bureaucratic play and trickery, resorting to schemes and intrigues, it had always been his, Yu Jinsong’s, forte. He had never failed before.

Did not expect that today, all of his methods were cracked by this mysterious Ye Yuan. This made him extremely vexed in his heart.

Suddenly, the tip of Ye Yuan’s eyebrows moved, and he said coolly, “Since you came, why do you not dare to show up openly?”

No one answered him. Those city guards looked around, but could not see any figure and even thought that Ye Yuan ate the wrong medicine.

Even those few True God powerhouses were also at a loss.

Ye Yuan pinned Yu Jinsong, his figure moving slightly, appearing somewhere else.

“Still not appearing?” Ye Yuan said again.

Suddenly, two figures emerged.

A black-robed middle-aged man and a gray-robed old man.

“C-City Lord Your Excellency!”

“Lord Academy Head!”

City Lord Manor’s Second Firmament True God and Fei Mingtian cried out in surprise at the same time.

Arriving here, Fei Mingtian naturally followed too.

These two were none other than precisely the Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s city lord, Yu Wenfeng, as well as Kongming Academy’s academy head, Li Kongming!

Li Kongming looked at Ye Yuan, a hint of surprise flashing across his eyes as he said, “A fine young man. Looks like your attainment in spatial law is much stronger than this academy head imagined!”

Everyone all looked at Ye Yuan with incredible shock. They were very puzzled how Ye Yuan discovered these two apex figures.

One had to know, even those True God powerhouses did not have the slightest clue about these two people’s arrival!

Especially those few True God powerhouses, they even looked towards Ye Yuan in great shock.

Ye Yuan was able to discover Yu Wenfeng and Li Kongming, but they could not. This showed that Ye Yuan’s attainments in spatial law were far above theirs.

But Ye Yuan was just Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity!

Ye Yuan ignored Li Kongming. He said to another area of the void, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, the one hiding there is Pavilion Lord Linghua, right?”

Everyone was alarmed again. No one could have thought that Pavilion Lord Linghua also came personally!

Yu Wenfeng’s and Li Kongming’s faces changed slightly. They actually did not notice that there was still a person hiding in the void.

Concealing within the void, this was an extremely high-level concealment method.

Its degree of concealment was naturally greatly related to the martial artist’s application of spatial law.

Cultivation reaching the True God Realm, one’s small world was already very complete. The spatial law perceived through the small world would naturally be all the more powerful too.

It was just that the application of spatial law also differed from person to person.

Even for people in the same realm, there was a huge difference too.

Yu Wenfeng and Li Kongming had already discovered the other party long ago. It was just that they did not even discover Pavilion Lord Linghua. This showed that Pavilion Lord Linghua already surpassed them in this aspect.

Of course, this was just a minor trick to powerhouses of their level.

They concealed in the void, unable to give away any aura. Once there was any activity, the other party would detect it. Even using it to sneak attack would not do as well.

But even so, Pavilion Lord Linghua also became all the more mysterious because of this.

To powerhouses of this level, any hint of subtle difference could have the possibility of turning into victory.

This concealment method was the hardest to discover.

But the three of them, not a single one was actually able to escape Ye Yuan’s arcane sights!

How could everyone not be shocked?

The black-robed Pavilion Lord Linghua slowly revealed his figure. It was just that he was hidden in the black robe, unable for the others to see him clearly.

“Young man, you’re really great! Do you have an interest in joining my Linghua Pavilion?” Pavilion Lord Linghua slowly said.

Yu Wenfeng’s and Li Kongming’s expressions changed. No one could have expected that Pavilion Lord Linghua solicited the moment he opened his mouth.

“Ye Yuan, you mustn’t! Kongming Academy is your home!” Li Kongming hurriedly said.

Yu Wenfeng also spoke up, “Ye Yuan, as long as you join the City Lord Manor, the matter today will be written off, I’ll confer you the land of a hundred cities!”

When these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar!

Land of a hundred cities, how much resources did it possess? How many martial artists did it also possess, and how powerful of a faction could be developed?

To martial artists, this was absolutely an irresistible temptation!

As long as Ye Yuan agreed, he would virtually be equivalent to the lord of a small imperial capital.

Originally they thought that the three great apex powerhouses came out in order to go to war with Ye Yuan, but they did not expect that it was actually this situation.

“Father, I ...”

“Shut up! It’s none of your business here!”

Yu Jinsong was just about to speak when he was cut off by Yu Wenfeng heartlessly.

Ye Yuan looked at Pavilion Lord Linghua and said coolly, “Want me to join Linghua Pavilion, it’s also not impossible. But I have a condition!”

“What condition?”

Everyone’s hearts leaped up, especially Yu Wenfeng and Li Kongming’s.

“Hand Rong Xiyue over to me!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Pavilion Lord Linghua fell silent for a moment and spoke up, “You can change to another condition!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said coolly, “I’m only stating the condition, whether to agree or not is up to you.”

Finished talking, he turned to Yu Wenfeng and said coolly, “I don’t want the land of a hundred cities. I only want Yu Jinsong’s life! If you agree, I’ll join the City Lord Manor!”
