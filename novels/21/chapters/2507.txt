Chapter 2513: One Finger!

Above the void, a figure flickered, moving 100 thousand miles in an instant.

Leaving Heavenly Eagle, Ye Yuan headed to Heavenspan Mountain at the fastest speed!

He judged that if that person behind the Eight Extreme Divinities came to the Heavenspan World, the greatest likelihood would be Heavenspan Mountain.

Ahead, the Heavenspan Mountain was faintly visible.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, an extremely fast figure brushed past him!

At virtually the same time, the two people’s figures suddenly came to a pause.

Following that, the two people each turned around and looked at the other person.

Opposite Ye Yuan was a young man in blue Taoist robes. It was precisely that person who came down from the sky!

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, immediately feeling tremendous pressure.

He could not see through this young man!

Actually, the blue-robed youth did not deliberately apply pressure on him. The smile on his face was also very warm, as if harmless to man and beast.

But it was precisely because there was no pressure that Ye Yuan’s pressure was akin to a mountain!

The him who was already invincible in the Heavenspan World saw another tall mountain!

The blue-robed youth sized up Ye Yuan and said smilingly, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, you should be the Ye Yuan that they were talking about.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said with a nod, “You’re the Eight Extreme Divinities’ true self?”

The blue-robed youth smiled and said,?“Huhu,?that’s right! Looks like the one who destroyed the Eight Extreme Divinities is you. No mistakes!?Mmm,?grand completion Mortal Stratum, low-grade chaos origin divinity, five power of rules. You’re indeed somewhat different from the other ants! In this abandoned world, you actually fumbled out the method to advance to Heavenly Stratum yourself! You have the qualification to be my servant. Kneel down and receive the gift. In the future … the Heavenspan World will be managed by you.”

Unexpectedly, the blue-robed youth did not make a move to deal with Ye Yuan but wanted to take him in as a servant instead.

The tone was so natural and logical.

But Ye Yuan felt his hair stand on end.

He seemed to be stark naked in front of the other party.

There was no secret from head to toe.

The blue-robed youth casually spoke and saw through all of his trump cards!

Terrifying!

Although Ye Yuan was mentally prepared long ago, at this moment, he was still shocked to the core.

He really wanted to know what kind of existences were above the Heavenspan Mountain!

The blue-robed youth said coolly,?“Mn??You’re not willing? You should know the outcome of showing unwillingness.”

Ye Yuan frowned and said in a solemn voice, “You made use of the Eight Extreme Divinities to impart Dao teachings. Then you collected those things in the divine souls. What is it for?”

The blue-robed youth stood with his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “Looks like you know quite a bit! No harm telling you either. Although you all, these ants, are of little use, the essence of your divine souls are still a little useful. It can help me cultivate the origin divinity. The Heavenly Dao that the divine race cultivates, is actually just the Dao teachings that I passed down. When they cultivate Heavenly Dao, they will offer their own divine soul essence to me. And the people they killed, the other party’s essence of the divine soul will be absorbed and will enter the Eight Extreme Space. This is the glory of you ants!”

At this time, a large number of powerhouses already gathered around in the distance.

Hearing this, they were all extremely indignant.

Only then did they understand that they were merely wild animals being reared in pens!

In the eyes of the blue-robed youth, they were nothing more than a grain of dust, their life or death insignificant.

Angry but also powerless!

They all, these powerhouses that came down from the Heavenspan Mountain, had already witnessed the blue-robed youth’s might.

“Really damn it! The Heavenspan World’s trillions of living things are actually being toyed with in the palm of his hand!”

“What Doomsday Battle, what war between two races, really a joke! It’s really laughable!”

“Lord Saint Azure, the Heavenspan World’s everything will be relying on you!”

… …

At this time, all of the powerhouses put their hopes on Ye Yuan.

They knew that the only hope was Ye Yuan!

Even Dao Ancestors did not have the strength to fight back under the hands of the blue-robed youth. Who else could they still count on?

But at this time, the corners of the blue-robed youth’s mouth curled slightly, and he flicked his fingers.

Only to hear the sound of air howling!

Puu, puu, puu?…

Several hundred Deva powerhouses, Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, directly vanished without a trace!

“Huhu,?ants don’t have the right to be angry! All you need to know is that I’m heaven! The supreme heaven! You all can only grovel at my feet!” The blue-robed youth had a faint smile as if he had done a trivial thing.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, a suffocating pressure coming at him head-on!

Too strong!

A flick of a finger eradicated hundreds of Devas and Heavenly Emperors!

The crux was that he could not feel the slightest trace of divine essence undulation, and also could not feel the slightest rule undulation.

It was just a flick of a finger!

If Ye Yuan wanted to kill people, these Devas and Heavenly Emperors were naturally nothing.

But he absolutely could not do it in such an effortless manner!

Seeing Ye Yuan’s shocked eyes, the blue-robed youth was very satisfied.

He said with a faint smile, “Saw that? It’s not the disparity of strength between you and me, but the disparity in life-order! In front of Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, all are ants! You’re the sovereign of a world, proud to the extreme. But in front of me, you don’t have any capital to be proud of! I only need to move a finger and I’ll be able to easily kill you! Taking you in as a servant is your highest glory, understand?”

The blue-robed youth paused for a while and said, “Now, kneel down and accept the gift!”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and forcefully dragged himself back from shock.

Then he slowly opened his mouth and said, “I refuse!”

The blue-robed youth was not very surprised. He just smiled faintly and said, “You’ll die.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He was really calm and collected!

Nothing could make his emotions fluctuate.

How could an ant possibly cause a celestial deity to have fluctuations in emotions?

Ye Yuan’s gaze gradually turned cold and he said, “Before fighting, who knows?”

He, Ye Yuan, had never lowered his head in front of a powerhouse before.

A scholar prefers death to humiliation!

Back then, he was just Empyrean Realm but dared to face off against the powerful Nineorigin.

This kind of battle, he had already experienced no idea how many of them.

This time was no exception either.

However, the blue-robed youth did not get angry. He still had a faint smile as he said, “Very well, I’ll give you this chance! I’ll use one finger against you. If you can force me to use a hand, you’ll have the qualification to know my name!”

One finger!

These words were rampant to the extreme!

The Heavenspan World powerhouses in the distances were similarly astonished to the extreme!

Ye Yuan was the Heavenspan World’s sovereign!

The well-deserved number one person!

Now, this blue-robed youth was actually going to use one finger to fight!

Was this showing contempt?

No!

Everyone present could feel that this blue-robed youth was not the least bit complacent.

He was not overly conceited like a young genius. He just showed contempt for all life!

He looked at Ye Yuan with the eyes of looking at an ant from beginning to end!

Would heaven bother about ants?

No!

Because they were unworthy!

Ye Yuan’s gaze gradually became cold.

Boom!

A fearsome sword intent instantly enveloped the area of a thousand miles.

Universe Sword Formation!

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, it was his strongest move!

Because he knew that hiding his strength in front of the blue-robed youth was equivalent to courting death!

He had no retreat at all!

Situated inside the sword formation, the blue-robed youth still stood with his hands behind his back, using a scrutinizing gaze to look at the Universe Sword Formation. He nodded his head slightly.
