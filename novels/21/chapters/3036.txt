Chapter 3035: First Place, Lackluster!

“The first place is actually not Ye Yuan?” Feng Qingxuan stared at the All-Heavens List, her brows slightly furrowed.

In her view, Ye Yuan was the well-deserved number one.

What was with this Yang Qing?

“In my view, he shouldn’t have climbed the Vertical Heaven Stairs yet, right? He comprehended chaos Great Dao and also fused with the four great true spirit bloodlines. It’s impossible to be worse than us,” Long He said.

His results were pretty good too, squeezing into the top five.

After losing to Ye Yuan, Long He also reflected on the bitter lesson, and he actually broke through to half chaos grade bloodline a few days ago!

“This time, the geniuses in all the heavens will definitely be making a move. The competition will be extremely fierce! But, up until now, the vast majority of the geniuses have already made a move. Is this guy deliberately going to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat at the end?” Feng Qingxuan said unhappily.

At this time, the competition of the All-Heavens List had already entered the white-hot stage.

The top ten names were constantly refreshing.

Wang Ningyan, Zuo Qingyang, and the others were already squeezed out of the top ten.

Even Feng Qingxuan was squeezed to third place too.

However, Yang Qing stood very firm and actually kept occupying the throne of first place!

Along with the passage of time, the geniuses from all the heavens became more and more shocked.

They were curious, just where on earth did this guy called Yang Qing pop out from?

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was a low-level plane in the eyes of all the heavens’ powerhouses.

It should have been impossible for a true genius to appear here.

But it was in such a plane that actually suppressed the 33 Heavens’ countless geniuses!

They … were not convinced!

On the platform, Yang Qing looked at the All-Heavens List with somewhat waned interest.

His mouth curled and he said, “Ye Yuan this guy is really lame! Without him, so what even if I suppress the geniuses of myriad worlds? Sigh, boring! Really boring! Those guys haven’t come up yet?”

At this time, human heads were moving on Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s Vertical Heaven Stairs!

A large group of young powerhouses was following behind Ye Yuan with no end in sight!

What was different from other planes was that there were actually not many corpses on the Vertical Heaven Stairs here.

It was only to see Ye Yuan step on the highest step. He opened his mouth and said, “Everybody, watch closely!”

He held his palm out, a cluster of chaos divine essence condensed.

Then, chaos evolved, and myriad life was born. Ye Yuan seemed like a god who controlled the world.

A lingering charm of Dao arose spontaneously.

Ye Yuan put away the divine ability and said, “Understood?”

Some people’s eyes were bright, clearly understanding fully.

Some people’s eyes were somewhat confused.

Some people simply shook their heads.

Ye Yuan said, “I’ll demonstrate again. Everyone watch closely! If you still don’t understand, just back out!”

Hence, Ye Yuan demonstrated the Dao just now again.

Those hazy eyes previously also became bright at this time.

“I got it!”

“I got it too!”

“Heavenly Saint Ye’s Dao elucidation really goes from the easy to the difficult and complicated! What I originally didn’t understand suddenly dawned upon me! Even if I can’t climb up the Vertical Heaven Stairs, this trip wasn’t in vain too!”

“Many thanks, Heavenly Saint Ye! We’ll be leaving!”

… …

In the back row, some people gave Ye Yuan a bow and withdrew from the Vertical Heaven Stairs.

In the Vertical Heaven Stairs, one could choose to withdraw within a certain range.

But, once you rushed onto the steps blindly and entered the scope of Great Dao where you were muddleheaded, it would be dangerous.

Those people who were crushed to death by Great Dao were all like this.

If there were geniuses from all the heavens here, they would definitely be shocked to the extreme.

Ye Yuan actually controlled Great Dao in front of everyone!

He was actually going to bring these people behind him and climb the Vertical Heaven Stairs together!

This was simply amazing!

Originally, Yang Qing had also mustered all his strength, preparing to compete with Ye Yuan.

Who knew that Ye Yuan did not have the intention of competing at all. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Therefore, his first place was obtained boringly.

The Great Dao pressure on the Vertical Heaven Stairs was very strong and also very abstruse.

But, to the Ye Yuan who had already comprehended Chaos Great Dao, it was very easy to understand.

This was Heavenless’ Dao and not the true Heavenly Dao.

Furthermore, the Great Dao pressure in the Vertical Heaven Stairs was only targeted at those under Hegemon Realm.

Hegemon Realms entering the Vertical Heaven Stairs would make the Vertical Heaven Stairs directly crumble.

Therefore, in the inheritance battle this time, Hegemon Realms were unable to enter.

Ye Yuan evolved the Great Dao in the Vertical Heaven Stairs with the method of the chaos divine essence. It was very intuitive and very easy to understand.

To many people who had decent talent, they understood in a snap.

And those people who could not understand, even if they climbed the Vertical Heaven Stairs, it was useless too.

Time slowly passed, and the people behind Ye Yuan got fewer and fewer, but their strength got stronger and stronger.

Going up the stairs, they had walked for half a year long!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan leaped and climbed onto the platform.

Yang Qing had a look of excitement and could not resist posturing as he said, “Hahaha, you finally came up! Quickly come to the All-Heavens List and take a look, I, Emperor Azuresky, suppress myriad worlds, valiantly taking the All-Heavens List’s first place! Originally, if you competed with this emperor, you might have been able to scrape through with a second place, but a pity, a pity!”

Before his voice faded, one figure after another flew out of the passageway and landed on the platform.

At this time, the crowd was like a group of fish in the ocean currents; densely packed, making Yang Qing see things in a blur.

Ye Yuan was somewhat surprised as he said, “33 Heavens, the geniuses are as plentiful as oxen fur. You actually suppressed the geniuses of myriad races?”

He knew that Yang Qing was formidable but did not expect that Yang Qing was actually so impressive.

Disregarding other things, he knew that Feng Qingxuan’s and Long He’s talents, both belonged to extremely strong existences!

He did not expect that they were suppressed by Yang Qing too.

“Hahaha,?that’s of course! What kind of genius is this emperor? What do the geniuses of all the heavens and myriad races count for?” Yang Qing showed off.

Ye Yuan arrived at the All-Heavens List and shockingly saw that Yang Qing’s name was ranked first, and he could not help clicking his tongues in wonder.

But very soon, Yang Qing could not laugh anymore.

This was because he discovered that the people coming out of the passageway were seriously too many!

Very soon, the platform became a little crowded.

“How many people … did you freaking bring up?” Yang Qing was speechless.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Roughly a million people.”

Yang Qing drew a cold breath and said, “A-A million?”

Yang Qing was clear in his heart about Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s strength.

This Vertical Heaven Stairs was absolutely not that easy to climb too.

Otherwise, this would not be a selection of geniuses. It would be a sect assessment.

According to Yang Qing’s estimation, it would already be very impressive if Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven could have 3000 people climb to the summit.

After all, the quality of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s martial artists was placed there.

Coupled with consecutive years of war and countless geniuses dying, 3000 people were already the limit.

But Ye Yuan actually brought a million people up.

What kind of concept was this?

He forcibly expanded this limit by more than 300 times!

Was this fellow still human?

Dao could be understood but not expressed with words!

Unable to explain clearly with words!

Those able to explain Dao were all immensely formidable individuals!

But Ye Yuan was just Emperor Vast Heaven!

Those who came up together with him, there were even quite a few who were Emperor Sakra Heaven, and even origin realm powerhouses.

Did … this still make any sense?

Originally, he was still patting himself on the back for getting first place.

But now, he felt that it was lackluster.
