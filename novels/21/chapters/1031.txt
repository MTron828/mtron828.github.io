Chapter 1035: Let Him Run First

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At the end, the pill formula that Han Qing Zi picked for the two people was the Purple Clarity Jadeheaven Pill.

The Purple Clarity Jadeheaven Pill was a high-grade Tier 9 medicinal pill. The difficulty level was intermediate. To high-rank Alchemy Emperors, it was also not that easy to be able to refine.

Of course, with Zuo Qing’s strength, refining it should not be too big of a problem. It was just the question of grade.

Toward this, Ye Yuan had a look of indifference.

Zuo Qing sneered coldly in his heart: “Pretentious! I’ll see until when you can pretend like that!”

“Begin then!” Han Qing said coolly.

Zuo Qing already mustered up enough power. Under Han Qing Zi’s command, his palm shook and directly shattered the spirit medicines on the table to dust.

Shattering medicine and condensing the embryo!

The moment Zuo Qing made his move, his technique astounded everyone.

Zuo Qing was also considered an example of striving harder after knowing humiliation. After being defeated by Ye Yuan, he did not fall into low spirits. He cultivated with all his might instead. Within a short 300 years time, he reached the boundary of high-rank Alchemy Emperor.

Within 300 years from initial-rank Alchemy Emperor to high-rank Alchemy Emperor, this was a very impressive achievement.

Not everyone could be as freakish as Ye Yuan, to be able to accomplish to this extent within a short several dozen years.

In truth, when Ye Yuan left Cloudmarsh City, he was already a middle-rank Alchemy Emperor.

Those few years, Ye Yuan’s pill battle intensity was tremendous. But he also learned from others’ strong points and was also a massive improvement to his alchemy Dao strength.

Therefore, that was why Zuo Qing’s achievements would be overshadowed when placed in front of Ye Yuan.

When Zuo Qing was still middle-rank Alchemy Emperor, Ye Yuan was already on equal footing with those apex powerhouses in the Divine Realm.

As Cloudmarsh City’s deputy city lord, Zuo Qing normally would not easily take action either.

Making a move here today displayed his profound skills.

Except, Ye Yuan did something that astounded people even more. He walked right out of the array formation and started chatting with Han Qing Zi.

Han Qing Zi was stupefied and immediately laughed in spite of himself as he said, “You brat, this is also looking down on Zuo Qing too much, right? No matter what, he’s also Cloudmarsh City’s deputy city lord now. His strength can’t be underestimated!”

Ye Yuan took a look at Zuo Qing and said with a faint smile, “Let him do it first. Otherwise, he’ll say that I bully him later.”

Zuo Qing was originally fully immersed in the process of shattering the medicines and condensing the embryo. But his eyes glimpsed toward Ye Yuan’s action, and he nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

Fortunately, his strength indeed stood above others and controlled those spirit medicines.

“This damn fellow, definitely infuriating me on purpose! Ignore him, as long as I refine the medicinal pill, this guy will lose for sure!” Zuo Qing cursed inwardly.

Actually, Ye Yuan was really not angering him. In Ye Yuan’s view, once alchemists enter the pill refining state, they would devote their heart and soul into it. How could they still have the thought to care about others?

But Zuo Qing just took notice of him!

First of all, on focus, Zuo Qing lost to Ye Yuan by more than a level.

Ye Yuan just purely felt that this sort of pill battle had no difficulty to speak of to him at all.

Refining high-grade Tier 9 medicinal pills was nothing difficult for him.

Refining the Nine Truth Pill the last time, Ye Yuan was just pursuing the strongest medicinal effect, that was why he would bring out his full strength.

However, the moment Zuo Qing made his move just now, he already lost interest in the pill battle.

Too weak!

Ye Yuan’s shattering medicine and condensing medicinal embryo, and Zuo Qing’s shattering medicine and condensing medicinal embryo, the two were different.

When experts made their move, the genuine and the fake would become clear at a glance. Zuo Qing’s shattering medicine and condensing the embryo was completely unable to fully unleash the medicinal effects of the spirit medicines. His level of skill was still far too lacking.

Han Qing Zi shook his head and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “In that case, he doesn’t have any hope at all?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not even a shred.”

Han Qing Zi sighed slightly and said, “Looks like these 20 years, not only did your alchemy Dao strength not decline, it grew with each passing day instead!”

Ye Yuan said, “Aren’t you the same too?”

Han Qing Zi shook his head and said, “That’s different! This lifetime, you probably put most of your effort on the Martial Path, right? But hearing the news of your demise back then, this old man was still really stunned for a long time.”

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “It’s still Elder Brother, you, who are concerned about me! Some old fellows were probably thrilled until they skipped around when they heard the news of my demise, right? Uh ... including that guy over there.”

Han Qing Zi said with a smile, “This old man doesn’t have any conflicts of interest with you either. I naturally won’t look forward to you dying. If you can really seek out the path of Deity Realm, it might even let us, these old fellows, receive endless benefits!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “How can the path of Deity Realm be so easy? For 100 thousand years, how many astonishing talented people could not do it, let alone me?”

Han Qing Zi scolded laughingly, “You punk, being insincere with your words!”

The two people exchanged a glance, and both started laughing.

These two people had a lively conversation and muddled the people below the stage silly.

It was true that Lord Qingyun Zi was their idol. But slighting Lord Zuo Qing like this was also looking down on people too much, right? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After all, Lord Qingyun Zi was only an initial-rank Alchemy Emperor currently!

Could it be that Lord Qingyun Zi seizing possession and reviving, his personality also suffered influence?

No one would have thought that this chat would be an entire day’s time.

Han Qing Zi and Ye Yuan, the two people conversed very engrossedly. At times, they laughed heartily. Sometimes, their brows knitted despondently, as if completely forgotten about the pill battle.

Refining high-grade Tier 9 medicinal pills, at least needed three day’s time to be able to form the pill too.

But Ye Yuan wasted a day just like that. How could he still compete?”

All the way until the second day noon, Ye Yuan slowly got up and said, “Elder Brother, let’s catch up later. I’ll send this guy packing first.”

Han Qing Zi nodded his head and said smilingly, “You got to pay close attention. With this waste, it’s a day and a half’s time.”

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Relax, definitely coming out before this guy.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan directly entered the array formation.

But Han Qing Zi’s expression turned solemn. Slow by a day and a half, and still could come out before Zuo Qing?

This point, even he himself could not do it either!

Could it be that reviving for these 20 years, Ji Qingyun’s alchemy Dao strength improvement was actually so great?

Ye Yuan came before the table, and his palm force likewise shook, directly shattering those Tier 9 spirit medicines to dust.

Similarly shattering medicines and condensing embryo, Ye Yuan’s move was far more beautiful compared to him!

Seeing this scene, Han Qing Zi’s expression became a little more solemn.

Reaching his level, who was better or lousier, was clear at a glance. Just this move, Ye Yuan’s strength was more than plenty to shake Zuo Qing off more than 10 streets behind!

“This brat’s control of essence energy seems to have become more exquisite! Really a freak!” Han Qing Zi muttered to himself.

The medicinal embryo’s refinement done, Ye Yuan urged with one hand, and the Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame started heating up the medicinal cauldron.

His technique was virtually identical with Xiao Ruyan and Ren Dong’s previously, like starting a fire to cook a meal.

But the moment he made his move, it was totally different from the two disciples.

“Really seeing ghosts! Clearly starting a fire to cook a meal, how can Lord Qingyun Zi’s Silent Offering make people feast their eyes upon it like so?”

“Lord Qingyun Zi is Lord Qingyun Zi! Before reincarnating, how many years has it been since we’ve seen him take action already! This is the style of a peak Alchemy Emperor!”

“But he’s already slow by a day and a half’s time. Can he catch up to Lord Zuo Qing’s rate of progress?”
