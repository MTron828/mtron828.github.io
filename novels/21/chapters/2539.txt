Chapter 2545: Searching House and Confiscating Property!

The expressions of Tang Yu father and son changed drastically. They did not expect that things were already so serious.

Someone clearly led the tempo!

It was just that at this time, they could not explain this even with a hundred mouths! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Xie Hua gave a cold laugh and said, “In accord with the will of the people, could it be that this Xie can still frame you all? If you want to slap my face, this Xie’s face, also can. Let that one pointer ascender come out and refine a heavenly pill in public. This Xie will apologize to your Tang Family!”

Tang Yu’s expression was very ugly. Because calling Ye Yuan out now was impossible.

A month ago, Ye Yuan directly announced terminal seclusion.

Disturbing Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion at this time, if it ruined his important thing, Ye Yuan would really kill people!

Seeing this father and son two people hesitate, Xie Hua sneered even harder as he said, “Why? Can’t call him out, or … he can’t refine pills at all?”

“Your Excellency, Ye Yuan is currently in terminal seclusion! How about this, after he exits seclusion, I’ll definitely give you an explanation!” Tang Yu was helpless and could only say this.

“Heh,?what a coincidence! The moment this Xie came, he entered terminal seclusion! Seems like after this news spread, he has been in closed-seclusion all along, right?” Xie Hua said with a smile that was not a smile.

“This …” Tang Yu had nothing to say in response.

Ye Yuan had never been willing to show up, he was also very helpless.

Everyone was also not to be blamed for misunderstanding. This sort of thing, no matter who, they would misunderstand too.

“Alright, enough crap! Since that ascender isn’t willing to come out, search the house and confiscate property for me!”

Under Xie Hua’s word of command, each and every one of the guards was like wolves and tigers, directly pouncing over.

Tang Jinhua’s expression changed drastically and he said in alarm and anger, “Lord Xie Hua, how can you do this? Our Tang Family is …”

Before he finished speaking, he was held back by Tang Yu.

Tang Yu knew that Father was going to bring up Second Prince in his moment of desperation.

But who was behind Xie Hua?

That was Nation Teacher Lin Lan!

How could a mere Second Prince be able to suppress Xie Hua?

It would be making a fool of himself, that’s all!

Xie Hua looked at Tang Yu and said with a smile, “Tang Yu, although you’re missing an arm, you’re getting smarter and smarter! So, are you planning on surrendering without resistance?”

Tang Yu had a grim expression as he said, “Xie Hua, you’ll regret it!”

Xie Hua laughed loudly and said, “In this Eastward Country, apart from Master and His Majesty, someone who can make this Xie regret hasn’t been born yet! Come, men! Tie him up for me!”

Beside Xie Hua, two burly men dashed out, giving Tang Yu a kick the moment they came up, directly kicking him on his abdomen, dropping him to his knees.

Tang Yu’s face was almost contorted from pain, vomiting a mouthful of blood with a cough.

But the burly men did not give him the chance to catch his breath at all, directly tying his hands behind his back.

Tying the Tang Family father and son up, Xie Hua took big steps and barged right into the Tang Family.

Upon inquiring, Xie Hua found Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion venue very quickly.

“Huhu,?knows how to choose places. It’s just that, putting on an appearance and being in closed-seclusion here, can you refine heavenly pills? What a joke! Trash will always be trash! How can ascenders possibly refine heavenly pills? Come, men! Break the door for me!” Xie Hua looked at the closed door and said with disdain.

Two upper Lesser Sublime Heaven guards rushed up and were about to break the door and enter.

But right at this time, the door erupted with rays of brilliant light. Rays of sword light turned into sword rain that filled the sky, rushing towards the two guards.

Bang, bang, bang?…

The two guards were caught off-guard and directly blasted flying out.

Xie Hua’s expression changed, revealing a look of shock.

He heard that this ascender was merely middle Lesser Sublime Heaven. How could the grand array that he laid down be so strong?

Xie Hua suddenly turned his head and looked toward the Tang Family father and son with their hands tied behind their backs, and said angrily, “You guys know that there are restrictions here?”

A hint of a sneer flashed across Tang Yu’s face.

Of course, he knew!

But, he did not say it!

Pah!

Xie Hua dealt a backhanded slap, flinging it fiercely onto Tang Yu’s face, directly slapping him flying out.

This slap was extremely heavy, half of Tang Yu’s face swelled up.

Xie Hua gave a cold snort and said, “Looks like you father and son won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin! Come, men! Give them a good beating for me!”

Under his word of command, several guards rushed up and boxed and kicked.

These guards were all not weak. Each fist hitting the flesh, the Tang Family father and son immediately had their skin flayed open and flesh torn.

When Xie Hua saw this scene, he felt a little better.

He gave a cold snort and said, “A mere restriction also wants to stop this Xie, also overestimating his own ability too much!”

He walked slowly towards the door, the imposing momentum on his body growing stronger and stronger.

Xie Hua was a grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven powerhouse, his strength was naturally not weak.

He did not believe that this lousy restriction could still stop him!

“Stop!” Just as he was prepared to make a move, a cold cry suddenly came over.

Xie Hua turned around to look and said with a smile, “So, it’s Second Prince and Master Yun who arrived. This Xie pays respect.”

His attitude was neither obsequiously nor haughtily, not taking the two people too seriously.

Second Prince went without saying, but even Lu Yun, he could overlook him.

Although Lu Yun and Lin Lan were similarly Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses, their statuses were like heaven and earth.

After all, Lin Lan was a heavenly alchemist, his status incomparably venerated, and he was even honored by the emperor as Nation Teacher.

Second Prince glared at Xie Hua and said, “Xie Hua, what’s the meaning of this? You brought people to search the property and even want to touch Ye Yuan. Are you slapping this prince’s face?”

Xie Hua said with a fake smile, “Your Highness’ words are not right. This Xue is in charge of Eastward Country’s alchemy world affairs, isn’t the Tang Family under jurisdiction? They spread rumors, throwing the imperial regime into chaos. Shouldn’t their property be searched and confiscated?”

Second Prince smiled coldly and said, “Xie Hua, this prince has never offended you! There’s likely the shadow of that big brother of mine behind this matter, right? Searching and confiscating the Tang Family,?heh heh,?this is setting an example for this prince to see!”

Xie Hua said coolly, “Your Highness is thinking too much! Do you think that Eldest Prince can influence Master’s decision?”

When Second Prince heard that, his expression could not help changing.

Xie Hua’s words were tantamount to blocking off all of the retreat routes.

There was only one person who could influence Lin Lan’s decision in this Eastward Country, that was the emperor himself!

At this time, Lu Yun who was by the side suddenly spoke up. He said, “Xie Hua, give this old man face, how about it?”

Xie Hua’s expression changed. He could choose not to give Second Prince face, but Lu Yun was a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse. His status was second only to Master in Eastward Country.

His face was huge!

After a moment of silence, Xie Hua said, “Master Yun has a lofty status and can originally stay out of this matter. Must you get involved in the battle for the throne?”

Lu Yun smiled faintly and said, “Didn’t Lin Lan get involved in it too?”

Xie Hua’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “This matter, this Xie is judging by facts and not the individual! Master Yun’s words are rather biased!”

Lu Yun said coolly, “Since that’s the case, Ye Yuan and the Tang Family’s matter, I, Lu, am intervening! What are you going to do about it?”

Xie Hua’s expression changed immediately feeling great pressure.

Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum was an existence that suppressed a region in Eastward Country.

Before coming, he also never thought that Lu Yun would actually intervene.

“Huhu,?Younger Brother Lu’s status is revered. Why is there a need to interfere in the matters of juniors? Why not give this old man face and withdraw?”

Just as Xie Hua was in a dilemma, another voice sounded out!
