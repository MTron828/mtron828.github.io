Chapter 2695: Beyond the Sea!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

” Roughly 15 thousand feet, that should be his limit!” Black Flood Dragon King looked at Ye Yuan and said with certainty.

Because he saw that Ye Yuan was currently already extremely strained.

He practically could not advance anymore.

This place was his bottleneck!

Indeed, the sword intent at 15 thousand feet already reached Ye Yuan’s limit.

But the current Ye Yuan was oblivious.

The wounds on his body gradually increased, but it was as if he could not feel it.

The current Ye Yuan was extremely excited.

Dismantling moves on sight, it was like he was currently fighting with Zhuo Bufan.

Resolving the other party’s sword intent already became his joy. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even he also did not realize that he had already entered a state of sudden enlightenment.

In this one year plus, although Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, his Sword Dao rule did not break through.

The further behind, the more difficult it was to comprehend the power of rules.

Often, when it reached the late-stage, the comprehension of rules would severely lag behind cultivation realm.

At that time, one’s potential would also be depleted.

Even wanting to break through cultivation realm a little was immensely difficult.

But currently, his Sword Dao rule already seemed ready to come out at his call, and was about to reach the third level right away!

Under the outside world’s strong pressure, Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao rule became increasingly mellow.

Boom!

Suddenly, his Sword Dao rule seemed to be floodwaters that broke the dam, suddenly gushing out.

Sword Dao rule, third level!

However, the Sword Dao rule that Ye Yuan comprehended was different from Zhuo Bufan’s Sword Dao rule.

Sword was a Great Dao, all-encompassing!

Zhuo Bufan’s sword was unparalleled and domineering. What it pursued was the extreme of strength.

His sword was pure to the extreme.

It was a kind of sword that forsaken everything, pressing forward in every endeavor.

If gods blocked, kill gods! Buddha blocks, kill Buddha!

But what Ye Yuan comprehended was the profound meaning of the universe!

Deriving heaven and earth with the sword.

One sword, one world!

Zhuo Bufan’s sword seemed fearsome, but it had drawbacks too.

Once he encountered a truly powerful individual, his extreme strength would easily suffer a crushing defeat.

This was the so-called easy to break if overly tough.

While Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao rule might not be so strong in terms of strength, but it won in being continuous without ceasing.

It was hard to say which was stronger and which was weaker.

Ingenuity in varying tactics depends on mother wit.

Just like currently, the moment Ye Yuan’s opening burst, it became unstoppable.

The sword energy at 15 thousand feet was completely unable to stop him anymore!

Swoosh!

His figure moved again, speeding toward between the two islands.

When Black Flood Dragon King saw this scene, he was dumbfounded with shock.

“This guy actually comprehended it!”

“This boy has such a shocking comprehension ability! What a powerful will!”

Virtually at the same time, Black Flood Dragon King and Mi Tian exclaimed with admiration.

Gaining enlightenment on Dao at the moment between life and death, it was easy to talk about, but doing it was as hard as ascending to heaven.

Since it was between life and death, a single misstep and it would be the outcome of perishing and Dao dissipating.

Furthermore, those who were able to return from that sort of extreme state were in the minority!

This kind of breakthrough method was okay once in a while. But, too many attempts and it would definitely be the outcome of death.

But to Ye Yuan, it was already pretty much run of the mill.

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan’s speed soared, entering ten thousand feet very quickly!

Ten thousand feet, this was already the limit for Jade Sovereign Heavens.

Even a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven like Black Flood Dragon King could at most just advance another 3000 feet too.

Ye Yuan’s step was already a result that set the world on fire.

But Ye Yuan’s footsteps did not stop.

He was still advancing!

9000 feet!

8000 feet!

… …

5000 feet!

3000 feet!

1000 feet!

Although the speed got slower and slower, Ye Yuan still rushed to the 1000 feet place in the end.

Black Flood Dragon King opened his mouth wide, having disbelief written all over his face.

Just what kind of terrifying realm had this guy’s Sword Dao rule reached?!

Ye Yuan’s skin was long already flayed open and his flesh torn, fresh blood dripping.

But he did not care at all!

He continued to move towards the fissure step by step.

The piercing cold sword energy was almost pulverizing him.

But he stubbornly held on.

800 feet!

700 feet!

… …

100 feet!

90 feet!

… …

10 feet!

“Pffft!”

Ye Yuan spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, almost fainting away.

He was already standing at the entrance of the crack. But, the sword energy inside was too terrifying!

One step away, but akin to heaven and earth!

Ye Yuan believed that if he dared to take another step forward, he would surely be sliced into minced meat by the countless sword energy!

“Boy, you’re already very strong! There’s a gap of two major cultivation realms between you!” Mi Tian said.

“Mn,?I know!” Ye Yuan nodded and said.

“You can’t advance anymore. If you go further, I can’t save you too! The brat who left behind this sword scar is too strong!” Mi Tian said.

“Mn,?I know!” Ye Yuan nodded his head again and said very calmly.

Only when he saw Ye Yuan had the intention to retreat did Mi Tian set his mind at ease.

However, the astonishment in his heart was hard to describe with words.

That Saint Sovereign Heaven who left behind the sword scar absolutely had a stunning aptitude!

But this young man in front of him was not the slightest bit worse!

It was just that, these were two geniuses of two eras, but they exchanged blows here in such a manner.

Even he was unable to judge who was stronger and who was weaker too.

However, he did not feel that Ye Yuan lost.

On the contrary, Ye Yuan brought him too many pleasant surprises today.

Right then, Ye Yuan’s figure retreated explosively.

Very soon, he returned to the Black Flood Dragon King’s side. Swallowing a heavenly pill, he said coolly, “Do you feel that he can reach the other side of the sea?”

Black Flood Dragon King was taken back and shook his head and said, “He’s very strong, but the seven great sea regions are just a small plot of land! There are still countless super powerhouses ahead! There are even existences stronger than Saint Sovereign Heaven! It’s impossible for him to reach the other side of the sea!”

“No, he definitely can!” The moment Black Flood Dragon King’s voice fell, Ye Yuan immediately retorted.

Black Flood Dragon King snickered and said, “You’re not a seafolk. You don’t know the terrors ahead! No matter how stronger you humans are, it’s also impossible to cross the ocean and reach the other shore!”

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “Others can’t, but he definitely can! Of course, I definitely can as well! Perhaps, we’ll be able to meet in the future! This guy left an awful mess behind for me. When I see him in the future, I’ll definitely seek an explanation from him!”

Black Flood Dragon King had a dumbfounded face, not knowing where this guy’s confidence came from.

Saint Sovereign Heavens were indeed the kings of the sea. But the sea was too vast. Existences stronger than Saint Sovereign Heavens still existed!

This inexplicable confidence was really damnable!

However, he also discerned that Ye Yuan also wanted to tread on the wave and leave in the future and reach the other shore.

“Huhu,?go on! You go! Best that you die in the sea!” Black Flood Dragon King said with a cold smile.

He would never hide his hatred in front of Ye Yuan.

He knew that hiding it was useless too.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a smile, “I’ll definitely go! But I have a premonition that Jingfei that lass will leave in the future too! The seven great sea regions are too small and can’t trap her here!”

Ye Yuan had long discovered that Jingfei’s talent flung the seven great sea regions’ people off by too much!

Before encountering him, Mi Tian was already planning on designating Jingfei to take him home.

It was just that his sudden appearance made Mi Tian change his mind.

It could be seen from this that Jingfei’s worst result in the future would also be reaching the realm of a true dragon!
