Chapter 2431: Who Told You That I Have to Transcend the Deva Blight Tribulation?

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

... ...

Above the void, came a series of rumbling sounds.

The powerful force fought until space trembled in waves.

Although Daymeld’s cultivation realm fell, his strength was placed there.

Coupled with two Heavenly Dao True Martials, his strength skyrocketed, and he was locked in a struggle with Ye Yuan.

Under the meeting of karmic fate, the human and divine, two great camps’ chief commanders, finally clashed together.

Daymeld activated Heavenly Dao True Martial, a pair of iron fists akin to two drumsticks, pounding the horizon until it rent the air.

Ye Yuan’s Sword of Spacetime could cut everything in the world.

But it could not cut Daymeld’s pair of iron fists.

Daymeld was deserving of being a progenitor class figure. Even if his realm fell, he was also not what anyone could bully.

In fact, he even overpowered Ye Yuan in terms of strength.

The cooperation of two great Heavenly Dao True Martials was truly formidable to the extreme.

“Brat, you’re really very strong! Although this progenitor’s realm fell, ordinary Deva Second Blights are absolutely not my match too. But you can actually fight to a draw with me! You can be sufficiently proud. If you went into closed-seclusion and cultivated, transcending the Deva blight tribulation, you’ll definitely be able to beat me! It’s a pity, you’re too stupid! Hahaha ...” Daymeld said with a big laugh.

He could feel that Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm already showed signs of breaking through the soil under his powerful pressure.

Becoming stronger in battle, only Ye Yuan this sort of peerless genius could do it.

Except, the current breakthrough was a life-and-death great tribulation to Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan himself also had this feeling that his cultivation realm was already almost breaking through uncontrollably.

In this one year, Ye Yuan had been continuously searching for himself in the midst of battle, perfecting the next realm of the Chaos Heavenspan Canon.

At present, it was already time for the melon to fall off its stem when it was ripe.

Daymeld’s powerful offensive made Ye Yuan’s World Realm become more and more complete.

Boom!

Finally, the cultivation realm could no longer be stopped. Endless spiritual energy surged over here frenziedly.

The breakthrough started!

Unpredictable army, everyone’s expressions changed wildly.

They did not expect that Ye Yuan actually broke through so quickly.

“Not good! His Excellency broke through so quickly! This ... What to do about this?” Wan Zhen exclaimed.

Pang Zhen gritted his teeth and said, “This guy, he wouldn’t listen no matter how we persuaded! Damn it, transcending the tribulation at the last moment, what difference is there from seeking death? Everyone, listen to the command! Ignore the others! Pledge to protect His Excellency to the death!”

Under his word of command, the army of several tens of thousands flew over to Ye Yuan that side crazily like locusts.

“No need to care about me. Do your own things properly!” Ye Yuan’s low voice came over.

The faces of Wan Zhen and the rest changed wildly and they said, “Your Excellency!”

“What? My words aren’t useful anymore?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

With him frowning, he radiated awe without being angry.

At present, he was the supreme authority in the unpredictable army.

A word carrying the weight of nine tripods!

“Sigh!” Wan Zhen and Pang Zhen let out long sighs, and could only charge towards the enemy army again.

When Daymeld saw this scene, he let out a burst of even louder laughter and said, “Kid, your talent is really too terrifying! Your improvement can really be seen even using the naked eye. However, it ends here! Hahaha ...”

Ye Yuan breaking through, the commotion was seriously too big.

Just the gathering of heaven and earth spiritual energy needed to take a lot of time.

This place was the land of Western Realms, the spiritual energy was not rich.

But Ye Yuan’s breakthrough already came into contact with Heavenly Dao. Not accumulating enough spiritual energy, he would not give up.

Ye Yuan carried the berserk spiritual energy and was locked in battle with Daymeld.

Originally, Daymeld could still overpower him.

Now, Ye Yuan coming into contact with Heavenly Dao, he was already evenly matched with Daymeld.

Furthermore, he got stronger the more he fought!

Rumble!

Ye Yuan’s small world also had a huge commotion at this time. Black and yellow two energies became more and more refined.

Although Ye Yuan’s current realm was World Realm, it did not form a true world.

Accurately speaking, his world was actually just dividing chaos into two.

Chaos was still chaos.

But, after Ye Yuan’s so many years of cultivation, these two regions of chaos gradually became pure, having their own color. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Heaven was black energy, and earth was yellow energy.

At this time, the black energy became more and more blue, while the yellow energy became more and more turbid.

Heaven and earth became more and more distinct from each other!

This was the real heaven and earth.

Of course, this process evolved very slowly.

At the outside world, Ye Yuan’s battle with Daymeld also became increasingly fiercer.

Daymeld was originally still laughing loudly without ceasing. But the more he fought, the more alarmed he got, and the more puzzled he became.

Logically speaking, the Deva blight tribulation should have started long ago. But why did Ye Yuan seem to not have any happenings at all?

Deva blight tribulation was the tribulation of Heavenly Dao; terrifying to the extreme.

When the blight tribulation erupted, the physical body of the martial artist would decay crazily. At the same time, it would even be accompanied by lightning tribulation, fire tribulation, tribulation of mental demon, so on and so forth. The current situation was complicated to the extreme.

It could be said that this was a one-time eruption.

The goal was to kill you!

Of course, there was also powerful Heavenly Dao power mixed in this. As long as the martial artist pulled through, they would be like carps leaping over the dragon gate, their strength scaling new heights.

However, apart from drawing incomparably colossal spiritual energy over at Ye Yuan there, there was not the slightest sign of crossing the tribulation.

As steady as Mount Tai!

Not only did Ye Yuan’s current body not decay, but it also became stronger and stronger instead.

This was also too weird!

The battle over here naturally affected the hearts of the unpredictable army.

Wan Zhen and the rest also waited for a long time. In the end, they discovered that Ye Yuan did not have any happenings at all, and could not help feeling very strange.

“Odd, it’s been close to two hours since His Excellency started breaking through. Why doesn’t there seem to be any signs of decay at all?” Wan Zhen said.

Pang Zhen also had a strange expression as he said, “Decay? Didn’t you notice? His Excellency’s aura is currently soaring crazily, it doesn’t feel like he’s transcending the Deva blight tribulation, but experiencing Deva strengthening!”

They had both already experienced the Deva blight tribulation and were deeply aware of the horror of the blight tribulation.

Once they crossed the tribulation, the martial artist would directly enter a period of weakness, unable to face the enemy at all.

But Ye Yuan seemed to have been strengthened by Heavenly Dao, his aura becoming increasingly terrifying.

This kind of Deva blight tribulation, it was still their first time seeing.

Daymeld’s expression became uglier and uglier, and he said with a furious roar, “Why hasn’t your Deva blight tribulation started yet? With your strength, the Deva blight tribulation should be very terrifying!”

Ye Yuan looked at Daymeld pitiably and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Who told you that I need to transcend the Deva blight tribulation?”

Daymeld’s expression changed wildly and he said, “This is impossible! Each human has to transcend the tribulation. You also cultivate the small world. So how can you possibly not transcend the tribulation?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Kicking up a fuss over nothing! Don’t your divine race not need to transcend the tribulation?”

The divine race only cultivated Heavenly Dao, strengthening themselves with Heavenly Dao, and did not need to cross the tribulation.

Apart from this, all races had to transcend the Deva blight tribulation!

And this was also one of their capital to stand above myriad races.

But Ye Yuan clearly cultivated the small world but did not need to cross the tribulation. This sort of thing was too fantastical.

Daymeld could not help being shocked.

There were really too many uncertainties on this young human!

He used common sense to gauge Ye Yuan, thinking that Ye Yuan would cross the Deva blight tribulation and die.

But he forgot. Ye Yuan this person could not be gauged using common sense at all!
