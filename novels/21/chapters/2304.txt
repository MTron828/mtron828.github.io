Chapter 2308: Reversal!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hahaha, is this your strength, Second Sage? Truly disappoints me too much! See, everything depends on strength. Your Dao is inferior to my Dao.”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook laughed wildly. In this contest, he already established the winner.

This was a showdown of Dao. His Dao already completely crushed Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan absolutely had no possibilities of turning the tables.

On the viewing platform, the ancestors had sympathetic looks on their faces.

“This kid’s myth is finally coming to an end,” Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian let out a sigh of relief and said.

Ye Yuan’s road to the peak was seriously too miraculous.

Not that they could not accept geniuses, but Ye Yuan’s genius was a little too frightening.

Less than 3000 years old achieving Dao pill realm, this simply subverted everyone’s understanding.

Even those sons of Heavenly Emperors, existences who had powerful strength the moment they were born, were also not worth mentioning in front of Ye Yuan.

Before this, they all felt that Ye Yuan was merely a junior, not worth mentioning at all.

But Ye Yuan challenged Cloud Summer Mountain, going all the way to the top from the foot of the mountain. Even the powerful Yun Windborne was defeated at his hands, making everyone’s jaws hit the ground.

In the end, he even forced Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove to back down.

Only then did everyone know that turns out he was already an ancestor-level powerhouse.

Now that Ye Yuan was about to lose, everyone let out a long sigh in relief.

His myth was finally coming to an end.

Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove smiled and said, “If Ye Yuan defeated even Heavenly Emperor Dao Ancestor, Medicine Ancestor probably can’t sit still anymore as well.”

“However, this kid can perform to this extent. It’s already shocking enough! Fortunately, this old man knew that you, this old fellow, are cautious and didn’t take action back then. Otherwise, it will really be embarrassing,” Ancestor Yi Xian said1.

“A good show is about to come to an end. I wonder if this boy can withstand this kind of blow or not,” Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove said.

“This is hard to say. After all, a genius like him has probably never experienced failure before, rising rapidly all the way up to a high position! As the saying went: the higher you stand, the harder you fall. I’m afraid that it’s very hard for him to withstand this blow,” Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian said.

The group of ancestors nodded one after another, deeply feeling that way too.

While at this time, Ye Yuan and Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s alchemy battle already reached a white-hot stage too.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook eroded Ye Yuan’s territory bit by bit, squeezing him to the limit.

“Hahaha, brat, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Where did that spirit just now go?”

“Didn’t you talk until it was well-grounded and reasoned just now? What about now?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“This is your so-called Dao? What a joke, it’s too weak.”

Crushing a genius like Ye Yuan seemed to be a very delightful thing, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook was smug to the extreme.

But the Ye Yuan opposite seemed to be cowed by Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s imposing aura and did not say a word at all. It was as if he had already resigned himself to fate.

“Condense for me!”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook suddenly yelled out, drawing a successful conclusion to the alchemy battle this time.

An egg-shaped medicinal pill condensed in the air.

And the medicinal pill of this shape also showed that Heavenly Emperor Distantbook was the victor of this alchemy battle.

“Huhu, finally still lost,” Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian said with a meaningful smile.

“A myth has finally been ended!”

“It’s a shame, actually. I was rather looking forward to Second Sage winning.”

... ...

All of a sudden, everyone felt disappointed.

Regarding the record of Ye Yuan this myth, everyone’s feelings were actually very complicated.

On one hand, everyone hoped for Ye Yuan to continuously create legends. On the other hand, everyone was also scared that he was too formidable.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook looked at Ye Yuan and said smugly, “Why? Nothing to say, my Second Sage? Wasn’t your tongue very sharp previously? Didn’t you say that this emperor’s Dao isn’t worth mentioning? Now, why don’t you speak!”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook was unrelenting after gaining momentum, pressing on Ye Yuan with every step.

Cloudheart Realm’s alchemy powerhouses were greatly excited, mocking Ye Yuan to the best of their ability.

“A guy who overestimates his own abilities, does he really take himself to be some major power? In front of our Cloudheart Realm, even Sacred Ancestor High Priest is nothing, let alone whatever dog fart Second Sage.”

“When Lord Distantbook roamed the Heavenspan World unhindered, your grandfather’s grandfather’s grandfather wasn’t even born yet!”

“Hahaha ... brat, don’t be so arrogant as a person! Careful that you slap your own face!”

... ...

Cloudheart Realm’s alchemy powerhouses all viewed themselves as self-important and already reached the level of blind confidence.

No matter what you were like, in short, they were number one under the heavens!

From the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference started until now, Ye Yuan had been basking in the limelight. They were long already upset.

Now, they finally nabbed the chance.

In the crowd, Zou Rui smiled disdainfully and said, “What dog fart Second Sage? Compared to Grandmaster, you’re still far away! Also, you guys, following this dog fart Second Sage, do you really think that you’re remarkable? Today, I’ll let you take a look at what’s called powerful!”

Beside him stood Yun Yi and Ning Siyu.

Yun Yi looked at Zou Rui strangely and turned to Ning Siyu and said, “What do you think?”

Ning Siyu frowned and said, “I feel that ... it isn’t over yet!”

Yun Yi nodded and said, “I think so too.”

“Hahaha ... truly ridiculous! The outcome is already decided, could it be that he can still overturn the heavens?” Zou Rui said with a big laugh.

Yun Yi and Ning Siyu talked among themselves and did not have the intention of caring about him at all.

Zou Rui glared hard, almost angered until he vomited blood.

“Hahaha ...”

Above the void, Ye Yuan suddenly burst into laughter.

Everyone was stunned, instinctively thinking that Ye Yuan could not bear the blow of failure and went mad.

Many people shook their heads and sighed, thinking that this genius was crippled.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook could not help laughing as he said, “I even thought that Second Sage was some remarkable figure. I didn’t expect that he was so weak that he crumbled with a single blow.”

“Distantbook(Yao Shu), you were really given a good name!” Ye Yuan said with a loud laugh.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s brows furrowed and he said, “What do you mean?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Distantbook(Yao Shu), going to lose(Yao Shu), this name of yours is really given beautifully!”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook was taken aback, only then, aware that Ye Yuan was making fun of his name.

However, he really did not think in this aspect before.

Because he never lost before.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook frowned and said, “If you lost, then you lost. Want to regain some dignity using this kind of method? What a joke! Like this will only show your cowardice even more!”

Ye Yuan held back his laughter and said with a sneer, “Look at how smug you are. Do you really take it as if you’ve won?”

But Heavenly Emperor Distantbook was indifferent and said disdainfully, “Even a blind man can also tell that this emperor won this alchemy battle, right? Why? Could it be that you can still distort facts?”

Many ancestors shook their heads one after another, feeling that Ye Yuan was too much of a sore loser.

The outcome was already a foregone conclusion, why made an exhibition of himself?

But right at this time, Ye Yuan slowly extended a finger and said coolly, “Then this Ye will let you take a look at whose Dao is the truth!”

Done talking, he pointed at the void, a Tai Chi diagram whizzed into that ‘egg’ with a whoosh!

Crack, crack, crack ...

That egg immediately gave off popping sounds like fried beans!

Then, the egg gradually became rounded. The aura of Great Dao descended once again!
