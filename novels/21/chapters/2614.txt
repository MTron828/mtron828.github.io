Chapter 2620: Pill Pavilion!

The pill refinement was in progress.

After experiencing the initial choppiness, Ye Yuan’s condition got better and better.

In terms of essence, there was not much difference between grade two heavenly pills and grade one heavenly pills.

It was merely going from simple to complex.

Of course, there were not many who could understand this point.

Not that they did not want to, but that they could not.

But without a doubt, Feng Jing’s foundation skills were extremely solid.

Even if he did not comprehend the essence of pill refinement, based on the strength of a grade three heavenly alchemist, it was still very easy to refine a grade two heavenly pill.

But Ye Yuan’s strength was not the least bit inferior to him!

It was very hard for people to imagine. A guy whose affinity was only ten points; how could he bring to people such a dazzling refinement.

The refinement ended. Feng Jing thought that he could draw a round of applause.

However, he did not.

Feeling everyone’s somewhat strange gazes, he could not help looking toward Ye Yuan rather surprisedly.

He discovered that Ye Yuan was currently calm and relaxed.

Could it be that this boy’s refinement was very impressive? Shouldn’t be!?Feng Jing thought in his heart.

“Open the furnace!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Feng Jing could not help laughing as he said, “Really in a hurry to go and reincarnate! Forget it, I’ll make you give up!”

The refinement this time, his condition was unprecedentedly good!

He even wondered whether he could break through the shackles or not, and reach that legendary realm of ninth grade golden pill!

Therefore, he did not feel that the Ye Yuan who was refining for the first time could match up to him.

The moment the medicine cauldron opened, a dark-red medicinal pill flew into the container.

People craned their necks one after another, wanting to see the quality of the heavenly pill.

“You all, look! There’s actually a hint of golden color on this Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill!”

“Almost! Almost and it would have advanced to the legendary realm of ninth grade!”

“Master Feng is Master Feng, under the heavy pressure, he broke through the shackles instead!”

… …

The surrounding crowd immediately started boiling over.

A hint of a smile appeared on Feng Jing’s face. This was the effect that he wanted!

Not that he hungered for fame and reputation, but that he felt that people should flatter him in the first place.

But what he wanted was this kind of heartfelt admiration!

This was his glory and also the Pill Alliance’s glory!

Feng Jing looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Did you see it, this hint of golden color? There’s already no need to test the grade of the heavenly pill, right?”

A touch of gold in the dark-red, it indicated that the heavenly pill already reached the peak of eighth grade and was also not far away from ninth grade anymore.

Of course, this narrow step was not easy to take.

Ninth grade, that was a legendary realm, it was not something that could be entered as you wished.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No need, quasi-ninth grade.”

Feng Jing could not help laughing as he said, “Looks like you’re not worried at all!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What do I have to worry about? It’s merely quasi-ninth grade.”

Feng Jing seemed to have heard the funniest joke and said, “Merely! Quasi-ninth grade!?Heh,?what high-sounding sentiments! You probably completely don’t know what ninth grade means, right?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “To me, those lower than ninth grade are all trash! If it doesn’t enter ninth grade when refining pills, still refine pills for what? Did your Pill Alliance groom only trash like you? Clearly didn’t reach ninth-grade, but you’re proud of it,?huhu.”

“Hiss …”

These words were domineering!

One sentence degraded the Pill Alliance to nothing.

Everyone was stunned by Ye Yuan’s words.

Although your refinement was very impressive too, these words were too much, right?

Posturing had to have a limit too!

Sure enough, Feng Jing laughed loudly when he heard that and said,?“Hahaha?… Boy, I’m somewhat doubtful now, whether you know how to refine pills or not! Ninth grade, that’s a legendary grade. When it comes out of your mouth, it becomes the lowest threshold? Alright. Stop talking big. I really want to see your ninth grade golden pill!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “As you wish”

It was only to see him flip his palm over. A Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill flew out.

A dazzling golden light shone until everyone could not open their eyes.

Ninth grade golden pill!

The crowd instantly exploded!

This guy really refined a ninth grade golden pill!

Feng Jing was still harboring the mentality of watching a good show a second ago. But in the next instant, his entire person was stupefied there.

Ye Yuan looked at Feng Jing and said coolly, “My Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill doesn’t need to be tested anymore either, right??Uh?… You’re indeed much stronger than Qin Shun that fellow. I was still counting on you to give me a bit of surprise. But I didn’t expect that you haven’t even entered ninth grade yet, and you were already patting yourself on the back. That’s also all there is to you then.”

Feng Jing looked at Ye Yuan with a shocked face and muttered, “This … How is this possible? Isn’t it your first time refining? Y-You’re actually able to refine a ninth grade Greenfeather Point Star Heavenly Pill! You tricked me!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Tricked you? Do you feel that I have a need to trick you? This is my first time refining. Of course, it’s also the most rubbish refinement. If you’re not convinced, let’s compete again. I dare guarantee that you’ll be beaten down very hard!”

Feng Jing gritted his teeth and said, “Compete then! I don’t believe that you can really hit the jackpot and be so lucky every time!”

He was unresigned!

As a Pill Alliance’s powerhouse, how could he possibly lose to the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s trash?

He could not lose and could not afford to lose as well!

He came to challenge the dojo, if he were to lose, where would the Pill Alliance’s face go?

Ye Yuan shrugged and said with a smile, “Then don’t waste time anymore, begin then.”

He was deliberately triggering Feng Jing, making him do it again.

Slapping face had to be slapped thoroughly!

One time could still say that it was by chance.

But the second time, you would have nothing to say, right?

The second refinement, Ye Yuan was even more accomplished with high proficiency.

The choppiness from before had long already disappeared.

On the other hand, Feng Jing’s mentality had already been affected after his first miserable defeat.

The second refinement ended. The quality of Feng Jing’s heavenly pill was only lower eighth grade.

However, the moment Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill came out of the furnace, the light radiated even stronger.

After testing it, Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill reached upper ninth grade!

One was improving, the other was regressing.

Whoever was stronger and weaker was clear at a glance!

With this, the powerhouses of Fire Peace Great Nation were completely shocked.

An unknown Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum actually completely defeated the Pill Alliance powerhouse Feng Jing who had already become famous for a long time. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This conclusion was what everyone could not have imagined previously.

Ye Yuan looked at the downcast Feng Jing and said coolly, “You don’t need to feel pessimistic either. Because very soon, the nine great nations’ Pill Alliance strongholds will be trampled underfoot by me! Doesn’t your Pill Alliance like to trample on people? Then I’ll also make you all savor the taste of being trampled!”

Luo Yunqing felt refreshed!

During these 20 years, they had had enough of the cowardly spirit!

Today, they finally regained face!

Ye Yuan raised his head and swept across everyone’s faces and said coolly, “Our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect has already established the Pill Pavilion. Friends who have aspirations in Alchemy Dao can all join the Pill Pavilion! We recruit disciples regardless of faction or talent! Furthermore, we won’t force you to join the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! If you feel that you have gotten somewhere with what you learned, you can return to your original faction any time! From now on, our Pill Pavilion’s aim will be to break the Pill Alliance’s monopoly, and let everyone be able to learn alchemy!”

Ye Yuan’s words echoed loudly, evoking a huge response in the crowd.

The Pill Alliance’s monopoly on Alchemy Dao not only held back the Five Light Heavenly Region’s five great heavenly sects, but it also greatly impeded the other four great heavenly regions’ various major sects.

But Ye Yuan’s action was tantamount to reducing the Pill Alliance’s advantage until nothing was left!

It was just that, would the Pill Alliance take things lying down?
