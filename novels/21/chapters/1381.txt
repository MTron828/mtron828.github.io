1385 Three Years Arranged Battle!

“Sword Tomb second level, one month. I’ll have to trouble Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao.”

Ye Yuan came to the lobby outside the Sword Tomb and handed Zhao Qin his academy token.

Zhao Qin looked at Ye Yuan, his gaze filled with a complicated look.

“Sword Tomb second level, 40 points have to be deducted each time,” Zhao Qin said.

“Mn, I know. I’ll have to trouble Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao,” Ye Yuan said courteously.

Zhao Qin nodded his head and helped Ye Yuan deduct the points.

Ye Yuan received the token and directly entered the Sword Tomb.

“Heh, Zhao Qin, what’s with your expression? Who’s that kid?”

At this time, an inner-court disciple entered the lobby. Seeing the strange expression on Zhao Qin’s face, he could not resist asking.

Zhao Qin did a shush hand gesture and lowered his voice to say, “Hush, Ma Zhi, be softer! You don’t even recognize him? Are you really someone from our Wu Meng Academy?”

Ma Chi smiled and said, “A middle-stage Grotto Profound rookie, I know him for what?”

Zhao Qin said with a disdainful look, “I ask you, who’s the most talked about person in the academy these few days?”

Ma Zhi was stunned, his face immediately revealing a shocked look as he lowered his voice and said, “You’re saying that ... he’s Ye Yuan?”

Zhao Qin said, “Otherwise, who else can he be? Heard that the verdict on Commander Zhao that side already came down, judging Ye Yuan as not guilty! He killed the Qin Family’s direct lineage descendant without even batting an eyelid. Furthermore, he can even enter the Sword Tomb perfectly safe and sound to comprehend the sword now. So what expression ... do you think I should show?”

Ma Zhi drew a cold breath and said, “It’s a pity. I was in closed-seclusion that day and didn’t feast my eyes on it! Qin Peiyu that little fiend, nobody could control her in the entire Wu Meng Capital City. She also never dreamed that she bumped into a great fiend’s hands this time!”

That day, Zhao Qin was present too.

He originally just went to join in the fun and take a look at how Little Fatty would be abused.

But he did not expect that Ye Yuan charged out halfway, directly killing Qin Peiyu.

At that time, his entire person was dumbfounded. He even thought that he saw things wrongly.

Hearing Ma Zhi mentioned it, Zhao Qin still had lingering fear currently and said, “You aren’t aware, but at that time, he just pointed and Qin Peiyu kicked the bucket. He didn’t even bat an eyelid, just like killing a chicken! At that time, I even thought that this guy’s head was spoiled. But then, I didn’t expect that it actually startled Tower Lord Han Tian to personally come forward.”

Ma Zhi smiled and said, “This guy’s guts are really fat! But starting from now, Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian probably won’t let him off, right?’ FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhao Qin chuckled and said, “What the hell do you know! Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian has long clashed with him already. The last time, he said to Ye Yuan’s face that Ye Yuan was already a dead man. In the end, Ye Yuan didn’t die, but his biological sister died!”

Ma Zhi’s face turned stiff, and he said, “There’s still such a thing?”

Zhao Qin said, “Bluff you for what? They were talking here, I was right beside!”

Ma Zhi said, “What capabilities does this boy have, to actually be able to startle Tower Lord Han Tian?”

Zhao Qin said meaningfully, “Heh, the Wu Meng Plaza incident is stirred up too big, resulting in many people in the academy to all not pay attention to another matter! Actually, before that, Ye Yuan still did another earth-shattering major thing!”

Zhao Qin recounted the events of Ye Yuan pulling the sword that day, making Ma Zhi’s eyeballs go wide.

“There ... There’s still such a thing?” Ma Zhi said with a disbelieving look.

Zhao Qin had a smug look and was just about to show off when another person entered the lobby.

“Ye Yuan went in?” Qin Shao asked.

Zhao Qin’s face became stifled, and he said with a nod, “Yes, just went in.”

Qin Shao’s expression turned sullen. Passing the token to Zhao Qin, he said in a solemn voice, “Sword Tomb second level, one month!”

...

When Qin Shao entered the Sword Tomb, he discovered that Ye Yuan already entered the second level.

The second level’s number of people around were clearly more than the first level’s.

But Qin Shao still recognized Ye Yuan with one glance, because he was too conspicuous in the land of sword burials.

Ye Yuan was using that kind of self-mutilating method to cultivate again.

The second level’s difficulty was much greater than the first level.

Qin Shao only used three tries of points to clear the first level, which was also three months.

But the second level, he already trained for almost a year and was still unable to succeed in getting through.

Each level, the deeper one went, the more powerful the sword intent.

Want to succeed in clearing it, there had to be a gradual process in a proper sequence.

Of course, Ye Yuan was completely an exception.

Clearing rounds in the Sword Tomb had nothing to do with strength. It was just looking at concept!

The more profound the comprehension toward Sword Dao laws, the more thorough when clearing the levels.

Of course, if one’s strength was powerful, by relying on powerful strength, one could similarly get through.

With Qin Shao’s strength, if forcefully clearing, clearing the third level was no issue.

But he wanted to comprehend Sword Dao laws, that was why he intentionally slowed down and increased law comprehensions.

This Sword Tomb, each level had countless Sword Dao law fragments. How much one could comprehend depended on their own comprehension ability.

As for Ye Yuan like this, according to strength, it was impossible to get through the first level.

Yet, he passed.

Furthermore, it was clearing with a very bizarre method.

Now, this guy was self-mutilating again.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s method, no one could do it at all.

Once they loosened up somewhat, they would be shredded into pieces by the all-pervasive Sword Dao laws!

Qin Shao’s face fell, and he entered the Sword Tomb.

A month later, when Ye Yuan dragged his injury-laden body and walked out, he discovered that Qin Shao was already waiting for him.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said, “If you’re here to say fierce words to me, don’t waste your breath.”

Qin Shao said, “Qin Peiyu’s crimes deserved death. She isn’t worthy of me saying fierce words.”

Qin Shao’s words made Ye Yuan feel rather surprised, and he said, “She was your younger sister, you’re also a bit too cold-blooded, right?”

Qin Shao said coldly, “In large families, how is there the warm-heartedness you speak of? Since young, she has never regarded me as an elder brother.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered, Qin Shao’s words were said lightly, but there were probably quite a few undisclosed stories behind it!

“Then what are you specifically waiting for me for?” Ye Yuan said curiously.

“I want to carry out a life-and-death battle with you!”

When he said this, Qin Shao’s words carried some agitation.

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, and he said with a cold smile, “You said that her crimes deserve death just now?”

Qin Shao seemed to have long expected Ye Yuan’s attitude and said, “After that day, the family head came to find me. He proposed it, making me arrange a battle with you! Because only this way can kill you!”

Within the academy, they advocated competition. But they forbade students from killing each other in private.

But life-and-death battles were the only avenue to settle things.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heh, it looks like you’re merely a tool in the eyes of the Qin Family’s people! Your talent is so good, you’re willing to be reduced to a tool?”

Qin Shao’s face fell slightly, and he said, “I have no choice! Furthermore ... I long to have a fight with you!”

Qin Shao paused for a bit and said again, “Furthermore, I know that you’ll definitely agree! Because your growth can’t avoid me!”

Ye Yuan gave Qin Shao a glance rather surprisedly and said, “You’re different from the rest of the Qin Family! Fine, I promise you. But ... I’m not your match right now. Give me three year’s time, you and I will have a fight!”
