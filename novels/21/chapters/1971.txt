Chapter 1975: Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A heart-wrenching yell made everyone feel palpitations.

This kind of yelling persisted all the way for close to an hour.

All the way until the end, Hu Fei was already exhausted and could not even make a sound.

“Cured! It’s actually cured! I heard that the poison of a green corpse is completely incurable! But now he’s actually cured!” Song Yu cried out in surprise.

Although Hu Fei already had no strength, the rotting flesh on his body was currently recovering.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill won against the green corpse’s poison.

Everyone looked at this scene with astonished faces, full of disbelief.

In that sort of situation just now, it was obvious that the green corpse’s poison was extremely strong. Even if there was medicine, it would be very difficult to treat too.

But Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill actually forcefully dragged Hu Fei back from the palace of hell.

“Brother Ye is well-deserving of being hailed as a master. Such means is simply inconceivable!” Guo Jingyang exclaimed with admiration.

“This is truly superb medical skills that can revive the dead! Brother Ye’s means, I’ve had a taste of it,” Ma Chang praised sincerely.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I also didn’t know whether this Nourish Clear Pill was useful or not. Under that kind of situation just now, I could only give it a shot.”

When Song Yu heard that, his pupils could not help constricting as he said, “What? Nourish Clear Pill? This ... This is just the Nourish Clear Pill?”

Not just him, everyone was filled with shock.

The Nourish Clear Pill was just the most common rank six detoxification pill. Its refining difficulty was just level one. In terms of medicinal effect, it was unbelievably weak.

They all thought that what Ye Yuan fed Hu Fei was some miracle elixir, but who knew that it was just the most common street-ware, the Nourish Clear Pill!

For the Nourish Clear Pill to be able to have such terrifying medicinal effects, what grade did that have to be?

Purple spirit divine-grade?

Void spirit divine-grade?

As for vast spirit divine-grade, they did not even dare to think about it.

They had never seen before a rank six vast spirit divine pill.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The spirit medicines of Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital’s Myriad Treasure Tower are limited. They don’t even have some precious spirit medicines, so there’s no way to refine some detoxification pills with good effects. I can only use the Nourish Clear Pill to make do with it.”

Ye Yuan did not understand their astonishment. The Nourish Clear Pill was truly too easy for him.

He casually refined and it was peak vast spirit.

Except, Song Yu and the rest exchanged glances, and they were immediately rendered speechless.

This kind of accomplishment was also a little too frightening, right?

Just the Nourish Clear Pill had such terrifying effects; then if let him refine some high-level medicinal pills, how dreadful would it be?

Right at this time, Hu Fei slowly woke up.

“I ... I’m not dead yet?” Hu Fei said somewhat dazedly.

“Hu Fei, you have to thank Brother Ye properly. If not for his medicinal pills, you’d probably already be a pile of white bones now,” Guo Jingyang said.

Hu Fei suddenly recalled Ye Yuan’s yell, making him open his mouth. He hurriedly bowed to Ye Yuan and said, “Many thanks, Brother Ye. This kindness, this Hu will never forget for life. Brother Ye is a true gentleman, repaying ingratitude with kindness, this Hu is ashamed.”

Those who ridiculed Ye Yuan previously, Hu Fei was naturally one of them too.

But now, he was filled with regret.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No need to be courteous. It’s just a matter of lifting a finger. Let’s continue moving forward.”

...

After traveling for more than half a month, they did not encounter any more danger.

Now, even Song Yu did not have any temper toward Ye Yuan too.

As for the others, they had long already regarded Ye Yuan as the backbone.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s figure stopped.

Song Yu raised his brows and asked, “Brother Ye, are there any discoveries?”

They all knew now that Ye Yuan’s visual prowess was much stronger than theirs. He could always discover some things that they could not discover.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said with a smile, “I didn’t expect to actually be able to see the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit in this place!”

“Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit!” Song Yu’s pupils constricted as he cried out in surprise.

“It’s actually the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit. That thing, as long as you swallow one, it will match up to a thousand years of bitter cultivation!” Guo Jingyang said with a look of excitement.

The others were extremely excited. A Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit was sufficient to let them break through one or even two minor realms. How could they not be agitated?

“Brother Ye, how many of this Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit are there?” Song Yu asked rather nervously.

If there was only one, then he would have rejoiced too soon.

This spirit fruit could only be owned by Ye Yuan alone.

This kind of heaven and earth spirit fruit did not enter the ranks. It was even more useful than a hundred medicinal pills. Its value simply could not be measured using divine essence stones.

Two small realms of True God Realm, if really cultivating according to the normal routine, under the circumstances of swallowing a medicinal pill, there was absolutely no chance without a thousand years.

With the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit, it was equivalent to saving a thousand years of bitter cultivation!

Ye Yuan said, “Three! Discuss the matter of distribution later. There’s a black corpse guarding beside the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits! This black corpse isn’t simple, I’ll go and lure it away. Song Yu you bring them to harvest it!”

Song Yu’s face was full of excitement. If there were three, he could definitely get one.

This way, him breaking through to the Fourth Firmament True God Realm would virtually be a sure bet.

“Okay, you be careful!” Song Yu said with a smile.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and slowly headed over there.

The black corpse had clearly discovered Ye Yuan too. But it did not immediately launch an attack. Instead, he used a pair of black hole-like eyes, staring fixedly at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, and he said in surprise, “This black corpse seems to have already given birth to a trace of spiritual wisdom. This is truly inconceivable. Looks like it’s the effect of this Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit.”

He approached the black corpse unhurriedly just like that. The aura on that black corpse’s body grew stronger and stronger; its entire being was accumulating momentum, awaiting release, just like a startled tiger.

Finally, when Ye Yuan walked closer and reached 100 feet in front of him, the black corpse could not endure it anymore, suddenly attacking Ye Yuan.

Bang!

A fierce clash, Ye Yuan and the black corpse each retreated more than ten steps.

Evenly-matched in strength!

But, even if Ye Yuan had the Qinghong Battle Armor protecting, his innards were already in an upheaval state now.

Peak initial-stage rank six!

Ye Yuan was alarmed in his heart, finally knowing this black corpse’s strength.

He previously already felt that this black corpse was not simple. Now, after exchanging blows, it was indeed the case.

The power of one’s fleshy body was the integration of Heavenly Dao laws into the flesh and blood. The naked eye could not perceive it.

Only when using vital energy, erupting with power, could one see through the actual situation.

A peak initial-stage rank six was equivalent to a Third Firmament True God.

It was just that this black corpse’s fleshy body power was clearly much stronger than a Third Firmament True God.

While Ye Yuan had merely just entered the sixth transformation.

By relying on the perfect sixth transformation golden body, Ye Yuan’s strength was comparable to Second Firmament True Gods.

Coupled with the Qinghong Battle Armor, Ye Yuan’s defensive power approached Third Firmament True God.

But matching up with this black corpse, Ye Yuan could not gain the slightest bit of advantage.

However, Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the least bit, directly launching a second round of attacks! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Clashing three punches in a row, Ye Yuan finally could not resist spurting out a mouthful of blood.

When that black corpse saw the situation, he pounced over toward Ye Yuan fiercely.

His intellect was limited in the end, and he was wary of Ye Yuan previously.

Now, discovering that Ye Yuan was not a match, he immediately chased after.

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, turning tail and running!

“Song Yu!”

“Got it!”

Song Yu was long prepared, rushing at the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit like an arrow that left the bow at this time.

The other few people followed closely behind and also pounced toward the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits.

However, just as they were about to touch the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits, an abnormality suddenly occurred!
