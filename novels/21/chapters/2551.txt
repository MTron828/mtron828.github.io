Chapter 2557: Your Father will Kick You to Death!

“Haha,?Master Ye, stop forcing it! The heavenly medicines that you’ve used in your cultivation these few years, we know it like the back of our hands. Forget about the Jasper Regeneration Pill; even if it’s slightly more difficult heavenly pills, you’ve never dabbled in them too. This nation teacher didn’t say things wrongly, right?” Lin Lan said with a sneer.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “You’re right. I’ve studied more than 20 kinds of heavenly pills in these five years. All of them were basic heavenly pills.”

There’s nothing that can’t be publicized!

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of hiding these things in the first place.

It was just that the likes of Eldest Prince and Lin Lan treated it as a big deal.

However, Ye Yuan admitting it very shamelessly made everyone lose confidence.

Was the one point heavenly alchemist who had once shone with boundless radiance finally going to fall here?

Nation Teacher absolutely would not let Ye Yuan off!

Lin Lan sneered and said, “Now that it’s come to this, are you still not going to accept your fate?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Why don’t I give it a try? What if I get lucky and refine it?”

Lin Lan snickered when he heard that and said, “Lucky? There’s never luck in alchemy! Every bit of quality is true ability! For five years, you’ve never even touched the Jasper Regeneration Pill before. You still want to try your luck to refine it? Dream on!”

Ye Yuan still smiled and said, “I’m a lucky guy. Maybe I can really refine it.”

Lin Lan smiled coldly and said, “The medicinal cauldron is already prepared. Just try it! Just the likes of you, if you can refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill, this nation teacher will swallow this medicinal cauldron whole!”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Lord Nation Teacher, this is what you said!”

Lin Lan said calmly, “This nation teacher said it!”

Ye Yuan smiled and came before the medicinal cauldron.

Lin Lan’s preparation work was done solidly.

All of the items for refining the pill were already prepared.

Ye Yuan picked up a stalk of heavenly medicine and played with it while sizing it up.

Xie Hua smiled coldly and said, “Master Ye, haven’t tried your hand at the Jade Moon Orchid, right? With your negligible affinity, can you extract it successfully in one go? Got to be more careful. Don’t ruin it with a careless move, that will be botching it!”

Ye Yuan ignored him and still played with the Jade Moon Orchid.

The Jade Moon Orchid was one of the Jasper Regeneration Pill’s main medicines and also an extremely hard to extract grade one heavenly medicine.

Not refining it well would have an impact on the entire refinement of the heavenly pill.

Many heavenly alchemists could not even complete this step well, there was naturally no talk of refining the Jasper Regeneration Pill.

This playing took 15 minutes time.

Xie Hua became impatient and said with a cold snort, “What? Want to drag the time? Even if you delay until heaven and earth turn old, it’s impossible to refine it too!”

Boom!

Suddenly, a cluster of flames suddenly arose, making Xie Hua jump in fright.

Ye Yuan started!

As soon as he took action, the hearts of Tang Yu and the rest leaped to their throats.

There was only one chance!

Any slip-up was fatal!

But they were unable to imagine how Ye Yuan, who had never touched the Jasper Regeneration Pill before, was going to not make any mistakes at all in the refining process of such a difficult medicinal pill.

If nothing else, just talking about the Jade Moon Orchid this hurdle, it was not easy to clear.

As for the Second Prince upstairs, he was even nervous until he was shaking.

Ye Yuan’s refinement concerned the fate of his future.

Whether the bet he made was useful or not would depend on this time!

If Ye Yuan could replace Lin Lan, he would be able to turn the tables amidst a desperate situation!

Suddenly, Lin Lan’s entire body trembled and he cried out in surprise, “H-His affinity increased! This … How is this possible?”

Not just Lin Lan, many people noticed it too.

Ye Yuan’s affinity seemed to be a little stronger than before.

Although it was not much, it had indeed become stronger!

“Impossible, could it be a misconception? How can affinity improve?”

“Really seeing ghosts! Does this guy never play cards according to the normal routine? One point affinity can’t refine pills, yet, he can! Affinity can’t be improved, but he could too!”

“This guy is simply too heaven-defying, to actually be able to improve even his affinity!”

… …

Cries of exclamations rose and ebbed. People became even more curious about Ye Yuan.

All kinds of miracles happened to him alone, it was seriously too dazzling!

“Master, a method to increase affinity! If you can obtain it, you’ll definitely be able to improve further!” Xie Hua said.

Lin Lan’s gaze also changed from shock to greed.

Clearly, he was moved!

The Jade Moon Orchid was being extracted little by little and did not collapse like everyone imagined.

On the contrary, Ye Yuan’s refinement had virtually no flaws. It was completely not like it was his first time refining.

Xie Hua opened his mouth wide, a look of disbelief all over his face.

“This … How is this possible? H-Hasn’t he never extracted the Jade Moon Orchid before?”

Lin Lan’s expression became very ugly.

Ye Yuan’s extraction could be rated as perfect!

Even he could not do better than Ye Yuan too!

But it was clearly Ye Yuan’s first time!

Why?!

Why was it so perfect!

Could it be that the intel was wrong?

Very soon, Ye Yuan finished the extraction of the Jade Moon Orchid.

He picked up the second stalk of heavenly medicine, Mountain Root Fuyu, and started examining it carefully.

This time, no one talked badly about him anymore.

Everyone watched quietly, waiting for Ye Yuan’s performance.

The extraction difficulty of the Mountain Root Fuyu was even greater than the Jade Moon Orchid!

Ye Yuan studied it for a full 30 minutes before making a move to extract it.

Smooth as always!

Each heavenly medicine afterward, Ye Yuan would look at it for some time.

Some were long, some were short.

But the extraction process was smooth. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Those people watching a joke were utterly dumbfounded!

Pah!

Xie Hua flung a slap onto Xiao Qi’s face, directly slapping her until she flew into the air.

The current Xie Hua was enraged to the extreme. He pointed at Xiao Qi’s nose and cursed, “Damn thing, you dare lie to Your Father! Didn’t you say that he has never come into contact with the Jasper Regeneration Pill’s heavenly medicines before in these five years?”

Xiao Qi was slapped until her face swelled up, tears and snort running heavily.

She said aggrievedly, “How can this lowly one dare lie to you? H-He really never came into contact with it before!”

Bang!

Xie Hua kicked a foot fiercely onto Xiao Qi’s chest and he roared angrily, “Never?! Never?! Can he refine until like this if he had never done so? Your Father will kick you to death!”

One kick after another, Xiao Qi was kicked until her eyes rolled back, fresh blood flowing constantly out of her mouth, looking like she was going to kick the bucket.

But Xie Hua was still furious.

“Damn thing, lied to all of us! Come, men! Drag her away for me!” Xie Hua said angrily.

When Tang Yu and the rest saw this scene, there was no sympathy in their eyes at all.

The Tang Family treated Xiao Qi well, but this girl actually betrayed the Tang Family.

Death couldn’t expiate her sins

However, they all knew that Xiao Qi did not lie!

Xiao Qi died very unjustly!

In these five years, Ye Yuan had never touched these heavenly medicines before!

The heavenly medicines that the Tang Family prepared for the Jasper Regeneration Pill were still currently lying in the medicine storehouse perfectly well, and had never been touched before!

They also hoped that Ye Yuan would transfer these heavenly medicines over. But they waited and waited, but it did not happen!

Therefore, they were very certain that today was Ye Yuan’s first time refining these heavenly medicines!

However, it was also precisely due to this that the shock in their hearts could not be any greater!

During the past five years, he never touched these heavenly medicines before, but today he could extract them perfectly.

How on earth did this guy do it?
