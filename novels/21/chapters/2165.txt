Chapter 2169: Cannot Bear to Look Straight

“Why is it like this? Even if it’s the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand, it’s also impossible to be this strong, right? Just what profound mystery is there involved?”

Long Tianyu looked at the Ye Yuan on the light screen, befuddlement written all over his eyes.

It was true that Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand was strong. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But the Boundless Big Dipper Fist should be stronger!

Even if Ye Yuan had the augmentation of perfect seventh transformation, it was also impossible to make Ao Yu be defeated so utterly, right?

The other heavenly emperors were the same too, very perplexed by this outcome.

They were not concerned about Ao Yu’s life or death, but they were very interested in the reason for Ye Yuan’s might.

“Who cares what profound mystery he has? Winning says it all! Didn’t you say earlier that Ye Yuan doesn’t have chances of winning?” Long Xiaochun napped the chance and smacked Long Tianyu’s face viciously.

Long Tianyu’s old face turned red, and he awkwardly did not dare to speak.

But Morningstar was absorbed in thought and slowly said, “If I didn’t see wrongly, Ye Yuan should have grasped the method to withdraw his strength! This kind of method can let the martial technique’s power condense without releasing, focusing onto one point. It looks ordinary, but once it erupts, it will be akin to a monstrous wave or floodwaters, being unstoppable! This way, the power that the martial technique erupts with might be two times, even several times of the original!”

“What? There’s actually still such an approach!”

“This is also too freakish! This kind of method is equivalent to forcefully raising the martial technique up a level! No wonder the Boundless Big Dipper Fist was also too weak to stand against in front of him!”

“Why have I never heard of such an approach before?”

... ...

These Heavenly Emperor powerhouses had all lived for countless years. Logically speaking, they were all people who had vast experiences and knowledge.

But the power that Ye Yuan displayed, they actually never heard of it before.

Just how many fortuitous encounters did this brat have before?

Morningstar shook his head and said, “This kind of method was very popular in the last epoch, but it has already been lost long ago. This emperor saw before just a few words in Heavenly Dragon Mountain’s ancient records. Ye Yuan’s method is very similar to what’s recorded in the ancient records.”

The group of Heavenly Emperors exchanged glances, all shocked until they could not speak.

Following Ye Yuan’s one trump card after another being exposed, the shock in their hearts grew greater and greater.

... ...

In the Mist Battlefield, Ye Yuan looked at the Ao Yu beneath his feet and said coolly, “There is no why. It’s because ... you’re too weak! So what if second awakening? You’re unable to even force out my true strength. Just this bit of strength and you also want to kill me?”

Ao Yu’s eyes were ashen, full of disbelief.

Already fought to such an extent, Ye Yuan actually did not exert his full strength yet?

Just where ... did this guy’s limits lie?

However, everything was not important anymore.

Ye Yuan stomped a foot down, directly ending his life.

Long Zheng had no grudges nor enmity with him, Ye Yuan would not deal a killing blow.

Ao Yu wanted to kill him, he naturally would not hold back either.

Seeing this scene, Ao Qi also shook his head slightly and sigh incessantly.

He did not expect that Purpledragon Stronghold produced two peerless rare geniuses. In the end, it actually wrapped up in such a manner.

Ye Yuan retrieved the dragon origin crystal and continued walking in the Mist Battlefield.

He walked leisurely and did not have much scruples.

In this Mist Battlefield, someone capable of harming him had not been born yet.

If he could not even deal with those in the same rank, that would also be too weak.

But got to admit, these Sons of the Heavenly Dragon were all very strong. Jumping realms and fighting was no object too.

If Ao Yu went out of the Mist Battlefield, he would likely be able to break through to toe Third Firmament Empyrean Realm very soon.

With his combat strength, even if he encountered a Fourth Firmament Empyrean, he would also have the strength to protect himself.

One had to know, a Fourth Firmament Empyrean versus a Third Firmament Empyrean, it was virtually a situation of getting crushed.

But in the same rank, it was far too difficult for someone to want to beat Ye Yuan.

Along with the passage of time, the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon in the Mist Battlefield became fewer and fewer.

The remainder were all elites. The battle situations also became increasingly fiercer.

After Ye Yuan wasted two Sons of the Heavenly Dragon, he ran into Long Seven unexpectedly.

Long Seven did not withdraw out of the Mist Battlefield. He was only defeated by Ao Yu and did not lose his combat strength.

After retreating, he continued searching for dragon origin crystals again.

When Long Seven saw Ye Yuan, his gaze turned cold, and he said haughtily, “It’s you, this cocky fellow? Get lost, otherwise, die!”

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he could not help failing to suppress his laughter.

These guys were really more cocky than the previous ones, all speaking the same tune when talking.

Ye Yuan completely ignored him. He walked over toward the dragon origin crystal leisurely.

Long Seven’s two eyes narrowed and he said in a cold voice, “I’m talking to you. Are you deaf? Take another step forward and I’ll make your blood splatter on the spot!”

Long Seven did not know, but the face of the Long Zifeng outside turned green.

In the Mist Battlefield, however big the commotion of two people’s fighting, the others were completely unaware too.

Long Seven was completely unaware that the Ao Yu who beat him was already trampled to death by Ye Yuan with one foot.

Now, the Long Seven who did not know the inside story actually still ran in front of Ye Yuan to posture. Wasn’t this an old person eating arsenic, being tired of living?

When the group of heavenly emperors saw this scene, they could not help finding it funny.

Even Ao Qi also could not resist mocking, “Long Zifeng, Long Seven is aiming for top three. As long as he takes Ye Yuan down, entering the top three should be certain. Oh, right, you said that you have the capital to be arrogant in front of our Purpledragon Stronghold. Now, it’s time for you to be arrogant.”

The group of heavenly emperors exclaimed into laughter.

How could the current Long Zifeng still be arrogant?

He just snorted coldly, but his gaze carried a trace of hope, hoping for Long Seven to not make a move against Ye Yuan.

But very sadly, Long Seven still made a move.

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not take him seriously at all, continuing to walk towards the dragon origin crystal, Long Seven gave a cold snort and said in a chilly voice, “Refusing face when it’s given. Do you really take yourself to be someone notable? Since you’re seeking death yourself, then you can’t blame me! Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter!”

Long Seven had also awakened two innate divine abilities, but his Heavenly Dragon Mark did not have a second awakening, so his strength was still a shade inferior to Ao Yu.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to talk nonsense. Casually throwing out a Grand Universe Palm, he directly sent Long Seven flying.

Long Seven fell to the ground, a look of shock on his face.

“This is impossible! Grand Universe Palm actually broke my Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter?” Long Seven’s eyes were full of disbelief.

The words that Ye Yuan said before entering, Long Seven did not take it to heart at all.

A fellow whose Heavenly Dragon Mark did not awaken, what strength could he have?

But now, he discovered that he was wrong!

Absurdly wrong!

Ye Yuan’s strength was really very strong!

Ye Yuan took down the dragon origin crystal and said coolly, “You should have comprehended the Boundless Big Dipper Fist too, right? If you’re unconvinced, you can use it and see.”

Contempt!

Blatantly looking down!

Long Seven was full of pride, how could he endure this goading?

“Punk, since you want to die, then I’ll send you off!”

Long Seven’s gaze turned cold, the spirit of true dragon stirring once more. Boundless Big Dipper Fist suddenly erupted!

He did not know, but the outside world’s Long Zifeng shut his eyes painfully, unable to bear to look at this scene anymore.

Sure enough, with a bang, Long Seven’s body was smacked flying out once more like a kite with a broken string.

However, Ye Yuan showed mercy this time, letting Long Seven to withdraw out of the Mist Battlefield safely.
