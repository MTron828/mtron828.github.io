Chapter 1697 Four Celestial Deities Gathered Together!

Qiao Anshan’s pupils constricted. His head felt like it exploded with a buzz.Another Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse!

This way, wouldn’t Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s Celestial Deity powerhouses be the same as Utmost Peace Imperial City?

Qiao Anshan stared fixedly at the Coldfeather above the Martial Tower’s sky, his eyes full of disbelief.

When did Celestial Deity powerhouses become cabbages?

Overnight, Heavenly Eagle actually had two more Celestial Deity powerhouses!

“This ... This is impossible! He had wasted more than 100 thousand years and has long passed his prime already! How can he possibly break through to reach the Celestial Deity Realm?”

“If say one was hitting the jackpot, then what about two? This ... This is also too ridiculous, right?”

“Who can tell me what on earth happened?”

...

Utmost Peace Imperial City’s side, each and every one of them was shocked until they could not close their mouths.

The shock that Coldfeather’s breakthrough brought to them was too much.

To the Southridge Ten Cities’ Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, the Celestial Deity Realm was like a heavenly chasm, unable to surmount it at all.

How many Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were there in the Southridge Ten Cities!

No one knew!

However, these ten cities’ Celestial Deity powerhouses added up were merely a scanty few 20 to 30 people!

This kind of breakthrough ratio virtually made people despair.

Hence, don’t look at how those in the Celestial Deity Realm such Zheng Qi, Ning Tianping, they were extremely talented. When arriving in front of the threshold of Celestial Deity Realm, that was an insurmountable high mountain!

Put in the past, it was hard for the Southridge Ten Cities to produce one who broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm in 10 thousand years.

But today, two broke through all at once!

The inspector’s gaze flickered incessantly, titanic waves stirred up in his heart too.

With his eyes, he could naturally see through that Zheng Qi also just broke through not long ago.

Now, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City had another one who broke through!

What was going on today?

Could this ... really be a coincidence?

“Head Elder Ye Yuan is mighty!”

“Head Elder Ye Yuan is mighty!”

“Head Elder Ye Yuan is mighty!”

...

Just as the Inspector and Utmost Peace Imperial City’s powerhouses were in immense shock, a tsunami-like clamor came from below.

Coincidence?

How was this possible!

Experiencing the initial-most shock, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s powerhouses came to realize the truth very quickly.

Zheng Qi’s and Coldfeather’s breakthroughs were absolutely not some coincidental events!

All of this was thanks to Head Elder Ye Yuan!

If it were before, they would naturally feel that this was nonsense.

An initial-rank Four-star Alchemy God, could he dictate the breakthroughs of Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses?

This was utterly rubbish!

But now, no one would doubt it!

During these ten years, Ye Yuan created countless miracles with his power alone.

Very old undying existences who already could not possibly break through long ago, all gained a new lease on life, making breakthroughs again under Ye Yuan’s rank four divine pills.

Therefore, they had reason to believe that today’s miracle was bestowed by Head Elder Ye Yuan. It was not simple a coincidence.

The inspector trembled all over, looking at Ye Yuan in incredible shock. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Only now did he know that this little fellow who was merely first-layered heaven Divine Lord was actually even Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s head elder!

What kind of concept was this?

Either Zuo Shujie’s brain was spoiled, or this kid had extremely extraordinary aspects!

Clearly, Zuo Shujie’s head could not possibly be spoiled. Then ... the answer was self-evident.

It was just that he racked his head and also could not figure out how Ye Yuan dictated two great Celestial Deity powerhouses to breakthrough.

He did not think of medicinal pills at all. A first-layered heaven Divine Lord refining the Supreme Jade Void Pill?

Are you kidding me?

“Hahaha ... Qiao Anshan, now, my Heavenly Eagle has four Celestial Deity powerhouses too! I see what you have to be arrogant!” Zuo Shujie said with a loud laugh.

Among the Southridge Ten Cities, Heavenly Eagle was considered as an existence with the lowest strength.

He, this city lord, had always tucked his tail between his legs and behaved.

Today, he could finally hold his head up high.

Giving birth to two great Celestial Deity powerhouses within one day, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s strength could soar to the front ranks all at once.

Qiao Anshan’s expression was ugly to the extreme. This sudden change caught him by surprise.

Hearing the shouts from below, he was similarly extremely shocked in his heart.

Could it be that Zheng Qi and Coldfeather’s breakthroughs were actually thanks to Ye Yuan?

It was only to see him snort coldly. He said, “Zuo Shujie, don’t get arrogant! The Golden Sword Pact is a life-and-death battle. Can two Celestial Deity Realms who just broke through change the battle situation?”

Zuo Shujie simply ignored him, turned to Ye Yuan, and laughed loudly as he said, “Ye Yuan, you actually really did it! This battle, you’ve earned the most credit!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Arranged some means in order to enter the Martial Tower and delayed some time. Fortunately, it wasn’t too late.”

Zuo Shujie’s gaze turned intent, sniffing a hint of something unusual from Ye Yuan’s words.

Why did Coldfeather’s breakthrough have to be inside the Martial Tower?

Seemed like ... there was some story!

Qiao Anshan could not quite stand still anymore. He gritted his teeth, toughened his scalp, and said to the inspector, “Lord Inspector, this lowly official requests to immediately start the Golden Sword Pact!”

Although Coldfeather and Zheng Qi both just broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm, Celestial Deity Realm was Celestial Deity Realm!

If it was really four-versus-four, the variables were too great.

However, the inspector’s expression turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “Are you teaching this envoy on how to do things?”

Qiao Anshan was startled inwardly and hurriedly said, “This ... This lowly official dare not!”

The inspector gave a cold snort and said, “Good that you don’t dare! Once the breakthrough starts, he’s a member of our generation! How can the Golden Sword Pact, such a major event, be treated as a child’s play? Starting the Golden Sword Pact now, are you trying to have everyone talk behind this envoy’s back? Mn?”

Qiao Anshan broke out in cold sweat and repeatedly said that he dare not.

The inspector said in a cold voice, “If this matter was passed back to the imperial capital, do you think that I can continue to be an inspector? Or is it that you want this envoy to show partiality to your Utmost Peace Imperial City and slaughter the entire Heavenly Eagle?”

Qiao Anshan’s sweat fell like a waterfall and did not even have time wipe away sweat as he hurriedly said, “T-This lowly official knows my mistake! This lowly official was just ... just anxious and didn’t expect that it offended Your Excellency. I hope that Your Excellency doesn’t blame me!”

The inspector said in a cold voice, “Stand down! After he breaks through, the Golden Sword Pact will commence immediately!”

How could Qiao Anshan still dare to speak? He could only retreat to one side and did not even dare to let out a fart.

Time slowly trickled by, spiritual energy also gradually dissipated.

But the aura on Coldfeather gradually became stronger.

“Hahaha ... I didn’t expect it! Truly didn’t think that this old man actually still has a day where I broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm!”

After breaking through, Coldfeather let out a wild laugh, reverberating throughout heaven and earth.

Over 400 years ago, he was still trapped inside the spatial inheritance, unable to escape at all.

At that time, he never dreamed that he would actually still have a day where he could break through to the Celestial Deity Realm in this lifetime.

This was something that he did not even dare to dream about during the past 100 thousand years.

But today, Ye Yuan actually helped him to actualize it.

Swoosh!

Coldfeather strode out, crossing a distance of 100 thousand feet, directly arriving at Ye Yuan’s side.

i the Supreme Jade Void Pill is indeed wondrous! Ye Yuan, the favor that this old man owes you can’t be repaid entirely in this lifetime!” Coldfeather said to Ye Yuan with a big laugh.

Suddenly, he felt the powerful pressure on the inspector’s body. Coldfeather’s expression changed and he bowed as he said, “Heavenly Eagle’s Coldfeather, pays respect to Lord Inspector!”

The inspector nodded slightly and said, “Mn, since you’ve already broken through, the Golden Sword Pact will start at once!”
