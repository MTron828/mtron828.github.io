1840 What is Love?

“Just that? If I say no?” Little Tong’s gaze looked at Ye Yuan scorchingly as he said in a solemn voice.

He was an exalted Empyrean powerhouse. Even if his strength was no longer there now, he was also not what anybody could knead.

He did not believe that Ye Yuan really dared to do something to him.

As long as anyone found out, Ye Yuan would definitely die.

How did the current Little Tong still look like a little kid? His face was full of wisdom that was not commensurate with his age.

Treasure Pig looked back at Little Tong with a pitiful appearance. It truly gave people a feeling of unable to help to show tender care when one saw it.

But Little Tong snorted coldly and said, “You stupid pig, it’s none of your business here. Get back here for me!”

Treasure Pig’s head shook like a rattle-drum but hugged Ye Yuan’s leg even harder.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heavenly Emperor Realm! Don’t you wish to step into the realm of Heavenly Emperor?”

Little Tong’s expression finally had a change.

But very soon, he laughed coldly and said, “Heh, Heavenly Emperor Realm, just the likes of you, a measly Celestial Deity Realm, also dares to make this kind of promise to me?”

But Ye Yuan did not care at all and said with a faint smile, “Bamboo Groove Void Realm is only a tiny place in the end, a subsidiary of the Heavenspan World. Even if you’re a god-like existence in this place, it’s ultimately just deceiving yourself and others too, no? Moreover, your current situation in the temple probably isn’t too good, right?”

Little Tong’s expression changed again and again, Ye Yuan’s observation ability was too sharp.

He had clearly never been in contact with the temple’s upper echelons and knew absolutely nothing about the temple’s situation. Just by relying on what he saw and his guts, he could guess so many things.

This mind was tough for ordinary people to match!

Furthermore, the most, most important thing was that Ye Yuan’s words hit the bottom of his heart.

They all, these Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s supreme powerhouses, all enjoyed the worship of all life, enjoying the treatment of a god.

They were afraid of facing the outside world.

Empyrean powerhouses were indeed a formidable force in the Heavenspan World. But to talk about being powerful, that could not be said no matter what.

There were still Heavenly Emperor powerhouses above Empyreans. There were Transcendent Heavenly Emperors, and even Dao Ancestors!

What did Empyreans count for?

Any random Heavenly Emperor powerhouse that came out could instantly kill them!

Putting it bluntly, they were merely frogs at the bottom of a well, intoxicated in their own world, that was all.

Ye Yuan observed his words and expression and continued, “I’m just at the Celestial Deity Realm, so I’m naturally not qualified enough to babble away about Heavenly Emperor. But my alchemy skills, you’ve witnessed it before. How do you think it compares to you?”

Little Tong was silent, his expression rather ugly.

“Grunt, grunt ...”

Little Tong did not speak, but Treasure Pig sounded out.

That meaning was very clear, Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills were tastier than Little Tong’s!

Little Tong wished to kick it flying with a foot and said furiously, “You creature who lives off me while secretly helping others, you scram with him then. The further you scram, the better!”

Treasure Pig had an aggrieved look, it was just telling the truth.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he also could not help smiling.

Treasure Pig’s requirement towards the quality of medicinal pills was exceedingly high. He was already used to eating Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills now. Du Rufeng’s medicinal pills were already tasteless to him.

“Since that’s the case, how do you know that I’m unable to refine medicinal pills to let you break through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor in the future?”

Finished saying these, Ye Yuan stopped talking, quietly waiting for Little Tong’s outcome. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He was confident in himself that Little Tong would definitely agree.

His strength was currently very weak, staying in the temple was very dangerous instead. Might as well go outside together with him and make his break.

“Alright, you win. I’ll go with you! Now, release the restrictions on me!” No idea how long had passed, Little Tong finally agreed.

Hearing Little Tong agree, Treasure Pig immediately started jumping happily.

Nothing was more important than delicious food.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That won’t do, an Empyrean powerhouse who became a child is also an Empyrean powerhouse. I don’t want to take my life as a joke. I have a poison here that I specially made for you. When you consume it, I’ll release the restrictions for you.”

Little Tong was angered until his expression was livid. Glaring fiercely at Ye Yuan, he said, “Punk, when I recover my strength, I’ll definitely kill you straight away!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “You won’t! Kill me and there won’t be anyone to refine pills for Treasure Pig anymore. Don’t you say so, Treasure Pig?”

Treasure Pig nodded its head very seriously and tunneled into Ye Yuan’s bosom with a grunt.

...

“What? You want to enter the Heavenspan World?” When Du Rufeng heard Little Tong’s words, he nearly jumped up.

Little Tong said with a serious look, “I’ve thought about it, better leave first for the time being. I returned to boyhood from old age because of my cultivation method. This matter can’t be hidden for long. Once Daoless that old fogey knows about my current situation, he likely won’t let me off.”

Du Rufeng’s face changed and he said, “Then ... this disciple will follow you together to the Heavenspan World!”

Little Tong shook his head and said, “No, even if you go, you can’t be of any help too. Ye Yuan accompanying me will do.”

Du Rufeng was taken aback and said, “Y-Ye Yuan?”

Little Tong could not resist rolling his eyes and said with a nod, “Right now, Treasure Pig has stopped eating your medicinal pills already. Do you think that you can replace Ye Yuan’s position? Relax, just take it as bringing him out to train. This boy is a promising talent.”

Du Rufeng nodded his head, deeply feeling that way too, and said, “Then ... alright, but Your Excellency must be careful. The Heavenspan World can’t compare to the Bamboo Groove Void Realm. Experts are plentiful like clouds.”

With this excuse, Ye Yuan going to the Heavenspan World became proper and justified.

He also did not need to worry that the temple would vent their anger on the Shadowmoon Sect because of this.

Before leaving the Bamboo Groove Void Realm, Du Rufeng even found a large pile of rank five spirit medicines and directly gave it to Ye Yuan.

Treasure Pig was a big glutton, not bringing along enough food would not do.

Actually, after Ye Yuan opened up the Purple Extreme Hall’s second level, he was also rather wealthy now. Purchasing rank five spirit medicines was still doable.

But with the temple’s present, he naturally accepted it graciously too.

Ten days later, two people and one pig entered the heart of the void realm, disappearing from everyone’s sight.

...

Seven years later, the other four people recovered from their enlightenment.

“Looks like you all had significant harvests. Alright, this matter is settled. This old man can now go back and report on the fulfillment of the mission. Come on,” Du Rufeng said coolly.

But Baili Qingyan’s brows furrowed and she said, “Elder Du, where’s Ye Yuan? Why is he not here?”

Du Rufeng said, “Ye Yuan finished comprehending one step ahead of you guys. The temple just happened to have a mission for him, so he left first.”

Baili Qingyan suddenly had a trace of an ominous feeling in her heart and she said, “Mission? Ye Yuan is merely a disciple who just entered the sect, what kind of mission would he be assigned? Also, Little Tong and Treasure Pig are also gone! Elder Du, what in the world happened.”

Du Rufeng’s face was rather ugly, and he said in a solemn voice, “This is the temple’s business. How is it your turn to tell us what to do?”

Baili Qingyan was very smart. Ye Yuan’s disappearance was too unusual, he kept feeling that something happened and felt empty in her heart as if she lost something.

Her heart hurt!

“Sorry, Elder Du, I ...” Baili Qingyan felt wronged as she said.

How could Du Rufeng not know her thoughts? He let out a sigh and said, “Alright, come on!”

Baili Qingyan nodded her head and followed everyone, preparing to leave.

But when everyone was not paying attention, Baili Qingyan suddenly took a step, flying towards the heart of the void realm, disappearing.

When Du Rufeng saw her disappearing back view, he could not help shaking his head. With his strength, if he really wanted to stop Baili Qingyan, he could naturally do it.

But he did not.

Du Rufeng sighed and said, “Pray ask what is love, guiding people till death do them apart! Forget it, let her be! The few of you, today’s matter, you’re absolutely not allowed to say a word! Otherwise, you all know the consequences!”
