Chapter 2172: Long Yuan’s True Trump Card!

“Second awakening! Long Yuan awakened a second time! Hahaha ... really have to thank Ye Yuan. If not for his stimulation, it would really not be so easy for Long Yuan to want to awaken a second time.”

Long Tianyu could not resist letting out a burst of loud laughter when he saw the Long Yuan on the light screen.

To a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, the stronger the bloodline, the harder it was to awaken.

Long Yuan’s bloodline could be said to be the strongest existence among the group of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon.

Him being able to awaken once in itself already illustrated that his talent was astonishing.

But wanting to awaken a second time, even if he refined numerous dragon origin crystals, he might not be able to accomplish it too.

However, under Ye Yuan’s powerful pressure, Long Yuan’s Heavenly Dragon Mark actually awakened a second time.

First awakening, bloodline rose sharply by ten times!

Under the augmentation of bloodline, the advancement of the Son of the Heavenly Dragon was all-round.

Long Zifeng also said in surprise, “I didn’t expect that Ye Yuan is peerlessly talented, but then at the end he actually became a wedding gown for Long Yuan! Looks like the Battle of Dragon Sons this time, it’s still Long Yuan who wins by a notch in the end!”

A Heavenly Emperor said, “A shame! With Ye Yuan’s potential, if given time, his achievements might not be beneath Long Yuan’s. It’s just that ... Long Yuan awakened a second time, he probably wouldn’t let him off.”

... ...

In the Mist Battlefield, Long Yuan’s vital energy surged to the sky.

The bloodline pressure that suffused the air was significantly stronger than before.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene rather interestedly and did not interrupt the other party in fluster and exasperation.

“Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, really got to thank you! If not for you, I still wouldn’t know when my second awakening would have to wait until!” Long Yuan said with a wild laugh.

At this very moment, Long Yuan felt unprecedentedly well, feeling that he was unprecedentedly powerful.

His bloodline power was extremely strong in the first place. Now that it awakened a second time, it soared wildly by ten times.

This kind of increment was sufficient to insta-kill everything to a genius like him!

“You’re welcome. Honestly speaking, your bit of strength previously wasn’t enough for me to warm up yet. Hope that you don’t disappoint me this time,” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Provoking!

Blatant provocation!

Even if your strength skyrocketed, I’ll still look down on you!

Long Yuan’s eyes narrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Very well! I’ll let you understand how serious the consequences of provoking me is!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said coolly, “I’m waiting.”

Long Yuan was triggered by Ye Yuan’s nonchalant attitude until he was going crazy.

He stared at Ye Yuan coldly and said, “You must think that Divine Lightning Devastation is my limit, right? Let me tell you. Unfortunately for you, I already comprehended the third innate divine ability before my second awakening! After the second awakening, the power of innate divine abilities skyrockets by ten times! I want to see what you’ll use to block!”

“Watch closely! Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning!”

Lightning sea again!

But this time, it was vastly different from that time before.

The taste of five elements law pervaded the air.

Five-colored lightning interweaved and fluctuated above the void. It was as if it was a dreamland, beautiful and luscious.

A grand sight!

But behind this magnificent scenery, it contained tremendous danger.

Seeing this Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning, Ye Yuan could not help thinking of the Greater Five Elements Heavenly Tribulation that he had once transcended in the Immortal Grove World.

It was just that Long Yuan’s innate divine ability was no idea how many levels higher compared to that Greater Five Elements Heavenly Tribulation.

Five elements heavenly lightning concealed above the ninth heaven, shocking the world!

At the outside world was boiling over with excitement long ago.

“This kid ... actually comprehended a third innate divine ability!”

“Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning! This innate divine ability can be said to be the strongest lightning-attribute! It’s said that when cultivated to the extreme, it can virtually stand on par with Lightning Ancestor!”

“Truly broadened my horizons today! These two great geniuses are truly each more astonishing than the other!”

... ...

Although they were all Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, in front of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon, especially in front of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon like Long Yuan and Ye Yuan, they were nothing at all.

As long as they stepped into the realm of Heavenly Emperor in the future, they could one-shot them with one hand.

This kind of genius, they were the true major power candidates.

As long as them had sufficient time, they would be able to make the entire Heavenspan World trembled!

Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning was one of the Dragon Clan’s strongest innate divine abilities. It virtually represented the limits of lightning-attribute laws.

Following the increase in Long Yuan’s strength, the power of this innate divine ability would grow with each passing day.

After Long Yuan reached the realm of Transcendent Heavenly Emperor, its power would be extremely terrifying.

If the Lightning Ancestor did not emerge, who could contend?! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Even Morningstar also stood up agitatedly, looking at that high and mighty figure on the light screen with a look of pleasant surprise.

“Hahaha ... really didn’t expect that such a great talent actually appeared in the Battle of Dragon Sons this time! My Dragon Clan shall descend upon Heavenspan World and make the world tremble! Tianyu, you hid from this emperor so bitterly!” Morningstar said agitatedly.

Long Tianyu was clearly in the know long ago. The smugness on his face currently could not be concealed no matter what.

“Heh heh, Lord Morningstar, it wasn’t that Tianyu had the intention of hiding it. Originally, I thought that Long Yuan wouldn’t use this final move. I didn’t expect that it was actually forced out by Ye Yuan. It’s Long Yuan who decided to tell you after the Battle of Dragon Sons!” Long Tianyu said with a smile.

The other heavenly emperors had envious looks on their faces. Toward such a genius that was hard to come by in a million years, who did not want?

As the saying went, When one man attained Dao, his fowls and dogs ascended to heaven too.

When Long Yuan entered Heavenly Dragon Mountain in the future, Heavenly Dragon Stronghold’s strength would definitely scale new heights.

The disparity would grow bigger and bigger.

Long Xiaochun pursed her mouth at one side, clearly very unhappy with Morningstar’s performance.

He was still very optimistic about Ye Yuan just now. In a blink of an eye, he leaned toward Long Yuan again.

... ...

Electric current revolved around Long Yuan, his body emitting an extremely horrifying aura.

Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning was an extremely formidable innate divine ability in the first place. Its power was even a notch stronger than Heretic Dragon Dominating Space.

Now, he awakened a second time. It could be seen how powerful this innate divine ability was.

He looked at Ye Yuan as if looking at a dead person.

“Tremble! To be able to die under the divine punishment, you can be sufficiently proud! Five Elements Heavenly Lightning, Divine Punishment!”

A hint of cruelty flashed across the corners of Long Yuan’s mouth, akin to the Heavenly Dao which ruled the world, deciding Ye Yuan’s life and death.

Only to see him reach his hand out and beckon, lightning snakes that filled the sky ran wild like a host of demons dancing in riotous revelry, galloping towards Ye Yuan.

At this very moment, even if Ye Yuan used Heretic Dragon Dominating Space this move, it would be totally impossible to salvage the deteriorating situation too.

“Ye Yuan!” Long Xiaochun’s face turned white as she cried out in surprise.

Although she could not feel the power of Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning. just based on the frenzied scene on the light screen, Long Xiaochun could determine just how perilous Ye Yuan was at this moment.

Morningstar sighed slightly. In his view, Ye Yuan would definitely die without a doubt under the Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning.

At this moment, everyone sentenced Ye Yuan to the death penalty.

One awakened a second time, one did not awaken.

This enormous gap made people unable to find any excuse at all to feel that Ye Yuan had a chance to escape with his life.

However, from start until now, Ye Yuan never moved all along. He did not even release an innate divine ability to face the enemy.

However, just as the endless lightning was about to engulf him, Ye Yuan’s lips moved!

Yes!

What moved was only his lips.
