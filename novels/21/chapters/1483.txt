Chapter 1487 Can Give It a Try

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “So-so I guess. But it should be slightly higher than you all.”

One sentence nearly choked everyone to death. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Seen before shamelessness, but never seen before this shameless!

This skill of climbing up along the shaft was already at the acme of perfection!

“Where did this punk pop out from? To actually dare be so arrogant!”

“The five elders have immersed in Alchemy Dao for all their lives, their alchemy strengths have long attained the acme of perfection. How can they let a fool tarnish their reputation?”

“Lord Meng Qi, being so long-winded with this brat for what? Directly kill him!”

...

Ye Yuan’s words directly incurred public wrath.

When Li Ji saw that the scene was somewhat out of control, she winked furiously at Ye Yuan in anxiety.

She was secretly pouring out endless grievances in her heart. At this rate, this big sister can’t save you anyhow!

Meng Qi’s gaze was slightly cold. Using a hand gesture to stop the others’ excoriation, he said in a cold voice, “Brat, spouting wild drivel in the Fiend Medicine Hall, the Fan Family can’t save you no matter what! Come, men! Cripple this brat for me and throw him to the medicine garden as fertilizer!”

Under Meng Qi’s command, over a dozen big strong men suddenly popped out in the hall. One look and it was clear that they were not weak.

Li Ji’s expression changed drastically. Pulling Meng Qi’s arm, she begged, “Grandpa Meng Qi, you watched Li Ji grow up since young! He ... He’s my man. I beg you, give him a way out, alright?”

Li Ji’s tone was virtually carrying tears.

She was all too clear about the might of the Blood Yama Hall’s Fiend Medicine Hall. The Fan Family also could not possibly go to war with the Fiend Medicine Hall because of a puny little Source Night.

Really angering the Fiend Medicine Hall, directly destroying the Fan Family was also not impossible!

Meng Qi glanced at Li Ji, looked at Ye Yuan again, and said with a cold snort, “Brat, don’t say that this old man didn’t give you a chance! These five furnaces of scrapped pills, you pick one at will. Able to differentiate any scrap pill’s 30% composition, I’ll spare your life!”

Li Ji panicked again the moment she heard and said, “Grandpa Meng Qi!”

Meng Qi gave a snort and said, “Lass, if not looking on the account of your face, this old man won’t even give him this bit of chance! If he understands alchemy, then forget it. If this kid pretends to know what he doesn’t know and ruins this old man’s reputation here, could it be that this old man still has to let him off?”

Differentiating a scrap pill’s composition. To very proficient Fiend Apothecaries, they might not be able to say it all correctly.

Differentiating a scrap pill’s composition was totally different from distinguishing a medicinal embryo’s composition.

Scrap pills’ various ingredients had already fused together through the pill furnace’s tempering; making no distinction between each other.

Wanting to differentiate, the difficulty was immense.

Even Meng Qi himself, if under the situation of not knowing the pill formula, he could at most differentiate 70% too.

Him making this request of Ye Yuan was not considered excessive. It really gave some face to Li Ji.

But his own face still had to be preserved too.

30%, no less!

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just differentiating the elements, easy.”

“Easy? Not afraid of twisting your tongue when bragging too! Lass, you don’t even give face to Ka Xin that brat. At the end of the day, you found such a hothead?” Meng Qi billowed his beard and glared as he said.

Li Ji’s face turned red and could not help looking over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan did not speak, directly coming in front of Meng Qi’s medicinal cauldron. Palm surging forward, a ball of black sticky substance was shaken out.

Seeing this, a hint of surprise was briefly shown on Meng Qi’s face.

When experts make their move, the genuine and the fake would become clear at a glance.

Ye Yuan’s grasp toward medicinal cauldrons was evident. One look, and he was obviously a very experienced person.

It looked like this kid was really an expert.

It was just that, wanting to say that Ye Yuan could differentiate the scrap pill’s composition, he did not believe.

Ye Yuan observed slightly for a while, sniffed, and said coolly, “Inside, there’s Dragon Beard Root, Fiend Flame Crystal, Rosewood Assimilation Crane Grass ...”

Ye Yuan took his time and reported the names of each and every spirit medicine.

With each name reported, the expression on everyone’s face was a degree more shocked.

After Ye Yuan reported the final name, he pursed his lips and said, “It’s a shame, your control over fire is too inadequate. In the first step of tempering, the fire was 30% too hot. In the third step, it was 20% too weak. The fourth step ... Furthermore, your attention was so scattered when you refine pills; you’re completely unable to integrate the Dao accumulations. Even if you form the pill, it is at most also just low-grade.”

Everyone’s gazes all looked toward Meng Qi. These things, they could not tell, and were all very curious, wanting to listen to Meng Qi’s own view.

There was no expression on Meng Qi’s face, seemingly turning his nose up at Ye Yuan’s remarks.

Actually, in his heart, monstrous waves had long been set off already.

This kid was formidable! To actually discern so many things from a scrap pill!

One’s personal affairs, one would be aware. Although Meng Qi’s standard was lousy, he was a pill refining veteran already as well. How could he not know where he went wrong?

But knowing did not mean being able to overcome.

There was a limit to a person’s strength and when methods were pointless. At times, no matter how hard one worked, they were also unable to break through.

Alchemy was a delicate task in the first place. It could not allow the slightest hint of error.

However, Meng Qi was at any rate a leading authority-class figure among Fiend Apothecaries. Being preached to in public by a kid still wet behind his hearts, where would he put his face?

He toughened his scalp and answered back sarcastically, “Heh, do you know how great the refinement difficulty of the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill is? You argued it reasonably and logically. If you have the ability, refine one for me to see!”

The Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill was indeed a very hard to refine Two-star divine pill. Among Capone Capital City’s Two-star Fiend Apothecaries, only he could refine it.

Even the others present could not refine it at all.

Hence, he wanted to use this sentence to shut Ye Yuan’s mouth, and make him stop ‘talking nonsense’.

However, he was disappointed.

Ye Yuan looked at him with a smile that was not a smile and said, “You really want me to refine?”

Meng Qi was first stunned, following that, his expression turned sullen and he said, “Rubbish! Who doesn’t know how to speak thoughtlessly? You say that we all can’t do it, then you refine one for me to see! If you can’t refine, hurry up and get lost for this old man!”

He did not believe that this punk could really refine the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill!

These words sounded very tough on the surface, but actually, it was already equivalent to acknowledging Ye Yuan’s level.

Ye Yuan’s composition was said without the slightest error. This point could not be hoodwinked.

Meng Qi reckoned that Ye Yuan definitely had a very formidable master at the back and taught his basic skills very solidly.

But to say that Ye Yuan could refine the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill, he did not believe even if he was beaten to death.

Without several thousand years of cultivation, wanting to refine this difficulty of Two-star divine pill was virtually impossible!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill, I really never refined before.”

Hearing this, Meng Qi’s heart eased up. This kid finally yielded.

He was just about to speak, but heard Ye Yuan say leisurely, “But if insisting for me to refine, I can give it a try.”

Meng Qi nearly spat out a mouthful of old blood. Don’t have such a long pause when talking!

Hang on, first time refining?

“Kid, did you take the wrong medicine? Do you think that you’re the Medicine Ancestor? No matter what kind of medicinal pill, you’re able to produce it off the top of your head?”

“You never refined before the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill. This is deliberately toying with us?”

“Lord Meng Qi already spared your life, you still want to go too far, is it?”

...

Ye Yuan’s words immediately brought down a wave of condemnation.
