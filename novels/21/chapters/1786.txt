Chapter 1790 Won“t Be So Lucky Next Time

Celestial Deity powerhouse!

This youth in blue in front of him was a genuine Celestial Deity powerhouse!

He used a gaze that overlooked the ground below from a height, gazing at Ye Yuan apathetically.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was icy-cold, and he said with a cold smile, “An exalted Celestial Deity powerhouse actually sneak attacked a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, your esteemed self is truly awe-inspiring!”

Qian Ye’s ambush could be said to be very shameless.

The attack of a Celestial Deity powerhouse, how powerful was that?

Even in a head-on crushing, Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were completely not a match too. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

But this Qian Ye actually chose to ambush, and it was even during Ye Yuan and Zhong Hanlin’s great battle.

Qian Ye said coolly, “Hanlin is my Soaring Flower Sect’s genius. His future prospects are limitless. Him entering the sect is already set in stone. You want to kill him, I made a move to stop you. What’s the problem.”

Ye Yuan sneered when he heard that and said, “Is that so? You didn’t just make a move to stop earlier, right?”

Qian Ye’s brows raised up, and he still said calmly, “A Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, if killed, then killed, it’s of no importance to the sect.”

The moment these words came out, the other people all revealed strange expressions.

Of no importance?

A peerless genius who fused Sword Dao laws and spatial law was actually of no importance to the sect?

These words were truly shameless!

“H-Heh heh, a trash like you can even enter the sect, I can’t?” Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and said sarcastically.

Qian Ye’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said unhappily, “You said that I’m trash?”

Qian Ye was an outstanding person of the young generation and had long promoted to an inner-disciple. He was a pillar of the Soaring Flower lineage.

Now, he was actually said to be trash by someone.

“An exalted Celestial Deity powerhouse sneak attacked and actually couldn’t even kill a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord. I say, are you trash or not? What use does the sect want a trash like you for?”

Ye Yuan’s sharp retort rendered Qian Ye speechless.

Ye Yuan comprehended spatial law and was extremely sensitive to spatial fluctuations.

Wanting to sneak attack, one must reduce the undulations of space to freezing point.

This was still when Ye Yuan and Zhong Hanlin were currently fighting, the majority of his mind placed on Zhong Hanlin.

Otherwise, if he wanted to ambush, it would be totally impossible.

But even so, he still failed.

Ye Yuan’s sensitivity to spatial law exceeded his imagination.

Qian Ye’s expression was livid as he said in a solemn voice, “Razor-tongued brat, but it doesn’t matter, because you won’t be able to speak anymore very soon.”

Finished talking, Qian Ye’s Celestial Deity Realm pressure suddenly erupted and was about to take action against Ye Yuan.

Suddenly, a graceful figure dashed out swiftly, blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

Qian Ye’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Baili Qingyan, you want to get in my way?”

Baili Qingyan’s expression was calm as she said, “Before completing the first round assessment, he’s my companion. No one is allowed to kill him!”

Qian Ye’s expression changed and he said with a cold snort, “With just you?”

From when he saw Ye Yuan fighting Zhong Hanlin and Duan Qinghong alone, he already decided to kill Ye Yuan.

Such a monstrous existence would surely break the Shadowmoon Sect’s current structure.

Currently, the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave was at hand, he would not allow such a thing to happen.

The entrance examination this time, he just so happened to be picked to be in charge of supervising and protecting these disciples.

But he did not expect that he encountered such a thing.

Hence, he decisively made a move to ambush Ye Yuan.

While talking, Qian Ye’s aura grew even stronger. Baili Qingyan’s power improved greatly, but it was still too weak in front of Qian Ye.

Ye Yuan’s face fell, planning on letting Dustless take action.

That evil spirit was currently Ye Yuan’s trump card. In this foreign sect, Ye Yuan did not wish to expose him prematurely, so he did not take action all along.

As long as Dustless made a move, finishing off Qian Ye was also a cinch.

But that way, he would not have a backup plan anymore.

The Soaring Flying lineage’s and Cloudsword lineage’s strengths were definitely far beyond this.

Once they knew his trump card, it would be much easier for them to want to plot against him.

Looking at it now, he had no choice but to take action.

Suddenly, his heart stirred and made Dustless withdraw again.

“Baili can’t, then what about me?”

A woman in a martial arts outfit slowly stepped out of the void, making Qian Ye’s expression choke up.

That instant when this woman appeared, he knew that he could not kill Ye Yuan today.

Her looks could not compare to Baili Qingyan’s, but her disposition was similarly extraordinary.

The martial arts outfit added some heroism. She was not the least bit weaker than Qian Ye in terms of imposing momentum.

“Jiang Xueyan, I didn’t have the intention of touching Baili Qingyan. You move aside, the person that I want to kill is that kid!” Qian Ye pointed at the Ye Yuan behind Baili Qingyan and said.

Jiang Xueyan sized Ye Yuan up with curiosity and said coolly, “The person that Baili wants to protect is what the person that my Immortal Abode Sect wants to protect. If you want to kill him, pass me first!”

“You! Jiang Xueyan, are you waging war with our Soaring Flower lineage?”

Jiang Xueyan pursed her lips and said with disdain, “So what if start a war? You said it as if our Immortal Abode Sect is scared of you!”

Qian Ye was angered until his expression was livid. This woman was notoriously difficult to deal with, no idea why she showed up here today.

But no idea what the hell was wrong with this Baili Qingyan, to actually want to protect Ye Yuan no matter what.

Really depressing!

Jiang Xueyan saw Qian Ye being quiet, and so she said with a cold smile, “Qian Ye, don’t you forget your identity! The sect asked you to come to protect these examinees, and not to kill them! I say, if I reported this matter to the sect, would the Law Enforcement Hall come to find trouble with you or not?”

Qian Ye stared fixedly at Jiang Xueyan, gnashing his teeth in hatred as he said, “Consider yourself ruthless! Kid, consider yourself lucky today. The next time, you won’t be so lucky.”

Inside the Shadowmoon Sect, the various major factions’ strifes were severe.

Although Ye Yuan was talented, wanting to kill him was too easy.

In short, he would not give Ye Yuan the chance to grow up.

Ye Yuan did not give any impression of weakness and said through clenched teeth, “You got it the other way around. Next time, you won’t be so lucky!”

Qian Ye was taken aback when he heard and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Haha, alright then, I’ll wait for next time! Hanlin, let’s go!”

After Qian Ye left, Jiang Xueyan’s face fell and she said in a cold voice, “What are you all stoning for? Leave behind the heavenly demon crystals, scram!”

How could the Devil Elephant lineage’s disciples still dare to stay? Each and every one scrambled away.

After everyone left, Baili Qingyan had a look of joy like a little girl who saw her big sister. Pulling Jiang Xueyan, she said, “Senior Apprentice Sister, you really came too in time. Otherwise, this guy is dead for sure.”

But Jiang Xueyan’s face turned cold and she said, “You lass, to actually not even want your life anymore for a man, are you crazy?”

Baili Qingyan’s pretty face turned red and she refuted, “Senior Apprentice Sister, where are you going with this? He ... He’s just my companion.”

Ye Yuan also cupped his fists and said, “Senior Sister Jiang, many thanks for taking action to help! Senior Sister is indeed mistaken. Miss Baili and I are just teaming up in this assessment. There’s nothing else.”

Hearing this, Baili Qingyan’s heart felt very uncomfortable.

This guy really did not understand the relationship between men and women at all.

Jiang Xueyan’s pretty face turned cold, and she said in a cold voice, “Best that there isn’t! Punk, don’t blame me for not warning you. Stay further away from Baili. Otherwise, you’ll die very horribly!”
