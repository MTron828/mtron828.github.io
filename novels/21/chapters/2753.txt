Chapter 2759: Darkness Under a Lamp!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Amidst the spatial turbulent flows, Ye Yuan held the Heavenspan Mountain in his left hand, and his right hand held the five-colored heavenly stone.

A pale yellow ball of light wrapped the two small mountains up respectively.

Ye Yuan shut both eyes, carefully feeling the undulations of the two treasures.

With the Wordless Heavenly Skill as a guide, after he guided the two small mountains to the same frequency, they would be able to fuse.

Suddenly, his two hands gradually drew close. The two small mountains actually started merging!

Rumble?…

A powerful undulation caused the void to tremble violently.

The two small mountains fused into one. A terrifying power spread out, making the few planes in the distance all start to tremble violently.

This was also why Ye Yuan fused them in the spatial turbulent flow. If it was in Withered Glory Great World, the undulation could completely destroy this great trichiliocosm immediately.

Grade two grandmist treasure corresponded to the power of a True Sovereign Heaven.

And once the Myriad Realms Mountain was refined, it was a top existence among grade two grandmist treasures.

Its power was naturally extraordinary.

“Done!”

Looking at the two small mountains fusing into one, Ye Yuan said excitedly.

He could feel that powerful strength coming from the Myriad Realms Mountain!

Ye Yuan was certain that as long as he urged the Myriad Realms Mountain now, he could directly crush lower Jade Sovereign Heavens to death!

This Myriad Realms Mountain was even stronger than the Emerald Sea Divine Conch!

Concerning the current Myriad Realms Mountain, the top of the mountain was composed of five kinds of colors, while the base was completely black.

Ye Yuan got up, his gaze looking at the end of the void, and said with a frown, “Where the hell did he hide Li-er? It’s been two years. Those that should have been found, I found them all. There’s only Li-er left! Frivolous Life Like a Dream should have already flared up. However … it probably can’t stop him from breaking through, right?”

Another two years had passed since finding White Light.

In these two years, Ye Yuan had found god knows how many planes by searching based on clues.

However, he could not find Li-er’s traces from start to end.

Looking at the time slowly trickling by, Ye Yuan’s heart was burning with anxiety.

It was already too late to break through now. He could only refine the Myriad Realms Mountain first to have the strength to protect himself.

“Could it be that … I’ve missed some places?” Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed even harder.

During these seven years, Ye Yuan seemed to have no end, searching for his kin and friends frantically.

But, after two years of nothing, it forced him to stop and think carefully.

Suddenly, a thought flashed across in Ye Yuan’s mind, making his entire body tremble.

“Heavenspan … World!”

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan’s body instantly disappeared from where he was, urging his speed to the extreme, heading for the Heavenspan World.

Reaching Ye Yuan’s present realm, his divine sense could instantly cover a world.

This world was not just small chiliocosms. There were also the various subsidiary small worlds of small chiliocosms.

As long as Ye Yuan was willing, he could infiltrate his divine sense into all of the subsidiary small worlds.

For the past seven years, he had indeed done so.

But there was only one place that he did not search; that was the Heavenspan World!

Ye Yuan followed the main force into the Heavenspan World and started searching right away, but he did not search the small worlds that were subsidiary to the Heavenspan World.

Yan Jadetrue’s appearance interrupted his search. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Later on, Ye Yuan immediately ran into Yan Jadetrue after he came out of Heaven Fragmented Continent.

When the two people’s wager began, Ye Yuan instinctively went straight to traverse the planes, but he forgot that it was dark under the lamp.

Thinking about it now, the timing that Yan Jadetrue appeared back then was just right. It was simply to interrupt his search.

Ye Yuan searched myriad worlds, but he only missed his own hometown!

This guy was so deeply scheming!

“Damn it! Li-er must be in the Immortal Grove World. Why didn’t I think of it earlier! I wonder whether I can make it in time or not!”

The current Ye Yuan was erupting across the board, urging his speed to the extreme.

He was too far away from the Heavenspan World. With his current speed, it would also take half a year to rush back at full speed!

… …

And at the same time, in a secret place in Inklight Forest, Yan Jadetrue’s breakthrough also reached the most critical time!

However, Frivolous Life Like a Dream’s sudden eruption made Yan Jadetrue simmer with hatred.

After he finished absorbing the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation, he entered a state of emptiness without any surprises. He grasped the opportunity to break through to True Sovereign Heaven.

But right at this time, Frivolous Life Akin to a Dream suddenly erupted, going into ecstasy!

Such a toxic poison erupting at the juncture of breakthrough, the degree of danger could be imagined.

He almost perished, his Dao dissipating!

“Damn it! I still fell for that brat’s trick in the end! However, do you think that you can ruin this exalt like this? Too naive! At most another three months, after this exalt breaks through to True Sovereign Heaven, I’ll kill your beloved! At that time, this exalt wants to see how you’re overwhelmed to the extent where you wished that you were dead!

Yan Jadetrue was currently anguished to the extreme. The breakthrough of True Sovereign Heaven was extremely dangerous. Coupled with the Frivolous Life Like a Dream poison, Yan Jadetrue did not dare to be distracted by other things right now.

Otherwise, he would have long urged his origin divinity and killed Yue Mengli.

At this very moment, he could only endure the bone-festering pain of the origin divinity and forcefully break through to True Sovereign Heaven!

Yan Jadetrue was someone of incredible willpower too. If someone else was poisoned and it erupted at the critical moment of breakthrough, they would have long kicked the bucket.

But he forcefully pulled through.

At this time, Yan Jadetrue already reached the final juncture of breakthrough and was only one step away.

At this time, there mustn’t be any mishaps.

… …

In the spatial turbulent flow, Ye Yuan stuffed heavenly pills into his mouth like it was free.

His heart was burning with anxiety, only thinking of returning to the Heavenspan World as quickly as possible.

But his speed was already urged to the extreme and could not go any faster!

“No way. It’s still too slow!”

Ye Yuan did not know when Yan Jadetrue would break through, but the later he went, the higher the chances Li-er would be in danger.

Therefore, he had to be faster!

Boom!

In the next moment, the divine essence within Ye Yuan’s body started burning crazily.

His speed also accelerated by a lot in an instant!

“Not enough! Still not enough!”

Boom!

Ye Yuan started burning his bloodline power, and at the same time, his speed soared again!

“Boy, are you crazy? Pushing on like this, by the time you reach the Heavenspan World, you’ll be totally crippled!” Mi Tian shouted frantically in Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness.

Burning divine essence and bloodline power at the same time was extremely harmful to the body.

If it was a short period, it was still fine. But Ye Yuan had to travel for half a year. This kind of loss was virtually irreversible.

A single mishap and it would ruin the martial arts foundation, cutting off the path forward.

Ye Yuan ignored Mi Tian and threw the heavenly pills that he refined previously into his mouth frenziedly.

However, under this crazy move, his speed was virtually several times faster than normal!

Time slowly passed. The heavenly pills on Ye Yuan were depleted very quickly.

However, he did not stop, throwing the natural treasures that he found in the Labyrinth Divine Palace into his mouth as if they were unlimited in number.

Just like that, he kept maintaining the limit speed and rushed in the direction of the Heavenspan World.

Finally, he saw the Heavenspan World’s boundary wall.

At the same time, the sky above Inklight Forest, the phenomenon of a moon that had been going berserk for a month finally subsided.

“ARGHHHH!?Damn Ye Yuan, you caused this exalt to be unable to break through to True Sovereign Heaven. This exalt wants you to grieve to the extent that you wished to die! You definitely didn’t think that this exalt hid your beloved right under your eyelids, right??Hahaha?… Go and die for me!”

Yan Jadetrue fell completely into a berserk rage and activated the origin divinity mark immediately, wanting to kill Yue Mengli.

“Mn??This … How is this possible? It was clearly still there just now!” Yan Jadetrue’s pupils constricted, disbelief written all over his face.
