Chapter 1473 Three Kneels of Gratitude!

On the city wall, several tens of thousands of soldiers looked up at the gate tower; extremely grand.

Guo Changmin surveyed the surroundings and said in a clear voice, “In this battle, the officers and men used their lives to repel an enemy several times the size! This general is proud of you all!”

“Great General is mighty!”

“Great General is mighty!”

“Great General is mighty!”

All the officers and men shouted in unison, the sound shaking the sky.

One could tell that each and every one of them was very agitated, including Guo Changmin.

In this battle, life and death hung by a thread. Just one step off and it was the outcome of the city being destroyed and people dying.

Guo Changmin smiled and said, “It’s you all who are mighty, my children! From tomorrow onwards, the three armies will be rewarded according to their merits! However, the greatest hero who has rendered a great service in this battle is precisely the one standing beside me at this time! Perhaps many of you don’t know him, but you all have to know that he was the first one to discover the fiend race invading from Fiend Calling Ridge. It was also him who brought over Kangding City’s reinforcements, only then did it turn back the raging tides! He is called Ling Feng!”

Beside Guo Changmin, Ling Feng seemed somewhat uneasy and out of place.

This scene of having tens of thousands fix their eyes on him, he was still not quite used to it.

“Your Excellency, this officer dare not take credit! The greatest meritorious hero in this battle isn’t me!” Ling Feng suddenly plucked up his courage and said.

Guo Changmin even thought that Ling Feng was being modest, patted his shoulder, and said with a laugh, “Huhu, if it’s your credit, it’s yours, nobody can snatch it away! If not for you sending people to bring back news, the northern city would have long been breached. Even this general would also have to be buried within the army! To a certain extent, you defended the myriad of territories behind us!”

When Ling Feng saw that Guo Changmin said it so solemnly, he was even more terrified and hurriedly said, “Your Excellency, this battle really isn’t this officer’s credit! But ... But somebody else’s! If not for him, our squad would have been annihilated at Fiend Calling Ridge back then, and it would have been totally impossible to come back and report.”

Guo Changmin had a look of surprise on his face when he heard that and said, “Somebody else? Who is it?”

Ling Feng said, “He’s called Ye Yuan, just a human who passed by Fiend Calling Ridge ...”

Ling Feng rattled on tirelessly about the events that happened in this period of time, making everyone draw cold breaths continuously.

Annihilating the fiend squads, falling down the cliff and not dying, cutting off the fiend race’s path of retreat. This series of actions, it sounded like a myth or legend to everyone.

“I originally thought that it was a human expert who saved us in secret. But later, the more I thought, the more off it was! Most likely, the person who insta-killed five fiend captains back then was Ye Yuan! Furthermore, when I left, I thought that it was completely too late to request for reinforcements. But he told me in all sincerity and solemness that the reinforcements can definitely make it in time!” Ling Feng also said his own guesses.

Guo Changmin was still perplexed previously; why did the fiend race’s army of 100 thousand become 30 thousand?

But only when he heard Ling Feng say so did he have a sudden realization.

At this time, Wang Yifeng suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Your Excellency, with Ling Feng saying so, I also feel that it’s very strange! Actually, the first day that the fiends besieged the northern city, the battle situation was already very critical. They leaped up the city walls several times, but those fiend soldiers were all feeble and soft; one chop and they were down! Because of this, that’s how we defended for several days! Later, Xiu Lie launched the assault, those commanders already rushed up to the top of the city walls. But the back of their army seemed to have had a disturbance, and that’s how they didn’t take advantage of the situation to enter the battle!”

Ling Feng also said, “I saw the destroyed fiend crossbows at the back of the fiend army. The back of the army also had quite a number of people dead, but I didn’t see one Tiderain City defending troops!”

The more these two people talked, the more alarmed Guo Changmin got.

All of this sounded like an Arabian night tale, but the result of the events developing to this point was also so reasonable.

However, a Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artist dictated a war of several hundred thousand?

This ... was a little too exaggerated, right?

“Just what kind of person is this Ye Yuan? Are these things really what one person can do?”

“This is simply producing clouds with a turn of one’s hands, and rain with another! He alone dominated a war! This kind of thing, even Lord Guo Changmin can’t do it!”

“This Ye Yuan must have been sent by heaven to save us!”

“Ling Feng said that Ye Yuan was only Heaven Glimpse Realm, could it be that he slaughtered into the back of the fiend army alone? Does this guy ... have three heads and six arms?”

...

The officers and men were all shocked until they could not close their mouths, speculating one after another about this behind-the-scenes hero who had never been seen, but he saved all of them.

Guo Changmin drew a deep breath and said, “Ling Feng, not that this general doesn’t believe you, but it’s true that the things you said are too inconceivable! Since that little friend Ye had the intention of joining the army, I wonder where he is now?”

Ling Feng smiled bitterly and said, “After the great battle ended, I kept looking for him too, but I couldn’t find him at all.”

Just as everyone was at a loss on what to do, a thunderous voice sounded out above the city’s sky.

“The hero has already gone, all give three kneels of gratitude toward the east!”

The voice was not loud, but it was like rolling thunder, transmitting into everyone’s ears.

“Who?! Who is talking?!”

“The hero has gone? It’s saying that Ye Yuan left?”

“Toward the east? Isn’t that in the direction of Fiend Calling Ridge? Why did he go over?”

“Are you dumb? Didn’t Ling Feng say it, that the hero can move freely above the natural chasm! No, wait, he ... he went to the fiend race?”

Suddenly, everyone’s faces changed, realizing this problem.

To the humans, the fiend race territory was equivalent to a forbidden land. No one dared to go over at all.

But Guo Changmin’s expression changed and he gave a bow toward the sky and said, “We obey Lord Ze Yan’s dharmic decree!”

“Lord Ze Yan? Who is Lord Ze Yan?”

“I heard that there’s a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse stationed in Tiderain City, but I never see him before!”

“Could it be that ... Tiderain City really has a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse?”

“If there’s a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, why didn’t he take action when our casualties are so heavy?”

“Yeah! We were almost completely wiped out, didn’t see the Divine Lord Realm powerhouse make a move too!”

...

This voice immediately aroused a flurry of discussion.

Legends had it that Tiderain City had a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse defending.

It was just that after that battle, nobody saw the Divine Lord Realm powerhouse anymore as well.

In the course of time, it became a legend too.

Of course, quite a few people were also indignant in their hearts. Why didn’t the Divine Lord Realm powerhouse make a move when the great battle was fought to this kind of degree?

Guo Changmin’s expression darkened. Mustering up divine essence, he said in a solemn voice, “All shut up for me!”

His prestige in the army was exceedingly high. With this roar, those soldiers immediately became silent like cicadas in winter, but their faces still had indignant looks.

Guo Changmin swept a glance over everyone and said in a solemn voice, “Tiderain City indeed has Lord Ze Yan, a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse garrisoning here! Could it be that you all think that there isn’t a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse in the fiend race army? Do you all know what it means for Divine Lord Realm powerhouses to take action? It means that none of you guys can survive! If Tiderain City perishes, Lord Ze Yang will also survive or die together with Tiderain City!”

Guo Changmin’s rolling thunder-like voice finally made the soldiers become quiet.

“Now, obey Lord Ze Yan’s dharmic decree! All officers and men listen to the order, give ... three kowtows to the east!” Guo Changmin said in a clear voice.

Thud!

Finished talking, Guo Changmin knelt down first.
