Chapter 2187: Forgot to Tell You

“Seal!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry and sent out a force, directly sealing the devil monster leader’s tarnished black devil crystal.

Quicker than words could tell.

This series of actions did not even reach a breath of time.

Finishing with all these, Time Freeze suddenly shattered.

Everything returned to normal.

The few great Empyreans used eyes like having seen a ghost to stare fixedly at Ye Yuan.

This guy actually froze all of them just now!

Although it was just a short instant, they were really unable to do anything during that moment!

“This ... This guy can actually control spacetime? What was that just now? Heavenly Dao True Word?” Li Yue looked at Ye Yuan, his eyes full of shock.

Although Ye Yuan’s golden needles piercing the acupoints turned the battle situation around, the unhappiness in Li Yue’s heart was not dispelled.

He knew what Ye Yuan wanted to do, but the unhappiness from before turned into a wicked mentality during that moment.

He wanted to kill this devil monster leader and sever Ye Yuan’s hope!

But Ye Yuan used this sort of bizarre way to save the devil monster leader.

How could this not surprise him?

How many methods did this brat have?

Done with all this, Ye Yuan turned around, seething with killing intent.

Li Yue’s way of doing things already touched his bottom line!

“Don’t you forget, after the golden needles pierced your acupoints, there will be a period of extreme weakness! At that time, your life and death will be dictated by me!”

Ye Yuan’s words were bone-piercingly cold.

Li Yue’s expression changed drastically. He only cared about venting his anger earlier, why would he think so much?

Currently, upon Ye Yuan’s reminder, only then did Li Yue suddenly startled awake.

Those golden needles indeed let him obtain powerful strength, but what about after tiding over the immediate crisis?

Suddenly, Li Yue’s two eyes narrowed and he said with a hideous grin, “So what? This Empyrean hasn’t passed the powerful period yet currently!”

Zheng Yufeng’s gaze turned cold, and he said in a solemn voice, “Li Yue, do you still want face? If not for Ye Yuan, we’d probably have long been killed by these abyss monsters now! You actually want to repay kindness with ingratitude now!”

Li Yue smiled coldly and said, “So what? This punk is so unbelievably cocky! This Empyrean has long been displeased at the sight of him! Now, the crisis has already been resolved. We also roughly understand the situation here already and can go back and report on the completion of the mission. This brat doesn’t have much use anymore as well!”

Zheng Yufeng’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Have you asked me about wanting to kill Ye Yuan? Or is it that you think that everybody will look on with folded arms?”

Li Yue chuckled and suddenly made a move.

A large number of umbrellas flew towards the sky, instantly enveloping the few powerhouses in the vicinity fully.

Zheng Yufeng’s face changed and he cried out in shock, “Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella! You actually even brought this out!”

Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella was a peak empyrean spirit treasure of the Clearwater Bodhidharma that Li Yue was from.

Or should it be said that it was a quasi-heavenly emperor spirit treasure!

This spirit treasure had a resounding reputation within the seven major factions’ sphere of influence.

It was because this empyrean spirit treasure could absorb the divine essence of the martial artists within a certain radius, and then supplement it onto themselves.

This was equivalent to reducing the opponent’s strength when fighting and increasing one’s own strength.

If it was under the situation where their strengths were on par, this empyrean spirit treasure would be a trump card!

And this empyrean spirit treasure was most formidable during group battles.

Like now!

At this time, everyone only felt that a portion of the divine essence in their bodies was instantly drained.

While Li Yue’s aura was in the midst of soaring madly.

Finally, he actually stepped into Seventh Firmament Empyrean!

Although this was just temporary, he truly possessed the strength of Seventh Firmament Empyrean right now!

“Hahaha ... now, is there still anyone that wants to come out and protect this brat?” Li Yue looked like a cat that ate the canary, letting out a wild laugh.

How could the others still be Li Yue’s match after having a significant amount of divine essence drained? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Even Zheng Yufeng also shut his mouth sensibly.

Speaking at this time was equivalent to seeking death!

He could not help looking toward Ye Yuan, having a worried look on his face.

Just earlier, a stream of strange power circled one round inside Ye Yuan’s body, attempting to draw out his divine essence.

But this force actually could not extract Ye Yuan’s chaos divine essence.

In the end, it returned without accomplishing anything.

Ye Yuan looked at Li Yue expressionlessly and said coolly, “This empyrean spirit treasure is pretty good. I’ll be accepting it.”

Li Yue narrowed his eyes, a cold light shining as he said in a cold voice, “Reckless and blind thing! Is your reliance that Heavenly Dao True Word? With my present strength, you can at most only freeze time for that instance! Even if I stand there and let you hit, what can you do to me? But how many times can you use this martial technique?”

Seventh Firmament Empyrean versus Second Firmament Empyrean, the disparity in-between was a massive chasm.

Even if Ye Yuan’s combat strength was astonishing, it was also very hard to kill Li Yue in an instant.

Hence, he had nothing to fear!

Ye Yuan’s eyelids raised slightly, and he said coolly, “If you keep spurting nonsense, the golden needles piercing acupoints method will time out!”

Li Yue could not help choking when he heard that and said in a solemn voice, “Courting death!”

Under his rage, Li Yue exerted all of his strength. The tremendous power of Seventh Firmament Empyrean made the faces of everyone present change drastically.

Sixth Firmament Empyrean to Seventh Firmament Empyrean, this was a massive gulf.

Now, Li Yue crossed this gulf, how many times did his strength increase?

More importantly, Li Yue was still under the effect of the golden needles right now, his strength terrifying to the extreme!

“Crimsonmoon Azurelight Sword!”

One sword emerging, countless streaks of azure lights were akin to dense rain, stabbing at the place where Ye Yuan was at.

Unavoidable!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

After a bout of indiscriminate bombardment, a large pit was blasted out at the place where Ye Yuan was standing at.

Even the void had several cracks blasted out, while Ye Yuan vanished without a trace.

Li Yue chuckled and said, “So what even if you have a lot of measures? So what if you know the golden needle piercing acupoints method? Didn’t you still die at this Empyrean’s hands?”

“This move is lacking in power! Just a reminder, the duration of the effect doesn’t have long remaining.” A leisurely void sounded out behind everyone.

Everyone turned around, but saw that Ye Yuan was currently standing on top of a tree; very cozy.

While his body did not have any injury at all.

Li Yue’s pupils constricted and he looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief as he gritted his teeth and said, “Impossible! My Crimsonmoon Azurelight Sword even locked space down! How did you escape?”

Ye Yuan was still expressionless as he said, “Uh, forgot to tell you. My spatial law is already comprehended to the peak Sixth Firmament. I’m afraid that it’s a little hard for your degree of attack to want to harm me.”

Li Yue’s entire body trembled, his eyeballs almost popping out.

Spatial law comprehended to peak Sixth Firmament, what kind of concept was this?

Beneath Heavenly Emperor, it was far too difficult to want to kill Ye Yuan!

Unless one planned things beforehand, like Long Xiao, locking down all space.

Otherwise, there was basically no hope!

But now, where would Li Yue go and make arrangements?

A despairing mood instantly spread throughout Li Yue’s entire body.

Could not kill Ye Yuan, then there was only waiting for Ye Yuan to come and kill him!

Thud!

Li Yue actually knelt down toward Ye Yuan involuntarily.

“B-Brother Ye, I ... I, Li Yue, had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai! S-spare me!”
