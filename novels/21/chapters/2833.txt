Chapter 2839: A Formidable Master had no Incompetent Disciple!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Done posturing, Cloudmount looked at the Ye Yuan with a shocked expression, secretly taking delight in it.

Who asked you to scare Your Father just now? Now, Your Father will intimidate you too!

Having a bit of ability, do you really think nothing of others?

Really think that chaos heavenly masters were to be trifled with?

Above grade nine heavenly alchemist was chaos heavenly master!

Missing the word ‘alchemist,’ the terror of Hegemon Realm heavenly alchemists could be seen.

Reaching Hegemon Realm, developing Great Dao was at their fingertips, already breaking away from the domain of medicine.

Up in the heavens and down below the earth, nothing could not be refined!

To chaos heavenly masters, they could even forcefully refine their opponents, their strength terrifying to the extreme.

However, Hegemon Cloudmount felt incredibly guilty.

This move looked incredible, but it was somewhat taxing to this clone.

In order to suppress Ye Yuan, he really exerted all of his strength.

“Brat, are you convinced?” Cloudmount said coolly.

Only then did Ye Yuan come back to his senses and look toward Cloudmount with a look of shock.

It turned out that heavenly alchemists could reach such a transcendent realm!

Hegemon Cloudmount’s Dao elucidation was already on a totally different level from Ye Yuan.

This was like answering a question. Ye Yuan just answered it in a routine manner, but not only did Cloudmount answer it, but he also expanded on it and eventually turned it into an extremely perfect and complete major topic!

It was worlds apart!

In Alchemy Dao, Ye Yuan had always thought that he did not lose to anyone. But this time, he was really convinced.

The disparity was too great!

“Kid, your talent is pretty good. Maybe one day, you’ll really be able to reach this seat’s realm! But Alchemy Dao is infinite. With someone giving you guidance on the path ahead, you can take many less detours; isn’t that so?” Hegemon Cloudmount said coolly.

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath but arrived before Zuo Chen and kowtowed three times respectfully, saying sincerely, “One day as master, a master for life! From now on, you’re still my, Ye Yuan’s, master!”

Ye Yuan had never acknowledged a master in alchemy before.

Once acknowledged, Ye Yuan naturally would not kick him to the curb after he outlived his usefulness too.

There was no real master-disciple relation between him and Zuo Chen, but there was the name of master and disciple.

Now, he was going to acknowledge Cloudmount as his master, but he had to make Zuo Chen call him grandmaster. That was not what a man would do.

Zuo Chen’s face was full of emotion, and he said with a nod, “Boy, with this sentence from you, it’s enough!”

Witnessing Ye Yuan’s talent and strength, Zuo Chen naturally would not be haughty anymore.

Accepting Ye Yuan as a disciple was not Ye Yuan making a profit, but him profiting!

Seeing this scene, Hegemon Cloudmount did not stop it but was slightly moved in his heart.

Looking at it now, the reason why Ye Yuan kept rejecting it before, it was not brushing him off.

His misgivings toward Zuo Chen probably accounted for a large part of it.

This boy’s character and disposition was all the best choice!

Hegemon Cloudmount’s appraisal of Ye Yuan went up a few more points.

Only after finishing kowtowing to Zuo Chen did Ye Yuan arrive in front of Hegemon Cloudmount and kowtowed three times again, saying, “Disciple Ye Yuan pays respect to master!”

“Haha, good! Good disciple! With this seat accepting a disciple, I normally would inform the world and all the heavens to come and congratulate! However, present circumstances differ from before. For the sake of your safety, we need to keep a low profile! The blood race has many powerhouses lurking

within the Absolute Heaven Barrier. If they find out about your identity, they will definitely come and kill you at any cost! Therefore, you also have to be careful yourself. Understand?” Hegemon Cloudmount said.

Ye Yuan nodded, indicating that he understood.

Hegemon Cloudmount continued, “Since Master accepted you as a disciple, I naturally have to gift you a greeting gift. You’re about to enter profound grade soon. This seat will demonstrate to you what’s profound grade. This way, it will be much easier for you to break through!”

Finished saying, Hegemon Cloudmount flicked his sleeves grandly and started refining the Unadorned Golden Lotus.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted. Did chaos heavenly masters all refine heavenly medicines like this?

But very soon, he converged his mind and placed his mind and body on the Unadorned Golden Lotus.

Only to see the Unadorned Golden Lotus gradually transform, turning into a heavenly pill!

An incredibly profound aura flowed around the heavenly pill.

Ye Yuan’s eyes became brighter and brighter.

He seemed to have grasped something but failed to grasp it at the same time.

It was seemingly like a castle in the sky.

He felt that this layer of windowpane paper had already been poked through!

Of course, he had not broken through yet.

However, he could already see what was profound grade through that tiny gap.

His refinement was not carried out randomly but with a definite target in mind.

He went in the direction of Ye Yuan’s Dao elucidation, slowly guiding, letting Ye Yuan cross this river himself.

He did not impose anything on Ye Yuan. He just acted in accordance with the flow.

What Ye Yuan was walking was his own Dao. It had nothing to do with him.

Very soon, an ordinary, but also not-ordinary heavenly pill appeared before Ye Yuan.

“Understood?” Cloudmount said.

“Understood!” Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said.

“Understood what?”

“Profound grade is also Dao! However, it’s just an extension of Dao! The water will flow naturally when the channel forms!”

Ahint of a proud smile flashed across Cloudmount’s face.

This boy was too monstrous!

To ordinary heavenly alchemists, the divine ability that he displayed where there was nothing in the world that could not be refined, it was absolutely shocking!

This kind of divine skill was exclusive to chaos heavenly masters!

Ordinary people would definitely be immersed in it.

Didn’t you see that at the side, Zuo Chen was still immersed in it, unable to extricate himself?

But Ye Yuan did not!

This boy’s heart was like a clear mirror. He was too clear about what he wanted!

Although Ye Yuan was also shocked at his means, he placed all of his focus on profound grade.

‘Therefore, Ye Yuan really understood!

He understood what profound grade was.

As for breaking through, that was merely something that would happen naturally without extra effort.

After Ye Yuan went to the Extreme Medicine Sect and entered the Scripture Library, he would probably be able to break through before long.

If not for his guidance, Ye Yuan would probably have to study for more than ten years in the Scripture Library before he could puncture this layer of windowpane paper!

Perhaps even longer!

‘True grade to profound grade was far too difficult!

Many Emperor Realm heavenly alchemists could not attain it yet, let alone Ye Yuan this Saint Sovereign Heaven.

It was not that if you reached the bottleneck, you would be able to break through very soon.

Breaking through in ten years, Ye Yuan was already a monster among monsters.

Many Emperor Realms were stuck at this hurdle for thousands of years!

Of course, Ye Yuan was also extremely shocked in his heart.

Acknowledging this master was the right call!

This Hegemon Cloudmount was absolutely an expert in teaching disciples!

That guidance just now could not be done just because one’s realm was high.

Ahigh realm and teaching disciples were two completely different things.

Some people’s realms were extremely high. But the disciples under them were each lousier than the last.

Some people’s realms were not high. But they could have disciples spread all over the world.

Knowing how to teach and not knowing how to teach, the difference was too great.

Hegemon Cloudmount’s cultivation realm was not only incredibly high, but he also had the knack for teaching disciples too. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

No wonder he could bring up Zhou Pinespring, this chaos heavenly master!

A bout of casual giving pointers saved him decades of hard work. This was not what the average person could do.

“Alright, this is settled. This seat will be heading back too. The southern front’s war is too tense. Master’s clone can’t leave for too long. You go to the Extreme Medicine Sect First and enter the Extreme Light Pavilion. Over there, Pinespring has already arranged things for you. The remaining road, you can

just walk on your own! After you come to the Absolute Heaven Barrier, this seat will give you more pointers.”

Ye Yuan was touched in his heart. Hegemon Cloudmount could be said to have taken an extraordinary risk for him.

With his clone leaving during the war, it was equivalent to diminishing one’s own strength.

Once he really encountered a formidable enemy, it would be very easy to get injured.

“Many thanks, Master Cloudmount!” Ye Yuan said sincerely.

Hegemon Cloudmount smiled and said, “You, boy, didn’t let Master down! This trip wasn’t in vain!

After he was done talking, Hegemon Cloudmount’s figure swayed, and he disappeared.

Ye Yuan pushed Zuo Chen, Zuo Chen abruptly startled awake and said blankly, “Ancestor Cloudmount he … left?”

Ye Yuan gave him a look and said crossly, “Stop thinking! Immersing in it will damage your Dao heart!”

Zuo Chen was suddenly shocked!
