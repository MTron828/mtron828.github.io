Chapter 970: Escaping Through the Void

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Alright, I’ll help them undo the Secret Illusion Heavenly Realm!”

Although extremely unwilling, the current situation already did not allow the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil to carry on biting the bullet.

Compared to 100 thousand over years of cultivation being reduced to nothing, undoing the Secret Illusion Heavenly Realm did not seem to be much.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil also perceived that Ye Yuan seemed to have the intention of sparing his life. Looks like he wanted to obtain something from him.

In the days to come, think of ways to dance around with Ye Yuan would do.

Ye Yuan released Yue Mengli, Yue Lingyu, and the rest. The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil said, “I’ve already fused into becoming one with you. Casting the spell requires borrowing your pair of eyes!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and handed control of his pair of eyes to the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil.

This current sort of situation, the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil was already assimilating inside Ye Yuan’s body. It was just that the authority to pilot was entirely Ye Yuan’s.

As long as Ye Yuan was not willing, the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil was not able to utilize his pair of eyes at all.

Ye Yuan only felt his two eyes heat up. A strange power flowed out from within his two eyes. Yue Mengli, Yue Lingyu and the rest suddenly startled awake.

“Big Brother Yuan, I even thought that ... I’d never see you again! This illusionary art is so formidable. I clearly know that I got caught in an illusionary realm, but I wasn’t able to break free.”

Even with Yue Mengli’s composure, she was also filled with lingering fear after almost being caught in the illusionary realm forever.

Yue Lingyu was similarly still badly shaken. She did not think that with her strength, she would also be caught inside the illusionary realm so easily.

Ye Yuan lightly embraced Yue Mengli and consoled, “Alright, everything is over. With Big Brother Yuan around, it will be fine.”

Yue Mengli nodded her head but hugged Ye Yuan even tighter.

“Ye Yuan, w-was it you who saved us?” Yue Lingyu said rather hesitantly.

Although she already had an answer in her heart, she still felt that it was inconceivable.

Ye Yuan only had Phaseless Realm strength but was the only clear-headed one among them. This was too bizarre.

Furthermore, Yue Lingyu discovered that Ye Yuan actually already broke through to middle-stage Phaseless Realm at who knows when!

They all, these Divine King experts, were all neck-deep in trouble, but Ye Yuan obtained a lucky chance here, breaking through two minor realms consecutively. This was simply inconceivable.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Could it be that there are still other people here?”

Yue Lingyu drew a deep breath and asked again, “The one who made us fall into the illusionary realm should be the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil, right? Now that we woke up, could it be ...” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When asking this question, Yue Lingyu could not help having the jitters.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil which had not come into being for 100 thousand years, could it have been obtained by Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan smiled but did not speak and had an inscrutable look.

Yue Lingyu could not help choking up, also aware that she was rather rash. This sort of thing, nobody would easily admit it.

Ye Yuan did not say, Yue Lingyu could not very well press too hard either.

Some things, when pointed out, would affect the situation as a whole instead.

The Zhou and Yue two families viewed the Vastsun Bright Moon Realm as their private property. Once they knew that the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil was obtained by Ye Yuan, it probably would not end well.

At that time, it probably could not dispense with a bloody storm.

Putting aside the Yue Family’s and Ye Yuan’s relationship, once they lost all decorum, the one who would be hurt the deepest would definitely be Yue Mengli.

Even if the Yue Family obtained the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil in the end, a war between the Yue Family and Zhou Family was likely unavoidable as well.

At that time, it would probably be hard for these two great Rank One Holy Lands to maintain their present glory.

In comparison, the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil being placed with Ye Yuan seemed to be a better option.

At least, with his relationship with Li-er, he would definitely stand on the Yue Family’s side.

In an instant, Yue Lingyu’s mind flashed like lightning and thought of a great deal of things. She still decided to bury this secret at the bottom of her heart.

“Oh, right, where’s that Han Tong?” Yue Mengli suddenly said.

Hearing this, Yue Lingyu could not help secretly sighing in her heart. Indeed, women leaned outward. Yue Mengli was deliberately changing the topic here. She was clearly leaning towards Ye Yuan.

But the moment she thought of Yue Mengli, Yue Lingyu was still greatly gratified in her heart.

The Innate Battle Soul Physique might not be inferior to the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil! If she could cultivate to major accomplishment, she would likewise be the Divine Realm’s pinnacle-most expert.

Seemed like this was the best conclusion.

“Han Tong is already dead. His Spirithorn Shattering Mirror is over there. I’ll go to take and then bring it over,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Yue Lingyu was startled inwardly. Han Tong cracked her Mountain & River State Painting with one blow when he wielded the Spirithorn Shattering Mirror.

But now, he was actually dead!

Who killed him? Could it be ... Ye Yuan?

Seemed like apart from this, there were no other possibilities!

Just how on earth did this boy accomplish it?

Yue Lingyu discovered that she could not see through Ye Yuan more and more. This boy was too shrouded in mystery.

Ye Yuan picked up the Spirithorn Shattering Mirror and started playing with it in his hands.

Right at this time, a terrifying aura transmitted out from the Spirithorn Shattering Mirror.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he flung the mirror out. At the same time, he took out the Heavenly King Bell without the slightest hesitation.

Rumble!

A terrifying energy slammed onto the Heavenly King Bell, directly blasting Ye Yuan out.

“Puhwark ...”

Ye Yuan immediately spewed out a large mouthful of blood, already sustaining very serious injuries.

While the Spirithorn Shattering Mirror actually took advantage of this time and shattered the void, and escaped immediately.

Yue Mengli was taken aback by this unexpected change and hurriedly went forward to support Yue Mengli, and said worriedly, “Big Brother Yuan, are ... you alright?”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said weakly, “I didn’t expect that there was actually still such a powerful restrictive force on this Spirithorn Shattering Mirror! Looks like its true owner’s strength is unfathomable! I’m rather curious now, just what kind of existence is this Divine Martial Hall? Also, what is their objective!”

Since Lin Chao appeared within the Divine Martial Hall, this faction, then the Endless World’s matters definitely could not get away from them.

Now, they came to have designs on the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil again.

Seems like they were planning some major moves.

An hour later, Ye Yuan finished recuperating and finally recovered some essence energy.

The few people were currently walking when they suddenly discovered some people.

Ruan Shuangzhou, Zhou Boping, Zhou Yan, and the rest were all scattered at the foot of the main peak.

Falling down from the top of the main peak was nothing much to them. But the tremors of the divine artifact great battle previously made them suffer considerable injuries.

It was just that currently, they could not feel the pain on their bodies at all, because they were still inside the illusionary realm.

“They actually haven’t died yet! Their lives are really tenacious!” Ye Yuan said speechlessly.

He even thought that these few people were dead for sure.So he did not expect that their bodies actually still had an aura of living.

Where the aftershocks of a divine artifact battle could be sent to, nobody could control it either. A single mishap and it was the outcome of having one’s body pounded to pieces and bones ground to powder.

But these few people’s lives were actually so tenacious.

“Ye Yuan, Zhou Boping had also put forth considerable effort this time. Could you ... save him?” Yue Lingyu suddenly said.

Ye Yuan did not reply right away, but looked at Yue Mengli and asked, “Li-er, what’s your opinion?”
