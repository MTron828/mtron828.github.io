1596 Astounding the World With a Single Brilliant Fea

Everyone revealed incredibly shocked expressions, looking over towards that middle-aged man.

“It’s the Ning Family’s elder, Ning Lixiao! My God, he directly raised the bid by 500 million!”

“Does the Ning Family want to give a plum in return for a peach here, establishing a relationship with Elder Ye?”

“2 billion to buy a rank three divine pill, crazy! Really crazy!”

...

Shi Song clearly also did not expect that someone would throw a wrench into the works. He looked at Ning Lixiao rather surprisedly.

Shi Song gritted his teeth and said, “2.1 billion!”

“2.5 billion!” Ning Lixiao did not bat an eyelid and added 400 million very indifferently.

Shi Song’s expression changed and he said to Ning Lixiao in a solemn voice, “Ning Lixiao, are you mad? Raising the price like this has no benefits to anyone!”

Ning Lixiao said coolly, “Since I bid the price, it’s naturally worth this price! Shi Zhiyong needs it, Tianping similarly needs it. Enough crap, the one with the higher price gets it!”

Shi Song’s face flickered incessantly and he gritted his teeth and said, “2.6 billion! Ning Lixiao, if you have the capabilities, offer until 3 billion!”

Ning Lixiao gave him a glance and slowly opened his mouth to say: “3.5 billion!”

“Hiss ...”

Everyone all drew a cold breath. They had long expected that this Vastsun Universe Pill would be very expensive, but they did not think that it was actually expensive to such an extent!

For the price of 3.5 billion, one could even purchase some defective divine lord mystic treasure already.

However, it was just a rank three divine pill!

Shi Song’s expression changed several times and he said very unhappily, “Ning Lixoa, consider yourself ruthless! Here, this Vastsun Universe Pill is your Ning Family’s!”

Ning Lixiao clasped his hands and said with a smile, “Brother Shi Song, thanks for giving way.”

“3.5 billion! The Ning Family bids a price of 3.5 billion, is there any higher price?”

Deacon Zhang paused for a bit, his gaze sweeping over the crowd, and then he followed up and said “3.5 billion once! 3.5 billion twice! 3.5 billion thrice! Done! Congratulations to the Ning Family for obtaining Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s historical first void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill!”

A final gong decided it!

Everyone all started dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape, not quite daring to believe this price.

There had never been a rank three divine pill that could sell at a sky-high price of 3.5 billion.

They even somewhat felt that the Ning Family was taken advantage of this time.

Even though this medicinal pill was one in a million, the price of 3.5 billion still made them feel that it was not worth it.

However, Ning Lixiao clearly did not have this awareness.

After receiving the medicinal pill, he found Ye Yuan and clasped his hands as he said with a smile, “Elder Ye, these few days, Siyu this lass was under your care. I represent the Ning Family to owe you a debt of endless gratitude.”

Ning Lixiao was very smart. Even though he bought the medicinal pill with 3.5 billion, he did not have the intention of using it to show his favor.

It was as if this medicinal pill was really worth 3.5 billion.

Instead, he came to find Ye Yuan to express thanks for Ning Siyu’s matters.

In reality, the Ning Family attached great importance to Ning Siyu.

The Ning Family had very powerful strength in the Martial Tower, but their influence on the Pill Tower’s side was virtually zero.

It was not surprising. Grooming an alchemy genius was much harder than grooming a martial arts genius.

But what made the Ning Family have a headache was that Ning Siyu had always been lazy and made no effort to seek progress previously. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But today, the Ning Family saw a Ning Siyu who underwent a complete change, this made them overjoyed.

At this point, who still dared to doubt whether or not Ning Siyu was taught by Ye Yuan?

Apart from Ye Yuan, who could still make Ning Siyu have such a big change within such a short time?

Furthermore, the terrifying talent displayed by this young man in front of them was absolutely worth the Ning Family to make friends.

Although 3.5 billion was a little expensive, this money was worth it!

Ye Yuan understood in his heart and also smiled and said, “This lass’ talent is pretty good. If it was a piece of rotten wood, I can’t polish it either.”

Ning Lixiao chuckled and said, “What Elder Ye said is true. You aren’t aware, Siyu this girl prides on that her talent surpasses others and is fond of playing and being willful, making our Ning Family worry our heads off, all the way until she met Elder Ye! Now, she finally knows what’s called heaven beyond heaven, and that there’s always someone better. In front of Elder Ye, any genius will be overshadowed!”

It sounded like flattery, but it came from the bottom of Ning Lixiao’s heart.

Ning Siyu’s talent was strong, but Song Qiyang’s talent was only stronger and not weaker compared to her. But the result?

Song Qiyang would not even worthy of carrying Ye Yuan’s shoes!

Who was Ye Yuan?

That was an existence who one-shotted Head Elder!

Once Ye Yuan broke through to Divine Lord Realm, that was a Pill Tower’s power that could not be overlooked, and could virtually stand shoulder to shoulder with the two great elders!

After today, Ye Yuan’s reputation would spread throughout the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. Ye Manor’s door would likely be trampled to the ground.

“Fangrong, why haven’t you paid respects to Elder Ye? Do you know the rules or not?” Ning Lixiao suddenly said to the Ning Fangrong beside him.

Ning Fangrong followed by his side like a little wifey who was bullied.

Back then, he uttered wild ravings in front of Ye Yuan. He did not expect that in a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan actually became the Pill Tower’s elder.

This change was really damnable!

“Fangrong ... pays respect to Elder Ye!” Ning Fangrong said with clasped hands.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Long time no see, Young Master Ning. Don’t need to be so awkward.”

Ning Fangrong said embarrassedly, “In the past, it was Fangrong who was insensible, hope that Elder Ye doesn’t take it to heart.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I’m not so petty yet. Let the past matters be written off.”

The small conflict between Ye Yuan and Ning Fangrong, Ning Lixiao was naturally aware as well.

Hearing Ye Yuan say so at this time, his heart also landed back in place.

At this time, the Shi Family’s elder, Shi Song, also moved over and said to Ye Yuan with cupped fists, “Elder Ye truly astounds the world with a single brilliant feat! This void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill, this Shi drools with envy. Wonder if ... I can request Elder Ye to take action to refine once more. My Shi Family is willing to offer 2 billion divine essence stones. Elder Ye, please take action once more.”

The Shi Family’s strength was on par with the Ning Family. Gathering a set of spirit medicines to refine the Vastsun Universe Pill was naturally nothing difficult.

It was just that spirit medicines were easy to find, but an alchemist capable of refining void spirit divine-grade was extremely hard to come across!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks for Elder Shi’s appreciation. It’s not that Ye Yuan doesn’t wish to take action, but it’s truly that this void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill can’t be casually refined by this Ye. Being able to form the pill today also depends on elements of luck. Why not Elder Shi wait a few more days? When this Ye’s strength rises to a higher level and after I have a certain degree of confidence, I’ll take action to refine it again. How’s that?”

Actually, this void spirit divine-grade, Ye Yuan already had 60% to 70% assurance in being able to refine it.

But these words, he naturally would not say to Shi Song.

The Ning Family just offered a price of 3.5 billion and bade this medicinal pill down. You offered 2 billion and wanted to make me refine me, was it looking down on me, Ye Yuan?

Furthermore, refining for you for 2 billion, where would the Ning Family’s face go?

Putting it bluntly, the Shi Family felt that this Vastsun Universe Pill was not worth 3.5 billion.

However, Ye Yuan was clear, 3.5 billion was the Ning Family profiting!

Before long, the Ning Family would understand.

The Ning Family and Shi Family, which was far and which was close, Ye Yuan could still differentiate it very clearly. He naturally would not do this kind of thing that bit the hand who fed him.

Shi Song had a regretful look and said, “Then ... after Elder Ye breaks through, this Shi will thicken my face and drop by to request for the pill again!”
