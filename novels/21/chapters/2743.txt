Chapter 2749: Win One by One!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This is already the 223rd match! Doesn’t this guy know fatigue?” Saint Exalt Purplesun’s face showed some admiration.

Starting from the first match, Ye Yuan and Sun Qi had already fought 223rd matches in a month’s time!

During this, apart from regulating his breathing and recovering his strength, Ye Yuan did not rest for a moment.

This kind of high intensity battles, even if they were Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, they were unable to bear it too.

Fighting like this, regardless of whether it was mentally or physically, it would be in an extremely tense state.

Under this kind of extreme state, ordinary people would go crazy after continuing it for a long time.

Even if it was a cultivation maniac, they would not be able to accomplish this too.

It could be seen from this how powerful Ye Yuan’s willpower was!

Saint Exalt Skyfortune let out a sigh and said, “This guy’s talent is too strong! In one month, he didn’t win a single match, but the improvement in strength is too obvious! Now, he can already fight with Sun Qi for more than a thousand moves!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud said, “Not only that, his transformed swords already reached 33, the power skyrocketing! The third form already reached the realm of major accomplishment and is already not far from grand completion anymore!”

The group of powerhouses witnessed Ye Yuan’s growth in this one month with their own eyes.

It could only be described using four words: struck dumb with amazement!

This guy’s improvement was too fast!

In virtually every battle, Ye Yuan would have growth!

From the initial 100 moves to 150 moves, 300 moves, all the way until now, more than 1000 moves, Ye Yuan had practically fought to a draw with Sun Qi!

This kind of improvement speed was something that they did not even dare to imagine.

They all scoffed when Ye Yuan came to cultivate initially.

But now, no one spoke. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Being able to cultivate to Saint Sovereign Heaven, these big shots examined their own conscience and felt that their talent was not worse than anyone else.

But now, facing Ye Yuan, they were only left with shame because of their inadequacy.

Both sides were people from completely different worlds!

At this time, Ye Yuan was currently in the midst of fierce fighting with Sun Qi.

Today, a month later, he was practically no longer in a disadvantageous position when fighting with Sun Qi.

And this was still under the circumstances that Ye Yuan had not broken through to the fourth form!

Battle was never about purely competing with one’s cultivation realm.

Ye Yuan’s application of sword formations already reached the extent where it was mastered to perfection.

His comprehension of the three great rules grew deeper with each passing day.

Three laws transformation, want to maintain the greatest power, that required the coordination of three great rules.

If one had a shortcoming or there was one that was too strong, it would break the balance of transformation, causing the power to be lacking.

In this one month, Ye Yuan really gleaned significant benefits from fighting with the other party.

Sun Qi’s strength was absolutely formidable to the extreme.

One should not look at how he was only ranked 100th. Among the young geniuses that spanned all the heavens, that was at the level of looking down proudly at the world!

Under such overwhelming pressure, Ye Yuan’s potential was also being squeezed out.

Ye Yuan had once comprehended the sword on the seven great sea regions’ nameless island.

After that, Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao had been staying on top of the other two Daos.

But, after this month of tempering, Ye Yuan’s three great rules had already advanced together and fused into one again!

These three great rules were not some cabbages.

Especially spatial rule, the power was not the slightest bit weaker compared to some three laws or five laws too!

These three great rules coordinating and unifying let Ye Yuan’s combat power soar crazily.

“Chop!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan howled, 33 transformed swords suddenly condensing into one, bursting forth with a dazzling light.

Chopping down with a sword, Sun Qi was sent flying out together with his sword.

The powerhouses present stared dumbfounded with their mouths agape once more.

“This … he won?”

“One month, defeating a heaven’s chosen! This guy is really impressive!”

“Us old fellows should really find a piece of tofu to commit suicide with! No way, Your Father is going to cultivate too!”

“Someone a hundred times more talented than you, who is also a hundred times more diligent than you, what qualifications do you have to be lazy? Your Father is going to cultivate too!”

… …

Ye Yuan defeating Sun Qi with one sword deeply triggered the powerhouses present.

Not because Ye Yuan’s talent was great, but it was because of Ye Yuan’s diligence!

Strong talent, that was Heaven showing favor, it could not be changed.

But some things could be changed!

Ye Yuan’s diligence made these old fellows perspire from embarrassment.

Sun Qi was just a projection. His defeat did not result in any damage.

Very soon, he recovered back to new and looked at Ye Yuan and said, “I lost! You’re more outstanding than me in the realm of Jade Sovereign Heaven!”

After one month of tempering, he finally won against Sun Qi. This also made him very happy.

“When I reach Saint Sovereign Heaven, I’ll similarly be more outstanding than you!” Ye Yuan said confidently.

Sun Qi shook his head lightly and said, “When I entered the sect, I couldn’t even rank into the top 100 thousand people in the sect! But, a hundred years later, I crushed my peers and squeezed into the top ten! The Jade Sovereign Heaven me and Saint Sovereign Heaven me, they completely can’t be mentioned in the same breath.”

These words shocked the powerhouses present again!

100 thousandth place!

Great Dao Transformation fourth form could only rank 100 thousandth place in the Labyrinth Divine Palace?

This … was simply nuts!

However, this Sun Qi was a model of inspiration too.

Ever since entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace, he actually leaped over the metaphorical dragon gate and soared to the sky in one leap, killing his way into the top ten after 100 years!

This top ten referred to the contemporary era’s top ten.

But the young powerhouses recorded in this cultivation room were the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s powerhouses through the ages.

For countless years, the Labyrinth Divine Palace produced countless amazingly talented people. For Sun Qi to be able to squeeze into the top ten, it was sufficient to show what kind of level he grew to in the future!

Ye Yuan’s brows also furrowed when he heard it.

This was really quite demoralizing!

However, he also yearned for Saint Sovereign Heaven even more.

After reaching the realm of the Saint Sovereign Heaven, he must make a trip here!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “To me, it’s all the same! You aren’t my goal!”

Sun Qi just smiled and said, “You have to be careful when challenging those guys in front! Some of them are true geniuses, crushing all the way from Jade Sovereign Heaven Realm! I’ve fought countless matches in the cultivation room and challenged them countless times, but I failed to succeed too! They are strong until it makes people despair!”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said, “Rest assured, I’ll win one by one!”

“I hope so!” After Sun Qi finished talking, his figure disappeared.

When the others heard, they were even more speechless.

Especially those Jade Sovereign Heavens, they were already demoralized until they were battered black and blue all over.

Against 100 thousand Saint Sovereign Heavens, what kind of terrifying scene was that?

Among 100 thousand Saint Sovereign Heavens, killing until the top 100, how horrifying was that?!

No, this top 100 was not just the 100th place among 100 thousand Saint Sovereign Heavens, but the 100th place among countless Saint Sovereign Heavens!

“Sigh,?we’re really frogs at the bottom of a well! The Rainclear Continent is too small!”

“No wonder! No wonder after those true geniuses attained Dao, they all wanted to take the sea route and attempt to reach the other?side1!”

Big Yellow looked at Ye Yuan’s back view and left silently, walking towards the tenth cultivation room.

If it was before, he only willingly followed Ye Yuan because he could refine pills.

However, now, he was really impressed!

Ye Yuan was completely not what a tiny little Rainclear Continent could trap!

His stage was on the other side of the sea!
