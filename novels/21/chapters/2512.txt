Chapter 2518: Ant, Don’t Use This Sort of Eyes to Look at Me!

Boom!

Jun Tian scurried out of the ruins, appearing rather ragged.

His gaze was fixed on Ye Yuan, seemingly full of shock.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was currently meeting his eyes as he said coolly,?“Oh,?an ant’s slap smacked you away. Now, aren’t you inferior to even an ant?”

Jun Tian’s expression was indescribably ugly.

Posturing until now, he actually had his face slapped.

But he actually had nothing to say!

“Brat, you can actually control the Heavenspan World’s power! I really underestimated you! I didn’t expect that you actually concealed your abilities previously! Such shrewdness!” Jun Tian said with a cold smile.

“Speaking of which, I still have to thank you! If not for your trace of origin divinity, I wouldn’t have learned this move!?Uh,?if I consider it like that, you really helped me quite a bit!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

When Jun Tian heard that, he nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

His thoughtless words let Ye Yuan break through the shackles, becoming a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse.

His origin divinity taught Ye Yuan how to mobilize the power of the Heavenspan World.

Actually, it was not that Ye Yuan did not use it previously, but that he knew that it was also useless even if he used it.

The power that he controlled was simply showing off in the presence of an expert in front of Jun Tian!

Using it, he would die even faster instead.

Now, he broke through to Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, completely controlling Heavenly Dao.

Through the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s power, he could mobilize the power of the Heavenspan Mountain perfectly.

This was his powerful reliance!

Jun Tian’s gaze turned cold, and he said in a cold voice, “Brat, your cocky appearance really pisses me off!”

Ye Yuan was still very calm and said coolly, “Is that so? This cocky look was learned from you! Don’t you like to posture? Then I’ll let you see what it’s like to be postured by someone else.”

Jun Tian nearly choked from anger. Ye Yuan’s calm and collected appearance currently was really very similar to his just now!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s appearance really nauseated him badly!

An ant was actually posturing in front of him!

Furthermore, he really achieved it!

Nothing was more humiliating than this.

“Brat, there’s a price to pay for posturing! Therefore, you can go and die already! Heavenly Stratum powerhouses aren’t as simple as you think!”

Jun Tian gave a cold snort, both hands suddenly kneading seals.

Space fell into an intense tremor instantly.

Rumble!

“W-What’s going on? What a terrifying power!”

“How is this possible? That Jun Tian actually hasn’t reached his limit yet?”

“T-This is the power of rule! It’s just that this power of rule is also too strong, right? Lord Saint Azure, he … he’ll be alright, right?”

Extreme far away, Wei Feng and the rest of the powerhouses were unable to control their bodies at all, falling down from the air one after another.

It was not just them. At this time, there were even more Heavenspan World powerhouses who were unable to maintain their figures at all.

In an instant, they seemed to have become mortals!

Jun Tian’s casting of his spell thoroughly disrupted the Heavenspan World’s rules.

At this moment, the strength of a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse was displayed in its entirety.

His might subverted the Heavenspan World’s powerhouses’ understanding of power.

“Watch closely! THIS, is the true power of a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse! Silverfeather Heaven Suppressing Palm!”

Jun Tian struck a palm over. The void directly shattered, forming a huge black hole.

In this black hole, even spatial turbulent flows were unable to get close.

The might of the power could be imagined!

This was already a power that surpassed the Heavenspan World!

From start to end, Ye Yuan appeared very calm.

Facing this terrifying palm, his expression did not change in the slightest.

It was only to see him lightly raise a palm. Another slap smacked down.

Bang!

Jun Tian’s power collapsed with a loud bang!

This time, jun Tian was directly smacked into the spatial turbulent flow.

Wei Feng and the rest exchanged glances, with incredulous looks.

This scene was too strange!

They could not see the situation on the battlefield, but they could feel the outrageous undulations over there.

Jun Tian’s terrifying attacks were directly shattered. How could they not feel it?

Boom!

Jun Tian flew back once more, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of apprehension.

He felt that something was wrong!

Too freaking wrong!

How could he possibly be so strong?

Ye Yuan still had that expression as he said coolly, “Ant, don’t look at me with this kind of eyes. I’ll get angry.”

Finished talking, he flung another slap over.

Jun Tian’s expression changed, hurriedly raising his palm to block.

It was just that, without the slightest surprise, he was smacked into the spatial turbulent flow once more.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

One slap after another; Jun Tian did not have the slightest strength to fight back, being smacked flying over and over again.

The entire spatial turbulent flow had already turned into a chaotic mess.

“T-This is … too monstrous! Too monstrous! Too … freaking liberating! Lord Saint Azure, smack this guy to death! Let him posture! Let him posture!” Wei Feng’s tone had a 180-degree turnabout, and tears actually flowed down his old face.

Previously, he was in extreme despair!

Jun Tian’s might practically scared the piss out of him.

But now, he felt exaltation upon fulfillment!

Jun Tian under Ye Yuan’s palm was like a dead dog, without any strength to fight back!

Everyone present felt the same way!

Too freaking liberating!

“Enough! I said, ENOUGH!”

Jun Tian bellowed, a terrifying to the extreme power suddenly exploded.

Ye Yuan was caught by surprise and was actually rocked backward.

Jun Tian had a head of disheveled hair, his clothes tattered, gaze looking at Ye Yuan gloomily.

But there was an additional azure long spear in his hand, emitting an astonishing power.

His gaze was dark, clearly furious to the extreme.

“Brat, even if you can borrow the power of the Heavenspan World, it’s also impossible to be so strong! However, I also don’t want to know anymore, because … I’m very furious right now! Therefore, you must die!”

Jun Tian’s eyes were full of hatred.

He knew that Ye Yuan was deliberately humiliating him, avenging the grudge from before.

Yet, he actually did not have the strength to fight back.

He thought that he could make Ye Yuan submit obediently with a pair of flesh palms.

But he was wrong!

Ye Yuan who had a calm look suddenly smiled.

“What a coincidence, I also feel that you must die!”

Talking until the back, Ye Yuan’s gaze gradually turned cold.

Tian Qing’s corpse had not turned cold yet.

The dead souls of the Heavenspan World’s powerhouses were still quivering in the void!

In fact, he even wanted to encroach upon Li-er!

Also, this enmity of ten billion years of enslavement!

Everything and everything needed Jun Tian to repay!

If he did not die, how could the hatred in Ye Yuan’s heart be dispelled?

Jun Tian sneered and said, “Ignorant ant, you completely don’t know what a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse is! This time, I’m going to be serious!”

Only to see him wave his long spear, the aura on his body became stronger.

This long spear could actually make his strength soar!

However, the expression on Ye Yuan’s face did not change much.

He still had a faint smile as he said, “What a coincidence, I’m also going to be serious this time!”

Ye Yuan lifted his palm, the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain appeared in his palm impressively!

Jun Tian’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Heart of Heavenspan! You … You actually refined the Heart of Heavenspan! This … This is impossible!”

But right at this time, the Heart of Heavenspan suddenly bloomed with light, turning into a streak of flowing light, flying toward the Heavenspan Mountain!
