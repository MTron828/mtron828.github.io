Chapter 2725: Big Yellow, Step on Him!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You don’t know?” This time, it was Taoist Wu Fang’s turn to be surprised.

“Jadetrue Heavenly Sect widely distributed hero invitations, inviting experts at Jade Sovereign Heaven and above to explore a mystic realm together. Now, there are numerous experts currently heading to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “What kind of mystic realm is it that even the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect can’t handle?”

Taoist Wu Fang shook his head and said, “Jadetrue Heavenly Sect kept a tight lid on it. We currently don’t know the situation yet. But they let out rumors that there might be a grandmist treasure coming into being this time. Furthermore, there’s even the lucky chance to become a saint!”

“So that’s how it is!”

Regardless of whether it was a grandmist treasure or the lucky chance to become a saint, it was very attractive to Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

This kind of precious treasure, most likely the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect would not be able to swallow it by themselves too.

Although the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect had flourished for a period of time, they had already declined now.

Of course, these two things did not have the slightest appeal to Ye Yuan.

This sloppy taoist was extremely interested in Big Yellow. Hence, he pestered Ye Yuan and insisted on going together.

Ye Yuan was indifferent. Along the way, he also learned a lot of useful information from the sloppy taoist’s mouth.

Such as, even though the Pill Alliance had united the Five Great Heavenly Regions now, there were also many discordant forces opposing it.

These forces hid in the dark, making feints to divert attention from where the real attack was going to strike, their whereabouts being erratic. The Pill Alliance had a big headache too.

The most famous among them was an organization called Blood Alliance.

This organization often hunted down some of the Pill Alliance’s upper echelon and hijacked the resources of the Pill Alliance.

Coming and leaving without a shadow, it was extremely different to deal with.

At the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, it was the Jade Sovereign Elder, Zong Rui, who received the two of them.

When Zong Rui saw the sloppy taoist, he immediately had a warm and cordial appearance.

As for the Ye Yuan who was by the side, he was directly ignored.

Among the Jade Sovereign Heavens who came this time, there was a very large part of them that were like Ye Yuan; lower Jade Sovereign Heaven.

This bit of strength and also an itinerant cultivator, they naturally would not take them seriously.

“Haha,?didn’t expect that Brother Wu Fang actually came! With you around, that’s fighting one-against-ten!” Zong Rui said with a loud laugh.

Taoist Wu Fang gave Ye Yuan a glance and said smugly, “Younger Brother Zong, you’re too kind!”

Zong Rui waved his hand and said, “This isn’t an exaggeration! In this True Yang Heavenly Domain, who doesn’t know this one sentence: rather provoke King Yama than provoke Wu Fang? Brother Wu Fang’s spirit controlling technique is virtually invincible under Saint Sovereign Heaven!?Eh,?could this be your disciple?”

Taoist Wu Fang smiled and said, “No, no, just someone engaged in the same pursuit that I met on the way. He and I are both adept in spirit controlling techniques and can get along.”

“Oh,?so that’s how it is!” Zong Rui revealed a look of sudden realization and immediately lost interest in Ye Yuan.

Take a look at Taoist Wu Fang’s Purplewind Black-Pupiled Eagle, then look at the ordinary large yellow bull that Ye Yuan was riding, the disparity was too huge.

It seemed like it was another person that wanted to fish in troubled waters.

Zong Rui was contemptuous in his heart.

With regards to Zong Rui’s contempt, Ye Yuan naturally saw it clearly. However, he could not be bothered to explain anything either.

Would I go around saying that Big Yellow was Saint Sovereign Heaven?

Zong Rui led the two and arrived at the top of a mountain peak. This place was where foreign powerhouses stayed.

Jade Sovereign Heavens, even if it was a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven, they were powerhouses of an area too and naturally could not be slighted.

On top of the mountain, many powerhouses were already staying and it was very lively.

These powerhouses even set up a marketplace on the mountain, exchanging for what one had and what the others did not.

“Heh,?here comes another one who wants to fish in troubled waters, and it’s even an ascender!” Ye Yuan just climbed the mountain and there was a harsh voice that transmitted over.

Among those who came to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, the majority were native powerhouses. There were very few ascenders.

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s appearance was very conspicuous.

Actually, Taoist Wu Fang was an ascender too. However, his spirit controlling technique was very famous even in the entire True Yang Heavenly Domain. There was naturally no one that dared to find trouble with him.

But Ye Yuan was different.

In reality, there were some who were ascenders among the Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses that came this time too.

But those who dared to come were all extremely powerful people.

Such as Taoist Wu Fang.

One should not look at how he got trampled by Big Yellow. His strength was actually really strong.

Taoist Wu Fang had a bag of holding, the bag of holding contained ten true spirits!

There were even two that were powerful grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven existences among them.

Taoist Wu Fang’s own combat power was secondary. But these ten great true spirits were sufficient to let him sweep away all in the same rank.

Pray tell, how many people could face ten Jade Sovereign Heaven true spirits at the same time?

It was also because of this that Zong Rui viewed him in a different light.

When this harsh voice came over, there was immediately a group of people gathered around.

The leader was a youth in blue robes who pointed right at Ye Yuan’s nose and said, “Punk, if you’re sensible, hurry up and get down the mountain! You’ll lose your life at any time here!”

This blue-robed youth was quite strong, being already middle Jade Sovereign Heaven.

Judging from his appearance, he had quite the prestige among this group of people.

As for Zong Rui, he did not have the intention of taking action, an attitude of being happy to see it happen.

He was the host and could not chase people away. But, if someone made a move, he naturally did not mind it.

“Heard that? Elder Wei Yu is asking you to get lost, didn’t hear?”

“Brat, with your bit of strength, you don’t have the qualifications to enter the mystic realm and fish in troubled waters, understood?”

“You think that by riding a large yellow bull, you can become Brother Wu Fang? Blindly copying others and making yourself look foolish!”

… …

The moment Wei Yu opened his mouth, many people immediately concurred.

There were even several upper Jade Sovereign Heavens among them.

It could be seen how high Wei Yu’s status was.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and asked curiously, “Who’s Wei Yu? Is he very amazing?”

“Hahaha,?he doesn’t even recognize Elder Wei Yu and this punk dares to come up to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect!” Someone immediately roared with laughter.

Seeing Ye Yuan being targeted, Taoist Wu Fang smiled and said, “Brother Ye, Wei Yu is the number one genius of the True Yang Heavenly Domain’s number one heavenly sect, the Seven-star Heavenly Sect! Don’t look at how he’s only middle Jade Sovereign Heaven; his strength virtually rivals grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven! He’s also reputed to be the young genius with the highest hope of breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Ye Yuan gave an?‘oh’,?expressing his understanding.

This Wei Yu’s status was somewhat similar to Luo Yunqing’s in the Seven-star Heavenly Sect.

But the current Luo Yunqing, his strength had likely surpassed Wei Yu long ago.

“Heh,?Brother Ye, if you give Big Yellow to me, not only will I give you the Purplewind Black-Pupiled Eagle, I’ll even help you resolve your current predicament, alright?” Taoist Wu Fang took advantage of the situation and said.

The moment he spoke up, everyone’s faces changed.

Taoist Wu Fang’s name was no joke.

Wei Yu’s expression turned sullen and he said in a cold voice, “Brother Wu Fang, do you want to become enemies with my Seven-star Heavenly Sect?”

Taoist Wu Fang chuckled and said, “I don’t want to be an enemy of the Seven-star Heavenly Sect. But this old taoist likes this large yellow bull even more! How about it, Brother Ye?”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said lightly, “No need. Big Yellow, come on.”

Ye Yuan pulled Big Yellow and was about to pass through the crowd.

Wei Yu’s expression turned dark and he said in a solemn voice, “Refusing face when it’s given! Die for me!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Done talking, Wei Yu drew his sword fiercely, the speed unimaginably quick.

“Big Yellow, step on him!” Ye Yuan did not care in the slightest and said coolly.

No need for Ye Yuan to order, Big Yellow already unleashed his hoof.

Wei Yu was fast, but Big Yellow was faster.

This hoof avoided the slash unbelievably brilliantly and directly kicked onto Wei Yu’s face.
