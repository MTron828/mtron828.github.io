Chapter 1474 Kanuo“s News

A blood-colored light quietly disappeared into the dense forest. A cloud of black gas gradually condensed into a human form.

“Fortunately, I had some contingencies. Otherwise, this life would have been considered lost in Tiderain City! However ... my injury is too severe. Without several decades of recuperation, I’m probably unable to recover completely. Fiend soul secret art, condense for me!”

That cloud of blood mist gradually condensed into a human form. Who could it be if not Xiu Lie?

But the current Xiu Lie was incomparably weak; less than one-ten-thousandth of his prime.

Xiu Lie let out a long sigh of relief and muttered under his breath, “This war was really lost without rhyme or reason. To actually not even know who the opponent was! Sigh, can’t go back to the fiend race anymore. In the future ... I can only be a lonely spirit!”

Suffering such a defeat, even if Xiu Lie went back, it would be hard to escape death too.

After today, he could only become a lonely spirit and slowly recover his strength.

“Who’s there?!”

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the dense forest, causing Xiu Lie to suddenly get startled.

A figure slowly walked out. Xiu Lie’s pupils constricted. It was actually a human!

His expression turned cold. When he saw that the arrival was only a Heaven Glimpse Realm human, his heart calmed down slightly.

However, his gaze became ferocious very quickly.

This human could just nicely become his blood-feed and help him recover strength!

“Heh heh, kid, you came just in time!”

Xiu Lie’s figure moved explosively, grabbing straight for that human.

Whoosh!

The sound of tearing through the air came over. Xiu Lie’s pupils shrunk, retreating back at an even faster speed than just now.

Boom!

In the panic, Xiu Lie exchanged a blow with the sword light, directly flying out backward.

His gaze revealed a look of great terror as he looked at that human and said in a solemn voice, “Who the hell are you!”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Didn’t you want to know who your opponent was?”

Xiu Lie’s pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief as he said in a deep voice, “It’s you? Impossible! A measly Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artist, how can I possibly be defeated at your hands? No, wait, you ... you’re that punk who jumped off the cliff! You ... How can you possibly still be alive?!”

Xiu Lie looked at Ye Yuan in incredible shock. He also felt that Ye Yuan was somewhat familiar. Thinking carefully, wasn’t he precisely one of those two human martial artists who jumped off the cliff?

Jumping down the cliff, now, he actually showed up in front of him alive and well!

Furthermore, this Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artist actually said that he was his enemy of this war! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

How was this possible?

Xiu Lie felt that his brain was somewhat inadequate right now. He actually lost to a Heaven Glimpse Realm brat?

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Believing or not is your business; nothing to do with me. Now, I’ll ask you one thing. Do you ... know Kanuo?”

Half-step Divine lord powerhouses could be counted on one hand in a capital city.

Even within the boundary of an imperial city, they more or less had some fame.

Hence, Ye Yuan directly asked this question.

Xiu Lie’s gaze turned intent and he said, “You ... You’ve seen Lord Kanuo before? He ... He has already gone missing for a million years! You ... How do you know his name?”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said with a smile, “You really know him! Heh heh, then that’s good!”

Seeing that ill-intentioned gaze of Ye Yuan’s, Xiu Lie revealed a frightened look.

“You ... What do you want to do?” Xiu Lie retreated several steps back in a row and said in a panic.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “Do what? Borrowing your fiend soul to use!”

Xiu Lie’s gaze turned intent and he said fiercely, “You dream on!”

Done talking, Xiu Lie suddenly turned into a cloud of blood mist and still wanted to escape.

But Ye Yuan was even faster than him!

One Sundering Stars releasing, it struck that cloud of blood mist.

Ye Yuan’s figure moved explosively, directly grabbing hold of that ball of Xiu Lie’s fiend soul.

After ten breaths, that ball of fiend soul gradually dissipated without a trace.

A powerful half-step Divine Lord powerhouse died in Ye Yuan’s hands just like that.

Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes, his gaze revealing a look of disappointment.

Kanuo was a figure from a million years ago. At that time, Xiu Lie was still just a junior.

He only knew that Kanuo received Capone Capital City’s City Lord’s order to go search for a small world’s spatial coordinates. In the end, he directly disappeared.

This disappearance was a million yeara’ time.

Ye Yuan was also harboring the mentality of giving it a try, that was why he came to block Xiu Lie. He did not expect that he really had some harvests.

Xiu Lie’s speed was fast, but that was also just relative to Wu Tianxiang and the others.

After Ye Yuan broke through to middle-stage Heaven Glimpse, sword maneuvering flight’s speed was even greater than before. Catching up to a heavily injured Xiu Lie was still a cinch.

Gong!

The identity token on Xiu Lie’s body as well as his spatial ring, storage equipment and so on, all fell down.

Ye Yuan casually beckoned, gathering up these things.

But he did not check it straight away. He just said coolly, “Senior has watched for so long, why don’t you reveal yourself?”

A figure slowly walked out, his eyes rather surprised as he said, “Looks like this seat really underestimated you! It isn’t unjust for Xiu Lie to be defeated under your hands!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior has made great contributions and toiled hard holding down the fort at Tiderain City! Coming here, it isn’t to make things difficult for a junior, right?”

This man was none other than precisely the Divine Lord Realm powerhouse holding down the fort at Tiderain City, Ze Yan!

But Ye Yuan also knew that this Ze Yan in front of him was merely a clone.

His real self did not dare to leave Tiderain City at all.

Otherwise, how could Ye Yuan dare to speak so casually?

If this Ze Yan had malicious intent, Ye Yuan would be unable to bear the consequences.

In reality, when Dustless drew close to Tiderain City, he discovered Ze Yan’s existence.

A hint of surprise flashed across Ze Yan’s eyes as he said in surprise, “Heh, looks like you, kid, really have keen insight into matters! I wonder when a junior like you appeared in my human race! Truly, the young ones are to be feared!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior is too kind!”

Ze Yan waved his hand and said, “You don’t have to be so on-guard against me. This battle was all thanks to you! I represent River Eternal Imperial City’s hundreds of millions of lives and express thanks to you!”

While talking, Ze Yan clasped his hands at Ye Yuan, which was considered to have shown great respect.

Even though it was just a clone, Ze Yan was a true-blue Divine Lord Realm powerhouse.

To be able to do this was truly not easy.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Senior is too courteous! I, as a member of the human race, contributing to the human race is also ought to be.”

Ze Yan nodded and said, “Looking at your appearance, is it possible that you want to go to the fiend race’s territory?”

Ye Yuan did not conceal it either, saying with a nod, “This Ye has some personal affairs, this trip likely can’t be avoided.”

Ze Yan said, “Do you know that humans are the lowest race in the land of the fiend race, living subhuman lives? Even this seat also doesn’t dare to easily go deep in. You ...”

Ze Yan’s words were not said until the end, but the meaning was already very clear.

Your strength was too weak; not suitable to go to the fiend race territory!

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Junior has some means. So, protecting myself shouldn’t be a problem.”

Ze Yan’s gaze turned intent and he said, “Since that’s the case, I won’t keep you anymore, be more careful!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and walked away slowly.

Above the natural chasm, Ye Yuan was currently walking away leisurely but heard an earth-shaking loud sound coming from the direction of Tiderain City.

“Tiderain City, from top to bottom, thanks Hero Ye for your life-saving grace!”

“Tiderain City, from top to bottom, thanks Hero Ye for your life-saving grace!”
