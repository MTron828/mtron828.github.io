Chapter 1356: Gui Yun’s Strength!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Wang Song was still somewhat fearful of Yang Rui’s identity in the end. That was why he did not deal a killing blow.

Except, he was backed by the Wang Family, his talent and strength outstanding. He could really not take Yang Rui seriously.

His overbearingness made everyone give a sidelong glance.

Yang Rui struggled to his feet and glared at Wang Song as he said, “If you have the capability, kill me!”

Wang Song did not expect that Yang Rui was so steadfast. But Yang Rui’s steadfastness triggered Wang Song’s killing intent even more.

“Heh, gutsy! Are you challenging my bottom line? Then ... as you wish!”

Wang Song took one step at a time, walking into the Myriad Treasure Tower.

The powerful aura simply made people unable to look right at him.

Right at this time, a figure slowly walked out, blocking at the entrance.

Wang Song’s brows furrowed, and he said disdainfully, “A middle-stage Grotto Profound also dares to be a mantis trying to stop a chariot? Scram for this city lord!”

A single ‘scram’ sounded like a great bell, crushing over towards Ye Yuan.

A hint of a mocking faint smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, accepting this sound wave attack very calmly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

What a joke, Ye Yuan’s Voice of the Dragon God was god knows how many times more profound than this.

For a mere sound wave to want to make Ye Yuan avoid it, it was undoubtedly a fool’s talk.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s cool and collected appearance, Wang Song finally looked squarely at this middle-stage Grotto Profound in front of him.

“Who are you? Those who bar me die!” Wang Song said coldly.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Aren’t you here to kill me? I’m already standing in front of you, and you don’t recognize me?”

Wang Song’s expression changed. Rage instantly filled his chest.

“You’re Ye Yuan? Indeed have some skill! But you’re too weak!” Wang Song said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “Your opponent isn’t me.”

While talking, a gust of Yin wind howled past. Gui Yun’s figure appeared at Ye Yuan’s side.

Wang Song’s pupils constricted but did not reveal a look of surprise.

Chen Yongnian already told him in the message that Ye Yuan had a middle-stage Two-star evil spirit by his side, his strength uncommon.

“A mere middle-stage Two-star evil spirit! Do you think that this city lord can’t do anything to you? Today, you’re dead for sure!” Wang Song said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan shot a glance at Yang Rui who was not far away. His voice gradually became cold as he said, “The Wang Family’s people are indeed all unreasonable when doing things! However, Brother Yang’s enmity, this Ye will note it down today! There will come a day where you’ll pay the price!”

Wang Song chortled with laughter and said, “Hahaha ... that will also have to wait until you have this day! Do you think that you can still survive past today?”

Amidst the laughter, Wang Song’s aura suddenly erupted. The divine essence of middle-stage Heaven Glimpse instantly surged between heaven and earth.

“Taiyi True Dipper Fist! Die for me!” Wang Song roared, smashing a fist towards Gui Yun.

“It’s actually the Taiyi True Dipper Fist! This is one of Wu Meng Academy’s six supreme skills, its power boundless!”

“This Wang Song is indeed not what that incompetent young brother of his can compare to! Those able to cultivate the Taiyi True Dipper Fist are all elites of Wu Meng Academy.”

“Late-stage Heaven Glimpse versus a middle-stage Two-star evil spirit, even using such a powerful martial technique, this simply has no suspense!”

The moment Wang Song’s Taiyi True Dipper Fist was unleashed, it immediately aroused a wave of exclamations in the crowd.

As Wu Meng Capital City’s highest academy. Wu Meng Academy naturally had countless cultivation methods and martial techniques.

But there were six great skills that were the most famous among them. This Taiyi True Dipper Fist was one of them.

This was not some secret within the Wu Meng Academy’s jurisdiction. Many geniuses entered the Wu Meng Academy aiming for these six supreme techniques.

But, even if they enter the Wu Meng Academy, those able to learn these six great techniques were also just the minority.

However, Wang Song actually learned the Taiyi True Dipper Fist. His status in the Wu Meng Academy could be imagined.

This fist of Wang Song harbored the intention of directly crushing Gui Yun. Hence, he went all out.

That power was simply dreadful!

When had Jewelhill City’s martial artists seen such a powerful martial technique before? All dumbstruck with amazement.

Gui Yun’s gaze turned intent. Flipping his hand, there was an additional Soul Beckoning Streamer. It was precisely the Myriad Soul Flag.

Ever since Ye Yuan obtained the Myriad Soul Flag, he basically never really used it.

He did not lack divine artifacts. This Myriad Soul Flag was not too suitable for him as well. Hence, he saved it all along.

All the way until he met Gui Yun, did he hand him this profound divine artifact.

With Gui Yun’s strength, using this Myriad Soul Flag was just nice.

Through a bout of refining, the Myriad Soul Flag already recovered to its peak period strength.

Facing this powerful strike, Gui Yun’s expression turned solemn, directly bringing out the Myriad Soul Flag!

“Ghost Dao Hundred Runes ... Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts!”

Immediately, whimpering sounds echoed out. Heaven and earth changed colors because of it!

The screams of countless ferocious ghosts sounded out. Countless ghostly silhouettes dashed out from inside the Myriad Soul Flag, meeting this punch of Wang Song’s.

Boom!

The fierce punch directly scattered these ferocious ghosts, shocking Gui Yun back several steps.

But Gui Yun was perfectly unscathed!

The powerful Taiyi True Dipper Fist was actually stopped by Gui Yun!

Wang Song’s expression changed, and he said solemnly, “Profound divine artifact!”

This result made everyone incomparably astounded.

“Actually blocked it! How is this possible?”

“How can this middle-stage Two-star evil spirit’s strength be so powerful? Looking at this appearance, if other late-stage Heaven Glimpse martial artists came, they might not even be that evil spirit’s match!”

“No wonder Ye Yuan had no fear! Other people provoking the Wang Family, this existence, would have long run. But he kept on waiting here for them to visit!”

...

Late-stage Heaven Glimpse versus a middle-stage Two-star evil spirit, this was virtually an overwhelming strength.

Furthermore, what Wang Song used was even the Taiyi True Dipper Fist, this kind of powerful martial technique.

Even so, he still failed to take Gui Yun down!

This scene was even more astonishing than Wang Song using the Taiyi True Dipper Fist.

How could these people know the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes’ prowess? That was a Ghost Dao pinnacle cultivation method containing the maxim of Great Dao.

Even though Gui Yun only comprehended one ghost rune, borrowing the power of a profound divine artifact, he could already forcefully clash with Wang Song, this kind of powerhouse.

Otherwise, how could Ye Yuan sit here and wait to die?

Wang Song’s face was livid. He completely did not expect that Ye Yuan’s Two-star evil spirit’s strength was actually so strong!

Just now, he still pledged in all solemness to make Ye Yuan die. But now, he discovered that he was thinking too much.

Gui Yun this hurdle was not easy to clear!

“This city lord doesn’t believe that a mere middle-stage Two-star evil spirit can really block my Taiyi True Dipper Fist! I want to see how many fists of mine you can block!”

Wang Song’s face fell, mustering up the Taiyi True Dipper Fist once more, crushing over towards Gui Yun.

Gui Yun’s expression changed. The Myriad Soul Flag attacked once more!

“Halt!”

Right at this time, an even more appalling aura suddenly intercepted in the middle, directly sending Wang Song and Gui Yun flying.

“Who is it, to dare ruin this city lord’s good thing?” Wang Song got up and said angrily.

An old man parted the crowd and slowly came between Wang Song and Gui Yun.

Everyone used a surprised gaze to look at the old man. To be able to flick Gui Yun and Wang Song flying so casually, how terrifying was this old man’s strength?

Seeing the arrival, Wang Song’s expression involuntarily changed, and he exclaimed, “Teacher, why are you here?”
