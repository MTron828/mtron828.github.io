Chapter 1889: Patrolling Inspector

“You shouldn’t have let them go!”

After everyone left, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove let out a long sigh.

When Ye Yuan did this, he did not stop it.

Of course, he had no way of stopping it too.

The present Ye Yuan already completely replaced him, becoming the master of the Immortal Grove World.

This place already did not belong to him.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s body already turned into motes of light and started dissipating.

Dustless’s body also formed. His expression was indescribably lonely.

Ye Yuan gave Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove a glance and said coolly, “I have my bottom-line when doing things. They only came in to seek treasures and have no grudge or enmity with me. Killing them I’ll find it hard to get over my conscience.”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s expression became solemn.

He knew that Ye Yuan was still angry about what happened before.

It was fine that he set up this plot, but the Immortal Grove World’s trillions of life would lose their lives because of it.

Those people were utterly worthless in Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s eyes. But in Ye Yuan’s eyes, those people should not die.

Immortal Grove smiled slightly and said, “Boy, a soft-hearted personality will only make you encounter more dangerous situations!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “What difference is there from animals if you’re ruthless and inhuman!”

“Hahaha! Truly a different type! Boy, I know that you’re unhappy that I made a wager with the Immortal Grove World. But no matter what, you’re the successor of my mantle! This point, you can’t wipe it away,” Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove laughed loudly and said.

Ye Yuan did not smile, he just said coolly, “If it wasn’t like this, do you feel that I’d be conversing with you patiently now?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s face turned black and he said, “Boy, whether you’re willing or not, you inherited this Empyrean’s mantle. Don’t you know anything about pecking order?”

At this time, the Dustless who had been reticent all along suddenly spoke up, “Actually ... whether or not Ye Yuan is considered the successor of your mantle, it’s really hard to say. He indeed obtained the World Suppressing Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl, but these two items were already abandoned by you. As for his cultivation method and martial techniques, it’s all inherited from the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and has nothing to do with you.”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s pupils constricted, and he said, “He ... didn’t cultivate the cultivation method that this empyrean left behind?”

Dustless shook his head and said, “His ambition is even greater than yours. His ability is also above yours! The cultivation method that Ye Yuan created will shock the entire Heavenspan World om the future!”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s expression became austere, and could not help recalling the events before.

He was astonishingly talented. If he did not fall, it might not be impossible to reach the realm of Transcendent Heavenly Emperor in the future.

But even so, he also did not obtain the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s recognition.

But now, Ye Yuan already refined the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, becoming the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s true master.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove understood Dustless; he was not trying to spite him, but he really felt very optimistic about Ye Yuan.

If it was really as Dustless said, then could Ye Yuan’s future accomplishments be even more than Transcendent Heavenly Emperor?

This ... was a little too preposterous, right?

As if seeing through what Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was thinking, Ye Yuan’s expression turned slightly dark and he said, “Those has nothing to do with you anymore, go in peace!”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove could even put his hands on the artifact spirit that he nurtured for a million years for the sake of taking revenge and even made the entire Immortal Grove World be buried in death with him.

If not looking on the account that he was the Immortal Grove World’s creator, Ye Yuan definitely would not let him die just like this.

There was little common ground for understanding between persons of differing principles.

Although Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove bestowed grace on him, Ye Yuan already lost his patience.

He had Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove had a common enemy, killing Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was also considered paying the kindness already.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove clearly knew this outcome, so he departed very calmly.

The light dissipated, there was no more Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove in this world.

The peak powerhouse who once had nature at his beck and call in the Heavenspan World evaporated into thin air now.

Ye Yuan looked at those gradually dissipating light dots, expression complicated.

Not far away, Kunwu similarly had a complicated expression.

That youth who forcefully broke through his realm back then already grew into a colossal tree!

With a wave of a hand, even Empyrean powerhouses could be suppressed at will, truly unimaginable.

“Ye Yuan, let him follow you. This old thing owed Immortal Grove too much, he had no choice but to repay him,” Dustless suddenly said.

He knew what Ye Yuan was thinking, Kunwu was equivalent to being Immortal Grove’s accomplice.

Ye Yuan slowly nodded his head, looked at Kunwu, and said, “Senior once helped my mother, showing great kindness to me. If you’re willing, you can naturally stay by my side. But whether to go or stay, it still depends on Senior yourself.”

Kunwu heaved a sigh and said, “I’ll remain in the Immortal Grove World then.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and did not press the issue.

...

The Immortal Grove World had a thousand things that needed to be done. Ye Yuan placated Fang Tian and the rest before bringing Leng Qiuling and the others out of the world through the World Locking Gate.

Concerning the present Immortal Grove World, Ye Yuan was no longer worried.

As long as it wasn’t Heavenly Emperor powerhouses who entered, he could suppress with a wave of his hand.

Of course, following his realm’s increase, before long, even Heavenly Emperor powerhouses could be suppressed too.

So currently, he was not worried that someone would enter the Immortal Grove World again.

It was still that narrow, winding trail.

Recalling the close shave when leaving the world back then, the scene of being saved by Liang Wanru, Ye Yuan felt like a lifetime had passed.

“Also don’t know how Wanru and Fatty are,” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Later, Liang Wanru and Xie Jingyi went to the area under Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s jurisdiction under Xiao Feng’s arrangements.

For so many years, there had always been no news.

Presently, Ye Yuan’s memories were revived at the sight of familiar places. He missed them quite a lot.

“Big Brother, if you want to see them, go take a look at them,” White Light smiled and said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “These few years, I’ve always been busy searching for you guys and didn’t have time to go see them. After finding both Li-er and Lu-er, I really have to take a trip to Myriad Treasure Domain.”

This place was not considered far from Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. Ye Yuan brought everyone and returned to the imperial city very soon.

Back then, he left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to find White Light and the rest. With this departure, it was several hundred years.

Returning to the city, Ye Yuan was also filled with emotions.

But the current Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, the top of city walls were covered in colorful flags, a road paved from white feathers stretched all the way to outside the city.

Countless powerhouses were standing outside the city gates, extremely ceremonious.

“Your Excellency, could it be that City Lord they all knew that you came back and specially came to welcome you?” Ning Tianping said smilingly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If they have this ability to foresee the future, I wouldn’t have needed to go all the way to Extreme Light Imperial City either!”

“Heh heh, makes sense. I wonder who it is, to actually put on such a grand display, really puts people off!” Ning Tianping said.

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said smilingly, “Look, isn’t he here?”

Ning Tianping looked over. Sure enough, he saw a resplendent and magnificent divine carriage descend from the sky.

That divine carriage was extremely dazzling, exuding an aura that took people’s breath away. It was actually a celestial deity mystic treasure!

The divine carriage landed on the flat ground, a young figure slowly walked out.

Zuo Shujie at the front ranks, the group of Celestial Deity powerhouses hurriedly knelt down and cried out respectfully, “Subordinate Zuo Shujie, leads Heavenly Eagle to pay respect to Lord Patrolling Inspector!”

That young man had a haughty look, his eyes revealing a hint of contempt, completely ignoring Zuo Shujie and the rest, going straight into Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Zuo Shujie was just about to get up, but then he heard that young man frown and said in a cold voice, “Did I let you guys get up[1]?”

[1] Yeh, I have no idea how you hear a frown, lol
