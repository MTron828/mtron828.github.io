Chapter 2731: Heavenspan Mountain Advancing!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan complied and placed his dragon horn on the boundary wall.

Swoosh!

Outside of Ye Yuan’s expectations, his body actually rushed straight into the boundary wall, and he stumbled.

Ye Yuan could not help being taken aback. He was still wondering how difficult it would be. He did not expect that he would come in so easily.

“Senior, it doesn’t seem as hard as imagined,” Ye Yuan said with an innocent face.

Mi Tian had a confused look too and said, “You brat …?Ah,?I understand. You cultivate the cultivation method of the Lord of Chaos and are very attuned to chaos in itself. Coupled with the affinity of the true dragon race, entering the boundary wall becomes very easy. However, don’t be happy too early either. With your bit of strength, you can’t walk very far at all.”

Ye Yuan walked towards that yellow air mass and said with a smile, “Being able to get the grandmist energy will do, how should I refine it?”

Myriad Realms Mountain said, “You send the Myriad Realms Mountain into the grandmist energy, then follow the method that I say. Guide grandmist energy in bit by bit. Take note, there mustn’t be the slightest mistake during this process. Otherwise, not only will it fall short of success at the last stage, it will even damage the Myriad Realms Mountain. And this cluster of grandmist energy would also be wasted.”

As he said, Mi Tian imparted the refining method to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan arrived next to the grandmist energy and sent the Heavenspan Mountain into the grandmist energy according to the refining method that Mi Tian talked about.

Over there, the old man who was fighting fiercely with Big Yellow seemed to have felt it, his entire body suddenly trembling.

His eyes were glued onto the Heavenspan Mountain, the look in his eyes full of shock.

“H-Heavenspan Mountain! The Heavenspan Mountain is actually in his hands!”

Wearing out iron shoes in a fruitless search, who would have guessed that the Heavenspan Mountain that the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect had been searching bitterly for from top to bottom, actually came back by itself!

Bang!

Just as the old man was in shock, Big Yellow showed off coquettishness and a hoof kick arrived again.

The old man was caught off-guard and directly had a kick stomped on his face.

The old man’s nosebleed overflowed, only feeling that the entire world was spinning.

Big Yellow had a disdainful look as he said, “Still getting distracted when fighting, are you looking down on people?”

The straightforward and good-natured Big Yellow actually became full of uninhibitedness when talking.

The old man endured the pain and said in a solemn voice, “Who the hell are you guys? Why would the Heavenspan Mountain be in your hands?”

Big Yellow said coolly, “Want to know, wait until this exalt beats you to a cripple first! In a while, Master Ye will naturally come and tell you!”

The old man looked at Big Yellow hatefully and said, “You, a dignified Saint Exalt, is actually going to be a puny little Jade Sovereign Heaven’s hired thug?”

Big Yellow said disdainfully, “What does a swallow know of the aims of a swan? You think that three tribulations Saint Sovereign Heaven is very strong, but following this Master Ye will have greater possibilities! Alright, enough rubbish, watch out for my hoof!”

After he finished talking, it was another Coquettish Profligate Hoof.

Got to admit, although this move that Mi Tian imparted looked very embarrassing, its power was really strong.

Each kick was illusory; extremely hard to ascertain.

Wanting to defend was incredibly difficult.

The old man had just taken a hit; his entire person was still in upheaval. Hence, how could he take this kick?

Big Yellow unforgiving after gaining the momentum too, each hoof attack being stronger than the last.

Refining grandmist energy was not considered very difficult to Ye Yuan.

This process was very complicated, it was a very delicate job.

But, for Ye Yuan, meticulousness was one of his greatest strong points.

The process of refining a grade four heavenly imperial pill was many times more complicated than this, he similarly would not make any mistakes.

That small cluster of grandmist energy became smaller and smaller.

The aura of the Heavenspan Mountain became increasingly unfathomable.

This was precisely the hallmark of a grandmist treasure!

When the last trace of grandmist energy was refined, Ye Yuan let out a long sigh in relief, his face revealing a joyful expression.

This trip to the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect was really not in vain!

Although the Dragon Spring Sword was good, in terms of potential, it was still the Heavenspan Mountain that was better.

This treasure could follow him as he cultivated all the way to an extremely high realm.

Mi Tian also said, there were not many treasures comparable to the Myriad Realms Mountain in this world!

Bringing the Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan withdrew out of the boundary wall.

Over there, the old man had already been kicked by Big Yellow until he was covered in wounds and was almost biting the dust.

It was also that a Saint Sovereign Heaven could take a beating, otherwise, with Big Yellow’s strength, the old man would have long been laid flat.

However, looking at Big Yellow’s coquettish appearance, Ye Yuan still could not resist bursting into laughter.

Compared to normally, Big Yellow had simply become like a different person.

With the intention of testing the Heavenspan Mountain’s power, Ye Yuan silently recited a spell. The Heavenspan Mountain immediately turned into a wisp of green smoke and smashed toward the old man.

Ye Yuan grasped the timing perfectly, coordinating closely with Big Yellow.

The old man was caught by surprise, his back suffering a heavy blow.

Only to see him spurt a mouthful of blood wildly, directly collapsing onto the ground and staying there.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he could not help being secretly speechless too.

The power of the Heavenspan Mountain was more than a hundred times stronger than before! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In fact, its power was more than a magnitude stronger than the Dragon Spring Sword.

Just a small cluster of grandmist energy and its power actually had such a big increase!

Seeing that the old man had lost his combat capacity, Big Yellow stopped attacking too.

The other party was still strong in the end. Even if he learned the Coquettish Profligate Hoof, he was still unable to take the other party down within a short time.

The battle between Saint Sovereign Heavens was very difficult.

It was far too difficult to want to kill the opponent.

Ye Yuan gave Big Yellow a big thumbs up and praised, “Big Yellow, really coquettish!”

Big Yellow gave Ye Yuan a resentful glance and said, “Master Ye, stop making fun of me.”

Ye Yuan burst out laughing when he heard that.

“W-Who the hell are you? Why would our Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s Heavenspan Mountain be in your hands?” The old man still could not resist asking.

Jadetrue Heavenly Sect had already lost the Heavenspan Mountain for several tens of thousands of years.

Now that he saw it again, how could he not be excited?

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said disdainfully, “Your Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s Heavenspan Mountain??Heh,?Yan Jadetrue obtained the Heavenspan Mountain here, right? He was merely one of the Heavenspan Mountain’s masters, that’s all. Presently, I’m its master!”

The old man looked at the Heavenspan Mountain in Ye Yuan’s hands and his pupils could not help constricting.

The Heavenspan Mountain actually already became a grandmist treasure!

When fighting just now, the Heavenspan Mountain absorbed that mysterious cluster of power in the boundary wall and broke through!

One had to know, with Yan Jadetrue’s strength, it was impossible to let the Heavenspan Mountain become a grandmist treasure too!

What in the world was this young man’s background?

Also, that mysterious person dwelling in his body was a figure who was even terrifying to the extreme.

Casually giving pointers to Big Yellow and it made his strength eclipse his!

This level of means, it was what even he, this Saint Sovereign Heaven, could not imagine!

If not for seeing it with his own eyes, he would not believe it at all.

“Jadetrue Heavenly Sect really concealed deeply! I didn’t expect that you guys actually still had a three tribulations Saint Sovereign Heaven! Let me ask you, what kind of place is the mystic realm that your Jadetrue Heavenly Sect is going to this time?” Ye Yuan asked.

The old man’s expression changed slightly, and he said, “Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm is a magnificent continent. There are countless precious treasures in there! However, immense danger is also held in store. Back then, seven great middle Saint Sovereign Heavens were killed until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open in order to obtain the treasure inside. Ancestor Jadetrue also fell there. However, only the seven of them knew the location of the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm. Only all the way until recently, when a phenomenon suddenly happened there, was it discovered by us.”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Where is that Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm?”

The old man said, “Inklight Forest!”
