1453 Bloodbath on the Streets!

Whoosh!

Qin Pei was currently fully engrossed in dealing with the Nether Ghostclaw. Suddenly, his scalp tingled, and a feeling of immense danger welled up in his heart.

Ye Yuan’s figure turned into a stream of flowing light, rushing toward Qin Pei with an inconceivably swift speed.

This was too sudden. Ye Yuan’s speed was too fast, fast until everyone could not react to it.

The sense of crisis coming from the back was even stronger than the Nether Ghostclaw!

Too late to turn around, Qin Pei slashed with a backhand.

At the same time, he gave a backhanded palm, slapping toward the Nether Ghostclaw.

Qin Pei’s reaction could not be said to not be quick, but Ye Yuan was even faster!

Clank!

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan and Qin Pei virtually spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood at the same time. Ye Yuan’s figure flew out backward.

However, Qin Pei was much more miserable than Ye Yuan.

The cooperation between Gui Yun and Ye Yuan did not need words to transmit at all.

The moment Ye Yuan moved, Gui Yun understood Ye Yuan’s intention. He continued to focus his attack on Qin Pei.

How could Qin Pei’s hasty palm block the attack of the Nether Ghostclaw?

Being attacked from both front and rear by the enemy, he immediately suffered heavy injuries.

This scene happened too quickly and too suddenly. Lin Xiu and Qin Zheng both could not react to it.

By the time they reacted, Qin Pei was already badly injured and unable to fight anymore.

It was also that the majority of Qin Pei’s strength was concentrated on Gui Yun, causing Ye Yuan’s injuries to be not too severe.

Otherwise, with Qin Pei’s grand completion Heaven Glimpse strength, forcefully clashing a blow with him, Ye Yuan would have to be seriously injured even if not dead.

Without the Heavenly Thunder Swift Talisman’s augmentation, Ye Yuan was still a little frail in front of grand completion Heaven Glimpse.

However, Ye Yuan completely did not care about the injuries on his body. In the instant he hit the ground, his long sword swung, and he actually charged back once more!

“Chasing Moon!”

This move, Ye Yuan referenced Jin Yu’s Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels back then.

Jin Yu’s move that borrowed power to swing out was completed in one breath, virtually unable to crack.

But now, Ye Yuan’s move was different from his, but this swing had the same ingenuity of achieving the same goal via different means with him.

The opportunity was fleeting. Ye Yuan did not want to give Qin Pei a chance to catch his breath.

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan turned into a stream of flowing light once more, shooting toward Qin Pei.

But at this time, Qin Tian was struck flying by two heavy blows, his entire body had not landed yet.

His internal organs were still in turmoil, completely not expecting Ye Yuan to actually arrive again at this time.

Pfft!

The Evil Extermination Sword passed through Qin Pei’s chest without any surprises!

Qin Pei’s eyes went wide. Till death, he did not believe that it was Ye Yuan who killed him.

But Ye Yuan would not give him the chance!

Qin Pei’s eyes gradually became slack, but the pair of eyes refused to close no matter what.

He died with everlasting regret!

How could an initial-stage Heaven Glimpse possibly kill him, a grand completion Heaven Glimpse existence?

“This ... What the hell happened just now? Ye Yuan’s sword art was too quick, I only saw a blurry afterimage!”

“S-So strong! Ye Yuan only used two swords and killed a grand completion Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouse! Although it was under the assistance of that evil spirit, this battle achievement is sufficient to shock the whole city!”

“This must be a dream! Must be dreaming! Qin Pei is a proud son of heaven, his strength could virtually sweep across those in the same rank. To actually be killed by an initial-stage Heaven Glimpse!”

...

Originally, in everyone’s eyes, Ye Yuan’s provocation was just a farce.

But no one expected that this farce actually turned into a bloody fight on the streets.

Gui Yun’s strength was indeed strong, but facing three great peerless geniuses, he was forced to use ghost energy possession too before barely managing to fight to a draw.

Once time passed, he would definitely be overwhelmed.

But Ye Yuan suddenly joining the battlefield instantly reversed the battle situation.

From Ye Yuan’s appearance to Ye Yuan killing three people in a row, it was merely half a quarter of an hour.

Everything happened too quickly, quick until everyone had not reacted yet and the battle was already more than half over.

With Ye Yuan finishing off Qin Pei, the pressure on Gui Yun’s side immediately lessened.

With his current strength, fighting Lin Xiu one-on-one was a sure win.

With the addition of Qin Zheng, it also just reached a tie with him.

But there was still Ye Yuan who could threaten them by the side! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Yuan’s Chasing Moon was too fast; completely impossible to guard against.

Once Ye Yuan seized the opportunity, they would be dead for sure.

Pfft!

Ye Yuan drew back the Evil Extermination Sword, his gaze turning toward the battlefield once more.

Qin Pei collapsed onto the ground weakly, not understanding what was going on until death.

As if sensing that icy-cold gaze of Ye Yuan’s, Lin Xiu and Qin Zheng duo both seemed to be a little flustered. Gui Yun controlled the ghost claw and immediately took the upper-hand.

Swoosh!

How could Ye Yuan possibly waste such a fine opportunity, unleashing Chasing Moon without the slightest hesitation!

He turned into an afterimage once again. The target this time was Qin Zheng!

Clank!

With preparation, Qin Zheng’s response was much more adequate compared to Qin Pei.

His long sword swung, forcefully clashing with Ye Yuan by a narrow shave.

“Puhwark!”

The powerful strength of grand completion Heaven Glimpse made him injured once again.

But Qin Zheng was not feeling good too. Gui Yun’s side made use of this opportunity and also firmly took the upper-hand.

Ye Yuan did not stop in the least bit, forcefully enduring his internal organs’ injuries, he unleashed Chasing Moon again!

Clank!

Clank!

Clank!

One streak of cold light after another flashed past, making everyone palpitate with anxiety and fear.

Each attack, Ye Yuan spurted fresh blood wildly.

Clearly, he was risking it with his life!

Ye Yuan was miserable, but Qin Zheng was even worse than him.

Ye Yuan’s attacks were not momentary impulses. Each time he attacked, he made Qin Zheng actually vomit blood.

He narrowly avoided the Nether Ghostclaw’s attacks several times, but that powerful power of laws still made him suffer heavy wounds.

Qin Zheng’s injuries were much more serious than Ye Yuan!

“How great an enmity is this? Ye Yuan is risking too much, this is simply exchanging life for life!”

“Heh, heard that Qin Tian nominally went out to experience and train. Actually, it was to go and hunt down Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan and the Qin Family are already long irreconcilable already!”

“Could it be that today, Ye Yuan is going to kill all of Wu Meng Academy’s few great geniuses? Really wonder what kind of reaction it will be when Wu Meng Academy and the Qin Family gets the news in a bit!”

“Ye Yuan is still too reckless! The Qin Family is deeply entrenched in Wu Meng Capital City. Even if there’s the Myriad Treasure Tower behind Ye Yuan, it’s probably no use too.”

...

Everyone watched the Ye Yuan who was playing with his life, all exclaiming with admiration.

It was just that they did not know, Ye Yuan risking his life like this to kill people was not for himself, but in order to give Little Fatty an account!

The more Lin Xiu fought, the more alarmed she got. Regardless of whether it was Gui Yun or Ye Yuan, they were both too terrifying.

Her strength was proclaimed to be the academy’s number two, whule Qin Zheng was also an existence ranked in the top five.

But when they faced the combination of Gui Yun plus Ye Yuan, they actually did not have any strength to fight back at all!

“No way! At this rate, I’ll be bogged down to death by them too! I have to find a way to return to the academy!” Lin Xiu thought.

Right at this moment, Ye Yuan arrived once more. Gui Yun also placed the focus of the attack on Qin Zheng in order to cooperate with Ye Yuan.

Lin Xiu made a swift decision, swinging an empty slash, her figure retreating explosively, directly breaking away from the group battle!
