1375 Sword Tomb

“What did you say? Ye Yuan he ... passed the test and entered the Wu Meng Academy? H-Haha, excellent! Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk! Hell has no gate, yet you want to barge inside!”

When Wang Song heard the news of Ye Yuan entering the Wu Meng Academy, he was thunderstruck.

After the shock, Wang Song became wildly elated.

If Ye Yuan kept on hiding in the Myriad Treasure Tower, he would really be helpless.

But now, his chance finally came.

“What did you say? Ye Yuan’s points are even higher than the top dog?”

But when he heard the process of the events, concerning Ye Yuan entering the Wu Meng Academy with the result of points making him number one, his entire person was struck senseless. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Only after a long time did Wang Song come back to his senses and muttered, “This kid isn’t easy to deal with. This time, we must strike him dead in one blow!”

Chen Yongnian nodded and said, “This kid has no idea of life or death, offending Brilliant Peace City’s number one genius, Jia Chong, during the test! In addition, the Qin Family’s Qin Shao obtained top dog this time, his future limitless! I heard that after Ye Yuan he entered the city, he seemed to have already offended the Qin Family?”

Wang Song gave him a glance rather surprisedly and said with a smile, “Looks like your news network is very well-informed! That’s right! This boy is indeed a troublemaker. But this matter, we still have to give it further thought and confer at length. After all, no loss of life is permitted in the academy. Once we act rashly and alert the enemy, we won’t have a second chance!”

Chen Yongnian said, “Ye Yuan that kid brings along a late-stage Two-star evil spirit around him. It’s not easy to deal with. But I heard that he is in close association with a little fatty, can we ... open up a gap from him?”

Wang Song’s eyes lit up, and he praised, “That’s right! This little fatty indeed can be worked on! As for the Qin Family’s resources, better not touch for the time being.”

...

After entering the Wu Meng Academy, Ye Yuan spent an entire day and had a rough understanding of the Wu Meng Academy.

This was a very loose school. Every day, there were Origin Deity Realm teachers giving lectures.

But whether one went or not depended on their individual wishes.

Want to muck around, that was up to you too.

It was just that, if you think you could hang around in the school by mucking around, that was a big mistake.

In the center of Wu Meng Academy’s plaza, two enormous rocks were placed and were called points stone.

Each student’s points would be displayed on the points stones.

One points stone was for recording inner-court disciples’ points. The other points stone was for recording outer-court disciples’ points.

The numbers on the points stones were updated in real-time. Every bit of change would be recorded on the points stones.

Most important, every ten years, Wu Meng Academy would eliminate the 20 lowest ranked students on the points stones, expelling them from the Wu Meng Academy!

This elimination rate was very high, high until somewhat alarming!

Wu Meng Academy’s students, the oldest was only until 1000 years old.

After 1000 years old, regardless of what level they cultivated to, they could not stay in the academy anymore.

Every 100 years, the academy would recruit around 200 to 500 students.

But every ten years, 20 students would be eliminated.

This was also to say that in these 100 years where no students were recruited, the academy would eliminate 200 students!

Either advance or fall behind!

After entering the academy, students were not allowed to have a hint of slacking off.

These 200 students who were eliminated might not be new students, they might be old students too.

All outer-court disciples took the test together.

In addition, moving about in the academy, points would be continuously expended.

Regardless whether it was cultivating martial techniques, cultivation methods, or exchanging for medicinal pills, it could not dispense with points.

Therefore, if one want to not be eliminated, one must continuously earn points.

There were many ways to earn points, such as doing a mission, such as challenging other students, and such as ... clearing trials!

The academy would issue some missions every day. When students completed missions, they would obtain a fixed points reward.

Challenging students should be a shortcut to earning points. They could amass large sums of points within a short time through continuously challenging other students.

Of course, the prerequisite was that you won all!

This challenging act was not a blind challenge. One could only challenge opponents ranked ten places higher than them on the points stones.

The winner would obtain a certain points reward while the loser would be deducted of points.

If the opponent you challenge was not carrying out a mission to clear challenges, they would have to answer the challenge.

And the third approach, clearing trials ... Ye Yuan was currently outside the Sword Tomb.

The Sword Tomb was Wu Meng Academy’s land of comprehending the sword. It was divided into eighteen levels. With each level passed, one could obtain a certain number of points as a reward.

“This senior apprentice brother, I wish to enter the Sword Tomb, this is my academy token!”

As he said, Ye Yuan handed over a token. This was the identity token that the academy issued to him after he entered the Wu Meng Academy.

Zhao Qin was an inner-court disciple. He accepted this mission of guarding the Sword Tomb several days ago and was satisfied with this work.

Zhao Qin sized Ye Yuan up with a glance and said disdainfully, “New here, right? Do you know this Sword Tomb’s dangers? Your bit of strength going in, you’ll be dismembered in a just a while. I advise that you’d best cultivate a bit first, then go in.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks for Senior Apprentice Brother’s concern. But I’m very interested in this Sword Tomb and still wish to experience it.”

Zhao Qin raised his eyebrow and said, “Heh, it’s up to you if you want to seek your own doom! Entering the Sword Tomb has a one-time deduction of 20 points. You have a month’s time to comprehend the sword. Of course, the prerequisite is that you can comprehend the sword.”

Zhao Qin had a small jade tray in front of him. He swiped Ye Yuan’s academy token on it, and the scornful expression instantly changed.

His eyebrows raised up, looking at Ye Yuan rather disbelievingly as he said, “Hiss ... why would you have so many points? Could it be that ... you’re this season’s new students’ top dog?”

Ye Yuan received the token and said with a smile, “Senior Apprentice Brother is worrying too much. I won these points by gambling. This season’s top dog is someone else.”

Just as they were talking, a figure suddenly dashed out from behind Ye Yuan.

That person handed the token to Zhao Qin and said, “Sword Tomb. I want to enter the Sword Tomb.”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up. This person was none other than precisely this year’s top dog, Qin Shao!

He did not expect that this Qin Shao had the same view as him without prior consultation, coming to the Sword Tomb on the first stop.

Zhao Qin was rather surprised and said, “You all, these newbies, really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. To actually choose the Sword Tomb when you just entered the sect. Heh heh, letting you all suffer some losses are good too.”

Qin Shao received the token from Zhao Qin’s hands and directly entered the Sword Tomb without even giving a greeting.

This guy was unbelievably proud!

But to the Qin Family’s people, Ye Yuan did not have any good feelings too. He naturally had no interest in saying hello.

Ye Yuan thanked Zhao Qin and directly entered the Sword Tomb.

Upon entering the Sword Tomb, Ye Yuan’s gaze suddenly turned intent too.

Entering his sight, it was all swords sprawled disorderly everywhere, too many to count!

“The name of Sword Tomb indeed lives up to its reputation!” Ye Yuan praised.

Ye Yuan had long inquired earlier. This Sword Tomb was the land of sword burial for Wu Meng Academy’s successive generations of sword-wielding experts. It contained boundless sword intent.

He chose this place as the first stop because he wanted to make use of the boundless sword intent here in order to comprehend a Sword Dao belonging just to him!
