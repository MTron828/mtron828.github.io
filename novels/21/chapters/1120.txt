Chapter 1124: Don’t Come and Provoke Me Again!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Above the sky, streams of light spilled over.

A horrifying pressure made everyone’s countenance change.

That was the power of laws belonging to Divine Dao!

“Haha, Ji brat, do you really think that my Holy City’s million-year-old inheritance is to be trifled with? Enjoy the terror of Divine Dao laws to your heart’s content! To be able to die under a divine rank grand array, you can be sufficiently proud!

Cloudsky was incomparably exhilarated in his heart!

Ever since Ye Yuan came to the Holy City, he was constantly being led by the nose. Don’t mention how aggrieved he felt in his heart.

But today, Ye Yuan even killed Guo Xu and the Purple-Gold Hall’s divine king powerhouses, destroying the Holy City’s several hundred years of painstaking effort in a single day.

This enmity was formed huge!

Just allowing Ye Yuan to leave unchecked, how could the two of them be reconciled to it?

The reason why Nangong Zifeng let Ao Qian they all out was in order to drag the time.

Activating the divine rank grand array, the price expended was too great. The time needed was also somewhat long.

Nangong Zifeng knew that ordinary-level attacks were totally useless to Ye Yuan. It could not even touch him.

But under the pressure of Divine Dao, Ye Yuan’s art of greater teleportation was useless too!

“Heh, Ji brat, you’re too conceited! If we let you walk out of the Holy City today, where will we put our old faces still?” Nangong Zifeng said with a cold laugh.

“The Divine Dao grand array has already not been activated before for no idea how many years. This time, making an exception for you. Enjoy this despair well!” Cloudsky followed up.

The Divine Dao pressure in the sky became more and more intense. The feeling that it gave people was like the sky was falling down.

When Ao Qian and the rest saw this scene, each and every one of them involuntarily swallowed their saliva.

They still did not understand up till now, what on earth His Excellency did, to actually incite the Holy City to activate the divine rank grand array!

“My god, it’s really the divine rank grand array activating! Looks like Ji Qingyun really offended the two titans badly.”

“Ji Qingyun’s lineage-ending sword virtually ruined the Holy City’s future. How could they not be furious?”

“Divine rank grand array activating, this time, Ji Qingyun would be hard-pressed to escape even if he grew wings!”

“Tsk tsk, this power! To be able to sense Divine Dao laws in this lifetime, there are no regrets in death too!”

It was the Holy City’s martial artists first time witnessing the might of the Divine Dao grand array. Each and every one of them was incomparably excited.

Ye Yuan’s composure exceeded Cloudsky and Nangong Zifeng’s expectations on the other hand.

In their view, Ye Yuan should have given up all hope currently.

But why was he still so calm?

Could it be that this punk thought that his art of greater teleportation was able to avoid the divine rank grand array?

“You all don’t need to have this going to die expression. All enter the Vast Heaven Pagoda. Leave this divine rank grand array to me!” Ye Yuan said with Ao Qian and the rest with a smile.

Ao Qian’s eyes became wide circles as he said in disbelief, “Milord, this is a divine rank grand array. Could it be that you have ways to deal with it too?”

“Enough nonsense, quickly go in!” Ye Yuan scolded with a smile.

When Nangong Zifeng saw this scene, he said with a cold sneer, “Heh, death is nigh. Still feigning arrogance here!”

Right at this time, the divine rank grand array that accumulated power to await release seemed to have finally finished storing up power.

Everyone knew that horrifying power was already lurking above the nine heavens!

Once it landed, it would surely strike with the force and momentum of a thunderbolt.

“Quickly retreat! Don’t get dragged in by the divine rank grand array’s attack!”

At this time, Ye Yuan was like a god of plague. Everyone avoided him like the plague.

Once this attack landed, nobody knew what would happen either.

As for the Holy City’s people, they had naturally maintained a safe distance from Ye Yuan long ago.

After all, Ye Yuan’s greater teleportation was no joke. What if he lured the attack over to their side? They would turn to ashes.

Whoosh ...

Several dozen multicolored flowing light landed from above the sky, looking just like a sunset, beautiful to the extreme. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

But everyone knew that behind that beauty, there were extremely terrifying Divine Dao laws!

The divine rank grand array finally activated!

These multicolored flowing lights were extremely swift. In virtually a blink of an eye, they landed on top of Ye Yuan’s head.

But right at this moment, Ye Yuan moved!

His figure immediately vanished from where he stood, disappearing without a trace.

However, those multicolored flowing lights flew towards the city gates with even greater speed!

Seeing this scene, Cloudsky and Nangong Zifeng’s expression changed drastically.

They did not think that Ye Yuan wanted to do something to disgust them even on his deathbed.

He actually wanted to borrow the power of this grand array to destroy the Holy City’s gates!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Those dozen over multicolored flowing lights landed on the city gates, directly blasting the impregnable city gates to smithereens!

For a moment, debris flew everywhere.

The Holy City’s walls were all made using special stone materials. It would be hard for Void Mystic powerhouses to even damage it in the slightest.

But this time, it was destroyed by the divine rank grand array!

“Ji Qingyun, this brat, truly deserves death! His death is at hand, and he doesn’t even let people be carefree!” Cloudsky said crossly.

“Forget it. Either way, this brat is dead too. He has two divine artifacts in his hands. It should also be sufficient to match up to the city gates’ losses,” Nangong Zifeng consoled him.

Upon hearing this, Cloudsky’s eyes lit up, and he immediately showed great interest.

The unhappy feelings earlier immediately vanished without a trace.

The dust settled, and the Divine Dao pressure above the sky gradually faded away. Everything returned to how it was.

Everyone was stupefied by the powerful might of these Divine Dao laws!

This was the foundation of the Holy City!

Presently in the Divine Realm, sects that possessed a complete Divine Dao grand array was only the Holy City!

Seeing everyone’s reaction, Cloudsky and Nangong Zifeng exchanged a glance and smiled, clearly very satisfied.

Although they were forced to use the divine rank grand array this time, it also awed all of the martial artists in the Holy City.

This was their foundation!

The negative impact brought by Ye Yuan would be dispelled very soon!

“Come, go over and take a look! The Sacred Dragon Token and that divine sword are both not ordinary items!” Cloudsky said.

Nangong Zifeng nodded his head and followed after as well.

Those Void Mystic powerhouses hiding in the dark also all showed themselves at this time.

“Hahaha, Ji Qingyun, this brat, finally died!” Shi Renhui laughed loudly and walked out.

The power of Divine Dao earlier was too powerful. Shi Renhui felt his heart palpitate even when hiding so far away.

There were absolutely no chances of survival for Ye Yuan under such an attack.

However, just as he approached the city gates, a sudden change occurred!

An unparalleled sword light suddenly came out from within the dust, cleaving straight for Shi Renhui.

He completely did not have any guard up at this time. In his carelessness, he actually did not even open up his divine king domain!

Puchi!

The sword light tore right through the air, splitting Shi Renhui into two halves!

A Void Mystic powerhouse of his generation was actually gone just like that!

This unexpected change was what everyone did not anticipate from start to end.

When Cloudsky and Nangong Zifeng saw this scene, their expressions changed greatly.

This swift and sharp sword, who else could release it apart from Ye Yuan?

“H-He actually didn’t die! Everybody, be careful!”

Cloudsky felt like his scalp was going to explode!

“I had said it before, don’t come and provoke me again! It was you all who broke the agreement first. Don’t blame this young master for not being polite!”

Amidst the dust, Ye Yuan’s voice transmitted out, as if coming from the netherworld, making everyone’s hearts turn cold.
