Chapter 1674 Breakthrough Above Ten Miles!

The energy in the electric snake was being stripped away bit by bit.

Ye Yuan’s body was absorbing energy little by little!

Amidst the incredible pain, Ye Yuan’s entire body radiated with a dazzling light.

Rumble!

Ye Yuan’s golden body became incomparably bright, illuminating the gloomy realm fog space akin to daytime!

The Nine Transformations Golden Body’s fourth transformation was finally completed!

Ye Yuan’s physical body directly broke through the shackles!

Now, Ye Yuan could contend with Divine Lord Realm powerhouses just based on his physical body.

However, it was not over yet!

The crazy Ye Yuan was still stripping away energy and tempering the fleshy body.

He was challenging his limits!

The berserk energy poured into Ye Yuan’s body frenziedly.

Finally, Ye Yuan could not withstand it and let go of the electric snake.

While his fleshy body directly broke through to peak initial-stage fourth transformation!

“Hahaha! Awesome! This electric snake’s energy is really too strong! I only used a little bit, and it can actually let me break through to the fourth transformation!”

After enduring the suffering, Ye Yuan currently felt that he was filled with explosive power.

That invigorating feeling made him unable to refrain from lifting his head to the sky and howling.

Dustless smiled bitterly and said, “It was really accomplished by you, this brat! Truly a freak! Now, you can blow up a third-layered heaven Divine Lord with one punch!”

Peak initial-stage fourth transformation, the strength was comparable to third-layered heaven Divine Lord.

But powerhouses who cultivated the physical body could virtually sweep across those in the same rank!

The power of Ye Yuan’s dragon race martial technique far surpassed ordinary fleshy body powerhouses. Blowing up a third-layered heaven Divine Lord was nothing difficult.

Even facing fourth-layered heaven Divine Lords, he had the strength to fight too!

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “After breaking through this time, my Atavism Dragon Soul awakened again! Now, my fleshy body’s combat strength can finally be put to use!”

Ye Yuan’s dragon race martial technique was mastered through extensive study, his combat strength immediately soared by more than a level.

“Mn? Ye Yuan, look at your golden body. There seem to be some additional profound patterns!” Dustless suddenly said.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, lowering his head and looking at his physical body.

Under the electric snake’s berserk energy, Ye Yuan’s body was long in tattered ruins already.

Ye Yuan discovered to his surprise that there were indeed some blue-colored profound patterns on his physical body.

These blue profound patterns were inlaid into his golden body. If not looking closely, one really could not tell.

“This ... What the hell is this?” Ye Yuan said in surprise.

Dustless shook his head and was also puzzled as he said, “Nine Transformations Golden Body would not have this kind of patterns show up. I don’t know as well. However ... the color of these patterns is very similar to that electric snake. Is it possible that ... inside the energy which you absorbed just now, some attribute inside the electric snake was absorbed over?”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, his scalp could not help tingling.

This electric snake was undoubtedly extremely powerful. Even if encountered by Celestial Deity powerhouses, they would likely turn to ashes instantly too.

Now, getting it onto his body, don’t know if it was a blessing or disaster!

“Forget it, don’t care about it! It’s a blessing if not a calamity. If it’s a calamity, it can’t be avoided!”

As he said, Ye Yuan withdrew the golden light on his body and took out a blue-robe from his storage ring to wear, and continued moving forward.

No idea how long he walked either, it suddenly became bright in front of Ye Yuan. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, the pressure on his body suddenly increased again.

He realized that he could not go any further.

Ye Yuan’s control of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain currently was merely limited to the fourth level.

The further up this Heavenspan Mountain, the more powerful Heavenly Dao’s pressure.

Now, it already reached the limit of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

Going further would be an unknown area for Ye Yuan. Even if he had the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, he would still be crushed into meat paste by Heavenly Dao.

However, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of turning back.

He felt the surrounding spiritual energy and immediately, a feeling of gladdening the heart and refreshing the mind transmitted over.

“What powerful spiritual energy! Breaking through here is the most suitable!” Ye Yuan said with a grin.

Getting to work at once, Ye Yuan did not hesitate, directly sitting down cross-legged, and started digesting the comprehension he had along this ten-mile-road bit by bit.

The Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s fourth level cultivation method’s framework was already built. Now, it was only a matter of understanding it thoroughly.

When the fourth level cultivation method was thoroughly formed, he could break through the shackles in one fell swoop, breaking through to the fourth level realm!

Ye Yuan shut his eyes and meditated, completely isolating the outside world.

Either way, no one dared to attack inside the Heavenspan Mountain. He was not worried that someone would take the chance to deal a blow while he was meditating.

One day, two days ... ten days, 15 days!

In a blink, half a month passed.

Suddenly, a storm came out of nowhere!

Wind formed under Ye Yuan’s feet, gradually forming a spiritual energy vortex.

Then, the vortex became bigger and bigger, the commotion became more and more horrifying.

Rumble!

A shocking aura surged to the sky.

Ye Yuan’s body emitted rays of electric light. The spiritual energy above ten-miles closed in toward Ye Yuan’s place frenziedly.

All around, the Celestial Deity powerhouses who were currently meditating with closed eyes were abruptly startled awake by this surge of powerful aura.

“What’s going on? Somebody is breaking through?”

“Who is breaking through? This commotion is also too frightening, right?”

“Pfft! Is my eyesight failing? That ... That is an Origin Deity Realm martial artist, he ... he’s breaking through to the Divine Lord Realm?”

“It’s really an Origin Deity Realm! My God, where did an Origin Deity Realm come from?”

...

Above ten-miles, the group of Celestial Deity powerhouses burst into an utter uproar.

The Heavenspan Mountain was very calm, calm until even throwing a rock could not stir up a hint of a wave.

Because no one dared to behave atrociously here.

But now, the situation completely exploded!

The commotion of Ye Yuan breaking through was too great, disturbing all of the Celestial Deity powerhouses, causing them to be unable to sit quietly and meditate at all.

This level of Heavenly Dao was thoroughly thrown into disorder by Ye Yuan.

Back then, when Ye Yuan came out of the Martial Tower, the commotion caused was already sufficiently big.

But compared to this time, that paled greatly in comparison.

One had to know, the Heavenspan Mountain was the source of the Heavenspan World. Its spiritual energy was also the most in the entire Heavenspan World.

The spiritual energy here was virtually more than a hundred times of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Back then, when Ye Yuan comprehended the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, the heavens bestowed a blessing. The spiritual energy of the Heavenspan Mountain skyrocketed several times. Until now, it still had not completely dissipated yet.

The Heavenspan Mountain’s spiritual energy could be described as horrifying.

Furthermore, this place was the territory of Celestial Deities. The spiritual energy was far more compared to the territory of Divine Lords to begin with.

Under such an environment, Ye Yuan still caused such a horrifying influence. It could be seen how astonishing his breakthrough this time was.

Moreover, his breakthrough was different from ordinary people. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. Dark clouds gathered overhead. It was simply like the end-of-the-world had descended.

Ye Yuan’s entire being was surrounded by a cloud of thick fog. The Celestial Deity powerhouses could not see clearly at all.

How could this kind of commotion be what an Origin Deity Realm martial artist breaking through should have?

They pointed and gestured to Ye Yuan, each and every one of them with dumbfounded faces, completely ignorant of how this kind of thing could happen.

Even if it were them, Celestial Deity powerhouses breaking through, they were unable to arouse such a terrifying commotion!
