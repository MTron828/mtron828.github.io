Chapter 3026: Using Himself As Bait!

In the Blood God Temple, a group of blood race Hegemons had solemn expressions.

Nobody could have expected that the battle of genocide that supposedly was already in the bag actually failed!

“Bloodpromise, are you a pig? Such a big defeat, you actually did not report the news!” Wang Zuo had nowhere to vent his anger, directly venting his fury on Bloodpromise.

Bloodpromise had an innocent look as he said with a bitter smile, “Lord Wang Zuo, I also didn’t know that Ye Yuan could actually bring so many powerhouses back! When he returned, there was only that monster around him.”

“You still freaking think that you’re in the right?” Wang Zuo shot to his feet and was practically about to make a move. Bloodpromise immediately withered up.

When Bloodsky saw that the atmosphere was a little strange, he spoke up, “Alright. Brother Wang Zuo, Bloodpromise didn’t do it on purpose either. The mother stone is about to come into being right away. It’s the most important thing at this time. Our urgent matter on hand is to defend the Blood God Temple. Ye Yuan brought so many experts back. He’ll definitely attack the Blood God Temple.”

Wang Zuo nodded his head, only then letting it go.

He gave a cold snort and said, “Ye Yuan this punk really lingers on relentlessly! If not for him, we’d have unified Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven a hundred years ago, and the mother stone would have long come into being as well! Damn thing, after the mother stone comes into being, this seat will definitely ground his bones into dust!”

Wang Zuo really hated Ye Yuan to the bones.

Ever since Ye Yuan landed on Heaven One Continent, he had ruined his certain victory plans God knows how many times.

This time, he even brought a large number of Hegemon Realms, causing them a huge crisis.

But, if the mother stone did not come into being, he really could not do anything to Ye Yuan.

Boom!

Before his voice faded, the Blood God Temple shook violently!

The entire space directly had a large hole that was blasted out.

More than 20 Hegemon Realms descended upon the Blood God Temple’s space!

This holy land was a highly guarded secret, but Ye Yuan was very familiar with this place. Finding it was naturally as easy as blowing off dust.

He let Zhou Pinespring bring Cloudmount and the few other heavily injured Hegemons back to West Sun City first, and he brought Long Jian and the rest and directly charged into the Blood God Temple!

“F*ck you, Ye Yuan!” Wang Zuo finally could not resist swearing.

He had not even caught his breath, and Ye Yuan already brought people and rushed over!

More than 20 Hegemon Realms descending, it immediately fought until the sky and earth dimmed.

The battle of Hegemon Realms rarely implicated ordinary people.

But this fight was a battle of genocide. They naturally did not have any more qualms.

Previously, Zhuo Bufan they all launched a life and death great battle in order to block the blood race Hegemons too.

Wang Zuo brought a group of Hegemons and rose up into the air. When he saw Ye Yuan, he could not resist letting loose a torrent of abuse. He said, “Little Saboteur Ye Yuan, this seat can’t coexist under the same sky with you! Today, this seat will tear you to shreds!”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Don’t, Lord Wang Zuo. I’m the Blood Divine Son that you personally picked! It isn’t nice for you to do this, right?”

Wang Zuo almost spewed out a mouthful of old blood and cried out angrily, “Nice your head! Everyone, heed my orders. Kill this little villain at all costs!”

The aggro was drawn to the max.

In an instant, dozens of Hegemons rushed in like a swarm of hornets, the commotion shocking the heavens.

The corners of Long Jian’s mouth twitched slightly, and he said speechlessly, “Just how abominable is this guy? They are completely disregarding casualties!”

Luan Qinghe’s mouth curled, and she said, “This boy can draw aggro naturally! Have you forgotten how many powerhouses this guy provoked in the Eternal River?”

Long Jian smiled bitterly and said, “Truly, once a scar is healed, the pain is forgotten! I almost forgot about this!”

This boy even summoned Great Beyond powerhouses back then.

He, this Supreme Hegemon, nearly knelt down to two mighty Great Beyond powerhouses at that time.

If not for Mi Tian returning, that would not have been resolved.

Feng Xiaotian sneered and said, “This guy didn’t do anything either. He just ran to the blood race and circled one round, became Wang Zuo’s appointed Blood Divine Son, swindled the Chaos Bloodstone’s origin of blood, killed off the blood race’s genius juniors, and then completely wiped out hundreds of thousands of blood race elites. Now, he brought all of your excellencies and killed our way to the Blood God Temple. Wang Zuo naturally wishes to swallow him alive!”

The group of Hegemons exchanged glances, all looking at Ye Yuan with incredible shock.

This kid could really cause trouble!

However, the blood race schemed against all the heavens. Even the dragon race could not escape the misfortune too.

Yet, they suffered losses at the hands of a measly little Emperor Vast Heaven time and again.

Got to admit, Ye Yuan was the blood race’s jinx.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said to Zhuo Bufan with a smile, “Brother Zhuo, among the Hegemon Realms present, just solely in terms of offensive power, you’re the well-deserved number one! Therefore, I’ll have to count on you!”

Zhuo Bufan gave Ye Yuan a meaningful glance and said with a nod, “Rest assured, even if I die, I’ll complete the mission too!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There’s still a fight between you and me. You mustn’t die!”

Everyone was rendered speechless again. You, a freaking Emperor Vast Heaven, talked about fighting with a Supreme Hegemon, really not scared of spraining your tongue from talking big!

But, unexpectedly, Zhuo Bufan just smiled slightly and said, “Okay, I’ll wait for you!”

Clearly, he acknowledged Ye Yuan’s statement.

For some reason, the first time he laid eyes on Ye Yuan, he had a feeling of a fated rival.

Reaching his level of realm, every movement and action was equal to Heavenly Dao.

This kind of fate, only he himself could feel it deeply too.

Just like Yang Qing chasing after Ye Yuan desperately, the goal that Ye Yuan had been chasing after all along was Zhuo Bufan!

He already knew that he and Ye Yuan were both from the Rainclear Continent. Furthermore, they were both ascenders.

Some things could not be avoided. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Finished saying, Zhuo Bufan’s figure gradually faded away, disappearing from the army of Hegemons.

More than 50 Hegemons rushed in like a swarm of hornets just for the sake of killing Ye Yuan. This kind of line-up, even if it was Long Jian they all, they were under considerable pressure too.

After all, Hegemon Realms were not some ants.

Even if it was the most ordinary Hegemon Realm, they were also the pinnacle-most existences in this world.

Unlike in other battles, Wang Zuo and the others’ goal was very clear. It was to kill Ye Yuan!

“Kill!”

Long Jian shouted fiercely, his figure directly turning into a true dragon.

Luan Qinghe did not dare to dawdle either, similarly turning into a Qing?Luan1.

Two great true spirit bloodlines released their full combat power at this moment.

Facing this horrifying battle, Ye Yuan stood proudly in the sky, his expression unchanging.

Zhao Yue guarded closely beside him, helping him to block the aftershocks of the Hegemon battles.

He was intentionally standing here to be a target, in order to attract Wang Zuo’s attention, creating an opening for Zhuo Bufan!

This was the battle strategy that Ye Yuan planned before coming here.

Zhuo Bufan only had one mission, which was to finish off the Chaos Bloodstone!

The blood race Hegemons all seemed to have gone crazy. They attacked the ranks frenziedly. Even if they were facing Supreme Hegemons, they were fearless too.

In a blink, the blood race had more than ten Hegemons that were blown apart. But they revived again right away and continued attacking.

Wang Zuo and Bloodsky two people took the lead and erupted with all their strength.

They had already entered a frenzied state, just for the sake of killing Ye Yuan!

Finally, under the frenzied assault of more than 50 Hegemons, the ranks on Ye Yuan’s side had a gap that was opened up.

Wang Zuo’s two eyes lit up, and he laughed wildly as he said, “Ye Yuan, this time, I see if you still don’t die!”

“Damn it!” Long Jian secretly cursed and rushed over without heed for anything.

A streak of bloody light tore across the sky, flying straight for Ye Yuan!
