Chapter 1287: Turbulent Spatial Flow!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Senior Skydistant, Senior Fang Tian, after Ye Yuan leaves, the Divine Realm will have to trouble you all to take care of it!” Ye Yuan clasped his hands at the two and said.

Finally, the time to leave still came. Leaving his homeland, Ye Yuan also had a myriad of feelings well up in his heart for a moment too.

This place had what he was worried about, had his fetters. No matter where he went to, this was his home.

Regarding his home, Ye Yuan was naturally very concerned about his posthumous coverage.

Fang Tian said, “Go on, rest assured about the Divine Realm’s matters. With Skydistant and me around, they can’t stir up any large waves. There’s also Lu Linfeng. He went to find Cao Yunzhi the other day as well, taking the initiative to request to serve as the Law Enforcement Hall’s guest elder.”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised as he said, “I didn’t expect that this guy would actually do such a thing.”

The Grand Yan Divine King had always moved independently. Apart from taking in a disciple, he had never joined any faction before and was completely indifferent to the Divine Realm’s matters as well.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that he would actually take the initiative to request to join the Law Enforcement Hall.

Skydistant smiled and said, “Isn’t this still on account of your face? He’s giving a plum in return for a peach here, returning your life-saving grace!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and did not say anything.

With so many powerhouses holding down the fort, presumably, no major storms should appear in the Divine Realm. He could also leave with peace of mind.

“Senior Long Teng, on this journey, thank you very much for your care!”

Ye Yuan gave a deep bow toward Long Teng.

Long Teng was a teacher-like friend to Ye Yuan and helped Ye Yuan tremendously.

Previously, in order to let Ye Yuan escape, Long Teng even did not hesitate his soul disintegrating to resist Kanuo. How could Ye Yuan not be moved?

“Go on, go on, but you must take care!” Old Teng had tears running down his aged face as he said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head solemnly and came before White Light.

The two people grasped hands and had a big bear hug.

Between brothers, there was no need for too many words. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Big Brother, you can go with peace of mind. I’ll work hard on cultivation. When you restore the Divine Realm’s Heavenly Dao one day, I’ll go to the Heavenspan World to find you!” White Light said firmly.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Good brother! I’ll wait for you in the Heavenspan World!”

By the side, Lu-er was long already sobbing until tears poured down.

“Young Master, Lu-er ... can’t bear to leave you! Sniff, sniff ...”

Ye Yuan pulled Lu-er into his embrace. Lightly stroking her hair, he said, “Good Lu-er, you cultivate well too. When you break through to the Deity Realm, Young Master will definitely fetch you to the Heavenspan World, alright?”

Lu-er pushed Ye Yuan away and said with teary eyes, “Young Master, you have to keep your word!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “When have Young Master lied to you before?”

Lu-er smiled through tears and said, “I knew that Young Master is the best! Young Master, rest assured; Lu-er will definitely cultivate well and strive to break through to the Deity Realm as soon as possible!”

Yue Mengli still had an indifferent expression, as if nothing could move her.

Except, that hint of sadness and reluctance to part in her eyes could not be concealed no matter what.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Li-er, you too.”

Li-er’s expression dimmed. She nodded and lightly hummed.

Looking at Li-er’s eyes, Ye Yuan felt his mind filled with a myriad of thoughts and was actually speechless.

Ye Yuan understood that if they had to compete to see who was better, among these people, the one who could not bear for him to leave the most would be Li-er.

But, in order to not make him worry, she stubbornly endured it.

This girl, he really had nothing to nitpick with.

Ye Yuan opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but he did not say it.

At this time, any words were feeble.

With this departure, life and death were hard to predict, weal and woe unknown.

That was a completely foreign world. They did not know, Ye Yuan similarly did not know.

Just like entering the Godsfall Mountain Range back then, Ye Yuan seriously could not give them any promise.

“I’m going!”

Ye Yuan hardened his heart, turned around, and flew towards that World Locking Gate.

Li-er’s tears could not hold back anymore and burst out. She shouted at Ye Yuan’s back view: “Big Brother Yuan, Li-er will go and find you! You must take good care of yourself!”

Ye Yuan’s figure paused, but gritted his teeth and refused to turn his head back, his figure finally vanishing behind the World Locking Gate.

He was afraid, afraid that he did not have the courage to leave.

When Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared from her line of sight, Li-er’s entire person seemed to have been sapped of strength, falling down weakly.

Lu-er was startled and hurriedly supported her, similarly complaining tearfully, “Big Sister Li-er, you have to hang on! Young Master ... Young Master, he’ll definitely be fine!”

Li-er’s tears were like floodwaters that broke the dam, drenched a peerlessly beautiful face.

“I know ... I know! He’ll definitely be fine!” Li-er choked.

The two sisters hugged their heads and cried bitterly. When everyone by the side saw this scene, they all could not hold back tears from trickling down their cheeks.

What they could do was only to pray, pray that Ye Yuan was able to survive the turbulent spatial flow.

...

In front of Ye Yuan was a murky gray space, no direction, no sounds.

What there was, was just violent energy undulations.

Ye Yuan heard Kunwu say before, this turbulent spatial flow was actually a sea of space, pieced together and formed by countless spatial fragments.

The friction and fluctuations between the spatial fragments would produce incomparably violent energy, wiping out everything in the sea of space.

Of course, this kind of energy had strong and weak types.

Strong ones, even if it was a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, they could obliterate too.

Weak ones, it was nine chances to die and one chance to live for Grotto Profound Deity Realm powerhouses too.

Right now, Ye Yuan had just passed through the World Locking Gate. The turbulent spatial flow was not very strong yet.

Following his penetration deep inside, these energy storms would become stronger and stronger.

All the way until the end, utterly obliterating him.

Want to shuttle back and forth in the turbulent spatial flow safely, one must have at least True God Realm strength!

Hence, that was why Kunwu said that Ye Yuan entering the turbulent spatial flow was certain death.

That group of people 100 thousand years ago relied on safety in numbers, under their teaming up, that was how they had an additional ray of hope.

Kunwu said, even if they were really able to pass through the turbulent spatial flow, to have five people remaining was already considered pretty good.

Of course, this was still an optimistic estimation.

The greatest likelihood was still not a single one left!

Therefore, Ye Yuan, a rookie who had just broken through to Deity Realm, wanting to pass through the turbulent spatial flow, could virtually be said to be a fool’s talk!

This turbulent spatial flow, the most dangerous was still not these violent energies, but those spatial fragments.

Once bumped into by those spatial fragments, even Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse would be shredded into pieces by the unstable spatial fragments too!

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and shrunk the Domain of Sword to a radius of ten feet. At the same time, an earth-yellow light flooded on his body, revolving the Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art, his figure shooting out akin to an arrow that left the string!

After breaking through to Deity Realm, Ye Yuan’s defense could truly use powerful to describe already.

The Domain of Sword and Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art evoked with Deity Realm, the power could not be mentioned in the same breath.

One had to know that even the Origin Deity Realm Zuo Zong back then was unable to do anything to Skydistant. How powerful the defensive strength of this cultivation method was, it could be imagined.

Entering the sea of space, countless violent energies assailed from all directions.

The tiny figure of Ye Yuan was instantly drowned out.

Only at this time did he truly understand why Kunwu was not optimistic about him.
