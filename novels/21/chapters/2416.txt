Chapter 2422: Unpredictable Army Moving Out!

“Lord Yue Feng actually knelt down too!”

“Who on earth is this Lord Saint Azure?”

“Xiu Yun, didn’t you say that he came from an imperial city? But these few in front are clearly all old monsters who had lived for countless years!”

... ...

At this time, Xiu Yun was also somewhat doubting his own judgment.

Could it be that the things he investigated before were all misconceptions?

The scenes that happened before his eyes were seriously too puzzling and shocking.

Ye Yuan gave Yue Feng a beating, but now, Yue Feng turned around and directly knelt in front of Ye Yuan with a pious look.

It was if Ye Yuan was not a person, but a god!

A genuine god!

But Ye Yuan was clearly just a Heavenly Emperor Realm expert.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. Looking at Yue Feng, he said in a solemn voice, “Since your ancestor experienced the last epoch, then you should know even more that the human race’s today wasn’t easy to come by! You want to stay reclusive; there’s nothing wrong with it. But do you think that the divine race will let you live a sequestered life with peace of mind?”

Yue Feng had a fearful look, lying prostrate on the ground, not daring to move rashly.

When Ye Yuan saw his appearance, he found it hateful and pitiful, and said, “Forget it. You still remember your ancestor. So at least you have some sense of shame. I’ll spare your life today! Whether you want to resist the divine race or not, you weigh and consider it yourself. If you really feel that you can stay aloof from the affair, being a carefree immortal is good too.”

After he finished talking, he went straight down the mountain.

Yue Feng’s entire body trembled, not daring to say a word.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually the legendary Saint Azure!

The family teachings that his ancestor passed down was that Azure and Profound two people were virtuous saints through the ages, founding the great age of humanity.

It was just that the era was too long ago, he only took it as a legend. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He did not expect that there was really such a thing!

What he did not expect even more was that Saint Azure was actually a fine young man!

Although it was fantastical, he knew that this could not possibly be fake.

Being able to make a rule powerhouse so respectful, Ye Yuan must be Saint Azure without a doubt!

But why would Saint Azure appear in this era?

This matter, he could not figure out after racking his brains.

... ...

During the course of Ye Yuan conquering Eight Void Mountain’s grand array, the outside world was already fighting fiercely.

The land of Western Realms was presently already a stretch of scorched earth.

Deva Realm powerhouses moved out one after another. They really fought until mountains collapsed and the earth fissured apart, long rivers getting cut off.

Countless spiritual lands and countless creatures were all wiped out.

However, the myriad races coalition forces were fighting as they retreated.

Although there were losses, they were not heavy.

Furthermore, the vast majority of the time, it was the human race charging in front, the other races had nothing to say.

At this time, hundreds of Deva Fourth and Fifth Blight powerhouses were currently in a bloody battle with the divine race’s top masters.

This battle was already fought until space collapsed and storms were raging.

“Hahaha, the present human race is really too weak! Your dozen over Deva Fifth Blights joined forces and can’t even deal with me! Back in the days, beneath the 18 grand ancestors, there were as many powerhouses as clouds! There were even quite a number of powerhouses who could compete with this progenitor! But today, you all are too weak!”

In the heat of the battle, Daymeld let out a burst of loud laughter, full of contempt toward the myriad races’ experts.

He alone tied down 14 Deva Fifth Blight powerhouses.

Even so, he still accomplished it with ease.

This level of strength simply made the various races’ powerhouses despaired.

Reaching Deva Realm and Nine-marks this level, the might of the divine race truly revealed.

This series of confrontations fought until the human race did not have any strength to fight back.

Many Deva Realm experts had fallen.

In contrast, the divine race’s casualties were much fewer.

It was also that the coalition forces had a large number of experts, purely using numbers to resist Daymeld.

Otherwise, with Daymeld’s strength, he would have long killed these Deva Fifth Blight powerhouses several times over.

The various races’ Fifth Blight powerhouses all had livid expressions, but they were powerless to refute.

Although it was just an astonishing grand plan that Ye Yuan laid down this time, the strength displayed by the divine race still made them despair.

Especially Heavenly Dao True Martial, once it was executed, it was really killing gods if gods blocked, killing Buddha if Buddha blocked.

Its amplification of the divine race powerhouses’ strength was too terrifying!

If there was no Eight Void Mountain’s grand array, this kind of confidence, they might be completely defeated after a battle.

“Commander, we almost can’t hold out any longer!”

“Patriarch, we’re about to fail!”

... ...

Behind, the commanders of the coalition forces shouted out one after another, their voices full of despair.

Those who knew about this plan were only those high-level powerhouses.

The despair that the rest showed was not fake!

Ni Xuan’s expression changed several times and he said in a cold voice, “Continue retreating!”

The commander shouted, “But Commander-in-Chief, it’s Eight Void Mountain at the back! Any further back and we won’t have any path anymore!”

Ni Xuan gritted his teeth and said, “Just retreat as you’re told! What’s with all the nonsense? Otherwise, you can fight to the death with the divine race!”

That commander had nothing more to say, he could only retreat as he fought.

When Daymeld saw the situation, he laughed loudly and said, “Weak! Really weak! Don’t you humans even have an elite force?”

Ni Xuan’s expression was very ugly, but he still retreated.

The army retreated as they fought, and very soon they arrived at the foot of Eight Void Mountain.

At this time, the divine race army already surrounded the coalition forces tightly like an iron bucket. There was no way to retreat at all.

Either go up the mountain and get killed by the grand array.

Or fight to the bitter end with the divine race!

Of course, the outcome was still being killed!

A subordinate asked Ni Xuan, “Commander-in-Chief, what should we do now?”

Ni Xuan had a dark look as he said, “What else can we do? Break through!”

“But we’ve already been surrounded! There’s no way out at all!”

Ni Xuan gritted his teeth and said, “Find it! I don’t believe that such a large Eight Void Mountain, they can seal off all of the paths!”

The subordinate received the order and left. Very soon, news came over.

The subordinate reported to Ni Xuan with an excited look and said, “Commander-in-chief really has godlike foresight! The divine race indeed missed out a path! We can break through from there!”

Ni Xuan sighed emotionally in his heart. How could it be him who had godlike foresight? It was Lord Saint Azure who foretold it with godlike accuracy!

In order to force out Lord Saint Azure, the divine race really did it according to Lord Saint Azure’s plan and dropped into the pit bit by bit.

Of course, he would not show it on his face. His eyes just flashed and he said, “Pass down the order! Have the unpredictable army blaze the trail and carve out a bloody path! We’ll charge out!”

The unpredictable army was their final trump card!

The moment the subordinates heard this, they knew that it was time for the decisive battle. All of them were extremely excited.

Actually, the subordinates had long suggested sending out the unpredictable army, but Ni Xuan refused to loosen up.

Now, he finally relented!

It was just that how could they all, these ordinary soldiers, know the true significance of the unpredictable army!

“Kill!”

Pang Zhen took the lead. Wan Zhen worked in concert from the side. Places that the unpredictable army passed through, all obstacles were swept away!

When they moved out again, the combat power of the unpredictable army already rose several levels.

The cooperation between them and their individual combat power both obtained huge improvements. Even more so, there was a batch of people who already transcended the Deva blight tribulation, becoming Deva Realm powerhouses!

Pang Zhen and Wan Zhen were two of them!

Their strength, once they entered Deva, their combat power skyrocketed.

Over there, obtaining the news that the unpredictable army moved out, Daymeld could not help being overjoyed.

“Hahaha ... Ni Xuan that brat finally can’t maintain his composure anymore! This progenitor wants to see this time. Whether that Ye Yuan can really have supernatural powers or not! Everyone, heed this order! Give up on encircling and attacking the myriad races coalition forces’ main force, focus all power on besieging the unpredictable army! All Nine-marks powerhouses, move out! You must kill Ye Yuan for me!” Daymeld dispatched the order loudly.
