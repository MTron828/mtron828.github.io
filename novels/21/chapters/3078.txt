Chapter 3077: Returning to the Sect!

“Are the two of you hurrying on your way? Do you want a ride?” Ye Yuan looked at the two great supremacies and said with a relaxed expression.

Hegemon Samsara’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Boy, forming an irreconcilable enmity with this progenitor isn’t some wise move! Every day that you don’t step into Great Beyond Realm, it will be one day that you don’t have the qualifications to challenge this ancestor!”

But, the current Hegemon Samsara was an old man who had experienced many vicissitudes of life.

That pair of bright eyes seemed to be able to see through everything in the world.

It was just that powerhouses from all heavens were watching, and Ye Yuan kicked him in the face. It was very ugly.

The Bloodstone also spoke up, saying angrily, “Ye Yuan brat, after returning this time, this progenitor will do my best to destroy Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! You have to be prepared!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a smile, “Is this how you talk to your savior? With your tolerance, how will you guys rule the heavens?”

Next to Ye Yuan, many people were all desperately holding in their laughter.

Although Ye Yuan had suspicions of playing with fire and burning himself, looking at the two great supremacies getting deflated was still a very pleasant thing, especially that these two great supremacies were not on friendly terms.

Hegemon Samsara stared at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Ye Yuan, you think that you can hide from this progenitor’s arcane eyes with your bit of cunning? You’re still a bit too inexperienced to fight with this progenitor! You want to make the three of us tie each other down, so as to buy time to grow up. You counted your chickens before they hatched! Now, you’re the common enemy of the three of us! After this ancestor returns to my position, the first thing that I’m going to do is to kill you!”

Chaos Bloodstone also said, “Kid, you’re already Emperor Sakra Heaven! Do you think that this progenitor will still give you time to grow up? You’re probably thinking too much!”

With two great overlords being unanimous and actually wanting to join hands to deal with Ye Yuan, this made everyone quake in their boots.

This was no joke!

......

Although these two great supremacies struggled immensely in the Eternal River, it was precisely because of this that made their strength even more evident.

At this time, the strength that these two great supremacies exhibited made them feel suffocated!

This was true strength that was about to transcend the Great Beyond Realm!

Who knew that Ye Yuan did not care at all, saying with a light smile, “You guys had better consider how to recover your strength first! If my guesses are right, the two of you are seriously injured this time, and your main bodies also have to enter the Eternal River. You’ll definitely suffer great damage. Even at this time, when your Dao foundations will be damaged or not is hard to say, you actually still have spare time to come and threaten me. Once your Dao foundations suffer damage, no matter how exceedingly formidable your means, it will be impossible to transcend the Great Beyond too!”

Being exposed by Ye Yuan, the two great supremacies turned somewhat angry from embarrassment.

Just as Ye Yuan said, the two of them were already struggling to save their own skin. How could they have the energy to come and deal with Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan scheming against the three great supremacies this time could be said to be extremely successful.

“Alright, since the two of you have unmatched powers, you don’t need this Ye. Then I’ll be making a move first.” Finished saying, Ye Yuan brought everyone and actually overtook the two great supremacies.

In the Eternal River, Ye Yuan’s speed of advancement was extremely fast, even faster than the two great supremacies.

Everyone exchanged glances, feeling great admiration in their hearts.

Posturing without leaving a trace, flicking his sleeves, and leaving afterward!

Ye Yuan was really too impressive!

Watching Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Hegemon Samsara’s expression was very grim.

“Can’t let this boy continue to grow up unchecked! This boy cultivates chaos. His destiny is heaven-defying. Once he breaks through to Hegemon Realm, it will be difficult for you and me to deal with him as well!” Samsara said in a solemn voice.

“After going back this time, this ancestor will gather the blood race members across the heavens, and besiege Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! I won’t rest until I kill Ye Yuan! Really didn’t expect that this boy would actually grow to such a level. If I had known it would come to this, this progenitor should have killed him back then at all costs!”

The Chaos Bloodstone’s intestines were green with regret.

Back then, if he did his utmost, killing a puny little Ye Yuan would naturally be like taking something out of his own pocket.

But at that time, he had many misgivings, resulting in missing the opportunity.

Who knew that in a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan was already Emperor Sakra Heaven!

At present, although Ye Yuan had not fully grown up yet, he could already sufficiently stand alone.

After they recovered from their injuries and exited seclusion, no idea to what extent Ye Yuan would grow.

Hegemon Samsara’s gaze flickered, and he said, “You don’t have to regret it either. Whether or not he can grow up is still unknown! Don’t you forget, before Hegemon Realm, he still has a shocking great tribulation!”

The Chaos Bloodstone shuddered, and he said, “You mean … the Hegemon Dao Tribulation?”

Hegemon Samsara nodded and said, “That’s right! This boy is going against heaven. His strength can be rated as monstrous! His Hegemon Dao Tribulation is bound to shock heaven and earth! If he makes it through this hurdle, you and I might not be able to do anything to him. But wanting to make it through this hurdle is easier said than done!”

The Chaos Bloodstone seemed a little excited as he said, “You’re right! Since ancient times, how many geniuses have there been? But there has never been a divergent cultivator who could overcome the Hegemon Dao Tribulation!?Hahaha?… brat, just you be smug! The faster you cultivate, the quicker you’ll die too! However, this progenitor is still not giving him the chance to assault Hegemon Realm! This progenitor will definitely be destroying Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

… . .

At Extreme Medicine Sect, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Mi Tian and Cloudmount, two people, stood on top of the mountain, straining their eyes and looking into the distance. Their hearts weighed down with worry.

Over 20 years ago, Mi Tian already arrived in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. It was for the sake of learning about Ye Yuan’s news at the first moment.

Ye Yuan’s departure was several decades long. To this day, there was no news. Mi Tian was very worried.

“There’s no news after so long. Could Ye Yuan …” Cloudmount’s eyes revealed sorrow.

There was no news from the geniuses from all heavens.

This was the worst news!

This indicated that the Labyrinth Divine Palace was indeed fishy!

Old Man Heavenless was not easy to get along with!

Mi Tian was also ladened with anxieties as he said, “Alas, I was too greedy! I knew long ago that this trip was incredibly dangerous, I should have stopped him back then!”

Cloudmount said, “Senior, you don’t need to blame yourself. Don’t you know what that boy is like? The things that he decided, even if the sky falls down, nobody can stop him too! Although this boy didn’t say it, I know that him going to the Labyrinth Divine Palace, half of it is to search for chaos heavenly medicines for me.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Mi Tian sighed and said, “This progenitor watched Heavenless that brat grow up! He’s amazingly gifted! If we were to find another genius that can rival Ye Yuan in this world, then there’s only Heavenless! Now, there’s no news for several decades, Ye Yuan is probably … fraught with grim possibilities!”

Although Mi Tian’s strength could not compare to Heavenless, his seniority was even older than Heavenless.

He and the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s old palace master, there was a friendship with complete mutual understanding.

It was also precisely because of this that he knew about Heavenless’ talent and scheming mind even more.

Originally, he was the same as the powerhouses of all heavens, harboring a fluke mentality, thinking that Heavenless had already died in the Eternal River.

But looking at it now, they were too naive!

Cloudmount choked as he said, “I, this bunch of old bones, am really good-for-nothing! If my strength is still there, I’ll definitely personally go to the Labyrinth Divine Palace to ensure his safety! But …”

The two old men’s tears shed in the Extreme Medicine Sect.

And right at this time, a group of small black dots appeared on the horizon.

Mi Tian’s entire body trembled, seeing Ye Yuan, who was right at the front at one glance.

“Senior Mi Tian, Master, Ye Yuan is back!”

The Extreme Medicine Sect seethed with excitement!
