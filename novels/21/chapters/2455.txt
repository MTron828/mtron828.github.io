Chapter 2461: You Shouldn’t Have Come!

“Fellow Daoist Wing, you’re currently a member of our generation too. Your horizons should be placed further. You refining pills for the few of us, it’s for the human race’s overall situation. We’re eliminating traitors similarly for humanity’s good. I know that your relationship with Ye Yuan is good, but his talent is too strong. His betrayal poses too great a threat to us. That’s why we have no choice but to resort to such means!”

Ancestor Fire Weng Xian’s expression did not change and his heart did not race, but he continued to persuade Sacred Ancestor High Priest with earnest words and the best intentions.

That appearance was like he was standing on the moral high ground.

“Further my ass! Weng Xian, this farther of yours won’t believe your nonsense anymore! Ye Yuan will betray the human race? Heh heh, even if the few of you old things die out and there’s only him left in this Heavenspan World, he won’t betray the human race too! Very good! This ancestor hasn’t fought with a same rank powerhouse after attaining Dao. Today, this ancestor will measure how strong a Dao Ancestor is!”

Wing gave a cold laugh, the imposing aura on his body suddenly erupting. The power of rules bloomed in an instant.

Boom!

With one punch, heaven and earth shook.

Two great rule powerhouses faced off in an instant just like that!

Sacred Ancestor High Priest attacked in anger, his power boundless.

Except, his foundation was ultimately not as deep as Ancestor Fire’s.

Around Ancestor Fire, terrifying flames virtually burned a large hole in the void.

Each move carried extremely terrifying energy undulations.

In a twinkle, he suppressed Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Seeing this scene, the corners of Lin Huan’s mouth could not help revealing a hint of a smile, and he looked at Wan Zhen and said, “Did you think that you were saved? It’s useless! No one in this world can save someone from Origin Enlighten Mountain!”

As he said, he picked up a Devastation Bone Gnawing Knife and suddenly stabbed toward Wan Zhen.

But right then, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

A streak of cold light suddenly appeared from the void.

Carrying a swift and fierce to the extreme sharp edge, it shot toward Lin Huan.

Pffft!

Lin Huan did not even have time to react and was directly pierced through by this streak of cold light.

A tremendous force directly carried Lin Huan flying out, nailing him onto a rock.

Lin Huan opened both eyes wide, his gaze full of disbelief.

Gurgles of blood were flowing out of his mouth, his entire body twitching.

Everyone was stunned by this streak of cold light.

Too fast!

Fast until no one reacted to it!

Even Lin Huan, this Deva Fifth Blight supreme powerhouse, got hit without any reaction.

Furthermore, this sword shuttled through the void, the speed swift to the extreme.

By the time Lin Huan reacted, the sword already arrived in front of his chest.

At this time, no matter how fast his speed was, it was also impossible to avoid it anymore.

A sharp-eyed person recognized the origin of this sword and immediately cried out in surprise, “S-Sword of Spacetime! It’s Ye Yuan’s Sword of Spacetime! Saint Azure Ye Yuan came!”

His voice had yet to fade when a figure stepped out of the void, arriving beside Wan Zhen.

Who was it if not Ye Yuan?

With Ye Yuan appearing, everyone exclaimed in surprise.

“He … He really came!”

“He actually really dared to come!”

“Hang on! How did he become so strong?”

“Yeah! Back then, his full power sword barely managed to harm Lin Huan. This time, he actually pierced through him with one sword!”

… …

The powerhouses all over the mountain were extremely shocked.

They were first shocked by Ye Yuan’s courage. But very soon, they discovered that something was not right.

Ye Yuan had once used the same move against Lin Huan before.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At that time, he only barely managed to hurt Lin Huan.

But just how long had passed? Ye Yuan actually nailed the Deva Fifth Blight Lin Huan onto the rock with one sword!

Looking at Lin Huan’s appearance, he had clearly already sustained serious injuries and did not even have the strength to fight anymore.

This improvement was also a little too terrifying, right?

The thing that Wan Zhen was most worried about still happened.

Unless Ye Yuan did not know about this, if he knew, he would definitely come!

“Pang Zhen! You … Why did you have to tell His Excellency!” Wan Zhen looked at the Pang Zhen behind Ye Yuan as he said furiously.

Pang Zhen had an awkward look, but Ye Yuan said coolly, “A brother encounters adversity; how can I stand by and watch him die?”

Wan Zhen let out a sigh and said weakly, “Your Excellency, you … you shouldn’t have come!”

Ye Yuan did not speak, suddenly hitting a palm on Wan Zhen’s body.

A torrential-like divine essence poured into Wan Zhen’s body crazily.

Those Devastation Bone Gnawing Knives were shaken by these divine essence and were actually pulled out at the same time, being suspended in the air.

Ye Yuan pointed with his fingertip. The Devastation Bone Gnawing Knife plunged into Lin Huan’s heart-area with a swoosh.

“Ahhh!!”

Lin Huan cried out miserably, struggling incessantly in pain.

It was just that his body was nailed onto the rock. He could not break free at all.

The more he struggled, the more painful it was.

It was as if Ye Yuan did nothing at all, looking at Wan Zhen and said smilingly, “You know that there’s no way I won’t come. Furthermore, even if Pang Zhen didn’t say it, I’ll know very soon too. They laid down such a huge scheme, wasn’t it to let me know?”

While talking, his fingertip pointed again.

Another knife tore through the air and plunged into Lin Huan’s body.

“Ahhh! I-It’s killing me! I … I’m going to die! Y-Ye Yuan, I-I beg you, let me go!”

Lin Huan did not have Wan Zhen’s mettle. With two knives entering the body, he was almost collapsing.

That sort of pain that entered the marrows made him prefer to commit suicide.

He could not care that much anymore, he wanted to ask Ye Yuan for mercy.

Ye Yuan ignored him and instead, pointed with his fingertip again.

Another knife!

Lin Huan felt as if there were ten thousand ants devouring his body.

That sort of pain simply made people unable to pray for life, nor beg for death.

He knew that the Devastation Bone Gnawing Knife was very painful, but he never expected that it was actually agonizing to such a degree.

When the powerhouses all over the mountain saw this scene, each and every one of them drew a cold breath.

They witnessed Ye Yuan’s cold-blooded side.

The current Ye Yuan gave them a feeling of shivering without it being cold.

Facing those who hurt his friends, he would return it double.

Furthermore, as an alchemy path overlord, his knives were much more precise than Lin Huan’s.

He knew where to hit to make it more painful!

Ye Yuan helped Wan Zhen down and handed him to Pang Zhen. Then he gave in a medicinal pill in passing and said, “Give this to him, you take care of him.”

As he said, he turned to look at the Sacred Ancestor High Priest who was battling in the sky and yelled, “Stop fighting. Come down and save people.”

When Sacred Ancestor High Priest heard that, he hurriedly withdrew from the battlefield and came howling down.

Ancestor Fire did not pursue either. Their goal was Ye Yuan. Sacred Ancestor High Priest was not important.

Ye Yuan came. So he did not have a need to fight to the death with Wing.

When Sacred Ancestor High Priest came down to see Ye Yuan, his expression was very ugly and he said in a deep voice, “You punk, why did you come? Don’t you know that this is a scheme targeting you?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I know, but you know that I can’t possibly watch them die for me!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest frowned and said, “But do you think that by coming, they will let them go? They will still use these people to threaten you!”

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a smile, “They won’t!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest was taken aback, not knowing where Ye Yuan’s confidence came from.

“Ahhh!!”

There was another scream, Ye Yuan sent out another knife while talking.
