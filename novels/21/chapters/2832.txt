Chapter 2838: Getting Slapped!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan looked at Hegemon Cloudmount and sighed as he said, “Senior Cloudmount, just what do you want before you’re willing to give up?”

Cloudmount grinned and said, “Very simple, a competition! If you win, this seat will leave right away! If I win, you’ll be this seat’s disciple obediently! Otherwise, heh heh …”

Cloudmount looked toward Zuo Chen with an unfriendly expression, while the latter’s beck shrank back.

Why am I always the one getting hurt?

“A-Ancestor, making Ye Yuan compete with you, this is too bullying!” Zuo Chen could not resist saying.

Cloudmount snorted coldly and said, “Would this seat bully a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven? Kid, this seat will compete in Dao elucidation with you, the Dao elucidation of grade five heavenly medicines! As for what kind of heavenly medicines, feel free to choose!”

Cloudmount’s domineering appearance really resembled Ye Yuan a little.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Okay, I agree to it! However, acknowledging you as my master or not can’t be determined by winning or losing!”

Cloudmount’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Then how do we decide?”

Ye Yuan said, “As long as you can convince me, I’ll naturally acknowledge you as my master. Otherwise, there’s no talk!”

Cloudmount smiled coldly and said, “Bullsh*t! You’re all talk but no promises. Even if this seat beats you, if you refuse to admit it, what can this seat do to you?”

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said, “This Ye still has this bit of integrity! You’re an alchemy overlord to begin with. Winning against me is within reason. But if you don’t win me by much, why should I acknowledge you as my master?”

Cloudmount thought about it and nodded as he said, “You make some sense! Alright, do as you say! I reckon that you can’t play any tricks in front of this seat either!”

Ye Yuan naturally did not have the intention to play tricks. Hegemon Cloudmount had already come in person. Ye Yuan was still slightly touched in his heart.

At present, he was already clear about how great the disparity was between Hegemon and Saint Sovereign Heaven.

In the eyes of Hegemon Realms, Emperor Sakra Heaven were just ants, let alone Saint Sovereign Heavens?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan also understood that at this point, it was likely impossible for Ye Yuan to want to refuse it anymore.

Ye Yuan had pride, but it did not mean that he was stupid.

Under the circumstances where there was no great life-and-death enmity, why was there a need to offend a Hegemon Realm powerhouse?

Ye Yuan also felt it. Cloudmount attached quite a lot of importance to him. It was completely different from Zuo Chen’s attitude before.

He felt that the problem was with the Blood of Flame Crystal.

Ye Yuan spent quite a lot of time and effort on this formula before developing it.

Even if it was Zuo Chen, he only felt that the reason why Ye Yuan could come up with the Blood of Flame Crystal was that he could get the blood race’s blood essence.

It showed that his horizons were insufficient, and his cultivation base was still not enough!

But Cloudmount was different. As a Hegemon Realm, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s alchemy overlord, how could he not even have this bit of visual prowess?

Hence, Ye Yuan also wanted to see how big the gap between him and an overlord was!

Ye Yuan did not talk rubbish either, directly pulling out an Unadorned Golden Lotus.

Unadorned Golden Lotus was a very precious grade five heavenly medicine. It contained extremely complicated rule fragments.

The so-called Dao elucidation was drawing out the rule fragments in heavenly medicines and displaying it in front of people.

The more that was shown, it naturally meant the stronger the heavenly alchemist’s strength.

You could only draw it out if you grasped this portion of rule fragment.

Ye Yuan’s technique naturally went without saying.

The Unadorned Golden Lotus in his hand was like a flower, slowly blooming.

The multi-colored rule fragments presented themselves in an orderly manner before Zuo Chen and Cloudmount’s eyes.

Zuo Chen’s pupils constricted. Only then did he understand what Ye Yuan meant by saying that he had touched the threshold of profound grade!

This kid already had half a foot into profound grade. He was only a foot away from entering the door!

Of course, it was also this step to enter the door that became Ye Yuan’s current bottleneck.

He wanted to enter the Extreme Medicine Sect and read extensively, precisely for the sake of breaking this shallow layer of a bottleneck.

Ye Yuan breaking through to profound grade was only a matter of time.

Even if he did not enter the Extreme Medicine Sect, he believed that before long, he could puncture this layer of window pane paper too!

This kid was too heaven-defying!

He was just middle Saint Sovereign Heaven!

‘What Cloudmount saw was naturally even more different.

His face was very calm, even carrying thick mockery and a look of disdain. But the twinkle in his eyes could not be concealed no matter what.

Hegemon Cloudmount was shouting crazily in his heart: Genius! Peerless genius! A genius even more monstrous than Zhou Pinespring!

This kid’s affinity was only 67!

This rascal was elucidating Dao almost completely based on instinct!

Furthermore, it was so perfect and impeccable!

‘When Zhou Pinespring was at grade five heavenly alchemist, he absolutely could not achieve this level!

One had to know, Zhou Pinespring’s affinity had reached grand completion holy realm long ago!

Was affinity reaching 100 the limit?

No!

Above 100, there were still three realms!

Spirit realm, profound realm, and holy realm!

Zhou Pinespring’s affinity was a freak among freaks and had long already reached the peak of holy realm, unable to rise any longer!

But even so, when Zhou Pinespring was at grade five heavenly alchemist, he could not compare to Ye Yuan too!

Dao elucidation was just one aspect of refining pills.

But Dao elucidation could tell how far a heavenly alchemist walked on the path of alchemy.

Very clearly, Ye Yuan had already walked very, very far!

No wonder this boy was so wild and arrogant. He indeed had the capital to be insolent!

Such a genius was simply unreasonably monstrous!

His affinity was clearly not up to scratch, but he was more impressive than others!

Tell me, was it not aggravating?

The geniuses that Cloudmount had seen before were as many as schools of carps crossing the river. But he had never seen before such a prodigy who took his breath away!

This trip was the right call!

Of course, he would not say these.

Hegemon Realm had to have the reserved manner of a Hegemon Realm. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

No matter how genius you were, you were still an ant in front of this seat!

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan’s Dao elucidation finally ended.

The Unadorned Golden Lotus seemed to be peeled open, forming an enormous flower; magnificently beautiful!

Ye Yuan reeled off the cocoon, guiding the rule fragments in the Unadorned Golden Lotus out, presenting it in a flower shape.

This kind of means was simply inconceivable.

Zuo Chen sucked in a cold breath. Even if it was him, he also could not do better than Ye Yuan.

“Impressive! Truly incredible! Brat, I really have nothing that I can teach you!” Zuo Chen said somewhat dejectedly.

He was indeed more powerful than Ye Yuan in alchemy. Furthermore, he could even refine profound grade heavenly pills.

But Ye Yuan would not take much time to reach his level.

With or without him, this master, it was actually all the same.

Ye Yuan fished out another Unadorned Golden Lotus, threw it to Cloudmount, and said, “Your turn!”

Cloudmount did not catch it. Only to see a streak of light flash past, the Unadomed Golden Lotus returned to Ye Yuan’s hand again.

“No need,” Cloudmount said coolly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Cloudmount, are you conceding defeat?”

Ahint of disdain flashed across the corners of Cloudmount’s mouth and he said, “Conceding defeat? Hahaha … You brat, you really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Forget about this Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, even across all the heavens and myriad worlds, how many dare to make

this seat admit defeat? Today, I’ll let you witness what’s true Alchemy Dao!”

Finished saying, Cloudmount’s palm raised up. A flame landed on the Unadorned Golden Lotus that Ye Yuan refined.

Whoosh!

It was as if the Unadorned Golden Lotus was watered with a catalyst, starting to grow crazily.

One flower became two.

Two flowers became four.

Four flowers became eight!

The rule flowers in the house became more and more, and increasingly gorgeous as if walking into a garden.

This spectacular scenery made people feel an upsurge of emotion, refreshing and gladdening the heart!

This technique was tyrannical to the extreme!

Ye Yuan’s expression finally changed!

His pupils constricted, his heart virtually about to stop beating.

Too strong!

‘Was … this the realm of a chaos heavenly master?
