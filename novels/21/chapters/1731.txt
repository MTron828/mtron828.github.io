Chapter 1735 Confronting Bug King!

As it got closer and closer to the center of the earth-fire, the erosion of all kinds of corrosive gases naturally also became more and more severe.Yu Jing’s aura was already starting to get chaotic, her speed naturally could not pick up as well, falling behind with Ye Yuan.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan pulled Yu Jing’s hand and a surge of chaos divine essence passed over.

Feeling her hand being held, Yu Jing jumped in fright and was instinctively going to pull it out. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

But very soon, she discovered a powerful and vigorous divine essence shielded her whole body, immediately reducing her pressure significantly.

Yu Jing looked at Ye Yuan in astonishment. Only then did she discover that the Third Firmament Divine Lord Ye Yuan was completely fine until now!

Now, he actually still had excess divine essence to come and help her.

How did this guy do it?

Feeling that powerful divine essence around her that was much more powerful than her own, she thought to herself that it was no wonder Ye Yuan could kill the Raging Fire Centipede.

This person was not simple!

“Thank you, Ye Yuan!” Yu Jing said from the bottom of her heart.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Elder Sister Jing, you’ve already said thank you many times!”

Yu Jing’s face turned red and she said, “I ... Apart from saying thanks, I don’t know what I should say.”

Ye Yuan smiled and was just about to speak when suddenly, the mountains shook and the earth quaked ahead.

Bang!

A white enormous bug suddenly scurried out from underground and bit towards Ye Yuan.

The four people who were currently running in front were taken aback with fright by this sudden turn of events.

Duan Peng’s expression changed and he said, “Shit, this is the bug king! Looks like it has peak middle-stage rank four strength! The two of them are in danger!”

The position where the bug king appeared did not deviate to either side and just nicely cut off the six people, blocking Ye Yuan two people.

When Luo Yong saw this scene, his face revealed an unnatural look of joy.

Even though Ye Yuan saved him just now, he still wished for Ye Yuan to go die!

Yu Jing’s face turned white as a sheet and exclaimed, “Ye Yuan, be careful!”

This sudden turn of events was too abrupt, catching the two people off-guard.

It was already too late to want to avoid it.

Yu Jing wanted to push Ye Yuan away and confront that enormous bug herself, but she discovered that she could not push at all.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s left hand threw a claw out with dragon roars howling endlessly.

Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven!

Bang!

A loud noise came over, Ye Yuan and the enormous bug each retreated several steps.

Yu Jing got a big shock. She did not expect that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually this strong.

This bug king’s aura was clearly significantly stronger than her, already reaching peak middle-stage rank four.

Ye Yuan, in his haste, actually fought to a draw with it!

Duan Peng and the rest also had shocked faces, not expecting that Ye Yuan was actually safe and sound.

“It turns out that Ye Yuan is actually even a body-cultivator. Furthermore, his strength is already at the middle-stage fourth transformation!” Duan Peng said with surprise.

Luo Yong even thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure, so how could he have known that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so powerful. He laughed coldly and said, “Boss Duan, I’ve long said that this brat is unreliable! He hid his strength, pretending to be a pig in order to eat a tiger! I think that he’s hiding a malicious intent. Yet, you all still believed his words.”

Duan Peng looked into the distance, expression gloomy and uncertain, and also could not quite make a decision for some time.

Those in their line of profession, no one would really trust.

In this Skydemon Mountain Range, the most terrifying thing was not fierce beasts but the human heart!

Regarding Luo Yong and Ye Yuan two people’s conflict, he had actually been sitting it out and watching the fight all along.

As long as it did not affect his journey, no matter how these two people quarreled, it did not hurt the important essentials.

But he discovered now that the things Ye Yuan hid were too many.

What Duan Peng did not expect the most was that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so powerful.

Just now, the bug king suddenly emerged. If it were him, he might not come out unscathed either, but Ye Yuan did it!

Looking at it this way, Ye Yuan’s strength was already not beneath his.

While over there, with this delay, Ye Yuan and Yu Jing were surrounded by the Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs very quickly.

Yu Jing shouted, “Boss Duan, quickly come over and help!”

Luo Yong looked at Yu Jing, a spiteful look on his face. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and said, “Boss Duan, you have to think clearly! Bringing this kid with us, weal and woe are unknown!”

Yu Jing saw that the few of them did not have any movements and said in a great panic, “Ye Yuan, you can definitely get out yourself, don’t care about me!”

Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly turned dark and he said, “Shut up! Let’s go out together! Hold me tight, don’t let go!”

Being shouted at by Ye Yuan like this, Yu Jing was immediately frightened until she did not dare to make a sound anymore, grabbing onto Ye Yuan’s hand tightly, not daring to loosen up.

Ye Yuan’s figure moved swiftly, rushing over towards the bug king.

Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven!

Ye Yuan blasted a move out once more, exchanging a blow with the bug king!

One human and one bug retreated several steps again!

If it was Ye Yuan alone, he naturally did not fear this bug king.

If not for the sake of finding the antidote, Ye Yuan would be able to kill this bug king with one sword.

But now, he needed these Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs to bring him to go find the antidote.

Once he killed the bug king, these Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs would definitely scatter and flee in all directions, and finding the antidote would be impossible.

As for spatial law, he used it straight away when he encountered the bug king just now, but it was negated by the other party!

This bug king seemed to be very sensitive towards spatial fluctuations.

Hence, Ye Yuan chose to confront head-on!

After retreating with his move, Ye Yuan forcefully endured the counter-shock and did not stop in the slightest, charging once more.

Another Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven!

Bang!

Powerful aftershock dispersed in all directions, directly sending those Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs that attempted to come close flying out, unable to approach at all.

Following that, the third time, fourth time, fifth time!

This bug king’s strength was truly formidable. If it were the average Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, they would also be shocked into minced meat by Ye Yuan’s uninterrupted Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven.

But, this bug king was just repelled back several steps each time, then welcomed Ye Yuan’s assault once more.

Blue patterns flashed on Ye Yuan’s body, his fleshy body erupting with unparalleled endurance. launching an assault time and again.

Far away, Duan Peng, Luo Yong, and the rest were all dumbstruck with amazement.

That series of loud noise gave them an incomparably strong impact.

This level of power was sufficient to utterly crush them!

“So strong! Could this guy’s body be forged from meteoric iron?”

“This is killing 800 of your enemy and losing 1000 of your own! No matter how strong the physical body, it still can’t withstand the execution of such martial technique!”

Luo Yong laughed coldly and said, “Heh heh, he still wants to be a hero to rescue the beauty! I think that he’s almost reaching the limits too, right?”

Duan Peng’s expression flickered incessantly. He was still struggling whether or not to take action.

Ye Yuan was like a madman, launching assaults again and again, clashing with the bug king.

Suddenly, Duan Peng clenched his teeth and charged over toward the bug king.

However, right at this time, Ye Yuan launched the 13th assault!

Rumble!

The bug king was directly smacked flying out by the dragon claw!

This time, it was unable to stabilize its figure anymore.

When Ye Yuan saw this, he could not help being overjoyed, grabbing Yu Jing and rushing over.

“Go!” Ye Yuan shouted loudly at the Duan Peng who rushed over, immediately speeding over.

Duan Peng looked at this scene in shock and was speechless for a while.

This guy assaulted 13 times consecutively, displaying such a powerful martial technique, and was actually still brimming with vigor currently!

But he also did not dare to stay, immediately running around and fleeing.

After that bug king landed, it crawled up very quickly, lifted its head to the sky, and gave a long roar.

Those Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs received its summoning and pounced toward Ye Yuan and the rest once more.
