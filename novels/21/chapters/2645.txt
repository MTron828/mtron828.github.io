Chapter 2651: Sky-high Price!

“True grade!”

“Above ninth grade!”

The shock of Cui Tong three people was not only expressed in words but also on their faces!

At this time, how could they still care about whatever win or lose?

True grade heavenly pill, they had never heard of it before!

This heavenly pill opened another window for them!

Not that the Land of Heavenly South’s heavenly medicine technique was not refined, but that the realm of true grade was seriously too hard to achieve.

In the entire Pill Alliance, there were probably barely a handful of people who could refine true grade heavenly pills too.

Heavenly South was merely a tiny place, how could they have seen before this grade of heavenly pill?

Ye Yuan’s words caused a whirlwind in the arena, everyone burst into an uproar.

No one had seen before a true grade heavenly pill, no one knew what Ye Yuan said was true or fake at all.

But everything in front of them left them no choice but to believe that this was real!

“Young Friend Ye, can this true grade heavenly pill be sold to this old man or not?” Cui Tong calmed himself down and asked.

As a grade four heavenly alchemist, he could no longer be described as burning with eagerness anymore.

He could not wait to bring this heavenly pill back and study it carefully.

However, Ye Yuan shook his head and said indifferently, “This is the Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit, better do it in accordance with the rules, the highest bidder wins! What this grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill of mine represents is Calm South City.”

Su Yi’s face turned from shock to ecstasy.

There was really a silver lining in every cloud!

This true grade heavenly pill was worth a thousand grade three heavenly pills!

What did a mere Water Billow City count as?

Cui Tong nodded slightly and said, “Alright, let’s start the auction now then!”

He was already too impatient to wait!

That auctioneer had a bitter smile on his face and asked, “Master Cui Tong, what’s the base price of this heavenly pill?”

He had never seen before a true grade heavenly pill, there was no precedent!

“No need for a base price, there’s no restriction on price increment as well, directly get to the bidding. Whoever wins with a bid of one heavenly crystal, just take it as they got lucky,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Everyone’s faces turned black, all looking at Ye Yuan with contemptuous faces.

One piece of heavenly crystal, to think that you could say it out loud!

Everyone knew that no base price, no restriction on price increment, this sort of situation was the most terrifying.

The final auction price had no bottom line at all!

God knows how much the final transaction price would be.

Under the urging of Cui Tong three people, the auction started very soon.

The auctioneer said loudly, “Now, auctioning a grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, this pill is a true grade that has never appeared in the Land of Heavenly South before! No base price; no restrictions on price increase. Now, the bidding begins!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“One million!”

Almost as soon as it was announced, Cui Tong made a bid.

The number of one million made everyone present suck in a cold breath.

One had to know, Ge Ling’s Fuxi Pure Yang Pill previously was only auctioned for a price of 600 thousand heavenly crystals.

Now, Cui Tong directly raised it to a million.

His gaze swept over everyone’s faces and he said coolly, “This pill, this old man is determined to get it!”

Originally, with a true grade pill coming into being, which of the tycoons present did not want to claim it for themselves?

But Cui Tong’s words already faintly implied a warning.

Everyone could not refrain from criticizing inwardly but was also helpless about it.

Cui Tong was not what anyone could afford to provoke.

Seeing no one speak up, Cui Tong was very satisfied.

“Two million!” However, right at this time, someone spoke up.

The source of the voice was precisely from another grade four heavenly alchemist beside Cui Tong.

Cui Tong’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Wu Dao, what’s the meaning of this?”

Wu Dao said coolly, “Old Cui, if it were other things, then forget it. But, the significance of this true grade heavenly pill, you and I both understand! Such a good thing, how can this old man not be moved?”

Cui Tong’s face turned black and he gritted his teeth and said, “Five million!”

“Eight million!” Cui Tong just spoke up when another judge also joined in the melee.

“Ji Chun! Good, very good, is this old man scared of you? Ten million!”

As if it was free, Cui Tong directly offered a sky-high price of ten million!

This kind of bidding directly made many tycoons shrink back at the sight of it.

They were rich, but compared to these veteran grade four heavenly alchemists, they were weak to the max.

The wealth that a grade four heavenly alchemist possessed might rival a large family clan!

“20 million!”

Right at this time, another voice sounded out.

Everyone was taken aback, but looking in Jiang Li’s direction.

No one expected that he would open his mouth too.

Furthermore, he increased it by ten million heavenly crystals in one go!

In the face of Cui Tong’s murderous gaze, Jiang Li said coolly, “I really want to know just how I’m worse than him! Three elders, I’ll be offending! This pill, this Jiang is also determined to get it!”

Cui Tong snorted coldly and said, “Very good! Each relies on one’s abilities then! 30 million!”

“33 million!”

“35 million!”

… …

“68 million!”

When Jiang Li yelled out this price, the three judges finally hesitated.

Clearly, this price already approached the limit that they could bear.

It was just that no one expected that Jiang Li’s financial power was actually so great!

A grade three heavenly alchemist could actually be on par with a grade four heavenly alchemist!

This true grade heavenly pill held great significance to them.

Even if they bankrupted themselves, they had to obtain it too.

If money was gone, it could be earned again. But if this heavenly pill was missed, it would be very difficult to encounter again.

Sure, they could find Ye Yuan and have him refine again.

But it was very hard!

Such a valuable heavenly pill, Ye Yuan definitely would not refine it frequently.

The four people’s bidding made the expressions of each and every one of the tycoons present turn pale.

Such a crazy scene, it was still their first time seeing it.

A price of 68 million, what kind of concept was that?

One year of Thistle South Nine Cities’ tax revenue added up could not reach this figure too!

“Too freaking exciting! It’s still Your Father’s first time seeing that a grade two heavenly pill can actually sell for a sky-high price of 70 million heavenly crystals!”

“What the hell do you know! As long as the three masters can work out the refining method of the true grade heavenly pill, what does 70 million count for?”

“This is simply snatching money! Crazy! Really insane! I even feel like I can’t breathe anymore!”

… …

Although it was not them bidding, each of them had blood-red eyes.

This scene was really too exciting.

The auctioneer asked, “68 million, is there any higher, three masters?”

Seeing that the three did not respond, the auctioneer continued, “68 million going once!”

“68 million going twice!”

“68 million going thrice! This true grade heavenly pill belongs to Master Jiang Li!”

Murmur!

The audience was in an uproar!

No one expected that Jiang Li actually really suppressed the three heavyweights in the end.

The title of Heavenly South’s number one genius was not for show.

The wealth that he had accumulated these few years was very terrifying.

Getting this true grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, Jiang Li’s gaze could no longer look away.

“Tsk tsk,?too perfect! How can a heavenly pill be so perfect? I can feel the surging Great Dao accumulations inside! I can definitely draw down Great Dao accumulations and reach the realm of true grade!”

Jiang Li was intoxicated, completely forgetting about his previous grudge with Ye Yuan.

At the same time, Cui Tong three people looked at Jiang Li with unfriendly expressions.

The envious looks in their eyes could not be concealed no matter what.
