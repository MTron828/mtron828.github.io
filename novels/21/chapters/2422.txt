Chapter 2428: Name Spreading All Over the World!

“Who is Saint Azure? I never heard of him before at all!”

“Heh heh, you’re ignorant and ill-informed, right? This person is famous in the entire Heavenspan World! Although he’s only Heavenly Emperor Realm, his status is incomparably venerated!”

“Mn? Stop leaving us hanging, who the hell is it?”

“A few years ago, there was a big earthquake in the alchemy world. The Medicine Ancestor was defeated, and a new ancestor was established! A Heavenly Emperor Realm young man was conferred the title of ancestor by the entire alchemy world! Who do you still think that it can be?”

Next to him, a group of people revealed shocked expressions, with looks of disbelief. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

No one could have thought that the Saint Azure who was famous throughout the Heavenspan World was actually Ancestor Ye, Ye Yuan!”

A Heavenly Emperor Realm martial artist actually became the key figure of this world-destroying battle. So how could they not be surprised?

At this time, hundreds of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses surrounded a middle-aged uncle with a dreadful appearance.

This wretched-looking middle-aged uncle was called Bao Tiande, a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse too, making a living from selling information.

His information was very accurate and had never made a mistake before. So people gave him the nickname of ‘Bao Inquiry’.

Bao Inquiry had always charged an extremely expensive fee. But this time, he had a rare free release of news, drawing a large group of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses to surround and look.

Although these Heavenly Emperor powerhouses did not go to the front lines, they paid a lot of attention to the situation at the front lines.

After all, a war of this scale affected their futures.

A Heavenly Emperor said in disbelief, “This is impossible! I admit that Ancestor Ye has a shocking talent in the alchemy path, but what strength does he have to repel the divine race army with his power alone? There are likely elements of exaggeration in-between this, right?”

By the side, a Heavenly Emperor expert in coarse robes said with a nod, “I think so too! To say that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets repelled the divine race alone, I still believe it. He, a puny little Heavenly Emperor Realm, based on what? Most likely, the news from the front snowballed the rumors, it’s too exaggerated!”

“Indeed so! Deva Fifth Blight is more like it. The impact of a Heavenly Emperor Realm on the war is too small. It’s simply impossible!”

... ...

This news, they heard a lot about it in this period of time. But it could be said that there were none who really believed it.

A Heavenly Emperor Realm influencing the war, this sort of thing was simply laughable.

However, Bao Inquire had a sneer on his face and said, “You bunch of ignorant guys, what the hell do you know! Lord Saint Azure ingeniously designed an interlinked plan, and he lured the divine race army to Eight Void Mountain! And he activated Eight Void Mountain’s rules grand array. The divine race members beneath Nine-marks were almost completely annihilated. Divine race’s commander-in-chief, Daymeld, was beaten until he almost died. Lord Saint Azure isn’t just an alchemy path master. But he’s similarly a formation path master! Furthermore, I even heard a rumor. It’s just that ...”

Bao Inquire’s words made everyone dumbstruck with amazement.

They knew that the news coming out of Bao Inquire’s mouth was basically very real already.

But the things that he said were too shocking.

Eight Void Mountain’s grand array, everyone knew that it was unfathomable.

Since time immemorial, no idea how many formation path powerhouses were unable to truly comprehend the grand array.

But Ye Yuan re-activated the rules grand array!

This kind of means was truly fantastical.

The means above rules to deal with the divine race army was indeed more than enough.

It was just that, wanting to achieve this step was far too difficult!

However, Bao Inquire’s following words had whetted their appetites up.

“It’s just what? Hurry up and say!”

“Yeah, stop leaving us hanging! Could it be that there’s still even more explosive news?”

... ...

Everyone urged Bao Inquire one after another, but Bao Inquire shook his head with a mysterious look and said, “Forget it, forget it, not saying it. This news isn’t confirmed, I don’t dare to say nonsense.”

Everyone almost vomited blood. Their appetites were stirred up. So how could they let it slide so easily?

“I say, you’re too much! It’s better you don’t talk at all! Don’t stop after saying it halfway! What the hell is this? Even if it isn’t real, you just say it, and we’ll listen and laugh it off after listening. Wouldn’t that do?”

“Yeah, Bao Inquire. If you don’t say it clearly today, we won’t let you leave!”

... ...

This group of Heavenly Emperors was indignant, all saying it unhappily.

Bao Inquire chuckled and said, “Alright. Since that’s the case, then I’ll talk about this Lord Saint Azure! I heard, it’s merely just hearing of it!”

The group of Heavenly Emperors perked their ears up, all paying close attention, afraid of missing the slightest detail.

Lord Saint Azure’s name was already famous throughout the entire Heavenspan World now.

Regarding his gossip, everyone was naturally very curious.

Although these words were rumors, there was still some credibility coming out of Bao Inquire’s mouth.

As Bao Inquire said, his expression also gradually became solemn.

When the rest saw the situation, their hearts became even more somber.

“I heard that Lord Saint Azure awakened the rule powerhouse on Eight Void Mountain! Furthermore, this rule powerhouse seemed to knew Lord Saint Azure. The moment they met, he actually knelt down! Of course, this is merely just hearsay. There’s no way to prove!” Bao Inquire said with a solemn look.

Actually, he paid a huge price for this news, inquiring it from a formation path sovereign from Eight Void Mountain.

This news still had some credibility.

It was just that this news was too inconceivable. Even he felt that it was somewhat fake.

Sure enough, the moment these words came out, the group of Heavenly Emperors burst into an uproar at once.

“What?! A rule powerhouse knelt toward a Heavenly Emperor Realm junior?”

“Bao Inquire, this joke of yours is too much!”

“Hahaha ... this joke is very funny! Bao Inquire, you’ve successfully made us laugh!”

... ...

Everyone laughed loudly, but Bao Inquire did not laugh.

The laughter of those Heavenly Emperor powerhouses gradually stopped. In the end, it became dry laughter.

They knew that when Bao Inquire had this expression, he had always been very serious.

Which was also to say that he was not joking!

A Heavenly Emperor said, “C-Cough cough, Bao Inquire, this wouldn’t be real, right? B-But this is also too nonsensical!”

Bao Inquire shook his head and said, “Not sure, but it isn’t a groundless rumor! Although Eight Void Mountain can’t be compared to the past right now, there are still some people comprehending the Dao on the mountain. For this matter, I spent a lot of effort to go and inquire. In the end, those who came down the mountain all remained silent and said nothing. If it was really a joke, their expression wouldn’t have been like that! Furthermore, there’s one more thing!”

With this, no one laughed anymore.

If it was really a joke, those who came down the mountain would definitely have laughed it off.

Their expressions would definitely have been completely different.

At least, the reaction should have been the same as theirs just now.

Each of them held their breaths, listening to what Bao Inquire had to say next.

“Fifth Blight, Heavenly Emperor Yue Feng, knelt down in front of Lord Saint Azure’s camp door and didn’t get up! According to what I know, he was comprehending on the Dao on the mountain back at that time! And he was the only Fifth Blight powerhouse on the mountain back then! A Fifth Blight powerhouse kneeling and not getting up, do you all know what that means?” Bao Inquire said.

“Hiss ...”

There were sounds of cold air being sucked in all around.

The news that Bao Inquire told them were too shocking.

Heavenly Emperor Yue Feng’s great name, who did not know?

In Formation Dao, he was enough to rank in the top ten!

But it was this level of a powerhouse who actually knelt down in front of Ye Yuan’s camp and did not get up!
