Chapter 1994: Profound Secrets’ Attention

“Brother Ye!”

The expressions of Song Yu and the rest changed, hurriedly chasing after Ye Yuan.

He suddenly felt that this Ye Yuan in front of him became so unfamiliar.

“Brother Ye, where are you going?”

Ye Yuan’s movement technique was extremely fast. Song Yu and the rest actually could not catch up and could only shout from behind.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s footsteps stopped, and he said in a cold voice, “Stop following me. Otherwise, don’t blame me for turning my back on old friends.”

The figures of Song Yu and the rest turned stiff, looking at Ye Yuan in somewhat disbelievingly.

Was ... this still that Ye Yuan they knew?

Watching Ye Yuan left, Song Yu and the rest did not dare to stop him.

This Ye Yuan before their eyes was too horrifying and too cold. If they had followed, he would probably kill them without the slightest hesitation.

“Brother Song, what’s wrong with Brother Ye?” Guo Jingyang asked puzzledly.

Song Yu’s expression was rather ugly as he said in a solemn voice, “Brother Ye’s cultivation method is indeed exceptionally rare, to even be able to disregard cultivation realm and instantly kill his opponent. But ... it seems to have considerable side-effects and will affect one’s temperament.”

Guo Jingyang’s face changed and he said, “This ... What to do about this? He wouldn’t keep going like this, right?”

Song Yu shook his head and said, “Of course not. But if he keeps on cultivating like this, he’ll probably become a peerless powerhouse without the slightest emotion in the end!”

The other few people’s expressions were all very ugly when they heard it. They already treated Ye Yuan as a sworn friend for life and death and were very worried about Ye Yuan.

“This ... Then is it really fine for us to let him leave just like that?” Hu Fei asked worriedly.

“Relax, you saw his strength too. To be able to force the Empyrean bone devil to raise his realm to the Ninth Firmament True God Realm, ordinary dangers can’t do anything to him at all. Moreover, even if he’s like this now, he also wouldn’t possibly push himself onto the road to ruin. In fact, I feel that he might be calmer than ever under this state,” Song Yu said with a sigh.

The rest were speechless for a while and actually did not know what to do.

“Brother Song, then what should we do now?” Guo Jingyang asked.

Song Yu thought about it and said, “The matter here is pretty much settled. So let’s return to the circle and wait for Brother Ye.”

...

Three months later, Ye Yuan finally returned to the circle.

When Song Yu and the rest saw Ye Yuan, each and every one of them was extremely excited.

“Brother Ye, you’re back! You worried us to death these few months!” Hu Fei said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Sorry, I’ve made everyone worry.”

By the side, Song Yu suddenly said in surprise, “Brother Ye, you broke through again?”

Not seeing for a short three months, Ye Yuan actually grew stronger by another minor realm.

At present, he already reached the peak Third Firmament Origin Pill Realm and was only a step away from the Fourth Firmament Origin Pill Realm.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I had another fortuitous encounter these few months and broke through by a fluke.”

Song Yu also discerned that Ye Yuan did not seem to be willing to talk too much about the events of these few months. So he also shut his mouth sensibly.

But Ye Yuan’s realm increasing still gave him a shock.

Song Yu these few people understood that the implications of Ye Yuan breaking through a minor realm was that he was no longer the same person like in the past.

The current Ye Yuan dealing with Fifth Firmament True God powerhouses, it would likely be a cinch too.

After returning to the circle, everything settled down.

Ye Yuan observed for a bit. The children of destiny that returned to the circle safely were already less than one in ten.

Although this Ancient God Battlefield was teeming with lucky chances, it was also extremely dangerous.

But those able to return mostly had great improvements in strength, their auras more than a level stronger compared to before.

In the crowd, Ye Yuan even saw a familiar figure. It was Zhou Yu.

Zhou Yu’s gaze was also sizing Ye Yuan up. Discovering that Ye Yuan looked over, he immediately turned his head over and did not dare to meet his eyes.

For the current Zhou Yu, his heart was pounding away.

He was afraid, afraid of Ye Yuan coming to find trouble with him.

Zhou Yu did not expect that just three months passed and Ye Yuan directly grew stronger by a minor realm.

When Ye Yuan was at the Second Firmament True God Realm, he was already not a match. Now, he was naturally even less of a match.

If Ye Yuan was bent on finding trouble with him, he would not be able to bear the consequences.

Luckily, Ye Yuan just gave him a glance and did not have the intention of coming over to find trouble with him. Only then did he let out a long sigh in relief.

Since entering Ancient God Battlefield until now, around one and a half year’s time had passed. The remaining time, everyone each entered meditation, waiting for the end to end.

Of course, there were still some children of destiny who kept seeking lucky chances outside, returning to the circle one after another. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

In a blink, the three years limit was up. That Heavenly Emperor powerhouse’s voice sounded out once more.

“Congratulations to all of your children of destiny, reaping bountiful harvests in the Ancient God Battlefield. However, I hope that everyone remembers my Jian Family’s kindness. In the future, if my Jian Family has any requests, I hope that everyone doesn’t turn it down!”

“Lord Heavenly Emperor is too courteous. The Jian Family’s matter is my matter!”

“Lord Heavenly Emperor rest assured!”

“Definitely, definitely!”

...

The group of children of destiny hurriedly said.

Following that, that Heavenly Emperor powerhouse continued saying, “After you all experienced this, your destinies should undergo a change once again. After going back, let your city lords view it. Alright, let’s say goodbye here.”

Hearing this, everyone had excited looks on their faces.

The vast majority of them were imperial aura. Emperor surmounting auras were just a minority after all.

If they could evolve to emperor surmounting aura, then they would have hopes of breaking through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor in the future.

That would be a massive good fortune to them.

After all, at great imperial capital this level, wanting to break through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor was far too difficult!

In the crowd, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, because he felt that the Heavenly Emperor was currently paying attention to him.

It seemed like his perception was not wrong. He really caught the attention of the Jian Family and even Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets!

But he did not express anything, waiting for the Ancient God Battlefield to close the same as the rest.

Everyone was currently rejoicing, only to see a light flash and the circle directly disappeared. Everyone was sent into the passageway.

...

At the Profound Secrets Bodhimanda, Jian Yunxin bowed to Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets and said, “Father, that little fellow called Ye Yuan obtained the Qilin emperor bone inside the Ancient God Battlefield this time. In addition ... he even made a trip to Crape Myrtle Cave.”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s brows raised up and he said in surprise, “Crape Myrtle Cave is the place where Heavenly Emperor Crape Myrtle died. Fellow Daoist Crape Myrtle was a well-renown Transcendent Heavenly Emperor in the last epoch. Inside the Crape Myrtle Cave is full of dangers. He, a True God, actually entered the Crape Myrtle Cave? Also, he could block Empyrean Vast Universe’s three sword moves; it shows that his talent is also similar to the geniuses of the last epoch!”

Jian Yunxin clearly also felt that it was incredulous and said, “Indeed so. Jian Rong has been constantly observing this little fellow. After he obtained the Qilin emperor bone, he entered the Crape Myrtle Cave alone. It’s just that that place shields against all probing. So Jian Rong was unable to find out just what that little fellow did inside too.”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets nodded his head and said, “Even if this emperor went, I’d also be unable to investigate the situation inside Crape Myrtle Cave, let alone talk about Jian Rong. This little fellow is really getting more and more interesting.”

Jian Yunxin thought about it and said, “Father, Jian Rong also discovered an interesting thing.”
