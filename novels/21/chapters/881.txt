Chapter 885: True Strength

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Inviting Ye Yuan to join the team, this was nothing rare.

With Ye Yuan’s performance in the second level, he was bound to be regarded highly by those heavyweights after going to the third level.

What made people surprised was Sun Qi’s attitude.

Who was Sun Qi?

A powerhouse ranked 58 on the Earth Carnage Proclamation. His strength was way stronger compared to Leng Qing.

An important person like this was actually so respectful towards Ye Yuan!

Even if he was sent here under the Demon King’s orders, it should not be this kind of attitude.

When did this Asura Arena become so civil and polite?

“Who’s the Demon King? I don’t know, and I’m not interested in knowing as well! I still have to go back to enter seclusion and cultivate. Don’t come and bother me!” Ye Yuan said with a look of impatience.

He was currently in high spirits and wanted to cultivate the Slaughter Sword Art. But another whatever Demon King jumped out again. It would be weird if he could be happy.

But these words were totally not the case when it fell into other people’s ears!

Who was the Demon King? One of the third level’s kings! A powerful existence ranked in the top five! Ye Yuan actually dared to speak impertinently!

If these words were to be brought back by Sun Qi, wouldn’t Lord Demon King blow his top?

The reason why the Demon King was called the Demon King was that he killed people without batting an eye! Regardless of who they were, as long as they provoked him, he obliterated without exception!

Maybe the Demon King was not the strongest one in the third level, but he was absolutely the most savage and cruel one in the third level!

Finished talking, Ye Yuan walked off without any care, and he did not even give Sun Qi a glance either.

Sun Qi’s face turned dark. What kind of person was Sun Qi? Coming to invite a second level’s brat, this guy actually still did not give face.

But upon thinking of Lord Demon King’s instructions, Sun Qi forcefully pressed down the discontentment in his heart, caught up with Ye Yuan, and said, “Since Lord Ye Yuan has already obtained the qualifications to advance to the third level, isn’t going up to the third level to cultivate the same as well? Lord Demon King has already prepared a third level’s top-tier cultivation chamber for you and can provide for milord’s cultivation.”

Regarding Sun Qi’s attitude, Ye Yuan was a little surprised too. He initially thought that Sun Qi would explode. Did not expect that this guy would actually be so good-tempered?

Ever since arriving at the Chaotic Devil Sea, Ye Yuan still very rarely saw such a good-tempered person.

But a top-tier cultivation chamber made Ye Yuan slightly moved.

One had to know that this top-tier cultivation chamber, one slaughter point could only use for three days. If not to assault bottlenecks, ordinary people would not rent it.

Ye Yuan paused for a bit and said, “Alright then, looking on account of the top-tier cultivation chamber, I’ll take a trip with you! I still have some matters to take care of at the second level. You go to the third level and wait for me.”

Actually, there wasn’t much stuff to take care of either. Ye Yuan was just going back to say goodbye to Tan Si.

These few days, Tan Si was still considered attentive and satisfactory. Ye Yuan naturally would not be miserly towards him either. He gave him some medicinal pills and instructed him to cultivate well.

Right now, the second level all knew that Tan Si was his follower. There naturally would not be anyone without eyes that would be making things too difficult for him.

Tan Si still had a lot of potential. During this period, his improvement was apparent as well. Advancing to the third level in the future was also not impossible.

After settling Tan Si’s affairs, Ye Yuan went straight up to the third level.

...

Sun Qi brought Ye Yuan to an empty hall, saying to go report his arrival, and then disappeared.

In the entire hall, Ye Yuan was left all alone by himself.

Ye Yuan was bold stemming from his outstanding skills and did not mind either. He sat down calmly and drank tea.

Even after drinking the entire pot of tea, there was still no one who came to say hello. Inside the hall, it was still and quiet, with only Ye Yuan’s continuously tea-drinking slight sounds.

A cold atmosphere gradually loomed. This matter seemed like a trap, no matter how one looked at it.

“Make your move. Holding it in for so long, aren’t you tired?” Ye Yuan gently put down the teapot and said coolly.

As if responding to Ye Yuan’s words, a dark shadow suddenly dashed out. A palm with an irresistible force rumbled over towards Ye Yuan.

Bang!

The chair Ye Yuan was sitting on and the table were directly smashed into dust.

“Strength is decent! But since your esteemed self invited me here, could it be that you don’t dare to reveal your true appearance to people?” Ye Yuan already composed himself and did not have the slightest awareness of falling into a trap.

This person in front of him was dressed in black robes. He was even wearing a black fanged-mask on his face, looking very ferocious.

The masked man did not speak. Raising his hand, it was another palm!

Ye Yuan’s punch rumbled out, directly annihilating the masked man’s palm force.

“Mighty Heaven God Annihilating Palm!”

The masked man’s low voice transmitted over. A horrifying palm force assaulted towards Ye Yuan.

Violent killing intent filled the entire hall. This palm was clearly unleashed with the Slaughter Supreme True Intent.

In terms of the Slaughter Supreme True Intent’s level, it was evidently above Leng Qing’s!

Ye Yuan reckoned that even if this masked man’s Slaughter Concept did not reach seven stars, it was not far away either.

Although soul generals were divided into nine stars, these stars would be harder and harder to condense towards the back. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Six stars to seven stars, there was a major threshold too. A martial artist had to fight goodness knows how many matches before they could amass enough Slaughter Concept.

This masked man in front of him should be that so-called Demon King.

Facing such a palm, Ye Yuan did not dare to be careless either. He immediately revolved the Void Dragon Shadow Punch to the limits!

Boom!

Two attacks with tremendous power collided together. A massive energy wave directly ravaged the hall. The roof immediately crumbled down.

The entire hall instantly turned into a wasteland.

But right at this time, the skies suddenly dimmed. The skies studded with stars.

A terrifying energy undulation instantly enveloped Ye Yuan inside!

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan did not reveal a solemn expression but smiled instead.

He finally knew who this Demon King was!

“I didn’t expect that you, this fellow, actually ran to the Chaotic Devil Sea! But your improvement really makes me feel astonished! Since you want to test my limits, I’ll let you witness my true strength!”

The smile on Ye Yuan’s face gradually faded away. The Starmoon Sword quietly landed in his hand.

Ye Yuan slightly raised the Starmoon Sword, then just casually slashed in the air. A massive rift was actually slashed out in the sky!

After that, those motes of stars were completely annihilated under this slash!

This powerful Lumen Star Brilliance move was broken by Ye Yuan with a wave of his hand.

“Azure Dipper Floating Zero Sword ... Will Soaring to the Skies!” Ye Yuan lightly spat out these few words.

Behind that black mask, those pupils constricted, clearly shocked by the scene before his eyes.

Only when the skies recovered its clearness did the masked man come back to his senses from the midst of shock. He heaved a long sigh and said, “I thought that I was already powerful enough. Didn’t think that the gap with you became bigger and bigger!”

The masked man slowly removed the fanged-mask, revealing a delicate and good-looking face. Who could it be but Nalan Chu?

Back then, Nalan Chu left the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, saying he wanted to go out and train. But Ye Yuan never expected that he actually ran to the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land and even entered inside the Asura Arena.

In Ye Yuan’s impression, Nalan Chu was a free and unconventional modest gentleman. But this Demon King before his eyes subverted Ye Yuan’s understanding of him.

It seemed like during this period, his transformation was really not small.
