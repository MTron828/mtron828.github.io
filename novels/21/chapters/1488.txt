Chapter 1492 Blood Essence Contrac

In order to prevent accidents, Meng Qi personally brought Ye Yuan to the Hundred Knows Hall.

With him coming forward, everything was naturally a cinch.

Under a manager of the Hundred Knows Hall’s lead, Ye Yuan went straight up to the third level. This was the place to receive VIPs.

“Sir wait for a moment here, someone will come and receive you right away,” said the manager and then left.

This was a very elegant room. A delicate fragrance hit one’s nostrils, giving people a feeling of intoxication.

The tea was already brewed. Ye Yuan gently took a sip and praised, “Good tea! The morning dew of purple Qi coming from the East, tea shoots irrigated with spirit rain. Hard to come by, hard to come by! What’s even harder to come by is the pair of skillful hands of the person who brewed the tea.”

Space distorted. A beautiful figure slowly walked out of the void.

This woman’s clothing was half-revealed, her skin fairer than snow, arch eyebrows and cherry lips; not at all inferior compared to Li Ji.

But compared to Li Ji’s reservedness, this girl was zealous like fire, as if going to burn someone. Every twinkle and smile seemed to carry a flirtatious intention.

“Sir Source Night is indeed extraordinary, to actually see through the profundities in this room with a glance.”

The woman slowly sat down not far away from Ye Yuan’s side and said with all smiles, “Sir Source Night’s erroneous praise, Yi Han isn’t worthy of it.”

The charming arts of this woman called Yi Han already reached the acme of perfection. Every careless action could give men immense temptation.

With Ye Yuan’s concentration, he actually had a momentary lapse in mind too.

Clearly just drank a mouthful of tea, he actually felt parched.

However, it was also just that instant. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The firmness of Ye Yuan’s Dao heart was rare in the world.

Wanting to use bewitching arts to confuse him was virtually without any possibility.

“Source Night came here to inquire about information and not play with girls. Miss Yi Han, please call the main person out,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

When Yi Han saw that Ye Yuan’s focus was so great, she could not help being secretly startled inwardly.

This Capone Capital City, the men able to withstand her bewitching arts were rare!

Yi Han covered her mouth and smiled as she said, “Sir Source Night is so oblivious to other people’s feelings. Could it be that in sir’s eyes, Yi Han can’t compare to Li Ji?”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned cold and he said, “Keep pestering unreasonably and don’t blame me for not being courteous!”

But Yi Han said without a care, “Okay, this lowly one wants to see how Sir becomes impolite?”

As she said, Yi Han’s pair of clever hands actually groped toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, fingers tapping over towards Yi Han’s shoulder like lightning.

Who knew that this Yi Han’s shoulder actually slipped away bizarrely, narrowly avoiding this tap.

Ye Yuan’s heart sank and realized right away that this Yi Han concealed her strength.

His move failing, Ye Yuan hurriedly retreated, pulling apart a distance from Yi Han, maintaining vigilance.

“Goodness, Sir Source Night doesn’t know how to be tender toward girls at all! Attacking so strongly, is this wanting to take this lowly one’s life?” Yi Han giggled and said.

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “Who the hell are you? Why are you teasing me?”

Yi Han smiled and said, “How did this lowly one tease Sir? It was clearly Sir who wanted to ruthlessly crush a flower. However, Yi Han is very curious just who Sir is? Putting aside your strength far surpassing those in the same-rank, your alchemy skills are even so powerful, the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill at your fingertips with ease. Even the Fiend Medicine Hall’s five elders had to show you a pupil’s manners. With my Blood Yama Hall’s eyes and hands, we actually completely could not investigate Sir’s background.”

Ye Yuan’s heart sank, secretly thinking that this Hundred Knows Hall had such access to information.

It seemed like what he had done in Capone Capital City was already completely known by the Hundred Knows Hall.

At this time, Ye Yuan naturally would not treat Yi Han as an ordinary girl anymore. Her strength was likely far above his.

Even Dustless could not fathom Yi Han’s depths either.

Although Dustless’s strength did not recover to its peak state, under Divine Lord Realm, most could not escape his divine sense investigation.

But this Yi Han was clearly an exception.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a deep voice, “This young master had lived with my master in a remote land since young. It’s also normal for you to not have heard before. So what’s strange about that?”

Ye Yuan naturally would not make this kind of low-level mistake. He had long fabricated his origins.

Yi Han smiled and said, “So that’s how it is. Sir doesn’t need to panic. Let’s sit down and talk?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and got seated again, and he said coolly, “If you want to ask about my master, you can save your breath.”

A hint of surprise flashed across Yi Han’s eyes, thinking to himself that this chap was so formidable.

She was just about to open her mouth and ask, and he already used words to block her.

If Ye Yuan’s master was really a reclusive expert, then he was definitely unwilling to reveal his name.

This point was naturally justifiable.

Yi Han smiled faintly and said, “Alright, then Sir Source Night came to Capone Capital City just for the sake of investigation?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Precisely so! Miss Yi Han, wonder if Source Night can ask questions now?”

Yi Han said, “Does Sir know our Hundred Knows Hall’s rules?”

Ye Yuan was stunned and shook his head as he said, “Don’t know.”

Yi Han giggled and said, “Sir is really interesting, to dare come and inquire about information without even knowing the Hundred Knows Hall’s rules.”

Ye Yuan had long heard that the Hundred Knows Hall’s information was not easy to inquire, but he did not know the specifics.

Looking at it now, seemed like he thought too simply about it.

“Pray tell!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Yi Han said, “Our Hundred Knows Hall’s intel is divided into first-grade to ninth-grade. The first three grades’ intel, as long as one pays sufficient fiend essence stones, they can obtain it. But fourth-grade to ninth-grade intel, apart from having to pay exorbitant fiend essence stones, one even has to agree to do some things for the Hundred Knows Hall for free.”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “That means, I owe you all a favor?”

Yi Han said, “It’s pretty much this meaning.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “If I don’t do it?”

Yi Han smiled and said, “You need to leave behind a blood essence contract before we’ll give you the information. If you renege and not do the favor, we can make you wish that you were dead through the blood essence contract.”

Ye Yuan’s heart turned cold. This Blood Yama Hall was very mysterious. It seemed like their background was huge.

Ye Yuan said, “If you all make me go and die, could it be that I have to act in accordance too?”

Yi Han smiled and said, “Our Blood Yama Hall has always been equally honest with the elderly and the young. It’s just that some things, it’s not convenient for us to act in our own capacity, so we need a promise. Some people, we never went to find him even till death. On the blood essence contract, there are naturally also some taboo rules stated one by one; for example, we won’t make you go and die. Of course, if you die in the process of carrying out the contract, it’s not within the scope. Once the contract activates, if you didn’t complete it, you’ll naturally suffer the contract’s backlash.”

Ye Yuan was incredibly shocked in his heart. This was equivalent to saying that as long as someone inquired about fourth-grade and above information, they would all owe the Blood Yama Hall a favor.

With the accumulation year after year, the Blood Yama Hall’s favors outside would be very terrifying.

Among these people, it was hard to guarantee that some powerful existences would not appear.

As long as the Blood Yama Hall continued on retaining this blood essence contract, it was equivalent to this contract continuously appreciating in value!

No wonder even the City Lord Manor did not dare to provoke the Blood Yama Hall too. Just this blood essence contract, how could the average person afford to offend?

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Alright, but I have to take a look at the contract’s contents first.”
