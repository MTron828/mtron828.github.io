Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Yes, I’m not qualified enough!”

Dao Ancestor Life was indifferent, but he changed the topic and said, “But times have changed. His most beloved woman is now the divine daughter of the divine race. Furthermore, her talent is astonishing. How can you guarantee that he’s still loyal and devoted to the human race? Perhaps him letting Daymeld go was the precursor to betraying the human race? You also know that his talent is amazing. But it’s precisely so that once he defects to the enemy, he’ll be an even greater threat to the human race, no?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled coldly and said, “If you are out to condemn someone, you can always trump up a charge. You’re trumping up a charge here! Just based on this, you want to ruin Saint Azure? This emperor tells you, unless you pull my Jian Family up from the roots, otherwise, don’t think about it!”

Dao Ancestor Life fell silent, Profound Secrets’s reaction was within his expectations. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Azure and Profound Dual Saints were of the same breath and branch. He came from the previous epoch and personally saw before Azure and Profound Dual Saints’ valiant and heroic deeds. So how could he not know?

But Ye Yuan must die!

However, killing Ye Yuan was not that easy of a matter.

The name of Saint Azure was too resounding, he founded the human race’s unprecedented prosperity. Now, he also established great achievements in battle.

This kind of valiant and heroic feat, one false move and he might lose the game!

It was correct that he was a Dao Ancestor, but he could not possibly become enemies with the entire world.

Let alone that the divine race still had a terrifying Tian Qing.

“Alright. Since that’s the case, this ancestor has an idea. Invite Ye Yuan over to challenge him face to face! What do you think, Profound Secrets?” Dao Ancestor Life said faintly.

Profound Secrets’s pupils constricted, a foreboding feeling arising in his heart.

This guy wanted to make Ye Yuan walk right into a trap!

The moment Ye Yuan came, he would probably never be able to go back anymore!

Seeing Profound Secrets not speak, Dao Ancestor Life said with a faint smile, “Why? Don’t even have the courage to be confronted face to face? Or is it that he really already defected to the enemy? Toward the myriad races in the world, trillions of lifeforms, shouldn’t he give the world an explanation?”

Profound Secrets clenched his jaws tightly, being cornered by Dao Ancestor Life until he could not speak.

Lin Chaotian was giving him a huge problem!

Come, Ye Yuan would never return.

Not coming, Ye Yuan’s name of betrayal would be confirmed!

“Fine, I’ll go and invite him personally!” Profound Secrets said in a deep voice.

Dao Ancestor Life suddenly launching an attack immediately caused an uproar in the Heavenspan World.

After the great battle, the name of Saint Azure was currently like the noonday sun.

Furthermore, with the passage of time, the matter of Ye Yuan founding an eternally flourishing age was also revealed.

Very soon, Saint Azure became a god-like figure.

This kind of feat was simply incomparable.

But no one could have expected that Dao Ancestor Life actually made a move against Saint Azure at this time.

“You guys guess, will Lord Saint Azure keep the appointment or not?”

“Keep the appointment? Isn’t this seeking death! Very clearly, Lord Saint Azure is already highly meritorious now that it threatens the master! Dao Ancestor Life can’t tolerate him anymore!”

“You can’t say that! Concerning Saint Azure letting Daymeld go, this matter was a fact! His beloved is the divine daughter of the divine race. So who can guarantee that he won’t betray the human race for a woman?”

“Mn, your words make sense too! Right now, Dao Ancestor Life is going to confront Lord Saint Azure face to face. Let’s wait and see then.”

... ...

When he saw Profound Secrets again, Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “Oh? Dao Ancestor Life wants to see me? Alright, then let’s meet.”

Profound Secrets could see the sadness beneath Ye Yuan’s calm surface. The blow to him this time was really huge.

Having understood Ye Yuan’s life, Profound Secrets knew that Ye Yuan was someone who valued ties and affection immensely.

But the person that he loved deeply became the divine daughter of the divine race, who could understand the suffering involved?

But he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually agreed to it so neatly, without even thinking about it.

“Did you understand what I said to you just now? Lin Chaotian has schemed for a long time. He must have already made perfect preparations this time. You won’t be able to come back once you go!” Profound Secrets said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I don’t go, wouldn’t it confirm the name of defection? Furthermore, you personally came to look for me, but I defected. This is also a great irony to you and to your Jian Family. The name of Saint Azure isn’t important to me, but your father’s name of Saint Profound, I can’t allow them to sully it at all!”

When Profound Secrets heard that, his expression could not help changing.

He only cared about Ye Yuan’s safety but did not think of this level.

If Ye Yuan really escaped, it would be hard to guarantee that Lin Chaotian would not launch an attack against the Jian Family.

Profound Secrets frowned and said, “But do you know who Lin Chaotian is? He was in the first batch of geniuses who entered the Heavenly Hidden World. Back then, he was only half a step away from the realm of Grand Ancestor! In the Doomsday Battle later on, he became one of the survivors, and even became Dao Ancestor Life! After ten billion years, even if Heavenly Dao takes back the power of rules, his strength will likely not be affected too much as well! It can be said that he’s currently the human race’s strongest person!”

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You also know that he’s the strongest, then why doesn’t he come to kill me? With his strength, if he wanted to kill me, he would have long killed me. He’s afraid of my influence! But he only launched an attack at this time. Have you thought about why?”

Profound Secrets was startled and said, “You know why he’s targeting you?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Don’t know, but I can guess a little. Logically speaking, the person that he dreads the most right now should be Tian Qing. But the Doomsday Battle has yet to die down, and he’s already eager to attack me. This indicates that my threat in his eyes is even greater than Tian Qing’s. Therefore, he’d rather kill me first than to give me the chance to grow up.”

Profound Secrets had a shocked look. But thinking back, it was really the case.

But what was his basis to firmly believe that Ye Yuan posed an even greater threat than Tian Qing?

In his view, even if Ye Yuan fused time, space, and sword, these three great laws, it was also just a 50-50 chance against Tian Qing.

“But, if it’s like this, you can’t go even more! Once you go, even if Lin Chaotian can’t take you down, he’ll definitely detain you! You can forget about seeing the light of day again in this lifetime!” Profound Secrets said with a solemn expression.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “My mind is made up. You don’t need to persuade anymore. I want to take a look at just why this Dao Ancestor Life wants to make a move against me.”

... ...

Lord Saint Azure magnanimously accepted the appointment. This matter made everyone’s jaws drop.

No one could have expected that Ye Yuan would really walk right into the trap.

Even more people were watching the show. But the upper echelons who truly knew the inside story all knew that this was a certain-death situation!

No matter the result, Dao Ancestor Life absolutely would not let Ye Yuan leave alive!

They all thought that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to come.

After all, compared to his life, what did fame count for?

Although the name of Saint Azure was resounding, he was after all not a true expert.

Dao Ancestor Life, that was a supreme existence who could have a showdown with Tian Qing!

“Is it real or fake? Everyone says that Lord Saint Azure is wise without equal. But he actually have moments when he’s dumb too!”

“Heh heh, in my view, this Lord Saint Azure is merely a pedantic person who values his own reputation too much.”

“Mn, from being admired by trillions of life, to falling to the mortal world, this sort of thing isn’t what everyone can bear.”
