Chapter 3058: Coming Out on Top!

“Sure enough, Hegemon Chaos died here? Then can I find other Myriad Realms Mountains in this place?” Ye Yuan pondered.

Ye Yuan was still quite interested in the Myriad Realms Mountain.

This chaos heavenly treasure was made by Hegemon Chaos by exhausting all his effort.

Each one was a one-in-a-million treasure.

Seven combining into one, the power was boundless!

Furthermore, this treasure was undoubtedly the most suited for him.

Since Hegemon Chaos’ cultivation method was wrong, then this treasure’s refinement method was naturally wrong too.

Ye Yuan wondered if he could refine it with the Eternal River’s chaos, could the power be stronger?

The two Myriad Realms Mountains that he obtained previously, Ye Yuan had already refined them anew in the Eternal River.

The power of those two Myriad Realms Mountains, after combining together, had already reached the level of a grade three grandmist treasure.

With this third one, there was no problem stepping into grade four at all.

Before long, everyone discovered that seven to eight treasures appeared in a pile of quarry stones again!

“Is that … Azure Spirit Chaos Element Sword?”

......

“And also Cloudwhisper! This is the lifeblood treasure of Hegemon Yu Yang back then, with immensely formidable power!”

“Good stuff! Really good stuff! Just the middle-grade chaos heavenly treasures, there are two of them! Yun Xiang, it’s up to you!”

… …

The Hegemon Realms were extremely excited. Although the treasures here were not as many as before, the quality was a level higher!

Which of these people could remain calm when they saw it?

Yun Xiang said confidently, “Relax. This seat has been studying Formation Dao all my life. The array formations that I’ve seen before are more than the rice that this brat has eaten. Can I still lose to him?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t boast too much. Be careful that you get face-slapped in a while.”

Yun Xiang said disdainfully, “With the likes of you? Boy, you’d better think about how you should deal with yourself after this seat comprehends Heaven!”

Ye Yuan smiled and declined to comment.

Yun Xiang said, “The few of you old fellows work harder for this seat too! Otherwise, nobody can think about walking out of this grand array! Begin!”

Zhang Hexin six great Hegemons took their positions. Under Yun Xiang’s word of command, the six people dashed out like lightning, pouncing straight for those treasures.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

An explosion sound came over again. The six people were blasted until they fell flat on their backs, looking extremely wretched.

Putting it bluntly, they were just looking for abuse.

To say that the power of this grand array section was great, it was not. But to say that it was small, it was not small either.

The few people were blasted until they had bloody noses and swollen faces, and broken hands and hands. It was unavoidable.

They were bound to make an exhibition of themselves.

Why did they not let others go?

Not reaching Hegemon Realm, going would be to seek death. Without being able to even touch the array formation, there would be no value at all.

Hence, they could only greatly inconvenience these few old fellows.

“F*cking hell, Your Father has lived to this ripe old age. It’s still the first time that I’m being toyed by someone! Yun Xiang, if you lose to that boy, this seat will find trouble with you!” A human Hegemon roared angrily.

“I know that there are definitely still old fellows who hid themselves. If you guys have the ability, don’t ever show your faces!?Humph!”

The six great Hegemons were very depressed too. But it could not be helped as well. Who asked them to jump out first?

Each Hegemon had their own means. If they used their respective means to hide among tens of thousands of people, there would really be no way of discovering.

But it was certain that there were definitely still quite a few hidden old fellows.

Yun Xiang and Ye Yuan both stared at the grand array without shifting their gazes, feeling every movement and action of the grand array.

The grand array was an organic entity. But without a doubt, the buried treasure places were the only explicit passageway of the grand array.

Want to understand the Heaven formation, one could only start from here.

At virtually the same time, Ye Yuan and Yun Xiang held a piece of rock in their hands and started drawing a formation diagram on the ground, and fell into deep thought.

Clearly, this sub-formation was even harder and more complicated than the one before.

Because previously, Ye Yuan did not draw a formation diagram.

When everyone saw the situation, they crowded over one after another.

“You all look, Hegemon Yun Xiang and Ye Yuan both drew nine symbols. Each of these nine symbols represents an array element. Could it be that Heaven formation that’s known as the number one killing formation in the world, actually only has nine array elements? This … is also too inconceivable!”

Origin powerhouses who understood array formations started explaining the significance of these symbols to the others.

When many people heard, they all exclaimed with admiration.

There were many array formation schools of thought. There were naturally many kinds of array elements too.

There were nine by nine, 81 types of the most basic array elements.

And some high-level array elements were derived from these 81 types of array elements; complicated and elaborate, extremely hard to grasp.

The more complicated the array elements used, and the more massive they were, naturally the stronger the power of the grand array.

But no one could have thought that this most terrifying grand array in the legends was actually so simple!

“Eh,?why did Ye Yuan stop?”

“Hegemon Yun Xiang’s pen is still moving like flying, looks like she’s actually leading Ye Yuan!”

“Like I said, how can a mere Emperor Vast Heaven possibly be stronger than a Hegemon Realm? Ye Yuan this boy has shot himself in the foot this time!”

… …

Suddenly, Yun Xiang stopped too and said to the six great Hegemons, “You all go and storm again!”

The six people’s faces turned black at the same time, almost spewing out a mouthful of old blood. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This process was not that fun!

However, seeing that Yun Xiang seemed to have the advantage, they could only clench their teeth and storm the formation once more.

The result was self-evident.

The six great Hegemons returned with bloody noses and swollen faces again.

“I’ll have to trouble seniors to go and rush it again.” Who knew that when they just came back, Ye Yuan added on and instructed them.

Zhang Hexin said in a great rage, “Boy, are you messing with the few of us? Didn’t you see the attempt just now?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I saw it, but there are still some areas that I don’t understand. Therefore, I’ll have to trouble everyone!”

“Your Father isn’t going anymore!” Zhang Hexin said in a great rage.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said nonchalantly, “That works too, but if Hegemon Yun Xiang fails, don’t look for me. At most, let’s die together here. With you seven great Hegemons,?oh,?wait, I estimate that there are at least 20 Hegemons here, maybe even more! With so many people being buried in death with me, I think that it isn’t considered a loss to me too!”

Zhang Hexin’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Consider yourself ruthless! Let’s go!”

Right now, there were clearly only Ye Yuan and Hegemon Yun Xiang two people who had the ability to crack the formation.

If they really offended this boy badly and if Yun Xiang really failed, they would really have to die here.

The six great Hegemons attacked the array formation again according to the position that Ye Yuan pointed at.

Ugh, very miserable!

Just like that, Yun Xiang and Ye Yuan two people used the six great Hegemons as hard-laborers, ordering them around over and over again.

However, the six great Hegemons’ strengths were evident. With them taking action, it indeed saved a lot of effort.

Three months later, Yun Xiang suddenly put down the rock in her hand and got up and walked toward the grand array.

Everyone’s mind trembled!

“It’s here. It’s here! Sure enough, it’s still a Hegemon level heavenly formation master who’s more powerful!”

“Hegemon Yun Xiang cracked the formation first! Ye Yuan this boy will suffer!”

“Hahaha?… Ye Yuan, you no longer have utility value! This time, I’ll see if you still don’t die!” Kong Tan said with a loud laugh.

… …

Ye Yuan ignored him and was still writing and drawing.

However, no one paid attention to him anymore.

Everyone’s gazes were focused on Hegemon Yun Xiang.
