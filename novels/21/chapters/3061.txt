Chapter 3060: Messing With You All on Purpose!

“Comprehend formation? Comprehend what formation?” Ye Yuan said with a blank face.

Zhang Hexin’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Punk, are you feigning ignorance to this seat?”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “Sorry, the things that I comprehended were all in those symbols. Now, those symbols are gone. I also don’t know how I should comprehend the formation anymore.”

Zhang Hexin almost spurted out a mouthful of old blood. This boy was intentionally putting on airs!

He did not believe that with Ye Yuan’s intellect, he would not remember those symbols.

Ye Yuan was clearly taking revenge by saying so!

“Boy, do you really think that this seat doesn’t dare to kill you?” Zhang Hexin released killing intent and locked onto Ye Yuan.

But sadly, Ye Yuan did not seem to feel it and said nonchalantly, “What’s Senior so fierce for? The more you scare me, the more I’ll forget! The more I forget, the harder it will be to crack the formation.”

Zhang Hexin was going crazy. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

By the side, Kong Hai said with a cold snort, “Talking crap with him for? Torment him well. This seat doesn’t believe that he dares to not obey!”

The moment this was said, Zhang Hexin was clearly somewhat stirred.

But this was also a risky move. Yun Xiang could not do it anymore. There was only Ye Yuan left now.

If they really provoked Ye Yuan and had a life-and-death struggle, then everyone’s lives would be left behind here.

......

But, to make him beg Ye Yuan obsequiously, he could not put aside this ego too.

Ye Yuan’s meaning was very clear: lower your head and admit your fault!

In the end, face still triumphed over everything.

Zhang Hexin’s figure suddenly moved explosively, directly grabbing toward Ye Yuan, his speed inconceivably swift.

Of course, Ye Yuan did not plan to dodge either.

He still stood there, perfectly calm and composed, as if the target of Zhang Hexin’s attack was not him.

Just as Zhang Hexin was about to grab Ye Yuan, a figure suddenly rushed out from the flank.

Bang!

Zhang Hexin was in disarray, taking hundreds of steps back in a row before barely managing to stabilize his figure.

A figure was standing in front of Ye Yuan with his hands behind his back.

“Humph!?A bunch of good-for-nothings!”

Zhang Hexin’s expression changed drastically, and he cried out in surprise, “Hegemon Yun Shang!”

Human race itinerant cultivator, Supreme Hegemon, Hegemon Yun Shang!

He finally could not resist and took action.

Hegemon Yun Shang snorted coldly and said, “A few idiots! If you all are courting death yourselves, this seat doesn’t care. But do you want the others to be buried in death together with you all?”

The expressions of Zhang Hexin and the rest were very ugly. Hegemon Realm powerhouses being called idiots in front of so many people, their faces had nowhere to go!

His expression turned dark, and he said, “Yun Shang, who do you think you are? It’s not your turn to act wildly in front of my Melody Nether Heavenly Sect yet!”

Hegemon Realm Yun Shang had a disdainful look as he said, “Your Melody Nether Heavenly Sect is very strong, but looking across all the heavens, it’s also nothing more than this! Do you really know how many Hegemon Realms came this time? How do you know that there aren’t Great Beyond powerhouses among them? This seat is scolding you for your own good! Otherwise, if others made a move, it might take your life!”

Zhang Hexin’s expression changed, and he could not resist sweeping his gaze over.

But, no matter how he looked, he could not find which one was a Hegemon Realm too.

What he did just now was indeed somewhat committing a taboo.

He was willing to take the risk, but it did not mean that other Hegemons were willing to brave the risk.

With these people not coming forward, it was naturally because they felt that it was not yet time to take action.

But, even if it was a Great Beyond powerhouse, they might not be able to get out of the Heaven formation alive too!

“You idiots! If you’re not as capable as other people, just directly apologize! Right now, this young friend is our only hope of getting out. You actually dared to attack him? If you guys really want to kill him, sure! This time, this seat won’t stop you all. You all see whether or not someone will make a move and kill you guys!” Hegemon Yun Shang’s gaze was cold as he said.

The seven great Hegemons all had gloomy faces.

But hearing Hegemon Yun Shang’s words, they were like being enlightened, knocking them awake.

Seeing everyone remain silent, Yun Shang said coolly, “Why? No more talking? If you’re not talking, then put your ego aside! You guys just do whatever Young Friend Ye says!”

Finished saying this, he turned to Ye Yuan again and said with a smile, “Young Friend Ye, looking on account of this seat’s face, how about you calm your anger? If you’re not happy, this seat can act and help you teach them a good lesson!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Yun Shang’s face naturally has to be given. But I’ve indeed pretty forgotten the process of deduction. If I want to continue comprehending the formation, I’ll need the various seniors to take action and storm the formation anew!”

“You’re f*cking lying through your teeth!” Zhang Hexin swore.

Six great hegemons, their lungs were almost exploding from anger.

Meanwhile, Hegemon Yun Xiang was secretly rejoicing, pretending to be dead at one side.

She was already heavily injured and could not go and storm the formation.

This sensation of rushing the formation was horrible.

“Mn?”?Hegemon Yun Shang’s brows furrowed, his face revealing anger.

Zhang Hexin and the rest immediately withered up.

Ye Yuan stepped out of the ranks and made a hand gesture to the few as he said smilingly, “Seniors, please go ahead!”

Zhang Hexin had a black face as he said, “Boy, this seat has remembered this score!”

Ye Yuan just smiled, indifferent about it.

An hour later, a group of people came back with bloody noses and swollen faces.

But Ye Yuan still did not have the intention of getting started.

“Boy, we’ve already returned from storming the formation. Why haven’t you gotten started?” Zhang Hexin said in a solemn voice.

“Oh,?I got the position wrong just now. I haven’t found the place to start with. You guys go and rush it again,” Ye Yuan said with a grin.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Six powerful auras surged to the sky.

The six great Hegemons were enraged.

“Boy, you dare to mess with us?” Zhang Hexin bellowed.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Yeah, I’m messing with you all. Do you have any objections? The few of you terrorized me for half a day. But I am not allowed to mess with you once?”

“This seat will kill you!” Zhang Hexin’s roar was virtually distorting.

His current fury could be seen.

“Uh-humph!”?Right at this time, Hegemon Yun Shang coughed, instantly extinguishing the six people’s fury.

“Boy, consider yourself ruthless!” Zhang Hexin roared angrily and stormed the formation again with endless anger.

The moment the six people left, Ye Yuan picked up a stone and started drawing swiftly.

The content of the drawing was exactly the same as before.

Everyone’s faces revealed strange looks.

“Tsk tsk,?what happened really broadened my horizons today! An Emperor Vast Heaven toyed with six Hegemon Realms in the palm of his hand!”

“When the six great Hegemons return and see that Ye Yuan has already recovered these, will they vomit blood?”

“Sigh,?Hegemon Hexin was too impulsive! If he had long known, couldn’t he fly off the handle after enduring it and finish waiting for Hegemon Yun Xiang to storm the formation? Now, he has utterly lost his face!”

… …

Everyone started to sympathize with Zhang Hexin six people.

Even Hegemon Yun Shang had a strange look on his face too, secretly feeling glad that he did not provoke this kid.

Otherwise, the outcome would be really miserable!

Before leaving Heaven formation, I absolutely must not provoke this kid!

Hegemon Yun Shang secretly made up his mind.

Another hour passed. The six people returned with injuries again.

When Zhang Hexin saw the dense drawings on the ground, his entire person was petrified.

He suddenly discovered that he had no temper anymore!

His temper was bad, but the fury that filled his chest had nowhere to vent at all!
