Chapter 2194: Battling Divine Son!

This was a battle without hope, but Ye Yuan’s arrogance made heaven and earth terrified!

Even for a powerhouse like Nineorigin, the look of disdain on his face gradually faded away too.

What replaced it was a hint of respect!

Ye Yuan was not a god. Under the attacks of several hundred Empyreans that spanned the sky, even if he was proficient in spatial law, he already sustained considerable injuries too.

But this did not affect his astonishing imposing momentum in the least bit.

“Kill for me! You fools, do you want to anger this emperor to death? He’s just one person! Only one person!”

Manya was enraged until he stomped his feet and roared at his subordinates.

Those Fifth and Sixth Firmament Empyrean devil monster commanders also seemed to feel ashamed, all roaring and charging toward Ye Yuan.

At this time, the abyss monsters’ numbers plummeted sharply, but it scaled new heights in terms of quality.

Without a bunch of initial-stage Empyreans dragging down, but gained a batch of even stronger Sixth Firmament Empyreans!

How daunting was this kind of strength?

Several dozen black figures dashed over from all directions, virtually without dead angles.

The powerful aura practically sealed off all of the space!

An attack without dead angles!

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Xin’s mouth.

“Dead! No matter how impressive his spatial law is, he’d definitely die without a doubt under this strike too!” Xin said with a cold smile.

He pondered about it. If he were Ye Yuan, under this kind of attack without the slightest blind spots, there would be no hope for survival.

“Immobilize!”

One word emerging, time froze!

Everything around came to a standstill!

The several dozen incomparably berserk abyss monsters were instantly immobilized in midair.

No matter how formidable his strength was, no matter how many the numbers, under Heavenly Dao True Word, it was to no avail too!

Xin’s pupils constricted, looking at this scene in incredible shock. It was as if he had seen a ghost.

Even Nineorigin’s pupils also shrunk, his eyes revealing a hint of astonishment.

Although he knew that it was impossible for Manya to deceive him, he still did not quite dare to believe it.

Heavenly Dao True Word, Time Freeze!

This kind of thing, even he could not do it too!

The noble Divine Race could not do it too!

This mere Third Firmament Empyrean human actually accomplished it?

But at this moment, he finally understood why Ye Yuan could bring Yue Mengli and escape!

“Heretic Dragon Dominating Space!”

Ye Yuan shouted angrily, the divine dragon appearing once more!

Upon trampling down, the Fifth Firmament Empyreans were immediately pulverized into a scattered mess of flesh and blood; not a single one survived.

Sixth Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters also scattered flying everywhere, all heavily injured!

The combination of these two mighty dragon race innate divine abilities may be rated as invincible!

If not for Ye Yuan’s realm being too low, killing these abyss monsters would be no different from killing chickens too.

But even so, this foot going down, Sixth Firmament Empyreans sustained serious injuries!

At this moment, everyone deeply felt Ye Yuan’s might!

Even though there were many powerhouses here, there were quite a number of late-stage Empyrean Realm abyss monsters and also the Heavenly Emperor level Manya, there was even a supreme powerhouse like Nineorigin.

But Ye Yuan this Third Firmament Empyrean still brought to them an indelible shock!

Was it that abyss monsters were too weak?

Of course not!

It was just that Ye Yuan was too strong!

However, Ye Yuan did not stop. Several dozen streaks of sword light instantly emerged, flying straight for those Sixth Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters.

Puu, puu, puu ...

Those abyss monsters fell to the ground with a loud bang, without the strength to battle anymore.

The entire scene fell into dead silence once more.

One exchange, several dozen Fifth Firmament Empyreans died, and Sixth Firmament Empyreans were seriously injured on the brink of death!

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and grabbed toward them. The tarnished black devil crystals were all sucked over by him.

With his cultivation method revolving, streams of black energy poured into Ye Yuan’s body like smoke.

“This ... How is this possible? How can a puny human be so powerful?”

“Just what kind of existence in this human?!”

“Between this human and Divine Son, who do you guys think is stronger or weaker?”

... ...

These abyss monsters could not refrain from thinking like this.

Seemingly wanting to affirm what they were thinking, the tip of Ye Yuan’s sword raised up, pointing at Xin as he called in a clear voice, “Divine Race’s Divine Son, is it? Don’t you guys praise yourselves to be the race chosen by gods? Do you dare to battle or not?!”

Ye Yuan was covered in blood from head to toe. Carrying the momentum of his initial victory, he was unrivaled and domineering, giving Xin an extremely strong sense of oppression.

Xin’s face fell, his gaze icy.

A lowly human actually dared to provoke the mighty Divine Race!

Truly reckless and blind.

“Humph! Ant-like thing, you, still don’t have the qualifications to challenge me!” Xin said disdainfully.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and was full of scorn as he said, “Is it no qualification, or is it that you don’t dare? Or is it that your might relies on these subordinates with profound cultivation realms?”

His words were full of contempt and disdain.

Xin’s expression changed, his eyes spewing fire.

Nineorigin’s gaze flickered, and he opened his mouth and said, “Xin, this boy is worthy of you taking action!”

Xin frowned and said, “Uncle Nineorigin, I, Xin, growing until today, have experienced thousands of major and minor battles, I’ve never made a move against an opponent weaker than me before! This brat is only a Third Firmament Empyrean. What qualification does he have to have me take action?”

Nineorigin said, “You’ve already witnessed his strength. You ask yourself. When at his realm, could you have done better than him?”

Xin choked when he heard that. Clearly, Nineorigin’s words pricked his sore spot.

Then he heard Nineorigin slowly saying, “Furthermore, I feel that this boy hasn’t gone all out!”

Xin’s face changed, his eyes revealing a look of disbelief. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Even after using Heavenly Dao True Word, he still had not used his full strength?

Xin’s gaze flickered and he said, “Fine! This divine son wants to see how much capability this brat has!”

Done talking, Xin’s figure swayed and already arrived opposite of Ye Yuan.

He looked at Ye Yuan using a gaze like looking at a dead person and said with a cold smile, “Brat, this is you seeking death yourself. Don’t blame me! Bring forth your full strength. Otherwise, you won’t have the chance anymore!”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Whether you can make me bring out all of my strength or not will have to depend on your ability!”

Xin laughed coldly, the aura on his entire body fluctuated, the shirt on his upper body directly blowing off.

On the defined muscles, eight blue patterns swam indeterminately on his body, giving people a mysterious and profound feeling.

Ye Yuan’s gaze shrunk, slightly revealing a look of surprise.

“Lowly human, I’ll let you understand how you die! What you humans cultivate is Divine Dao, while what our Divine Race cultivates is Heavenly Dao! We don’t need to comprehend Heavenly Emperor. As long as we inscribe Heavenly Dao on our bodies, we’ll be able to mobilize Heavenly Dao! This Divine Son is currently at the middle-stage Seven-mark Heavenly Dao Realm, which is also your middle-stage Empyrean Realm! With your strength, this divine son simply finds it beneath my dignity to take action!”

Xin had a proud look as he continued, “Do you think that your Heavenly Dao True Word is very formidable? Heh heh, I’m not afraid to tell you this. Each punch that we throw out, that’s a punch of Heavenly Dao! What does Heavenly Dao True Word count for?”

Ye Yuan looked at Xin and said with a cold smile, “Really so much crap! Talking so much, is it to show off your sense of superiority? Sense of superiority is beaten out using fists, not through words from your mouth!”

Xin’s face fell, and he said with a cold yell, “Courting death!”

Swoosh!

In a blink, Xin’s figure disappeared.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, all the hairs on his body standing on end.

Having no time to think, he directly slammed a punch out.

Bang!

A terrifying air billow rippled out. Ye Yuan’s figure flew out backward.
