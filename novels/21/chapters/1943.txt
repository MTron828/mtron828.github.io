Chapter 1947: Penetrating Insight

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Your Excellency, the Cloudmoon Imperial City’s envoy team has arrived and are currently requesting an audience outside,” Ning Tianping reported.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Let them come in. The Cloudmoon Imperial City and the Myriad Treasure Tower have very deep connections. I can’t shirk responsibility either. Furthermore, the city lord came to visit in person, so it’s also considered giving us sufficient face.”

Ning Tianping said, “Your Excellency, this sort of thing, wouldn’t it do to let City Lord Zuo go and handle it? Why is there a need to welcome personally?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s cooling to have your back against a large tree! I naturally don’t need to give face to anyone but myself. But the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City is hard to defend just based on my power alone. With a Heavenly Emperor faction as a backer, it would naturally be much safer.”

When Ning Tianping heard that, he was filled with deep respect in his heart.

In his eyes, city lords were mostly selfish and sought personal gain, fleecing the blood and sweat of martial artists.

But Ye Yuan was different. His nature was uninhibited, and he did not like to be constrained by an identity like a patrolling inspector.

But in order to protect the people around him, he continuously let Heavenly Eagle develop and strengthen, and even made friends with a major force like the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Encountering this sort of thing, one could only compromise out of consideration for the general interest too.

Ning Tianping was clear that with Ye Yuan’s character, he was actually unwilling to bother with this kind of mundane affairs.

After Ning Tianping withdrew, a group of people walked in after a while.

The person at the front was a middle-aged man, having Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity cultivation, being the strongest person among the party.

When that person saw Ye Yuan, he immediately cupped his fists and said with a big laugh, “I’ve long heard that Master Ye has achieved your ambitions while young. Upon meeting today, you’re indeed extraordinary!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Yuan also clasped his hands and said smilingly, “City Lord Xu Guang has an extraordinary presence and isn’t a common person. Breaking through to become a True God is right around the corner. Come, come, come! Sit down and talk.”

Everyone sat down as host and guest. Ye Yuan said, “The medicinal pills that City Lord Xu Guang is asking for, this Ye will refine them as quickly as possible. I’ll have to trouble you to wait patiently for two days.”

Xu Guang laughed loudly and said, “No rush, no rush. I know that Master Ye’s Alchemy Dao is unparalleled under the heavens, why would I be in a hurry? This Xu knows that it’s not easy to request for Master Ye to take action and naturally can’t treat you shabbily. I have a precious treasure here. Master Ye, please take a look.”

Ye Yuan nodded with a smile as he said, “Oh? City Lord Xu said it so solemnly, then this Ye really have to take a look. Tianping, give the orders; let City Lord Xu they all prepare a banquet and treat City Lord Xu’s party cordially.”

Ning Tianping was somewhat puzzled, but still acknowledged it and withdrew.

Xu Guang took out a tiny tray with a smile. Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp, immediately feeling the extraordinariness of this tray. It was actually a true god mystic treasure!

“Master Ye, this treasure is called ... Traceless Spatial Lock!”

As Xu Guang said, the surrounding air seemed to solidify, everything became blurry.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly and did not reveal an overly surprised expression.

Xu Guang was still all smiles as he said, “Once it activates, the surrounding space will be locked! The people outside can’t enter, the people inside ... can’t go out! Heh heh, Master Ye, are you going to submit obediently, or do you want the few of us brothers to take action?”

Ye Yuan looked at Xu Guang and said indifferently, “The few of you are members of Deathsoul Gate?”

Xu Guang’s expression changed slightly and said, “How did you know?”

Ye Yuan looked at ‘Xu Guang’ and said indifferently, “Your disguise is indeed pretty good, unfortunately ... it can’t deceive my eyes. To have such attainments in the art of disguising, apart from the Deathsoul Gate, I can’t think of others.”

Having cultivated the perfect sixth transformation golden body, the benefits that Ye Yuan obtained was tremendous.

This time, Ye Yuan cleansed his marrows and remolded his fleshy body, his visual prowess also obtained a massive improvement.

Furthermore, the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil had followed Ye Yuan for a long time, making use of Ye Yuan’s perfect visual strength, the power increased by more than a magnitude.

Presently, using fiery golden eyes to describe Ye Yuan’s visual strength was also not overboard1.

The moment ‘Xu Guang’ and the rest entered, they were seen through by Ye Yuan.

This party was precisely the five assassins sent out by the Deathsoul Gate.

And ‘Xu Guang’ was precisely the Fourth Firmament True God powerhouse, Lu Xin.

Lu Xin looked at Ye Yuan, his gaze revealing an uncertain look. But very soon, he felt at ease and opened his mouth and said, “Everyone says that Master Ye’s high morality reaches the clouds and values the people around him very highly; it’s indeed true! You saw through us, but you sent away that Ning Family’s brat. Looks like you’re afraid of accidentally hurting him.”

Ye Yuan was silent, considered to have acquiesced to it.

The Deathsoul Gate sent a First Firmament True God last time. This time, they would naturally be stronger than last time.

Ning Tianping being here, he did not have the confidence in ensuring his safety.

“Heh heh, looks like you already have the awareness and plan on making a trip with us?” Lu Xin said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan said calmly, “You guys want to capture me back to refine pills for you all?”

Lu Xin said, “I’m only following the orders from upstairs. As for capturing you back to do what, that’s not what I can ask. Alright, giving you a chance now; seal your divine sea yourself and follow us.”

Ye Yuan sneered coldly and said, “Go? You all killed Xu Guang’s party and sneaked into my Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, could it be that you still want to leave alive?”

Lu Xin and the rest were taken back and could not help laughing as they said, “Talking wildly, just the likes of you, a Celestial Deity Realm, can you still resist us?”

Suddenly, a figure appeared beside Ye Yuan. It was precisely Bai Tong.

With Dustless’s warning, how could Ye Yuan possibly not be on guard?

So in this half a year, Bai Tong had always been inside the Purple Extreme Hall in closed-seclusion and had always been following by Ye Yuan’s side too.

When Lu Xin saw Bai Tong, his pupils could not help constricting, expression suddenly changing.

This person’s aura was actually identical with him, a Fourth Firmament True God powerhouse too!

When did Heavenly Eagle Imperial City have such an expert?

Could it be that Mo Qing died at his hands?

“I’ll leave this guy to you, no problem, right?” Ye Yuan said.

Bai Tong rolled his eyes and said, “Take away the ‘right’ word.”

Ye Yuan was unable to stifle his laughter when he heard that.

This guy really had cold humor!

The two people chatted, not taking Lu Xin five people seriously at all.

Lu Xin smiled coldly and said, “Fool, so what even if there’s a Fourth Firmament True God? Could it be that he, a Celestial Deity Realm, can still deal with four Second Firmament True Gods?”

The other four people were all Second Firmament True God powerhouses.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Wouldn’t you know after trying?”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan pushed with the tip of his feet, figure immediately turning into an afterimage, pouncing towards one of the killers.

That assassin had a scornful look, world power suddenly erupting, wanting to take Ye Yuan down a notch.

While the other three people watched this scene calmly, waiting to see Ye Yuan’s wretched appearance.

Upstairs only said not to kill Ye Yuan, but did not say not to let him get injured.

Since he was looking for abuse himself, then it also could not be blamed on others.

In a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan arrived.

Lifting his hand, it was a straight punch, looking like mortals fighting.

Bang!

That assassin’s world domain was immediately smashed until it sunk in, his entire person flying out like a cannonball.

“Puhwark!”

The assassin fell to the ground, opening his mouth and vomiting out a large mouthful of blood.

The pupils of the other four people shrunk, looking at this scene in astonishment and disbelieving faces.

“Sixth transformation golden body! He’s actually a body cultivator! No, wait, even if it’s the sixth transformation golden body, it’s also not possible to be so strong! Could ... Could he have ... a perfect sixth transformation golden body?” Lu Xin looked at Ye Yuan and said in astonishment.
