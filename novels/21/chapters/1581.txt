1585 Competing on Fire Control

Deercry was furious!

His old face could be said to not give face to anyone except Head Elder.

He did not expect that today, he actually had to lower his head to a little brat!

But if he did not lower his head now, it was equivalent to challenging the entire Elders Association.

This crime, he could not undertake it.

If it really blew up, he absolutely could not gain anything!

Deercry gritted his teeth and said, “E-Elder Ye, just now, it was Deercry who was impetuous. E-Elder Ye, please don’t take offense!”

When he said ‘Elder Ye’ two words, he felt goosebumps breaking out all over his body. It was truly uncomfortable all over.

When the others saw this scene, there was an indescribable peculiarity.

Deercry was old until he was almost entering the coffin, but he extended a formal apology to such a young elder. There was an indescribable sense of discordance.

“Mn, looking on account of Head Elder’s face, I’ll spare you this time! If you were to offend again next time, you’ll be punished with due severity according to the Pill Tower’s rules!” Ye Yuan had a very magnanimous appearance, really like he was lecturing a junior.

This kid even went along with it!

Deercry snorted coldly and said, “Elder Ye, I’m seeking your advice today to liven things up for the Pill Tower’s competition, how about it?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’re merely a deacon, so what qualifications do you have to come and seek advice from me?”

The moment these words came out, a wave of boos came from below.

Clearly, they already put up with Ye Yuan’s approach of avoidance to the extreme.

Always using the identity of an elder to come and pressure people, it was also very hard to convince the masses.

When Deercry saw this scene, he could not help being overjoyed in his heart.

Deercry smiled coldly and said, “Heh heh, Elder Ye is merely a Three-star Alchemy God, no matter how lacking this old man is, I’m also a middle-rank Four-star Alchemy God. Could it be that I’m not qualified to be your opponent? Or is it that you’re simply holding a post without real qualifications and don’t dare to accept the challenge at all?”

Facing the booing, Ye Yuan did not care at all and said disdainfully, “If I can’t even win you, then what qualifications do I have to be an elder? Forget it, since you all want to witness this elder’s strength, then I’ll satisfy you all.”

Deercry revealed a look of surprise. He even thought that Ye Yuan was going to be stubborn until the end and prepared a whole bunch of narratives.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually agreed.

“Huhu, then Elder Ye please advise,” Deercry clasped his hands and said with a smile.

He did not think that Ye Yuan could win him at all. If he could not even win a Three-star Alchemy God, this lifetime was also in vain.

However, Ye Yuan said, “When did I say that I was going to compete with you?”

Deercry froze but saw Ye Yuan clasp his hands at Rou Xu and said, “Head Elder, ever since entering the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, this Ye heard that your Alchemy Dao is exceedingly formidable. No one can beat you in this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. This Ye is untalented and wants to challenge Head Elder today. I wonder ... how does Head Elder feel about it?”

Everyone was dumbfounded, this boy was going to challenge Head Elder?

He was crazy, right?!

The entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, apart from Second Elder, there was actually still someone who dared to challenge Head Elder!

Head Elder and Second Elder were pinnacle existences in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

They were the absolute leading echelon of Alchemy Dao!

The other elders were not on the same level as the two of them at all.

A measly little Three-star Alchemy God actually dared to directly challenge Head Elder!

Only an imperceptible faint smile flashed across the corners of Second Elder Xuan Yu’s mouth.

He suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan’s appearance was simply a gospel to him.

The things that he was good at, Ye Yuan was more skilled.

The things that he was not good at, Ye Yuan was adept too!

Most likely, everyone would think that Ye Yuan was overestimating his own ability. But he knew that Ye Yuan facing off with Rou Xu, he would definitely completely trounce the other party!

He and Rou Xu fought for so many years, he was all too clear about Rou Xu’s strength.

This move of Ye Yuan’s was truly too brilliant!

If Rou Xu agreed, he would definitely lose.

At that time, Rou Xu’s face would be swept clean. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If Rou Xu capitalized on his identity and did not agree, Ye Yuan could also take advantage of it and shake off the other party’s pestering.

If Rou Xu was smart, he should not stalemate with Ye Yuan anymore.

Otherwise, he would die very horribly today.

Rou Xu also froze and immediately laughed and said, “Oh? Elder Ye actually wants to challenge this old man? Huhu, truly the young are fearless! If this old man avoids it and did not battle with you, it would probably dampen everyone’s spirits today. Fine, this old man agrees!”

Xuan Yu looked at Rou Xu rather surprisedly but immediately shut his eyes again.

Courting death oneself, then it could not be helped.

“Head Elder actually agreed!”

“To be able to see Head Elder personally take action, it’s truly hard to come by!”

“Haha, that kid thought that Head Elder would relent because of his identity and won’t fuss about it with him. Yet, Head Elder agreed!”

...

Many people from Head Elder’s faction were all mocking Ye Yuan for overestimating his ability and also looked forward to Head Elder taking action very much.

Rou Xu and Ye Yuan’s pill battle could naturally only refine Three-star divine pills.

And in the attainments of Three-star divine pills, Head Elder had long reached the acme of perfection already. Wasn’t dealing with Ye Yuan as simple as capturing a prey with ease?

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “Head Elder, today’s main show is the Pill Tower’s competition. We can’t snatch other people’s limelight. Why not put our sparring after the competition?”

Rou Xu nodded his head and said, “May as well, up to you! Pill Tower competition, begin!”

A deacon came to the center of the square and said in a clear voice, “First round, competing on fire control. Requesting the kindling!”

The moment the voice faded, the top of the Pill Tower suddenly spewed out a stream of flames.

In a blink of an eye, it was like a rain of flames fell down, scattering everywhere.

At this time, several hundred Three-star disciples formed a huge circle. Those flame rain actually landed beside them accurately.

These flames were rank three divine fires too but did not have special attributes, as if all of the spirituality was wiped away.

The first round, competing on fire control, these Three-star disciples had to control these divine fires without spirituality and eradicate the other people’s divine fire.

This round would eliminate a large portion of Three-star disciples. Only 100 people would be left behind in the end to enter the second round.

This kind of competition was very fair to everyone. Everybody’s flame was identical and there was not the slightest aspect to resort of trickery.

What they could do was improve their fire controlling skills and defeat the rest.

Several hundred elite disciples competing with fire inside a circle, this scene was extremely spectacular.

“Sigh, competing on fire control this round has nothing to compete in. There’s no suspense at all!”

“Yeah, Song Qiyang’s fire controlling arts leaves people far behind in the dust. Within Three-stars, he has no rival at all.”

“Song Qiyang will probably deal a vicious blow this time. Those Three-star disciples of Second Elder’s will be a bit dangerous this time.”

...

Since it was competing on fire master, one would have to ruthlessly exterminate other people’s divine fire.

Song Qiyang currently had a stomach full of anger, he would definitely target Second Elder’s disciples.

“Begin!”

Following the deacon’s loud yell, the fire competition officially drew back the curtains.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Song Qiyang’s mouth. Raising a fingertip, that divine fire flew out obediently.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

It was only to see countless flames intertwined together, immediately causing everyone to fall into a chaotic battle.

“Puhwark!”

Song Qiyang’s flame was akin to a sharp sword, directly extinguishing a Second Elder’s disciple’s flame.

The slaughter, begun!
