Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

An astonishing aura approached from afar, arriving with a howl.

Daymeld’s aura outshone the others, overshadowing all of the divine race powerhouses.

He was too strong!

Detecting Ni Xuan and the rest approaching them, Daymeld gave a cold snort and said, “Humph! A bunch of bugs who get in the way! You all go and stop them, this progenitor will personally go and kill that brat! Also, that army, don’t let a single one off! Kill them all for me!”

He clearly became aware of the unpredictable army’s terror too. He decided to directly eliminate it and sever future troubles forever.

Under the word of command, thousands of powerhouses rushed in like a swarm of hornets and confronted Ni Xuan and the rest very quickly.

An astonishing great battle instantly broke out.

While on the other side, Ye Yuan detected Daymeld’s arrival. Ye Yuan immediately sent the order to retreat.

“Wan Zhen, Pang Zhen, let’s split up and retreat in the direction of Eight Void Mountain! Don’t feel attached to the battle! Just retreat to Eight Void Mountain, and you guys will have won!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

The two people’s hearts turned somber, and they hurriedly complied.

Charging all the way, the unpredictable army opened up a gap very quickly and retreated in the direction of the Eight Void Mountain.

Daymeld already issued a certain-kill order. The unpredictable army affected the entire divine race army’s nerves. The moment they retreated, the entire divine race army chased after.

As for Ye Yuan, he urged spacetime law to the limit, heading in the direction of the main peak.

With his current strength, it was simply impossible to be Daymeld’s match.

Once Daymeld caught up, that would be a road that led to death.

“Hahaha, kid, we meet again! Today, this progenitor is here to repay your courtesy of an arm, what are you running for?” Behind him came Daymeld’s unbridled laughter.

Daymeld was well-deserving of being the Heaven Lineage’s progenitor level powerhouse, his speed was actually much faster than Ye Yuan.

His strength was suffocatingly strong.

“Humph! It’s a pity that my cultivation realm back then was too low! I wish that I could have slaughtered you, this old dog!” Ye Yuan’s head did not even turn back as he said with a cold snort.

Daymeld was indifferent and said with a big laugh, “Kid, there are no ifs in this world! You couldn’t kill me back then and me killing you today, this is all destined by heaven! You run, I want to see where you can run to! Eight Void Mountain’s grand array is a rule grand array. Unless you can escape to the top of the mountain, otherwise, this progenitor can still kill you!”

To Daymeld, Eight Void Mountain’s grand array was nothing.

As long as it did not reach the level of rules, it did not pose any threat to him.

Let a puny little Heavenly Emperor escape to the top of the mountain?

How could this sort of thing be possible?

Daymeld knew that Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao attainments were merely just at the level of rank two source.

There was already no one who could reach the summit of the mountain in the human race currently!

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Alright, then you come up the mountain to kill me! I want to see until where you, this old dog, can chase me!”

The two people, one in front and one behind, bickered through the air, but their speed did not slow down in the slightest, akin to two streaks drawing an arc across the horizon.

While on the other side, the unpredictable army was also fleeing frantically.

It was just that the current unpredictable army was obviously much more mature.

Their retreat was orderly and did not show the least bit of panic.

However, without Ye Yuan controlling the grand array, the entire unpredictable army’s combat power dropped significantly, and casualties also started appearing.

After all, an army of 70 thousand people being obstructed and intercepted by an army of hundreds of millions, no matter how strong, it was also impossible to be completely unscathed.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan already led them to break through the heavy encirclement. They only had to retreat step by step will do.

But right at this time, the divine race used their trump card!

The Divine Children Legion!

Although the Divine Children Legion suffered heavy casualties, there were still 40 to 50 thousand people left after all.

Lumping these 40 to 50 thousand people together, they were still a team with extremely strong combat power.

The re-emergence of the Divine Children Legion suddenly delayed the unpredictable army’s speed of retreat.

However, it was also merely slowing it down.

When they crossed swords again, even if this army did not have Ye Yuan, their combat power was already completely different.

Under Wan Zhen and Pang Zhen’s lead, the unpredictable army fought as they retreated, but the Divine Children Legion’s casualties were continuously increasing.

The Divine Children Legion’s warriors were all extremely shocked.

They did not expect that after experiencing one battle, these unpredictable army’s soldiers would actually be formidable to such an extent.

However, they were under orders and desperately held the unpredictable army back.

The Divine Children Legion’s soldiers all seemed to not care for their lives, rushing towards the unpredictable army as if being suicidal.

The casualties of the unpredictable army were also rising sharply.

Wan Zhen’s brows furrowed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Continuing like this isn’t the way to go! I’m afraid that we’ll have already suffered heavy casualties before reaching Eight Void Mountain! Pang Zhen, you lead the main force away first, I’ll bring ten thousand-man squads to cover the rear!”

The moment Pang Zhen’s heart, his expression changed wildly and he said, “No way! Want to go, go together! Want to stay, stay together! Playing the hero like this, what kind of ability does it count as?”

After experiencing the baptism of the battlefield, the friendship of comrade-in-arms was already cultivated between Pang Zhen and Wan Zhen.

Wan Zhen was very magnanimous and furthermore, selfless, being deeply respected by the unpredictable army.

Even Pang Zhen was subdued by his bearing.

Wan Zhen said in a solemn voice, “Enough crap! At this rate, nobody can leave!”

Pang Zhen said furiously, “Want to cover the retreat, it should be me too!”

Wan Zhen said in a cold voice, “Rubbish! You have excess power and lack endurance! Rest assured, even if I fall into a heavy encirclement, I have the confidence to protect myself too! As long as they are lured into the range of the grand array, I’ll be safe!”

Pang Zhen knew that what Wan Zhen said was the truth, his combat power was extremely strong, but in terms of difficulty to deal with, it was still Wan Zhen who was more troublesome.

His expression changed over and over again. Finally, he gritted his teeth and said, “Good brother, you take care!”

Wan Zhen smiled and said, “Don’t say it like it’s a parting of life and death. I still want to receive Lord Saint Azure’s training and become a supremacy of my generation!”

After he was done talking, he said in a clear voice, “Which brothers are willing to cover the retreat with me!”

“Me!”

“Me!”

“Me!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

... ...

Those thousand-man squads’ squad leaders stepped out of the ranks one after another.

From the initial-most avoidance, it already reached the current taking the initiative to volunteer for battle.

Got to admit, the growth of these unpredictable children was tremendous!

Wan Zhen laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha, good brothers! Lin Xiao, Wu Cheng ... the ten of you, follow me to cover the retreat. The others, retreat first!”

Without a doubt, the ones who remained behind to cover the retreat would definitely suffer heavy casualties, and even be completely wiped out!

Even Wan Zhen, this Deva First Blight powerhouse, might not be able to come out alive.

But no one cowered!

“Kill!”

Wan Zhen did not retreat, but advanced instead, directly killing over towards the Divine Children Legion.

Only through madness could one achieve greatness!

With no retreat, these ten thousand people seemed to have gone crazy, fighting desperately.

Both sides fell into tragic hand-to-hand combats.

These ten thousand people were unrestrained. They were not fearing of death in the slightest, and they actually forcefully stopped the army!

But very soon, they were also surrounded by the countless divine race army, and they were engulfed inside.

When Pang Zhen saw this scene, tears instantly swirled in his eyes, and he roared sobbingly, “Everyone, listen up. Retreat!”

... ...

On the other side, Daymeld was in hot pursuit, the gap from Ye Yuan getting closer and closer.

It looked as if Ye Yuan was about to escape into Eight Void Mountain’s grand array.

But right then, Daymeld suddenly laughed loudly and said, “Brat, do you think that ... I’ll let you enter Eight Void Mountain? Lions go all out even when hunting a rabbit! Heavenly Dao True Martial, Shrinking Earth into an Inch, activate!”
