Chapter 2239: Even

The shrill scream shook until the entire cave was practically about to collapse.

The quantity of this bunch of Souleater Beasts’ salivas was sufficient for Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn to die ten times over!

He could dispel away the Souleater Beast saliva in the array formation, but in his current state, how could he dodge Ye Yuan’s Time Freeze?

His figure became fainter and fainter, finally dissipating without a trace amidst the miserable screams.

Ye Yuan received Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s ax and put away the Heavenly Emperor spirit treasure.

Although he did not use an ax, it was a Heavenly Emperor spirit treasure after all.

Each and every one of these Heavenly Emperors had ulterior motives too. The battle situation was so fierce, and yet Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn actually still held back.

While at this time, over at Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s side, the struggle came to an epilogue already as well.

A Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor, the tenacity of his life force was on a completely different level.

He got hit by the most, but he held out the longest!

All of the Empyreans’ gazes shifted along with Ye Yuan, and they could still hear the sounds of cold air being drawn from time to time.

This guy was too terrifying!

“Just now, that was ... Heavenly Dao True Word, right?”

“Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn didn’t die in vain! They all thought that they had already figured out Ye Yuan’s trump cards. But what Ye Yuan displayed before was merely just a portion of it!”

“With a wave of a hand, among the seven great Heavenly Emperors, five dead and two injured! T-Truly a terrifying fellow!”

... ...

These Ghost Dao Empyreans were also old monsters who had lived for no idea how many tens of thousands of years already. But their past experiences added up was also not as shocking as today.

Only today did they know that it turned out Heavenly Emperors could be so feeble too.

Ye Yuan’s footsteps moved, slowly walking over towards Heavenly Emperor Ninelives.

“Brat, this Heavenly wmperor won’t let you off!” Heavenly Emperor Ninelives looked at Ye Yuan hatefully and bellowed.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly, revealing a look of disdain. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The threat of someone who was about to die, would he take it to heart?

Rather, that Youluo Ghost Lantern, Ye Yuan paid quite a bit of attention to it.

“Release!”

Right at this time, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives finally gave up struggling, ending his life with his own weapon.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives, perished!

Everyone’s heart shook wildly. Although they had known the ending long ago, when this ending really occurred, they still felt like they did not dare to believe it.

After all, that was a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor!

Ye Yuan himself did not have much reaction to his suicide, grabbing straight at the Youluo Ghost Lantern.

But just as his hand was about to grab until the Youluo Ghost Lantern, warning bells rang!

At this time, a voice suddenly sounded out, “Brother Ye, careful! Heavenly Emperor Ninelives didn’t die!”

No time to think too much, Ye Yuan displayed spatial law to the extreme, directly vanishing on the spot.

Rumble!

The place where Ye Yuan was standing, a vacuum was directly blasted out in the blood light.

Only afterward did it slowly recover.

“Puhwark!”

Even if Ye Yuan’s reaction was extremely fast, he was still affected by this.

His gaze turned slightly dark, looking at the Youluo Ghost Lantern.

It was only to see a ghost slowly emerge from within. Who could it be if not Heavenly Emperor Ninelives?

He looked at Ye Yuan. A hint of killing intent was flashing across his eyes as he said in a solemn voice, “Turns out that this is your true strength. We were all hoodwinked by you!”

The spatial law that Ye Yuan displayed just now already reached peak rank six.

Even ordinary Heavenly Emperors would find it hard to compare too.

The certain-kill strike that he prepared for Ye Yuan was still evaded by Ye Yuan in the end.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives could not help regretting deeply!

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Emperor Ninelives, his gazes glimmering.

This guy actually rose from the dead!

But the Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor was significantly weaker than before, and already dropped to a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives did not make a move now. Clearly, he was extremely wary of Ye Yuan too.

The Souleater Beast’s saliva after being refined was too strong. If he were to be contaminated again, he would virtually not have much strength to fight back anymore.

“Heavenly Emperor Ninelives! Heh heh, I underestimated your name!” Ye Yuan said with a cold laugh.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives snorted coldly and said, “This Youluo Ghost Lantern can save eight soul parts, nourishing them inside! Each soul part is one life. This Heavenly Emperor naturally has nine lives! Otherwise, how do you think Heavenly Emperor Ninelives this title came about?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “So that’s how it is! I killed a life of yours, we’re considered even. If you provoke this Ye again, then this Ye don’t dare to guarantee how many lives you can still have remaining!”

This was a blatant threat!

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s gaze turned cold. Staying quiet for a moment, he suddenly turned his head to look at Wu Jiang.

“You know this Heavenly Emperor’s trump card?”

The one who warned earlier was none other than precisely Wu Jiang.

Wu Jiang’s expression was somewhat ugly and he said, “Back then, you and Heavenly Emperor Spiritbless, in order to fight for the Silvernet Blood Essence, perished together. This Wu just happened to be present! However, the result of that battle was that he perished, but you obtained the Silvernet Blood Essence, and broke through to become a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor!”

When everyone heard this, they could not help revealing a look of surprise.

Heavenly Emperor Spiritbless was also a peerless powerhouse who walked out of the Asura Blood Sea, but he died in the end.

They did not expect that he actually perished together with Heavenly Emperor Ninelives.

Youluo Ghost Lantern this heavenly emperor spirit treasure was truly a major killing tool!

Heavenly Emperor Spiritbless perished, but Heavenly Emperor Ninelives obtained the Silvernet Blood Essence. Because of it, he broked through to become a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

It was just a pity that this time, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives did not obtain any benefits. Not only did he lose a life, but his realm also fell too.

In the end, the Blood Lotus Flower was also acquired by Ye Yuan.

One could say that any gains could not make up for the losses!

Ye Yuan arrived in front of Wu Jiang with a flash and said, “Just now, many thanks for Brother Wu’s warning. This Ye owes you a favor.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan took out the Blood Lotus Flower. A sword light flashed past and actually directly split the Blood Lotus Flower into two.

He passed Wu Jiang half and said coolly, “This half portion of Blood Lotus Flower, just take it as returning your favor.”

All around, the Empyreans’ faces had surprise and also envy.

One sentence exchanged for half a Blood Lotus Flower. This was too effortless.

Wu Jiang did not take it and said with a bitter smile, “Actually, even without my reminder just now, Brother Ye would be fine too. This Blood Lotus Flower, I’m not worthy of it!”

It was not that he, Wu Jiang, was an upright gentleman, but actually he had witnessed Ye Yuan’s numerous means. His opinion of Ye Yuan was already not the same long ago.

In the very beginning, he only felt that Ye Yuan’s strength was not ordinary. That was why he wanted to form an alliance with him.

But along the way, Ye Yuan overcame all the difficulties with his strength alone. He was virtually undefeatable in Empyrean Realm!

Now, he even slaughtered five great Heavenly Emperors in a row!

This kind of battle achievement simply subverted his understanding.

Just now, he saw it plainly. When he was warning Ye Yuan, the latter already unconsciously displayed spatial law.

Hence, even without his warning, Ye Yuan would also be fine.

At most, the injuries would just be slightly worse.

Therefore, it was not that he did not want to take this half Blood Lotus Flower, but that he did not dare to take it.

Obtaining this half portion of Blood Lotus Flower, with his talent, he would have another 10% assurance of assaulting rank eight Empyrean!

Ye Yuan directly stuffed half of the Blood Lotus Flower into Wu Jiang’s hands and said coolly, “This Ye looks at the process, not look at the result. You deserve to take it!”

Along the way, Ye Yuan was still rather discontented with Wu Jiang.

After all, he and Wu Jiang formed an alliance, but Wu Jiang never took any action.

However, with that warning earlier, this half a Blood Lotus Flower was worth it!
