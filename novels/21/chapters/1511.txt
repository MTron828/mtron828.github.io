1515 Soft Persimmons Need to Have the Awareness of Soft Persimmons

“Purple Extreme Sect? What’s that?”

“Never heard of it before! Does the Heavenspan World have sects, this sort of thing?”

“These ancient ruins are so strange!”

...

The Heavenspan World did not have sect forces at all.

All of the forces were all under the control of cities, making clear distinctions.

Now, a Purple Extreme Sect suddenly appeared, surprising the group of geniuses greatly.

But that voice clearly did not care what everyone thought and continued on its own. “The ones occupying the 12 arenas are arena lords. The others each have one chance to challenge. The one who wins is the arena lord, the loser will be eliminated. Now, you all can freely pick your opponent. The 12 people remaining on the rings in the end will get the Purple Extreme Sect’s generous rewards.”

The moment the voice faded, a din immediately broke out in the hall.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Quite a number of martial artists reacted very quickly, all scrambling after one another, flying up toward Ye Yuan’s ring.

In a blink, 20 martial artists arrived on Ye Yuan’s ring.

Bang!

When the number of people on Ye Yuan’s ring reached 24, the martial artist at the back seemed to have directly hit a wall. He was ejected out far away.

“Ouch!”

Miserable screams echoed together.

Seeing this scene, the others could not help being secretly regretful and angry.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s arena was already full. It was already too late for others to want to go up.

Ye Yuan was clearly the only soft persimmon in the 12 arenas, the easiest to knead.

While the rest were at least all half-step Fiend Commander Realm.

Wanting to win would probably still have to expend some effort.

“Sigh, those tortoise grandsons really know how to take advantage of this! In this blink of an eye, they filled the ring!”

“Just this one soft persimmon, looks like it won’t be our turn to knead!”

“Looks like this arena is the best in standing out.”

“Mustn’t run into the Eminent Orchid Six Sons, otherwise ... dead for sure!”

...

Below the arenas were animated discussions. Clearly, they were quite unhappy with the current situation.

While at this time, the Eminent Orchid Six Sons also each chose a ring and slowly stepped up.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one shrunk back at the sight of it.

Among the people present, there were a total of eight Fiend Commander Realms.

These eight people had a tacit understanding, each choosing a ring.

Therefore, the other three arenas became very popular.

It was only to see figures swarming over toward those three rings one after another inside the hall.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The remaining people even came to blows in order to fight for these three rings.

For a moment, spiritual energy crisscrossed inside the hall, tremors intense.

Very soon, amidst a series of screams, those three rings were also filled.

The remainder people wailed all round.

These eight rings were without the least bit of suspense. It would definitely be those Fiend Commander powerhouses who win in the end!

Hence, some people started to be reluctant to go up the rings.

“ARGH!!”

Suddenly, a scream came over. A black horrifying flame suddenly burst out on the body of a half-step Fiend Commander genius martial artist.

In a blink of an eye, that person was burned into nothingness!

“It’s the blood essence contract activating! This ... We must go up the ring to fight!”

“This ... How to fight still? The Eminent Orchid Six Sons, we’re definitely not a match!”

“Forget it, isn’t it just a loss? Fight it out!”

...

Once these people shrink back, it would be equivalent to breaking the blood essence contract.

Once the blood essence contract had a backlash, their outcome would still be death.

Hence, everyone already had no way out and could only choose a corresponding ring.

After everyone had chosen, that old voice sounded out once again.

“Very soon, the arena competition adopts a one-versus-one format. The challengers challenge the arena lords in proper sequence according to the order of getting on the ring. The final victor will enter the next round of challenge! Now, the challenge begins.”

“Hahaha ... Everyone, this rookie, I, Bu Zhe, will accept first!”

The first martial artist who got on the ring laughed his head off. Clearly, he was very satisfied with him picking up a bargain.

When the others saw this scene, they could not help gnashing their teeth in hatred.

“This guy’s reaction is really fast. He picked up a huge bargain.”

“Humph! Being smug for what? It’s still uncertain who can laugh until the end!”

“Despicable person intoxicated by success!”

...

Facing the indignant voices of the rest, Bu Zhe did not care in the slightest. Looking at Ye Yuan, he said with a smile, “Master Source Night, is it? This place isn’t a pill refining room. Wonder why you ran here to join in the excitement. But since you came, it’s also giving this young master a big gift. Haha, this young master will kindly accept it.”

Ye Yuan looked at him like he was looking at a fool and said coolly, “Looks like you all treat me as a soft persimmon, everyone wants a squeeze, right?”

Bu Zhe laughed and said, “Isn’t that so? Soft persimmons need to have the awareness of soft persimmons.”

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly, and he said with a sneer, “What you said is very right, soft persimmons need to have the awareness of soft persimmons!”

“Hahaha, since you already have the awareness, then ...”

Bang!

Bu Zhe was just laughing wildly when he suddenly screamed, the laughter abruptly stopping, directly being ejected out of the ring.

“Already said that the challenge started, to actually still be in the mood to laugh,” Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh.

“Hahaha!”

A wave of loud guffaws came over. When the remaining 23 people saw this scene, they all laughed their heads off.

Getting on the ring and still so careless, served him right to directly be eliminated.

Bu Zhe crawled to his feet with a grunt, blushing until his entire face was red as he pointed at Ye Yuan and let loose a torrent of abuse. “Despicable villain, to actually sneak attack! If you have the ability, let’s have an open and aboveboard battle!”

Ye Yuan nonchalantly swept a glance over him and said, “Fool!”

“You! Who are you scolding a fool?!” Bu Zhe said furiously.

“Scolding you, a fool! Don’t even know this?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

“Hahaha!”

Another wave of roaring laughter.

Bu Zhe was angered until he was about to explode. He roared furiously and said, “Brat, I want to fight you again!”

Done talking, Bu Zhe’s figure moved, speeding over towards the ring.

Bang!

A streak of light flashed across. Bu Zhe was directly bounced flying out far away.

Clearly, the ring already did not give him the chance anymore.

“Next!” Ye Yuan said indifferently.

The second young genius who got on the ring looked at Ye Yuan with a sympathetic gaze and said mockingly, “I won’t ...”

Bang!

He wanted to say that he wouldn’t be like Bu Zhe, making this kind of low-level mistake! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But he was the same as Bu Zhe, directly flying out of the ring before saying finish his words.

Everyone’s gaze turned intent, finally discovering that something was not quite right.

This ‘soft persimmon’ seemed to be somewhat hard!

Ye Yuan’s attack earlier was inconceivably fast. They actually did not see clearly how Ye Yuan made his move.

Those two earlier losing were not because Ye Yuan making sneak attacks at all.

But that they could not react to the attacks at all!

Those able to come here were all geniuses among geniuses, all clever people.

One could still say to be a fluke. Two ... was definitely not a fluke anymore.

“Next!”

Right then, Ye Yuan’s voice was akin to a death-hastening talisman, sounded out in their ears.
