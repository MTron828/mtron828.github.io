1380 Mad Little Fatty.

Hearing it sounded very perfunctory, but what Ye Yuan said was the truth.

Teacher Fan naturally did not believe. It was just that when he entered the first level once more to investigate, he did not find anything either. Everything was normal.

Although it felt very inconceivable, this matter could only be concluded without a conclusion.

Ye Yuan carried on with his life. Resting for roughly ten days or so, Ye Yuan planned on entering the Sword Tomb once more after that.

When he just stepped out of the door, Ye Yuan suddenly discovered that the academy was bubbling with excitement. Everyone was running out of the academy.

“Heh, I really didn’t expect it. There’s actually still someone who dares to stroke the Qin Family’s whiskers in this Wu Meng Capital City. Is he tired of living?”

“Kidnapping Qin Peiyu that demoness, to think this guy can really think of that! How great an enmity does this punk have with the Qin Family? If he kidnapped, then kidnapped. But to actually still want to drag her to Wu Meng Plaza to hang up and bet. Isn’t it offending the Qin Family to the bitter end?”

“Oh, right, what’s that punk called? Seems to be this season’s newbie, right?”

“Mn, they say he’s called Xie Jingyi. A grown man actually has such a girly name, hahaha ...”

...

Ye Yuan’s footsteps abruptly stopped, his scalp tingling.

One year plus went by in a twinkle. Ye Yuan devoted his heart and soul into comprehending Sword Dao laws and virtually already forgot this name.

But now, this name entered his life once again, but it was in such a manner.

What the hell did this little fatty do?

Ye Yuan understood very quickly, he was doing it for him to see!

This guy ... wanted to express his true feelings to Ye Yuanthrough this matter, proving that he and Ye Yuan were standing on the same thread!

It was just that this way of doing things was a little too overboard, right?

Smacking the Qin Family’s face in front of everyone in the city, this was simply courting death!

This aggro point was absolutely maxed out! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan did not dare to dawdle. His figure could be seen speeding swiftly, heading outside the academy.

Along the way, Ye Yuan thought about a lot.

In this one year plus, Little Fatty probably did nothing at all and put all his energy into tracking Qin Peiyu.

With the Qin Family’s strength, after Ye Yuan slapped Qin Peiyu into a pig’s head last time, the Qin Family would definitely send an even stronger guard to protect her.

Little Fatty’s strength was not high. Wanting to kidnap Qin Peiyu under the Qin Family’s house guards’ eyelids, this difficulty could be imagined.

He did not expect that he actually succeeded!

Ye Yuan was somewhat self-reproaching at this time. Back then, he made wild conjectures. He did not expect that it pushed Little Fatty to such a perilous position.

Furthermore, after Little Fatty kidnapped Qin Peiyu, he did not take care of her in private but kidnapped her to the Wu Meng Plaza. This was having completely no leeway with the Qin Family anymore!

The reason why Little Fatty did this was probably afraid that Ye Yuan still could not set his mind at ease, thinking that he and the Qin Family were intentionally acting out a show for Ye Yuan to see.

Stirring the matter up so big was intentional on Little Fatty’s part.

It was to not save himself a path of retreat.

Ye Yuan really did not know what to say. Little Fatty had a profligate juvenile appearance all day long, but when doing things, he was as timid as a mouse.

Ye Yuan did not expect that he actually had such a staunch and moral side in his heart.

Ye Yuan’s figure was like lightning, speeding in the direction of the Wu Meng Plaza.

This matter caused a stir in the entire city. On the streets were all traffic flow heading in that direction.

In Ye Yuan’s impatience, he chose some small alleys to pass through.

Suddenly, a figure flashed out ahead, blocking Ye Yuan’s path.

“Ye Yuan, you didn’t expect it, right? I’ve already waited very long for this day! I even thought that you can hide in the academy all your life!” Jia Chong said with a cold smile.

He kept staring at Ye Yuan’s movements. When Ye Yuan went out of the academy, he immediately caught up.

Private fights were forbidden in Wu Meng Academy, prohibiting students from killing each other. But this rule was only limited to within the academy.

Leaving the academy, life and death were one’s own responsibility.

Ever since the entrance examination, Jia Chong’s days have been arduous.

The zero points him found it hard to take a single step in the academy.

Clearing challenges required expending points. But he did not even have one point.

Challenging others, others were not fools either and would not accept the challenge.

In this one year, Jia Chong virtually spent it in the midst of performing missions.

Doing missions needed time and energy. With his realm and strength, he could not accept any high difficulty missions at all.

Accumulating for a year’s time, Jia Chong finally amassed 60 to 70 points.

This one year plus could virtually be said to be wasted.

Looking at Su Yuecang, Xiang Zhuang, those people, all caught up from behind. He was really burning with anxiety.

All this was all thanks to Ye Yuan!

Hence, he had always been paying attention to Ye Yuan’s movements. Today, he finally got the chance.

Seeing Jia Chong, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said in a solemn voice, “If you don’t wish to seek death, scram!”

Jia Chong was tickled the moment he heard and said mockingly, “Your bit of strength also dare to be arrogant in front of me? Do you think that today is still taking the test? Right now, are you in a hurry to go and save that damn fatty? Heh heh, don’t need to go anymore. He dared to provoke the Qin Family, so he’s dead for sure! And you, Ye Yuan, the humiliation that you brought to me, I’m going to claim it back with interest today! You’ll likewise die without a doubt today! You and that damn fatty can have company on the road to hell!”

Ye Yuan was worried about Little Fatty and nervous with worry in the first place. Yet, this Jia Chong ran over to slam onto the spearhead.

He smiled coldly and said, “Fool! You don’t even understand your enemy and dare to run over to kill people? Since you’re seeking death yourself, then I don’t mind sending you off too!”

Jia Chong’s expression changed. Suddenly, a gust of Yin wind blew past. He had not drawn his sword yet, and his entire person was frozen.

Gui Yun’s figure appeared before his eyes. Jia Chong’s eyes stared at Gui Yun like wide-saucers.

Jia Chong never thought that a late-stage Two-star evil spirit actually followed by Ye Yuan’s side!

He suddenly felt that he was simply foolish to the extreme. It was really as Ye Yuan said, he did not even figure out how many trump cards his enemy had and came over to kill people without due consideration.

If this was not dumb, what was it then?

But right at this time, a terrifying aura descended from the sky!

Gui Yun’s expression changed, his figure retreating explosively.

Two figures flashed out and blocked in front of Jia Chong.

“Ye Yuan, he doesn’t know your ins and outs, but I know! So this time, I invited a helper over!”

The one talking was none other than precisely Ye Yuan’s sworn enemy Wang Song!

By his side, he even brought along a grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouse!

“You’re Ye Yuan? I’ve already prepared for a full year in order to wait for you! Today, I can finally complete the mission!” said that grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouse.

Ever since that time, Qin Nantian sent a grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouse for Wang Song’s dispatch.

The objective was naturally in order to finish off Ye Yuan!

With him dealing with Gui Yun, Ye Yuan was dead beyond a doubt!

When Jia Chong saw this, he could not resist laughing and said, “Hahaha, Ye Yuan, the people that you offended are really not few! You, this kind of person, even if I don’t kill you, you’re hard-pressed to escape the calamity too!”

Ye Yuan looked at Jia Chong as if looking at a fool and said with a cold sneer, “Fool! The people that I offended are quite a few, but my friends are not few either! Just the likes of a fool like you also wish to kill me?”

Ye Yuan suddenly shouted, “Come on out! Could it be that you’ll only come out after I’m killed by them?”
