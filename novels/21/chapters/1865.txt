Chapter 1869: Xu Xing’s Coercion

A Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse actually died in front of them just like this. This cast a shadow over the road ahead.

They finally knew that this true god mystic treasure was not easy to get.

Let alone clearing the level nine sword formation and obtaining the empyrean spirit treasure.

“Let me give it a try!”

At this time, Ji Kang suddenly stepped forward and walked toward the sword formation.

Among this group of people, Ji Kang’s strength should be the strongest. Everyone was very looking forward to it, wanting to see just which step he could walk to.

Upon entering the sword formation, Ji Kang’s strength immediately unfolded.

In the first three rounds, Fan Ming did not clear it easily, but Ji Kang cleared it naturally and smoothly.

Reaching the fourth round, everyone’s hearts became nervous.

But without any surprises, Ji Kang chose to continue challenging it.

Fourth round, Ji Kang’s pressure soared!

Everyone could feel that he was straining much more than before.

But he was an entire major realm higher than Fan Ming. His strength naturally could not be mentioned in the same breath.

It was everyone’s first time witnessing the fifth round. The powerhouses outside the sword formation all turned pale.

Too horrifying!

However, Ji Kang still made it through smoothly.

In the sixth round, after Ji Kang suffered a series of tempestuous sword lights, he still made it through.

When the transmission array appeared in front of Ji Kang again, he hesitated.

“You still have three breaths of time to consider! Three, two ...” That voice in the sword formation sounded out once more. Everyone’s hearts leaped to their throats.

Right at this time, Ji Kang moved!

He stepped into the transmission array without the slightest hesitation, vanishing.

“Even Lord Ji Kang don’t dare to challenge the seventh level too? Sure enough, an empyrean spirit treasure isn’t that easy to get!”

Those True God powerhouses had regretful faces. Even Ji Kang did not dare to challenge the seventh level. Them going to challenge it were most likely to die too. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Although empyrean spirit treasures were good, one also needed to have the life to take it!

Before long, Ji Kang’s figure appeared on the other side of the grand array.

Clearly, he obtained a true god mystic treasure at some place.

However, his face did not have any joy.

True god mystic treasures might be good stuff to others, but to him, it was merely something superfluous.

With two people taking the lead, these powerhouses started challenging one after another.

But, for Celestial Deity Realm martial artists, virtually no one dared to challenge the fourth round.

In reality, Celestial Deity Realm martial artists, people that were able to clear the first two rounds were very, very few.

Only to see one life after another snuff out inside the Heaven Killing Sword Formation.

True God powerhouses, someone challenged the fourth level too. But after five to six True God powerhouses died in a row, no one dared to continue challenging as well.

Ye Yuan quietly returned beside Leng Qiuling since no idea when as he said, “Looks like this round is very brutal!”

Ye Yuan saw that the number of martial artists was clearly much lesser than before, only then sighing emotionally.

Leng Qiuling nodded her head and said, “The power of this sword formation is very terrifying. Even Lord Ji Kang only cleared the sixth round too.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, having a rough understanding of the Heaven Killing Sword Formation’s power.

“A genius that holds even the Vermilion Bird true blood in contempt, this sword formation definitely can’t stump you. Why don’t you go up and try? You wouldn’t be ... scared, right? Hahaha ...”

Xu Xing had always been staring over here. The reason why he had not gone to challenge yet was to wait for Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan made him lose face time and again. He must win back some ground this time in the Heaven Killing Sword Formation.

“Young Master Xu, don’t make things difficult for people. A Third Firmament Celestial Deity going up is definitely death.”

“Lend him a few galls and he also doesn’t dare to go up, right?”

“Hey, boy, you even gave the Vermilion Bird true blood to Miss Leng. Don’t lose face in front of a beauty. Hurry up and go give it a shot.”

...

The moment Xu Xing opened his mouth, many young geniuses immediately started squeezing Ye Yuan.

In their eyes, Xu Xing and Leng Qiuling were people who genuinely had great destinies. In this mystic realm trip, their harvests were likely far more than this.

And Ye Yuan was utterly worthless in their eyes.

Said that he gave the Vermilion Bird true blood to Leng Qiuling, who saw it?

Said that he killed Zhuo Han with one sword, they did not believe at all.

A Third Firmament Celestial Deity was A Third Firmament Celestial Deity. If they did not see with their own eyes, no one would believe that Ye Yuan could really kill Zhuo Han.

Even if he killed, he definitely used despicable means too!

Toward these people’s contempt, Ye Yuan naturally would not pay attention. He just said coolly, “I say, can you be a bit more promising or not?”

Xu Xing’s expression turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “You’re saying that I’m a good-for-nothing?”

“You want me to be killed by the Heaven Killing Sword Formation and still have to use this kind of second-rate goading technique, what is it if not good-for-nothing? If you issue a challenge to me and compete in who clears the most rounds, I can view you in a better light,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Xu Xing’s face alternated between green and white. His paltry trick was seen through by Ye Yuan with one glance.

“Saying so much, aren’t you still gutless, not daring to enter the sword formation!” Xu Xing said with a cold smile.

This sword formation’s terrifying power already scared away quite a number of martial artists.

Those weaker Celestial Deity Realm martial artists were already not planning to continue advancing anymore. They did not have hopes of clearing the first three levels at all.

Hence, Xu Xing was certain that Ye Yuan’s bit of strength definitely did not dare to enter the sword formation.

Ye Yuan laughed when he heard that and said, “Since you want to play, then I’ll play with you. You go and challenge first. If the rounds I clear is less than yours, the mystic realm at the back, I won’t go anymore.”

“Ye Yuan, you mustn’t!” Leng Qiuling’s face changed and she urged.

She knew that Ye Yuan’s strength was powerful, but this sword formation, even Ji Kang did not dare to go and challenge the seventh level too. It was too terrifying.

Ye Yuan’s willful challenge would get him killed.

Xu Xing laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Alright then, I’ll go and challenge it first! At that time, don’t get scared until you wet your pants! Hahaha ...”

A wave of hooting also came from all around, very disapproving of Ye Yuan’s ‘willful’ provocation.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s laughable challenge, Xu Xing was overjoyed in his heart.

This time, he was finally going to make Ye Yuan lose all face in front of Leng Qiuling.

Xu Xing was not perfunctory either, leaping and entering inside the Heaven Killing Sword Formation.

Upon entering the sword formation, countless sword lights came head-on.

Xu Xing’s strength was formidable, lifting something heavy as if it were light, blocking it easily.

“Brother Xu’s strength is truly astonishing like a celestial’s!”

“His Sword Dao law fused with lightning and fire, two great laws. Now, he refined the White Tiger true blood too, his current strength is too terrifying.”

“The first three rounds shouldn’t have any suspense anymore. As long as he clears the third round, Ye Yuan will have to clear until the sixth round! Heh, that kid will likely really be scared until he wet his pants.”

...

The power of the Heaven Killing Sword Formation was set according to the martial artist’s overall strength, becoming stronger when encountering someone strong, becoming weaker when encountering someone weak.

Xu Xing’s comprehension of laws was indeed formidable. He cleared the first three rounds very quickly.

When the transmission array appeared, that voice sounded out once more.

“I choose to continue!” Xu Xing immediately said without the least bit of hesitation.

Exceeding everyone’s expectations, Xu Xing actually chose to continue challenging the formation!

The grand array that fell silent lit up once again.

The terrifying sword light suddenly leveled up, Xu Xing’s aura also skyrocketed along with it.
