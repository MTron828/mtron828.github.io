Chapter 2270: Heavenly Dao Incarnation

Ning Tianping placed Li Zhaoqing’s head beside the memorial tablet and knelt down.

“Master in heaven, your disciple Ning Tianping personally killed the enemy, and have finally avenged you! If your spirit is in heaven, you can rest in peace.”

After talking, Ning Tianping kowtowed three times solemnly.

For so many years, Mo Lifei treated Ning Tianping like a son. Ning Tianping’s feelings toward him, it was second only to his feelings toward Ye Yuan.

This time, the impact of Mo Lifei’s death was tremendous to Ning Tianping.

However, the Ye Yuan by the side, his eyes flashed.

He sensed that kind of fluctuation again!

This fluctuation was intangible and formless but was exactly the same as his father back then.

Ye Yuan’s heart stirred slightly, Mo Lifei’s soul had clearly already disintegrated. Right now, a hint of undulation was actually produced above his memorial tablet.

This undulation made him even more certain that the last time was not a hallucination.

But the others present were completely oblivious.

Ning Tianping finished kowtowing and kowtowed to Ye Yuan as he said, “Tianping thanks Your Excellency for granting my wish!”

Ye Yuan received it calmly and said, “I’ll naturally let you fulfill your filial piety. Alright, lie down. Your injuries are very severe and need around half a month before you can recover.”

Ning Tianping nodded his head and carefully put away Mo Lifei’s memorial tablet and lay down once more.

... ...

Half a month later, under Ye Yuan’s meticulous treatment, he finally recovered completely.

Then, Ye Yuan ransacked the Hidden Lineage’s medicinal stores under Ru Feng’s company.

Watching Ye Yuan push one stalk of incomparably precious spirit medicine after another into his storage ring, the muscles on Ru Feng’s face were twitching.

These spirit medicines, the Hidden Lineage had collected them for no idea how many years.

Many of them were even close to extinct.

“Boy, that’s enough! The spirit medicines that you’re currently taking have already virtually emptied out a Bodhidharma!” Ru Feng said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan turned to look at him, smiled broadly, and collected the whole stretch with a whoosh.

It turned out that he was just picking and collecting. Now, he directly collected in piles.

This was terrifying!

Ru Feng’s expression choked up and almost could not resist smacking Ye Yuan to death with one slap.

Ru Feng endured his anger and said, “C-Consider yourself ruthless!”

Finished scouring the spirit medicines, Ye Yuan arrived at the treasure vault to choose Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures.

Ye Yuan picked 13 swords in one go, leaving 12 for himself and gave one to Ning Tianping.

With 12 Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures added to the sword formation, the power of the sword formation would be even stronger.

This time, Ru Feng became wiser.

Even though his heart was still dripping blood, he endured all the way without speaking.

Otherwise, this punk might move the entire treasure vault away.

In addition, Ye Yuan even collected a large batch of divine essence stones.

Other people’s things, not taking would be wasted.

As for cultivation methods, martial techniques, and whatnot, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to look at all.

These things already did not have any meaning to him.

In the end, Ru Feng brought Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping and arrived at the Hidden Lineage’s sacred ground.

Entering the sacred ground, an incomparably sacred aura hit them head-on.

On an open field, eight enormous mountain-like stalwart statues of gods stood toweringly.

This holy aura emitted off of the divine statues. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

When Ning Tianping saw these eight divine statues, he actually knelt down involuntarily.

Ye Yuan pushed his palm out, a surge of aura suddenly fired out, supporting Ning Tianping up from under.

Ning Tianping felt ashamed and said, “Your Excellency, such ... such strong Heavenly Dao aura!”

But by the side, Ru Feng’s pupils constricted.

These eight divine statues were god-like existences.

Even if it was the divine race, the first time entering here to receive the baptism of gods, they would also be brought to their knees by the aura of Dao.

But Ye Yuan was not only completely fine, he even helped Ning Tianping overcome this psychology effortlessly.

This guy’s comprehension towards Dao already reached an extremely deep level!

Ru Feng thought so in his heart.

But he did not know that titanic waves similarly surged in Ye Yuan’s heart!

The aura on these gods’ bodies was actually extremely similar to the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!

Even though the aura of these gods were far less profound than the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan could be sure that it was the same kind of aura!

It was still Ye Yuan’s first time encountering something that possessed the same kind of aura as the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

What was the origin of these idols?

“These eight divine statues are the incarnations of Heavenly Dao! In the last epoch, they had once imparted Dao to the divine race’s eight progenitors! Later, the eight progenitors attained Dao. They took materials from the Heavenspan Mountain and carved the incarnations of Heavenly Dao! Each divine race member has to undergo the baptism of these eight divine status before they can become official divine race members! This is my divine race’s Dao. You can’t comprehend it!” Ru Feng said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan swept his gaze past and discovered that many divine race powerhouses were all comprehending Dao under the statues.

The divine race cultivated Heavenly Dao. It turns out that it came from this!

“Divine race’s eight progenitors, could Daymeld be one of them?” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Ru Feng’s expression changed, and he cried out in surprise, “You ... You’ve seen before Progenitor Daymeld?”

Sure enough!

Ye Yuan did not expect that this Daymeld’s background was actually so great.

He nodded his head and said, “That’s right, he was suppressed in Shinra Ghost Region’s Asura Blood Sea, and just broke through the barrier and came out not long ago!”

The moment Ru Feng heard, he could not help saying joyfully, “Hahaha ... the progenitor coming into being, our divine race’s revival is nigh at hand! Gratifying, celebratory! Such a joyous occasion, I have to quickly tell Head Elder!”

Ye Yuan’s expression was strange as he said, “What are you happy about? After he came into being, he was seriously wounded by a Dao artifact and also had an arm severed by me. Right now, he’s hiding at God knows where to recover his strength.”

“What? You ... You severed one of Progenitor Daymeld’s arms? That isn’t possible!” Ru Feng said in alarm and anger.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If he was at his prime, it’s naturally impossible. But if he’s in the same realm as me?”

Ru Feng’s expression turned stiff, his complexion ashen.

Yeah, this boy was too monstrous!

Invincible in the same realm was not said for fun!

Ancestor being suppressed for an epoch, his strength had long been pretty much worn down. After coming into being, he was also seriously injured by a Dao artifact. How much strength was there to still fight with Ye Yuan?

If Ye Yuan was an ordinary Empyrean Realm, even if Ancestor only had Empyrean Realm strength, he could casually knead him too.

Yet, Ye Yuan’s combat power was a hundred times more daunting than divine race members of the same realm!

Ancestor suffering a big loss did not seem hard to understand.

Ye Yuan looked at the eight idols, the corners of his mouth revealing a hint of amusement and he said smilingly, “Heavenly Dao incarnation, interesting! Wonder when I can witness a true Heavenly Dao incarnation! Tianping, you go and comprehend the eight statues. How much you can comprehend counts.”

Ru Feng smiled coldly and said, “The legacy of the eight divine statues, only humans whose souls and flesh fused into one can receive it. If he goes and comprehends them, he’ll be directly crushed by the statues’ Heavenly Dao pressure!”

Ning Tianping himself also felt the powerful pressure and said with a bitter smile, “Your Excellency, I’m afraid that I can’t!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Scared of what? I’ll protect you! This is what the divine race owes you. Since it’s given to you, grasp it well!”

When Ning Tianping heard that, he immediately mustered up the courage and said with a nod, “Yes, Your Excellency!”

Done talking, he walked over toward the divine statues with large strides.

Ning Tianping’s entire body trembled, seemingly sensing the eight divine statues coming to life, their gazes were all focused on him.

A terrifying Heavenly Dao aura suddenly descended!
