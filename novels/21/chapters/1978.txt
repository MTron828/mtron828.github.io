Chapter 1982: Falling into Heavy Encirclement

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Over there, Song Yu and Zuo Mo also stopped.

The reason why Zuo Mo chose to take action was that he was certain that Song Yu’s side was not a match for him. There was only him, a Fourth Firmament True God.

But who knew that Ye Yuan only used the Life and Death Seal and actually overpowered Feng Xiaotian.

This result seriously greatly exceeded his expectations.

Zuo Mo looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “This Empyrean’s remains was discovered by us first. We even lured away the bone devils from this place, but you all took forcible possession of it. Where’s the logic?”

Couldn’t beat, started to talk about reason!

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “You saw it and it’s yours? I saw you now, I want to take you as my slave, will you be or not?”

“Pffft!”

Everyone guffawed with laughter.

Zuo Mo was enraged until his expression was livid ,and he said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, don’t you be rampant! Could it be that you’re really planning on fighting it out to the bitter end?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Fighting it out to the bitter end? You also need to have the ability to do so first! If we really continue fighting, who lives and who dies is still not known! Moreover, you all are also aiming for that Qilin emperor bone, right? Don’t talk about having a life and death struggle. If you get injured in this Bone Devil Ridge, I want to see how you snatch that emperor bone.”

Zuo Mo and Feng Xiaotian’s expressions choked up, not expecting that Ye Yuan was actually also aiming for the emperor bone.

With this, it was troublesome.

At that time, a fierce struggle could not be avoided.

Ye Yuan looked at Zuo Mo two people and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Moreover, me keeping this Empyrean’s remains is also considered saving your lives. If not, you Zuo Mo ... probably wouldn’t be Zuo Mo anymore now.”

Zuo Mo thought that Ye Yuan was deliberately mocking him and said in a great rage, “Punk, don’t show off your cleverness after coming off cheap!”

But the Song Yu by the side sneered and said, “Who’s showing off after coming off cheap? Ye Yuan didn’t bluff you. This Empyrean’s remains is simply a hoax. That Empyrean powerhouse sealed a wisp of his remnant soul inside the remains. As long as you refine the remains, that Empyrean powerhouse will come out to seize possession! Heh, consider yourself lucky that you didn’t get the remains.”

Zuo Mo and Feng Xiaotian’s faces changed when they heard it. Clearly, they had not thought that there was still such a thing.

But very soon, Zuo Mo recovered and said with a cold smile, “Since that’s the case, why are you guys completely fine?”

Song Yu smiled and said, “How can Brother Ye’s means be what you can surmise?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Talk to them about these for what? Let’s go.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought Song Yu and the rest, and left straightaway.

Zuo Mo and Feng Xiaotian two people exchanged a glance, but they still did not make a move in the end.

Just as Ye Yuan said, the emperor bone was the end goal.

If they expended too much effort here, no one could obtain the emperor bone in the end. They might even endanger their lives.

...

The more one went into the depths of the Bone Devil Ridge, the more soul-stirring the undulations coming from the inner area that the person would experience.

Along the way, Ye Yuan’s party also encountered quite a number of powerful bone devils and even suffered the besieging of a group of bone devils. But under Ye Yuan and Song Yu’s powerful strength, the perils were turned into safety.

But they also discovered that the deeper in, the stronger the bone devils.

These bone devils were very hard to deal with. Their defensive power was extremely strong, being comparable to the sixth transformation golden body.

Once tangled by a group of bone devils, it would also be too much for a middle-stage True God Realm to bear.

Fortunately, the strengths of Ye Yuan, Song Yu, and the rest, were all at the top among those in the same rank. Along the way, there were more scares than dangers.

“Brother Ye, why do I feel like there seems to be something controlling these bone devils?” Song Yu suddenly said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Even the Empyrean’s remains were that troublesome, let alone the emperor bone. I feel that these bone devils might be controlled by the emperor bone.”

Song Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he said, “The bone devils that we’re encountering now are basically all First Firmament and Second Firmament True God Realm strength already. Advancing further, we’ll probably run into middle-stage True God Realm bone devils!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This is also something that can’t be helped. Middle-stage True God Realm bone devils will definitely be encountered. What I’m worried about now is whether or not there will be late-stage True God Realm, even Empyrean Realm bone devils. If that’s the case ... it will be troublesome!”

When everyone heard that, their expressions changed slightly.

If there were Empyrean Realm bone devils, they probably would not be able to even escape.

But this kind of thing, no one knew as well.

Circling around a patch of jagged strange rocks, the line of vision suddenly became widened.

The faces of Ye Yuan and the rest suddenly changed, being dumbstruck with shock by the scene before their eyes.

On the flat ground ahead, countless bones piled up together, and they actually piled into an enormous mountain.

At the top of the mountain, where one’s vision could reach, a thick and large golden bone displayed on it.

The aura emitting off of that bone made Ye Yuan’s heart palpitate too.

“This ... How many powerhouses’ skeletons pile up to form it?!” Song Yu’s expression changed slightly as he said.

Even if they were all powerhouses of a region, seeing this spectacular sight that made people’s hair stand on end, they still could not resist being somewhat shocked.

One had to now, those that died in the Ancient God Battlefield, the lowest was also Celestial Deity Realm martial artists.

Among these skeletons, no idea how many Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses and how many True God Realms powerhouses there were.

Or ... how many Empyrean powerhouses there were!

“You all wait here; I’ll go take a look.” Ye Yuan said.

Song Yu’s expression changed, and he said, “No way! It’s too dangerous for you to go over alone, let’s go together!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “No need. You all coordinate with me here. If there are any sudden turn of events, everybody must run immediately. Don’t hesitate.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan leaped and galloped at full speed toward that bone mountain.

This Ancient God Battlefield was a very peculiar place. Ye Yuan’s spatial shift could not be used at all.

Hence, he could only walk by feet.

His speed was extremely fast, arriving at just several tens of thousands of feet away from that bone mountain in a blink of an eye.

This distance was merely a matter of a twinkling of an eye to the Origin Pill Realm Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

The emperor bone at the top of the mountain gave off a faint golden light.

Then, a scene that made people’s countenance change occurred.

Countless skeletons crawled up from the ground, forming into a bone devil army in virtually a blink of an eye!

The strength was these bone devils were extremely formidable. The weakest also had peak Celestial Deity Realm strength. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Not good, this is a trap! That emperor bone was waiting for people to go over!” Song Yu’s face changed drastically as he turned pale with fright and said.

However, it was already too late.

Ye Yuan was currently in the center of this open field. Even if he wanted to run, he could not run at all.

In a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan was engulfed by the bone devil army.

This bone devil army was different from the battle spirit army previously. Their strength was more than ten times stronger.

Observing with a slight glance, Song Yu discovered that there were quite a few middle-stage True God Realm bone devils.

This line-up practically made people despair.

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect it! Really didn’t expect it! This brat actually served at the vanguard and fell into the bone devil army. I want to see whether this brat dies or not this time!”

Right at this time, a burst of loud laughter sounded out behind Song Yu. It was Zuo Mo and the rest who just happened to arrive.

Seeing Ye Yuan fall into the bone devil army by himself, he and Feng Xiaotian were simply delighted.
