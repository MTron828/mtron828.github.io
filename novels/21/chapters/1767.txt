Chapter 1771 Rushing Heavenly Tiger Mountain Alone

Blackpupil’s expression changed several times. Suddenly, his figure moved, suddenly vanishing, shuttling into the void.

Ye Yuan had long expected it. Taking a step high into the air, a finger tapped out once more.

It was only to see a trace of crack ripped in space. Blackpupil’s figure was directly sent out.

Blackpupil’s pupils constricted and he said in horror, “S-Spatial law!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Don’t need to worry, I won’t kill you. Take a trip with me.”

Blackpupil’s expression changed and he said fearfully, “W-Where are you bringing me?”

“Heavenly Tiger Mountain.”

Blackpupil had a look of alarm and said in panic, “I ... I’m not going! You ... You’re courting death! White Light already died, so what’s the point of doing this now?”

The current Ye Yuan had a calm look. But those who knew him well knew that he was very angry.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan unleashed a finger again.

“Ahh! You ... You crippled my cultivation! You’ll die a horrible death!”

A scream came from Blackpupil. That finger of Ye Yuan’s just now directly made his inner-world shatter.

The current Blackpupil was already an out-and-out cripple.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a grim look, “My brother’s life is tenacious, so he won’t die. If he really died, I’ll make the entire Heavenly Tiger Mountain be buried with him! As for you, there’s absolutely no hope to get lucky.”

Blackpupil’s entire body trembled, revealing a look of despair.

Suddenly, he let out a wild laugh and said, “Just the likes of you will make the entire Heavenly Tiger Mountain be buried for him? What right do you have?”

Ye Yuan slowly walked over, hauling Blackpupil up. Taking a stride out, he directly left Tiger Bright Imperial City.

“You sent a message out with a secret art just now, right? Don’t harbor delusions anymore, no one will come and save you,” As Ye Yuan sped along, he said coolly.

Blackpupil’s expression changed and he said in disbelief, “You want to scare me? My grandfather is Tiger Bright Imperial City’s grand elder, late-stage rank five powerhouse! You crippled my cultivation, he’ll definitely shred you into pieces.”

Ye Yuan cast him a pitiful glance and said coolly, “Then you see if anyone will come and save you or not.”

Time slowly trickled by, the two people got closer and closer to Heavenly Tiger Mountain.

However, there were still no activities at the rear.

Blackpupil’s heart gradually sunk to the bottom.

He seriously could not understand why Grandfather would not come and save him.

And where Ye Yuan’s confidence came from.

Thinking about Ye Yuan arriving at the border of Skydemon Mountain Range, Blackpupil finally knew that Ye Yuan was not scaring him, but he really had the confidence!

But why?

He was merely a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord martial artist, so why would Grandfather not dare to come?

“Why? WHY!” Blackpupil bellowed unwillingly.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Didn’t you say that with my strength, there isn’t any problem passing ‘Ask Not’?”

Blackpupil’s pupils constricted and he said in disbelief, “You ... You really passed ‘Ask Not’? This isn’t possible! If you passed ‘Ask Not,’ why doesn’t the entire demon race have any news at all?”

Ye Yuan said, “That’s because I’m different from those people in the past!”

Blackpupil’s entire body trembled. His mind was in disorder.

He previously said these words just to butter Ye Yuan up.

No one had cleared ‘Ask Not’ for eight million years already. Although Ye Yuan was very formidable, he did not believe that Ye Yuan had the ability to clear it at all.

But now, even his grandfather did not dare to chase after. Very clearly, a powerful force stopped him.

At least, City Lord His Excellency did not have this ability and strength!

Then ... it was really Lord Sacred Ancestor?

Extreme terror after long deliberation!

The deeper Blackpupil thought, the more despaired he got.

...

“This one is Ye Yuan, requesting an audience with Heavenly Tiger King!”

Ye Yuan stood in the air and said in a clear voice, his voice ringing throughout the whole Heavenly Tiger Mountain.

Blackpupil was scared until his legs were quaking. This guy’s nerves were really too plucky.

Suddenly, several powerful auras stepped into the air and pounced over toward Ye Yuan two people.

Seven to eight fierce beasts with powerful auras directly took action indiscriminately.

Blackpupil was scared until his complexion turned ashen. These seven to eight fierce beasts, each one was several times stronger than him. Now, Ye Yuan and he were both dead for sure.

This guy’s head really had a problem, to actually dare so be insolent in Heavenly Tiger King’s territory. What was this if not tired of living?

Ye Yuan’s face fell, his figure immediately became vague and insubstantial, directly rushing into the beast horde.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Blackpupil only felt the divine essence around him disperse frenziedly.

Even though Ye Yuan battled seven to eight late-stage rank four fierce beasts by himself, he actually did not fall into a disadvantage in the slightest.

Was this guy a freak?

His combat power was actually so strong!

Just what kind of monster was White Light’s brother!

Suddenly, a surge of remorse welled up frantically in his heart. He discovered that he had done an extremely foolish thing, and provoked the person that he least ought to!

“Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven!”

“Nirvana Seal!”

One powerful move after another spewed forth. Ye Yuan sent each one of those fierce beasts packing back into the Heavenly Tiger Mountain.

Ye Yuan stood in his air and called out in a clear voice once more, “I’m Ye Yuan, requesting an audience with Heavenly Tiger King!”

With this, no more fierce beasts rushed out.

Before long, a black tiger rose into the sky.

A powerful aura instantly enveloped Ye Yuan and Blackpupil.

“Punk, who are you? To dare act wildly at my Heavenly Tiger Mountain?” said the black tiger in human language.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I want to meet Heavenly Tiger King!”

The black tiger gave a cold laugh when he heard that and said disdainfully, “Brat, your strength is decent. But why would Lord Heavenly Tiger King want to see you?”

Ye Yuan said, “I can treat Tigerheart!”

But the black tiger burst into laughter when he heard that and said, “Tiger Bright Imperial City even sent over a Five-star priest, but he was at a loss on what to do. Just the likes of you, a little brat still wet behind his ears, can treat Tigerheart’s injuries?”

The terms of Heavenly Tiger King’s retreat was naturally not just handing over White Light. There was also having the Priest Temple send people over to treat his son, Tigerheart.

In the end, Tigerheart’s injuries were too severe, even the Priest Temple could not treat him.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “They are inferior to me! Treat the dead horse as if it’s still alive; either way, you guys don’t have other choices.”

The moment the black tiger heard, he said in great rage, “Brat, what are you saying?”

Angry was angry, but the black tiger did not make a move.

Because he knew that Ye Yuan’s words were harsh, but the logic was not wrong.

This brat suddenly appeared and even dared to say such big words. He likely did not say it carelessly.

Who would have nothing to do and treat their own life as a joke?

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not react, the black tiger said unhappily, “Since you came to treat Tigerheart, then what are you still waiting for? Come with me!”

But Ye Yuan did not move and said coolly, “I want to meet Heavenly Tiger King! Otherwise, I won’t treat him.”

The moment the black tiger heart, he immediately said in a great rage, “Brat, since you already came, it’s no longer up to you now.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan said with a calm look, “You can try! I can treat Tigerheart; similarly, I can also make him unable to pray for life, nor beg for death! If you don’t believe it, you can give it a try.”

The black tiger’s face fell and he said angrily, “Brat, you dare?!”

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not react, the black tiger immediately crumbled and gave a cold snort and said, “Kid, you wait here. I’ll go and ask for Lord Heavenly Tiger King’s opinion!”
