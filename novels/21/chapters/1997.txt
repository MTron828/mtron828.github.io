Chapter 2001: Conclusion

“She ... She actually comprehended five types of power of law by herself, how is this possible?”

“All five elements! She comprehended all five elements! This comprehension ability is ... too terrifying!”

“The five elements mutually promote and restraint each other. If utilized properly, the power could rival supreme laws! This woman is remarkable!”

...

In the city, a series of exclamations came over.

They were never able to imagine that there was actually someone in this world who could comprehend five types of powers of law at the same time.

This kind of talent already exceeded their imagination.

Ye Yuan comprehended spatial law. This was indeed an extremely difficult thing. But comprehending the five elements at the same time, the difficulty was not the least bit weaker than spatial law.

Furthermore, these five kinds of laws were all comprehended to the level of rank six. This was simply inconceivable.

Even when Ye Yuan saw this scene, his pupils constricted too, his expression changing slightly.

He finally knew why even Bai Tong was defeated at her hands.

Lu Ziyi looked at Ye Yuan and said coldly, “Now, do you know what my reliance is? I admit that your talent is indeed pretty good, to actually be able to attain the perfect sixth transformation golden body. But all this is nothing in front of me!”

This woman was confident to the extreme and also powerful to the extreme. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Yuan was indeed somewhat surprised in his heart. When he entered the Ancient God Battlefield this time, people he saw were all extremely talented geniuses.

Just take Zhou Yu for example, he was absolutely a first-rate powerhouse among peers.

But Zhou Yu compared to this woman in front of him, the disparity was too great.

Ye Yuan reined in his thoughts and looked at Lu Ziyi and said calmly, “It’s just too bad that you seem to be unable to fuse the five elements law.”

When Lu Ziyi heard that, her expression could not help choking.

This had always been her sore spot. She did not expect that it was exposed by Ye Yuan heartlessly.

Comprehending all five elements and fusing five laws were two entirely different concepts. The strength difference was also worlds apart.

However, fusing two types of laws was already something incredibly hard, let alone fusing five types of laws?

This kind of thing, just thinking about it felt horrifying.

Her face turned cold and she said, “Shamelessly boasting! Talk wildly again after you block my laws of five elements!”

Ye Yuan shook his head. Suddenly, his gaze turned cold and he said, “It’s not blocking your laws. I said it before, all three of you have to die today! This is the price of you killing Jiang Ming.”

Lu Ziyi sneered and said, “With just the likes of you?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head. “With the likes of me!”

As he spoke, Ye Yuan slowly pulled out the bone sword. It was precisely that empyrean spirit treasure that Empyrean Vast Universe gave to him!

Lu Ziyi’s pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

This guy actually had two empyrean spirit treasures on him!

A defensive-type empyrean spirit treasure, an offensive-type empyrean spirit treasure!

This ... How could a puny little Southridge Ten Cities give birth to such a monster?

Hang on, didn’t this guy have a perfect sixth transformation golden body? Why was he using a sword?

Could it be that ... he was a martial-body dual cultivator?

That instant when she saw the bone sword, Lu Ziyi finally had a visible change in countenance.

A series of doubts were raised in her mind.

Today, the shock that this Southridge Ten Cities’ patrolling inspector, who was viewed by her as a barbarian, brought to her was seriously too much.

Lu Ziyi recollected her thoughts very quickly. Her confidence in herself was irreplaceable. “I really underestimated you. However ... it’s no use! My Five Elements Sword Art has no weakness to exploit.”

“Is that so?”

Ye Yuan smiled disdainfully, holding the bone sword and dashing over, and then his figure turned illusory.

Lu Ziyi’s pupils constricted again, clearly getting a shock.

Spatial law!

Furthermore, it was fifth level spatial law!!

This kid was not only extremely powerful in body-refinement, but his attainment in laws was actually also so terrifying.

However, there was already no time for her to be surprised.

This sword of Ye Yuan had a momentum akin to an overwhelming force. Lu Ziyi did not dare to be neglectful.

It was only to see her long sword swing, three types of power of laws immediately went to welcome him.

Bang!

Ye Yuan’s fused sword intent clashed with Lu Ziyi’s law of earth straight away.

The law of earth contained the power of the earth. Its defense was the scariest.

But, under Ye Yuan’s sword, the law of earth could not stand up to the single blow at all, practically disintegrating in an instant.

However, what was scariest about the five elements was not the power of each type of law.

Five types of power of laws mutually promoted and restrained each other. As long as the utilization was appropriate, it would be able to unleash more than several times, even dozens of times the power of the law itself.

At this time, the law of wood and law of earth mutually complemented each other, coupled with the ceaselessness of the law of water, it actually made this sword of Ye Yuan’s sink into the quagmire.

Ye Yuan’s sword move that pressed forward with indomitable will was easily resolved by Lu Ziyi just like that.

It was quicker than words could tell.

Talking about this sword move was very long, actually, it was just a matter of an instant.

However, Ye Yuan swung his sword in a circle, his figure swaying, attacking with another slash.

Horrifying power of laws rolled in midair. The martial artists in the city had long retreated to an extreme far place. How could they dare to approach in the slightest?

The showdown between two great True God Realm powerhouses, spectators would die upon contact!

Ye Yuan slashed consecutively, but no matter how his sword moves changed, he was unable to breach Lu Ziyi’s laws of five elements.

Lu Ziyi was clearly incomparably familiar with the utilization of the five elements law.

Five types of laws alternated indeterminately, continuing in an endless cycle, not giving Ye Yuan any chance at all.

However, Lu Ziyi was constantly being suppressed by Ye Yuan and also did not have the strength leftover to retaliate at all, and could only defend passively.

Two mighty powerhouses fought until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open in the sky of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. The horrifying energy undulations made people extremely terrified.

“I didn’t expect that you actually fused Sword Dao law and spatial law, being truly out of my expectations. However, it’s useless. My five elements law won’t give you any chance,” Lu Ziyi appeared very calm as she said.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan pulled back his sword momentum, leaving the battlefield.

Lu Ziyi looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “What? Gave up is it? Now, it’s my turn!”

Ye Yuan looked at Lu Ziyi and said coolly, “No need! You won’t have the chance to make your move. Your five elements are merely thus. Next, you can go and die already!”

Lu Ziyi had a proud look on her face as she said with a cold smile, “Foolish thing, still haven’t figured out your own strength until now? I’ve already grasped your strength clearly. Eat a sword move from me!”

Finished talking, Lu Ziyi stabbed a sword move out. The five elements were continuously reproduced in an endless succession under her sword, the energy getting more and more terrifying.

Ye Yuan just looked at this scene calmly, he was storing up strength.

A feeling of the heart and mind being linked together came from the bone sword.

This bone sword was indeed exceptional. To the current Ye Yuan, it was all too suitable.

Except, the current Ye Yuan, the aura on his body was very feeble and was not as outrageous as Lu Ziyi’s.

Suddenly, he abruptly snapped open his eyes. A sword stabbed out flatly.

“Sword Hollow Etch!”

Even though it was Sword Hollow Etch, this sword actually had some similarities with Empyrean Vast Universe’s third sword.

It was just that Ye Yuan could not achieve fully retracting the sword momentum.

The more horrifying the sword move was, the harder to control it.

Ye Yuan’s Sword Hollow Etch move, the power was too great.

Just like this, Ye Yuan’s seemingly ordinary Sword Hollow Etch move whirled away toward the Five Elements Sword Art.
