Chapter 1667 Leng Qiuling

“This is the Heavenspan Mountain?”

Ye Yuan looked at that enormous mountain that towered into the clouds in the distance, feeling like his entire divine soul left his body.

Everyone said that seeing once was better than hearing it a hundred times. The name of the Heavenspan Mountain could be said to be resounding like the roar of thunder.

Before this, Ye Yuan had imagined the appearance of the Heavenspan Mountain countless times before.

But seeing it now, he was still shaken to the core.

Everyone said that the Heavenspan Mountain contained all of the Heavenspan World’s Dao. It was indeed not false!

That mountain was clearly in the distance, but Ye Yuan actually could not see it clearly. It was as if there was a cloud of mist obstructing the eyes, unfathomable.

He suddenly felt like he was treading on air, the feeling of corroborating Great Dao, his entire person drifting over to the mountain.

“Ye Yuan! Don’t look anymore!”

Ye Yuan was currently spellbound when a thunderous voice suddenly sounded in his ear, startling him awake.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, cold sweat instantly drenching his clothes.

“W-What’s going on?” Ye Yuan said with lingering fear.

“You save that kid first, his divine soul is almost separating from his body!” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan was startled inwardly. Turning his head to look, he discovered that Ning Tianping’s divine soul was already almost floating out of his body.

“Tianping! Come back!”

Ye Yuan shouted sharply, Ning Tianping’s divine soul suddenly returned to position.

“Y-Your Excellency, what’s with me?” Ning Tianping said.

Dustless said, “You guys are lacking in power and lost yourselves in front of Great Dao! Rashly viewing the mountain will cause the divine soul to leave the body, be swept into the vortex of Great Dao, and be ground to dust!”

Ye Yuan was secretly shocked and relayed it to Ning Tianping. The two people felt lingering fear.

Indeed well-deserving of being the Heavenspan Mountain, one glance and it could seize people’s souls. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Mo Lifei also said, “Sigh, you brat, I haven’t had time to say and your divine soul already left your body!”

He did not have Dustless’s divine soul shocking means. Repeatedly shouting and yelling earlier, Ning Tianping did not hear it at all.

Ning Tianping sucked in a deep breath and said, “The Heavenspan Mountain indeed lives up to its reputation. Saying that it gave birth to the entire Heavenspan World is indeed not fake!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, as if a bolt of lightning flashed across in his mind. He seemed to have grasped something!

However, it also seemed like he grasped nothing.

This inspiration fleeted past in a flash, swift until he did not capture it at all.

That kind of feeling was like ten thousand ants gnawing on his little heart, abnormally itchy and hard to endure.

“Ye Yuan, what’s wrong with you?” Ning Tianping discovered Ye Yuan’s peculiarity and could not resist asking.

“Little punk, shut up! He seemed to have comprehended something, so don’t disturb him,” Mo Lifei said.

Ning Tianping was uncertain what it meant, but also hurriedly shut his mouth.

Ye Yuan frowned and pondered hard, but just could not grasp that fleeting flash of inspiration.

Finally, Ye Yuan still let out a long sigh.

“Kid, did you comprehend something?” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile, “I seemed to have touched that layer of windowpane paper, just a little bit more. But I’m just unable to poke through.”

Dustless’ eyes lit up and he said, “No need to rush. Looks like this trip was really right! When you reach the Heavenspan Mountain, perhaps all of your doubts will be resolved completely.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, thoroughly convinced of this too.

“Your Excellency, are you still alright?”

Ning Tianping saw through Ye Yuan’s out-of-sorts. Clearly, his sudden epiphany failed.

Ye Yuan already adjusted his state of mind, patted Ning Tianping’s shoulder, and said with a smile, “If I can break through to the Divine Lord Realm, you’ll be noted as having rendered the first meritorious service!”

Ning Tianping’s gaze turned intent and he said in pleasant surprise, “Your Excellency, did you ... finally found the opportunity to break through just now?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said with a smile, “Although it was just a brief instant, there are finally some ideas.”

Ning Tianping laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha, when Your Excellency breaks through to the Divine Lord Realm, go back and let that bunch of fellows all shut up!”

He knew how much Ye Yuan suffered in these few hundred years, and also admired the might of Ye Yuan’s mind at the same time.

If it were an ordinary genius, they would probably have long abandoned themselves to despair.

At this time, a group of Divine Lord Realm sped over from the distance.

In the group, a youth in a white shirt said with a disdainful look, “Eh, Senior Apprentice Sister, there’s actually still an Origin Deity Realm who wants to go to the Heavenspan Mountain! Truly overestimating his own ability!”

The person in the lead was a very beautiful girl.

That girl’s white dress fluttered, her ethereal aura coiled around gracefully, akin to an otherworldly fairy maiden.

It was just that the aura radiating off her body kept people a thousand miles away, very cold and detached.

The woman gave Ye Yuan a glance and said with slightly furrowed brows, “The Heavenspan Mountain is a forbidden place for those under Divine Lord Realm, aren’t you aware? This kind of place isn’t for you.”

Ye Yuan sized the girl up, also slightly surprised in his heart.

This girl’s age was similar to his and she was actually a ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse already.

This talent, placed in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would simply one-shot everyone!

Even Ning Tianping, this self-boasted genius also had a feeling of being ashamed of his unworthiness when seeing this cold and beautiful woman.

The disparity was too great!

After experiencing the initial-most shock, Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said with a smile, “Many thanks for the reminder, however ... this Ye naturally has a reason to insist on going.”

Although what this girl said was not pleasant to the ear, Ye Yuan could still make it out anyway.

This girl was just reminding out of goodwill and did not have the intention of mocking.

Rather, that young man had a look of disdain.

But this group of people’s strength was indeed powerful.

They were all young, but each person’s strength was even stronger than Ning Tianping.

One had to know, Ning Tianping was already more than a thousand years old.

In terms of talent, the gap between both parties was too great.

“Heh, what reason is there to insist on going? Merely that you’re unable to break through and want to come to the Heavenspan Mountain to try your luck. Over 500 years of bone age and unable to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, your talent is too poor! There are no idea how many country bumpkins like you come here every year. They were all crushed into minced meat by the Heavenspan Mountain. If you’re willing to seek death yourself, we naturally can’t stop it either,” said te white-shirt guy.

The moment Ning Tianping heard, he flared up and said angrily, “What the hell do you know?! If not because of some reason, His Excellency would have broken through to the Divine Lord Realm as far back as 300 years ago!”

It was still good if he did not explain, the moment he explained, the white-shirt man was even more contemptuous as he said, “Turns out that already stuck at grand completion Origin Deity Realm for 300 years! 300 years and can’t even break through to the Divine Lord Realm, still take yourself to be a genius? Heh heh, truly a frog at the bottom of a well! See our Senior Apprentice Sister Qiuling? She already broke through to the Divine Lord Realm at the age of 100. Presently, 400 years have gone by and she’s already ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord! Coming to the Heavenspan Mountain this time, she plans on breaking through to Celestial Deity Realm in one stroke. You know how great ... the disparity is already, right?”

Ning Tianping could not help choking when he heard this. He actually could not find the words to refute the other party.

This kind of genius was what he had to look up to all his life.

In just 400 years, she cultivated from being a first-layered heaven Divine Lord to a ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord. This kind of cultivation speed was simply horrifying.

The white-clothed girl frowned and said, “Bai Qing!”

The white-shirt man saw Leng Qiuling get angry and immediately shut up.

Leng Qiuling looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “That’s all I have to say, goodbye!”

Finished talking, Leng Qiuling brought along the group of junior brothers and sisters, and they headed for the Heavenspan Mountain.

“His Excellency, they are also too arrogant!” Ning Tianping said indignantly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “They had good intentions too, so just let them be.”
