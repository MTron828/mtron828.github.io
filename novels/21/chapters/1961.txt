Chapter 1965: Liu Yi

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The eyes of Jian Hao’s family’s son were cured!

This matter spread throughout Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital very quickly like a gust of wind.

Those major family clans all went into action without delay, all wanting to inquire about who treated Jian Yun’s eyes.

At Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, there was actually someone capable of refining the Six Vein Stellar Pill!

To the Jian Family’s members, this Six Vein Stellar Pill was simply a second life.

Among the Jian Family members in this city, how many people had suffered Heavenly Dao backlash before?

Even some powerful people more or less suffered before some hidden injuries too, being unable to eliminate it once and for all up till today.

But Jian Hao’s family kept a tight lid on their mouths. No one knew how on earth this master was.

Right at this time, a piece of news spread like wildfire.

It turned out that the one who refined this Six Vein Stellar Pill was none other than actually that young man who came to the great imperial capital together with Elder Jian Hongxiao!

One stone stirred up a thousand ripples.

The Jian family members in the city were all incomparably amazed. Their first reaction was that they did not believe it.

A ridiculously young youth who just entered True God Realm, how could he possibly be the master who refined the Six Vein Stellar Pill?

But thinking carefully, this credibility was really very high!

Hence, there began to have people who harbored the mentality to give it a try and went to Jian Hongxiao’s elder manor.

In the end, each one returned fully loaded!

Those Jian Family members with chronic ailments actually all recovered under Ye Yuan’s miracle hands!

With this, it thoroughly blew up.

The people who came to the elder’s manor every day were practically trampling the doorway flat.

For some time, Jian Hongxiao became the most in-demand elder in this city.

Even Master Bu Chen also personally paid a visit to call on Master Ye’s counsel.

Just like that, Ye Yuan cultivated as he treated the Jian Family members’ Heavenly Dao backlash. More than ten years’ time passed.

On this day, Jian Hongxiao went to find Ye Yuan.

Upon seeing Jian Hongxiao, Ye Yuan’s eyes could not help lighting up as he said with a smile, “Congratulations to Brother Hongxiao. It seems like Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital will be adding another Empyrean powerhouse not long after.”

The current Jian Hongxiao had a full forehead1. The aura of Dao on his body was becoming thicker and thicker. This was clearly the sign of breaking through soon.

From a True God to an Empyrean, how many heroes had this step stumped?

Just take this Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital for example. Just the Ninth Firmament True God powerhouses that Ye Yuan knew about were 20 to 30 people.

Those below Ninth Firmament True God were even more.

But so many True God powerhouses, those able to break through to the Empyrean Realm were only Jian Sutao and Jian Suyan two people.

This was also because the Jian Family’s cultivation method was powerful. If it were other places, this chance would be even lower.

Hence, for Jian Hongxiao to be able to take this step, no idea how many True God powerhouses were incredibly envious of him.

Jian Hongxiao was all smiles as he said, “Heh, without you, this old man also couldn’t possibly have taken this step in this lifetime. Empyrean ... Even people who possess imperial aura also don’t dare to say that they can definitely break through to the Empyrean Realm. For this old man to be able to have this today, it’s being tainted by your immortal qi!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Hongxiao’s talent is extremely good in the first place. Back then, if not for suffering Heavenly Dao backlash, with the accumulation of these 100 thousand years, you’d probably have walked to this step as well.”

Jian Hongxiao shook his head and said, “There are no ifs in this world. Everything has its destiny. That tribulation back then was Fengqi’s tribulation. Similarly, this was my tribulation. If not for encountering you, it’s impossible for my destiny to change.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Finding me for something?”

“Lord Sutao made me come find you. He told me to have you go to Virtuous Wind Establishment. The Ancient God Battlefield is about to open. The other children of destiny have already arrived in succession,” Jian Hongxiao said.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Brother Hongxiao’s father-in-law’s people manipulating art is truly impressive. Disregarding using you to blackmail me into entering the Ancient God Battlefield, he even deliberately let out the news, making me treat the Jian Family’s people. Tsk tsk, truly exhausting every power of his mind.”

Jian Hongxiao blushed with shame. He knew that he caused trouble for Ye Yuan.

If not for him, Ye Yuan would not have provoked so much trouble, and even had to put his life on the line to enter the Ancient God Battlefield.

...

Inside the Virtuous Wind Establishment, all the people of fame arrived.

The moment Ye Yuan entered the hall, he immediately attracted a series of sidelong glances. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A young man sitting on the left-hand side sized him up for a while and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “I was wondering who had such airs, to actually be the last one to come. It turns out that it’s just a rookie who just entered True God Realm.”

“Hahaha!”

Everyone guffawed with laughter.

Ye Yuan discovered that ever since he broke through to the Origin Pill Realm, his cultivation speed suddenly slowed down a lot.

It was not that his talent could not keep up anymore, but it was due to the spiritual energy required being too horrifying.

In these ten years, Ye Yuan swallowed quite a number of medicinal pills but did not break through much in terms of cultivation realm. He was still at the initial-stage First Firmament Origin Pill Realm.

Of course, this was just relatively speaking of him. When ordinary people cultivated for ten years, they would probably also just barely consolidate their realm.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with them. He found a corner and sat down.

Sweeping a glance, Ye Yuan discovered that there were a total of nine people in this hall including him.

That young man sitting on the left-hand seat was the strongest. He actually already reached the initial-stage Third Firmament True God Realm.

The others were all just at the Second Firmament True God Realm and late-stage First Firmament True God Realm.

While he was the weakest among these people, being only at the middle-stage First Firmament Origin Pill.

Reaching True God Realm, even if it was just the difference between initial-stage First Firmament True God and middle-stage First Firmament True God, the strength difference was huge.

Hence, that young man’s nose was almost pointing to the sky already.

It was only to see him slowly standing up, and then he said to everyone, “This humble self is Song Yu, from the Shiyuan Great Imperial Capital. Elder Suyan personally used the aura viewing art on me before; I’m at the peak imperial aura. Entering the Ancient God Battlefield this time, as long as I obtain a huge lucky chance, I believe that stepping into emperor surmounting aura shouldn’t be anything difficult.”

When everyone heard that, each and every one of them was slightly surprised in their hearts.

Jian Suyan was the Stellar Hall’s head elder, being the only Empyrean Realm powerhouse.

With him personally using the aura viewing art, this was a great glory.

Seeing the changes on everyone’s faces, Song Yu had a smug look. He said smilingly, “We’re all from Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital. Entering the Ancient God Battlefield, we should naturally support one another. Why don’t everybody do a self-introduction first, talk about your destiny.”

The moment Song Yu came up, he suppressed everyone. At this time, no one objected.

On his right side, a young man opened his mouth and said, “I’m called Guo Jingyang, from Redleaf Great Imperial Capital, late-stage imperial aura.”

“I’m called Ma Chang, from Windaid Great Imperial Capital, late-stage imperial aura.”

...

Very soon, it was the turn of a wretched-looking old man next to Ye Yuan.

The moment Ye Yuan entered, he quietly sized him up. The rest were all youngsters, only this guy was very old, likely several tens of thousands of years old already.

It was very hard to imagine that such a person could actually be chosen to enter the Ancient God Battlefield.

But since he was able to enter the Virtuous Wind Establishment, he would also be imperial aura at the lousiest.

The wretched-looking old man chuckled, stood up, and said, “This old man is Liu Yi, an itinerant cultivator. I only barely managed to break through to the initial-stage imperial aura due to luck. Although this old man is old, I can’t compare to all of you young talents. When the time comes, please take good care of me.”

Liu Yi’s attitude was exhibited very humbly and did not take advantage of his seniority because of his age, looking very obediently.

But Ye Yuan instinctively felt that this old man was not simple.
