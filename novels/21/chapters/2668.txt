Chapter 2674: Take Them Back!

“Song Wenhao, Greater Sublime Creation Pill, lower second grade!”

Along with Cui Tong’s announcement, everyone marveled in admiration.

Compared to Ye Yuan’s true grade, this was naturally nothing.

But this result was sufficient to overpower his peers.

“Song Wenhao this boy grew stronger again!”

“Really well-deserving of being Heavenly South’s number two genius! His potential isn’t the slightest bit worse than Jiang Li!”

“That Song Minzhe probably already refined it into a ruined pill, right??Huhu,?Third Hall Master is really going to get his face slapped with this!”

… …

After the heavyweights marveled with admiration, there were mocking voices about Ye Yuan.

Seeing Ye Yuan get deflated was what they wanted to do most right now.

Even Song Minzhe himself also turned ashen pale after he saw this result.

He felt that he was probably unable to surpass it.

After all, he had never refined heavenly imperial pills prior to this.

Being able to persevere on this time was a miracle in itself.

While Song Wenhao had a proud look and said with a cold smile, “Reckless and blind thing! Just the likes of you dare to contend for glory with this young master too? You’ll be going to get it after returning to the family clan this time!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Hasn’t Song Minzhe not opened the furnace yet? What are each and every one of you getting excited for?”

Song Tianyang could not help laughing as he said, “Is there still a need to open the furnace? With how Minzhe looked, being able to persevere is already a miracle! There’s a 90% chance that the heavenly pill in this furnace has become a ruined pill already!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Isn’t there still that 10% possibility? Song Minzhe, open the furnace!”

Song Minzhe opened the furnace with a flustered mood.

Boom!

The moment the medicine cauldron opened, a heavenly pill appeared before everyone very quickly.

The countenances of the big shots instantly changed.

Song Wenhao’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “How is this possible? It … It actually formed into a pill!”

Song Tianyang had a blank look too as he said, “Minzhe’s refinement clearly had no methodology to speak of, and yet his refinement can form a pill like this too?”

Song Wenhao gave a cold snort and said, “It’s useless even if it forms into a pill too! With just the likes of this trash, he can only refine a lower grade one too!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Cui Tong, examine the pill!”

Cui Tong complied and put the Greater Sublime Creation Pill on the Cloud Mount Mother Stone and said, “Song Minzhe, Greater Sublime Creation Pill, middle third grade!”

This sentence was seemingly like a sledgehammer abruptly smashing onto everyone’s hearts.

All of the family heads were collectively turned to stone at this instant!

Not only did the Song Minzhe who had never refined a heavenly imperial pill before refine it, it even directly reached middle third grade!”

This was just a short three months, how could such a miraculous thing occur?

Could it be that this Third Hall Master cast magic on him?

“This … This is impossible! How can this trash possibly refine an upper third grade heavenly imperial pill? I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it!” Song Wenhao felt that he was being deceived.

How could this kind of thing possibly happen?

Three months ago, Song Minzhe was clearly a trash that he looked down upon.

Three months later, Ye Yuan actually turned stone to gold, trampling him, this Heavenly South’s number one genius, ruthlessly underfoot?

He could not help looking towards Song Minzhe and discovered that the latter had a blank face too, with pleasant surprise mixed in it.

Clearly, even he himself did not quite dare to believe it!

Song Tianyang looked at Ye Yuan with a dull look and said, “T-Third Hall Master, this … Why in the world is it like this?”

Ye Yuan had a look of it being natural and right on his face as he said coolly, “No rush, continue watching. Who’s next?”

“I’ll go!”

Yun Yuan came forward of his own accord and stepped forward.

His gaze swept over that group of people, finally landing on a youth in a yellow shirt.

“I chose him!” Yun Yuan pointed to the youth in the yellow shirt and said.

“This … Yun Yuan actually picked the worst one in the Lin Family, Lin Zhaoyuan! He’s lowering his status by doing so!”

“Third Hall Master didn’t say that they can’t choose like this either! Since it’s within the permissible scope of the rules, what’s wrong with it?”

“I don’t believe that this bunch of brats can overturn the heavens!”

… …

The group of family heads clearly could not accept this reality. Because the thing that happened before their eyes was too subverting!

A fellow with mediocre talent became a top genius in a blink of an eye.

And all these just happened in a short three months’ time.

Then, what was with all the hard work that they put in previously?

Wouldn’t it become a joke?

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly and said, “Can! Lin Zhaoyuan, you come.”

“Yes!”

Lin Zhaoyuan complied and stepped out of the ranks.

Very soon, the two people entered a pill refining state.

Yun Yuan was unable to refine heavenly imperial pills, but his strength already infinitely approached the standard of a heavenly imperial pill.

Therefore, the difficulty of the grade two heavenly pill that he chose was also extremely high.

This Lin Zhaoyuan’s talent was even worse than Song Minzhe according to these family heads’ understanding.

Among these 200 over people, he could basically rank in the top ten from the bottom.

No matter how impressive such a fellow was, it was also impossible to win, right?

But Ye Yuan knew that Yun Yuan had kicked an iron plate!

If Song Minzhe’s strength was ranked first place among the people that he chose, then this Lin Zhaoyuan was the one who made the greatest improvement!

Although this boy’s talent was not as good as Song Minzhe’s, his disposition was even more tenacious than Song Minzhe’s!

In these three months, Lin Zhaoyuan virtually practiced like he went mad.

Under Ye Yuan’s guidance, Lin Zhaoyuan’s improvement was extremely terrifying.

One should say that among the people he selected, Lin Zhaoyuan’s current strength could absolutely rank in the top three!

Therefore, the result went without saying.

Yun Yuan’s final result was middle sixth grade!

While Lin Zhaoyuan reached a terrifying upper eighth grade!

It was only a step away from ninth grade!

Which was also to say that he was actually not far from heavenly imperial pills too.

In fact, if he was lucky, he would be able to refine heavenly imperial pills too!

This result blew the minds of all the family heads once again.

Top ten from the bottom, defeated the second place from the top!

Three months!

Only three months! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Next, those so-called geniuses that were rejected by Ye Yuan, engaged in battle one after another.

It was just that, no matter who the opponent they picked, the final result was each so-called genius being defeated!

These over 50 people that Ye Yuan selected, their strengths were equally terrifying!

The more the family heads watched, the more they felt a chill in their hearts. The more they watched, the more they quaked in their boots.

These three months of transformation could simply be said to be turning the whole world upside down!

Those disciples who were not being valued in their families, collectively performed an astonishing great reversal three months later, trampling each and every one of those so-called genius disciples underfoot.

Toward the end, they even somewhat could not bear to continue watching anymore.

Too tragic to behold!

This was also to say that the geniuses that they spent so many years and expended countless effort and resources to nurture, were all trash!

The blow was tremendous!

Or should they say, Ye Yuan’s means were too miraculous and could turn a bunch of trash into geniuses?

They had no choice but to be convinced!

“T-Third Hall Master, since they all could make such a big improvement within three months, then the others’ improvement should be even greater! C-Can’t you take them in?” Song Tianyang said lacking in confidence.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “It’s no use! During these three months, this hall master didn’t discriminate against one and show partiality to the other! What I taught them was completely the same! But you all saw it too. The result is like this! Of course, I won’t rule out that among them, someone can strive harder after knowing humiliation and can meet my requirements. But right now, you all take them back.”
