Chapter 1528 Huge Fortune

Three months later, Ye Yuan finally refined a portion of the spirit source crystal soul.

This great hall’s information directly poured into his sea of consciousness.

What Ye Yuan controlled right now was just one-third of this hall.

If he wanted to further control the Purple Extreme Hall, he had to cultivate the follow-up cultivation method.

“Hiss ... this divine essence stone expenditure is also too terrifying!” Ye Yuan was left speechless with wonder.

Unleashing an attack that eradicated first-layered heaven Divine Lord once needed to expend 50 million low-grade divine essence stones.

This was practically equivalent to a first-layered heaven Divine Lord martial artist’s entire net worth.

Because Ye Yuan had the identity of an alchemist and his strength was extremely daunting, that was how he easily had several tens of millions of low-grade divine essence stones on him.

Ordinary martial artists, like Ye Yuan’s realm, to have several hundred thousands of divine essence stones were already pretty good.

One had to know, martial artists’ cultivation required the help of divine essence stones. Purchasing cultivation resources also needed divine essence stones. This was a massive consumable and could not be saved.

This was still just first-layered heaven Divine Lord. The stronger the opponent’s strength, the more horrifying the resources consumed.

Additionally, the resources required for flying was also very frightening. The divine essence stones expended for a day’s flight at full power would reach a million divine essence stones.

“Tsk tsk, this is totally something for rich people to play!” Ye Yuan lamented.

“However, it’s indeed a good thing!” Dustless praised.

“Senior, is there a way to save this Purple Extreme Sect’s senior?” Ye Yuan asked.

“No way to salvage. Even a more powerful existence can’t withstand the ravaging of time too. That’s merely a wisp of divine sense. After being sealed for countless years, it’s already almost dissipating,” Dustless said disconsolately.

“Like that huh, that’s too bad.” Ye Yuan said regretfully.

When Ye Yuan returned to reality, he discovered that the thin old man was currently sizing him up with a curious look on his face.

“Senior, many thanks!” Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said.

The old man smiled and said, “The one who should be saying thank you is me. This old man has been sealed for countless years, and it’s you who freed me. To be able to encounter a successor like you is my Purple Extreme Hall’s blessing! This way, this old man can also go in peace.”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “Senior, you ...”

The old man smiled and said, “The meaning of this old man’s existence is to find a suitable successor for the Purple Extreme Hall. Now that you’ve appeared, this old man naturally has no need to exist anymore too.”

This old man’s meaning was that he wanted to end himself!

According to what was said previously, he had at least a few years to live.

But now, he did not want to live anymore.

While talking, the old man’s figure gradually dissipated.

“Kid, what’s your name?” The old man asked.

Ye Yuan said respectfully, “This junior is Ye Yuan.”

The old man laughed loudly and said, “Good! Very good! Ye Yuan, you won’t disappoint this old man! Remember, this old man is called Nie Sheng, the Purple Extreme Sect’s last sect master. Today, this old man can finally atone for my crime!”

Ye Yuan watched the other party turn into countless light particles, gradually dissipating. He heaved a sigh and said, “Senior Nie Sheng rest assured, this junior will definitely bring the Purple Extreme Sect to greater heights.”

Hearing this, Nie Sheng’s face revealed a look of relief and departed with satisfaction.

Ye Yuan’s mind stirred, appearing in a space inside the Purple Extreme Hall.

Looking at the celestial deity artifacts that piled up like mountains, Ye Yuan had a feeling like he was dreaming. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Tsk tsk, am I considered to be an upstart now? A sect’s treasure trove is all here!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Cultivation methods, martial techniques, celestial deity artifacts, divine essence stones ...

These cultivation resources were stored inside this space into categories, making Ye Yuan have a feeling of walking into a treasure vault.

Just the low-grade divine essence stones were as many as five billion!

Of course, this was definitely not the original reserves

Although the Purple Extreme Hall had always been in a sealed state, this did not mean that it did not consume divine essence stones.

This expenditure was very small, but it could not stand up to the passage of time.

Presumably, back then when Nie Sheng sealed the Purple Extreme Hall, the number of divine essence stones controlled was definitely rather terrifying.

Now, this five billion was likely just a fraction of back then.

With this five billion, it could at least eradicate 100 first-layered heaven Fiend Lord existences.

Of course, the prerequisite was to lure the other party into the Purple Extreme Hall.

The Purple Extreme Hall’s killing array could only be activated inside the hall.

“Tsk tsk, no wonder the Blood Yama Hall went through so much trouble. 50 to 60 low-grade divine lord mystic treasures. If this news was known by the outside world, that would be explosive!”

Inside a miniature space, 50 to 60 low-grade divine lord mystic treasures were quietly suspended, stirring people’s hearts.

It was also just Ye Yuan. If it were others, they would probably go crazy.

Incomparably valuable divine lord mystic treasures, there were 50 to 60 articles the moment they came. This was simply an astronomical figure!

The value of one divine lord mystic treasure was at least 10 billion too.

Ye Yuan was equivalent to having a wealth of 560 billion all at once. This was not even counting the value of the other cultivation methods and martial techniques.

And this was still just the market price. Who would be silly enough to take divine lord mystic treasures out to sell?

Hence, the price of a divine lord mystic treasure tended to be several times higher than the market price!

Ye Yuan was still feeling satisfied because of obtaining the Profound Yellow Cauldron previously. But he did not expect that in a blink of an eye, he fell into a divine lord mystic treasure ocean.

However, these divine lord mystic treasures were mostly sabers, spears, swords, and halberds, mainly these weapons. There were even a small number of auxiliary-types. But there really wasn’t medicinal cauldrons.

Divine lord mystic treasure medicinal cauldrons were a scarce item in the first place. This was simply a priceless treasure to alchemists.

Furthermore, each and every alchemist was extremely wealthy. Hence, the price of medicinal cauldrons could not be judged with common sense at all.

The Profound Yellow Cauldron simply had demand but no supply.

Ye Yuan carefully investigated these divine lord mystic treasures. His mind stirred, a long sword flew into his hand.

“Junyi Sword, um ... not bad, it’s you!”

Ye Yuan played a bit and was very satisfied with this sword.

The Evil Extermination Sword was already somewhat of a hindrance to the current Ye Yuan.

When battling with some geniuses, quite a number of people all used celestial deity artifacts. Ye Yuan was at a very big disadvantage.

Ye Yuan looked through these divine lord mystic treasures, only this Junyi Sword was the most suitable for him.

With this Junyi Sword, Ye Yuan’s combat strength would still soar to a higher level.

After all, even among Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, there were barely any who could afford to use divine lord mystic treasures.

“You still can’t fully refine the Purple Extreme Hall right now. The truly good stuff should be in a higher-level space. This bit of treasure is just a speck to a peak True God sect,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said, “Makes sense. However, does the Heavenspan World have sects, this kind of existences, before?”

Dustless shook his head and said, “This, I don’t know. The time that the Heavenspan World has existed is far too long. Nobody knows what the ancient times look like at all. Perhaps before forming the current arrangement, the Heavenspan World might have had sects stand in great numbers. This kind of thing, perhaps only transcendent heavenly emperors and Dao Ancestors, those kinds of existences, would know.”

“Like that huh. Then the matter of establishing a sect would likely have some difficulties,” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

If Ye Yuan started a sect now, it was undoubtedly shattering the existing order. At that time, he would definitely become the target of public wrath.

Within a short time, the promise that he made to Nie Sheng likely could not be carried out.
