Chapter 708: Prepare to Transcend Tribulation!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Rumble!

Beneath the Eternal Splendor Palace where the realm passageway was, there were six colors of light interweaved together, looking extremely vibrant and gorgeous.

That very large hole originally expanded by the Fierce Gale World’s array masters was actually gradually healing!

Very soon, the iridescent rays of light thoroughly plugged up that enormous hole.

After a time interval of several years, Ye Yuan sealed the realm passageway once more with his own power.

However, the Six Extreme Seals Grand Array which Ye Yuan laid down anew was even sturdier than the grand array set up by the Grand Yan True Sect sacrificing the entire sect’s power back then!

The Grand Yan True Sect did not fully comprehend the Array Formations Three Volumes. But Ye Yuan already grasped all of the contents in the stone books fully.

This Six Extreme Seals Grand Array was exceedingly profound and abstruse to others, but it did not have much difficulty to him.

Seeing the realm passageway being sealed shut once more, Qi Hai, Ning Yixian, and the rest were all incredibly agitated.

With this, it was considered severing future troubles forever.

Qi Hai’s strength was the closest to the Boundless Realm. He was able to sense the staggering energy coming from the grand array. So he was also groveling at Ye Yuan’s feet in admiration too.

“Ye Yuan, your valiant and heroic deeds are unparalleled in history and never to be surpassed. If not for you, the entire Endless World would probably have to be reduced to a bloody, savage battlefield! I know that I, this Realmlord, am a little unworthy of the title. But I still have to express my thanks to you on behalf of all the martial artists in the Endless World!” Qi Hai said with endless vicissitude of emotions.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Old Hai don’t need to blame yourself. This was originally a war with a mismatch in strength. Furthermore, Zhao Tianyin they all had plotted for a long time. The Endless World being routed was also something within reason. Alright, this matter has concluded. We should return.”

Qi Hai hesitated for a moment, then asked, “Ye Yuan, your combat strength has already far surpassed the limits of the Endless World, and you already have adequate strength to ascend. I wonder . . . when do you plan on ascending?”

“Uh

. . . Wait a while more. I’ve already arranged for White Light to enter seclusion and cultivate hard. I plan on waiting for him to cultivate to peak Tier 5 and ascend to the Divine Realm together with him. It’s just right. I can make use of this period of time to accompany my parents well. I’ve always been drifting around outside these few years and lacked many opportunities to show my filial piety,” Ye Yuan said.

. . . . . .

Half a year’s time passed in a flash. In this half a year, Ye Yuan rarely cultivated diligently but spent more time on accompanying his parents.

Ever since he reincarnated, he really did not spend much time to accompany Ye Hang and Ren Hongling. Insteady, he had let them suffer considerable hardships.

Spending half a year’s time to accompany them was also considered carrying out filial piety for his predecessor.

In this half a year, the Endless World’s situation also underwent titanic changes.

A sect called the Tranquil Cloud Sect became the sect with the highest position in the Northern Domain. Its fame even overshadowed the three great sects.

And this Tranquil Cloud Sect actually did not have many experts. But their sect master was a figure standing at the pinnacle of this small world.

That person was Ye Yuan!

The Tranquil Cloud Sect reestablished their sect anew at their former site in the Northern Domain! 1

This action fulfilled the long-cherished wish of all the Tranquil Cloud Sect members!

Except, in this war between two worlds, Luo Qingfeng and all of the Tranquil Cloud Sect’s upper echelons died in battle in order to protect the sect’s effective strength.

Later, only after Ye Yuan quelled the war between two worlds did Tian Yu, Ti Wujiu, these pinnacle geniuses of the sect dare to come out and join Ye Yuan.

Under such circumstances, it was not surprising that Ye Yuan became the Tranquil Cloud Sect’s new sect master.

Therefore, this sect which only had one Divine Traversing Realm martial artist became the Endless World’s number one sect!

Ye Yuan set up a Quasi-Tier 6 grand array for the new Tranquil Cloud Sect. Its power reigned supreme throughout the entire Endless World. Even with Qi Hai’s strength, it was impossible to breach this grand array too.

This grand array naturally became the capital for the Tranquil Cloud Sect to be established.

Afterward, Ye Yuan even fully duplicated the Azure Dipper Purple Yang Sword Art, finally completing the Tranquil Cloud Sect’s ultimate skill.

Ye Yuan also carved another row of ‘sword’ characters on the mountain top. It was just that this time, there were only seven characters. And each word was incomparably profound.

These seven ‘sword’ characters were the Azure Dipper Floating Zero Sword’s sword intent.

Ye Yuan left behind the command that if anyone fully comprehended the Azure Dipper Purple Yang Sword Art, they could come to this mountain peak to comprehend the seven sword intents!

Later on, this mountain peak became the holy land which all the Endless World people yearned for!

Because being able to comprehend one of the sword intent among these seven sword intents, one could sweep across the present age!

A hundred years later, a brilliant genius appeared in the Tranquil Cloud Sect. He actually comprehended five of the sword intents Ye Yuan left behind and truly made the Tranquil Cloud Sect become the number one powerful sect in the current era. The Tranquil Cloud Sect finally truly became the number one sect in name as well as in reality!

The latter Tranquil Cloud Sect was even stronger than the Grand Yan True Sect back then!

And along with the Tranquil Cloud Sect’s rise, the Endless World entered a glorious era anew as well. Countless powerhouses rose up in that era.

Apart from this, Ye Yuan answered all of the questions on the Thousand Query Wall’s seventh level and opened it to the public.

Wu Fang City also became the Alchemy Path’s number one holy land in name as well as in reality! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Eight years later, Ye Hang became a peak Alchemy Sovereign powerhouse, and he inherited Ren Xingchun’s mantle, becoming Wu Fang City’s city lord.

The Tranquil Cloud Sect and Wu Fang City, one south and one north, one alchemy and one martial, cooperated with each other across a great distance.

. . . . . .

Half a year later, White Light finally cultivated to peak Tier 5!

“Heh heh, Big Brother, I’ve kept you waiting!”

They were about to ascend to the Divine Realm. It was no wonder White Light was very excited.

“Huhu, you didn’t really kept me waiting. This half a year’s time was a kind of spiritual sublimation to me. Since I rose up in the State of Qin, along the way, my cultivation speed was too fast. Even though I already tried my best to suppress it, there were still quite a lot of hidden dangers. This half a year, no fighting, no cultivation, frequently accompanying by my parents’ side. There wasn’t much different from being an ordinary son. But in this half a year, it had a critically important effect on my cultivation road after today!” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

The best path of cultivation was not advancing leaps and bounds all the way.

At times, settling down and recuperating for a while could instead let the path to walk hereafter be even more solid.

This half a year, Ye Yuan had practically given up on cultivation. But his comprehension towards cultivation realms became even more solid and steady instead.

“Big Brother, what you said is so abstruse. I didn’t understand a word! However, shouldn’t we be ascending?” White Light said excitedly.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “En. You prepare for a bit first. This ascension tribulation isn’t that easy to ascend!”

Only half a month later did White Light know what what Ye Yuan meant by it was not easy to ascend. He was actually going to bring Ren Dong, Xiao Ruyan, and Lu-er to transcend the tribulation together!

The three of them all did not have the qualifications to transcend the tribulation. Bringing the three of them along to transcend the tribulation, the heavenly tribulation would be much more powerful compared to ordinary tribulations of ascension!

The difficulty in this soared by multiple times!

Adding in White Light, the might of this heavenly tribulation was sufficient to destroy the world!

“Big Brother, are you joking? This . . . This is a deadly deal!” White Light swallowed his saliva and said.

Even with his arrogance, he also felt that Ye Yuan’s way of doing things was too presumptuous!
