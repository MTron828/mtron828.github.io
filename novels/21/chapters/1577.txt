“Yuan-er, are you leaving now?”

Ao Jun gripped Ye Yuan’s palm tightly, very reluctant to part with the latter.

They finally managed to lift the curse, and she could have a heart-to-heart talk with her son. But her son was about to leave straight away.

Ye Yuan already accompanied her in the land of exile for as long as a month, but he ultimately still had to bid farewell.

Ao Jun already knew the news of Ji Zhengyang’s death. These few days, she had always been dejected.

Ye Yuan comforted along with Li-er before placating Ao Jun.

“Mother, your child owes Lingxue too much. These few years, I’ve always been living in self-blame. Not being able to save her a day earlier, I find it hard to set my mind at ease!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Finally he managed to reunite with his mother. So he did not wish to leave straight away either.

But the Heavenspan World still had many things waiting for him. He could not delay too much time either.

Seeing his mother’s reluctant appearance, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Your child has magic treasures in his possession now. Hence, entering and exiting spatial turbulent flows are very easy. In the future, as long as I’m free, I’ll come back to see you!”

The old ancestor also said by the side, “Good men have far-reaching ambitions. Since he knows that there’s a broader world outside, why should he remain in this small corner?”

Hearing the old ancestor said so, Ao Jun could not have the heart to delay Ye Yuan. She knew she could not let him stay any further. So she said with an embarrassed smile, “Yuan-er, mother knows that it wasn’t easy for you to walk this entire way. You have got to be more careful in the Heavenspan World!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Rest assured, I will!”

Leaving the land of exile, Ye Yuan took a trip to Kunwu Divine Wood there again.

Seeing Kunwu again at this time, Ye Yuan felt the former was even more unfathomable. This made him greatly astonished inwardly.

Just what realm was this Kunwu Divine Wood?!

Ye Yuan was shocked, but actually, Kunwu was even more shocked than him.

Recalling that time when Ye Yuan left back then, Kunwu was a hundred times pessimistic about Ye Yuan.

Who could have thought that after a hundred years went by, and then when he returned again, Ye Yuan broke through to middle-stage Origin Deity like flying.

Furthermore, he distinctly sensed that Ye Yuan sundered Heavenly Dao and was actually still able to mobilize the power of Heavenly Dao. This was simply unimaginable.

“You brat, how in the world did you do it?” Kunwu looked at Ye Yuan and said in shock.

Ye Yuan’s battle with Heavenly Sin, Kunwu was naturally all aware.

At that time, he surprised him considerably.

Dustless’s figure flashed out and he said with a smile, “Old Kun, you and I both made an error in judgment! This kid’s potential is much stronger than Old Fart Immortal Grove!”

Kunwu’s gaze turned intent and he said in surprise, “How so?”

Dustless stroked his beard and said with a smile, “What Immortal Grove has done, he accomplished it. What Immortal Grove didn’t achieve, he has also done it. I’m very much looking forward to what kind of height he can attain in the future.”

Kunwu’s pupils constricted and he said in shock, “If Old Fart Immortal Grove didn’t fall, Heavenly Emperor Realm is attainable! Could it be that this kid still has the possibility of reaching the realm of Transcendent Heavenly Emperor?”

Dustless smiled and did not speak, stifling Kunwu until he felt even more confused.

Ye Yuan originally wanted to see if he could invite Kunwu to come out of retirement, but he discovered that even if the current Heavenly Dao had recovered a lot, it still could not bear a level of existence like Kunwu. So Ye Yuan could only drop the matter.

After finishing settling everything, Ye Yuan brought Li-er, White Light, Fiery, Lu-er, four people, and entered the spatial turbulent flow once more.

Over 100 years had passed, these few people’s strengths had also made great progress.

Li-er, White Light, and Fiery three people’s constitutions were special. At this time, they were already all Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouses.

Even Lu-er had already reached grand completion Grotto Profound as well, just one step away from being able to break through to Heaven Glimpse Realm.

These few people were going to the Heavenspan World and had excited looks too, grabbing Ning Siyu and Liang Wanru, asking non-stop, just like four curious babies.

Staying for such a long time in the Immortal Grove World, Liang Wanru already knew why Ye Yuan would stay such a respectful distance away from her.

Nothing to do with looks!

He was unable to even give a promise to Li-er, let alone her?

This way, Liang Wanru became much more open-minded, her entire person also becoming significantly more cheerful.

But Ye Yuan came to Little Fatty’s side and said with a smile, “This trip, did you get any harvest?”

Little Fatty gave Ye Yuan a glance and said with a sigh, “Really can’t imagine, even you had such a sorrowful past too.”

This place was Ye Yuan’s hometown, Little Fatty and the rest were naturally very curious about Ye Yuan’s past matters.

Only upon inquiry did they know that Ye Yuan suffered his brother’s betrayal in his previous life, and met with his father being killed.

Later, he also encountered his beloved burning her divine soul this kind of thing.

It seemed like his misfortune was not worth mentioning compared to Ye Yuan at all.

If not for hearing these things with his own ears, he completely could not imagine that a happy-go-lucky person like Ye Yuan actually had such a past.

He also finally understood Ye Yuan’s painstaking efforts.

Recalling things in his heart and asking himself, if he had Ye Yuan’s experiences, he would probably have long become a madman who was homicidal.

But Ye Yuan did not blame heaven and other people.

He relied on his own efforts and walked step by step, taking revenge for his father and seeking a lease of life for his beloved.

How much willpower did this require?!

Ye Yuan doing so much was simply to let him pull himself together anew.

Little Fatty looked at Ye Yuan gratefully, his face revealing a long-lost smile and said, “Ye Yuan, thank you!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “That’s more like it! Seeing your wretched smile, I knew that that little fatty is back again!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

...

Inside the Pill Tower, Deercry was currently denouncing Ye Yuan harshly to Head Elder Rou Xu.

“Head Elder, what capability does this brat have, how can he suddenly become an elder?! A Three-star Alchemy God becoming a Pill Tower’s elder, wouldn’t it incur people’s ridicule if it spreads? ...”

Head Elder listened quietly, his face not having any expressions, no joy nor sorrow.

When Deercry finished, Rou Xu mused for a moment before slowly saying, “This matter was directly decided by the higher-ups, so even I don’t know all the details too! I ask you, how’s that kid’s strength?”

Deercry said indignantly, “Bah! What strength can he have? In my view, he’s deliberately mystifying things to look mysterious! He, a Three-star Alchemy God, can give pointers to Lu Yi? Saying it also got to have people believe it too! I’m sure that this is merely Xuan Yu deliberately setting a deceptive battle array to mislead the enemy! Lu Yi must have had a breakthrough long ago and kept it secret all the way, waiting to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat in the Pill Tower’s competition this time! It’s just that as luck would have it, this was encountered by me and they set up a trap, ensnaring me inside!”

Until now, Deercry did not believe that Ye Yuan could give pointers to Lu Yi to refine a high-grade Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill.

This kind of thing was completely illogical.

Head Elder’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Your meaning is that this kid is merely a chess piece of Xuan Yu, used to delude us?”

Deercry nodded and said, “Apart from this kind of situation, I can’t think of other possibilities at all! However, Head Elder, you have to be careful. Xuan Yu might have had considerable breakthroughs in Alchemy Dao recently. That Purple Quill Marrow Extermination’s poison, I heard that it’s incurable, but he borrowed Ye Yuan’s hands and dealt with it!”

Head Elder could not help musing. Ye Yuan’s appearance had indeed disrupted all of his arrangements.

But he had to admit that Deercry’s concerns were very reasonable.

It could not be denied that this Ye Yuan definitely had some strength. Otherwise, Xuan Yu would not have picked him either.

But to say that Ye Yuan was heaven-defying to the extent where he could give pointers to a Four-star Alchemy God, he did not believe.

“This matter was directly decided by the higher-ups, I can’t say anything either. How much ability that Ye Yuan has, we’ll know with a try! The Pill Tower competition this time, you personally go and challenge him!” Head Elder suddenly said.
