Chapter 1964: You’re Playing With Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Based on the worldview that Dustless instilled in Ye Yuan, Dao Ancestors were eternal and undying existences. They were the apex existences of this world.

They controlled the laws in an area, representing Heavenly Dao.

Who could kill them?

But now, someone said that Dao Ancestors could die too.

This caused a tremendous impact on Ye Yuan’s worldview.

Jian Fengqi was Jian Sutao’s daughter. These words definitely came from him.

With Jian Sutao’s position in the Jian Family, could these words merely be a groundless rumor?

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Jian Hongxiao said with a smile, “Huhu, back then when I heard this, my expression was exactly the same as yours. But thinking about it now, I’m afraid that Lord Sutao also heard about it as a rumor,”

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “This Ancient God Battlefield ... is rather interesting.”

The two people were currently chatting away idly when someone from outside reported that Jian Hao brought Jian Yun to request an audience.

Ye Yuan and Jian Hongxiao exchanged a glance and smiled. Jian Hongxiao said smilingly, “Looks like Jian Hao is here to ask for a pill. Should we meet him or not?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That will have to depend on his sincerity. I’ll leave it to you. I’ll avoid him for a bit first.”

...

The weary-looking Jian Hao brought the blind Jian Yun and entered the hall.

Seeing Jian Hongxiao, Jian Hao hesitated for a moment, but he still gave a bow toward Jian Hongxiao. He said, “I pay respects to Elder Jian Hongxiao.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jian Hongxiao was currently sitting solemnly as a show of respect and did not give a response.

These two people contended with each other overtly and covertly for as long as several tens of thousands of years. Back then, when Jian Hongxiao fell into distress, the one who trampled the hardest was also Jian Hao.

Now, making him treat Jian Hao with a calm state of mind, it was clearly not that easy.

Jian Hao had an awkward look, unable to leave nor stay.

He had no choice but to put aside his own pride to come and find Jian Hongxiao for the sake of his son today.

Since Jian Hongxiao obtained the Six Vein Stellar Pill, that meant that there was someone who could refine this medicinal pill.

His son’s eyes could only be saved by the Six Vein Stellar Pill.

Jian Hongxiao drank his tea as if these two people were air.

Back then, he suffered Heavenly Dao backlash and was heavily injured, being on the verge of dying. Even though he consumed medicinal pills, he also laid on the bed for several decades, barely managing to preserve his life.

At that time, Jian Hao took his place and assumed the position of elder. In fact, he had once advocated for sentencing Jian Hongxiao to death.

Banishing to Extreme Light Imperial City this matter was also completed under Jian Hao’s urging.

Now, this bit of reciprocal was naturally considered nothing.

Jian Hao gritted his teeth and knelt down with a thud, clenching his teeth, and he said, “Elder Hongxiao, Jian Hao knows that I was unfair to you, but I only have this one son. I don’t want him to become a cripple. I beg you to help!”

Although the Jian Yun by the side was blind, he also knew that his father knelt down. His expression changed greatly as he said, “Dad, how ... how can you kneel down toward him?”

“Shut up! You kneel down for me too and offer an apology to Elder Hongxiao!” Jian Hongxiao said fiercely.

Jian Yun’s face flickered incessantly. Making him kneel down toward Jian Hongxiao was simply unprecedented humiliation.

He hated Jian Hongxiao, hated him for saying that he would not amount to much.

Bang!

Jian Hao flicked a finger; Jian Yun knelt down involuntarily.

In his ears, came Jian Hao’s scolding, “Unfilial son, Elder Hongxiao is the only person who can save you right now! Unless you want to be a cripple for life!”

Jian Yun was startled and no longer struggled.

He did not wish to become a cripple for life.

Looking at this father and son pair, Jian Hongxiao slowly opened his mouth and said, “Alright, Jian Hao, your apology, I accept it. But ... Jian Yun’s eyes, I can’t help you.”

Jian Hao nodded his head and said, “I understand Elder Hongxiao’s meaning. Jian Hao isn’t asking for other things. I only beg you to speak in recommendation of me, and let me meet this expert.”

He did not think that Jian Hongxiao could help him with anything to begin with. Disregarding the relationship between the two of them, how could an expert who could refine such a high quality Six Vein Stellar Pill be possibly influenced by Jian Hongxiao?

The expert behind Jian Hongxiao was at least a Seven-star Alchemy God!

Furthermore, this kind of Seven-star Alchemy God, his status absolutely would not be inferior to City Lord.

It was just that Jian Hao was very confused. Why would such an important person be willing to refine pills for Jian Hongxiao?

Jian Hongxiao said, “Alright, I’ll go and help you ask for his opinion.”

Finished saying, Jian Hongxiao turned around and left. Before long, he came back and said, “The master agreed to see you guys. Follow me.”

When the father and son two people heard it, they were wildly elated in their hearts.

What they were most afraid of was that he would not meet.

As long as he was willing to meet, everything could be discussed.

Jian Hongxiao was presently a Stellar Hall’s elder. The mansion conferred onto him naturally would not be small.

With a few turns, the few people arrived in a courtyard.

Jian Hao faced inside and gave a deep bow, opened his mouth, and said, “Junior Stellar Hall’s protector, Jian Hao, pays respect to Senior. I beg Senior to bestow my son a Six Vein Stellar Pill.”

When Jian Hongxiao heard that, a hint of a smile flashed across his face.

This old fogey actually took Ye Yuan to be a senior.

But it made sense. Under the circumstances where one was ignorant, probably anyone would also think that the one who refined the pill for him was an Empyrean Realm big shot, right?

A ridiculously young figure slowly walked out, Jian Hao’s expression instantly became extremely ugly.

“Jian Hongxiao, you ... you’re playing with me?” Jian Hao looked toward Jian Hongxiao and said in a great rage.

Jian Hao knew that this young man was the main culprit who caused his son to end up like this.

Now that he showed up here, wasn’t this intentionally embarrassing him and making fun of him?

Who he wanted to meet was the master, not this brat!

“Dad, what’s wrong?” Jian Yun could not see and asked doubtfully.

Jian Hao said furiously, “He’s making fun of us father and son. This isn’t some master at all, but that punk who caused you to become like this!”

“What?!” Jian Yun was enraged the moment he heard it.

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said indifferently, “He’s the master that he wanted to see.”

Jian Hao did not believe it at all. Waving his hand, he said coldly, “Speaking nonsense! Do you take me for a fool? At this age, forget about being a Six-star Alchemy God! Being able to learn the basics of alchemy is already pretty good! Even if he’s a Six-star Alchemy God, the Six Vein Stellar Pill is also not what the likes of his age can refine!”

But Jian Hongxiao shook his head and said, “I don’t have the time to crack this kind of jokes with you. My Six Vein Stellar Pill was refined by Ye Yuan. I brought him to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital in order to find City Lord to ask for the Six Vein Stellar Pill’s pill formula. Otherwise, who else do you think can refine the Six Vein Stellar Pill in this Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital?”

The series of words made Jian Hao calm down.

Jian Hongxiao’s sudden return was very fishy to begin with.

In these 100 thousand over years, he had not returned once before.

Thinking of how Jian Yun went blind with one look again, could it be that this Ye Yuan really had an extremely exuberant destiny?

Linking these events up, it was really very likely!

But, this brat looked to be only a thousand over years old no matter how one looked at him. How could he refine the Six Vein Stellar Pill?

This kind of thing was simply too ludicrous.

Jian Hao looked at Ye Yuan with an awkward look.

“M-Master, don’t blame me. It’s truly ... truly ... rather hard to believe,” Jian Hao said.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “No worries. Even though Jian Yun was a little domineering, his crime isn’t to this extent. Since Elder Hongxiao isn’t pressing the case with you guys, I’m indifferent. I can help you guys refine the medicinal pill, but the spirit medicines need you to prepare yourself.”

Jian Hao was overjoyed when he heard it and hurriedly said, “Thank you, Master!”
