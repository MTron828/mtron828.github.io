Chapter 2411: Fooled!

With the divine son dying, the morale of the troops was lost. How could the Divine Children Legion still be the human army’s match?

They finally could not hold out but to collapse.

A rout was like a landslide, the Divine Children Legion fell into utter disarray very quickly, their combat effectiveness plummeting.

On the contrary, the human army’s side, being inspired by Ye Yuan, each and every one of them erupted with powerful strength, completely overwhelming the Divine Children Legion.

The Divine Children Legion scattered in all directions, running all over the sky. No one knew how many had died.

The powerful Divine Children Legion collapsed like a house of cards at this moment.

In the huge fleeing army, Nineorigin was mixed inside, trying to smoke his way through.

Just as he was chuckling to himself, thinking that Ye Yuan did not notice him.

There was suddenly a blur before his eyes, a figure was already blocking in front of him.

“Old friends meeting, not even saying hello; it’s also too much, right?”

Ye Yuan’s voice was very flat, but the indifference exuding from it made Nineorigin terrified.

He sensed killing intent!

“You ... What do you want?” Nineorigin took several steps back in a row, his complexion deathly pale and his words full of fear.

“What do I want? Huhu, my Lord Nineorigin, don’t you know what I want? Back then, when you took Li-er away from me, you probably didn’t think that there would be such a day, right?” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

Yeah, the Nineorigin back then showed disdain on the world. Why would he pay attention to a puny little Empyrean Realm?

Even if he was seriously injured, he did not think that Ye Yuan would be of any threat anymore either.

But circumstances change with the passing of time When Ye Yuan was standing in front of him again, he actually fused three great laws, and he slew a divine son with one sword.

He was already completely reduced to an ant in front of Ye Yuan.

When someone who once looked up to you stood in front of you again, but you were looking up to him, this kind of taste was really sour.

Mentioning Li-er, Nineorigin seemed to have grasped a final life-saving straw. He said, “Ye Yuan, you dare to kill me? Don’t you want to know what happened to Yue Mengli? Let me tell you, if I die, she’ll have to die too!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, indeed somewhat cautious in taking action.

Ninelives was overjoyed in his heart and hurriedly struck while the iron was hot. He said, “Let me tell you, Yue Mengli has been refusing to become a divine daughter. Now, she’s locked up in the Profound Lineage’s prison. It was me who kept persuading the ancestors in the clan to keep her life. If I die, she’ll definitely die without a doubt!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed when he heard that, a look of worry appearing on his face.

These few years, he had constantly been worried about Li-er’s safety. But with his current strength, he had no way of going to the divine race’s territory at all.

Now, seeing Nineorigin, this was probably the only channel to inquire about Li-er’s news.

“Tell me, how is Li-er now?” Ye Yuan said in a deep voice.

Ninelives smiled coldly and said, “You know Yue Mengli’s temperament best. She has been refusing to become a divine daughter all along! Her personality is too stubborn and can’t be persuaded no matter what. There was even a big quarrel over this before. The ancestors in the clan were enraged and wanted to sentence her to death! However, her talent is indeed high, I also used this as the reason and kept persuading the clan. That’s how I saved her life! Now, she’s being locked up in the clan’s prison. If I die, she’ll definitely be sentenced to death by the elders in the clan within half a year!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Just the likes of you have such a big influence in the clan?”

Nineorigin laughed loudly and said, “I can’t, but that doesn’t mean that my father can’t! My father is a middle-stage Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse. He still has quite the authority to speak in the clan!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, a hint of worry flashed across in his eyes.

As the saying went, losing yourself in concern. Even if Ye Yuan had a meticulous mind, he was also somewhat having reservation currently.

Nineorigin ignored Ye Yuan’s obstruction, directly walking past him, and said with a faint smile, “How about it? I’m going now. Do you still want to stop?”

Done talking, he left with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan did not stop and actually allowed him to go freely. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Nineorigin walked very steadily as if he did not care about Ye Yuan’s attitude in the slightest.

But, after he left the battlefield, he ran as if he was mad.

What he said earlier, not a single word was true. They were all lies made up on the spot in order to live.

He knew that Ye Yuan valued Yue Mengli immensely. Hearing the news that Yue Mengli’s life was hanging by a thread, he absolutely would not make things difficult for him.

In reality, Yue Mengli had long already become a divine daughter!

Furthermore, Yue Mengli’s present strength already reached the realm of Nine-marks!

The speed of progress was simply inconceivable!

But he similarly knew that Ye Yuan was extremely clever. The lie definitely would be found out soon.

After Ye Yuan calmed down, he would definitely be able to detect the fishiness.

Hence, he had to flee for his life right now!

The current Ye Yuan was too terrifying, he did not dare to slack off in the slightest.

Even staying for a fraction of a second more was playing with his life too!

There was a divine race camp roughly three days west of Upper Essence Valley. There were quite a number of Nine-marks experts there!

This place was his only chance of life!

As long as he escaped here, he would be able to escape with his life!

After Nineorigin left, Ye Yuan felt very irritated in his heart. Hence, he went on a killing spree!

His current cultivation realm already reached peak World Realm and he even fused time, space, and sword, three kinds of power of laws, his strength terrifying to the extreme.

The Divine Children Legion’s warriors had long already fallen into utter disarray. How could they be his match?

Ye Yuan brought the human army and carried out a blood massacre before stopping.

In this battle, the Divine Children Legion had close to three-quarters die, virtually being wiped out.

This scale of Divine Children Legion already existed in name only.

This was absolutely a tremendous blow to the divine race.

Two days later, Ye Yuan gathered the army and counted the numbers. He discovered that the human army also had nearly 40% lost. The army of over 100 thousand was only left with less than 70 thousand at this time.

One could say that it was a pyrrhic victory.

But these unpredictable children had experienced the baptism of war, each person’s mental outlook underwent massive changes.

The impact of this battle on them was extremely far-reaching.

Although the numbers fell, the combat power of this army grew even stronger.

However, Ye Yuan’s thoughts were not on this.

Having ceased all activities at this time, he kept feeling that something was off.

But, he could not put his finger to it either.

“Wan Zhen, order the army to enter Upper Essence Valley and search for the Dragon Clan’s remnants!” Ye Yuan commanded.

“Yes, Lord Saint Azure!”

After this battle, they already prostrated on all fours toward Ye Yuan in admiration.

The title of Saint Azure was absolutely not an undeserved reputation.

This kind of monstrous comprehension ability simply made people despair.

Of course, this was the opponent’s despair, and also the hope of the human race.

But right then, Ye Yuan’s footsteps suddenly stopped, the expression on his face becoming incredibly ugly.

“What’s wrong, Lord Saint Azure?” Wan Zhen asked in confusion.

Ye Yuan’s expression was livid and he said with a cold smile, “Heh, didn’t expect that I, Ye Yuan, would actually have times when I get fooled by someone! Nineorigin, I really underestimated you! However, do you really think that you can escape?”

The current Ye Yuan finally came to a realization.

Li-er’s personality being unwavering, Nineorigin did not know about it until later.

When they kidnapped Li-er into the Blackflame Cave, she was already extremely resistant to becoming a divine daughter.

With Nineorigin’s shrewdness, how could he fail to see Li-er’s personality that would rather break than bend?

If the divine race did not have the means to turn Li-er into a divine daughter, then why would Nineorigin expend such a great effort to get Li-er back to the Abyss World?
