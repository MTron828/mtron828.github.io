Chapter 2929: Catching up From Behind!

“It’s eight wroughts already!”

“Impressive! Impressive! Qin Shitian is really showing signs of catching up!”

“Great Emperor Eastsun indeed has eyes like torches! Qin Shitian really erupted this time!”

... ...

After the 14th kind of Dao fire descended, Qin Shitian finally broke through to the realm of eight wroughts!

Hence, the people were ignited once more.

Up until now, there was already nothing else to pay attention to in this round.

Although Zhou Yu and He Chen were still struggling bitterly, there was already no one paying attention to them.

These two people would quit sooner or later.

The only thing worth paying attention to was the competition between Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian!

The competition of six by seven, 27 kinds of Dao fires, had already passed now!

Qin Shitian showed signs of catching up rapidly from behind!

Meanwhile, Ye Yuan still had no activities until now.

The current Qin Shitian seemed to be accumulating momentum, waiting to soar to the sky in one bound!

After his grand awakening, he indeed did not let Great Emperor Eastsun down, exhibiting amazing perseverance and potential!

One had to know, after 14 kinds of Dao fires, it was like the Soul Controlling Avenue’s segments, the difficulty coefficient soaring.

The Soul Refining Furnace was a glaze color. It was transparent.

Everyone could see that inside was already filled with multi-colored chaos Dao fires.

Under 14 kinds of Dao fires, it was not as simple as one plus one equals two.

In the Soul Refining Furnace, the soul body was constantly enduring endless agony. Even the slightest carelessness and one would turn to ashes!

Even if it was Qin Shitian and Ye Yuan, they were no exceptions either.

That kind of pain, look at Zhou Yu and He Chen two people, and one would know.

But Qin Shitian broke through time and again. Everyone’s enthusiasm was ignited by him!

However, everyone understood that following that would be the toughest test!

Qin Shitian said before, after 21 kinds of Dao fires, a powerhouse with ten wroughts was unable to persist too.

This was also to say that 14 kinds to 21 kinds were the two people’s limit already.

Whoever won or lost, it might be time to showcase their true abilities!

When the 16th Dao fire descended, He Chen could not hold on and had to withdraw.

When it was the 17th, Zhou Yu could not hold on anymore as well.

At this time, there was no one left in the Soul Refining Furnace anymore, except for two people. There were only Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian left.

Over at Ye Yuan there, it had been very quiet all along, without any activities at all. It looked just like he was eking out a miserable existence.

While Qin Shitian this side was everyone’s focal point.

Inside the Soul Refining Furnace, Qin Shitian was screaming miserably. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But his aura was getting stronger and stronger!

Finally, after the 20th Dao fire descended, he broke through again!

Nine wroughts!

With this, even Great Emperor Eastsun was not calm anymore too.

He was very optimistic about Qin Shitian, but he did not expect that Qin Shitian would give him one pleasant surprise after another.

Nine wroughts!

Before entering the hall entrance assessment, Great Emperor Eastsun had never even thought about it before.

He had long expected that after experiencing three rounds of assessment, there was no problem in Qin Shitian breaking through to seven wroughts.

But now, he already entered nine wroughts!

“Tied! With this, they are back to the same starting line again!”

“With this, he really caught up from behind!”

“Ten wroughts! Will the legendary ten wroughts appear?”

“There’s still half of the Dao fires left at the back! If they can really hold on, ten wroughts will definitely appear!”

... ...

After the second round, everyone thought that the third round would become boring.

Who knew that Qin Shitian strove harder after knowing humiliation and actually caught up miraculously!

Reaching nine wroughts, Qin Shitian was tied with Ye Yuan!

“Haha, this seat indeed didn’t misjudge this boy! Already nine wroughts! In this seat’s view, he will definitely be able to steep into ten wroughts!” Great Emperor Eastsun already gave up on the reservedness of a great emperor, being pleased with himself as he said with a loud laugh.

Westdawn and Woodrelease, two great emperors, took a look at Zhou Yu and He Chen, and they could not help sighing slightly.

In this competition, they had lost until they were badly mauled all over!

Who could have thought that Qin Shitian could actually be so heaven-defying, suddenly awakening amidst adversity, soaring to the sky in one bound?

The legendary ten wroughts!

Nine wroughts to ten wroughts was a huge threshold!

It was a hundred times harder than stepping into the Emperor Realm!

To someone who was ten wroughts, stepping into the Emperor Realm was just ordinary.

As long as they did not fall, their lowest future achievement would also be an origin level great emperor!

If they really stepped into ten wroughts, that would really be leaping over the dragon gate, soaring to the heaven in one leap!

Compared to the Qin Shitian, who was like the noonday sun at this time, the current Ye Yuan seemed much dimmer.

Actually, Ye Yuan had long already reached peak nine wroughts. He was only a step away from ten wroughts.

But he encountered a bottleneck.

Actually, this was also within reason.

What Ye Yuan cultivated was the powerful soul race’s sacred canon, the Divine Emergence.

Furthermore, he broke through too smoothly and too quickly from second wroughts to nine wroughts.

Therefore, the difficulty of stepping into ten wroughts was naturally a hundred times, even a thousand times compared to the others!

One chaos Dao fire after another descended, and the pain and pressure that Ye Yuan endured were also increasing several times over.

The pain of Dao fire refining the soul overwhelmed him to the extent where he wished that he was dead.

When the 21st kind of Dao fire descended, he could not resist giving a muffled groan.

Reached his limit!

Just as Great Emperor Eastsun said, the advantage that he had previously already completely did not exist!

Following that, it was the match between perseverance and potential!

Of course, the pain that Qin Shitian endured was not the slightest bit worse than Ye Yuan.

Although he broke through to nine wroughts, under the superimposition of 21 kinds of chaos Dao fires, nine wroughts did not hold too much advantage.

Hence, the two people fell into a state of extreme danger.

“ARGHH!!”

Inside the Soul Refining Furnace, Qin Shitian was still howling in pain, appearing extremely imposing.

“Why do I feel that Qin Shitian will definitely win this time?”

“I feel so too! Ye Yuan has clearly already exhausted his potential and isn’t able to step into the realm of ten wroughts anymore!”

“Although Qin Shitian is miserable, he’s full of energy! Furthermore, mustering such vigorous perseverance now, he might very likely break through this shackle!”

... ...

At this time, Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian two people’s situation had already completely changed.

Qin Shitian’s great reversal already completely suppressed Ye Yuan.

Four by seven fire, activate!

One Dao fire after another descended one after another.

Inside the Soul Refining Furnace, it became even more brightly colored.

These colors looked great but were extremely dangerous.

Qin Shitian was originally still howling miserably without ceasing. But very soon, he could not howl anymore.

His howls also gradually weakened.

This also showed that the power of the Dao fires inside the Soul Refining Furnace already reached an extremely terrifying level!

However, Qin Shitian still relied on shocking perseverance and pulled through four by seven fires!

This already broke Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall’s record!

Following that, it was five by seven fires!

Once five by seven fires started, Qin Shitian and Ye Yuan let out muffled groans at the same time.

The two people’s soul bodies actually started dissipating!

Their nine wroughts soul bodies actually started to be refined!

Everyone held their breaths, watching these two people’s soul bodies become weak little by little.

“Nihility Dao Fire! Nihility Dao Fire came! Can the two of them pull through?” Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm.

This Nihility Dao Fire was the last Dao fire of the five by seven Dao fires, the 35th kind of Dao fire!

“Arghhh! Break for me! Break for me! I, Qin Shitian, absolutely won’t die here!”

The originally feeble to the extreme Qin Shitian suddenly started to roar crazily.

Following that, a powerful to the extreme undulation came out of the Soul Refining Furnace!

“Ten wroughts! Qin Shitian broke through to ten wroughts! Defying the heavens! Defying the heavens!” This time, the one who cried out in surprise was Great Emperor Eastsun.
