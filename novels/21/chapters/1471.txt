Chapter 1475 The Sharp Edge of a Pretty Boy

Capone Capital City was Eminent Orchid Imperial City’s northern-most capital city, which was also a strategic military city.

The Tiderain City great battle that had just happened, the fiend army set off from here.

“Yo, what a handsome little lad. Go home with Elder Sister tonight.”

“Tsk tsk, this lad is really handsome, making Elder Sister tempted. Handsome guy, enter the city with Elder Sister.”

“Move aside, move aside! You all, these unchaste faded beauties, also want to fight with your mother? Handsome, follow me!”

...

There was a wave of commotion outside Capone Capital City’s city gates. Seven to eight amorous women surrounded a young and handsome youth.

The women all pushed and pulled, all wanting to take this handsome guy for their own.

The fiend race women were completely different from human women. Most of them were very open and uninhibited.

Regarding the matters of men and women, they did not shy from talking about it.

Taking fancy on a guy, they would surround over like bees and butterflies.

The fiend race men were mostly ugly and savage. Hence, when pretty boys occasionally appeared, they would be wildly sought after by these girls.

The man surrounded in the center by these women was simply an outstandingly handsome man compared to other guys, completely not on the same level.

It was just that this guy’s glabella was actually somewhat similar to Ye Yuan.

This person was precisely the Ye Yuan who flew across the natural chasm and sneaked into the fiend race!

The current Ye Yuan’s figure was considerably more robust compared to before. His face also had additional hints of a ruthless and evil air.

He looked rather bloodthirsty.

After Ye Yuan killed Xiu Lie, he found a fiend cultivation method inside his storage ring.

Then, Ye Yuan used the Chaos Heavenspan Canon to operate the fiend cultivation method, and actually converted all of the divine essence in his body into fiend essence.

The Chaos Heavenspan Canon was all-encompassing. It could convert into any form of energy.

This aspect, Ye Yuan had long discovered it.

Ye Yuan discovered that the paste divine essence within his body seemed to be higher-rank than the average person’s divine essence.

As long as he was willing, he could imitate any kind of cultivation method at will.

The current Ye Yuan gave off a fiendish aura from top to bottom. It was no different from ordinary fiends.

Those members of the fiend race completely could not tell that he was actually a human.

But this scene, it aroused quite a few fiend race men’s displeasure.

“Heh, pretty boy, I want to challenge you!” A savage looking fiend man directly stopped Ye Yuan. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Goodness, Lang Ge. You’re a grand completion Two-star Fiend General, but you want to challenge a middle-level Two-star handsome guy, aren’t you shameless?” said a fiend race woman unhappily.

The fiend race’s realm division was the same as the human race. It was just that the terms were somewhat different.

From low to high, they were respectively Fiend Soldier, Fiend General, Fiend Commander, Fiend Lord, Fiend King, Fiend Sovereign, Fiend Empyrean, and the fiend race’s Heavenly Emperor!

Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artists corresponded to Fiend General.

This Lang Ge was a grand completion Two-star Fiend General, which was also grand completion Heaven Glimpse Realm.

Lang Ge glared and said coldly, “Hua Rong, yesterday, you were still saying that I am matchlessly heroic and only like me alone. Now, you actually took fancy on a pretty boy! Your father wants to make him explode with one punch; let you see who’s the hero!”

The fiend race woman said with a wide grin, “Lang Ge, you aren’t going to be like the humans, doing what ‘a day together as husband and wife means endless devotion the rest of your life’, right? Yesterday is yesterday, today is today. Don’t you say so, handsome?”

The moment Lang Ge heard thi, he brimmed even more with jealousy, his face contorting into a wrinkled sheet as he said furiously, “Pretty boy, accept my challenge if you have the balls! What kind of man are you to hide behind a woman? Oh, I get it. You’re not a man at all, but a gigolo, hahaha ...”

“Hahaha!”

“Lang Ge, aren’t you bullying people here? He’s a middle-level Two-star Fiend General. How can he possibly be your match?”

“Yeah, Hua Rong this girl had a momentary spur too. When she gets tired of playing with this pretty boy, she’ll return to your side!”

“Our fiend race’s pretty boys, apart from Lord Ka Xin, they are all pleasant to the eye but useless vases; one touch and they shatter. Lang Ge, take it easy.”

...

The waves of laughter around were all mocking Ye Yuan.

Actually, Ye Yuan did not wish to be such a maverick too. It was just that the fiend race men’s appearances, he seriously could not bear to look at it.

Even if Ye Yuan was at the human race, he could be considered a handsome man too. Right now, this sort of appearance was already the maximum that he could tolerate.

Making him turn into like Lang Ge, he would rather go and die.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s mind stirred.

A group of men and horses were slowly riding into the city. The one in the lead was a cold and proud woman.

Ordinary fiend race women, because of their cultivation methods, were mostly very pretty and amorous. Their looks were also very outstanding.

But that cold and proud woman appeared very different among these mature women.

She was neither as gentle and good-natured as human women nor as licentious and unrestrained like fiend race women. Her beauty was matchless but had a kind of wild beauty.

The moment she appeared, those women next to Ye Yuan immediately paled in comparison.

“It’s Miss Li Ji! Tsk tsk, truly beautiful! If I can approach her, I’d be willing to be a ghost too!” whispered a fiend race man.

Slap!

Everyone only heard a crisp whipping sound. That fiend race man’s head directly exploded like a watermelon. Even his fiend soul was scattered too; he was deader than dead.

“Since you want to be a ghost, then I’ll grant your wish!” Li Ji’s icy-cold voice sounded out.

When everyone saw this scene, they were all silent like cicadas in winter.

Finished talking, Li Ji drove her mounted fierce beast and slowly rode toward the city.

Ye Yuan’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Scram!”

Lang Ge was stunned, only then, realizing that Ye Yuan’s sentence was said to him.

“Heh heh, our pretty boy got angry! I’m not scramming. If you have the capabilities ... accept my challenge! Hahaha ...” Lang Ge said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan said in a cold voice, “Since you’re seeking death, then I’ll grant you your wish!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s body surged with fiendish energy, directly turning into an afterimage, charging over toward Lang Ge.

Lang Ge was originally still snickering. But the moment Ye Yuan moved, his expression could not help changing greatly!

Too fast!

However, Lang Ge was a grand completion Two-star Fiend General at any rate. His strength could not be underestimated.

His gaze turned intent. Raising an iron fist, he smashed over toward Ye Yuan.

Boom!

The two people collided together without any flashiness. Lang Ge’s body directly flew out backward, but Ye Yuan did not budge an inch.

When those few women saw this scene, each and every one of their gazes revealed an astonished look.

They all thought that Ye Yuan was a flower vase. Did not expect that his strength was actually so formidable!

Middle-level Two-star versus high-level Two-star, he actually occupied such a huge advantage!

Lang Ge’s figure had yet to land when Ye Yuan’s figure moved again!

Pfft!

Lang Ge’s head directly exploded; his fiend soul ground into pieces by Ye Yuan’s sword intent.

Under everyone’s astonished gaze, Ye Yuan put away the sword and slowly walked into the city.

Those fiend race women abruptly startled awake, all of their faces revealing incomparably besotted expressions as they swarmed over like bees.

“Goodness, handsome, not only are you good-looking, your strength is actually so formidable too! Truly the prince charming of my dreams!”

“This is a man! Lang Ge that weakling, a pewter spearhead that shines like silver; looks good but useless!”

“Handsome, you’re so strong! Hua Rong really loves you to death, leave with Elder Sister!”
