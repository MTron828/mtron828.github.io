Chapter 1949: Indiscriminately Slaughtering the Innocent!

“No way, can’t continue being stalemated like this. Otherwise, not one of us can leave!”

Lu Xin knew that under this current circumstance, they were unable to succeed at all.

Regardless of whether it was Ye Yuan or this Fourth Firmament True God in front of him, neither one was a pushover.

He had to escape, pass the news back, and let Lord Shadowwind send even stronger powerhouses here.

Thinking up to here, Lu Xin gritted his teeth. His mind stirring, the Traceless Spatial Lock was released quietly.

Whoosh!

Lu Xin’s figure suddenly vanished, shuttling into the void.

A Fourth Firmament True God powerhouses could travel ten thousand miles in an instant, going out of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City in a blink of an eye.

When Bai Tong saw the situation, he only laughed coldly. Taking a step out, he also disappeared.

Over that side, Ye Yuan was extremely sensitive toward spatial law. The instant when the Traceless Spatial Lock was dispelled, he detected it.

Seeing Bai Tong chase after, Ye Yuan said in a clear voice, “Keep him alive!”

“Relax!”

In the void, came Bai Tong’s voice. Then there was no more sound.

And inside the City Lord Manor came Xu Mao four people’s cursing voices.

“Lu Xin, you’ll die a horrible death!”

“Despicable villian who doubled-crossed, you definitely won’t have a good end!”

...

Lu Xin ran without even giving a heads-up undoubtedly made the four of them fall into a desperate situation.

The moment space opened up, Ye Yuan’s figure became even more unpredictable.

Shuttling within the void coupled with the power of the Universe Dragon Claw, his momentum was irresistible.

Even with four people joining hands, they were also suppressed by Ye Yuan until they did not have the slightest strength to retaliate.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Inside the city lord manor, came intense exploding sounds, immediately alarming outside.

Sensing the horrific undulations coming from inside, Ning Tianping’s complexion turned white.

He finally knew what was amiss!

Ye Yuan making him go out was actually in order to protect him.

True God level battles were not what he could take part in at all.

The four people fought incomparably fiercely, fighting all the way from the city lord manor to high up in the sky.

Ye Yuan was akin to a god of war, still brimming with imposing vigor under the encirclement of the four great powerhouses.

This scene naturally landed in the eyes of the martial artists in the city, all incredibly shocked.

“Is my eyesight failing? Those are four Second Firmament True God powerhouses. Lord Ye Yuan can actually fight one-on-four?”

“Lord Ye Yuan seems to have reached the sixth transformation golden body. But would the sixth transformation golden body be so strong?”

“Sixth transformation golden body is just slightly stronger than same rank martial artists. But to say powerful until this kind of extent, it’s clearly impossible.”

“I heard those body cultivators have a type of superlative golden body called the perfect golden body. This is the ultimate state of body cultivating martial artists. Could it be that ... Lord Ye Yuan he reached the perfect golden body?”

...

The martial artists in the city were all speculating. Someone guessed the perfect golden body very quickly, causing each and every one of them being extremely shocked.

Ye Yuan’s Martial Dao cultivation clearly did not reach the True God Realm yet. Then there was only this explanation.

The perfect sixth transformation golden body, this legendary realm, Lord Ye Yuan actually successfully cultivated it!

Everyone looked at that flawless figure, all idolizing immensely.

Except, just what was the deal with these True God powerhouses of unknown origins?

Over there, in the midst of fierce fighting, Xu Mao’s eyes swiveled, suddenly calling out in a clear voice, “Stop attacking him! We’ll split up and massacre the civilians in the city. We’ll see if he can kill the four of us at the same time or not!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, his expression immediately changed drastically.

What he was most worried about was these people making a move on the common people in the city. He did not expect that they really did not have a bottom line, using unscrupulous means in order to achieve their goal.

When the other three people heard that, their eyes could not help lighting up.

They were all beaten silly by Ye Yuan, all just thinking about how to run. It was this Xu Mao’s brain that was agile, to actually think of using this kind of method to coerce Ye Yuan.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

The four people did not hesitate in the slightest, flying out in four different directions.

Although Ye Yuan was skilled in spatial law, he also could not possibly attend to four different directions at the same time.

In his rage, Ye Yuan suddenly slammed a fist out.

Far away, one of the assassins was directly brought down by Ye Yuan!

It was just that even though his figure tottered and he was seriously injured, he still did not die.

A Second Firmament True God martial artist was seriously too strong!

With his current strength, he was utterly devastated one-on-one. But to talk about killing in a single blow, it was clearly not too likely.

In the time it took for this one punch, the other three people already pulled apart distance from Ye Yuan.

They did not plan on all evading in the first place, it just depended on whose luck was good.

Ye Yuan injured one person, but he was unable to injure the other three people at the same time.

“Hahaha! Ye Yuan, I want to see how much time you can use to kill all four of us! Do it!” Xu Mao laughed crazily as he said.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

Three incomparably swift and fierce sword lights tore across the sky, flying straight for the downtown area.

Ye Yuan’s face changed greatly, exhibiting spatial shift without the slightest hesitation.

Bang!

A sword light landed on Ye Yuan, immediately slamming Ye Yuan onto the streets.

But the other two streaks of sword light, Ye Yuan was powerless to salvage the situation.

Bang, bang!

Hundreds and thousands of martial artists turned to ashes under these two streaks of sword light.

Second Firmament True God powerhouses, to ordinary martial artists, those were god-like existences. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In imperial cities, most were some Divine Lord Realm and Origin Deity Realm martial artists. How could they block this kind of terrifying attack?

Places that the sword lights passed through, it became an abyss of suffering!

“Hahaha! Feels great!” Xu Mao burst out laughing.

Another assassin also burst out laughing as he said, “If I knew that this brat was this silly long ago, wouldn’t he have submitted obediently once we randomly captured a few people? Why is there still a need to go through so much trouble?”

In a heap of rubble, Ye Yuan shot up to the sky, gaze turned bloodshot from anger. Both eyes were already blood-red.

This attack did not cause any damage to him, but how could the civilians in the city block such a terrifying attack?

“Again, again!”

Xu Mao laughed loudly, unleashing his sword once more decisively.

“STOP!”

Ye Yuan roared, teleporting once more, and was slammed down once again without the least bit of surprise.

However, at the other two places, there were many martial artists who were killed again. There was no time to even escape.

Inside the city was already a chaotic mess. Places that the sword lights passed through were already heaps of ruins.

“Stop! I’ll go with you!” Ye Yuan roared angrily.

Xu Mao did a hand gesture, indicating for the other two to stop for now.

Ye Yuan flew up once more and came towards Xu Mao.

Xu Mao was long beaten by Ye Yuan until he was terrified. Seeing that Ye Yuan had an aggressive posture, he fell back repeatedly and cried out in alarm, “Stop!”

Ye Yuan was helpless and could only stop. But his pair of eyes were full of iciness.

When Xu Mao saw that Ye Yuan indeed stopped, he could not help becoming pleased with himself again and said with a laugh, “Huhu, Master Ye, your strength is formidable, so don’t get so close to me. I’m scared!”

Ye Yuan looked at him coldly and said in a deep voice, “I’ll go with you guys, don’t attack innocent people anymore!”

Xu Mao had a smug look as he said, “If you were so obedient long ago, wouldn’t they not have needed to die? Heh heh, but ... we don’t trust you, you’re too powerful! Once you go back on your word, we won’t be able to do anything to you.”

Ye Yuan said coldly, “I can seal my vital energy and blood and seal up my divine sea! But you all have to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath to absolutely not go back on your promise afterward and attack the civilians in the city!”

When Xu Mao heard that, the smug look on his face became more apparent.
