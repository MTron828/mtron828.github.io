Chapter 2352: Soaring!

“How ... How is he earning god of war points?! It’s simply snatching!”

Zhang Lian had a look of righteous indignation on his face, feeling that Ye Yuan’s way of operating was very disgraceful.

Amidst the sea of beasts, Ye Yuan relied on his powerful sword formation to kill his way in and out. The outcome was the place being akin to a no man’s land.

Under the intertwining of time law and spatial law, it was very hard for the attacks of these fierce beasts to hurt Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan’s sword formation could cause a fatal blow to these fierce beasts.

Therefore, this scene seemed like a grand sight, but actually, Ye Yuan was as steady as Mount Tai.

But Wan Zhen’s gaze was very solemn, and he said, “Although his realm isn’t high, his strength is too formidable! Being able to control a thousand peak heavenly emperor spirit treasures, his soul force is simply fearsomely powerful! Also, the application of various laws is utterly brilliant too. This guy simply has no weaknesses to exploit!”

Zhang Lian looked toward Wan Zhen in surprise. He did not expect that the proud Wan Zhen actually had such a high appraisal of a person.

But hearing Wan Zhen’s analysis, he also felt that this guy was too monstrous.

Ignoring other things, just controlling a thousand swords, the might of his soul force could be rated as terrifying.

Zhang Lian suddenly gave Wan Zhen a glance, his eye shimmering with water as he said, “At his rate, the two of our positions ... aren’t safe!”

When Wan Zhen heard that, his expression could not help stiffening up.

“Leave!”

Wan Zhen’s expression turned solemn, and he directly left.

Who among these geniuses was not arrogant at heart and haughty in manner? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Even if Ye Yuan’s talent was stronger than theirs, they did not want to lose to Ye Yuan too.

Before this, Wan Zhen two people were still relatively relaxed. Because there was already no one who could pose any threat to them.

But now, when they saw Ye Yuan hunting fierce beasts with such high efficiency, the pressure increased sharply.

After Ye Yuan finished dealing with this wave of fierce beasts, he would get thousands of god of war points no matter what.

... ...

Another year passed in a twinkle. It reached the day where the God of War Golden List was released again. Cloudaid City immediately became lively.

Early in the morning, it was already packed with people in front of Cloudaid City’s central square. Jiang Zhe was shockingly there.

“Jiang Zhe, do you think Ye Yuan that brat will enter the top 2000 this time or not?” Lin Zhan asked Jiang Zhe.

“Heh heh, do you really think that god of war points are cabbages? The higher the rank, the less the god of war points obtained from hunting fierce beasts. He already entered the ranks of 2000 plus. Wanting to obtain a large batch of god of war points again, he’ll have to hunt even more formidable fierce beasts. With his Fourth Firmament Heavenly Emperor strength, heh heh ...” Jiang Zhe said firmly.

“Indeed, just a fool! Originally, he was pretty talented. Why did he have to go and comprehend whatever time law. Now, there are just the last few years left. Then he came out, wanting to compete for it again. How could there be such an easy thing?”

“Yeah. If he succeeds like this, then wouldn’t the Primeval War Realm’s millions of geniuses become a joke?”

There were many people who agreed with Jiang Zhe in the crowd.

After all, Ye Yuan’s way of doing things made many people feel inconceivable. He naturally became the object of ridicule too.

Suddenly, a rift fissured apart in the void. An enormous golden book broke out of thin air.

The book slowly unfolded. Everyone was brimming with expectations.

Very soon, the page of the book revealed the tip of the iceberg. A huge golden name appeared in front of everyone.

First place, Wan Zhen, 3,157,321 god of war points!

Seeing this name, everyone had a look that it was only to be expected.

“Really impressive! One year’s time, Wan Zhen gained tens of thousands of god of war points again!”

“Reaching his ranking, he can still rise several tens of thousands in one year, his strength is really formidable!”

“His position of first place really doesn’t have anyone who can shake it anymore. Zhang Lian won’t cut it either.”

... ...

Although they had already been amazed many times, when they saw Wan Zhen’s ranking and god of war points, everyone still could not resist exclaiming with amazement once more.

For a thousand years, Wan Zhen already became a benchmark, becoming a phenomenon.

From the first time the God of War Golden List was released, Wan Zhen had firmly occupied the first place.

One had to know, the first time that the God of War Golden List was released, Wan Zhen spent several decades’ time to go and comprehend time law.

Later, when the God of War Golden List was released the second time, Wan Zhen already left people far behind in the dust, gradually shaking Zhang Lian off.

Later, the gap between the two became wider and wider.

The pages unfolded again, revealing the second place Zhang Lian.

His god of war points also rose to more than 2.5 million.

Further down, the third place dropped to 1.7 million all of a sudden.

The gap grew wider and wider.

“Li Jin actually dropped out of the top ten! The competition for the top ten is really getting more and more fierce.”

“There’s also Zhu Tian, he’s already squeezed to tenth place, those at the back are hot in pursuit!”

“Eighth place to 15th place, the gap isn’t very big. If anyone breaks through in terms of comprehension, they will probably surpass very quickly!”

... ...

As the pages slowly unfolded, everyone’s discussion became more and more heated.

The golden names of the top ten shone brilliantly and were many sizes larger than the other people’s names.

Further back, there was actually not much viewing value anymore.

Even though there were some fluctuations in ranking, not entering the top ten, everything was futile.

However, there was another name that everyone was very concerned about, which was Ye Yuan.

The last time the God of War Golden List was released, Ye Yuan entered the God of War Golden List for the first time, which already caused a great sensation.

This time, everyone wanted to see whether Ye Yuan’s ranking dropped out, or moved forward again.

After that, the speed at which the pages unfolded slowly increased until it was fanned out in the end.

Everyone habitually searched from behind. But after looking for half a day, they could not find Ye Yuan’s name either.

“Anybody saw Ye Yuan’s name? I already read until 1,500th place from the back and didn’t see it!”

“Most likely fell out of the top 3000, right? Or maybe he already died and we just weren’t aware.”

“I found it! This ... This ...”

“What’s wrong? What place is it?”

“5 ... 553rd place! How is this possible?”

“What?! 500 plus ranking?”

The crowd exploded all at once. Everyone looked in the direction of ranks around 500 and saw that Ye Yuan’s name was surprisingly in the 553rd position!

Promoting 2000 over places in a year?

This was also too freakish, right?

“553rd place, 634,365 god of war points! Hiss ... He obtained 500 thousand god of war points in this one year?”

“This God of War Golden List wouldn’t have made a mistake, right? When the God of War Golden List was released the first time, Wan Zhen used 30 years’ time and only obtained 500 thousand god of war points. Ye Yuan only used one year and achieved it?”

In the crowd, Jiang Zhe was completely dumbfounded.

Over 500 thousand god of war points in one year, this force of explosion was simply like a sledgehammer, stunning his entire person.

He was already prepared to taunt Ye Yuan, but this value of 500 thousand shocked him.

At the rate of this speed, wouldn’t even Wan Zhen’s position be threatened?

In the next eight years, 500 thousand in a year, that was four million god of war points! This was a heaven-defying tempo!

No, wait! The higher his ranking, the lesser the god of war points obtained when hunting fierce beasts.

Now, even Wan Zhen’s speed of getting god of war points had dropped; let alone Ye Yuan?
