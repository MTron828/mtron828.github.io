Chapter 1854: Return in Defeat

“Haha, Little Friend Ye is really a dragon among men. I offended you earlier. Looking on account of Qiuling’s face, I hope that Little Friend Ye doesn’t blame me.”

Leng Hongxiu’s attitude suddenly changed drastically, making Leng Xu stunned too.

Previously, after the battle for young patriarch, Leng Hongxiu was still going to be cavalier with Ye Yuan.

In this twinkle, he was actually so courteous to him.

Even if Ye Yuan displayed his talent, he was just a junior after all. An exalted True God powerhouse actually apologized to a Celestial Deity Realm martial artist. This would make people’s jaws drop too much.

Ye Yuan had a score in his heart and naturally knew what Leng Hongxiu was thinking in his head.

One would not hit a smiling face, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Family Head Leng is too polite. This matter, Ye Yuan had areas where I was wrong too. I hope that Family Head Leng is magnanimous enough to forgive.”

Leng Hongxiu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Not at all, not at all, Little Friend Ye doesn’t know this but Hao-er is considered half a son to me. So I view him in a different light from others, that’s why there was such a misunderstanding.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Family Head Leng is also someone who values sentiments, Ye Yuan understands, Since Leng Xu has no inclinations towards the position of young patriarch, why not Family Head Leng pass the position of young patriarch to Leng Hao?”

Leng Hongxiu had an awkward look when he heard that, thinking to himself that this kid was so formidable.

This move made concessions in order to gain advantages, it was forcing him to clarify his position!

“Huhu, Little Friend must be joking. Leng Hao made a grave mistake. I was just about to order people to throw him into the dungeons as a warning to others. So how can I let him take the position of young patriarch?” Leng Hongxiu smiled and said.

Leng Xu was dumbfounded from watching by the side. Leng Hongxiu’s attitude change was a little too big.

It even made him have an illusion, feeling that Leng Hongxiu was somewhat groveling.

Actually, even though Leng Hongxiu was a True God powerhouse, he was not some fierce and ambitious person who was decisive in going for the kill.

On the contrary, he was a little weak-willed. Otherwise, he also would not be led by the nose by Leng Hao, this kind of junior.

The reason why he could get his position was entirely relying on his daugther, Leng Qiuling.

With such a peerless proud child of heaven in Thousand Soar Mansion, it would not do for the Leng Family to not want to regard him with importance.

But in terms of character, he actually had flaws and was not very suited to hold the position of family head.

At the thought of Ye Yuan’s possible background, Leng Hongxiu put down the proud attitude of a True God Realm, because he was apprehensive of Ye Yuan.

Actually, this could not be blamed on him either. The Heavenspan Mountain was the core location of the entire Heavenspan World.

Factions that controlled the entrances of the Heavenspan Mountain, not one was not an apex force of the Heavenspan World.

Forget about the Leng Family, even the entire imperial capital could not afford to provoke too.

And the talent that Ye Yuan displayed made him even more certain of this idea.

Not just him, even Leng Qiuling, her thoughts right now were also pretty much the same as his.

But this scene landing in Leng Xu’s eyes was totally not the case.

“Huhu, if Little Friend Ye doesn’t mind, just stay in my Leng Family for the time being. You and Leng Xu are on friendly terms, so I believe that you can get along very well. I still have things and won’t keep you company anymore,” Leng Hongxiu smiled and said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Then I’ll impose on Family Head.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

...

At the same time, Han Dongjun knelt in front of the Han Family’s family head, Han Tianyu. Tears and snot were on his face.

“Family Head, you have to stand up for Dongjun! I only have this one son. Now, he was actually killed by someone. That Leng Hongxiu was so impolite, having no respect for you at all!”

Han Tianyu’s brows furrowed. He was not that kind of weak-willed person like Leng Hongxiu, being steered by a few words from Han Dongjun.

The Han Family’s strength was even stronger than the Leng Family’s. This was not unrelated to him, this family head.

After musing for a moment, Han Tianyu said, “Come, we’ll go and demand for the person!”

Han Dongjun’s talent in cultivation could not make it, it was likely difficult for him to step into the True God Realm in this lifetime as well.

But his talent in management was very high. The Han Family’s businesses were mostly managed by Han Dongjun.

Now, Han Dongjun was beaten by someone, it was equivalent to giving the Han Family a slap.

A Han Family’s descendant was killed and the father was even injured by people. If he, this Family Head, did not come forward, it could not be justified no matter what.

In Han Dongjun’s view, the Leng Family was only making him go into action because of a matter of face.

Just a Second Firmament Celestial Deity, it was not worthwhile for the Leng Family to fight to the bitter end with the Han Family.

The moment he went into action, he would definitely be captured with ease.

However, he miscalculated!

Facing Han Tianyu’s demand for the person, Leng Hongxiu said with a fake smile, “Huhu, Brother Tianyu, Ye Yuan is my Leng Family’s distinguished guest. You coming forward to demand for the person like this, it’s probably not appropriate, right?”

Han Dongjun was stunned when he heard that. Before he left, wasn’t Leng Hongxiu still yelling about killing Ye Yuan?

How did Ye Yuan become the Leng Family’s honored guest in a blink of an eye?

Hearing Leng Hongxiu’s words, Han Tianyu’s face fell and he said, “Family Head Leng, it’s probably improper for you to be like this, right? That Ye Yuan killed my Han Family’s descendant. If I don’t finish him off, how will my Han Family still show face to people in the imperial capital in the future?”

Leng Hongxiu just said coolly, “That’s your Han Family’s business. Nothing to do with me. All in all, this Ye Yuan, you can’t touch him!”

Han Tianyu gave a cold snort and said, “If I insist on touching? Could it be that your Leng Family is going to go to war with my Han Family?”

Leng Hongxiu chuckled and said, “Go to war then, is my Leng Family scared of you? Although my elder brother has already passed on, don’t you forget that my Leng Family still has Leng Qiuling!”

Han Tianyu’s face changed, his expression ugly to the extreme.

The Leng family was originally already going downhill. But no one could have expected that in these recent 1000 years, the Leng Family actually produced Leng Qiuling, overpowering the other few major families in the imperial capital.

Leng Qiuling was currently the Thousand Soar Mansion’s treasure. Practically the best resources were piled onto her.

Han Tianyu’s son was much older than Leng Qiuling, but his current strength was also merely more or less the same as Leng Qiuling’s.

If the Han Family and Leng Family really fell out to the point of no return, Thousand Soar Mansion would definitely intervene.

Leng Hongxiu was relying on precisely this that he could tackle the tense situation calmly.

Han Tianyu drew a deep breath, eased up his tone, and said, “Younger Brother Hongxiu, it’s merely a Second Firmament Celestial Deity kid, is there a need to be like this?”

Leng Hongxiu gave him an indifferent glance and said smilingly, “Second Firmament Celestial Deity kid? Heh, Han Tianyu, you’re clever all your life, but stupid this once!”

Han Tianyu was slightly taken aback and said, “What does this mean?”

Leng Hongxiu said, “Even though Han Dongjun is a good-for-nothing, he’s at any rate a half-step True God existence too! I gave him the chance, but he actually couldn’t even capture a Second Firmament Celestial Deity. Do you think that this Second Firmament Celestial Deity would be simple?”

By the side, Han Dongjun was practically about to lose it.

Leng Hongxiu actually scolded him good-for-nothing in front of so many people.

However, Han Tianyu looked over with a rather unfriendly expression, making Han Dongjun’s face change.

He naturally would not say such a humiliating thing for Han Tianyu to hear.

A half-step True God taking action actually could not take care of a Second Firmament Celestial Deity.

Saying good-for-nothing was praising him already.

“Family Head, I ... I ...” Han Dongjun stammered, not knowing what to say.

Smack!

A slap from Han Tianyu immediately slapped Han Dongjun out far away.

Such a piece of important information, this damn fellow actually concealed it and did not report, making him come over to lose face together along with him!

Was Han Dongjun a good-for-nothing?

Of course not!

At least in front of a Second Firmament Celestial Deity, Han Dongjun was absolutely not a good-for-nothing.

Leng Hongxiu’s words had a profound meaning!

“Many thanks for Younger Brother Hongxiu’s warning. Today, it was this Han who was rash.” Han Tianyu clasped his hands and took his leave.
