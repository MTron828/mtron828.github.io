Chapter 2175: Divine Stele Injecting Spirit!

16 pieces!

17 pieces!

... ...

20 pieces!

21 pieces!

In a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan refined six pieces of dragon origin crystals.

The speed of refining caused everyone to be tongue-tied.

More importantly, Ye Yuan’s face did not have much of a painful expression, as if he was just doing something ordinary.

“Sure enough, a perfect seventh transformation is indestructible!”

“This brat’s confidence lies on the perfect seventh transformation, right? But how many can the perfect seventh transformation refine?”

“Our dragon race’s physical bodies, which one isn’t extremely tough? Even if it can’t compare to the perfect seventh transformation, the difference also won’t be too much. He can at most refine 30 pieces, and he’ll reach his limits!”

... ...

All around, heavenly emperors and Sons of the Heavenly Dragon were discussing animatedly.

They felt that the reason why Ye Yuan was a little more formidable than normal people was merely by relying on the perfect seventh transformation. That was all.

However, along with the quantity refined becoming more and more, Ye Yuan’s pain was indeed rising exponentially.

He had refined so many dragon origin crystals and absorbed large quantities of origin dragon energy, but the Heavenly Dragon Mark still did not have any activities.

Rather, it was his cultivation realm that started to slowly climb after absorbing large quantities of dragon origin crystals.

When Ye Yuan absorbed his 30th piece of dragon origin crystal, people’s expression started to slowly change.

“Is this guy a lunatic? He ... Doesn’t he know pain?” Long Seven looked at Ye Yuan’s facial muscles that were twitching slightly as he said through gritted teeth.

Talking about it, someone had once refined 25 pieces of dragon origin crystals before.

But people that were truly able to refine until the 20th piece were extremely, extremely few.

Because towards the back, barely anyone could withstand that agony at all.

But Ye Yuan refined 30 pieces of dragon origin crystals in one go. He actually forcefully endured it and did not even make a sound.

How strong was this fellow’s will?

Around 30 pieces of dragon origin crystals, that was virtually the limit of all dragons!

If not for the muscle twitching slightly on Ye Yuan’s face, they would even suspect that refining dragon origin crystals was not painful at all.

31 pieces!

32 pieces!

... ...

Ye Yuan did not have the slightest intention of stopping, continuing to refine dragon origin crystals.

The expression on everyone’s faces became more and more fascinating.

Fine beads of sweat started seeping out on Ye Yuan’s forehead.

Following the refined dragon origin crystals becoming more and more, the sweat beads became denser and denser, and increasingly larger.

Meanwhile, the twitching of the muscles on his face also became increasingly stronger.

54 pieces!

55 pieces!

... ...

The surrounding crowd’s mouths opened wider and wider until it was practically ear to ear in the end.

This guy was absolutely a lunatic!

The unbroken law that Sons of the Heavenly Dragon were unable to refine above 25 pieces was already broken by Ye Yuan long ago.

Everyone had underestimated Ye Yuan.

They underestimated the might of a perfect seventh transformation and underestimated Ye Yuan’s powerful and persevering will even more.

A perfect seventh transformation, what it promoted was not just the strength of the physical body, there was also the tensile strength of the fleshly body.

Being overly tough was easy to break, but a tough and pliable fleshly body was even more terrifying!

Other people’s fleshly bodies being unable to withstand it did not mean that Ye Yuan was unable to withstand it.

As for this anguish, Ye Yuan had long already experienced it no idea how many times!

This time was merely going through another time!

Morningstar looked at Ye Yuan and said with a slight sigh, “For this child to be able to have such accomplishments, what he relies on isn’t merely talent! Most likely, the hardships that he has experienced, ordinary people can’t imagine it at all!”

Morningstar they all, these old monsters that have lived to an advanced age, were deeply aware of the importance of tribulations to a powerhouse.

These heavenly emperors in front of them, their talents might not be strong, but the hardships that they experienced were not few.

Perhaps back then, there were more brilliantly talented geniuses among their peers.

But those geniuses all faded into the crowd in the end.

While they walked to this supreme position of Heavenly Emperor.

Sons of the Heavenly Dragon being unable to refine more dragon origin crystals, actually, a very large degree was because their will was not strong enough.

This issue totally could not be seen on Ye Yuan.

No matter how strong the will of the Son of the Heavenly Dragon, they also turned pale in comparison when put in front of Ye Yuan.

Over 50 pieces of dragon origin crystal already exceeded their imaginations!

Long Zifeng also smiled bitterly and said, “Not afraid that others are more talented than you, just afraid that people more talented than you are more hardworking than you! Long Seven, your road after today is still long, understand?”

Long Seven’s expression flickered incessantly. Finally, he nodded slowly and said, “Long Seven understands!”

The various Sons of the Heavenly Dragon all revealed pondering looks.

Ye Yuan’s body had the quality that they lacked, which was also the necessary quality to become a powerhouse.

Only Long Yuan’s expression flickered. No idea what he was thinking about.

82 pieces!

83 pieces!

... ...

89 pieces!

Just as everyone was already numbed, Ye Yuan’s glabella suddenly seemed to have caught on fire.

The surging dragon race pressure made everyone present feel heart palpitations! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Morningstar’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Finally awakened! No, wait, this is ...”

He suddenly raised his head to look towards Heavenly Dragon Mountain. Sure enough, a white light beam fell from the sky and landed directly on Ye Yuan’s body.

The Heavenly Dragon Mark at Ye Yuan’s glabella actually turned into one line after another, burrowing into his chest like tiny snakes.

“Divine Stele Injecting Spirit! This boy ...” Morningstar opened his mouth wide, a look of disbelief as he said.

He suddenly felt that he seemed to have done something wrong!

If he was a little more decisive, extending a helping hand when Ye Yuan was fighting with Long Yuan.

Even if Ye Yuan did not need his help, his current attitude would also be vastly different!

Long Xiaochun had a doubtful look and asked in puzzlement, “Divine Stele Injecting Spirit? What is that?”

Morningstar sighed emotionally and said, “The Heavenly Dragon Mark is born from the Dragon Mark Monument sensing dragon race bloodline. When your bloodline reaches the requirement of the Dragon Mark Monument, the Dragon Mark Monument will produce a resonance with your bloodline power, awakening from there. Of course, the requirement that the Dragon Mark Monument has for each awakening is different.”

Morningstar paused for a bit, took a deep breath before saying, “But there is an exception! When your bloodline power is strong to a certain degree, the Dragon Mark Monument will take the initiative to inject a trace of dragon spirit into you, representing acknowledgment toward you! This is Divine Stele Injecting Spirit! And dragons that had obtained Divine Stele Injecting Spirit have a possibility of becoming ... the next Dragon Ancestor!”

Long Xiaochun opened her mouth wide, shock written all over her face.

While the other dragons were all staring dumbfoundedly with their tongues tied, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

Dragon Ancestor, that was the progenitor of all dragons, the strongest dragon race bloodline powerhouse!

All these countless dragons were his descendants.

After each generation of Dragon Ancestor, no idea how many hundreds of millions of years needed to pass before the next Dragon Ancestor would be born.

Because of this, it carried on from generation to generation.

Of course, it was only a possibility. It was not a certainty.

In a period, there would always have several Divine Stele Injecting Spirit appear.

But there was only one that would become Dragon Ancestor in the end!

No one could have thought that after Ye Yuan refined the dragon origin crystals, it would actually produce such an unforeseen turn of events.

At this time, Ye Yuan suddenly snapped open both eyes and gave a cold snort.

A streak of lightning flashed past, the imprint in the Heavenly Dragon Mark was directly wiped away!

“Heh, I knew that there was nothing good! Turns out that it was hiding here!” Ye Yuan slowly stood up and said with a cold smile.
