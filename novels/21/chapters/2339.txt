Chapter 2345: Kindly Accepting

“This sentence, I’ll return it to you as it is! I originally wanted to spare you, but now ... prepare to die!” Ye Yuan replied unceremoniously.

These words immediately drew a wave of loud laughter from the eight great source powerhouses.

A Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor saying this sort of words was really very hilarious in their view.

A middle-aged man in white robes could not help laughing as he said, “Huhu, you think that with a perfect eighth transformation, you can be invincible in this Primeval War Realm? Boy, you’re still too inexperienced!”

Earth Duck said, “Young Friend Ye, in a while, we’ll hold these guys back. You go first! They are all source powerhouses. You’re not their match by yourself!”

“If I want to leave, just the likes of them can’t hold me back still. If I want to stay, none of them can leave!” Ye Yuan looked at Jiang Zhe, his tone exuding domineeringness.

It was just that this declaration sounded like childish words to the eight great source powerhouses.

Perfect eighth transformation, was it very impressive?

Jiang Zhe said to the white-robed male, “Lin Zhan, this brat will be handed to you! Regroup with us after killing him. These two old freaks’ source laws are rather formidable. They are not easy to deal with.”

Lin Zhan nodded his head and said, “Relax, I’ll dispose of him within three moves!”

Jiang Zhe nodded and said, “Attack together! This time, we must make these two old fellows pay the price!”

The seven great source powerhouses’ powers of law were released fully. One astonishing law undulation after another instantly reverberated inside Sun Moon Canyon.

Even Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck two people also felt tremendous pressure.

“Young Friend Ye, don’t put up a bold front anymore! Find a chance and quickly escape! You don’t need to care about us!” Earth Duck said with concern.

She knew Ye Yuan’s strength, dealing with one source powerhouse was not an issue.

But if Ye Yuan did not leave and attract even more source powerhouses, that would not be good.

In the beginning, Ye Yuan was still slightly critical of this strange husband and wife pair. But after listening to their tragic experience, Ye Yuan could not hate them anymore as well.

That pain of losing a loved one, he felt deeply affected by it.

The things that this husband and wife two people had suffered at that time, he could understand fully.

Furthermore, this Earth Duck was genuinely concerned about him.

“Heh heh, you guys had better worry about yourselves!” Jiang Zhe said with a cold laugh.

Seven great source powerhouses attacking at the same time, the commotion was extremely shocking.

Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck cried strangely over and over again, letting out all kinds of sound martial techniques to deal with the seven people.

Ye Yuan could tell that these two still appeared rather strained under the pincer attacks of the seven people.

However, sound law was also an extremely high-level law. Coupled with these two people’s tacit understanding and cooperation, their strength far surpassed those in the same rank.

For some time, they were actually able to barely ward them off.

“Brat, stop looking, this Heavenly Emperor will send you back to the city right now! This level of battle isn’t what you can take part in!” Lin Zhan looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smug look.

“Immobilize!”

Lin Zhan’s voice had yet to fade, only to see Ye Yuan nonchalantly spit a word out of his mouth.

Heavenly Dao suddenly descended, locking Lin Zhan firmly.

His gaze was incomparably shocked, wanting to speak, but was completely unable to move.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh ...

The sword formation suddenly arose, rushing over towards Lin Zhan.

In a breath, Lin Zhan was diced into pieces.

His source power had yet to be put to good use, and he was already slain by Ye Yuan.

Unimaginably fast!

“Since you’re in such a hurry to go back to the city, then this Ye will give you a ride then.” Ye Yuan said coolly, but sadly, Lin Zhan already could not hear it anymore.

Many runes entered Ye Yuan’s body, Ye Yuan felt that his god of war points suddenly increased by more than 2000.

Source powerhouses were indeed different, their god of war points was also very abundant!

Lin Zhan could not hear it, but those powerhouses fighting over there felt this terrifying Heavenly Dao undulation already.

“Heavenly Dao True Word! This kid actually knows Heavenly Dao True Word!”

“What he mobilized should be time law! To be able to mobilize a Heavenly Dao True Word that’s of the two great supreme laws, too terrifying!”

“Also, that sword formation! Two great powers of source! My god, just what kind of freak is this kid?”

... ...

Not just Jiang Zhe they all, Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck two people were also astounded.

They thought that the sword formation was already Ye Yuan’s final trump card. Did not expect that Ye Yuan actually still had such a heaven-defying ace-in-the-hole that was not used.

If Ye Yuan flashed this trump card, killing the two of them husband and wife just now would be effortless!

After Ye Yuan killed Lin Zhang, he slowly walked over to this side and said coolly, “I originally came here to train, but there are always some people who feel that they have too many god of war points and insist on sending me some. Since that’s the case, this Ye will kindly accept it!”

Not waiting for Jiang Zhe and the rest to react either, the moment Ye Yuan’s sword formation rose, he joined right in the battle.

Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck’s combat power was actually higher than these source powerhouses. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ye Yuan was able to fight to a draw with Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck, but his strength was actually much stronger than them individually.

“Immobilize!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, directly using Time Freeze, immobilizing Jiang Zhe firmly there.

Jiang Zhe was long prepared, the source power in his body surging wildly, attempting to break through Time Freeze.

Additionally, another three people saw that the situation was not good, and rushed right at Ye Yuan, attempting to stop him.

Ye Yuan’s sword formation revolved crazily, hurting one of them in a blink of an eye!

With the combination of two great powers of source, Ye Yuan’s combat power was much stronger than ordinary source powerhouses.

The only thing that he was at a disadvantage in was cultivation realm.

In the fight with Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck previously, he did not use his full strength either.

At this time, he was truly enraged and went all out, hurting one of the source powerhouses in a twinkle.

Under Jiang Zhe’s frenzied assault, Time Freeze was finally burst through.

But he also broke out in cold sweat from shock.

This move was really impossible to guard against!

Unless one’s strength reached the Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor Realm, otherwise, there was no way to fight with this kid at all!

With Ye Yuan joining the battle, the situation on both sides suddenly turned around.

The seven people diverted more than half of their power to deal with Ye Yuan, while the other three also started struggling in straitened circumstances under the teaming up of Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck.

Originally, the eight people came in a threatening manner. At this time, they were actually devastated until their helmets and coats of mail were lost.

Ye Yuan fought four people by himself, even firmly suppressing his opponents in terms of momentum.

At that time, Ye Yuan fought more than 20 divine race powerhouses alone in Cloudheart Realm!

The formidable aspect of the sword formation was this!

When in a group battle, the power of the sword formation could be amplified infinitely.

In terms of strength, the strengths of source powerhouses were much stronger than those abyss monsters.

But no matter how strong, it also would not be stronger than those 20 people.

Now, Ye Yuan exchanged for 12 peak heavenly emperor spirit treasures and 48 initial-rank heavenly emperor spirit treasures, the power of the sword formation was more than a level stronger than back then.

Therefore, there was more than enough to spare for him to deal with these people.

The more Jiang Zhe and the others fought, the more alarmed they got. Originally, when this Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor was standing here, they thought that he was just a rookie.

Who knew that this kid was actually even stronger than Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck teaming up!

They kicked an iron plate!

“Leave!”

Jiang Zhe saw that the situation was not good and immediately retreated.

The others saw the outcome too and fled one after another.

If a source powerhouse wanted to leave, nobody could keep them behind.

However, Ye Yuan just smiled coldly, his figure immediately melting into the void.

“Immobilize!”

Jiang Zhe’s figure suddenly froze in the void.
