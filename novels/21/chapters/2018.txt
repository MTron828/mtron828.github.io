Chapter 2022: It’s You All Challenging Her!

Luo Ye’s eyes lit up and he asked, “But what?”

But Ye Yuan’s gaze turned to Ning Siyu and the other people’s gazes followed his gaze and also landed on Ning Siyu.

Smart people already guessed Ye Yuan’s intention and could not help getting a big shock.

Sure enough, it was only to hear Ye Yuan slowly saying, “You have to beat her first.”

Ning Siyu looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief and used her finger to point at herself as she said, “M-Me?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Right, it’s you!”

Ning Siyu jumped up like a rabbit that got a scare and repeatedly waved her hands and said, “No way, no way! Your Excellency, I can’t do it! I ... I will lose face for you!”

Ning Siyu was filled with confidence in Ye Yuan, but her confidence in herself was not that strong.

In Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, although she was already an apex existence, what kind of place was this?

This place was Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital, it was the Cloudpill Summit, the holy land in the hearts of all of the Southern Border’s alchemists.

These geniuses in front of her, they all came from influential alchemy clans and ancient families. The might of their strength was top-notch among the entire Southern Border’s young generation.

What did she count for compared to these people?

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was ultimately just a small place!

This feeling of inferiority filled Ning Siyu’s body and heart.

Let alone that these people in front of her were all Six-star Alchemy Gods, while she was merely a Five-star Alchemy God.

This kind of challenge that crossed realms, the pressure was enormous.

Not everyone was Lord Ye Yuan.

When Luo Yue and the rest saw Ning Siyu’s reaction, they could not help being amused.

“She ... Grandmaster Ye is making her challenge us? Hahaha ... we’re all Six-star Alchemy Gods. Is there a mistake?” Luo Yue said with a loud laugh.

“Hahaha!”

The surroundings guffawed with laughter, clearly finding Ye Yuan’s way of doing things very funny.

Ning Siyu’s appearance did not look like an alchemy expert no matter how one looked at her.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and shook his head as he said, “It’s not her challenging you, it’s you challenging her.”

Luo Yue opened his eyes wide and said in disbelief, “Me? Challenging her? Got to be joking! What qualifications does a mere Five-star Alchemy God have to make me challenge her?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’ll naturally know after competing. You all, each one counts as one. As long as you succeed in defeating her, you’ll have the qualifications to issue a challenge to me.”

Everyone’s faces revealed looks of amusement. This kid was not a fool, right?

This kind of person actually had a grandmaster token in his hands. This was an insult to the grandmaster token!

“Okay, this is what you said yourself!” Luo Yue said with a sneer.

Ning Siyu winked at Ye Yuan repeatedly and whispered, “Ye Yuan, I can’t do it. I really can’t!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and he said, “Following me for so many years, if you can’t even win them, then don’t return to Heavenly Eagle anymore.”

Ning Siyu’s face changed, she knew that Ye Yuan was serious.

If His Excellency really did not let her return to Heavenly Eagle, what should she do?

“Your Excellency, I ... I got it!” Ning Siyu said like an aggrieved little wifey.

Saying finish, she gritted her teeth and said to Luo Yue, “Which of you will come first?”

Luo Yue laughed loudly and said, “Little girlie, do you really take yourself to be a grandmaster? Do you know who we are?”

Ning Siyu’s face fell and she said, “Whoever you are, I absolutely won’t lose to you! Otherwise, His Excellency won’t let me return to Heavenly Eagle anymore!”

Seeing Ning Siyu’s appearance, Ye Yuan also secretly found it funny.

Even if Ning Siyu really lost, he also would not forbid her from returning to Heavenly Eagle.

It was just that this lass was too lacking in confidence in herself. Not applying some pressure on her, it would likely be hard for her to unleash her full strength.

Following Ye Yuan these few years, her strength advanced by leaps and bounds. Ye Yuan naturally had a score in his heart.

Ordinary so-called geniuses were not her match at all.

Luo Yue laughed when he heard that and said, “Then you definitely can’t go back anymore. Because in a while, you’ll lose until you doubt life! Hahaha!”

The group of people stared at Ning Siyu like a bunch of gray wolves staring at a little rabbit, showing an appearance of cornering it.

“Sigh, it’s also hard on this girlie, to have actually followed such an unreliable master.”

“These alchemy geniuses are all distinguished talents of the young generation. How could a mere Five-star Alchemy God be a match?”

“This lass is really pitiable. I reckon that she can’t even win one match!”

...

The onlooking crowd in the marketplace were all using pitying gazes to look at Ning Siyu and also using jeering gazes to look at Ye Yuan.

This grandmaster was seriously fooling around too much!

It was fine that he was trash, he even had to push his maidservant into the fire pit.

Ning Siyu said coldly, “Talk again after winning me!”

Luo Yue smiled and said, “Fine then. Du Ruofei, you play with her first!”

A young man in exquisite clothing stepped out of the ranks. His gaze when looking at Ning Siyu was full of relishing as if victory was already within grasp.

“Heh, little girl, this young master is here to challenge you. You have to show leniency!” Du Ruofei

...

At this time, inside a restaurant outside of the eastern-street marketplace, Yun YI, Zheng Buqun, and the rest were shockingly present.

Listening entirely to a manservant’s report, Yun Yi shook his head and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “This Grandmaster Ye is probably at the end of his ropes, right? To actually make his own little maid challenge the Cloudpill Summit’s geniuses?”

Zheng Buqun scoffed and said, “Brother Yun Yi’s words are not correct. Didn’t you hear what that manservant said? It’s the Cloudpill Summit’s geniuses challenging the little maid!”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Finished saying, there was immediately loud laughter inside the box room.

Yun Yi shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “I originally thought that this kid had some capabilities, but I didn’t expect that he’s so unreliable. Although Luo Yue they all aren’t the top geniuses of this summit, they are also sufficient to rank into the top 100. How can they be what a mere rank five little maid can deal with?”

Zheng Buqun smiled and said, “Brother Yun Yi really has nice means, slightly revealing Ye Yuan’s whereabouts to everyone, to make our Grandmaster Ye reveal his true colors! I’m very curious now how this Grandmaster Ye plans on cleaning up the mess.”

Yun Yi waved his hand and said smilingly, “Isn’t this minor thing still easily resolvable to me? Let’s drink first, I reckon that there will be news coming over very soon. Although Du Ruofei’s strength isn’t much, it shouldn’t take too long to deal with a mere Five-star Alchemy God little girl.”

Finished talking, Yun Yi and the rest clanged wine cups and wine flowed freely, extremely cheerful.

In a twinkle, four hours passed. The few people were currently chatting away idly when that manservant suddenly barged inside.

Yun Yi’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “Where’s your sense of decorum being in such a fluster?”

The manservant jumped in fright and hurriedly knelt down and said, “Young Master, forgive my mistake!”

Yun Yi had his mind on Du Ruofei and Ning Siyu’s alchemy battle. Waving his hand dismissively, he said, “How is it? Is the result out?”

The manservant hurriedly said, “It’s out! Young Master Du Ruofei returned in utter defeat! The entire eastern-street marketplace is in an uproar!”

“What? Du Ruofei lost? This ... How is this possible?” Yun Yi said with a face full of disbelief.

“Are you mistaken? Du Ruofei’s alchemy strength already reached the late-stage Initial Realm. He would actually lose to a Five-star Alchemy God little lass?” Zheng Buqun’s face similarly had a look of astonishment.

The manservant hurriedly said, “Won’t be wrong! This lowly one was in the crowd and saw it clearly! That young lady’s momentum was overpowering, suppressing Young Master Du Ruofei all the way, finally refining a superior-grade medicinal pill!”

Yun Yi and the rest looked at each other as if they had seen a ghost.
