Chapter 2658: Battling Dragon Girl

“You’re from the Thistle South Royal Clan?” Ye Yuan looked at the six or seven-year-old little girl in front of him and asked with a frown.

The little girl was captivating and cute, like a porcelain doll, delighting people when they saw her.

There was a pair of horns on top of her head, showing her identity as a member of the Thistle South Royal Clan.

Ye Yuan already knew that this Thistle South Royal Clan was actually a flood dragon lineage.

A flood dragon was merely a low-level dragon race. Its bloodline was far from that of the true dragon race.

But Ye Yuan could feel that the bloodline of this little girl in front of him was extremely strong.

“You’re so lame, is there still a need to ask such an obvious thing?” The little girl said.

Ye Yuan was taken aback and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Alright, looking at your appearance, you’ve been hiding in the Emerald Sea Divine Conch all along?”

Ye Yuan also did not expect that this Emerald Sea Divine Conch actually formed its own space and a member of the dragon race actually hid inside.

However, this treasure had always been in Huang Haoyan’s hands. Ye Yuan did not probe it carefully either.

This little girl was mischievous and had a sly look as she said, “Yeah, when that beautiful big sister entered the merfolk tribe, I knew that the chance came. Hence, I hid in the Emerald Sea Divine Conch and entered the Treasure Depository Pavilion. And then I was brought out by her.”

Ye Yuan was dumbstruck with amazement from listening, looking at the little girl in shock.

Heavenly South and Thistle South almost underwent a horrifying war, it was actually just because of this little girl’s prank?

Feeling the unfriendly look in Ye Yuan’s eyes, the little girl was indifferent as she said with a grin, “Big Brother, don’t look at me with this sort of eyes. I’m scared.”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Scared??Huhu,?do you know that your prank almost plunged hundreds of millions of lives into misery and suffering?”

If not for Ye Yuan coming to Heavenly South in an accident arising from many causes, the land of nine cities would probably have already been razed to the ground.

He was unable to tolerate this degree of prank.

The little girl said without the least bit of care, “What does that have to do with me?”

Ye Yuan frowned slightly and said in a solemn voice, “Then why did you show yourself now?”

The little girl smiled and said,?“Uh,?no reason. I’m just telling you that I’m leaving.”

“Leaving? Where are you going?” Ye Yuan frowned and asked.

The little girl reached her hand out and beckoned. The Emerald Sea Divine Conch was hidden between her brows.

“Of course, I’m going out for a stroll! I’ve long been yearning for the land and really wanted to go out and take a look. I’m going, bye bye!”

Finished saying, the little girl took a step out and directly concealed into the void.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and suddenly pointed a finger out.

“Ouch!”

The little girl felt pain and was actually directly forced out.

She looked at Ye Yuan with a look of annoyance and said, “Hey, why are you bullying me?”

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “Your Thistle South Royal Clan launched a sea war for the Emerald Sea Divine Conch. Did you know that?”

The little girl said with annoyance, “What has that got to do with me?”

Ye Yuan frowned slightly and said in a solemn voice, “If you want to go, sure. Leave behind the Emerald Sea Divine Conch!”

The girl snorted lightly and said, “Based on what?”

Ye Yuan’s patience was worn out too and he said with decisiveness that could chop iron, “Not based on anything!”

“Humph!?You’re merely a puny little Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, that’s all. Do you really think that I’m scared of you?”

The little girl had a black face, and she formed a spell with her hands.

Immediately, the inside of the entire secret chamber was completely filled with water.

Ye Yuan only felt that the surrounding heaven and earth spiritual energy was completely isolated.

Along with that, he felt that his movements, his thinking, even the circulation of the divine essence within his body, all had become slow.

The moment she attacked, this little girl was actually a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven.

Furthermore, her application of water rule had almost reached the penultimate.

The little girl said smugly,?“Humph,?can’t move anymore, right? To dare make a move against this young lady, looking for a rebuff!”

“Is that so? Break for me!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, eight streaks of sword light suddenly bloomed.

The powerful sword lights burst forth and actually directly blasted the water curtain apart.

The little girl jumped in fright and said in shock, “How is this possible? Even if it’s a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, they can’t break free from my water domain space too! You actually did it?”

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “Originally, seeing that you were a little girl, I didn’t want to stoop to your level. Looking at it now, you’re really impervious to reason!”

This girlie was completely unreasonable.

Having caused this massive problem, she actually wanted to walk away from it. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

If he was still a middle Greater Sublime Heaven, he would really have to expend some effort to deal with this girl.

But now, he already reached grand completion Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum. With his law attainments, how could he fear a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven?

Even though this little girl was indeed formidable.

“Humph!?Just the likes of you?”

That little girl gave a cold snort, her hands forming a spell again. A water dragon condensed and emerged.

When this water dragon appeared, it was akin to a living thing, carrying a pressure that stirred the soul.

Great Dao Transformation!

Bang!

How could the secret chamber withstand this kind of pressure? It directly collapsed.

The powerhouses in the city were instantly startled and rushed over one after another.

“What happened? Who’s that little girl?”

“Thistle South Royal Clan! Great Dao Transformation! This little girl’s strength is so strong! Probably even Dragon Son Huining can’t compare to her too! When did such a monster appear in the Thistle South Royal Clan?”

“That little girl is formidable, but isn’t Master Ye more formidable? In a short ten days, he actually broke through two minor realms consecutively! Furthermore, he suppressed that water dragon completely, showing the might of his strength!”

… …

Those city lords were all extremely shocked.

Ye Yuan only broke through for ten days and actually directly reached grand completion Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

This cultivation speed was a little too terrifying.

What was even more surprising was that Ye Yuan’s combat strength could already confront a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum head-on!

One had to know, this little girl herself was an existence who could jump realms and battle!

At this time, Ye Yuan’s eight transformed swords erupted with rays of brilliant light in the void, ravaging the water dragon full of injuries.

The little girl’s complexion turned paler.

She never paid attention to Ye Yuan at all before. Ye Yuan was merely an ant-like existence in her eyes.

Who would have expected that the ant in her eyes actually forced her into a fluster?

In the royal clan, she was invincible in the same rank!

Even her elder brother, Dragon Son Huining, was not her match either.

Now, she was actually forced into such a state by a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

“Humph!?Stinking big brother, bad big brother, you forced me!”

The little girl’s glabella lit up, and the Emerald Sea Divine Conch appeared.

A terrifying power instantly enveloped the entire city.

The light halo spread out, shrouding onto the water dragon.

That water dragon that was covered all over with wounds and scars actually recovered fully in an instant!

Furthermore, its body became much more solid, its power rising to a new high compared to before.

“Roar!”

The water dragon opened its mouth and countless water arrows gushed out, flying straight for Ye Yuan.

When everyone saw this scene, they were all greatly shocked.

No one expected that that mysterious Emerald Sea Divine Conch actually became so powerful in this little girl’s hands.

The power of the water dragon increased several times all at once!

Under these water arrows, even if it’s a middle Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, they would probably have to die with regrets too!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned dark and he said with a cold snort, “Sword of Great Dao, chop!”

Above the void, eight sword lights suddenly merged into one.

An astonishing sword intent chopped down towards the water dragon under Ye Yuan’s control.

At the same time, Ye Yuan brought out the Heavenspan Mountain and placed it in front of him.

Those countless water arrows were unable to pierce through the Heavenspan Mountain at all.

Swish!

Under the sword, the water dragon was directly severed into two!
