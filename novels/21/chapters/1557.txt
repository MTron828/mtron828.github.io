Chapter 1561 Above Divine-grade!

“Heh, surpassing divine-grade, you really dare to say it! I want to see how you surpass divine-grade!” Eldest Senior Brother said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then you open your eyes wide and take a good look at it.”

When Ye Yuan started refining pills, even Xuan Yu showed a hint of a solemn look too, staring at him without moving his gaze.

Ever since learning that a Dao Realm expert appeared in the city, Xuan Yu could not fall asleep at night, very much wanting to witness the bearing of an expert.

Today, he finally got his wish.

The moment the divine fire rose up, the aura of Great Dao filled the entire medicine refining room.

The faces of the four apprentice brothers changed, their faces revealing a look of surprise.

This kind of might was what even their master could not achieve.

The refining difficulty of the Silvermoon Pointstar Pill was at most considered elementary to Ye Yuan and did not take much effort.

When refining, he had it at the tips of his fingers.

After two hours, amidst everyone’s dumbfounded gazes, Ye Yuan finished refining.

Xuan Yu furrowed his brows, appearing rather puzzled.

While the four apprentice brothers were shocked to the core. Putting aside realm, Ye Yuan’s standard of refining rank three divine pills were absolutely not below Master’s!

Just this point shook them off several streets behind.

Although Eldest Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother were Four-star Alchemy Gods too, refining rank three divine pills still fell short of reaching this degree of having it at the fingertips.

What amazed them the most was that Ye Yuan was just an initial-stage Origin Deity. After finished refining the medicinal pill, his divine essence did not show the slightest sign of being deficient.

Face not red, heart not pumping, just like he played around only for a while.

“How is it, Eldest Senior Brother? Convinced or not?” Ning Siyu’s voice suddenly sounded out by his ear, making Eldest Senior Brother jump in fright.

Eldest Senior Brother snorted coldly and said, “Have some strength, but ... definitely did not surpass Master’s divine-grade! In my view, whether or not this Silvermoon Pointstar Pill can reach divine-grade is enough to sputter!”

Ning Siyu smiled and said, “Relax, Master Ye refining Silvermoon Pointstar Pill, it’s impossible to not be divine-grade!”

When refining the Gale Celestial Stone Pill, Ning Siyu had witnessed before Ye Yuan’s Chaos Heavenly Star Art.

She knew that Ye Yuan did not go all out at all.

She even knew that Ye Yuan’s true strength was likely when refining the Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill!

The refinement that time, even she did not see it!

Ning Siyu was very much looking forward to it, not knowing whether Master could force out all of Ye Yuan’s strength today or not.

Since Ye Yuan did not bring out his true strength, he was must be very confident in his refinement.

However, Eldest Senior Brother was very disdainful as he said, “Tsk! Do you think that divine-grade medicinal pills are all cabbages? Even if he can refine divine-grade divine pills, it’s also not possible to surpass Master!”

“Is that so?”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, his palm shaking. The medicinal pill flew out of the medicinal cauldron.

Everyone’s gaze landed on that little medicinal pill, their gazes involuntarily turning intent.

This Silvermoon Pointstar Pill was shockingly divine-grade too!

“Hehe, like I said, it’s impossible for Master Ye to not be divine-grade!” Ning Siyu smiled and said.

Eldest Senior Brother pursed his mouth and said, “Although this medicinal pill is divine-grade too, it’s at most on par with Master’s. It’s still him who lost!”

Xuan Yu rolled his eyes at him and said huffily, “Little punk, don’t shoot your mouth off! This round, it’s Master who lost! Master Ye’s Silvermoon Pointstar Pill is already infinitely close to ethereal divine-grade.”

Eldest Senior Brother’s gaze turned intent and he said in disbelief, “Master, you aren’t joking, right? There’s ... There’s really someone capable of refining divine-grade medicinal pills to ethereal divine-grade?”

Xuan Yu snorted coldly and said, “Otherwise, why do you think Master called the few of you over?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Divine-grade was not the end.

Amidst divine-grade, it was even divided into five major realms!

Purple spirit divine-grade, void spirit divine-grade, vast spirit divine-grade, end spirit divine-grade, as well as the legendary spiritlink divine-grade!

This was the same as refining metals. Alchemists were never able to excavate 100% of the spirit medicines’ medicinal effects.

The higher the quality of the medicinal pill, the higher the purity.

These five stages, each increase in level, the medicinal effects of the medicinal pills would increase several times!

Divine-grade medicinal pills were actually because the purity reached a certain tipping point.

This limit stumped countless alchemists.

But above this limit, there was still room for improvement.

It was just that to be able to have improvements above divine-grade again, it was basically exceedingly rare.

With Eldest Senior Brother’s level, refining not too difficult Three-star divine pills, if he got lucky, it could refine divine-grade too. But that was just the most ordinary purple spirit divine-grade.

As for void spirit divine-grade, Eldest Senior Brother basically never thought about it before.

Even if he refined rank two divine pills, rank one divine pills, he could not refine void spirit divine-grade medicinal pills too.

However, Ye Yuan refining a Three-star divine pill actually infinitely approached void spirit divine pill! This was too inconceivable!

Xuan Yu put the two medicinal pills together and said to the four apprentice brothers, “You all see it by yourselves, what’s the difference between these two medicinal pills!”

Eldest Senior Brother’s gaze sharpened and he exclaimed, “It ... It’s really much clearer than your medicinal pill! It’s a shame, just a little bit more and you can refine a void spirit divine-grade divine pill!”

Eldest Senior Brother had his interest aroused and was itching to have a go too, forgetting the bet for a moment, and could not help lamenting.

Void spirit divine-grade, that was a legendary grade!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Master Xuan Yu, let’s go on to the next round then!”

Xuan Yu nodded and said, “Let’s start. This time, I’ll go first still!”

The four apprentice brothers came back to their senses. Eldest Senior Brother pursed his mouth and said, “The medicinal pills at the back will definitely get harder and harder. I don’t believe that he can overpower Master in every kind of medicinal pill! This kowtow, he’s prostrating for sure!”

But along with the passing of time, they became more and more shocked.

Ye Yuan’s performance was frighteningly stable.

In the wake of the refining difficulty of the medicinal pills becoming harder and harder, when Xuan Yu reached the third round, he was already unable to refine divine-grade divine pills.

But Ye Yuan’s were still divine-grade!

“This ... This doesn’t conform to common sense! The greater the difficulty of the medicinal pill, the harder to refine high-grade medicinal pills. But why can he keep on refining?” Eldest Senior Brother said in shock.

“Yeah! How in the world did this guy do it? Is he still human?!” Second Senior Brother Ding Xun also exclaimed.

“It can only be said that his strength towers far above these medicinal pills, so that he can perform so stably! Except, what kind of realm did he reach?” Third Senior Brother said with an emotional sigh.

Ye Yuan’s pill refinement subverted their understanding of alchemy. It was simply powerful until it made people despair.

They never dared to imagine that refining divine-grade divine pills were as simple as eating and drink!

Very soon, the fifth round ended. Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill came out of the furnace.

Still divine-grade!

Xuan Yu’s gaze finally became solemn. He finally knew that Ye Yuan did not go all out in the first round at all.

If he used all his power, refining void spirit divine-grade was absolutely no problem!

The strength of Dao Realm was too terrifying!

Boom!

Everyone was currently immersed in shock when a loud noise suddenly came from outside.

“Ye Yuan, get out here and die for this old man! Also, that Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, you actually dare to intervene in the affairs of the outer city. Now, the Martial Tower has already sent people over to capture you, hurry up and come out to be executed!”

Outside, Wu Feng’s yell sounded out.

A bunch of infatuated people were currently battling in alchemy until they were enthralled but was interrupted by this cry. How annoying!
