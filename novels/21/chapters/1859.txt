Chapter 1863: Vice Fire

In front of their eyes was a boundless desert. Under the blazing sun, the entire world was akin to a heating stove.

Entering the Door of Vermilion Bird, it was quite a scene.

“This damn place, can’t see the end at a glance. Where can we even find the Vermilion Bird true blood?”

“Most likely, it’s deep in the desert. Don’t delay anymore. Keep delaying and others will beat us to it!”

Upon hearing this, the crowd poured towards the depths of the desert-like tidewater.

“Ye Yuan, let’s set off too,” Leng Qiuling said.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “More haste, less speed. It’s already so dangerous outside, so why would this desert not be dangerous at all?”

Leng Qiuling’s face changed. In this boundless desert, she could not feel the slightest danger.

It seemed that apart from being a little hot, there was nothing peculiar.

“This ... Then what should we do?”

Ye Yuan said, “You cultivate an ice-attribute cultivation method. So revolve your cultivation method and you’ll naturally be safe.”

Leng Qiuling was not quite certain what it meant, but she still followed Ye Yuan’s instructions and did it.

On Leng Qiuling’s body, cold air gradually grew. Her entire person seemed to be a lot colder too.

After doing this, the two walked toward the depths of the desert unhurriedly.

“Heh, these two people are really doing unnecessary things, this place has no danger at all and they actually started revolving divine essence. When they really encounter danger, see what they use to face the enemy.”

Seeing the divine essence on Leng Qiuling’s body, a series of mocking sounds immediately came over.

In everyone’s view, this kind of action was undoubtedly very foolish.

Constantly revolving one’s cultivation method would continue depleting the divine essence within the body. Once encountering a battle, one would not be able to deal with the enemy at their peak state.

“ARGHH!!”

Right at this time, a scream suddenly came from the crowd ahead. Then, his entire person caught on fire.

Everyone’s face changed, immediately retreating far away from that person.

Very soon, that person on fire burned into nothingness, like he evaporated into thin air.

Everyone’s faces changed one after another, not understanding what happened.

He was perfectly fine, why did he suddenly catch on fire?

Someone said in a panic, “This ... What happened?”

Just as everyone was anxious and doubtful, several more people right at the front suddenly caught on fire, then burned into nothingness.

At this time, everyone finally knew that this was not some incidental event.

Inside this desert, concealed dangers that they did not know.

“E-Everybody be careful! This fire is too formidable!”

“How the hell did that person burst into flames?”

“I ... I’m not playing anymore! I want to leave this place!”

...

Several clusters of flames made everyone immediately become alert.

Some people were even clamoring about wanting to leave.

But they barely walked two steps when a cluster of flames shot straight out, burning them into nothingness.

The group of powerhouses was dumbfounded with shock, completely unaware of what was going on.

Leng Qiuling looked at Ye Yuan rather amazedly. She felt that Ye Yuan making her revolve her cultivation method was likely in order to ward off this flame.

But what in the world was this?

Those powerhouses all did not dare to advance deep in anymore.

But there was no use at all, there were still many people who were directly burned away by the flames.

This way, Ye Yuan two people who were originally advancing slowly walked to the front ranks of the crowd instead.

The two of their abnormal states immediately attracted quite a number of people’s attention.

“Why are the two of them fine?”

“Eh, the two of them have been constantly revolving their cultivation methods since entering this space! Previously, we were still mocking them all along, could it be that there’s something fishy going on?”

“I understand! This ... This is vice fire[1]!”

The one who spoke was a True God powerhouse.

Mentioning the name vice fire, that True God powerhouse’s own expression also changed drastically, and was in a state of disbelief for a while.

Not just him, the other people’s faces similarly changed dramatically.

“Vice fire is born in heart, without the slightest omen! Its power is immense! Legends have it that vice fire can burn everything, turning into nothingness.”

When Ye Yuan heard everyone’s surprised and bewildered voices, the corners of his mouth could not help smiling slightly.

These people finally reacted to it.

The Vermilion Bird was a divine beast of fire. Its attainment in the laws of flame was exceedingly deep.

This vast expanse of desert was actually a sea of vice fire.

Walking in this desert, one must maintain tranquility of the mind, rippleless like an old well.

Otherwise, once the vice fire was evoked, one would be directly burned to death.

Of course, Ye Yuan could not have known beforehand. But with Dustless around, this degree of trap naturally could not possibly affect him.

In reality, ever since entering the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range, Ye Yuan felt like he had returned home.

The extremely perilous land of danger to others was akin to flat ground for Ye Yuan. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

These people were all overly anxious for success, wanting to find the Vermilion Bird true blood as quickly as possible. It was naturally impossible to maintain a calm mind. Evoking vice fire was naturally something very normal.

Discovering the oddity, these martial artists all strove to maintain tranquility of the mind. Sure enough, phenomenons of being burned by vice fire immediately fell drastically.

However, things were not as simple as they imagined.

As they continued going deeper, the temperature in the desert became higher and higher. Their state of mind also became more and more irritable. Hence, there were people who started to be burned to death by vice fire again.

In the crowd, two gazes were staring fixedly at Ye Yuan all along.

The older one among them opened his mouth and whispered, “Heh, this kid is indeed rather capable, to actually be able to see through the vice fire in-advance. If not for him, the two of us master and apprentice might die here too.”

The young man said, “Master, I keep feeling that something is off about this Ye Yuan.”

These two were Ji Xun and Zhuo Han, master and disciple.

When the two of them saw Ye Yuan enter the Door of Vermilion Bird, they also followed closely behind and came in.

The incident last time made Ji Xun very pent up with anger.

Ever since entering the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range, he had always been finding a chance to get Ye Yuan alone, wanting to kill him.

Seeing Gu Tianque entered the Door of Black Tortoise, Ji Xun realized that the opportunity came. Hence, he followed Ye Yuan two people and entered the Door of Vermilion Bird.

Originally, they wanted to immediately take action. But when he saw Ye Yuan make Leng Qiuling revolve her cultivation method, Ji Xun kept feeling that there was something fishy. Hence, he did not make a move all along.

They followed far behind the crowd. When he saw people being burned to death by vice fire in front, Ji Xun immediately understood.

Hearing Zhuo Han’s words, Ji Xun smiled and said, “What you said is right, this boy is indeed rather different from the rest. Let’s not take action first. I feel that by following him, we might be able to have an unexpected harvest.”

Seeing Zhuo Han’s unwilling look, Ji Xun continued, “Han-er, rest assured. Your grudge, Master will definitely avenge it for you! When we find the Vermilion Bird true blood, it’s when Ye Yuan dies!”

Time slowly trickled by, the crowd searched for as long as half a month in the desert, but did not have any harvests.

Many people became more and more irritable. The people who were burned to death by vice fire also became more and more.

“Does this damn place have Vermilion Bird true blood or not! Goodness, no, I can’t get angry, can’t get agitated, maintain tranquility! Stay calm!”

This person’s slapstick comedy immediately incurred a series of laughter.

But very soon, these laughing sounds quietened down.

Laughing would not do too.

Suddenly, someone in the crowd pointed in front and shouted, “You guys, look! What’s that?”

[1] This vice fire is a bit hard to translate, it’s a fire used to punish sinners in hell. But in this context, it’s a fire that burns when your emotions stir.
