Chapter 2005: Facing an Army Alone!

“C-Create an Empyrean powerhouse?”

White Light was first stunned, but he woke up to reality very soon, suddenly looking at Bai Tong.

Among these people, if talking about who had the likelihood of becoming an Empyrean powerhouse, there was only Bai Tong.

Bai Tong’s eyebrows raised up, and he shook his head and said, “It’s no use. The Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill’s high-level version is a rank seven divine pill. You currently can’t refine it at all.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The last time I refined the Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill, I already researched this medicinal pill thoroughly long ago. Although I’m unable to let you recover to peak state right now, returning to Empyrean Realm is still achievable.”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces revealed looks of wild elation.

Didn’t this mean that in the future, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would have an Empyrean powerhouse to hold down the fort?

Bai Tong also had a pleasant look of surprise as he said, “Is this true?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill is indeed a little obscure, but if one really has a thorough understanding of it, it’s actually also just like that. Furthermore, some spirit medicines’ medicinal properties don’t require such obscure spirit medicines. Before going to Extreme Light Imperial City, I’ve already informed Myriad Treasure Tower to let them prepare rank six spirit medicines.”

As he said this, Ye Yuan took out a medicinal pill.

Bai Tong’s gaze could not help turning sharp, staring fixedly at Ye Yuan.

This kid really aggravated people to death without paying for it!

Also just like that?

No matter how insignificant it was, that was also a level nine medicinal pill!

Other people followed it by the book but you were good, directly creating the medicinal pill.

Similarly an alchemist, but why was the disparity so great?

Bai Tong had to admit that this kid really had a talent that ordinary people found it hard to imagine in terms of Alchemy Dao.

Ye Yuan’s understanding of medicinal pills had always pointed straight at the source.

The things that he saw were totally different from other alchemists.

Pill formulas were never some imperial edicts in Ye Yuan’s eyes.

“How’s the medicinal effect? I heard that Empyrean Lu Yan is a Second Firmament Empyrean powerhouse,” Bai Tong received the medicinal pill and asked.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, your strength won’t be weaker than him. At that time, I’ll give you the Qinghong Battle Armor, so you won’t lose to him no matter what.”

Everyone’s face was wild with joy. None of them thought that Ye Yuan had actually long prepared a contingency.

“But, Big Brother, Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital has three great Empyrean powerhouses! Although the other two are just First Firmament Empyreans, they still have that many True God powerhouses,” White Light suddenly frowned and said.

The high-level combat power was settled, but the other party’s force was too powerful.

Once Bai Tong was tied down, two First Firmament Empyreans plus several thousand True God Realm powerhouses would attack. Heavenly Eagle Imperial City still could not block them!

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “A bunch of clay chickens and pottery dogs; what’s there to be worried about? Everyone set your mind back at ease and have a good rest.”

When everyone heard that, their eyes lit up.

It seemed like Ye Yuan had ready plans to meet the situation long ago.

Sure enough, one sentence from him and everyone really set their minds at ease.

...

On this day, the gazes of the guards in the city suddenly turned sharp, discovering that there were countless little black dots in the horizon that were currently heading over here.

Countless martial artists were akin to locusts passing through, making people’s scalps tingle.

One of the guards said, “This ... This ... so freaking spectacular! I have never seen before so many True God Realm powerhouses in this lifetime!”

When that guard saw this scene, he was frightened until his legs quivered.

After all, such a scene was truly rare in the Heavenspan World.

Such a large-scale True God Realm martial artist battle was simply appalling to hear.

Using this kind of terrifying line-up to deal with a tiny little imperial city was even more unheard of.

Another guard had an ashen face as he said, “It’s over, it’s over! How to fight? This is not on the same level at all!”

Although everyone made up their minds to live and die together with Heavenly Eagle, seeing such a terrifying scene, each and every one of them still could not resist trembling.

A guard commander swallowed his saliva and instructed his subordinates, “S-Still in a daze for what? Hurry and go report to Lord Ye Yuan!”

But that subordinate did not move, pointing at the horizon and muttering, “N-No need. Lord Ye Yuan he ... he already came out.”

Everyone looked over in the direction he was pointing at. It was oonly to see a young and handsome figure standing on top of city walls, standing with his hands behind his back, quietly looking into the distance.

“W-Why is His Excellency by himself? Could it be that he’s planning on dealing with these 100 thousand people alone?” Everyone was filled with fear.

A guard commander plucked up his courage and asked, “Lord Ye Yuan, you ... What are you doing?”

Ye Yuan turned around and flashed him a smile, saying “All of you back down, leave it to me.”

Everyone’s faces changed, this answer was too fantastical.

Facing an army of 100 thousand alone?

Furthermore, the other party had five to six thousand True God Realm powerhouses!

That guard commander said resolutely, “Your Excellency, you mustn’t be suicidal! Although we’re weak, we’ll fight to the end with you.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “All back down. Just a bunch of motley crew, so no need to be so nervous.”

When everyone heard, they were rendered speechless.

Motley crew?

Even if it was a motley crew, reaching True God Realm, it was also not what they could withstand!

Countless powerhouses arrived with a howl, giving people an extremely strong visual impact.

Ye Yuan’s figure moved, going to welcome them. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When the few people in front saw a young man coming head-on, they could not help having stunned faces.

“Stop!”

More than 100 thousand martial artists gradually stopped, facing Ye Yuan from a distance.

The few people in front were shockingly Ninth Firmament True God mighty experts.

A middle-aged martial artist stepped out of the ranks and looked at Ye Yuan as he said with a cold smile, “Brat, why is it just you alone? Where are the others? All scared until they don’t dare to come out anymore?”

“Heh, you’re that Ye Yuan punk, right? Do you regret it? Planning on coming out to meet your death now? However ... it’s useless, Lord Lu Yan already issued a death order. Not a single one of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s martial artists will be spared!” Another Ninth Firmament True God stepped out of the ranks and said.

“Kid, you really ate a bear’s heart or leopard’s gall, to actually dare kill Miss Ziyi! Now, it’s useless even if you regret it too! The entire city has to be buried in death with you!”

Several Ninth Firmament True Gods looked at Ye Yuan with amused expressions on their faces.

A puny little Ye Yuan was merely an ant-like existence in their eyes.

Even if he killed Lu Ziyi, even if he was exceptionally talented, he was just a Third Firmament True God.

No matter how heaven-defying he was, it was also not worth mentioning in front of a Ninth Firmament True God.

Any one of them that stepped out could easily pinch Ye Yuan to death.

Ye Yuan had a calm expression. He just looked at the few Ninth Firmament True Gods indifferently and slowly opened his mouth and said, “You all are overlords of a region. Looking on the account that your many years of bitter cultivation wasn’t easy, I’ll give you guys a chance now. Quickly leave and I’ll spare your lives!”

The voice was not loud but transmitted into everyone’s ears clearly.

Everyone had stunned faces, especially these Ninth Firmament True Gods in front of him.

Was this kid frightened silly?

What did he say just now?

Spare our lives?

Just based on him, a Third Firmament True God?

“Hahaha, kid, I didn’t hear it wrongly, right? Your meaning is that you alone are going to annihilate all of us?”

Ye Yuan slowly nodded and said, “You got it right.”
