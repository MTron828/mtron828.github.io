Chapter 1249: Activating the Sacred Dragon Token!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Four clans’ origin?”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned stern, not expecting that what he got was actually such an answer.

After Heavenly Dao went missing, the Divine Realm’s Demon Region declined very quickly.

After that war 50 thousand years ago, the Four Symbols Family Clans even suffered a major loss in vitality.

Right now, although there was Long Min, this kind of powerhouse, they were still much weaker than the human race on the whole.

In the process, there were a lot of secrets buried in oblivion in history.

Ye Yuan really did not know what the origin of the Four Symbols Family Clans was.

Since the Four Symbols Family Clans each had their own progenitors, then where did these progenitors come from?

The old ancestor slowly said, “Azure Dragon of the East, White Tiger of the West, Vermilion Bird of the South, Black Tortoise of the North, the Four Great Divine Beasts’ progenitors were once the Divine Realm’s guardian divine beasts. The four great progenitors’ strengths were exceedingly formidable. Working together to suppress the four directions, no one dared to disobey! Even Origin Deity Realm powerhouses will also turn to dust with a flick of a finger under the Four Symbols Grand Array formed by them!”

Ye Yuan’s mind was in upheaval from hearing it.

What kind of existence Origin Deity Realm was, Ye Yuan was completely unable to imagine.

Could it be that the four great progenitors were beings even stronger than Origin Deity Realm?

“Just what kind of existences where the four great progenitors?” Ye Yuan could not resist asking.

But the old ancestor shook his head and said, “I don’t know either! I just know, very, very strong! Their strength is not what the likes of us can surmise at all. As for the specifics of how strong, only they themselves knew.”

Ye Yuan drew a cold breath, instantly feeling somewhat perturbed.

The four great progenitors, that was definitely existences more than a million years ago.

Then just what was the even more ancient Divine Realm like?

Why did the present Divine Realm wither to this point?

Ye Yuan discovered that the more he knew, the more uncertain he became instead.

This Divine Realm was far from as simple as seen on the surface.

“All of the Four Symbols Family Clans’ martial techniques were passed down by the four great progenitors, complementing each other, and secretly encompassed Heavenly Dao. Once performed at the same time, the resonance of Dao will appear, and from there, the power will increase greatly,” the old ancestor said.

“So, that’s how it is!” Only then did Ye Yuan come to a realization.

The four great head elders’ strength was merely the bottom of the Ten Great Divine Kings.

But their combined attack was even a notch above the Darkness Divine King, Sikong Shang.

The amplification involved was not just a tiny bit.

“Huhu, the four of them, their strengths are too weak. They are completely unable to unleash the power of the combined attack. If it was the combined attack of Grotto Profound Deity Realms, they can even cross a major realm to battle!” said the old ancestor.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, frightened by the old ancestor’s words.

Deity Realm powerhouses crossing a major realm to battle, this was simply something unimaginable.

Even for peak Grotto Profound Deity Realms, it was also impossible to be a Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm’s match.

This kind of increase was simply inconceivable.

Ye Yuan suddenly thought of something and asked again, “The Four Symbols Family Clans’ Seven Constellation Grand Array could even summon their respective guardian spirits. I wonder if they can produce a resonance by being together?”

Back then, Ji Canglan restrained the spirit of the white tiger, but was thwarted by Ye Yuan.

His goal at that time was just the spirit of the white tiger, and not destroy the tiger clan.

It seemed like the fiend race wanted to use the spirits of the four symbols to do something.

Ye Yuan only had this query because he recalled this matter.

The old ancestor nodded and said, “That four Seven Constellation Grand Arrays were originally one. Combined together, it’s called the 28 Constellation Grand Array. It was laid down by the four great sacred ancestors, and had a trace of ancestral spirit entrusted in it. Later on, the four clans’ members became more and more, and there was a powerhouse who split the grand array into four, becoming each clan’s clan protecting grand array. It’s just that presently, Heavenly Dao is missing, the power of the ancestral spirits are less than one-ten thousandth as well, its power far worse than before. However, if the four spirits combined attacks, that power absolutely can’t be underestimated.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze dimmed slightly. He kept feeling that Kanuo’s goal was not merely unifying the Divine Realm.

Also, Kanuo had once said something ‘Immortal Grove Region’ before. It seemed like it was referring to the Divine Realm.

Ye Yuan had always found this very odd. But this kind of thing, probably even Fang Tian could not answer him either.

But, all these were not important. The most important thing right now was to eradicate Kanuo!

As long as he could break through to Deity Realm, by relying on the Voice of the Dragon God, he was absolutely able to kill Kanuo.

Even if his strength recovered completely, as long as there was Heavenly Dao suppressing, the outcome was also the same. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You’re leaving?” asked the old ancestor.

Ye Yuan came back to his senses from his rumination and said with a nod, “I’m going to enter the god-forbidden region and search for the opportunity to become a deity!”

The old ancestor’s gaze turned sharp, and he said in surprise, “The god-forbidden region is a place that even Deity Realm powerhouses don’t dare to set foot in!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “But that’s also the only place where it’s possible to become a deity! Old ancestor, perhaps ... you’ll come a day where you can see the light of day again!”

The old ancestor’s entire body trembled, his gaze revealing a look of shock.

Linking it to Ye Yuan possessing the Atavism Dragon Soul, he understood what Ye Yuan wanted to do very soon.

Now that Heavenly Dao was missing, this kind of thinking ... was tantamount to a fool’s talk!

Except, why was he so excited?

“Sigh, for Jun-er to have a son like you, it’s truly obtaining heaven’s blessing! Yun-er, you possess the Atavism Dragon Soul, I have nothing to teach you. But there’s one thing that I believe can help you a little.” The old ancestor said.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, and he quietly waited for the old ancestor to carry on talking.

The old ancestor said quietly, “The Sacred Dragon Token, you probably still can’t control it yet, right?”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “How did you know?”

The old ancestor laughed and said, “Heavenly Dao is missing, Divine Dao dwindling to zero, there’s naturally nobody in the outside world who can control the Sacred Dragon Token! And the method to control the Sacred Dragon Token, only the dragon clan’s Deity Realm powerhouses know!”

“This ... I’ve attempted to produce a resonance with the Sacred Dragon Token using divine rank dragon wave before, and also attempted to activate with blood essence. But without exception, they all failed,” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

The Sacred Dragon Token was a heavenly divine artifact, its power was definitely a grade above the Evil Extermination Sword.

Concerning all these, Ye Yuan thought about all the methods that he could think of but had never succeeded before.

Feeling helpless, Ye Yuan could only give up.

He did not expect that there was actually an unexpected surprise today. The old ancestor actually knew the method to activate the Sacred Dragon Token.

“Huhu, the Sacred Dragon Token is my dragon race’s supreme treasure, and it was personally forged by Lord Sacred Ancestor, who used it as the token to be patriarch. If it could be activated by anyone who obtained it, then wouldn’t my race have the possibility of being controlled by people at any time?” said old ancestor.

“Makes sense,” Ye Yuan said with a nod.

“The Sacred Dragon Token was forged by the sacred ancestor with blood essence, and he used a great divine ability to integrate the method of activating the Sacred Dragon Token into the inheritance memory. Only dragon race powerhouses that broke through to the Deity Realm can get to know the method of using the Sacred Dragon Token. Of course, that’s also just knowing. Only by obtaining the Sacred Dragon Token’s recognition can one become the lord of the dragon clan, and be able to activate the Sacred Dragon Token. Otherwise, even if Origin Deity Realm powerhouses obtain it, they would also be unable to unleash its true power!” said the old ancestor.

“So that’s how it is! This way, there’s only you alone in this world currently who knows the way to activate this Sacred Dragon Token?” Ye Yuan said in surprise.

No wonder even he used everything up his sleeves, he was still unable to activate the Sacred Dragon Token.

If not for him mistakenly entering the land of exile, he could probably only activate it by breaking through to the Deity Realm.
