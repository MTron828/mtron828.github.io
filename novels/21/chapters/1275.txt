Chapter 1279: Heavenspan World!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Old Fart Dustless, this kid already grasped control of Heavenly Dao. Until when are you planning to hole up like a turtle?” Kunwu suddenly said.

Ye Yuan was stunned when he heard that, somewhat uncertain what it meant. Because Kunwu said it to him.

Suddenly, a faint gray shadow appeared in front of the two. It was an old man who had experienced many vicissitudes of life.

The old man’s figure was very faint, faint until it was about the same as a transparent person.

“You piece of wood. You clearly know that I’m very weak right now, still want to call me out!” Dustless smiled as he scolded.

Kunwu smiled and said, “Not that I wanted to call you out, it’s him who requires your help!”

Dustless said with a bitter smile, “You, oh you, alright then. Since it’s his matters, it’s not up to this old man to turn it down either!”

While talking, Dustless lightly swept at Mu Lingxue. A surge of mysterious power instantly wrapped her up.

Following that, Mu Lingxue turned into an arc of flowing light, and actually entered Ye Yuan’s glabella.

This scene made Ye Yuan jump in fright.

Mu Lingxue actually entered inside the Soul Suppressing Pearl!

“Senior, this ...” Ye Yuan said in wonder.

Kunwu smiled and said, “Old Fart Dustless is the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s artifact spirit. That move of mine can only preserve a trace of that lass’s spiritual consciousness from extinguishing. But it can’t last for a long time either. Want to maintain her life force, you must borrow the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s power.”

Ye Yuan’s shock was by no means insignificant. He did not think that this old man was actually the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s artifact spirit!

He hurriedly gave a bow toward Dustless and said, “Please, Senior!”

Ye Yuan could sense that Dustless’s condition was not very good. Taking Mu Lingxue’s physical body into the Soul Suppressing Pearl already expended considerable amounts of his strength.

Dustless smiled and said, “You’re the Soul Suppressing Pearl new master. This is naturally what I should do. Moreover, without you, I wouldn’t be able to reawaken as well. It’s just that my current state is very unstable. Maintaining that little lass’s life force still requires the supplementation of soul force.”

Ye Yuan suddenly thought of that Deathsoul Tree and Li Gui. Could it be that that Deathsoul Tree and Li Gui were actually devoured by this old man before his eyes?

This idea gave Ye Yuan a fright.

Someone as powerful as the Deathsoul Tree was actually devoured by the Soul Suppressing Pearl so effortlessly?

“The soul force supplementation that Senior talked about, could it be ... devouring divine souls?” Ye Yuan asked.

Dustless smiled and said, “That’s right! The Immortal Grove Region’s lifeforms, their soul force is too weak and is completely insufficient to let me recover. Only a fellow like the Deathsoul Tree can barely manage to satisfy my appetite.”

Ye Yuan was speechless for a while when he heard. The Deathsoul Tree was already an invincible existence in the Divine Realm. It was actually just barely able to satisfy his appetite!

But thinking about it, Dustless only recovered this tiny bit after gobbling up the Deathsoul Tree, he was also relieved.

The artifact spirit of an empyrean spirit treasure was not what he could conjecture.

“The Soul Suppressing Pearl is a divine soul defensive type empyrean spirit treasure. It’s power is boundless! If Old Fart Dustless can recover to his peak state, even if a heavenly empyrean arrives in person, they won’t be able to attack your divine soul either! This kind of empyrean spirit treasure, even in the Heavenspan World, it’s also exceedingly rare!”

Clearly, Kunwu held the Soul Suppressing Pearl in very high esteem.

But Dustless said with a smile, “In my current state, I can at most only withstand the divine soul attacks of Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm. Any stronger and I’d probably have to fall into slumber again.”

Ye Yuan said curiously, “That Deathsoul Tree ...”

“The Deathsoul Tree was born in the Immortal Grove Region, while I’m Immortal Grove’s empyrean spirit treasure. No matter how strong he is, he can’t escape the palm of my hands either! Moreover ... he was imprisoned in this God-forbidden region by this old man in the first place, originally planning on devouring him. The result was ... I fell asleep myself first,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan clicked his tongue in wonder when he heard, not expecting that there was actually still such a thing.

Messing around for so long, this Deathsoul Tree was actually just a nourishment that the Soul Suppressing Pearl was rearing in a pen!

No wonder he cursed that old fart so fervently. Turned out that it was actually Dustless.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists towards Kunwu and said, “Senior, I wonder what the method to save Lingxue is?”

What he was most concerned about right now was still this.

Without a doubt, the method to save Mu Lingxue was definitely in the world outside.

Something that even Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove could not accomplish, it could be imagined how difficult that was!

This path was even more densely covered with thorns than his road of revenge.

Kunwu smiled and said, “You don’t be anxious first. Since you’re going to the Heavenspan World, I’ll tell you about the Heavenspan World’s situation first. Then you consider whether or go or not.”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said, “Senior, please say!”

Kunwu nodded his head and said, “Heavenspan World and the Immortal Grove Region are two totally different concepts! It’s not a higher-level space compared to the Immortal Grove Region, but a world that existed since time immemorial! The reason why it’s called Heavenspan World is that there’s a divine mountain there called Heavenspan Mountain! In the Heavenspan World, your so-called Deity Realm is only the starting point!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed. The meaning in Kunwu’s words was that he, this existence that stood at the very summit of the Immortal Grove Region, was only the most ordinary person if he went there!

Just like ... a mortal!

But toward the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan still yearned for it more.

He very much wanted to see just how strong that world’s powerhouses are!

“Heavenspan World? Heavenspan Mountain? Senior, then what kind of existence is Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove in the Heavenspan World?” Ye Yuan muttered.

Kunwu smiled and said, “Deity Realm has a total of six major realms, namely: Grotto Profound Deity Realm, Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, Origin Deity Realm, Divine Lord Realm, Celestial Deity Realm, as well as True God Realm! Above True God Realm is the Heavenly Empyrean Realm! Heavenly Empyreans are also major power-class existences in the Heavenspan World, towering above Deity Realm! And above Heavenly Empyrean Realm, there’s even Heavenly Emperor and Dao Ancestor, two great realms! The true masters of the Heavenspan World are the Dao Ancestors!”

Ye Yuan had his breath taken away from listening to it. He did not expect that the Deity Realm actually still had so many realms.

Empyrean in his eyes is already an existence too lofty beyond reach. He did not expect that above heavenly empyrean, there were actually still even higher realms!

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Kunwu smiled and said, “Don’t have that sort of unrealistic ideas anymore! The realm of Dao Ancestor is not what you can imagine! The Heavenspan World only has nine Dao Ancestors. They are all paramount existences who obtained the recognition of a law, and they have already existed for countless billions of years! They are invincible existences! A law commanding recognition of a Dao Ancestor, unless they die, otherwise, even if your talent is even more heaven-defying than the Dao Ancestor’s, it’s also impossible to reach their realm!”

Ye Yuan drew a cold breath when he heard that and said in horror, “There’s actually still such a thing?”

In Ye Yuan’s understanding, as long as talent was sufficient, as long as effort was enough, one could step foot in a supreme realm one day.

But his way of thinking did not seem to work in the Heavenspan World.

Only when a Dao Ancestor died would a law become vacant.

But a Dao Ancestor was a powerhouse standing at the summit of the entire Heavenspan World. Who could make them fall? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Unless they killed each other!

But Kunwu said that they had already existed for god knows how many billions of years. This indicated that neither one of them could do anything to the others.

Hence, this became a paradox!

What Kunwu said was right, even if your talent was any more heaven-defying, it was also impossible to become a Dao Ancestor.

Kunwu looked at Ye Yuan’s expression and smiled again as he said, “I’ve said, this isn’t a thing that you should consider now. What you have to consider now is how to pass through the turbulent spatial flow!”
