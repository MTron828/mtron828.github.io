Chapter 1444 Far Away at the End of the Horizon!

“Hahaha, Ye Yuan, you’re finally still going to die in my hands! The Dao Fruit is mine, Qin Tian’s!”

Looking as if he was about to obtain the Dao Fruit, Qin Tian became incomparably excited.

However, the fireballs around him became more and more, also making it difficult for him to stride forward.

The Ten Thousand Year Mystic Crystal’s spiritual energy was indeed abnormally powerful. Qin Tian’s aura was still in the midst of rising crazily.

“Argh!”

Qin Tian shouted loudly, his aura rising to the peak all at once!

The pressure that belonged to Origin Deity powerhouses instantly spread out.

Qin Tian’s gaze turned sharp, the long sword in his hand akin to a snake hissing, shooting over towards the surrounding fireballs like lightning.

“Puhwark!”

Even if he broke through to Origin Deity Realm, these powerful fireballs still injured Qin Tian’s internal organs.

Qin Tian forcefully suppressed the injuries and continued advancing.

The fireballs became more and more concentrated, virtually drowning Qin Tian’s entire person.

But the Qin Tian after breaking through was too powerful. Although he advanced slowly, it was very steady!

However, along with the passage of time, Qin Tian’s injuries also became heavier and heavier.

While on the other side, Duan Fei’s speed clearly slowed down immensely. He already almost could not block the fireballs’ offensive anymore.

“Damn it! This grand array is too powerful! The farther in front, the more terrifying the power of the fireballs!” Duan Fei gritted his teeth and said.

“Puhwark!”

Qin Tian spewed blood along the way as he walked, finally arriving in front of the Dao Fruit!

The sacred aura of Heavenly Dao hit him head-on, making Qin Tian virtually about to rise to heaven.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Qin Tian drew his sword like the wind, cutting down several fireballs in the proximity, left hand darting towards the Dao Fruit like lightning.

Right in front of his hands!

Qin Tian’s heart was almost leaping to his throat!

This was a Dao Fruit!

As long as he swallowed it, the day he broke through to Celestial Deity Realm was right around the corner!

In that case, he would be a region’s powerhouse in the Heavenspan World too.

When Wu Meng City Lord saw him, he would also have to respectfully call him ‘Your Excellency’!

In the Heavenspan World, Dao Fruits were too scared, too precious.

Whoever saw them would inevitably be moved too.

“Now, you’re mine!” Qin Tian spouted blood but had a blissful smile on his face.

Swoosh!

Right at this moment, Qin Tian only felt a blur before his eyes. An afterimage streaked past in front of him.

The Dao Fruit was gone!

In this instant, Qin Tian fell straight from heaven to hell.

The Dao Fruit that was clearly well within reach was actually snatched by someone!

Near at hand a moment ago, but far away at the end of the horizon a moment later!

That afterimage just now was unimaginably fast. Even Qin Tian did not catch his trajectory.

In addition, he appeared too suddenly. Qin Tian could not react at all.

“Such fast speed! What happened just now?”

“Don’t know! My eyes have always been staring at Grand Elder. Then, he suddenly disappeared!”

“Grand Elder snatched the Dao Fruit? Where ... Where is he?”

“Hahaha, so close! I already lost all hope just now, I even thought that we’re all dead for sure!”

...

Confirming that Qin Tian did not obtain the Dao Fruit, the people on the White Night Sacred Palace’s side were all wreathed in smiles.

Just now, their hearts had leaped to their throats and even thought that the Dao Fruit would definitely land in Qin Tian’s hands.

He did not expect that the situation changed drastically, and it was snatched away by Grand Elder.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The rock wall above the dome suddenly experienced an intense explosion sound.

“Chasing Moon!”

Ye Yuan’s inconceivably quick sword extinguished the fireballs that tailed behind him. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Following that, Ye Yuan revealed his figure.

His hand held a fruit. It was precisely the Dao Fruit!

“Ye Yuan, I’ll kill you! The two of us cannot live under the same sky!”

As Qin Tian dealt with the fireballs, he roared at Ye Yuan crazily.

A duck that came to his hands flew away, Qin Tian’s fury at this time could be imagined.

He did not know why Ye Yuan would be quick to that degree just now.

He was clearly still very far from the Dao Fruit, but he snatched away the Dao Fruit like teleporting.

This snatching food from the jaws of a tiger, everyone did not react in time!

This scene happened too suddenly, too unthinkable.

Until now, there were still quite a number of people in the midst of shock.

Ye Yuan landed in the safe area again at this time and said to the Qin Tian who had his hands full, “You stay engaged first, I’ll find you to settle scores in a while! The scores between the two of us really have to be settled properly!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s figure shifted swiftly, teleporting once more.

Before long, Ye Yuan appeared beside Bai Chen, handed the Dao Fruit to him, and said, “Eat it!”

Bai Chen had a look of utter disbelief. Then shook his head like a rattle-drum and said, “N-No way! Such a precious thing, Master, you only got it after escaping danger by a hair’s breadth. How can you give it to me?”

Eating this Dao Fruit meant that one could control a world!

Ye Yuan actually gave it to him so casually?

Bai Chen knew the perils of that scene earlier. Although he could not see Ye Yuan’s movements clearly, the intense explosions that came from above indicated that Ye Yuan definitely triggered the grand array.

Everyone all used incredibly envious gazes to look at Bai Chen. The White Night Sacred Palace’s powerhouses were similarly like so.

Eating this Dao Fruit, one could control a world.

They, these Deity Realm powerhouses, Bai Chen could wield absolute power over their life or death!

Such a thing, who did not want?

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “This thing is useless to me, I won’t eat it no matter what.”

Bai Chen’s eyes went wide and he said in disbelief, “How can it be useless? If you eat it, you can control the Sky Foothill World!”

Ye Yuan said, “Things in the world, you win some and you lose some! Although the Dao Fruit is good, as long as one eats it, they will utterly wipe out their talent, cultivation difficulty becoming a thousand times, ten thousand times harder than ordinary people! If barring no accidents, they will just stop at the Celestial Deity Realm in this lifetime too. Unless ... they encounter an even more incredible Dao Fruit.”

A person running into one Dao Fruit in a lifetime was already heaven-defying destiny.

Encountering a second one ... there was basically no possibility.

Ye Yuan’s ambition was very big. He thought nothing of Celestial Deity Realm at all.

Hence, this Dao Fruit was a heaven-defying treasure to others, but it was worthless to him!

Ye Yuan did not hide his voice. Qin Tian who was currently in a fierce battle with the fireballs nearly spewed out a mouthful of blood.

‘Just stop’ these two words were used well!

Celestial Deity Realm, even in the Heavenspan World, only one could be born among hundreds of millions of martial artists too.

This guy was actually so contemptuous.

“Therefore, you have to think clearly too. If you consume this Dao Fruit, you’ll never be able to break through past the Celestial Deity Realm in this lifetime anymore. Of course, you might not understand the significance of Celestial Deity Realm. Celestial Deity Realm, even in the great world outside, can also be considered a true powerhouse.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

By the side, Mo Yun’s breathing had long become extremely ragged.

Seeing Bai Chen still in a daze, he could not resist saying, “Silly boy, what are you still waiting for? This is a massive lucky chance that His Excellency bestowed upon you! Didn’t you see how much that intruder wants to get this Dao Fruit?”

Bai Chen abruptly startled awake, gaze looking firmly at Ye Yuan, and directly knelt down.

Dong dong dong!

Bai Chen gave three deep kowtows toward Ye Yuan.

“Master’s grace, I’ll definitely repay it after I break through to the Celestial Deity Realm!” Bai Chen said firmly.
