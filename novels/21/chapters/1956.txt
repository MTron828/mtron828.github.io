Chapter 1960: I Can’t Give You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Why would the city lord meet him? Furthermore, it’s even Lord Jian Suyan going to invite personally? Could it be ... they are going to let him enter the Stellar Hall anew?”

Hearing the news that Li Xun brought back, Jian Hao’s thoughts could not help going wild.

Indeed, during the period where Jian Hongxiao held the position of Stellar Hall’s elder, the city lord thought very highly of him.

Meeting Jian Hongxiao again this time, could it be that he wanted to call him back anew?

If this was the case, it was really quite troublesome!

“This ... it’s not what this lowly one can know.” Li Xun said awkwardly.

Jian Hao’s gaze suddenly turned sharp and he said viciously, “What about that punk who caused Yun-er to become like this? Why wasn’t he captured here too? He’s the prime culprit! Capture him here for me immediately!”

Jian Hongxiao had Jian Suyan protecting him. Jian Suyan was not what he, Jian Hao, could offend. But Ye Yuan was different.

Li Xun said with a gloomy face, “This lowly one wanted to bring him away too, but ... but Elder Suyan said that City Lord wants to see him too!”

“What?! What’s City Lord meeting this punk for? Could it be that ... this punk has some background?” When Jian Hao heard this, he could not help jumping in fright.

Li Xun thought about it and said, “Elder, Young Master Yun only took one look at that kid and suffered Heavenly Dao backlash. Is it possible that ... that kid really has some aspect that surpasses others?”

Jian Hao’s brows knitted even tighter. He pondered carefully, the more he thought, the more terrified he got.

“Although Yun-er’s aura viewing art is still lacking, he’s also a True God Realm powerhouse. Even if it’s the imperial aura, it’s also impossible to have such a huge backlash appear. Could it be that ... that kid possesses the emperor surmounting aura? Furthermore, it’s even a powerful existence among emperor surmounting auras? But ... But how is this possible?”

Originally, because of Jian Yun’s backlash, Jian Hao was burning in rage and did not carefully think about this matter at all.

But now, calming down and thinking about it, he immediately detected something amiss.

He was a Stellar Hall elder, so how could he not be clear about the situation of the aura viewing art?

To talk about making Jian Yun suffer Heavenly Dao backlash, unless Ye Yuan was carrying some terrifying treasure on him, or he was in possession of tremendous destiny.

Regardless of which it was, Ye Yuan’s background was clearly not simple.

But the problem was, where did Jian Hao find this kid, and also, what was the objective of bringing him to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital?

Furthermore, City Lord even summoned this kid!

This matter was likely not that simple.

...

Walking into a vast hall, Ye Yuan felt as if he walked into a vast starry sky.

In the center of the starry star, there was an enormous, but exquisite apparatus, currently slowly revolving.

Ye Yuan sized the instrument up, feeling the powerful undulations coming off of the instrument, he guessed that this should be the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere.

A gray-robed old man sat before it, his body radiating countless pale-yellow fine threads, probing into the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere with a thousand and one links.

This old man gave Ye Yuan an incomparably deep feeling, just like this starry sky.

The other party was clearly not looking at him, but Ye Yuan actually had a feeling of being seen through.

After Jian Hongxiao entered this great hall, the expression on his face immediately became respectful, his body also seemingly becoming much stiffer.

Clearly, he held that old man in great esteem.

No idea how long had passed either, those fine threads slowly retreated into the old man’s body.

Jian Hongxiao bowed down rather agitatedly, shouting out, “Sinner Jian Hongxiao, pays respect to Lord Sutao!”

“Oh Hongxiao, long time no see,” the old man slowly said.

“Yes, in a twinkle, it’s been more than 100 thousand years!”

Jian Hongxiao actually had tears running down his old face.

The old man’s gaze slowly shifted to Ye Yuan and sized him up carefully.

“You’re called Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said with cupped fists, “I pay respects to Lord Empyrean.”

The old man’s gaze was profound as he said, “Even this old man actually can’t see through your depths, indeed well-deserving of being emperor surmounting aura. Looking at it, you likely won’t be an ordinary Heavenly Emperor powerhouse in the future!”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Senior is too kind.”

The old man was calm on the surface, but in his heart, he was taken by surprise.

Reaching his boundary, he was extremely sensitive to the flow of Heavenly Dao. His perception toward danger was God knows how many times stronger than Jian Yun that kind of rookie.

He wanted to employ the aura viewing art to observe Ye Yuan just now, but warning bells suddenly sounded in his heart and actually made him have a feeling of danger.

He naturally knew about the matter of Jian Yun being blinded, and thought to himself: could it be that I would also become like that?

But even if it was the emperor surmounting aura, with his skill, it also would not be to that extent, right?

Currently, Jian Sutao was extremely conflicted in his heart. He very much wanted to activate the aura viewing art and take a look at Ye Yuan’s situation. But the moment he thought of Jian Yun’s outcome, he did not dare to do so anymore.

As the lord of a city, an Empyrean powerhouse, he could not bear the consequences of becoming blind.

Curiosity kills the cat; this kind of situation was still effective when placed on an Empyrean powerhouse.

Thinking about it, Jian Sutao still gave up in the end.

Once something really happened and he suffered Heavenly Dao backlash, he, this rank seven powerhouse, did not have the Seven Veins Stellar Pill to save him.

At that time, he would be a blind man for life.

This kind of result was not what he could accept.

Jian Sutao looked towards Jian Hongxiao and opened his mouth and said, “Back then, before you left, this Empyrean performed a divination for you and calculated that your path wasn’t severed. But didn’t think that ... it’s answered here.”

Ye Yuan was terrified when he heard it. This level of augury skill was simply terrifying. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

100 thousand years ago, it was actually divined without the slightest error.

100 thousand years ago, he was not even born yet!

This kind of thing that was foreordained by the unseen; Jian Sutao himself also could not grasp it. But 100 thousand years since then, it truly appeared.

Jian Hongxiao was also very surprised and said, “Turns out that Your Excellency has long calculated for me before! I only calculated that my fate had a turn for the better recently too.”

“Hongxiao, the matter back then, was hard on you! Do you ... still bear a grudge against this Empyrean?

Jian Hongxiao hurriedly knelt down and said, “What’s Your Excellency saying? Casting the forbidden art for Fengqi was Hongxiao acting arbitrarily, resulting in causing a terrible calamity, and even almost affected the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere. I am the Stellar Hall’s sinner!”

Jian Sutao heaved a sigh and said, “It’s this Empyrean who is useless! The more one is a member of the Jian Family, the more helpless they tend to be. Clearly know that the disaster is in sight, but can only watch it happen helplessly, I’m afraid ... only reaching Ancestor’s realm, can one transform the rotten into something magical, right?”

Jian Hongxiao also sighed and said, “What I hate the most is having caused such severe consequences, but not being able to stop Fengqi from leaving. Sigh ... only hate that Hongxiao is powerless!”

Ye Yuan listened quietly by the side, guessing in his heart.

Sure enough, the matters back then were not that simple.

Jian Hongxiao cast the art of defying heaven and changing fate for a person called Fengqi, wanting to avoid a disaster.

It was just a pity that in the end, it caused a heavy loss. Yet, Jian Hongxiao was still unable to salvage Fegnqi’s life.

Jian Sutao suddenly looked at Ye Yuan and said, “Junior, you came here for the Six Veins Stellar Pill’s pill formula?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Yes, Senior please grant the pill formula for a look.”

“The Six Veins Stellar Pill’s pill formula, I can’t give you!” Jian Sutao shook his head and said.
