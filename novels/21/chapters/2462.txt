Chapter 2468: Unkillable!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Several powerhouse auras surrounded a gray-robed youth in the middle, sealing off all of his escape routes.

Chasing for half a day, the six great Dao Ancestors finally caught up to Ye Yuan’s chaos origin divinity.

Lin Chaotian’s expression was very ugly. He did not expect that the speed of Ye Yuan’s divine soul was actually so fast.

This half a day’s time, no idea what was the situation over there anymore.

“Humph!?See where you can still run to!” Lin Chaotian said in a deep voice.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said nonchalantly, “Lin Chaotian, you exhausted your brain and also didn’t expect that Treasure Pig was actually a rule powerhouse, right??Huhu,?now that you can’t kill me this time, I’m afraid that you’ll find it hard to eat and sleep in the future.”

The six great Dao Ancestors had strange looks on their faces. Did this guy not figure out the situation yet?

Your divine soul had already been nabbed by us, still want to get out alive?

“Hahaha,?Ye Yuan, you already have nowhere to retreat, what will you use to seek revenge on us? Using that fleshy body of yours? Foolish guy, do you think that I’ll chase that pig and let you off? In my eyes, your importance is much greater than a Dao pill!” Lin Chaotian said with a loud laugh.

“Fool, have you not figured out the situation yet? Your divine soul is about to be annihilated right away. Yet, you’re actually threatening us here?” Ancestor Wind snickered and said.

But facing six great Dao Ancestors, Ye Yuan was very relaxed as he said smilingly, “The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain will be placed with you all for the time being. I’ll come and retrieve it later.?Uh?… this period of time, you all have to work a little harder. At that time, don’t disappoint me.”

Lin Chaotian’s brows furrowed slightly, having a foreboding premonition.

He understood Ye Yuan very well. These words seemed like posturing but Ye Yuan absolutely would not put up a bold front under the circumstances where he was not confident.

Could it be that this guy really still had some trump card?

Ye Yuan snickered and actually ignored the six great Dao Ancestors, passing through them.

The six great Dao Ancestors exchanged glances, was it possible that this guy was a fool?

Lin Chaotian’s brows furrowed slightly. Suddenly, he thrust a palm over.

Boom!

Terrifying energy undulation directly shattered Ye Yuan’s divine soul into pieces.

Lin Chaotian curled his lips and said, “This ancestor was still wondering what trump card there was. After half a day, it was indeed making an empty show of strength!”

Ancestor Wind smiled and said,?“Hahaha,?honestly, he acted rather real. This ancestor almost believed it!”

Dao Ancestor Darkness also smiled and said, “This guy is too freaky, it indeed makes people feel anxious. But this time, he’s de-de …”

Suddenly, Dao Ancestor Darkness’ eyeballs went wide, looking at a certain place with a disbelieving look.

That ‘dead’ word, could not continue saying anymore.

“Huhu,?Darkness, have you gone silly from joy?” Ancestor Wind could not help laughing as he said.

“Not that he’s gone silly. It’s you who have gone stupid!” At this time, a voice sounded out leisurely, seemingly so familiar.

Ancestor Wind’s eyelids twitched, turning to look at that place. Immediately, his eyeballs became engorged.

Ye Yuan was actually standing there perfectly fine like nothing happened.

Lin Chaotian looked towards Ye Yuan, immediately feeling his scalp tingle.

“You all seem to be very surprised? Lin Chaotian, did you boast that you understand me very well? This time, you seem to be very surprised! If I didn’t have a trump card, would I face the six of you great Dao Ancestors based on a wisp of a divine soul?” Ye Yuan said with a disdainful look.

Lin Chaotian had a shocked face as he said in disbelief, “You … How can you possibly be completely fine? Something is odd … about your divine soul!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Yeah, I don’t understand it too well either. But some kind of change seems to have happened to my divine soul. Forgot to tell you, Tian Qing was the same as you, wanted to kill me. But it was a shame. He couldn’t kill me either.”

Lin Chaotian’s pupils constricted, his eyes being filled with shock.

His divine soul, even Tian Qing was actually helpless against it too?

Having experienced the last Doomsday Battle, Lin Chaotian naturally knew what kind of figure Tian Qing was!

Even Tian Qing could not kill Ye Yuan. If so, then how strong was his divine soul?

However, Lin Chaotian was Dao Ancestor Life in the end. After experiencing the initial-most shock, he laughed coldly and said,?“Heh,?you want to intimidate this ancestor with a few words? Can’t kill one time, then this ancestor will kill you ten times, a hundred times! This ancestor wants to see whether you can pull through or not!”

Finished talking, Lin Chaotian raised his hand and it was another palm, striking until the void shattered.

Boom!

The chaos origin divinity was shattered again. But very soon, those gray-colored powder condensed together once more, recovering back to new!

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Chaotian and said smilingly,?“Huhu,?if you have the leisure time to kill me ten times, a hundred times, then bring it on!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s figure moved, running away again.

The six great Dao Ancestors had shocked looks on their faces, hurriedly chasing after.

“How is this possible? His divine soul actually can’t be killed?” Ancestor Wind still did not quite dare to believe it until now.

Lin Chaotian had a gloomy look and said, “No matter what, we absolutely can’t let him escape!”

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

In a blink, more than half a month passed. Terrifying sounds came from above the void from time to time.

Ye Yuan’s divine soul was shattered over and over again.

Except, it was useless!

The more the six great Dao Ancestors killed, the more fearful they became.

Ye Yuan’s divine soul did not show any signs of dissipating.

Lin Chaotian gritted his teeth and said, “Damn it! We already killed him dozens of times. Yet, his divine soul actually doesn’t have any signs of weakening! What kind of change happened to this guy’s divine soul?”

At this time, Lin Chaotian finally believed that Ye Yuan was not bragging anymore.

They really could not kill Ye Yuan!

Dao Ancestor Darkness said in a solemn voice, “Undying divine soul! I never heard of it before! Even if it’s Tian Qing, once his divine soul is destroyed, it will be certain death too. It would be absolutely impossible to survive. This boy is really too freakish!”

Ahead, came Ye Yuan’s jeering voice, “Lin Chaotian, if I were you, I’d make the best use of my time to go back and gain enlightenment on the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. I can feel that Heavenly Dao Samsara will definitely occur within ten years. If you have the time to waste here with me, better to go back and increase your strength. Maybe you’ll still have a chance to turn the tables!”

Lin Chaotian had a look of unwillingness on his face. But he knew that what Ye Yuan said was right!

Keep wasting time like this was no good to anyone.

They were almost approaching the Abyss World. It was not much far ahead. As long as Ye Yuan escaped into the Abyss World, they would not dare to enter too.

Rather than wasting time here, better to go back and cultivate.

Having obtained such a precious treasure, perhaps there would really be some breakthrough.

“Leave!” Finally, Lin Chaotian carried strong unwillingness and turned around and left.

Ancestor Wind said angrily, “Letting him go just like that? If he stages a comeback, what should we do?”

Lin Chaotian said furiously, “Can you kill him?”

Ancestor Win could not help choking when he heard that.

Lin Chaotian ignored him and left on his own.

The five great Dao Ancestors were unwilling too and could only follow after and leave.

Ye Yuan watched the few people’s departing back views, a look of amusement on his face.

“Huhu,?really didn’t expect that that unremarkable boy back then, could actually grow to this point, truly surprising!” Right at this time, a voice sounded out with a touch of playfulness.
