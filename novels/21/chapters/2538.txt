Chapter 2544: Disaster Comes From the Sky

In the imperial garden, an old man and a youth, two figures, were currently strolling.

The young man in brocade said, “Master Lin, it’s lively outside right now! An ascender, furthermore, it’s an ascender whose affinity doesn’t reach one point, actually refined a heavenly pill. The entire Eastward Country is boiling over with excitement!?Heh,?this ascender has overshadowed even your elderly self’s prestige!”

The old man was indifferent and said with a smile, “That second child in your family has been making a big hoo-haa recently!?Huhu,?a one point affinity ascender, no matter how high his talent, it’s also impossible to refine a heavenly pill! I’m afraid that this heavenly pill is refined by Jiang Yu, right?”

The youth in brocade smiled and said, “That second child of my family loves to make trouble the most. But this time, it’s stirred up really big! Right now, rumors are spreading outside, saying that that ascender’s alchemy path talent is outstanding, his potential unlimited. They even say …”

The old man scolded with a smile: “You punk, still leaving this old man hanging?”

The youth in brocade gave a difficult smile and said, “I’m afraid that if I say it out, Master Lin will be unhappy.”

The old man laughed in spite of himself and said, “This old man is already at this ripe old age, don’t I have even this bit of magnanimity? Say!”

The youth in brocade said, “They said that that ascender will definitely surpass Master Lin in the future, and become Eastward Country’s number one!”

The old man’s eyes flickered, his smile revealing some unnaturalness.

However, this bit of fluctuation flashed across fleetingly and did not manifest.

The old man said confidently,?“Huhu,?there are too many heavenly alchemists who surpass this old man in this world. What’s strange about one more? But, an ascender …?huhu,?I’m afraid that it will be a little difficult!”

The youth in brocade said with a smile, “That’s of course! These are all just rumors; nothing to believe. Looking across Eastward Country, who can compare with Master Lin’s alchemy methods?”

This youth in brocade was naturally the Eastward Country’s eldest prince.

And the old man was naturally Eastward Country’s number one alchemy path person, Lin Lan.

Eldest Prince stopped after broaching the topic and did not go deep either, changing the topic very soon.

He was a clever man who knew the logic of going over the limit was as bad as falling short.

Master Lin was not who he could influence. He just had to bury a seed in Master Lin’s heart and it would do.

Moreover, he was not fabricating wild tales, the outside world currently lauded Ye Yuan to the sky. Saying such a thing was not unusual.

After all, an ascender with only one point affinity being able to refine a heavenly pill was already heaven-defying to the extreme.

… …

Ye Yuan himself also did not expect that refining a heavenly pill would cause such a great sensation.

The Tang Family’s door was almost trampled broken.

He severely underestimated the influence of this incident. A one point affinity refining a complete product heavenly pill, this was absolutely an explosive to the extreme major incident!

Even people who had nothing to do with heavenly pills also knew that this was something impossible.

However, such a thing happened. It naturally aroused everyone’s great curiosity.

Therefore, the people who came to the Tang Family to request an audience with Ye Yuan every day came and went in endless streams.

The Tang Family’s popularity skyrocketed and even their business also boomed for some time.

But very soon, everyone’s attitude changed.

No reason other than because Ye Yuan did not meet these people seeking novelty without exception!

With regards to this first heavenly pill, Ye Yuan himself was extremely dissatisfied.

Because the quality was too poor!

Unbearable to witness!

To others, this might be something worth showing off.

But to Ye Yuan, it was completely unnecessary.

However, Ye Yuan had indeed also tasted the pain of not having affinity.

Although he already trained his instinct to an extremely terrifying realm, when it came to really refine the heavenly pill, he was still beaten black and blue by the complexity of heavenly pills.

If it were others, they would have long broken down.

Even the lowest level Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill required a combination of more than ten heavenly medicines too.

Extracting a heavenly medicine was nothing to the current Ye Yuan.

But combining them together was completely not like that at all.

The complexity involved, only people who really practiced alchemy knew.

It was also precisely because so, that the status of heavenly alchemists would be so revered.

It was also precisely because so that it was simply impossible for ascenders to become heavenly alchemists under the circumstances where affinity was lacking.

But Ye Yuan did not give up. Instinct was not enough? Then continue training!

Finally, eight years later, he refined a heavenly pill!

Although it was the lousiest heavenly pill.

Of course, in these eight ears, Jiang Yu also helped him a lot.

“Big Brother, just show face! Just once, alright?” Tang Yu thickened his skin and begged.

Ye Yuan shook his head stubbornly and said, “Not going. I can’t afford to lose this face!”

Tang Yu said gloomily, “But outside there, this news is already spreading like crazy; all saying that you’re a liar, saying that our Tang Family are liars. In fact, someone already turned the spearhead toward Second Prince!”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said, “What does that have to do with me?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Tang Yu nearly stifled internal injuries out and he said gloomily, “Big Brother, you really did an earth-shattering major thing! Even if the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill’s quality isn’t good, your affinity is put there. Being able to refine it is already a huge deal! But you … actually don’t show face!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Can that thing be called a heavenly pill too? The name is called Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, but if someone were to eat it, their foundation will likely be ruined immediately! Leave, leave, leave! Don’t disturb my closed-seclusion! After I really refine a heavenly pill, it won’t be too late for you guys to show it off!”

Ye Yuan directly pushed Tang Yu out of the door and continued devoting himself to researching heavenly pills.

Him going into a retreat and not coming out, coupled with observant and conscientious people adding fuel to the fire, the discussion turned into a one-sided situation very quickly.

Originally, after this incident came out, it caused a stir in the entire city. The Tang Family also rose along with it.

But all of a sudden, the Tang Family became a ray crossing the street; everyone shouting to hit it.

Especially in the alchemy world, they even joined forces to boycott the Tang Family.

Very soon, Tang Yu realized that something was not right!

After the incident fermented for a period of time, suddenly, disaster came from the sky!

On this day, a middle-aged man brought a large number of guards and surrounded the Tang Family tightly until water could not seep through!

Tang Jinhua and Tang Yu got a fright and hurriedly came out to greet them.

“Lord Xie Hua, I wonder what has the Tang Family done to have alarmed you?” Tang Jinhua gave a bow and said.

The status of this person in front of him was not ordinary. He was Nation Teacher Lin Lan’s eldest disciple.

The entire Eastward Country’s alchemy world’s affairs were almost all in charge by him.

Dispatching a massive force today, the arrivals clearly came with unkind intentions.

Tang Jinhua and Tang Yu’s expressions were very ugly. They did not expect to actually alarm Master Lin.

Xie Hua gave a cold laugh and said, “Don’t you all know what you’ve done? The Tang Family spread rumors and plunged the entire Eastward Country’s alchemy world into chaos. This Xie came here today to seal up the Tang Family!”

Tang Yu’s brows furrowed and he said, “Your Excellency, I wonder when my Tang Family spread rumors and disrupted the alchemy world?”

“Putooh!?You guys didn’t spread rumors? Didn’t you all say that a one point ascender refined a heavenly pill? Where’s the heavenly pill?”

“Yeah! How can a one point ascender possibly refine a heavenly pill? Your Tang Family is lying through your teeth!”

“Right now, it raised a huge uproar in the entire city, your Tang Family is the main culprit!”

… …

The moment Tang Yu opened his mouth, it immediately drew condemnation from a large group of people.
