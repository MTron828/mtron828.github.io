Chapter 1619 Humans“ Common Enemy

“all old friends already, don’t need to be like this. just call me ye yuan. ling feng, long time no see, you seemed to be doing pretty well now!” ye yuan said with a smile.

ling feng was incomparably shocked. in just a short hundred over years, ye yuan’s realm actually already grew from the initial-stage heaven glimpse back then to the current grand completion origin deity.

this cultivation speed was simply inconceivable.

“e-elder ye! n-not at all.”

ling feng also came back to his senses and immediately realized that ye yuan’s present identity was extraordinary. how could he still dare to address ye yuan as brothers?

ye yuan smiled and did not force things as well.

he knew that there was already an insurmountable gulf between him and ling feng. having him talk on equal footing with him again was likely very difficult.

his growth would inevitably be accompanied by this kind of situation happening.

yan ze was similarly incomparably shocked in his heart. back then, ye yuan was still just a little fellow in his eyes.

he did not expect that a hundred over years of not seeing, he was already an imperial city’s elder.

this made him rather uncomfortable.

but he came back to his senses very quickly and said to ling feng, “ling feng, you understand this area the best. introduce the situation of fiend calling ridge for the various lords then.”

ling feng bowed and said, “yes, lord yan ze!”

at this time, numerous divine lord realm powerhouses gathered around, all of their auras shocking.

facing so many divine lord realm powerhouses, ling feng’s complexion was also rather pale.

fortunately, he had been on the battlefield for many years and was also a person full of vigor and vitality. he could barely manage to calm himself.

hence, he started to speak with fervor and assurance, introducing the terrain and features of fiend calling ridge, the dangers of the natural chasm, as well as the opposite fiend race’s forces distribution.

ling feng had flopped around here for many years and knew these things with great familiarity.

while yan ze was pulled to one side by ling zikun who asked softly, “how did you guys know ye yuan?”

mentioning this, yan ze’s expression turned fearful, being filled with great respect for ye yuan.

back then, if not for ye yuan, tiderain city would have long been breached.

now, this place would likely be the fiend race’s territory already.

he recounted the events back then, making ling zikun incredibly shocked.

“this kid is indeed a freak! when at heaven glimpse realm, he could challenge the fiend race army alone. for him to have such accomplishments now, it’s also not unusual anymore,” ling zikun said with a sigh.

yan ze said curiously, “head elder, this ye yuan is merely at the grand completion origin deity realm. no matter how powerful his strength is, it’s also limited, right? why can he become heavenly eagle imperial city’s elder?”

ling zikun chuckled and said, “this kid’s alchemy dao strength, even heavenly eagle imperial city’s pill tower’s head elder is ashamed of his inferiority. do you think he can become an elder or not? moreover, he even comprehended spatial laws. he’s simply a freak!”

yan ze’s eyes opened wide, with a look of disbelief.

even though he guarded the frontier, what heavenly eagle imperial city’s pill tower’s head elder signified, he was very clear.

ye yuan was just grand completion origin deity and could actually make head elder candidly admit defeat.

such strength was a little too freakish, right?

very soon, ling feng introduced the general situation on this side. everybody also had an understanding.

right now, the precious treasure had not come into being yet. after everyone understood the situation, they each found a place to conserve strength and build up energy.

but ye yuan pulled ling feng to one side and talked about the old days with him, and gave him some rank two divine pills.

ling feng’s talent was pretty good. he was clearly peak middle-stage heaven glimpse already.

when he saw the medicinal pills ye yuan gave, he was shocked until his jaws hit the ground.

he realized that as long as he had these medicinal pills, it should not be a problem for him to break through to origin deity realm.

what ye yuan left for him were all divine-grade medicinal pills!

in the following few days, everyone all quietly waited for the day the precious treasure came into being.

on this day, light rose to the sky at fiend calling ridge, dazzling to the extreme, giving people a strong sense of shock.

“this ... what a powerful aura, this is the aura of great dao laws.”

“the precious treasure is finally born! just based on this aura, it’s absolutely a rare treasure!”

“too strong! no wonder everyone said that even celestial deity powerhouses will be moved. this treasure, i must acquire it!”

...

sensing the might of the treasure, the people were all unbelievably fervent.

everyone clamored to the edge of the cliff and looked down.

“the treasure is already born! everybody, quickly go down!”

someone gave a roar and leaped into the natural moat.

with the first person taking the lead, someone immediately followed suit. quite a number of itinerant cultivators were afraid of people taking the initiative and also jumped down after.

“argh!!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

but with this jump, there was immediately someone who discovered something amiss.

those people lost their center of gravity all of a sudden and actually dropped straight down the 100 thousand foot abyss.

screams came over, making everyone panic.

one had to know, these were all divine lord realm powerhouses; capable of flying in the air. they were actually unable to resist the origin magnetic field within the natural chasm.

someone exclaimed, “everybody don’t jump! this origin magnetic field is too strong, there’s simply no way to fly in the air!”

their faces revealed looks of despair. was this going to return empty-handed after entering a treasure mountain?

heavenly eagle imperial city’s group also came to the edge of the chasm at this time.

ye yuan discovered that the origin magnetic field at this time was more than a dozen times stronger than originally.

such a horrifying gravity, even divine lord realm powerhouses found it difficult to control themselves too.

and he knew that the further down, the stronger the forcefield. falling down only had the outcome of being smashed into pieces.

“ye yuan, this ... what to do here?” zheng qi could not resist asking.

ye yuan smiled and said, “we can only each display our magical abilities! according to my estimation, seventh-layered heaven divine lords should be able to go down on their own. ninth-layered heaven divine lords can roughly bring two or three people down.”

zheng qi said in surprise, “this forcefield is actually so strong?”

ye yuan nodded and said, “only strong, not weak! how powerful the forcefield below is, i can’t say for sure as well. perhaps when seventh-layered heaven divine lords go down, they will also have to suffer a huge loss.”

“hiss ...”

heavenly eagle’s people sucked in a cold breath. the strength of this forcefield was also too great.

the crux was that going down did not have any way of resorting to trickery at all. only by relying on the world power of divine lord realm powerhouses, forcefully breaking free of the constraints of the forcefield, could one stabilize their figure from there.

everyone also did not think that such a situation would actually occur.

“this ... doesn’t this mean that only four or five of us can go down?” zheng qi said helplessly.

everyone had disappointed looks. not being able to go down meant that they brushed past the lucky chance this time.

ye yuan smiled and said, “that’s talking about others. we’re naturally all going down.”

ling zikun suddenly came close and asked ye yuan, “that ... elder ye, you know spatial laws. are you able to bring people down?”

his words immediately attracted many people’s attention, scooting over one after another.

“elder ye, bring us down!”

“yeah, reaching below, we might be facing the threat of the fiend race. one more person, one more portion of strength!”

“elder ye, we should be united against outsiders now, don’t you say so?”

...

those divine lord realm powerhouses all looked at ye yuan eagerly, afraid that he would refuse.

but at this time, gao yuan suddenly snorted coldly and said, “all so submissive and meek for what? if he dares to not agree, that’s becoming all humans’ common enemy!”
