Chapter 1987: We’re Different

Originally, over 50 people went. Now, less than 40 returned.

Fortunately, those remaining were all elites. They were basically all Fourth Firmament True Gods.

These people all had injuries on their bodies, with their expressions showing extreme regret.

If they had known long ago, they would have listened to Ye Yuan.

Recalling those ferocious and berserk bone devils, these people all felt a chill run down their spines.

“You’re courting death!’

Zhou Yu gave a cold yell and dealt a rod blow toward Song Yu.

“Life and Death Seal!”

How could Ye Yuan let him do as he wished? Waving his hand, it was a Life and Death Seal.

Bang!

Ye Yuan did not budge an inch, but Zhou Yu shot backward, a mouthful of blood spraying wildly.

Zhou Yu was greatly alarmed in his heart. He did not see Ye Yuan for two days, but Ye Yuan’s strength actually strengthened this much?

One had to know, the two of them were still evenly matched in strength previously. Now, he was actually suppressed by the other party?

Although his consumption in the bone devil army was tremendous, the power of this rod just now was not weaker than that rod before.

The same move, he was suppressed, it could only say that the other party’s strength was stronger!

“Already overworked for two days and still have the energy to throw your weight about. If I were you, I’d be a bit more obedient. Although Song Yu’s words were unpleasant to the ears, he did not say the wrong things. I urged you before, but it was you who acted arbitrarily, harming everybody’s lives,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The others were silent like cicadas in winter, but they deeply felt the same way about Ye Yuan’s words.

Zhou Yu’s eyes spewed fire as he gritted his teeth and said, “You’re very good! After I recover divine essence, let’s settle the score again!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’ll accompany you anytime.”

The following few days, everyone was recovering vitality.

Although Zhou Yu let out harsh words and was also extremely displeased with Ye Yuan, he also understood that Ye Yuan’s strength was sufficient to be placed in the same category as him already. Ye Yuan’s strength was very useful for breaking through the bone devil army.

Whatever grudge, wait until after this bone devil army before talking.

Sure enough, the following two months’ time, some more people came again one after another. The numbers recovered to 50 plus people again very quickly.

And these people that came later, each and every one of their strength, none was not weak.

These people were only delayed for so long because they had fortuitous encounters. Their strength was naturally powerful.

But Ye Yuan did not have the intention of charging in. Only all the way until another two months passed, the numbers breaking through to 70 over people did Ye Yuan slowly stand up.

“I’m going to challenge this bone devil army, who’s willing to go together?” Ye Yuan said in a clear voice.

Zhou Yu did not move, he just smiled coldly and said, “Heh, the one who said not to go was you, the one who said to go is also you. Now, there’s merely just a dozen over more people and you dare to rush the bone devil army?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “I’m different from you.”

Zhou Yu’s face fell and he said with a cold smile, “In what way are we different? Do you really think that your strength surpasses mine? Everyone, don’t listen to him. He’s at best on par with me. If I couldn’t clear it, could it be that he can clear it?”

The others also exchanged glances, not knowing how to decide.

After all, those people who had entered once all had psychological traumas.

Seeing the other people’s expressions, Zhou Yu had a cold smile on his face.

I want to see how you play!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Rushing this bone devil army, our squad will take the lead. The others can just follow behind and support with coordinated actions.”

The moment he said this, the others were startled.

When Zhou Yu brought them to rush the bone devil army, it was all having the others spearhead and attack.

Although his strength was the greatest, the effort that he exerted was actually not considered the most.

Those children of destiny who were killed by bone devils were the ones who exerted the most strength.

They drew most of the firepower.

But now, Ye Yuan was actually going to spearhead the attack himself, that was also to say that he would be facing the most bone devils, and also have to face the strongest bone devils.

“Would this kid be so good-hearted?”

“His strength is decent, but it’s also not to the extent of putting himself in danger, right?”

“This ... Wouldn’t be a scheme or a plot, right?”

...

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, everyone’s first reaction was that there was a problem.

After all, this kind of selfless thing, nobody would go and do.

Ye Yuan was naturally also not some goody-two-shoes, willingly putting himself in danger.

It was just that if he did not lead the attack, no matter how many the people, it was also impossible to charge through.

This point, he had long weighed it before.

The deeper in, the stronger those bone devils.

Even if his divine essence was thick, it also could not bear this kind of consumption.

After all, the numbers were too many.

If not because of this, he would have long gone to clear it himself.

By the side, Feng Xiaotian was overjoyed and hurriedly said, “Brother Ye, I’ll follow you!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and did not say anything.

“Pretending for what? Would you be so kind-hearted? Wouldn’t be harboring some malicious motive, wanting to entrap everyone, right?” Zhou Yu said with a cold smile.

Song Yu answered with a cold smile and said disdainfully, “Brother Ye had once slaughtered his way back alone from a place several tens of thousands of feet away. If even he can’t clear this bone devil army, then nobody can clear it!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

One stone stirred up a thousand ripples!

“What? Alone? From somewhere several tens of thousands of feet away?”

“This ... This is impossible!”

“Even if it’s a Fifth Firmament True God, if they fell into a heavy encirclement, it’s also certain death, right?”

...

Everyone’s first reaction when hearing this was that it was nonsense.

Although Fifth Firmament True Gods were strong, they also could not withstand the exhaustion of so many Fourth Firmament True Gods!

“You all don’t need to doubt, I saw this with my own eyes! Brother Ye he indeed killed his way out from the bone devil army by himself. Missing this chance, nobody can get the emperor bone,” Feng Xiaotian spoke up at the appropriate time.

At this time, the people in Feng Xiaotian’s team already all died, leaving only him, a lone general without an army.

To want to obtain the emperor bone, depending on Ye Yuan was his only choice.

Just as everyone was still doubting, Ye Yuan brought Song Yu and the rest and arrived at the borders of the bone devil army.

That bone devil army crawled out of the ground once more, each and every one baring their fangs and brandishing claws; extremely ferocious.

Ye Yuan said in a clear voice, “Without everyone’s help, I don’t have confidence in being able to charge through. But I’m only attempting this once. If it fails, I’ll give up on the emperor bone. At that time, everyone must think of another way then. Now, those who want the emperor bone, keep up!”

As he said, Ye Yuan’s Stellar War Banner suddenly rumbled out, directly blasting open a bloody path.

Then, he brought Song Yu and the rest, charging into the bone devil army without even turning his head back.

“Empyrean spirit treasure! Two empyrean spirit treasures!”

“So that’s how it is! Brother Ye is already leading his men to charge through! What are we still hesitating for? Charge!”

...

Done talking, there were immediately over a dozen people who followed after.

The figures of Ye Yuan and the others were gradually going further away. So they already did not have much time to hesitate.

Ye Yuan’s words, flashing out empyrean spirit treasures, coupled with leading his men in a charge, already conquered the vast majority of the people.

Compared to Zhou Yu, Ye Yuan was clearly much more credible.

He did not force everyone to join and was even in the forefront, leading his men.

In comparison, the level was immediately established.

The people who hesitated became fewer and fewer; everyone followed after like tidewater.

Zhou Yu’s expression flickered incessantly. He wanted to be the leader taking the initiative, but in the end, he messed up.

Now, making him follow Ye Yuan, he was unwilling from the bottom of his heart.

But based on him alone, it was absolutely impossible to break through the bone devil army.

In the end, he gritted his teeth and charged into the bone devil army.
