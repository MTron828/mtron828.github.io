1589 Your Ability in Teaching Disciples Can“t Make It!

Song Qiyang’s state today was really excellent to the max!

With the second spirit medicine, Jade Cicada Immortal Pistil, he reached a high score of 5.8 points.

At this time, Song Qiyang had a feeling of his spirit leaving his body, being invincible under the heavens.

“Hahaha, little girl, I see what you use to compete with me in this round!” Song Qiyang laughed loudly and said.

Head Elder Rou Xu’s face finally revealed a smile and said with a slight nod, “Huhu, striving harder after knowing humiliation, Qiyang is pretty good!”

“Huhu, it’s still Head Elder who taught well! Qiyang didn’t panic in the face of peril. No matter whether mentality or strength, he’s a top-notch choice!” Another elder curried favor.

“Head Elder’s eyes are discerning, Qiyang this child will definitely have great accomplishments in the future!”

When Head Elder heard the praises, he was extremely pleased in his heart.

He acknowledged it. Song Qiyang was his masterpiece. He was even more outstanding than his own head disciple.

He was also worried that Song Qiyang would be affected by the first round just now and perform below standard in the second round. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Looking at it now, his worries were superfluous.

Very soon, Song Qiyang also finished the Sovereign Rule Crape Myrtle’s Dao Development in one go.

The third spirit medicine, Song Qiyang similarly obtained 6.8 points!

The total tally of the three kinds of spirit medicines’ results reached a high score of 17.3 points.

One should not look down on these 0.3 points. To Song Qiyang, it was absolutely a massive breakthrough.

Dao Development could not continuously improve, drawing out even more law fragments just by cultivating.

After being about to guide 50%, every half a point of improvement was incredibly hard.

Song Qiyang only achieved a tiny bit of improvement after putting in god knows how much hard work.

Furthermore, he had merely only reached 17 points once as well.

Song Qiyang’s results immediately drew a series of praises.

“Sigh, he’s the Three-star disciples’ number one person in the end! Song Qiyang’s strength, really nothing to say. Losing to Ning Siyu previously was merely capsizing in a drain.”

“Yeah, people said that he might reach Head Elder’s height in the future. I think this statement isn’t false.”

“Such complex spirit medicines, yet he could actually even reach 17.3 points, simply a freak!”

...

Feeling everyone’s idolizing gazes, Song Qiyang felt comfortable to the extreme.

Especially after sweetness that came after suffering, this glory was even sweeter.

On the grandstand, Head Elder smiled and said to Xuan Yu, “Second Elder, 17.3 points, wonder if Siyu that lass can reach such a high score or not?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s gazes turned to Xuan Yu.

Provocation!

This was a blatant provocation!

They very much wanted to see whether or not the benign and uncontentious Second Elder would fight back or not.

It was just that in their view, for Second Elder to want to win, it was far too difficult.

17.3 points was already an exceedingly high score.

Second Elder’s eyelids raised slightly, finally opening his eyes. But outside of everyone’s expectations, he looked at Ye Yuan and asked, “Elder Ye, what do you think?”

What the hell was this?

Your disciple, you asked what he thought?

Could it be that you did not even know your own disciple’s standard?

This play was acted really fake!

However, Xuan Yu actually really did not know what was Ning Siyu’s situation right now.

It had merely been around ten days since Ning Siyu came back, but these ten days already made Xuan Yu feel at a loss.

The improvement was too great!

However, whether Ning Siyu only improved in fire controlling arts or had improvements in all aspects, he really did not know.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “17.3 points? Heh heh, getting this score and he also dare to come out and posture? Still such a high score? Sigh ... Head Elder, your ability in teaching disciples can’t make it!”

The grandstand was deathly silent, being struck dumb with amazement by Ye Yuan’s great ridiculing art.

Head Elder’s ability to teach disciples could not make it?

It was still their first time hearing it!

In reality, Head Elder’s ability of teaching disciples, even Second Elder could not hold a candle to him.

His disciples basically all suppressed Second Elder’s lineage, no matter at which stage.

Now, there was actually someone who said that Head Elder’s ability in teaching disciples was lacking!

Rou Xu’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a cold voice, “Elder Ye, I’m really somewhat doubting if you’re really an expert, or are you deliberately talking big to impress people? To a Three-star Alchemy God, being able to reach 15 points is already very impressive. Getting 17.3 points is already ranked among the best in all previous sessions of Pill Tower competition. Do you think I know how to teach disciples or not?”

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said disdainfully, “Head Elder, Song Qiyang offended this elder that day. This elder minded my identity and was disdainful to take action to teach him a lesson. But it doesn’t mean that this elder can allow a puny Three-star Alchemy God to bully! This elder doesn’t have an apprentice for the time being and asked Second Elder to lend me a disciple to be taught for a few days. No other intention, it’s just to let this disciple of yours know that there is always someone better, and heaven beyond heaven. Let him know that the dignity of elders cannot be provoked!”

“Hiss ...”

The elders all drew a cold breath, not expecting that Ye Yuan actually said such words.

His meaning was that Ning Siyu only became so impressive through his teachings?

But seriously, the improvement of Ning Siyu’s fire controlling art could simply use hop, skip, and jump to describe.

Except ... what did the phrase puny Three-star Alchemy God mean?

Said it like you were not a Three-star Alchemy God!

Rou Xu did not believe Ye Yuan’s words at all and said with a cold smile, “Is that so? Your meaning is that the disciple I taught for several hundred years is inferior to the one you taught for a few days? Young man, don’t talk too big when boasting, in case you can’t back it up when the time comes!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Head Elder rest assured. The words that I, Ye Yuan, say, can definitely be backed up!”

Rou Xu felt that Ye Yuan was simply a shit-stirring stick!

There was no way to chat!

Running into a lunatic when posturing, how can others still posture?

“Humph! Not making any sense!” Head Elder snorted coldly and stopped speaking.

Lu Yi and the rest perked their ears up and listened below, each and every single one of them feeling incomparably liberated.

Elder Ye was indeed as domineering as before!

When you all, these frogs at the bottom of a well, witness Elder Ye’s true strength, wait to stare dumbfoundedly with your jaws slack!

Upon thinking of Head Elder’s expression after being defeated by Ye Yuan, the few people all could not resist revealing a knowing smile.

The Dao Development was still continuing. Sure enough, after Song Qiyang, no performance that took people’s breath away occurred anymore.

The low ones were 10 or 11 points. Occasionally, a decent would one appear, it was also at most just 14 or 15 points.

But the more to the back, the points also gradually became higher.

After all, those able to slaughter their way out from the first round and take a high ranking were all powerful people.

Originally, Song Qiyang should also be ranked at the back. But because of the first round’s accident, that was why he was placed at the front.

After Song Qiyang, the highest score was Ning Siyu’s third senior brother. But he was also just 16.3 points, an entire point worse than Song Qiyang!

This disparity was already not small.

Ning Siyu’s third senior brother was second place, which was also the second last to leave the field.

There was still a last one remaining, that was Ning Siyu.

If Ning Siyu could not surpass 17.3, then Song Qiyang would be the second round’s champion.

For a moment, everyone’s gazes all landed on Ning Siyu.

Ning Siyu sucked in a deep breath, shattering the Blood Longevity Heavenly Ginseng with a palm.
