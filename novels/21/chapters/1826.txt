Chapter 1830 Playing With You All Till the End

“What does it count for? Huhu, then we’ll wait and see.” Yi Qingxiang just smiled faintly and was disdainful to explain.But at this time, Li Yiping who was beside Bian Ziqiu suddenly walked toward Ye Yuan.

“I heard Yi Qingxiang say that you’re angry?” Li Yiping said with a look of amusement.

But Ye Yuan totally ignored him and just said to Yi Qingxiang, “Senior Apprentice Brother Yi, let’s go.”

When Li Yiping saw Ye Yuan treat him like air, he felt very humiliated. He said furiously, “Ye Yuan, don’t think that you’re impressive for defeating He Yuan. He’s the weakest among our High Clarity Sect’s eight disciples! Tomorrow, your state will be as tragic as Yi Qingxiang!”

Ye Yuan was just about to turn around. Hearing this, he could not help but turn his head and said coolly, “He Yuan should be rejoicing that he was the first to exchange blows with me.”

Li Yiping’s face fell and he said with a frown, “What do you mean?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’ll understand very soon.”

Finished talking, the Shadowmoon Sect party immediately left.

Bian Ziqiu caught up, looking at Ye Yuan’s back view, he said disdainfully, “This guy is as cocky as before! It’s also time to let him know my High Clarity Sect’s might.”

Li Yiping said in a chilly voice, “Pretentious fool! I’ll make him regret today’s arrogance!”

Three days later, Li Yiping and Ye Yuan’s showdown began.

This fight attracted quite a few people’s attention.

Ye Yuan swept away the High Clarity Sect’s face in the first round. They all felt that this time, the High Clarity Sect would not be willing to take things lying down and would definitely act.

Li Yiping’s strength was very strong, Ye Yuan was sure to suffer.

“Heh, kid, you’re very arrogant huh! After today, you won’t be able to be arrogant anymore! Your outcome will be even more miserable than Yi Qingxiang that fool!” Li Yiping said in a cold voice. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ye Yuan’s arrogant attitude yesterday was still vivid in his mind.

Li Yiping’s anger was stirred up.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed and he said, “A bunch of self-righteous idiots! For the sake of so-called face, you wanted to deal a fatal blow. Starting from today, you all will experience the taste of fear. Of course, you can’t feel it right away now.”

Li Yiping burst into laughter and said, “Fear? Haha, this kind of emotion can only be given to others by the High Clarity Sect! Just based on your bit of strength, you wouldn’t really think that you’re invincible under the heavens, right?”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Not to the extent of invincible under the heavens, but dealing with you all, these self-righteous fools, it’s sufficient!”

Below the stage, when everyone heard Ye Yuan’s heroic words, they had disdainful faces.

High Clarity Sect’s strength was truly powerful until it made people frightened.

Just based on a puny little Ye Yuan, it was simply impossible to do it.

Disregarding the others, Yang Shen’s strength was powerful until it was freakish.

In the last round, Yang Shen only used one move and defeated a Second Firmament Celestial Deity, neat and tidily.

In comparison, Ye Yuan defeating He Yuan with one move was simply weak to the max.

“The hour has arrived. Begin!” Du Rufeng announced.

He looked at Ye Yuan very curiously, wanting to see just how many surprises Ye Yuan could still bring him.

Without a doubt, Yi Qingxiang’s injuries were treated by Ye Yuan.

Seeing Yi Qingxiang’s injuries recover that day, and his strength improving a step further, he got a shock.

He touched his heart and asked himself, even if it was himself taking action, it was also impossible to do it to this extent.

This kid’s Alchemy Dao strength was remarkable!

No wonder Treasure Pig would rather not want Lord Little Tong and also wanted to follow Ye Yuan.

Speaking of which, His Excellency definitely also discovered Ye Yuan’s extraordinariness, that was why he would stay by his side.

Suddenly, Du Rufeng’s pupils constricted, looking at the stage gasping in astonishment.

Li Yiping was dead!

“Just a blink of an eye and he died?”

“Li Yiping didn’t react at all and his head hit the ground already!”

“Really too strong! What 64th place, the Profound Realm Tablet’s test simply doesn’t work on this guy!”

...

Below the stage, many people still had not reacted to what was going on.

Li Yiping’s strength was sufficient to rank around the 20th place among these 64 people.

Even he did not react, let alone the others.

Especially High Clarity Sect’s disciples, each and every one of their faces were ugly to the extreme.

Ye Yuan was provoking them!

Bian Ziqiu’s face was almost distorted, extremely frightened in his heart.

His strength was slightly stronger than Li Yiping’s, but it was already limitedly strong, around ten plus ranking.

Ye Yuan could instantly kill Li Yiping, he could naturally one-shot him too.

To think that they were still pledging in all solemnness before, saying to teach Ye Yuan a good lesson.

Thinking about it now, it was simply a joke!

Bian Ziqiu suddenly recalled the words Ye Yuan said just now and his pupils could not help constricting.

Now, he really experienced the taste of fear!

Ye Yuan was clearly here to stand up for Yi Qingxiang, he was definitely inside the certain-kill list.

Rather, He Yuan secretly heaved a sigh of relief in his heart at this time.

Luckily, Ye Yuan did not go nuts in the first round. Otherwise, he would not be able to stand here now.

Of course, he did not dare to express this sort of emotion.

Yang Shen’s expression was gloomy to the extreme and he said in a solemn voice, “Starting from the next round, everyone who meets Ye Yuan, admit defeat straight away! Leave this kid to me!”

As if afraid that everyone was not vigilant enough, he emphasized: “Must admit defeat straight away, don’t give him a chance to attack! Remember, it’s everyone!”

At this time, High Clarity Sect’s rank two, Chen Tianlin frowned and said, “Yang Shen, how to do it is our business, it’s not your turn to tell us what to do!”

This Chen Tianlin was a peak Second Firmament Celestial Deity too. His realm was similar to Yang Shen’s, but he was not Yang Shen’s match.

This Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, he was also a hot candidate to enter the temple.

According to past situations, he could definitely get into the top five.

Toward Yang Shen’s words, he was very displeased.

Forget about the rest, he did not think that his strength could not even cross swords with Ye Yuan.

As High Clarity Sect’s number two figure, he had his own pride too. Making him admit defeat immediately, he could not afford to lose that face.

Yang Shen gave him a glance and said with a cold snort, “If you want to seek death, that’s up to you too!”

Chen Tianlin was just about to speak, but then he heard High Clarity Sect’s elder say in a solemn voice, “Tianlin, do it according to Yang Shen’s words! This kid is very dangerous! Entering the temple is our ultimate goal.”

Chen Tianlin’s brows furrowed and he answered, “Alright.”

Although he agreed verbally, he was very disapproving in his heart.

He examined himself, if caught off-guard, one-shotting Li Yiping in one move could also be accomplished.

Ye Yuan was merely using this kind of method to frighten the High Clarity Sect. In the end, Yang Shen and the elder were afraid.

Truly disgraceful!

Ye Yuan walked down the stage lightly. Yang Shen’s figure moved, blocking Ye Yuan’s path like a ghost.

“You’re courting death!” Yang Shen said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan looked at Yang Shen and said with a smile, “These words, your High Clarity Sect has already said many times. It’s too bad that after all is said and done, it’s all big talk. Moreover, it was you guys who provoked me first!”

Yang Shen said in a cold voice, “You think that you’re invincible by comprehending spatial law, do you?”

Others could not tell, how could he, Yang Shen, fail to see it?

Ye Yuan smiled faintly as he said, “Invincible or not, I don’t know, but since you all want to play, then I’ll play till the end with you all! If I didn’t guess wrongly, you made him directly concede defeat, right? You can try, see if they have the chance to concede or not!”
