Chapter 1264: Getting Completely out of Hand!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This human race martial artists’ pinnacle great battle aroused the attention of quite a number of powerhouses in the god-forbidden region.

Of course, this level of fight was not considered some unparalleled great battle to them.

When that pair of father and son saw Li Gui’s terrifying undulations, they said indifferently, “The laws are not bad. It’s just too bad that what he cultivates is Ghost Dao. Using the Ghost Dao in front of the Soul Suppressing Pearl, isn’t this simply like an elderly person eating arsenic, seeking death?”

“The Soul Suppressing Pearl is really too scary! These few years, the Deathsoul Tree has cornered the Kunwu Divine Wood badly. I didn’t expect that it was directly annihilated,” the son said.

“Devouring the Deathsoul Tree, the Soul Suppressing Pearl has probably already awakened. It’s just that that boy hasn’t detected it yet. Nothing nice to see anymore, the guy that cultivates Ghost Dao is dead for sure,” the father said.

...

Inside another deep and quiet valley, powerful undulations faintly leaked out.

Suddenly, a disdainful voice came out from inside the valley.

“Clowns jumping around! Showing off in the presence of an expert!”

...

On the mountaintop, a luxuriantly green large tree overshadowed and obscured the sun.

Different from the Deathsoul Tree’s lifeless atmosphere, this large tree was overflowing with life force.

A young man sat on the treetop, looking into the distance. That gaze seemed to pieced through the void, seeing very far away places.

“Heh, interesting. Using the Ghost Dao in front of the Soul Suppressing Pearl, it’s truly the ignorant is fearless! However ... the Soul Suppressing Pearl has just regained consciousness, it probably really needs this kind of nourishment!” the youngster said.

“That human seems to be here to find us,” the large tree suddenly emitted a voice.

“How do you know? Possessing the World Suppressing Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl, I wonder if this boy can save this Immortal Grove Region that is on the brink of collapse or not!” the young man said.

“Probably can’t! The Realm Locking Gate isn’t that easy to pass through,” the big tree said.

“You’re so sure? I’m very optimistic about this boy though!” the young man said with a smile.

...

Li Gui’s martial technique was cast halfway when he detected something amiss.

Undying Ghost Slaughter was the strongest soul technique that he could cast. If at his prime back then, even same-level powerhouses did not dare to clash head-on either.

Those capable of suppressing him was also just Absolute Heaven, that level of existence.

If he could refine himself into an undying evil ghost and use this move again, he definitely dared to contend with Absolute Heaven.

It was just that, man proposes, God disposes. A million years later, Heavenly Dao dwindled to zero. He was already unable to return to Deity Realm anymore.

What was even more damnable was that this boy in front of him ruined his million years of painstaking effort, making him fail on the cusp of success.

Even so, the Undying Ghost Slaughter, this move, was also an unbelievably terrifying existence.

But Li Gui discovered to his dismay that this move of his seemed to have set off some remarkable things. No matter how he outputted soul force, he was unable to completely execute this attack.

It was as if this move became a bottomless pit.

His soul force flowed into Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness unceasingly.

Ye Yuan clearly also detected the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s changes. The him who was originally akin to facing a great enemy simply just abandoned all actions at this time, allowing the Soul Suppressing Pearl to conduct itself freely.

The situation got completely out of hand.

The look of horror on Li Gui’s face became increasingly thicker. He wanted to withdraw his soul force, but he discovered to his dismay that he already could not do it.

Right now, his soul force seemed like floodwaters that broke the dam, flowing over toward Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness non-stop.

“Ye Yuan, you ... What the hell did you do? This ... What’s going on here?” Li Gui’s face was full of alarm and panic. His voice was even almost in tears.

Li Gui examined himself and felt that he was already an expert on the divine soul path. There was absolutely nothing that he did not understand.

But he discovered to his dismay that he completely could not understand the current situation.

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “You know it, I didn’t do anything.”

He really did not do anything, but would Li Gui believe?

It was because Ye Yuan did nothing at all that Li Gui felt even more fishy.

He knelt on the ground with a thud and prostrated to Ye Yuan and said, “Young Master Ye! Sir Ye! Master Ye 1! I ... I was wrong! I beg you to let me off! I ... I won’t ever find trouble with you again! You ... You didn’t lose anything at all, but I already have nothing at all anymore! I beg you to give me a chance to turn over a new leaf and let me off!”

This terrifying devouring power, he was completely powerless to resist.

No matter how he urged his Divine Dao laws, he was also unable to break free of Ye Yuan’s devouring power.

Li Gui even had the heart to die. Just what kind of an existence did he provoke?!

Ye Yuan said with a helpless look, “Not that I’m not letting you off, but I really didn’t do anything at all!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Soul Suppressing Pearl was not what he could control at all. From the start till now, all of the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s actions were done on its own.

This time was no exception as well.

Huff huff ...

The devouring power became stronger and stronger. Li Gui’s devoured was actually pulled right out of Zhuge Qingxuan’s body in the end, converging into Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness in the end.

Zhuge Qingxuan’s entire body trembled, looking at this scene in shock.

Without Li Gui, he also lost his final reliance.

The current him facing Ye Yuan, he did not have any strength to retaliate at all.

“Y-Ye Yuan, I ... I ...”

Zhuge Qingxuan’s expression was deathly pale. He completely did not expect that such a drama-like scene would actually occur.

In his view, no matter how miserable, this was also a great battle evenly-match on both sides.

Who knew that in a blink of an eye, Li Gui was devoured until not even dregs remained.

He retook his body’s control rights anew now. But, he had never lost all hope like this before, resulting in him not even knowing how to word it.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “You want me to let you go, right?”

Zhuge Qingxuan was stunned and nodded his head desperately.

But Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “Our enmity is also not irresolvable. But too bad, you sought refuge with the fiend race. This is something that this young master cannot tolerate. Therefore, sorry! Your life, I must take it!”

Hearing Ye Yuan sentence him to death, Zhuge Qingxuan’s face turned ghastly pale.

Suddenly, he lifted his head to the sky and gave a long howl and said, “What a joke! Ye Yuan, you don’t really think that you’re the savior, right? Do you know how strong Kanuo is? He’s a former Origin Deity Realm powerhouse! Do you think that you can be his match?”

Ye Yuan said very indifferently, “Otherwise, why do you think this young master would come to the Godsfall Mountain Range?”

“You want to become a deity? Hahaha ... this is even more unrealistic than suppressing Kanuo!” Zhuge Qingxuan said with a crazed laugh.

Ye Yuan pursed his lips and said scornfully, “That’s not something you have to be worried about anymore. Either way, you can’t see it anymore.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan directly used the Monumental Sword!

The Half-Deity Realm Ye Yuan displaying this move again, the power already could not be mentioned in the same breath!

Zhuge Qingxuan’s gaze revealed a savage look, and he said ferociously, “Your father, I, will fight it out with you! Profound Divinity Finger!”

Before Ye Yuan had broken through to Half-Deity Realm, Zhuge Qingxuan was already not his match.

How could this half-baked move currently be Ye Yuan’s match?

A sword unleashing, swept away all obstacles in the way.

Zhuge Qingxuan did not even let out a scream and was directly annihilated by this sword.

The Heaven Stabilizing Divine King, who had commanded the Divine Realm for over two thousand years, perished here!
