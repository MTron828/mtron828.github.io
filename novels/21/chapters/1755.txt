Chapter 1759 Verification and Acceptance

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Kong Yun was angered until his expression was livid.

While the others were silent like cicadas in winter, not daring to make a sound.

“Damn punk, to actually dare be so arrogant in front of me! 7-star missions, heh, I want to see how you complete them!” Kong Yun smiled coldly and said.

“This Ye Yuan is crazy, right? He actually wants to challenge 7-star missions!”

“7-star missions are what even elders might not be able to complete. That guy’s posturing was done over the top, right?”

“Isn’t that so? Probably got carried away with the title of the temple’s number one genius, right?”

“This half a year, he has never taken any mission that surpasses 3-star difficulty. Jumping to 7-star all of a sudden, isn’t this a joke?”

...

Regarding Ye Yuan’s actions, everyone was very disapproving of it.

3-star to 7-star, in between this was an insurmountable gulf.

7-star missions, only elders would occasionally accept.

Kong Yun came in front of that priest trainee and said with a grim face, “Let me take a look at what kind of missions he drew.”

The priest trainee did not dare to defy and handed the mission list to Kong Yun.

The moment Kong Yun looked, his expression changed first. Then he immediately burst into laughter and said, “This brat is probably a fool, right? These missions, if he can complete them, I, Kong Yun, will pluck my head off and let him kick like a ball!”

Ye Yuan’s move was too arrogant, throwing away all of his face.

His loud laughter was also wanting to gain back some ground.

Everyone was also very curious just what kind of 7-star missions Ye Yuan took on.

There were many 7-star missions. There were easy ones and also difficult ones.

Easy ones were merely slightly harder than 6-star missions.

Difficult ones were even comparable to 8-star missions.

Ye Yuan currently reached the front door. Hearing Kong Yun’s words, Ye Yuan’s figure paused, turned his head, and said, “I’ve remembered your words. I hope that you still have the courage to say such words tomorrow.”

Kong Yun laughed loudly and said, “You can rest assured that I’ll say it one more time tomorrow! Because these ten missions, there’s no way you can complete them!”

Ye Yuan just smiled and left with large strides.

The others were all very curious. Some priests whose strengths were pretty good stepped forward and asked, “Brother Kong Yun, just what kind of missions did Ye Yuan choose?”

Kong Yun sneered and said, “You guys see for yourself!”

When everyone saw the list, they immediately exploded!

“This number 75 mission, didn’t Elder Ni once accept it before? He ... He seemed to have failed back then!”

“Also, this number 367 mission, heard that quite a few elders accepted it. In the end, none of them completed it!”

“These ten missions, each one is impossible to complete, is he mad?”

...

The ten missions that Ye Yuan took on had basically all been accepted before by some, or several elders.

Furthermore, they all failed.

This kind of mission, how could a person who just learned half a year of demon divine pill refinement possibly complete them?

Moreover, Ye Yuan had never before done 3-star and above missions. Directly doing 7-star missions now, wasn’t this nonsense?

Kong Yun smiled coldly and said, “A fool who overestimates his own strength. Even if he wants to posture, he also needs to pick something suitable!”

Everyone nodded their heads, agreeing with Kong Yun’s words a lot.

This showing off was over the top!

...

At noon on the second day, Kong Yun had long arrived at the mission hall.

Same as him, there were already quite a few people waiting here.

“Kong Yun, heard that you were also kept in check by Ye Yuan yesterday?”

Kong Yun turned around to look. It was Chi Feng.

This guy heard that Ye Yuan took on a few impossible missions and naturally ran over to watch the show today.

Being able to see Ye Yuan get disgraced was also a very refreshing thing.

Kong Yun’s face fell and he said, “Being known as the temple’s number one genius, I even thought that he was some remarkable figure. Turns out that it was a fool!”

Chi Feng smiled and said, “May not be a fool, but being able to force him to this point, there’s probably only you.”

Hearing Chi Feng’s words, Kong Yun was also secretly pleased with himself in his heart.

“If he chose 6-star missions, I’d really still be a little worried. But, he chose 7-star. Forget that he chose 7-star, he even only picked some impossible missions. I say, what is he if not a fool?” Kong Yun said with a cold smile.

Chi Feng naturally did not think that Ye Yuan was a fool. But he similarly did not think that these missions Ye Yuan chose could be completed.

“In my view, he probably won’t be coming today. These missions are totally impossible to complete. However, 7-star and above missions need elders to come to verify and accept them. Elder Stonefeather already came. I want to see how he gives an account!” Chi Feng said with a smile.

Hearing that, Kong Yun also had a smile on his face.

After today, the title of the temple’s number one genius would return to him once again.

“Came, came! I didn’t expect that Ye Yuan really dared to come!”

“Heh heh, coming or not, he’ll become the temple’s laughing stock in the future!”

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd. Ye Yuan slowly walked in.

Ye Yuan completely ignored the other people’s gazes and walked straight to the place to hand in missions.

“I’m here to hand in missions,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

That priest trainee hurriedly said, “Lord Ye Yuan, please wait a moment. I’ll go invite Elder Stonefeather!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, that priest trainee turned around and left.

“Heh heh, putting on an appearance! These missions, if you can complete one of them, I, Kong Yun, will write my two characters upside down!” Kong Yun scorned with a jeering smile.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a speechless look, “Yesterday, wanted to pluck your head for me to kick as a ball. Today, wanted to write your name upside down. The things that your parents gave you, do you not cherish them like so?”

Kong Yun could not help choking when he heard that and said with a cold snort, “Stop pretending here! I want to see until when you can pretend.”

At this time, Stonefeather slowly walked out.

He looked at Ye Yuan with a look of surprise too.

This kid actually challenged 7-star missions all at once. Furthermore, it was all some extremely difficult missions. This was simply looking for abuse!”

“Elder Stonefeather!” Ye Yuan gave a bow to Stonefeather.

Stonefeather nodded his head and said, “Heard that you picked ten of the most difficult 7-star missions?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right, Elder Stonefeather please verify and accept.”

As he said, Ye Yuan put ten storage rings on the counter.

Stonefeather’s gaze turned intent and he said in surprise, “Ten missions, you ... you completed them all?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since Ye Yuan drew them, I naturally have confidence in completing. Elder, please!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Stonefeather was slightly surprised in his heart. He picked up a storage ring, sinking his divine sense inside, and started verifying it.

When Kong Yun, Chi Feng, and the rest saw this scene, they all had sneers on their faces.

However, Stonefeather’s expressions suddenly changed drastically and he looked at Ye Yuan in shock as he said, “This ... This Candle Ren Immortal True Pill was refined by you?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Elder Stonefeather must be joking. Could it be that there’s still someone doing it on my behalf?”

When the others saw this scene, each and every one of them was extremely surprised.

Could it be that Ye Yuan really completed one mission?

Forcefully suppressing the shock in his heart, Stonefeather picked up the second storage ring and checked it again.

Following that, was the third one, fourth ... all the way until the tenth!

The expression on Stonefeather’s face became more and more shocked, and more and more incredulous.

His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was like he had seen a ghost.

When everyone saw Stonefeather’s rich expressions, each and every one of them was similarly extremely shocked.

What in the world did Ye Yuan do, to actually make Elder Stonefeather lose composure like so?
