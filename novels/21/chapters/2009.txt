Chapter 2013: What a Grand Spectacle

Empyrean Chaoyuan, Empyrean Fivepeaks, Empyrean Skyhowl, and Empyrean Bluemist, these four people were all Fourth Firmament Empyrean super powerhouses.

Furthermore, the four of them belonged under different Heavenly Emperors.

This line-up was simply outrageous to hear.

Counting in the Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital behind Jian Hongxiao and the Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital behind Duan Yi, there were six major forces fervently supporting Ye Yuan!

A Third Firmament True God brat actually had such a fearsome influence!

Inside Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, it was long already boiling with excitement.

This show today was truly exciting beyond words, reversing continuously.

Ye Yuan’s trump cards were dealt out one after another, making people see a blur, more than they could keep up with.

Especially these four great Empyreans this display, the hearts of the martial artists in the city raced madly.

These many middle-stage Empyrean Realm super powerhouses, they had never even seen before in their lives!

“Lord Ye Yuan is simply incredible! So many Empyrean powerhouses are all standing up for him!”

“My God, in all my years, I’ve never seen before such a grand spectacle. Even if I die today, I’d also be willing!”

“We really followed the right person! Today, even if the Jade Emperor came, he can forget about bringing away His Excellency too!”

...

The current Heavenly Eagle martial artists were all incomparably proud. They felt proud for being a Heavenly Eagle’s martial artist.

Because they followed a miracle-like lord!

“Brother Cangyuan, you’re a leviathan of a region. Why is there a need to make things difficult for a puny little imperial city? Can you sell Fivepeaks face and drop this matter?” Empyrean Fivepeaks said coolly.

“Brother Cang Yuan, Little Friend Ye is a remarkable talent. Even if you guys are inviting, you also can’t use this way of inviting!” Empyrean Bluemist also said.

Empyrean Cang Yuan’s expression became incomparably ugly. Currently, he had ridden a tiger and found it somewhat hard to get off.

The line-up in front of him was too great, great until he could not quite withstand it anymore.

The Lu Yan three people behind him were long already staring dumbfoundedly with their mouths gaping.

The three of them were thoroughly struck dumb with amazement by Ye Yuan’s methods and connections.

A measly little Third Firmament True God could actually move six leviathans of a region to protect and escort him.

This kind of means was simply inconceivable.

Empyrean Cang Yuan gritted his teeth and said in a cold voice, “Fellow Daoists, acting like this is also looking down on my Extreme Nether Bodhidharma too much! What if I insist on bringing this kid away today?”

In his own territory, Empyrean Cang Yuan did not want to lose face.

Even if he braved all obstacles, he also had to bring Ye Yuan away.

At this time, Empyrean Chaoyuan slowly turned around, looked toward Ye Yuan, and said smilingly, “Little Friend Ye Yuan, it’s merely a city. Why not go to my Shiyuan? This Empyrean will promise you an imperial capital. How about that? At that time, even if you do as you please in the imperial capital, nobody will bother with you either!”

Empyrean Fivepeaks chuckled and said, “Brother Chaoyuan, you really know how to be a good guy! Little Friend Ye Yuan, come to my Redleaf, this Empyrean will promise you ten imperial capitals!”

The other two people were naturally unwilling to show weakness and also promised great wealth to Ye Yuan.

Song Yu and several good friends naturally also urged by the side, all hoping for Ye Yuan to go to their territories.

On one side, Empyrean Cang Yuan’s face was purple.

If Ye Yuan went to other great imperial capitals, then could he still interfere with him?

Weren’t you Extreme Nether Bodhidharma?

He isn’t in your Extreme Nether Bodhidharma now, can you still interfere with him?

Furthermore, these few people’s words were clearly said for Cang Yuan to hear, choking him badly.

Finished talking, the few Empyrean powerhouses all looked toward Ye Yuan with looks of anticipation, hoping for him to pick their side.

Already ended up in this state, Ye Yuan had no reason to continue staying.

Clearly, leaving was the best choice.

With Ye Yuan’s talent and means, with how vast the world was, he could go anywhere.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists towards the few Empyreans and said smilingly, “Seniors’ adulation, this Ye appreciates it. It’s just that this Ye has lived for many years in Heavenly Eagle and already can’t bear to part with this place.”

The moment these words came out, everyone revealed looks of surprise.

Especially the few great Empyrean, they did not expect that Ye Yuan actually refused so straightforwardly.

Empyrean Chaoyuan said in surprise, “Little Friend Ye, you have to think clearly.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Thank you, Seniors, for coming to aid me from afar. It’s just that this Ye’s mind is made up, hope that Seniors don’t take offense.”

Cang Yuan sneered when he heard that and said, “You see, he doesn’t appreciate the kindness at all! Exalted Empyrean powerhouses actually got snubbed despite their good intentions, truly laughable!”

Empyrean Chaoyuan frowned slightly and said coolly, “Little Friend Ye Yuan he naturally has the capital to reject. There’s no need to sow discord.”

Cang Yuan’s pupils constricted, not expecting that these few were actually so protective of Ye Yuan!

He snorted coldly and said, “You guys can get in the way for a moment. But could it be that you can still block for a lifetime? Could it be that the few of you can still garrison at Heavenly Eagle every day?”

Empyrean Cang Yuan’s voice had yet to fade when a storm occurred again.

Another two figures slowly stepped out of the void!

Cang Yuan’s pupils constricted, staring at those two figures in disbelief.

“Another two Empyreans! My God, how many Empyrean powerhouses are coming today before it’s considered done?”

“Hang on! Why do I feel that these two Empyreans’ auras are unfathomable, even stronger than Empyrean Cang Yuan they all?”

“It really is! Could it be that ... these two great Empyreans are even stronger than them?”

...

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was already thoroughly ignited. Today’s spectacle, they felt that they could go out and boast for a lifetime already.”

Such a grand spectacle was rarely seen in all of their lifetimes.

One Empyrean powerhouse appearing after another, each stronger than the last.

Furthermore, these two Empyreans looked like they were here for Ye Yuan too.

Just as everyone was in a state of disbelief, Jian Hongxiao and Duan Yi two people each stepped forward and bowed in salute.

“I pay respects to Lord Sutao!”

“I pay respects to Lord Flutterfeather!”

The arrivals were none other than precisely Jian Sutao and Empyrean Flutterfeather!

The expression on Cang Yuan’s face changed again and again. He was virtually about to suffocate.

Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital’s city lord and Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital’s city lord actually came together!

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s status was extremely high among Empyreans. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

One had to know, he was an extremely seldom-seen Seven-star Alchemy God, a grand completion Dao Realm super powerhouse.

Which Empyrean dared to not give him face?

Even Heavenly Emperor powerhouses also had to give him some face!

As for Jian Sutao, that went even more without saying.

His identity was much more exalted than Jian Hongxiao’s!

As the lord of a city, what Jian Sutao represented was the Jian Family’s face.

Furthermore, these two people were both Seventh Firmament Empyrean super powerhouses!

The two great Empyreans were both major figures who inspired awe all around.

Empyrean Cang Yuan was not worth mentioning at all in front of them!

Seeing this line-up, even Chaoyuan and the few Empyreans also went forward to bow in salute, expressing respect.

Regarding these two people’s appearance, Ye Yuan was also greatly surprised.

But thinking about it, it was naturally impossible that they came to make things difficult for him. Hence, he stepped forward and said with a bow, “Ye Yuan pays respect to Senior Sutao, Senior Flutterfeather.”

Jian Sutao nodded slightly and said, “You brat, you really can cause trouble! This Empyrean even heard about your valiant record far in Extreme Luck!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he could not help chuckling and paid no attention to it.

Rather, it was Empyrean Flutterfeather who suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Ye Yuan, this Empyrean came to find you because I have something to ask of you.”
