Chapter 2666: Joining Forces to Boycott

“Huhu,?Deputy City Lord Ironcore must be joking! That’s true grade heavenly pill. I heard that Jiang Li only consumed a grade two true grade heavenly pill, and as a result, he stepped into the realm of Jade Sovereign Heaven in one stroke! This news shouldn’t be fake, right?” Min Nanshan said with a deep meaning.

Ironcore nodded and said, “It’s true! It’s just that do you guys get a share of the true grade heavenly pill?”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of the three great family heads changed.

These three families possessed a pivotal position in Heavenly South City at present.

The three great family heads were all grade four heavenly alchemists too. They were just slightly inferior compared to the two great hall masters.

Even Zhao Xun relied greatly on the three great families too.

And what Ironcore said was also precisely what they were most worried about.

“After Head Hall Master and Second Hall Master came back, you guys have seen it too, they have remained in closed-seclusion all along. With their strength, breaking through to the realm of true grade isn’t hard. When the time comes, by relying on true grade, the two hall masters’ statuses will be transcendent. At that time, what will it still have to do with your three great families?” Ironcore said with a sneer.

True grade, it was absolutely a major killing tool!

Jiang Li’s breakthrough shocked everyone.

The crux was that what let him break through was a grade two heavenly pill.

This was impressive!

Ironcore’s words made the faces of the three great family heads change abruptly.

Not that they could not figure out this layer, it was just that they were not quite willing to believe.

After all, in Heavenly South Pill Hall, the status of the three great families’ was very important.

But just as Ironcore said, if the two hall masters grasped the true grade secret art and used it to command Heavenly South henceforth, who could dare to not follow?

Min Nanshan drew a deep breath and said in a solemn voice, “Deputy City Lord Ironcore, what should we do?”

Ironcore’s face revealed a knowing smile.

… …

On this day, Heavenly South Pill Hall was unprecedentedly grand.

The various major cities under the jurisdiction of Heavenly South City all sent prominent powerhouses over.

In the Land of Heavenly South, the status of Heavenly South Pill Hall had always been transcendent.

The deterrent power of heavenly alchemists was this strong.

Of course, there were many people who came for this mystical true grade.

“Haha,?congratulations to Master Ye for becoming Heavenly South Pill Hall’s Third Hall Master! My Water Billow City feels honored!” When Sun Yunjing saw Ye Yuan, he immediately cupped his fists and said.

By the side, Su Yi’s expression was very ugly as he said in a solemn voice, “What does Master Ye being promoted to Third Hall Master have to do with your Water Billow City? He came from our Calm South City. Even if it’s feeling honored, it’s our Calm South City too!”

Sun Yunjing did not care either and laughed loudly as he said,?“Heh heh,?this city lord and Master Ye, that’s making friends after a fight!”

Su Yi’s face turned black and he was just about to refute, but Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Alright, two city lords, this Ye has received your kind intentions.”

Ye Yuan already spoke up. It was naturally not convenient for Su Yi to flare up.

By the side, Huang Haoyan and Su Peiyun also came up to offer greetings.

There were too many people at this time. Ye Yuan did not have time to talk more and just had them go in and sit down.

“Min Family’s Family Head, Min Nanshan has arrived!”

“Song Family’s Family Head, Song Tianyang has arrived!”

“Yun Family’s Family Head, Yun Baiyu has arrived!”

After these few shouts, everyone’s faces changed.

Even Zhao Xun and Wu Jian frowned too.

Very clearly, they smelled a different smell.

“Normally, these three great families don’t care about each other. Why did they suddenly come together today?”

“Min Family Head has worked hard for many years in order to fight for this title of Third Hall master. But now, there’s completely no hope anymore!”

“The arrivals are not friendly! There’s probably a show to watch!”

… …

All those present were Heavenly South’s heavyweight class figures.

Just the Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were a whole bunch.

Each and every one of these people was crafty and shrewd. How could they not know Heavenly South Pill Hall’s underhanded activities? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

With Ye Yuan dropping out of thin air, the biggest impact was the three major families.

If they did not take some measures, that would be weird!

“Min Nanshan offers greetings to Head Hall Master, Second Hall Master!”

“Song Tianyang offers greetings to the two hall masters!”

“Yun Baiyu offers greetings to the two hall masters!”

The three people came to the front, cupped their fists, and bowed to the two hall masters, directly regarding Ye Yuan who was by the side as air.

Zhao Xun’s brows furrowed slightly, but he could not blow his top.

He was just about to introduce Ye Yuan but saw the three people walk straight into the venue.

Everyone exchanged glances; what an opening gambit!

This grand gathering today was hosted for Third Hall Master, Ye Yuan. In the end, they did not even pay attention to Third Hall Master.

Zhao Xun was a little awkward and said to Ye Yuan, “Ye Yuan, I’ll definitely teach these three fellows a lesson later!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just a small matter. Head Hall Master doesn’t need to take it to heart.”

Zhao Xun was a little surprised in his heart. He discovered that Ye Yuan was actually placid without any waves.

This atmosphere was absolutely not feigned.

Ye Yuan had such terrifying talent at a young age. To actually be able to have this temperament, it was truly terrifying!

For any genius, which one was not arrogant at heart and haughty in manner, unable to stomach anything that was offensive to the eye?

Yet, Ye Yuan was not!

After some small talk, the banquet officially began.

Zhao Xun raised his wine cup and said loudly, “Today, this Zhao introduces to everyone a young genius! Although he has just arrived, he has already made monumental contributions to Heavenly South! Only after seeing him does this Zhao know that I’m a frog at the bottom of a well! You all don’t need to suspect anything. It isn’t this Zhao self-effacing either, if he’s a grade four heavenly alchemist right now, this hall master’s position of head hall master will immediately be given up with both hands!”

“It was gracious of Fellow Daoist Ye to not reject and willingly join my Heavenly South Pill Hall! From today onwards, he’s my Heavenly South Pill Hall’s …”

“Head Hall Master!”

Right at this time, Min Nanshan suddenly stood up, interrupting Zhao Xun’s words.

Immediately, everyone’s gaze was attracted by him.

Zhao Xun’s brows furrowed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “Min Nanshan, what are you trying to do?”

Min Nanshan said coolly, “This Min feels that the two hall masters’ decision is too hasty!”

“Impudent! When is it your turn to come and butt into what this hall master does?” Zhao Xun shouted coldly.

But Min Nanshan was not afraid in the slightest and said coolly, “This boy is just a grade two heavenly alchemist, what right does he have to sit on the throne of Third Hall Master? If he becomes Third Hall Master, then where will we, these grade four heavenly alchemists, go?”

Zhao Xun smiled coldly and said, “Based on that he can refine true grade heavenly pills!”

Min Nanshan smiled and said, “Head Hall Master, none of us has seen before the true grade heavenly pill! You said that he made monumental contributions to the Land of Heavenly South, I have no objections. But Heavenly South is Heavenly South. Heavenly South Pill Hall is Heavenly South Pill Hall. He has yet to make the smallest contribution but became Third Hall Master, on what basis?”

“That’s right! Head Hall Master, our Song Family feels that it’s not appropriate as well!” At this time, Song Tianyang also came forward and supported Min Nanshan ardently.

Yun Baiyu also said, “Head Hall Master, how much contribution has the three of us major families made for the Heavenly South Pill Hall? Now, a measly little grade two heavenly alchemist wants to ride on top of our heads?”

Zhao Xun’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He completely did not expect that the three great families’ reaction was actually so fierce.

Furthermore, with the three great families taking the lead, many families also expressed objection. This somewhat made it even harder for them to dismount the tiger’s back after getting on it.

In the crowd, Ironcore looked at Ye Yuan with a broad smile, full of mockery.

“Heh heh,?brat, you’re still a little inexperienced to fight with this city lord! This is just the beginning. After chasing you out of Heavenly South City, this city lord will send you on your way!” Ironcore sneered coldly in his heart.
