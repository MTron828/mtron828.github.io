Chapter 2570: Windward Topple!

Thud, thud, thud!

Cheng Chongshan took several steps back in a row, his face blank.

“S-Senior Apprentice Brother, you aren’t joking, right?” Cheng Chongshan forced a smile as he said.

But Zhao Kun shook his head and said, “Not joking! I’ve seen before records in the sect’s ancient books. This is the unique poison of Zhong Jianchou, who was once known as the Five Great Heavenly Regions’ number one Jade Sovereign Heaven! Those who get poisoned by it have no chance! Silent Rupture, if it’s in the incubation period, it can still be suppressed through medicine. But, once it erupts, under Jade Sovereign Heaven will definitely die without a doubt! It seems that the ancient tomb you discovered might be his place of demise!”

Talking until here, a hint of greed flashed across in Zhao Kun’s eyes.

Zhong Jianchou had once been famous across the Five Great Heavenly Regions, known as Jade Sovereign Heavens’ number one person!

How could such an existence be of the common sort?

The legacy that he left behind was definitely a priceless treasure!

Cheng Chongshan this fool actually gave it to Ye Yuan with both hands.

However, there was no harm either. Since he came, he could naturally get it back from his hands!

Cheng Chongshan had a panicky look and muttered under his breath, “Impossible! Impossible! I clearly can’t detect any poison at all!”

Zhao Kun said, “This is also this poison’s formidable aspect. It’s completely undetectable in its incubation period! But once it erupts, even immortals will find it hard to save!”

Talking up to here, Zhao Kun could not resist looking toward Ye Yuan, feeling extremely shocked in his heart.

Silent Rupture’s poison could be said to make people tremble with fear when they hear it, Ye Yuan could actually completely suppress it when it erupted!

This kind of means was simply inconceivable!

One had to know, this was an incurable poison!

At this time, Cheng Chongshan’s lover, Wu Shuang, became anxious. She begged Zhao Kun and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao, I beg you, you must save Senior Apprentice Brother Cheng!”

Zhao Kun smiled and said, “Want me to take action, of course you can too. But, 70% of the treasures of your trip will belong to me! Furthermore, I get to pick!”

Cheng Chongshan’s expression changed and he said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao, this … this is too overboard, right?”

Zhao Kun said coolly, “Compared to your life, it’s not considered overboard! If you weren’t poisoned, I naturally wouldn’t have made this demand either. But since you have to turn to me for help, then you naturally have to pay the price.”

Everyone came out to make a living, nobody was a fool.

How could the exalted number one Jade Sovereign Heaven’s tomb possibly only have a mere five heavenly pills?

It was just that, within the same sect, it was not good to go too overboard for some things.

After all, Cheng Chongshan informed the sect about this matter.

If Cheng Chongshan died bizarrely, the sect would definitely have to look into it.

But, since Cheng Chongshan begged him, that was different.

Cheng Chongshan’s expression changed over and over again. Finally, he still gritted his teeth and said, “Okay! As long as Senior Apprentice Brother takes action, I’ll give Senior Apprentice Brother 70%!”

Zhao Kun smiled slightly and said with a nod, “Okay, swear the origin divinity heavenly curse then!”

“Wait! It doesn’t seem like you guys have the final say as to whether to cure the poison or not, right? Shouldn’t you all ask for my opinion?” Ye Yuan suddenly interrupted.

This Senior Apprentice Brother few people, negotiating terms back and forth, directly put Ye Yuan, this person curing the poison, to one side.

Cheng Chongshan’s so-called taking action was naturally having Zhao Kun take Ye Yuan down, and forcing Ye Yuan to cure the poison.

He had long expected Cheng Chongshan and Zhao Kun’s attitude.

What disappointed him was that even Wu Shuang also turned a deaf ear to him, this savior.

Cheng Chongshan was poisoned, she did not beg to him but went to beg to Zhao Kun instead. Clearly, she did not take his life or death to heart.

Or should he say, she never cared about what he thought at all?

Truly laughable!

These few people were really a real-life version of the story, The Farmer and the Viper, making people’s hearts go cold.[1]

Regardless of Ye Yuan’s attitude, he saved the three people’s three lives.

This was a fact!

But these Senior Apprentice Brother three people, not a single one was actually grateful to him.

The disciples that came out of Jadetrue Heavenly Sect really let Ye Yuan broaden his knowledge!

Zhao Kun swept a glance at Ye Yuan and could not help laughing as he said, “An ant, ask you to do what, you just have to do accordingly, what’s the use of asking for your opinion? I know that you’re skilled in spatial rule, but in front of me, any of your means is futile. Of course, if you put up a stubborn resistance, I have a thousand ways to make you submit obediently!?Uh,?almost forgot, you were provoking me earlier, right?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What did you say? A dog is barking; I can’t understand.”

Hiss?…

Ye Yuan’s provocation made everyone’s scalps tingle.

Nation Teacher’s gall was also too fat!

Already at this point, he was actually still so unyielding, wasn’t this looking for abuse?

Sure enough, Zhao Kun’s gaze turned sharp and he said with a cold smile, “Very good, looks like you’re really courting death! Since that’s the case, then I’ll grant your wish!”

The moment Zhao Kun’s imposing aura released, the powerful pressure crushed everyone once more.

He looked at Ye Yuan and said, “You probably don’t know that I’m famous for my movement technique in Jadetrue Heavenly Sect! You still want to show off in front of me with your little tricks?”

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not speak.

Zhao Kun was triggered by Ye Yuan’s smile. Snorting coldly, his figure instantly disappeared.

“V-Vanished!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Not vanished, it’s too fast! Fast until we can’t see!”

“This is also too heaven-defying, well-deserving of being Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s inner disciple!”

… …

Zhao Kun’s figure disappeared, immediately attracting a burst of exclamations.

Such a strange movement technique, they had really never seen before.

Cheng Chongshan looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Foolish thing, Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao cultivated the sect’s Celestial Immortal Deceptive Steps to an extremely profound realm. Even top ten powerhouses have a big headache when they clash with him!”

But right then, Ye Yuan suddenly scattered a handful of light-yellow powder into the air.

The moment the powder appeared, it scattered in the wind.

When Cheng Chongshan saw, he laughed even harder and said, “Hahaha … you aren’t a fool, right? Just based on this pile of powder, you want to deal with Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao?”

Dong!

His voice had yet to fade when a figure suddenly fell from the air.

Zhao Kun’s body fell to the ground heavily, twitching endlessly.

At this time, Zhao Kun’s face was contorted, like he was suffering from epilepsy, his mouth and eyes askew, twitching on the ground non-stop.

Cheng Chongshan’s eyeballs were almost popping out.

Everyone present had blank faces.

This … What happened?

A moment ago, Zhao Kun had an unstoppable momentum, as if nobody on earth could beat him.

In the next second, he was actually spasming?

Spasm … ing!

An Upper Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse was actually spasming!

“You … What the hell did you do to Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao?” Cheng Chongshan said in fear.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I already said, I opened the jade slips’ restrictions and learn some things from there, and refined this thing. This thing is called Windward Topple, you … should have heard of it before, right?”

Cheng Chongshan’s expression changed wildly and he cried out in shock, “W-Windward Topple! You … You actually learned Windward Topple! Damn it, then aren’t we …”

His voice had yet to fade when Cheng Chongshan’s mouth and eyes and went askew, his entire person suddenly started convulsing.

With a thud, he fell to the ground.

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

One powerhouse after another directly fell down, twitching on the ground.

Tang Yu and the rest were dumbfounded by it.

The sight of several hundred people toppling to the ground at the same time, eyes showing whites and twitching on the ground, was really too spectacular!
