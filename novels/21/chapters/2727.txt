Chapter 2733: Get Coquettish!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It’s fun now! With a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven taking action, that punk can’t be arrogant anymore, right?”

“It felt great when slapping faces, but the consequences are very severe!”

“He could have provoked others, but he had to provoke True Yang’s number one major sect, Seven-star Heavenly Sect. An ascender, really acting recklessly and blindly!”

… …

Seeing Tang Quan speak up, many people harbored the idea of gloating over others’ misfortune.

The vast majority present were all indigenous powerhouses. They were not welcoming to ascenders to begin with.

They naturally did not want Ye Yuan to ride on their heads.

Chen Tai’s eyes also narrowed and he said in a cold voice, “There’s actually such a thing? Boy, you actually dare to make a move against the Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s people on the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s territory! Kneel down now and apologize to Elder Tang. This sect can guarantee you from death!”

Lu Zhengxin was already dead. Jadetrue Heavenly Sect needed a powerful ally.

Seven-star Heavenly Sect was obviously the best ally.

Why would he care about the life and death of an ascender?

Befriending Tang Quan in this matter was naturally a great deal.

It was just that he did not know that the ones who killed Lu Zhengxin and plunged the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect into an unprecedented crisis, was precisely Ye Yuan and Big Yellow!

With Chen Tai making his stance known, it held tremendous weight.

With two great heavenly sects making their positions known at the same time, if Ye Yuan did not lower his head, there would be no place to shelter him in the True Yang Heavenly Domain anymore.

“Hey, boy, lower your head and admit your mistake! Looking on the account of Big Yellow’s face, I’ll come forward to mediate things for you in a while and preserve your cultivation. Presumably, they will still give me some face.”

Taoist Wu Fang already squeezed beside Ye Yuan without knowing when and whispered in his ear.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance rather surprisedly. He did not expect that this guy would actually say something like this.

Becoming enemies with two great heavenly sects at this time, at least one could tell that Taoist Wu Fang was a fanatic too.

For a prey that he was interested in, he could act regardless of the consequences.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “No need. Just these few trash, I haven’t taken them seriously yet.”

Taoist Wu Fang scoffed and said, “Boy, you’re also thinking too highly of yourself! You probably don’t know what half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven means! Furthermore, the Seven-star Heavenly Sect has more than just Tang Quan, one half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Being able to become True Yang’s number one heavenly sect, how could the Seven-star Heavenly Sect be underestimated?

Half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven was merely the standard for the sect.

Ye Yuan just smiled and looked at Chen Tai as he said, “Sect Master Chen’s warning earlier was very overbearing! These few days at Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, I discovered that the scenery at the back mountain is really not bad!”

As soon as these words came out, the others did not feel anything off, but Chen Tai’s head exploded with a bang.

Stormy waves immediately set off in his heart.

This was a warning!

What did he warn just now?

He was warning everyone using Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

Then what did the back mountain represent?

The Jadefork Peak was precisely the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s back mountain!

Linking these two points together, its meaning was already self-explanatory!

Ye Yuan was clearly saying this: your Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s Saint Sovereign Heaven is already dead, you’re still threatening people here?

Truly laughable!

Lu Zhengxin’s demise, this was absolutely a secret among secrets.

In the entire Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, only he and Head Elder two people knew about it.

Then how did Ye Yuan know?

There was only one possibility!

Lu Zhengxin’s demise had inescapable connections with Ye Yuan!

Having murdered someone, one should originally deal with things in a low-key manner.

But Ye Yuan actually hinted him in such a grand manner.

F*cking hell, too arrogant! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Chen Tai wished to immediately blow Ye Yuan up right now.

But he could not!

As long as Ye Yuan said it out, that Jadetrue Heavenly Sect currently no longer had a Saint Sovereign Heaven to hold down the fort, the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect would really be finished

Weren’t you still using Saint Sovereign Heaven to scare people just now?

Your Saint Sovereign Heaven isn’t even around anymore, still scaring people?

Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s crisis was about to arrive immediately!

Chen Tai’s entire body quivered, glaring at Ye Yuan angrily, virtually about to rampage.

This guy was telling him that he killed your Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, but you still wanted to use this to threaten him, this was simply shameless to the extreme.

Yet, he could not do anything to Ye Yuan!

How aggravating!

“Huhu,?Sect Master Chen, are you sure that … you want me to kneel down and admit my fault?” Ye Yuan looked at Chen Tai and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Chen Tai’s expression changed over and over again. Finally, he retreated to one side, having an appearance like it did not concern him.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them was dumbstruck with shock.

What happened?

That brat’s one sentence made Sect Master Chen stay a good distance away?

A heavenly sect’s sect master, that was definitely an overlord level existence.

If Saint Sovereign did not emerge, who could contend!

This kind of overlord was actually persuaded to withdraw by an unknown punk!

The shock in their hearts could be imagined.

Tang Quan’s brows furrowed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Sect Master Chen, what’s the meaning of this?”

Chen Tai drew a deep breath and said coolly, “There’s no meaning. This matter, my Jadetrue Heavenly Sect can’t intervene!”

Tang Quan’s expression changed and he said with a cold snort, “Very good! This Tang has had a taste of it!”

Chen Tai only felt bitterness in his mouth. He had offended the Seven-star Heavenly Sect now.

But he had no choice!

Choosing the lesser of two evils, he could only choose to offend the Seven-star Heavenly Sect.

“However, the people that my Seven-star Heavenly Sect wants to quell, we don’t need to borrow other people’s power at all! Boy, this elder will give you one last chance, kneel, or not?” Tang Quan looked at Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan looked at Tang Quan and said with a smile, “Yammering until now, isn’t it just for the sake of posturing? It’s just a pity that you found the wrong target!”

Tang Quan’s brows furrowed slightly, clearly already genuinely enraged.

He gave a cold snort and said, “Very good! It has already been many years since anyone dared to provoke my Seven-star Heavenly Sect! Today, this elder will kill the chicken to warn the monkeys!”

Finished talking, he took a step out, his imposing momentum terrifying to the extreme.

That appearance clearly already had half a foot stepped into Saint Sovereign Heaven.

“Seven-star Steps, Tiankui Palm! These are Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s two great unique skills! Looks like Elder Tang is genuinely enraged!”

“That boy, he doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Does he think that by bringing a chaos aberrant, he’s invincible under the heavens?”

“Haha,?young people, they always think that they are invincible under the heavens!”

… …

The moment Tang Quan made his move, the commotion was not what the average half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens could compare to.

The ultimate skills of Seven-star Heavenly Sect, those were all the True Yang Heavenly Domain’s pinnacle martial techniques.

The moment it debuted it was absolutely incomparably shocking.

But Ye Yuan was completely oblivious. He just smiled faintly and said, “Big Yellow, get coquettish!”

Big Yellow gave Ye Yuan a resentful look, his body suddenly started contorting.

“Master Ye, you’re making things very difficult for Big Yellow!”

While talk was talk, Big Yellow still unleashed the Coquettish Profligate Hoof!

“Pffft!”

Seeing a bull pose in a flirtatious and seductive manner, everyone simmered with laughter and burst out laughing.

This scene was seriously too comical.

Tang Quan’s Seven-star Steps was swift to the extreme.

In a blink of an eye, it arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

It was also right at this moment that Big Yellow unleashed his hoof!

This hoof seemed slow but was fast in reality, and it reached first despite launching later.

Bang!

Tang Quan’s face was directly kicked solidly by this hoof and he flew out.

The whole place was deathly silent!

No one expected that even when the half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven Tang Quan took action, it was still the same!
