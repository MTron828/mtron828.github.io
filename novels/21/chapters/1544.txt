Chapter 1548 Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill

Huang Qian’s entire body started trembling violently, golden blood seeping out from head to toe.

His entire person became a blood-person, looking incomparably savage, shaking people to the core.

This appearance looked too miserable.

However, rays of golden light emitted from Huang Qian’s whole body. He actually appeared extremely sacred.

This to and fro gave people an intense contrast, making everyone all somewhat uncertain what it meant.

They were all very curious what kind of medicinal pill Ye Yuan gave Huang Qian to eat.

“Ning Siyu, you can back away now. He’s about to go crazy. And you, suppress him. Don’t let him hurt people,” Ye Yuan said to Huang Haoran.

At this time, the expression on Huang Qian’s face was contorted, his entire person already on the verge of rampaging.

Huang Qian was an Origin Deity Realm powerhouse too, his strength not weak.

Once he rampaged, destructive power was still very great.

When Huang Haoran saw his nephew’s anguished expression, he had a look of worry.

“M-Master Ye, is he alright?” Huang Haoran asked worriedly.

At this very moment, he already completely tossed Wu Feng’s mission to the back of his mind.

Ye Yuan said calmly, “He got inflicted by an ancient strange poison called Purple Quill Marrow Extermination. The divine marrow in his entire body is already completely necrotic. His divine blood is also virtually crippled. Drag for another three to five months and his divine sense will be directly wiped out. The Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill can forcefully change his meridians and wash his marrow, replacing all of the divine blood in his whole body.”

Ning Siyu suddenly thought of something, opened her mouth wide, and cried out in shock, “Purple Quill Marrow Extermination! What he got inflicted with was actually the Purple Quill Marrow Extermination! I’ve always thought that this poison was just a legend. I didn’t think that it actually really exists!”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised as he said, “You know the Purple Quill Marrow Extermination?”

Ning Siyu’s eyes revealed a look of shock and she said, “I saw before sporadic records in a classic, saying that this poison is different from ordinary poison. The toxicity penetrates deep into the bone marrow and is capable of letting the divine blood all turn necrotic. There’s no cure at all! In the ancient era, many Four-star, Five-star, even higher realm Alchemy Gods have all attempted to overcome this poison, but nobody could do it at all! You ... You can really save him?”

This Ning Siyu was really surprising, to have actually even heard of this poison before.

But Ning Siyu’s words made everyone incredibly shocked.

Although divine rank poison had no comparison with mortal poison, the principle was the same, both aiming to destroy the martial artist’s physiological functions.

Even if martial artists broke through to Deity Realm, their physiological functions were also roughly the same as mortals.

Divine marrow created divine blood, divine blood feedback to divine marrow.

The recovery ability of Deity Realm powerhouses was extremely strong. Even if half of the body was destroyed, they could still recover.

But this required divine blood to rebuild the divine marrow.

However, if a kind of poison could penetrate deep into the marrow and kill all of the divine blood’s functions, then it would be powerless to save the situation.

Because if these divine blood already lost its activity, there was no way to regenerate at all.

This poison was extremely difficult to create. But once inflicted, it was also exceedingly difficult to remove.

One could say that there was no cure!

Purple Quill Marrow Extermination was this kind of poison.

Ye Yuan only confirmed this poison through Dustless. But Dustless was also at a loss on what to do against this poison. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Hearing Ning Siyu’s words, everyone sucked in a cold breath. Only then did they know the prowess that Huang Qian got inflicted with.

A poison that could destroy the bone marrow was absolutely incomparably terrifying.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “If my conjectures are right, Huang Qian should have been poisoned in some ancient ruins. At that time, he might not have taken it seriously. But after coming back, the moment the poison erupted, it became like this.”

Huang Haoran’s entire body trembled and he said with a nod, “Master Ye has the ability to divine the unknown. Huang Qian only became like this precisely after an expedition. But ... nobody could find the cause of his illness. I didn’t expect that he was actually inflicted with such a terrifying poison. Master, is ... is this Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill really useful?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Relax. If it’s useless, you can take away the 50 million. Actually, the spirit medicines that this medicinal pill requires, the value is already no less than 20 million. I only have this one portion on me. Charging you 50 million isn’t considered expensive.”

“Hiss ...”

Everyone all drew a cold breath. A rank three divine pill, just the cost was no less than 20 million. It could be seen how precious this medicinal pill was.

“Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill, it sounds like it’s going to replace all of Huang Qian’s divine marrow. Can this kind of thing ... really be done?”

“Not just changing the divine marrow, it also needs to change the blood! This kind of means is simply inconceivable!”

“Never heard of this medicinal pill before. But looking at Huang Qian’s appearance, it seems very agonizing. It wouldn’t be that the divine marrow fails to be changed and the person dies first, right?”

...

Changing marrow, this sort of thing, was simply unheard of.

This domain was already an incomprehensible existence to ordinary martial artists.

“ARGH!!”

Huang Qian suddenly let out a miserable scream, his entire person turning into an afterimage, rushing over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan seemed to have long predicted it. Pointing through the air, he directly tapped Huang Qian flying.

“Restrain him, don’t let him move. Take note, don’t touch his blood! There’s poison!” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

Huang Haoran’s expression changed, the aura on his body suddenly erupting, immediately firing out several beams of light, binding Huang Qian up.

Ye Yuan’s palm flipped, a pale-white flame immediately flew out.

Boom!

Huang Qian’s entire person turned into a fire person!

Huang Haoran got a huge shock and roared, “Master Ye, you ... What are you doing?!”

Ning Siyu’s gaze flickered and she said in a cold voice, “Shut up! Restrain him properly! His blood is highly toxic. If it isn’t purged cleanly, nobody will be spared here!”

Everyone’s faces changed, only realizing how terrifying this poison was.

One could say: death upon touch!

Ye Yuan did not answer, controlling the flame non-stop, purging all of the poisonous blood forced out of Huang Qian’s body.

No idea how long had passed either. Ye Yuan’s palm pulled back. The Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame on Huang Qian’s body receded like the tide.

Huang Haoran’s gaze turned intent, looking at Ye Yuan in incredible shock.

On Huang Qian’s body, there was actually not a trace of scorch mark at all!

“This ... What terrifying fire controlling arts!”

“Even though it’s a rank two divine fire, the temperature pushes straight to rank three divine fire. It actually ... didn’t even leave behind a trace of burn mark!”

“This really broadened my horizons today! Master Ye’s means are simply fantastical!”

“No wonder he dares to hang the will grant all requests signboard. I feel that this signboard isn’t exaggerated at all now!”

“However ... is he saved or not? Why do I feel that Huang Qian is no longer alive?”

...

Huang Qian had already thoroughly ceased breathing, lying on the ground and not moving at all.

But he was burned by the Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame for an hour and actually did not even leave behind any burn marks. This made everyone extremely amazed.

But currently, the aura on Huang Qian’s body was feeble to the extreme. Huang Haoran also did not know whether Huang Qian was saved or not.

But right then, powerful spiritual energy gathered from all directions with Huang Qian at the center.

Everyone opened their eyes wide, looking at this scene in disbelief.

This ... This was him going to break through?
