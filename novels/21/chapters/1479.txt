1483 Phantom Kill

This matter was settled like this!

The battle started!

Whoosh!

A black metal rod smashed down towards Ye Yuan’s head virtually without any sound of whistling through the air.

“So fast!”

“Starshine actually concealed his strength!”

“No, wait! The three of them all concealed their strengths!”

...

The overwhelming black metal rod was akin to the arm directing the fingers in Starshine’s hands.

The moment he attacked, it was earth-shattering!

This was a completely different concept from his performance earlier.

Regardless of whether speed, power, or laws comprehension, it was on a completely different level.

Not just Starshine, but that Hu Yan and Hu Luo, the two brothers, also suddenly erupted. The moment they made their move, they locked down Luo Qi and Pei Lan.

However, Starshine’s strength was undoubtedly the strongest among the three!

This rod strike, if it was his opponent just now, he would probably be able to make him explode in one move!

Those opponents previously, each and every one of them had lingering fear at this time.

Luckily, Starshine’s target was Ye Yuan. Otherwise, they would have long croaked at this time.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly and he revealed a mocking smile. Not retreating but advancing instead, his figure suddenly burst forth.

Clank!

A clear sound transmitted over. The tip of Ye Yuan’s sword tapped onto the metal rod accurately, sweeping away the metal rod.

A surge of vibration force transmitted from the end of the rod. Starshine only felt his arm go numb, the metal rod almost slipping out of his hand.

At this instant, Starshine was extremely shocked in his heart.

This sword looked simple, but in reality, the difficulty was extremely great.

He had faced-off with quite a few people who used swords before and had never seen before counterattacking him with this kind of method.

The metal rod was merely two fingers thick. Furthermore, the rod-body was round. Under such a quick situation, wanting to hit the metal rod, what kind of visual acuity and control was needed?

If there was the slightest mistake, one rod landed and it was the outcome was dying, one’s Dao vanishing.

This guy was simply a freak!

Clank! Clank! Clank!

A series of metal clashing sounds came over. In a blink, the two people exchanged several dozen moves and were actually evenly-matched!

Those household guards were all dumbfounded with shock.

“This Source Night indeed concealed his strength too!”

“A mere middle-level Two-star fiend general can actually perform to such an extent! Truly terrifying!”

“How the hell did this kid cultivate? Strength clearly isn’t strong, but combat power is so strong!”

...

But right then, Luo Qi and Pei Lan could not hold on anymore.

Under Hu Yan and Hu Luo’s powerful pressure, the two only had the ability to parry and not the strength to retaliate.

Only at this time did they realize why Starshine would propose that rule.

When they wanted to run away now, they could not do it at all! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I concede! I concede! I beg you, let me off!” Luo Qi bellowed.

Hu Yan grinned hideously and said, “Heh, it’s useless, die!”

“Puhwark!”

An iron first of Hu Yan’s directly smashed Luo Qi into a meat patty.

At virtually the same time, Pei Lan was killed by Hu Luo too.

With this, the situation changed drastically!

In the practicing field, it actually instantly became a three-versus-one situation!

Starshine, Hu Yan, Hu Luo, three people, assumed a triangle formation, surrounding Ye Yuan in the center, cutting off all of his escape routes.

“Heh, didn’t expect it right, kid? Those two fools actually still harbored the thoughts of getting lucky, think that they could escape alive. Actually, our goal right from the start is you! Now, we’re three-on-one, see where you run!” Starshine laughed loudly and said.

Ye Yuan looked at him like looking at a fool and said nonchalantly, “Who told you that I’m going to run?”

“Heh, punk, still want to put on a brave front? You are by yourself and still want to deal with the three of us?” Hu Yan laughed coldly.

“Fool who overestimates his own strength, do you really think that you’re invincible?” Hu Luo mocked.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Forever can’t communicate with fools.”

“Humph! Complacent fool who feels good about himself! Do you really think that you can defy the heavens? I’ll let you take a look at my true strength!” Starshine said with a cold smile.

“Demons and Monsters Pandemonium!”

Starshine shouted with countless rodd images greeting Ye Yuan.

This was already the power of laws of Rod Dao third-layered heaven. It could virtually sweep across those in the same rank.

Now, using it to deal with a middle-level Two-star Fiend General could be said to be overkill.

At the same time, Hu Yan and Hu Luo, two people, also made a move at the same time!

For a moment, the violent spiritual energy undulations turned the practicing field upside down.

Ye Yuan was as weak as a small rowboat under the three people’s joint-attacks!

When Ka Xin saw this scene, a hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of his mouth.

He did not feel that Ye Yuan could survive under these three people’s pincer attack.

“Heh, my good little sister, next time, Big Brother will find you a good one next time. This punk touched my reverse scale, so I must kill him!” Ka Xin’s gaze looked toward Li Ji and he said in a solemn voice.

Seeing Li Ji’s nervous appearance, a hint of delight flashed across in Ka Xin’s heart.

He had always been paying attention to Li Ji. In the beginning, he discovered that he seemed to really have misunderstood Li Ji.

But later, Li Ji’s gaze when looking at Ye Yuan became more and more infatuated. This made him have a feeling of shooting himself in the foot.

Therefore, Ye Yuan must die!

Lian Hua said with an indifferent look, “I’m still alright. Rather, Li Ji’s there, so you’ll probably be unable to bear the consequences.”

Ka Xin’s face turned dark and he said, “This matter will slowly fade in the future. But if that brat is still alive, that’s the biggest threat!”

At this time, Starshine three people’s attacks were launched at the same time!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Countless attacks landed where Ye Yuan stood, virtually shattering that region of space.

Powerful undulations seeped out of the array formation, making everyone feel waves of shock.

This was a true expert!

Too strong!

“It’s over. This magnitude of attack, even a half-step Fiend Commander probably can’t block it too, right?”

“Source Night is definitely deader than dead. Completely can’t sense his undulations.”

“Pity about a genius, who asked him to offend His Highness Ka Xin?”

...

A wave of sympathy came from all of the household guards. This Source Night was undoubtedly a genius. It was too bad that he did not know how to weigh and consider the situation, offending the powerful His Highness Ka Xin.

Death was also something within expectations.

Ka Xin looked at the practicing field with a cloud of smoke floating over it, a hint of a smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.

But right at this time, a voice sounded out in everyone’s ear akin to a voice transmitting out from hell.

“Chasing Moon ... Phantom Kill!”

Starshine’s gaze turned intent, revealing a look of astonishment!

Puu, puu, puu ...

But he had yet to have time to be shocked yet and was no longer conscious anymore.

Several whistling sounds came successively in the practicing field. Then Starshine three people’s bodies directly exploded.

Ye Yuan’s body slowly appeared, still standing on the spot, as if he had never moved.

Ye Yuan was completely unscathed. It was just that his complexion appeared rather pale, the fiend energy on his body also dissipated considerably.

But his opponents were already deader than dead.

“What happened just now? Did ... Did you guys see?”

“No! I didn’t see anything!”

“Fast! Too fast! What a swift sword art!”

...

Everyone all changed countenance visibly, totally not seeing clearly what happened just now.

Ye Yuan slowly walked out of the practicing field, came before Ka Xin, and said with a faint smile, “Many thanks for Your Highness Ka Xin’s reward.”
