Chapter 2878 Blood Pool!

Nine hundred sons candidates had just killed their way out of heavy encirclement and were currently fired up with boundless enthusiasm.

In the blink, they were gone!

“Impressive! Really impressive! Is this guy insane?”

“Doesn’t he know that once these hundred sons candidates get a spot, it’s equivalent to being protected by the Blood God Temple and having a death-exemption gold token?”

“It’s going to blow up big this time! The Blood God Temple probably won’t be willing to drop the matter!”

“Tsk tsk, this kind of thing is really the first time in the history of the hundred sons selection!”

......

Everyone was stunned by Ye Yuan’s shocking action.

These candidates had already gotten a spot. It was equivalent to being the Blood God Temple’s disciples.

But Ye Yuan actually killed all of them!

Then, could Bloodsword not stop Ye Yuan?

Of course he could!

But he did not.

Bloodsword smiled coldly and said, “Boy, you’re really arrogant until the horizon! But this time, this seat wants to see who can save

you!”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes at Bloodsword and said disdainfully, “Put away your little petty tricks! You’re unable to understand the world of the strong! If these trash go to the Blood God Temple, they will merely make a fool of themselves. It’s enough for Giant Net City to have me alone!”

“Well said!”

A figure stepped out into the air. His aura was actually a little more powerful than Bloodsword two people.

But Bloodsword’s expressions changed drastically.

He thought that Lord Blood Envoy would punish Ye Yuan severely.

Who knew that he actually said “well said”! Blood Envoy looked at Ye Yuan, his eyes making no effort to hide the admiration in the slightest as he said, “Boy, this seat likes you very much!”

With one sentence, it shocked everyone again!

Blood Envoy looked at Bloodsword and said coolly, “Bloodsword, you disappoint this envoy greatly! The improvement in cultivation realm has already made you lose your original heart! Back then, you came from the hundred sons too. At that time, you were decisive in going for the kill and was also extremely stunning! But the sharp edge on you has been ground flat. Have you forgotten our blood race’s original intention of choosing the hundred sons?”

His gaze swept over the faces of Yang Qing and the others, and he said in a solemn voice, “My blood race isn’t afraid of death. What we’re afraid of is that you’re not strong enough! Only the strong have the right to survive! Weaklings can only be eliminated! Bloodazure’s talent is the strongest that this seat has seen! Do you think that this seat will punish Bloodazure for a group of useless trash? Ridiculous! What he said was right. It’s sufficient for Giant Net City to have him alone!”

The whole place was silent. Many people lowered their heads in shame.

Bloodsword’s old face felt even more ashamed.

Where was the agreed upon face-slapping?

Why did he get slapped?

But Yang Qing laughed wildly in his heart when he heard it. Where did this moron come from?

Was it really alright for you to support that guy like that?

When you all discover that the one that you all were supporting was actually a human, would you go berserk at that time or not?

Even thinking about it felt a little exciting!

Yang Qing was currently very much looking forward to the arrival of that day.

Ye Yuan this fellow was too capable at causing trouble!

“Alright. Since the selection is already done, the 11 of you head to Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City with this seat then!”

Arriving at Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City, even if it was Ye Yuan, he was also amazed by it. This city was really too big and too grand! He could feel that the city walls were made of extremely high quality treasures, giving off waves of extremely terrifying auras. Although Ye Yuan could not feel the array formation in the city, he felt that this city absolutely had an extremely terrifying destructive power!

South Qi Giant City was utterly not worth mentioning in front of Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City.

This Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City was probably built by the blood race pouring their power in!

Even if a Hegemon Realm came, it was likely very hard to conquer this city too!

“Lord Owlfly, Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City’s city seems to be a little different!” Ye Yuan pretended to be curious.

These hundred sons candidates were all like country bumpkins entering a city for the first time too. They were naturally deeply shocked by the grandeur of Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City too.

ver

Therefore, upon Ye Yuan asking, they all immediately perked their ears to listen.

Owlfly said coolly, “You just know that even if a Hegemon Realm came to this city, they will have to die with regrets too! No need to ask about the rest! This is our blood race’s secret. When your cultivation realm is up to par, you’ll naturally know!” When Ye Yuan heard, his heart turned slightly cold!

Indeed as expected!

However, this was pretty good news too.

If one day, some Hegemon Realm went crazy and ran over to attack Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City, then they would really suffer a cataclysmic disaster.

Although the blood race did not understand Formation Dao, there must be some hidden means too.

It was just that the blood race was too mysterious. Many things were not known by outsiders.

“Alright. After entering the city, don’t run around. Some places are not where you guys can go! I’ll order someone to explain this to you. You all are powerhouses who killed your way out of tens of thousands of people and are all seeded candidates for the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons too. As a reward, you all can enter the Heaven Absolute Blood Pool and cultivate for ten days! As for how much improvement you can make, that will depend on your potential!” Blood Envoy Owlfly said.

The blood race had a very superficial understanding of Alchemy Dao.

But they similarly had their own cultivation methods.

Blood pools were one of them!

The blood race studied blood extremely deeply.

Devouring blood was just the most primitive method!

The blood race had a profession called blood medicine master.

Like heavenly alchemists, they would use some secret techniques to mix with blood, letting the blood unleash very miraculous power for the clansmen to absorb.

The blood race would create blood pools and pour these formulated blood in, which would be the blood pools.

However, this kind of method was extremely bloody.

The construction of blood pools required extremely terrifying amounts of blood.

They occupied two continents. All races were enslaved by them.

Hence, the blood race slaughtered construct powerhouses to build one blood pool after another.

The sins that they had committed were too numerous to be recorded! There was a blood pool in Giant Net City too. But, compared to Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City, it naturally could not be mentioned in the same breath. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Furthermore, Ye Yuan knew that the blood race’s best blood pool was in the Blood God Temple!

The final reward of the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons was to enter the Blood God Temple’s blood pool!

This was absolutely a huge reward to the bloodkins!

When these Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons entered, it would even let them undergo a transformation to remold themselves thoroughly!

Watching Ye Yuan and the others enter the blood pool, the corners of Owlfly’s mouth curled slightly.

With this boy’s character, he would probably cause a huge wave again after entering the blood pool, right?

However, the more trouble he caused, the better!

Otherwise, how would it show this seat’s prowess?

Blood envoys monitored the world!

But he, this blood envoy, was just monitoring a measly little Heaven One Continent.

Thundercry Continent and Lastingwind Continent’s blood envoys were the real people in power!

Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons actually had little to do with Heaven One Continent.

It was because the people that Owlfly brought over every time were basically all cannon fodder characters.

Lastingwind Continent and Thundercry Continent had 99 Blood Emperor level cities respectively. There were three great blood envoys.

Of the seven great envoys, he was getting along the most poorly!

But this time, Ye Yuan made his eyes lit up!

This boy was not a well-known figure, but he amazed the world with a single brilliant feat!

Furthermore, he was very optimistic about Yang Qing’s strength too!

Two Bloodazures, this was his capital to win back face!

This time, it was finally Your Father’s turn to turn things around, right?
