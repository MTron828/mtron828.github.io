Chapter 2603: Limit State!

“How is this possible? He … He comprehended three rules too!”

“Three kinds of rules! Among them even included spatial rule, this kind of heaven-defying rule!”

“Sword, space, formation, three great rules fusing into one; it’s only stronger and not weaker when compared to Changsun Xingyu’s three rules!”

… …

Resplendent Sun City’s powerhouses fell into deep shock at this time.

Ye Yuan’s trump card was really formidable until it gave people chills.

Changsun Xingyu fusing life and death rules into his saber intent was already one-in-a-million.

Who would have expected that Ye Yuan was even more freakish, to actually fuse spatial rule and Formation Dao rule into Sword Dao!

This kind of talent was simply defying the heavens!

They finally understood why Ye Yuan was so calm. He really had the capital to be composed.

“This … How is this possible? Spatial rule, just comprehending it is already extremely difficult, he can actually … fuse it into Sword Dao?”

He Yunxiang’s face was full of shock, almost not daring to believe everything that he saw in front of him.

He expected that Ye Yuan had hidden strength. But, in his view, even if he hid his strength, it was impossible to be Changsun Xingyu’s match too.

After all, being able to cultivate life and death rules to Changsun Xingyu’s level of boundary was too rare.

But who knew that Ye Yuan was even more heaven-defying than Changsun Xingyu!

Only at this time did he know that he already overestimated Ye Yuan as much as possible before, but it was still not enough!

He Yunxiang could not help secretly somewhat rejoicing in his heart.

If he really provoked Ye Yuan back then, then the one who was dead would be him.

Beside him, Di Xing had a blank look too as he murmured, “Old He, I owe you a big favor this time! Otherwise, I fear that I’d already become a corpse!”

Changsun Xingyu could not help feeling a fiery burn on his face.

He boasted too much earlier. Now, he really could not quite get off the stage.

What I’ll only unleash one saber cut!

What I’ll leave you with an intact corpse!

Looking at it now, it was really a joke!

Changsun Xingyu was not a fool, he guessed that Ye Yuan had some reliance too.

But he completely did not think that Ye Yuan’s trump card was actually so heaven-defying!

Turning angry from embarrassment, his fury already billowed straight to the sky.

“Heh,

?very good! I didn’t expect that there’s actually still someone who dares to make fun of me, Changsun Xingyu! Do you think that by fusing three kinds of power of rules, you can be invincible under the heavens? Then I’ll tell you today, where the might of the Land of Exile lies!”

Boom!

Under his fury, Changsun Xingyu’s saber intent climbed to a new level!

Previously, he had the intention of humiliating Ye Yuan. So it looked scary, but actually, he did not use his full strength.

Now, he exerted at least 80% of his strength in one go!

This saber slashing over, it was domineering!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, the Universe Sword Formation directly greeted it!

Looking down on the opponent tactically, showing regard to your opponent strategically.

Ye Yuan was still very cautious about Changsun Xingyu.

This guy was one of the few guys who could arouse his fighting intent.

In the same realm, there were not many people who could fuse three great power of rules the same as him!

Furthermore, in the outside world, even if the opponent fused three kinds of power of rules, they were most likely not his match too.

But this place was the Land of Exile!

Each of the powerhouses here was veterans of a hundred battles!

Their fighting instinct was powerful to the extreme! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Let alone that Changsun Xingyu’s cultivation realm was even higher than his.

Such an opponent was precisely what Ye Yuan longed for!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

The two people came and went, each blow was astonishing.

With lessons learned from the past, the powerhouses of Resplendent Sun City long already avoided far away, fearful of being affected.

Changsun Xingyu was indeed worthy of being Resplendent Sun City’s number one person, each of his moves was stronger than the last!

Life and death saber intent, life with one thought, death with one thought!

Life and death were governed by him.

Furthermore, his saber technique was not like those greenhouse flower saber techniques, it could be said that each saber cut was deadly!

Changsun Xingyu’s saber technique was not the slightest bit sloppy, each saber cut was brilliant to the max!

His saber only had one objective, which was to kill!

The first few saber cuts, Ye Yuan could still barely manage to hold out.

But the more towards the back, the pressure that Ye Yuan withstood grew greater and greater. The entire sword formation even showed signs of being hacked apart.

After ten saber cuts, Ye Yuan already sustained considerable injuries!

His Universe Sword Formation was challenged by a powerhouse of the same rank for the first time!

“Brat, why did you become a mute? Weren’t you very arrogant just now? Not leaving me an intact corpse, with just the likes of you?” Changsun Xingyu laughed wildly as he said.

He was genuinely enraged by Ye Yuan’s words.

At this time, he only wanted to doom Ye Yuan to death.

Although Ye Yuan’s Universe Sword Formation had no weakness to exploit, under this kind of powerful attack, Ye Yuan’s innards were injured!

He had a stifled breath blocked at his throat area and was naturally unable to talk.

Actually, when Ye Yuan fused fast and slow Sword Dao, the Universe Sword Formation’s power already increased greatly.

As far as power of rule was concerned, he was only stronger and not weaker than Changsun Xingyu.

But this kind of might was still inadequate to make up for the gap in cultivation realm!

Under this kind of limit state, even a tiny difference in cultivation realm was fatal.

Seeing this scene, He Yunxiang could not help shaking his head and sighing as he said, “What a shame! If Ye Yuan could reach grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, Changsun Xingyu would definitely be defeated! This gap of a minor cultivation realm is fatal!”

Di Xing said, “This boy was too hasty! Who among the Land of Exile’s top powerhouses aren’t grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum? This guy came to challenge with the gap of a minor cultivation realm; it’s really courting death!”

He Yunxiang smiled bitterly and said, “This boy’s talent is really strong! It’s just a pity that he’s too young and aggressive! He still understands too little about the Land of Exile’s cruelty!”

The other people’s thoughts were pretty much the same as He Yunxiang’s.

They were all lamenting that Ye Yuan should not have been so cocky to show off.

The talent made them jump in fright.

But the final outcome could not be changed.

In this place, defeat was death!

Ye Yuan did not care about other people’s views, this was precisely the state that he wanted!

At this time, he was already not holding back at all!

All of his strength had already been brought out, without any trump cards left.

He was already backed into a corner.

Of course, he had poison in his hands and could easily kill Changsun Xingyu.

But Changsun Xingyu’s attacks grew greater than the previous wave. Ye Yuan did not have the chance to use poison at all.

This kind of battle with extremely close strength, even if there was the slightest diverting of attention, it would be fatal.

Therefore, he could only break through!

Under this kind of limit state, not breaking through would be death!

The current Changsun Xingyu was just like the Ye Yuan inside the Death Cultivation Space back then.

It was just that that mirror image was dead.

But Changsun Xingyu was alive!

No matter how transcendent the mirror image mimicked, it was also impossible to fully replicate a person’s consciousness.

In terms of changes, he was not as good as Ye Yuan in the end.

Therefore, Ye Yuan won every time.

However, Changsun Xingyu would not give Ye Yuan any chance.

The situation at present was even more perilous than at that time!

But Ye Yuan gladly endured the hardship!

He had always been a mad man. Refining pills was like so, cultivating the martial path was the same.

Under Changsun Xingyu’s frenzied suppression, every cell in Ye Yuan’s body was activated.

His entire being entered a mysterious realm!
