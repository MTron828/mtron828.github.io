Chapter 2676: Your Men Are Actually My Men!

“Paying respects to Third Hall Master!”

At Calm South City, when Huang Haoyan and Su Peiyun saw Ye Yuan, they bowed respectfully.

Ye Yuan handed the Heavenly South Pill Hall’s affairs over to the Song and Yun, two families, as well as Cui Tong to manage, while he set off for Thistle South Sea Region.

He entered the transmission array in Heavenly South City and arrived at Calm South City, and was setting out to sea from here.

Presently, Ye Yuan’s status was extraordinary. Calm South City naturally did not dare to be neglectful.

It was just that, when they saw Ye Yuan alone coming out, they were still a little surprised.

“Master Ye, you’re actually setting out to sea alone this time?” Huang Haoyan said in surprise.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The sea race views humans as the enemy. If I bring people over, wouldn’t it be delivering lambs into the tiger’s maws?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Huang Haoyan said, “But if you go over like this and the Black Flood Dragon King has the intention of harming you, what to do about it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How can harming me be that easy?”

Huang Haoyan’s gaze flickered and he gritted his teeth and said, “Master Ye, although Haoyan’s strength is lacking, I’m willing to accompany you! If anything really happens, even delaying for a short while is good too.”

“If something really happens, how can you block for a short while? Alright, I have a score in my heart; you guys don’t need to send me off anymore.”

Ye Yuan waved his hand, and his figure leaped, already being half a mile away.

Huang Haoyan’s brows furrowed slightly and said, “Peiyun, do you feel that Master Ye is behaving a little strangely?”

Su Peiyun nodded and said, “He’s indeed a little strange!”

“Let’s follow and take a look!” Huang Haoyan said.

… …

Leaving Calm South City, Ye Yuan headed south all the way, his speed extremely fast.

Huang Haoyan, these two Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratums, actually could not quite catch up.

But as soon as they chased after, the two people found it even more odd.

Ye Yuan did not walk on the main road but headed to a remote place.

The more he walked, the fewer the people.

Suddenly, the two of their expressions changed.

In the mountain range’s dense woods, eight figures suddenly dashed out, blocking Ye Yuan’s path.

Huang Haoyan’s expression changed wildly, and he cried out in surprise, “It’s Deputy City Lord Ironcore and Min Nanshan! They … What gall they have, to actually want to kill Master Ye! No way! I have to go save him!”

He was just about to act but was held back by Su Peiyun.

Huang Haoyan said anxiously, “Peiyun, what are you doing? Those are eight Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses! Ironcore and Min Nanshan are even peak Jade Sovereign Heaven mighty experts!”

Su Peiyun’s face fell and she berated, “Shut up for me! You know that those are eight Jade Sovereign Heaven experts too! What can you do to change the situation?”

Huang Haoyan said with a cold snort, “This life of mine was saved by Master Ye! What’s wrong with returning it to him?”

Su Peiyun had a look of anger from his failure to live up to expectations and whispered, “Are you stupid? Why did Master Ye specifically go to a remote area along the way? Why didn’t he stop in Calm South City at all and directly set out to sea?”

Huang Haoyan was taken aback. Finally, he was no longer agitated and said in surprise, “You’re saying that Master Ye did it on purpose? He … He knows that Ironcore and Min Nanshan want to kill him, and he deliberately lured them you? He has a contingency plan?”

Su Peiyun rolled her eyes at him and said, “Who is Master Ye? He could repel the entire Thistle South sea race by himself. So how could he stumble at this sort of thing? Let’s watch first. If it really doesn’t work, it won’t be too late to take action then!”

Over there, Ironcore looked at Ye Yuan with a smug face as he smiled and said, “Ye Yuan, didn’t expect that we’d meet here, right?!”

A faintly perceptible smile hung on Ye Yuan’s face and he said, “If I say that I thought of it?”

Ironcore was taken aback and laughed loudly and said, “Boy, death is knocking at the door and you’re still forcing yourself to be calm? It’s no use, you must die today!”

Min Nanshan stood with his hands behind his back and looked at Ye Yuan like looking at a dead person as he said coldly, “Ye Yuan, you caused my Min Family to live a life worse than death. Today, it’s time for retribution!”

These two people had also heard about it. Ye Yuan was not easy to deal with.

Therefore, they were very careful, directly bringing six Jade Sovereign Heaven experts.

It was to make sure that there was no danger of anything going wrong.

Mobilizing eight Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses to deal with a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, it was an act probably unprecedented in the Land of Heavenly South.

Furthermore, none of these eight was a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven expert!

These people were middle Jade Sovereign Heavens at the worst too.

Ironcore and Min Nanshan themselves were grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven super powerhouses.

Ye Yuan was indifferent as he smiled and said, “Let me guess. From Heavenly South Pill Hall, only Cui Tong, Wu Dao, and Ji Chun, these three elders, know that I came out, as well as Song Tianyang and Yun Baiyu. Song Tianyang and Yun Baiyu have long already broken away from you guys. Cui Tong enjoys a high prestige and commands universal respect, while Wu Dao is an alchemy fanatic and is disdainful to be associated with you guys. Which is also to say that, your source of information is Ji Chun.”

Ye Yuan took his time to analyze. Ironcore and Min Nanshan two people’s expressions changed wildly.

Could it be that this boy knew about it a long time ago?

But, if he knew, why would he still walk right into the trap?

Ye Yuan guessed it completely right. Ji Chun was originally the inside man that Ironcore planted in Heavenly South Pill Hall.

It was just that this layer of relationship was very secretive, no one knew about it at all.

There were some who knew that Ye Yuan would be going out to sea.

But no one knew the specifics of when Ye Yuan would leave.

This time, Ye Yuan came out very low-key, there were only those few people who knew.

As long as he analyzed it a little, he would know.

Ironcore smiled coldly and said, “So what if you know? Could it be that you, by yourself, can escape from our hands?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Who told you that I came alone?”

When Ironcore and the rest heard that, their expressions changed wildly!

However, they sensed carefully, there was no aura of any powerhouses in the vicinity at all.

Ironcore could not help turning angry from embarrassment and said, “Punk, you were messing with us?”

But Min Nanshan smiled coldly and said, “Ye Yuan, I’ll give you the chance. Call your men out!”

Ye Yuan looked at the two and still smiled calmly as he said, “Do you all think that I only know that it’s Ji Chun after I saw you guys? I think that you guys are mistaken. Ironcore, do you know why I specially chose to go to remote places after I went out of the city? Do you know why I left Heavenly South City by myself?”

The more Ye Yuan said, the more alarmed Ironcore two people became.

Yeah, all these did not make sense!

Ye Yuan smiled as he continued, “If I say that I deliberately leaked the news to make you all pursue me, will you all believe me or not? If I say that your men are actually my men, will you be very angry?”

“Bullshit! Ji Chun is this city lord’s man! He absolutely won’t betray me!” Ironcore said angrily.

Ye Yuan still smiled as he said, “That’s in the past. Now, he’s my man already!”

In this one year, the transformation that Ye Yuan brought to Heavenly South Pill Hall could be said to be turning it upside down.

In the wake of Ye Yuan running the Heavenly South Pill Hall solid as a metal bucket, all kinds of problems also gradually surfaced.

Ji Chun was one of them.

Actually, how could Ironcore be the only one who planted chess pieces in Heavenly South Pill Hall?

Three great families as well as those major and minor noble families, even the various major city lords, which one did not want to get a share of the loot in Heavenly South Pill Hall?

But what Ye Yuan brought to Heavenly South Pill Hall was what others could never give!

Ye Yuan had long detected Ji Chun’s abnormality, but he did not execute Ji Chun. Instead, he guided Ji Chun on cultivation.

Because he discovered that Ji Chun was someone who yearned for Dao too!

He had always been waiting, waiting for Ji Chun to come out himself!

Sure enough, not long ago, Ji Chun confided to Ye Yuan.
