Chapter 1506 Not Presentable If Lower Than Heaven-Grade!

“Yeah, it’s fine that you offended Master Source Night yourself. But don’t harm us!”

“Quickly go, quickly go! We’ve already waited for Master Source Night for half a month. Want to die, die yourself! Don’t drag us into the water!”

“I’m still waiting for Master Source Night to refine pills to save lives. Still not getting lost, I’ll fight it out with you!”

At this time, inside the Fiend Medicine Hall was packed with people. Everyone all turned the spearhead at Kong Xiao.

Kong Xiao discovered that he seemed to have become a rat crossing the street, everyone yelling to beat.

Especially Wu Hao and Metalheart, the two people’s attitudes. It made him burn even more with rage.

These two people wanted to step on him to get into Source Night’s good graces!

He discovered that he really seemed to not be able to stay on anymore.

Continue to thicken his face and stay on, he would be flayed and swallowed alive by these people.

“The two of you, I’ve remembered you! Go then, who’s afraid of whom? Humph! I don’t believe that listening to this kid’s sermon, one can still ascend to heaven?”

Done talking, Kong Xiao left resentfully.

He originally thought that he was, at any rate, a Three-star Fiend Apothecary, a Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master, that Ye Yuan would more or less give some face. Who knew that this brat did not give any face at all.

In front of so many people, this face was completely lost.

Regarding this little interlude, Ye Yuan did not take it to heart at all.

He had his own pride. This kind of pride was not allowed to be blasphemed.

Since Kong Xiao desecrated his glory as an alchemist, he would have to bear the corresponding consequences.

“Next, starting the pill refinement!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Other masters refining pills had all kinds of requirements. Ye Yuan did not.

As long as you did not rush up to make trouble, even if you made a racket below, it was no problem too.

This was everyone’s first time watching Master Source Night refine pills. Each and every one of them held their breaths, looking rather excited.

Although Ye Yuan did not request for it, inside the Fiend Medicine Hall was incomparably quiet at this time. Even if a needle fell on the ground, it could be heard clearly.

Only when Ye Yuan refinished refining the first medicinal pills did those Fiend Apothecaries abruptly wake up.

“This ... It’s done?”

Wu Hao blinked a few times, looking somewhat not quite daring to believe it.

This was a low-level Two-star divine pill. The majority of the people present could refine it.

But from the beginning of the refinement until now, merely two hours had passed!

Wasn’t this too quick?

Yi Mo and the rest had clearly long been accustomed to it and said smugly, “Otherwise? Do you think that I’ll call just any person my master? Ordinary Two-star divine pills, Master Source Night doesn’t take more than two hours to refine. Those a little harder wouldn’t surpass six hours either.”

Wu Hao’s eyes went wide and he said in disbelief, “No way, right? This ... This is also too exaggerated! What about the quality?”

Yi Mo smiled and said, “Won’t you know if you take a look?”

At this time, Ye Yuan opened the furnace, the pill formed.

That person who requested for the pill flushed red, incomparably agitated.

Although the medicinal pill was not out yet, he was not worried about the medicinal pill’s quality at all.

Ye Yuan’s palm shook, the medicinal pill flew out and landed in the jade container lightly.

The gazes of Wu Hao and the rest turned intent, looking at the medicinal pill with unbelievable shock.

Divine-grade!

My God, two hours to refine a divine-grade divine pill!

Are my eyes blurry?

It was not just him alone who was shocked. The exclamations in the hall rose one after another, clearly all being stunned by Ye Yuan’s alchemy skills.

Ye Yuan’s pill refinement was too profound. They could not understand at all and only felt a surge of Dao accumulations revolving around the pill furnace.

However, they could understand the medicinal pill’s grade!

A Two-star Fiend Apothecary refined a divine-grade divine pill in two hours. This was simply inconceivable.

Divine-grade medicinal pills were normally all high-rank Fiend Apothecaries refining low-level medicinal pills before there was a certain chance of being refined.

Just the level of these fiend race Fiend Apothecaries, for a Three-star Fiend Apothecary to be able to refine a One-star divine pill to divine-grade, he could already burn incense and worship the Gods.

Two-star divine-grade divine pills, one wouldn’t even think about it!

“Divine-grade divine pill! It’s actually a divine-grade divine pill! I’ve never seen before a Two-star divine-grade divine pill in my life before!” exclaimed a Two-star Fiend Apothecary.

Those martial artists waiting for the pill refinement gave him a glance using a look for looking at a fool, and said, “The medicinal pills that Master Source Night refines, he’s too embarrassed to present it if lower than heaven-grade. What are you all making such a big fuss for? Getting excited about a commonplace thing!”

“Yeah! That was a Three-star Fiend Apothecary who was chased out earlier, right? That guy must be an idiot. That’s why he would offend Master Source Night! Three-star Fiend Apothecaries also have to obediently call him as a teacher when arriving in front of Master Source Night!” said another person.

“L-Lower than heaven-grade, can’t present it?”

The corners of that Two-star Fiend Apothecary’s mouth twitched. He had never refined heaven-grade divine pills before in this lifetime.

No, wait, never even refined superior-grade before!

Those Capone Fiend Medicine Hall’s Fiend Apothecaries had clearly become accustomed to this scene long ago. They did not feel that there was anything wrong.

Rather, if Ye Yuan really refined a heaven-grade medicinal pill, only then, would they get a surprise.

Wu Hao and Metalheart two people exchanged a glance, both seeing the astonishment from the other’s eyes.

Although they had long known that Master Source Night was very impressive, being impressive to this sort of degree still made them too surprised.

Just looking at the pill refinement process earlier, Master Source Night was a person from a completely different world than them!

As a Three-star Fiend Apothecaries, they actually could not understand a Three-star Fiend Apothecary’s pill refinement!

In front of Ye Yuan, they were like mortals who did not know how to cultivate, watching immortals soar into the sky and tunnel into the earth.

Knew that the other party was impressive, but just how impressive, they could not understand at all!

At this instant, they were extremely delighted to have drawn a clear line with Kong Xiao.

Missing the sermon this time, they would regret it for life!

“Next!” Ye Yuan said indifferently.

That martial artist who received the medicinal pill previously expressed a thousand thanks and left. The next one brought his own spirit medicines and pill formula over.

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of resting in the slightest, directly starting to refine.

Wu Hao and the rest immediately held their breaths, watching Ye Yuan refine pills without shifting their gazes, fearing of missing any detail.

Divine-grade!

Divine-grade!

Still divine-grade!

Half a day, the people who came to watch and learn were all dumbstruck with amazement.

Seeing the expressions on these people’s faces, Capone Fiend Medicine Hall’s fiend apothecaries all revealed an understanding slight smile on each and every one of their faces.

Only a short while ago, they were like these people too; extremely shocked.

But as time passed, they had long become numb.

Master Source Night’s pill refinement level was not what they could imagine at all.

It was precisely because of so that Capone Fiend Medicine Hall would revere Ye Yuan like a god from top to bottom.

In the evening, Ye Yuan slowly got up and said, “Let’s call it a day here. Continue tomorrow.”

Everyone all stood up respectfully, automatically opening up a path, saluting with their eyes, seeing Ye Yuan away with their gazes.

“Marvelous work of art! Simply a marvelous work of art! Turns out that a marvelous work of art can still be refined like this!” Wu Hao sighed with admiration.

“This trip wasn’t in vain! This trip wasn’t in vain! This trip is really worth it! Sigh, really envious of you all, able to watch Master Source Night refine pills every day!” Metalheart said with a look of endless envy.

“No wonder each and every one of you, your strength improved by leaps and bounds. With Master Source Night teaching, you all are killing us with envy!” said another Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master.
