Chapter 1698 Preserve Your Little Life

Outside Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, eight great Celestial Deity powerhouses stood in the air.

The great battle had yet to start and the commotion was already monstrous.

In the distance, there were already countless Heavenly Eagle powerhouses surrounding and watching, being stunned by this powerful line-up.

Celestial Deity powerhouses, they normally could not even see one. Today, they saw eight all at once, as well as the inspector! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Zuo Shujie, prepare to suffer my wrath! Today, you must die!”

Qiao Anshan had a furious look. Today’s situation already completely stepped out of his control.

The reason why he dared to activate the Golden Sword Pact was that Utmost Peace Imperial City’s Celestial Deity Realms were powerful.

But now, both sides were actually evenly-matched!

This fight, the variables were too great.

However, as long as he could kill Zuo Shujie, everything could end.

The Golden Sword Token was already issued, Qiao Anshan did not have any way out as well. Either you die or I perish!

Zuo Shujie smiled coldly and said, “That will have to depend on whether you have this ability or not!”

Qiao Anshan snorted coldly, the aura on his body releasing fully. Zuo Shujie’s expression could not help changing.

“This guy, his aura grew a lot stronger again! Looks like he’s already very close to a third-layered heaven Celestial Deity!”

Zuo Shujie’s strength was still some distance away from peak second-layered heaven Celestial Deity.

There was a massive difference in strength between each minor realm of the Celestial Deity Realm.

Even each minor realm was also accumulated over countless years.

Qiao Anshan’s strength had always been half a notch stronger than Zuo Shujie.

But moving out this time, Qiao Anshan’s strength seemed to be much stronger again!

If without the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, this battle was really fraught with grim possibilities.

Upon thinking of the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, Zuo Shujie was shocked in his heart again.

Because the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain was already thoroughly refined by Ye Yuan!

The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain was extremely difficult to refine. If it were him, even several thousand years and he might not be able to refine all of it either.

But how many years had it been since Ye Yuan obtained the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain?

This kid was full of secrets everywhere on his body!

Over there, Wen Yiling looked at Coldfeather, his eyes full of disdain.

“Coldfeather, even if you broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm, you’re still just an ant in my eyes! You’ve just entered the first-layered heaven Celestial Deity Realm, while I’m already a peak first-layered heaven Celestial Deity!”

Coldfeather laughed in spite of himself and said, “More than 100 thousand years have already passed, and yet you’re still so cocky!”

Wen Yilin’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Courting death!”

Right at this time, the inspector said in a clear voice, “Golden Sword Pact, life-and-death battle, begin!”

Qiao Anshan’s expression turned intent and he yelled coldly, “KILL!”

The moment the word ‘kill’ came out of the mouth, Qiao Anshan’s entire person was akin to a cannonball, charging toward Zuo Shujie.

Four pairs of Celestial Deity powerhouses instantly clashed together.

That commotion could be said to be earth-shattering.

Above in the sky, a cloud of smoke floated over the battlefield, auras surging to the sky.

That violent aftershock, even if a trace leaked over, it could still crush them into minced meat.

Those Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were far away, but their faces were already white-faced without any blood.

This battle was on a completely different level from them.

Especially Qiao Anshan and Zuo Shujie, the commotion of these two people’s battle was tremendous, overshadowing the other three pairs of Celestial Deity powerhouses.

The inspector shot a glance at the Ye Yuan not far away and asked rather curiously, “You don’t seem worried about them at all?”

In reality, even if Heavenly Eagle Imperial City produced two more mighty Celestial Deity powerhouses all at once, he was still not optimistic about Heavenly Eagle.

After all, Utmost Peace Imperial City’s Celestial Deity powerhouses held an overwhelming advantage.

Powerhouses who just reached the Celestial Deity Realms and veteran of the Celestial Deity Realms, their strengths were completely different.

If without a very powerful trump card, wanting to defeat the opponent was simply wishful thinking.

But when the inspector glanced at Ye Yuan, he discovered that he was calm and composed, there was no worry on his face at all. This made him very curious.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Those few fellows are dead for sure, so what’s there to be worried about?”

The inspector was stunned when he heard that and said in astonishment, “Dead for sure?”

Ye Yuan said, “Otherwise? From that moment Qiao Anshan activated the Golden Sword Token, the final result was already decided.”

These words were ... domineering!

It was just that coming out from the mouth of a first-layered heaven Divine Lord junior, it seemed very comical.

The inspector was somewhat at a loss whether to cry or laugh. He shook his head, rather disappointed in Ye Yuan.

Unable to even judge the overall situation, it seemed like he was just a prodigy who was ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth.

However, even though disdainful, he was still very curious about Ye Yuan.

After all, a first-layered heaven Divine Lord was actually able to refine the Supreme Jade Void Pill, this kind of peak rank four medicinal pill; this was seriously too amazing.

One had to know, even the imperial capital’s genius alchemists could not possibly refine peak level nine medicinal pills when at this realm too.

Therefore, even though everyone pledged in all sincerity and solemness, the inspector himself still had some reservations.

The inspector said with a faint smile, “Huhu, junior, you might not know how great the disparity between Celestial Deity Realms is! Even though Heavenly Eagle has two more Celestial Deities, they have just entered the Celestial Deity Realm and are far from those veteran Celestial Deity Realms’ match. This matter, I think that Heavenly Eagle is a little unreliable!”

Ye Yuan turned his head and looked at the inspector with a smile as he said, “Does Your Excellency still have something you want to say?”

The inspector was slightly startled in his heart. He only said half a sentence and this kid already knew his intentions?

This kid was shrewd!

The inspector said coolly, “If Heavenly Eagle is defeated, your little life will be lost! That Qiao Anshan absolutely won’t let you off!.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What does Lord Inspector want? The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain or the Supreme Jade Void Pill?”

The inspector’s expression became slightly austere, looking at Ye Yuan in surprise.

He suddenly discovered that he really underestimated this kid. This fellow was sly and shrewd. He was like an old fellow wise in the ways of the world and not like a young man at all.

Since they were clever people, the inspector did not beat around the bush anymore as well. He opened his mouth and said coolly, “The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain is the Golden Sword Pact’s wager, it isn’t convenient for this envoy to intervene. Rather, your little life, this envoy can save it. At that time, you just have to help this envoy refine a Supreme Jade Void Pill will do. However, this envoy wants high-grade and above. Do you have the assurance to refine?”

A Supreme Jade Void Pill, even in the imperial capital, it was an extremely hard to come by medicinal pill too.

Even Five-star Alchemy Gods might not be able to refine it too.

For the inspector to want to get such a medicinal pill, the price expended was still considerable.

People should not look at how he was awe-inspiring in the Southridge Ten Nations. If they really settled down at the imperial capital and got to know things, he was also merely an unimportant character[1].

Ye Yuan knew that Leng Qiuling came from an imperial capital. She was already about to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm at a young age.

This at least showed that Celestial Deity Realms were nothing in imperial capitals.

Hearing the inspector’s words, Ye Yuan suddenly smiled and said, “Lord Inspector is worrying too much. If you want the Supreme Jade Void Pill, this Ye will just help you to refine. There is no need to use this Ye’s life to secure one. Your Excellency, rest assured. Heavenly Eagle will definitely win this battle!”

The inspector was speechless. He suddenly felt like he could not quite figure out this brat anymore.

Clearly an incomparably clever person, but why was he so far off the mark when talking?

Win?

Use what to win?

Right at this time, a series of loud noises came from the sky.

Qiao Anshan completely rampaged, berserk strength suppressing Zuo Shujie firmly.

The inspector looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “This is your certain victory?”
