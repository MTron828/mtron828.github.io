Chapter 1573 Heavenly Sin Heretic God

In the depths of the Godsfall Mountain Range, Kunwu slowly opened both eyes, revealing a hint of surprise.

“Eh, that brat actually came back! It’s only been 100 years and this brat has the ability to return?”

Kunwu’s eyes revealed a doubtful look, feeling very puzzled and curious about Ye Yuan’s return.

Kunwu was naturally aware that a hundred years was the same as a snap of a finger in the Heavenspan World.

Logically speaking, for Ye Yuan to be able to cultivate to the late-stage Grotto Profound Realm now was already pretty good.

With this strength, wanting to return was naturally as hard as ascending to the heavens.

However, his face revealed a hint of amusement as he said with a smile, “But he probably never thought that a second existence who obtained the recognition of Heavenly Dao would appear in this Immortal Grove Region, right? This timing of returning is also too coincidental. Wonder who will win or lose when these two people collide!”

...

Inside the Law Enforcement Hall, everyone all had solemn faces.

Fang Tian’s complexion was pale, his eye revealing a look of despair.

It seemed like he already suffered heavy injuries.

By the side, Skydistant’s expression was not much better than him.

After Ye Yuan left, Fang Tian and Skydistant both broke through the shackles not long ago and already reached Origin Deity Realm.

In this Immortal Grove World, who else could threaten them, even beating Fang Tian to severe injuries?

“Old Man Fang, what should we do now? You have the most wicked ideas, say something!” Skydistant said stiflingly.

Fang Tian heaved a sigh and said, “Ye Yuan’s strength, you’ve witnessed it before! He only used a finger and annihilated tens of thousands of fiends, suppressing Heavenly Fiendgod Kanuo! At that time, Ye Yuan was still merely at the initial-stage Grotto Profound Realm. But that Heavenly Sin Heretic God is already a grand completion Origin Deity. His strength is even stronger than the Ye Yuan back then! In front of such strength, any scheme is all futile effort!”

Skydistant said anxiously, “Then ... Then we’re just handing over the Yue lass obediently just like this? If Ye Yuan comes back, he’ll destroy the entire Immortal Grove Region!”

Fang Tian gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Of course we can’t hand! At most, this old man will risk this old life and fight it out with him!”

Skydistant suddenly heaved a sigh and said, “Sigh! If Ye Yuan were here, it would be good! This goddamn Heavenly Sin Heretic God, he’ll definitely be smacked to death with one slap!”

Fang Tian also sighed and said, “Even if Ye Yuan was here, it’s also impossible to be his match. The two of them are existences who obtained the recognition of Heavenly Dao. But Ye Yuan merely broke through to Deity Realm for 100 years, how could he possibly be Heavenly Sin Heretic God’s match?”

Skydistant said with righteous indignation, “The villainous old heaven is really blind. Why would it acknowledge such a wicked existence?”

Fang Tian sighed and said, “Heavenly Dao is heartless. But as long as one can meet its requirements, they can naturally get it’s recognition.”

Fang Tian was also considered to have pried into a portion of Heavenly Dao. But the Heavenly Dao that he pried into versus obtaining the recognition of Heavenly Dao, the gap was too big.

Skydistant and Fang Tian exchanged a glance, both revealing helpless looks.

They were already the Immortal Grove World’s strongest combat power. But in front of Heavenly Sin Heretic God, it was completely not enough to look at.

Even if not borrowing the power of Heavenly Dao, Heavenly Sin Heretic God could also be sufficient to crush them.

Talking about this Heavenly Sin Heretic God, Ye Yuan was caught out of the blue too.

This Heavenly Sin Heretic God was a very distant existence, already 300 thousand years from the present.

300 thousand years ago, this Heavenly Sin Heretic God could be said to be that era’s most talented powerhouse. His abilities were exceedingly vast, sweeping across the contemporary era.

It was just that this Heavenly Sin Heretic God was bloodthirsty. His road to ascension was a path of killing. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

No idea how many powerhouses had fallen under his hands.

Furthermore, Heavenly Sin Heretic God was very lustful. He actually lost all sense of judgment and raped the daughter of that era’s strongest once.

That time, it really poked a hole in the sky.

Heavenly Sin Heretic God already reached the point of angering both God and men, immediately arousing public wrath.

That strongest person got together with that era’s dozens of powerhouses and joined forces to besiege and slay Heavenly Sin Heretic God.

That battle fought until heaven and earth turned dim. Over a dozen Deity Realm powerhouses fell in battle. But in the end, they were still not able to kill Heavenly Sin Heretic God.

That strongest person severely injured him and sealed him up.

However, that era’s powerhouses fell one by one. No one could have thought that not only did Heavenly Sin Heretic God not die, he actually lived until now!

When Heavenly Dao dwindled to zero, Heavenly Sin Heretic God also had his cultivation suppressed for a time.

But in the wake of Heavenly Dao growing stronger day by day, Heavenly Sin Heretic God actually relied on his heaven-defying talent. Not only did he break through to grand completion Origin Deity not long ago, he even obtained the recognition of Heavenly Dao.

With this, how could the seal still seal him?

Just the other day, Heavenly Sin Heretic God broke out of the seal and shook the world.

When the Law Enforcement Hall saw the Heavenly Dao phenomenon, they naturally went to the sealed land to investigate. Who knew that they ran into Heavenly Sin Heretic God.

That day, the instant Heavenly Sin Heretic God saw Yue Mengli, Heavenly Sin Heretic God’s two eyes radiated with light and fell hopelessly in love with her.

That’s right, it was fell in love!

Yue Mengli’s looks were far greater compared to that strongest person’s daughter.

On the spot, Heavenly Sin Heretic God was going to marry Yue Mengli.

How could Fang Tian and Skydistant be willing to let Heavenly Sin Heretic God have his way? They rushed straight up to have a great battle with Heavenly Sin Heretic God.

But how could they be Heavenly Sin Heretic God’s match? One exchange and Fang Tian was heavily wounded.

Only with Yue Mengli threatening him with suicide did he not kill the two people on the spot.

But Heavenly Sin Heretic God was not someone to be trifled with either. He said that if Yue Mengli dared to refuse, he would kill off all of the Law Enforcement Hall’s Deity Realm powerhouses.

Yue Mengli had a clever idea in the moment of desperation and told Heavenly Sin Heretic God that he could marry her, but it must be a formal wedding and let the whole world know.

She and Heavenly Sin Heretic God agreed that a month later, he would come to the Law Enforcement Hall to marry her in a grand spectacle.

Heavenly Sin Heretic God agreed, but he sealed off the roads leading to the Godsfall Mountain Range.

Clearly, inside the Godsfall Mountain Range had existences that he was apprehensive off as well.

But this way, Yue Mengli did not have a path of retreat anymore.

Today was the one month date. The Law Enforcement Hall’s upper echelons discussed for a month and also did not come up with a conclusion.

The final outcome was to sit and wait for death.

On the right-hand side, Yue Mengli’s gaze revealed a hint of decisiveness as she said, “Seniors, there is no need to dispute it anymore. Li-er already has a way!”

Her words made everyone’s eyes light up.

Skydistant said impatiently, “What method? Yue lass, you quickly say!”

Yue Mengli said, “Heavenly Sin Heretic God wants to obtain me. When he comes over, I’ll threaten with death and make him let you all enter the Godsfall Mountain Range! As long as you all are able to enter the Godsfall Mountain Range, you’ll be safe!”

Skydistant’s expression changed and he said, “No way! Absolutely no way! If you die, how will we give an account to Ye Yuan?”

How could Skydistant not understand? Yue Mengli was harboring the will to die, wanting to sacrifice herself to save them.

But this way, even if they could live, how would they face Ye Yuan in the future?

Ye Yuan entrusted Yue Mengli to them, but they could not protect her.

Yue Mengli said decisively, “Do Seniors have a better plan? You all rest assured, Big Brother Yuan he’s understanding and amenable to reason, he won’t blame you all.”

“My good Li-er, Big Brother Heavenly Sin is here to marry you!”

Right at this time, Heavenly Sin Heretic God’s voice sounded out in the entire stretch of space.
