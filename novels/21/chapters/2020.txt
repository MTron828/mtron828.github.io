Chapter 2024: Venting Frustration

“Your Excellency, I won! I really won! It turns out that my strength is actually already so strong!”

Beside Ye Yuan, Ning Siyu danced with joy, becoming like a different person from the queen just now.

This feeling right now made her have a feeling of transforming from a swallow into a phoenix.

To Ning Siyu, the imperial capital was a massive place.

How many geniuses were there in the entire Southern Border?

This level of alchemy battle was not what she, a little girl who came from the countryside, could take part in at all.

But after exchanging blows with Luo Yue they all, she suddenly discovered that it turns out she had long already been standing on the same starting line as the entire Southern Border’s geniuses under His Excellency’s guidance.

No, wait! It should be that she had walked even further!

These so-called ancient families’ descendants, alchemy geniuses, were actually all defeated at her hands.

Even thinking about it now, Ning Siyu felt rather incredulous.

Ye Yuan said, “These people were merely instigated by others. Their strength isn’t considered strong. In this Cloudpill Summit, the true geniuses should have already stepped into the Dao Realm.”

Ning Siyu’s gaze turned intent and she said in surprise, “So impressive?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “But you don’t need to belittle yourself either. Wanting to step into the Dao Realm, they are at least Six-star Alchemy Gods. Among Five-star Alchemy Gods, your strength can practically sweep through already.”

Ning Siyu said solemnly, “Siyu won’t lose face for Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and brought Ning Siyu and left, only leaving behind the crowd with stunned expressions.

...

“Young Master Yun, Ning Siyu and Luo Yue fought hard for more than four hours. Finally, Ning Siyu broke through to the grand completion Initial Realm, overpowering Luo Yue. All 23 ancient families’ alchemy geniuses were defeated!”

After listening entirely to the manservant’s report, there was death-like silence inside the box room.

Originally wanted to take Ye Yuan down a notch and make him reveal his true colors. Who knew that they helped Ye Yuan’s maidservant achieve her aim.

The Cloudpill Summit’s great battle had yet to start and Ning Siyu’s great name was likely going to echo throughout Cloudpill.

An ancient family’s descendant suddenly said, “T-This Ning Siyu’s strength is likely also a top ten existence when placed among Six-star Alchemy Gods!”

“To be able to teach such a terrifying maidservant, could he ...”

Ning Siyu’s performance finally made these people start to waver.

“Impossible!” Yun Yi denied this guess firmly and said coldly, “I understand! This lass must be the protective talisman that Empyrean Flutterfeather gave Ye Yuan. Ning Siyu is probably Empyrean Flutterfeather’s beloved disciple! You guys, think about it yourselves. What were you doing when you were a thousand plus years old? Even if he’s exceptionally talented, it’s also impossible to reach the realm of grandmaster, isn’t that so?”

The moment Zheng Buqun heard, his eyes also lit up and he said with a nod, “What Brother Yun Yi says is right, we were nearly hoodwinked! It’s just that, I didn’t expect that Empyrean Flutterfeather actually brought up such a formidable disciple. Given time, there will likely be another genius figure in the Southern Border’s alchemy world!”

Everyone secretly nodded when they heard it. They had no way of refuting.

“Brother Yun Yi, this punk concealed himself too deeply. What should we do?” An ancient family’s descendant said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yun Yi had an appearance like everything was planned out as he said with a faint smile, “Relax. He can avoid for a moment, but he can’t avoid for life. Our statuses are a little low, but don’t you all forget, there are still those grandmasters! Moreover ... you all don’t forget, there’s still Empyrean Purplewing! Brother Buqun, this will have to rely on you!”

Zheng Buqun and Yun Yi exchanged a glance and could not help laughing.

...

Inside a luxurious pavilion in the inner-city, powerful undulations spread out.

But after these undulations came into contact with the pavilion’s array formation, they were extinguished very quickly.

“Condense!”

Suddenly, a cold cry came over.

Pill formed!

“Excellent skills! Brother Purplewing’s strength is a notch higher compared to the last Cloudpill Summit!”

“Impressive! Impressive! This Blue Sky Zenith Pill, this Empyrean has attempted many times, but I couldn’t refine it from start to end. I didn’t expect that Brother Purplewing actually succeeded in one try!”

Beside the medicinal cauldron, the Empyrean Purplewing dressed in purple robes revealed a hint of smugness on his face.

“Heh, originally, this Empyrean didn’t plan on coming this time. But I couldn’t simply accept Brother Pilljade’s boundless hospitality. That’s why I agreed to it with great difficulty,” Empyrean Purplewing said with a smile. It was just that the smile was rather awkward.

After he knew that Empyrean Flutterfeather gave the grandmaster token to a snotty brat. There was no need to mention how enraged he was.

But Empyrean Flutterfeather’s status was above his. He also could not go and find the other party to reason it out. He naturally had a stomach full of anger.

Originally, he did not plan on coming. But Empyrean Pilljade issued an invitation to him.

Considering Empyrean Pilljade’s face, he naturally had to give.

He came, but this hurdle in his heart could not be cleared no matter what.

Inside this pavilion were all Empyrean powerhouses, Seven-star Alchemy Gods.

The Cloudpill Summit was not merely just the stage for those genius alchemists to exhibit themselves. Actually, the top priority was their exchange, these Seven-star Alchemy Gods.

Alchemy Dao entering Seven-star, the effort expended that was required for each improvement made, was calculated with tens of thousands of years.

During this kind of exchange, everyone each took what they were good at, and could naturally help each other forward.

A Seven-star Alchemy God said, “Sigh! Also don’t know how Brother Flutterfeather thinks, to actually give the grandmaster token to a brat still wet behind his ears. His status is even above ours. How will we, these old fellows, put our faces?”

Empyrean Purplewing chuckled and said, “Perhaps that kid’s Alchemy Dao is really exceedingly formidable, crushing us at a young age? Brother Flutterfeather naturally has his reason to do so.”

On the outside, Empyrean Flutterfeather and him, Empyrean Purplewing, were both Empyreans under Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s command. He naturally could not be too diametrically opposed when talking.

But the sourness in the implied and explicit meaning of his words, even a pig could discern it.

Being ridden on top of his head by a Six-star Alchemy God, this taste was not pleasant.

At this time, an Empyrean powerhouse came forward to urge, “It’s still Brother Purplewing who is broadminded! Your strength, all of us has a score in our hearts and don’t need a grandmaster token to affirm it at all. Apart from the seven great holy lands’ masters, Brother Purplewing’s strength is also the pinnacle-most existence among grandmasters.”

Empyrean Purplewing smiled and said, “Brother Zheng is too kind! There is always someone better, and heaven beyond heaven! This Empyrean came this time primarily to catch up with everyone and have exchanges.”

The Empyrean powerhouse speaking was precisely the Zheng Family’s ancestor, Seven-star Alchemy God, Zheng Qiyuan.

A few days ago, he heard Zheng Buqun’s report, saying that Ye Yuan was incomparably arrogant and looked down on the Zheng Family.

Zheng Qiyuan naturally flew into a great rage after hearing it. A mere Six-star Alchemy God actually dared to challenge him?

Holding a grandmaster token and he really took himself to be a grandmaster?

This brat that came from God knows where was also arrogant to the extreme.

Zheng Qiyuan smiled and said, “Currently in the city, the rumors are that Ye Yuan is the Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma’s newly-ascended genius disciple. Empyrean Flutterfeather only gave the grandmaster token to him due to being coerced by Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s pressure. Brother Purplewing, you’re also under Lord Myriad Treasure, wonder if there’s such a thing?”

“Bullshit genius disciple! There’s no such person in the Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma at all!” Empyrean Purplewing could not refrain from cursing.

Zheng Qiyuan was also slightly surprised when he heard. His thinking was the same as Zheng Buqun. He did not expect that Ye Yuan did not come from the Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma at all.

“So that’s how it is! Then I’m very perplexed, Brother Purplewing! How about this, we invite him over to our conference? Everyone will help you vent this frustration!” Zheng Qiyuan said.
