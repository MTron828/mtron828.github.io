Chapter 2596: Pandemonium!

“Sect Master, this cloud of thick smoke is very formidable! We can’t get close at all! I’m afraid that an enemy has attacked!” A purple-wing protector came to report.

Feng Xuanyi’s gaze turned slightly dark, and he said in a cold voice, “Go and prepare quickly! Open the sect protecting grand array and meet the enemy!”

“Yes!” The purple-wing protector received the order and left.

At this time, the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect entered a state of combat readiness.

Everyone was waiting eagerly for battle already, planning on dealing a painful strike to the invading enemy.

Behind Feng Xuanyi, Luo Yunqing came out, brimming with fighting intent as he said, “Sect Master, I’m going to Skywater Peak!”

But Feng Xuanyi shook his head and said, “Don’t panic! The enemy’s intention is unknown. If you launch an attack rashly, you’ll likely fall into passiveness. This poison fog is very formidable. It has obviously been planned for a long time. There’s probably already no survivor on Skywater Peak anymore!”

Luo Yunqing gritted his teeth lightly, his eyes full of killing intent.

Right at this time, another person came to report, “Sect Master, things are bad! That thick smoke has gone with the wind, and it already floated to Flowing Cloud Peak!”

The moment Luo Yunqing heard, he could not endure it anymore and said, “Sect Master, this poison fog doesn’t dissipate when the wind blows! If we allow it to continue floating, I’m afraid that there is no need to wait for the enemy to attack; our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect will already be destroyed!”

Feng Xuanyi’s gaze turned slightly dark and he said, “Go and inform all elders to go to Flowing Cloud Peak and await orders!”

“Yes!” That protector received the order and left.

“Wait!” The protector had not left yet but was stopped by Feng Xuanyi again.

“Just now, you said Flowing Cloud Peak?” Feng Xuanyi said with a frown.

The protector nodded his head and said, “Yes! Skywater Peak is located to the southeast of Flowing Cloud Peak, the northwest wind blows there all year round. The poisonous smoke has already drifted to Flowing Cloud Peak along with the northwest wind!”

“Hu?…?huhuhu, hahaha?…”

When Feng Xuanyi heard that, he was taken back first, then smiled faintly, and turned into a peal of roaring laughter in the end.

Luo Yunqing and the protector were baffled, not knowing why Feng Xuanyi laughed.

“What’s wrong, Sect Master?” Luo Yunqing frowned and said.

Feng Xuanyi laughed until tears were almost coming out. Hearing that, he shook his head and said, “I’m laughing at how Ye Yuan’s, that punk, methods are really formidable! This sect master refused to let him enter the Land of Exile, and so he turned the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect upside down!”

Luo Yunqing was stunned and said, “Ye Yuan? What does this have to do with him?”

Feng Xuanyi’s laughter gradually ceased, and he said with a cold snort, “What has it got to do with him? This punk must have long already calculated the wind direction, and then he cast poison on Skywater Peak! Then he let the poisonous smoke move with the wind and float toward Flowing Cloud Peak!?Heh,?nice trick! Really excellent trick!”

The moment Luo Yunqing heard this, it suddenly dawned on him.

But listening to it still felt fantastical.

“Sect Master, this … this isn’t too likely, right? After all, Ye Yuan is just a grade one heavenly alchemist. So how can he possibly refine such a powerful poison?” Luo Yunqing said.

Feng Xuanyi’s expression became solemn and he said, “What you said is true too. This matter can’t be slipshod. It’s better we go to Flowing Cloud Peak to take a look at the situation first! You, quickly go and check on Ye Yuan’s movements for me! After investigating clearly, tell me right away!”

“Yes!” That protector received the order and left.

… …

On Flowing Cloud Peak, powerhouses gathered.

Even some elders who were reclusive and did not emerge were also alarmed.

Currently, on Flowing Cloud Peak, just the Jade Sovereign Heaven elders were as many as more than 20!

A figure came down from Flowing Cloud Peak.

Feng Xuanyi said with a frown, “How is it, Yunqing?”

Luo Yunqing drew a deep breath and said in a solemn voice, “They are all fine. It’s just that they are poisoned, their entire body spasming endlessly! Looking at the appearance, it should be … Windward Topple!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Xuanyi was taken aback and said, “Windward Topple? When did this poison become so powerful?”

Windward Topple poison had long already become renowned.

The entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect knew about it.

It was just that they also knew that this poison could only paralyze below Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratums were immune to this poison!

Luo Yunqing smiled bitterly and said, “Although their symptoms are the same as Windward Topple, this poison is indeed extremely powerful! Even when I went up, I also felt quite uncomfortable!”

“What?! This … How is this possible?” Feng Xuanyi as well as the group of elders all had shocked expressions on their faces.

They had never heard before that Windward Topple could actually be so powerful, able to even affect Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

Luo Yunqing smiled bitterly and said, “It can basically be ascertained that this matter was caused by Ye Yuan! When I found Han Qianyun, there was also … a shoe print on his face, he was clearly stepped on by someone! The transmission array to enter the Land of Exile has already been touched by someone.”

By the side, Shi Feiyu’s expression could not help turning black.

This Ye Yuan was really shameless to the extreme!

Feng Xuanyi’s expression was ugly too, but in his heart, he already approved of Luo Yunqing’s judgment.

Because when Han Qianyun let out the harsh words, he was hiding not far away.

Han Qianyun said, or you could defeat me, and step over my body!

This damn guy really did it!

Feng Xuanyi covered his face with his hand. He was seriously unable to accept such a result.

He already considered all possibilities and had never slackened off in these past few months too.

Who knew that Ye Yuan actually caused such a huge commotion in order to enter the Land of Exile!

This boy was really too frightening!

If he really wanted to deal with the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, they would probably be pretty much completely annihilated apart from the elders now.

A Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, this deterrence was also too terrifying!

And right at this time, that protector who went to investigate Ye Yuan came back.

“How is it? Where did Ye Yuan go?” Feng Xuanyi hurriedly asked.

That protector said, “Today, after Elder Ye finished giving pointers to everyone’s pill refinement, he said that he was going to teach Wu Chengchao alone! Afterward, the two of them went up Skywater Peak, and no one saw him again!”

Feng Xuanyi’s expression flickered indeterminately and he gritted his teeth and said,?“Heh!?A fine borrowing a chicken to lay an egg! Good! Good! Good!”

The three ‘good’s exuded endless helplessness.

He calculated everything and also never expected that Ye Yuan actually used such an ingenious move!

The elders and protectors present also could not muster up any temper.

He already ran. Their bellies full of anger had nowhere to vent too!

But this guy was really lawless and unbridled.

In order to enter the Land of Exile, he sent the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect into pandemonium!

That protector asked weakly, “Sect Master, what … what should we do?”

Feng Xuanyi’s expression was grim until it was almost dripping water.

He snorted coldly and said, “What else can we do? All elders listen up! You all go up the peak together and scatter the poisonous smoke! The rest, stay where you are and wait for orders!”

The poisonous smoke seemed to have grown roots, unable to disperse at all.

Only elder-level Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses could scatter it with their profound power.

When Feng Xuanyi saw this scene, he was shocked in his heart.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually had such terrifying strength!

He naturally knew about the poison Windward Topple.

But there definitely wasn’t such a powerful Windward Topple.

That could only mean that this thing was invented by Ye Yuan himself!

He looked at Flowing Cloud Peak and said with a sigh, “Scoundrelly punk, I hope that you can come back alive! No, wait! Maybe if you go to the Land of Exile, those wicked and ferocious villains will probably have a headache when they see you too, right?”
