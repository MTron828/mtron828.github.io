Chapter 2976: Persuade to Surrender

With Ye Yuan getting injured repeatedly, Feng Ninesong held great advantage. She laughed shrilly and said, “Kid, do you think that by fusing bloodline, you can be arrogant in front of my Fire Phoenix Clan? You’re still lacking!”

Ye Yuan was somewhat speechless. This woman looked very proud of herself.

It was just that, did she not realize that he only used one move from the start till the end?

Furthermore, it was even the Fire Phoenix Clan’s move.

He shook his head slightly and said with a sigh, “It’s just these three moves back and forth. It looks like you only know these three moves in this Phoenix Nine Ensembles.”

Feng Ninesong’s expression changed, and she said with a cold smile, “Three moves is enough to kill you!”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “Killing people at the drop of the hat, do you really take this Ye to be easy to bully? Although I don’t want to kill people today, I’ll have to leave you with a bit of a lesson too!”

While talking, the heaven qian grade bloodline in Ye Yuan’s body surged.

Behind him, the phoenix phantom turned corporeal, flying towards the void and circling indeterminately.

This scene was shockingly the first ensemble of the Phoenix Nine Ensembles!

The expressions of all the Fire Phoenix Clan powerhouses changed.

“Phoenix Nine Ensembles? This … how is this possible?”

“This is my Fire Phoenix Clan’s undisclosed secret. Only core members can learn it! Where did this boy learn it from?”

“Previously, he had been using the Heavenly Phoenix God Exterminating Fist all along. Now, he learned the Phoenix Nine Ensembles too. Could it be that … he learned it on the spot?”

“How is this possible! The Phoenix Nine Ensembles has a certain bloodline fluctuation. Without the secret technique imparting, it’s simply impossible to learn it! Even if it’s heaven qian grade bloodline, it’s impossible too!”

… …

Feng Ninesong was extremely shocked in her heart. It was because she felt that Ye Yuan might have very likely secretly learned her Phoenix Nine Ensembles.

Judging from the time, this boy had only come into contact with Feng Qingxuan, that wench, for a short time.

That wench did not have the time to impart Ye Yuan such a consummate skill!

Then, it could only have been that he secretly learned it!

Learning her secret technique now, this … was also too heaven-defying, right?

Furthermore, the moment Ye Yuan made his move, under the augmentation of the heaven qian grade bloodline, the power was even more frightening than her Phoenix Nine Ensembles!

A light cry!

The phoenix phantom directly fell, colliding together with Feng Ninesong’s third ensemble.

Boom!

Feng Ninesong’s body was like a kite with a broken string, directly being thrown tens of thousands of feet away!

The expressions of the Fire Phoenix Clan powerhouses changed greatly, and they hurried over and discovered that Feng Ninesong’s wings were currently flapping, but she could no longer move.

Everyone drew a breath of cold air!

First ensemble versus the third ensemble, he actually beat Feng Ninesong until like this?

Just how strong was this guy?

“Q-Quickly run! This guy is too strong!”

The group of Fire Phoenix Clan powerhouses displayed their movement techniques and were about to flee.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Did I let you guys leave?”

Everyone who was currently scattering in all directions seemed to have been hit by a paralyzing hex, instantly turning stiff where they stood.

Even Feng Ninesong was defeated. How could they be Ye Yuan’s match?

Running away at this time was equivalent to seeking death!

Previously, Ye Yuan said that he did not want to kill people. They just treated it as a joke.

But now, they did not think so anymore.

Ye Yuan looked at everyone and said coolly, “I know that you guys still have Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses pursuing her. Therefore, for safety’s sake, you all had better stay behind for the time being. After her nirvanic rebirth succeeds, I’ll naturally let you all leave.”

Feng Ninesong recovered to her human body, her complexion deathly pale as she said, “I-Is this true?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Would I need to be so long-winded if I wanted to kill you all? However, if I discover that you guys secretly tipped them off, don’t blame me for not being courteous.”

These true spirit powerhouses naturally had their own unique means of communication.

However, Ye Yuan did not care. With Mi Tian this major power around, these people’s paltry tricks could not be concealed.

He had already given them a chance. Whether or not they knew how to cherish it would depend on them.

Everyone thought about it and felt that it was true. If Ye Yuan wanted to kill people, none of them could escape.

Hence, the Fire Phoenix Clan pursuers became Ye Yuan’s captives.

“He … He’s actually not killing us. Looks like he’s really not in a clique with that wench!” Feng Ning said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Feng Ninesong shot her a glare. The latter’s neck shrunk, and she immediately shut up.

However, Feng Ninesong suddenly said, “What you said is right. He kept saying that he was trying his best to do what was entrusted by others! Most likely, that wench used phoenix blood essence to bribe him!”

Feng Ning’s eyeballs moved and said, “Then are we …”

Feng Ninesong immediately understood and said with a nod, “Help me over!”

Ye Yuan took them in as captives. Then he continued studying the phoenix bloodline not far from the nirvanic rebirth area.

The more he studied, the more Ye Yuan felt the power of the phoenix bloodline.

Feng Ning helped Feng Ninesong over. Feng Ninesong looked at Ye Yuan, her expression complicated.

Today, her Fire Phoenix lineage’s pride was completely trampled underfoot by this young man.

She could feel that there were many secrets on this young man.

Becoming a captive made Feng Ninesong calm down instead.

Feng Ninesong was not a fool. Just by relying on a heaven qian grade bloodline, one absolutely could not reach Ye Yuan’s level!

In the Fire Phoenix Clan, the heaven qian grade bloodline was not Feng Qingxuan alone.

But, nobody had Ye Yuan’s ability to perfectly replicate the other party’s moves just by relying on the opponent’s bloodline undulation!

If this kid could deal a counterblow, Feng Qingxuan, that wench would definitely die!

“Sir, previously, it was all Ninesong who was too rash. This younger sister apologizes to you here.” Feng Ninesong bowed slightly, her words full of respect.

Feng Ning was somewhat surprised. The proud Feng Ninesong would actually lower her head!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you want to persuade me to deal a counterblow, sorry then. Stop making futile efforts.”

Feng Ninesong was taken aback, thinking to herself,?what a clever kid!

The moment she opened her mouth, he guessed her intentions.

However, she still did not give up and said, “Sir, Feng Qingxuan is my Fire Phoenix Clan’s wanted criminal. We came to capture her in the name of the clan! As long as Sir can take action, my Fire Phoenix Clan will definitely remember Sir’s kindness of lending your assistance!”

Since Ye Yuan was so smart, he would definitely know how great the Fire Phoenix Clan’s favor was!

In this Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, one really could not find more than a few that are greater than the Fire Phoenix Clan’s favor.

Of course, this was also talking nonsense. She could not represent the Fire Phoenix Clan.

Ye Yuan opened his eyes and looked at her, looking until the latter felt goosebumps.

Feng Ninesong secretly sighed in her heart. This kid was too smart!

“Sir should be very interested in the Phoenix Nine Ensembles, right? As long as Sir is willing to take action, I’m willing to offer the Phoenix Nine Ensembles up with both hands! Apart from the Phoenix Nine Ensembles, Ninesong still has two secret techniques with power that are not at all inferior to the Phoenix Nine Ensembles. They can all be given! Either way, Sir has already fused with heaven qian grade bloodline. Feng Qingxuan is already of little use to you!” Feng Ninesong guided skillfully and patiently.

Ye Yuan still looked at Feng Ninesong and said with a smile, “I said that I’m trying to do my best what was entrusted by others! If it was just for the sake of phoenix blood essence, why would I need to sit in boredom here? Stop making futile efforts. This Ye has my own principles when doing things. Please go back!”

Feng Ninesong felt angry. This punk was simply impervious to reason!

But right at this time, a fire phoenix shot to the sky, soaring above the nine heavens.

That kind of power was as if a sovereign descending upon the world, being incomparably majestic!

Feng Qingxuan succeeded in the nirvanic rebirth!

“Hahaha?… Feng Ninesong, didn’t expect that I’d succeed in my nirvanic rebirth, right? Prepare to die!” Above the void, Feng Ninesong laughed charmingly.
