Chapter 2274: Make You Make an Exception

Coming to Southfoot Town again, it had been over 2000 years.

Coming here again, Ye Yuan felt a sense of rue.

Back then, he was unable to break through to the Divine Vortex Realm. Rushing hastily into danger and arriving at this place, he received the drunkard’s care. That was how he broke through his realm.

Looking back, when he saw those Divine Lord Realm little scamps around him again, Ye Yuan felt like he was suddenly worlds away.

He concealed his aura along the way in order to not draw too much attention.

“Not seeing him for years, I wonder how the old drunkard is doing.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and entered the town slowly, arriving at the guardian’s place.

Old Drunkard was still lying there in an unsightly manner. Clearly, he was very drunk.

Discovering that somebody came in, Old Drunkard directly threw a wooden plaque over and said drunkenly, “Hurry up and get lost, don’t disturb this old man from drinking!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Huhu, Senior Drunkard is still so overbearing!”

Old Drunkard suddenly startled awake, turned his head to look, and could not help getting a shock.

“It’s you!”

He sized Ye Yuan up and down and said approvingly, “Not bad, not bad! Lord Dustless’s vision is indeed good. You already cultivated to the peak Divine Lord Realm in 2000 years’ time. This speed is considered pretty good already! Back then, Lord Immortal Grove was also no more than this. You came this time in order to break through to Celestial Deity Realm, right?”

With Ye Yuan’s current realm, if he intentionally concealed his cultivation, forget about Old Drunkard, even if it was an ordinary Empyrean Realm, it would be hard to see through his depths too.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Considered so I guess. Senior Drunkard, how have these few years been?”

Old Drunkard’s eyes flickered, and he switched to a smiling face as he said, “Good, very good! I’m guarding this Southfoot Town. What can be wrong, hahaha ...”

He thought that he hid it very well, but how could his emotion fluctuations hide from Ye Yuan’s eyes and ears?

But Ye Yuan did not expose him. Since he did not want to say, forcing him served no purpose either.

The two people meeting, it naturally could not dispense with a bout of small talk.

But while talking, Old Drunkard always seemed to vaguely be wanting to chase Ye Yuan away.

Ye Yuan was aware of this in his heart and also thanked him for his hospitality. He then returned to the residence to rest.

The next day, it was the day to climb the Heavenspan Mountain again.

Old Drunkard watched Ye Yuan enter the passageway before turning back to Southfoot Town.

After he returned to the guardian’s manor, there was already a room full of people inside.

In the middle, a young man sat on his seat, his gaze when looking at the old drunkard was filled with scorn.

Behind the young man, there were even two maidservants massaging his shoulders, fragrance lingering in the air, merry and carefree.

“Bastard, why haven’t you knelt down when you see this young master!”

Bang!

Behind the old drunkard, a martial artist suddenly kicked out, directly kicking onto the back of Old Drunkard’s knees, breaking his pair of legs, kneeling to the ground.

The young man’s expression was apathetic as he said coolly, “Old Drunkard, do you know your crime?”

Old Drunkard did not care, he took out his wine gourd, drank a mouthful of wine, and said with a cold smile, “What crime does this old man have?”

The young man said coolly, “Got to look at the owner when hitting a dog! This young master sent Lin Xiu here to be your deputy, but you killed him! How do you plan on explaining this matter?”

Old Drunkard snorted coldly and said, “Was Lin Xiu here to be a deputy? The moment he came, he relied on Young Master’s power and directly turned this old man into a figurehead! Never mind this, this old man is happy to be idly too! But, in the ten years that Lin Xiu was in power, disregarding that he demanded ridiculous prices, he even tainted and killed hundreds of female cultivators! This old man had urged him many times, but he went from bad to worse, and even wanted to kill this old man! This old man killed him in a moment of rage. What crime is there?”

Old Drunkard was filled with righteous indignation as he said it, but the young man’s face remained calm and collected all along, and did not have the slightest fluctuation.

As if those female cultivators who died unjustly were just a bunch of animals.

To talk about these few years, the old drunkard had passed it comfortably too.

But all this changed ten years ago.

These ten years, Old Drunkard simply spent each day like it was a year.

That Lin Xiu was a pervert.

Female cultivators that were even slightly attractive could not escape his evil hands at all.

Disregarding that he tainted them, he even butchered them afterward!

He was righteous and looked down on this kind of despicable action the most.

These ten years, he simply wanted to explode from anger.

However, Lin Xiu was this young master’s cousin. Relying on this young master’s power, he did not place him in his eyes at all.

Old Drunkard was just a True God Realm in the end.

He was naturally incomparably powerful in the eyes of these Divine Lord Realm martial artists. But in the eyes of this one, he was akin to an ant.

Helpless, he could only persuade many times.

But, not only did Lin Xiu not listen, he went from bad to worse, and became more and more abominable.

Finally, Old Drunkard could not resist making a move to stop Lin Xiu. But under this guy’s frenzy, he actually wanted to kill Old Drunkard.

He thought that Old Drunkard did not dare to fight back. But who knew that under Old Drunkard’s sullen rage, he struck him dead with one palm.

Lin Xiu had his body hollowed out by alcohol and lust. So how could he be Old Drunkard’s match?

It was just that like this, it startled Young Master.

Old Drunkard knew that Young Master was coming these two days, so he did not want to drag Ye Yuan in, that was why he did not mention this matter.

“Just a bunch of ants. Lin Xiu favoring them is their blessing. Is it your turn to be a busybody?” Young Master said with an indifferent look.

Toward this remark, Old Drunkard seemed to have long expected it. He just drank a mouthful of wine and kept his mouth shut.

Tang Yucheng and Lin Xiu were simply jackals of the same lair!

No matter how much he said, it would also be hard to escape death.

Those present today, just the Empyreans numbered quite a few. There was no chance for him to escape.

Seeing Old Drunkard keeping his mouth shut, Tang Yucheng said coolly, “Looks like you already have some awareness. Send him on his way then! Qing He, from today onwards, you’re Southfoot Town’s guardian.”

By the side, one of Tang Yucheng’s subordinates had a look of pleasant surprise and immediately bowed and said, “Many thanks for Young Master’s appreciation!”

Tang Yucheng waved his hands, indicating for his subordinates to do it.

An Empyrean walked out slowly and came before Old Drunkard.

Old Drunkard laughed loudly, opened his mouth, and drank wine, incredibly unrestrained.

The Empyrean did not say a word and smacked a palm down.

But just as his palm was about to land, a ray of sword light seemed to come from beyond the sky.

Pfft!

That Empyrean was directly sliced into pieces, deader until he could not be more dead.

A figure slowly walked in from outside the house and came right in front of Old Drunkard.

Tang Yucheng’s subordinates all retreated, not daring to come into contact with Ye Yuan at all, directly opening up a path.

Old Drunkard looked at Ye Yuan in astonishment, shocked speechless.

He did not even see clearly how he attacked and this Empyrean was one-shotted?

Could it be that ... Ye Yuan’s current strength was not Divine Lord Realm?

No, wait, he had clearly already seen him enter the passageway. Why did he come back again?

Old Drunkard struggled to open his drunken eyes, attempting to see Ye Yuan clearly. But no matter how he looked, he could not see clearly too.

It was as if what was standing in front of him at this very moment was that fleeting and ephemeral Heavenspan Mountain!

“Ye Yuan, you ... you ...”

Old Drunkard stammered for a long time and did not speak.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Drunkard is treating me too much as a stranger! Relax. With me around, they can’t touch you!”

Tang Yucheng drank a mouthful of wine calmly and said coolly, “Can’t touch him? When I, Tang Yucheng, want to kill someone, there has never been anyone who can stop me!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said smilingly, “Then sorry about it, I’ll have to make you make an exception today.”
