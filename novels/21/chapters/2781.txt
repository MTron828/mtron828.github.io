Ye Yuan ignored Jingfei and said coolly, “I wonder if this Ye’s face is still worth some money?”

He already showed leniency just now and only sent these people flying.

If not, these people would have been killed by him in one exchange.

Although he was only a peak lower Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse currently, ever since embarking on the path of a divergent cultivator, his understanding of Great Dao became even deeper instead.

Every movement and action showed its power even more!

Of course, Jingfei this lass seemed to be fooling around, but she was not really an idiot either.

These Saint Sovereign Heavens that she provoked were actually not considered too strong.

If they were too strong, it would also have been impossible for Jingfei to escape from so many people with her life. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A giant crab had a fearful look as he said to the large turtle, “Wu Tuan, this boy is so strong!”

Each and every one of the Saint Sovereign Heavens present was terrified too.

Ye Yuan’s strength was too strong. Just now, if he dealt a killing blow, they would already be dead.

The large turtle snorted coldly and said, “Boy, do you really want to meddle in the affairs of Qian Kui Sea Region? You have to know, back then, there was a human punk who was pursued tens of millions of miles by our Qian Kui Sea Region and almost died!”

Ye Yuan’s brows could not help raising when he heard it.

Could this person be Zhuo Bufan?

The Zhuo Bufan who swept across everything in Rainclear Continent had this experience too?

“Huhu,?almost died? Didn’t he not die? Don’t have any doubts. I’ll be meddling in this girl’s affairs. If you all have anything that you’re unhappy about, feel free to come at me!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

He already showed the other party a lot of face. Since the other party really wanted to form a grudge, they could become enemies then.

He, Ye Yuan, was not even afraid of Heavenly Dao. Could he still be scared of these seafolk?

Moreover, Zhuo Bufan could kill his way out. Couldn’t he, Ye Yuan, kill his way out?

Wu Tuan was furious when she heard that and said, “Very good! Boy, prepare to receive our wrath! Come on!”

The group of people left with a whiz.

While at this time, Ye Yuan reached his hand out and grabbed forward. A tremendous suction force transmitted out.

Jingfei, who was just thinking of running away, was directly captured back from the void by Ye Yuan.

“Why? You caused trouble, and you still want to slip away?” Ye Yuan said with an unfriendly look.

“W-When did I? I wanted to go … to go scout out the path,?hehe?…” Jingfei thickened her skin and said with a smile.

“Big Yellow, smack the buttocks! Hit hard, don’t show mercy! This girl’s skin is thick.” Ye Yuan instructed coolly.

“Ahh,?don’t! Big Brother Ye Yuan, don’t hit me! I … I only got into big trouble for you! You look!”

As she said, Jingfei took a sheet of skin out.

Ye Yuan received it and took a look. It was a map.

“This is?”

“This is a nautical chart! Didn’t you want to go to the other side of the sea? It’s very easy for you to get into trouble by traveling heedlessly like this! You have to know, there isn’t just True Sovereign Heavens in the sea. There are even Emperor level true spirits in some powerful sea regions! No matter how strong you are, it’s also impossible to be their match, right? With this nautical chart, you’ll be able to avoid those powerful sea regions and will naturally be much safer!”

Ye Yuan gave Jingfei a strange glance. He did not expect that she actually took this out!

Indeed, Ye Yuan was also most worried about precisely this when traveling via sea.

The sea was too big, boundless. One would not know where home was.

Once trespassed into some powerful sea regions, that would really be dying without knowing how he died.

There were many major and minor sea regions marked on this nautical chart.

Especially some Emperor level sea regions that were marked using red.

And this sea region that they were in right now was called Qian Kui Sea Region, a True Sovereign level sea region.

There were also more than ten major and minor True Sovereign sea regions around Qian Kui Sea Region.

This was also to say that the True Sovereign Heaven true spirit seafolk in these sea regions were more than ten!

Even True Sovereign Heavens were numerous. So it could be imagined how many Saint Sovereign Heavens there were in this ocean.

The sea was not like land.

This place was a vast expanse. When passing through, they would be under the surveillance of the sea race.

No matter how exceedingly formidable your means, it was also impossible to avoid the eyes and ears of the sea race.

In the sea, there were countless true spirits. Could it be that Ye Yuan could still kill off all the true spirits in the sea?

The danger of the sea lay in precisely this.

Once an ordinary Saint Sovereign Heaven was targeted by some seafolks, if they joined forces and invited several Saint Sovereign Heavens over, how could there be the logic of not dying?

“How is it? With a younger sister that cares for you, are you very moved?” Jingfei said smugly.

Ye Yuan put away the nautical chart and said with a cold snort, “Don’t give me that! How did you steal people’s turtle eggs in passing when stealing a nautical chart? Also, you pierced through the earth’s core and burned people’s nests. It’s also in order to find the nautical chart?”

Jingfei hurriedly stuck her tongue out and said, “You already know?”

“I’m not deaf. How could I not hear?”

Ye Yuan said crossly, “Forget it. Looking on account of the nautical chart, I’ll spare you this time!”

“Hehe,?Big Brother Ye Yuan is the best!”

“But why are you here?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

“Back then, when you transcended the tribulation at sea, Jingfei already knew that you were about to leave. Later, you established the Pill Pavilion on the Rainclear Continent, the faction growing stronger and stronger. I knew that you were going to leave very soon. Hence, I came here to wait for you in advance. Heading south all the way after coming out of the seven great sea regions, one will enter the Qian Kui Sea Region. Who knew that I waited ten years! Ten years! I had to find something to do!”

Ye Yuan was rendered speechless.

This girl … you were really asking for trouble!

But thinking about it, Ye Yuan was a little touched in his heart too.

While this girl was messing around, finding the nautical chart should be real.

“You want to leave together with me?”

Jingfei nodded and said, “I’ve already broken through to Saint Sovereign Heaven now. The seven great sea regions have no meaning anymore. The outside world is what’s fun!”

“You came out, then what about the Thistle South Sea Region?”

“When you left back then, didn’t you leave behind some heavenly pills? Uncle Black Shark already broke through to half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven too. My big brother also broke through to Jade Sovereign Heaven. With them around, it will be fine.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Alright, come along with me then.”

Jingfei grabbed onto Ye Yuan’s arm and swung it hard as she said,?“Hehe,?it’s still Big Brother Ye Yuan who’s the best!”

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “Don’t be happy too early! This Qian Ye Sea Region is probably not so easy to walk out of!”

… …

As Ye Yuan expected, after Wu Tuan and the others returned, they immediately went to Qian Kui Hall.

Qian Kui Sea Region’s overlord was a Qian Kui fish that attained Dao.

“Lord Whalebillow, you have to uphold justice for us! That human punk is bullying people too far!” Wu Tian complained tearfully.

“Lord Whalebillow, my palace has already become ruins. I don’t even have a dwelling place anymore now. You have to stand up for this lowly one!”

… …

A group of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses was currently all extremely grief-stricken as if their parents had died.

The Lord Whalebillow that they spoke of was a great general under Qian Kui, a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven super powerhouse, his strength being extremely formidable.

Whalebillow was originally indifferent, but hearing about Ye Yuan’s strength, he nodded and said, “Sovereign Qian Ye is currently in closed-seclusion.. You all rest assured. Starshine and I won’t sit by idly and remain indifferent with regards to this matter!”
