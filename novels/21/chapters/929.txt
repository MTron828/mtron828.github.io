Chapter 933: Inexplicably Frustrated

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On the Eight Extremities War Chariot, the atmosphere was rather odd.

After entering the war chariot, Yue Jianqiu’s behavior was completely different from the zealousness from before; cold until it made people somewhat chilly.

As for Ye Yuan, he poured himself a cup of wine and drank it all by himself casually, without the slightest feeling of aloofness.

“Bright Moon City’s specialty product, Waning Moon Falling Petals Wine. Mm ... Not bad, not bad! It’s a shame that this wine is only middle-grade. Furthermore, its age is somewhat lacking. Family Head Yue is so stingy!” Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh.

Waning Moon Falling Petals Wine was a top-grade fine wine on the same level as the Immortal Remembrance Jade Brew. Only by using Bright Moon City’s Soaring Moon Immortal Flower could it be distilled.

However, Yue Jianqiu clearly would not take the immortal grade Waning Moon Falling Petals Wine used to entertain distinguished guests to come and entertain Ye Yuan.

“Ye Yuan, you really gave such a big gift! Upon arriving at Bright Moon City, you threw it into pandemonium! And you still want this Yue to personally come out and receive you!” Although Yue Jianqiu’s words were calm, it faintly contained killing intent.

But Ye Yuan did not care at all. Looking at him, he said indifferently, “Bright Moon City’s hospitality, this Ye has also had a taste of it! When can this snobbish shortcoming be fixed? You arriving, I already gave you face and cooperated with you to act out a play. Otherwise, making me board this Eight Extremities War Chariot isn’t such an easy thing!”

Yue Jianqiu’s eyes narrowed slightly and revealed a glimmer of cold light. Clearly, his tolerance had reached the limits.

Ye Yuan’s words were too arrogant!

The Eight Extremities War Chariot was not what anybody could get on. Ye Yuan, a junior, being able to get on the Eight Extremities War Chariot was already an incomparably glorious thing.

This guy actually still dared to create difficulties?!

Yue Jianqiu putting up such a grand line-up earlier, the goal was in order to raise Ye Yuan’s status, making him become mysterious in the assessment of the public.

This way, him, Yue Jianqiu’s, personally coming out to receive would naturally not appear to lower his status.

Before departing, he even deliberately announced Yue Yunfeng’s punishment in front of the common people, indicating that today’s incident was just Yue Yunfeng’s individual fault, and had nothing to do with the Yue Family.

This blame, Yue Yunfeng shouldered it alone!

Yue Jianqiu resolved the Yue Family’s awkwardness with a lift of his hand. He was indeed a mighty ruler with a bold vision.

It was just that his displeasure towards Ye Yuan went without saying.

Therefore, after boarding the Eight Extremities War Chariot, he naturally would not show Ye Yuan any good attitude.

“Humph! Age is not old, but your tone isn’t small! Could it be that boarding my Eight Extremities War Chariot brought shame to your status? Don’t forget, you’re just a Lower Realms bumpkin!” Yue Jianqiu said with a cold snort.

“Just getting on a lousy war chariot, what’s the big deal. Other people care, but I, Ye Yuan, don’t care!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Speaking in terms of Ye Yuan’s peak Alchemy Emperor status, him boarding the Eight Extremities War Chariot was giving the Yue Family face.

It was just that circumstances have changed with the passage of time, Yue Jianqiu did not know that the one sitting opposite him was formerly the alchemy genius who had the Divine Realm at his beck and call.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Yue Jianqiu could not help being speechless. This brat was too arrogant. He completely did not place him, this Rank One Holy Land’s leader, in his eyes.

Those who did not know would even think that Ye Yuan was some formidable Divine King powerhouse.

“Enough nonsense! Li-er’s illness, you’re really confident about it? Quan Xingzi has come and helped Li-er to diagnose before. Even he was at a loss on what to do as well!” Yue Jianqiu said with a grim look.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Quan Xingzi that old man is complacent with his own laurels, not worth mentioning. If he was able to cure it, that would be strange. But speaking of which, this Bright Moon Competition, what’s the meaning of it? How can your daughter’s lifetime happiness be determined with such a careless method?”

Ye Yuan had just entered the city but heard of the matter of the Bright Moon Competition too.

Numerous young talents gathering in Bright Moon City was actually in order to vie for Yue Mengli!

The first place of the Bright Moon Competition would marry Yue Mengli. As a dowry, Bright Moon City would open up a spot and let the future son-in-law enter the Vastsun Bright Moon Realm!

Yue Mengli was indeed an unparalleled beauty. It was just that the news of her days being numbered had long spread already.

Those young geniuses coming here was probably not for Yue Mengli’s sake at all, but for that chance to enter the Vastsun Bright Moon Realm!

What meaning did such a martial competition to find a spouse have as well?

Yue Jianqiu shot him a fierce glare and said, “It isn’t your turn to come and worry about the Yue Family’s affairs! Don’t say that I don’t give you a chance, if you’re sincere towards Li-er, then defeat all of the young talented men during the Bright Moon Competition!”

When Ye Yuan heard this, he involuntarily turned stuff, and he actually became immersed in his thoughts.

Seeing this scene, Yue Jianqiu sneered coldly in his heart.

This brat wanted to score outside of his league, Now, upon hearing that he had to deal with the outstanding young geniuses under the heavens, he immediately shriveled up.

Li-er’s heart was entirely tied to Ye Yuan. How could he, as her father, not tell? It was just that he felt that Li-er had entrusted to the wrong person now!

Yet, Ye Yuan’s current thoughts were completely poles apart from what Yue Jianqiu had on his mind.

The reason why he was in a daze was that he did not think Yue Jianqiu actually thought that he had designs on Li-er.

But regarding Yue Mengli, Ye Yuan indeed had a feeling which he could not put into words.

This sort of feeling was completely different from when he was facing other girls.

Ye Yuan involuntarily recalled the matter of Yue Mengli sneaking a kiss on him back then. Recalling it now, he actually felt his heart palpitate with excitement.

Could it be that he actually fell for Yue Mengli?

In his previous life, Ye Yuan put his whole body and mind into alchemy. And this life, his greatest goal was to take revenge on Ji Canglan. So he consciously or unconsciously refrained himself from thinking in this area. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Originally, Ye Yuan thought that he only had feelings of gratitude towards Yue Mengli. But looking at it now, it seemed like it was not simply so.

Except, what the conclusion was, Ye Yuan did not have a clear answer in his heart too.

“Good that you’re afraid! If you can really treat Li-er, the Yue Family naturally will not treat you unfairly. Except, if you’re using this as a chip to come and obtain Li-er, that’s impossible! However, I’ll say the nasty things first, if you can’t treat Li-er, I’ll make you regret ever being born in this world!” Yue Jianqiu said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan collected his thoughts. Drinking a mouthful of Waning Moon Falling Petals Wine, he said coolly, “Li-er’s illness, you don’t have to worry! But organizing this Bright Moon Competition is really incomparably foolish! After Li-er’s illness is cured, her cultivation will advance at a tremendous pace! Before long, no one in your Yue Family will be her match anymore.”

Yue Jianqiu said in a deep voice, “Humph! Sounds nicer than it is! Li-er’s days are numbered, you also disappeared these two years. Furthermore, your cultivation realm is too low and can’t refine the Soul Separating Pill at all. Even if you really came, what’s the use? Li-er is born with the Moonlight Heavenly Eye Physique. The strength of her ocular powers is one of a kind in the Yue Family! If she really leaves like this, it will be a tremendous loss to the Yue Family. What do you know?”

Hearing these words, Ye Yuan was actually inexplicably frustrated in his heart.

Yue Jianqiu’s meaning was actually treating Yue Mengli as a tool to carry on the family line. Because descendants of the innate Moonlight Heavenly Eye Physique, there was a 30% chance to be of the innate Moonlight Heavenly Eye Physique too!

Even if they were not, the descendants’ ocular powers were also much stronger compared to ordinary people.

It was precisely because of this that Yue Jianqiu would be willing to give up a spot to enter the Vastsun Bright Moon Realm, and also had to find a proud son-in-law for himself!
