Chapter 3075: Eternal River Breakthrough!

“Y-Ye Yuan he …”

Feng Qingxuan choked and could not continue.

The place that Ye Yuan was standing at had already turned into an endless sea of fire.

Further, under Ancestor Heavenless’ violent rage, Ye Yuan had no possibility of surviving at all.

Cloudneon sighed slightly and said, “If he went, then he went. Before long, we’ll be following him too.”

Hegemon Samsara they all ran, but these Supreme Hegemons had not run away yet.

It was naturally impossible for Ancestor Heavenless to let them off.

Feng Qingxuan’s expression turned dim. Her eyes actually had an additional hint of liberation.

“Ye Yuan punk, you ruined my great plan. This ancestor wants you to die without a burial ground! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!” Above the void came Ancestor Heavenless’ furious voice.

He had plotted for several hundred thousand years and threw out the Labyrinth Divine Palace, this enormous bait. It was for the sake of luring Progenitor Samsara over.

In fact, the Chaos Bloodstone was in his scheme too.

This time, if he rounded up all the heavens’ powerhouses in one fell swoop, he would recover his peak strength. Even improving a step further was possible.

However, such a perfect plan was ruined at Ye Yuan’s hands.

......

How could he not be furious?

Without Samsara and Chaos Bloodstone, these two great supremacies, his Great Beyond Flower Blooming pill could only be considered a defective product.

No matter how many Supreme Hegemons there were, it could not make up for the loss of Great Beyond powerhouses too!

But very soon, Ancestor Heavenless realized that something was wrong.

“This is impossible! That kid is already dead. But why is my power still flowing away?” Ancestor Heavenless became alarmed and furious.

Under this kind of blazing fire, Ye Yuan had long already died thoroughly.

But his power of chaos was still fading away rapidly.

Suddenly, he thought of a possibility, and he was struck dumb with amazement!

“This … This is impossible! Could it be that that punk already tore through the boundary? He’s absorbing my power in the Eternal River?”

… . .

On the Eternal River’s shore, in a different place, a figure was standing with his hands behind his back.

This person was wearing a silk headdress on his head and had a handsome face like carved jade, looking suave and free, like a very ordinary scholar.

It was only to see him open both arms up. One invisible force after another gathered in one place from all directions.

His power could also be seen rising at a speed visible to the naked eye.

No idea how long had passed either. His power could not rise anymore.

This was the Eternal River’s main stream. The surging power of chaos virtually crushed people until they exploded!

Only by reaching his level of boundary, with strength infinitely close to transcending the Great Beyond, could one stay in the Eternal River for a short duration.

He looked at the boundless Eternal River and said under his breath, “I didn’t expect that Old Man Heavenless actually concealed such a plan! This time, I really suffered a double loss! Fortunately, the Chaos Bloodstone also suffered serious injuries this time! From today onwards, the 33 Heavens will likely be reshuffling!”

This handsome scholar was the incomparably mysterious Hegemon Samsara!

In order to save this Great Beyond clone, he summoned his clones from all heavens and reunited the soul bodies.

It was only the current him. Was that Hegemon Samsara who made people tremble with fear!

Except, his expression was very ugly.

He already knew about the events that happened in the Labyrinth Divine World.

His moment of greed actually made him fall for the trick.

However, he never dreamed that Ancestor Heavenless could actually survive for hundreds of thousands of years in the Eternal River!

If not for this, how could he easily risk his life?

Suddenly, Samsara’s mind stirred, his figure entering the Eternal River.

Around him, the power of chaos surged frenziedly. He actually forcibly split apart the incomparably powerful Eternal River’s water!

The might of Hegemon Samsara was unbelievably formidable!

His speed was extremely fast, like a great whale cleaving the waves and advancing, without equal!

In a blink of an eye, he arrived at a place.

It was precisely where the Labyrinth Divine World was at!

Right at this time, a streak of bloody light cut through the waves and came from another direction. Who could it be if not the Chaos Bloodstone?

But, what came over was actually a blood-red colored stone!

This stone gave people an extremely evil feeling. It was as if it could corrode the myriad worlds.

This was the Chaos Bloodstone’s main body!

No one knew where it was. But at this time, he came for this clone!

Hegemon Samsara looked at the Chaos Bloodstone and said, “I didn’t expect that the first time we would meet would actually be here!”

The Chaos Bloodstone said, “This progenitor also didn’t expect it! Having obtained this chance, Ancestor Heavenless is probably going to stage a comeback, right?”

Samsara stood with his hands behind his back and said with a slight nod, “His ambitions are huge. He definitely won’t let this opportunity go! It’s just that he never would have dreamed that Ye Yuan, this monster, actually appeared and ruined his grand plan! You and I broke out. His wishful thinking is considered to have fallen flat!”

The Chaos Bloodstone laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… This time, you all know this progenitor’s gloom, right? This boy has ruined my plans time and again starting from True Sovereign Heaven! it’s just that I never expected that he actually saved this progenitor this time!”

Samsara snorted coldly and said, “Do you think that he’ll be so kindhearted? This boy is shrewd as hell! I suspect that he deliberately dragged it out until the last second before choosing to break through! This time, the three of us are all weakened and defeated. We probably won’t have the strength to take action within a short time! This boy is so cunning!”

Hegemon Samsara cultivated his heart across myriad worlds. How astute was he?

With Ye Yuan creating an opportunity, letting them break free, he saw through what Ye Yuan was thinking with one glance.

It was just that this was an open scheme. Even if he knew about it, he was helpless too.

Great Beyond clone being seriously wounded, he needed to go into closed-seclusion for a period of time.

The Chaos Bloodstone smiled and said, “But this time, he’s dead for sure too! Old Man Heavenless will definitely vent all of his anger on him! There’s no hope for him!”

Hegemon Samsara nodded slightly, clearly quite in agreement too.

Suddenly, his mind stirred. A figure cut through the air. It was precisely his Great Beyond clone!

The power of Samsara surged, directly splitting apart the Eternal River’s massive waves, welcoming back his clone and integrating it into his body.

On the other side, the Chaos Bloodstone did the same.

Done with these, he turned around and left.

But right at this time, his entire body trembled. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the Eternal River, an astonishing aura surged to the sky.

The Door of Eternal Life stood proudly in the void!

Only to see a figure rush up to the sky and smash toward the Door of Eternal Life with a punch.

Hegemon Samsara and Chaos Bloodstone’s pupils constricted, looks of astonishment on their faces.

“That’s … Ye Yuan?” Hegemon Samsara said in shock.

“Not only did he not die, but he also even … even pry open the second seal?” Chaos Bloodstone seemed to be trembling.

“This boy can actually be like fish in water inside the Eternal River!” Hegemon Samsara sighed again.

“I even thought that Ancestor Heavenless burned him to death! I didn’t expect that he had actually already escaped into the Eternal River! Old Man Heavenless can only show off his power in the Labyrinth Divine World now. How can he do anything to him?” The Chaos Bloodstone said in shock again.

Boom!

With a loud bang, the second seal opened in response to the noise!

The astonishment on Hegemon Samsara’s face turned into a bitter smile, and he said, “I didn’t expect that in this drama that schemed against all the heavens, the one who had the last laugh is actually this boy! Looks like we got to think of a way to eliminate this boy!”

Hegemon Samsara felt a grave threat!

This kind of threat was even stronger than Chaos Bloodstone and Heavenless!

With his cultivation, he would not be so at ease in the Eternal River too!
