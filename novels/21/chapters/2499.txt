Chapter 2505: Universe Suppressing Five Ancestors!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

With this murder, everyone was struck silly with astonishment.

Even the divine race’s five ancestors were also dumbstruck with amazement.

This plot reversed too fiercely.

They thought that it would turn into a melee. But in the end, Ye Yuan directly one-shotted Dao Ancestor Destruction.

“This … What’s Lord Saint Azure’s doing?”

“Killing Dao Ancestor Destruction at this time, isn’t it breaking one’s own arm and destroying one’s own great wall?”

“Sigh,?Lord Saint Azure’s personality is too staunch! What to do about this?”

… …

A feeling of despair spread in the crowd.

The strength of the human race was significantly weaker than the divine race to begin with. Now, there were even deaths and injuries.

In the end, Ye Yuan even broke his own arm.

But Ye Yuan ignored these. His gaze turned to Ancestor Lightning and Ancestor Wind, and he said coolly, “Do you guys still want the rule crystal?”

“D-Don’t want anymore!” The two said fearfully.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Good that you don’t! Remember, not killing you guys isn’t because you guys aren’t worthy of being killed. Pang Tian, you should thank Pang Zhen. Zuo Yan, you once made a move to stop Tian Qing before. This time, I’ll spare you guys from death. But there’s no next time.”

There was thick fear in the two people’s eyes.

The oppression that Ye Yuan gave to them was seriously too strong.

Finished saying, Ye Yuan ignored the two and turned around and left.

Only then did Ancestor Lightning Pang Tian and Ancestor Wind Zuo Yan feel akin to being relieved of a heavy burden.

They discovered that their backs were already soaked through.

The two exchanged a glance, both revealing a hint of a bitter smile.

The death of Dao Ancestor Destruction made them feel the grief of the fox mourning the death of a rabbit.

The nine great Dao Ancestors were only left with the two of them now!

They understood that the era that belonged to them was already completely over.

Ye Yuan returned opposite of the five ancestors, Tian Qing frowned and said, “You’re really going to confront the five of us with your power alone?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Why? Can’t I?”

Tian Qing said, “Of course you can! This isn’t some fair fight, but the life-and-death battle of two races!?Heh,?you being so overbearingly haughty is precisely what this ancestor hopes for!”

Toward Ye Yuan’s composure, although he felt a little nervous in his heart, he had absolute confidence in the five ancestors’ strength.

Although three laws fusion was troublesome, he was absolutely not the five of their match!

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “Well, begin then!”

His voice had yet to fade and he already turned into an afterimage, pouncing towards Tian Qing.

The latter was shocked, feeling an astonishing sword intent coming at him head-on.

“Fine lad! Watch this!”

Tian Qing’s reaction was extremely quick too, only to hear him yell out loudly, both fists directly slamming out like flood dragons heading out to the sea.

One had a sword intent that surmounted heaven, the other had a fist that suppressed the four seas!

In a breath, the two people clashed.

Boom!

It was only to hear a loud bang. Tian Qing’s body flew out like a bombshell.

While Ye Yuan did not budge an inch!

This blow that arrived unexpectedly was actually Ye Yuan’s complete victory!

At virtually the same time, the divine race’s four ancestors also moved.

Yue Mengli repeatedly pointed her dainty fingers, aiming straight for Ye Yuan’s vitals.

Her strike did not lose to Tian Qing in the least bit.

Under the other three people’s support via coordinated actions, it practically shattered even space!

Ye Yuan was indifferent. Universe suddenly blossomed, facing the four ancestors head-on.

Both sides instantly fell into a fierce battle.

Tian Qing only felt his innards in turmoil. Ignoring the shock in his heart, he rushed in again.

Only when he confronted Ye Yuan head-on did he experience how strong the Ye Yuan who fused time, space, and sword, three laws, was!

At the same time, he was also secretly rejoicing that the divine race had an additional Ten-marks powerhouse now.

If it was just him alone, he would likely really not be able to suppress Ye Yuan.

Tian Qing had fought Shang Hang once before and was deeply aware of the prowess of spacetime law.

It was just that Shang Hang’s strength compared to the current Ye Yuan, it was simply one up in the sky and the other on the ground.

Even if Ye Yuan only used spacetime law, it was also completely not what Shang Hang could compare with, let alone talk about using time, space, and sword, three great laws at the same time.

That swift and fierce sword intent was practically poking holes in the sky.

If not for him being conferred ancestor again, he would not have been able to block that sword just now at all!

However, even if he re-joined the group battle, they were actually unable to suppress Ye Yuan after combining the five of their strength!

The Universe Sword Art that fused spacetime law could be rated as perfect.

Space and time, the two great laws, contained the meaning of universe in the first place.

The Universe Sword Art that Ye Yuan developed with Sword Dao as the axis, time and space as the two poles, was simply formidable to the extreme.

His every move and style carried the aura of Great Dao, almost reaching the extent of the limit of Dao.

Not only did five great Dao Ancestors joining forces fail to suppress Ye Yuan, but they were also completely suppressed by Ye Yuan instead!

Even if the five of them activated Heavenly Dao True Martial, they were still unable to suppress Ye Yuan.

Tian Qing and Yue Mengli were still alright, the other three progenitors were actually in the awkwardness of being in straitened circumstances under the power pressure of Universe.

The six people’s battle fought until the sky rent asunder and the earth split open. The mountains and rivers in the vicinity were directly turned into nothingness.

This battle could be said to be the supreme battle of the Heavenspan World already.

The power was unimaginable.

At this time, regardless of whether it was the divine race or the human race, they all fell into immense shock.

Only then did they understand why Ye Yuan accepted Tian Qing’s provocation so calmly, and why he insisted on fighting one-versus-five calmly.

His might was suffocating!

“What a fine Universe! I feel that Lord Saint Azure is a mobile Heavenly Dao!”

“Strong! Too strong! Lord Saint Azure’s strength already reached a realm that we can’t imagine!”

“It turns out that all of our worries were so ridiculous! Lord Saint Azure is already standing at the summit of the Heavenspan World! From today onward, who can still suppress him?”

… …

Shock, pleasant surprise, and fanatical worship, all kinds of emotions interwoven together.

Humanity’s powerhouses felt an indescribable pride at this time.

The divine race had eight great progenitors that suppressed the myriad races!

But, humanity only needed Saint Azure alone and they could turn their noses up at the world!

In this samsara, the human race did not need to be haunted with fear anymore.

Because they had Saint Azure!

Currently, Lin Chaotian with his mouth full of blood, his eyes were full of despair and shame at his unworthiness.

He was posturing in front of Ye Yuan?

He wanted to become the human race’s sovereign?

He did not even have the qualifications to force out Ye Yuan’s true strength.

The strength that Ye Yuan exhibited now was truly suppressing the myriad races!

Lin Chaotian was a joke after Heavenly Dao Samsara!

Originally, he was still filled with hatred towards Ye Yuan, and still harbored a tiny trace of hope.

But having witnessed Ye Yuan’s strength, he understood that he no longer had hopes of making a comeback.

This was not an era of heroes vying for supremacy.

This was also not an era of duality.

This was an era that belonged to Ye Yuan alone!

This Heavenly Dao Samsara, Ye Yuan would reign supreme by himself!

Even the number one person who once looked down upon the world, Tian Qing, also had to submit under Ye Yuan’s feet! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Puu, puu, puu!

After a thousand moves, Dao Ancestor Life Cheng Kui, was whisked into Universe after a careless move.

It was only to see countless streaks of sword light pass through his body, directly garroting him!

The power of rule flowed out, condensing into a rule crystal again, and arrived at Ye Yuan’s hand.

In the last epoch, 18 Grand Ancestors moving out together, might not be able to kill a divine race progenitor too.

But now, Ye Yuan killed someone under the pincer attacks of five ancestors!

“Still want to fight again?” Ye Yuan held the rule crystal in his hand as he said indifferently.
