Chapter 1120: You Dare to Trick Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Cloudsky gradually recovered from the shocked state and recovered to that appearance of the Holy City’s king.

“Ji Qingyun, don’t you beguile the minds of people here! Although you and Ji Canglan have an enmity, you shouldn’t slander him like that. You keep harping on and on that he is of the fiend race, I wonder if you have any proof? However, you killing the Holy City’s Elder Spirit Hound is an ironclad truth! My Holy City is the leader of the Divine Realm. How can we allow you to be so insolent?!” Cloudsky’s eyes narrowed slightly as he called to account with a stern voice and countenance.

Ye Yuan also did not expect for Cloudsky to actually tell bald-faced lies.

But those present were all the Holy City’s upper echelons. Just the Void Mystic powers numbered quite a few.

Even if he was lying through his teeth, Ye Yuan could not do anything to him either.

Ye Yuan was naturally aware of Cloudsky’s plans. He did not want the matter of the fiend race to leak out and also did not wish to take part in anything that had to do with the fiend race.

Therefore, even if he knew that Zhao Lingdong was a member of the fiend race, he would not acknowledge it at all.

As long as he contained the matter to within the Heavenly Saint Tower, everything could be discussed.

Looking at Cloudsky, Ye Yuan said with a cold smile, “Leading the Divine Realm ... the likes of you are worthy too? Your Yu Soul Sect has been shameless for close to a million years. It’s also truly a wonder of the Divine Realm!”

Before meeting Skydistant, Ye Yuan had that tiny trace of hope towards the Holy City.

But now, Ye Yuan was disinclined to have even a hint of a favorable opinion.

This sect was simply the disgrace of the human race!

And this disgrace actually lasted for close to a million years!

However, the expression on Cloudsky’s face when he heard the name Yu Soul Sect was fascinating to the max.

Other people did not feel anything when they heard it, but in Cloudsky’s ears, it was another scenery altogether.

The name Yu Soul Sect, it was already unknown how long it had been since anyone mentioned it before.

The current Holy Region was gradually developed from precisely the Yu Soul Sect back then!

One could say that the current Holy Region was one of the sects with the most complete inheritances in the entire Divine Realm.

Even though they had also experienced several catastrophes before in-between, for a million years, they had always pulled through.

And it was precisely because the Yu Soul Sect back then was already notorious, that the future generations abandoned this name.

However, this name was passed down among the Holy Region’s upper echelons.

Cloudsky was naturally aware.

It was just that he did not know how in the world Ye Yuan knew ‘Yu Soul Sect’ this name.

Could it be ...

Cloudsky thought of a possibility, and his entire body involuntarily shuddered!

The thing that Zhuge Qingxuan was unable to accomplish, could it be that Ye Yuan did it?

Cloudsky stared fixedly at Ye Yuan, his gaze glimmering with a cold light, and he said coldly, “Ji brat, what the hell did you experience inside the Bloodrain Wilderness?”

Ye Yuan looked at Cloudsky with a broad smile and said, “Haven’t you already guessed it?”

The surrounding atmosphere started to become weird.

These people were all aware that the secret of becoming a deity might be hidden inside the Bloodrain Wilderness.

Ye Yuan’s meaning was all too clear!

He went down to the seventh level!

For a moment, everyone’s gaze when looking at Ye Yuan became burning hot.

“Ji brat, say out the secrets that you obtained. Today’s matter, this lord can sweep it under the rug!” Cloudsky said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “It’s not impossible to say it out. But old man Cloudsky, you aren’t thinking that the secret to become a deity is only worth a Zhao Lingdong, right?”

The moment Cloudsky heard that there was hope, his expression could not help turning intent, and his breathing also became ragged. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

What was able to move him was only the secret of becoming a deity.

Although the Holy City’s inheritances were very complete, that unforeseen event 100 thousand years ago, they similarly did not avoid it.

Overnight, all things related to Deity Realm vanished without a trace!

Hence, the Holy City’s three titans were the same as the other Void Mystic powerhouses, filled with yearnings toward the Deity Realm.

If not for so, how could Zhuge Qingxuan possibly take the risk to enter the depths of the Bloodrain Wilderness.

“What do you still want?” Cloudsky said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan suddenly said with a stern countenance, “I want your Holy City to step forward and resist the fiend race!”

Cloudsky’s face fell, and he said, “As long as the things you speak of are worth it, what’s the harm in resisting the fiend race?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “How about this, you show a bit of sincerity first. Send people to destroy the Medicine King Hall first. I’ll naturally tell the secrets I know.”

Cloudsky’s expression involuntarily changed when he heard that and said grimly, “Heh, you said it lightly! You entered the Bloodrain Wilderness for half a year already and are probably still unaware. This period of time, the Heavenly Sword Sect mustered up the power of the entire sect to attack the Medicine King Hall. In the end, they suffered grievous losses and were virtually completely wiped out! Jian Feiyang is seriously injured and dying, nearly losing his life! At present, these Eight Great Super Holy Lands already lost one! You’re also aware, Jian Feiyang’s Sword Dao cultivation is not beneath this lord. Even he couldn’t get any results, it will be of no help at all even if this lord goes too! Even if really making a move, need to wait for Qingxuan to come back first, then talk.”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned intent, his brows involuntarily knitting together.

He urged Sword Thirteen not to act rashly without careful thought back then. He did not think that the Heavenly Sword Sect still acted arbitrarily. In the end, they ended up in such a state!

Hearing that, Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “Since that’s the case, then there’s nothing to talk about.”

The moment Cloudsky heard, he hurriedly said, “How about this, this lord will issue a Heavenly Saint Order first, summoning the entire Divine Realm, and joining hands to deal with the Medicine King Hall. What do you think?”

Ye Yuan’s expression eased up, and he said, “That’s more like it!”

“Ji Qingyun, our sincerity is already brought out. I wonder where is your good faith? At the very least, you also have to let this lord take a look at whether or not it’s worth it for the Holy City to do so, right?” Cloudsky said.

What he used was a delaying tactic, planning on coaxing out some secrets of becoming a deity from Ye Yuan’s mouth.

As for dealing with the Medicine King Hall, forget it!

The Holy City absolutely would not meddle in the affairs of the fiend race!

Ye Yuan’s face suddenly revealed a smile and said, “You really want to know?”

Cloudsky immediately said, “Of course!”

Ye Yuan slowly nodded his head and said, “Okay, then I’ll tell you. The secret to becoming a deity is actually ...”

Ye Yuan deliberately dragged his tone out, keeping people in suspense.

Including Cloudsky, everyone craned their necks, wanting to hear this startling secret from Ye Yuan’s mouth.

But right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

Ye Yuan’s figure instantly vanished from where he was.

Merging into heaven and earth!

When he appeared again, Ye Yuan already arrived not far from Guo Xu!

Ye Yuan and Guo Xu were not far in the first place. This merging into heaven and earth was something that happened in virtually a blink of an eye. Everyone did not react to it.

Guo Xu was currently paying close attention, listening attentively to what kind of secret Ye Yuan was going to say, but did not expect such a sudden turn of events to occur.

Guo Xu’s scalp tingled at this instant. A feeling of extreme danger welled up in his heart.

“Courting death!”

Guo Xu’s reaction could not be said to not be quick. He opened up his own divine king domain at the first moment.

But, it was all futile.

A terrifying streak of sword energy easily broke apart his divine king domain.

He had yet to come around to his sense what was going on when the Evil Extermination Divine Sword was already propped against his neck.

All of this was completed in virtually a blink of an eye.

When Cloudsky reacted to it, he was incredibly alarmed and furious. Using a gaze that could kill people to look at Ye Yuan, he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Ji brat, you dare to trick me?”
