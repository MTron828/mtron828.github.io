Chapter 1996: Destined to Meet but Not Fated to Be Together

“Damn it, what trickery did you play?” Jian Sutao glared at Ye Yuan as he said.

Ye Yuan just said coolly, “You’re also looking down on me, Ye Yuan, too much. The things that I, Ye Yuan, promised, I’d never go back on my word. I said it before; take it if you have the ability.”

Jian Sutao gritted his teeth and said, “I don’t believe that I can’t deal with a dead person’s bone!”

Done talking, Jian Sutao’s Empyrean pressure suddenly released. Raising his hand, a streak of divine essence fired out, enveloping the emperor bone.

The power of an Empyrean was formidable to the extreme. Ye Yuan who was by the side had a deathly pale complexion.

But right at this time, the emperor bone radiated a brilliant light and gave off a gentle, but powerful energy, which actually pushed Jian Sutao’s Empyrean pressure back.

Jian Sutao’s face changed, and then the divine essence in his palm increased more in power.

However, this gentle energy was like a spring; the more he exerted strength, the greater the rebound force.

Bang!

Jian Sutao finally could not bear it and was directly sent flying by this powerful force.

Then, that Qilin emperor bone slowly flew up and actually automatically returned to Ye Yuan’s hand.

Jian Sutao’s expression was very ugly. At this point, how could he still not understand that this was the emperor bone having its own will, not willing to follow him?

Except, he was very perplexed. This Qilin emperor bone had already existed for God knows how many billions of years. Why would it still have such terrifying energy?

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Sutao and said coolly, “You calculated everything and had children of destiny seize the emperor bone for you. But you didn’t expect that only someone acknowledged by the emperor bone can take it away, right?”

Jian Sutao’s expression was very ugly. A trace of fresh blood dripping down from the corners of his mouth. His internal organs already sustained injuries.

He looked at Ye Yuan and said coldly, “What an insolent brat! Do you really think that this Empyrean doesn’t dare to touch you?”

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “It’s not that I’m looking down on you, but you really don’t dare to touch me. When I entered the Ancient God Battlefield this time, that Heavenly Emperor powerhouse of your Jian Family was constantly spying on me. Now, I reckon that even Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets also knows all about my actions inside the Ancient God Battlefield. If my conjectures are right, Profound Secrets Bodhimanda’s order is already on its way.”

Jian Sutao smiled dismissively and said, “You’re using Ancestor Profound Secrets to intimidate me? Huhu, putting this aside, how can the spying of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse be what you, a mere True God Realm, can detect?”

The spying of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, ordinary martial artists naturally could not discover it.

But the cultivation method that Ye Yuan cultivated was extremely special, pointing straight at the source of Great Dao. He was very sensitive to this kind of spying.

Otherwise, he would not have discovered Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s spying too.

Even though it was just a trace of blurry feel, this feeling constantly existed since entering the Ancient God Battlefield. This clearly indicated that someone was continuing to spy on him.

And in the Ancient God Battlefield, who else had this ability apart from Jian Rong?

Ye Yuan understood in his heart that since the Jian Family’s upper echelons paid attention to him, then they absolutely would not deal a killing blow to him.

The Jian Family members’ curiosity was very strong.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said smilingly, “Don’t your Jian Family believe in fate the most? Then with your judgment of me, do you feel that I’d be such a short-lived person?”

Jian Sutao could not help choking when he heard that.

That was right. Although he could not directly use the aura viewing art on Ye Yuan, he could feel Ye Yuan’s exuberance to the extreme destiny. It absolutely did not look short-lived.

This point, even Jian Hongxiao could detect it. As the Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital’s master, studying the mysteries of good fortune, how could he not be able to feel it?

Could it be that ... what Ye Yuan said was true?

Speaking of it was coincidental too.

Right at this time, Jian Sutao’s mind stirred, and actually received a voice transmission.

This transmission was actually ... personally relayed by Heavenly Emperor Yunshang!

Jian Sutao’s shock was by no means trivial.

He looked at Ye Yuan with a look of astonishment, his eyes full of disbelief.

Who was Heavenly Emperor Yunshang?

That was one of the Jian Family’s ancestors, a Transcendent Heavenly Emperor super powerhouse!

Although Jian Sutao was a powerhouse of a region too, compared to Heavenly Emperor Yunshang, he was nothing!

Heavenly Emperor Yunshang was Ancestor Profound Secrets’s biological son!

Ancestor Profound Secrets had lived for countless millions of years; his offspring was numerous.

But those that could live until now like him could be counted on one hand.

This Heavenly Emperor Yunshang was one of the remaining few with great accomplishments!

With Heavenly Emperor Yunshang personally passing on the voice transmission, what did that represent?

It represented that Ancestor Profound Secrets might really be paying close attention to Ye Yuan!

This ... How was this possible?

“Sutao, this emperor bone isn’t fated with our Jian Family. So don’t make things difficult for Ye Yuan because of this. Additionally, you and Hongxiao have to pay closer attention to this child. Understood?”

Heavenly Emperor Yunshang’s words directly sounded out inside Jian Sutao’s mind

“Yes, Sutao understood!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Jian Sutao had a solemn look, immediately answering in his mind.

There was just this one sentence and Heavenly Emperor Yunshang did not make any more sound.

Opposite of him, when Ye Yuan saw Jian Sutao’s entire body tremble, he instantly understood.

He did not expect that this piece of instruction came right in the nick of time.

Everything before was all his conjectures. Him saying these naturally had some intention of intimidating the other party.

But now, all of his guesses were confirmed.

It seemed like the one that paid attention to him inside the passageway was really Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets!

Jian Sutao stared at Ye Yuan. He was unable to calm down his emotion for a long time.

This boy was truly freakish to the point of making people speechless.

The prying of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, even he was also unable to detect it. So how did this boy know?

Also, even if Heavenly Emperor Jian Rong spied on him, how did he know that he was being followed by Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets?

If Jian Rong’s spying was detected by him, he could still understand it.

But who was Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets?

In this Heavenspan World, those able to compete with Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets absolutely did not surpass the number of fingers on both hands.

His might was affirmed through countless years.

A True God Realm like Ye Yuan, just what kind of capital did he rely on to detect Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s prying into?

Also, what kind of being was Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets?

This art of prying into heaven’s secrets was created by his elderly self.

If he was curious about Ye Yuan, wouldn’t he perform a divination himself?

Or was it that even Ancestor Profound Secrets could not divine Ye Yuan’s destiny too?

This ... This was simply inconceivable.

The suspicion in Jian Sutao’s heart became increasingly stronger. The more he thought, the more alarmed he got; the more he thought, the more curious he got.

His curiosity was like a cat scratching, almost scratching his heart into pieces.

However, he really did not dare to spy on Ye Yuan!

Rather, it was Ye Yuan who looked at Jian Sutao with an unperturbed look and said coolly, “Looks like you’ve already received the news. I can only tell you that you’re destined to meet this emperor bone but not fated to be together.”

“Puhwark!”

Jian Sutao could not resist spewing out a mouthful of old blood.

For the sake of this Qilin emperor bone, he waited for no idea how many tens of thousands of years. But in the end, it was obtained by this brat.

The key was that the higher ups even issued a death-order to not get involved with this thing anymore.

Except, if it was gone, it was gone. But could Ye Yuan freaking not ... show off his cleverness after what had happened?

Jian Sutao regretted it until his intestines were green now. If he had long known, he would not have let Ye Yuan enter the Ancient God Battlefield.

Now, things were great, it all became a wedding gift for Ye Yuan.

But then again, could it be that this was also foreordained by the heavens?
