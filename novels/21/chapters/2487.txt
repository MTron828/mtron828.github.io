Chapter 2493: Who’s Faster!

“Die! Die! Die! Die for this ancestor! Damn thing, to actually dare trick this ancestor! This ancestor wants you dead!”

Lin Chaotian practically went mad. One palm after another landed on Ye Yuan’s body.

Each palm was stronger than the last, continuously without ceasing.

Wood-attribute rule had a tenacious life force to begin with, stretching long and unbroken.

His palm force was like a huge wave, scouring Ye Yuan’s body over and over again.

Ye Yuan still did not fight back. He just gritted his teeth and persevered.

His internal organs were practically almost shattered already.

His body of steel had also been broken in many sections.

But he still did not fight back!

Pang Zhen three people had tears pouring down their faces, not even daring to look over.

“Alas! Alas! Alas! Your Excellency, you … should fight back! I’m begging you, fight back!” Pang Zhen used his fist to smash on the ground fiercely as he wept bitterly.

By the side, Zhang Zhen’s expression flickered indeterminately.

Even he was also somewhat envious of Pang Zhen three people.

With such a brother, what did you need to ask for!

Unfortunately, it was impossible for him to become Ye Yuan’s brother! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Kneel for this ancestor!”

All of a sudden, Lin Chaotian kicked Ye Yuan’s calf bone.

It was only to hear a crack. Ye Yuan’s calf bone broke at the sound of it.

However, he did not kneel!

His complexion turned white from pain, but he still did not kneel down!

“Ptooey!”

Ye Yuan spat a mouthful of blood, carrying Sword Dao will. Lin Chaotian actually could not evade it and had his face spat at.

“Lin Chaotian, you’ve vented it out too! But you’d best not touch some bottom-line! Making this Ye kneel down, you aren’t worthy!” Ye Yuan’s words were icy-cold to the extreme.

Lin Chaotian having his face spat at immediately flew into a great rage and said, “If this ancestor insists on making you kneel?”

“Then … at the risk of the three of them dying, this Ye will cut you down here too!” Ye Yuan’s words did not carry the slightest emotion.

Lin Chaotian’s gaze turned dark, furious but not speaking.

He understood Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan was too proud!

No matter what the circumstances, it was impossible for him to submit!

Making Ye Yuan kneel, that was something absolutely impossible.

He did not doubt Ye Yuan’s words at all.

Because he knew that Ye Yuan would really do it!

He only said that because he was extremely angry just now.

Calming down at this time, he discovered that he had the tempo led by Ye Yuan a little instead.

The teasing earlier made him burn with fury.

But now, he felt rather disinterested!

Ye Yuan this person could be killed, but he could not be humiliated!

“Humph!?Now, have you decided how to choose?” Lin Chaotian said with a cold snort.

This was equivalent to him compromising!

Zhang Zhen stared dumbfounded, his mouth agape. Ye Yuan was already almost dying. Yet, Lin Chaotian was actually stopping?

This kind of feeble threat could be effective too?

How could he know that Ye Yuan could not be killed at all!

Even if he destroyed his physical body, it was useless too.

Ye Yuan could not die!

“I’ve decided. I’ll save the two of them!” Ye Yuan lifted his finger with difficulty and pointed towards Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets and Wan Zhen.

This time, he did not hesitate.

Wan Zhen’s entire body shook and he said angrily, “Your Excellency, I don’t need your help!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was also greatly enraged and said, “Ye Yuan, this emperor doesn’t want you to save! Save them!”

But Lin Chaotian laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… What bullshit brother! Pang Zhen boy, saw that? You’re not even a fart in his eyes!”

Pang Zhen was covered in blood and similarly laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… How can a self-centered, despicable, and shameless villain like you, understand the feelings between us brothers? Your Excellency, well done!”

He did not have any complaints about Ye Yuan!

In reality, no matter who Ye Yuan saved, the other two would not complain.

Just as Pang Zhen said, the feelings between them brothers, Lin Chaotian would never understand it.

Because in Lin Chaotian’s eyes, there was only self interest!

They could stab two knives into their ribs for their brothers, could throw away their lives, and could give everything up!

This sort of feeling already penetrated deep into the bone marrow long ago.

How could a cold-blooded person understand?

On the contrary, not only would Pang Zhen not resent Ye Yuan, but he would also feet heartache for Ye Yuan instead.

Because he knew how much courage Ye Yuan needed to make this decision!

The pain in Ye Yuan’s heart was probably even more serious than the injuries on his body right now!

Ye Yuan closed his eyes painfully and said, “Brother, I’m sorry! I … I only have two rule crystals!”

The current Pang Zhen seemed to have forgotten the pain on his body, and he said with a loud laugh, “My lord, thank you! It was a great honor for this Pang to be able to follow Your Excellency in this lifetime! It was you who taught me how to be an upright person! It was you who let me grow! In the next life, I hope that I can continue following Your Excellency!”

Lin Chaotian discovered that his inciting act did not take any effect at all.

He indeed could not quite understand why Pang Zhen was still loyal and devoted toward Ye Yuan under this kind of circumstances.

Swoosh!

A rule crystal flew toward Lin Chaotian.

He reached his hand out and grabbed it in his hand.

His face was full of joy.

Fire rule crystal!

“Hahaha?… Fire rule crystal, really a good thing! The fire rule crystal being placed with Ancestor Fire that fool was really too wasteful! Now, this ancestor obtained the fire rule crystal. Even if I am facing Tian Qing, what do I have to fear?” Lin Chaotian let out a burst of wild laughter after he obtained the fire rule crystal.

What he wanted to obtain the most was the fire rule crystal.

Wood begets fire!

Obtaining the fire rule crystal, his strength would increase exponentially!

Previously, he helped Ancestor Fire with wood-attribute power of rule, causing Fire Dance Frenzied Demon this move to become unbelievably strong.

However, that was only because his application of wood-attribute rule reached a transcendent level.

If he controlled wood-attribute rule and fire-attribute rule at the same time, what did Fire Dance Frenzied Demon count for?

When the Heavenspan Mountain opened, one person could only refine one rule crystal.

But, after Heavenly Dao Samsara, they could refine a second rule crystal!

Mastering two great rules, Lin Chaotian’s strength would reach an extremely terrifying realm!

“Release them!” Ye Yuan said with a cold yell.

Lin Chaotian smiled slightly and waved his hand casually, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was directly swept in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan fired out a stream of divine essence, catching Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets.

He did not care about his own injuries, immediately checking Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ body, and his expression could not help changing.

Within Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s body, an incomparably powerful wood-attribute power of rule was hidden in the divine sea!

Clearly, it was done by Lin Chaotian.

As long as his mind stirred, this wood-attribute power of rule would immediately explode, blowing Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets into smithereens.

When Lin Chaotian saw this scene, he could not help but smile slightly and said,?“Huhu,?gave up? See if it’s your sword that’s faster, or my thought that’s faster! Alright, there’s still a water-attribute rule crystal, hand it over!”

Hearing this, Zhang Zhen’s entire body trembled. A look of wild ecstasy brimmed over on his face.

The reason why he agreed with Lin Chaotian was for this rule crystal!

What bullshit brotherhood, what loyalty? In front of Dao Ancestor, what did it count for?

Ye Yuan took out the water rule crystal and threw it to Lin Chaotian without the slightest hesitation.

Lin Chaotian was also full of joy.

He and Zhang Zhen both swore a Heavenly Dao Oath. He would obtain a rule crystal and give it to Zhang Zhen.

And when Zhang Zhen became a Dao Ancestor, he would pledge loyalty to him forever!

He swept his sleeves grandly, sweeping the rule crystal over.

But right at this time, his divine soul suddenly felt an intense stabbing pain, as if it was being pierced by ten thousand fine needles.

In an instant, his consciousness fell into stagnation.
