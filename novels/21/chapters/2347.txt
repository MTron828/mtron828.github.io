Chapter 2353: Major Reversal!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“He must have gone to the Myriad Beast Battle Plain. Otherwise, it’s impossible to get so many god of war points within a year!”

“Bullshit! Don’t you know that Wan Zhen is in the Myriad Beast Battle Plain too? He only obtained several tens of thousands of points!”

“That can only mean that Ye Yuan’s efficiency is too high! Could it be that he really comprehended time law?”

“That’s impossible! Even Wan Zhen couldn’t comprehend it. So what right does he have?”

... ...

Over 500 thousand god of war points in a year, this number shocked all of the unpredictable children in the city.

Hence, Ye Yuan was speculating how Ye Yuan obtained so many god of war points.

Everyone had different opinions about this matter.

No matter who, they could not explain it either.

Because apart from Ye Yuan, no one could achieve this.

Wan Zhen could not as well!

Hence, everyone waited to see, waiting for the update of the God of War Golden List next year.

A year’s time was merely a snap of a finger.

The day when the God of War Golden List was announced again, arrived very quickly.

“I don’t believe that this guy can really overturn the heavens! His ranking is so high now. The god of war points obtained will be greatly reduced! If he can get 200 thousand this time, it will already be very impressive!” Jiang Zhe predicted very confidently.

Everyone deeply felt that way too!

Not that they were looking down on Ye Yuan, but that this was an inevitable trend.

Along with the increase in ranking, getting god of war points would become harder and harder.

Even if your combat strength surpassed all others, you would always run into the upper limits of your own strength.

In a short thousand years’ time, how could it be possible to continuously be improving, and challenging high-level fierce beasts endlessly?

This was illogical!

“I also feel that the god of war points he obtained this time should be between 200 thousand to 300 thousand. This time next year, it will definitely be even lesser; between 100 thousand to 200 thousand.”

“Mn, it should be like this. He hasn’t taken action for so many years, having an outbreak period is a very normal phenomenon. But it also ends here. Later, it will get slower and slower.”

“Top ten is definitely enough to choke on. But within top 30 shouldn’t be an issue anymore.”

... ...

Everyone was all discussing the limits of Ye Yuan’s strength and calculated that Ye Yuan’s final result would be between 1.2 million to 1.4 million.

At the rate of the current trend, this god of war points was already sufficient to rank into the top 30.

But wanting to rank in the top ten, there was basically no chance.

Very soon, the golden book pages unfurled once more. Everyone had looks of anticipation on their faces.

The first place impressively still was Wan Zhen, without the slightest suspense.

But what surprised people was that Wan Zhen actually obtained a lump sum of 130 thousand god of war points this time, reaching more than 3.28 million!

This was a very horrifying number for his rank.

And the second place Zhang Lian actually increased more than 110 thousand god of war points too!

This chance made everyone rather surprised.

“How did Wan Zhen gain so many god of war points in this one year? Even if he casually hunted some fierce beasts now, it’s also impossible for Zhang Lian to catch up to him too, right?”

“There’s also Zhang Lian! These two people are suddenly struggling fiercely. What in the world are they afraid of?”

“Heh, maybe, they know about Ye Yuan’s sudden emergence, it’s also not impossible that they are afraid of him catching up!”

“Hahaha ... How is that possible! Even if give him another 100 years, he can’t catch up too!”

... ...

These words, everyone naturally just treated it as a joke. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

No one would really take Ye Yuan seriously!

Ye Yuan just started, while Wan Zhen’s god of war points was six times of Ye Yuan’s.

How could this gap possibly be caught up to within a short seven years?

According to everyone’s guesses, the greatest likelihood was still that these two people were going all out.

How could they know that Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian’s pressure came from precisely Ye Yuan!

Ever since they saw that Ye Yuan comprehended time law, the two of them seem to have gone crazy, desperately hunting fierce beasts.

They continuously challenged their limits, carrying out a slaughter frenziedly.

In this one year, the two people’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds, increasing significantly.

However, they did not dare to slack off in the slightest.

Because there was someone chasing from behind!

Looking further down, the top 30 was followed with close interest.

But, when the pages opened to the 30th place, everyone was shocked.

Only to see that on the third place from the bottom of the page, a golden name was written impressively: Ye Yuan!

28th place, Ye Yuan!

God of war points, 1,239,804!

In this instant, the unpredictable children in the entire square felt that their breathing became somewhat labored.

Those people who predicted Ye Yuan’s god of war points previously all collectively lost their voices now.

The originally noisy square instantly quietened down.

Suddenly, someone said rather uncertainly, “This ... He entered the top 30 already? My eyes aren’t failing me, right?”

“One year, 600 thousand god of war points, really blinded my eyes! Rising so many places in the ranking, his god of war points actually didn’t drop, but increased instead! How did he do it?”

In the crowd, Jiang Zhe suddenly yelled hysterically, “The God of War Golden List must have made a mistake! There absolutely must be a mistake! One year 600 thousand, how can someone possibly achieve it?”

Not knowing why, he suddenly rather a little flustered.

One year 600 thousand god of war points, this kind of thing simply subverted his understanding.

“Right, there must be a mistake! This guy must have found this world’s loophole! Otherwise, how can this year be even more than last year?” Someone immediately agreed.

“It must be like this! See his ranking next year then!”

When the matter exceeded everyone’s understanding, they habitually let their imaginations run wild, finding all sorts of reasons to deny this phenomenon.

Especially for these geniuses, they did not want to acknowledge that someone was so much stronger than them.

... ...

In the fourth year.

Everyone already did not care about Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian anymore. Everyone’s attention was all on Ye Yuan!

After a year’s time, what place would Ye Yuan charge to this time?

When the golden book pages slowly opened, everyone’s expressions solidified once more.

13th place!

Over 1.7 million god of war points!

A year’s time, Ye Yuan increased by another 500 thousand!

Although it was a little less than last year, Ye Yuan still maintained the rapid growth momentum.

He was only a step away from the top ten!

As a result, the idea of a loophole in the rules caused a huge clamor once more!

Jiang Zhe already did not know how to describe his feelings. A few years ago, he ridiculed Ye Yuan over and over again, saying that it was laughable for Ye Yuan to make a frantic last-minute effort.

But now, he already became the most laughable person.

Ye Yuan used a rocket-like speed of rising to prove his ridiculousness.

So what if there were only ten years left?

“Insane, insane, insane! Really too crazy! In the last ten years, could it be that Ye Yuan is going to make a major comeback?”

“This guy wouldn’t be aiming for first place, right?”

“My god, close to 3.5 million god of war points, and it’s still growing! If it’s surpassed by him, wouldn’t the heavens change?”

... ...

At this time, some people thought of this possibility. They could not help being filled with fear!

Could Wan Zhen’s throne of first place be protected in the final six years?
