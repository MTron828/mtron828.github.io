Chapter 1651 Unfathomable.

“What a joke! Who does your City Lord Manor think we are? Your father will snatch people from you guys! What can you, Mu Dong, do to me? Liu Han, scram to one side for your father. Careful because I will squeeze you until you explode!” Du Mingliang said with a cold laugh.

“Du Mingliang, you’re so domineering! Going or not, doesn’t seem like you have the final say, right?” Liu Han said with a sneer.

“You all get lost to one side for your Father! Our City Lord Manor is on the orthodox side. Little Brother Ye Yuan should naturally go to the City Lord Manor first!” Mu Dong said.

Mu Dong came from the City Lord Manor, while Liu Han was the Blood Rainbow Manor’s messenger.

The moment the three people met, they got into an argument, with signs of striking at a word of disagreement.

Even though the three families jointly founded the Heavenly Network Gathering, the struggle between themselves had never stopped before.

This capital city, even the City Lord Manor could not suppress the other two major powers. The havoc could be seen at a glance.

The other two families did not have any respect for the City Lord Manor at all.

Now, Ye Yuan suddenly appeared. These three major factions naturally wanted to build a good relationship with him.

This Riverluck Capital City was a very sensitive place. Everyone fought each other and was also apprehensive of each other.

For Ye Yuan to be able to take out so many void spirit divine pills at once, and also have Ning Tianping, this third-layered heaven Divine Lord as a guard, they had no choice but to speculate about Ye Yuan’s identity.

The three families came to find Ye Yuan. They naturally had to investigate things.

Even though Ning Tianping called Ye Yuan brother out of his mouth, that respectful attitude could not be concealed. People with a discerning eye could tell at a glance.

Furthermore, such a young Divine Lord Realm powerhouse like Ning Tianping, only a major force could groom him.

This way, Ye Yuan’s identity was definitely extraordinary.

Moreover, how could ordinary forces be able to groom such a heaven-defying alchemist?

Therefore, these three families were very polite toward Ye Yuan.

If they were not wary of Ye Yuan’s identity, with these three major forces’ domineeringness, how could they possibly talk nicely to Ye Yuan? They would directly capture him and be done with it.

The three people were arguing unceasingly when Ye Yuan suddenly said, “When have I said that I’m going back with you all? You all please return. I still have to refine pills at night, so I don’t have time to be a guest! Want to buy medicinal pills, please be early tomorrow. Not buying medicinal pills, don’t waste my time!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan directly circled around the three groups of people and went far away.

The three people looked at Ye Yuan leaving blankly just like that. No one actually dared to go up and stop.

Ye Yuan deliberately did so. The more unfathomable he was, the greater these guys would feel that he had a strong background.

His strength plus cocky attitude was sufficient to make the three major forces not dare to act rashly without careful consideration.

Ye Yuan coming to Riverluck Capital City was just passing and could not stay for long. He could not be bothered to have any entanglements with the native forces here.

Furthermore, in a place like this, the three major forces were all cunning foxes. If he really went, he would let the cat out of the bag instead.

Hence, might as well just ignore them!

Sure enough, the three sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses, no one dared to make a move to stop. Ye Yuan swaggered away and left just like this.

When the surrounding martial artists saw this scene, their eyeballs popped out.

These three great factions domineeringly occupied Riverluck Capital City. No one dared to provoke in the vicinity at all.

It was said that these three great factions all had powerhouses supporting them at the back. They were not merely seventh-layered heaven Divine Lords.

All in all, this Riverluck Capital City was a large cake, everyone wanted a piece.

But such powerful three forces, no one actually dared to make a move against this Origin Deity Realm brat!

Clever people understood what was going on, dumb ones ... was only left with shock. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The three major forces’ masters repeatedly exhorted them before coming, for these three people to not easily offend Ye Yuan.

In the end, Ye Yuan did not even pay attention to them.

The three people exchanged glances, discovering that the quarreling just now was plain silly, and could only turn around and leave.

...

At the Sword Star Alliance, Alliance Chief Li Xing was not surprised after listening to Du Mingliang’s report.

“Alliance Chief, this boy is truly condescending! If not for your many exhortations, I’d really skin him just now!” Du Mingliang said angrily.

His strength was the well-deserving of being the number two person in the Sword Star Alliance. Normally, the wind and rain were at his beck and call. Today, he was actually ignored by an Origin Deity Realm kid, how could he not be angry?

Li Xing’s gaze flickered, but he asked, “Oh, Mingliang, do you think that kid’s condescension could be feigned?”

Du Mingliang shook his head and said, “Impossible! I’ve never seen before an Origin Deity Realm who dares to be so arrogant, completely not taking the three of us seriously! I, Old Du, followed you for so many years, I still have this bit of eye prowess. Moreover, wasn’t Liu Han and Mu Dong there too? Even if he can fool me, it’s also not possible to fool the three of us at the same time, right?”

Li Xing nodded when he heard that and said, “Then that’s right! Only people who are accustomed to high-level powerhouses can disregard sixth-layered heaven Divine Lords like this. This kid’s background definitely isn’t small! Forget it. If he’s not coming, don’t come then. As long as he doesn’t go to the other two, that will do.”

Du Mingliang said, “Then ... that’s it? It’s said that this kid can refine level nine difficulty void spirit divine pills. If he can be used by us, then ... wouldn’t it be effortless for us to finish off the other two families?”

Li Xing laughed in spite of himself when he heard it and said, “Finish off the other two families? You can forget about it! Once there’s one among the three of us that falls, then the entire Riverluck Capital City will definitely have to be reshuffled anew! The other two families are absolutely unable to escape by sheer luck! It’s been so many years. Do you, Old Du, still can’t see it clearly?”

Du Mingliang was just a martial person and really could not understand the intricacies involved.

How powerful the strength behind Sword Star Alliance was, only Li Xing himself knew.

When Du Mingliang heard this, he was startled inwardly too.

Li Xing smiled and said, “Don’t look at how our three families fight and kill. In reality, we’ve maintained a relative restraint. Once this balance is broken, then the consequences will be too ghastly to imagine! Therefore, even though this kid is monstrous, he’s not what we can afford to enjoy! This kind of monstrous alchemist can only be groomed by a super major force. And only they can afford to enjoy his ability.”

Pausing for a bit, Li Xing continued, “If my conjectures are right, this kid is very likely a genius disciple groomed by some imperial capital. He came out to train this time. That third-layered heaven Divine Lord kid is clearly not what ordinary major factions can nurture too! Furthermore, he might just be a cover and there’s still a true powerhouse lurking in the city! The Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate is about to open, so we’d best not bring up unnecessary ramifications!”

The more Du Mingliang listened, the more alarmed he got. Only then did he know how grim the situation in the city right now was.

Similar scenes were playing out in the old lairs of the other two major forces.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s identity, they were similarly extremely suspicious.

While Ye Yuan at this time already found a place to stay in the city and started to refine pills overnight.

Those extremely difficult medicinal pills, those able to afford them were in the small minority after all.

Billions of divine essence stones at every turn, even ordinary Divine Lord Realm powerhouses could not possibly take it out too.

Hence, the spirit medicines that he made Ning Tianping buy were all relative to some cheap medicinal pills.

There were still nine days left. It was enough for him to make a killing.
