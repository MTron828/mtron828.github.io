Chapter 2439: Justice Lies in the Hearts of People!

“Ye Yuan, do you know back then, how many of our powerhouses died tragically at Daymeld’s hands? You let him go, how many powerhouses will die at his hands? If you don’t give the world an explanation today, you can forget about walking out of Origin Enlighten Hall!” Dao Ancestor Destruction said in a deep voice.

The interrogation of two great Dao Ancestors, how frightening was it?

Especially Dao Ancestor Destruction, the destruction rule that he unwittingly radiated seemed to make even space tremble.

The powerhouses present, even if they reached Deva Fifth Blight, felt tremendous pressure too.

Everyone’s gazes were focused on Ye Yuan, wanting to see how he defends himself.

After all, this matter could not be justified no matter what.

When Ye Yuan heard that, he laughed in spite of himself and said, “Explanation? Explain what? I, Ye Yuan, follow my conscience when I do things. Why do I need to explain to you?”

The numerous powerhouses opened their mouths wide, looking at Ye Yuan with shocked faces.

This guy actually dared to speak to Dao Ancestors like this!

Also, Ye Yuan already came to Origin Enlighten Mountain Range. He was actually not defending himself?

Then what did he come here for?

They discovered that they could not see through Ye Yuan at all and totally did not know what he wanted to do.

Even the Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets who came with Ye Yuan was also standing there in a daze currently, at a loss on what to do.

Lin Chaotian was clearly taken aback too and said in a firm voice, “So, you’re admitting that you betrayed the human race?”

Since Ye Yuan did not provide an explanation, then it could not be better.

This sentence of his was equivalent to confirming Ye Yuan’s name of betrayal.

This way, it would be much easier to do things.

But Ye Yuan laughed boldly and said, “Hahaha ... Whether this Ye betrayed the human race or not, you shouldn’t be asking me this! You go and ask those warriors who fought side by side with me! You go and ask those heroic spirits who died on the battlefield! Or you can go and ask those major powerhouses who passed away in the same era as you!”

When he said these words, Ye Yuan had an awe-inspiring aura, emanating an impressive righteous aura on his body.

The name of Saint Azure was clear at a glance!

Although he did not have the power of a Dao Ancestor, the name of Saint Azure was cultivated by his righteous aura. How could it be blasphemed?

At this moment, Ye Yuan’s aura was actually not the slightest bit inferior to the nine great Dao Ancestors!

He contended with the power of the nine great Dao Ancestors with his power alone!

These were two vastly different kinds of auras.

The aura of a Dao Ancestor was the aura of a sovereign, it was spontaneously brought forth by their powerful strength.

But Ye Yuan’s aura was an awe-inspiring righteous aura, condensed and formed after transmigrating ten billion years!

Although he did not experience the time of ten billion years, this ten billion years of spacetime existed because of him!

Ye Yuan was simply disdainful to justify for himself, justice was in the hearts of people!

It was not that he did not want to kill Daymeld, but that he could not hold Daymeld.

Li-er’s present strength was not the slightest bit inferior to his.

If he had assurance in killing Daymeld, he absolutely would not show mercy.

It was just that, he could not be bothered to explain these at all.

The expressions of someone as powerful as Lin Chaotian also changed slightly at this time.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s body could actually release such a powerful force.

Indeed well-deserving of being Saint Azure who founded an eternally flourishing age, he was not that easy to deal with!

In the crowd, Ni Xuan’s expression flickered indeterminately. Suddenly, he took a deep breath and stepped forward to clasp his hands and said, “Lord Dao Ancestors, Ni Xuan has always been fighting alongside Lord Saint Azure. Ni Xuan has seen every little bit about him! Ni Xuan is willing to guarantee with my Dao foundation that Lord Saint Azure absolutely won’t betray the human race!”

His voice had yet to fade when Shi Potian also suddenly came forward and said, “Lord Saint Azure devoted himself to public interests. Shi Potian is also willing to guarantee with my Dao foundation and he absolutely won’t betray the human race!”

“I vouch for it!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I guarantee it too!”

... ...

These Deva Fifth Blight powerhouses who had fought alongside Ye Yuan suddenly erupted, coming forward to vouch for Ye Yuan one after another.

Along the way, Ye Yuan’s action and conduct, they took it all in their sights.

To say that Ye Yuan betrayed the human race, they had a hundred disbeliefs.

On the battlefield, Ye Yuan was always charging at the forefront.

The number of enemies killed, he was always the most too.

It was also precisely him who forged an army of young masters into an invincible iron army.

If not for Ye Yuan gathering the myriad races coalition forces together, there also would not have been a great victory later on, and then the retaking of the whole Heavenspan World!

How could such a person possibly betray the human race?

Daymeld’s incident, they did not understand.

But to say that Ye Yuan betrayed the human race, they did not believe it!

Being infected by Ye Yuan’s awe-inspiring righteous aura, they involuntarily stepped forward.

Actually, before this, many among them already adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

But Ye Yuan’s awe-inspiring righteous aura seemed to be able to invade the hearts of people, making them involuntarily follow.

Seeing this scene, the faces of the few great Dao Ancestors became very ugly.

The scene was already completely out of control!

They never thought that such a scene would actually occur.

But right at this time, one thunderous shout after another suddenly came in from outside, clearly audible in the entire Origin Enlighten Mountain Range!

“We beseech Dao Ancestors to rectify Lord Saint Azure’s name!”

“We beseech Dao Ancestors to rectify Lord Saint Azure’s name!”

“We beseech Dao Ancestors to rectify Lord Saint Azure’s name!”

... ...

The voices were like tidal waves.

The voices of many Deva Realms and Heavenly Emperor Realm powerhouses superimposed, that voice was practically about to collapse the entire Origin Enlighten Mountain Range.

Outside the mountain pass gates, Wan Zhen and Pang Zhen led the entire unpredictable legion’s warriors, several million of the human army’s warriors, as well as numerous powerhouses who remembered Ye Yuan’s achievements and gathered here one after another.

The numbers already reached as many as tens of millions!

Outside Origin Enlighten Mountain Range, many powerhouses blotted out the sun and sky, practically covering the entire sky.

This number was nothing to the human race.

But in today’s world, to be able to make so many people gather here to rectify one person’s name, probably even Dao Ancestors could not do it!

Before this, Ye Yuan strictly ordered them not to come over.

But this time, they violated Ye Yuan’s order.

“What are you all messing around for? Get out of here!” Lin Lang said with an angry roar.

It was just that facing millions of powerhouses, Lin Lang’s voice was directly suppressed. Nobody paid attention to him at all.

“Pang Zhen, you’re the descendant of a Dao Ancestor. How dare you be so unbridled?” Lin Lang came in front of Pang Zhen and said with a furious roar.

Pang Zhen directly ignored him and shouted loudly.

In the hall, the faces of many powerhouses changed abruptly.

No one could have thought that things actually turned out like this.

Originally, this was a trial against Ye Yuan.

But now, it became Ye Yuan’s solo performance.

Why did Lin Chaotian dread Ye Yuan?

It was because of his rallying power!

But he still underestimated Ye Yuan!

He did not expect that in this present era, Ye Yuan actually still had such formidable rallying power!

Yes, he naturally did not expect it.

How could he, this Dao Ancestor who was far removed from the masses and reality, be sympathetic to the suffering of the world?

When the world was going through chaos caused by war, they were apprehensive of the divine race’s strength and did not dare to make a move.

But Ye Yuan stepped forward!

He overpowered the raging tides and reversed a hopeless situation with his power alone, leading the myriad races to defeat the divine race!

This feat, who could compare to it?

Lin Chaotian was considering how to corroborate his Dao and achieve supremacy, breaking the shackles.

But Ye Yuan was doing things for the world in a down-to-earth manner.

Why did he need to provide an explanation to the world?

There was the phrase “Justice lies in the hearts of people!”
