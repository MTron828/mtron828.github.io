Chapter 1237: Trap

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Big Brother, it seems like those stonemen didn’t chase over. We’re saved,” White Light said with a lingering fear in his heart.

But Ye Yuan’s expression was not too good.

“Most likely, we’ve just escaped the tiger’s maws, but entered the wolves den again!” Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile.

White Light froze, somewhat puzzled.

Wasn’t this just a peach blossom forest in front of them?

Seeing his puzzled look, Ye Yuan said, “We’ve already entered another space. This peach blossom forest secretly encompasses the Dao of Array Formations. Furthermore, it’s incomparably profound. Even for me, it’s hard to resolve it too!”

White Light shock was by no means insignificant. Only then did he carefully size up this peach blossom forest.

It was just a pity that he was completely clueless about array formations and could not perceive anything at all.

“Don’t scare me, Big Brother!” White Light said speechlessly.

Ye Yuan said powerlessly, “Scare you for what? With the peach trees as the formation base, laying down such a large formation, the person who set the formation was truly remarkable! If I didn’t guess wrongly, this array formation was probably left behind by a Deity Realm powerhouse!”

White Light said in surprise, “No way, right? It’s just some ordinary peach trees, who cares what large formation. Just directly burn it, and wouldn’t it be done?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Can’t be burned! A moment of carelessness, and it will manipulate the fire and immolate yourself!”

White Light expression turned fearful and finally knew the seriousness of the matter.

He knew that Ye Yuan would not ramble nonsense. Even with Ye Yuan’s Formations Dao, he could not break this array formation. It could be imagined how terrifying this array formation was.

“Then what should we do now, Big Brother?”

“Wait for me to recover strength first!” Ye Yuan said.

Two days later, Ye Yuan’s sequela faded away completely. Only then did he size this peach blossom forest up meticulously. The more he looked, the more alarmed he got.

Before their eyes, there were three paths that could be taken.

Ye Yuan looked for a long time but kept not daring to move.

This peach blossom forest looked tranquil, but Ye Yuan knew that if he took one wrong step, it would arouse a fearsome killing trap.

White Light looked at Ye Yuan nervously by the side and also did not dare speak up to interrupt.

He discovered that on Ye Yuan’s forehead, fine sweat beads actually faintly surfaced!

It could be seen that Ye Yuan’s deduction was not that smooth.

This stop was 24 hours, an entire day’s time!

If it were before, White Light would not dare believe it at all that Ye Yuan had to spend such a long time to move one step inside the array formation.

It seemed like this array formation was truly extraordinary.

“Huuuu ...”

Following Ye Yuan spitting out a long breath of air, White Light’s nerves also eased up.

While Li-er lightly wiped away the sweat beads on Ye Yuan’s forehead, her eyes were full of sympathy.

Previously, Ye Yuan gave his full attention to study the array formation. She did not dare to go and interrupt either.

“How is it, Big Brother? Which path should we take?” White Light asked.

Ye Yuan’s expression was somewhat weary, but he still forcefully roused his spirits and said, “This one on the right, it should be safe.”

White Light did not notice, but Li-er looked at Ye Yuan with mild surprise.

He actually used ‘should’ this term, and not definitely!

Ye Yuan examined things for a full day’s time, and what he gave was actually just an ambiguous answer.

This array formation really incredible!

“I’ll go first!” Li-er spoke up without the slightest hesitation.

Finished talking, she opened up her footsteps, wanting to step on this right path.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh, knowing that Li-er’s thoughts were meticulous and saw through the flaws in his words. This was going to test the formation with her body.

Looking as Li-er was about to step onto that path, a flash of inspiration suddenly flashed in Ye Yuan’s mind!

“Hold on!” Ye Yuan shouted loudly.

Li-er’s foot was already halfway stepped out already. Once it landed, she would have thoroughly stepped onto that path.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s yell, she involuntarily withdrew her footstep.

“What is it, Big Brother Yuan?” Li-er said puzzledly.

In an instant, Ye Yuan’s body was already drenched in sweat. That foot landing, Li-er’s life would be gone!

“Sorry, Li-er, almost harmed you. That road is similarly a dead end! This array formation has killing intent hidden everywhere. I had a flash of inspiration just now and suddenly discovered that this path is actually a flaw that the array formation deliberately revealed!”

Ye Yuan had a look of lingering fear in his heart. The seemingly magnificent and gorgeous peach blossom forest actually surged with undercurrents.

One misstep, and it would mean perishing and Dao dissipating.

And just earlier, Ye Yuan discovered that the result he deduced for an entire day, was actually a flaw deliberately made by the grand array!

If Li-er’s step was taken, they would forever be separated by life and death!

But Li-er smiled without a care and said, “Big Brother Yuan is pitting skills with a Deity Realm Formations Dao powerhouse here. Not being sure is also normal, why is there a need to apologize to me? Moreover, aren’t I perfectly fine? At least this first round, it’s Big Brother Yuan who won!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ye Yuan secretly sighed. Li-er was always so composed and magnanimous and did not even bat an eyelid when braving fire and flood for him.

Having such a wife, what else did a husband need?

He already had a decision in his mind, if he could pacify the fiend calamity, he would definitely give Li-er a glorious wedding!

White Light also secretly lamented at the narrow shave and asked, “Big Brother, this path isn’t right, then which path should we take?”

“None of the paths are correct!” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

White Light and Li-er were both stunned, somewhat uncertain what it meant.

Ye Yuan extended his finger and pointed in a direction, saying, “Go from here.”

The two people were stunned again because the direction that Ye Yuan pointed had no path at all!

“Big Brother, this ...” White Light said at a loss.

Ye Yuan did not explain, immediately moving forward.

Right at this time, a scene that made White Light and Li-er astonished happened.

Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared right in front of them just like this!

The two people exchanged a glance and also caught up with Ye Yuan’s footsteps, walking over in that direction.

The two people only felt a blur before their eyes. Indeed, they passed through from inside a space.

But what made them astounded was that the scene before their eyes was exactly the same as what they saw previously.

This made them have an illusion as if they returned to where they were again!

“Big Brother Yuan, what’s going on here? Could it be that these peach blossoms are all illusions?” Li-er asked with a surprised look.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “When the real is treated as an illusion, the illusion is even more real than the truth. When what doesn’t exist is treated as something that exists, that fabricated truth is even more real than the truth that exists! It’s just that the level of the person who laid down the formation is too high, with peach blossoms as the medium, dividing this space into countless fragments. What we need to do is to walk out through the only one survival path from among these countless fragments! Uh ... just like walking through a maze.”

The two people were shocked when they heard it. To be able to use ordinary peach blossoms and lay down such an exquisite grand array, the means of the person who set the formation was truly inconceivable.

The means of Deity Realm powerhouses were totally not what they were able to surmise.

Receiving the stimulation of Li-er’s scene earlier, Ye Yuan swept away the decadence from before. That powerful self-confidence returned to him once again!

Ye Yuan could sense that the person who set the formation was absolutely someone with extraordinary Formations Dao strength.

He deduced step by step, but still almost fell into that Deity Realm powerhouse’s trap in the end.

Facing this grand array, he felt like he was crossing swords with that array deity powerhouse.

Receiving Li-er’s stimulus, Ye Yuan was currently surging with fighting-intent, and was bent on breaking this array formation!

So what if deity realm powerhouse?

Today, I, Ye Yuan, am going to extinguish the domineering influence of a Deity Realm powerhouse!
