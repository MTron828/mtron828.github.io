Chapter 1895: 2000-Year Agreement!

“You’re saying that I’m inferior to this trash? Do you know what realm Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli achieved presently? Heh, not long ago, Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli already broke through to True God Realm! Trash like Ye Yuan can only look at her back as long as he lived! He isn’t worthy of Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli!”

Lin Changqing’s words made everyone’s hearts quiver violently.

Including Zuo Shujie these people, they naturally knew Yue Mengli.

Back then when she left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, she was totally living under Ye Yuan’s light.

All the way until today, it was also merely less than a thousand years from when she left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, she actually already stepped into the realm of True God!

This kind of cultivation speed was simply unimaginable.

Also, this Lin Changqing, although the exact situation about his skeletal age could not be seen, his vitality was extremely exuberant, akin to the morning sun. Clearly, his age would not be too old either.

Such a young Empyrean powerhouse, to a character like Zuo Shujie, it was simply unimaginable.

Even if it was Ye Yuan and the rest, they had never seen before such a young Empyrean powerhouse too.

One had to know, even Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, that level of unrivaled powerhouses, also spent as long as 50 thousand years to cultivate to Heavenly Empyrean Realm.

Even though Ye Yuan displaying Dao mark previously made Lin Changqing very surprised, it was also merely just being surprised.

With his guesses, he reckoned that Ye Yuan obtained the Dao mark legacy by chance inside some mystic realm, that was how he was able to display it.

Although this kind of thing was rare, it was not impossible. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As for Ye Yuan cultivating Dao mark himself, Lin Changqing did not think in this area at all.

Because that was impossible!

Since time immemorial, there have been countless peerlessly talented people. No one had ever heard before that someone could cultivate out Dao mark at Celestial Deity Realm.

This kind of Dao mark legacy, used once and it would reduce once, belonging to a consumable item.

A long way down the road, how many times could Ye Yuan use?

Moreover, even if Ye Yuan possessed that flimsy Dao mark, he was also not his match at all.

“You ... Who the hell are you?” Ye Yuan stared at Lin Changqing fixed and asked with clenched jaws.

Ye Yuan’s eyes made Lin Changqing pleased with himself inwardly.

Clearly, his words earlier triggered Ye Yuan.

Lin Changqing laughed coldly and said, “You don’t need to know who I am. You just need to know that you and Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli are impossible! You and she are already not people in the same world! Don’t say that this Empyrean is unreasonable. Here is a divine-grade Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill here. It can help you cultivate to the True God Realm! But at that time, Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli will already be an Empyrean!”

Originally, he was disdainful to explain these to Ye Yuan.

But now that he could not kill Ye Yuan, Lin Changqing planned on explaining clearly the disparity between him and Yue Mengli.

This way, as long as Ye Yuan still had a tiny trace of self-respect, he would not go find Yue Mengli either.

He Chong’s pupils constricted as he said, “Divine-grade Sun Moon Azure Pill! My god, that’s a medicinal pill that can help martial artists break through to True God Realm!”

Zuo Shujie nodded his head and said, “As long as peak Celestial Deity Realm martial artists consume a divine-grade Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill, there’s 70% chance of breaking through! But, Ye Yuan’s alchemy skills ...”

They all knew that Ye Yuan’s alchemy skills were a heaven-defying existence.

Although not seeing him for several hundred years, they felt that Ye Yuan’s alchemy skills should not decline.

For some time, the gazes of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s people became extremely odd.

Swoosh!

A streak of green light flew toward Ye Yuan. That was a small bottle containing the medicinal pill.

The corners of Tong’er’s mouth revealed a mocking expression but did not stop it.

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan pointed a finger out, that green little bottle shattered in the air with a bang.

The medicinal pill inside was also blasted to residue by Ye Yuan, dissipating away into heaven and earth.

Seeing this scene, everyone could not help feeling their flesh hurt.

You don’t care for it, but we care!

Even if you don’t want it, there was also no need to directly destroy it, right?

Lin Changqing did not reveal a look of surprise. He just said with a cold smile, “Is that pitiful dignity? With this medicinal pill, perhaps after several tens of thousands of years, you still have hopes of standing in front of this Empyrean. But you destroyed it! But like this is good as well, every tub must stand on its bottom, forget Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli from today onwards!”

Lin Changqing’s both hands were behind his back, showing unrivaled haughtiness.

He had the capital to be condescending!

Such a young Heavenly Empyrean powerhouse, who dared to say that he could not step into that fleeting and ephemeral realm of Heavenly Emperor?

Such a character was the Heavenspan World’s true heaven’s chosen.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Changqing and slowly extended two fingers.

Lin Changqing was slightly taken aback. Even when Tong’er saw Ye Yuan’s action, he also revealed a puzzled look.

“2000 years!”

Lin Changqing was very smart, after being dazed, he understood Ye Yuan’s meaning very quickly.

Ye Yuan paused for a bit and continued, “Within 2000 years, I’ll stand before you! Let you see if Li-er and I are people of the same world or not!”

One sentence made everyone quiet down.

Tong’er’s pupils also constricted, he felt that Ye Yuan’s boast was a little big!

He was an Empyrean powerhouse himself and naturally knew how difficult it was to cultivate to be an Empyrean powerhouse.

He did not doubt that Ye Yuan could cultivate to Empyrean Realm, but in 2000 years, this was boasting too much.

“Hahaha! Truly shameless boasting! Since you have such confidence, then let’s have a 2000-year agreement, how about it? After 2000 years, you and I will have a battle! The loser will leave Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli!” Lin Changqing let out a wild laugh and said.

Ye Yuan’s words simply sounded like that boring self-esteem of the weak to him.

Cultivating from Celestial Deity Realm to Empyrean Realm within 2000 years, this kind of thing absolutely could not possibly happen!

Even if he was overwhelmingly talented and had countless medicinal pills and spiritual items to load up, he also spent 5000 years before cultivating to the realm of Empyrean.

And his starting point was much higher than the vast majority of the Heavenspan World’s martial artists!

He, Lin Changqing, was at the True God Realm during birth!

Comparing talent, who could compete with him?

One had to know, there were god knows how many martial artists in this Heavenspan World. But 90% of the martial artists were unable to step into the realm of True God for all their lives!

But he had such a cultivation realm since birth.

From Celestial Deity Realm to Empyrean Realm looked like it was just two major realms. But the distance between these two major realms was as far as heaven and earth.

How many people who bragged and boasted about being geniuses were unable to cross these two major thresholds too, let alone talk about reaching it within a short 2000 years.

These words were not pride, but ignorance!

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Changqing and shook his head as he said, “I, Ye Yuan, won’t use my own woman as a wager!”

Lin Changqing had a look of disdain and was just about to scoff in contempt, but heard Ye Yuan continue saying, “2000 years later, you and I will have a battle! The victor lives, the loser ... dies! Do you dare or not?”

Ye Yuan stared intently at Lin Changqing, his gaze incomparably sharp.

Everyone sucked in a mouthful of cold air, they did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so decisive.

Agreeing on a life-and-death match, this was originally nothing.

But the disparity between Ye Yuan and Lin Changqing was too great. 2000 years was merely a snap of a finger. Agreeing to this wager was too disadvantageous to Ye Yuan!

This was simply a wager without the slightest chance of winning!~

Tong’er frowned and said, “Kid, don’t be impulsive!”

Ye Yuan ignored him and just stared intently at Lin Changqing, opening his mouth once more to say, “Do you dare or not?”
