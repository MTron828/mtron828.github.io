Chapter 2501: Playing with Fire, You’re No Good!

Lin Chaotian’s right hand had a cluster of pale white flames, emitting a buzzing sound.

Just looking at it gave people a scorching hot feeling.

In his left hand, a bluster of black flames jumped irregularly, giving people a soul-stirring feeling.

Two clusters of flames made everyone present, including Tian Qing and Yue Mengli, have a feeling of incredible danger.

“Those are Cangli Heavenly Fire and Nihility Karmic Fire! In the legends, they are the strongest fire seedlings of fire-attribute rule! Among these two flames, one is incomparably blazing hot and can incinerate all things. The other is dark and deep and can crush all thoughts! Two flames, one ethereal and one corporeal, they can burn everything! These two flames are both legendary flames! I didn’t expect that he’s able to condense them as soon as he became a Dao Ancestor!” Tian Qing said gloomily.

His eyes also exuded dread.

Becoming a Dao Ancestor, there were really not many existences capable of making him apprehensive anymore.

These two clusters of flames were one of the few existences.

In his heart, he already acknowledged Lin Chaotian as his opponent.

Yue Mengli’s brows furrowed slightly and she said worriedly, “Then Ye Yuan he …”

Tian Qing nodded and said, “The Nihility Karmic Fire isn’t like these corporeal flames. It’s incredibly harmful to the divine soul. Even if it’s this ancestor, if I get hit by the Nihility Karmic Fire, the chances of survival are very slim too! Ye Yuan’s divine soul is very strange, but wanting to resist the Nihility Karmic Fire, I’m afraid that it isn’t realistic. No wonder this guy dared to proclaim to reign supreme over the human race, these words weren’t bragging!”

Yue Mengli’s expression changed slightly and she instinctively wanted to make a move but was grabbed hold of by Tian Qing.

It was only to hear him say indifferently, “If he wants to kill Ye Yuan, I’m afraid that it isn’t enough yet. But if Ye Yuan is seriously injured on the verge of death, this ancestor will make a move.”

“Heh heh,?dodge, dodge, dodge! Dodging when at Deva Realm, now that you achieved Grand Ancestor Realm you’re still dodging! Ye Yuan, just the likes of your cowardly appearance, you also dare to call yourself Saint Azure in vain? You are merely a coward!” Lin Chaotian had a contorted expression as he said with a sneer.

Ye Yuan still did not turn back and suddenly pointed with his fingertip.

A streak of sword energy penetrated into Wang Cheng’s body, snuffing out his life force.

Wang Cheng’s pupils were currently turning lax.

He never dreamed that he would die just after becoming a Dao Ancestor!

Perhaps he was the saddest Dao Ancestor in history, right?

One silk thread after another gushed out of Wang Cheng’s body.

Finally, they condensed into a light blue stone.

Rule crystal!

Ye Yuan casually picked up the rule crystal and threw it to the Pang Zhen who was not far away, and said coolly, “This position of Ancestor Lightning is more suitable for you.”

Pang Zhen looked at the rule crystal in his hand, his brain somewhat short-circuiting.

This … Did a pie drop from the sky?

No, wait, this was the pie that His Excellency gave to him!

Heavenly Dao Samsara already closed, but he actually obtained a chance to become Dao Ancestor!

At this moment, countless envious gazes were cast towards him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

With Heavenly Dao Samsara closing, whoever refined a rule crystal would be a Dao Ancestor!

It was just that, wanting to kill a Dao Ancestor was easier said than done!

However, Ye Yuan killed one casually just like that!

“Ye Yuan, this … this … better give it to Wan Zhen!” Pang Zhen was rather excited but still did not lose his senses as he looked at Ye Yuan and said.

Wan Zhen’s expression turned dark, and he said, “His Excellency said to give it to you, so just take it! What nonsense is this!”

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “His path isn’t suitable to become Dao Ancestor! Later on, I’ll help him customize his path of cultivation. In the future, when his Five Element Laws reach the realm of rule at the same time, what would Dao Ancestors count for?”

The moment these words came out, everyone revealed shocked expressions.

Wan Zhen himself was even agitated until his heart was almost jumping out.

With regards to the future of the people around him, Ye Yuan had naturally considered it.

Pang Zhen specialized in the path of lightning, his best outlet was naturally becoming a Dao Ancestor.

Furthermore, it was Dao Ancestor Lightning!

Actually, before leaving the Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan already had the idea of killing people.

It was just that at that time, he still did not know who was Dao Ancestor Lightning.

Now, it was just nice that there was Wang Cheng who came out to jump around. He naturally would not be courteous.

What Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets learned was too heterogeneous and the Dao of Divination was too illusory and vague, Ye Yuan had no clue as to how to proceed too.

Therefore, a Dao Ancestor Watersource was naturally most suitable for him.

As for Wan Zhen, he naturally had to follow the path of Five Elements to corroborate his Dao!

He could expedite the birth of 18 grand ancestors with array formations. So what was hard about making Wan Zhen become Grand Ancestor Five Elements?

Moreover, his present Formation Dao already reached the realm of rule!

The array formations that he laid down now were god knows how many times stronger than back then!

It was just that he had always been overwhelmed by the matter of the Doomsday Battle previously until he could not breathe. He naturally did not have time to set up array formations too.

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said, “You look at that fellow. He only mastered two power of rules and haven’t fused them yet and is already so strong! In the future, your achievements will likely be above Tian Qing’s!”

Who he was referring to was naturally Lin Chaotian.

At this time, Lin Chaotian currently had such bluster that it billowed to the sky. Two clusters of shocking flames made everyone give sidelong glances.

But Ye Yuan ignored him.

This kind of contempt, probably even a fool could see it.

It was just that everyone did not understand where his confidence came from!

One had to know, this one ethereal flame and one corporeal flame, they made even Tian Qing incredibly fearful!

Lin Chaotian cussed Ye Yuan for being a coward, but Ye Yuan completely ignored him.

This kind of slighting finally made Lin Chaotian unbelievably angry!

“Damn thing! It’s you who are seeking death yourself! You can’t blame this ancestor! Go to hell for me!”

Lin Chaotian gave a roar, Cangli Heavenly Fire and Nihility Karmic Fire being released at the same time!

Places that the two clusters of flames passed through, two long trails were actually drawn out.

The void was being burned!

It was currently right beside the Heavenspan Mountain, space was extremely stable. Being able to burn the space, it could be seen how terrifying these two clusters of flames were!

Two clusters of flames carried Lin Chaotian’s fury and headed straight for Ye Yuan.

But it was like Ye Yuan did not see it, still talking away to Pang Zhen without any care.

“Hahaha?… Cangli Heavenly Fire and Nihility Karmic Fire are like bone-infesting maggots! Wherever you go, they will follow there! This ancestor wants to see where you run!” Lin Chaotian laughed wildly as he said.

When Pang Zhen saw that Ye Yuan was completely clueless, his expression changed slightly as he warned, “Be careful, Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan seemed to be oblivious and still said to Wan Zhen, “Five rules fusing,?heh heh,?even thinking about it makes people somewhat look forward to it! If you succeed, our human race will be able to suppress the myriad races forever!”

Ye Yuan had a look of excitement, but the others all had their hearts leap to their throats!

Wan Zhen’s expression changed drastically and he bellowed, “Your Excellency! Fire!”

As he said, the two clusters of flames already arrived before Ye Yuan.

Lin Chaotian saw that Ye Yuan actually did not avoid it and could not help saying with wild elation, “Fool! You’re also too careless!”

Boom!

Boom!

The two flames virtually landed on Ye Yuan’s body at the same time.

The Nihility Karmic Fire burrowed into Ye Yuan’s body with a whoosh.

While the Cangli Heavenly Fire burned on Ye Yuan’s body.

“Hahaha?… die! Foolish fellow, you’ve avoided for so many years! But in the end, you actually didn’t dodge! You really deserve this!” Lin Chaotian said with a wild laugh when he saw the situation.

However, amidst the flames, a voice came out faintly, “Playing with fire, you’re no good!”
