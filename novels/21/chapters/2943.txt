Chapter 2942: Cutting of All Means of Retreat!

Dong!

Ahead, a Pseudo Imperishable Physique directly exploded.

Then he stopped reviving as well.

He turned to ashes!

Many people started panicking.

Wang Qian looked at the panic on people’s faces, his face full of a ridiculing expression.

A bunch of ant-like things also had wishful thinking about finding the origin!

Even if it was given to you, can you fuse with it?

Suddenly, his gaze turned intent, discovering that several people were still searching around.

“Mn??If I didn’t remember wrongly, that’s Great Emperor Whiteshadow’s grandson, Bai Cuishan, right? This kid had a great lucky chance too to obtain Progenitor Imperishable’s guidance. Furthermore, his strength isn’t weak!” Wang Qian muttered to himself.

Dong!

Another drumbeat!

This time, many Pseudo Imperishable Physiques directly turned to ashes!

Wang Qian felt that his soul body also became a bit uncomfortable.

He knew that the effect of this drumming sound was each blow being stronger than the last.

If he stayed for a long time, it would cause tremendous damage to his soul body!

They all, these Imperishable Soul Physiques, were not truly imperishable.

“Mn?”

At this time, he saw someone from the peripherals of his eyes.

Ye Yuan!

Following this drumbeat, Ye Yuan’s soul body directly collapsed!

But very soon, Ye Yuan recovered his soul body again.

It was just that this time, it was clearly much dimmer than the last time!

A hint of a smile showed at the corners of Wang Qian’s mouth. His figure moved, arriving before Ye Yuan, and he said with a look of amusement, “It’s just the seventh drumbeat, and you already can’t hold on? Nine drums, seven bells, each claiming lives! Kid, you have to take care!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, and he said coolly, “Relax, even if you die, I won’t die too!”

Wang Qian snickered and said, “Still being stubborn on your deathbed! Relax, I’ll keep on paying attention to you!”

Finished saying, Wang Qian laughed loudly and left.

Bai Cuishan also discovered that Ye Yuan was scattering even more. He came over to urge, saying, “Ye Yuan, stop forcing it. You’ll die! Give up!”

“I give up!”

“I give up!”

“I can’t take it anymore! I give up!”

… …

Right at this time, many people around started to howl loudly.

Before entering, the team leaders told them and as long as they shouted “I give up,” these three words, to the sky, they would be automatically transported out.

However, they did not!

For a time, alarm and fear spread!

“Why! Why am I still here! I gave up already!”

“Hurry up and transport me out! I … I’m going to die!”

“I don’t want to die! I give up! I give up! I give up!”

… …

Many people’s yells carried sobs.

But they discovered to their dismay that no matter how they yelled, there were no movements.

Dong!

With another drumbeat, many Pseudo Imperishable Physiques directly died.

This time, they finally discovered that they could not go out anymore!

“Liars! You bunch of liars! I won’t let you all off even if I become a ghost!?Sniff, sniff?…” Many people started cursing.

Even Wang Qian’s expression changed drastically too.

What ruthless means! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This was forcing them all, these people, toward death!

Very clearly, those people outside had long already made a decision.

If they were unable to fuse with the origin, then there was no need to go out anymore!

This was not some inheritance. This was a salvation that had to succeed!

If they were unable to fuse with the origin, they would not be able to find Hegemon Imperishable. Then what was the use of them, these Pseudo Imperishable Physique powerhouses?

Of course, this also meant cutting off all means of retreat.

Cutting off their paths of survival, squeezing out all of their potential to search for the origin and fusing with the origin!

Wang Qian’s gaze turned intent, and he roared angrily, “All shut up for me!”

He was extremely strong. With this roar, it made everyone quieten down at once.

Everyone carried extremely terrified expressions, looking toward Wang Qian.

Wang Qian’s gaze swept over everyone, and he said in a cold voice, “You all don’t need to harbor fantasies anymore! Only one person among us can go out! Only by finding the origin and fusing with it can one walk out of here! Crying and yelling here is useless! Go and find the origin! Only by finding the origin can you survive!”

A word woke up the dreamer!

Everyone suddenly came to a realization!

Yeah, as long as they found the origin, they would be able to live!

Hence, everyone became incomparably frenzied.

Bai Cuishan also came to a realization and hurriedly said to Ye Yuan, “Go! Hurry up and find the origin; otherwise, we’ll all have to die!”

“This place is the land of inheritance. Why is there such a Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell?” Ye Yuan did not leave. He muttered under his breath.

Bai Cuishan got anxious and said, “My God, you’re still in the mood to say this? A breath late and you’ll be dead!”

But Ye Yuan ignored him and murmured to himself, “What’s the benefit in killing people? This first level is stark empty. There’s nothing at all. Is it just for the sake of killing people? That’s not right! This Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell is fishy!”

“Goodness, what can be fishy?! Hurry up and go find the origin!” Bai Cuishan really panicked.

However, this guy was loyal to his friends. Seeing that Ye Yuan was in a daze, he did not leave.

At this time, a hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, and he actually sat down on the spot.

Bai Cuishan was stupefied and said anxiously, “Goodness me, what are you doing here! If we can’t find the origin, we’ll all have to die!”

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a smile, “Brother Bai, you go and search for it. I’m not searching anymore!”

Bai Cuishan could not do anything about it and stomped his feet hard as he said, “My word! You weirdo! I’m going!”

Dong!

The ninth drumbeat sounded out, and Ye Yuan’s soul body directly collapsed!

When he recovered again, his soul body became even dimmer.

Wang Qian saw Ye Yuan because he was too eyecatching.

Hence, he came over and said in a cold voice, “Other people are all searching for the origin. What are you doing?”

Ye Yuan ignored him but savored the drumbeat earlier in detail, as well as the feeling of the soul body collapsing.

Wang Qian’s gaze turned cold, and he said in a cold voice, “Go and search for the origin for me now! Otherwise, I’ll kill you now!”

Ye Yuan still ignored him!

Boom!

Wang Qian did not hesitate in the slightest, directly striking with a terrifying palm.

His strength was significantly stronger than Feng Rui.

Ye Yuan’s soul body was directly disintegrated by him.

But very soon, Ye Yuan recovered again.

Imperishable Soul Physique, even if it was a Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique, it was not that easy to be killed either.

Furthermore, being killed by him did not pose the slightest threat to Ye Yuan.

What was truly threatening was the Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell!

Ye Yuan felt it. What this Twilight Drum Daybreak Bell destroyed was not just his soul body; it was even his consciousness!

This was also to say that, in the end, even he would not be able to revive anymore!

Wang Qian’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a chilly voice, “Damn thing, really think that I can’t kill you?”

Hence, he released his aura fully. A terrifying soul force crept out in the air.

Dong!

Right at this time, the first bell ring sounded.

Wang Qian gave a muffled groan. That horrifying soul force directly crumbled under this bell ring!

Of course, Ye Yuan’s soul body also collapsed again.

The power of this bell ring was several times that of the drumbeat!

This many, even more people died!

“Rather than wasting time with me here, it is better to hurry up and find the origin. Otherwise, you’ll die too,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Wang Qian’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

However, he knew that what Ye Yuan said was right.

If they can’t find the origin, he would have to die too!

Wang Qian gritted his teeth and flew away!
