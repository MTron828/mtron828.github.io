Chapter 1647 Medicinal Pill Shop

Ning Tianping took the last three billion savings of Ye Yuan’s and went to buy rank three spirit medicines.

This three billion was Ye Yuan’s final capital.

Even the several billion divine essence stones inside the Purple Extreme Hall was squandered clean by Ye Yuan.

Now, Ye Yuan was basically equivalent to penniless.

Seeing his stall, Ye Yuan could not help smiling bitterly too.

No wonder they did not even want a commission. The location of this stall, virtually no one would show interest.

Setting up a stall was a skill too. Those martial artists who frequently visited the market also understood that people who could not afford the stall fee naturally did not have any good stuff on hand.

Therefore, these last-rank stall’s stall owners, normally, no one would care about them.

Of course, right now, the martial artists in the city were numerous. The entire Heavenly Network Gathering was very hot, letting last-rank stalls have some popularity by association too.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s stall was truly too remote. It could be said to be the last-rank stall among last-rank stalls.

When those martial artists strolled until the front, most of them ran out of interest, let alone talk about coming here.

But Ye Yuan did not mind either. As long as someone came over, his reputation would naturally reach out.

A stall owner next to him saw Ye Yuan come over to set up a stall. He came to greet out of boredom.

“Hey, why did you rent this stall? Isn’t this being a sucker?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Doesn’t matter, as long as it’s a stall, it will do.”

That stall owner was also bored out of his mind, finally finding a person to chit-chat with. seeing Ye Yuan say so, he could not help smiling as he said, “Heh, I’m also the same as you, don’t know anything at all, that’s why I rented this stall. In the end, I haven’t sold a single item until now too. Hey, what are you selling?”

Ye Yuan also did not have the intention of keeping people a good distance away and said coolly, “Medicinal pills.”

The moment that stall owner heard, he said with a contemptuous look, “Couldn’t tell that you’re still an alchemist! The stalls outside selling medicinal pills, if there isn’t a thousand, there’s also 800. Who’ll come to this corner to buy your medicinal pills?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “My medicinal pills, there is no need to worry about selling them.”

When the stall owner heard, he burst into laughter and said, “Kid, you won’t shed tears until you see the coffin! You’re just a Three-star Alchemy God, right? The Four-star Alchemy Gods outside are not in the minority. They are selling rank three divine pills too. No matter how good your medicinal pills are, can it still compete with the Four-star Alchemy Gods?”

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “Can!”

The stall owner was rendered speechless. He discovered that this kid was simply impervious to reason. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

At this time, Ye Yuan knocked out his banner unhurriedly, on it wrote ‘Medicinal Pill Shop”

What an uncouth name!

That stall owner could not help poking fun in his heart.

However, Ye Yuan did not display his medicinal pills. He just hung a few signs on the booth.

It was the prices of level one to level nine difficulty medicinal pills. Level one difficulty was 100 million, level nine difficulty was three billion.

Seeing this price list, the stall owner beside him directly broke down.

Was this kid here to be funny?

One rank three divine pill being sold for three billion?

You’re here to rob money, right?!

Ordinary medicinal pill shops would display some of their proud works to attract customers, but Ye Yuan did not.

Void spirit divine-grade divine pills were different from ordinary medicinal pills. Because it was incomparably pure, so it was also easier to volatilize the medicinal properties, affecting the medicinal effects from there.

Hence, after forming the pill, Ye Yuan always used special techniques to seal it, then stored it inside storage rings.

This kind of pocket storage ring was worthless, but the medicinal pills were incomparably precious.

Taking it out to display, one must break the seal, affecting the medicinal properties from there.

Hence, Ye Yuan’s small stall did not have any goods to show everyone at all.

What he wanted to sell were all void spirit divine-grade medicinal pills!

...

“Little Junior Sister, these are all last-rank stalls. There is no good stuff. We’ve bought everything that should be bought, solet’s go back.”

In front of last-rank stalls, a man and a woman, both youngsters, were currently strolling.

The girl was in high spirits, but the guy was somewhat impatient already.

These two people were the Sword Star Alliance’s disciples. The guy was called Zhao Jian, while the girl was called Su Ting.

Su Ting smiled and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, if you feel bored, go back first. I’ll scour around here, maybe I can find good stuff?”

The moment Zhao Jian heard, he shriveled up and said, “Little Junior Sister, last-rank stalls are all rented by some incompetent Origin Deity Realm martial artists. What good stuff can there be?”

Su Ting said, “That might not be the case. The last time, didn’t Third Senior Brother find a pretty good martial technique here? He cultivated that martial technique and his strength increased greatly recently. You’re also aware.”

Zhao Jian was speechless as he said, “He was a blind cat bumping into a dead rat.”

Su Ting smiled and said, “Perhaps we can also bump into dead mice? There are so many martial artists in the city right now. Who knows whether this place is hiding some good things or not?”

It seemed like shopping was a woman’s nature. This Su Ting did not find it tiring and just shopped all the way.

Zhao Jian was helpless and could only accompany Su Ting too.

He was interested in this little junior sister and naturally could not say anything.

Shopping for more than two hours, logically speaking, it was impossible for Zhao Jian, this half-step Divine Lord powerhouse, to feel tired.

But his feet actually seemed to have grown roots, unable to lift them anymore.

“Little Junior Sister, you see ... I already told you, there is no good stuff here.” Zhao Jian saw that they were almost reaching the end and said again.

Su Ting was indeed a little disappointed. She even thought that martial artists gathering in the city this time, there would be some good stuff. Did not expect that these last-rank stalls did not have anything.

But seeing as they were almost reaching the end, she was also unresigned to leave just like this. Hence, she said, “Eldest Senior Brother, I know that you’re the best. Just a few stalls left, so accompany me to see things till the end, alright?”

This move was rather ruthless. Zhao Jian’s bones almost turned limp. He could only nod. He said, “Alright, alright. Either way, there’s also not many left.”

After looking at several more, there was still nothing. Even Su Ting herself was almost giving up.

Suddenly, Su Ting looked at a small booth in the corner-most area rather curiously.

This stall was too remote and also too small. If one did not pay attention, they could not even see it.

What attracted her attention was that that stall actually did not have a single item.

“Medicinal Pill Shop, what an uncouth name! Boss, you’re selling medicinal pills, why isn’t there even a medicinal bottle?” Su Ting asked Ye Yuan with a curious look.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It isn’t convenient to take out my medicinal pills. What medicinal pills you require, you can directly tell me.”

Su Ting opened her eyes wide and said with a curious look, “There are actually still medicinal pills that can’t be taken out? Your meaning is that you have every medicinal pill?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Commonly used ones basically all have. Some uncommon medicinal pills, there are also quite a few. If there isn’t, I can help you to refine right now. Three hours will do.”

Zhao Jian listened by the side, feeling that Ye Yuan boasted a little too much.

His gaze suddenly turned sharp, seeing the sign Ye Yuan hung up, and cried out in shock, “One rank three divine pill, you’re selling for three billion divine essence stones? Are you robbing people of their money?”

When Ye Yuan heard it, he just said coolly, “Selling at this price is naturally because the medicinal pill is worth this price.”

Zhao Jian shouted at the top of his voice, “What medicinal pill is worth three billion, you tell me!”
