Chapter 2918: Scarlet Drill Three Sons!

“This place is the Lucid Forest. It’s the place where the Nirvana Soul Hall’s disciples cultivate and also one of the three stages of the entrance assessment. I’ve already helped you to make arrangements for the rest. As long as you clear the Lucid Forest, Soul Controlling Avenue, and Soul Refining Furnace, three stages, you’ll be able to enter the Nirvana Soul Hall,” Yan Jadetrue pointed at a forest ahead as he explained.

Nirvana Soul Hall was the inevitable path that led to the soul race.

However, not all soul denizens had the qualifications to enter the Nirvana Soul Hall.

This Nirvana Soul Hall was akin to a great sect. Wanting to enter it, one must pass a stringent test.

This test was no joke. A moment of carelessness and one would die inside!

Of course, the benefits of entering the Nirvana Soul Hall were immense too.

The soul race’s control over resources was extremely strict.

Entering the Nirvana Soul Hall, one would have the possibility of advancing to a higher level.

Wanting to enter the core of the soul race, there was only through the Nirvana Soul Hall.

Therefore, soul race powerhouses flocked to the Nirvana Soul Hall like ducks.

Countless Soul Daos were set up in the Lucid Forest!

Soul Dao was the lifetime comprehension of a soul denizen.

Corroborating one’s own Dao with tens of thousands of Soul Dao, comprehending a Great Dao that belonged to yourself, that was the function of the Lucid Forest.

However, being situated amidst tens of thousands of Soul Daos, it was also extremely easy to lose yourself.

To the vast majority of the soul denizens, entering the Lucid Forest would often lead them astray, turning into one of the myriad Soul Daos inside.

Of course, with danger, there were lucky chances too.

Some people comprehended their own Great Dao in the Lucid Forest, their strength advancing by leaps and bounds.

Hence, many Nirvana Soul Hall disciples similarly comprehended Dao inside.

“The time limit to pass the stage is three days! As long as you walk out of the Lucid Forest within three days, it’s considered clearing it,” Yan Jadetrue said.

The rest, he did not say much either.

He knew Ye Yuan too well and knew that this Lucid Forest could not stump him.

It was just that. He was somewhat curious just what level Ye Yuan could achieve.

Actually, Yan Jadetrue originally wanted to show off his results. But, thinking about it, better forget it, in case he got slapped by Ye Yuan.

Back then, when he entered the Lucid Forest, he only used 20 hours and walked out.

This result was sufficient to rank in the top ten when looking at the entire Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall. It was really very impressive!

Therefore, he was taken in as a disciple by Soul Emperor Sevenfeather too.

What this stage tested was not talent but Dao heart.

Only with a strong Dao heart could one remain lucid!

But Yan Jadetrue knew that Ye Yuan’s Dao heart was frighteningly powerful!

At this time, there were already many people who took the stage, waiting to enter the Lucid Forest.

Ye Yuan also entered the crowd along with the flow.

“Get lost!”

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd, and a path automatically opened up.

A young man stepped forward with his hands behind his back, looking like he considered everything and everyone beneath his notice.

The others seemed to be very fearful of him.

Ye Yuan heard people starting to discuss beside him.

“Who are these three people? Why are they so arrogant!”

“You never heard of the Crimson Drill Three Sons? I didn’t expect that they would also come to take part in the test with us this time!”

“Qin Shitian, Zhou Yu, He Chen, these three all returned from the Scarlet Drill Battlefield! I heard that the three of them rendered illustrious achievements in the Scarlet Drill Battlefield and were taken in as honorary disciples by the three hall masters! It’s just waiting for after the assessment this time before they are accepted under their tutelage!”

“The three of them have corrupt energy that billows to the sky. I don’t even dare get close! Too strong! The top three this time will definitely be the three of them!”

“No wonder they are so haughty. They really have the capital to be arrogant!”

… …

Everyone sent the three people off with their eyes, walking through the crowd.

Places that they passed by, all gave a wide berth!

It was not that they wanted to retreat, but that they had no choice but to retreat!

Compared to the others, these three people were simply head and shoulders above them. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

These three genuinely killed their way out from a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. The corrupt energy on their bodies billowed to the sky, their soul bodies incomparably solid.

Those who were slightly weaker, just this corrupt energy could turn them to ashes.

Soul race powerhouses were not as weak as the human race’s origin divinity.

Especially those like Qin Shitian three people, their soul bodies were already condensed to the extreme. Wanting to kill them was even harder than the blood race!

The three people took big steps, as if there were nobody around.

“Humph!?A bunch of trash also wants to enter the Nirvana Soul Hall, truly ignorant!’ Qin Shitian looked at everyone who retreated, a look of displeasure on his face.

Zhou Yu smiled and said, “Dreams are a must! However, taking the assessment in the same batch as us, they will doubt life, right?”

He Chen’s mouth curled, and he said disdainfully, “Sweeping a glance, there’s no one who can fight! These trash actually came to take part in the test too.”

Zhou Yu said, “Huhu, our goal isn’t just to enter the Nirvana Soul Hall! We’re not from the same world as them to begin with!”

Qin Shitian snorted coldly and said, “Taking the test together with these trash really spoils my appetite!”

The three people did not have the intention of covering it up at all. Everyone could hear the words that were said.

When everyone heard, their faces turned completely red.

Those who dared to come and challenge the Nirvana Soul Hall’s test were not rookies.

At least, they had some confidence in themselves.

But, just as Zhou Yu said, they were somewhat doubting life.

The Scarlet Drill Three Sons were too strong!

As the three people walked, they arrived at Ye Yuan there very soon.

The others backed away one after another. A middle True Sovereign Heaven next to Ye Yuan tugged at him and whispered, “Still not backing away? You’re courting death!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Lucid Forest tests the Dao heart. If you retreat, is there still a need to enter the Lucid Forest?”

That person was taken aback. Thinking about it, that was true.

But, right at this time, a surging corrupt energy hit him head-on.

His expression changed wildly, only feeling like his soul body was almost collapsing. He hurriedly retreated more than ten steps before stabilizing his figure.

This way, Ye Yuan appeared especially conspicuous.

The others immediately started discussing in whispers.

“Keeping up appearances to cover up his predicament? Retreat and you won’t be able to clear the Lucid Forest? What a joke!”

“How is this keeping up appearances to cover up his predicament, this is throwing away his life! The Scarlet Drill Three Sons together can directly make his soul body collapse!”

“Heh,?there are really those who aren’t afraid of death these days!”

… …

Qin Shitian three people naturally saw Ye Yuan too.

Qin Shitian’s brows furrowed slightly, very displeased in his heart.

A place that they were passing through, there was actually someone who dared to not give way!

Furthermore, what Ye Yuan said earlier was not deliberately hidden. Everyone heard it, including the three of them.

“Humph!?Ignorant thing! Without strength and you still dare to utter wild ravings, really courting death!”

Qin Shitian gave a cold snort, the corrupt energy on his body suddenly skyrocketing severalfold!

Zhou Yu also laughed lightly. Following that, his corrupt energy also skyrocketed!

He Chen sneered coldly, similarly skyrocketing!

The three people’s corrupt energy billowed straight to the clouds, enveloping everyone inside all at once.

They did not deliberately target the others, but the expressions of the rest changed wildly, retreating again one after another.

An extremely large empty lot formed around the trio.

Apart from the three of them, there was only Ye Yuan left in that empty lot.

Ye Yuan was in the center of the three people’s corrupt energy!

Previously, they did not intentionally release corrupt energy. But now, they had the intention of taking Ye Yuan down a notch, forcing Ye Yuan to fall back.

“Retreat!” When Qin Shitian walked by Ye Yuan, he bellowed.

However, what Ye Yuan returned to him was just a slight smile.

Unmoving as a pine tree!
