Chapter 1894: A Sneeze

A region of space was currently quietly forming.

The young man’s heart twinged fiercely. A feeling of incredible danger instantly welled up in his heart.

“Courting death!”

Incomparably heavy world power suddenly erupted in an instant, crushing over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly vanished, escaping into the boundless void.

The young man’s pupils constricted and he cried out in alarm, “Spatial law!”

At this moment, he no longer held back, the power of Empyrean Realm erupting completely.

The berserk aura made the faces of the people below turn white as a sheet.

This aura was much stronger than when the young man just appeared.

The people understood that this young man meant business!

No one would have expected that the situation would actually develop to such an extent.

The Celestial Deity Realm Ye Yuan actually forced an Empyrean to go all out?

Even thinking about it felt preposterous.

One had to know, even if Empyrean powerhouses stood there and did not move, Celestial Deity Realm martial artists could not possibly cause them any damage too.

This was the disparity in realms, and even more the gap in laws and Heavenly Dao comprehension. It was unable to be compensated for at all.

But now, Ye Yuan did it!

What in the world were those mysterious blue fine-lines?

Forget about Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses not understanding it, even ordinary Empyrean powerhouses did not know the existence of Dao mark.

That was exclusive to Heavenly Emperor powerhouses!

This young man’s identity was clearly extraordinary. He only took one look and was extremely sure that those were Dao marks!

Why would a Celestial Deity Realm martial artist have Dao marks?

The young man did not know, he also did not have time to think too much.

Dao mark was too dangerous!

“Asura Finger!”

The young man pointed a finger, an apocalyptic horrifying aura suddenly erupted, making the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City tremble.

With this finger landing, the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would be leveled to the ground!

“Puhwark!”

The might of this finger had yet to completely erupt and Ye Yuan already could not withstand this pressure, being forced out of the void by the other party.

Those countless blue fine-lines fell apart to pieces under this finger and were completely unable to construct the Divine Vestige Space.

Ye Yuan spurted fresh blood wildly, his body flying out like a kite with a broken string.

The current Ye Yuan was akin to being hauled out of blood from head to toe, looking grim and horrifying.

The might of an Empyrean was too strong!

The young man looked at Ye Yuan, his gaze cold as ice as he said in a solemn voice, “Originally, I just wanted to give you a warning. Since you’re bent on courting death, then this Empyrean will send you off! Remember, the person who killed you is Lin Changqing!”

The current Lin Changqing was already utterly infuriated by Ye Yuan.

In his eyes, Ye Yuan was merely an insignificant ant and could not have the will to resist at all, let alone have the capital to resist.

But just now, he actually felt threatened.

The Empyrean powerhouse Lin Changqing actually felt the threat of an ant.

His emotion turned angry from embarrassment.

A finger landing, the horrifying power of law made a series of cracks tear apart in space.

In the center of the storm, the bodies of many martial artists in the city suddenly exploded, turning into clouds of blood mist.

This power already did not seem like it belonged in the mortal world.

Lin Changqing was not just an Empyrean powerhouse, his law comprehension was similarly extremely horrifying.

“DIE!”

A hint of delight flashed across in Lin Changqing’s eyes, the finger suddenly landing.

Right at this time, a pink light suddenly shot up to the sky and met with this finger.

Under this horrifying finger, that pink lump of flesh appeared very frail.

Lin Changqing’s brows furrowed slightly and he said in a cold voice, “Humph! Ignorant beast, a mantis also dares to block the cart!”

“Grunt! Grunt!”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The pink lump of meat emitted an unpleasant sound, who could it be if not Treasure Pig?

Between heaven and earth, that small flesh-ball appeared extremely, extremely small, just like a speck of dust.

Treasure Pig’s nose suddenly twitched without stopping, mouth opening wide.

“Ahh ... CHOO!”

Treasure Pig flew up to the sky and did a big sneeze at Lin Changqing.

In such a solemn moment, this scene appeared extremely comical.

But nobody could laugh.

A horrifying air billow rose to the sky, meeting Lin Changqing’s Asura Finger.

Rumble!

Amidst everyone’s astounded gazes, that blast wind was akin to wind puffing away the clouds, and actually directly pushed the horrifying energy emitted by the Asura Finger back.

Lin Changqing’s face suddenly changed. This sudden turn of events caught him by surprise.

The sneeze that Treasure Pig did arrive in front of him like easily sweeping up dead leaves.

Bang!

Lin Changqing’s chest seemed to have been struck by a sledgehammer.

Only to see fresh blood spurt wildly out of his mouth, figure flying backward, already sustaining heavy injuries.

Everything flew away.

Treasure Pig did a sneeze and tunneled back into Tong’er’s embrace lazily, falling asleep, as if nothing had happened.

Death-like silence.

Heavenly Eagle’s people all exchanged glances, not daring to believe the scene that happened before their eyes at all.

The finger of an Empyrean powerhouse was actually sent packing by a sneeze just like that?

Furthermore, it even injured an Empyrean powerhouse!

Tong’er and Treasure Pig followed along with Ye Yuan, but these two fellows’ sense of presence were too weak. So no one paid attention to them at all.

Who could have thought that this pink pig Ye Yuan brought over actually had such daunting strength?

Ning Tianping, White Light, Leng Qiuling, all looked at Treasure Pig with incredible shock, as if it was their first time knowing it.

They all knew that Treasure Pig was a glutton and only ate the medicinal pills that Ye Yuan refined.

They also knew that Treasure Pig was a sleepyhead, sleeping several years away was also nothing difficult.

But they did not know that Treasure Pig actually had such horrifying strength.

Sensing all sorts of peculiar gazes, Tong’er rolled his eyes and said, “Stare what stare? Never seen before such a beautiful pet?”

Everyone broke down.

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! A bunch of ants! I’m going to level your Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to the ground!”

Lin Changqing who was bounced away several tens of thousands of miles away flew back again with a flash, covered in blood all over.

Clearly, Lin Changqing was already foaming at the mouth with rage.

Tong’er’s brows furrowed slightly, leaping up and facing Lin Changqing.

“Grunt! Grunt!”

The Treasure Pig in Tong’er’s embrace opened both eyes rather tiredly and looked toward Lin Changqing somewhat lazily.

Lin Changqing’s face changed as if being stared at by a desolate beast.

Facing this snotty brat without the strength to tie up a chicken, he actually felt timid.

More accurately speaking, he was nervous about the Treasure Pig in Tong’er’s embrace.

Lin Changqing could not feel any threat from this adorable and pink lumpy piglet, and also could not sense any kind of might.

But that sneeze earlier was real.

Tong’er gave Lin Changqing a glance and said coolly, “Brat, stop making a show of force here. I’ll tell you very responsibly, you don’t even have the qualifications to carry his shoes for him. Uh ... Give him some time, he’ll let you know what’s called despair. Now, get lost.”

The originally incomparably haughty words sounded very comical coming out of Tong’er’s mouth.

Tong’er’s voice was childish, sounding more like acting like a spoiled child and not a warning.

But no one dared to overlook his existence.

That ping pig held in his arms was too powerful!

Lin Changqing looked at Tong’er, expression changing again and again.
