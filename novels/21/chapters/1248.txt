Chapter 1252: Heart of Stone

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In Ye Yuan’s hand, he was grasping a small piece of light-gray crystal.

This crystal was very small. Placing in a pile of rubble, it was not conspicuous at all.

Mixing together with those stone fragments, one could not perceive anything different at all.

If one did not look closely, then one could not tell at all.

When Stonebrave and the rest saw this scene, each and every one of them was unbelievably panic-stricken, and no longer dared to step forward.

“Huhu, why aren’t you guys attacking anymore? Weren’t you still pretty brave just now?”

Ye Yuan looked towards Stonebrave with a broad smile and suddenly switched to an astonished expression and said, “Eh? Why didn’t he revive this time?”

Stonebrave and the rest fell silent. They were all stonemen, their faces did not have very rich expressions.

But very clearly, an oppressed to the extreme feeling crept out among these stonemen.

“All not speaking anymore? I wonder what kind of outcome it will be if I crush it? It seems like somebody said just now that they can’t be killed.”

Finished talking, essence energy fluctuated on Ye Yuan’s body, and he was about to crush that piece of crystal.

Stonebrave turned pale with fright and hurriedly said, “Don’t! We ... We concede!”

With him saying so, it was equivalent to admitting that this crystal was their weak spot.

Actually, it was already not important whether Stonebrave admitted it or not.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heh, that’s more like it! If I didn’t guess wrongly, this is your fatal weak spot, right? What do you mean can’t be killed? Not even coming up with a good thing when boasting.”

Others not being able to find the stonemen’s weak point; it was because they did not have that strength.

Wanting to shatter these stonemen into fragments multiple times and even find their weak point from there, this was not what the average person could accomplish.

These stonemen were all existences comparable to the Ten Great Divine Kings.

Stonebrave’s strength was even a pinnacle existence among the Ten Great Divine Kings.

Wanting to accomplish this was easier said than done.

In the process of that fight previously, Ye Yuan took every detail of the field into his sights.

Don’t look at how his movements were erratic. Actually, he was examining those stonemen that were shattered every single time.

In the end, he discovered that no matter how he struck them down, those rubble pieces would revolve around this light-gray crystal and rejoin.

Therefore, this piece of crystal was clearly where the crux of their revival lay.

As long as they shattered this crystal, they most likely could not revive anymore.

“You ... How did you know? I’m certain that currently in this Divine Realm, nobody knows about my stonemen clan’s weak point anymore!” Stonebrave said gloomily.

The stonemen clan was already extinct in the Divine Realm. It should be impossible for there to be someone who knew their weak point.

But ... this human in front of them actually really found it!

This made him very depressed, very perplexed.

“Huhu, you all have life. Since there’s life, then there’s a weak point. As long as one searches diligently, they can always find it. Now, it’s your turn to answer this young master’s questions. What’s this crystal? I feel that it’s rather extraordinary.”

Ye Yuan held this small piece of crystal in his hand and discovered that there was actually faintly a strange undulation transmitting out inside.

This undulation was just like a human’s heart, beating non-stop.

This was probably where the source of the stonemen being able to revive non-stop lied.

“This ... ”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s question, Stonebrave hesitated.

“Looks like you don’t care about your clan member’s life. Since that’s the case ...”

“Hold on! I’ll talk! I’ll talk! This ... This is the Heart of Stone, it’s also the energy source of my stonemen clan. With it around, we’ll have an endless stream of energy,” Stonebrave said.

“Uh ... Heart of Stone? That’s also fitting. But ... it shouldn’t stop here, right?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Although these stonemen’s strength were powerful, their temperaments were very straightforward and did not have much cunningness at all.

Stonebrave was a little old-handed, but it was also very limited.

Compared to the human race, they were too honest and simple.

Although one was unable to observe their expressions, one could also detect many things from their undulations.

Stonebrave was not willing to speak of the Heart of Stone. Clearly, there were other concerns. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was also precisely because of this point that Ye Yuan did not deal a killing blow.

He felt that these stonemen seemed to have a tremendous grudge toward the human race. Hence, that was why he attacked him.

Otherwise, with Ye Yuan’s disposition, he would have long crushed this Heart of Stone. Why would he talk so much crap with Stonebrave?

“L-Little Brother, Stonebrave was wrong! Stonebrave shouldn’t have opposed you! I-I beg you to let Stonebold go. We ... We’ll escort you out!”

Stonebrave thoroughly yielded. He was not willing to say what kind of secret this Heart of Stone had, but did not know how to lie either. He could only use this sort of method to implore Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “Heh, could it be that you think this young master is very easy-going? Don’t bargain with this young master, you have no leeway to choose! Going to speak or not?”

Ye Yuan raised his hand high up, the essence energy on his body rippling once again.

Stonebrave’s eyes swiveled around, clearly very conflicted.

But he finally still steeled his heart and said viciously, “Stonebold, sorry! The secret of the Heart of Stone should be buried in the annals of history! Otherwise, none of us can live either!”

Finished talking, Stonebrave raised his hand, and it was a punch. The target was actually Stonebold’s Heart of Stone in Ye Yuan’s hand!

Ye Yuan could not help being incomparably shocked. He could feel that Stonebrave cared about Stonebold’s life and death very much.

But when he forcefully inquired about the Heart of Stone’s secrets, Stonebrave actually made such a resolution.

It seemed like this Stone of Heart was not ordinary!

Ye Yuan’s figure moved, lightly dodging Stonebrave’s punch.

“Heh, you, this leader, actually want to kill your own clan member in front of everybody!” Ye Yuan deliberately mocked.

“Humph! You humans are all so despicable! Big Brother Stonebrave doing so, isn’t it still all forced by you?”

“Brothers, we fight it out with him! Today, either he dies, or we perish!”

“Kill this human, take revenge for Stonebold!”

What made Ye Yuan surprised was that not only did these stonemen not have the slightest intention of grumbling at Stonebrave, they become even more bounded by a common hatred for the enemy instead.

“Heh, didn’t expect that Big Brother actually became a villain for once today. But these stonemen are really honest and frank,” White Light said helplessly.

“There seems to be a very unpleasant past between the stonemen and human race,” Li-er said.

The nine remaining stonemen swarmed around Ye Yuan. But after Ye Yuan’s strength skyrocketed, they were not a match at all.

On the contrary, Ye Yuan counter-killed several stonemen again, holding their Heart of Stone in his hands.

“Argh ... Damn human, I’ll fight it out with you!”

Suddenly, Stonebrave’s entire person seemed to have turned berserk. A dazzling light emitted from his glabella.

When the other stonemen saw this scene, each and every one of them cried out in shock.

“Big Brother Stonebrave, don’t!”

But Stonebrave did not have the intention of stopping.

Ye Yuan knew that that glabella place was precisely where the Heart of Stone lied.

A terrifying undulation came over. Ye Yuan actually felt a sensation of facing death!

“Not good! That blockhead is going to self-detonate! What a terrifying energy undulation! Big Brother is in danger!” White Light exclaimed. White Light’s expression changed as he said this.
