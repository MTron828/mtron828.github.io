Chapter 2835: Words Shocking the Listeners!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“This seat came here today to accept a disciple on Master’s behalf!”

The first sentence that Zhou Pinespring said when he opened his mouth stunned everyone present.

It was because his gaze looked towards Ye Yuan!

That meaning was self-explanatory!

It was not Zhou Pinespring taking in a disciple. It was Zhou Pinespring’s master taking in a disciple!

This … was too shocking!

Those present were all Heaven One’s upper echelons. They naturally knew who Zhou Pinespring’s master was.

A Hegemon Realm was actually accepting a disciple on his master’s behalf!

This was also to say that he had to address Ye Yuan as his apprentice brother?

‘The Emperor Realm powerhouses present virtually had an urge to vomit blood. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This was also going too over the top, right?

Especially Zuo Chen, he simply wanted to cry but had no tears.

This is my disciple, alright? Have you guys considered my feelings when accepting disciples?

He was still my disciple just now. In a blink of an eye, he became my ancestor!

The war report wrote very clearly that I’ve already taken him in as a disciple, alright?

Is this really okay?

If he still did not have the mind to teach Ye Yuan before this battle, but after this, he was really moved by the idea of accepting Ye Yuan as his disciple.

However, now that he did, there was no more chance.

To Hegemon Realms, all were ants.

Not entering Hegemon, one would never have the qualifications to be mentioned in the same breath with them.

Moreover, Zuo Chen was just a mere Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouse.

Zhou Pinespring looked toward Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Ye Yuan, my master is Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s alchemy path’s number one person, Hegemon Cloudmount! He knows that your alchemy path talent is astonishing and wants to take you in as a disciple. Are you willing?”

Ye Yuan was also very surprised by this.

This bunch of Hegemon Realms were also too good at playing, right?

However, he immediately shook his head and said, “Not willing!”

“Gah”

This sudden great reversal made everyone unable to react.

It resulted in everyone making all kinds of strange noises.

Even Zhou Pinespring also looked at Ye Yuan extremely surprisedly.

This boy seemed to really be somewhat extraordinary!

Acknowledging Hegemon Cloudmount as his master, that was how many heavenly alchemists’ dream? Even Zuo Chen, who was present, did not dare to have such an extravagant hope too.

It was because Hegemon Cloudmount had stopped accepting disciples a long time ago!

Unless some heaven-defying to the extreme prodigy really appeared in this Heaven One Continent, otherwise, he would not make an exception.

But, this kind of opportunity, Ye Yuan rejected it without even thinking.

This was indeed too surprising!

He said with a serious face, “Ye Yuan, do you know what kind of existence Master Cloudmount is? If you miss this opportunity, you might regret it for life!”

Ye Yuan also had a serious face as he nodded and said, “I know! However, I refuse!”

He was not a fool. Could the master of a Hegemon be an ordinary person?

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s number one person, even placed across all the heavens, that was also absolutely a titan-level existence!

However, Ye Yuan had his own principles.

Dan Fei shouted coldly, “Ye Yuan, are you crazy? Do you know what you rejected?”

Even Zuo Chen also said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, don’t fool around! This is an opportunity to ascend to heaven in one step. You’re a divergent cultivator, with Ancestor’s ability, there’s absolutely no problem in guaranteeing that you enter Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm!”

As he said, he bowed to Zhou Pinespring and said, “Master Pinespring, taking into account that this boy is young, don’t stoop to his level!”

The other Emperor Realm powerhouses also urged Ye Yuan one after another, asking him not to be headstrong.

This kind of opportunity, which of them were not envious?

But Ye Yuan rejected it flatly. It was putting on too much air!

Zhou Pinespring looked at Ye Yuan and suddenly smiled.

“Interesting! Very interesting! Can you tell me why you refused?”

Ye Yuan said calmly, “Firstly, I’ve already acknowledged Master Zuo Chen as master. My words are my bond! If I change masters at this time, it’s undoubtedly betraying my master!”

Hearing this, Zuo Chen was incomparably moved in his heart too.

It was true that he was an Emperor Realm powerhouse. But, in front of a Hegemon Realm, he was nothing.

Hegemons would not care about what he thought.

But Ye Yuan could be considerate of him, even rejecting such a huge temptation for this. How could he not be moved?

At that time, he only took Ye Yuan in for the sake of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s reputation. He believed that Ye Yuan also knew.

But now, Ye Yuan could do this. This made people have no choice but to admire him.

Zuo Chen could not help feeling vicissitudes of emotion. This disciple was the right call!

But, the more it was so, the more he could not hold Ye Yuan back!

“Master …”

Zuo Chen was just thinking of opening his mouth to speak but was stopped by Zhou Pinespring with a hand gesture. He said to Ye Yuan, “Continue.”

Ye Yuan said, “Secondly, I know that the Hegemons want to reward me with this, but the contributions this time wasn’t made by me alone! Without the brothers fighting with their lives, I simply could not have killed my way out of the heavy encirclement with my power alone! I understand that in the

eyes of you Hegemons, whatever True Sovereign Heaven, Saint Sovereign Heaven, we are all ants. Even Emperor Realm powerhouses are similarly ants too! But, without them, Heaven One would have long been finished! Just based on you all, these Hegemons, you can’t stop the blood race army!

Therefore, Ye Yuan isn’t worthy of taking credit for this!”

These words made everyone present visibly moved.

Especially Ming Yi and the few other great commanders, they immediately gave rise to a feeling of how a gentleman would die for his bosom friend.

These words reached the depths of their hearts!

Allalong, they had been cannon fodders.

But cannon fodders had the use of cannon fodders too!

Regardless of whether it was Hegemon Realm or Saint Sovereign Heaven, they were all protecting Heaven One!

After this battle, everyone was celebrating the victory.

But apart from those Saint Sovereign Heaven, who would still remember the valiant souls who died on the battlefield?

But Ye Yuan engraved it in his heart!

This boy was worth entrusting!

This was the voice in everyone’s hearts!

Ye Yuan did not stop. He continued, “Thirdly, I entered the Extreme Medicine Sect for the sake of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s alchemy classics. I have my own Dao in the path of alchemy! Therefore, there’s no difference to me whoever I acknowledge as master.”

“Hiss…”

Within the great hall, the sounds of cold air being sucked in and breathed out.

This third point was too arrogant!

Incredibly arrogant!

The first two points touched people and visibly moved people.

But the third point was really too monkeying around!

Especially Zuo Chen, he was almost crying.

Iwas just feeling touched, you slapped my face sonorously in a blink of an eye?

It turned out that you didn’t plan on treating me as a master at all!

But, thinking about it, they were all smart people. Ye Yuan probably never counted on him, this bargain teacher, at all from start to end.

“Ye Yuan, what nonsense are you saying? Get the hell out!” Zuo Chen shouted coldly.

It was clearly berating, but actually, it was protecting Ye Yuan.

These words were too treasonous and heretical!

This one in front of them was a Hegemon!

Did he freaking not want his life anymore?

Ye Yuan gave Zuo Chen a glance, slightly touched in his heart.

“Hahaha …”

Zhou Pinespring suddenly laughed loudly. Zhou Pinespring’s heart thumped, secretly thinking: not good!

Now, a Hegemon was really going to get angry.

If you refuse, then just refuse. Why did you have to give such a bloody reason!

“Well said!”

Zhou Pinespring laughed loudly and said, “Ye Yuan, this seat really likes you more and more! The journey of Dao is extremely profound. But only by treading out one’s own Dao can one reach the apex! Although your realm is low, your heart is clear as a mirror! A shame, a shame. If you weren’t a divergent

cultivator, how great would that be!”

But Ye Yuan said, “So what if I am a divergent cultivator? The path that others couldn’t get through, I, Ye Yuan, might not be unable to clear it!”
