Chapter 1814 Entire Sect Gaining Enlightenment on Dao

Qian Ye’s complexion was deathly pale, whole body lying limp there. His gaze revealed a look of despair.This drumbeat to others was endless benefits.

But to him, it was the final death knell.

“E-Elder Tao, s-save me!”

Qian Ye pulled Elder Tao’s arm with a look of despair.

Just now, everyone was still waiting to see Ye Yuan make a fool of himself. No one would take Ye Yuan’s obsession seriously.

Who knew that in a twinkle, the Big Dipper Seven Stars’ drumbeat echoed in the sky above the Shadowmoon Sect.

Elder Tao was still in the midst of shock currently and did not come back to his senses for a long time.

Qian Ye shook repeatedly before he suddenly snapped back to reality.

“What did you say?” Elder Tao asked like he woke up from a dream.

Qian Ye directly knelt in front of Elder Tao and cried, “S-Save me! Elder Tao, I don’t want to die!”

When the seventh drumbeat sounded out, his entire person broke down.

There was only a thought in his mind right now, that was to keep living.

Elder Tao’s face suddenly fell and he kicked Qian Ye to the ground and said in a cold voice, “You fool, what kind of existence did you provoke?!”

Qian Ye had tears strewn all over his face as he said weepingly, “I ... How could I have known that ... he could actually sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum?”

Currently, he regretted it until his intestines turned green. If he had long known that it would be like this, he would not go and rear his head even if beaten to death back then,

The ones who fell out with Ye Yuan were not just him, Qian Ye, there was also the Cloudsword lineage and Immortal Abode lineage.

But, only he was the bird who took the lead, wanting to kill Ye Yuan several times.

Especially the first ambush, it nearly almost killed Ye Yuan.

And this also thoroughly enraged Ye Yuan.

Qian Ye naturally did not think that Ye Yuan could do anything to him. Just a mere Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, even if a genius, who knew how long it would take to grow up too.

But how could he have thought that Ye Yuan only used 200 years and possessed the strength to kill him?

What was even more damning was that after Jiang Hong made a move, Ye Yuan still stubbornly wanted to sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum.

As a result ... he succeeded ...

He actually succeeded!

How did the current Elder Tao still have that doting look? Rage was all over his face.

He pointed at Qian Ye’s nose and cursed, “You pig! You provoked a colossal leviathan for the entire Soaring Flower lineage! Do you know what this Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum being sounded signifies? It means that he’s the Shadowmoon Sect’s number one genius since ancient times! It signifies that he’ll surmount everyone in the future! Wanting to kill you is merely a matter of casually saying a word! At this time, who would dare protect you? Mn? Who dares to protect you?”

Elder Tao’s current mentality was already totally different from before.

Previously, he only took Ye Yuan’s stubbornness as a joke and waited to watch the show.

But now, Ye Yuan proved his terrifying talent. This was equivalent to provoking an incredibly powerful foe for the Soaring Flower lineage.

The Soaring Flower lineage might very likely be suppressed in the sect because of this in the future.

The situation of three lineages in a tripartite balance of forces will be broken very soon.

Originally, a Baili Qingyan emerging from the Immortal Abode lineage already put a lot of pressure on the Soaring Flower lineage.

Now, things were good, one disaster piled on after another.

Qian Ye collapsed to the ground with a thud, his entire person seemed to have been drained.

Elder Tao gave him a pitiful glance. Suddenly, his tone eased up and he said coolly, “Relax, the temptation of sounding the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum is too great. That’s the entire sect from top to bottom owing him a favor. Using such great favor to kill people, I believe that that kid won’t be so foolish.”

...

After seven drumbeats, it did not dissipate right away. The sound reverberated above the sky of the Shadowmoon Sect, lingering on.

The Shadowmoon Sect disciples practically all entered cultivation states under this drumbeat.

The Great Dao this drum sound contained complemented that cultivation method and was greatly beneficial to them.

One had to know, the Shadowmoon Sect had already established the sect for no idea how many tens of thousands of years. This was the first time the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum was sounded.

Passed this village and there would be no such shop anymore.

Even the nine great skill-imparting elders also all entered a state of comprehension at this time.

The Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum was an empyrean spirit treasure. The Great Dao contained inside could be said to be a supreme treasure to them.

Rather, Ye Yuan seemed a little bored at this time.

His entire body was already drenched in sweat. Beating the drums was not so easy.

Empyrean spirit treasure, even a True God powerhouse could not beat it. If not for Ye Yuan being in possession of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, he absolutely could not sound it too.

Even so, Ye Yuan also expended tremendous effort before sounding the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum.

After recovering for a while, Ye Yuan felt a little bored.

He reckoned that right now, the entire Shadowmoon Sect was in the midst of comprehension, it was impossible for anyone to come and acknowledge him.

As for Qian Ye, he was not worried.

He knew that under this situation currently, no matter how foolish the Soaring Flower lineage’s people were, they also did not dare to let Qian Ye go anymore.

Hence, he simply started cultivating on the spot.

This drumbeat reverberated for an entire month’s time.

During this one month’s time, the Shadowmoon Sect was in great jubilation from top to bottom. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Quite a few people directly broke through realms after hearing the drumbeat.

Finally, the drumbeat gradually dissipated. The skill-imparting elders also woke up from meditation.

Their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan was already totally different.

They knew that the entire Shadowmoon Sect from top to bottom owed Ye Yuan a massive favor.

This favor was because of the ancestor’s ancestral teachings.

The significance of this drumbeat to the Shadowmoon Sect was too great!

Jiang Hong’s gaze suddenly turned intent, and he cried out in shock, “Woodcutter, you gained enlightenment again?”

When everyone heard this, they all looked over toward the woodcutter, each and every one of them turning pale with fright.

The woodcutter’s aura was much stronger than it was a month ago.

Clearly, the benefits that he obtained from this drum sound was much more than the others.

One had to know, reaching their boundary, even a tiny bit of improvement was extremely hard to come by.

The woodcutter chuckled and said, “Such a great opportunity, how can Your Father let it go easily? Comparing talent, Your Father isn’t as talented as Ye Yuan. But compared to the few of you, it’s still more than sufficient.”

When the other few people heard the woodcutter’s arrogant words, each and every one of their faces became black like the bottom of a pot.

Right at this time, a middle-aged man in azure dao-robes slowly walked out of the void.

Seeing the arrival, the nine great skill-imparting elders immediately adjusted their clothing and went forward to welcome.

“Paying respects to Sect Master!” the nine people said in unison.

The middle-aged man slowly nodded and said, “Mn, the few of you have worked hard!”

The nine people hurriedly said, “Dare not!”

The middle-aged man’s gaze went past the nine people and looked at the Ye Yuan in the distance.

Ye Yuan also bowed and said respectfully, “Ye Yuan pays respect to Sect Master!”

Ye Yuan could feel that this middle-aged man’s aura was even more unfathomable than the nine great skill-imparting elders.

It seemed like this Shadowmoon Sect’s foundation was really deep!

The middle-aged man smiled faintly and said, “Since my Shadowmoon Sect was established, I can’t tell how many people wanted to sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, but no one has ever succeeded before. I really didn’t expect that it was actually sounded by a Divine Lord Realm youngster. Ye Yuan, the ancestor’s last order, we dare not defy. Now, you can say out your wish. Of course, if you haven’t thought of it yet, you can say again later.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No need, I’ve thought about it long ago. Ye Yuan has no other request and only wants to kill Qian Ye!”
