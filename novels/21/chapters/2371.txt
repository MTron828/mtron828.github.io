Chapter 2377: Agitating the World!

“Qin Chao they all, they really succeeded! How is this possible?”

“The scary thing isn’t that they succeeded, but that the Sentry Celestial Palace didn’t even send the news out!”

“Just who the hell was that young man? Also, how did he do it?”

... ...

Countless doubts lingered in the hearts of everyone in Ziwei Sect.

They wished to capture Qin Chao back right now and ask him what in the world was going on.

This young man appeared too abruptly.

His strength was formidable until it made people’s hair stand on end.

Too mysterious!

In the entire Skysouth region, only their Ziwei Sect knew what had happened.

But they also did not know anything.

However, what was fortunate was that as long as the news did not leak out, their Ziwei Sect would at least not suffer a catastrophic disaster.

This was because the divine race did not know what happened too. They naturally would not associate it with them.

But Mo Qingshan was also worried. Concerning the matter of the Sentry Celestial Palace being destroyed, upstairs would know sooner or later.

At that time, the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace would surely be furious. Which sect would suffer a disaster would be hard to say.

“Sect Master, why aren’t you speaking?” When everyone was discussing fiercely, someone noticed that Mo Qingshan was currently being silent, and could not resist asking.

Mo Qingshan’s expression flickered slightly and he said, “I’m was thinking, turns out that the divine race isn’t undefeatable too!”

Suddenly, it was deathly silent inside the Ziwei Sect’s main hall.

Yeah, it turned out that the divine race was not invincible!

It was true that they were a powerful race, but they would die too!

Mo Qingshan’s words were like a plague, spreading in everyone’s hearts.

But he ignored everyone’s surprise and continued saying: “These few days, I’ve been thinking about Qin Chao’s words. The more I think, the more inhumane I feel that I am! I didn’t even dare to protect my own daughter, am I still considered human? What he said is right, we’re humans, not animals reared by the divine race! We are already numbed until we’re without guts anymore! And this is probably what the divine race hopes to see the most, right?”

Someone immediately retorted, “But Sect Master, although that kid can do it, it doesn’t mean that we can do it too! The divine race is too strong!”

Mo Qingshan nodded his head and said, “Yes, so we need to become strong!”

Similar words were playing out in the Skysouth’s various sects.

Ye Yuan’s action of destroying the Sentry Celestial Palace, was like a seed, taking root and sprouting in the hearts of everyone in Skysouth!

The various races were weak, viewing the divine race as the messengers of heaven.

This was the subliminal psychology that the divine race’s countless years of great pressure brought to the various races.

The divine race was invincible!

But, when a person came soaring into existence and shattered this myth, it would give people a fierce impact.

This, was like a ray of dawn in the darkness, bringing a trace of faint light.

This light would eventually bloom, returning light to the world! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

And Ye Yuan was this dawn!

... ...

In a spirit mountain, Qin Chao already completely transformed into a little fanboy.

He looked at the Ye Yuan brandishing his sword, his eyes full of worship!

Presently, Ye Yuan was like that unexpected glimpse of a beauty in his eyes, being stunning to the extreme.

In that battle, he had a taste of Ye Yuan’s calm and collected killing technique inside the sword formation. Ye Yuan was just like a celestial deity.

Only then did he know it turns out that humans could be so powerful!

The Heavenly Dao’s messengers in their eyes were totally clay chickens and pottery dogs under Ye Yuan’s sword!

Who were those that Ye Yuan killed?

Peak Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm super powerhouses! Furthermore, more than one!

One person taking on a group by himself!

That sort of heroism, that sort of aura which showed disdain on all under the heavens, was already deeply imprinted in Qin Chao’s heart, unable to dispel.

What pleasantly surprised him even more, was that Ye Yuan was actually willing to teach him sword art!

Qin Chao was famous for sword arts in the Ziwei Sect, his talent extremely high.

Of course, this was relative to the Ziwei Sect.

When Qin Chao made this request weakly, Ye Yuan agreed without the slightest hesitation.

For no reason other than that he could step forward bravely, and go to the Sentry Celestial Palace together with him.

But after teaching Qin Chao swordsmanship, he discovered that Qin Chao’s Sword Dao talent was truly astonishing.

His previous strength being too weak was because the Ziwei Sect’s swordsmanship was too lousy.

Now, Ye Yuan’s horizons were extremely high. He helped Qin Chao improve his cultivation method and taught him to comprehend Sword Dao.

As a result, Qin Chao’s swordsmanship advanced at a tremendous pace.

Ye Yuan also could not help sighing emotionally when he saw this scene. The talents of ancient geniuses were indeed not what later generations could compare to!

However, Ye Yuan also had an idea in his heart.

The spiritual energy abundance in this era was also far from what later generations could compare to.

The current Heavenspan World and the Heavenspan World of succeeding generations were also very different in terms of topography.

The damage caused to the Heavenspan World by the Doomsday Battle was too great!

That battle fought until space shattered, causing galaxies in sore straits.

Only all the way until tens of billions of years later did it gradually recover back to normal.

However, that era that Ye Yuan was born in, things had already recovered a lot. Geniuses such as Wan Zhen also emerged crazily.

In terms of talent, Wan Zhen should not lose to any genius of this era!

Being able to perfectly fuse Five Element Laws, even when placed in this era, he was also a top genius.

As long as Wan Zhen was given time, he could definitely grow into an existence who could resist progenitor level.

Unfortunately, there was already not much time.

“Senior, it turns out that sword art can still be used this way! You’re really too incredible! If Junior can learn 1% of yours, I won’t fear those divine race members too!” Qin Chao said excitedly.

The swordsmanship that Ye Yuan used made him have a feeling of being filled with wisdom.

Only at this time did he understand that it turned out, so many applications were still hidden in Sword Dao.

For some time, he drew inferences from one fact, all kinds of wonderful ideas surfacing in his mind.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The power of laws isn’t the more the better. If you specialize in Sword Dao, when you reach the level of rules in the future, even the divine race’s ancestors will also somewhat dread you!”

Qin Chao’s hot blood was boiling when he heard that. A look of enrapture was on his face.

Ye Yuan’s guidance opened up another window for him.

“Alright, it’s almost time, we should head out,” Ye Yuan said.

Qin Chao was taken aback and said, “Senior, where are we going?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “To destroy Sentry Celestial Palaces!”

Qin Chao’s entire body trembled and he said, “Still destroying? Your Excellency, isn’t it too dangerous? What if, we run into Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse ...”

Ye Yuan smiled confidently and said, “If I want to go, can he stop me?”

Qin Chao’s expression relaxed. Nodding his head like a chicken pecking for rice, He said, “Of course he can’t! Hahaha ...”

Several days later, the southern border central region Sentry Celestial Palaces were all destroyed!

Another half a month later, the western region Sentry Celestial Palaces were all destroyed!

... ...

Before Ye Yuan moved out, a Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse led a team and just descended upon the Skysouth region, planning on starting to investigate the matter of the Sentry Celestial Palaces being completely destroyed when one news after another came in quick succession.

The Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm was instantly flustered.

Investigate what crap!

An area at the Sentry Celestial Palace being completely destroyed could still be a coincidence.

But dozens of Sentry Celestial Palaces being destroyed in a row, this sort of thing was definitely a huge conspiracy!

They had no way of investigating even if they wanted to as well.

Because this was not a matter of the Skysouth.

People in all the lands of the southern border were instantly seething with excitement!
