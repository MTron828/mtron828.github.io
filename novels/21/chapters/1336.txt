Chapter 1340: Chaos Heavenspan Canon!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What ... What happened? I feel like ... I’m almost unable to breathe!”

“What’s the deal with this huge mountain? Why would such a giant mountain appear in the sky above Jewelhill City?”

“What terrifying pressure! I ... I almost can’t resist kneeling down anymore!”

“It’s the Heavenspan Mountain! This giant mountain is very similar to the Heavenspan Mountain! My God, what in the world is happening to Jewelhill City?”

“It ... It wouldn’t fall down, right? If such a large mountain were to drop down, the entire Jewelhill City would probably be reduced to dust!”

...

Just as the entire Heavenspan Mountain was in chaos, when the Dao Ancestors were forced out of the Heavenspan Mountain, the whole Jewelhill City was similarly in a mess.

Above Jewelhill City, an enormous mountain appeared bafflingly.

That pressure faintly contained the might of Heavenly Dao, making everyone prostrate in worship.

Not just Jewelhill City, the entire Wu Meng Capital City’s region, everyone was able to see this giant mountain.

It was too big!

Boundlessly huge!

“Elder Xuan, let’s hurry up and leave Jewelhill City! Once this giant mountain falls, none of us can escape!” Wang Family, Wang Su’s expression changed drastically as he said.

In close to 30 years’ time, Wang Su and Wang Xuanfeng had always stayed in the Wang Family, causing immense pressure for the Myriad Treasure Tower.

It was just that seeing that towering Heavenspan Mountain in the sky, he seriously could not sit still anymore.

The pressure that giant mountain brought made his two legs tremble.

Wang Xuanfeng also looked incredibly grim as he said, “Let’s go! Looks like this Jewelhill City can’t be preserved!”

After the two people conversed, they sped outside the city without even saying hello.

Actually, it was not just them. The entire Jewelhill City’s martial artists were all fleeing outside the city.

Currently, the city entrance was already blocked until not even a drop of water could seep through, all scrambling one after another.

Even the city guards could not do anything about them either.

Actually, there were quite a few city guards who also joined the ranks of escaping.

That pressure in the sky was seriously too horrifying!

How could the might of heaven and earth be what human strength could resist?

At the Myriad Treasure Tower, Su Linpu and Yang Rui were similarly looking at that giant mountain in the sky, their expressions flickering incessantly.

“Tower Lord, aren’t we going?” Su Linpu said.

Yang Rui smiled bitterly and said, “Go? Can we leave? No matter how fast our movement techniques are, we can’t possibly escape either!”

“What in the world is going on? Why is it Jewelhill City?” Su Linpu said with a belly full of puzzlement.

“Sigh, yeah! The Heavenspan World has countless cities, why would it appear at Jewelhill City? Could it be that ... the entire Heavenspan Mountain flew to Jewelhill City? But how is this possible?” Yang Rui muttered.

...

In a twinkle, 30 years passed in the outside world. Ye Yuan spent 300 years inside the World Suppressing Stele.

However, right when the entire Heavenspan World was raging like a storm, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes.

Ye Yuan’s eyes revealed rays of brilliant light, his entire person in a state of extreme excitement.

His current state was excellent to the extreme.

Opposite, the Dustless in gray clothes stared fixedly at Ye Yuan.

Seeing him meet his eyes, he used an extremely peculiar expression and asked probingly, “You, kid, what the hell did you do?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

With the cultivation method forming, Ye Yuan was currently excited. Seeing Dustless inquire, he said with a blank look, “Did what? Senior, haven’t you been watching all along? I was creating a cultivation method that belongs to me!”

Dustless himself was also in a state of dumbfoundedness. He was certain that the terrifying happenings in the outside world were absolutely related to Ye Yuan!

It was just that he did not understand what the hell Ye Yuan did, to actually be able to trigger such a terrifying heaven and earth abnormal activity.

“Do you know that right now, Jewelhill City is already in chaos? The Heavenspan Mountain actually appeared above Jewelhill City’s sky!’ Dustless said in immense shock.

“En? Heavenspan Mountain?”

Ye Yuan currently had a blank look when suddenly, the mountains shook and the earth trembled!

The Heavenspan Mountain above Jewelhill City finally slowly landed!

Rumble ...

A boundless pressure made the entire world changed colors.

The grand array over Jewelhill City was akin to paper under the Heavenspan Mountain.

“ARGHH!!”

In Jewelhill City, tragic cries linked up together.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he flashed out from inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space, his expression also becoming incomparably ugly.

“Senior, what’s going on here?” Ye Yuan’s expression changed drastically as he talked.

“You’re asking me? I’m asking you! Wasn’t this thing summoned by you?” Dustless said huffily.

Ye Yuan was stunned when he heard that and said, “Me? No way, right?”

“Hence I’m asking you, what the hell did you do, to actually trigger such a heavenly punishment!” Dustless’s voice was almost shrieking.

He was very certain that this Heavenspan Mountain was summoned by Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan said depressedly, “I ... I don’t know either! I was really creating a cultivation method and just finished!”

“Heh, asked you not to mess around, you insisted on doing it! Now, you blundered, right? I want to see how you take care of it!” Dustless said with an angry and disappointed appearance.

Rumble!

The Heavenspan Mountain obscured the sun. The area it covered was not just Jewelhill City, one small plot of land!

Those people fleeing had no place to hide at all!

In the midst of everyone’s despairing screams, the Heavenspan Mountain landed with a loud bang.

However, it was not like everybody imagined. The end of the world did not arrive.

That incomparably huge Heavenspan Mountain dissipated into nothing just like that.

“This ... What’s going on again? Where’s that giant mountain?”

“H-Haha, saved! I didn’t die! I didn’t die! Hahaha ...”

“Where did that giant mountain go? My God, it was too scary just now!”

...

At this time, Jewelhill City was filled with rejoicing sounds of surviving the disaster.

Except, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, his figure flashing, returning inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space once more.

That instant he saw the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, a feeling of being connected by blood welled up in his heart.

He discovered that the bottom-most region of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, the color seemed to have become a little darker.

“Senior, I feel like ... I seem to have refined a small portion of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!” Ye Yuan used an extremely skeptical tone and said to Dustless.

Dustless’ gaze turned intent, and he said doubtfully, “Brat, you mustn’t scare me! Immortal Grove obtained this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain for millions of years and also didn’t dare to say he refined it!”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath, his mind stirring slightly.

The massive Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was becoming small at a speed visible to the naked eye, and finally, being placed above the palm by Ye Yuan!

Seeing this scene, Dustless’s eyeballs were almost popping out.

Ye Yuan really refined it!

“You ... How did you do it?” Dustless said in astonishment.

Ye Yuan was speechless as he said, “I don’t know either! Senior, you don’t use this kind of expression to look at me, I really don’t know! I ... I just created the first level of the cultivation method, that’s all.”

Dustless was similarly speechless and could not resist asking, “You ... Just what kind of could not resist did you create?”

Ye Yuan said, “I haven’t thought of the name yet, but this cultivation method should be the most suitable for me! Uh ... This cultivation method originated from the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, so I’ll call it Chaos Heavenspan Canon!”
