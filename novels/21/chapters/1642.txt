Chapter 1646 Last Rank Stall

“What’s wrong with it? Keep it!”

Ye Yuan took the Seven Treasure Profound Fruit and directly threw it to Ning Tianping.

Ning Tianping caught it, feeling that it was very hot.

Rank four items were greatly different from rank three items. They were easily measured in hundreds of millions.

Without the support of a large family at the back, it was very hard to afford this kind of expenditure.

Taking 1.2 billion, that boss could not be bothered to care about these two people, having a high and mighty appearance again.

An Origin Deity Realm bringing so much money out, he knew that Ye Yuan was definitely already targeted by quite a few people.

It was naturally alright for Ning Tianping. If Ye Yuan was alone by himself, someone would probably have designs on him.

“Brother Ye, I’ll definitely think of a way to return this money to you!” Ning Tianping gritted his teeth and said.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Forget it! If you didn’t come out, I believe that this doesn’t matter to you. But now, what will you use to pay back?”

Ning Tianping could not help choking when he heard that, but Ye Yuan turned and asked that boss, “Boss, I want to inquire from you, does the Heavenly Network Gathering have news about Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone?”

The boss’ eyelids raised slightly and he said with some surprise, “You want Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones? What a coincidence, I have it here!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said in surprise, “Boss, how many do you have? I’ll buy all!”

The boss looked at Ye Yuan with a strange look and said, “Do you think Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are cabbages on the street? I only have a two-fist-sized piece on hand. If you want to buy, I’ll make it a bit cheaper for you, one billion!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and took out another one billion divine essence stones, and bought the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone.

That boss was repeatedly astonished. He completely did not think that this Origin Deity Realm powerhouse’s net worth was even wealthier than most people at the Divine Lord Realms.

“Boss, do you know what places still have Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones in the Heavenly Network Gathering?” Ye Yuan asked.

This bit of Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones was not enough to fill the crevices between his teeth.

The boss said in puzzlement, “What do you want so many Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones for? If it’s cultivation, such a large piece is sufficient for you to use. Moreover, even if you have some net worth, it probably can’t buy several pieces of Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones either, right?”

On account of two billion he earned, the boss’s words finally became friendlier.

Ye Yuan smiled, “Because of some special circumstances, I need large quantities of Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones. Please give a pointer or two. As for divine essence stones, this Ye has a way.”

The boss said, “Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones are very cherished items. It’s also greatly beneficial to a martial artist’s cultivation. If not in urgent need of money, I also wouldn’t easily take it out to sell. Hence, how many Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones the Heavenly Network Gathering has, I’m not clear either. You can only go and inquire about it yourself. However ... I know that half a month later, the three great factions will host an auction jointly. And one of the auction items is a Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp and he cried out in shock, “Boss, is this true?”

The boss said, “You go and inquire a bit and you’ll know, this matter isn’t some secret. But ... this Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone’s price will definitely start from ten billion.”

Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone was the higher-order form of the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone. The energy provided was purer, the energy contained was also greater.

It was just that compared to the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, Boundless Heavenly Soul Stones were rare until it made one’s hair stand on end.

Ye Yuan did not expect to actually be able to encounter Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone here.

But this way, wanting to win the bid for the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone, the divine essence stones spent will likely reach a very horrifying level.

With the number of divine essence stones in his hands right now, he probably could not even buy a hair.

“Brother Ye, ten billion divine essence stones, this ...”

Even if Ning Tianping grew up in a honey pot since young, he was also taken aback with fright by this divine essence stone number.

Ten billion divine essence stones, even when placed in the Ning Family, it was a substantial figure too.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Originally, I wanted to keep a low profile, buy a few pieces of Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones, then leave. Looking at it now, I can’t keep a low-profile.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ning Tianping’s entire body trembled and he said, “Brother Ye, you want to ...”

Ye Yuan said, “Let’s set up a stall too. Do my original profession.”

Ning Tianping sucked in a deep breath, he knew what Ye Yuan meant.

However, the boss was not convinced as he said, “You, an Origin Deity Realm, what can you sell to earn ten billion divine essence stones? Furthermore, the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate is about to open, large groups of martial artists have gathered in the city. Now, the good stalls are all leased out already, even last-rank stalls probably don’t have many left either. It’s simply nothing more than wishful thinking for you to want to earn so many divine essence stones.”

“Haha, this kid must have just arrived at Heavenly Network Gathering, and thinks that this place is a treasure basin? Just set up a stall and he can rack in a fortune?”

“What does an Origin Deity Realm have to sell to be able to earn ten billion divine essence stones? This kid is daydreaming, right?”

When the stall owners beside heard that Ye Yuan wanted to set up a stall too, they all had mocking looks.

Rank three things, the prices simply had no way of comparing with rank four.

Selling several dozen items tended to not even compare to one rank four items.

Wanting to earn ten billion divine essence stones was basically not too possible.

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “Rest assured, my stall business will definitely be very popular.”

The boss said with a big laugh, “Very popular? Hahaha, kid, you really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Forget it, forget it, since you don’t listen to advice, you can very well go try it out yourself.”

...

Heavenly Network Gathering’s management area, a second-layered heaven Divine Lord martial artist darted Ye Yuan a glance and said, “First-rate stall, 100 million a day. Second-rate stall, 10 million a day. Third-rate stall, five million a day. Fourth-rate stall, one million a day. Last-rank stall ... 100 thousand a day. Uh, the stalls in front are all full. Now, there’s only the last last-rank stall remaining, do you want or not?”

The so-called first-rate stall was naturally the most visible location. The moment everyone entered the Heavenly Network Gathering, they would be able to see it.

This kind of stall, as long as the things were good enough, earning tens of billions in a day, it was still possible.

And that boss’s stall was merely a second-rate stall.

As for last-rank stalls, they were naturally stalls at the corners. Normally, no one cared to show interest. Even items worth 100 thousand, there would be complaints of them being expensive.

Because last-rank stalls might not even earn 100 thousand divine essence stones in a day. It was virtually a loss-making business.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Last-rank stall then, I want to rent half a month.”

Ye Yuan paid the divine essence stones, took the token, and suddenly thought of something and asked, “Oh, right, how is the commission of last-rank stalls charged?”

This token was not merely a symbol of occupancy, it could even monitor the divine essence stones undulations of each stall.

Just like Ye Yuan’s transaction previously, actually, that boss’ token could already detect the approximate number of divine essence stones inside the storage rings.

Good stalls, after the sales reached a certain amount, the Heavenly Network Gathering also had to collect a certain percentage.

The higher the sale, the higher the commission!

The three great factions went through so much effort to build such a market, they naturally wanted to fleece even more divine essence stones.

Maintaining the operation of this market was not just by providing a venue, there was even the safeguard of stronger martial power.

Inside the Heavenly Network Gathering, fighting was strictly prohibited. Otherwise, kill without mercy.

At least in the Heavenly Network Gathering, martial artists were safe.

That martial artist waved his hand impatiently and said, “What commission is charged for last-rank stalls? If you can sell the things, it’s your capability. Go, go, I’m still busy here!”
