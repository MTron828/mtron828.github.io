Chapter 1829 A Certain Someone Is Angry!

“Bian Ziqiu, you got all the limelight alone. You crippled that Yi Qingxiang, so I don’t even have anyone to practice this round anymore.”“Heh, that kid called Yi Qingxiang is too weak. I haven’t even started yet and he dropped down.”

“That’s true. If it were me, I’d also definitely beat him until he looked for his teeth on the ground! Want to blame, blame that brat called Ye Yuan then!”

“Senior Apprentice Brother Yang already said, when he meets that kid, he’ll be even more miserable than Yi Qingxiang.”

The battle had not started yet, the few young men below the stage were currently chatting enthusiastically.

The content of the conversation was naturally the fight between Bian Ziqiu and Yi Qingxiang on that day.

One of them was Yi Qingxiang’s opponent in the previous round, Bian Ziqiu.

But the other person was his opponent in this round, Ruyi Sect’s Wei Yunhui!

Speaking of which, this Wei Yunhui was also just a peak First Firmament Celestial Deity; similar to Yi Qingxiang’s realm.

But in the view of a powerful sect like the Ruyi Sect, the Shadowmoon Sect’s disciples were naturally too weak to stand up to the competition.

Of course, Yi Qingxiang was already seriously injured and would never be able to participate in the competition at the back. This made Wei Yunhui have much less fun.

“Wei Yunhui, the battle has ended, it’s time for you to take the stage next!” Bian Ziqiu said with a smile.

Wei Yunhui shrugged and scolded with a smile, “You this fellow, already messed with him until he’s screwed, still take what stage? Today is merely going through the motions! Speaking of which, it’s also strange, that kid was injured until like that, the Shadowmoon Sect actually still hasn’t announced letting him withdraw from the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.”

Bian Ziqiu smiled and said, “The Shadowmoon Sect only has this bit of dignity left, it’s probably to intentionally repulse us.”

Going up the stage, Wei Yunhui had no opponent and was just waiting for the referee to announce the result.

According to the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s rules, late for an hour was equivalent to automatically giving up the fight and directly conceding defeat.

Although everyone knew that Yi Qingxiang was seriously injured and dying, the Shadowmoon Sect did not announce having him withdraw out of the rest of the competition.

This meant that Wei Yunhui must wait for an hour’s time on the stage.

Time slowly trickled by, Wei Yunhui appeared somewhat irritated and cursed, “Damn thing, became crippled already and they actually still want to repulse people! It’s a pity that he didn’t end up in my hands. Otherwise, I’ll definitely beat the piss out of him!”

High Clarity Sect’s elder was also somewhat impatient already and said to Du Rufeng, “Elder Du, either way, it’s impossible for the person to come, why not directly announce the results.”

Du Rufeng gave him a glance and said coolly, “Rules are rules, the time isn’t up, how can I announce the result?”

Right at this time, several figures slowly walked over, immediately attracting everyone’s gaze.

The person in the lead was precisely Shadowmoon Sect’s elder, Xu Yan.

Today, the Shadowmoon Sect only had Yi Qingxiang, one match. No one from the Shadowmoon Sect came and it did not arouse many people’s attention.

When everyone’s gazes looked behind Xu Yan, there was immediately an uproar.

“That’s Yi Qingxiang? He’s actually fine already!”

“This is impossible! His injuries that day, everyone saw it, he already died. How can he possibly recover?”

“Hang on, his aura is different, he ... he broke through!”

...

On the stage, Wei Yunhui’s pupils constricted.

Yi Qingxiang’s appearance caught him somewhat by surprise.

Of course, this was not the most important thing.

The most important thing was that Yi Qingxiang actually broke through!

Merely ten days’ time from start to finish, not only did Yi Qingxiang recover from his injuries, his realm even went up a level, breaking through to Second Firmament Celestial Deity.

How was this possible?

Below the stage, Bian Ziqiu similarly had a shocked look.

His own attacks, he naturally knew how far he went.

That day, if not for Yi Qingxiang being smart, rolling down the stage at the last moment,, he would already long be a dead man now.

Even if there was a powerful alchemist who saved him, he could forget about recovering without eight to ten years.

A single mishap and it would even affect his cultivation in the future.

But in a short ten days’ time, Yi Qingxiang actually appeared in front of him alive and well.

This kind of feeling was extremely frustrating, even making him somewhat doubt life.

Xu Yan said sarcastically, “Qingxiang, go up. Some people can scarcely wait and want to pummel the piss out of you.”

The current Yi Qingxiang seemed to have been re-molded anew, that kind of stubbornness and unruliness in the past, looking down on everyone and everything, had long already disappeared.

If one was to use one word to describe him, that would be maturity. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Yes, Elder Xu.”

Yi Qingxiang gave a bow and leaped up the stage.

Xu Yan said to Du Rufeng with clasped hands, “Elder Du, Qingxiang came late because he just so happened to reach the juncture of breakthrough, hope that you can understand.”

Du Rufeng gave a deep look at the Ye Yuan behind Xu Yan and said, “No worries, an hour isn’t up yet. Since he came, then this match officially starts.”

Yi Qingxiang looked at Wei Yunhui who had shock written all over his face and said with a faint smile, “You seem to be very surprised that I can come!”

Wei Yunhui’s expression was very ugly as he gritted his teeth and said, “Stop being smug! So what if you broke through? Your kind of Second Firmament Celestial Deity with an unstable foundation isn’t my match at all.”

Yi Qingxiang smiled and said, “Is that so? Then wouldn’t you know if you try?”

The confidence flowing from Yi Qingxiang’s body made Wei Yunhui’s heart pound.

Thinking about the previous match, he realized that the Yi Qingxiang at that time was simply like a different person compared to now.

Only by experiencing life and death that one could have a great awakening.

Once the battle started, Wei Yunhui could not laugh anymore.

The Yi Qingxiang after breaking through was not as deplorable as he said.

On the contrary, Yi Qingxiang’s suppression on him was all-round, not giving him any chance at all.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

After a while of stalemate, Wei Yunhui collapsed totally.

Yi Qingxiang beat Wei Yunhui move after move until he had no strength to retaliate in the slightest.

“I ... I admit defeat!”

Under heavy injuries, Wei Yunhui finally chose to admit defeat.

He achieved the pissing part, it was just that the one who had the piss beaten out of him was himself.

Completely defeating Wei Yunhui, Yi Qingxiang cast a grateful look toward Ye Yuan who was below the stage.

It was Ye Yuan who let him go through a nirvanic rebirth and gain a new lease of life.

Yi Qingxiang’s strength was peak First Firmament Celestial Deity in the first place. It was just that there was no way to break through this bottleneck within a short time.

Ye Yuan harbored a portion of guilt towards Yi Qingxiang, hence, he also refined a Jadethaw Purpleheart Pill for him.

Yi Qingxiang floated down, came in front of Bian Ziqiu, and said coolly, “You must be very disappointed that I can continue taking part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, right?”

Bian Ziqiu’s expression was not too good. Hearing Yi Qingxiang’s words, he could not help sneering as he said, “Don’t think that breaking through to become a Second Firmament Celestial Deity is impressive. Get on the stage once more, I’ll still beat you until you can’t find the north.”

Yi Qingxiang smiled faintly and said, “I didn’t say that I’m impressive. The impressive one is somebody else. After today, your High Clarity Sect’s people have to be more careful, because a certain someone ... is angry.”

Yi Qingxiang was very self-aware, he knew that even if he broke through to Second Firmament Celestial Deity, it was also impossible to be Bian Ziqiu’s match.

Bian Ziqiu was taken back when he heard that, pointed at Ye Yuan, and said, “You wouldn’t be talking about him, right? Hahaha, I really don’t know what you’re talking about! What the hell does his fury count for!”
