Chapter 1718 Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven

“Heh, this is your reliance? If you only have this bit of strength, you’re dead for sure!” Below the stage, Xiahou Yun sneered coldly.

In other people’s eyes, Ye Yuan’s strength was naturally powerful enough.

To be able to fight Song Tianqiang fiercely until now, his strength had indeed exceeded everyone’s expectations.

But in Xiahou Yun’s eyes, it was still not enough to look at.

“This Ye Yuan has such powerful fighting talent!”

“Yeah, his strength is still a notch weaker in the end. But by relying on the ingenious utilization of spatial law, he can actually fight on par with Song Tianqiang!”

“Newly-advanced to middle-stage fourth transformation golden body and he can fight to this extent. This situation is also one of a kind!”

...

Below the stage, the contestants all had solemn looks.

Ye Yuan’s strength far exceeded their imaginations.

The originally most unpromising actually became a large dark horse now. Even Song Tianqiang could not take him down.

In the ring, Song Tianqiang failed to win the drawn-out battle and became somewhat anxious in his heart.

“My opponent is Xiahou Yun, how can I possibly lose to this brat? Forget it, that move was originally left for Xiahou Yun, but I can only expose it in-advance now!”

Song Tianqiang made use of the counter-shock and pulled apart a certain distance from Ye Yuan.

All of a sudden, Song Tianqiang’s aura skyrocketed, his entire person becoming a bent bow.

Everyone’s faces changed. This move of Song Tianqiang’s had yet to release, but it already accumulated sufficient momentum.

One could imagine that the next attack would be a lightning-like blow!

“What a powerful attack! Dormant like a thunderbolt, this punch is incredible!”

“Looks like this is Song Tianqiang’s killing move! I’m afraid ... Ye Yuan is in danger!”

“That move of Ye Yuan’s, the power is sufficient to rival Fifth Firmament Divine Lords. It’s probably his limit already, right? The victor has already been decided!”

...

Song Tianqiang’s punch had yet to execute, but everyone could feel that this attack would be more than ten times the previous!

This kind of attack virtually stood at the apex of Fifth Firmament Divine Lord. It was also not far from a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord.

With Ye Yuan’s present strength, it was totally impossible to achieve it.

On the grandstands, when Jian Ping saw this scene, he was immediately greatly excited.

He had been staring at the sixth group’s ring all along. Seeing this astonishing attack at this time, he immediately saw hope.

If Song Tianqiang could directly kill Ye Yuan, it would also be a wonderful thing.

Finish him off!

Finish him off!

Jian Ping shouted in his heart!

“Ye Yuan, it’s you who forced me! This punch, I’ll see how you receive it! Galaxy Falling Heavenly Fist!”

Song Tianqiang shouted loudly, a punch rumbled out like a cannonball.

The violent world power turned into a white stream, akin to a galaxy dipping down!

That commotion was incomparably shocking.

But right at this time, an even stronger aura surged to the sky!

It was only to see blue patterns flashing in the midst of golden light on Ye Yuan’s body.

A dragon roar met it head-on, directly facing off with Song Tianqiang’s Galaxy Falling Heavenly Fist.

Everyone’s faces changed, their eyes revealing terror.

“This ... How is this possible?”

“What a powerful attack! It actually doesn’t lose to Song Tianqiang’s move!”

“This kid was actually still hiding such a powerful trump card! How did he do it?”

...

Such a powerful move had a tremendous burden on the physical body of body-cultivators.

Logically speaking, with Ye Yuan’s present fleshy body strength, it was completely insufficient to support such a powerful move.

However, Ye Yuan still managed it!

They did not know that with the blue patterns’ enhancement, Ye Yuan’s physical body was far stronger than it looked on the surface.

Universe Dragon Claw’s Second Stance, Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven!

Everyone could see an incomparably solid azure dragon brandishing its dragon claws, directly clawing toward that white stream! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Head-on confrontation!

Rumble!

The two attacks tussled in the air, neither giving in to the other, shaking until space was shuddering.

That powerful pressure even made all of the martial artists visibly change countenance.

Song Tianqiang’s complexion turned deathly pale and actually had a feeling of exhaustion!

Crack crack ... boom!

Finally, the azure dragon was so overwhelming that it could affect heaven and earth, crushing the white stream, emitting a heaven-shocking loud bang.

The azure dragon dissipated, Song Tianqiang’s body shot out backward, flying out of the ring powerlessly.

Ye Yuan won!

Everyone was rendered speechless with shock. This outcome was seriously too out of their expectations.

Even if Ye Yuan’s physical body possessed strength rivaling a Fourth Firmament Divine Lord, Song Tianqiang was a peak Fifth Firmament Divine Lord powerhouse.

Facing Fourth Firmament Divine Lords, he practically had the strength to insta-kill.

But such a powerful Song Tianqiang was actually defeated!

“I ... Are my eyes failing me?”

“I thought that in our group, the only one with the qualifications to challenge Xiahou Yun was Song Tianqiang. I didn’t expect that ... he was actually defeated!”

“No wonder! No wonder Ye Yuan dared to provoke Xiahou Yun. Turns out that ... he’s really impressive!”

...

Below the stage, the contestants all did not quite dare to believe such a result.

On the grandstands, Jian Ping’s expression was unbelievably ugly, gritting his teeth as he said, “Turns out that this is his true strength!”

At the same time, his back broke out into cold sweat.

He finally recalled, back then when Ye Yuan warned him, he said that if he was not a member of the Profound Secrets Pavilion, he would long be a dead man.

Turned out that it was not Ye Yuan talking big, but that he really had this strength!

Just based on this Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven move, it was sufficient for Ye Yuan to kill him!

In Xiahou Yun’s eyes, a look of surprise similarly appeared.

But it was merely a surprise.

This kind of strength could not threaten him yet.

The corners of Xiahou Yun’s mouth curled slightly as he said, “Heh, a little interesting! Seems ... even stronger than Jian Ping said! But if it’s merely like this, it’s still not enough!”

Fourth round started, but no one could have thought that the battle situation would actually be so fierce.

Ye Yuan and Song Tianqiang’s fight could be said to be the sixth group’s pinnacle battle already.

Of course, apart from Xiahou Yun.

If Xiahou Yun did not come out, who could contend?

This round, Xiahou Yun’s opponent still admitted defeat.

In the fifth round, the opponent still admitted defeat!

Xiahou Yun’s might virtually made people despair.

Fourth Firmament Divine Lords could not give rise to the desire to attack in front of him at all.

While Fifth Firmament Divine Lords were just those few. Xiahou Yun had not encountered one up until now.

Similar scenes were playing out in the second arena.

Jiang Nan who had very loud cheers from people previously, no one similarly dared to make a move against him.

Different from Xiahou Yun’s overbearingness, Jiang Nan standing there gave people a feeling of unassailableness.

Martial artists would find the other party’s flaws when fighting.

Each person would more or less have some flaws.

But they completely could not find Jiang Nan’s flaw!

This kind of might was all-round, not giving you the least bit of chance at all.

Jiang Nan had a helpless look and thought to himself, “So boring. Wonder when it can end and start the finals. What can excite me is also just Xiahou Yun, right? Destruction law, heh heh, really want to experience it!”

“Sixth round begins, Xiahou Yun versus Gao Shun!”

The judge’s voice came over, immediately making everyone look forward to it a little.

Gao Shun’s strength was not weaker than Song Tianqiang. If anyone could force Xiahou Yun to take action, it would be none other than him.

Of course ... now, there was an additional Ye Yuan.

Xiahou Yun still had that calm expression. Looking at Gao Shun, he said, “You want to attack?”

Gao Shun nodded and said, “I know that I’m not your match, but I want to seek advice from your destruction law!”
