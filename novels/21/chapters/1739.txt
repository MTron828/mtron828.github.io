Chapter 1743 Burning Paper

“Hahaha, what an arrogant punk! To dare to say such words at the Priest Temple, where do you place the elders in your mind?” Mu Yuanchun said with a cold laugh.

The Priest Temple’s elders, each one used countless years to accumulate strength.

Regardless of whether in the human race or demon race, being an alchemist was an extremely time-consuming profession, this was universally acknowledged.

But Ye Yuan uttered wild ravings right now!

These demon race’s young geniuses also pointed and gestured at Ye Yuan one by one, very scornful.

Not that Ye Yuan was arrogant, but that he wanted to borrow the Priest Temple’s power and influence, so he had to attract the Priest Temple’s high regard.

How could ordinary geniuses have the capital to speak?

Since that was the case, then he might as well be more high-profile and let the Priest Temple’s elders see his strength!

Uh ... Even though he could not talk about strength currently.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Don’t play this kind of word game anymore. Since it’s an assessment, it’s naturally using results to speak.”

The old man responsible for enrollment said in a solemn voice, “Young man, if I find out that you’re toying with the temple, you know the consequences!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Junior is naturally aware!”

The old man said, “What’s your name?”

“Ye Yuan!”

The old man nodded and threw a wooden plaque to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan caught the wooden plaque and lined up in the last place.

Among a group of demon race powerhouses, Ye Yuan appeared very different.

At this time, on the high platform above the temple, three old men appeared in succession, their auras astonishing.

These three old men were dressed in purple priest robes, five stars embroidered on their chest. They were shockingly five-star priests, also the Priest Temple’s elders!

The elder in the middle slowly opened his mouth and said, “Kong Lin, start!”

Kong Lin bowed to give a salute and said, “Yes, Master!”

Seeing this scene, the demons below were all incredibly envious.

Kong Lin went in front of the crowd and said in a clear voice, “The priest apprentice examination begins now. First round, fire control! I believe that everyone isn’t foreign to this round. There are three kinds of material papers, made from namely Goldsilk Divine Wood, Purple Fume Divine Incense Wood, Willow Cloud Wood. You all randomly pick one according to your own strength. As long as you don’t burn them down, it’s considered a pass! But I have to warn you guys, the choice of the paper, the elders will pay attention to them. This concerns your resources and status after entering the temple. Therefore, hope that you all bring out your greatest strength and display it for the elders to see! Each person has two chances, start now!”

Ye Yuan looked at the papers placed in front and his eyes involuntarily lit up.

These three divine words had different qualities and also different grades. The heat resistance of the paper refined was naturally different. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Using divine fire to burn paper, the fire-control requirements on the alchemist was exceedingly high.

A moment of carelessness and it would be burned to ashes.

One had to know, the terrifying temperature of rank four divine fire could virtually burn rank three martial artists to ashes, let alone a piece of paper as thin as cicada wings.

This level of test was indeed ingenious, but also very concise and clear, broadening Ye Yuan’s horizons too.

But fire control was too easy for him.

Under Kong Lin’s command, those demon race youths started to go up and undergo the assessment one by one. But what they picked were mostly paper made from Goldsilk Divine Wood.

These three wood types, Goldsilk Divine Wood was the strongest, Willow Cloud Wood the weakest.

So their choice was naturally the strongest. This way, it was not easy to burn it down.

Ye Yuan looked at these young geniuses’ fire control and could not help secretly shaking his head.

Too weak!

Although the demon race’s alchemy skills formed its own system, same as the fiend race, the demon race was still much more crude compared to the human race.

In this kind of delicate work, it was still a notch inferior.

But, these demon race alchemists were clearly much stronger than the fiend race’s.

“Goodness! Just a little bit more!”

“Don’t catch on fire! Don’t catch on fire! Goodness me!”

“Oh my goodness, why did it ignite again? My ten years of hard work are wasted again!”

...

There were hundreds of demon race geniuses in the great hall presently.

But the vast majority of the people were unable to even complete the Goldsilk Divine Wood’s test.

However, there were also some decent ones who completed the Goldsilk Divine Wood’s test.

There were even a few people who completed the Purple Fume Divine Incense Wood’s test!

“Next, Mu Yuanchun!” Kong Lin shouted.

Finally, it was Mu Yuanchun’s turn to take the field.

Mu Yuanchun shot Ye Yuan a proud smile and said, “Punk, open your eyes wider and take a look at this young master’s fire controlling skills!”

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not speak.

Mu Yuanchun felt like his punch landed on cotton and was very depressed.

He went up and directly came to the Willow Cloud Wood area, immediately causing a stir.

“My God, Mu Yuanchun actually wants to challenge Willow Cloud Wood. Is his strength already horrifying to this degree?”

“Heard that last season, Priest Kong Lin challenged the Willow Cloud Wood, it was incredibly astonishing back then!”

“Heh, what the hell do you know? I heard that Elder Stonefeather already internally decided him to be a personal disciple. If he doesn’t even have this bit of strength, how can he make it as one?”

...

To these young geniuses, the difficulty of the Willow Cloud Wood was extremely high.

Even some priest apprentices were unable to complete this challenge.

Those able to challenge successfully were all top geniuses among the demon race’s young alchemists.

After entering the Priest Temple, they would definitely be valued highly.

Just like Kong Lin, after he challenged the Willow Cloud Wood, he was taken in as a personal disciple by an elder, and became an official priest several years later!

One had to know, even if some people passed the test, they were unable to become true priests within several hundred years and were still just priest trainees.

Everyone held their breaths, looking at Mu Yuanchun.

Mu Yuanchun was clearly extremely confident. A faint-blue flame flashed out of his palm area, gentle like water.

That piece of Willow Cloud Wood paper suspended over the flame quietly, not moving a trace.

The light blue flame was akin to flowing water, slowly spreading below the paper, all the way until it extended to every corner of the paper.

When those young geniuses saw this scene, each and every one of their eyeballs popped out.

“What formidable fire control techniques, to actually not have the slightest hint of undulation!”

“I saw before Kong Lin’s fire controlling technique last season. Mu Yuanchun’s strength is absolutely not beneath his!”

“No wonder he could be internally decided as a personal disciple, this strength is really not for show.”

...

At the seats of honor, the three elders all nodded slightly, clearly very satisfied with Mu Yuanchun’s performance.

Even Ye Yuan also secretly nodded his head.

This Mu Yuanchun’s fire controlling technique was indeed praiseworthy.

Very soon, Mu Yuanchun withdrew his palm, the paper floated down onto his palm.

Kong Lin received it and took a look. Nodding his head, he smiled and said, “Temperature is well-distributed, without a hint of damage, pass! Junior Apprentice Brother Mu, we’ll likely become fellow disciples in the future!”

Mu Yuanchun bowed respectfully and said, “Yuanchun pays respect to Senior Apprentice Brother Kong Lin!”

Kong Lin smiled and said, “The two rounds at the back, you have to perform well too, Master is watching from above!”

Mu Yuanchun said respectfully, “Yes, Senior Apprentice Brother!”

Clearly, Mu Yuanchun already regarded himself as an elder’s disciple.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help being very surprised.

An empty hole invites wind, it was indeed like so!
