Chapter 2747: The Might of Heaven’s Chosen!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Outer-sect! Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses are merely just outer-sect disciples?”

“Could it be that what Younger Brother Ye said is true? This Labyrinth Divine Palace is actually powerful to this extent?”

“This so-called cultivation room is just fighting with these 100 people??Huhu,?what’s the use of such training?”

… …

Beyond the surprise, these Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses revealed disdainful looks very soon.

In their view, the outer-sect’s top 100 was nothing more than this.

On the Rainclear Continent, which of those capable of cultivating to Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm was not a peerless heaven’s chosen?

They examined their own conscience and felt that even if they were inferior to this Labyrinth Divine Palace, they absolutely would not be much worse either.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There are ten cultivation rooms here. Here is the number one cultivation room! The other nine are powerhouses from the top 1000 to 101st place in the history of the Labyrinth Divine Palace! Why not everyone try it out first?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud was the first to step out of the ranks and said with a smile, “Younger Brother Ye, your alchemy path strength is indeed unparalleled under the heavens! But I think that this Labyrinth Divine Palace’s cultivation room is also nothing more than this. If we can’t even win these people, then we can forget about muddling along. How about this? I’ll test out the strength of this 100th place first!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly. He did an inviting gesture.

Saint Exalt Waycloud assumed his responsibility too and went straight to the center of the cultivation room.

While the others sized it up with curious faces, looking at just how strong this so-called history’s top 100 was.

The moment Saint Exalt Waycloud’s footsteps stopped, the entire cultivation room seemed to suddenly come to life.

A figure stood with his hands behind his back and appeared in front of Saint Exalt Waycloud.

Saint Exalt Waycloud smiled confidently and said, “You’re the so-called hundredth place in history, Sun Qi? I think that it’s also merely so-so!”

The other party’s cultivation realm was identical with Saint Exalt Waycloud’s.

Sun Qi was merely an illusory figure. But, seeing Saint Exalt Waycloud, his brows furrowed and he said, “You’re too weak. This cultivation room isn’t suitable for you!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s expression turned cold when he heard that and he said disdainfully, “Punk, stop pretending to be capable! If you have the ability, win against this exalt before talking!”

Sun Qi shook his head slightly and he said, “The cultivation rooms don’t kill people. But, if you’re forcefully challenging the top 100, be prepared to get seriously injured!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud gave a cold snort, his body immediately erupting with a powerful pressure.

“Great Dipper Heaven Massacring Palm!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud roared, a palm striking until the void trembled.

The strength of a Saint Sovereign Heaven was displayed to the fullest expression of its beauty and form at this moment.

Saint Exalt Waycloud not being able to win Big Yellow did not mean that he was weak.

In reality, he could rank in the top five among lower Saint Sovereign Heavens!

It was also precisely because of his deterrent force that the Seven-star Heavenly Sect could become True Yang Heavenly Domain’s number one heavenly sect.

When Sun Qi saw the situation, he just shook his head slightly.

With one hand behind his back, his right hand formed his fingers as a sword and he pointed a finger out casually.

Pffft!

In just an instant, Sun Qi’s finger tapped onto Saint Exalt Waycloud’s chest.

Saint Exalt Waycloud spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly and flew out backward.

This finger already made him sustain heavy injuries.

“Too weak! With your measly strength, challenging the 1000th place isn’t enough either!” Sun Qi said and then disappeared.

The expressions of each and every one of the powerhouses present changed abruptly.

This Sun Qi was seriously too strong!

That finger earlier was too ordinary and insignificant. There wasn’t the slightest undulation at all.

Whatever Saint Sovereign Heaven pressure, whatever Great Dao power, none at all!

That finger was just like the most ordinary finger. It was as if it was tapped by a mortal.

But Saint Exalt Waycloud could not defend at all!

Such an attack method simply subverted their understanding.

“This is also too fake! How did he do it?”

“Is this the strength of the top 100? It’s simply instantly killing in the same rank!”

“This isn’t an ordinary instant kill! He doesn’t even have divine essence undulation!”

… …

The group of Saint Sovereign Heavens finally realized the unusual aspect of this cultivation room.

Even Ye Yuan’s complexion turned slightly white too.

That finger just now, if it was him, he could not stand up to it either.

Although there wasn’t the slightest divine essence undulation, this finger of Sun Qi’s already glimpsed the origin of Great Dao.

In front of him, Saint Exalt Waycloud’s attack was full of flaws from head to toe!

Formless, winning moves!

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s complexion was deathly pale, fresh blood spurting out of his mouth continuously.

This blow inflicted heavy wounds on him.

If the other party had the intention to kill, he would already be a corpse now.

The opponent was too strong!

At this time, Big Yellow suddenly spoke up, “Let me test it out!”

Ye Yuan did not stop him and said with a nod, “Who do you want to challenge?”

Big Yellow said, “The top 100 is too strong, I won’t be a match even if I cultivate another ten thousand years! Let me try challenging the 1000th place first!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and brought everyone to the tenth cultivation room. Inserting heavenly crystals, it lit the cultivation room up once again.

A hundred names appeared on the light screen once more.

The 1000th place, Wang Xiyun, was a woman.

Big Yellow chose Wang Xiyun’s name and stepped into the training ground.

With Big Yellow challenging someone, each and every one of the powerhouses present was waiting to see the battle.

Big Yellow’s strength was obvious to all.

Even if he faced off against a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, he was not without the power to fight either.

At Saint Sovereign Heaven this realm, he was already unbelievably strong to be able to jump realms and battle.

The projection of a beautiful woman appeared in front of everyone, looking harmless to man and beast.

She glanced at Big Yellow and said with a frown, “True spirit?”

Big Yellow was not long-winded either and said, “Please give guidance!”

Wang Xiyun nodded slightly, Big Yellow’s body started contorting.

The moment he made his move, it was the strongest Coquettish Profligate Hoof.

This posture made everyone want to burst out laughing, but they could not laugh.

Because they knew that this hoof was really very powerful!

The reason why Big Yellow overpowered the Saint Sovereign Heavens present was by relying on this hoof.

Wang Xiyun’s face had no changes in expression, as if indifferent to this hoof.

It was only to see her exquisite palm strike lightly. A powerful surge of rule power spewed out.

Bang!

Wang Xiyun did not move an inch and Big Yellow’s body flew out backward.

Just one palm and Big Yellow was already injured!

Big Yellow was thick and solid. He was indifferent after receiving this palm and kicked a hoof out again, clashing against Wang Xiyun.

Same as Sun Qi, Wang Xiyun did not erupt with too much power.

Everything was calm and collected.

But, each time Big Yellow clashed with Wang Xiyun’s palm, he would spit out a mouthful of fresh blood.

The powerhouses present watched until their faces looked deathly pale.

Big Yellow was an existence capable of jumping realms and fighting. But, in front of the 1000th place, he was unbelievably weak! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Furthermore, they could tell that Wang Xiyun was accommodating and tempering Big Yellow. Otherwise, Big Yellow would have been defeated long ago.

Bang!

Wang Xiyun saw a gap and pressed a palm on Big Yellow’s chest.

Big Yellow spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly and flew out backward.

This time, he no longer had the power to fight.

However, Big Yellow’s eyes became brighter.

Clearly, this battle had benefited him!

But the others were shocked.

“How can this Labyrinth Divine Palace be so strong? The 1000th place disciple, even Saint Exalt Big Yellow isn’t a match!”

“Looks like that Sun Qi previously probably didn’t use much strength at all to face-off with Saint Exalt Waycloud!”

“I somewhat believe Brother Ye’s words now!”

… …

The two battles made these Saint Sovereign Heavens realize that they were really too weak!
