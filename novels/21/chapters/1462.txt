Chapter 1466 Jealous of the Righteous and Envious of the Strong

Being a very long impregnable pass, Tiderain City was built against a mountain, very grand.

That city wall was just like a gate, keeping the fiend race great army out of the gates for millions of years.

The fiend race was warlike. Ever since the rise of Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang, this Tiderain City became one of the important battlegrounds of the human and fiend, two races. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Eminent Orchid Imperial City had once sent out several Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, attempting to take Tiderain City by storm.

River Eternal Imperial City’s side was not willing to show weakness either, similarly sending out several Divine Lord Realm powerhouses to deal with the enemy.

That battle fought until the heavens turned dark and the earth dimmed, virtually collapsing Tiderain City.

In the end, both sides sustained great losses.

Those dozen over Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were almost completely annihilated.

Ever since then, Eminent Orchid Imperial City did not dare to take Tiderain City by storm again but placed the focal points of the war along other lines.

In these several million years, Eminent Orchid Imperial City and River Eternal Imperial City both had victories and defeats, but neither could do anything to the other.

Because the other cities along the other borders were all exceedingly deep. Once the fiend race launched an attack, it was very easy to face enemies from the front and rear.

Even if they could occasionally defeat the humans, they would be repelled by the human race’s human wave tactic very soon too.

Only this Tiderain City that once breached, the fiend race army would be able to push forward unopposed, going straight for River Eternal Imperial City, was the most important.

Therefore, even after so many years, the fiend race had never given up on the idea of attacking Tiderain City.

Flying across the Fiend Calling Ridge was an ingenious military move. It could directly cross Tiderain City’s southern city wall, directly assaulting Tiderain City’s northern side.

In contrast to the southern city walls’ countless array formations reinforcing, the northern city walls were undoubtedly much weaker.

Once an army suddenly appeared from nowhere and the ambush worked, Tiderain City would surely be breached!

Along the way, Zhao Bin directly shook off the others, urging divine essence to the limits, rushing back to Tiderain City.

“Quickly open the city gates! Quickly open the city gates! I’m Zhao Bin under Centurion Zong Tao’s command, quickly open the city gates!” Zhao Bin shouted at the top of his voice, using all of his strength to shout at the city wall.

Creak ...

The city gates opened. Zhao Bin used all the strength in his body to rush in.

“Zhao Bin, why did you come back alone? Where are the rest? You’re flustered and panicky, what happened?” A figure came up to greet as he said rather unhappily.

Zhao Bin froze and said, “Centurion! Things are bad! The fiend race army used no idea what kind of method and are charging over from the Fiend Calling Ridge’s natural chasm that side!”

This person was precisely Zong Tao, Ling Feng’s squad’s centurion.

Under Zong Tao, Ling Feng’s strength was the strongest, his military achievements also the most impressive. He could break through to middle-stage Heaven Glimpse at any time and threaten the centurion position of Zong Tao’s.

Therefore, he had always been wary of Ling Feng.

Zhao Tao’s brows furrowed and he said, “What nonsense are you saying? How can the fiend race come over from that side?”

Zhao Bin said anxiously, “Lord Centurion, it’s absolutely true! We ran into five fiend race squads. Their captain said it personally!”

But Zong Tao still did not believe and said, “The fiend race is cunning, what they said, you believe it too? Also, if you all really encountered five squads, how did you escape?”

Zhao Bin could not help choking up as he said, “It might ... it might have been some passing-through human senior who saved us! Lord Centurion, what I said is absolutely true!”

Seeing that Zong Tao did not believe him, Zhao Bin was anxious until he was rent with restlessness.

He also knew that Zong Tao was not fond of their squad. It was just that he did not expect that the moment he entered the city gates, the person he met was Zong Tao.

Zong Tao frowned and said, “Fine, then I’ll ask you, how did the fiend race come over from the natural chasm? How many people in total came over? Who is leading the team?”

Zhao Bin utterly collapsed, how would he know?

“Lord Centurion, Captain has already gone to investigate the intel and might be able to rush back in a while! At that time, he’ll have detailed information to send back. But the military situation is urgent, this matter must be reported and request the great general to make a final decision!” Zhao Bin said.

But Zong Tao was relentless and said furiously, “Zhao Bin, are you done or not? You guys went to patrol and didn’t find any news, and came back to talk rubbish! What if this is a rumor deliberately spread by the fiends, intentionally baiting us to set up a defense at the northern city gates, but they storm in from the southern city gates? Who’ll shoulder this responsibility? Mn? You shoulder it or me?”

Zhao Bin was thoroughly deflated. He was rendered speechless by Zong Tao.

Putting it bluntly, Zong Tao did not want to bear this responsibility.

After all, it was not that incidents of the fiend race sneaking into the Fiend Calling Ridge this region never happened before.

Hence, the moment Zong Tao heard it, he felt that this was not reliable.

After all, crossing the natural chasm, this sort of thing, was too fantastical.

Plus, Zong Tao was biased against Ling Feng’s squad to begin with. He was even less willing to report this matter under the circumstances where there was no conclusive proof.

“What are you all arguing about? What happened?”

Just as Zhao Bin was at a loss on what to do, an awe-inspiring voice sounded out.

The moment Zong Tao heard, he hurriedly saluted and said, “Commander Wang, nothing much. This subordinate is too negligent in doing things, I was just lecturing him!”

Zhao Bin was just about to speak when Zong Tao shot him a fierce look. Clearly, he was threatening him.

Commander Wang nodded his head and said, “Mn, the patrol here is done, you all go to the southern city then. Recently, the fiend race had unusual activities. It seems like the army has already finished assembling and they are prepared to launch an attack on the southern city.”

Finished talking, Commander Wang was just about to turn around to leave.

Zhao Bin gritted his teeth and yelled out, “Lord Commander, this soldier has an important military intel to report!”

“Shut up! How dare you be insolent in front of Lord Commander?!”

Zong Tao did not think that this guy actually dared to disobey his orders and directly threw a kick over.

How could Zhao Bin be Zong Tao’s match? He was directly kicked flying by him with a foot, spouting out a mouthful of blood with a cough.

Commander Wang’s brows furrowed and he said, “What’s going on?”

Zong Tao was just about to speak, but Zhao Bin ignored his injuries and screamed at the top of his lungs: “The fiend race ... the fiend race passed through Fiend Calling Ridge’s natural moat and has already assembled a great army, wanting to ambush Tiderain City from the northern city!”

Zong Tao’s expression changed and he said, “Lord Commander, don’t listen to him talk rubbish! This matter is yet to be verified!”

Commander Wang’s expression similarly turned grim and he said in a solemn voice, “Just what the hell is the situation, let him finish!”

...

Ye Yuan two people made a long detour and finally slowly flew up the cliff.

Along the way, Ling Feng had a feeling like he was dreaming.

The Heavenspan World’s Deity Realm powerhouses were unable to fly at all. This feeling of suspending in the air was wondrous to the extreme.

He had never thought that he would actually be able to fly in the air one day.

“Younger Brother Ye, it’s really all thanks to you this time that I was snatched from the jaws of death! I, Old Ling, owe you a life!” Ling Feng said.

“Huhu, Captain Ling is too courteous. You all defend Tiderain City to the death, protecting millions of humans behind you, how many lives do they owe you? It’s precisely because there was your shedding of blood on the battlefield that the other people can live and work in peace,” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

Ling Feng’s face blushed from what Ye Yuan said, somewhat embarrassed.

Under the pressure of the fiend race, they had no choice but to resist.

Not resisting was death!

“Younger Brother, Ye, what should we do now?”

Ling Feng unknowingly already relied on Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was able and resourceful, bold and meticulous. He actually had a sense of security beside Ye Yuan[1].

A hint of a smile flashed across Ye Yuan’s mouth and he said, “Our way back has probably already been cut off! Why not ... we deal a thrust to the back, how’s that?”
