Chapter 1339: Above the Heavenspan Mountain!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In front of Ye Yuan were divine rank spirit medicines piled like a mountain.

When refining the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill back then, it was a focused practice.

All of the medicinal pills he refined was all for the sake of finally refining the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill.

And now, Ye Yuan was going to cultivate initial-rank One-star Alchemy God to the limits!

In this aspect, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s powerful supply system became apparent.

Under Ye Yuan’s request, Yang Rui found a lot of very obscure divine rank spirit medicines.

Now, the spirit medicines piled in front of him were as many as several thousand kinds.

Of course, this was not all of Heavenspan World’s Tier 1 divine rank spirit medicine type.

Ye Yuan also did not require all Tier 1 divine rank spirit medicines. He only needed an opportunity, an opportunity to comprehend Heavenly Dao!

After the first decade, Ye Yuan started a long process of comprehending Alchemy Dao.

Every kind of spirit medicines, he would experience it diligently, comprehending their medicinal properties.

This task, Ye Yuan had once done before in the Immortal Grove World. Doing it now was not unfamiliar.

It was just that the difficulty increased countless times.

Time passed inside the World Suppressing Stele, in a blink, 120 years passed.

In these 120 years, Ye Yuan finally fully comprehended the several thousand kinds of spirit medicines’ medicinal properties.

Ye Yuan’s path of alchemy was summed up into just five words: A solid foundation, diligent practice!

Expending 120 years and pouring all of their heart and soul into comprehending medicinal properties, this was an exceedingly dreary thing to others.

Even for alchemists, not many were able to withstand such loneliness either.

Ye Yuan could!

These 120 years laid down Ye Yuan’s foundation of refining divine pills very solidly.

After 120 years, Ye Yuan finally started refining pills.

He refined pills differently from others; he was doing it carefree and unrestrained, and not rigidly bound to pill formulas.

There were successes, there were failures.

This kind of incomparably dreary life, Ye Yuan consumed it pleasantly as if taking sugarplums.

Spring went and autumn arrived, summer left and winter came. Time passed year after year.

Finally, one day, a hint of insight flashed across in Ye Yuan’s mind. This trace of understanding was like a bolt of lightning that tore across the sky.

Hence, he put down the pill refining and started visualizing the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain in front of him!

The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain that had no activities all along emitted a blinding light at this time.

These lights were resplendent with a myriad of colors, beautiful and magnificent.

Ye Yuan, who was inside of it, was akin to have fallen into a wonderland.

He finally knocked open this door using Alchemy Dao!

However, this was just the first step to Ye Yuan. He did not want to create a cultivation method used for refining pills.

All along, Ye Yuan cultivated all sorts of cultivation methods, martial techniques. They started rolling around in his mind non-stop.

Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art, Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art, Evil Extermination Sword Formula, Nine Characters True Word Formula ...

The current Ye Yuan was just like cooking a delicious dish.

These cultivation methods and martial techniques were the ingredients, while the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was a large pot.

Ye Yuan was immersed inside, completely forgetting the time.

No idea how long had passed either, the elementary form of a cultivation method gradually formed in Ye Yuan’s mind.

Ye Yuan revised it continuously, perfecting, then revising again and perfecting again.

...

At this moment, at the center of the Heavenspan World, all martial artists’ holy land —- Heavenspan Mountain, it suddenly became incomparably berserk.

A tsunami-like spiritual energy flooded down from the top of the Heavenspan Mountain.

This wave of spiritual energy was too boundless, unable to absorb at all.

The tremendous impact force directly sent the powerhouses currently comprehending Dao on the Heavenspan Mountain flying, miserable cries lingering on incessantly in the air.

No matter how powerful their strength was!

This was the true heaven and earth’s might, not what human power could contend with at all.

An incomparably gorgeous afterglow light halo wrapped around the entire Heavenspan Mountain, making the originally mysterious Heavenspan Mountain become even more unfathomable.

After several breaths, the Heavenspan Mountain was already devoid of people.

“This ... What happened to the Heavenspan Mountain?”

“Who the hell knows what happened? Ouch, your father cultivated to the True God Realm and has never fallen so badly before!”

“Truly inconceivable! I’ve never seen before that the Heavenspan Mountain would actually give off such a terrifying Heaven’s prestige!”

...

Below the Heavenspan Mountain, numerous groups of martial artists had fallen into a disorderly mess, looking very wretched.

But what they were even more astonished at was why the Heavenspan Mountain had such a change appear.

“Not good! The spiritual energy is flooding down! Quick, run!”

Suddenly, someone gave a shout. Everyone all kicked off the ground and sprinted wildly.

This incomparably majestic spiritual energy descended from the sky like an avalanche. Once buried within the spiritual energy, they would lose a layer of skin even if they did not die.

They had never seen before such terrifying spiritual energy!

Rumble ... !

The spiritual energy hit the ground, gave off a massive rumble, and rippled out into the distance.

“H-Hahaha, I’m going to break through! I’ve been stuck at the bottleneck for several tens of thousands of years already. This time, I’m finally going to break through!”

“I’m going to break through too! Hahaha ...”

“Didn’t expect that there will come a day when I break through to True God too! Hahaha ...”

... ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After the spiritual energy landed, it finally became thinner.

Under the impact of this majestic spiritual energy, the martial artists cultivating on the Heavenspan Mountain obtained a blessing in disguise. Quite a number of people break through the bottleneck.

Those who did not break through the bottleneck, their power also increased by a great deal.

“Not good! Can’t break through now! Another wave of spiritual energy is rushing down!” right at this time, somebody shouted again.

It was only to see on top of the Heavenspan Mountain, the nearly materialized spiritual energy poured down like an avalanche once more.

...

At this time, above the void where everyone could not see, several voices were communicating something.

“Life, among the few of us, you lived the longest. Can you tell us what on earth is going on?” a deep voice said.

“Don’t know! Since this old man attained Dao, I’ve never seen before such a violent Heavenspan Mountain!” an aged voice said.

The moment these words came out, everyone fell silent once more.

Suddenly, someone said, “Hang on, the feeling that the Heavenspan Mountain gives me this time ... is like it’s celebrating something!”

“Celebrating? Haha, Thunder Ancestor, are you joking? The Heavenspan Mountain is a dead object. Even though it contains the might of Heavenly Dao, how can it be possible to have human emotions? Hahaha ... this old man has no choice but to be in awe of your wild fantasies!” retorted another person immediately.

At this time, Dao Ancestor Life suddenly opened his mouth again and said, “I feel that what Thunder Ancestor said makes some sense! You all look. This is the third wave of spiritual energy avalanche already! Once such boundless spiritual energy spreads out, who knows how many people will benefit and break through! The feeling that this gives me ... is like benefiting all life!”

Dao Ancestor Life’s words made everyone fall silent once more.

“But ... even if it’s as you said, even you haven’t seen the Heavenspan Mountain like this before. Why would it suddenly become like this?” someone else questioned.

Dao Ancestor Life slowly said, “That’s because the Heavenspan Mountain has never encountered somebody or something that’s worthy of it doing so! However ... apart from the few of us, who else is worthy of it doing so?”

Another round of silence.

After a long time, Dao Ancestor Life raised his head up and gave a long sigh, and he said, “Heavenspan Mountain, oh Heavenspan Mountain, just what kind of existence are you? Just what is there above the mountain summit?”
