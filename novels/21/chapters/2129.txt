Chapter 2133: Don’t Make a Spectacle of Yourself!

Long Yu’s expression flickered incessantly, his face struggling.

Right at this time, a figure slowly walked out of the void.

Seeing the arrival, Long Yu seemed to have grasped a life-saving straw and said with surprise, “Father!”

The arrival was precisely Heavenly Emperor Long Chi!

Heavenly Emperor Long Chi looked at Ye Yuan, his gaze icy-cold.

People should not look at how East Suppression Pseudo World had countless dragons. It was through the propagation of countless generations in the past that there was today’s scale.

But even so, the scale of this stronghold was still much smaller compared to human cities.

In reality, the propagation of the dragon race compared to humans, or even ordinary demon races, was much harder.

Hence, regardless of whether it was Long Chi or Long Yu, they valued Long Hao this descendant very highly.

Now, he actually died in Ye Yuan’s hands. So how could these two people not be furious?

“He’s of the dragon race!” Heavenly Emperor Long Chi said coolly.

Everyone was taken aback, not knowing what Heavenly Emperor Long Chi’s words meant.

Long Zhi seemed to have thought of something, his expression changing as he said, “Long Chi, what do you want?”

Long Zhi had already reported to the clan about Ye Yuan’s matter. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Similarly a protector elder, Long Zhi was naturally aware of Ye Yuan’s real identity.

Long Chi said coolly, “Since he’s of the dragon race, then it naturally has to be taken care of according to the Dragon Clan’s rules.”

Long Zhi’s two eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a deep voice, “Long Chi! Do you want to plunge the Dragon Clan into the fires of war?”

“Long Zhi, a ‘divine war’, two words, scared you until like this? Our Dragon Clan looks down upon the heavens and myriad realms! When did we become so cowardly and weak?”

“Then we also can’t plunge the Dragon Clan into war because of your grandson! Could it be that a mere Long Hao is even more important than the entire Dragon Clan?”

Long Chi mused for a moment and opened his mouth and said, “Since that’s the case, have an elders’ meeting then! This emperor won’t let this matter go.”

Done talking, Long Chi turned around and left.

The Dragon Clan’s people all had dumbfounded gazes and their mouths gaping. They all thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure. In the end, Empyrean Long Yu did not kill him. Heavenly Emperor Long Chi came and also did not kill him.

This was really a historical first in Raindragon Stronghold.

But everyone was also clear in their hearts that once this matter was brought up to the elders’ association, it would likely not end well.

Long Zhi looked at Ye Yuan, his face angry from failure to live up to expectations as he said, “You, this fellow, can really cause trouble!”

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “Nothing to do with me. It was them who provoked me first!”

Explaining the matter in a few words, Long Zhi was also speechless.

This Long Hao could have provoked anyone, but he provoked this malefic star. So it served him right to be killed.

Ye Yuan did not care that the person was a protector elder’s grandson. Provoking him, one would have to be prepared to suffer his wrath.

This guy did not shrink back in the slightest when facing a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse too. Why would he pay attention to the consequences of killing a puny little Long Hao?

Back then, he suppressed Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun and the Qilin Clan to all kneel down with his power alone, and he completely disregarded the consequences!

“Sigh! You’re satisfied with killing someone, but this place isn’t the outside world’s demon race after all! Long Chi isn’t willing to drop this matter, so he’ll definitely think of ways to put you to death!” Long Zhi said with a sigh.

“When soldiers come, use a general to hold them off. When the water rises, use dirt to keep it back. Scared of him for what?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

At this time, Lu-er and Yang Fei-er also moved closer.

Lu-er said with an aggrieved look, “Young Master, it was all Lu-er’s fault, provoking trouble for you.”

Ye Yuan smiled dotingly and said, “Where did you provoke trouble? It was trouble that provoked you. That’s all. In this world, there are always some people who act recklessly and blindly.”

Lu-er said anxiously, “But ...”

“There are no buts. Do you still not know your young master’s ability?” Ye Yuan directly cut off.

... ...

Under Long Zhi’s lead, Ye Yuan entered a stone house.

Upon entering the stone house, he entered another space.

Above the void, five enormous dragons were circling around above, giving people immensely powerful deterrence force.

“Deliberately making things mystifying!” Ye Yuan had a look of disdain and slowly walked into space.

The leftmost giant dragon opened his mouth and said, “Ye Yuan, since you’re of the dragon race, why haven’t you knelt when you see us!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Making me kneel, also can. As long as you can overpower me with bloodline power.”

No need to guess, this giant dragon was naturally Long Chi without a doubt.

Ye Yuan naturally did not have a good opinion of this Long Chi.

Being able to bring up Long Hao that kind of grandson, how good could this fellow be?

Sure enough, the moment he opened his mouth, Ye Yuan felt that overbearing tone.

Most likely, this guy was also talked like this normal.

“Snort! You’re the one who said it! Kneel down!”

Long Chi gave a cold snort. A powerful true dragon bloodline power pressed down on Ye Yuan akin to a giant mountain.

Although he knew that Ye Yuan definitely had reliance, what kind of existence was he, Long Chi? Why would he care about a puny little rank six dragon’s pride?

As a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, his bloodline was incomparably pure, already evolving to a kind of peak of the dragon race.

How could a mere Ye Yuan resist his suppression?

It was just that when the Long Zhi beside Ye Yuan saw this scene, his face revealed a strange look.

When he reported to the clan, it was naturally impossible to cover all details no matter how trivial.

These elders knew that Ye Yuan was of the dragon race, but they did not know how pure Ye Yuan’s dragon race bloodline was.

Being able to contend with Sacred Ancestor High Priest, that level of existence, with true dragon will, would Ye Yuan’s bloodline power be of the common sort?

The strength of bloodline power was unrelated to cultivation realm. As long as bloodline was pure enough, even if it was a powerful peak Heavenly Emperor existence, a weakling could also resist.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh. The dragon race bloodline pressure in his body suddenly bloomed.

An astonishing aura soared to the sky, pressing right up against Long Chi’s pressure.

Bang!

Two great pressures colliding suddenly, it caused the void to tremble.

Long Chi’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Impossible! How can your bloodline power be so strong?”

A hint of ridicule flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and he said coolly, “This is your bloodline power? Looks like your potential has already been pretty much exhausted!”

With one exchange, Ye Yuan sensed the strength of Long Chi’s bloodline.

For him to be able to cultivate to his present realm, he basically reached the end already.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s words clearly poked Long Chi’s sore spot.

Ye Yuan clearly saw the corners of the giant dragon’s mouth twitch, clearly being greatly enraged.

Above the void, Long Chi roared angrily and said, “Gentlemen, this boy is too arrogant, showing no respect to his elders! Everybody, attacking together to suppress!”

Long Chi could not deal with Ye Yuan by himself and actually shamelessly invited the rest to take action.

The few people were just about to make a move, but they then heard Long Zhi said coolly, “Stop making a spectacle of yourselves! Even counting Dragon Lord in, it’s also impossible to suppress Ye Yuan!”

“What? This is impossible!”

“How can this be possible? I don’t believe it!”

“Long Zhi, what nonsense are you talking about?”

... ...

The few great protector elders clearly did not believe Long Zhi’s words, having shocked expressions on their faces.

Six great heavenly emperors making a move at the same time actually could not suppress a measly little rank six dragon?

Long Zhi laughed in spite of himself and said, “Talking nonsense? That’s because you all didn’t see how he solved Ask Not! He defeated Medicine Ancestor with a sword of will, forcefully resisted Sacred Ancestor High Priest with his true dragon will, and shattered the firmament with his qilin will, breaking the world that Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor, two people, created! Do you guys think that you’re stronger than Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest?”
