Chapter 2292: Fishing

Ye Yuan stayed at Feather Mountain, going into a retreat to digest the gains of these few days.

Exchanging the things he learned with a leading authority figure like Wing, he had to admit, it was a mentally and physically exhausting thing to do.

Even with Ye Yuan’s abilities, digesting it was absolutely not an easy thing too.

After Heavenly Emperor Justbright entered Cloudheart Realm, he brought Old Drunkard to go to Cloudheart City to collect spirit medicines.

Cloudheart City was the host of the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time, the spirit medicines gathered were countless.

Rank eight spirit medicines were not common wares found on the streets. Even in Cloudheart Realm, one could not buy it as they wished either.

Furthermore, Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill’s spirit medicines also belonged to the high-end existence among rank eight spirit medicines. Wanting to purchase them naturally needed to expend a lot of effort.

Old Drunkard coming to this kind of sacred place, he naturally wanted to experience it. Hence, he went with Justbright.

Half a month later, Ye Yuan exited seclusion and had an even deeper comprehension of Great Dao source.

However, there were many things comprehended this time that were too profound. Ye Yuan was also unable to fully understand them for the time being and could only save it for later to slowly digest.

The Dao debate this time also let Ye Yuan have a clear understanding of the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor, these existences’ strength.

Their strength in alchemy indeed made people feel like they were beholding a great mountain.

“Ye Yuan, Senior Justbright and Old Drunkard have already been gone for more than a month, and haven’t returned until now. Something wouldn’t have happened, right?” Baili Qingyan said worriedly.

Ye Yuan had a strange look and said, “Haven’t come back until now? Something might have really happened! But you rest assured, they know that Justbright and Old Drunkard are my people. So they won’t harm their lives.”

The voice had yet to fade when a voice sounded out outside.

“Great Melancholy Realm’s Longwinter requests an audience with Second Sage!”

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “You see, didn’t it come? Reckon that somebody can’t stand the loneliness, and wants to challenge me.”

Baili Qingyan’s beautiful eyes flickered, the pride in her heart rising.

This was the man that she fancied, a man who was already standing on the summit of this Heavenspan World!

When Heavenly Emperor Longwinter saw Ye Yuan, he felt surprised in his heart.

He did not expect that the Second Sage whose fame shook the alchemy world was actually so young.

But very soon, his heart settled down.

Such a young little fellow, how could he possibly be his young master’s match?

It seemed like the outside world’s rumors about how the Second Sage was were mostly biased.

Thinking up to here, his awe toward Second Sage this title immediately lessened significantly.

“Finding me for?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Longwinter stood with his hands behind his back and said coolly, “Longwinter is passing on a message on behalf of Young Master, my family’s young master is Great Melancholy Realm’s Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian’s disciple, Zhao Zixuan. I believe Second Sage must have heard of him.”

Ye Yuan said puzzledly, “Very sorry, I really never heard of him before. Uh ... is Great Melancholy Realm’s Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian very famous?”

Longwinter was stunned. He then immediately became greatly enraged and said in a solemn voice, “Our Great Melancholy Realm is the Heavenspan World’s alchemy holy land that ranks at the top of the list, and yet you actually pretend that you haven’t heard of it?! With what you said, this emperor can take it that you’re provoking the Great Melancholy Realm!”

Ye Yuan spread his two hands out and said speechlessly, “Never heard before means never heard before. You can’t have me pretend to have heard of it, right?”

He really never heard of Great Melancholy Realm before. Even Cloudheart Realm, he only heard of it recently too.

As for whatever Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian, he naturally had not heard of him before.

Ever since entering the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan’s understanding of the alchemy world was limited to the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

He really never paid much attention to other alchemy holy lands.

Heavenly Emperor Longwinter said in a great rage, “Very good! Second Sage’s words, Longwinter will definitely bring it and let Lord Yi Xian know!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said indifferently, “Up to you. So you’re here finding me for?”

Longwinter said with a gloomy look, “Second Sage’s two followers bumped into my family’s young master in the city and have already been detained by us! If Second Sage wishes to redeem them, please personally make a trip to Cloudheart City!”

Longwinter originally thought that Ye Yuan would be furious after hearing it and accuse him. Who would have thought that Ye Yuan just nonchalantly gave an ‘oh,’ and he then said, “Let’s go then.”

Finished talking, he already went out of the door.

Longwinter discovered that it turned out the whole lot of excuses that he prepared were completely useless.

Ye Yuan was after all the Sacrificial Temple’s Second Sage, his status being equivalent to the various holy land’s number two figure. He was extraordinary.

If they wanted to find trouble with Ye Yuan, they naturally had to do their homework.

But who knew that this guy did not play his cards according to the normal style at all, making him have a feeling of punching on empty space.

Longwinter only came back to his senses after a while and hurriedly followed after.

... . .

“Blind thing! Our spirit medicines, you also dare to snatch them? Beat! Beat viciously for me! Lowly lackey, not hitting you, you won’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!” Zhao Zixuan said viscously.

By the side, a handsome young man said, “Huhu, Brother Zixuan, what are you being angry with two lowly lackeys for? After their master comes, let’s seek out justice again.”

Another young man said, “Really didn’t expect that Second Sage’s fame is so great, but he actually can’t manage his subordinates! What a disgrace!”

... ...

In the busy city, Heavenly Emperor Justbright and Old Drunkard were hung upside down on a stand, their bodies full of whip marks, looking very wretched.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, his brows furrowed slightly.

These two people’s lives were naturally unharmed. But doing so was clearly humiliating him, slapping his face.

Although Heavenly Emperor Justbright was powerful, how could Great Melancholy Realm this sort of top holy land lack Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouses?

Heavenly Emperor Longwinter himself was a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor mighty expert.

Longwinter came before Zhao Zixuan and said with a bow, “Young Master, Second Sage is here.”

The few young men looked towards Ye Yuan one after another. Seeing Ye Yuan’s young face, they felt contempt in their hearts.

“This is the famous Second Sage? Huhu, these two subordinates of yours are too unruly, the Heavenly Sunflower that this young master took fancy on, they actually dared to snatch! This young master didn’t give and they actually even dared to insult me with words. No choice. This young master can only help you to discipline them,” Zhao Zixuan looked at Ye Yuan and said with a chuckle.

When Heavenly Emperor Justbright saw Ye Yuan, he had an abashed look.

The Heavenly Sunflower was a core ingredient of the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill. He walked all over Cloudheart City and finally found it in a medicinal store.

But as soon as he went in, the Heavenly Sunflower just happened to be bought by Zhao Zixuan and co.

He was anxious in his heart and hurriedly found Zhao Zixuan and company, wanting to buy it over.

Zhao Zixuan and company were very disdainful toward Heavenly Emperor Justbright with their words. The intent of provocation was very thick.

However, Heavenly Emperor Justbright saw that Zhao Zixuan and company were not strong. Plus, the clothes they were wearing were not overly garish, hence, he underestimated them. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

With a few exchanges, Heavenly Emperor Justbright suddenly became greatly enraged and was about to take care of Zhao Zixuan few people.

Who knew that at this time, several formidable powerhouses suddenly jumped out, restraining him all at once.

Only then did Zhao Zixuan and the rest reveal their identities, scaring Heavenly Emperor Justbright out of his wits.

Each one of these few people actually all had great backgrounds, they were the Heavenspan World’s top alchemy holy lands’ disciples.

No matter how stupid he was, he also understood.

He was fished!

These few fellows pretended to be a pig in order to eat a tiger, intentionally baiting him. No wonder he traveled all over Cloudheart City and still could not purchase the Heavenly Sunflower.
