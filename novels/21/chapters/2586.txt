Chapter 2592: Astonishing Ultimate Move!

“Alright, the Worrisome Heart Callousness in your body has already been completely cured,” Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said.

The poison of Worrisome Heart Callousness was rather formidable. Ye Yuan needed to expend considerable effort to cure the poison too.

Wen Jingxuan looked at Ye Yuan with a grateful look.

If not for Ye Yuan, she really did not dare to imagine the consequences.

She got up and bowed towards Ye Yuan with folded hands at the lower right side and said gratefully, “Jingxuan thanks Elder Ye!”

“Mn??What did you call me?”

“M-Master!” Hesitating for a moment, Wen Jingxuan finally called.

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and said coolly, “I, Ye Yuan, have only taken the initiative to accept a disciple just this once walking all this way! However, I don’t like to force things! There’s only this one chance. So you have to think about it well!”

He knew that Wen Jingxuan could not get over this in her heart.

However, where did he, Ye Yuan, this person come from? How could he thicken his skin and beg people to acknowledge him as her master?

If Wen Jingxuan was willing, that was fine. If she was not willing, it was okay too.

He only gave this one chance.

Miss it, means she missed it!

Sure enough, Wen Jingxuan’s expression changed and she hurriedly said, “T-This disciple knows that I’m wrong!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “This isn’t your fault, but I, Ye Yuan, have always been extremely strict in accepting disciples. If not looking on the account that your talent is really pretty good, I wouldn’t have cared about your affairs!”

Wen Jingxuan’s expression was sad as she said, “Many thanks, Master!”

Ye Yuan gave her a glance and did not say much.

Some roads needed one to walk themselves.

And right at this time, there was a commotion coming from outside.

“Elder Ye, you come out for me! I, Wu Chengchao, am not convinced and want to seek justice! This old man is a dignified grade three heavenly alchemist, and yet you’re making Your Father refine Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills day in and day out! What the hell is this?”

“Even if Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is cultivated to the acme of perfection, what the hell use is it?”

“We’re not convinced! What right does a grade one heavenly alchemist have to be an elder?”

… …

The moment Ye Yuan went out to take a look, he saw Wu Chengchao taking the lead in causing trouble.

A group of grade two heavenly alchemists also followed behind to make a fuss.

These were all the backbone people of the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s alchemy path.

Although it was a little weak.

Ever since Qin Shun left, Ye Yuan took over the Alchemist Hall.

And the first thing that he did when he took office was to have everyone re-learn the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill from the top again.

Lin Lan was everyone’s head coach. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was just that this order was only carried out for two days, and Wu Chengchao and the rest took the lead to make trouble.

Although Ye Yuan’s performance before was very astonishing, to make them, these grade two and grade three heavenly alchemists go and practice the most basic Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, this was simply the biggest joke in the world.

How could they be willing?

Among them, Wu Chengchao especially made the biggest clamor.

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept over everyone’s faces and he said with a frown, “Where’s Lin Lan?”

The voices abruptly stopped!

“Master!” And at this time, a voice sounded out behind everyone.

Ye Yuan looked over, who could it be if not Lin Lan?

It was just that he was covered in wounds all over his body. Clearly, he had suffered considerable injuries.

Ye Yuan’s eyes turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “Who did it?”

Everyone exchanged glances, no one said anything.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he sneered and said, “Looks like you all see that my cultivation realm is low and aren’t convinced of me taking on the position of elder!”

Wu Chengchao said, “It’s not that we’re not convinced! It’s just that this guy used a made-up directive and forced us to re-cultivate the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill every day. What the hell is with that? It can’t be that refining the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill can make one break through to grade four heavenly alchemist?”

Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes at Wu Chengchao and he said with a sneer, “So, you made a move to injure this elder’s disciple?”

Ye Yuan looked straight at Wu Chengchao, Wu Chengchao also met eyes with Ye Yuan.

But very soon, Wu Chengchao avoided Ye Yuan’s gaze.

He could not withstand Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum!

Wu Chengchao was shocked in his heart, he actually lost to a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

“I-I didn’t do it alone!” Wu Chengchao said awkwardly.

“Jingxuan!” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Wen Jingxuan was taken aback and hurriedly said, “This disciple is here!”

Everyone was uncertain what it meant, turning their gazes toward Wen Jingxuan.

Ye Yuan turned to her and said with a smile, “Your talent is pretty good, your affinity reaching an astonishing 59 points! Then do you want to improve further?”

Wen Jingxuan was taken aback again and immediately said with wild elation, “Master, c-can I?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I say can, of course you can!”

Hearing this, everyone trembled all over!

Affinity!

Elder Ye was finally releasing his big move!

They all knew that Elder Ye was able to become this elder by relying completely on this ultimate move!

A means that could increase affinity was seriously too attractive.

The significance of this move was extraordinary!

Even Wu Chengchao could not resist swallowing his saliva.

No one would mind affinity being too high!

Maybe if their affinity increased by one point, their strength would increase by ten!

“Many thanks, Master!” Wen Jingxuan said agitatedly.

The haze on her face was swept clean and what replaced it was a face full of excitement.

The allure of increasing affinity was too great!

She could not resist it!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’re my disciple. So your treatment is naturally different from the rest!”

As he said, he held his palm out and took out a medicinal pill.

When Wen Jingxuan saw the medicinal pill, the expression on her face could not help becoming stupefied as she blurted out, “F-Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill?”

“Can Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill increase affinity?”

“Elder Ye, you’re joking, right?”

“Sect Master let you be this elder because he pinned high hopes on you. Yet, you’re showing us this?”

… …

Ye Yuan actually taking out the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill immediately aroused mass ridicule.

They had never heard that the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill could increase affinity!

Wasn’t this a joke?

“Fetch the pre-natal cloud stone,” Ye Yuan instructed.

Wen Jingxuan suppressed the curiosity in her heart and fetched the pre-natal cloud stone.

“Test your affinity!” Ye Yuan instructed again.

Wen Jingxuan followed suit and placed her palm on the pre-natal cloud stone.

Very soon, the scale marks on the pre-natal cloud stone reached 59 points!

Although everyone already knew this result, having witnessed it again, they were still incredibly envious.

This number was something that they would have to look up to all their lives!

However, with regards to Ye Yuan’s way of doing things, they all turned their noses up in disdain.

If the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill could increase affinity, would it still be your, Ye Yuan’s, turn, to come and discover it?”

“Eat it and refine it on the spot.” Ye Yuan repeatedly instructed.

Wen Jingxuan did not hesitate, directly swallowing this ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

Very soon, Wen Jingxuan seemed to have been reborn, her entire person becoming much graceful.

A stench came over, her body and marrow had actually been cleansed!

Seeing this scene, everyone could not help being extremely surprised.

The Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill still had this effect?

Finished refining, Wen Jingxuan only felt that her entire body was indescribably comfortable, and she said excitedly, “Master, this Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill actually has such a miraculous effect?”

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “Go and test again!”

Wen Jingxuan followed suit and placed her palm on the pre-natal cloud stone again!

Although they felt that it was impossible for a miracle to happen, everyone still held their breaths, staring at the pre-natal cloud stone without blinking.

Very soon, the scales reached 59.

But this time, it did not stop at 59!
