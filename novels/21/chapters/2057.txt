Chapter 2061: Admitting Defeat, One Should Have the Manner of Admitting Defeat!!

It was naturally impossible for the seven great ancient families to help the Myriad Treasure Tower for no reason.

These ancient families did not emerge and did not take part in the conflicts of the world.

Since they took part, it was naturally that something that moved them had appeared.

And this thing was the pill formulas in Ye Yuan’s hands!

Prior to this, Ye Yuan already reached a consensus with the seven great families. As long as the Southern Border Alliance lowered their heads, he was willing to distribute the pill formulas to the seven great ancient families. Each ancient family would get two pill formulas.

Of course, Ye Yuan would not treat Empyrean Chaoyuan shabbily either.

Beitang carefully put away the pill formula, an appearance of having obtained a priceless treasure.

The pill formulas of these conventional medicinal pills could maintain a major family’s long-term prosperity!

How could he, Beitang Li, not be careful?

“Heh, Little Friend Ye is indeed trustworthy! Before I made this trip, Family Head already said that in the future, you’re my Beitang Family’s retainer elder. You keep this token well. If anyone dares to be disrespectful to Little Friend Ye, that’s becoming enemies with my Beitang Ancient Family!”

Done talking, Beitang Li did not care about whether Ye Yuan agreed or not either, directly shoving the token into Ye Yuan’s hand.

The other ancient families’ representatives all secretly regretted endlessly, the Beitang Family was a little too shrewd.

While they could also invite Ye Yuan to be a retainer elder, how could it be as valuable as the Beitang Family who shoved the token first?

But they still made promises, saying that the token will be delivered very soon.

Ye Yuan was helpless and could only accept one by one.

Ye Yuan was not something who did not appreciate favors. Since people showed a warm attitude, he would not snub them.

Furthermore, these reclusive families’ strength was not overt. According to what Empyrean Flutterfeather said, each one of these families was very powerful.

Since that was the case, wouldn’t Ye Yuan finding a few reliable allies for Heavenly Eagle be a good thing?

Obtaining the pill formulas and getting the Dreamlike Wine, Beitang and the rest were all bursting with joy, bidding farewell and leaving one after another.

Only at this time did Empyrean Flutterfeather’s eyes glimmer as he said, “Is it really fine for you to hand the pill formulas to them? You should know the value of these pill formulas.”

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Right now, the Myriad Treasure Tower and Southern Border Alliance are at war, so everyone won’t think of anything. But as time passes, the pill formulas being in the hands of your Myriad Treasure Tower alone, then the Myriad Treasure Tower will become the target of public censure. When the time comes, can you guarantee that Pilljade they all won’t cause problems? Now, there are even the seven great ancient families backing up the Myriad Treasure Tower. No matter how much they covet the pill formulas, they also wouldn’t easily dare to make a move.”

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan with amazement.

Immediately, the amazement became a bitter smile and he said, “It’s still you who is far-sighted. Even I had both eyes clouded by this enormous profit!”

Although the Myriad Treasure Tower was strong, it was impossible to unify the Southern Border just based on a Myriad Treasure Tower.

It was unless Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure could overpower all of the Heavenly Emperor powerhouses and crown himself king.

Except, while Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure was wrong, he clearly could not accomplish this.

Since he could not do it, then these pill formulas could not be pocketed without sharing.

At that time, forces from various places would come and vie.

In front of enormous profits, perhaps it would even draw out Heavenly Emperor powerhouses. Then there would be no way to clean up the mess.

Since the pill formulas must be handed out, then building good relations with the few major reclusive ancient families was better than giving it to others.

Now, Empyrean Flutterfeather was rejoicing greatly for having made such a young friend back then.

Rather, it was Empyrean Pilljade who clearly had Yun Yi this ace in the hole, but did not know how to cherish and made things difficult for Ye Yuan at every turn.

Now, he probably regretted it until his intestines were green, right?

...

At City Lord Manor, Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital.

Empyrean Flutterfeather sat up straight, his aura astonishing people around him.

Empyrean Windrider and Empyrean Proudcloud had ugly expressions. The Myriad Treasure Tower’s airs were too big. No matter what, they came representing the Southern Border Alliance, Empyrean Flutterfeather actually hung them out to dry for more than a month.

“Huhu, fellow daoists, right now, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s stalls are too many, this Empyrean is busy every day and has neglected everyone. I am truly sorry about it.”

Flutterfeather apologized verbally, but his face did not have any apology at all.

I did it on purpose, do you have a temper?

If you have a temper, push it back down for me!

Sure enough, Empyrean Windrider smiled awkwardly and said, “Yes, yes! Fellow Daoist Flutterfeather is presently the Southern Border’s in-demand person, so you’re naturally busy. It’s also a should that we wait.”

Empyrean Flutterfeather smiled and said, “Not at all, not at all! The Myriad Treasure Tower is just a small faction, how can it compare to the Southern Border Alliance’s power and influence? I wonder what Fellow Daoist Windrider came to Lustrous Gold this time for?”

The meaning of the words was that you bullied people by taking advantage of your power and you bullied the few with an advantage in numbers. Now, weren’t you still annihilated by me?

Flutterfeather’s words carried some delight in his heart.

Honestly speaking, when he supported Ye Yuan ardently back then, his heart was actually racing too.

At that time, how cocky and insufferably arrogant were Empyrean Pilljade they all?

Ye Yuan was merely asking for an explanation. In the end, he was attacked collectively by Empyrean Pilljade’s rallying and even threatened him, making him not stand on Ye Yuan’s side.

Now?

Ye Yuan did not let him down, beating the Southern Border Alliance into a sorry plight by himself.

Empyrean Windrider’s expression turned stiff, feeling stifled in his heart.

What did I come for, could it be that you did not know?

There was no point in slapping people’s faces like that, right?

“Haha, Younger Brother Flutterfeather, this old man came this time representing the Southern Border Alliance to request for the Myriad Treasure Tower to lift your hand high in mercy! You look! Our two parties fighting here and there, disregarding losing our harmonious relationship, how awful would it be to end up in a situation of mutual destruction? Moreover, Younger Brother Flutterfeather is also a member of the Southern Border Alliance. Why is there a need to harm the harmony among your own family?” Empyrean Windrider was helpless and could only say with a fawning smile.

But when Empyrean Flutterfeather heard this, he sneered coldly in his heart.

This Southern Border Alliance really wanted face no matter what!

“Mutual destruction? Fellow Daoist Windrider is gilding your own face too much! My Myriad Treasure Tower already occupies half of the Southern Border, but you’re telling me mutual destruction now? Moreover, this Empyrean has long already withdrawn from the Southern Border Alliance. You say my own family ... heh heh, this Empyrean am not worthy to be part of you all!” Flutterfeather said with a cold smile.

But Windrider took no heed of it and said with a smile, “I understand Younger Brother Flutterfeather’s meaning, but my Southern Border Alliance is after all the Southern Border’s number one great faction. Even if the Myriad Treasure Tower holds the advantage presently, the Myriad Treasure Tower can’t swallow this massive land of Southern Border!”

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s gaze turned cold, and he said with a sneer, “Since that’s the case, this Empyrean doesn’t feel a need to carry on negotiating anymore too. Whatever methods the Southern Border Alliance still has, feel free to use them. My Myriad Treasure Tower will accompany you to the end! Fellow Daoist Windrider, please return!”

This bunch of guys actually still dared to be so domineering when they came to concede defeat, did they really take themselves to be the victor?

His Myriad Treasure Tower could not swallow the Southern Border, but was the Southern Border Alliance a monolithic block?

Really carry on fighting, there would ultimately be someone who could not hold out.

At that time, the Southern Border Alliance would definitely break up!

Empyrean Pilljade definitely saw this too, that was why he sent Empyrean Windrider here.

How could he, Empyrean Flutterfeather, not understand the situation?

Moreover, the Myriad Treasure Tower currently had the seven great ancient families supporting. So what was he, Flutterfeather, afraid of?

Empyrean Windrider’s face changed, only then coming to a realization that the present Flutterfeather was already not the Flutterfeather back then!

Ever since bringing Empyrean Pilljade to his knees in the Cloudpill Summit, the present Empyrean Flutterfeather was already a fierce and ambitious figure!

“Younger Brother Flutterfeather, please calm your anger! This Empyrean ... This Empyrean coming this time, it’s actually to represent the Southern Border Alliance to admit defeat. Brother Pilljade has given the verbal order that as long as Younger Brother Flutterfeather is willing, you can return to the Southern Border Alliance at any time. You are still the alliance chief!”

Empyrean Windrider finally lowered his high head.

He was the master of an exalted holy land, so when had he lowered his head to someone before?

But today, he had no choice but to lower his head!

Saying ‘admit defeat’ these two words out of his mouth was as heavy as 30 thousand catties.

When Empyrean Flutterfeather heard that, he just chuckled and said, “Admitting defeat, one should have the manner of admitting defeat! It’s just, whether or not we reconcile, Flutterfeather can’t make the decision! If you guys want to bury the hatchet, there must be another person who nods his head!”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
