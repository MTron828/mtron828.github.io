Chapter 2183: Entering Blackflame Cave

Tan Yi looked at Ye Yuan, his expression changing again and again.

He had always been paying attention to Zhuo Yuanzhi’s activities and discovered that Zhuo Yuanzhi’s divine soul did not get any damage.

Such terrifying divine soul control was simply inconceivable.

Even he, this Eight-star Alchemy God, could not achieve such precise control too.

“This ... Is this the standard of Second Sage?”

Starting from when Ye Yuan stepped into this room, the few things that he did made him, this Eight-star Alchemy God, feel ashamed of his unworthiness.

Only then did he truly realize what kind of existence Second Sage was!

Fallen Maple’s expression was somewhat ugly as he said with a bitter smile, “Just what kind of a monster did Mengli this lass take fancy on? Back then, I was still intent on matching her with Changqing. Thinking about it, it’s really laughable!”

Lin Changqing and Yue Mengli two people were Fallen Maple Bodhidharma’s golden child and jade girl.

Unconsciously, everyone had long already treated them as lovers, Fallen Maple was no exception either.

Toward these two disciples that he was most proud of, Fallen Maple naturally consciously or even unconsciously wanted to matchmake the two of them.

It was just that for so many years, Yue Mengli had always kept Lin Changqing at a distance.

Fallen Maple knew that Yue Mengli had Mister Right in her heart, so he did not mind either.

In his view, when Yue Mengli reached great heights in the future and became a supreme Heavenly Emperor together with Lin Changqing, why would she place a mortal in her sights?

But Fallen Maple never dreamed that the mortal he knew only used a short thousand years’ time and stood in front of him.

Although his strength was far inferior to his, in terms of status, it was already sufficient to stand on equal footing with him!

Furthermore, the strength that he displayed, even they all, these Heavenly Emperors, had to look up to as well!

Achieving the position of a sovereign in the future was just a matter of time.

His previous idea naturally became a joke.

After a while, Ye Yuan let go of Zhuo Yuanzhi, the expression on his face became solemn.

From Zhuo Yuanzhi’s memories, he saw that Li-er just happened to be pursued by several abyss monsters at that time.

Those Empyrean powerhouses had never seen before such a ferocious species, all fleeing helter-skelter.

The events that happened later, Zhuo Yuanzhi did not know anymore.

“Senior Fallen Maple, thank you for your hospitality. This Ye wants to set off for Blackflame Cave at once. Farewell!” Ye Yuan clasped his hands and was about to leave.

“Hang on!” Fallen Maple hurriedly stopped Ye Yuan and said, “Actually, our seven great Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas have already reached a consensus. We plan on sending elite disciples over to Blackflame Cave this time to investigate thoroughly. Our Fallen Maple Bodhidharma plan on sending Yufeng and another Empyrean Realm disciple over. Why don’t ... Second Sage go together with them?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “They do theirs. I’ll go on my own.”

Ye Yuan was currently burning with anxiety, delaying for a moment more and Li-er would be in more danger.

He could not wait for a second longer.

Fallen Maple knew what Ye Yuan was thinking and said, “Actually, Yufeng they all are all set already. If not for Second Sage suddenly coming up the mountain, they might have already set off at this time. Since Second Sage wants to go, this emperor will have them set off at once, how’s that?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Fine as well!”

On Sunset Peak, Zheng Yufeng brought four Empyrean powerhouses and prepared to set off with Ye Yuan.

These five Empyreans were shockingly all middle-stage Empyrean Realm powerhouses!

The few people were just about to set off when suddenly, a figure blocked their path.

It was none other than precisely Lin Changqing!

Lin Changqing directly knelt down toward Fallen Maple and gritted his teeth and said, “Master, please let Changqing go along!”

Fallen Maple said unhappily, “Nonsense! The Blackflame Cave is very dangerous, even if your Senior Apprentice Brother Yufeng went, Master is also filled with anxiety, let alone you? Go back!”

Lin Changqing had reddened eyes as he gritted his teeth and said, “If Master doesn’t let me go, I’ll kneel down and not get up!”

Fallen Maple was just about to fly off the handle, but he heard Ye Yuan said coolly, “Senior Fallen Maple, let him go.”

Fallen Maple let out a sigh and waved his hand powerlessly and said, “Sigh, foolish! Go then, go on!”

With his eyesight, how could he not tell that Lin Changqing was going for the sake of Yue Mengli?

It was just that ...

Fallen Maple gave Ye Yuan a glance and took a look at Lin Changqing again, finally, it turned into a long sigh.

... ...

The group of people marched day and night without rest, with stars as a cloak and the moon as a hat, spending half a month’s time, and finally rushed to Angry Nether Riverbank.

Angry Nether Riverbank was presently already the various major faction’s forbidden ground.

But at this time, there were still many powerhouses surrounding and watching at the river.

These people were mostly Empyrean Realm powerhouses that came from the various major forces.

On the river, there was an enormous and dark cave entrance. There was dense black aura smoking around it. It was as if it was a prehistoric behemoth about to devour everything.

“Zheng Yufeng, why is your Fallen Maple Bodhidharma dragging your feet, only arriving now?” At this time, a middle-aged man came up and said to Zheng Yufeng.

Zheng Yufeng said, “Brother Li Yue, we were delayed for a while by some matters, hence, we came late.”

Li Yue took a look at Ye Yuan and Lin Changqing behind Zheng Yufeng and said with a frown, “Isn’t it agreed to only send middle-stage Empyrean Realms over? You guys brought two burdens. At that time, we’ll still have to divide our attention to take care of them! Lin Changqing, this brat too, the two of you stay behind!”

When Lin Changqing heard that, his expression could not help changing.

He was indeed a genius, but his strength had not truly become powerful yet.

In front of Li Yue, he was still a junior!

While Ye Yuan behaved like he did not hear it at all, slowly walking to the riverbank, and sized up the Blackflame Cave’s entrance seriously.

A very familiar feeling!

He had stayed for as long as ten years in Dragon Eye Cave and absorbed countless devilish energy.

But the strength of this devilish energy was much weaker compared to the Dragon Eye Cave.

Just as Fallen Maple said, this cave entrance was extremely unstable. Late-stage Empyrean powerhouses entering inside would probably make space collapse too.

When Li Yue saw Ye Yuan ignore him, he said with an unhappy look, “Hey, brat, this empyrean is talking to you. Didn’t you hear?”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to care about him and turned to Lin Changqing and said, “Follow me!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan stepped onto the void and arrived above the river.

Lin Changqing was taken aback when he heard that, his face revealing a look of struggle.

But very soon, he clenched his jaws and followed after.

Li Yue was unhappy to begin with. Seeing this scene, he sneered coldly and said, “Zheng Yufeng, why did your Fallen Maple Bodhidharma bring a fool over? He wouldn’t want to enter the Blackflame Cave just like this, right? The devilish energy there, if there isn’t our restriction, it’s sufficient to devour Empyrean Realm martial artists! This guy is seeking death!”

Zheng Yufeng also had a look of puzzlement and yelled in a clear voice, “Brother Ye, this devilish energy is extremely formidable and has already devoured many Empyrean powerhouses!”

Ye Yuan did not even turn his head back and said coolly, “I’ll go in and take a look first. You guys just hurry up!”

Li Yue laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Foolish thing! If you can enter, this empyrean will chop my head off for you to kick as a ball!”

Just as he was talking, Ye Yuan already arrived at the Blackflame Cave’s entrance.

Endless devilish energy rushed toward him and Lin Changqing frenziedly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lin Changqing jumped in fright and hurriedly revolved his cultivation method, wanting to resist the devilish energy.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s Chaos Heavenspan Canon activated. The devilish energy poured into his body crazily.

When the Lin Changqing following behind saw this scene, his eyes became wide saucers.

Li Yue opened his mouth wide, virtually able to stuff a fist in.
