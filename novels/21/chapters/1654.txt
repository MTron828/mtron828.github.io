Chapter 1658 Spirit Circle Projection

Titanic waves surged in Jian Zhentao’s heart!

His Profound Spirit Chaos Formula was already cultivated to peak fourth level. His art of viewing aura was also grand completion rank four. However, he actually suffered such a terrifying backlash with one glance.

The grandeur of this boy’s destiny was simply appalling!

“Elder Jian, you used ... the art of observing aura on Ye Yuan just now?” Li Xing seemed to have understood something and could not resist asking.

Jian Zhentao knew that he could not hide it. So he said with a bitter smile, “Hearing what you said just now, this old self was somewhat curious. So I utilized the art of observing aura. I didn’t expect that ... this old man was inept and actually suffered a backlash!”

Li Xing said in shock, “Elder Jian must be joking! Within the boundaries of these three imperial cities, who doesn’t know that Elder Jian’s art of observing aura is extremely accurate. How can you be inept?”

At this time, another two figures walked over. They were City Lord Chai Rong and the Blood Rainbow Manor’s manor lord, Wang Chao.

When they saw that Jian Zhentao’s two eyes were flowing with bloody tears, they turned pale with fright and said, “Elder Jian, what’s wrong with you?”

Li Xing briefly explained the situation. The two people’s gazes when looking at Ye Yuan was full of astonishment.

Looks like their judgment previously was indeed not wrong.

“Elder Jian, I wonder what color Master Ye Yuan’s destiny is?” Chai Rong asked.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s art of observing aura was not a secret. A person’s destiny could be divided into seven levels. When observing aura, it would show different colors.

Red aura was the weakest, while purple aura was the most prosperous!

Normally, those able to reach purple aura, as long as they did not fall, breaking through to the True God Realm in the future was virtually a sure bet.

That powerhouse who left behind the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate had once been viewed by the Jian Family’s art of observing auras, and the person had the most prosperous purple aura.

Jian Zhentao smiled bitterly and said, “This old man didn’t see anything at all! But this old man reckons that Little Friend Ye Yuan’s destiny is likely the imperial aura!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He only took one look and blinded himself!

“Imperial aura!” The three great powerhouses shuddered all over.

Imperial aura, they had also heard before. It was just that in Riverluck Capital City, this kind of remote place, it was impossible for imperial aura to appear at all.

Because people who have imperial aura appear could be said to have a heaven-defying destiny, and they were all able to step into the Empyrean Realm in the end!

Being a Heavenly Empyrean, that was already a powerhouse that stood at the very summit of this world, an existence that they needed to look up to, and also an existence that could not be reached for life!

Could it be that this young man in front of them could achieve the Empyrean Realm in the future?

Dustless already told Ye Yuan these, so Ye Yuan also understood the meaning of imperial aura.

But he was not interested in this. What he was interested in was Jian Zhentao’s cultivation method.

Ye Yuan suddenly cupped his fists and said, “Elder Jian, Ye Yuan has a presumptuous request.”

At this time, these few people’s perceptions of Ye Yuan were somewhat different again.

A future Empyrean powerhouse, was he not worth them fawning on him?

Jian Zhentao slowly nodded and said, “You say.”

Ye Yuan said, “Elder Jian, can you display your divine essence again? Junior wants to experience it personally.”

Jian Zhentao was rather surprised but did not refuse it either. Hence, he revolved the Profound Spirit Chaos Formula and released his divine essence.

Carefully sensing the divine essence that Jian Zhentao released, Ye Yuan trembled all over.

This divine essence was indeed incomparably mysterious. More importantly, Ye Yuan actually sensed a hint of chaos divine essence concept from Jian Zhentao’s divine essence.

This made him incredibly shocked!

Every martial artists’ divine essence would have subtle differences because of the differences in the cultivation method they cultivate.

Some divine essences were suited to cultivate Sword Dao martial techniques, some divine essences were suitable to cultivate fire martial techniques. But those able to cultivate out a trace of chaos divine essence was one of a kind!

“The world is so vast, looks like I’ve underestimated the heroes of the world! This Jian Zhentao is merely ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord and he’s already so powerful. I wonder how powerful that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets is!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion in his heart.

Dustless said, “Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets has lived for god knows how many tens of thousands of years. He’s the transcendent heavenly emperor with the longest lifespan! There’s even a legend that he had once fought for the position of Dao Ancestor before but failed in the end. This kind of existence naturally can’t be placed in the same category as ordinary people. Those kinds of existences are all powerhouses who approach Great Dao. Cultivating chaos divine essence isn’t anything strange.”

Ye Yuan said, “Looks like my path isn’t wrong. Even Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, that kind of powerhouse, is also pursuing chaos divine essence! It’s just that their chaos divine essence is far from as pure as mine.”

Witnessing Jian Zhentao’s divine essence, Ye Yuan became even more certain of his path.

What he wanted to do right now was to find the direction of the next step!

“Many thanks, Elder Jian! The Profound Spirit Chaos Formula is indeed profound and inscrutable, Ye Yuan admires,” Ye Yuan said sincerely.

“Huhu, that’s the grace that’s bestowed by Ancestor. We only learned a bit of smattering; not worth mentioning. If Little Friend Ye Yuan is free, there’s no harm taking a trip to Extreme Light Imperial City,” Jian Zhentao said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll definitely pay a visit next time!”

...

In a corner of the street, Jing Lu gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Uncle Huang, that kid keeps refusing to come out. He definitely bought something! Supreme region, those who would buy the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone is only him!”

After the auction ended, Jing Lu was unwilling to accept it.

He suspected that the one competing with him was Ye Yuan, so he stood guard outside.

Uncle Huang also nodded when he heard it and said, “Very likely! I inquired before, he collected Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones previously. Bidding with Young Patriarch for the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone is within reason.”

Jing Lu’s gaze was dark as he said in a cold voice, “No way, I can’t stomach this! Uncle Huang, I’m going to kill him! Firstly, it avenges the enmity previously! Secondly, it’s also to snatch the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone for Father. Missing this time, Father will have to wait for no idea how many years before having a chance to break through to Celestial Deity Realm!”

Uncle Huang frowned and said, “Young Patriarch, while that’s right, the three major forces are clearly partial toward him. It’s not easy for us to act!”

“I also didn’t say to kill him in the city. When the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate’s inheritance is over, he’ll definitely leave Riverluck Capital City. At that time, we ...”

Jing Lu had a vicious expression as he did a beheading action.

Uncle Huang thought about it and said with a nod, “Young Patriarch’s words are reasonable! It’s just that ... I’m afraid that this kid’s background isn’t small. If we want to kill him, we’d better be fully prepared!”

Jing Lu nodded and said, “Mn, you ask Father for help right now. Have him send more experts over! Heh heh, an Origin Deity Realm kid, to dare challenge this young master, this young master will let you know what’s called despair!”

“Yes, Young Patriarch!” Uncle Huang said.

...

On this day, the north of the city suddenly erupted with rays of brilliant light.

Several hundred rays of light suddenly projected down from the sky, shining on the earth, as if spotlights.

“Spirit circle projection! It’s the spirit circle projection! The Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate is now open!”

This phenomenon made the martial artists in the city seethe all at once.

For a moment, those martial artists ran wild all at once, speeding out of the city frenziedly, lest they get left behind.

In the wilderness to the north of the city, a stone gate stood erect and tall.

In front of the stone gate, circles of light appeared on the ground. The martial artists fought with each other, attempting to enter the light circles.
