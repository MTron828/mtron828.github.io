Chapter 1464 Jumping off a Cliff

In the dense forest, two figures were currently shuttling through at high speed.

Along the way, Ling Feng also had the intention of testing Ye Yuan, deliberately speeding up his footsteps.

Moving through inside this dense forest, just movement technique being fast was useless. It had an extremely high requirement for the martial artist’s responsiveness.

Ling Feng they all patrolled this area all year round and were very familiar with the terrain here. Hence, his speed was also particularly fast.

He urged his speed to the limits and sprinted wildly for a long way, thinking in his mind that he shook Ye Yuan off a certain distance before slowing down his footsteps.

But when he turned around to look, he could not help getting startled.

Ye Yuan was like a ghost and had actually been following not far behind him all along.

This shock was by no means insignificant!

He actually completely did not sense Ye Yuan’s existence earlier.

If Ye Yuan dealt him a sword from behind, he would already be a corpse at this time!

Seeing Ling Feng’s expression, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I said before, my movement technique is still alright, I won’t hold you back.”

Ling Feng smiled rather embarrassedly and said, “Younger Brother Ye has fine skills, this Ling really made an error of judgment.”

He discovered that he really underestimated Ye Yuan. At least in this dense forest, to be able to keep up with him noiselessly, it was absolutely not what the average initial-stage Heaven Glimpse could accomplish.

Just based on this, Ye Yuan had the qualifications to enter the army.

With Ye Yuan’s skill, he would absolutely be an expert in going to investigate enemy intel.

Ling Feng was very familiar with the route, bringing Ye Yuan to make a big detour, finally climbing up to the Fiend Calling Ridge’s summit.

The spectacular scenery before their eyes also shook Ye Yuan’s heart.

Ahead was a 100 thousand foot wide cliff, below the precipice deep until the bottom could not be seen.

This was a natural moat insurmountable by an individual’s strength!

Furthermore, after Ye Yuan reached the summit, he immediately felt his footsteps become much heavier.

A powerful gravitational field made him, this Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouse, somewhat struggle to walk too.

This natural moat was really extraordinary as if done by gods.

“The gravitational field here isn’t the strongest yet. The more towards the middle of this natural chasm, the stronger the gravity! Therefore, this natural chasm cannot be crossed at all. Really don’t know how those fiends came over,” Ling Feng said rather perplexedly.

Ye Yuan said, “We made a big detour. There are probably several dozen miles away from the place they crossed the natural moat. Now, let’s be more careful and draw closer there.”

Ling Feng nodded his head, drawing new to the place where the fiend race crossed the natural chasm.

The two people cautiously passed through several dozen miles. Finally, their gazes turned intent, looking at the 100 thousand foot great canyon in astonishment.

Only to see that inside that great canyon, a flying boat that could carry several dozen people was currently slowly flying.

That flying boat actually suspended in midair and did not drop down. It was currently transporting fiend race soldiers batch by batch, flying over to the human race’s side.

The only shortcoming was that this flying boat was not large. It looked like it could only transport five to six squads each time.

Reckon that those fiend race soldiers Ye Yuan they all ran into was the first batch sent over.

“They can actually fly above this natural moat! This ... this is too astounding! Luckily we ran into that batch of fiend race soldiers. Otherwise this time, Tiderain City definitely can’t be defended!” Ling Feng lowered his voice and said.

Ye Yuan did not speak, gaze staring at that flying boat, an appearance as if he was absorbed in thought.

Ling Feng continued, “No way, got to bring this news back to Tiderain City. Otherwise, when the fiend race army is finished assembling, Tiderain City will be attacked from both front and rear!”

With this flying boat, the fiend race would be able to send troops over to the Fiend Calling Ridge’s side unceasingly.

At that time, with a two-pronged pincer attack, Tiderain City would face an even greater threat.

Therefore, Ling Feng already could not wait to return to Tiderain City and report this major intelligence to Tiderain City.

But at this time, a fiend race powerhouses currently had his brows tightly knitted several miles away from Ling Feng duo.

The aura on this fiend was very powerful, giving people an extremely strong sense of oppression.

This was the leader of this fiend race army, Xiu Lie, a half-stop Divine Lord Realm powerhouse.

“Those few squads’ people are all not back yet?” Xiu Lie said in a deep voice.

“Replying Your Excellency, there’s no news yet! Those few squads seemed to have lost contact,” an Origin Deity Realm subordinate said.

Xiu Lie’s brows knitted even tighter as he muttered to himself, “Could it be that they encountered the human race’s army? This is impossible! According to our intel, Fiend Calling Ridge this area, Tiderain City’s army very rarely comes over. Send people to go and inquire about the intel again and search for those few teams’ whereabouts. I want to see the person if alive, the corpse if dead!”

“Yes, Your Excellency!” The subordinate answered and left.

Xiu Lie paced around continuously, clearly somewhat irritable.

Crossing the Fiend Calling Ridge’s natural moat this time was a several decades long grand plan that the fiend race planned and prepared for. There could not be the slightest accident.

At that time, when celestial soldiers descended from the heavens[1], Tiderain City would surely be breached!

As long as Tiderain City was breached, the fiend race army would be able to march straight in without resistance.

But Xiu Lie never thought that they were actually thwarted at the very beginning this time. The few squads sent out to inquire about information actually disappeared without a sound!

Not long after, the subordinate came to report once again.

“Your Excellency, those few squads seemed to have evaporated into thin air, without any traces at all! I sent several dozen teams to go out and investigate but didn’t discover their figures. But ... a team discovered some traces of fighting in the dense forest ...”

Xiu Lie’s expression was grim until it was almost going to drip water and he said, “To be able to dispose of five squads without a sound, it’s probably a human race expert! Not good, they might be spying on the military situation in the vicinity! Immediately dispatch everyone who came over to conduct a carpet search in the vicinity! Also, you, call on some commanders over for me. The arrival’s strength is likely not weak. Once any activities are discovered, immediately rush over and kill without mercy!”

“Yes, Your Excellency!”

Xiu Lie gritted his teeth and said, “Damn it, how can it be so coincidental? Now that they’re spying on the military situation right now and didn’t send the news back to Tiderain City!”

The fiend race’s movements here were huge. Powerful auras were faintly perceptible, starting to conduct searches in the vicinity.

Ye Yuan said softly, “Go, they probably discovered that those few squads went missing and already suspect that somebody sneaked in.”

Ling Feng nodded and brought Ye Yuan to quietly withdraw.

“Scree!”

Suddenly a clear eagle sound echoed out in the air.

Ling Feng lifted his head to look when he heard this sound and his expression could not help changing drastically!

“Not good! It’s the Devil Blood Eagle raised by the fiend race! It’s the most sensitive to the human race’s scent! We ... We can’t escape anymore!”

Ling Feng’s complexion was ashen, his eyes actually lost all hope.

“The Devil Blood Eagle discovered humans! They are currently escaping in the southwest direction!’ suddenly someone among the fiends exclaimed.

When Xie Lie heard this voice, his gaze turned dark, his figure moving explosively, speeding over in the southwest direction.

Several powerful auras engulfed everything and swept over like the tide.

Especially Xiu Lie, even with the gravitational field’s interference, his speed was also swift to the extreme.

At this time, Ye Yuan’s inner-heart had broken down too. Under the powerful gravitational field, Xiu Lie’s speed was still faster than everyone else, pressing straight for Ye Yuan duo.

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath and said to Ling Feng, “Do you trust me?”

Ling Feng froze and immediately nodded his head.

“Good, jump together!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.
