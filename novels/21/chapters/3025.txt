Chapter 3024: Celestial Army Descending from Heaven!

Above the void, sword intent crisscrossed!

Zhuo Bufan, one person and one sword, was seemingly a pine tree in heaven and earth, standing proudly.

However, he was not a pine tree.

Wang Zuo and Bloodsky, two great Supreme Hegemons joining hands, he was under too much pressure!

Especially Bloodsky, he corroborated his Dao with spatial origin. His combat power was extremely formidable.

Even if Zhuo Bufan’s sword was capable of destroying any stronghold, it was hard to do anything to him too.

Under the two people’s collaboration, his defeat seemed to have been certain.

Boom!

After a bout of fierce fighting, Bloodsky finally broke through Zhuo Bufan’s sword world, the power of origin slamming heavily onto his body.

Zhuo Bufan gave a muffled groan, his figure flying out backward.

How could Wang Zuo be willing to let this opportunity go? Blood light shone brightly, directly chasing after.

Whoosh!

A shocking sword light erupted bizarrely from Zhuo Bufan’s body, directly slamming onto Wang Zuo’s body.

Wang Zuo’s body was directly blasted into a cloud of blood mist.

But very soon, he condensed his figure again, looking at Zhuo Bufan with a vigilant look.

This guy was too troublesome!

There were hundreds of millions of humans who cultivated Sword Dao, but no one could achieve his level.

This kind of pure to the extreme sword intent made his combat strength fearsome to the extreme.

“Zhuo Bufan, you don’t stand a chance! Keep fighting and you’ll die!” Wang Zuo said in a solemn voice.

“Wang Zuo, you don’t need to waste your efforts anymore! One must first cultivate the heart when cultivating the sword. No matter how sweet your words sound, you can forget about wavering my sword heart! For a man, death is but death. What fear do us cultivators have?” Zhuo Bufan said coolly.

Actually, after repeated great battles, Zhuo Bufan was already severely wounded.

But his combat strength did not diminish much.

Wang Zuo and Bloodsky were very apprehensive of him too, wanting to use words to incite him into leaving.

But Zhuo Bufan was not moved at all.

On the other side, Hegemon Cloudmount and Hegemon Blacksun had already fallen into a desperate situation too!

The two of them were being besieged by seven Peak Hegemons!

Actually, the two of them were long already arrows at the end of their flight. At this time, they were just relying on willpower to fight.

“Old Man Blacksun, we’ve fought for so many years. I didn’t expect that we’re going to die together today. How unlucky!” Hegemon Cloudmount said unhappily.

Hegemon Blacksun almost spewed out a mouthful of old blood and said with an angry roar, “F*ck you, Cloudmount! You old undying, your mouth is really smelly!”

Cloudmount laughed loudly and said, “Old Man Blacksun, do you have any last wishes?”

Blacksun said, “No last wishes. It’s just that … when faced with imminent death, I’m somewhat missing the woman when I was in the Lower Realms.?Uh?… I can finally reunite with her!”

Cloudmount could not help laughing as he said, “Reunite your head! You’ve already lived for God knows how many years! That woman has long entered samsara!”

Unexpectedly, Blacksun did not rebut and asked, “What about you, old fogey?”

Cloudmount chuckled and said, “There are no last wishes. It’s just a bit regretful that I didn’t get to see the day that little disciple of mine reached the apex!”

“Tch,?still thinking about that brat? I dare guarantee that that kid has definitely already been controlled by the Chaos Bloodstone. Give up on this!” Blacksun said with certainty.

“F*ck your bullsh*t!”

Cloudmount could not resist swearing, but he suddenly sighed again and said, “Old Fogey Blacksun, it’s about time!”

Blacksun nodded his head and said, “Yeah, it’s about time! Keep dragging things out, and we won’t even have the capital to put up a desperate fight anymore!”

Boom!

Boom!

Behind Cloudmount and Blacksun two people, the Door of Eternal Life appeared.

Following that, the two people’s life force dissipated rapidly, but their auras rose rapidly!

“They are offering up life force to obtain the power of eternal life! Everyone, be careful! After their life force is depleted, they will be dead men!” On the blood race’s side, Hegemon Qing Yao warned.

“Go f*ck yourself! Refine for me!”

In the void, Cloudmount directly materialized a large hand and refined a blood race Hegemon into blood mist.

But sadly, the other party did not die. He recovered back anew very quickly.

Reaching this realm, wanting to kill a blood race Hegemon was really far too difficult.

Blacksun’s strength also skyrocketed, directly demolishing a blood race Hegemon.

But sadly, it was useless!

Far away, when Zhuo Bufan felt the aura over here, his expression could not help dimming and he shouted, “Bon voyage, two seniors! This Zhuo will follow right after!”

Cloudmount laughed loudly and said, “Hegemon Bufan, being able to know you in this lifetime, I, Cloudmount, have the fortune of three lifetimes! The two of us old men will wait for you on the road! Also, everybody, the two of us old fellows will make a move first!”

A solemn and stirring atmosphere instantly spread out on the battlefield.

Everyone knew that it had reached the moment of life and death!

This battle was too difficult. They were indeed tired too.

Although fighting with the blood race plunged the people into misery and suffering, the most tiring and strenuous were actually them, these Hegemon Realms.

This was because they were shouldering too many things.

It was just that sadly, it still fell short of success at the last step in the end.

“Two seniors, take care! We’ll follow right after!”

“Two seniors have worked hard!”

… …

Cloudmount two people had surging auras, each finding their target and attacking crazily.

In a blink, that Hegemon could not make it anymore.

But their auras also weakened.

Although this kind of method that ignited one’s life force could exchange for a powerful offensive strength, the damage to one’s own body was irreversible.

Bang!

Hegemon Qing Yao took advantage of Cloudmount’s weakness and sneak attacked from the side, directly demolishing half of his body.

Hegemon Cloudmount’s aura was feeble, virtually without the strength to fight back anymore.

“Sigh,?in the end, I failed to take anyone down. How disgraceful!” Heaving a sigh in his heart, he saw Hegemon Qing Yao charge over once more.

This time, he could not move anymore.

Death was coming head-on.

Boom!

At the moment of life and death, Hegemon Qing Yao’s body flew out like a cannonball.

Cloudmount’s pupils constricted.?What is going on? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

But very soon, he saw an afterimage glide past him, charging over toward Hegemon Qing Yao.

That figure was berserk to the extreme.

At the same time, an extremely familiar figure grabbed his disabled body, both eyes blood-red.

“Zhao Yue, tear this damn thing to shreds for me!” Ye Yuan used all the strength in his body to howl.

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue seemed to have felt Ye Yuan’s fury. The him, who was originally ferocious, became even more violent.

He really tore Qing Yao to pieces.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

One powerful aura after another suddenly descended!

Wang Zuo’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Dragon Clan! Vermilion Bird Clan! Soul race! This … How is this possible?”

It was only to see Long Jian, Luan Qinghe, and Imperishable, three great Supreme Hegemons, directly joining the fight, instantly forming a pincer attack against Wang Zuo and Bloodsky.

These three people were veteran Supreme Hegemons, their strength being unfathomable.

Their combat power was much stronger than Wang Zuo and Bloodsky, these two newbies.

Zhuo Bufan also looked at this scene in unbelievable shock. This scene was truly celestial soldiers descending from heaven!

Who could have thought that three Supreme Hegemons would actually descend in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven to help them resist the blood race?’

This kind of thing, he did not even dare to think about it.

But it really happened.

“Hahaha?…”

Hegemon Cloudmount suddenly burst out laughing!

He was happy!

He was really very happy!

That moment when he saw Ye Yuan, he felt that there were no regrets in this life anymore!
