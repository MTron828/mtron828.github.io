Chapter 1788 Can“t Even Win a Hand

“Did you guys hear? That guy who formed a team with Senior Sister Baili seemed to have been kicked out by Senior Sister Baili.”

“Of course I heard. So do you want to go and find him too? I heard that people who went to find him were all pilfered until not even pants remain in the end!”

“This guy is also too ferocious. I didn’t expect that his strength is so strong! However, he also can’t jump around for much longer. I heard that Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin both went to look for him.”

...

Baili Qingyan capitalized on that her strength was powerful. The places she went were all very dangerous. Otherwise, she also would not have run into such a powerful existence like the Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast.

That kind of place, the martial artists encountered were naturally few.

The moment Ye Yuan and Baili Qingyan separated, it attracted a large group of people to come over and encircle him very quickly.

These people all thought that his strength was meager and purely wanted to take a bit of advantage. Who knew that they tried to steal a chicken and ended up losing the rice, and was robbed clean of heavenly demon crystals by Ye Yuan instead.

At this time, in an open area, Ye Yuan was blocked by more than a dozen powerhouses.

These people’s auras were all powerful. They were actually all Seventh and Eighth Firmament Divine Lord powerhouses.

Among these people included Zhao Zhao and Zhao Shu.

“Ye Yuan, I’ll see where you’re going to run this time!” Zhao Shu had an appearance like he had cornered Ye Yuan as he said these words smugly.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “When did I say that I was going to run? I’m here, waiting precisely for you all to deliver yourselves to the doorstep.”

Zhao Zhao sneered and said, “Waiting for us to deliver ourselves to the doorstep? A toad yawning, what high-sounding sentiments! You wouldn’t say that you’re waiting here to snatch our heavenly demon crystals, right?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head solemnly and said, “Looks like you’re not too stupid.”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, this group of people all revealed amused looks.

Did this guy’s head have a problem?

Zhao Zhao shook his head and laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and said, “Breaking through to become a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, is this your reliance? You wouldn’t really think that defeating Third Brother by a fluke, you can similarly defeat me, right? Kid, I have to say that you’re very naive!”

Zhao Shu also laughed loudly and said, “Truly an ignorant fool! Why do you think that Han Yong was so wary of my big brother? My big brother fused water and fire, two kinds of laws, and it’s hard to find an opponent in the same rank. Moreover, we have so many people, each one has a higher realm than you. How dumb are you to say words that have such an exaggerated opinion of your abilities?”

The Devil Elephant lineage’s force in the Shadowmoon Sect was very powerful. Furthermore, they themselves had many affiliated sects.

These people were all the Devil Elephant lineage’s elites.

Among these dozen over people, there were even quite a number of Eighth Firmament Divine Lords.

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said with an indifferent look, “Is that so? Then you all attack together, let me witness your strength. I’ll only use one hand, hope that you all don’t disappoint me too much.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan placed his left hand behind him, with a very proud look.

The Devil Elephant lineage’s disciples all had stunned faces. This guy was really crazy!

One hand dealing with so many people?

Even Duan Qinghong the three of them also did not dare to be arrogant, right?

“Hahaha, the genius Ye Yuan wants to witness the strength of us rookies. Everyone, don’t be polite. Take good care of him. He’s so impressive, so we mustn’t let him down. All keep your chins up!” Zhao Zhao laughed loudly and said.

When everyone heard that, they immediately let out a series of loud guffaws.

“This fellow, his strength isn’t strong, but his tone is even bigger than the heavens!”

“This is called as having ambition loftier than the heavens, but life thinner than paper, right? Haha!”

“Everyone, go easier, loosen up his bones and joints well for him. If he’s beaten to death at once, it won’t be fun.”

...

Zhao Zhao waved his hand grandly, those Devil Elephant lineage’s disciples all had shocking momentums, each displaying their abilities and rushing over towards Ye Yuan.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Several figures arrived at the same time, it was all blade lights and sword images all around Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan was as steady as Mount Tai.

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan’s right hand shot out like a spirit snake, directly grabbing at that disciple who rushed over from head-on.

Crack!

That disciple’s wrist was directly snapped by Ye Yuan, his weapon falling onto the ground with a clank.

While the other people’s frantic attacks danced wildly around Ye Yuan, but not one landed on Ye Yuan.

Smack!

Ye Yuan gave a slap with a backhand, directly flinging it onto another disciple’s face, immediately sending him flying out several thousand feet away.

The present Ye Yuan already utilized spatial law to a transcendent degree.

For ordinary attacks to want to land on him, it was simply even harder than ascending to heaven.

Unless their strength was much greater than his, then they could use powerful world power to suppress spatial law.

Otherwise, there was only the outcome of being abused.

These Devil Elephant lineage’s disciples were mostly Seventh Firmament Divine Lord. In terms of realm, they were only that tiny bit stronger than Ye Yuan.

But the thickness of Ye Yuan’s divine essence was much stronger than even Seventh Firmament Divine Lords.

Overwhelming laws, overwhelming cultivation realm, this was a totally mismatched battle.

It was only to see tragic screams ring out, causing Zhao Zhao and Zhao Shu two people’s expressions became livid.

“Spatial law! It’s spatial law! No wonder this guy dares to be so arrogant. It turns out that he actually comprehended spatial law!” Zhao Shu cried out in shock.

Zhao Zhao’s expression was very grim. Ye Yuan’s might far exceeded their imagination.

“Attack together!”

Zhao Zhao gave a cold cry, figure shooting out explosively.

Zhao Shu’s expression also changed, and he followed closely behind.

“Twin Dragon Spitting Pearl!”

“Swift Wind Sword Art!”

Among these people, it was clearly Zhao Zhao and Zhao Shu whose strengths were the strongest.

The addition of the two of them made the overall strength go up a large step.

However, Ye Yuan laughed coldly, forming a sword with his finger, and suddenly pointed. The two enormous dragons that Zhao Jian condensed with the power of water and fire, two mighty laws, were directly scattered.

Following that, he clamped two fingers, and actually directly clamped down on Zhao Shu’s sword.

Zhao Zhao was akin to being struck by a heavy blow, spewing out a mouthful of blood mist, figure flying out backward.

Ye Yuan’s two fingers were like iron pliers. Zhao Shu used all of his strength, but could not pull it out at all.

“This is the strength of your Devil Elephant lineage? Really disappoints me!” Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh.

Zhao Shu’s face flushed red, no wonder whether it was because he used too much force, or was it because of Ye Yuan.

All in all, it was very humiliating.

Previously, Song Ting even said that the Devil Elephant lineage was not to be trifled with. But they sent out more than a dozen people and actually could not even beat one of Ye Yuan’s hand.

This result truly made people perspire from embarrassment.

“Humph! Truly a bunch of trash! So many people and you actually can’t even deal with a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord!”

At this time, a cold snort sounded out, the words were full of disdain. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Heh, that punk comprehended spatial law, no wonder he’s so arrogant! With the strength of these trash, defeat is also within reason,” another voice sounded out.

Two figures, one north and one south, slowly walked out of the woods.

When Zhao Zhao saw these two people, he could not help being overjoyed.

Duan Qinghong!

Zhong Hanlin!

These two people arrived, then Ye Yuan was dead for sure!

Even if Ye Yuan comprehended spatial law, the result was also the same.

Having the Devil Elephant lineage’s number one person around, Ye Yuan was too weak to stand up to compete with them all.

Zhong Hanlin looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Punk, there was Junior Sister Baili protecting you the last time. This time, you won’t be so lucky!”
