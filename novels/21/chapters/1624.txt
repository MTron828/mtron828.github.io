Chapter 1628 Absolute Magnetism Black Tortoise

gao yuan’s words made everyone fall silent.

compared to killing ye yuan, finding the lucky chance was clearly the most important thing.

the reason why they had the thought of killing ye yuan was that they felt that ye yuan’s strength was weak, easy to bully.

who could have thought that ye yuan’s strength was actually so formidable, taking on five great divine lord powerhouses alone, and actually even killed one?

this kind of strength, who still dared to overlook his existence?

one had to know, these few big shots were not some half-step celestial deities or ninth-layered heaven divine lords. they were just third-layered heaven or fourth-layered heaven divine lords.

even if they were much stronger than ordinary third and fourth-layered heaven divine lords, they also did not dare to overlook an existence like ye yuan.

continuing killing at this rate, apart from both sides sustaining heavy losses, there was no second path to take.

zheng qi snorted coldly and said, “old ignorant thing, you colluded with the fiend race to deal with your compatriots! when everybody gets out of here, i’ll see how you give an account to the people of the world!”

but gao yuan was indifferent as he said coolly, “that will also have to have you be able to go out of here before talking!”

ling zikun naturally did not wish to fight to the bitter end too and stepped forward at this time and said, “since that’s the case, then we’ll cease for the time being. everyone, search for the treasure together! ye yuan, do you have any objections?”

finished talking, he looked at ye yuan.

clearly, ye yuan’s opinion currently occupied a lot of weight.

ye yuan nodded and said, “i have no objections.”

when everyone saw that ye yuan was like so, they all heaved a long sigh in relief.

they came here in order to search for lucky chances and not to risk their lives.

if they did not even see what the treasure looks like, then this life was also lost too worthlessly.

heavenstar said, “since that’s the case, everybody, continue ahead!”

ye yuan said coolly, “if i were you guys, i’d nurse my injuries before advancing.”

heavenstar snorted coldly and said, “brat, why should i listen to you?”

ye yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “then you leave. i don’t wish to court death.”

di en held heavenstar and asked ye yuan, “right now, all of us are ants on the same rope. any ideas you have, why not say it out?”

ye yuan rolled his eyes and said, “you’re the ant! your whole family members are ants! who’s on the same rope as you? don’t think that this little lord doesn’t know what you all are planning. want to scheme against this little lord, no chance!”

di en could not help choking when he heard that. he discovered that this boy was too cunning. it seemed like their thoughts could not hide from the other party at all.

it was naturally impossible for them to let ye yuan go just like that. as long as there was a chance, they would still finish off ye yuan.

it was merely that the most important thing among everything right now was still searching for the treasure, that was how the two races reached a delicate balance.

“just now, those deboning great rats chased and chased and disappeared. it’s not that they couldn’t catch up, it’s definitely because there’s an even more powerful existence here! in reality, we might have already entered another powerful existence’s territory!” ye yuan said.

ye yuan’s words made everyone’s face change.

they ran desperately for their lives just now and did not pay attention to this at all.

now, with ye yuan reminding, they abruptly startled awake.

bang! bang! bang!

his voice had yet to fade when a series of heaven-shaking footsteps came over. an enormous tortoise appeared in front of everyone.

when everyone saw this tortoise, their faces immediately became ugly.

this tortoise’s aura was extremely powerful. it actually looked like late-stage rank four.

if everyone’s strength was not suppressed, they could still deal with it.

but right now, the strongest was also merely gao yuan, this fourth-layered heaven divine lord.

furthermore, he was still injured and could not unleash much strength at all.

“roar!”

an earth-shaking roar came over, shocking the surrounding rocks until it fell.

gao yuan’s expression changed suddenly as he said, “damn it, why would there be such a powerful fierce beast in this abyss!”

heavenstar’s face fell and he said, “the stronger the fierce beast guarding the treasure sure, the more valuable the treasure is! even though this large tortoise is powerful, its reaction is slow. we’ll use speed to shake it off!”

everyone’s eyes lit up when they heard it, but saw that gao yuan already turned into a stream of flowing light, attempting to circle around the large tortoise!

“go!” heavenstar roared and immediately followed after.

at this time, everyone used their means, urging their speed to the limits, attempting to bypass the large tortoise.

zheng qi was just about to move, but saw that ye yuan did not budge an inch, and could not help saying puzzledly, “ye yuan, the treasure shouldn’t be far away. if we still don’t go, it’s going to be snatched by them!”

ye yuan smiled and said, “no rush, this absolute magnetism black tortoise isn’t that easy to deal with.”

zheng qi’s gaze turned intent, looking over with a sidelong glance again.

he saw that absolute magnetism black tortoise suddenly opened its mouth. rays of massive light balls instantly spewed out.

bang! bang! bang!

these light balls were like cannonballs, flying around, blasting until the rocks on both sides fell one after another.

this abyss forcefield was extremely powerful. the rocks fell, its power extraordinary.

“argh!!”

a fiend race powerhouse was struck by a large piece of rock, uttering a scream, and directly fell silent. even his fiend soul did not escape too.

for some time, rocks flew everywhere, sparks flying in all directions.

when the black tortoise raged, blood flowed like rivers[1]!

in a blink, these divine lord realm powerhouses’ casualties became more than half again.

gao yuan and the other powerhouses just ran halfway but retreated at an even faster speed, their expressions being incomparably ugly.

this was really one man guarding the pass, ten thousand were unable to get through.

“what the hell is this? how can it be so strong?” gao yuan said in a solemn voice.

“don’t know, i’ve never seen before either!” heavenstar said with an ugly expression.

“no wonder those deboning great rats didn’t dare to chase after us! it turns out that there’s such a terrifying existence here! even when we’re at our prime, we’re probably not this large tortoise’s match too!” di en said in a solemn.

“damn it, the treasure is about to come into our hands. could it be that we have to turn tail and go back here?” qiao an’s expression was also ugly as he said.

ye yuan said coolly, “absolute magnetism black tortoises are extremely rare and prefer to live in places with strong magnetic fields the most. the origin magnetic field here is what absolute magnetism black tortoises like the most. it can make use of the origin magnetic field and spiritual energy here to create powerful spiritual energy cannons. old man gao, even at your prime, you’re likely not his match in this place too.”

gao yuan gritted his teeth and said, “turns out that you’ve long known about this damn thing! so that’s why you kept quiet and waited! you want to let us be cannon fodders!”

ye yuan rolled his eyes and said, “so what if yes? i wish that you get sprayed to death by it! have i ... concealed it before?”

“you!” gao yuan choked when he heard that, nearly stifling out internal injuries.

“humph! this old man can’t get through, could it be that you can still get through? with such a powerful thing, you and i can forget about getting the treasure!” gao yuan said in a cold voice.

ye yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “you’re thinking too much! you think that if you go over, you can get the treasure?”

gao yuan’s face changed and he said, “what do you mean?”

ye yuan smiled and said, “are you really dumb? or pretending to be really dumb? able to nurture such a powerful fierce beast, how can the treasure born here possibly just be a xiantian divine lord mystic treasure? do you feel that such a treasure can be obtained by you, a measly half-step celestial deity?”

when everyone heard that, their faces could not help changing greatly.

right then, a stream of spiritual energy condensed and formed into an enormous sword, as if coming from beyond the horizon, flying straight for the absolute magnetism black tortoise!

rumble!

the absolute magnetism black tortoise’s massive body was directly chopped and scattered all over the place.
