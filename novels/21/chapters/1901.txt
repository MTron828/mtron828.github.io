Chapter 1905: Doing Something Difficult Effortlessly

Fei Mingtian was angered until he trembled all over, but he was powerless to do anything.

His identity was extraordinary. Once he really made a move, that was thoroughly falling out with the City Lord Manor.

Fei Mingtian gave a cold snort, flicked his sleeves, and left.

But he did not leave. He simply retreated to one side to observe the execution from the sidelines.

“Academy Head Fei, what should we do now?” Li Zian asked.

Fei Mingtian let out a sigh and said, “This matter isn’t easy to handle! Our Kongming Academy is in a disadvantageous situation to begin with. The City Lord Manor is probably ... hoping exactly for us to lose all decorum with them right now!”

Li Zian said, “Then ... what about Ye Yuan? If we don’t save Jiang Jadehall, he probably won’t be willing to drop the matter.”

Fei Mingtian shook his head and said, “I hope that he isn’t rash!”

Time slowly trickled by, there were no signs of Ye Yuan showing up.

Yu Jinsong got somewhat tired of waiting and said coolly, “Carry out execution!”

His subordinate said in a clear voice, “The hour is up, execute!”

The executioner received the order, carried a knife, and came before Jiang Jadehall.

All executioners used special magic weapons to carry out a death sentence.

To Divine Dao powerhouses, even if their heads were chopped off, they would not die either.

Unless one’s comprehension in the power of laws was very deep, wrecking all of their life-force, that was how they could be killed.

The executioner’s strength was not too strong, he naturally did not have this ability.

Yu Jinsong suddenly stood up and said in a clear voice, “Ye Yuan, I know that you’re here. Aren’t you very impressive? So why don’t you dare come out anymore? Or is it that you took a fancy to Jiang Haitang and only saved her and not her father? Gutless coward, come out if you have the capability! Still not coming out, Jiang Jadehall will be dead!”

Jiang Jadehall’s face changed, and he roared angrily, “Ye Yuan, you mustn’t come out! Thank you for saving Haitang, I already have no ties left! They laid down an all-encompassing net, just waiting for you to show up. You mustn’t come out!”

A hint of a cruel smile flashed across the corners of Yu Jinsong’s mouth. Jiang Jadehall’s words would only stimulate Ye Yuan to appear.

“I’m here!” Right at this time, a voice suddenly sounded out.

Except, this voice was too near as if it was beside his ear.

Suddenly, Yu Jinsong felt his scalp tingle. A feeling of incredible danger welled up in his heart and he instinctively wanted to escape.

However, it was already too late!

A figure suddenly appeared beside him, blue fine-lines suddenly wrapped over toward him!

Scheming against the unguarded, how could Ye Yuan give him the chance to escape?

Yu Jinsong fell into the Divine Vestige Space without the slightest surprise!

Very soon, the Divine Vestige Space dissipated. A sword was pressed on Yu Jinsong’s neck.

In this short while, Ye Yuan already sealed Yu Jinsong’s divine sea.

Everyone looked over but discovered that Ye Yuan was actually wearing the outfit of an ordinary city guard on him.

Turns out that he actually hid inside the city guard army.

Furthermore, his target was not Jiang Jadehall at all but Yu Jinsong!

This scene happened too quickly, swift until everyone did not react to it and Yu Jinsong already became a captive.

Yu Jinsong was a Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse. No one would have expected that he actually did not even have the strength to resist and was restrained by Ye Yuan.

The city guards were very near Yu Jinsong. This bit of distance was merely the distance of a blink of an eye to Ye Yuan.

And with Yu Jinsong’s strength, it was impossible for Ye Yuan to succeed with one strike too.

Hence, he had long planned it out, using the Divine Vestige Space to restrain the other party.

This series of means was done in one go, not giving those three great True God powerhouses any time to react at all.

Fei Mingtian looked at Ye Yuan with an astonished look, full of disbelief.

No one could have thought that Ye Yuan would actually think of using such a method to save Jiang Jadehall.

“This boy is bold and meticulous in thinking, his talent surpassing others, truly terrifying!” Fei Mingtian said in shock.

Bang!

Three terrifying auras rose to the sky. The three great True God powerhouses who were lurking nearby finally showed their faces.

The three people surrounded Ye Yuan tightly but did not dare to step forward.

There was an uproar all around. Only then did they know that in order to deal with Ye Yuan, the City Lord Manor actually sent out three True God powerhouses.

Furthermore, one of them was even a Second Firmament True God!

It was just that these three great True God powerhouses did not even have a chance to make a move and Yu Jinsong was already kidnapped from under their eyelids.

This means was simply inconceivable.

Yu Jinsong laid down an all-encompassing net, wanting to capture Ye Yuan. In the end, he failed to capture him and got himself ensnared instead.

The three great True God powerhouses actually became ornaments.

That Second Firmament True God powerhouse said, “Brat, hurry up and let go of Jinsong. I’ll spare you from death!”

Ye Yuan looked at him with eyes like looking at an idiot and immediately gave Yu Jinsong a slap.

Smack!

A crisp sound could be heard clearly in the entire plaza.

Quite a number of people all touched their own faces unwittingly as if this slap was slapped on their faces.

“This slap is dealt for Haitang!” Ye Yuan said coolly, not having the slightest hint of emotion.

A slap landing, half of Yu Jinsong’s face already swelled up badly.

“You ... You dare to hit me?” Yu Jinsong’s words were unclear, his eyes when looking at Ye Yuan was full of disbelief.

Smack!

What answered him was a second slap.

“This slap is for Brother Jiang! These two slaps are tentatively the interest. Your dog-life, I’ll take it. Now, let him go!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

People looked at Ye Yuan with worshiping faces.

Too domineering!

If not for seeing it with their own eyes, they totally would not dare to believe that someone could toy with the entire City Lord Manor in the palm of their hand.

This composure, this strength, this easy accomplishment of a difficult matter as if it was easy, was absolutely not what ordinary people could achieve.

Two slaps thrashed Yu Jinsong until he became a pig head.

Jiang Jadehall looked at Ye Yuan blankly, as if he did not recognize him.

Not seeing for several hundred years, Ye Yuan’s strength was actually horrifying to such a degree already.

After hearing Yu Jinsong’s words, Jiang Jadehall was worried that he implicated Ye Yuan.

But who knew that Ye Yuan actually played something like this, capturing Yu Jinsong to be a hostage.

“Ye Yuan, you can’t escape!” Yu Jinsong said unclearly.

“With you around, why would I not be able to escape?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“L-Letting go of Jiang Jadehall, what if you kill me? I can let go of him, but you must swear a Heavenly Dao Oath that you absolutely can’t kill me!” Yu Jinsong said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Can!”

Ye Yuan did not plan on killing Yu Jinsong in the first place. He also knew that he could not kill him.

Capturing him was just in order to save Jiang Jadehall.

Very soon, Ye Yuan swore the Heavenly Dao Oath. This made Yu Jinsong’s heart ease up.

“L-Let him go!” Yu Jinsong issued the order. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jiang Jadehall’s handcuffs and anklets were released. The him who regained freedom anew felt like he was dreaming.

“Get lost!’ Ye Yuan said to the three great True God powerhouses.

The three great powerhouses were wary in taking action for fear of implications and could only open up a path.

Ye Yuan pushed Yu Jinsong and arrived on the execution grounds, and said to Jiang Jadehall, “Brother Jiang, Ye Yuan came late and let you suffered! I’ve let you and Haitang down.”

Jiang Jadehall shook his head and said, “What’s what I owe you! For you to be able to do things to this extent for Elder Brother, I didn’t become brothers with you in vain!”
