Chapter 2547: You Can’t Kill Him!

“A joke? This Ye doesn’t have the time to tell you jokes! You just say, do you dare or not?! Or, are you, this whatever Eastward alchemy path’s number one person, actually a coward?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The moment these words came out, everyone sucked in a cold breath.

Ye Yuan was considered to have publicly insulted Nation Teacher!

How many years had it been since such a thing had happened?

Lin Lan’s expression also instantly turned sullen.

He clearly knew that Ye Yuan was goading, but the fury in his heart still erupted uncontrollably.

Even His Majesty would not dare to put him on the spot in front of so many people.

An ascender with one point affinity actually dared to insult him so mercilessly.

Furthermore, it was even humiliating him on the Alchemy Dao that he was most proud of!

If this could be endured, what else could not be?

“Huhu,?very good! This nation teacher accepts your challenge! But, if this nation teacher finds out that you’re playing with me and can’t refine heavenly pills at all …”

“If this Ye loses to you, I’ll cripple my own cultivation and the Tang Family will be at your disposal!”

Not waiting for Lin Lan to finish speaking, Ye Yuan directly interrupted his words, not leaving himself the slightest leeway.

What Lin Lan said was that if he could not refine a heavenly pill.

But when it reached Ye Yuan’s mouth, it became would not lose to Lin Lan!

Which was also to say that Ye Yuan had absolute confidence in this alchemy battle!

And these words also directly forced himself to the edge of the cliff!

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Seen before ruthless people, but never seen before such a ruthless one!

However, everyone discerned that Ye Yuan’s words still had a continuation.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan paused for a bit and said in a solemn voice, “But if this Ye wins, what will Nation Teacher do?”

Lin Lan laughed in spite of himself and said, “What qualifications do you have to negotiate terms with this nation teacher?”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “You can’t kill me, but I can kill you in the future! Even if you hide in the royal palace, it’s useless too! So this match, you have to bet!”

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan like looking at a fool. They were all dumbstruck with amazement.

A middle Lesser Sublime Heaven said that he was going to kill Nation Teacher under the encirclement of so many powerhouses.

They were already absolutely sure that this ascender was definitely out of his mind!

Of course, his ability to be funny was also first-rate!

Lin Lan laughed loudly and he said, “You’re saying that this nation teacher is a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse but have to be coerced by you now? What a joke! Do you believe that this nation teacher will kill you right now?”

At this time, Lu Yun suddenly said, “No, this isn’t a joke! You really can’t kill him!”

The moment these words came out, everyone was shocked.

Lin Lan frowned and said, “Lu Yun, don’t you find it ridiculous to speak up for him at this time?”

But Lu Yun shook his head indifferently and said, “This old man isn’t speaking up for him, I’m just stating a fact! Why do you think this old man showed up here? Is a mere middle Lesser Sublime Heaven worth making this old man come forward in person to protect him?”

Lin Lan’s expression changed, immediately feeling something amiss.

Lu Yun did not rush and continued, “Ye Yuan had once sneaked into the royal palace before and strolled around in front of this old man. But this old man didn’t notice it in the slightest! His spatial rule is long already transcendent. You can’t kill him! But he can kill you in the future! Of course, if you don’t believe me, you can attack right now!”

Lu Yun’s words shocked everyone until they stared dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

A middle Lesser Sublime Heaven strolled around under the eyelids of a Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse and he actually did not notice it?

How could this kind of thing possibly happen?

“Too fake! Master Yun must be lying!”

“In order to protect the Tang Family, Master Yun has really gone all out!”

“Telling bald-faced lies this sort of thing, I didn’t expect that Master Yun could do it too!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

… …

No one believed Lu Yun at all, because what he said was too fantastical.

The degree was likely comparable to a one point heavenly alchemist.

One had to know, what Lu Yun said was in front of him, not hiding from his eyes and ears.

A middle Lesser Sublime Heaven stood in front of a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse and he did not notice it at all.

Was it possible?

Lin Lan’s pupils constricted slightly but fell silent.

He understood Lu Yun. Telling a brazen lie this sort of thing, he could not make up this kind of nonsense.

Furthermore, Lu Yun said it too calmly, and it also seemed to have some fear mixed in it.

This subtle emotion was what truly triggered Lin Lan’s nerves.

“Fine! This nation teacher accepts your challenge! Now, state your request!” Lin Lan said.

Everyone was shocked. Nation Teacher actually compromised!

Could it be that what Master Yun said was actually true?

Everyone’s hearts shook wildly!

Ye Yuan pointed at the Tang Family father and son, and said coolly, “Very simple, those who attacked, leave an arm behind, and kneel down and apologize to the Tang Family! Also, you, Lord Nation Teacher, bow and apologize to the Tang Family father and son in front of everyone!”

“Hiss?…”

Another series of the sound of cold air being drawn came over.

Today’s matter blew up!

Making Nation Teacher bow and apologize, even His Majesty did not dare to propose this, right?

This ascender really ate a bear’s heart or leopard’s gall, to actually dare make such a request!

This was offending Nation Teacher to the core!

Even Second Prince’s expression changed too, and he said with a cold yell, “Ye Yuan, that’s too much!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he gave Second Prince a deep glance.

Second Prince’s neck shrunk back, immediately feeling a strong pressure, almost asphyxiating him.

Lu Yun secretly thought to himself that things were not good and hurriedly said, “Young Friend Ye, no matter what decision you make today, this Lu supports you!”

Only then did Ye Yuan’s gaze ease up a little, and he nodded his head slightly to signal it.

Second Prince still wanted to say something but was shot down by Lu Yun with a fierce glare.

Lu Yun naturally knew Second Prince’s thoughts. Nation Teacher was a major favorite in front of His Majesty.

With regards to seizing the throne, a word from Nation Teacher could match ten thousand words that he said!

He held incredible weight!

Offending Nation Teacher was equivalent to severing his own prospects!

When Second Prince saw Ye Yuan make such an overboard request, how could he not be agitated?

However, Lu Yun saw it deeper than him!

Offending Nation Teacher was for sure.

There was no meaning in standing up to say this sort of thing at this time.

If he offended Ye Yuan again because of one sentence, then Second Prince was really finished!

Because Lu Yun felt that the consequences of offending Ye Yuan were even more severe than offending Nation Teacher!

Pick the lesser of two evils!

Therefore, at this time, they had to stand on Ye Yuan’s side even more incomparably firmly!

Make a complete break from Nation Teacher!

Stand side by side with Ye Yuan!

Lu Yun was gambling!

He was gambling that Ye Yuan could become a big shot who would cause a great sensation in Eastward!

Perhaps Ye Yuan’s weight in Eastward in the future would even surpass that of Nation Teacher’s!

Sure enough, Lin Lan gave a cold laugh, his gaze when looking toward Second Prince became extremely indifferent.

Clearly, he already made a decision in his heart.

“Huhu,?so what if I promise you? Could it be that this nation teacher is even afraid of you, a one point affinity ascender? Since it’s a life-and-death wager, this nation teacher will sign an origin divinity contract with you! The person who breaks the contract will be struck dead by heaven!” Lin Lan said in a cold voice.

Since he knew that Ye Yuan’s spatial rule was incredible, Lin Lan was naturally afraid that Ye Yuan would break the contract and flee after his defeat.

As for losing to Ye Yuan, he never thought about it at all.

This was something impossible!

Ye Yuan nodded his head faintly and said, “As it ought to be!”
