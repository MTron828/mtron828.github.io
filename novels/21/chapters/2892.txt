Chapter 2898: Bloodkins Wiped Out, Unprecedented Great Victory!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After being stupefied for a moment, Ye Yuan understood it.

The power of blessing!

After the tribulation clouds merged together, although the power was extremely strong, it was far less pure than before.

This Dao tribulation was completely an indiscriminate attack.

But, in the midst of these over 100 thousand powerhouses, Ye Yuan’s power of blessing was unleashed to the extreme!

This was like aggro value. Ye Yuan’s aggro value was virtually zero under the enhancement of the power of blessing.

The aggro value of over 100 thousand people directly drowned Ye Yuan out!

The Dao tribulation could not find Ye Yuan at all amidst these over 100 thousand people!

Hence, this kind of bizarre scene occurred.

“Yang Qing, come to my side!”

Without waiting for Ye Yuan’s instructions, he already scooted over at once.

“Really seeing ghosts! You’re clearly a divergent cultivator. Why doesn’t the Dao tribulation smite you?” Yang Qing had a look of confusion.

“Enough crap, follow me!”

Finished saymg, Ye Yuan arrived next to a True Sovereign Hundred Son with a lunge.

Boom!

The Dao tribulation landed, and that hundred son turned directly to ashes.

The power of the Dao tribulation around Ye Yuan was extremely strong.

Even if it was a half-step Emperor Realm, they would not be able to withstand it at all too.

The current Ye Yuan, it was like he was standing in the eye of the storm, where the eye was calm and tranquil, but the surrounding storm was extremely terrifying.

Faintly in the unseen world, the Dao tribulation could sense Ye Yuan’s position, descending frenziedly around Ye Yuan.

But it avoided Ye Yuan.

This was fun.

Ye Yuan was like a bomb. Wherever you threw him, that place would become death!

With another lunge, another large group of people died.

Under the chaotic Dao tribulations, these bloodkins would not resist at all.

In fact, they could not even achieve revival from a drop of blood.

Yang Qing stuck closely to Ye Yuan and was completely unscathed.

Seeing this scene, he was excited until he jumped up.

“Hahaha Interesting! Interesting! I didn’t expect that Dao tribulation could still be overcome like this! People can be killed like this! All you ants, receive the punishment of Heavenly Dao!”

Amidst the storm, Yang Qing discovered that he was safe and sound, and he immediately became invigorated.

After taking a trip to the blood race, he also knew how cruel the blood race was.

With regards to hatred toward the blood race, he was no less than Ye Yuan. Being able to kill bloodkins like this, he only felt incomparably invigorated in his heart.

“D-Don’t come over! I, fuck! ARGH!”

“You go away! You f*cker, hurry up and leave!”

“Sniff, sniff, sniff… I beg you, don’t come over!”

When those bloodkins saw Ye Yuan coming over, they were simply about to cry.

When he came, it was equivalent to carrymg a bomb.

The crux was that after the bomb exploded, Ye Yuan was fine!

What else could be more aggrieving than this?

Bloodpromise’s eyes went wide. This was simply freaking cheating!

On what basis?

More than 100 thousand people were all transcending tribulation. On what basis did it not smite Ye Yuan?

Was he not a divergent cultivator?

Didn’t Dao tribulation have extremely high aggro value toward divergent cultivators?

Now, what the hell was this?

Bloodpromise had an impulse to vomit blood right now.

Angering an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse to the point of puking blood, this was simply unimaginable. But he just wanted to puke blood right now. “Bloodpromise, what did you say just now? You look at this, is this called playing with fire and burning oneself? Blood Divine Son His Highness suppresses an era. How could some mere True Sovereign Heavens and Saint

Sovereign Heavens kill him? Hahaha

Feng Xiaotian was delighted to the extreme!

Although this scene was bizarre, when his own people saw it, it was incomparably liberating.

He never dreamed that this hopeless battle would actually turn into such a massacre!

Borrowing the power of Dao tribulation and slaughtering over 100 thousand bloodkins!

This was too wonderful!

This feeling of pleasure was like having consumed some kind of nerve stimulant, making people feel like they were treading on air. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing Bloodpromise’s eyes that had collapsed, Feng Xiaotian felt too liberated.

The power of blessing was the Extreme Medicine Sect’s highest secret. Outsiders did not know.

But it was precisely because of this that everything became even more bizarre and unpredictable.

A divergent cultivator, the Dao tribulation actually did not smite him?

This simply subverted everyone’s understanding!

Heaven One’s main camp, all the soldiers and generals were dumbfounded from watching, cries of marveling echoing throughout.

“This is also too impressive! It turns out that killing bloodkins can be so simple?”

“Simple? Did water enter your head? If you have the ability, try doing it!”

“Who cares whether it’s simple or not, Your Father only wants to yell right now! AHHHHHHHHHH!”

Yes, too excited!

During the past over 20 days, South Qi Giant City was in endless darkness.

Each of them spent these over 20 days like they were in hell.

But, just now, they felt as if they had ascended straight to paradise.

This kind of extreme experience was truly incredible until it was indescribable.

They were excited to the extreme right now.

A whole army of 200 thousand!

They were wiped out just like that by a Saint Sovereign Heaven!

They fought for over 20 days in countless battles of desperation and paid an extremely terrible price, before barely managmg to wipe out 100 thousand bloodkins.

But Ye Yuan alone exterminated an army of 200 thousand bloodkins!

No idea how long had passed either; the tribulation cloud gradually dissipated, and the bloodkins under the tribulation cloud became fewer and fewer.

In the end, not a single one remained.

The blood race army of 130 thousand was completely dissipated into the world just like that.

The whole place was deathly silent.

After the excitement, everyone felt a hair-raising feeling.

Today’s battle was truly a divine stroke of art!

A Saint Sovereign Heaven entrapped an army of close to 200 thousand to death!

This battle could absolutely enter the annals of history!

“Pffft!”

Bloodpromise spewed out a mouthful of old blood, his entire aura suddenly withering significantly.

This was truly anxiety striking the heart.

The impact that today’s scene-by-scene reversal dealt to his mind was too great!

Honestly speaking, Ye Yuan piercing through South Qi Giant City all alone by himself, Bloodpromise already acknowledged this Blood Divine Son in his heart at that time!

But who could have thought that the Blood Divine Son was actually a human?

This made him feel a setback of being played with.

Counting the last time, he had already lost 300 thousand troops in Ye Yuan’s hands!

Fighting with Heaven One these few thousand years, when had their blood race experienced such a terrible defeat before?

In the past, if I could not win, I could revive.

But this time, they did not even have the chance to revive!

Over 300 thousand elites were directly turned into nothingness!

“Kill!”

Just as the blood race Emperor Realm powerhouses’ minds were in deep shock, an explosive yell suddenly transmitted over. Feng Xiaotian brought the Heaven One Emperor Realms and charged right over.

An entire army was completely wiped out, their chief commander puking blood, and the blood race’s momentum had already reached its lowest point.

Even if they were all Emperor Realms, they also felt that life was murky gray at this time.

Feng Xiaotian naturally would not let this chance slip by!

Boom!

Feng Xiaotian’s fists emerged like the wind, blowing up an Emperor Cloud Heaven with one punch!

Heaven One Emperor Realms had an unstoppable momentum!

Blood race Emperor Realms were dispirited and inert!

This battle could not be fought anymore!

“Retreat! Quickly retreat!”

Bloodpromise brought the remaining Emperor Realms and escaped frantically.

Feng Xiaotian pursued at his heels, striking more than a dozen blood race Emperor Realms dead in a row.

He only gave up after Bloodpromise, and the rest escaped into the passageway.

Everything had settled!

“Heaven One is mighty! Ye Yuan is mighty!”

“Heaven One is mighty! Ye Yuan is mighty!”

….

In South Qi Giant City, thunderous cheers arose.

This battle was won too beautifully!

They could not suppress their emotions any longer and completely fell into wild ecstasy..
