Chapter 1711 Aura of Emperor, Surmounting the World!

“It’s Pavilion Lord! He actually wants to meet this kid. Who on earth is he?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Pavilion Lord actually wants to meet a second-layered heaven Divine Lord, I didn’t hear wrongly, right?”

“This ... This is shooting down Grand Elder Tianhua’s face in public! This kid has such incredible face, to actually be worthy of Pavilion Lord personally standing up for him.”

...

For some time, everyone used astonished gazes to look over toward Ye Yuan, trying to guess his identity.

The pavilion lord was not what anyone could meet.

Even if one was a Celestial Deity powerhouse, wanting to meet the pavilion lord was also not an easy thing, let alone a second-layered heaven Divine Lord.

But today, he actually made an exception!

It was very hard for the members of Profound Secrets Pavilion to not guess.

Especially Jian Tianhua, the expression on his face was very ugly.

He also rarely showed face. Today, he finally showed face to suppress Jian Zhentao. But he did not expect that he had his face personally slapped by the pavilion lord.

So many people looking, he, this grand elder, felt a huge loss in face!

But the pavilion lord’s order, he had no choice but to follow.

Jian Shaoning and Jian Ping two people were currently being pleased with themselves, but then they were thrown into bewilderment by the pavilion lord’s one sentence.

What capability did this kid have, to actually be able to have Pavilion Lord personally stand up for him?

“Soon, my Profound Secrets Pavilion will welcome another Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse. It’s to be congratulated. Today, I’ll confer Zhentao the title of grand elder. You have to work hard and strive to break through as soon as possible.”

At this time, the pavilion lord’s voice sounded out once again, making everyone’s faces change color with fright again.

“No way, right? Elder Zhentao is going to be promoted to become a grand elder?”

“Doesn’t that mean that he’s going to break through very soon? I even thought that Elder Zhentao will have no hope of breaking through in this lifetime. I didn’t expect that he actually gained a new lease on life!”

“Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise, indeed not false! His eyes went blind, everyone thought that he’s crippled in this life. Who could have thought that not only did he regain sight, but he will even break through to the Celestial Deity Realm?”

“Elder Shaoning and he fought for more than half their lives. Who could have expected Elder Zhentao to break through first? This is really ironic!”

...

Jian Shaoning’s expression was ugly to the extreme. This painting style changed too quickly.

A moment ago, he even trampled Jian Zhentao into the mud.

Who knew that in the next instant, Jian Zhentao gained a new lease on life, directly trampling him into the ground with one foot.

Since the pavilion lord said so, he definitely divined it long ago!

No one had ever doubted what the pavilion lord said. If he said that Jian Zhentao would break through, he would definitely break through.

Upon entering Celestial Deity Realm, that was a carp leaping over the dragon gate, soaring to the sky in one move.

He would be in a completely different world from him, a mere ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

Fighting for more than half their lives, who could have expected that it was actually such an outcome?

Jian Zhentao himself also had a look of shock, bowing to thank as he said, “Thank you, Pavilion Lord. Zhentao will definitely work hard to cultivate and strive to break through soon!”

However, the pavilion lord’s voice did not sound out again.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Congratulations, Senior!”

Jian Zhentao said joyfully, “Little Friend Ye Yuan, speaking of it, this is really thanks to you! Come, I’ll bring you to go see Pavilion Lord!”

Ye Yuan nodded and followed after.

Jian Tianhua’s expression changed, snorted coldly, and disappeared.

Jian Zhentao brought Ye Yuan and arrived in front of the stairs leading to the third floor.

“Going up from here is the pavilion lord’s dwelling place. You go up yourself. This old man will bring Tianping to wait for you below,” Jian Zhentao said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and went up the stairs himself.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan felt like he passed through a layer of membrane, arriving at another space.

This was a simple and crude hidden chamber, revealing a mysterious ambience all over the place.

A serene-looking old man was currently brewing a pot of spirit tea, the aroma delighting people.

The old man opened his mouth and said with a laugh, “Huhu, I didn’t expect that this old man can actually meet a young man with the aura of emperor surmounting aura in my lifetime, truly an unexpected surprise!”

Ye Yuan looked over toward the old man but discovered that the other party seemed to be entirely covered by a veil of mist, unable to see through at all.

This old man seemed to have fused into one with the surroundings.

Clearly in front of his eyes, but seemed to be extremely far away.

“Emperor surmounting aura?”

Ye Yuan had some doubts. Could it be that this emperor surmounting aura was a kind of destiny too?

Except, didn’t Jian Zhentao say that he was some imperial aura? How did it become emperor surmounting aura?

The old man did an inviting gesture, indicating for Ye Yuan to sit down opposite him, and slowly opened his mouth and said, “Aura of emperor, surmounting the world, name emperor surmounting aura! Those who possess the emperor surmounting aura, their destiny is exceedingly vibrant. Barring no accidents, stepping into the realm of Heavenly Emperor isn’t a big problem!”

Ye Yuan sat down opposite the old man and said with uncertainty, “Pavilion Lord doesn’t seem to have used the aura viewing art, right? How do you know that I am in possession of the emperor surmounting aura?”

The old man smiled and said, “Although imperial aura is strong, how can it make my Jian clan members suffer Heavenly Dao’s backlash? Only emperor surmounting aura, the darling of heaven, can make ordinary Jian clan members suffer this disaster. Actually, when Zhentao returned from Riverluck Capital City, this old man already knew. Moreover, even if this old man doesn’t employ the aura viewing art, I can also see through a thing or two.”

Ye Yuan was surprised in his heart. No wonder Jian Zhentao said that with the pavilion lord’s cultivation method, he understood the mysteries of good fortune.

Seemed like this old man’s strength was indeed unimaginable!

Seeing this, Ye Yuan had some more hope in his heart.

If it was this old man taking action, he might really be able to find Li-er their whereabouts.

“Since Pavilion Lord is already aware long ago, why did you still allow Senior Jian Zhentao to be bullied by people? Even if he can’t see, he’s also a ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord expert. It’s not to the extent of letting him go and raise flowers and grow grass, right?” Ye Yuan said in puzzlement.

The old man smiled and said, “The mystery of heaven’s secrets is incredibly profound. Even if my Jian Family can divine heaven’s secrets, we also can’t change anything. Forcefully meddling in the trajectory of Heavenly Dao will meet with Heavenly Dao’s backlash. If minor, severe injuries and vomiting blood, cultivating falling drastically; if severe, perishing and Dao dissipating, never to reincarnate. The people of my Jian Family who died due to this are goodness knows how many! Therefore, even if we can see each person’s fate clearly, we’re unable to change anything too. Zhentao was tainted by your emperor surmounting aura, breaking through is something sooner or later. These blows are also Heavenly Dao’s tempering to him. Not experiencing this calamity, he will be unable to break through.”

Ye Yuan listened until he was secretly alarmed. He did not expect that there were still so much things revolving around this simple incident.

Ye Yuan said curiously, “In that case, the Jian Family’s members performing divinations for other martial artists everyday, predicting good or bad fortune, wouldn’t they suffer the wrath of heaven every day?”

The old man smiled and said, “Ordinary martial artists, their destinies are very weak and won’t affect the fate of this world. Moreover, members of the Jian Family have their own rules when performing divinations, only saying 20-30%, appearing right but is really wrong. Under most circumstances, there’s no problem. But when a person’s destiny is too strong, members of the Jian Family won’t easily help them perform augury. It was very easy to meet with a backlash if their cultivation is lacking.”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, his expression becoming ugly.

He was the emperor surmounting aura which was even more terrifying than the imperial aura. Didn’t that mean that ... it could not be divined at all?

Ye Yuan said anxiously, “Senior, this ...”

The old man suddenly handed over a cup of tea and said with a smile, “Drink a cup of tea, don’t be anxious.”

How could Ye Yuan not be anxious? In the end, he downed the cup of tea in a single act.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Pavilion Lord, this junior’s loved ones’ fates are unknown. Coming here, I only wish to know their situation. Hope that Pavilion Lord can make an exception! For this, Ye Yuan is willing to pay any price!”
