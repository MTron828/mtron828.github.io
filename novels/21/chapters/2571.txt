Chapter 2577: Break the Legs, Throw Out!

“That’s the inner sect’s number three, Lu Zhanyuan! He … He really came!”

“Heh,?beating a dog, one also needs to look at the owner! Little Cloud Courtyard beat Li Zhuo; it’s smacking Lu Zhanyuan’s face! How can he possibly swallow the insult silently?”

“Little Cloud Courtyard’s master is very mysterious! With two tigers fighting, I wonder who will win and who will lose!”

“What rubbish! Lu Zhanyuan is a grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse! How can that guy who hasn’t even entered the sect yet possibly be his match?”

… …

A large group of people went up Thousand Bird Peak while howling, heading for Little Cloud Courtyard.

This line-up caused a great sensation.

Thousand Bird Peak’s people were virtually all here.

Everyone wanted to see just what kind of person this Little Cloud Courtyard’s master was!

This guy was too mysterious!

Lu Zhanyuan was dressed in blue-white alternating inner-sect attire, looking elegant and suave, classy and natural.

This kind of person carried the halo of the main character.

Wherever he went, he was the center of everyone’s attention.

Just one look and you would be able to recognize him in the crowd.

There were even some inner disciples who followed to watch the show.

Duan Tao and the rest came to inquire, all having worried expressions on their faces.

“I’ve already asked around. Lu Zhanyuan’s strength is extremely strong! Even though he is only at the grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven Realm, even if he encounters a powerhouse who just entered Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, he has the strength to fight too! His strength greatly surpasses his cultivation realm in itself!” Duan Tao said with a solemn face.

Ma Liang’s expression flickered indeterminately and he said, “This … What to do about this? No matter how strong Master Ye is, it’s also impossible to be Lu Zhanyuan’s match!?Sigh,?it’s all our fault!”

Du Qian gritted his teeth and said, “No way! We can’t let Lu Zhanyuan deal with Master Ye! Even if he wants to deal with him, he also has to step over our dead bodies!”

Finished saying, his face revealed a hint of a decisive look.

Li Zhuo was carried over by people, but he had an excited look, his eyes giving off light.

How long had it been since he, Li Zhuo, had been beaten up by someone until like this?

The person who beat him had to pay the price!

“Come, men! Kick the door open for me!” Li Zhuo shouted.

Bang!

A lackey gave a kick and directly busted Little Cloud Courtyard’s door open.

Li Zhuo said in a clear voice, “The people inside, listen up! The inner sect’s number three, Lord Lu Zhanyuan, has arrived in person. Why haven’t you all come out to greet in prostration?”

No one acknowledged him!

Lu Zhanyuan’s brows furrowed slightly, clearly very unhappy already.

Li Zhuo already reported his name, but the people inside actually did not even let out a fart. Clearly, they thought nothing of him.

Li Zhuo sneered in his heart. He understood his master too well.

Little Cloud Courtyard’s master was so arrogant. So his master must already be greatly enraged. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The more furious his master was, the more severe the consequences!

“Impudent! You, a fellow who hasn’t even entered the sect yet, why haven’t you come out to kneel in prostration after seeing an inner disciple?” Li Zhuo said in a great rage.

Behind Lu Zhanyuan, the people all drew a breath of cold air.

This Little Cloud Courtyard’s master was really too domineering!

That was Lu Zhanyuan, but he actually did not even acknowledge him!

Sure enough, Lu Zhanyuan’s expression became grimmer and grimmer.

Even with his back facing everyone, they still felt a massive aura.

Being the inner sect’s number three did not come from boasting!

“Heh,?your esteemed self really has such haughty airs! I, Lu Zhanyuan, came to this puny little Thousand Bird Peak, and you actually dare to not come out and greet! No matter who’s inside, come out now and kneel down and apologize. Then this matter will be considered over! Otherwise, if this Lu takes action, the severity will be hard to say!”

Lu Zhanyuan suppressed his fury to his utmost, but everyone could feel his wrath at this time.

At this time, a figure walked out of the side room, it was precisely Lin Lan.

He said to Lu Zhanyuan coolly, “My master isn’t seeing guests, leave! He said that no matter who it is, as long as they step into the courtyard … break the legs and throw out!”

Break the legs, throw out!

These words were unbelievably domineering!

But it also had to depend on who it was said to!

The other party was the inner sect’s number three, Lu Zhanyuan!

People looked at Lin Lan like looking at a mad man.

An inner disciple shook his head and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “It’s over. Senior Apprentice Brother Lu is going to go utterly berserk! This courtyard’s master is really a lunatic, to even dare provoke Senior Apprentice Brother Lu too!”

“Huhu,?he probably doesn’t know what kind of existence inner sect’s number three is! Postured too hard!” Another person shook his head and said with a sigh.

At this time, Lu Zhanyuan was already beyond furious.

Everyone felt that a volcano was about to erupt.

“Huhu,?is that so? Then today, this Lu will barge into this Little Cloud Courtyard and take a look whether this place is a dragon’s lair or tiger’s den or not!” Lu Zhanyuan laughed from extreme fury.

His foot also strode out and stepped into the courtyard.

But at this time, several figures suddenly dashed out.

“Senior Apprentice Brother Lu, if you want to step into the courtyard, step over our dead bodies!” The one talking was precisely Ma Liang.

“Senior Apprentice Brother Lu, I beg you to raise your hand high in mercy. Don’t haggle over it with Master Ye!” Du Qian also said with a decisive look.

No one expected that these few people actually dared to jump out at this time.

“Get lost!”

Lu Zhanyuan roared, the few people spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly and were directly sent flying out.

The inner sect’s number three was utterly terrifying!

He did not even make a move. Just based on a sound wave, he sent the grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven Duan Tao flying!

Lu Zhanyuan completely ignored the few people and stepped right into the courtyard.

He looked at Lin Lan and said with a sneer, “This Lu entered now. I want to see just how you break my legs!”

As he said, he took another step forward and closed in on Lin Lan.

Everyone’s breathing became ragged.

They were all anxious!

Not that they were anxious about Lu Zhanyuan’s legs being broken but anxious whether or not he would dismantle Little Cloud Courtyard under his rage.

How could breaking Lu Zhanyuan’s legs be possible?

Lu Zhanyuan closed in on Lin Lan step by step. However, Lin Lan did not move a muscle all along, as if he did not have the intention to make a move.

“Huhu,?still not making a move? If you still don’t make a move, this Lu will be attacking! Once this Lu takes action, it won’t be breaking legs so simple!” Lu Zhanyuan said with a cold laugh.

His aura grew stronger and stronger, the terrifying pressure made the faces of everyone present change abruptly.

But right at this time, Lu Zhanyuan’s footsteps stopped, his eyes becoming wide-saucers.

That terrifying aura dissipated in an instant.

Thud!

Lu Zhanyuan fell in front of Lin Lan just like that, twitching non-stop.

Twitching and twitching …

Lu Zhanyuan’s eyes and mouth were askew, his entire person like having an epileptic seizure.

It was exactly the same as Zhao Kun back then!

Windward Topple!

It was true that Lu Zhanyuan was strong, but he had not reached Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum after all!

As long as one did not reach Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, Windward Topple was an absolute kill!

Outside the courtyard, everyone’s eyeballs popped out.

Death-like silence!

The powerful inner sect’s number three, Lu Zhanyuan, was actually spasming?

Lin Lan looked at Lu Zhanyuan who fell to the ground and shook his head and said with a sigh, “Master said to break the legs and throw out. So it means breaking the legs and throwing out! Do you think that Master was joking with you?”

Finished speaking, Lin Lan took action, directly breaking Lu Zhanyuan’s legs.

Thud!

He casually lifted, directly throwing Lu Zhanyuan out of Little Cloud Courtyard.

Everyone shuddered all over as if this sound was knocking on their hearts.
