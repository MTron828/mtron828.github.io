Chapter 1467 Thrusting a Spear to the Back!

At the main camp of the fiend race’s army, when Great General Sandcliff saw the message, his face was grim to the extreme.

“Xiu Lie this fool, to actually fail to even handle this minor thing! For the sake of this battle today, Eminent Orchid Imperial City has prepared for as long as several decades! I said that he can’t take on this heavy responsibility, but His Excellency wouldn’t listen! Ahhhhhh, infuriating this old man to death!” Sandcliff roared.

The subordinates were all silent like cicadas in winter, not daring to say anything.

Great General Sandcliff would suddenly turn hostile and pretend not to know old friends in his rage.

“Great General, now that it played out like this, we can only attack by force! Fortunately, the tail over there has already been dealt with cleanly. The army will go over from Fiend Calling Ridge unceasingly. The north city’s defense is much weaker than the south city. As long as we can tie down sufficient military strength, we can breach the city all the same!”

The one talking was Sandcliff’s most trusted army advisor. At this time, only he dared to speak. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Sandcliff snorted coldly and said, “This damn fool, after capturing the city, Your Father will definitely show him some colors! Pass orders to the army, immediately attack the city!”

“Yes!”

The moment the generals heard, they immediately accepted the order and left.

...

At the same time, inside Tiderain City’s City Lord Manor, Commander Wang and Great General Guo Changmin were currently listening to Zhao Bin’s military report.

Zhao Bin endured his injuries and recounted what he saw and heard in the forest once more, then kept quiet.

Guo Changmin was as steady as a mountain, without joy nor sorrow. Musing for a moment after he heard the report, he asked Wang Yifeng, “How do you view this matter?”

Wang Yifeng had clearly long pondered over it already and immediately said, “Zong Tao’s words are also not unreasonable. The fiend race has always been cunning. We’ve suffered quite a bit of loss before too. Not ruling out the possibility that they deliberately want to disperse our military strength. But ... I feel that it’s necessary to be on guard!”

Hearing this, Zhao Bin also heaved a sigh in relief.

Guo Changmin slowly said, “This matter, wait until that Ling Feng comes back before talking. If the intel is true, Yifeng, your Third Army will temporarily organize a defense for south city and strengthen south city’s defenses!”

Wang Yifeng answered, “Yes!”

Right then, there was a subordinate who came to report again, “Great General, a large group of fiend race army suddenly appeared outside the city and are already sieging the walls!”

Came so quickly!

Hearing this news, the faces of everyone including Guo Changming all changed drastically.

The fiend race army’s appearance was too sudden. They did not receive any news at all!

Guo Changmin said in a solemn voice, “How many people are there?”

That subordinate said, “A large dense swarm; too many to count! Preliminary estimates are no lesser than 300 thousand people no matter what!”

Hiss ...

Everyone all sucked in a breath of cold air.

An army on the scale of 300 thousand people, this kind of battle had not happened for a long time.

Looks like this time, the fiend race came prepared!

There were only 80 thousand elites in Tiderain City, but the fiend race had at least 300 thousand people. This was bound to be a dreadful battle!

“Pass down the orders, all legions are to immediately await orders to defend the enemy from the city! Yifeng, your legion will divide out half of its troops and garrison north city! Immediately send people to Kangding City and request for reinforcements ...”

Although Guo Changmin was shocked, he did not panic. One order after another was issued out.

...

Fiend Calling Ridge, by the cliff, Xiu Lie left behind a hundred-man team to receive the fiend race army coming from the back.

“Really saw ghosts! I heard that Eminent Orchid Imperial City spent a huge price in order to craft these flying boats, transferring over a hundred pieces of magnetic divine stones from other imperial cities at a king’s ransom! Originally thought that we can directly capture Tiderain City with an army suddenly appearing out of nowhere. I didn’t expect to get off on the wrong foot, to actually be detected by the humans!”

“You didn’t see Lord Xiu Lie’s expression, it was simply going to kill people!”

“If it were me, I would also want to kill people! After Tiderain City is captured, Lord Xiu Lie can’t dispense with suffering Lord Sandcliff’s criticizing and ridiculing.”

“I can’t understand until now, just who Mu Feng they all encountered, to actually have not a single one escape!”

...

Two fiend race captains were currently chatting away, very puzzled by the leaking of the intel.

The originally seamless plan actually failed miserably at a simple task. How could it not make people depressed?

At this time, a figure suddenly slowly walked out and said with a slight smile on his face, “Looks like you all are very interested. Why not ... I’ll tell you guys!”

Those fiend soldiers were all suddenly startled awake, greatly astonished by a human’s appearance.

That centurion’s brows furrowed, feeling that this person before his eyes was rather familiar.

Suddenly, his eyes revealed a look of horror as he said in disbelief, “You ... You’re one of the humans who jumped off the cliff! How is this possible?! How can you possibly show up here?”

This hundred-man team was Xiu Lie’s personal guard. This centurion was the one who followed by Xiu Lie’s side previously.

Far away, he saw Ye Yuan and Ling Feng jump off the cliff, that was why he would feel that he looked familiar.

But this should have been a dead person originally, how could he possibly show up here?

When the others heard the centurion’s words, each and every one all revealed astonished looks.

It had been unheard of that someone who jumped off the natural chasm could still come back alive!

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Dead men don’t need to know so much!”

The centurion’s gaze turned intent and he said with a cold sneer, “Dead men? Just the likes of you, an initial-stage Heaven Glimpse? Although I don’t know how you came up, you’re probably mistaken. I, this centurion, am not an ordinary centurion!”

The centurion’s aura released, erupting with a powerful aura. He was actually a late-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouse!

Ordinary centurions were only middle-stage Heaven Glimpse, but the strength of Xiu Lie’s personal guards were a notch above ordinary soldiers.

“Hahaha ... ignorant human, are you cracking a joke? Us personal guards, each one can fight one versus ten. You actually dared to come back to deliver yourself to death!”

“Are you trying to tell us that Mu Feng they all were killed by you? Let me tell you, us captains, any one that randomly comes out can eradicate their squads!”

“Humans are indeed stupid, thinking that they are terrific with a bit of strength. To actually dare come and provoke us, really making people die of laughter!”

...

Those few captains all revealed contemptuous looks, looking at Ye Yuan with disdainful expressions.

These captains’ strengths were not ordinary. Some were even middle-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses.

One initial-stage Heaven Glimpse challenging a hundred-man team, furthermore, they were even elites among elites, this was simply a joke.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s all the same to me! Sending Ling Feng away, I can finally let my hands and legs loose and kill.”

Ye Yuan slowly took out the Evil Extermination Sword, his figure instantly vanishing from where he was.

Pfft!

A captain’s head immediately exploded. Even his fiendish essence did not have time to escape.

The moment he made his move, it killed a middle-stage Heaven Glimpse captain!

The centurion’s gaze sharpened, finally realizing Ye Yuan’s prowess.

“This brat isn’t simple, attack together!” the centurion said somberly.

Ye Yuan grinned and casually sent out several Sundering Stars.

Puu, puu, puu ...

Several fiend race soldiers’ bodies directly exploded, instantly being garroted by the sword energy.

Ye Yuan’s one person and one sword swept through among this hundred-man team akin to a no-man zone!

The more the centurion fought, the more alarmed he became. Was this really a weak human martial artist?

Looking at the hundred-man team’s numbers rapidly reducing, the centurion’s heart sunk to rock-bottom.

Suddenly, the centurion’s gaze turned intent, his eyes revealing a look of shock.

Ye Yuan broke through!
