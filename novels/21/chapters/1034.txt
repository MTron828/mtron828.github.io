Chapter 1038: Alright, Kneel Down Then

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Rumble!

Half of the wall behind Gu Yue collapsed with a loud bang!

But Jian Wushuang’s brows furrowed slightly. His face carried a hint of a shock as he said, “Merging into heaven and earth!”

And right then, Ye Yuan’s figure slowly appeared not far away. His hand was still grabbing Gu Yue’s collar.

Ye Yuan loosened his hand, and Gu Yue plopped down onto the ground. His two eyes were staring wide-open. Clearly, he still had not come back to his senses.

That instant just now, he even thought that he was dead for sure.

Now, he knew that he bet correctly!

Lord Qingyun Zi really made a move and saved him!

“Pretty well done!” Ye Yuan’s nonchalant voice transmitted into his ears, akin to a heavenly melody.

At this time, Ao Qian and the rest also came out in an instant, and they guarded around Ye Yuan’s side.

Jian Wushuang sized Ye Yuan up with a glance and suddenly let out a huge laugh and said, “Hahaha ... the exalted peak Alchemy Emperor, Qingyun Zi, actually ended up in such a plight! Didn’t expect, oh, really didn’t expect it! Perhaps this is called, heaven has eyes, right? Don’t you guys think so? Hahaha ...”

Seeing Ye Yuan change a body, furthermore, only had First Level Dao Profound strength at present, the delight in his heart welled up limitlessly, making him smile until he grinned from ear to ear.

Nothing was more satisfying than seeing one’s enemy encountering difficulties.

Ye Yuan did not speak. He just watched him laugh quietly like that.

Actually, only he was laughing too.

In this Cloudmarsh City, everyone was firstly excited by Ye Yuan’s return, and secondly sympathetic. Nobody would mock him at all.

As for those subordinates that Jian Wushuang brought over, each and every one of them also laughed along. It was just that so many people surrounding and watching, their laughter appeared very dry.

Finally, Jian Wushuang also realized that he was like a clown, before gradually ceasing the laughter.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said smilingly, “Laughed enough? If you had your fill of laughter, bring your men and get lost then. Don’t look for trouble yourself.”

Jian Wushuang’s face turned black. He discovered that he forever could not find that sense of accomplishment in front of Ji Qingyun!

He had clearly met with a misfortune currently, why was he still being mocked by him?

“Ji Qingyun, you don’t think that the current you can dismiss me with just a word, right? You’re merely a homeless dog right now. Even if I don’t kill you, do you think that Ji Canglan will let you go? Or perhaps, do you think I’ll let you off so easily today?” Jian Wushuang said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Otherwise?”

Jian Wushuang suddenly discovered that he forever could not keep his cool in front of Ye Yuan. In comparison, he was always suppressed by Ji Qingyun.

Thinking about this, Jian Wushuang could not help switching to a smiling face as he said, “We’ve also not met for a long time. The day we met again feels as if a lifetime has passed. Don’t you feel that we should have a good talk about the old days and settle the scores?”

“Am I very close to you? If you still don’t get lost, don’t blame me for not being courteous anymore!” Ye Yuan said very calmly.

“Haha, I want to see just how our Lord Qingyun Zi can be discourteous to me! Could it be by relying on that group of trash behind you?” Jian Wushuang said with a loud laugh.

Hearing Ji Wushuang’s words, the faces of Ao Qian and the rest all turned black.

Especially Ao Qian, how formidable of an existence was he back then? Now, he was actually looked down upon by a junior like so. This simply made him explode with anger.

But speaking of which, his current strength might even be inferior to Ruan Shuangzhou’s, let alone talk about Jian Wushuang.

“Junior, if this old can recover my strength, I’ll definitely tear that mouth of yours!” Ao Qian gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Jian Wushuang said with a loud laugh, “You this old fellow should enter a coffin already! Today, this seat can send you on your way.”

Ye Yuan secretly heaved a sigh in his heart. Each and every one of these fellows, how many years has it been, no changes at all.

Zuo Qing was like that, Jian Wushuang was similarly like so.

Could it be that they just could not be a little more mature?

Speaking of which, they were plenty old already, but were still like snotty children, like to go around posturing.

“Fine then. Today’s matter has nothing to do with them. Don’t you want to find trouble with me? What do you want to do, state your intention,” Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned when he heard that and immediately burst into laughter and said, “Haha, what did I hear? The exalted Lord Qingyun Zi actually lowered his head to me? Did you guys see that? Did you guys see that?”

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s appearance of a despicable person realizing his ambition, the people surrounding and watching also showed indignant looks.

“Sigh, really a tiger landing in a plain gets bullied by dogs! Recalling when Lord Qingyun Zi was at the height of his power back then, although he was not adept in martial strength, his divine soul mystic arts reached the acme of perfection. Even Void Mystic experts might not gain any advantage at his hands! But now ...”

“Truly a villain intoxicated by success! Back then, Jian Wushuang was pummeled by Lord Qingyun Zi until he cried his lungs out.”

“How could the Spirit Snow Divine King possibly take fancy of this guy? Unless she’s blind! In my view, Spirit Snow Divine King and Lord Qingyun Zi, that’s a match made in heaven!”

These people’s words transmitted into Jian Wushuang’s ears. He was enraged until he trembled all over. But a large group of martial artists already gathered at the scene. He could not possibly kill off one by one either. He could only cast all of his anger on Ye Yuan.

“Ji Qingyun, kneel down and kowtow for this seat today. If this seat feels happy, I might really let you go. Hahaha ...” Jian Wushuang said with a loud laugh.

Jian Wushuang completely believed that Ye Yuan was really afraid of him, that was why he would compromise out of consideration for the general interest.

After all, the way he saw it, Ye Yuan’s First Level Dao Profound strength was completely inadequate to post the least bit of threat to him.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Alright, you start kowtowing then. No need for many, three will do. Then bring your people and scream, this young master will be able to forgive you.”

Jian Wushuang’s smile involuntarily stiffened and his face turned black as he pointed at Ye Yuan furiously and said, “Ji Qingyun, you tricked me!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Don’t you know that Ji Canglan already stepped into Void Mystic, while you actually haven’t broken through yet? Want to become this young master’s opponent, you also got to at least learn from Ji Canglan. Your current bit of ability is also fit to be arrogant in front of this young master?”

Jian Wushuang’s entire body shook from anger. Why had he not broken through to Void Mystic? Wasn’t it still thanks to Ye Yuan?

For so many years, Ji Qingyun had always been his inner-demon. He was already stuck at the gates of Void Mystic for very long. But every time he almost broke through, Ji Qingyun’s shadow could not be wiped away.

Therefore, that was why he would come to the Immemorial Medicine Garden this time, wanting to find an opportunity to break through.

It was just that he never thought that he would encounter the Ji Qingyun who reincarnated the moment he came!

“Very good. I want to see on what basis a First Level Dao Profound dares to be so wildly arrogant!”

Jian Wushuang’s longsword swung. A terrifying sword intent headed for Ye Yuan grandly.

But right at the same time, a terrifying energy undulation also spread out from Ye Yuan there.

Ye Yuan already took out a fire rod at goodness knows when. An outrageous strength gushed out and was actually even stronger than his sword intent!

Rumble!

Caught by surprise, Jian Wushuang was directly smashed out far away. He vomited a mouthful of blood. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Since you knew that I came back, didn’t you hear that I have a divine artifact in possession?” Ye Yuan look at Jian Wushuang with pity and said coolly.
