Chapter 2015: Overbearing Empyrean

“Although I don’t know what that grandmaster token is, Lord Ye Yuan seems to be very incredible.”

“More than incredible! That is Empyrean Flutterfeather! Empyrean Flutterfeather is actually conversing as an equal with our lord!”

“Hehe, I feel that before long, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City will be able to become the Southern Border’s eighth great peak alchemy holy land.”

...

Inside the present Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, there were quite a number of Four-star and Five-star Alchemy Gods. They naturally would not be foreign to Empyrean Flutterfeather.

When Empyrean Flutterfeather appeared, each and every one of them was incredibly shocked.

But later on, something that surprised them even more happened.

Empyrean Flutterfeather was actually conversing with Ye Yuan as an equal. What kind of honor was this?

One had to know, even for ordinary Empyrean powerhouses, Empyrean Flutterfeather was also not someone they could simply meet and talk with.

Today’s Heavenly Eagle Imperial City thoroughly exploded.

This kind of sense of honor was considered to have been completely rooted in their blood.

Ye Yuan sized the grandmaster token up, but spread his two hands out and said, “Senior Flutterfeather, I really want to go, but you take a look ... With this current situation, I can’t go no matter what.”

Everyone’s gaze collectively focused on Cang Yang. His expression instantly became very ugly.

At this time, Jian Sutao who had been silent all along suddenly waved his hand at Cang Yuan and said, “It’s none of your business here anymore. You can go back.”

Cang Yuan’s expression changed and he said, “Empyrean Sutao, although your status is venerated, don’t forget that this place is Lord Extreme Nether’s territory! You’re bullying people too far being like this!”

As a middle-stage Empyrean Realm powerhouse, Cang Yuan had always been high and mighty.

But today, he felt an unprecedented humiliation.

In the sky above a puny little imperial city!

This place was clearly Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether’s territory, but he was actually being commanded as others pleased.

It was just that Jian Sutao was not so easygoing.

He snorted coldly and suddenly flicked his sleeves grandly. A tremendous force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas crushed over toward Cang Yuan.

Cang Yuan’s face changed, immediately mustering up a move to meet the enemy.

But upon contact with this tremendous force, Cang Yuan’s world domain and martial technique instantly fell apart.

Bang!

Cang Yuan’s figure flew out backward. His chest was already stained full of fresh blood.

“Humph! Who the hell do you think you are? To dare speak to this Empyrean this way? Forget about you, even Brother Extreme Nether will also have to give this Empyrean some face. If not for being in Brother Extreme Nether’s territory, do you think that you can still stand here alive?” Jian Sutao said with a cold snort.

Lu Yan, Deng Yunzai, and Dai Chunhao, these three people, did not even dare to breathe loudly at this time.

Late-stage Empyrean Realm was seriously too strong!

Even Cang Yuan could not block a casual strike of Jian Sutao’s too.

If they went forward, he would blow them to death with one puff.

Cang Yuan had a deathly white face, clearly already sustained heavy injuries.

Jian Sutao said coolly, “Concerning Brother Extreme Nether, this Empyrean and Flutterfeather have already gone over. This Heavenly Eagle Imperial City will be Ye Yuan’s territory in the future. If someone comes here and the person acts wildly, that means the person is becoming enemies with this Empyrean. They will have to weigh themselves over! Now, you guys can get lost!”

The faces of Cang Yuan and the rest changed, not expecting that Jian Sutao and Empyrean Flutterfeather actually went to find Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether for a measly little Ye Yuan!

Was this kid really that incredible?

At this very moment, continuing to stay would also be asking for trouble.

Cang Yuan gritted his teeth and said, “Let’s go!”

Finished talking, the void rippled. Cang Yuan’s figure disappeared.

How could Lu Yan three people still dare to remain there? They immediately escaped into the void running away.

The moment these few people left, thunderous cheers erupted in the city.

Today’s fight was fought too satisfyingly!

Those proud sovereigns of great imperial capitals and bodhidharmas also could not do anything to them.

Furthermore, after today, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would be an independent kingdom in reality as well as in name.

With a ruler that loved his people like Ye Yuan, how could they not cheer?

Seeing the performance of the martial artists in the city, even Jian Sutao and Empyrean Flutterfeather, these super powerhouses, were also all incomparably shocked.

They did not think that Ye Yuan’s prestige in this imperial city was actually so high.

The cheers of those martial artists that came from the bottom of their hearts could not be faked.

They genuinely supported Ye Yuan and were not being perfunctory.

This kind of situation was virtually very hard to see in other cities.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists to the group of Empyreans and said, “Seniors coming to help from a long way away, this Ye is endlessly grateful. In the future, if there’s any issue where you have a need for this Ye, feel free to speak up. This Ye absolutely won’t refuse.”

Empyrean Chaoyuan chuckled and said, “Little Friend Ye Yuan is too courteous! This Empyrean heard Song Yu mention that you defended them to the death inside the Ancient God Battlefield. Otherwise, they would have long perished, their Dao dissipating. More importantly, that kid actually broke through to the emperor surmounting aura. Just based on this, this Empyrean will also have to make this trip!

“Isn’t that so? Guo Jingyang this brat, I thought that it would already be pretty good if he could rise to peak imperial aura. Who knew that this kid directly broke through to the emperor surmounting aura, hahaha!” Empyrean Fivepeaks laughed loudly and said.

Although the few Empyreans said it like that, they were already long overjoyed in their hearts.

Being able to build good relations with such a monstrous alchemy master by coming out this time, it was also considered worth it.

Although they were all Empyrean powerhouses, they were the same as Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, they also needed rank six divine pills!

More importantly, with Ye Yuan’s terrifying talent and him conversing as equals with Empyrean Flutterfeather, how horrifying was his alchemy strength?

In the future, as long as he broke through to the Empyrean Realm, wouldn’t he be a proper Seven-star Alchemy God?

Such an existence, being able to build good relations was naturally all that they could wish for.

Otherwise, how could those Heavenly Emperor powerhouses give Empyrean Flutterfeather face?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Seniors are too polite. At the Ancient God Battlefield, that sort of place, we should help each other. If seniors don’t dislike Heavenly Eagle, why not have a sit in the City Lord Manor and drink a cup of coarse alcohol before leaving.”

Empyrean Chaoyuan smiled and said, “Although the city is small, it accommodates you, this great buddha! Gentlemen, go over and have a sit?”

Empyrean Skyhowl laughed and said, “Of course, of course! Master Ye Yuan’s wine naturally isn’t an ordinary product, how can this Empyrean miss it?”

Seeing their lord address these Empyrean powerhouses as brothers, the martial artists in the city felt even more proud of themselves.

Ye Yuan smiled and said to Bai Tong, “Brother Bai, I’ll have to trouble you to bring the seniors to the City Lord Manor and let them sample the Dreamlike Wine that I stashed away.”

Bai Tong nodded slightly and said to the few people, “Gentlemen, please follow me.”

After the few people left, there was only Ye Yuan, Jian Sutao, and Empyrean Flutterfeather left outside of the city.

Jian Sutao looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “This time, it’s considered to have repaid your favor, right?”

Regarding Jian Sutao’s appearance, Ye Yuan was also very surprised.

He even thought that Jian Sutao had very deep resentment toward him. He did not expect that he actually personally came forward this time to look for Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether.

In the future, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would be considered to no longer have future troubles.

“Huhu, what’s Senior saying? The favor this time, Ye Yuan has received it,” Ye Yuan said with clasped hands.

He, Ye Yuan, had always made clear distinctions between gratitude and resentment. The matter last time was indeed Jian Sutao who went too far. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

But in the end, he was Jian Hongxiao’s father-in-law. Ye Yuan naturally would not haggle over it too much.

Taking action this time, Jian Sutao was indeed a great help.

This favor, Ye Yuan naturally had to receive it.
