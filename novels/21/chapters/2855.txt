Chapter 2861 Who Asked You to Posture!

Yang Qing was really bloated! He felt like he was a balloon, being inflated with air at a very rapid rate!

Ta

This heavenly pill was too amazing!

Boom!

At the place where Yang Qing was standing, space exploded. Stones flew everywhere.

Under Luo Hao’s saber, there was no chance to get lucky at all.

“Dead?”

“Definitely dead! No matter how amazing the heavenly pill is, it’s also impossible to skyrocket instantly! There has to be a process to digest the medicinal strength!”

cess

“True! Ye Yuan must have come at this time deliberately. Either way, Yang Qing will be dead too. We also can’t investigate what kind of heavenly pill he consumed. Indeed a divine scam, to be able to scam his teammate like this!”

How swift and fierce was Luo Hao’s saber?

This saber of his was simply a miracle in the eyes of others!

Hence, Yang Qing had to die!

But there were still many Emperor Realm powerhouses present. However, their expressions were unprecedentedly solemn. “Break, break, break!”

On the life-and-death stage, an angry roar suddenly came over. Yang Qing’s figure appeared again, his entire body dyed in blood!

Clearly, Luo Hao’s move earlier had already inflicted heavy wounds on him.

However, he ultimately still relied on the Infinite Comprehensive Pill and evaded it!

Although seriously wounded, his aura was rising crazily, and his realm actually directly broke through to upper True Sovereign Heaven.

Furthermore, this realm was still increasing rapidly!

His strength was skyrocketing, rising sharply in all aspects!

Physical body, divine essence, power of rules, so on and so forth.

Everyone was stunned!

Yang Qing actually evaded it?

He was clearly not an opponent who could last one exchange with Luo Hao. How could he avoid this blade?

The Infinite Comprehensive Pill was so amazing?

Yes, it was even more incredible than they imagined!

Because when Ye Yuan was refining the pill, some mutation even happened.

His power of blessing activated!

The medicinal effect of this Infinite Comprehensive Pill was ten times that of ordinary profound grade heavenly pills! The powerful medicinal strength directly poured into Yang Qing’s body, seemingly opening up the water gates of his realm, rising crazily!

Furthermore, Yang Qing was in a very mysterious state currently.

Originally, he could not keep up with Luo Hao.

But now, Luo Hao’s every movement and action was within his grasp.

The reason why he was seriously wounded was that his bodily functions could not keep up with Luo Hao.

But he still barely managed to avoid it.

“Humph! So what if you took the Infinite Comprehensive Pill? I won’t give you the chance to refine the medicinal effect!”

Luo Hao gave a cold snort, the saber momentum rising again!

Hence, he unleashed his blade frenziedly!

Each saber slash was stronger than the last! On the life-and-death stage, it was saber images everywhere, bedazzling people’s eyes. But Luo Hao was panicking! Saber had saber momentum. A powerhouse like Luo Hao naturally knew how to utilize saber momentum even more.

With each saber slash after another, his imposing momentum would rise to a very terrifying realm.

Even the ranked one Cao Dian would not dare to let him accumulate saber momentum at his discretion too! But his saber actually got further and further away from Yang Qing! “Luo Hao is impressive! This grandson is definitely going to die without a burial ground!”

“Well-deserving of being the number one saber in True Sovereign! Luo Hao, finish him off!”

“Hahaha … What rubbish Infinite Comprehensive Pill, too weak! Too weak!”

……

Those True Sovereign Heavens and Saint Sovereign Heavens did not know the inner reason. Seeing Luo Hao’s saber momentum get stronger and stronger, they cheered him on frenziedly. However, the face-slapping came so quickly!

Boom! Amidst the saber images, a streak of black light suddenly appeared! The saber images that filled the sky dissipated with a loud bang.

Luo Hao’s body directly collided with the protection screen like a kite with a broken string.

Yang Qing stood holding his spear, his imposing momentum surging to the sky, being incredibly domineering!

Although he sustained rather severe injuries, it was like he had been reborn anew at this time.

That Sovereign Azuresky, who considered himself without equal in the world, had returned again!

Yang Qing pointed at Luo Hao with his long spear and said indifferently, “What rubbish number one saber in True Sovereign, weak to the max! From today onwards, Your Father is the number one spear in True Sovereign! No, wait, it’s number one in True Sovereign! If you’re not convinced, feel free to come and challenge, Your Father will receive it all! Just the likes of you trash also dare to posture in front of this sovereign, it serves you right to get slapped! Hahaha, Cao Dian, after I kill Luo Hao, do you dare to fight or not?” The current Yang Qing was inflated to the extreme.

He felt that he was already invincible under the heavens!

This Infinite Comprehensive Pill was too amazing!

Too amazing!

Ever since stepping onto Heaven One Continent, he no longer had that feeling of looking down upon the world in the past.

But now, he finally regained this feeling.

The king was undefeated!

His strength had soared several hundred times over!

Furthermore, it was an all-around improvement!

His cultivation realm, he already reached grand completion True Sovereign Heaven!

His physical body, it similarly reached grand completion True Sovereign Heaven!

His origin divinity, it was also grand completion True Sovereign Heaven!

Even in terms of power of rules, he achieved mastery, with Spear Dao and power of rules reaching peak rank six at the same time!

The crux was that the soaring in strength did not let him feel fleeting and ephemeral, but it was incomparably solid instead!

He had never seen before such an amazing heavenly pill!

Yang Qing knew that the heavenly pill that Ye Yuan refined might be very impressive.

But he did not think that the heavenly pill that Ye Yuan refined would actually be so awesome!

Below the life-and-death stage, Cao Dian’s face became black as the bottom of a pot.

Got to admit, Yang Qing was seriously too capable of drawing aggro! This guy was currently boundlessly inflated!

The most important thing was that his strength was sufficient to support his inflation!

That spear just now, Cao Dian saw it clearly.

He could not receive it!

What shitty luck!

“Okay, I’ll have a battle with you!” Cao Dian was an extremely proud person too. How could he accepted to be provoked like this?

Even if he clearly knew that he was not a match, he had to fight too!

The strong would never fear challenges!

“Hahaha, Cao Dian, you have guts! But, from this day forth, you’ll have to live under the shadow of this sovereign!”

Amidst the loud laughter, Yang Qing sent out his long spear. Boom!

Luo Hao, dead!

The whole place was dead silent. There was only Yang Qing’s arrogant laughter. Did it end just like that? This … This was also too fake, right? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Luo Hao was True Sovereign Heaven rank fourth!

He actually did not even have the strength to fight back under Yang Qing’s hands?

Previously, they were all mocking Ye Yuan for overestimating his own ability to actually attempt to refine the most difficult pill in history, the Infinite Comprehensive Pill.

Now, not only did Ye Yuan refine it, but he also used an extremely terrifying way to let Yang Qing rise up crazily!

This face was really slapped resoundingly!

was n

Yang Qing himself also admitted that he could not last a single exchange with Luo Hao.

But, after consuming Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill, he directly one-shotted Luo Hao!

This kind of contrast really drove people nuts!

How could you be so amazing?

o an

Wang Lin, Zheng Qian, Guo Fang, Qin Shan, and the rest had all turned their noses up at Ye Yuan previously, mocking him to the best of their ability.

But now, those words seemed to have turned into slaps, slapping onto their faces crazily. “Cao Dian, come up! Watch your Grandpa Qing wreck you!” Yang Qing said complacently.

He was already inflated to the extreme!

The former king was already being completely taken lightly by him. Hearing this, everyone really wanted to go up and slap his face!

But they could not do it!

Cao Dian, you definitely can’t lose!

Cao Dian went up the life-and-death stage with a black face.

Yang Qing said to the judge, “Old man, borrow the life-and-death stage to use! Today, I’m going to reign over True Sovereign Heaven!”

Bang! The judge directly smacked Yang Qing into the dirt with a slap!

Everyone felt incredibly satisfied! Who asked you to posture!
