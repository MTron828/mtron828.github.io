Chapter 1938: Intense Confrontation!

“So that’s how it is!”

Ye Yuan was calm on the surface but actually extremely shocked inwardly.

The meaning in Empyrean Realm Flutterfeather’s words was that he was only a step away from the Ancestor Realm.

Compared to the Dao Realm, the Ancestor Realm was even more vague and insubstantial, and it was even harder to fathom.

Although Ye Yuan was already at the grand completion Dao Realm, he still did not have the slightest clue about Ancestor Realm.

“Achieving the grand completion Dao Realm at a young age, your future prospects are limitless!” Empyrean Flutterfeather said with vicissitudes of emotion.

“Senior Flutterfeather is too kind!” Ye Yuan said.

“Huhu, enough talk, since you want to challenge me, let’s begin then. The medicinal pill is up to you to choose,” Flutterfeather said coolly.

Ye Yuan nodded. He was also somewhat unable to hold himself back anymore.

An opponent like Empyrean Flutterfeather could not be encountered randomly.

Compared to Empyrean powerhouses, grand completion Dao Realm alchemists were harder to encounter.

“Why don’t we refine the Thousand Tribulation Chaos Essence Pill, I wonder what Senior Flutterfeather thinks?” Ye Yuan said.

“Mn? Thousand Tribulation Chaos Essence Pill is a supreme medicinal pill for five transformation body-cultivators. Refining it is quite hard, you’re sure that you want to refine it?” Empyrean Flutterfeather said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This is it.”

The classification of medicinal pills was just a general division. Similarly level nine difficulty medicinal pills, it was naturally impossible for the refining difficulty to be exactly the same.

Just like the Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill that Ye Yuan refined before, the difficulty level was virtually unimaginable.

This Thousand Tribulation Chaos Essence Pill’s refining difficulty was considered very high among rank five level nine divine pills already.

To Ye Yuan, refining the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill, Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, this kind of commonly seen medicinal pills would naturally be the most suitable.

Although Ye Yuan’s strength was extremely strong, in terms of pill refining experience, in terms of understanding toward the medicinal properties of spirit medicines, how could he compare to the Empyrean Flutterfeather who had lived for several million years?

This choice was not wise for Ye Yuan.

Empyrean Flutterfeather nodded his head. Flicking his sleeves grandly, a medicinal cauldron appeared in front of him.

“Since it’s refining a rank five divine pill, this Empyrean naturally won’t take advantage of you either. This is the medicinal cauldron that this Empyrean used when I was at Celestial Deity Realm, it’s called Xuanlong Cauldron, which hasn’t been used for several million years already. If you win this Empyrean, this Empyrean will give it to you,” Empyrean Flutterfeather said.

Ye Yuan sized up the Xuanlong Cauldron in front of him. Waves of profound and inscrutable undulations emitted from it, it was a rare treasure among celestial deity mystic treasures.

To Five-star Alchemy Gods, it was absolutely a treasure that they yearned for even in their sleep.

Except, when Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people saw this scene, they could not help having astonished faces.

“Master, this disciple has begged you for a thousand years already and you weren’t willing to bestow the Xuanlong Cauldron to me. Now, you’re actually going to gift it to an outsider,” Zi Yu said with an aggrieved look.

These two little medicine boys had clearly received Empyrean Flutterfeather’s doting favor, to actually dare speak to him like this.

But one could also tell from his expression that this Xuanlong Cauldron was an exceptionally fine medicinal cauldron.

Empyrean Flutterfeather smiled and said, “Not giving you is naturally because you aren’t worthy of this medicinal cauldron. Although it’s already useless to me, this Empyrean has nourished it for several million years. It’s spirituality has long already surpassed ordinary celestial deity mystic treasures. Whoever inherits it and uses it to refine pills, that naturally also represents this Empyrean’s face. The two of you are still far away from this step!”

Qing Yun pursed his mouth and said, “I don’t believe that this brat can be Master’s match!”

Empyrean Flutterfeather waved his hand and said, “Don’t be impolite; quickly go prepare the spirit medicines.”

The two disciples did not dare to dawdle, quickly going to prepare two sets of Thousand Tribulation Chaos Essence Pill spirit medicines.

These spirit medicines were worth a thousand gold outside, but in Clouddream Mountain, it naturally did not count for anything.

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s palm brushed past, it seemed to have magical powers, those spirit medicines actually turned into motes of light, gathering over towards the Xuanlong Cauldron.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted; Empyrean Flutterfeather actually directly skipped the medicinal embryo refining segment.

This technique was simply inconceivable.

The pupils of the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s elders all shrunk, clearly being astounded by this scene.

They were also considered to be extremely experienced alchemists already, their statuses incomparably revered.

But the workings of this scene in front of their eyes, they had simply never heard of it before.

Empyrean Flutterfeather was an extremely mysterious existence, it was naturally impossible to refine pills in front of these people’s faces.

Being able to come here and watch today was still thanks to Ye Yuan. It also let them broaden their horizons.

When Zi Yu and Qing Yun saw this scene, their faces revealed smug smiles.

“Saw that? This is merely the tip of Master’s strength. This stinking brat is totally overestimating his own ability!” Zi Yu said.

“Even if he’s at the grand completion Dao Realm, compared to Master, he’s also worlds apart! Pill refinement isn’t competing in just realm!” Qing Yun said.

Seemingly detecting the strange look in Ye Yuan’s eyes, Empyrean Flutterfeather said with a smile, “This Empyrean has immersed in Alchemy Dao for millions of years and has long already understood the medicinal properties of all kinds of spirit medicines like the arm directs the fingers. If I can’t even do this, then my reputation is also too undeserved.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Flutterfeather is impressive. This junior really broadened my horizons!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s hand was like a wandering dragon. A cluster of pale white flames emerged from his palm, turning into nine fire dragons.

Under Ye Yuan’s control, the nine fire dragons were akin to living things, suddenly diving into the medicinal cauldron in front of him.

Bang!

The medicinal cauldron suddenly gave off a sonorous dragon roar, reverberating throughout the hall.

Ye Yuan’s medicinal cauldron was obtained in the Purple Extreme Hall, it was called Wandering Dragon Cauldron!

Even though it was a celestial deity mystic treasure too, it was much worse than a treasure like the Xuanlong Cauldron.

A celestial deity mystic treasure that was nourished by an Empyrean powerhouse for several million years was not what ordinary objects could compare to.

However, the Wandering Dragon Cauldron suddenly radiated a brilliant light under Ye Yuan’s manipulation.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned. The spirit medicines flew straight into the Wandering Dragon Cauldron.

“Pfft!”

Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people immediately burst into laughter.

“Does he know how to refine pills or not? Can throwing the spirit medicines in all together like this refine medicinal pills? This brat isn’t here to joke around, right?” Zi Yu convulsed with laughter as he said.

“Heh heh, he tried to draw a tiger but ended up with the likeness of a dog! He wants to follow Master’s example, but he also doesn’t measure his own capabilities, can he learn it?” Qing Yun similarly burst into laughter and said.

When the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders saw this scene, each and every one also shook their heads.

It seemed like Ye Yuan was arrogant at heart and haughty in manner and directly had his tempo taken by Empyrean Flutterfeather.

That fire controlling art was naturally extremely formidable, but he could not even refine the medicinal embryo refine superb medicinal pills?

It was just that none of them noticed that a hint of strange light flashed across in Empyrean Flutterfeather’s eyes.

“Brilliant! Truly excellent! Little Friend, just based on this move, you’re adequate to be this Empyrean’s opponent!” Flutterfeather had a rare burst of exclamation. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

His words made everyone’s faces change slightly.

Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people’s smiles immediately turned stiff on their faces.

It was clearly Ye Yuan behaving carelessly, so why did their master give such a high evaluation?

Was this move ... brilliant?

Why couldn’t they tell?

“Master, how is his move brilliant? Randomly throwing spirit medicines in like this can refine the medicinal embryo?” Zi Yu was full of puzzlement.

Flutterfeather smiled faintly and said, “You guys can’t, but he can! This move is extremely brilliant, but you guys can’t learn it!”
