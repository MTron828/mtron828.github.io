Chapter 1539 Gale Celestial Stone Pill

“Easy? You’re saying that the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill is easy? H-Ha! Truly shameless boasting!”

Ning Siyu was utterly speechless. She really did not know where Ye Yuan’s confidence came from, to actually be this arrogant.

Meridian Heaven Heart Pill was a middle-grade rank three divine pill. Furthermore, it was a very difficult to refine type among rank three middle-grade divine pills.

Ning Siyu’s talent was extremely high. One should not look at how she was young. She was already a middle-rank Three-star Alchemy God.

This Meridian Heaven Heart Pill was precisely the medicinal pill that she failed to refine for a long time.

This medicinal pill’s refinement difficulty was immense. Even if Ning Siyu’s master refined it, he could only occasionally refine one to superior-grade.

One had to know, her master was a Four-star Alchemy God!

This cocky boy in front of her was actually so arrogant.

Ye Yuan gave Ning Siyu a glance and said smilingly, “Meridian Heaven Heart Pill, the refinement fee is two million divine essence stones. Do you have them?”

Ning Siyu glared and said angrily, “Don’t you look down on people! Isn’t it a mere two million divine essence stones? This young master is poor until I’m only left with divine essence stones!

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Alright then, you wait.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around and entered the inner hall.

Although two hours passed, everyone did not leave. Instead, there was a trend of gathering more and more.

‘Will Grant All Requests’, this gimmick, was indeed rather beckoning.

Everyone all wanted to see if this ridiculously young alchemist really had the standard, or was a half bucket of water sloshing around.

But everyone was very pessimistic about Ye Yuan. Such a young alchemist, even if he was really a Three-star alchemist, it was also impossible to have a very high standard.

Since Ning Siyu came to kick down the dojo, the pill formula that she took out definitely was not some commonplace pill formula.

Ordinary alchemists probably could not refine it.

But at this time, Ye Yuan slowly came out from the inner hall.

Seeing Ye Yuan come out so quickly, Ning Siyu’s face revealed a smug smile.

“Kid, can’t refine it, right? Did you ... ruin all of my spirit medicines? Heh, the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill, this level of medicinal pill, how can it be what any random Tom, Dick, and Harry, can refine?” Ning Siyu said smugly.

This Meridian Heaven Heart Pill, even if her master came to refine it, the process still needed half a day’s time too.

Refining it in two hours?

Ning Siyu did not even consider this being possible at all!

“This kid is totally putting up an act! Still will grant all requests, what a joke!”

“Isn’t that so? No idea where the Dragon Slaying Gang found this kid either, isn’t this asking for trouble?”

“The Meridian Heaven Heart Pill, I heard before. It’s a very difficult to refine middle-grade rank three divine pill. This brat’s hair isn’t even fully grown, can he refine it?”

“Come, come, come, let’s smash the signboard together! Isn’t this making fun of us?”

...

Ning Siyu was all roused up when she heard and said delightedly, “You don’t have any objection about me smashing the signboard now, right? Oh, right, my spirit medicines’ money, you got to compensate me. A total of 500 thousand divine essence stones!”

As she said, Ning Siyu was going to smash the signboard.

Ning Siyu’s body had just risen to midair and then was dragged down by Ye Yuan. She could not help saying in exasperation, “You punk, are you courting death?”

Ye Yuan ignored her, but stretched his hand out and said, “Give it.”

Ning Siyu froze and said, “Give what?”

Ye Yuan said, “Two million divine essence stones!”

Ning Siyu blew her top all at once and bellowed, “You didn’t even refine the medicinal pill and still want to ask me for divine essence stones? You ... You’re not duping people, you’re a scam shop!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Who told you that I didn’t refine it?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Ning Siyu snickered and said, “Rubbish! Two hours, you can refine the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill? If you were to refine it, I’ll eat the medicine cauldron!”

Ye Yuan fished out a small jade box. The moment the jade box opened, a medicinal fragrance that gladdened the heart and refreshed the mind instantly spread out.

Ning Siyu’s smile immediately froze there, looking at that dark red medicinal pill in disbelief.

“This ... This is impossible! Divine ... Divine-grade Meridian Heaven Heart Pill? Y-Y-You ... Where did you get it from?”

Ning Siyu was like a startled little rabbit, at a loss on what to do and where to go.

Her master could not even refine a heaven-grade Meridian Heaven Heart Pill, let alone divine-grade.

This kid actually brought a divine-grade out!

“This ... This is really a divine-grade medicinal pill!”

“Are my eyes failing me? A Three-star Alchemy God refined a rank three divine-grade divine pill?”

“The Meridian Heaven Heart Pill isn’t an ordinary medicinal pill! He can actually refine a divine-grade! This ... This is too fake, right?”

...

The surrounding people were all dumbfounded. Divine-grade medicinal pills were extremely rare and also not what they could afford.

But now, this young man actually took out a divine-grade divine pill!

Ning Siyu reached her hand out, wanting to take the medicinal pill. But Ye Yuan pulled his hand back and Ning Siyu grabbed thin air.

“Want the medicinal pill, pay money!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ning Siyu pursed her mouth and threw a storage ring to Ye Yuan. Snatching the jade box over, she said, “Take it! Look at that money-face appearance of yours! Humph!”

Observing the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill closely, it was indeed divine-grade!

The medicinal pill was still steaming. Clearly, it had just come out of the furnace.

This ... was really refined that this kid?

Titanic waves surged in Ning Siyu’s heart. The difficulty of the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill, she was all too clear!

She had already attempted to refine this medicinal pill for several years, but she had never succeeded before.

But this kid refined it in two hours!

This ... I don’t believe it!

“I don’t believe it! You ... You must have cheated!” Ning Siyu suddenly said.

Little Huan was also incredibly shocked at one side. But Ning Siyu’s endless pestering, she really could not look on anymore.

“Young master ...”

“Shut up!” Ning Siyu shouted at Little Huan, then turned to Ye Yuan again and said, “Kid, there must be something shady involved! I don’t believe that you can refine a divine-grade Meridian Heaven Heart Pill!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said indifferently, “Believing it or not is up to you. Our transaction is already done.”

So infuriating!

Can you, this punk, not be so cocky or not?

“Kid, I still want to ask for a kind of medicinal pill! If you can even refine this medicinal pill, I’ll believe that you can really grant all requests! Otherwise ... I’m still going to smash your signboard!” Ning Siyu said.

Ye Yuan was amused and said smilingly, “As long as there’s business, I won’t refuse the arrival.”

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Ning Siyu mouth and she said,

“This is the Gale Celestial Stone Pill’s pill formula and spirit medicines. If you can refine it, I’ll immediately get lost!”

“Hiss ... Gale Celestial Stone Pill! What background does this brat have? To actually have this pill formula!”

“Gale Celestial Stone Pill, it’s said to be a medicinal pill that can help martial artists comprehend the law of wind, being incomparably profound. This medicinal pill isn’t available on the market at all!”

“This medicinal pill is famous for being hard to refine. Heard that even for Four-star alchemy gods, it’s very hard to refine!”

“Heh, this young man ... is in trouble now!”

...

Ye Yuan received the pill formula and browsed it over. A hint of a smile flashed across the corners of his mouth and he said, “A little interesting!”

Ning Siyu sneered and said, “Do you dare to accept or not?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What’s not to dare? But this medicinal pill isn’t cheap!”

Ning Siyu snorted coldly and said, “If you can really refine it, money is no object!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Alright then, eight million divine essence stones!”
