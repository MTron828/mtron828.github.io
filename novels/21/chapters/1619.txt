Chapter 1623 Height of Shamelessness

Di En said rather puzzledly, “You’re saying?”Heavenstar said, “Oh my! Back then, Source Night that punk disguised as a fiend. Wasn’t his appearance very similar to that kid just now?”

Di En ruminated when he heard that. He suddenly startled awake and said, “If you didn’t say it, I really couldn’t recall! It’s him!”

It was not that Di En was forgetful, but Ye Yuan in human state and Ye Yuan in fiend race state, his aura and disposition were vastly different.

Coupled with that Ye Yuan did some modifications in appearance, that was why Di En did not recognize him.

Now, being reminded by Heavenstar, Di En abruptly realized it.

Di En said in a clear voice, “Hang on! Let’s go back first!”

Di En was this group of fiends’ important figure. His words were naturally very effective.

Another leader, Qiao An, said, “What’s wrong, Di En? Could it be that those humans still have a possibility of escaping from the Soul Devouring Devil Cloud Formation?”

Di En said, “If it was just those people, it’s naturally impossible! But there is a very great variable among them!”

Qiao An was rather surprised as he said, “It’s that kid you guys were talking about earlier? However, just being at the Origin Deity Realm, is he actually so formidable?”

Heavenstar said with a cold smile, “He toyed with the entire Eminent Orchid Imperial City and Blood Yama Hall in the palm of his hand, and finally, even obtained the precious treasure and withdrew! Do you think he’s formidable or not?”

Even though they did not know the Purple Extreme Hall’s grade, use one’s butt to think that they would also know that it was definitely a precious treasure.

Qiao An got a big shock and said, “This brat is that one who made you all suffer a tragic loss the last time?”

Heavenstar said with a cold smile, “That punk, I’ll still recognize him even if he turns to ashes! This time, I’m going to let him know what’s called despair!”

...

“Get lost for your father!”

In the red fog, Gao Yuan’s eyes were scarlet-red. He already almost could not hold on anymore.

This array formation was too powerful. With the strength of his divine soul, he was actually unable to resist it.

Even though he tried his best to stay awake, his consciousness still became increasingly blurry.

“Damn it! This old man has roamed unhindered for a lifetime, how can I possibly capsize in a drain?”

Gao Yuan roared, wanting to rush out of the grand array. But his consciousness became more and more blurry.

Rumble!

Suddenly, a loud noise transmitted over. Gao Yuan immediately felt his divine soul ease up, recovering clarity.

“This ... What’s going on here? What did I do just now?”

“Ahh! Junior Apprentice Brother, who killed you?! I ... I’m going to take revenge for you!”

“It ... It was Elder Ye who saved us!”

...

Not far away, there was a destroyed formation base beside Ye Yuan.

And the surroundings already had quite a few formation bases destroyed.

Very clearly, this was all done by Ye Yuan.

“Many thanks ... Many thanks for Elder Ye’s life-saving grace!”

“All thanks to Elder Ye. Otherwise, we’d be completely wiped out!”

“Elder Ye is indeed not ordinary. This old man admires you!”

...

Everyone came over to give thanks to Ye Yuan one by one after another.

If not for Ye Yuan, they would probably have already utterly fallen into enemy hands now.

It was just that they were extremely surprised in their hearts, why was Ye Yuan not controlled in the slightest inside this grand array?

This grand array directly took effect on the divine soul, but Ye Yuan’s divine soul had the Soul Suppressing Pearl guarding, how could the grand array corrode it in the least bit?

And Ye Yuan’s Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil had the effect of blasting apart falsehood, making him find these formation bases very quickly.

As long as the formation bases were destroyed, the grand array would naturally be broken.

Zheng Qi still had lingering fear in his heart until now. He discovered now that bringing Ye Yuan was really an extremely wise decision.

Without Ye Yuan, their large group of people would have fallen here.

“Humph! Not saving us, he’d have to die here too!” Gao Yuan said with a cold snort.

When Zheng Qi heard that, he said angrily, “You, this old fogey, are really shameless, to actually be able to say this kind of words.”

Gao Yuan said disdainfully, “Am I wrong? Just based on his bit of strength, can he deal with so many fiends? Don’t tell me that he doesn’t want to obtain that treasure!”

Sure enough, with him saying so, the grateful emotions on everyone’s faces immediately reduced greatly.

Human nature was selfish. Even though Ye Yuan saving them was a fact, when they realized that ye yuan might snatch away their lucky chance, they became vigilant.

Gao Yuan was very pleased with himself when he saw the changes on everyone’s faces.

Just now was just a major setback due to carelessness. As long as he was more careful, he did not fear those fiends in the slightest too.

Get him to thank Ye Yuan, no chance!

“Utterly shameless!’ Zheng Qi said furiously. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Head Elder, you don’t need to get angry. A gentleman is open and poised, a villain is calculative and worries about personal gains and losses. Let him be.”

Ye Yuan understood that Gao Yuan this kind of person was a wicked-hearted person.

His own heart was dark, looking at others was naturally dark too.

No matter how good you were to him, he would also find a reason to lay out your faults.

Toward this kind of person, best to stay far away.

Of course, if there was a chance, Ye Yuan did not mind entrapping him and take revenge for Zheng Qi’s master.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Suddenly, a large group of dark shadows rushed over, and just happened to block this party. They were precisely the fiend race powerhouses who left and returned.

Di En said in a cold voice, “This kid indeed has some means, even the Soul Devouring Devil Cloud Formation couldn’t trap him! Luckily, we came back in time, otherwise, there would really be no end to future troubles!”

The expressions of the human powerhouses changed drastically. They had just broken out of the grand array. Right now, their condition was not good, did not expect that the fiend race powerhouses actually left and returned.

Furthermore, this time, it was their first time seeing the fiend race powerhouses’ lineup, which gave them a big fright.

The fiend race’s side could be said to have powerhouses plentiful as clouds!

Just in terms of numbers, it was several dozen more than their side!

Furthermore, the fiend race’s high-level combat power was also much more compared to the human race’s.

Just third-layered heaven Fiend Lord powerhouses, they had over a dozen people.

This line-up made the human powerhouses feel despair.

Heavenstar looked at Ye Yuan and said with a sinister smile, “Kid, didn’t expect it, right? That we’d still have a day where we meet again!”

Actually, Ye Yuan had long seen Heavenstar through the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil. Meeting at this time was not too surprising.

A hint of a smile curled up at the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and he said, “Looking at your appearance, your resentment is a lot!”

Heavenstar was triggered by Ye Yuan’s smile and exploded, “What do you think? The precious treasure on your, this old man will definitely take it back today! Additionally, this old man’s Profound Yellow Cauldron and your life, this old man will also accept it!”

Di En also said coldly, “In this world, there has yet to be anyone who dares to play tricks on our Blood Yama Hall! Source Night brat, you’re very bold!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you have the capabilities, feel free to come and take!”

Heavenstar sneered and said, “Kill for me! Leave no one behind!”

The group of powerhouses was just about to make a move when Gao Yuan suddenly roared, “Hold on!”

Heavenstar’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said, “Quickly spit out what you have!”

Gao Yuan’s expression could not help turning stiff, and he endured his anger and said in a solemn voice, “You guys have a grudge with this brat, and this old man also has a grudge with this punk! Everybody came to Fiend Calling Ridge for the treasure that was born. Currently, the path ahead is still uncertain. Everybody should work together. We’ll hand this brat to you guys, then search for the treasure together. As for who gets the treasure, each relies on their own means! What do you all think?”

Zheng Qi’s expression changed greatly when he heard that and said furiously, “Gao Yuan! You actually want to play jackal to the tiger and sell out your friend for personal gains!”
