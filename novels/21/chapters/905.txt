Chapter 909: He Cannot, Doesn’t Meant That I Can’t!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Restriction? This restriction practically only exists in name to me,” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly.

This restriction was the same as the grand array, both triggered with dragon wave as the condition. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As long as Ye Yuan adjusted his own dragon wave vibration frequency to become the same as the restriction, passing through this restriction was something that could be easily accomplished.

Everyone exchanged glances, not sure what they should say.

There was still a pile of ashes on the floor, but Ye Yuan said that this restriction existed only in name. What else could they still say?

This Ye Yuan was too mysterious. No matter how difficult a matter was, it would become very easy when it reached his hands.

This skill to turn something rotten into something magical made each and every one of them admire endlessly.

Even Shao Kai was already utterly convinced by Ye Yuan at this time too.

Even Zhong Wubing repeated suffered losses at Ye Yuan’s hands. What reason did he have to not be willing to submit?

Therefore, regarding everyone correcting themselves and calling Ye Yuan boss, he did not have any temper at all. If it was not due to pride, he himself would want to call boss too.

“Heh heh, Boss Ye, does this treasure sword have any special aspects?”

An Ren had a lackey appearance as he moved closer in front of Ye Yuan.

“Want to look, take it then.” Ye Yuan casually threw the sword to An Ren with a look of indifference.

It was like An Ren had found a precious treasure, holding the treasure sword up, unable to put it down.

Clank!

The sword was unsheathed from the scabbard. A wave of extremely apprehensive sharp light instantly filled the entire pavilion-building.

“Fine sword! Fine sword!” A wave of marveling praises echoed out.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You should be a sword-user, right? Give you this sword.”

“W-W-What?” An Ren could not quite believe his own ears, resulting in somewhat stuttering when talking.

“I said, give you this sword to use.”

“...” An Ren opened his eyes wide. The rest also opened their eyes wide and did not come back to their senses.

This was a high-grade holy artifact. Ye Yuan actually gave it away at the drop of a hat?

Forget about them, these slaughter generals, even if the Exalts came here, they would definitely get into a free-for-all fight when they see this high-grade holy artifact too.

Ye Yuan actually gave it to An Ren with a casual manner just like this?

When they came back to their senses, everyone looked at An Ren with envious looks. At the same time, they themselves were also seized with regret.

If they knew long ago, they would have licked Boss Ye’s boots like An Ren!

This was a high-grade holy artifact!

“You guys don’t need to be envious of him either. I reckon that the second floor should still have quite a number of good stuff. At that time, you will all benefit,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“W-We all have a share?”

Everyone did not know what they should say already. This ... was also too generous, right?

“Ye Yuan, this ... is a high-grade holy artifact! Don’t you ... want it?” Shao Kai said in disbelief.

“These toys, I have no need for them. Just give them to you then. But you all got to be a little more careful after you go out and not easily expose these things. Otherwise, it will draw a fatal disaster,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Everyone was speechless. They perceived it, Ye Yuan really turned his nose up at it!

This sword, when placed outside, would definitely draw a wave of bloody storm. But Ye Yuan actually held it in total contempt!

This world was too crazy!

Although this sword was decent, it was still far too lacking compared to the Starmoon Sword.

Furthermore, the strength unleashed by this high-grade holy artifact in Ye Yuan’s hands was even inferior to the Starmoon Sword. It was really useless for him to claim it.

Actually, Ye Yuan’s greatest killing tool was not the Starmoon Sword, but the Vast Heaven Pagoda!

At present, Ye Yuan could already preliminarily control the Vast Heaven Pagoda. Slaying his opponents was just a matter of snapping his fingers. It was just that up till the present moment, no one could force him to this step yet, that was all.

The Vast Heaven Pagoda probably already infinitely approached a divine artifact. Once it was exposed, there would be endless problems.

Compared to the Vast Heaven Pagoda, all these high-grade holy artifacts, Ye Yuan naturally looked down on them in disdain.

“Alright, the first floor shouldn’t have any good stuff anymore. Let’s better go up to the second floor,” Ye Yuan said.

Ye Yuan came to the second floor’s entrance. A transparent light screen blocked in front of him.

“A restriction again! Why are there restrictions everywhere inside this Dragon Sovereign Territory?” someone grumbled.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “This restriction doesn’t have offensive power and also can’t be opened using other methods. Want to enter the next floor, one can only break it with force. If I didn’t guess wrongly, nobody should have stepped into the second floor yet.”

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone’s eyes light up!

If no one had stepped foot into the second floor before, didn’t that mean that the treasures upstairs were all accounted for?

“Boss, let me this time! Just acquired this Dragon Spring Sword, perfect to use it for practice!” An Ren assumed the responsibility.

An Ren already dripped blood to have it acknowledged his as its master, and got to know that this treasure sword’s name was called Dragon Spring Sword.

Ye Yuan smiled but did not say anything.

An Ren’s ranking on the Heaven Carnage Proclamation was not low. He was an existence second only to Shao Kai among Si Yin’s lot.

Obtaining the Dragon Spring Sword this time, he was naturally itching to have a go.

“Destruction Sword!”

An Ren gave a fierce cry. An incredibly powerful sword intent stabbed towards the light screen.

Boom!

An Ren was directly blasted flying out, smashing heavily onto the wall.

“Ouch!” An Ren gave a miserable wail, all the bones in his body almost falling apart.

The faces of Shao Kai and the rest all changed. They did not expect that this light screen actually had such power.

“Heh heh, looks like we overestimated our strength! Since nobody has stepped foot into the second floor, it means that Exalt Blazing Fire couldn’t go up either! Even he couldn’t break this restriction with his strength. How are we able to break it with just us, these people?” Shao Kai suddenly came to his senses and said, rather dispiritedly.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “This restriction, forget about the Blazing Fire back then, even if the current Blazing Fire came, he definitely can’t break it either.”

Hearing these words, everyone’s countenance changed even more.

When Blazing Fire entered here back then, he had not reached Exalt level yet. His strength was also far from what it could be compared to presently.

This ten year’s time, Blazing Fire’s improvement was evident to all. His strength was already comparable to some of the veteran Exalts already.

But Ye Yuan said that even the present Blazing Fire could not do it.

Then this light screen, who else was able to break it?

“As expected, it was still nothing more than wishful thinking on our part!” Shao Kai said with a bitter smile.

“Huhu, he cannot, doesn’t mean that I can’t!” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

These words were rather arrogant!

No matter how one looked at it, it was impossible for Ye Yuan to be Blazing Fire’s match either.

But Ye Yuan said that he could break this light screen!

This ... How was this possible?

“Don’t believe it? All back away for me and watch carefully!” Ye Yuan said confidently.

Not that Shao Kai did not believe. But Ye Yuan’s raised the starting point too high. An Exalt’s strength was not what they, these slaughter generals, could compare to.

Even Zhong Wubing could not withstand a single blow in front of an Exalt too.

Who was Ye Yuan to break this light screen?

However, doubt was doubt. But there was a voice sounding out in their hearts, that was that Ye Yuan could do it!

Ye Yuan came before the light screen and slowly shut his eyes.

At the same time, all the dragon blood in his body started boiling over. A bizarre vibration started revolving within Ye Yuan’s body.

The frequency of this vibration became increasingly higher and progressively closer together. Later, Ye Yuan’s whole body actually emitted an extremely mysterious sensation.

When Shao Kai and the rest saw this scene, they could not help revealing dumbfounded looks of amazement.

“Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!”

Ye Yuan revolved the dragon wave to the limits. A palm rumbled out in a manner that could topple mountains and overturn the seas!
