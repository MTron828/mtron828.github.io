Chapter 608: Floating Light Blood Shadow Array

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At this time, the inside of the Fierce Gale World central army’s main tent was shrouded by a ball of blood-red light.

Shangguan Lingyun looked at the small flask suspending quietly. A hint of a strange smile flashed across the corners of his mouth.

“Kill then, kill. The more freely you all kill, the faster my cultivation improves!Hahaha!”

Shangguan Lingyun’s face had a crazed look. How was there any hint of the calm bearing previously?

In the central army’s main tent, array formations revolved around. Massive amounts of sanguine aura were sucked over frenziedly by the grand array and poured into the small flask.

In the grand array, Shangguan Lingyun greedily absorbed the sanguine qi spilling outside. His cultivation was increasing with speed visible to the naked eye.

“Hahaha! This Blood Carnage Demonic Art is indeed formidable. Continue cultivating at this speed, at most two months, and I will be able to break through to the Divine Traversing Realm! With this Blood Carnage Demonic Art, even ascending to the Divine Realm is close at hand!” Shangguan Lingyun said with a wild laugh.

Rumble!

Shangguan Lingyun’s aura skyrocketed abruptly and actually broke through the Eighth Level Soul Sea threshold directly under the colossal sanguine qi.

“Congratulations to Lord Shangguan for breaking through to the Eighth Level Soul Sea!” at a corner of the main tent, Deng Sheng said with an envious look.

Shangguan Lingyun opened both eyes and recovered to that sort of calm look before. It was just that a hint of blood-red color was at the recesses of his eyes, but it made him appear somewhat surly.

“En.

How’s the battle situation outside?” Shangguan Lingyun inquired.

But Deng Sheng said with an embarrassed look, “Not very good!”

“En? What’s wrong?” Shangguan Lingyun said rather unhappily.

The Fierce Gale World great army’s numbers were ten times the number of martial artists in Crimsonlight City. Logically speaking, the fighting should have already pretty much ended. But Deng Sheng told him that it was not very good. This naturally made Deng Sheng very displeased.

Deng Sheng hurriedly said when he saw the situation, “Lord Shangguan, please calm your anger. These Crimsonlight City martial artists, I don’t know why, but their combat strength suddenly soared greatly. Our great army simply can’t gain any bit of advantage within a small radius. If not for our numbers being massive, they would probably already have successfully broken out of the encirclement at this time!”

Shangguan Lingyun’s brows furrowed slightly. He pondered for a while and said, “Seems like . . . this is related to Ye Yuan! This fellow is really troublesome. This time, we must finish him off! Or else, there will be no end of trouble for the future! When will Lord Yunrong reach?”

“Looking at the news given from there, Lord Yunrong can make it latest by today!” Deng Sheng said.

Shangguan Lingyun nodded and said, “I’ll go and tie down Ye Yuan. As long as Lord Yunrong arrives, there will naturally be him to take care of Ye Yuan.”

Deng Sheng said in surprise, “Lord Shangguan already broke through to Eighth Level Soul Sea. Could it be that you still can’t deal with that brat?”

Shangguan Lingyun shook his head and said, “I cannot be certain! Ye Yuan’s might virtually disregards the disparity of levels. I only broke through one minor boundary. To him, it’s practically dispensable. Unless I can break through to the Divine Traversing Realm, only then, will there be sufficient assurance to kill him.”

Deng Sheng was taken aback with shock. A minor realm in the Soul Sea Realm, but the disparity was still huge. The difficulty of leaping realms to battle was very great.

Shangguan Lingyun broke through to the Eighth Level Soul Sea and actually even said that he did not have certainty in being able to deal with Ye Yuan!

Rumble!

The two people were just speaking when a powerful attack arrived with a howl.

Shangguan Lingyun’s expression changed. Waving his hand, a blow struck back too.

Two powerful attacks collided, instantly shredding the central army’s main tent into ribbons.

The sanguine light in the big tent could no longer be hidden and was exposed.

But Shangguan Lingyun had long vacated all the nearby personnel. The Fierce Gale World great army was currently obstructing and intercepting the Crimsonlight City martial artists right now. There would not be anybody paying attention to here either.

A figure stood in the air. Who could it be but Ye Yuan?

Seeing that blood-colored grand array, Ye Yuan’s brows involuntarily knitted together.

“You all launched this war and would massacre all the residents of the city every time you reached a city. Turns out that it’s actually for the sake of this Floating Light Blood Shadow Array!” Ye Yuan’s words exuded thick killing intent in them.

This Floating Light Blood Shadow Array was a very wicked grand array. It was an array formation specially for the sake of collecting and refining sanguine qi.

And to absorb sanguine qi, it must be accompanied by a bloody massacre.

Ye Yuan did not expect that the Fierce Gale World launching the war was actually for the sake of collecting sanguine qi.

What on earth were they trying to do?

Being unmasked by Ye Yuan, Shangguan Lingyun did not have the slightest hint of panic and said with a smile, “Never thought that you actually even know about Floating Light Blood Shadow Array. You truly surprised me.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Looks like you were making use of these sanguine qi to cultivate earlier. I was still thinking about how can you possibly break through a major boundary within a year. So, it’s this reason. Really didn’t expect that a genius like you will also actually abandon yourself to vice.”

Shangguan Lingyun had just broken through not long ago. The sanguine qi on his body had yet to dissipate completely. Ye Yuan saw through that he was utilizing the sanguine qi to cultivate with one glance.

Shangguan Lingyun suddenly gave a self-mocking laugh and said, “Genius? You using this term to evaluate others, why does it sound very sarcastic even when listening to it? In front of you, who dares to claim to be a genius? Ever since you wasted Zhao Chenggan, I knew that you were a great mountain that I have no way of surpassing in this life!”

Ye Yuan said with a cold sneer, “So you wallowed in degeneration and cultivated this sort of demonic path cultivation method? Do you know that even though demonic path cultivation methods advance quickly, likewise, the hidden dangers are also very great!”

“So what? As long as I can defeat you and Zhao Chenggan, however much I have to pay, I’m willing too do so!” Shangguan Lingyun said coldly.

Ye Yuan shook his head slightly and said helplessly, “Looks like you’re already hopeless! You guys actually did not scruple in launching a realm war in order to collect this sanguine qi and let your own people come to the Endless World to send themselves to death. Just what is it for?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Shangguan Lingyun suddenly said with an evil smile, “If you want to know, you can go and ask the Wind Emperor, His Majesty, personally.”

Ye Yuan stared at Shangguan Lingyun for a long time before saying, “Looks like you’re just a dog under Zhao Tianyin too; you don’t know anything at all. Rest assure, I’ll go and ask him personally.”

Shangguan Lingyun’s air became cold as he said in a deep voice, “You’re courting death!”

As he spoke, Shangguan Lingyun hurled a punch towards Ye Yuan.

This punch carried extremely intense sanguine qi. Forget about ordinary martial artists receiving this punch, just this sanguine qi was also plenty more than they could bear.

But Ye Yuan refined the blood of a true dragon in the Vast Heaven Pagoda. That was an extreme yang and indomitable tyrannical bloodline under this sky. It restrained this sanguine qi the most.

Although this attack was powerful, it did not pose much of a threat to Ye Yuan.

A Flame Movement Carnage rushed over, directly dissipating this fist intent.

“Flame Movement True Dragon Carnage!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate, directly returning a punch.

Except that this punch was not targeting Shangguan Lingyun; it targeted that Floating Light Blood Shadow Array.

What surprised Ye Yuan was that Shangguan Lingyun did not have the intention of saving the array formation. He let Ye Yuan’s Flame Movement True Dragon Carnage rumble over at his discretion.

Yet, at this time, that gray-black small flash suddenly surged with a blood-colored glow. A blood dragon flew out of the small flask’s opening and directly devoured Ye Yuan’s Flame Movement True Dragon Carnage.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s expression darkened.
