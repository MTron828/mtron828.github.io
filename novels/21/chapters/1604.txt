Chapter 1608 Unexpected Departure

At the Ye Manor, a young man gave Ye Yuan a bow respectfully and said, “Elder Ye, Zhou Wei has already been banished to Jiang Gu City. His cultivation was sealed and to be enslaved for 300 years. As for Song Qiyang, Head Elder did his utmost to protect him. However, Head Elder made him kneel for a month in the Pill Tower’s plaza, so as to appease Elder Ye’s fury.”

After Ye Yuan listened, he said coolly, “Ruo Xu that old punk making concessions in order to gain advantages! However, kneeling for a month is also a considerable punishment to Song Qiyang. You’ve worked hard, Tianping.

The young man bowed and said, “Sharing Elder Ye’s worries isn’t hard.”

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said with a smile, “Tianping, actually, with your talent, you don’t need to become my follower. Why do you have to put yourself at a great inconvenience?”

This young man was called Ning Tianping, the Ning Family young generation’s number one person!

Even Ning Fangrong also could not match up to Ning Tianping’s talent.

Back then, Ning Lixiao spent a price of 3.5 billion and won the Vastsun Universe Pill, it was to give it to him.

After consuming that Vastsun Universe Pill, Ning Tianping realized the extraordinariness of this medicinal pill very quickly.

He was still just a grand completion Origin Deity at that time, but he comprehended things very quickly, directly crossing over half-step Divine Lord, this threshold, and then he became a first-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse.

After breaking through, his cultivation was like turning on a hack, his strength advancing by leaps and bounds.

In a short less than 100 years’ time, he already cultivated to become a peak second-layered heaven Divine Lord!

Such cultivation speed was simply outrageous to hear.

Ning Tianping realized very quickly that this was the Vastsun Universe Pill’s effect.

He originally wanted to thank Ye Yuan, but hearing that Ye Yuan died inside the spatial inheritance, he was even upset for quite a while.

But this time, Ye Yuan returning domineering shook the entire imperial city.

When Ning Tianping heard that they were going to find another follower for Ye Yuan, he took the initiative to request for the assignment.

Originally, with his identity, there were only others being his attendants. Where was there him being other people’s attendant, this sort of thing?

Even those elders did not dare to use Ning Tianping as an attendant too.

But the Ning Family held a supportive attitude toward this matter and even helped Ning Tianping campaign in many ways, making him stand out from among the numerous protectors.

Now, wanting to become Ye Yuan’s follower was not that easy of a matter anymore.

In the past, Ye Yuan was merely a heaven-defyingly talent to them.

Ye Yuan could only refine rank three divine pills, which was of no use to them at all.

But now, Ye Yuan was only a step away from becoming a Four-star Alchemy God.

Once he successfully broke through, that significance was totally different.

With the benefits of a favorable position, whoever could become Elder Ye’s follower, the benefits obtained would naturally be unimaginable too.

Hence, arranging for Ye Yuan a follower this time could be said that everyone had long racked their brains over it already.

It was a shame that Lin Dong could only sigh at home like a little wife now.

A massive opportunity was once placed in front of him, he did not go and cherish it. Losing it now, it could only be too late to repent.

He did not put in much effort with Ye Yuan. It was more or less because Ye Yuan was a Three-star Alchemy God, just due to this reason.

But he never dreamed that this day came so quickly.

In a short 100 years, Ye Yuan broke through to the peak grand completion Origin Deity from the middle-stage Origin Deity.

Wanting to turn back now was already impossible.

Moreover, when Ye Yuan was trapped in the spatial inheritance back then, he even reproved Li-er they all before.

Ning Tianping smiled and said, “100 years ago, our Ning Family won the bid for Elder Ye’s Vastsun Universe Pill. Everybody said that the Ning Family was using divine essence stones to repay your grace. Actually, I also thought so at that time. But when I consumed the Vastsun Universe Pill and broke through to the Divine Lord Realm in one stroke, I knew that it was actually our Ning Family who took advantage of Elder Ye! That medicinal pill’s value simply cannot be measured using divine essence stones.”

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “So, you’re here to repay the kindness?”

But Ning Tianping shook his head and said, “I know that Elder Ye doesn’t need repaying of gratitude. There’s also nothing to hide here. Right now, in the entire imperial city, who doesn’t hope to come join as Elder Ye’s followers? As long as they follow you, there will be limitless possibilities in the future. Putting it bluntly, everyone actually wants to benefit from your light!”

Ye Yuan looked at Ning Tianping rather surprisedly, not expecting that he would actually be so honest.

Knowing was one thing, saying it in front of his face was another.

At the very least, Ning Tianping’s forthright personality made Ye Yuan admire greatly still.

If Ning Tianping said some ostentatious and pretentious words to brush him off, his impression of the other party would naturally be much worse.

Toward him, he naturally would not trust him so much anymore as well.

Toward people he was unfamiliar with, Ye Yuan naturally had to observe and study them a bit.

Just like Lin Dong, Lin Dong helped him deal with Qin Xiao. But Lin Dong was filled with misgivings and fear when encountering Song Qiyang, so Ye Yuan would not give him another chance.

Regarding Ning Tianping, even though he was a member of the Ning Family, if he could not pass his test, he similarly would not do.

The two people were currently talking when Yue Mengli and White Light few people suddenly came over.

When Ye Yuan saw these few people’s battle array, he could not help getting a fright.

“What’s with you guys?” Ye Yuan said curiously.

Ning Tianping was very sensible, seeing this scene, he immediately took his leave and left. This made Ye Yuan’s impression of him become much better again. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The few people ‘bore down menacingly’, but when they arrived in front of Ye Yuan, they suddenly collectively went mute.

They looked at each other, exchanging glances, and actually did not know how to start talking.

This appearance made Ye Yuan become more curious.

“Sister-in-law, better for you to say!” White Light said.

Yue Mengli thought about it and suddenly mustered up her courage and said, “Big Brother Yuan, actually, coming to find you, we want to tell you that we want to go out and train by ourselves.”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed when he heard that and said in a solemn voice, “No way!”

Powerhouses were abundant like clouds in the Heavenspan World, Yue Mengli their bit of strength, going out alone to train was simply no different from seeking death.

One should not look at how the Heavenspan World was very well-ordered. Actually, dangers were everywhere.

Just take Coldfeather, their generation of powerhouses, how many were truly able to live move than 100 thousand years?

Li-er the few of them, if something were to happen to one of them, he could not forgive himself for life.

Ye Yuan’s attitude was clearly long within Yue Mengli’s expectations.

“Big Brother Yuan, Li-er knows that you have our interest at heart. But being under your protection all along, we can forever only look at you from behind! With your talent, the disparity between us will get greater and greater. All the way until the end, we are no longer able to keep up with your footsteps. I know how much hardships you suffered for Elder Sister Lingxue these few years, how much pressure you endured. We don’t hope to forever only be able to quietly watch you from behind and not be able to do anything! We hope that one day, we can fight side by side with you and not just be nervous with worry behind you,” Yue Mengli said.

White Light also spoke up at this time and said, “Big Brother, back then, we rampaged in all directions in the Immortal Grove World. At that time, I could still keep up with your footsteps. But now, I can only cheer you on at one side? Do you know how torturous it is for me? When at the Immortal Grove World, when that Heavenly Sin Heretic God appeared, you don’t know how powerless and in despair I felt! I don’t hope to forever only be able to pray for you to appear when I encounter danger! You can save us once, save us twice, but in the future?”

Ye Yuan looked at them, opened his mouth, but he did not know what he should say.
