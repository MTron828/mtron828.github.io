Chapter 1269: Great Dao Pill Refinement!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Big Brother Yuan!”

“Big Brother!”

“Master!”

...

Several shouts sounded at the same time, the voices full of panic and fear.

The half-divine artifact, Dragon Sovereign Cauldron, actually could not withstand the pressure of Heavenly Dao, and broke down at once!

The Dragon Sovereign Cauldron’s fragments scattered everywhere. A tremendous impact force flew towards everyone.

Kunwun just casually waved a hand and completely wiped out those fragments. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

But this was not the most important thing!

The most important thing was that the medicinal cauldron exploded, what should Ye Yuan do about the medicinal pill?

When they focused their eyes and looked over, they could not help being pleasantly surprised!

In front of Ye Yuan, a Tai Chi diagram formed.

In the center of the Tai Chi diagram, nine medicinal embryos were still being smelted by the Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame!

That Tai Chi diagram was incomparably profound. Ye Yuan took his time to perform the alchemy skills and was not the least bit moved by the Dragon Sovereign Cauldron’s collapse.

The current Ye Yuan already entered an extremely profound state.

Ye Yuan was clearly refining pills there, but Xiao Ruyan they all had an unreal feeling.

It was as if there was no Ye Yuan there.

What was there was just the vague and insubstantial Heavenly Dao.

The current Ye Yuan seemed to have incarnated to become Heavenly Dao!

This kind of wondrous spectacle was simply inconceivable.

“Great Dao pill refinement! This is the legendary Great Dao pill refinement! Hahaha ... I didn’t expect that this kind of marvelous spectacle actually appeared in an empyrean world! Old Fart Immortal Grove, oh Old Fart Immortal Grove, I really didn’t expect that your empyrean world that’s about to collapse actually produced such a figure! I look forward very much to whether or not he can give off a brilliant light over there!” Kunwu suddenly laughed loudly and said.

Xiao Ruyan they all were drawn over by Kunwu’s laughter. Clearly, they were also very curious about Ye Yuan’s current state.

“Senior, what’s this Great Dao pill refinement ... that you speak of?” Xiao Ruyan asked.

At this time, Kunwu’s gaze when looking at Ye Yuan already became different.

Before this, he was using a talking-down attitude to view Ye Yuan.

There was even a tiny hint of pity.

The Kunwu Divine Wood had lived for god knows how many years. One could even say that he was an existence that watched the Immortal Grove Region’s rise and decline.

Toward this empyrean world’s humans, they were lowly existences to him.

This sort of condescension was born in the bones. He could not change it!

But at this moment, Kunwu unknowingly got rid off that unconscious superiority feeling.

When he saw this scene happen, he finally looked squarely at Ye Yuan, this lowly person of an empyrean world.

“Saw that Tai Chi diagram?” Kunwu said.

Xiao Ruyan froze and said, “Saw it. Isn’t that condensed and formed by Master with the power of array formations?”

Kunwu laughed in spite of himself and said, “Array formation? Hahaha ... That isn’t array formation! That’s this Immortal Grove Region’s Heavenly Dao, materialized Heavenly Dao, remaining Heavenly Dao!”

“H-Heavenly Dao! Senior, you aren’t joking, right?” Xiao Ruyan’s mouth opened into a circle and was incredibly shocked.

Not just her, everyone had disbelieving looks. They all thought that Kunwu was joking.

What was Heavenly Dao?

That was a fleeting and ephemeral existence!

An completely intangible existence!

Martial artists could go and comprehend Heavenly Dao, but how could one possibly use Heavenly Dao to refine pills.

This ... This was too ludicrous!

It was something that was completely impossible to happen.

But Kunwu said with a disdainful smile, “Heavenly Dao isn’t as mysterious as you all imagine. The Heavenly Dao that you all cultivate is merely the Dao of someone else! This place is Old Fart Immortal Grove’s empyrean world. So the Heavenly Dao that you guys cultivate is all just his Dao. Therefore, as long as you all are still inside this Immortal Grove Region, it’s forever impossible for you all to surpass him. In fact, you guys can’t even touch the heels of his feet. If you guys can cultivate to one-ten thousandth of his, that’s already an invincible existence.”

Everyone exchanged glances, wanting to refute, but was also unable to refute.

Kunwu’s words were naturally strategically situated in an advantageous position.

The things that he knew were what they were unable to imagine.

Furthermore, according to the situation that they knew, what Kunwu said was totally right!

Looking at everyone’s astonished faces, Kunwu continued to speak with fervor and assurance, “However, that’s impossible! The realm of Empyrean is what you all are completely unable to imagine. At Old Fart Immortal Grove’s prime, it was also when the Immortal Grove Region’s Heavenly Dao was at its most powerful and flourishing! That Heavenly Dao, even I have to give way to avoid conflict too! But unfortunately now ... huhu, a hairless phoenix is inferior to a chicken!”

“This ... Senior, you haven’t said what is Great Dao pill refining?”

Kunwu disparaging the Divine Realm’s Heavenly Dao like this, Xiao Ruyan naturally felt a little upset in her heart.

It was just that she also knew what Kunwu said was the truth.

If not because of this, how could Deity Realm dwindle to zero?

Kunwu glanced at her and said with a smile, “The little lass isn’t willing to submit still! But, my, Old Kun’s, mood today is pretty good, I won’t fuss over it with you. Saying that the Heavenly Dao is not good, actually doesn’t have the intention of belittling it, but it’s saying that that master of yours is very strong! Great Dao pill refinement is refining medicinal pills with Great Dao as the furnace!” That master of yours triggered Great Dao resonance; this in itself is already something very seldom-seen. But I didn’t expect that he could actually even harness Heavenly Dao, refining the pill with Great Dao! Truly inconceivable!”

When the few people heard Kunwu’s words, all of them were shocked until they could not close their mouths.

Using Heavenly Dao to refine pills, this kind of thing, just thinking about it made one’s back run cold.

If not for Kunwu’s guidance, they would not dare to imagine at all that the Tai Chi diagram was actually the incarnation of Heavenly Dao!

Spreading this sort of thing, other people would definitely think that they were lunatics!

Kunwu said slowly, “For this boy to be able to harness Heavenly Dao, it shows that he has already obtained the Immortal Grove Heavenly Dao’s recognition. This is naturally not unrelated to the World Suppressing Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl. But to be able to accomplish this step, it isn’t merely related to those two items. Starting from today, he is different from you all already. He shall lord over all of you, becoming this Immortal Grove Region’s true god!”

The more they heard, the more shocked they became!

They were naturally very happy in their hearts to hear Kunwu’s words. But there was even more incredulity!

Kunwu’s every word struck viciously onto their hearts, making them feeling breathless.

The few people’s gazes when looking at Ye Yuan again all became different.

Especially, Li-er, who was his lover!

Her lover was actually going to tower above all life now!

The feelings at this time were very complicated.

Kunwu continued with his words hell-bent on shocking people to death and said, “Heh, triggering Heavenly Dao with Alchemy Dao, and obtaining Immortal Grove’s recognition from there! This boy truly amazes people! From now on, he can be said to have truly inherited Immortal Grove’s mantle! When his strength reaches a certain realm, he will be able to become this Immortal Grove Region’s new master! Even though this is just a dilapidated world.”

But regarding all this, Ye Yuan himself seemed to be oblivious to it.

He was already immersed in his own Dao. Refining the Dao Defying Pill was no longer a mission to him; it was to savor the feeling of sensing the Heavenly Dao.

This kind of feeling made his entire person feel like he was walking on clouds.
