Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Humph!?You still have the cheek to say those words! Who asked you to be so meddlesome, causing such a big problem? Do you really think that by relying on a Dragon Spring Sword, you can be invincible under the heavens? Jade Sovereign Heavens are Jade Sovereign Heavens after all!”

But the moment Ye Yuan opened his mouth, Mi Tian was upset and blamed Ye Yuan for being nosy.

What did Shuoyan’s life and death have to do with him?

Putting yourself in danger for someone that had nothing to do with you, it was a very foolish thing in Mi Tian’s eyes.

But Ye Yuan said, “You and I also had nothing to do with each other. Why did you dare entrust yourself to me? Aren’t you afraid that I will take your dragon heart in the future? Don’t say that my cultivation realm is low. I think that with my capability, my attainments in the future shouldn’t be low! Aren’t you afraid that I repay kindness with ingratitude?”

Being countered by Ye Yuan like this, Mi Tian was rendered speechless.

He had spent some time with Ye Yuan and knew that he was someone who valued sentiments.

If Ye Yuan was a despicable backstabber, he would have long taken Ye Yuan’s life.

Otherwise, after Ye Yuan’s strength becomes powerful in the future, he would not be able to control him at all.

With Ye Yuan’s ability, even without his help, his strength in the future absolutely could not be underestimated too.

Mi Tian had long seen through this.

Mi Tian let out a sigh and said, “You played the hero, but I’ll have to suffer! Relax your mind and let me control your body! I only have the power of one blow. After killing that Eight-spotted Leopard, you must escape immediately, understood?”

Ye Yuan was overjoyed when he heard that. His greatest threat was the Eight-spotted Leopard.

If he could kill him, he naturally had the confidence to run away!

Ye Yuan complied and relaxed his mind, only to feel a powerful to the extreme true dragon force flow out of the dragon heart, flowing into his four limbs and bones.

Instantly, Ye Yuan felt his entire body teem with power.

But at the same time, he also lost control of his body.

“Brat, how’s the taste of being nailed??Heh heh,?don’t blame me, want to blame, blame yourself for being meddlesome!” The Eight-spotted Leopard was unawares and was very pleased with himself.

But right at this time, a terrifying power surged from Ye Yuan’s body.

This power was strong until the point where it made his heart palpitate. It was even more terrifying than the pressure coming over from Shuoyan there.

This kind of bloodline power made him have an impulse to prostrate in worship.

The Eight-spotted Leopard’s expression changed wildly, and his figure retreated explosively.

His speed was quick to the extreme. With a flash, he was a thousand feet away.

But Mi Tian naturally would not give him the chance to escape. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Boy, remember the feeling of this move! It’s called Nine Heavens Dragon Transforming Fist. When cultivated to the extreme, one can shatter the void with their fists and smash galaxies!” Mi Tian started talking and spoke with Ye Yuan’s mouth.

Although Ye Yuan rescinded control of his body, he was this body’s master.

The feeling of dragon qi flowing in his body, he was deeply affected by it.

Along with the flow of the dragon qi, a mysterious power condensed on his fist as if it was born from nothing.

This surging feeling seemed to be able to punch a hole in the sky!

The Eight-spotted Leopard’s face turned from surprise to shock.

The power surging from this fist was sufficient to kill half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

That kind of destructive people simply made people despair.

He could not imagine how a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum could launch such a terrifying attack.

But now, he only had one thought. It was to run!

He urged the rule of wind and spatial rule to the extreme, only hating that his father and mother did not give birth to two more legs!

In a blink, he arrived ten miles away.

While the Purplelight Battle Wolf and the rest of the Jade Sovereign Heavens, when they saw this kind of power, how could they still dare to remain? They avoided the Eight-spotted Leopard one after another!

Boom!

A fist force rode on the air and went.

It was only to hear a bang. The Eight-spotted Leopard was directly blown into a mist of blood.

One punch directly blew a middle Jade Sovereign Heaven up!

He did not even have time to run away!

One had to know, the Eight-spotted Leopard was adept at speed!

All over the hills and valleys, it was deathly silent.

This sudden scene shocked everyone.

“This … What kind of terrifying power is this? Even if a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven is here, they will also be blown up by one punch, right?”

“Using this punch to kill Commander Eight-spotted Leopard is simply a cannon blasting at mosquitoes!”

“He’s clearly just a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven, but how is he able to unleash such a terrifying punch?”

“Damn it! Just what kind of monster did Young Master make us kill!”

… …

These true spirits originally thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure. How could they know that when Ye Yuan was on the verge of death, he suddenly retaliated, blowing up their strongest with one punch!

Furthermore, this punch was powerful to the extreme!

They believed that even if a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven was here, they would be blown up with one punch too!

This kind of terrifying power actually originated from the hands of a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven, how could they not be surprised?

Over there, Shuoyan suddenly erupted, his strength soaring, and he also rushed over toward Ye Yuan this side frantically.

It was just that his opponent was too strong, so he was held back.

But, when he saw that Ye Yuan actually retaliated in a desperate situation and unleashed such an astonishing strike, he was immediately greatly stimulated.

Swoosh!

Throwing a punch out, dragon qi receded like the tide. Ye Yuan instantly gained control over his body.

Without the slightest hesitation, he arrived beside Shuoyan with a flash, grabbed him, and headed to the depths of the giant mountain.

From the Eight-spotted Leopard’s figure retreating explosively, to being blown up, then to Ye Yuan breaking out of the heavy encirclement, to bringing Shuoyan and sprinting away madly, it was merely a few breaths of time.

Everyone was still immersed in shock and did not recover to their senses.

After they came back to their senses, Ye Yuan already broke out of the heavy encirclement.

The Purplelight Battle Wolf suddenly startled awake and said with a wild roar, “Chase! Chase for me! The two of them absolutely mustn’t leave alive! Otherwise, all of us have to die!”

This sentence startled everyone awake all at once. The eight Jade Sovereign Heavens’ figures suddenly erupted, chasing after Ye Yuan two people.

As soon as the Eight-spotted Leopard died, the Purplelight Battle Wolf automatically became the leader.

He took the lead, urging his speed to the extreme, wanting to catch Ye Yuan two people.

Ye Yuan was already an arrow at the end of its flight now. As long as he could catch up, he would definitely be able to kill Ye Yuan!

The Purplelight Battle Wolf was a veteran of a hundred battles too. Although Ye Yuan’s punch earlier was shocking, after that terrifying power appeared, it disappeared without a trace very quickly.

How could he still not understand? Ye Yuan only had the power of one strike!

Otherwise, Ye Yuan would have long blown them up with one punch each, why would he still escape?

In the forest, ten figures were shuttling indeterminately.

Ye Yuan was seriously injured and was hanging in there entirely by relying on a breath.

Furthermore, bringing Shuoyan, his speed was slowed down to begin with.

Otherwise, even if it was the Purplelight Battle Wolf, it could forget about catching up to them either.

But now, seeing as the distance was getting closer and closer, Shuoyan was greatly anxious in his heart.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, this was all my fault! It’s all my fault for dragging you down! Their target is me, if you throw me down, you’ll have a chance to escape!” Shuoyan said.

Although his strength improved greatly, it only reached the realm of upper Limitless Sublime Heaven too.

In terms of strength, he was still a long way off compared to Jade Sovereign Heaven. It was completely impossible to escape.

“Shut up!” Ye Yuan shouted coldly.

Suddenly, the Purplelight Battle Wolf’s expression changed, suddenly stopping the pursuit.

Ye Yuan two people were baffled, but having such a great opportunity, they naturally would not let it go, sprinting away even harder..
