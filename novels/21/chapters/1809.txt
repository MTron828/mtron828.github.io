Chapter 1813 Enlightening the Benighted!

On the couch, Qian Ye opened his eyes with difficulty. A hint of excitement flashed across his eyes.“I ... I didn’t die! Hahaha, I didn’t die!”

The feeling of those countless fragments piercing into the body was still vivid in his mind until now.

At that moment, he thought that he was dead for sure.

Except, he did not expect that he was actually saved.

By the side, Elder Tao said in a solemn voice, “Relax, Elder Jiang Hong personally moving out this time, no one can kill you!”

A hint of surprise flashed in Qian Ye’s eyes. For his sake, an skill-imparting elder actually personally took action.

This showed that his standing in the skill-imparting elder’s eyes and heart was still very high.

Skill-imparting elders normally came and went like shadows. They all, these disciples, could not get in contact with them at all and also did not know what the main peak’s intentions were.

The matters normally were all handled by Elder Tao, this Antehall elder.

“There’s actually such a thing! When this matter’s limelight blows over, I want to thank Elder Jiang Hong. I wonder if I’ll have the luck,” Qian Ye said excitedly.

Elder Tao’s expression was slightly grim as he said, “You’d better not be happy too early. Today, our Heavenly Bud Peak’s face was utterly lost. It was all caused by the Soaring Flower lineage. Elder Jiang Hong taking action to save you was merely being forced against his will. In the future, you have to cultivate hard and earn back our Heavenly Bud Peak’s face. His elderly self will naturally be happy.”

The moment Qian Ye heard, the excitement from earlier immediately dissipated into thin air.

“Ye Yuan that punk, d-didn’t die?” Qian Ye said with a baleful look.

“Die? Heh heh! Your business isn’t over yet!” Elder Tao laughed as he said with a sardonic face.

Qian Ye was taken aback when he heard that and said, “Not over yet?”

Elder Yao recounted the matter of Ye Yuan beating the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, Qian Ye could not help bursting into laughter when he heard it.

“Haha, this kid is also really a genius, to actually think of using this method to make me die! I admit that his talent is very high, but no matter how high, he’s also merely a Divine Lord Realm, he can sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum?”

When Qian Ye heard Ye Yuan’s ‘foolish’ actions, disdain was written all over his face.

How could someone possibly accomplish this kind of thing?

Elder Tao chuckled and said, “This kid is also a stubborn mule who can’t be pulled back by eight horses. You don’t know, but everyone’s gazes when looking at him back then was like looking at a fool.”

Elder Tao also disliked Ye Yuan, this incredibly stubborn fellow, very much.

He and Qian Ye exchanged a glance and both started laughing loudly.

Dong!

All of a sudden, a drumbeat that reverberated throughout the clouds shot up to the sky.

Elder Tao and Qian Ye were currently laughing away. When they heard this drumbeat, their faces suddenly changed.

Especially Qian Ye, the panic in his eyes could not be concealed no matter what.

“Elder Tao, what ... what ... drumbeat is this?”

In Qian Ye’s voice was a tremor that could not be concealed.

Elder Tao’s expression was also very ugly. His gaze revealed a look of shock and he said, “No idea how many people have sounded the drums in Shadowmoon Sect, but I’ve heard of someone who could transmit the drumbeat out of the Seven Stars Valley!”

Qian Ye’s experience and knowledge were inferior to Elder Tao’s after all. Hearing Elder Tao’s words, he immediately turned ashen pale.

“Then ... Then he ... wouldn’t ...”

Qian Ye felt his mouth and throat turn parch. That smug appearance just now could not be found at all.

Dong!

His voice had yet to fade when another earth-shaking drumbeat sounded out.

This sound was even louder than the one before.

At the same time, the entire Shadowmoon Sect was shocked.

It was still their first time hearing such a terrifying drum sound outside of the Seven Stars Valley.

This drum sound was like the muffled thunder in the sky as if it was heaven’s furious roar.

The sound of it could be heard clearly in every corner of the Shadowmoon Sect.

Everyone at the main peak, the nine great sub-peaks, the several hundred stray peaks, including every inch of Shadowmoon Mountain Range’s earth, could hear this drumbeat.

People slowly walked out of the halls, walked out of the abodes, gazes looking over in the direction of the Seven Stars Valley.

As Shadowmoon Sect disciples, they naturally knew what this drumbeat signified.

They were only concerned just how many times this drumbeat could sound out.

At this moment, each of their divine essence was seething, becoming incessantly surging along with this drumbeat.

This drumbeat seemed to have activated their bloodlines.

Quite a number of people actually started breaking through in the midst of this drumbeat.

Dong!

The third drumbeat sounded out, the expression on Baili Qingyan’s face could not hide the pleasant surprise and idolization.

“Senior Apprentice Sister, I’ve long told you that his edge can’t be stopped. Yet you didn’t believe it!”

Baili Qingyan did not turn around, she knew that Jiang Xueyan already arrived behind her.

Jiang Xueyan’s gaze revealed an extremely complicated look. Finally, she let out a sigh and said, “Silly lass, if he goes to the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, he’ll be your number one enemy!”

Baili Qingyan’s face revealed an extremely relieved look as she smiled and said, “So what? In this life, my zither strings are stirred by him!”

Jiang Xueyan’s gaze flickered incessantly. Finally, she still turned around and left.

Walking a few steps, she said softly, “Silly girl, can your affection really be rewarded?”

Finished talking, she turned around and left.

Dong!

The fourth drumbeat sounded out without a surprise.

Inside an area of void at the main peak, an old man slowly opened both eyes, his gaze incomparably deep.

“I didn’t expect that in this world, there’s actually really someone who can sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum!”

Dong!

Dong!

The fifth and sixth drumbeats sounded out.

Inside the Seven Stars Valley, the nine great skill-imparting elders looked at this scene incomparably shocked, their surging emotions unable to calm down for a long time. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

They were the closest to the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, the shock of these drumbeats, they felt it the strongest.

That wave after wave of Great Dao aura made them feel as if Heavenly Dao descended.

That shock simply could not use words to describe.

“This ... is the true power of the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum!”

“I really can’t imagine just how terrifying the attack power will be once a True God Realm sounds this drumbeat!”

“How on earth ... did this kid do it? He released all of the Great Dao power inside the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum. That’s how it triggered the entire Shadowmoon Sect’s resonance!”

“After going out this time, this old man will be going into seclusion! This drumbeat enlightens the benighted!”

...

This drumbeat seemed to have magical power, making their entire person have a feeling of being reborn anew.

The woodcutter’s shock was not the slightest bit less than the rest.

He looked at Ye Yuan’s back view, feeling that it was infinitely tall and big.

He knew that Ye Yuan’s talent was extremely strong, with his potential being immense. But he did not think that Ye Yuan was actually strong to this extent.

Strong to the point where it made him somewhat afraid!

The Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum that had never sounded in the Shadowmoon Sect echoed above the Shadowmoon Sect at this moment.

The first drumbeat dissipated after the drumbeats at the back appeared.

The second was similarly like so.

At this moment, six drumbeats could be heard clearly and distinguished clearly.

Dong!

Finally, the last drumbeat fell!

The entire Shadowmoon Sect started trembling.

Seven drumbeats like seven thunderclaps, they reverberated in the sky above the Shadowmoon Sect continuously.

Not only were there no signs of dissipating, but there was also a trend of becoming louder and louder instead.

Everyone was listening attentively, everyone was using their hearts to feel, and everyone was devoting their full attention to understanding it.

This drumbeat was extraordinary!
