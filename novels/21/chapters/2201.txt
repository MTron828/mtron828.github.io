Chapter 2205: Deity Realm Village

Under the attentive gazes of the villagers, Chen Yong and A’Xiu walked out of closed-seclusion.

The auras on their bodies were already totally different!

Deity Realm!

After these two people consumed the Jadeheart Pills that Ye Yuan refined, they broke through to Deity Realm without the slightest surprise!

Furthermore, these two people actually both reached middle-stage Grotto Profound Realm.

The power of the medicinal efficacy dumbfounded everyone.

With this kind of miraculous medicinal pill, how was there still a need to cultivate?

Prior to this, Chen Yong and A’Xiu still had a long way to go from the grand completion mortal realm.

But in a twinkle, they were already Deity Realm powerhouses.

The realm that was once far beyond reach, the Chen Village actually suddenly had four of them in one day. The villagers felt like they were dreaming.

“Tsk tsk, A’Ning is really our village’s treasure!”

“Uncle Yan, you really picked up a big treasure for our Chen Village!”

“A’Ning, my family’s Chun-er has just nicely reached a marriageable age. Why don’t you consider it?”

... ...

A group of villagers crowded around Ye Yuan, pulling and yanking on him, making Ye Yuan very uncomfortable.

“Alright, alright! A’Ning isn’t someone who belongs in a shallow pond, our village can’t hold him!” Chen Yan chased everyone away and said crossly.

He did not lose his head by everything in front of him. Being able to refine such magical medicinal pills, Ye Yuan was absolutely not an ordinary person.

How could a measly little Chen Village hold this great buddha?

Chen Yan sneaked a glance at his granddaughter. Seeing the look in his granddaughter’s eyes, he could not help sighing slightly in his heart.

Originally, everyone thought that A’Xiu and A’Yong were a pair. But Ye Yuan’s appearance completely unlocked A’Xiu’s maiden feelings.

It was just that, the dropping flowers pine for love, while the heartless brook will probably babble on!

Even if A’Xiu broke through to the Deity Realm now, she likely could not match up to Ye Yuan at all too.

Even though he did not know what kind of grade the Jadeheart Pills reached, without a doubt, it already exceeded his imagination!

Ye Yuan could even refine such heaven-defying medicinal pills under a state of amnesia and his divine essence being completely lost. It could be seen how formidable he was before.

“A’Yong, A’Xiu, why haven’t you come over and thank A’Ning?” Chen Yan said in a solemn voice.

Chen Yong’s expression was complicated. Finally, he still came before Ye Yuan and gave a bow, saying, “Many thanks, A’Ning!”

While A’Xiu said in surprise, “A’Ning, this medicinal pill is too magical! After I swallowed it, it’s simply like I can automatically cultivate, breaking through to the Deity Realm in a blink of an eye!”

Ye Yuan scratched his head and said with a vacant look, “Uh, is it very impressive? I don’t know either!”

A’Xiu nodded her head repeatedly and said, “Very impressive! Very impressive! Didn’t you see that Luo Sheng’s expression? He even wanted to cry previously!”

Ye Yuan smiled bashfully. Thinking about it, he seemed to really be quite impressive.

... ...

After several days, Chen Jian brought Luo Sheng back.

Everyone was very curious, not knowing what things Chen Jian brought back.

In front of everyone, Chen Jian chuckled and said, “Got to say, this guy really hid quite a number of good stuff these few years! Their Luo Village even got a miniature medicine garden and planted quite a few divine rank spirit medicines inside. This time, I raided all of them in one go.”

When Chen Yan and the rest listened until here, each and every one of their eyes shone.

What they hoped to hear the most right now were divine rank spirit medicines!

What did divine rank spirit medicines signify?

A stalk of quasi-divine rank Jadeheart Grass created four Grotto Profound Realm powerhouses.

If there was a batch of divine rank spirit medicines placed here ... what would happen later already did not need to think too much.

The villagers were all wildly ecstatic. If the spirit medicines were sufficient, could they also break through to the Deity Realm?

Rustle!

Chen Jian let out the bunch of things inside the storage ring. Chen Yan’s gaze turned intent, his face revealing a look of wild elation.

“Sundered Space Weed, Silver Frost Ginseng, Seamless Flower ... Also, this is a divine rank Jadeheart Grass! I didn’t expect that the Luo Village actually collected so many good things!” Chen Yan said agitatedly.

By the side, Luo Sheng had long become a bitter-gourd face.

The divine rank spirit medicines that he gathered these few years were planned on using for himself to break through.

Who knew that it was wiped out all at once today.

“A’Ning, this ...” Chen Yan looked toward Ye Yuan pleadingly, somewhat fidgety in his heart.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “I’ll give it a shot then!”

Chen Yan was overjoyed when he heard that and brought a bunch of spirit medicines into the refining room.

Following that, various sorts of light would come out of the refining room from time to time.

Outside the house, the expression of Luo Sheng who was watching Ye Yuan refine pills for the first time was fascinating to the extreme.

“This ... This is simply a miracle! I’ve never heard before that someone can refine pills like this! No wonder, no wonder your Chen Village has four Deity Realm powerhouses that appear all of a sudden! Who in the world is this young man?” Luo Sheng said in shock.

Chen Lie smiled until his mouth could not close, and he said with a proud look, “Three years ago, A’Ning sustained serious injuries. It was Uncle Yan and A’Xiu who saved him. As for who he is, we don’t know as well.”

Although he did not know, the smugness on Chen Lie’s face could not be concealed no matter what.

Because he knew that the Chen Village would become completely different from today onward!

Seeing Chen Lie’s expression, Luo Sheng’s heart felt as awful as having eaten a fly.

But he could not hold back his feelings of envy.

Freaking hell, why didn’t I encounter this sort of good thing?! Luo Sheng secretly cursed in his heart.

The efficiency of Ye Yuan’s array formation pill refinement was very high. In less than half a day, these spirit medicines that Chen Jian brought were refined into all sorts of medicinal pills by him.

Furthermore, each medicinal pill emitted an extraordinary aura. Clearly, the grade was extremely high.

Chen Yan, Chen Lie, and the rest had wide beams on their faces. With these medicinal pills, the Chen Village would completely soar to the sky with one bound!

... ...

Cloudriver County, City Lord Manor.

City Lord Huang Wei was currently discussing matters with the few major family heads in the city when City Guard Commander, Li Zhe, suddenly barged inside.

Huang Wei’s brows furrowed and he said, “What are you acting rashly for? Don’t know the rules?!”

But Li Zhe right away said, “Your Excellency, something big happened! This subordinate doesn’t dare to dawdle!”

Huang Wei said coolly, “My Cloudriver City has always been peaceful. What major thing can happen?”

Li Zhe said, “Your Excellency, a Deity Realm village appeared outside of Cloudriver City! Overnight, this Chen Village’s population of 121 people all broke through to Deity Realm!”

“What did you say?” When Huang Wei heard this, he suddenly shot to his feet, not quite daring to believe his ears.

“Overnight? Got to be a joke! The people in this village wouldn’t have been struck by lightning, right?”

“Commander Li, food can just be eaten, but words can’t simply be said! Even if a capital city’s Three-star Alchemy God came, it’s also impossible to create 100 over Deity Realms overnight, right?”

... ...

When the few family heads heard this, they all had disbelieving looks. They could not resist scoffing at Li Zhe.

But Li Zhe said, “Your Excellency, this subordinate has a squire who went to the Luo Village in the vicinity of this Chen Village. He returned to his hometown to pay a visit to his elders this time and brought back this news! At first, this subordinate didn’t believe it either. But this subordinate personally went to investigate and verify it. This matter is absolutely true!”

Everyone’s expression turned stiff with shocked faces.

Li Zhe personally took a trip, looks like it would not be wrong.

But this sort of thing was too fantastical!
