Chapter 3062: 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings!

“The Labyrinth Divine Palace is really extravagant! These palaces are completely made from galaxy profound gold. This wealth can probably directly purchase a plane!”

“You look at this lamp, it’s actually a grade one grandmist treasure! My God! This is also too freaking luxurious!”

“These stone slates, it all paved with Power Way Spirit Stones! Cultivating here is simply paradise!”

“Prodigal! Really prodigal!”

… …

Even if it was the group of Hegemon Realms, seeing the extravagance of the Labyrinth Divine Palace, they could not refrain from being jealous too.

These palaces could only be described by one word: luxurious!

Everyone wished to directly poach these palaces away.

Of course, they did so too.

Any good stuff that they saw, they directly poached them away.

The Labyrinth Divine Palace’s palaces gradually got taller in sequence.

That large palace at the back rose straight into the clouds, seemingly like a giant beast that could swallow everything.

Even when standing in front of it, one had an impulse to prostrate in submission too.

......

Among the surrounding main palaces, there were a total of 12 main palaces suspended around it, displaying an arrangement where stars surrounded the moon.

Ye Yuan heard that in its prime, the Labyrinth Divine Palace had 12 Great Beyond Realm powerhouses who were known as the 12 Heavenly Kings.

Regarding these 12 Heavenly Kings, each one was an important figure who shocked heaven and earth.

Hegemon Sevenway was one of them.

These 12 Heavenly King Palaces were the residences of the 12 Great Beyond powerhouses.

“These 12 Heavenly King Palaces, you all don’t enter it. ‘Search on google’ Those Hegemon Realms are all aiming for the Heavenly King Palaces and the Labyrinth Divine Hall. Once there are any clashes, we aren’t Hegemon Realm, the consequences will be too dreadful to contemplate. Everyone all look for lucky chances in the palace groups below. With the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s foundation, if you all are lucky, there might be a few who can step into Hegemon Realm,” Ye Yuan instructed Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s people.

“Heavenly Saint Ye, you understand Heaven formation now. We aren’t scared of them!” Hu Gaoshan said.

Clearly, he still did not give up.

The biggest lucky chances were clearly inside the 12 Heavenly King Palaces and the Labyrinth Divine Hall.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The range that Heaven formation covers is only up to here too. Regarding the 12 Heavenly King Palaces and the Labyrinth Divine Hall, with Hegemon Sevenway’s strength, they can’t be covered at all. If we go over there, life and death won’t be up to us anymore.”

Only then did everyone come to a realization.

The 12 Heavenly King Palaces and the Labyrinth Divine Hall were the nucleus of the Labyrinth Divine Palace. Each of their owner’s strengths was not weaker than Hegemon Sevenway.

Although the Heaven formation was strong, it was not invincible either.

“Doesn’t that mean that we have to helplessly watch the good stuff be taken away by that bunch of fellows?” Yang Qing said unwillingly.

Ye Yuan said, “That might not be the case. Everything is up to fate. Sometimes, destiny is more important than strength.”

Boom!

Before his voice faded, a loud noise came from above the void.

It turned out that they had already exchanged blows.

This was two great Supreme Hegemons, one of them was Hegemon Yun Shang, while the other was a fiend race Supreme Hegemon.

“Old Dog Zhen Yi, this seat is here for the Immortal Cloud Cone! If you dare snatch it, we’ll be irreconcilable till death today!”

Hegemon Yun Shang’s angry roar came from above the void.

At this time, Hegemon Yun Shang was already beyond furious. When fighting, he fought until the void fractured.

However, the Heavenly King Palaces were extremely sturdy and actually did not budge an inch.

On the other side, the strength of the fiend race Supreme Hegemon was also not the slightest bit weaker.

The two people’s battle was fought extremely trepidatiously.

Before long, a great battle also erupted in the Burning Sky Heavenly King Palace too.

Those participating in the battle this time were similarly Supreme Hegemons!

Very soon, terrifying battles erupted in the 12 Heavenly King Palaces virtually at the same time.

Around the Heavenly King Palaces, the sky was already rent asunder, and the earth split open by the berserk power of origins.

Those that were strong, their strength was already close to Great Beyond?powerhouses1!

When those geniuses who did not enter the Heavenly King Palaces looked at the terrifying battles above the void, each and every one of them was extremely shocked.

“My God, there are actually so many hidden Supreme Hegemons!”

“Luckily I didn’t go up; otherwise, I’d have already been reduced to dust now, right?”

“18 Supreme Hegemons! How many big shots came?!”

… …

Very soon, even more Supreme Hegemons debuted, shocking everyone until their jaws hit the ground.

As for some ordinary Hegemons and Peak Hegemons, they joined the battles one after another too.

The various major camps fell into frenzied great battles, vying for the treasures.

Some origin powerhouses and Emperor Sakra Heavens who overestimated their own ability were directly reduced to dregs by this power.

Boom!

Hegemon Yun Shang’s palm went past. Hegemon Kong Hai took the palm solidly.

Only to see his body fall down, already ceased breathing.

A Hegemon fell!

Everyone’s complexions were deathly pale, and only then they realized the horror of the battle.

Shortly after, more and more Hegemons fell.

In a blink of an eye, seven to eight ordinary Hegemons fell, and more than 20 Hegemons severely wounded!

Only then did everyone know it turned out that in the eyes of top powerhouses, ordinary Hegemon Realms were nothing more than this too.

… …

But at this time, in the Heavenly King Palaces, there were still some people who were aloof and indifferent to the battles outside.

A middle-aged man in a black robe was currently sizing up everywhere.

Suddenly, his gaze landed on a table.

There was a pen rack on the table. He extended his hand to move the pen rank and discovered that it could not be moved. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

His hand brushed over several pens and suddenly stopped on one of the pens.

Then he turned it.

Swoosh!

Behind the table, a spatial door actually appeared!

An extremely thick Heavenly Dao aura faintly transmitted out of the spatial door.

The corners of the black-robed middle-aged man’s mouth curled slightly, and he said with a faint smile, “Old Man Heavenless, do you think that by hiding it covertly, this seat won’t be able to find it? This seat will be accepting one of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings!”

When the black-robed middle-aged man came out of the spatial door, there was an additional red-green jade scroll in his hand.

This red-green jade scroll was crystal clear, a majestic Great Dao aura appearing on it. One look and it was clear that it was not ordinary!

The black-robed man was overjoyed, an extremely smug expression appearing on his face as he laughed loudly and said, “Old Man Heavenless, you were called the number one genius since ancient times. Actually, it was merely by relying on the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings! Having acquired one, it will be effortless for this seat to surpass you! Watch closely!”

“Brother Ming Hui, aren’t you being pleased with yourself a little too early?” In the great hall, another figure appeared at god knows when. It was a 20 years old looking youth in an azure shirt.

When the black-robed man saw him, his pupils constricted!

But very soon, he smiled coldly and said, “Ming Hui? How long has it been since I’ve heard this name! Old Man Endless, the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings have 12 scrolls, and yet you want to fight with me for one?”

The 20 years old youth in the azure shirt smiled and said, “The one in your hand is the most precious Heaven scroll. Do you think that this seat will let it go? Hand it over so as to avoid the harmonious relations between us brothers being harmed.”

The black-robed man’s eyes turned cold, and he said with a cold smile, “Old Man Endless, do you think that you’ve cornered this seat?”

The 20 years old youth in the azure shirt just smiled lightly and did not speak.

But the black-robed person’s pressure suddenly increased.

Nobody knew that Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven’s overlord level powerhouse, the 33 Heavens’ number one Alchemy Dao person, Ancestor Endless, actually appeared here too!

At the same time, in a palace below, Ye Yuan took a tattered goat-skin scroll from an old bookshelf.

This goat-skin scroll was full of dust, looking extremely ordinary.

Ye Yuan lightly wiped off the dust on it, only to see an extremely ancient word written on it.

But Ye Yuan recognized this word at first glance: Heaven!
