1837 Realm Heart Island

Yang Shen died, and then the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s fierce fighting continued.

But because of this great battle, the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s setup underwent a dramatic change.

Ye Yuan naturally outshone the others, no one could surpass him anymore.

Even when encountering Luo Zhen later, he also directly admitted defeat after a hundred moves.

However, Luo Zhen’s position of second place was also considered secure.

But the struggle for third to fifth place seemed especially intense.

The competition continued for more than a year, but the gap between third place and tenth place also did not pull apart.

Among these eight people, any one of them had a possibility of entering the top five in the end.

However, in the final round, no one could have expected that Baili Qingyan obtained the fourth place in the end.

This way, the Shadowmoon Sect suddenly got two places.

Du Rufeng stood on the high platform and announced calmly, “This Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s top five, Ye Yuan, Luo Zhen, Tian Dajiang, Baili Qingyan, and Li Long, shall enter the temple. Ten days later, these five people will enter the void realm heart and comprehend Great Dao. The other disciples can go up Skyjade Cliff to comprehend Dao for ten years. After ten years, you must leave the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm!”

The disciples who took part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, after hearing Du Rufeng’s announcement, they all sighed endlessly.

“Before coming to the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm, no one could have imagined that the High Clarity Sect would actually be shaved bald, right?”

“Isn’t that so? Later on, Chen Tianlian practically gave up himself. Whoever he met, he directly conceded defeat. He was afraid that Ye Yuan would kill him! What a coward, the High Clarity Sect’s face is utterly lost by him!”

“Heh, what face does the High Clarity Sect still have? This can’t blame him either. Even Yang Shen died in Ye Yuan’s hands, so how can he not be scared? But like this is good too. At least, he preserved his life.”

“In comparison, the little-known Shadowmoon Sect actually obtained two seats. This really made people’s jaws drop.”

...

The powerful High Clarity Sect did not even have one enter the top five in the end.

Chen Tianlin’s strength originally could definitely enter the top five. But ever since Yang Shen was killed, he would concede no matter who he met.

Chen Tianlin was very smart. He yielded to Ye Yuan in this manner, hoping that he would show mercy and not kill him.

In the end, Ye Yuan indeed let him go.

During this Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, Ye Yuan’s domineering rise changed the fate of many genius disciples.

“Ye Yuan, thank you!” Baili Qingyan came in front of Ye Yuan and gave thanks sincerely.

She understood that with her original strength, it was impossible to enter the temple.

But in this one year plus time, Ye Yuan first helped her refine the Jadethaw Purpleheart Pill, then fed her moves, causing her strength to improve greatly. Only then did she rank into the top five.

One could say that for her to be able to enter the temple, it was entirely forged by Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Your talent is pretty good in the first place. I was merely adding flowers to embroidery.”

Baili Qingyan could not resist rolling her eyes at Ye Yuan. Was this guy knocking people down on purpose?

Comparing talent, was there anyone greater than you?

What was laughable was that she even thought that Ye Yuan was a trash back then, dragging Ye Yuan into a partnership to enter the Shadowmoon Mountain Range.

Thinking about it now, Baili Qingyan actually felt a hint of sweetness.

Except, she realized now that along with the passing of time, the sense of alienation between Ye Yuan and her was actually gradually increasing.

This was not just the disparity in strength, but that Ye Yuan seemed to have the intention of keeping her at a distance.

This kind of alienation was not the alienation of distance, but it was emotional estrangement.

It seemed that no matter what and when, Ye Yuan would have a professional-like attitude toward her.

This attitude made Baili Qingyan very dejected.

At this time, Xu Yan also went to congratulate. Xu Yan said, “Before coming to the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm, he never would have dreamed that our Shadowmoon Sect can actually obtain two spots. When we return, the sect master will definitely be very happy.”

Obtaining two spots was not just a matter of reputation. The temple would also give certain rewards to True God level sects according to headcount.

This kind of reward had a very far-reaching impact on True God level sects.

Hence, that was why the various major sects would spare no efforts to groom disciples and supply talents to the temple.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “This one year plus, Ye Yuan is grateful for Elder Xu’s care and is endlessly grateful. Ye Yuan has nothing to repay with and presented Buddha with borrowed flowers, giving these medicinal pills to Senior Apprentice Sister Jiang and Senior Apprentice Brother Yi.”

Jiang Xueyan and Yi Qingxiang’s eyes turned sharp and they cried out in shock: “Tendon Changing Spirit Bamboo Pill, Brahma Dragon Break Pill, these ... these medicinal pills are too precious!”

Although these spirit medicines were all sealed, they knew that Ye Yuan taking action would absolutely all be divine-grade and above quality.

These medicinal pills, miss this village and there would not be this shop anymore.

Among the sects, it was absolutely impossible for there to be anyone who could refine this grade of medicinal pills.

These medicinal pills had tremendous benefits to the two people’s cultivation in the future. It can let him pass barriers smoothly, going further!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Thanks to Treasure Pig, I don’t lack spirit medicines when refining pills now. Hence, I dug some medicinal pills from his mouth and gave them to you.”

The two people looked at Ye Yuan, eyes full of gratitude.

“This ... Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, in the past, it was all my fault, hope that you don’t take it badly,” Jiang Xueyan’s face turned red as she apologized.

Yi Qingxiang also said, “Back then, I also harbored malicious intentions toward Junior Apprentice Brother Ye. Mentioning this, I’m really ashamed.”

Presently, they already understood that whatever faction struggle was simply floating clouds in front of a genuine powerhouse.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “That’s all past matters, don’t need to mention anymore. But, there are some words that I want to remind you guys, the might of a sect isn’t brought up amidst internal friction. Rather than spend time bringing other factions down, might as well spend more time to cultivate.”

The two nodded their heads, deeply feeling that way too.

...

On a small boat, seven people and one pig were currently heading for the depths of the Spirit Nether Sea. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Bamboo Groove Holy Realm is merely the outermost rites ground of the temple, the place that connects the temple with the outside world. The temple has a total of five palaces, branched out on five islands. They are respectively controlled by five great Empyrean elders. And these five great islands surround another island. It’s the most important place in the Bamboo Groove Void Realm: the Realm Heart Island. The heart of the void realm is on this Realm Heart Island.”

Du Rufeng spoke with ease and fluency, introducing the temple’s situation to the five disciples.

As the few people listened, their faces revealed rapt looks.

This place was where the nucleus of the Bamboo Groove Void Realm lay!

The small boat pulled into the shore, Du Rufeng said to the few people, “There are restrictions everywhere on Realm Heart Island, all of you follow closely! Once you trigger the restrictions, immortals can’t save you guys too!”

The few people’s expressions turned fearful when they heard that, revealing a hint of solemnness.

Ye Yuan looked at Little Tong and said with a curious face, “We’re going to the heart of the void realm. You’re going too?”

Little Tong rolled his eyes and said huffily, “Why? You have a problem?”

Du Rufeng chuckled and said, “Opening the heart of the void realm needs to borrow the power of Lord Treasure Pig. And Lord Treasure Pig and Little Tong are always together. So, he definitely has to go.”

“Heard that?” Little Tong said with a smug look.

“Grunt, grunt!”

Treasure Pig also grunted at Ye Yuan like taking credit for someone else’s achievements.
