1839 Kidnapping an Empyrean

Inside the barrier, Kong Wen and Kong Chen looked at the Ye Yuan above the void with envious looks.

“Tsk tsk, us two brothers spent nearly 400 thousand years to comprehend to fourth firmament spatial law! This brat is just over a thousand years old and actually already did it to this level!” Kong Wen lamented.

The Kong Family was a family clan that guarded the heart of the void realm for generations. They had a natural advantage in comprehending spatial law.

Furthermore, the Kong brothers were also considered among the best in the Kong Family.

But even so, they only started comprehending spatial law when they reached the late-stage Celestial Deity Realm.

Furthermore, the time that they spent was extremely long!

But Ye Yuan only used a thousand over years and completed something that they comprehended for 400 thousand years.

This kind of natural aptitude could be rated as freakish.

Little Tong rolled his eyes at him and said, “Wonder who was it who said that this season’s disciples can’t make it!”

Kong Wen’s expression turned stiff and he said embarrassedly, “Your Excellency, I ... Didn’t I not know?”

Little Tong snorted coldly and said, “If you don’t know, then don’t simply say things. Some people are existences that you have to look up to all your life. Therefore, be more low-key in conduct.”

Kong Wen had an appearance like he learned a lesson and said, “Yes, Your Excellency! Kong Wen won’t dare next time!”

Right at this time, the Ye Yuan above the void slowly opened his eyes and let out a sigh as he said, “Spatial law is indeed incredibly marvelous. The comprehension ends here as well.”

When the Kong Wen duo heard these words, they nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood and cursed, “You scoundrelly brat, intentionally aggravating us? From initial-stage fourth firmament to peak initial-stage, I used a full 50 thousand years!”

Spending three years’ time, Ye Yuan’s spatial law comprehension reached peak initial-stage Fourth Firmament and was unable to make any more progress.

Ye Yuan said it not without reason. But this speed in Kong pWen two people’s view was already a heaven-defying existence. It was also no wonder that he was very depressed when he heard it.

Ye Yuan’s figure swayed. When he appeared again, he already arrived beside Little Tong and the rest.

Spatial law fourth level, spatial shift!

Before this, Ye Yuan could shuttle through the void, but it was all within a very small range.

But now, Ye Yuan would be several hundred thousand miles away with a thought. The two could not be mentioned in the same breath at all.

Celestial Deity powerhouses could also utilize spatial law and shuttle through the void. But their speed compared to Ye Yuan’s was like heaven and earth. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Little Tong, you follow me. I have something to tell you,” Ye Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and said.

Little Tong was somewhat uncertain, not knowing what Ye Yuan had up his sleeves, but he still followed.

“What is it? Quickly spit out what you have!” The two people came to a deserted place and Little Tong said with displeasure.

Ye Yuan flashed a smile at Little Tong and suddenly made a move like lightning, swiftly tapping a few times on Little Tong’s body.

Little Tong’s face changed, unable to use an ounce of his strength.

“Boy, do you know what you’re doing?” Little Tong said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t get agitated first, I have something to discuss with you, my Lord Empyrean!”

Little Tong’s face changed and he said, “What are you talking about? I don’t understand!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “A straightforward person doesn’t beat around the bush, Lord Empyrean. Stop pretending. When those True God powerhouses saw you, each and every one of their faces was not right. Even I can’t even perceive this, then I’d also be too stupid.”

Actually, Ye Yuan felt that something was wrong with Little Tong long ago. He kept saying that Treasure Pig was his pet, but how could a strange pet like Treasure Pig be handed to a child?

Also, even though Du Rufeng deliberately hid it, his respect for Little Tong sometimes showed up unintentionally.

Coupled with the expressions when the Kong brothers saw Little Tong, Ye Yuan was very certain that Little Tong was not some Empyrean powerhouse’s grandson, but the Empyrean himself!

It was just that no idea for what reason, Little Tong became this current appearance.

Little Tong’s expression was ugly to the extreme and he said, “Could it be that you’re Daoless that old dog’s man? Don’t you forget, this place is the divine temple! If you dare to touch me, Du Rufeng and the Kong brothers won’t let you off!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Daoless? That’s also an Empyrean powerhouse of the temple, right? But he has nothing to do with me. Calling you here, I actually just want to negotiate a deal with you.”

Only after hearing Ye Yuan’s words did Little Tong’s face ease up slightly.

But he also knew that the deal Ye Yuan was talking to him about was definitely not something good. Otherwise, he also would not need to restrain him.

This fellow had such gall. Since he knew his identity, he still dared to take liberties with him. Wasn’t he scared of him taking revenge?

“Speak!” Little Tong said huffily.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I want to invite you to go to the Heavenspan World together with me!”

Hearing this, Little Tong’s expression suddenly changed and he cried out in surprise: “You! You’re a person of the Heavenspan World? This ... This is impossible!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Are you talking about my divine essence? Huhu, the cultivation method that I cultivate is a little special. Mimicking the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s divine essence isn’t a big deal to me.”

Little Tong’s expression was ugly as he said, “Impossible! You can forget about it!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders, patted Treasure Pig’s baby pink little head, and said with a doleful look, “Treasure Pig, sorry, not that I’m not willing to refine medicinal pills for you. If we’re fated in the future ... we’ll still meet again.”

“Grunt, grunt!”

Treasure Pig suddenly broke free from Little Tong’s arms and used a pair of short pig hoofs to hug Ye Yuan’s thighs, eyes brimming with tears, a look of reluctance to part.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Not that I’m heartless, it’s that the Heavenspan World still has many things waiting for me to go do! Uh ... maybe in the future, when I finish settling everything, I’ll come to the Bamboo Groove Void Realm to find you again, alright?”

Treasure Pig’s little head shook like a rattle-drum, clutching Ye Yuan’s leg desperately, unwilling to let go.

When Little Tong saw this scene, he was furious until he gnashed his teeth and cursed, “Shameless!”

Ye Yuan looked at Little Tong and said helplessly, “Actually, I took part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, my goal was in order to enter the heart of the void realm. It’s just a pity that I have ties in the Bamboo Groove Void Realm now. Once I leave the Bamboo Groove Void Realm, you all will definitely make a move on the Shadowmoon Sect. No choice, I can only take this step. Furthermore, your current state isn’t able to refine medicinal pills for Treasure Pig at all. You going to the Heavenspan World together with me is the best choice.”

Little Tong looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly, not expecting that he actually had such plans.

It seemed like this boy was someone who valued relationships.

Actually, on the whole, Ye Yuan did not live happily in the Shadowmoon Sect.

In fact, for the sake of killing Qian Ye, he even incurred resentment with the sect master.

But, without the Shadowmoon Sect, this springboard, there was no way he could enter the heart of the void realm.

Ye Yuan asked for a clear conscience when doing things.

If he left the Bamboo Groove Void Realm rashly, it would definitely implicate the Shadowmoon Sect. They might even be destroyed because of it.

Before he left, he had no choice but to take the Shadowmoon Sect into consideration.

Originally, he was still struggling with how to deal with this matter. But after he discovered Little Tong’s identity, he had this bold plan.

Furthermore, Treasure Pig was very reliant on Ye Yuan now. If Ye Yuan left, probably no one could satisfy it anymore.
