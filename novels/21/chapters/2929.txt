Chapter 2928: Grand Awakening Qin Shitian!

Out of 97 people, there were only 79 people who entered the Soul Refining Furnace in the end.

The Nirvana Soul Hall could freely control the number of Soul Refining Furnace’s projections.

Qin Shitian arrived before the Soul Refining Furnace that belonged to him and involuntarily took a deep breath.

Against 42 kinds of chaos Dao fires, this was really tremendous pressure!

Even if he had experienced life and death countless times, facing such enormous pressure, he could not be composed and collected too.

He could not resist glancing in Ye Yuan’s direction and discovered that Ye Yuan was currently sizing the Soul Refining Furnace up with interest. Not the slightest pressure could be seen.

Qin Shitian’s heart could not help turning cold!

Why is this guy so relaxed?

Hang on!

It was him who was too nervous!

Facing 42 kinds of Dao fires, he was unprecedentedly nervous!

This was a desperate situation, with virtually no possibility of returning alive.

Hence, he was somewhat at a loss on what to do.

In the past, whenever he was faced with a desperate situation, he could cope with it calmly.

What was going on this time?

Qin Shitian spat out a mouthful of turbid breath heavily, his entire person suddenly being unprecedentedly relaxed.

Wanting to look down on the enemy strategically, one must attach importance to the enemy in terms of tactics!

Qin Shitian did not expect that he actually found himself again in Ye Yuan!

Got beaten again!

Qin Shitian was proud and also monstrous.

It was just that he did not expect that after entering the hall entrance assessment this time, he would be pressed to the ground by Ye Yuan and dragged across it time and again.

Panicked!

“Thank you, Ye Yuan!” Qin Shitian suddenly said.

Ye Yuan was stunned and could not help looking toward Qin Shitian, suddenly discovering that the other party had become somewhat different.

Yes, this guy found his original heart again himself.

Hence, he smiled slightly and said, “Don’t mention it.”

But Qin Shitian’s expression turned intent, and he said, “However, I won’t lose to you in this round!”

Ye Yuan just smiled slightly, rising into the air and landing inside the Soul Refining Furnace.

A burning sensation hit him head-on.

“Huhu,?Shitian found his original heart again and had a grand awakening! In this battle, he absolutely won’t lose to Ye Yuan! Perhaps, my estimation of him is still far, far lower! This seat feels that he might really create a miracle, walking out safely from under the soul refinement of 42 kinds of chaos Dao fires! Perhaps … he’s the next Hegemon Heaven Subduer!”

Great Emperor Eastsun clearly felt Qin Shitian’s change too.

Earlier, he was still worried. But now, he was not worried at all anymore.

At this time, he was incomparably certain that Ye Yuan was just Qin Shitian’s whetting stone!

Because at this time, Qin Shitian was already equipped with all the qualities that a powerhouse needed to have.

He had no reason not to rise up!

Great Emperor Westdawn also nodded and said, “Originally, I also felt that it was messing around a little. But now, I’m very optimistic about Qin Shitian too.”

Even the Great Emperor Woodrelease, who had been silent all along, also said, “That’s right, Qin Shitian is very likely to soar to the heavens in one bound!”

Three great emperors putting the word out at the same time. This was virtually a final verdict already!

Many people started to get excited again.

Could it be that they were still going to witness a miracle again today?

Ye Yuan won two matches in a row. In the end, was he still going to be trampled by Qin Shitian?

That would really be a great reversal!

No matter what, just wait and see!

Great Emperor Eastsun fired out one soul seal after another. Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian’s Soul Refining Furnaces seemed to have one shackle after another added on.

Each time one was fired out, everyone’s heart tensed up a bit!

Finally, he fired out 35 shackles, coupled with the originally locked in seven kinds of Dao fires, it was 42 kinds!

With this, everyone knew that these two people could not get out anymore!

Against 42 kinds of chaos Dao fires, even thinking about it made people’s hair stand on end.

Boom!

A purple flame lit up at the same time in the 79 Soul Refining Furnaces!

The Soul Refining Furnaces were completely filled with purple flames.

That berserk fire tongue devoured everyone’s bodies at once.

“Ahh!!”

“Ahh!!”

“Ahh!!”

Several miserable cries transmitted over, the examinees in several Soul Refining Furnaces directly turned to ashes!

Everyone’s expression could not help changing.

They knew that chaos Dao fire was strong but did not expect that it was so strong.

Those few people simply disappeared virtually without the strength to resist.

Those examinees who withdrew could not help wiping away cold sweat.

“Luckily, I pulled out. Otherwise, with my strength, I’ll definitely be the same as them.”

“This is the legendary Purplesun True Fire. The power is indeed terrifying!”

“I heard that this Purplesun True Fire is an extreme yang and indomitable fire. It can burn all life in heaven and earth! Back then, my soul race’s Hegemon Purplesun completely burned a human Hegemon to nothingness with this fire!”

… …

The moment the Dao fire emerged, it caused an uproar.

This Purplesun True Fire had a great reputation. It was the lifeblood Dao fire of the soul race’s Hegemon Purplesun. It had boundless power.

Those who withdrew from the test all secretly heaved sighs of relief one after another.

So what if they lost some face? It was better than losing their lives!

“Argh!?Delightful! Come on! Again!” Inside the Soul Refining Furnace, Qin Shitian cried out in pain as he shouted arrogantly. It was as if he was crazy.

Clearly, he was not having a good time in this Soul Refining Furnace.

But his performance made everyone extremely surprised. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Because the others were already exhausting all of their strength just to resist the tempering of the Dao fire, how could they still have the time to shout?

Qin Shitian being like this, it showed that he still had strength leftover.

On the contrary, there was not much activity over at Ye Yuan there.

However, this was just the first Dao fire. There was clearly nothing that could be seen.

With Ye Yuan’s nine wroughts soul body, it was clearly not difficult to resist seven kinds of Dao fire.

Every four hours, a Dao fire would descend!

Four hours later, the second Dao fire descended!

Hence, several other examinees died inside the Soul Refining Furnace.

Time slowly trickled by, the third, the fourth, all the way until the sixth. With each Dao fire that descended, there were many examinees who died.

When it reached the sixth, there were already more than 40 people who had died.

The death rate was not an ordinary kind of high!

But right at this time, an accident happened!

“Hahaha,?finally broke through!” Qin Shitian’s loud laughter came out.

Seven wroughts!

Experiencing the baptism of six kinds of Dao fires, Qin Shitian finally broke through to seven wroughts!

“Sure enough, it came!”

“Against six kinds of Dao fire, the others were all exhausted from dealing with them. But Qin Shitian could break through his own shackles. Remarkable!”

“Now, Ye Yuan became the one being challenged! He’s nine wroughts. It’s probably not easy for him to want to reach the legendary ten wroughts!”

“Next, it will depend on how far Qin Shitian could go! If he can reach nine wroughts too, then he’ll really soar to the heavens in one bound!”

… …

Qin Shitian’s breakthrough made everyone faintly look forward to it.

Very soon, the seventh kind of Dao fire descended!

A large group died at once!

Every seventh kind was a major hurdle!

The power of the chaos Dao fire would suddenly soar significantly.

The initial 79 people were actually only left with a little over 20 people now!

The death rate was even higher than imagined!

“Hahaha?… I finally passed the round! I passed! God knows how Your Father pulled through!” Suddenly, someone shouted loudly and actually had already passed the round.

“Your Father passed the round too! F*cking hell, Your Father isn’t entering the Soul Refining Furnace ever again!?Sniff sniff?…” This person actually cried.

These few people were all challengers with very eye-catching performances in the first two rounds.

It could be seen how terrifying this round was!
