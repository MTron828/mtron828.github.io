Chapter 2305: Heavenly Emperor Distantbook

After Azurefeather left, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure was still in shock.

“Lord Azurefeather is a Heavenly Emperor of Cloudheart Realm who walks the world. His status is extremely respected, being no less than many holy lands’ ancestors! Ye Yuan’s one sentence can actually make him come in person?” Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure said in surprise.

“Maybe this is looking on the account of Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s face, right? The Priest Temple is an alchemy holy land second only to Cloudheart Realm after all!” Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun said.

At this time, a Heavenly Emperor Realm powerhouse passed by and just happened to hear this. He could not help laughing and said, “Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s face? Huhu, you guys are Second Sage’s poor relatives, right?”

Whose family did not have a few poor relatives?

Zhuo Yun the rest instinctively wanted to get angry, but the strength of this person in front of them was clearly much stronger than them. They could not afford to offend him!

They then heard his explanation. He said, “You guys just came, it’s also normal to not know! Heh heh, Second Sage’s name was fought out by himself with real swords and spears. It was not by relying on Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s blessings. It’s true that Lord Azurefeather’s status is revered, but in front of Second Sage, it’s nothing at all!”

“Hiss ...”

The few people drew a breath of cold air, feeling shocked.

Azurefeather’s status was already an existence far beyond their reach.

Ye Yuan’s status was actually even higher than his!

Just how long had they not met? Ye Yuan was already so formidable?

Actually, it was just that their knowledge and experience were shallow. That was all.

If Pilljade knew the existence of Dao pills, he would be able to recognize that the Chaos Samsara Pill which Ye Yuan refined back then was already sufficient to attain mastery.

That Heavenly Emperor powerhouse briefly talked about the commotion that Ye Yuan caused recently, making the few people stare dumbfounded with their mouths agape.

Even the Lord Azurefeather who was too high to be reached in their eyes was actually punished by Ye Yuan to kneel just recently! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

That would have been alright, but he still had to come and do things for Ye Yuan obediently now!

One person challenged five great holy lands, pressuring until the five great holy lands lowered their heads.

What breadth of spirit was this!

They did not even dare to think about it at all.

They just entered Cloudheart Realm and did not understand the situation here at all.

But only at this time did they know what kind of place Feather Mountain was.

“Heh heh, although I don’t know what happened on Cloud Summer Mountain, right now, many people are all guessing that Ye Yuan’s strength already reached the level of an ancestor, and can sit with those top ancestors as equals already! Do you think that he’s relying on Sacred Ancestor High Priest? If this emperor was you guys, I’d immediately go before Sacred Ancestor High Priest to grovel and curry favor. If one can obtain one or two of his rewards, that will really be having a meteoric rise in the future!”

After that Heavenly Emperor finished talking, he turned around and left, leaving behind everyone who was staring dumbfounded with their mouths agape.

... ...

Along with the passing of time, alchemy powerhouses gathered from all directions. Cloudpill became more and more lively.

In the city, in the streets and alleys, there were alchemy powerhouses battling in alchemy everywhere.

Among them, it was naturally Cloudheart City’s powerhouses who were a notch better.

Medicine Ancestor had the Heavenspan World at his beck and call for countless years and had long already developed Cloudheart Realm into an extremely powerful alchemy holy land, experts plentiful as clouds.

Even many major alchemy holy lands in the outside world had all kinds of connections with Cloudheart Realm too.

Dao Realm powerhouses that were hard to come by in the outside world were as plentiful as oxen hair here.

Even Ancestor Realm powerhouses had no shortage of people too.

In contrast, Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma’s foundation was too shallow.

Ye Yuan brought Yun Yi two people to battle in alchemy everywhere every day, exchanging on Alchemy Dao. The two people benefited a lot.

Places that Ye Yuan went, everyone naturally welcomed them heartily.

After all, regardless of whether the rumors were true or not, it was irrefutable that he defeated Yun Windborne.

Just this point, his strength was already not what ordinary alchemy powerhouses could compare to.

This level of powerhouse would not come to the city to interact at all.

But Ye Yuan could lower his status and mingle with them. He even gave pointers concerning their doubts on Alchemy Dao from time to time. He was naturally immensely welcomed by all parties.

Furthermore, the alchemy strength that Ye Yuan exhibited also made everyone wholeheartedly convinced.

Prior to this, Ye Yuan was extremely overbearing in the way he dealt with affairs, leaving everyone with an extremely cold image.

During these few days, everyone felt that not only was Ye Yuan not overbearing, but he was also very amiable and approachable instead.

For some time, the three of them master and apprentices were very warmly received in the city.

Toward this sort of situation, Ye Yuan was still very relieved.

Regardless of what the Medicine Ancestor’s ultimate goal was, the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time had indeed promoted the great development of Alchemy Dao.

For this scale of alchemy conference, only the Medicine Ancestor had such rallying power.

Several months later, the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference finally started.

On this day, the streets and alleys were empty. Everyone had gathered in the plaza in the center of Cloudheart City.

The alchemy powerhouses who obtained the qualifications to participate were no less than 100 thousand people!

Among these people, the vast majority came due to the prestige.

Everyone understood in their hearts that the final winner of this conference could only be the various major holy lands.

However, the participants of the various major holy lands were mostly third-generation disciples.

Second-generation disciples’ strengths were too strong. Those like Yun Windborne were already powerhouses at the level of Mt. Tai, it would naturally not be suitable to take part in this kind of conference.

Ye Yuan was sitting at the thousand-foot high platform, looking down loftily.

A middle-aged man dressed in sky-blue long robes slowly walked out and arrived above the high platform.

The moment he appeared, there was immediately a commotion in the crowd.

Even those ancestors also opened their eyes one after another, looking at the arrival full of dread.

The middle-aged man in blue robes opened his mouth and said coolly, “Thank you all for honoring with your visit, arriving at Cloudheart Realm to take part in the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time. This emperor is Distantbook, the second disciple under Master’s command.”

Rumble!

The crowd exploded all at once!

“Heavenspan World Distantbook, the alchemy world’s peerlessly rare talent, and also the Heavenspan World’s legendary figure!”

“Heard that he only used 30 thousand years and cultivated to Ancestor Realm! Later, he was taken in as a disciple by Medicine Ancestor, cultivating to grand completion Ancestor Realm in 100 thousand years. Ten million years later, he finally broke through the fetters, reaching the realm of Dao pill!”

“Later, he challenged more than ten ancestors and didn’t have a single defeat! Last time, he challenged Sacred Ancestor High Priest, and he was defeated.”

“Among all the ancestor-level powerhouses now, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook is the youngest!”

... ...

Ye Yuan did not hear of Heavenly Emperor Distantbook before, but looking from the reactions of others, this person was clearly extremely formidable.

He was not in the pugilistic world, but the pugilistic world had his legends.

Ye Yuan was currently sizing Heavenly Emperor Distantbook up, but then he discovered that Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s gaze was currently looking at him.

An astonishing fighting spirit poured into Ye Yuan’s body, practically shredding his entire person apart.

Ye Yuan was startled in his heart, the power of the chaos world quietly revolving, forcing this fighting intent out of his body.

He stared right at Heavenly Emperor Distantbook, the fighting intent in his body similarly rising to the sky.

Everyone stared at this scene wide-eyed and tongue-tied, not understanding what happened.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s reaction, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook was clearly quite surprised.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan could actually block his fighting spirit!

A hint of a smile flashed across the corners of his mouth and he continued faintly, “There is not much to say. The rewards of the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time are extremely generous. It’s a handwritten book personally written by Master. The champion of the Dao Realm group and Ancestor Realm group will each get a copy of it!”

The moment these words came out, the crowd burst into an uproar once more.
