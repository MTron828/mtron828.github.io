Chapter 2174: 100 Pieces of Dragon Origin Crystals

The light screen slowly dissipated. A youth in white walked over leisurely.

On the platform, everyone looked at the youth in white, with their eyes full of terror.

Yes, terror!

These Heavenly Emperors were all frightened by Ye Yuan’s talent.

The Sons of the Heavenly Dragon who had exchanged blows with Ye Yuan before actually took a step back without prior agreement.

This guy was not human at all!

He was a monster!

But Long Xiaochun had a look of delight, coming up to greet.

“Ye Yuan, this young lady knew that you’re the most formidable. Indeed, you didn’t disappoint me!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly. Bringing Long Xiaochun and landing on the platform, his eyes suddenly turned sharp. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He stared at Morningstar intently and said in a solemn voice, “Senior doing so, shouldn’t you give me an explanation?”

Swallowing insults and humiliation silently was not Ye Yuan’s personality. Since he did so, he would have to pay the price!

The Heavenly Emperors were shocked when they heard that. This guy was really arrogant, to actually dare question Lord Morningstar.

Did he think that taking the first place of the Battle of Dragon Sons, he could challenge a Heavenly Dragon?

“Insolence! Who do you take yourself to be me? To dare speak to Lord Morningstar like this?” Long Tianyu just had a stomach full of anger that had nowhere to be released. So he immediately jumped out.

Ye Yuan completely ignored him and stared right at Morningstar’s two eyes.

Morningstar sighed slightly and said, “You’re both my Dragon Clan’s pillars of society. Any one of you that dies is my Dragon Clan’s tremendous loss!”

Ye Yuan suddenly burst out laughing when he heard that. His gaze turned to Long Yuan, and he said with a smile that was not a smile, “Pillars of society? Huhu, what a fine pillar of society!”

Those words were full of mockery.

Long Yuan had a look of shame and anger, wishing to find a hold in his ground to tunnel into.

The other Sons of the Heavenly Dragon also lowered their heads one after another. If even Long Yuan did not count as a pillar of society, what did they count as?

But these words coming out of Ye Yuan’s mouth, no one could refute it at all!

He used strength, used talent, and proved that Long Yuan was merely trash!

“Ye Yuan, you’re insolent! If Long Yuan isn’t a pillar of society, then are you? You’re merely ...” Long Tianyu could not endure this awkward atmosphere and spoke out, berating.

“Shut up!” Morningstar suddenly yelled angrily, interrupting Long Tianyu’s words.

But Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Continue saying that I have half human-race bloodline. In your eyes, I’m a different species. Isn’t that so? Hence, when Long Yuan used Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning, you didn’t make a move to save me. But when I wanted to kill him, you made a move and saved him! In your eyes, no matter how strong I am, I’m also not the Dragon Clan’s own people, isn’t that so?!”

Morningstar’s old face turned slightly red. Being exposed by Ye Yuan so blatantly, it was so embarrassing!

Although Ye Yuan obtained the Dragon Clan major power’s Heavenly Dragon Mark, he still had some reservations in the end.

It was just that he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually saw things as clearly as viewing a blazing fire, guessing his thoughts penetratingly.

This kid was not simple!

Morningstar heaved a sigh and said coolly, “This matter was indeed this emperor breaking the rules. However, Long Yuan is indeed a genius hard to come by in a million years. Killing him is a pity! Speak, this emperor can promise you a condition!”

The heavenly emperors had stunned faces, Lord Morningstar actually yielded toward a junior.

No matter how great your talent was, before growing up, you were also merely a junior.

On what basis?

How could they know that Morningstar was wary of that major power behind Ye Yuan!

These people did not know, but Morningstar was very clear.

This major power was not a major power on Heavenly Dragon Mountain, but ... a major power sealed in the abyss!

That place’s existences, each one of them was a major character that shocked heaven and earth.

He could not afford to provoke!

Even Heavenly Dragon Mountain could not afford to provoke either!

“I want a hundred pieces of dragon origin crystals!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

His objective was not to find trouble. Facing the leviathan, Heavenly Dragon Mountain, his rage was not worth mentioning at all.

This world always revered strength as supreme.

If he possessed the strength to destroy Heavenly Dragon Mountain right now, would he still be here expressing his fury?

No!

He would trample the entire Heavenly Dragon Mountain underfoot like trampling on Long Yuan.

Morningstar’s eyes narrowed, and he said, “What do you want so many dragon origin crystals for? With your current strength, the dragon origin crystal that you refine in the Mist Battlefield is already the limit.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “That doesn’t need you to care anymore. I naturally have my own use!”

Morningstar shook his head and said, “No way! Dragon origin crystals are the Dragon Clan’s supreme treasure, only heavenly dragons and Sons of the Heavenly Dragon can use. Even the various stronghold’s dragon lords don’t have the qualifications to use them either!”

Ye Yuan suddenly saw the light. Morningstar was afraid of him bringing dragon origin crystals out, or giving them to others to use.

One had to know, this dragon origin crystal was much more formidable than whatever true dragon blood.

Even humans could also skyrocket in strength after refining.

But he was also somewhat surprised, not expecting that dragon origin crystals were actually so valuable.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Since that’s the case, I’ll refine it here. There’s no problem like this, right?”

Morningstar was taken aback and said, “You? Here?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Aren’t you worried that I’d leak dragon origin crystals out? Since that’s the case, then I’ll refine it in front of you. There’s no problem like this, right?”

Morningstar was speechless and said, “There’s naturally no issue, but ...”

Ye Yuan directly cut off his words and said coolly, “No buts, if I can’t refine a hundred pieces, this matter will be considered dropped like this.”

Already said things to this kind of extent, what could Morningstar still say?

At once, Morningstar nodded his head and said, “Okay, but ... act within your capability.”

But Long Tianyu had a cold sneer on his face and said, “A hundred pieces? Stuff yourself to death!”

The others also involuntarily shook their heads. Clearly, they felt that Ye Yuan was looking down on everyone and everything too much.

“Each awakening, one can at most only refine 20 pieces of dragon origin crystals. Any more and they won’t be able to withstand it at all. Even if he’s of the perfect seventh transformation, he also can’t withstand a hundred pieces of dragon origin crystals!”

“There was once a dragon who forcefully integrated dragon origin crystals. In the end, at the 25th piece, he was forcefully blown up! This kid is courting death!”

“Heh heh, so arrogant, I want to see how many dragon origin crystals he can integrate!”

... ...

To Morningstar, dragon origin crystals were naturally not an issue.

Only to see him flick his sleeves grandly, 100 pieces of dragon origin crystals suspended in midair quietly.

Ye Yuan did not say a word, reached a hand out to pluck off a dragon origin crystal, and directly started refining.

An indescribable pain started pulsing within his body.

However, after the origin dragon energy entered the body, Ye Yuan’s heavenly dragon mark actually did not have the slightest reaction.

The reason why he wanted dragon origin crystals was that Ye Yuan also saw the power of Heavenly Dragon Marks.

After one awakening, the bloodline rose ten times!

This kind of strength amplification, how could Ye Yuan not be moved?

Dragon origin crystals were a specialty product of Heavenly Dragon Mountain. It was now or never! Opportunity seldom knocked twice.

Hence, he wanted to try whether or not he could stimulate his bloodline power and reach the first awakening.

The reason why he said 100 pieces was because he was unsure how many he needed.

Previously in the Mist Battlefield, he already integrated 15 pieces of dragon origin crystals. But the effects did not seem to be very apparent.

The moment origin dragon energy entered the body, it seemed like a stone sinking into the ocean.
