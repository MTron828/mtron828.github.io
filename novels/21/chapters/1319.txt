Chapter 1323: Spectroscope Broke

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Luo Jian smiled bitterly and said, “It’s no use! Unless you can disguise the divine soul, otherwise, even if your face-altering skill is any more powerful, it can’t hide from the spectroscope too!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You just watch!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan swaggered over towards the Wang Family’s checkpoint just like this.

“Halt!” When a house-guard saw Ye Yuan come over, he immediately stopped him.

Ye Yuan had a panic-stricken expression as he said, “You ... What do you all want to do? I ... I don’t have divine essence stones on me!”

The house-guard glared and said, “Who wants your divine essence stones? Go over, put your hand on that instrument!”

“Ah? O-Oh, that’s easy! That is easy!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, immediately running over and placing his palm on it.

Amidst the rubble, Luo Jian stared at this scene unblinkingly, his heart leaping to his throat.

To Luo Jian, he had never encountered an incident that made him palpitate with anxiety and fear like this before.

Suddenly, his gaze turned intent, and he revealed a look of incredulity!

The spectroscope ... actually gave off a green light!

“This ... How is this possible?”

Luo Jian muttered to himself, being dumbstruck with astonishment by this scene.

He had never seen before that the spectroscope would fail!

No, wait! Not failed, but made a blunder in judgment!

The spectroscope emitting a green light indicated that the divine soul imprint on the item did not match, while a blue color represented the person himself.

Now, the spectroscope became green color, meaning that it made an error in judgment!

No wonder Ye Yuan was so confident. It turned out that he really had the ability to pass through the spectroscope’s detection.

When Ye Yuan pressed toward the spectroscope, Wang Yutao and Wang Yugan, both involuntarily looked at him.

However, they did not become suspicious. Ye Yuan’s performance was not much different from ordinary bottom-level martial artists.

Martial artists who came to the Yin Wind Den were mostly living at the lowest rung. Otherwise, who would be willing to take part in this kind of life-risking transaction?

Ye Yuan’s appearance of viewing divine essence stones like his life directly dispelled their suspicions.

When seeing the spectroscope become green color, they no longer had the mood to pay attention to Ye Yuan.

“Heh, a bunch of ignorant fools, to actually use such junk in front of this old man! Truly overestimating its ability!”

Inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, came Dustless’s disdainful cold snort.

As if using this spectroscope to inspect Ye Yuan’s divine soul was a very insulting thing to him.

Those in the same profession were foes; these words were not false at all.

Who was he, Dustless?

That was the ancestor of playing with divine souls!

A mere profound divine artifact was really inadequate to look at when placed before him.

In front of an empyrean spirit treasure, this spectroscope was also not much different from a child’s toy.

“Haha, these guys also don’t know that I still have a great divinity like you on me!”

Ye Yuan secretly showered Dustless with flattery.

Dustless snorted coldly and said, “Such a junk, if this old man wants it to become green, it will become green; make it become blue, it will have to become blue; make it become yellow, it will still have to become yellow!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes suddenly lit up, and he said, “Then can Senior make it become blue in a while?”

Dustless said, “What’s difficult about this? I You’re thinking of ... luring them in?”

Ye Yuan said, “That’s right! If didn’t make the Wang Family suffer a bit of a loss, they would really think that this young master is easy to knead!”

Dustless was also very moved by this suggestion and said, “That’s easy! I’ll do the tampering!”

In the real world, Ye Yuan lightly lifted his hand away and asked the house-guard with a startled appearance: “This ... It’s fine already, right?”

The house-guard had an impatient look and waved his hand and said, “Get lost then!”

Ye Yuan smiled fawningly and ran like flying.

Seeing Ye Yuan pass through the checkpoint smoothly, Luo Jian finally let out a sigh in relief.

But regarding Ye Yuan entering the Yin Wind Den alone, he was still rather worried.

He did not wait at the arranged place according to Ye Yuan’s instructions but waited to see in the rubble pile.

Not long after Ye Yuan entered the Yin Wind Den, there was another batch of martial artists who wanted to enter the Yin Wind Den.

As usual, they were naturally stopped by the Wang Family.

But when the first martial artist put his hand on it, a strange thing happened.

“Blue! It’s him!”

That house-guard shouted loudly and was about to take action.

That martial artist had a blank look, completely unaware of what was happening.

“This elder brother, are you all mistaken? Us seven brothers are known as the ‘Yin Wind Seven Heroes,’ mucking around in the Yin Wind Den all year round. How can I possibly be the person that you’re finding?”

That martial artist had also seen before a great spectacle. He did not attack but opened his mouth to explain unhurriedly.

“Yeah, this lord, us seven brothers are also considered to have some minor fame in Jewelhill City. Quite a few people recognize us, are you all mistaken?” said another person among the seven people.

“Heh, how can what the spectroscope detect possibly be wrong? Surrender obediently without resistance!” the house-guard said.

The Wang Family’s people already surrounded the Yin Wind Seven Heroes at this time. As long as they dared to move, they would immediately make a move to destroy them.

Seeing the spectroscope become blue, Wang Yutao and Wang Yugan were also greatly roused in spirits.

But hearing that martial artist’s explanation, he could not help becoming somewhat suspicious.

The name Yin Wind Seven Heroes, Wang Yutao had really heard before.

These seven people’s strength, they were not weak. They were fooling around at the Yin Wind Den all year round, and even sold natural treasures to the Wang Family before.

The Yin Wind Seven Heroes’ boss, Chang Liang, said carefully, “This lord, let’s not attack first. Perhaps ... there’s really something wrong with the spectroscope?”

The house-guard was just about to speak when Wang Yutao divided the crowd and came in.

He looked at Chang Liang and said with tightly knitted brows, “You’re the Yin Wind Seven Heroes’ boss, Chang Liang?”

The moment Chang Liang heard, he was overjoyed and hurriedly said, “Precisely so! This lord, us seven brothers examined our hearts that we have not offended Your Excellency before, I wonder this ...”

Wang Yutao’s brows furrowed even tighter, and he said, “You put your hand on it again and try!”

Chang Liang knew that this one in front of him was formidable and did not dare to disobey, putting his hand on it as per his words.

Green color!

Chang Liang’s expression loosened up, and he said with clasped hands, “Your Excellency, indeed a mistake, right?”

Wang Yutao ignored him and said to the other six people, “You all put your hands on it!”

The few people exchanged glances. Chang Liang glared and said in a low voice, “Still in a daze for what? Didn’t hear what this lord said?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The six people were startled and quickly put their hands on the spectroscope one by one.

Yellow color!

Purple color!

Azure color!

Blue color!

Red color!

Each one that put on it, Wang Yutao’s complexion became a shade blacker.

Chang Liang’s cold sweat was pouring by the side, fearing of angering this lord.

Clearly, this one had already reached the brink of eruption. He only hoped not to innocently get involved in a disaster due to others.

The last one put his hand on it. Wang Yutao’s expression became even more unbelievably fascinating.

Various colors of light flickered incessantly and actually emitted a multi-colored light!

Puchi!

Suddenly, a cloud of azure smoke emanated from the spectroscope.

Destroyed!

The surroundings were dead silent, no one dared to speak.

The last member of the Yin Wind Seven Heroes was frightened until he trembled all over, completely did not understand what happened.
