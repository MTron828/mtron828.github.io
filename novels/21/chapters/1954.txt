Chapter 1958: Ouch, My Eyes!

“Master, is what he said true or not?” Jian Chen bellowed.

In a blink of an eye, Jian Hongxiao’s noble image in his heart collapsed, making him unable to accept it.

Looking at those countless spittles, he was even ashamed to be associated with Jian Hongxiao.

Jian Hongxiao gazed at the blue sky, seemingly recalling the past, appearing melancholic.

Finally, he nodded slowly and said with a sigh, “What he said was right. Master ... is the Stellar Hall’s sinner!”

Jian Chen looked at Jian Hongxiao rather disbelievingly. It was as if it was his first time knowing him.

“Why? Why have you never told me before?!” Jian Chen roared.

Jian Yun laughed by the side and said, “If he were to tell you, would you still be willing to acknowledge him as your master? This kind of person, huhu, isn’t fit to have disciples at all! Also, you, kid, being associated with this kind of person, your lifespan will reduce!”

In the second half of the sentence, he said it to Ye Yuan.

When Ye Yuan heard that, he also had a look of disgust on his face and moved a few steps toward Jian Yun’s side, as if very disgusted with Jian Hongxiao.

“What this brother said is right. I was also deceived by him. That’s why I would follow him to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital. Actually, I just wanted to find someone to take a look at my fate, but he’s not suitable to do it now,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

When Jian Hongxiao heard this, a hint of a rueful smile appeared on his face.

At present, even Ye Yuan had left him.

He also did not expect that the moment he entered the city, he would have his unsavory history exposed by people.

Under such circumstances, he could not explain it away even with a hundred mouths.

Of course, he did not want to explain anything either.

Jian Yun laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “He’s a bereaved dog, how could he still have this skill? Want to look at your destiny, you naturally have to find the Stellar Hall!”

Ye Yuan said embarrassedly when he heard that, “Sigh, little brother, I, am only from a small place, how could I have the connections to know the Stellar Hall’s masters?”

“Heh, you have eyes but fail to see, right? My family’s young master is precisely a disciple of the Stellar Hall, augury and astronomy, he’s skilled in all.”

“Our young master is the Stellar Hall’s rising star. He is an existence who might become a Stellar Hall’s elder in the future!”

By the side, someone immediately started lauding to the skies.

Even Jian Hongxiao also revealed a look of surprise as he said, “You actually entered the Stellar Hall?”

Jian Yun had a pleased look and said with a spurious smile, “Are you very disappointed? Back then, you kept prating on about how I’ll achieve nothing and was a piece of garbage. Now? This young master, I, have already become a Stellar Hall’s disciple, but you became a dog who lost its home!”

Jian Yun’s face was triumphantly jaunty, full of the delight of having slapped faces.

In reality, he understood what was the deal with him being a Stellar Hall disciple. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Without a powerful father, it was impossible for him to enter the Stellar Hall.

This play today was also arranged by his father, making him block here and humiliate Jian Hongxiao.

His father, Jian Hao, was presently a Stellar Hall elder with an awe-inspiring reputation.

When performing divination a few days ago, he happened to divine that Jian Hongxiao would be returning within the next few days. So he arranged for his son to wait here.

Many years ago, Jian Hongxiao prophesied more than once, saying that Jian Yun would never amount to much.

Coming to slap Jian Hongxiao’s face, he was naturally delighted to the extreme.

Ye Yuan said in surprise when he heard that, “So that’s how it is! Then this little brother really had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai!”

As he said, Ye Yuan even gave a bow toward Jian Yun.

Jian Hongxiao’s brows furrowed slightly, not knowing what medicine Ye Yuan was selling in his gourd.

He still thought that Ye Yuan was intentionally finding an excuse to draw a clean line with him just now. He could understand this. But Ye Yuan’s style right now was very unlike him!

Jian Yun had a smug look as he said with a smile, “Huhu, forget it, you following this old fellow, it’s also normal that you’re inexperienced and ignorant. This young master, I, am in a good mood today and will take a look at your destiny.”

Ye Yuan was delighted when he heard that and said with clasped hands, “Then thank you very much, Young Master Jian Yun!”

Jian Yun also had the intention of showing off. Circulating his cultivation method, he cast the aura viewing art on Ye Yuan.

“Ouch, my eyes! My eyes can’t see anything anymore! My eyes are blind!”

Suddenly, he felt a stabbing pain in his eyes like it was being burned. He was already unable to open his eyes anymore.

Jian Yun fell to the ground in agony and started rolling on the ground non-stop.

The surrounding onlookers turned pale with fright. How could they still care about Jian Hongxiao, all of them were looking toward Jian Yun in curiosity one by one.

Jian Hongxiao looked at Ye Yuan dumbfounded with his mouth agape, not expecting that he actually played this act.

And this Jian Yun actually really foolishly cast the aura viewing art on Ye Yuan.

Wasn’t this looking for abuse?

Forget about him right now, even if he was at his prime, he also would not dare to cast the aura viewing art on Ye Yuan!

“Senior, let’s go!” Ye Yuan smiled at Jian Hongxiao and said.

Jian Hongxiao had a moved look, he knew that Ye Yuan was deliberately causing a disturbance, diverting those people’s attention, letting them successfully get away.

Jian Hongxiao opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but he was interrupted by Ye Yuan. He said, “This place isn’t the place to speak, talk again later.”

The two people moved, but Jian Chen was still standing on the spot in a daze.

Jian Hongxiao heaved a sigh and turned around and left.

Smack!

Jian Chen’s shoulder was patted by Ye Yuan, making him jump.

“Sometimes, what the eyes see might not be real. But at times, what the eyes see is the most authentic. Therefore, don’t use eyes to see, use the heart to feel. Think about it, how Senior treated you these few years!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan slowly left.

Jian Chen’s entire body trembled, his gaze revealing a complicated look. Finally, he still gritted his teeth and followed after.

...

Before the bed, an old man was currently diagnosing Jian Yun’s pulse. His brows were tightly locked.

“Master Bu Chen, I beg you, you must save me! I can’t become a blind person!” Jian Yun wailed.

“Shut up! Don’t disturb Master’s pulse-reading!” Jian Hao said in a solemn voice.

Jian Yun indeed did not dare to wail anymore, shutting his mouth sensibly.

After a long time, Bu Chen slowly got up and shook his head slightly.

Jian Hao was startled inwardly, hurriedly going up to ask, “Brother Bu Chen, how is it?”

Bu Chen shook his head and said, “I’m afraid this pair of eyes are crippled!”

Jian Hao’s heart thumped and he said, “How ... can this be? Yun-er only used the aura viewing art a little and his eyes are crippled?”

Bu Chen said, “This is Heavenly Dao backlash. Furthermore, it’s extremely strong. With this old man’s strength, I’m powerless to turn the tables.”

Jian Hao said in shock, “How can it be? You’re the person with the strongest alchemy strength in the city, if even you’re helpless, then ... then ... oh, right, since it’s Heavenly Dao backlash, can the Bright Moon Purple Cloud Pill save him?”

Bu Chen shook his head and said, “With this old man’s judgment, I’m afraid that the Bright Moon Purple Cloud Pill is powerless to turn the tables too. Unless ... one can refine the Six Veins Stellar Pill!”

Jian Hao took several steps back in the row when he heard that, saying absent-mindedly, “This ... How is this possible? Just taking one look and the Heavenly Dao backlash would be so severe?”

Jian Hao regretted it until his intestines turned green now. He only wanted to let his son go and humiliate Jian Hongxiao, making him beat a retreat in the face of difficulties.

Who would have thought that he actually harmed his own son to become a blind person!

This level of Heavenly Dao backlash was akin to bone-festering maggots. Even if a new pair of eyes were swapped in, it was to no avail too. This problem was the hardest to deal with.

Members of the Jian Family feared this level of Heavenly Dao backlash the most.

It was just that Jian Hao could not understand even after cudgeling his brain. Why would it cause such severe consequences with just having one glance?
