Chapter 2915: Deepening the Impression!

Seeing that Ye Yuan actually knew the soul envoy, Wang Jun and the rest could not help but rejoice.

Yan Jadetrue’s one sentence directly woke them up. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It turned out that these two were enemies!

With this, it was really over!

Ye Yuan did not feel anything. He just smiled and said, “It looks like you’ve already forgotten the lesson from last time!”

Yan Jadetrue laughed loudly and said, “Forgotten??Huhu,?how can I possibly forget? Do you think that this envoy is still that trash who doesn’t know anything? Back then, the reason why this envoy was plotted against by you, it was merely because I was an origin divinity body at that time! Now, this envoy had a great lucky chance and already completely transformed into a soul denizen, grasping the soul race’s powerful mystic arts! It’s the soul race that let this envoy experience a nirvanic rebirth! Killing you now is merely a matter of a single thought!”

“Ye Yuan, you don’t know this, but for so many years, this envoy has been constantly thinking about returning to the Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven to avenge the enmity back then! I really didn’t expect that heaven has eyes, to actually deliver you before this envoy!?Hahaha?…”

Talking until the back, Yan Jadetrue could not resist letting out a loud laugh.

He was seriously too happy!

Back then, Yang Jadetrue being defeated at Ye Yuan’s hands, it could be said to having all hope being dashed to pieces.

But only until he obtained the soul race’s inheritance did he learn why he was defeated!

Was an origin divinity body a soul denizen?

Yes, and also no!

In essence, the two were homologous.

But the human race’s origin divinity had a huge connection to the physical body and the inner-world.

It was different for the soul race!

Furthermore, the human race rarely had soul race mystic arts. Even if there were techniques to cultivate the origin divinity, it was far from the soul race’s too.

Therefore, the human race’s origin divinity was actually 108 thousand miles worse than same rank soul denizens.

Across the heavens and myriad worlds, it was not only the human race. After other races had their fleshy bodies be destroyed, there would be a soul body existing too.

But a soul body was different from the soul race.

The cultivation of the soul race was another Great Dao!

The origin of soul!

Both that and the blood race’s origin of blood were extremely strong Great Daos.

Soul race powerhouses could eliminate hundreds of millions of living things with a single thought!

Origin divinity body must obtain the soul race’s cultivation method, shed off the shackles of the origin divinity, and tread onto the Great Dao of Soul, before they could be called a soul denizen.

Otherwise, they were too weak to stand up to competition!

Very clearly, Ye Yuan grasped some kind of extremely powerful soul race mystic art back then. That was how he could defeat the strong while being weaker, beating the piss out of him.

But now, it was already different!

He, Yan Jadetrue, obtained the soul race’s inheritance and already completely transformed into a soul denizen. His strength could no longer be mentioned in the same breath a long time ago!

The moment Zhang Zuoshan heard, he was overjoyed.

He knew that this one in front of him was currently a rising new star in the Nirvana Soul Hall.

His rate of improvement was very quick!

He was already just half a step away from Emperor Realm!

Therefore, he did his best to suck up to Yan Jadetrue. That was how he had today.

“Heh heh,?I was wondering what powerful figure it was, to be able to make Lord Soul Envoy keep thinking about him! It turns out that it’s merely a random nobody! Kid, there’s a phrase: Change is the only constant, the wheel of fortune turns. Have you heard it before? The present Lord Soul Envoy can crush you as easily as crushing an ant to death!” Zhang Zuoshan said smugly.

Yan Jadetrue said with a smile, “That’s correct!”

How soothing to the heart!

Change is the only constant, the wheel of fortune turns!

Wasn’t he and Ye Yuan be like so?

Heaven really had eyes, delivering Ye Yuan in front of him!

The expressions of Wang Jun and the rest changed drastically. They similarly knew that this one before their eyes was the Nirvana Soul Hall’s expert!

Same rank humans were not his match at all.

They knew that Ye Yuan was formidable, but fighting with the soul race was different!

One thought, life and death would be decided!

“Ancestor Ye, we’ll stop them, hurry up and go!” Wang Jun’s figure moved, blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

Lu Yan and the rest gave no chance to explain, standing shoulder to shoulder with Wang Jun.

Previously, the entire sect even wanted to perish together with Yan Jadetrue, and they suppressed it.

Now, for Ye Yuan’s sake, they did not even want the sect anymore!

The loyalty of Wang Jun these people could be seen.

Zhang Zuoshan snorted coldly and said, “A bunch of ant-like things, to actually dare be disrespectful to the soul envoy!?Huhu,?I think that you all are really tired of living!”

But Ye Yuan, who was away from Wang Jun and the rest, said with a faint smile, “Looks like you have great resentment! Then I’ll give you a chance, come and kill me!”

This slightly smiling appearance, Yan Jadetrue was very displeased!

His two eyes narrowed, instinctively feeling that Ye Yuan harbored malicious intentions.

This kid was too cunning!

He was already infinitely cautious back then. Who knew that he still succumbed to his trick?!

He understood Ye Yuan too well!

But, the more he understood, the more fearful he was of Ye Yuan.

“Zhang Zuoshan, go and kill him!” Hesitating for a moment, Yan Jadetrue still said cautiously.

Zhang Zuoshan was stunned.?Is Lord Soul Envoy scared of this kid?

How was this possible?!

In the Nirvana Soul Hall, Lord Soul Envoy killed gods if gods blocked him, killed Buddha if Buddha blocked him.

Under Emperor Realm, he was virtually unrivaled.

Now, he was actually afraid of a newly advanced middle True Sovereign Heaven?

Could this kid be so impressive?

However, he did not dare to refuse to carry out Yan Jadetrue’s orders!

“Yes, Lord Soul Envoy!”

The moment Zhang Zuoshan’s middle Emperor Cloud Heaven aura released, everyone’s faces changed.

“You dare to hurt my Ancestor Ye! This sect master will fight it out with you!”

Wang Jun four people immediately faced off against Zhang Zuoshan without hesitation.

Four versus one!

Luckily, Wang Jun’s strength was already very close to middle Emperor Cloud Heaven.

The four people barely managed to resist Zhang Zuoshan.

A big blunder!

Yan Jadetrue thought that the Sublime Pill Sect only had Wang Jun, one Emperor Realm. That was why he brought Zhang Zuoshan alone.

Who knew that four Emperor Realms appeared all of a sudden!

Ye Yuan did not care. He still smiled at Yan Jadetrue and said, “Why? Don’t dare? If you’re not making a move, then I’m … going to make a move!”

Yan Jadetrue’s pupils constricted. A powerful long-distance attack directly entered Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness!

One thought, life and death was decided!

But when his soul force entered Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, it suddenly seemed like it collided into an iron plate!

“Ugh!”

Yan Jadetrue gave a muffled groan, falling back several steps in a row!

So strong!

Ye Yuan did not play any tricks!

How could his origin divinity be so powerful?

The origin divinity attack just now, Ye Yuan did not even deliberately defend against it. He only felt that Ye Yuan’s origin divinity was strong like an iron plate!

And his origin divinity attack was slammed until it was badly battered.

He looked towards Ye Yuan in horror and said, “H-How can this be? How can your origin divinity … be so strong?”

Back then, Ye Yuan’s origin divinity barely managed to reach Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Just how long had it been? His origin divinity already reached upper True Sovereign Heaven?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s origin divinity was more than a hundred times more solid than ordinary upper True Sovereign Heavens!

Just what kind of origin divinity cultivation method did this guy cultivate?

Demoralizing!

Too demoralizing!

He obtained an Emperor Vast Heaven’s inheritance!

After cultivating bitterly for so long, he did not even have a match in the Nirvana Soul Hall. Now, he actually lost to a human?

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “Looks like the lesson last time wasn’t deep enough. Then this time, I’ll deepen the impression!”

Finished saying, two origin divinities emerged from Ye Yuan’s body.

Finally, they merged into one!

Yan Jadetrue felt horror in his heart, crying out in surprise: “Twin Chaos Origin Divinities!”
