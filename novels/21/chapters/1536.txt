Chapter 1540 Chaos Heavenly Star Art!

“Hiss ... Eight million divine essence stones, this ... this is a robbery!”

“Crazy, crazy! A medicinal pill eight million divine essence stones. This kid is crazily thinking about money!”

“Heh, demanding an exorbitant price got to have the ability to take it as well!”

...

Ye Yuan’s quoted price directly made everyone burst into an uproar.

Eight million for one medicinal pill, this was not even counting the spirit medicines’ cost.

This was simply a sky-high price! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, there was also barely any medicinal pill that could sell at the price of eight million.

This kid absolutely went crazy thinking about money!

The corners of Ning Siyu’s mouth twitched and she said, “If you can really refine it, so what if eight million? But I have a request, you must refine the pill in front of everybody!”

She did not believe that Ye Yuan could really refine a divine-grade divine pill.

Something that even Master could not refine, how could Ye Yuan possibly refine it?

Moreover, this Gale Celestial Stone Pill’s difficulty was God knows how many times harder than the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill!

Even for her master, the chances of refining were very small too!

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Deal. All come in then.”

Ning Siyu followed Ye Yuan inside angrily. The others exchanged glances and also entered in a single line.

The Miracle Hand Parlor was not big. Ye Yuan’s pill refining room was also not that luxurious. With so many people entering it, it seemed a little packed.

These people all extended their heads, wanting to see how Ye Yuan refined pills.

Just now, this young man took out a rank three divine-grade divine pill!

When Ning Siyu saw this simple and crude pill refining room, she could not help pursing her mouth.

This rundown place, could it really give birth to some legendary existence?

What Ye Yuan used was a celestial deity artifact medicinal cauldron. The Profound Yellow Cauldron naturally could not be taken out in front of everyone.

Either way, the celestial deity artifacts inside the Purple Extreme Hall were a lot. There were still other medicinal cauldrons.

Gale Celestial Stone Pill, Dustless mentioned it to him before but did not have the pill formula. This would be Ye Yuan’s first time refining one.

After doing the prep work, he started meditating, deducing the pill formula in his head.

The spirit medicines that Ning Siyu prepared were only sufficient to refine twice. It was still a little difficult for him to want to refine it within two tries.

Of course, this was so to other people.

Ning Siyu looked at Ye Yuan and had a contemptuous look. This guy was definitely posturing!

This room was full of people. Did meditation not require a quiet environment?

Do you have to be so amateur?

If you can deduce the pill formula under this kind of environment, that would really be seeing ghosts!

Ning Siyu pursed her mouth and said disdainfully, “Putting on an act! I want to see how long you can maintain it!”

She already determined now that Ye Yuan was totally a layman!

As for that medicinal pill earlier ... it might have been stolen from somewhere!

Roughly two hours later, Ye Yuan slowly got up and arrived before the medicinal cauldron.

Everyone held their breaths, quietly waiting for Ye Yuan to refine pills.

Ye Yuan’s palm shook, shattering medicine and condensing the embryo!

The excess spirit medicines, Ye Yuan lightly flicked, directly sending into another container.

Very soon, the two medicinal embryos were condensed finish.

The entire process was natural and smooth; finished in one go.

A hint of surprise flashed across in Ning Siyu’s eyes. Ye Yuan’s method had indeed astonished her.

Except, was this medicinal embryo really reliable?

That casual flick could expel the excess spirit medicines?

At least, her master could not achieve such precise control.

Shattering medicine and condensing the embryo was not considered some incredible skill to Alchemy Gods.

But Ye Yuan’s shattering medicine and condensing the embryo was vastly different from ordinary Alchemy Gods.

A feeling of ... consciousness flowed.

Refining pills using consciousness flow?

Hur hur!

Pill refinement was an extremely rigorous study. Could consciousness flow refine the medicinal pill[1]?

“Tsk, who doesn’t know how to act cool!” Ning Siyu said scornfully.

However, Ye Yuan already entered pill refinement state. Ning Siyu’s ridicule, he did not hear a single word.

Ye Yuan held his palm out. A pale white flame appeared in his palm.

“Snicker ... A rank two divine fire? Want to refine the Gale Celestial Stone Pill? This guy is joking around, right?”

Seeing the Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame in Ye Yuan’s palm, Ning Siyu immediately laughed.

Rank two divine fires, regardless of whether in terms of temperature or sustainability, it did not reach the requirement of refining rank three divine pills at all.

The Gale Celestial Stone Pill, this level of medicinal pill, the requirement of the flame itself was exceedingly high.

For rank two divine fires to want to refine the Gale Celestial Stone Pill, it was simply a fool’s talk.

Under Ye Yuan’s painstaking nurturing, the Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame had long broken through rank one divine fire as well, reaching rank two.

It was just that the Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame’s advancement speed clearly could not catch up to Ye Yuan’s speed of breaking through.

His palm urged, the Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame entered inside the medicinal cauldron.

Puu, puu, puu ...

The Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame emitted light exploding sounds.

The temperature of the medicinal cauldron suddenly soared!

Flame Explosion Art!

A surge of scorching temperature hit from head-on, making everyone’s faces suddenly change.

“This ... Is this a rank two divine fire? Why would it have such a horrifying temperature?”

“This temperature has probably already reached the level of rank three divine fire, right?”

“A rank two divine fire giving off a rank three divine fire’s temperature? This ... Is this a joke?”

...

Waves of exclamations emitted from the crowd. Ning Siyu also had shock written all over her face.

Even though it just barely reached the temperature of rank three divine fires, it had indeed reached it.

How did this guy do it?

Ye Yuan only developed this Flame Explosion Art in order to compensate for the inadequacies of his divine fire.

Ye Yuan could let each fire seedling undergo a small-scale explosion with terrifying control, letting the divine fire’s overall temperature rise a level from there.

This was Ye Yuan’s action that could not be helped. But in everyone’s view, it was an inconceivable thing.

Ning Siyu’s eyes glimmered, discovering a trace of inkling very soon, and could not help having a look of surprise.

The little fire seedlings that this kind of art of flame explosion required to control was a very horrifying number.

This guy’s control over flames had simply reached the acme of perfection!

It was just that ... if using this method, would he still have energy to go and control the pill refinement?

Controlling flames and controlling the pill refinement, these were two things and needed to be done separately.

Without a doubt, this method of controlling fire needed to expend tremendous energy. Then what would Ye Yuan use to refine pills?

A hint of a gloating smile flashed across the corners of Ning Siyu’s mouth. What was the use of being good at fire control? Forming the pill was the crux!

But very soon, her smile turned stiff on her face.

Inside the entire room, a mysterious aura started filling the air.

This aura was like wine fragrance, making people intoxicated and unable to extricate themselves.

“Chaos Heavenly Star Art!”

Ye Yuan shouted lightly, his entire person seemingly turning into a region of chaos, giving people the feeling of beholding a great mountain.

Ning Siyu’s eyes became somewhat misty, as if she was drunk.

Her entire person was immersed in the sea of Dao, unable to extricate herself.

As for the rest, they were even more like so.

Inside this pill refinement room, the aura of Great Dao pervaded the air!

Chaos Heavenly Star Art was the alchemy technique that Ye Yuan developed. It was also the extension of his Alchemy Dao when he was a mortal realm.

If his alchemy skill was a tender seedling in the past, then his current alchemy skill was a great tree currently growing tall and strong!
