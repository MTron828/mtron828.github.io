Chapter 2057: What’s Hard to Say?

Ye Yuan looked at Yun Yi, his eyes revealing a trace of appreciation.

Someone who was not a “fool’ or ‘crazy’ could not see through his intent at all.

Those so-called geniuses were shortsighted and only saw the benefits in front of them. Their achievements in alchemy would definitely be limited.

They proudly said they were smart, but in reality, they were unbelievably dumb.

Only ‘fools’ and ‘lunatics’ in those people’s eyes had a heart that genuinely yearned for the Dao.

Did those people think that talent could resolve everything? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

This was the dumbest notion!

Without endless hard work, without great willpower, great resolve, why would the door of Great Dao open to you?

“I only have hard work and foundation, these two words, when I teach disciples. You need to bear it in mind,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Yun Yi two people became solemn and hurriedly said, “Yes, Master. Disciple will bear it in mind.”

How could Ye Yuan not tell what the two people were thinking in their hearts? He said, “What shortcuts are there to take on the path of the Dao? If you ask Master how to achieve the Dao, Master can only tell you that the Dao is under your feet! Being down-to-earth is the Dao! You guys saw Siyu radiated with splendor during the Cloudpill Summit, but you don’t know how much hardships and effort she put in at the back. Therefore, if you want to learn whatever pinnacle Alchemy Dao from me, you can leave right now. I have nothing to teach you.”

The two people’s faces changed, repeatedly saying that they dare not.

But the shock in their hearts could not use words to describe at all.

They were unable to imagine Senior Apprentice Sister Siyu’s efforts. Then how much was sunk in behind Master’s glory?

“Master, Disciple understands! From today onward, Disciple will lay down all pride and follow by Master’s side.”

Yun Yi was not trying to calm Ye Yuan down. Those words made him have a feeling of being enlightened all at once.

And these ten years of bitter cultivation also made him more able to understand the meaning behind Master’s words.

Since that was the case, start over from the bottom then.

“It’s just ... Master, you and Empyrean Flutterfeather withdrawing from the Southern Border Alliance this time, is it really fine?” Yun Yi said worriedly.

He was not taking Ye Yuan’s side, but Yun Yi was very conflicted currently.

After all, one was his great-grandfather, and the other was his master.

Whichever getting hurt was not what he wished to see.

Ning Siyu smiled when she heard that and said, “You guys are also looking down on Master too much! You’ll understand his means very soon!”

...

Three months passed in a twinkle!

On this day early morning, a group of shopkeepers gathered at Cloudpill Establishment once more.

Ding Xiao said in high and vigorous spirits, “Gentlemen, we didn’t fail to live up to expectations. These three months, we fought an extremely beautiful war! At present, we’ve already controlled more than 70% of this Longwind Great Imperial Capital’s market! Reaching this step presently, no matter how capable Chou Tianyu is, he’s also powerless to turn the tables!”

“Hahaha! I can finally report on the fulfillment of the mission! Maybe we don’t need ten years and the Myriad Treasure Tower will be thoroughly defeated by us,” Shopkeeper Lin said with a big laugh.

Another shopkeeper said with a laugh, “Heh heh, that is inevitable. No matter how strong the Myriad Treasure Tower is, no matter how strong Empyrean Flutterfeather is, no matter how strong Ye Yuan is, it’s also impossible to be the entire Southern Border Alliance’s match! The resources in our hands, apart from those reclusive forces, we occupy more than 50% of the Southern Border. If we lose like this, then we can find a piece of tofu to kill ourselves!”

Ding Xiao nodded his head and said, “According to the news that I grasp, the most elite alchemists of the entire Southern Border have already been gathered at the back, refining medicinal pills without ceasing. These medicinal pills will be provided to us in an endless stream. We’ll be able to extend out to the various imperial capitals with Longwind Great Imperial Capital as our foundation very soon.”

When the group of shopkeepers heard, they could not help being greatly roused.

Controlling 70% of the market, it was also no wonder that these shopkeepers were all fired up with boundless enthusiasm.

The major and minor factions present were likely no fewer than 40 to 50 in total.

This virtually represented the entire Southern Border’s pinnacle factions. Defeat, this sort of term, would not appear in their dictionaries at all.

Even if Ye Yuan had some trump cards in his hands, in their view, it was merely eking out a meager existence and delaying the time of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s defeat by a little.

“Oh, right! Didn’t Chou Tianyu say that they were going to raise prices? Haha, I want to see who will still go to the Myriad Treasure Tower to buy medicinal pills after raising prices!” Shopkeeper Lin suddenly thought of something and said with a big laugh.

“Things are bad! Things are bad!”

Shopkeeper Lin’s voice had yet to fade when a manservant directly rushed into the hall and said in a great panic.

Ding Xiao snorted coldly and berated, “What is it? Making such a big fuss over nothing, where’s the sense of propriety?”

How could the manservant still care about being punished? Pointing at the opposite, he said, “Shopkeeper Ding, things are bad! The Myriad Treasure Tower opposite is already almost packed until it’s bursting! Those martial artists have all gone crazy, desperately fighting to purchase their medicinal pills. The martial artists that were originally here at our side have all ran over to their side now.”

“What did you say?”

Ding Xiao’s eyes went wide, somewhat doubting if his ears heard wrongly or not.

Why would those martial artists run to the Myriad Treasure Tower opposite?

The other shopkeeper’s faces were full of a disbelieving expression.

Their notion at this time was unusually unanimous, that was that this manservant was lying!

“The Myriad Treasure Tower raised prices on all medicinal pills today. So why would martial artists go and fight to buy their medicinal pills at their place? What nonsense are you talking about?” Ding Xiao said in a cold voice.

Although he knew that this manservant did not dare to lie to him, he was still unable to believe it.

That manservant had a bitter face as he said, “Shopkeeper Ding, even if you lend this lowly one a gall, this lowly one also wouldn’t dare to talk rubbish!”

Ding Xiao frowned and said, “Go! Let’s hurry up and go take a look!”

As he said this, he took the lead and went down the building.

When he just arrived in the audience hall, Ding Xiao was stopped by a few people. He hurriedly switched to a smiling face and went up to greet.

These few were all their Cloudpill Establishment’s major clients and could not be offended.

“Haha, Family Head Su, Family Head Ren, what wind blew you guys here?” Ding Xiao cupped his fists and said smilingly.

These two people were precisely two of Longwind Great Imperial Capital’s five major families, the family heads of the Su Family and Ren Family.

These few months, Ding Xiao expended a Herculean effort and unleashed all of his abilities before prying them over from the Myriad Treasure Tower’s hands.

Presently, these two major families’ medicinal pills were all provided by their Cloudpill Establishment.

Family Head Su smiled and said, “This Su coming today together with Younger Brother Ren is because there’s something that we want to request Shopkeeper Ding to help us with.”

Ding Xiao hurriedly smiled and said, “Easily arranged! You two are this Ding’s financiers, I’ll naturally offer my services! Is it that the medicinal pills aren’t enough to use recently? No problem, I’ll have servants send a batch of medicinal pills over right away.”

Family Head Su waved his hand and said, “No need, no need! The Su Family’s medicinal pills for cultivation is enough!”

Ding Xiao said in surprise, “Then ... what did Family Head Su come to find this Ding for?”

Family Head Su took a look at Family Head Ren with some difficulty. Family Head Ren clearly had a hot temper and said impatiently, “What’s hard to say? Shopkeeper Ding, this Ren and Family Head Su coming this time, it’s to terminate our two families’ contracts with the Cloudpill Establishment. In the future, concerning the medicinal pills that our two families use for cultivation, we won’t need to trouble the Cloudpill Establishment anymore!”
