Chapter 1993: What is That Anyway?

Ye Yuan walked up the steps, the pressure on his body becoming greater and greater.

Emperor bone, even if it was an emperor bone that had been through countless years of baptism, it still had his pride.

Ye Yuan’s pair of white eyes did not carry the slightest emotion as he said coldly, “Past glory had long already vanished like mist and smoke. You still want to make a show of power after death? The past is already over, so let it be!”

On Ye Yuan’s body, Dao marks twined around. This pressure was not worth mentioning to him at all.

Before long, Ye Yuan arrived at the summit of the bone mountain.

Before his eyes was a complete Qilin emperor bone.

Ye Yuan was rippleless like an ancient well and reached his hand out to grab. Right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

“Immobilize!”

A voice sounded out from the void. Powerful power of laws entangled over toward Ye Yuan frenziedly, completely binding the space around him.

“Hahaha! Ye Yuan, it’s been hard on you along the way. This emperor bone, I’ll accept it!”

Liu Yi’s figure emerged, looking at Ye Yuan with a smug face.

Everyone was struck dumb with stupefaction by this sudden turn of events. No one could have thought that there was actually still someone hiding in the void.

This was truly the mantis stalking the cicada, being unaware of the oriole behind.

Except, how on earth did he do it?

“It’s Liu Yi that damn fellow! He ... He’s actually already the Fifth Firmament True God Realm.” Guo Jingyang stared at that figure, shocked and enraged.

Just these short few months of not seeing him, Liu Yi actually already broke through to become a Fifth Firmament True God. It was simply outrageous.

Song Yu’s eyes spewed fire as he said, “This guy must have swallowed all of the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits! Damn thing! I didn’t expect that this guy still had such means of concealment. I really underestimated him!”

It was also too late for them to rush over now. For Liu Yi, the emperor bone was within easy reach.

Moreover, that area of space was already constrained, they could not break through at all.

“Damn it, really damn it! Could it be that we’re going to helplessly watch this guy snatch away the emperor bone just like that?” Hu Fei said with an unwilling face.

“Heh heh, so what if he received three swords? In the end, isn’t the emperor bone still snatched away by others?” Zhou Yu had a cold smile on his face.

Seeing Ye Yuan being intercepted, Zhou Yu was delighted in his heart.

“Ye Yuan, didn’t expect it, right? Apart from the Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman, this old man even has High Clarity Void Escape Talismans. You guarded against this old man in every manner along the way. In the end, weren’t you still schemed against by this old man? Heh heh, obtaining this emperor bone, this old man will definitely be able to reach the emperor surmounting aura. The realm of Heavenly Emperor will no longer be delusions of grandeur for this old man!”

Liu Yi looked at Ye Yuan, being incredibly pleased with himself.

He had never thought that he would actually have the chance to break through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor one day.

At the thought of this, he was extremely excited.

Finished talking, he reached his hand out and grabbed at that Qilin emperor bone.

But right at this time, a ray of light bloomed from the emperor bone. Liu Yi’s figure was directly blasted flying out like a cannon shell.

His expression changed, and he muttered, “How ... How can this be?”

However, a scene that made him even more shocked appeared.

The Ye Yuan who was originally restrained actually slowly opened up his footsteps, walked in front of the emperor bone, and slowly picked up the emperor bone.

Liu Yi seemed to have seen a ghost, exclaiming in shock, “This ... How is this possible? My Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman, no one should be able to resolve it within True God Realm!”

Ye Yuan looked at Liu Yi with a cold face and said coolly, “Foolish thing, the emperor bone has spirituality. Since he let the Empyrean bone devil test us and I passed the test, it naturally acknowledged me as his master. As for your Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman, what is that anyway?”

Ye Yuan who was under the white-pupil state had the Divine Vestige Space all around him, being untainted by myriad laws.

How could a mere Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman really immobilize Ye Yuan?

Not just Liu Yi, Song Yu and the rest were also shocked to the extreme.

They had all been immobilized by this Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman before. That feeling of powerlessness virtually made them despair.

But Ye Yuan was actually not affected at all?

Liu Yi still had one last Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman left. He had long planned it out, just waiting for this final moment to pillage destiny.

Who could have thought that Ye Yuan was actually not affected at all?

From start to end, he was just a clown jumping around!

“Last time, you snatched the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit. You were lucky that you ran fast. This time, just nice. We can settle the accounts.” Ye Yuan looked at Liu Yi, not having the slightest emotion.

A hint of viciousness suddenly flashed across in Liu Yi’s gaze, and he said with a cold smile, “Settle the accounts? With just the likes of you, a Second Firmament True God? I know that you’re very impressive, but I’m a Fifth Firmament True God right now! What do you have to settle the scores with me?”

Suddenly, a ghost claw appeared in Liu Yi’s hand. It was shockingly an empyrean spirit treasure.

Ye Yuan seemed to have not seen it, slowly walking over toward Liu Yi.

This Ye Yuan made Liu Yi feel extremely uneasy. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

That icy-cold feeling made him feel like he was virtually going to be frozen stiff.

He gritted his teeth and snapped. “Extreme Nether Deathsoul Claw!”

A horrifying aura of death instantly erupted.

A cloud of black gas suddenly rumbled over toward Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan still did not have the slightest movement.

Blue fine threads extended out, colliding together with that cloud of black gas very quickly.

That cloud of black gas seemed to have seen a ghost, immediately vanishing into thin air.

Liu Yi’s eyes became wide-saucers, looking at this scene in disbelief.

What the hell were these blue fine threads?

Without the slightest hesitation, Liu Yi turned tail and ran.

Except, it was already too late.

The divine marks’ speed of extending was even faster than he imagined.

In a blink of an eye, he was engulfed inside the Divine Vestige Space.

“Welcome to my world!”

Liu Yi’s pupils constricted, his face looking bewildered and lost as he said, “Your ... Your world?”

Liu Yi was not foreign to small worlds.

But Ye Yuan’s world, he had never seen before.

How could there be such a small world?

He attempted to use his ability and deploy his world power.

But he discovered to his astonishment that his world power was actually unable to release outside of his body in this place!

“This ... This ... What the hell kind of place is this?” Liu Yi became more and more alarmed and terrified in his heart.

In this place, he was just like a mortal.

No, wait, even less than a mortal.

Ye Yuan said, “You don’t need to know. You just have to know that your so-called destiny is ... nothing in front of me! Now, you can go and die already.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s finger pointed toward him. Liu Yi directly exploded into nothingness.

When his figure appeared again, Liu Yi already evaporated into thin air.

When the others saw this scene, each and every one of them was shocked speechless.

Song Yu and the rest were wildly elated, sprinting over in a few steps.

“Brother Ye, where’s Liu Yi?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Dead.”

Song Yu laughed loudly and said, “Haha, I knew it! This wretched grandson wouldn’t have a good outcome! Brother Ye, really nice means, to actually be able to even easily resolve the Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman.”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coldly, “Paltry tricks, nothing to be feared.”

Being given this glance by Ye Yuan, Song Yu had a feeling of plunging into an ice cellar.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with Song Yu. His figure moved, speeding straight into the distance.
