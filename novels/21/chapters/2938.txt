Chapter 2937: Imperishable!

This time, Feng Rui was truly enraged.

In his eyes, the outside world’s so-called geniuses were all trash.

But now, he could not even take care of a piece of trash!

Sizzle!

Five bolts of electricity coiled around Feng Rui’s body, shaking people to the core.

Eastsun’s eyes shrunk, and he cried out in surprise, “This … Could this be the legendary Innate Five Lightning Soul Physique?”

Cloudneon said coolly, “Precisely so!”

Eastsun drew a cold breath and said, “Innate five lightnings! Chaos Divine Lightning, Allheaven Divine Lightning, Purple Firmament Divine Lightning, Three Pure Ones Divine Lightning, and Lightning Law Framework! Any one of them is a lightning that destroys the world! And this Dao of Lightning is extremely harmful to our soul race; hence, extremely few people awaken it. I didn’t expect that Young Hegemon Feng Rui actually awakened the Innate Five Lightning Soul Physique! Ye Yuan, hurry up and stop. Otherwise, it will be hard to guarantee your life!”

The outside world did not know much about the Imperishable Soul Domain, but the various major hall masters were familiar with the data on soul physiques, so as to let them excavate geniuses.

Therefore, Eastsun knew about this Innate Five Lightning Soul Physique as if enumerating his family’s valuables.

It was precisely because so that he also knew the terror of this soul physique.

It was already certain without a doubt that Ye Yuan was not of the Imperishable Soul Physique, wouldn’t continue to fight be courting death?

“Heh heh,?didn’t he ask me to come and test his soul physique? Now, he hasn’t even used his soul physique. How do I test it?” Feng Rui looked at Ye Yuan, laughing coldly.

At this time, he was no longer hiding his killing intent.

Seeing that Feng Rui’s soul physique had such power, Ye Yuan was also slightly fearful in his heart.

Even without fighting, he could also feel that Feng Rui’s soul physique was extremely powerful.

Qin Shitian’s so-called sub-origin soul martial was probably not even enough to carry shoes for Feng Rui.

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Imperishable Soul Domain’s Emperor Realm genius even has to display his soul physique form when testing a True Sovereign Heaven’s soul physique.?Huhu,?it sounds so formidable you bragged about how the Imperishable Soul Domain is, but it’s nothing more than this! Showcase your ability; otherwise, I’m scared that you won’t be able to test it at all!”

Feng Rui’s gaze turned chilly, and he said in a cold voice, “Relax. You’ll die very pleasantly in a while!”

Swoosh!

In a blink, Feng Rui’s figure disappeared, his speed being swift to the extreme!

Lightning rule specialized in speed to begin with, and the soul body displaying movement techniques even broke away from the fetters of the fleshy body.

Even when compared to Ye Yuan’s spatial rule, it was also not far off.

Ye Yuan only saw a blurry shadow instantly moving in front of him.

Although Feng Rui was just lower Emperor Cloud Heaven, the gap from Sovereign Realm to Emperor Cloud Heaven was not an ordinary kind of big after all!

“Divine Firmament Thunder God Blade!”

Only to see a thunder blade fall down, Ye Yuan’s soul body seemed to have been hit by a paralyzing hex.

Boom!

Ye Yuan’s soul body directly dissipated, turning into a mass of mist.

Feng Rui gave a cold laugh, his soul physique instantly disappearing.

The radius of a thousand feet completely transformed into a sea of lightning, enveloping the mist fully!

“Allheaven Lightning Sea, Myriad Soul Extermination!”

In the lightning sea came Feng Rui’s furious roar.

That cloud of mist rapidly withered away in this sea of lightning!

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help drawing a cold breath.

Really too strong!

Especially this lightning sea, it was simply the jinx of the misty air! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s over! With this, Ye Yuan is really finished!”

“Already said, to let him not flaunt his superiority!”

“Sigh,?it’s really just as Feng Rui said. That bit of pitiful pride is nothing at all!”

… …

Looking as Ye Yuan was about to turn to ashes, many people sighed heavily.

They understood Ye Yuan’s view. In reality, they wanted to struggle too.

But what use did struggling have?

Imperishable Soul Domain’s genius was a genius in the end!

“Hahaha,?foolish guy! This is the outcome of provoking the Imperishable Soul Domain! Dying without a burial ground!” In the lightning sea came Feng Rui’s loud laughter.

This guy whose mouth owed a beating was finally dead!

Cloudneon’s gaze flickered slightly, finally returning to tranquility.

She saw through that Ye Yuan’s soul physique was absolutely not just yellow rank. But there was nothing to feel regret over either.

This kind of Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique, the Imperishable Soul Domain had plenty.

It did not matter that one died.

The reason why she was sent here was also to express the importance that the Imperishable Soul Domain placed on the Imperishable Soul Physique.

What if it was really the Imperishable Soul Physique?

But, looking at it now, it was indeed still a Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique!

Soon, Feng Rui put away the lightning sea and reappeared.

He looked towards Eastsun and said with a disdainful look, “Now, don’t need me to say, you can also tell that it’s a Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique, right? Next time, don’t kick up such a big fuss! These countless years, how many amazingly talented people have there been? But which one became Ancestor Imperishable? How can the outside world possibly have it if there isn’t any in the Imperishable Soul Domain?”

Eastsun had a depressed look. Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall finally managed to produce two peerless geniuses.

In the end, Qin Shitian was killed by Ye Yuan, and Ye Yuan was killed by Feng Rui.

In the end, he ended up with nothing.

“Who did you say is Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique?”

“I said …”

Seeing someone questioning him, Feng Rui answered without thinking.

But, when the words reached the tip of his tongue, he suddenly noticed that something was not right.

Turning around, he discovered that Ye Yuan was currently standing there perfectly fine. It was as if nothing had happened.

Feng Rui had an expression like he saw a ghost. He had clearly completely destroyed that misty air earlier. Why was this guy completely fine?

A hint of surprise finally flashed across Cloudneon’s beautiful eyes.

Earlier, she clearly could not detect any aura anymore. But Ye Yuan actually still came back to life!

This Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique was a little interesting!

“You … How can you possibly still be alive?” Feng Rui had an expression like he saw a ghost as he said.

“Why can’t I be alive? Already said that it’s the Imperishable Soul Physique, why would I die?” Ye Yuan said with a light smile.

In reality, he also thought that he was dead for sure just now.

That Divine Firmament Thunder God Blade carried a powerful paralyzing effect.

Feng Rui’s Five Lightning Soul Physique was no ordinary lightning. It carried origin attributes!

This soul physique that he awakened was similar to the true spirit clan’s innate divine ability in the first place, with immense power.

Under this paralysis, Ye Yuan could not even fight back, directly turning into mist.

And the power of the Allheaven Divine Lightning sea was even more terrifying.

There was no gap in the lightning sea at all.

His misty air was refined bit by bit inside the lightning sea.

But the miraculous thing was that he did not die. He retained a final trace of spiritual intelligence without being extinguished!

This kind of feeling was rather magical. Ye Yuan felt as if he had returned to his mother’s womb and could peek at the entire world.

When the lightning sea dispersed, an inexplicable power poured into the spiritual intelligence.

Hence, he returned!

The entire process was hard to describe.

But, without a doubt, he indeed did not die!

This Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was indeed magical!

In reality, apart from Hegemon Imperishable, nobody could figure out what the hell the Imperishable Soul Physique was.

Ye Yuan had just awakened it. He naturally could not figure it out either.

But now, he seemed to have had some discovery.

This Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was well-deserving of being called the Imperishable Soul Physique. If one did not figure out the situation, even if it was an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse, they might not be able to kill him too!

But at this time, the shock that it brought to Feng Rui was clearly incomparably intense!
