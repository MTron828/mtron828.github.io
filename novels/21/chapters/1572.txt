Chapter 1576 Does It Dare to Answer If You Call It?

“Remember, I understand heaven better than you!”

Heavenly Sin’s voice reverberated between heaven and earth. That figure appeared incomparably tall in everyone’s eyes.

The current Heavenly Sin Heretic God was so all-powerful. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Heavenly Sin’s aura climbed wildly. Dark clouds gathered overhead in the sky, while lightning was accompanied by peals of thunder, making people have the jitters.

At this moment, it was as if the end of the world had come, and heaven and earth collapsed.

The entire Immortal Grove World started shuddering.

Because of Heavenly Sin Heretic God!

“This ... This is too strong, right?”

“Turns out that that finger just now was not his full strength at all.”

“This ... How to fight him? I feel like he’s the god of creation!”

...

Everyone’s faces revealed a look of horror. They were frightened by Heavenly Sin’s powerful strength.

Perhaps Heavenly Sin’s strength was just a small fry when placed in the Heavenspan World.

But in this Immortal Grove World, he was invincible!

“Big Brother Yuan!” Yue Mengli shouted. When she saw this scene, she was too frightened until her complexion turned pale.

This powerful pressure was truly too scary.

She was not afraid for herself. She was worried about Ye Yuan.

Even though Ye Yuan’s improvement was very terrifying, she still did not know whether or not Ye Yuan could do it to this extent similarly as a controller.

Ye Yuan turned around to look at Li-er and gave her a reassuring look.

Li-er and Ye Yuan had their hearts and minds connected, and she instantly set her mind at ease.

The rest also looked at Ye Yuan with worried expressions. If Ye Yuan could not stop Heavenly Sin Heretic God, then the Immortal Grove Region would fall into a bottomless abyss!

“Hahaha, kid, you’re also a Heavenly Dao controller, why don’t you summon the might of Heavenly Dao? Or is it that you already gave up? If you’re not making a move, then I’m coming! You relax, I won’t kill you. Li-er and I still haven’t performed the formal wedding ceremony!”

Finished talking, Heavenly Sin looked down from a height, and suddenly smacked a palm down.

Rumble ...

An enormous black palm protruded out from the void, making the entire Immortal Grove World quake.

Fang Tian, Skydistant, these Deity Realm powerhouses, lost control of their bodies all of a sudden, dropping down from the sky one after another.

The entire Immortal Grove World’s Heavenly Dao became chaotic, they were completely unable to fly in the air.

Even Ning Siyu and the rest who came from the Heavenspan World were unable to fly in the air too.

Above the void, there was only Ye Yuan and Heavenly Sin left.

“Heretic God Palm! Brat, do you dare to receive this palm or not? If you don’t receive it, everyone below will have to be buried in death with you! Hahaha ... Is it very despairing for you?” Heavenly Sin laughed wantonly.

Wild winds raged, the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves fluttered wildly.

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the firmament from a distance, and just quietly watched it just like this, watching Heavenly Sin perform alone.

The enormous palm reached out from the void and pressed down towards the top of Ye Yuan’s head.

However, Ye Yuan did not seem to have the intention of resisting at all.

Everyone below was dumbfounded with shock, screaming one by one.

“What’s Ye Yuan doing? Could it be that he’s not fighting back?”

“Ye Yuan, quickly make a move! It’s too late!”

“Ye Yuan, you’re our last hope, you mustn’t give up!”

...

Looking as the giant palm was about to land on top of Ye Yuan’s head, Ye Yuan still did not have the intention of making a move.

Heavenly Sin was dumbfounded and thought to himself, could this punk be an idiot? To actually not even fight back?

However, right at this time, something that made everyone stare wide-eyed and their mouths agape happened.

All of a sudden, the entire sky started trembling.

That black giant palm seemingly saw something terrifying and actually shrunk right back!

Retracting back into the void!

The original thick peals of thunder and dense dark clouds vanished without a trace in a blink of an eye.

Clear skies illuminated the world once more.

When the sunlight shone on everyone’s face once more, they all felt as if they had experienced a baptism from doomsday to rebirth.

Everyone was dumbfounded!

Heavenly Sin was also dumbfounded!

What just happened?

Seemed like Ye Yuan did not do anything.

What happened?

At this time, Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Sin, slowly opened his mouth, and said, “What did you say earlier, I didn’t hear clearly. Can I trouble you to say it one more time?”

A hint of panic finally flashed across in Heavenly Sin’s eyes.

Impossible, it definitely was not done by this kid!

A blunder!

Right, it must have been a mistake!

Dealing the Heretic God Palm once more would definitely be able to smack this brat to death!

Thinking up to here, Heavenly Sin’s confidence mustered up once more and he said with a cold snort, “I said, I understand heaven better than you! Why? Are you unconvinced?”

Done talking, Heavenly Sin released his aura, wanting to summon the might of Heavenly Dao once again.

“Heretic God Palm!”

However, there was no movement in the sky at all.

Heavenly Dao seemed to not be able to hear his call at all and did not even have any reaction.

Whatever thick peals of thunder, whatever Heavenly Dao chaotic, nothing at all!

Heavenly Sin’s pupils constricted and he looked at this scene in disbelief as he said, “Impossible! This ... how is this possible? I ... I clearly already obtained the recognition of Heavenly Dao and became the controller of Heavenly Dao!”

“Heretic God Palm!”

Heavenly Sin’s face turned red from exertion, but Heavenly Dao still did not give him any response at all.

Below, everyone exchanged glances, all with baffled looks, completely not knowing what happened.

Heaven and earth changed colors just now, but why did it become blue sky and gentle breeze in a twinkle?

“Who knows what’s going on? Did Ye Yuan do this?”

“No way, right? Even though he’s also a controller, it’s impossible to do it to this extent, right?”

“He clearly didn’t do anything just now. He just stood there and did not even move a finger.”

...

Yue Mengli’s beautiful eyes stared fixedly at Ye Yuan. She was incomparably certain in her heart and this was done by Ye Yuan.

Even though she could not understand at all.

She knew that Ye Yuan was still that undefeatable Ye Yuan.

Even if the Immortal Grove World produced a Heavenly Sin Heretic God, it was still impossible to be Ye Yuan’s match!

“Hahaha, Big Brother is really too awesome! Didn’t even move a finger and he made this guy croak! Hahaha, too satisfying!” White Light suddenly laughed loudly and said.

He was the same as Li-er, knowing that this was definitely Ye Yuan’s work!

At this time, Ye Yuan’s eyelids raised slightly and he looked at Heavenly Sin as he said coolly, “Just now, you said that you understand heaven better than me?”

Heavenly Sin choked and said, “I ... I ...”

A hint of mockery flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, and he said with a cold sneer, “Do you know how big the heaven outside is? Do you know how strong the people outside are? Do you know how weak you are? You are merely a frog at the bottom of a well!”

You are merely a frog at the bottom of a well!

This one sentence shocked everyone’s heart.

Even an existence like Heavenly Sin was just a frog at the bottom of a well?

Heavenly Sin’s expression became incomparably ugly and he roared at Ye Yuan, “Impossible! You’re merely a controller too! Furthermore, my realm is higher than yours, and my comprehensions are deeper than yours! I, Heavenly Sin Heretic God, am this Immortal Grove World’s number one controller!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said coolly, “Oh? Is that so? If you’re the controller, does it dare to answer if you call it?”

Heavenly Sin’s face was like a chameleon, instantly changing several colors.

He gritted his teeth and said, “I don’t believe that I can’t control Heavenly Dao! Heretic God Palm! Heretic God Palm! Heretic God Palm!”

Heavenly Sin seemed like a madman shouting non-stop. However, Heavenly Dao still did not react at all.
