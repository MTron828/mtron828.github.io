1721 I Admit Defea

Xiahou Yun’s expression changed. A strong sense of crisis welled up in his heart.

But the arrow was notched on the bow and already had no choice but to release!

“DIE!”

World power turned into an invisible fist force, striking until space distorted.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan moved as well.

“Misty Sword Art ... Spirit Concealing Sword!”

This sword move was Ye Yuan’s strongest move after he comprehended Third Firmament spatial law and merged Sword Dao laws.

It was only to see his figure move turning into an afterimage and pouncing straight for Xiahou Yun!

Swish!

No earth-shattering collision sound. People only heard a subtle noise.

The battle came to an abrupt end!

Quicker than words could tell.

Actually, it was just that blink of an eye. The two people separated upon contact.

Ye Yuan put away the sword and stood there, the Junyi Sword revealed itself once more.

“This ... Who won?”

“Don’t know, too fast! I didn’t see clearly!”

“What a strange fight!”

...

Everyone looked at the two motionless people on the ring. All of them were struck senseless.

The judge had a shocked look and did not come back to his senses for a long while.

The sword earlier was too stunning!

Those geniuses were all very weak. Not perceiving it was very normal.

But he, an Eighth Firmament Divine Lord powerhouse, naturally saw clearly at a glance!

The beauty of Ye Yuan’s sword was fleeting.

Passing quickly in an instant, but gorgeous and eternal.

One sword emerging, directly breached Xiahou Yun’s fist force, and kiledl Xiahou Yun!”

The judge said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan wins, Xiahou Yun is defeated and dead!”

“What? Dead?” On the grandstands, a series of exclamations immediately came over.

Right then, Xiahou Yun’s body suddenly split into two from the center, toppling onto the ground stiffly.

Xiahou Yun was actually cleaved into two. But because Ye Yuan’s sword was too fast, he maintained a standing posture all along. Others simply could not discover it.

Everyone looked at this scene in shock. Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, the Xiahou Yun who comprehended the law of wind and destruction law was actually killed by Ye Yuan with one sword!

Those people who were still mocking Ye Yuan for overestimating his ability previously all opened their mouths wide right now.

Only now did they understand that he was not posturing. He was actually really amazing!

A Third Firmament Divine Lord actually killed the Sixth Firmament Divine Lord Xiahou Yun with one sword. This achievement was too dazzling.

Not far away, two figures coincidentally bumped into each other.

“Eh? You came too? Looks like you pay a lot of attention to Xiahou Yun!” Jiang Nan looked at Mo Fei who walked over from the fourth arena as he said with a lazy look.

Mo Fei was the other Sixth Firmament Divine Lord genius.

Mo Fei gave Jiang Nan a glance and said, “Aren’t you the same too?”

Jiang Nan smiled and said, “Heh heh, you’re a little weak. The Hundred Battles Arena this time, the one who can arouse my interest is also just Xiahou Yun.”

Mo Fei’s expression turned cold. Jiang Nan laughed and waved his hand as he said, “Haha, if you have the strength, use it in the ring. It’s boring to hit me right now. Since we ran into each other, go and take a look together.”

Mo Fei shot Jiang Nan a glare, snorted coldly, and walked over towards the sixth arena.

“Eh? Already ended? Looks like Xiahou Yun indeed did not encounter any decent opponent ... mn?”

Jiang Nan’s words were said halfway when his expression suddenly changed, that lazy manner was swept clean.

Because he saw the corpse that was currently being dragged away by people on the ring.

Mo Fei similarly trembled all over and said in disbelief, “D-Dead? The Hundred Battles Arena this time, there’s actually someone who can kill Xiahou Yun?”

“Heh heh, looks like a remarkable fellow appeared this time!” Jiang Nan said.

Mo Fei looked towards Jiang Nan and said doubtfully, “Could it be that a powerful Fifth Firmament Divine Lord appeared this time? But I didn’t hear about it!”

At this time, Jiang Nan returned to that lazy manner and said with a smile, “We will know who it is tomorrow.”

...

On the second day, all seats were occupied at the martial arts field.

Compared to the group stage previously, today’s final battle was the highlight.

Not just because those selected were experts among experts, but also because this session determined who would get the Profound Secrets Pavilion Lord’s guidance.

The eight winners lined up on the first arena. But the other six people’s gazes looked over towards that young man in the sixth position.

There was still one person left who had an expression like it was logical and natural. That person was naturally Ning Tianping.

Ning Tianping finally surmounted numerous difficulties and still obtained a spot in the end.

At that moment, he was filled with lofty sentiments!

It was not long before that he was also a genius; however, he was merely a bottom-most tier genius even though still part of the imperial city’s level.

But now, he could already stand out among the geniuses of several hundred imperial cities and become a winner.

As for Ye Yuan obtaining a seat, that was something that went without saying.

So what if the opponent is a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord? It was not enough to look at in front of His Excellency at all.

But in other people’s view, it was totally not the case.

Especially Jiang Nan and Mo Fei, when they saw Ye Yuan, they were shocked until their jaws almost fell off.

A Third Firmament Divine Lord!

The one who killed Xiahou Yun was actually a Third Firmament Divine Lord!

Yesterday, they had thought of countless possibilities but never could have they thought that it was a Third Firmament Divine Lord.

If Xiahou Yun was defeated, they would not be so shocked either.

But Xiahou Yun was dead!

Experts exchanging blows, defeating and killing were two completely different concepts.

Especially on the ring, the difficulty of killing the other party was even greater.

Because the other party could concede.

Want to kill the other party, unless the other party did not have time to admit defeat at all, just like Xiahou Yun versus Gao Shun previously.

A Third Firmament Divine Lord could actually make Xiahou Yun not even have the time to admit defeat, this was simply too inconceivable.

Gone were Jiang Nan’s old laziness. Shock was written all over his face.

Experts like them, there were only that one or two opponents in their eyes. How could they pay attention to others?

Even though Ye Yuan caused quite a considerable stir in the sixth group, before battling with Xiahou Yun, no one was optimistic about it at all.

Therefore, Jiang Nan did not know Ye Yuan at all.

At this time, the Profound Secrets Pavilion’s head elder said a bunch, then said to these eight people, “Three days later, the eight of you come to the Profound Secrets Pavilion. There will naturally be the grand elder to give you all guidance. Now, the eight of you each face-off, and decide the final winner! At that time, Profound Secrets Pavilion will personally view your aura and perform divination for you.”

The other five people were very happy at this time. But Jiang Nan and Mo Fei could not become happy no matter what.

They came here aiming for the Profound Secrets Pavilion Lord.

But now ... it seemed a little tricky!

The two people looked at Ye Yuan without prior agreement, revealing solemn looks.

Speaking of which was coincidental too, the final eight, Ye Yuan’s opponent was actually Ning Tianping.

The two people had yet to go up the ring and Ning Tianping directly forfeited.

Got to be joking, fighting with His Excellency, wasn’t it looking for abuse?

He was abused like hell even at Second Firmament Divine Lord. Now that he was Third Firmament Divine Lord, it was sufficient to one-shot Fifth Firmament Divine Lords. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At home, no matter how he was abused, it was fine.

Outside, he still wanted face.

The final four was born. But the opponent that Ye Yuan ran into this time was Jiang Nan.

On the grandstands, the audience was incomparably excited, because they could see another great battle.

Jiang Nan became that lazy noble young master again. He stared at Ye Yuan, sizing him up for a while, and suddenly opened his mouth and said, “I admit defeat.”
