Chapter 2421: Consider the Future!

Ye Yuan slowly opened his eyes. There were actually nine ghostly fires rotating indeterminately in his pupils.

It was his first time feeling the power of rules at such close range.

At this moment, he finally understood why Dao Ancestors dominated above the world!

This kind of power was not what the mortal realm should have at all.

Even if your power of laws was comprehended to perfection, it was also not as good as one-ten-thousandth of rules.

“This is the power of rules? Although I’ve long known it, this saint still feels that it’s inconceivable that you all could rely on the inheritance grand arrays to comprehend the power of rules!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

When he saw Saint Profound Jian Rufeng, he knew that the countless powerhouses later on were created by him.

But at that time, he was just a late-stage World Realm martial artist after all.

The inheritance grand arrays that he left behind were able to groom 18 rule powerhouses. Even he himself also felt proud.

Lin Wushuang gave a bow respectfully and said, “The legacies that Lord Saint Azure left are legacies through the ages! Giving a man a fish is not as good as teaching him how to fish. We feel this sentence most profoundly! The 18 legacies are the perfect ways to cultivate the supreme Great Dao! Unfortunately, Lin Wushuang has a low aptitude and wasn’t able to comprehend the true heaven-defying grand array and wasn’t able to salvage the declining trend. The rule formation base that I comprehended is likely hard to enter Your Excellency’s arcane sights. I won’t impart it to Your Excellency either, but I’ll leave it in Your Excellency’s sea of consciousness for Your Excellency to refer to.”

He did not know what kind of uproar this sentence caused below!

Rule formation base? Hard to enter Your Excellency’s arcane sights?

That was rule formation base!

Those comprehending on Dao here were all Formation Dao powerhouses.

Which person did not set comprehending rule formation base as their lifelong pursuit?

But this rule powerhouse actually said that it was hard to enter His Excellency’s arcane sights!

Just what kind of existence was this lord!

These nine formation bases, even if passing one of them to them, they would be moved until they cried inordinately too, shedding tears of gratitude towards Lin Wushuang in their hearts. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Even if it was digging their hearts out, they would be willing too.

The lucky chance of a rule legacy was too hard to come across!

But the opportunity that they viewed as a treasure was actually not worth looking at when placed in front of Ye Yuan!

Everything that happened before their eyes today completely subverted their worldview.

Ye Yuan became incomparably mysterious in their eyes.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly and said, “These nine formation bases, leave them with me first. After I find a decent successor, I’ll help you pass them on!”

Lin Wushuang was overjoyed and said, “Many thanks, Lord Saint Azure!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Wushuang, what’s the relationship between this realm of rules and Deva Fifth Blight?”

Ye Yuan had never clarified the difference between Dao Ancestor and Deva Fifth Blight.

Deva Fifth Blights also had distinctions of strong and weak.

The strong ones could even stand up to Dao Ancestors as an equal!

While the weak ones could only rule a region.

Lin Wushuang said, “Deva Fifth Blight is the superlative of cultivation realm! Because after our small world reached Deva Fifth Blight, it won’t be able to improve any further! Even Dao Ancestors are actually only Deva Fifth Blights too. It’s just that they are augmented with rules and possess the power of rules. Hence, they dominate above all life. Incapable of breaking through cultivation realm, and so there’s only seeking a breakthrough in the power of laws. If one can reach the realm of rules, they can make their strength improve further, reaching the realm of Grand Ancestor! However, Dao Ancestors are able to mobilize a complete power of rule. Ordinary Grand Ancestors aren’t their match either. Unless they reached Shang Hang that level of realm, only then would they have the capital to contend with Dao Ancestors.”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Why is the small world unable to improve further?”

Lin Wushuang shook his head and said, “After reaching the extreme realm of Fifth Blight, it’s as if you reach a bottleneck, and can no longer integrate the power of Heavenly Dao into the small world. Back then, us grand ancestors studied it before together, and expended immeasurable effort, and yet we were unable to break this shackle too!”

Hearing what Lin Wushuang said, only then did Ye Yuan know what kind of realm Dao Ancestor was.

This was also to say that after reaching Deva Realm, what you competed in was not cultivation realm but the power of laws!

Especially after reaching Deva Fifth Blight, whoever’s power of law was stronger, whoever’s strength was greater.

Then would his cultivation realm be able to shatter Heavenly Dao’s fetters?

This was a path that no one had ever walked before. Where could he walk to, even Ye Yuan himself could not say for sure either.

But Ye Yuan had a strong feeling that this path that he took was correct!

Right now, Ye Yuan already reached the threshold of the ninth major realm.

How to take this crucial step, Ye Yuan did not have a complete idea yet.

Because to him, each cultivation realm needed to go through countless deductions, and could not have the slightest mistake.

A discrepancy of a hair’s breadth could lead to an error of a thousand miles!

Actually, the human race’s cultivation system originally already had problems after reaching Heavenly Emperor Realm. One must transcend the Deva blight tribulation to break through the realm.

This actually deviated from the normal cultivation method.

Although their strength increased, they also walked into a dead end.

Therefore, this step was similarly of vital importance to Ye Yuan.

Striding over, he might be able to open up another path!

Although my chaos world is far inferior to other martial artists in terms of space, in quality it completely crushes Deva Realm powerhouses! In fact, my chaos world is even somewhat struggling to make ends meet when absorbing the Heavenspan World’s heaven and earth spiritual energy. My chaos world shouldn’t lose to the Heavenspan World ... in terms of quality! Now, heaven and earth have already opened up. The next step is creating myriad life! It’s just that I need to think more about how to create a world that belongs to me. I need to be extra careful! Ye Yuan tried to figure it out in his heart.

Ye Yuan finally let out a deep sigh as he said, “Forget it. This step still needs to continue to deduce, can’t be impatient!”

Lin Wushuang’s gaze was flickering indeterminately by the side. He knew that Ye Yuan was thinking about the matter of cultivation realm.

But he similarly also knew that Lord Saint Azure was simply a freak!

They all, these people, weighed it over later on. They concluded that even if they had the same cultivation realm as Ye Yuan at that time, and the same law comprehensions, it was also impossible to destroy the Sentry Celestial Palaces without any traces!

What did this indicate?

This indicated that under the same cultivation realm, Ye Yuan was almost invincible!

This sort of thing, even they, these grand ancestors, were unable to accomplish it. If so, then how terrifying was Lord Saint Azure’s strength?

He had once discussed it with Shang Hang before. If Lord Saint Azure reached his realm of Grand Ancestor back then, he could absolutely have directly annihilated Tian Qing!

It was just a pity that Ye Yuan was not able to take part in the last Doomsday Battle.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Wushuang and said, “I want to make a trip down the mountain. You help me to seal off Eight Void Mountain. This period of time, no one is allowed to go out! Otherwise, kill without mercy!”

Lin Wushuang said respectfully, “Yes!”

Down the mountain, the expressions of all the powerhouses changed one after another.

But none of them dared to act rashly.

Eight Void Mountain’s grand array was already activated, it was too easy to eradicate them!

Even Yue Feng this kind of powerhouse, would face certain death too!

After all, this was a rule grand array!

Ye Yuan went down the mountain. When he passed by Yue Feng, Yue Feng suddenly plucked up the courage and asked, “A-Are you really Lord Saint Azure?”

Ye Yuan looked at him with a slight surprise and said, “You know about Saint Azure?”

Yue Feng’s expression was ugly as he said, “My family’s ancestor ... had also experienced the last Doomsday Battle! There’s the legend of Azure and Profound two saints in our family! Ancestor taught that when we see Saint Azure, we must show the most solemn of ceremonies!”

Done talking, Yue Feng directly knelt down toward Ye Yuan!
