“Paying respect to Little Martial Uncle!”

“Paying respect to Little Martial Uncle!”

These extremely old Extreme Light Pavilion pavilion elders all bowed towards Ye Yuan with unwilling expressions.

But in their hearts, they had cursed Hegemon Cloudmount several times over.

This old man actually took a Saint Sovereign Heaven in as a disciple. Where would their old faces go?

A bunch of old men with half a foot into Hegemon Realm actually called a Saint Sovereign Heaven as their martial uncle.

The scene was too beautiful until you did not dare to look.

Seeing these people’s behavior, Song Qingyang immediately felt much more comfortable in his heart.

Meanwhile, Li Clearcloud secretly sighed in relief.

Luckily Your Father joined early. Otherwise, I would also have to call this little fellow martial uncle like this bunch of little bastards.

“These guys’ seniority, they are all very low. It’s just because they cultivated to grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven and also entered the Emperor Sakra Heaven that they can call you as their martial uncle.

Otherwise, they won’t even be able to call you that,” Li Clearcloud said casually.

By the side, the old faces of the group of pavilion elders turned bright red.

In front of Li Clearcloud, they really did not have the capital to be proud.

“Your matters, Zhou Pinespring that little imp has already told me. You’re very good! This time, you’ve rendered great contributions for the alliance! Them calling you their martial uncle is also worthwhile. In our

lineage, there are only me and Zhou Pinespring two people left. The rest are all dead. So right now, in the Extreme Medicine Sect, apart from that old man, me, and that little rascal, your seniority is the highest,

understand?” Li Clearcloud continued explaining.

“Many thanks for explaining, Eldest Apprentice Brother.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, but he was very shocked in his heart.

He naturally understood what the phrase all dead that Li Clearcloud talked about meant.

As long as one did not reach the Hegemon Realm, there would always be Dao tribulation falling!

Furthermore, it would get stronger and stronger!

eaching grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven, cultivation realm could not rise anymore. There was only overcoming tribulation continuously.

Therefore, those disciples of Hegemon Cloudmount all died under the Dao tribulations!

But Li Clearcloud entered his tutelage the earliest, and yet, he was still alive all the way until now.

it could be seen how terrifying his strength was!

tt was just that Ye Yuan was very puzzled. Li Clearcloud was so heaven-defying. Why could he not break through to the Hegemon Realm.

Li Clearcloud seemed to have seen through Ye Yuan’s puzzlement and said with a disdainful look, “Zhou Pinespring that rascal thinks that his talent is outstanding. Actually, it’s also just like that. Talent this kind of thing

can’t be eaten as food! Immense accumulations erupting, understand? Your Eldest Senior Brother, me, my talent isn’t great, but I win in that I advanced gradually and entrenched myself at every step, walking step by

step until today. I’ve outlasted all the people in the same generation till they died. I’ve also weathered out those younger than me! Furthermore, barring no accident, I’ll outlast you too! Hahaha…”

“Don’t look at how your Eldest Senior Brother, I, am inferior to Zhou Pinespring that rascal currently. Once I break through to the Hegemon Realm, I can beat him until he has to look all over the ground for his teeth!

Furthermore, don’t look at how I haven’t reached the Hegemon Realm. If I really fight, I’m not weaker than some of the weaker Hegemon Realms! I can barely be considered a Hegemon Realm too!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he grinned and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, you might not be able to outlast me!”

Li Clearcloud smiled and said, “Divergent cultivators all say that, but in the end, they all died! Since time immemorial, grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven divergent cultivators have appeared before. But Hegemon

Realm divergent cultivators had never appeared before! Therefore, I can definitely outlast you!”

Ye Yuan was still unmoved and said with a light smile, “Then let’s wait and see.”

Li Clearcloud smiled and said, “You brat, you’re indeed a little interesting. No wonder that old man took fancy on you. Uh, enough nonsense. Step forward and pay respects to the forefathers! Be careful. This hurdle

isn’t easy to get through!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and walked over toward the memorial tablets.

There was a futon placed before the memorial tablets.

Ye Yuan arrived before the futon and knelt straight down.

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Ye Yuan gave three kowtows toward the memorial tablets and could not help feeling somewhat perplexed in his heart.

Wasn’t it said that it was difficult to pass?

It seemed like … there were no surprises. Could it be that it had not arrived yet?

“Eldest Senior Brother, did I do anything wrong? Mn? Eldest Senior Brother?” Ye Yuan got up, turned to look at Li Clearcloud, and suddenly discovered that Li Clearcloud was staring at him dumbfoundedly.

Not just him, all of the pavilion elders present as well as Song Qingyang, all had an expression like they had seen a ghost.

Ye Yuan was currently feeling uncertain in his heart when the entire great hall suddenly lit up.

He could not help turning around to look and discovered that those several thousand memorial tablets all gave off a dazzling light.

Ye Yuan felt as if a profound and inscrutable thing had descended on his body.

As for what this was, Ye Yuan could not put his finger to it either.

But Ye Yuan felt that there was an additional trace of vague connection between him and these memorial tablets.

His brows furrowed slightly, could it be that this was the test?

“Eldest Senior Brother …”

When he turned to look at Li Clearcloud again, Ye Yuan discovered that the expressions on his face became even more exaggerated.

That kind of shock already could not use words to describe.

Ye Yuan had a blank look, not knowing what was going on.

Very soon, those lights dimmed down. But that trace of vague connection was still there.

Ye Yuan looked toward Li Clearcloud, quietly waiting for his explanation.

Li Clearcloud swallowed his saliva hard and revolved around Ye Yuan a few times, as if wanting to see through Ye Yuan.

“It shouldn’t be!”

“How is this possible?”

“No matter how I look, there’s also nothing out of the ordinary!”

“What right does this kid have to surpass me?”

As he looked, Li Clearcloud shook his head, his mouth muttering non-stop.

How could Ye Yuan still not understand? He seemed to have done something incredible.

However, he really did not know what had happened. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Suddenly, Li Clearcloud moved closer to Ye Yuan and asked, “You punk, are you a freak? No matter how I look, you’re also not that kind of world-shocking genius! Why can you get all the predecessors’ recognition?”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Is all the predecessors’ recognition very hard?”

Li Clearcloud jumped right up and scolded, “Brat, stop posturing! The recognition of all the predecessors isn’t hard. It’s simply impossible! There are a total of 3892 memorial tablets here. As long as you obtain the

recognition of one-fifth, it’s considered passing the test. But nobody has ever obtained all the recognition! Do you know who obtained the most recognition before you?”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said, “That must be you, Eldest Senior Brother!”

Li Clearcloud smacked his thigh and said, “Hah! Boy, you’re really clever! Senior Brother, I, obtained a total of 3023 predecessors’ recognition. It’s even more than our master! Zhou Pinespring that rascal, there’s even

less need to talk about him. There were only 2631! What capability do you, boy, have? To actually pass with all the votes?”

Ye Yuan had a blank look and asked, “What does this recognition represent? Just what kind of test is this?”

He still could not make neither head nor tail until now and completely did not know what it was testing.

“Little Martial Uncle, the Extreme Light Pavilion’s test actually places the most weight on character and disposition! Of course, talent, potential, and other aspects all have a comprehensive consideration. This is a

feeling from the unseen world. It can’t be described with words. If one has to say it in words, it’s making more predecessors like you and bestow upon you the power of blessing!”

“Of course, making everyone like you is something impossible! Therefore, the predecessors who don’t like you will stand in the way of you paying homage. If the predecessors that like you are a lot, it will naturally press

down this obstruction. But the strange thing is that when you were paying homage earlier, there was actually no obstruction at all! Furthermore, you obtained the blessing power of all the predecessors! This … is too

inconceivable!”

Song Qingyang explained, his words carrying immense shock.

Truly, they had never heard before of anyone who could accomplish this.

What was the most difficult thing in the world?

That was naturally to make everyone like you!

Although the predecessors could not represent everyone, but making over 3800 predecessors like you at the same time, this was absolutely something extremely difficult.

But Ye Yuan did it!.
