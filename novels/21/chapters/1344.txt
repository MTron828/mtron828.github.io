Chapter 1348: The Greatest Benevolence

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Bullying people too far!”

The moment Chen Yongnian’s voice faded, Yang Rui quickly stood up, with a look of unrestrained rage.

This request was seriously too much!

Today, this was clearly a treacherous plot. Chen Yongnian brought the three great families to force an abdication.

“Tower Lord Yang, don’t get agitated! Sit down, sit down and talk! Mm?”

Seeing Yang Rui did not sit down, a surge of powerful aura released from Chen Yongnian’s body, oppressing Yang Rui.

In an instant, Yang Rui felt immense pressure.

The strength of middle-stage Heaven Glimpse was much stronger than initial-stage Heaven Glimpse.

Yang Rui did not have any leeway to resist in front of him at all.

Just as Yang Rui could not bear the pressure and was about to plop his bottom down, Ye Yuan slowly stood up.

A wave of faintly discernible aura slowly rose. Chen Yongnian’s face changed, his gaze looking towards Ye Yuan with astonishment.

This aura of Ye Yuan’s was not cultivation realm suppression, but ... contained a kind of Dao concept!

Under Ye Yuan’s surge of aura, Chen Yongnian’s aura actually had a feeling of imminent collapse.

Chen Yongnian was greatly astonished. If the standoff continued, his Dao heart would collapse!

Chen Yongnian withdrew his aura, the pressure on Yang Rui’s body suddenly eased up.

But his gaze turned toward Ye Yuan in astonishment. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“City Lord, Your Excellency, things can be talked through. Overwhelming people with power like this isn’t good, right?” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Everyone all looked at Ye Yuan with a solemn look. A middle-stage Grotto Profound actually made a middle-stage Heaven Glimpse’s aura give a wide berth?

This was truly too outrageous to hear!

Ye Yuan’s aura originated from the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

It also originated from the Chaos Heavenspan Canon!

Ye Yuan’s cultivation method was a terrifying existence that triggered the entire Heavenspan World’s abnormal activity.

Using cultivation realm pressure in front of him, wasn’t it looking for a pummeling?

“This city lord making him sit down, isn’t it in order to discuss properly? It was Tower Lord Yang who got agitated on his own! This city lord convened everyone together in order to discuss a good countermeasure!” Chen Yongnian found a way out for himself.

However, this could not conceal his inner shock.

Only then did he know that this middle-stage Grotto Profound boy in front of him seemed to be even more troublesome than Yang Rui!

Ye Yuan gave Yang Rui a look, motioning for him to sit down. He then smiled and said, “City Lord, Your Excellency, don’t blame this Ye for saying unpleasant things. It’s truly that you’re demanding an exorbitant price! The profits of the Essence Cultivating Pill, everybody is aware. Their three families don’t need to do anything and want to have a piece of the pie, how can there be such a good thing in the world?”

“Heh, we also didn’t say do nothing! What conditions there are, you all feel free to state them. Otherwise, if you really press the three of our families, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s business can also forget about operating any further!” Wang Su said coolly.

These words were rather shameless.

Use one’s butt to think and the person would also know that what Wang Su was referring to was definitely some despicable methods.

The meaning was, if I have a hard time, you all can also forget about having a good time!

But Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “That’s more like it! Since you want to negotiate, you naturally have to bring out sufficient sincerity. As long as you all are willing to offer enough price, it’s also not like this Essence Cultivating Pill can’t be given you all.”

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone’s eyes light up.

Of course, apart from Yang Rui.

“Ye Yuan, you ...” Yang Rui said anxiously.

The reason why the Myriad Treasure Tower could run a monopoly was because of the Essence Cultivating Pill’s advantage.

If they gave the selling rights to the other three families, their advantage would be all gone!

Unless it was a last resort, he absolutely would not agree.

Ye Yuan gave him a look, indicating for him to hold his horses.

Wang Su forcefully suppressed the wild elation in his heart and said calmly, “What conditions there are, feel free to list them! As long as it’s not too overboard, I believe everyone won’t refuse! Everyone is all in Jewelhill City, mutual benefits and coordinate development is the right path.”

Half a year passed, the Essence Cultivating Pill’s reputation already gradually spread to other places.

Right now, many other cities’ martial artists would also rush to Jewelhill City without paying heed to the distance, in order to buy the Essence Cultivating Pill.

At present, the Essence Cultivating Pill’s price rose again and again. But the people coming to buy the medicinal pill were still going after it like a flock of ducks.

This medicinal pill’s profits were too great!

How could Wang Su not be delighted?

Not just him, the other two families’ old heads also revealed expressions of wild ecstasy on their faces.

They never thought that Ye Yuan actually agreed so easily.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “My condition isn’t overboard at all. To you all, it’s merely a matter of lifting a finger.”

Hearing these words, the three families’ hearts eased up.

It seemed like the Myriad Treasure Tower was still afraid of the City Lord Manor in the end!

Ye Yuan paused for a bit, but his gaze looked toward Wang Lingbo and said indifferently, “His life, exchange for the Essence Cultivating Pill’s selling rights! How is it? It’s a good deal, right?”

The rest were still okay, but the Wang Family’s people’s faces all changed drastically.

Wang Lingbo even pointed at Ye Yuan angrily and said, “Brat, what do you mean?”

Wang Su’s face fell, and he said, “Are you making a fool out of our three families?”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said smilingly, “This is already my greatest sincerity! At the Yin Wind Den, the Wang Family’s three great elders hunted Luo Jian and me down. Don’t tell me that this wasn’t your idea! Every injustice had its perpetrator, every debt its debtor. It’s already my greatest benevolence to not let the Wang Family be buried in death!”

Previously, Ye Yuan was afraid of breaking Jewelhill City’s balance and made things difficult for the Myriad Treasure Tower, that was why he would spare Wang Lingbo’s life.

With his temper, directly exterminating the Wang Family back then was also not impossible.

But now, these few families were already riding on top of his head. How could Ye Yuan possibly show mercy to him?

“Heh, make my Wang Family be buried in death, your esteemed self has such high-sounding sentiments! With just the likes of you, a middle-stage Grotto Profound?” Wang Yuxiang said with a cold sneer.

“Ye Yuan, everyone said that if enmity is not settled amicably, there is no end to it! Even though the Wang Family sent people to hunt you down back then, you’re safe and sound right now, while their elders are all dead. This is also considered evening up. Give this city lord face and drop this matter at that, alright?” Chen Yongnian finally spoke up.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “The Essence Cultivating Pill’s profits, there’s no need for me to say no more. I just have this one condition! Agree, everything can be discussed! Disagree, then there’s no need to discuss anymore.”

Ye Yuan’s casual sentence sealed off all of the retreat paths.

The atmosphere instantly fell to a freezing point, becoming peculiar.

Yang Rui was expressionless, but in his heart, he prostrated in admiration toward Ye Yuan.

This move was played too beautifully, directly kicking the ball back to the other party.

Wang Lingbo’s weight was not light nor heavy, just nice.

If it were Wang Yuxiang, then it would appear too insincere.

Wang Lingbo was merely a Grotto Profound Realm martial artist and did not count as much. But he was also the Wang Family’s present family head, his status being extraordinary.

At this time, all of the focal points were gathered onto Wang Lingbo.

Especially Lu and Lin, two families’ old heads, their gazes faintly looked towards him.

What was even more damnable was that Wang Su’s gaze also wittingly or unwittingly flitted over.

Clearly, he was very conflicted.

Who was Wang Lingbo, how could he not perceive the current situation?

“Wang Su, what’s the meaning of this? Could it be that you’re going to kill your own clansman because of this boy’s one sentence?” Wang Lingbo’s expression changed and asked him.
