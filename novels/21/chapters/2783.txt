Chapter 2789: A Big Deal!

Above the sea, sword energy crisscrossed.

Starshine and Whalebillow two people were beaten to the point where they kept vomiting blood.

Although those Saint Sovereign Heavens who were chasing after Big Yellow and Jingfei avoided the core battlefield, each and every one of them was extremely alarmed.

The present Ye Yuan lost his All-Encompassing Sacred Tree. But he condensed and formed a Dao sword with his own Dao and gained enlightenment on heaven and earth with the Dao sword, perfecting himself.

One could say that the Dao sword was another All-Encompassing Sacred Tree, forcibly condensing the three great power of rules together.

This was Ye Yuan’s own Dao!

Especially after the baptism and tempering of the three-nine Dao tribulation, Ye Yuan’s Dao sword became extremely powerful.

Activating three power of rules with the power of the Dao sword, it was comparable to three laws transformation fifth form!

In fact, it was even stronger!

Therefore, although Saint Sovereign Heaven this realm span was huge, to Ye Yuan, there were basically no opponents already apart from grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens.

However, Starshine and Whalebillow two people’s strengths were indeed powerful too. They were actually able to last under now at Ye Yuan’s hands.

“Damn it, how can this boy be so strong? Lord Starshine and Lord Whalebillow almost can’t hold on anymore!”

“Why hasn’t that Wu Tuan returned yet? If Lord Purplesandal and Lord Soulcut still don’t come, the two lords are going to be killed!”

“Damn girl, don’t run if you have the capabilities!”

… …

Over on this side, Jingfei’s speed was extremely fast, slipping away from a group of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

While on the other side, Big Yellow alone restrained 20 to 30 powerhouses, and he also fought while running.

The present Big Yellow, his strength already reached upper Saint Sovereign Heaven, and his combat power was also extremely powerful.

If not for there being too many people, he would have long resolved the fight already.

“Hehe?… You big dumbasses, why would I fight you all head-on? After my Big Brother Ye Yuan defeats those two, he’ll naturally come and take care of you guys!” Jingfei laughed coyly.

The faces of each and every one of the Saint Sovereign Heavens chasing after her became black as the bottom of a pot.

What they were worried about was also precisely this.

Who would have thought that two great generals moved out and could not even take care of Ye Yuan?

However, right at this time, two powerful auras came from the sea and arrived with a howl!

All the Saint Sovereign Heavens were immediately overjoyed!

“They are here! Lord Purplesandal and Lord Soulcut are here! Four great war generals attacking at the same time, this kid is dead for sure!”

“Hahaha?… damn lass, see if you can still be arrogant!”

… …

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Two figures appeared instantly. Looking toward the scene of the battle in the distance, their pupils immediately constricted.

“Bold little thief, to dare show off your power in our Qian Kui Sea Region! Prepare to die!” General Purplesandal yelled angrily and brandished his blade, charging towards Ye Yuan.

General Soulcut also directly joined the battle without a word.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The addition of Purplesandal two people instantly escalated the fight.

Above the sea, tumultuous waves were swept up. Many seafolks at the bottom of the sea could not avoid them in time and were directly blasted out.

Regarding four great transformation experts, that combat power was not an ordinary kind of terrifying.

The two who were originally being beaten until they vomited blood repeatedly were also roused at this time.

Four people completely unleashed their big moves, suppressing Ye Yuan frenziedly.

For some time, they actually suppressed Ye Yuan.

When Whalebillow saw Ye Yuan being suppressed, he immediately said with a loud laugh, “Four out of the five great war generals moved out, boy, you can be sufficiently proud!”

Ye Yuan formed a sword with his finger and fired out one terrifying three-laws sword energy after another, but his words were calm as he said, “This Ye is merely passing by and doesn’t want to clash with everyone! Keep fighting like this, and I won’t be holding back anymore! Do you all really want to force me?”

Purplesandal smiled coldly and said, “Boy, can’t beat means you can’t beat! Opening your mouth to beg for mercy now, it’s too late!”

Whalebillow smiled and said, “Boy, I gave you a chance previously! It’s too late to beg for mercy now!”

Ye Yuan’s kindly persuasion turned into begging for mercy when the four great generals heard it.

Currently, in this sort of situation, Ye Yuan could still have reservations.

But, keep fighting like this, once his combat power was unleashed, he would not be able to hold back anymore.

But it looks like these seafolks did not intend to stop either.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and yelled coldly, “Universe sword formation, condense!”

The small sword at Ye Yuan’s glabella suddenly emitted a powerful light.

Hundreds of small swords instantly condensed and formed in the air!

Ye Yuan condensed transformed swords with divine essence and formed the Universe Sword Formation!

The current Ye Yuan did not cultivate a world. He only cultivated the Dao sword!

His world collapsed. All of the divine essences were stored in the Dao sword.

The Dao sword was where Ye Yuan’s foundation lay.

If the sword existed, the person lived. If the sword perished, the person would be dead!

Once the Universe Sword Formation was unleashed, it instantly enveloped the four great war generals.

The faces of the four great generals changed at the same time, each and every one of them feeling a great danger.

As soon as the sword formation rose, the four people were directly split apart, each fighting for themselves, and the pressure suddenly increased.

In merely a blink of an eye, the situation reversed again!

The other Saint Sovereign Heavens were immediately dumbfounded.

“This … This … He still has a trump card?”

“What a strong sword formation! The four lords utilized Great Dao Transformation and are actually unable to break out of the encirclement!”

“Even four great generals can’t do anything to this kid. What to do?”

… …

Everyone also did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually powerful to such an extent.

Four out of five great generals moved out and were still suppressed by Ye Yuan.

Didn’t this mean that in the entire Qian Kui Sea Region, apart from Sovereign Qian Kui, Ye Yuan could sweep away all?

When Jingfei, who was currently running away, saw the sword formation rise, she immediately laughed loudly and said, “Big Brother Ye Yuan is too impressive! See if any of you still dare to bully me, I’ll make Big Brother Ye Yuan take care of you in a while!”

The seafolks were really going crazy.

This girl was really too arrogant!

Yet, they could not do anything to her!

“Damn lass, don’t get smug! After Sovereign Qian Kui makes a move, you all will die without a burial ground!” Wu Tuan said furiously when she saw the situation.

She had just invited two great generals over, thinking that the battle could be reversed instantly, completely quelling things.

Who knew that she had not caught her breath yet and Ye Yuan suppressed the four great generals again.

Yet, this girl was still pulling aggro. She wished to tear this girl to pieces alive.

Jingfei made a funny face at her and said smugly, “Rubbish! If Sovereign Qian Kui is really going to make a move, he would have long taken action! Would he still wait until now??Hehe,?you big turtle, I’m going to ride you and look at the sea! If you dare to be disobedient, I’ll hit you until your head retracts! If you’re still disobedient, I’ll make Big Brother Ye Yuan beat your head out!”

Hearing Jingfei’s words, Wu Tuan almost went crazy. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If it were normal times, she would just treat it as a joke.

But now, there was really the possibility!

At the thought of being toyed around by this lass, she even had the heart to die.

“What are you all still in a daze for? The four of us aren’t his match. Go and call some people over for me! Quickly return to Qian Kui Hall! Raise the alert to the highest level in the entire Qian Kui Sea Region! Go tell Yun Yang! Have him go invite the war generals of the nearby three great sea regions over!”

On the battlefield, a loud yell suddenly came from Whalebillow.

Clearly, he was genuinely enraged.

It was not that he could not accept failure. It was just that with the entire Qian Kui Sea Region being challenged by a human punk, wouldn’t it be treated as a joke in the various major sea regions in the future?

Therefore, Ye Yuan must die today!

The expressions of the Saint Sovereign Heavens present changed one after another.

With this, it became a big deal!
