Chapter 1554 You Miscalculated

Wu Feng sat in the hall, his smile seemingly radiant.

Huang Haoran and Hao Qian sat on the right-hand side, appearing very flustered.

Although Huang Qian was saved, this 50 million went down the drain for Wu Feng.

Most importantly, it was a major loss of face!

Huang Haoran understood Wu Feng very well. He cared about face too much.

Normally, it was still fine. But if someone threatened his title as the south city’s number one alchemist, he definitely would not show leniency.

But this time, Ye Yuan’s power face-smacking thoroughly made a name for himself.

But Huang Haoran did not expect that Wu Feng’s mood today seemed to be pretty good still.

“Oh, Haoran, do you think that I’d blame you because of this matter?” Wu Feng said with a ghost of a smile.

Huang Haoran blushed with shame and said, “Master, I ...”

“Huhu, you followed me for so many years, could I still not know your feelings for Huang Qian? Otherwise, do you think that I’d invite Master to take action and come and diagnose him?” Wu Feng said with a smile.

Huang Haoran hurriedly said, “Haoran received Master’s kindness and will never be able to repay it! Haoran’s life is master’s!”

Wu Feng nodded and said, “For Huang Qian to be able to recover, I’m happy for him as well. You don’t need to think too much. This matter isn’t your fault.”

Huang Haoran said, “Master, this 50 million divine essence stones, I’ll definitely think of a way to return to you!”

Wu Feng laughed loudly and said, “You, why are you so stubborn!”

Huang Haoran bowed and said, “Master, if I don’t return you these divine essence stones, Haoran will have trouble sleeping and eating!”

Wu Feng smiled as he walked over, patted Huang Haoran’s shoulder, and said, “Really can’t do anything about you! Forget it, if you want to return a favor, it’s also not impossible.”

Hearing this, Huang Haoran’s mind eased up. but heard Wu Feng’s tone gradually turn cold as he said, “Then ... use your life to pay it back!”

Huang Haoran’s entire body trembled, suddenly raising his head and looking at Wu Feng.

Suddenly, he felt his chest tighten, all the blood in his body becoming stagnant. His divine essence gradually solidified and his consciousness also began to blur.

“Master, you ...” Huang Haoran looked at Wu Feng in disbelief. He knew that he was poisoned.

There was poison inside the tea just now!

Wu Feng’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Humph! Nice job, this old man became the entire south city’s laughing stock now! Either way, this life of yours was saved by this old man too. Returning to this old man now, you have no objections, right?”

Huang Qian’s heart suddenly twinged and he shouted, “Second Uncle, you ... you can’t die! Wu Feng! You motherf*cker! My second uncle is so loyal to you, you ... you actually want to poison him to death!”

Huang Qian swayed, already somewhat unsteady on his feet.

He drank the tea just now too and was clearly poisoned as well.

The toxicity was very strong. Huang Haoran’s eyes had already started to turn dim.

He used all of his strength to push Huang Qian out and said, “G-Go! Find ... M-Master Ye!”

Wu Feng sneered and said, “You look, your heart is already at Master Ye there, still loyal to me? But too bad, Huang Qian drank that cup of tea too. He’s the same as you, both unable to escape death!”

Huang Qian’s eyes turned bloodshot from anger, hot tears pouring out of his eyes, and his teeth gritting until it rattled.

The divine essence within his body suddenly revolved, his entire person rushing at Wu Feng like an arrow that left the bow.

Wu Feng was caught off-guard, not expecting that Huang Qian could actually still revolve divine essence.

However, Wu Feng’s strength was too powerful in the end. It was far from what Huang Qian could compare to.

Boom!

In a haste, the two people exchanged a palm. Huang Qian immediately wildly sprayed fresh blood in the air, flying out backward.

While Wu Feng was also shaking until his vital energy and blood was tumbling, and was actually powerless to chase after for a moment.

Huang Qian’s eyes were full of tears as he wailed, “Second Uncle, I ... I seem to be fine and can last until Master Ye there! You rest assured, I’ll definitely avenge you!”

Huang Qian discovered that even though he was dizzy, his entire person was only somewhat unwell. His symptoms did not seem as severe as Huang Haoran’s.

Hearing this, a hint of relief showed in Huang Haoran’s eyes, his face revealing a trace of a faint smile.

He got it, it must be Master Ye’s Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill, making Huang Qian be reborn anew. His resistance to poison also increased greatly, that was why!

“Master, you ... miscalculated!”

Finished saying this sentence, Huang Haoran’s closed his eyes forever.

“Second Uncle!”

Huang Qian’s eyes welled up with tears, shouting until his throat turned hoarse.

“Master Ye, you see what I brought you!”

Ning Siyu held her palm out. A faint blue flame appeared in her palm.

Ye Yuan looked at Ning Siyu, rather surprisedly. He said, “You specially got this for me?”

Ning Siyu smiled slyly and said, “Accurately saying, it’s we won it together!”

She briefly recounted the matter of winning against Second Senior Brother, making Ye Yuan smile.

“You had a good intention. This divine fire, I’ll accept it, cancel out the divine essence stones you owe me.”

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned. The faint blue flame came to his hand obediently.

Ning Siyu’s pupils constricted. This guy’s fire controlling art had simply reached the acme of perfection.

A foreign divine fire was actually so docile when reaching his hands!

But she felt something off very soon and said, “Hey, a divine fire is just worth four million divine essence stones? You ... You’re robbing me!”

Ye Yuan glanced at her and smiled, but his palm moved. The Blue Voyage Insight Divine Fire was directly stripped by Ye Yuan, leaving behind just a tiny little tongue of flame.

One should not underestimate this tongue of flame. This was where the essence of the divine fire lay.

Then, Ye Yuan’s palm flipped. The Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame suddenly rose.

His palm merged together again. The Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame directly swallowed that little cluster of fire up.

Ning Siyu opened her eyes wide and said indignantly, “Y-Y-You ... actually used your rank two divine fire to devour a rank three divine fire? You’re wasting God’s good gift!”

She finally managed to get Ye Yuan this rank three divine fire, who knew that Ye Yuan actually directly destroyed it!

Ning Siyu was so angry!

Even if you wanted to raise a fire, it should also be using rank two to raise rank three, right?

This guy actually did exactly the opposite!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How can that divine fire of yours compare with my Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame? In terms of pill refinement, I really can’t find any more suitable than it. Furthermore, it followed me for close to a hundred years and accompanied me through life and death countless times. I can’t bear to swap it out too. Devouring the fire essence, it should be able to evolve to rank three.”

Ning Siyu was a little surprised. Why were these words ... said in such an elderly person’s tone?

This guy was merely a hundred-odd year old. So why did he behave like he was several tens of thousands of years old, being an old man?

“Fine then, whatever makes you happy!” Ning Siyu shrugged her shoulders and said.

Just a rank three divine fire, it was nothing to Ning Siyu.

Right at this time, three figures entered the Miracle Hand Parlor.

An old man with a sage-like appearance, a fatty who was like a round ball, and there was also a very beautiful girl.

“Shopkeeper, I heard that this place will grant all requests, is this true?” the old man with a sage-like appearance asked the shopkeeper.

The shopkeeper said with a proud look, “That’s of course! You go and inquire about it, this land of south city, who doesn’t know our Miracle Hand Parlor’s Master Ye’s name!”

The moment these words came out, the three people’s faces changed.

“What did you say?! Your presiding alchemist here is also called Ye Yuan?” the old man exclaimed.
