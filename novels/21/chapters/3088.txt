Chapter 3087: Bloodcloud Grand Array!

Under the tree, the moonlight shadow was hazy.

Yue Mengli saw Ye Yuan in a daze, and her heart could not help aching a little.

This man was shouldering too many things.

But, she could not be of any help.

After Ye Yuan returned to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, he fetched Yue Mengli over.

With the Extreme Medicine Sect’s powerful foundation as support, plus the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, Yue Mengli, Lu-er, White Light, and the others, also stepped into the realm of Emperor Sakra Heaven.

It was just that in this war, their strength was too feeble.

This was the war of Hegemon Realms!

Having helped each other in humble circumstances for so many years, how could Yue Mengli not know what Ye Yuan was thinking?

“Big Brother Yuan, Big Sister Lingxue is blessed. She’ll definitely be fine.” Yue Mengli said softly.

Ye Yuan was stupefied and said with a sigh, “I hope so! When she left, she was too weak. Under the blood race calamity, she …”

Ye Yuan did not quite dare to continue imagining.

In this catastrophe that swept across all the heavens, ordinary Sovereign Realm powerhouses could only be cannon fodders too.

......

Only by reaching Emperor Realm could one barely manage to have the capital to protect themselves.

But, it was also merely just self-protection.

Yue Mengli sighed and said,?“Sigh,?Big Sister Lingxue’s life is really rough. I hope that she’s fine.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze fixed on Yue Mengli’s face.

That flawless face was suffocatingly exquisite under the moonlight.

Being stared at by Ye Yuan, Yue Mengli’s pretty face turned slightly red, and she pouted and said embarrassedly, “Big Brother Yuan, why are you looking at me like this?”

Saying that she was bashful, but actually, it was more of agitation.

It was because Ye Yuan’s eyes were full of love.

With many years of setbacks, the pressure on Ye Yuan’s shoulders was too great!

Therefore, he had never revealed such a look in his eyes either.

Ye Yuan sighed lightly and said, “Li-er, these few years, luckily there was you! I owe you too much!”

Yue Mengli shook her head and said, “Li-er’s strength is getting weaker and weaker, and I already can’t help Big Brother Yuan anymore! So many years, it has been the hardest on you.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You know that I’m shouldering too much debt on me, but without your silent support at the back, I couldn’t have made it at all. I’m shouldering too much, aren’t you the same?”

This woman was too sensible, sensible until Ye Yuan sometimes even forgot about her existence.

Walking all the way until today, he was paying his debts, repaying Mu Lingxue’s debt.

But, the more he repaid, the more he owed his woman too.

“Li-er, after this battle, I’ll marry you!” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Yue Mengli’s delicate body trembled heavily, lifting her head and looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

These words were domineering and brooked no questioning!

But it sounded pleasant to the extreme!

She had been waiting far too long for this sentence!

When Ye Yuan said it, she felt like she was dreaming.

Yue Mengli’s entire person was petrified there. The blissfulness on her face could not be concealed by any means.

“Status and riches are like drifting clouds to me, but my woman is going to become the happiest woman in this world! After this battle, I’ll announce to the world and marry you in full glory! I want to let everyone know that you are my, Ye Yuan’s, woman!” Ye Yuan said with decisiveness that could chop iron without the slightest hesitation.

The current Yue Mengli was already melted by happiness. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She knew that Ye Yuan was a low-profile person.

But for her sake, he was going to shock all the heavens!

She knew that this was Ye Yuan’s doting on her as his repayment to her.

Reaching Emperor Realm, love had already become a stranglehold.

To the vast majority of Dao companions, feelings had already become extremely faint.

But Ye Yuan acted in a diametrically opposite way. He was going to let everyone know about the wedding!

She did not say anything else and just nodded her head lightly.

At this time, silence won sound!

Not far away, a series of rustling sounds suddenly emitted, and it quickly returned to tranquility.

Yue Mengli looked at Ye Yuan and said, “Big Brother Yuan, is it … okay for you to be like this?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then I’ll call them back and take them all in together?”

Yue Mengli’s expression changed, and she said with jealousy, “No way!”

Ye Yuan smiled again and said, “Then isn’t it settled? It’s better to deal with painful things quickly. Let them stop thinking about it. It’s better than keeping it in their thoughts.”

Yue Mengli just sighed lightly when she heard that.

Only she knew that it was probably very difficult!

This man in front of her was too outstanding!

Once he entered someone’s heart, it would be very hard to chase away.

But in her heart, Yue Mengli was blissful to the extreme.

Regardless whether it was Feng Qingxuan or Cloudneon, they were all one of the 33 Heavens’ most outstanding women!

The current her was unable to compete with them at all.

But Ye Yuan’s heart never wavered from start to end.

For her sake, he even did it so decisively.

How could she not be moved?

The wind stirred lightly, and a little red light exploded in front of Ye Yuan’s chest, instantly enveloping this mountainside!

There was only a stretch of red color left in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed drastically, spatial origin pouring out, about to teleport away.

But it failed!

Ye Yuan felt that the surrounding blood power of rule had completely disrupted all of the rules. He was actually unable to teleport!

His spatial shift divine ability was actually unable to work!

Ye Yuan’s expression was solemn. He quickly understood that this was the Chaos Bloodstone’s purest origin of blood!

The origin of blood had the power of corrosion to begin with. How powerful was the Chaos Bloodstone’s power of corrosion?

At least, it was not what the current him could resolve!

The pores on Ye Yuan’s body opened up. He knew that the most dangerous moment had arrived.

“Stop wasting your energy! Once the Bloodcloud Grand Array is activated, forget about you; even if it’s a Great Beyond powerhouse, they will be trapped to death too!” A man walked out of the blood fog, holding a blood saber in his hand, a scar on his face.

This was actually a Hegemon Realm expert!

“I didn’t expect that to kill an Emperor Sakra Heaven we actually had to activate the Bloodcloud Grand Array! Kid, you can be sufficiently proud!” Someone else walked out of the blood fog. It was another Hegemon Realm expert!

“Ye Yuan, don’t count on someone coming to save you! The Bloodcloud Grand Array is condensed by exhausting all of the Blood Ward Bead’s blood energy. This place forms its own world. Unless the blood energy is depleted, you can forget about escaping!”

The third hegemon realm powerhouse!

The blood race actually sent three Hegemon Realms to deal with him!

What a grand display!

… . .

Boom!

Mi Tian slammed a fist on the blood cloud, but the blood cloud did not budge an inch!

Straight away when he discovered the anomaly, he already arrived.

But he discovered that this blood cloud that enveloped the mountain was sturdy to the extreme!

With his strength, he was actually unable to shake it in the slightest!

His expression was solemn to the extreme!

“Mi Zhen, Long Jian, the six of us join forces and attack. Break this blood cloud!” Mi Tian said in a solemn voice.

The six people were just about to attack when several figures suddenly appeared above the sky.

The arrival was precisely Yi Xue.

“Stop wasting your strength. The Bloodcloud Grand Array is transformed from the Blood Ward Bead. It’s condensed from the purest blood energy in this world! Once activated, no one can shake it within seven days! Get ready to attend Ye Yuan’s funeral!” Yi Xue looked at Mi Tian and said coolly.

Mi Tian’s expression changed slightly, but he did not believe it, bringing the six people and rushing towards the blood cloud again.

Boom!

The entire Extreme Medicine Sect started trembling.

However, that region of blood could still not budge an inch!

Mi Tian’s heart sank to rock-bottom!

Yi Xue smiled and said, “Ye Yuan is really a remarkable brat. However, it ends here too! Today, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven will be destroyed!”
