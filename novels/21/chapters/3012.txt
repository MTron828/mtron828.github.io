Chapter 3011: Contending for Young Patriarch!

“What a strong aura! Is this … the blood of Hegemons?” Ye Yuan said in surprise. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

These two blood essences contained tremendous energy. Furthermore, they were even peak heaven qian grade bloodline.

This kind of blood essence was very precious no matter which clan it was. It was absolutely impossible to be leaked.

Long Min gave Ye Yuan a glance somewhat enviously and said, “Progenitor forcibly made two Supreme Hegemons leave behind their blood essence for your sake. Furthermore, the commotion that you caused in the Eternal River was too big. It even alarmed Great Beyond Realm powerhouses. It was also Progenitor who helped you to fend it off.”

The Dragon Clan had quite the veiled criticism toward Ye Yuan.

Mi Tian was too good to him, making many Heavenly Dragon Island geniuses very jealous.

These few years, there were rumors saying that Progenitor wanted to groom Ye Yuan as his successor. This made those geniuses who were originally from the Dragon Clan very unhappy.

Ye Yuan was quite moved when he heard it. He naturally understood what kind of pressure Mi Tian had to bear with his way of doing things.

Even if one was Great Beyond Realm, they could not do as they pleased too.

However, there were not much words needed between him and Mi Tian anymore.

Along the way, they fought side by side and had long already entrusted each other with life and death.

It was just that this somewhat could not be understood from other people’s points of view.

“However, I don’t understand. What does Progenitor mean by taking the risk of offending the two clans to get you two drops of blood essence?” Long Min asked curiously.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’ll understand very soon. Where’s Senior Mi Tian? I want to see him.”

Long Min said, “Progenitor went to the Acacia Tree. After the Vermilion Bird Clan’s internal strife was quelled, because Feng Qingxuan possesses half-chaos bloodline and was chosen as the new Vermilion Bird young patriarch, Progenitor sent her back personally.”

Ye Yuan said with some surprise, “Half-chaos bloodline?”

Long Min said, “Four symbols family clans, extremely talented clansmen might awaken half-chaos bloodline, which is also quasi-chaos grade bloodline. They are geniuses with hopes of stepping into Great Beyond Realm. During these few years that you were in closed-seclusion, Feng Qingxuan awakened half-chaos bloodline and has already broken through to Emperor Sakra Heaven.”

Ye Yuan was dumbfounded from listening.

It was still his first time hearing that there was actually such a thing.

“In that case, our Dragon Clan also has half-chaos bloodline?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

“That we don’t. The Dragon Clan has two great progenitors suppressing our destiny. I reckon that it’s very hard for half-chaos bloodline to appear. The Vermilion Bird Clan’s progenitor went missing. But a half-chaos bloodline appeared now, and they guess that the Vermilion Bird’s Progenitor has already been murdered. Of course, this isn’t a certainty either. Progenitor Mi Zhen is very weak now. Maybe our Dragon Clan can give birth to half-chaos bloodline too,” Long Min said.

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “Mi Zhen isn’t dead yet?”

Long Min let out a sigh and said, “Progenitor Mi Zhen had his blood essence extracted, his strength falling greatly. Furthermore, he suffered a devastating blow this time. He has been dispirited and inert the entire time. He’s equivalent to a cripple now.”

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “He only had himself to blame!?Uh,?since Senior Mi Tian isn’t around, I’d better go into closed-seclusion.”

Long Min said in surprise, “You just exited seclusion. You’re going into closed-seclusion again?”

Ye Yuan pointed at the two small bottles and said with a smile, “Isn’t this burning with eagerness?”

Long Min frowned, not understanding, but it felt very impressive.

While talking, the two people had already arrived at the clan, and they saw several young men coming head-on, blocking Ye Yuan’s path.

These few youngsters had extremely strong auras. They were shockingly all Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses!

And their bloodline auras also crushed everyone. They were actually all peak heaven qian grade!

Heaven qian grade bloodline was very common on Heavenly Dragon Island. It was not considered very impressive.

But peak heaven qian grade bloodline, that was like the feather of a phoenix and horn of a Qilin, being very rare.

When bloodline reached heaven qian grade, it was like having cultivated to Hegemon Realm. Even advancing a fraction was extremely difficult.

Therefore, on this Heavenly Dragon Island, although everyone’s bloodline was very strong, there was actually still a difference in status.

Such as these few in front of him, one glance and it was clear that their status was extraordinary.

A total of nine people came. Each and every one had unfriendly expressions. Clearly, they came to look for trouble.

“Young Patriarch Long He, what are you all doing?” Long Min said in a solemn voice.

“None of your business, Long Min. Scram to one side for this young patriarch! If you dare to poke your finger in other people’s business today, this young patriarch will expel you from the Qin Niu lineage!” Long He said in a solemn voice.

Long Min’s expression changed, knowing that things could not be resolved today anymore.

He looked toward Ye Yuan somewhat apologetically.

He could not meddle in this matter.

The latter smiled, indifferent to it.

The statuses of the nine lineages’ young patriarchs were extraordinary.

And today was the fight for the Dragon Clan’s young patriarch. He really could not interfere.

The nine lineages’ young patriarchs originally had many conflicts.

But, because of Ye Yuan’s appearance, they had a common enemy and actually joined hands.

Actually, Ye Yuan had long discerned some jealousy from Long Min’s words.

It was just that he did not think that it came so quickly.

Heavenly Dragon Island’s nine dragon clan lineages were all the direct descendants of chaos true dragons, their bloodlines extremely strong.

Furthermore, the nine lineages’ powerhouse all inherited a portion of chaos bloodline talents. This was what other dragon clans could not compare to.

It was also precisely because of this that Heavenly Dragon Island was the holy land for the dragon race.

As for East Billow Region, those dragon clans, their bloodline was comparatively much thinner.

And among them, the difficulty of giving birth to Hegemon Realms was even greater.

Long He looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, I’m called Long He, Qin Niu Clan’s young patriarch! I challenge you! The loser will withdraw from the Young Patriarch Competition! Do you dare to accept the fight?”

Ye Yuan looked at the other party and said with a smile, “Nine Emperor Vast Heavens coming to challenge me, an Emperor Cloud Heaven. Are you guys sure that you’re not kidding?”

Long He said, “You turned the world upside down amidst the Eternal River chaos, even Great Beyond Realms came on a punitive expedition! Furthermore, you cultivated with the power of chaos. Your strength should far exceed those in the same rank, right? If we went to get a few Emperor Cloud Heaven over, wouldn’t it be insufficient for you to even fill the crevices between your teeth? How can this be said as us bullying you?”

These words were said in a high-sounding way, but actually, it was clearly bullying people.

Emperor Vast Heaven was Emperor Vast Heaven; Emperor Cloud Heaven was Emperor Cloud Heaven!

It was not to say that the disparity in-between was impossible to bridge. But it was indeed extremely, extremely difficult.

No matter how exceedingly formidable your means, no matter how powerful your bloodline, the gap between cultivation realms was still an insurmountable gulf.

“Heh,?there’s a show to watch now.”

“You guys guess. Will Ye Yuan be beaten this time until not even his parents can recognize him?”

“Tch,?this guy is at most considered half a dragon, to actually dare covet the position of young patriarch, truly wishful thinking!”

“He thinks that by bringing Progenitor back, he can be lawless and unbridled? For him to have today, Progenitor must have made great contributions! The favor of bringing back to the clan has long been paid off!”

… …

In the Dragon Clan, not everyone felt optimistic about Ye Yuan like Long Jian did.

Especially that Ye Yuan was just a mixed-blood. They did not acknowledge him at all.

Heavenly Dragon Island was also a pugilist world in itself, it was naturally impossible for all to be equal.

In reality, those who entered Heavenly Dragon Island from outside, their status was a grade below to begin with.

Let alone talk about Ye Yuan, this mixed-blood.

This matter about Progenitor wanting to confer Ye Yuan as young patriarch, it was also unknown how it spread. But the vast majority of the people on the island were conflicted about this.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “You make a lot of sense! However, I’ve no interest in the position of young patriarch. There’s no need to challenge.”
