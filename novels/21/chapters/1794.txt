Chapter 1798 Abode Gone

The main peak was extremely far away from the sub-peaks. Ye Yuan arrived at Tianying Peak through the transmission array and immediately had a feeling of falling to the human world from heaven.

Compared to the main peak’s splendor, this place was clearly much shabbier.

“Ye Yuan, I really feel unfair for you! With your talent, you should at least be on the top three sub-peaks. That bunch of fellows abuses their power to bully people and actually relegated you to Tianying Peak.” Beside Ye Yuan, a short and skinny young man said with an indignant look.

This young man was called Ceng You, he came from an unknown small sect.

His strength was not bad, peak Seventh Firmament Divine Lord. During the second round’s assessment, he even reached tier two.

Among the disciples that came out of small sects, he was already a dragon among men.

Logically speaking, he should not have been relegated to Tianying Peak, but he became the only inner-disciple sent to Tianying Peak.

The other 41 people were all relegated to the other eight sub-peaks.

Regarding this kind of unfair treatment, Ceng You was naturally unhappy about it in his heart.

However, Ceng You admired Ye Yuan greatly. That simple and casual flick shocked him deeply.

Similarly coming from a small sect, Ye Yuan’s potential was clearly much stronger than him.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If it’s gold, it will shine anywhere. I heard that Tianying Peak’s skill-imparting elder came from a small sect. But didn’t he also enter the ranks of True God Realm, becoming the ruler of a region?”

Ceng You smiled bitterly when he heard it and said, “Even so, Tianying Peak is still the most rundown sub-peak, ostracized by the other eight peaks!”

In the Shadowmoon Sect, Tianying Peak could be said to be a land of exile. No one was willing to come to this place.

Those who came here were mostly not wanted or disciples without factions.

And arriving here was also basically equivalent to having one’s future cut off. It would be very hard to have great accomplishments again.

Ye Yuan patted Ceng You’s shoulder and said with a smile, “Brother, upon entering the Shadowmoon Sect, you already forgot who you are!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Finished saying, Ye Yuan walked over toward Tianying Hall.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Ceng You’s entire body trembled.

Yeah, his sect was just an unremarkable Divine Lord level sect, deficient of resources, and severely lacking cultivation methods.

But he relied on his own efforts and walked until today step by step.

He thought that entering the Shadowmoon Sect, with his talent, he would be able to soar to the heavens in one bound.

But the current situation was too far from what he imagined.

So he felt indignant, felt wronged, felt that the future was bleak and dark.

However, looking back, even if he arrived at Tianying Peak, his current situation was also far better than before.

Hence, what was he still not satisfied with?

As long as he took out his past efforts, he would be able to stand out among his peers one day, and viciously slap those snobs.

To martial artists, while resources were important, what was more important was to have an unyielding heart that sought Dao.

Losing one’s true self, then the future would really be bleak.

“Rousing the dreamer from his sleep with a word! Ye Yuan, thank you!”

Looking at Ye Yuan’s back view, Ceng You’s gaze became determined once more, just as before.

...

“Senior Apprentice Brother, we’re new disciples here to receive cultivation abodes. This is my identity token.”

Shadowmoon Sect was established on a spiritual vein. The sect opened up many abodes on each sub-peak and laid down array formations, providing for disciples to cultivate.

The better the aptitude of the disciple, the better the cultivation abode they would get, and the faster the cultivation speed will naturally be as well.

Tianying Peak was where the spiritual vein was the thinnest among the nine sub-peaks. The spiritual energy was naturally also the thinnest.

That disciple took a look at the two people’s identity tokens, his brows involuntarily raising up, and he threw the tokens on the table with a thud as he said lazily, “You’re called Ceng You, right? Tianying Peak still has one last low-grade level two abode. This is the abode’s token, go on.”

Ceng You put away the token and said joyfully, “Thank you, Senior Apprentice Brother! Senior Apprentice Brother, then what about Ye Yuan?”

That disciple raised his eyelids and said with a fake smile, “Him? That was Tianying Peak’s last abode already. This junior apprentice brother will have to be inconvenienced and go to other stray peaks to open up an abode yourself.”

As he said, he took out an array flag and placed it in front of Ye Yuan with a smile and said, “This is the Spirit Gathering Formation’s array flag, you go to Firecloud Peak right now. As long as you find the eye of the spiritual vein there and open up an abode, then deploy the array flag, it will naturally be able to gather spiritual energy and become your own abode.”

Ceng You’s expression changed when he heard that and said, “How can it be so coincidental? Senior Apprentice Brother, I heard that opening up an abode is very dangerous. That place is all desolate mountain peaks, fierce beasts everywhere. Quite a few disciples have been buried there!”

That disciple’s gaze turned cold and he said, “Dangerous? Opening up an abode is dangerous? This main peak, nine sub-peaks, several hundred stray peaks, which one wasn’t opened up by Shadowmoon Sect disciples? Why is there an exception when it comes to him?”

Ceng You had just received Ye Yuan’s pointers and was endlessly grateful toward Ye Yuan. He could not bear to see Ye Yuan take the risk and could not refrain from saying, “Senior Apprentice Brother, why don’t you take a look again. Perhaps there are still vacant abodes on the stray peaks in this vicinity?”

The moment that disciple heard, he said in a great rage, “Insolence! Ask you to go where, that’s where you go, what’s with all the crap? I said don’t have means don’t have, could it be that ... you want to replace me on duty?”

Ceng You was merely a newcomer, how could he dare to argue? He said with a guilty conscience, “D-Dare not! Senior Apprentice Brother, how about this, give my abode to Ye Yuan, I’ll go open up an abode!”

That disciple’s face fell and he was just about to fly off the handle but heard Ye Yuan pick up the array flag and say coolly, “Alright, don’t need to be long-winded anymore. This guy has clearly been bribed by people already, deliberately making me go to Firecloud Peak to open up an abode, then get killed by fierce beasts. You’re just looking for a rebuff by telling him these.”

Ceng You’s face changed, only then, coming to a realization.

That disciple’s expression similarly changed and he said in a cold voice, “Punk, you dare to talk to your senior brother like this?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance scornfully and said coolly, “You already want to kill me, so could it be that I still have to speak to you politely? Moreover ... who the hell do you think you are, to be fit to be called as my senior brother?”

That disciple assigning abodes was merely a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, so Ye Yuan did not take him seriously yet.

That disciple’s expression turned cold and he said with a cold smile, “Very well, looks like it’s a very proud newcomer! Then I’ll let you take a look at whether I’m fit to be your senior brother or not!”

Within the radius of Shadowmoon Sect’s main peak and sub-peaks, it was forbidden for disciples to kill one another.

But with a valid reason, taking action against a disciple for a bit was no issue.

That disciple saw that Ye Yuan was merely Sixth Firmament Divine Lord and actually dared to be insolent in front of him. So he was also genuinely angered.

No wonder Senior Apprentice Brother Qian Ye wanted to teach this guy a lesson, looks like this punk was used to being condescending.

While talking, that disciple’s Ninth Firmament Divine Lord aura suddenly released. A slap smacked over toward Ye Yuan’s face as quick as lightning.

“Ye Yuan, be careful!”

Ceng You did not think that this guy would attack the moment he said so. It was already too late to want to stop it.

The other party was Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, his strength was more than a level stronger than him.

Slap!

An incomparably resounding slap transmitted over. That disciple was directly slapped flying out.
