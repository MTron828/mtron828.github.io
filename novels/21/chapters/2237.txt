Chapter 2241: The Powerhouse That Walked Out of the Blood Pool!

Ye Yuan’s heart was rippleless like an ancient well. He did not rejoice because of comprehending time law.

He only had one thought, which was to catch up to the Silvernet Blood Essence.

The Silvernet Blood Essence was too important to him!

Without the Silvernet Blood Essence, not only was he unable to let Dustless regain consciousness, Mu Lingxue would even thoroughly wither away!

Time waited for no man, Ye Yuan was already unable to keep waiting.

Closer!

Even closer!

Suddenly, the Silvernet Blood Essence’s footsteps suddenly stopped, and turned around abruptly, flashing Ye Yuan a charming and evil smile.

At this time, Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather was already completely gone. Clearly, he was eaten up by the Silvernet Blood Essence.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, alarming bells ringing! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It was only to see Silvernet Blood Essence suddenly suck in and was about to spew something out.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and suddenly opened his mouth.

“Immobilize!”

Time Freeze!

Silvernet Blood Essence’s move was not used yet and was immobilized by Ye Yuan firmly there, unable to move a muscle.

His eyes were full of astonishment.

He also felt the change in time flow earlier and knew that he could not run. That was why he turned around and attacked.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually still had such a follow-up.

“Sword of will, chop!”

Ye Yuan did not say a word, directly condensing the sword of will and chopped toward the Silvernet Blood Essence.

The Silvernet Blood Essence had a primordial spirit body, also a type of soul body.

Sword of will caused the greatest harm to him!

Silvernet Blood Essence gave a muffled groan and was directly blasted flying by Ye Yuan.

This primordial spirit was originally peak Empyrean. After absorbing Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather, he faintly showed signs of breaking through to become a Heavenly Emperor.

It was just that, he had not broken through yet. So how could he withstand such a condensed chope from Ye Yuan?

Silvernet Blood Essence suffered serious injuries and rolled on the ground. But then he actually escaped into the void again, fleeing like a wisp of vapor!

While at this time, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives also rushed over.

Ye Yuan suddenly turned around, his eyes icy-cold.

At this time, whoever vied for the silvernet blood essence with him, that would be a life-and-death great enmity.

Ye Yuan absolutely would not show mercy.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s look, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives could not help trembling. He actually did not dare take another step forward.

Ye Yuan did not have time to tangle with Heavenly Emperor Ninelives. Turning around, he chased after again.

Silvernet Blood Essence suffered heavy wounds. Its speed was no longer as fast as before. Ye Yuan went all out to chase after. This time it was much faster.

Before long, Ye Yuan caught up to the Silvernet Blood Essence.

“Immobilize!”

“Sword of will!”

Another set of combination techniques!

Without the slightest surprise, the Silvernet Blood Essence was seriously injured once more, rolling on the ground!

Casting Time Freeze repeatedly, Ye Yuan felt drained too.

However, in order to get the Silvernet Blood Essence, he also could not care that much anymore.

Silvernet Blood Essence was clearly not an ordinary primordial spirit. His strength was much stronger than even peak Empyrean.

Although Ye Yuan’s two chops were swift and fierce, it was unable to kill him.

Who knew that this guy rolled on the ground and ran away once more!

Ye Yuan secretly cursed in his heart and could only chase again.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In front, extremely horrifying booming sounds came over. Clearly, there were powerhouses fighting.

From time to time, there were even intense undulations transmitting out.

If not for Ye Yuan being adept in spatial law, he would have long been decimated by this strong undulation.

But this way, the difficulty of Ye Yuan catching up to the Silvernet Blood Essence also increased.

This silvernet blood essence charged inside crazily as if he did not want to preserve his life.

Suddenly, it became clear before his eyes. There was no more path ahead!

Ahead, was a massive blood pool.

In the middle of the blood pool, there was a huge whirlpool, emitting an undulation that made people’s hair raise.

This undulation was just like the signs of a precious treasure being about to come into being.

The source of this limitless blood light was this blood pool vortex.

Within the massive karst cave, there were dead bodies of fierce beasts covering the ground.

These dead bodies had just died and were still giving off extremely strong undulations.

While alive, they were clearly all late-stage Heavenly Emperor supreme level fierce beasts.

Above the dome of the karst cave, there were eight statues of gods carved in various directions, the faces contorted.

Above the vortex, there were clearly powerful restrictions.

These powerful Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were currently bombarding those restrictions frenziedly.

The restrictions already could not endure it and showed signs of about to collapse.

The two people, one chased and one fled, and actually arrived at the deepest area of the blood sea!

Instinctively, Ye Yuan felt that something was wrong.

But he could not care that much anymore.

His goal was the Silvernet Blood Essence!

“You can’t run anymore!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry and was about to employ the sword of will once more.

But right at this time, a horrifying to the extreme energy suddenly erupted.

Ye Yuan did not have time to make a move and was directly sent flying by a huge billow of air together with the Silvernet Blood Essence.

Ye Yuan spouted a mouthful of fresh blood violently, his figure jumping into the void, frenziedly avoiding the violent energy.

That blood-red restriction was broken!

Those Heavenly Emperors were caught by surprise, directly being blasted until they were sent flying out in all directions.

This horrifying energy undulation, even Heavenly Emperors could not block it too!

Fortunately, Ye Yuan was still very far away from them and was not situated in the center of the explosion.

Otherwise, even if Ye Yuan had the eighth transformation golden body, he would also die without a doubt.

In an instant, Ye Yuan displayed spatial law and avoided the countless streams of energy impact, that was how he turned danger into safety.

But even so, he still suffered heavy injuries!

As for the Silvernet Blood Essence, his primordial spirit body was already blown until there was only a phantom left.

The two people were both seriously injured.

And at this time, the unresigned Heavenly Emperor Ninelives also just happened to rush over and just nice ran into this surge of terrifying energy.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives directly suffered serious wounds and was similarly bombarded until he only had a phantom figure left. He then fainted unconsciously.

Right at this time, a figure slowly walked out of the blood pool.

That imposing aura shocked heaven and earth, disdaining all under the heaven!

Amidst the chaos, Ye Yuan gave a glance and his mind could not help being greatly shocked.

That person slowly walked out of the blood pool and gave a disdainful glance at the Heavenly Emperor powerhouses lying on the ground.

“You ... Who are you?” The Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor, Heavenly Emperor Quicksand, looked at the arrival with a look of horror.

The undulations emitting from this person seemingly indicated he was merely a middle-stage Heavenly Emperor.

But, the feeling that he gave Heavenly Emperor Quicksand was dangerous to the extreme!

The arrival looked at Heavenspan World Quicksand and said with a disdainful look, “Who am I? You aren’t fit to know yet! Foolish things! A spirit treasure can already make you all fight until heads are broken and bleeding! However, thanks to you all, this ancestor finally descended upon Heavenspan World anew! Hahaha ... Tremble, humans!”

That person carried a jade plate in his hand, emitting an aura that made people feel suffocated.

Clearly, such a big commotion was caused by this jade plate.

The expressions of Heavenly Emperor Quicksand and the rest changed wildly, only then, did they know that they were simply being exploited by someone!

“T-This ancestor? Could ... Could it be that you’re a Dao Ancestor? This ... This isn’t possible!” Heavenly Emperor Quicksand said in astonishment.

That person’s gaze revealed a trace of disdain and he said, “Dao Ancestor? Heh, after this ancestor recovers my strength, those few little fellows ... just wait and tremble!”

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan directly swallowed several medicinal pills, some that recovered divine essence, and also recovered injuries.

With end spirit divine pills entering the body, Ye Yuan’s injuries were recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Done with these, he directly grabbed toward the Silvernet Blood Essence.

But right then, the Silvernet Blood Essence flew straight towards that person who walked out of the blood pool with a whoosh!

Ye Yuan’s expression changed wildly!
