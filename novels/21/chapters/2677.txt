Chapter 2683: Land of Dragon Slumber!

“I don’t believe it! There must be something fishy going on!” Youqing pointed at Ye Yuan and roared angrily.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said coolly, “Looks like you’re planning on going back on your words?”

Youqing snorted coldly and said, “Going back on my words? You’re clearly playing tricks! It’s simply impossible for there to be true dragons existing in the seven great sea regions! How can you, a mere human, possibly reach the peak ninth segment?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Yuan sighed and said, “Well, since you’re going to act shamelessly, then I can only compel you to kneel.”

When Youqing heard, he could not help smiling coldly as he said, “Boy, you don’t seem to have figured out the situation yet, right? Do you really think that by defeating Muchen, you have the qualifications to challenge me? Testing dragon qi is one thing! Real combat strength is another thing altogether. Killing you doesn’t need the slightest effort at all!”

Ye Yuan’s smile was bright, and he slowly arrived in front of Youqing.

While Youqing looked at Ye Yuan, a cold sneer on his face.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan extended his hand and pressed on Youqing’s head.

“Courting death!”

But right at this time, his body suddenly stiffened and he was actually unable to move a muscle.

Then Ye Yuan suddenly pressed on his head.

Under Ye Yuan’s tremendous strength, Youqing could not help kneeling.

Bang!

Ye Yuan directly pressed his head on the ground.

Everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied, not understanding why this scene would happen.

Youqing’s strength could be rated as invincible among peers!

But why did he not make a move just now?

Ye Yuan patted his hand and said with a smile,?“Mn,?it’s still kowtowing like this, it’s more satisfying.”

Youqing’s head was touching the ground, and he had no way of lifting his head at all. He kept maintaining the posture of kowtowing.

But his slightly trembling body currently showed the fury in his heart.

“Ye Yuan, you’re dead for sure! Even if you fly up to the heaven and tunnel into the earth, I’ll tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces too!” Youqing said with an angry roar.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I were you, I’d keep a low profile at this time. If I’m not happy, I can kill you with one sword now.?Uh,?don’t tell me that you have a noble background, I, Ye Yuan, never ask about background when killing people. If you don’t believe me, you can give it a try.”

Sure enough, one sentence and Youqing shut up.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one felt chills in their hearts.

They all could tell that Ye Yuan had poisoned him.

But no one could tell when Ye Yuan applied the poison, and how he applied the poison.

No one expected that Ye Yuan actually still had such strange means.

Jumping realms to battle, ninth segment dragon qi, a poison expert, Ye Yuan’s identity became incomparably mysterious in their eyes.

In fact, their faces even carried some awe and fear.

“Alright, this kind of occasion is very boring, I won’t be taking part. Farewell!” Finished saying, Ye Yuan turned around and left.

“Hold on!” Black Flood Dragon King hurriedly shouted.

Ye Yuan turned around and said with a cold smile, “Why? Are you planning on standing up for him?”

Black Flood Dragon King smiled and said, “This is about young people’s dispute caused by personal feelings. So why would this king intervene? As long as there are no deaths caused, this king won’t care. Making you stay, it’s actually because I have something to ask.”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “What is it?”

Black Flood Dragon King said, “Actually, the seven great sea regions’ young powerhouses are gathering here because a mystic realm in my Thistle South Sea Region is about to open soon. When the time comes, Jingfei will enter it too. Young Friend Ye’s skill is extraordinary. I want to invite you to accompany her and enter the mystic realm together!”

Turns out that this mystic realm was called Land of Dragon Slumber. Legends had it that it was the place where a true dragon fell.

The rise of the Black Flood Dragon King was inextricably linked to this place.

He obtained the dragon race’s secret art in the Land of Dragon Slumber, attaining Dao in the end, and had half a foot stepped into the realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven, dominating a region.

However, each person could only enter this Land of Dragon Slumber once.

If they entered a second time, they would be killed by some kind of mysterious power!

The Black Flood Dragon King was unable to enter personally, but he was also worried about Jingfei’s safety. That was why he entrusted Ye Yuan to enter and act as a bodyguard character.

“Huhu,?Young Friend Ye, don’t blame me. This king had this idea, so I naturally had to understand your strength too! In these seven great sea regions, everyone knows that Jingfei this lass is my darling. If any accidents happen to her inside, I won’t be able to forgive myself for life! Therefore, I hope that Young Friend Ye can lend a helping hand! Furthermore, since Young Friend Ye is in possession of a true dragon bloodline, perhaps you might obtain some massive lucky chances in the Land of Dragon Slumber?” Black Flood Dragon King did not put on any airs and said sincerely.

Although Jingfei this girl liked to play pranks, she was actually very pure.

She did not have much idea of right or wrong in her heart, she just purely felt that it was fun.

Ever since the last time, this girl became very dependent on him.

In this one year, the two of them transmitted their voices over thousands of miles, and they were already very familiar with each other.

Furthermore, subduing Ironcore and Min Nanshan this time, Jingfei made tremendous contributions too.

Since that was the case, there was nothing wrong with accompanying her on a trip.

Furthermore, just as Black Flood Dragon King said, he might obtain some lucky chance inside, who knew.

One had to know, Black Flood Dragon King did not enter deep back then. He probably walked less than halfway in and already had such accomplishments!

This showed that the Land of Dragon Slumber must be an extremely terrifying place.

The more dangerous the place, the more opportunities there were as well.

Black Flood Dragon King naturally knew that with Ye Yuan and Jingfei working together, it was virtually equivalent to a peak Jade Sovereign Heaven mighty expert.

After entering inside, protecting themselves should not be a problem.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, accompany me to go inside! It must be very fun in there!” Jingfei lopped around Ye Yuan’s neck and said coquettishly.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Okay, I can accompany you to go inside. But, you have to listen to me! Otherwise, I’ll act alone!”

Jingfei planted a kiss on Ye Yuan’s face and said joyfully,?“Hehe,?Big Brother Ye Yuan is the best!”

… …

The banquet ended in unhappiness.

Youqing was carried back by someone. He was hit by Ye Yuan’s Petrification Powder. Within three hours, he would not be able to move at all.

After going back, he naturally flew into a thunderous rage.

However, this expedition to the Land of Dragon Slumber could not dispense with a bout of fierce fighting.

After everyone left, in the bedroom palace, the mermaid queen said, “King, is it really okay to hand Jingfei over to that Ye Yuan?”

Black Flood Dragon King smiled and said, “You probably don’t know this. The Emerald Sea Divine Conch has to submit in front of him too! It can be imagined how powerful the true dragon bloodline in his body is! The Emerald Sea Divine Conch is the treasure that this king obtained in the Land of Dragon Slumber!”

The mermaid queen said in surprise, “How can he, a human, possibly has such a powerful true dragon bloodline?”

Black Flood Dragon King shook his head and said, “He shouldn’t be a pure human. Otherwise, his true dragon bloodline absolutely won’t be so powerful! True dragons rarely appear in the 33 Heavens. But this king feels that boy is likely … a true dragon! Because the aura on his body is very similar to the one I encountered in the Land of Dragon Slumber back then!”

The mermaid queen was shocked to the extreme in her heart.

A human was actually a true dragon.

Most likely, no one would believe this sort of thing!

But Black Flood Dragon King would not lie to her!

This sort of thing was too inconceivable.

But at this time, Black Flood Dragon King’s gaze turned cold and he said with a cold smile, “Heh heh, after he comes out of the Land of Dragon Slumber, most likely, breaking through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum shouldn’t be a problem.. At that time, this king will extract his dragon marrow, and stepping into Saint Sovereign Heaven will absolutely be a cinch!”
