Chapter 1643 Tired of Living

“Kid, you’re still a little inexperienced to want to scare us! If you’re sensible, hurry up and hand over the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain. We’ll make it painless for you.”

Hao Liang’s expression changed. Only four of them came, so where did this fifth person come from?

Did this boy make up a non-existence person, wanting to scare them, and then take the opportunity to escape?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Turns out that you’re aiming for the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain. Giving you the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, can you afford to enjoy it?”

Hao Liang snorted coldly and said, “That doesn’t need you to worry about! Sure enough, want to scam us, is it? Heh heh, where’s the fifth person from?”

Hao Liang surveyed the four directions and discovered that no one came out, and became even more certain of his own guess.

Ye Yuan was rather surprised too. He even thought that these five people were together, looks like he guessed wrong.

Ye Yuan turned to a direction and said to a large tree coolly, “Still not showing yourself, do you want me to invite you out?”

Finished talking, a figure indeed floated down from the treetop.

“Ning Tianping!” Hao Liang cried out in shock.

He did not expect that there was actually really a fifth person existing.

Ye Yuan was similarly very surprised. He did not expect that this fifth person was actually Ning Tianping.

Ning Tianping looked at Ye Yuan and said with a helpless look, “Your Excellency, I originally wanted to ambush Hao Liang. Now, being called out by you, what am I going to do?”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a laugh, “Just clay chickens and pottery dogs, why is there a need to sneak attack?”

Ning Tianping chuckled and said, “I knew that Your Excellency had the means. These few fools even thought that Your Excellency is easy to bully!”

These two people chorused together, not taking Hao Liang four people seriously at all.

Hao Liang was furious!

“Ye Yuan, you’re no longer an elder now. Do you really think that you’re impressive? A mere Ning Tianping, could he still save you?” Hao Liang said with a cold snort.

Ning Tianping looked at Hao Liang and said with a disdainful look, “His Excellency’s means, you can never imagine it! Even if I don’t come, do you think that you can kill him?”

Hao Liang smiled coldly and said, “What a joke! A measly Origin Deity Realm, even if he knows spatial laws, could it be he still wants to escape alive from the hands of us four? Leave Ning Tianping to me, the three of you, kill Ye Yuan for me!”

“Yes!” the three people answered, swarming over toward Ye Yuan.

While Hao Liang’s figure moved, charging over toward Ning Tianping.

Ning Tianping was not the least bit afraid, raising his sword and attacking!

During these 300 years, Ning Tianping’s strength improvement was not as fast as it used to be anymore.

He knew that the medicinal effect of the Vastsun Universe Pill already passed.

A rank three divine pill could not possibly guarantee him for life.

But dealing with Hao Liang, he was still brimming with confidence.

The two people’s strengths were evenly matched, unable to determine the victor for some time.

While the other three second-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses already surrounded Ye Yuan in the middle with a triangle formation.

“Attack!”

The three people cooperated tacitly, making a move at the same time, attacking Ye Yuan in three directions.

To an Origin Deity Realm martial artist, this was virtually a certain death situation.

However, Ye Yuan did not seem to have the intention of dodging and did not even make a move.

Rumble!

Suddenly, a loud explosion rang out.

The horrifying energy undulation made Hao Liang’s side palpitate too.

A second-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse was directly blown flying.

Ye Yuan’s figure drifted out several thousand feet away.

Bang!

That second-layered heaven Divine Lord’s corpse landed heavily on the ground. It was as if a heavy hammer struck on everyone’s heart.

The corpse was already a blurry mess of flesh and blood, without any breath. Clearly, he was blasted to death.

Clank!

Hao Liang and Ning Tianping separated upon contact. He looked at Ye Yuan and said in alarm, “You ... You’re mad! You actually ... You actually detonated a divine lord mystic treasure!”

There’s a world within divine lord mystic treasures, forming a region of space on its own, containing world power.

Once divine lord mystic treasures were destroyed, the world power exploding within an extremely small radius, the power was extremely great.

Even Divine Lord Realm powerhouses would also be certain to die when blasted in close-range by a detonated divine lord mystic treasure.

This second-layered heaven Divine Lord was the nearest to Ye Yuan just now, Ye Yuan directly detonated a divine lord mystic treasure.

It was just that divine lord mystic treasures were extremely precious. Hao Liang only barely managed to obtain one after breaking through to become a third-layered heaven Divine Lord.

This kind of thing, not reaching life and death juncture, who was willing to detonate?

Furthermore, without a convenient weapon, one’s combat strength would also be greatly diminished.

The poor second-layered heaven Divine Lord died until he did not know how he died.

The other two second-layered heaven Divine Lords also arrived successively, suffering varying degrees of injuries.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Being able to kill people is enough, why is it crazy?”

Hao Liang could not help suffocating when he heard that. He did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually do such a crazy action.

“Humph! So what even if you detonate a divine lord mystic treasure? Could it be that you still have a second divine lord mystic treasure? If you have the capability, detonate the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain!”

Hao Liang laughed coldly, but very soon, his smile turned stiff on his face, his expression ugly to the extreme, his eyeballs popping out.

It was only to see Ye Yuan take out another divine lord mystic treasure unhurriedly and started playing in his hand.

“Pfft! Hahaha! Hao Liang, I told you just now. His Excellency’s means are what you can never imagine!” Ning Tianping seriously could not hold it in and said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan said with an amused look, “I don’t have much, just a lot of divine lord mystic treasures. Uh ... blasting you guys dead eight or ten times shouldn’t be a problem.”

Hao Liang said with a look of disbelief, “You keep bragging! Do you think that you can use this to scare me? When did divine lord mystic treasures become common wares?”

Just finished talking, Ye Yuan took out another divine lord mystic treasure and said with a grin, “Do you believe me or not? Still don’t believe me?”

While talking, Ye Yuan took out another divine lord mystic treasure.

Hao Liang completely broke down!

He strove for no idea how many years for a divine lord mystic treasure.

But this brat who was not even Divine Lord Realm actually took three out all at once!

No, wait, counting that one that detonated just now, he actually had four!

What was wrong with this world?

When those two second-layered heaven Divine Lords saw this scene, they were overwhelmed by terror.

It was still their first time experiencing the explosion of divine lord mystic treasures. The power just now made them still have lingering fear in their hearts until now.

“W-We’re not playing anymore!”

Finished talking, the two people’s figures moved, speeding madly into the distance.

They were already badly frightened. Another explosion and they definitely would not have bones left.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly and his figure suddenly vanished.

Rumble!

Another explosion, two second-layered heaven Divine Lords were directly blown into smithereens.

The explosion this time was even fiercer than the previous one.

When Hao Liang saw this scene, he was frightened until his legs turned soft, nearly kneeling down on the ground.

The power of this explosion, even he also did not dare to face it head-on!

“You ... You’re really a madman! Even if you have quite a few divine lord mystic treasures, you also don’t need to be like this, right? They ... They already decided to escape.”

Hao Liang even had the heart to cry, this brat was simply a demon. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Now, he wished to give himself several tight slaps!

How was this him killing people to rob their property? This was simply him being an old person eating arsenic, courting death!
