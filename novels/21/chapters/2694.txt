Seeing Ye Yuan asked, Zuo Qing’s face could not help turning black.

Clearly, he had been brooding over this too.

“Humph!?Meng Frostwind isn’t around. Capturing Heavenly South City was an easy job originally. But who knew that three half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens suddenly appeared in Heavenly South City! With their backs against the city protecting grand array, they fought several times with the five kings and actually managed to hold on!” Zuo Qing said gloomily.

“Three half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens?”

Ye Yuan’s eyebrows shot up, and he smiled knowingly and said, “Looks like these guys didn’t disappoint me!”

If he didn’t guess wrongly, these three people should be Zhao Xun, Wu Jian, as well as Song Tianyang or Yun Baiyu as one of them.

It seemed like his guidance played a role at the critical moment.

The moment Zuo Qing heard, he smiled coldly and said, “Didn’t disappoint you? Brat, who the hell do you think you are? Saying it like these three half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens were groomed by you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Enough crap. I want to meet the five kings. Lead the way.”

Zuo Qing’s face fell, and he said with a cold snort, “A mere Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, what qualification do you have to meet the five kings? Greenrock, what are you doing? Why haven’t you killed him yet?”

Greenrock had a dark face and said nothing.

He could not say that he was kidnapped over, right?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I came to give the five kings good fortune! If you delay it, you won’t be able to bear the crime.”

The moment Zuo Qing heard, he was even more disdainful and said, “You? Give the five kings good fortune??Hahaha,?what a joke! Greenrock not making a move doesn’t mean this commander won’t be making a move, go and die for me!”

As he said, Zuo Qing urged his palm to kill Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, his figure suddenly disappearing.

Boom!

At the same time, there was an earthquake.

A giant mountain suddenly descended, directly crushing hundreds of true spirits to death.

Originally, Ye Yuan’s arrival was not conspicuous at all among this army of countless true spirits.

But currently, everyone’s eyes focused at one point.

Zuo Qing’s expression changed. He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s movement technique was so fast the even he could not keep up.

Furthermore, this guy actually still had such a treasure.

Ye Yuan looked at Zuo Qing and said coolly, “Still want to attack?”

Zuo Qing’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Brat, no matter how fast your movement technique is, can you charge out of the army?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I didn’t come to kill in the first place. Just now, this move was just to warn you. Of course, while you’re at it, tell the five kings that someone is looking for them.”

“Who is it, to dare be insolent on this king’s territory!”

Sure enough, right at this time, an angry roar sounded out.

A brawny man with a tiger face and a human body arrived with a howl.

Zuo Qing said in a solemn voice, “Wild Lion King, this human said that he has an important matter and wants to meet the five kings. This lowly one didn’t let him meet. So he let out his treasure and killed the children!”

“A mere lower Limitless Sublime Heaven, what important matter can you have to come and meet this king? Just kill and be done with it!” Wild Lion King was furious and was about to attack Ye Yuan.

This Wild Lion King clearly had an incomparably fiery temperament. He brimmed with imposing vigor when walking, his imposing momentum billowing to the sky.

Even these true spirits were quite afraid of him.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and just smiled and said, “I’m Heavenly South Pill Hall’s Third Hall Master, Ye Yuan. I came to meet the five kings to give the five kings good fortune. Of course, if you guys don’t want it, you can take action and kill me right now.”

Wild Lion King was taken aback and said, “Give us good fortune??Hahaha,?what high-sounding sentiments! This king wants to hear what kind of good fortune you want to give us.”

“Saint Sovereign Heaven!” Ye Yuan spat out three words nonchalantly. It was as if these three words were not worth money at all.

“Tch,?a mere Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, your own cultivation is 108,000 miles away and you keep harping on about Saint Sovereign Heaven. Really shameless boasting!” At this time, another figure appeared. It was a man with a sharp mouth and a hawkish face.

Although his aura was different from Wild Lion, it was almost on par. Clearly, it was another king.

Ye Yuan did not retort and said with a smile, “The other three kings, why don’t you show yourselves together?”

The sharp-mouthed man and Wild Lion could not help furrowing their brows, secretly startled in their hearts.

This brat was merely Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, he could actually detect the three of them?

If it were before, Ye Yuan naturally would not be able to detect it.

But ever since cultivating the first level of Divine Emergence, Ye Yuan’s origin divinity skyrocketed, his divine sense also became much keener.

Ye Yuan’s eyes glanced in three directions of the true spirit army respectively, the sharp-mouthed man and Wild Lion King no longer had doubts.

At this time, the true spirit army automatically opened up a path. Three powerful figures walked out.

Five half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens all arrived! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Wild Lion King, Myriad Elephant King, Heavenly Rat King, Bright Tiger King, as well as Giant Deer King!

“Brat, this king admits that you have some capability! But, if you don’t give a reason, this king is still going to kill you!” Myriad Elephant King looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice.

The three of them had actually long arrived, but they intentionally restrained their auras. They did not expect that Ye Yuan saw through it at a glance.

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “Five kings, you sent a punitive expedition against Heavenly South, it’s nothing more than because Meng Frostwind snatched away your lucky chance. But the few of you are clever people. Even if you all slaughter Heavenly South clean, Meng Frostwind won’t come out either. But, if he breaks through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, have you all thought about the consequences?”

Ye Yuan’s words caused some chances in the expressions of the five kings.

The five people destroyed Meng Frostwind’s foundation. Once Meng Frostwind broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, the first thing would definitely be finding them for revenge.

Although there were Saint Sovereign Heavens in the Myriad Demons Mountain too, they would not act for these five people.

In reality, it was also not calm and tranquil in the Myriad Demons Mountain.

If not because of Meng Frostwind, it would be run of the mill for these five to send punitive expeditions against each other too.

As long as Meng Frostwind did not go too overboard, the Saint Sovereign Heavens in the Myriad Demons Mountain would not make a move.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and struck while the iron was hot and said, “So, you guys attacking Heavenly South looks to be venting your anger. Actually, apart from infuriating Meng Frostwind even more, it doesn’t serve any use.”

Heavenly Rat King smiled coldly and said, “So what? Could it be that you can really let us break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not now, but I can in the future!”

“Hah!?In the future! After you break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven and refine Sacred Destiny Pills for us? Putting aside whether or not you can break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, even if you really broke through, we’d have long already become dead souls under Meng Frostwind’s palm! Rather than that, better to kill to our heart’s content now!” Heavenly Rat King said with a sneer.

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “No need to wait until Saint Sovereign Heaven, as long as I break through to Jade Sovereign Heaven, I’ll be able to help you all step into Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

A doubtful expression immediately showed in the five people’s eyes.

Wasn’t these words equivalent to drawing a biscuit to stave off hunger, and looking at the sea to quench one’s thirst?

Bright Tiger King said with a cold snort, “Brat, do you take the few of us to be fools? Your delaying tactic is a little too mediocre! Stop talking nonsense with this boy! Kill him and continue attacking the city!”

The other four people nodded in succession and were already prepared to make a move.

Ye Yuan still had a calm expression as he pointed at a little tiger behind Bright Tiger King and asked, “This is your son?”
