Chapter 2395: Azure and Profound Dual Saints!

Jian Rufeng’s aura pierced the horizon as if going to punch through this sky.

He was too strong!

Being able to surpass the divine race’s strongest celestial master, Jian Rufeng’s strength was beyond a doubt.

From his body, countless filaments emerged, injecting into the sun crazily.

The blazing sun slowly rose, and flew higher and higher, heading straight for that horizon.

His figure also gradually became illusory.

“Lord Profound Secrets, take care!”

“Lord Profound Secrets, f-farewell!”

... ...

The geniuses knelt down one after another and paid obeisance towards Jian Rufeng’s gradually dissipating figure over and over again.

The bitter and painful atmosphere spread throughout the entire world.

Suddenly, a drizzle floated down from the sky.

Perhaps, even heaven was moved too, right?

Ye Yuan’s throat choked up. Even if he had long already known the ending, he could not resist weeping at this time too.

Cultivators, who did not hope for longevity? Who was did not hate to part with the secular world?

Even Ye Yuan was unable to rise above conventions too.

Did Jian Rufeng not have any reluctance to part with this world?

Of course he had!

Ye Yuan saw too much reluctance in his eyes!

He could not bear to part with his younger brother, his youngest son, and could not bear to part with the foundation that he created.

But he still left resolutely.

As if this world already had no one who could hold him.

How much courage did this require?

If there was a clear future, Jian Rufeng’s sacrifice might be very meaningful.

But Ye Yuan knew that everyone present had too many uncertainties about the future.

Among them, it included Jian Rufeng himself.

If his sacrifice could not exchange for the rise of the myriad races.

If in the future, the divine race suppressed the myriad races.

Then, his sacrifice would have no meaning at all.

But, he still went to do it unswervingly!

At this very moment, any words were feeble.

Jian Rufeng might not have been the strongest person in two epochs, but, he was the number one virtuous person in two epochs!

Fully deserving!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan saw that the resolve in the eyes of the geniuses was unprecedented!

Jian Rufeng was burning himself, and igniting the hope of the myriad races!

“Ji Qingyun, is your heart made out of stone? Facing everything that Profound Secrets has done, don’t you feel ashamed standing here? Do you want him to die with his eyes open?” All of a sudden, Witchcloud burst out, questioning Ye Yuan.

Everyone knew what Ye Yuan’s existence signified.

If Deicide originally only had one spiritual pillar, that would be Jian Rufeng.

But all these had quietly changed following Ye Yuan’s arrival.

Very soon, Deicide became a dualistic structure.

Jian Rufeng and Ye Yuan were both the leaders in everyone’s hearts.

Now, Jian Rufeng was about to pass away, Ye Yuan was the best successor.

But Ye Yuan actually had no intention of taking part!

Hence, Witchcloud wanted to use this shout to redeem Ye Yuan’s heart.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “Senior Witchcloud, it is not that this Ji doesn’t want to, but that ... I can’t!”

“You! Just why is it?!” Witchcloud’s eyes were full of incomprehension.

He could clearly feel Ye Yuan’s emotion, but just what was it that made him so full of misgivings?

“Hahaha ... So that’s how it is! Turns out that’s how it is!” Right at this time, Jian Rufeng suddenly burst into laughter, as if realizing something.

His figure already became extremely illusory and might disappear at any time.

He looked in Ye Yuan’s direction and said, “Old Friend, don’t make things difficult for him anymore! The things that he’s shouldering are what we cannot comprehend! Everyone, listen! From today onward, Ji Qingyun will be respected as a saint, titled Saint Azure! I hope that everyone will pass down his achievements and contributions forever! Everyone, remember! His contributions are far above this ancestor’s!”

Witchcloud was greatly surprised, not understanding why Jian Rufeng said so.

But he knew that Jian Rufeng definitely saw a trace of heaven’s secret on his deathbed!

Just what was it that he saw?

Who in the world was this Ji Qingyun?

Jian Rufeng looked at Ye Yuan again, his gaze already becoming different.

That look carried heavy surprise and wonder.

Jian Rufeng gave a deep bow toward Ye Yuan and said, “Many thanks for Young Friend’s help. Please accept a bow from this Jian!”

Ye Yuan naturally knew what he saw and said with a sigh, “Senior, you don’t have to be like this. Everything is foreordained by heaven!”

Jian Rufeng shook his head and said, “Heaven’s will has destiny and has variables! Heaven’s will mocks men, and don’t people affect heaven’s will? The cause and effect, probably even Heavenly Dao can’t explain it clearly, right? This Jian will be going. Young Friend carries a heavy burden and has a long road ahead. Please take care!”

Ye Yuan also bowed down and said, “Senior seeks virtue and acquires it. This junior definitely won’t let you down!”

Jian Rufeng smiled slightly, his entire person turning into a wisp of light breeze, disappearing.

And that blazing sun also gradually rose above the sky, emitting waves of terrifying undulations, completely covering up the Heavenly Hidden World’s heaven’s secrets.

Since then, two suns floated up in the sky of the Heavenly Hidden World!

Ye Yuan let out a long sigh, feeling like his body was hollowed out.

The crying gradually ceased. What replaced it was a deathly silence.

There were several hundred thousand people present, but not the slightest bit of sound was emitted.

Clearly, they were all immersed in grief, unable to extricate themselves for a long time.

No idea how long had passed either, Witchcloud heaved a long sigh and gave a bow toward Ye Yuan, and said, “Heaven’s secrets can’t be revealed, but Old Friend’s words on his deathbed, it definitely won’t be a careless remark. He thanked Young Friend Ji, and s this old man thanks you too! From today onwards, you are Saint Azure!”

As he said, Witchcloud directly knelt down toward Ye Yuan.

“This old man Witchcloud pays respect to Saint Azure!”

“Paying respect to Saint Azure!”

Everyone knelt down toward Ye Yuan, the shouting shocking the heavens.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and was somewhat melancholic as he said, “Senior’s words on his deathbed, this Ji doesn’t dare to refuse. But Senior Profound Secrets’s actions are sufficient to be conferred as a saint. This saint will posthumously canonize him as Saint Profound. Everyone doesn’t have objections, right?”

Witchcloud bowed and said, “Yes, we obey Saint Azure’s words! From today onward, you and Old Friend will be called Azure and Profound Dual Saints!”

Saint! A saint!

Men of great talent and virtue for eternity!

To get this qualification, one must be respected together by all races!

Ye Yuan looked at Witchcloud and said with a sigh, “Senior, this saint knows that you’re filled with puzzlement, but you also know this. Heaven’s secrets can’t be divulged. Some things, this saint really can’t explain it!”

Witchcloud’s expression flickered incessantly, but he nodded his head in the end.

Ye Yuan arrived in front of Little Profound Secrets, and he forced a smile as he said, “Good job! You definitely won’t be worse than your father in the future! You are also someone who has the qualification to be conferred as a saint!”

Little Profound Secrets was still young, but he already quite had the air of his father.

Hearing that, Litte Profound Secrets nodded and said, “Saint Azure, rest assured. Haoran definitely won’t let you and Father down!”

Ye Yuan smiled and arrived before Shang Hang again, and he said smilingly, “I hope that when you meet me again, you won’t be too surprised! Alright, Saint Profound has already passed away. It’s also time for this saint to leave, farewell!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan took a step out and already vanished in front of everyone.

Jian Rufeng triggered heaven’s secrets before dying, Ye Yuan had a foreboding that his time here seemed to be coming to an end.

Hence, Ye Yuan went out of the Heavenly Hidden World.

... ...

Several years later, the entire Heavenspan World was plunged into endless darkness.

A violent storm suddenly raged above the boundless and endless sea of East Billow. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A bolt of lightning tore across the sky, a figure disappeared from this spacetime.
