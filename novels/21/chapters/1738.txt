Chapter 1742 Priest Temple

Tyrant Origin Imperial City was a high-order imperial city near the Skydemon Mountain Range at the Demon God Plain.

The demon race was different from humans. Due to the many races, conflicts would frequently erupt among them.

Furthermore, some demon races were extremely intelligent, not even the slightest inferior to humans.

These demon races transformed into the appearance of humans and also established their own faces.

Hence, in the Demon God Plain, one city after another rose from the ground.

Just like the humans.

Of course, there was also a portion of extremely intelligent demon races that did not condescend to transform. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They lived in the Skydemon Mountain Range, ruling over a large number of territories, living a life of being a local despot.

Outside Tyrant Origin Imperial City’s Priest Temple, a group of young demons had excited faces.

Today was the day the Priest Temple recruited apprentices. Quite a number of young demons all gathered at the Priest Temple to take part in the test, wanting to become a priest trainee.

In the demon race, becoming a priest of the Priest Temple was a very sacred thing.

The Priest Temple was similar to the Alchemist Association but was also somewhat different.

Even if these demons could refine medicinal pills, they might not be able to become a real priest too.

Only by reaching a certain strength and getting the approval of the Priest Temple’s elders could one become a true priest.

Once become a priest, one would possess a very lofty standing in the demon race.

Even demons that had yet to take human form also would not easily offend a priest.

Because the Priest Temple was created by an extremely powerful major power of the demon race. It had a paramount status in the entire demon race.

“Saw that? That’s the priest trainee, Kong Lin, that Master Huo Rong took in the last time. I heard that he already officially became a priest last year.”

“Really envious of him! Priest apprenticeship is too hard to pass. I already took more than ten times and didn’t pass it!”

“You only took roughly over a dozen times? I already took hundreds of times and didn’t pass!”

“Heh, it’s all the same! Each trainee test, it’s already pretty good to have two people admitted. But this time, the most promising one should be Mu Yuanchun, right?”

...

Young demons were discussing animatedly, all lamenting at the difficulty of the priest trainee test.

Clearly, it was not an easy thing to become a true priest in the demon race.

The priest exam was carried out once every ten years. Not passing several dozen times, that was a thousand year’s time.

Spending a thousand years on one thing but not even reaching the entry level, it could be imagined how great the difficulty of this test was.

At this time, a figure slowly walked into the Priest Temple, immediately drawing a series of sidelong glances.

“Eh, a human! Why did a human come to the Priest Temple for?”

“He went to the registration office. Is it possible that ... he’s going to take part in the priest examination?”

“Haha, is this human a fool? How can a human possibly refine a demon divine pill?”

“A Fourth Firmament Divine Lord human was actually not beaten to death after entering the city. This is simply a miracle!”

...

This human was none other than precisely the Ye Yuan who arrived at the Demon God Plain after passing through the Skydemon Mountain Range.

Ye Yuan inquired about a relatively safe route from Duan Peng they all, and he finally passed through the Skydemon Mountain Range with only scares but no danger.

However, the Demon God Plain was far too big. Wanting to find White Light’s news was undoubtedly like finding a needle in a haystack.

He heard about the Priest Temple from Dustless there. Hence, he thought of a method, to make use of the Priest Temple’s powerful influence to search for White Light. That was why there was the scene of signing up for the priest examination currently.

“Senior, I wish to sign up for the priest examination,” Ye Yuan said to the registration old man.

That old man looked at Ye Yuan with a strange look and shook his head as he said, “How can a human participate in the Priest Temple’s assessment? Go to one side. Keep causing trouble and this old man won’t be courteous!”

Ye Yuan smiled, a vigorous but pure demonic divine essence was released.

The old man’s expression changed and he said in surprise, “How can you, a human, possibly possess such pure demonic divine essence?”

Due to physique, the demon race was greatly different from the human race’s divine essence; very easy to distinguish.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Junior has a half-demon race bloodline, so demonic divine essence is naturally not a problem.”

For Ye Yuan to be able to possess demonic divine essence, it was naturally not because he had a demon race bloodline, but because of his chaos divine essence.

The old man gave Ye Yuan a glance suspiciously and said, “In that case, you’ve lived in the human race’s territory for a long time? Demon divine pills can’t be refined by hugging Buddha’s leg at the last minute and begging for help! See them? Some people cultivated bitterly for thousands of years and also can’t refine a qualified demon divine pill. You ... best forget about it!”

The old man was responsible for enrollment, so he naturally had to ensure the initial screening too.

If any random Tom, Dick, and Harry could take part in the priest test, this test would also be too worthless.

Ye Yuan naturally saw through the old man’s concern and said with a smile,

“Senior rest assured. If I don’t pass the test, I’m willing to be punished at will by the Priest Temple!”

The old man’s face changed slightly, but he heard a cold laughter. “Heh, truly shameless boasting! With your age, even among the human race’s alchemists, you’re also considered very young, right? Demon divine pills and divine pills are two completely different kinds of pill refinement systems. Just like you also want to pass the Priest Temple’s test?”

Behind Ye Yuan, a young demon looked at him with a disdainful look. It was precisely the Mu Yuanchun everyone spoke of.

Demon divine pills and divine pills were indeed two different pill refinement systems.

It was impossible for human alchemists to refine demon divine pills.

The fiend race’s constitution was similar to the humans. So their pill refining system was also inherited from the humans and did not have much difference.

Therefore, Ye Yuan could rely on his Alchemy Dao talent when he entered the fiend race back then and rampaged in all directions, causing a stir among the fiend race’s upper echelons.

But this time, it would not work!

Even though Ye Yuan was similarly extremely proficient in demonic pills when at the Immortal Grove World.

After demons stepped into Divine Dao, their constitutions would undergo tremendous change. The refinement of demon divine pills would also naturally be totally different from when they were mortals.

Even Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove could not possibly refine demon divine pills at all because he did not have demonic divine pills.

It was also precisely because of this that Ye Yuan would come and take part in this seemingly very low-level priest trainee examination.

This time, he came completely harboring the attitude of learning.

In reality, he was totally clueless about demonic divine pills.

Of course, Ye Yuan’s horizons were no longer what ordinary alchemists could compare to long ago.

As the saying went, ‘A myriad Great Daos, all led to the same goal.’

Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao already reached the realm of seeing the essence through phenomenons.

Even though the refining system of demon divine pills was different, just in terms of pill refinement, the intrinsic nature had similarities.

Ye Yuan had confidence in being able to get a grasp on it very quickly and obtain the Priest Temple’s recognition.

Ye Yuan looked at Mu Yuanchun and said coolly, “Does pill refinement strength have anything to do with strength?”

Mu Yuanchun sneered and said, “Rubbish! Of course it’s related! Alchemy Dao strength comes from the accumulation of time! You don’t even understand such a simple truth and still want to become a temple priest? I’m suspecting now that you’re simply here to cause trouble!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Then I’ll tell you today, your understanding doesn’t work on some people!”
