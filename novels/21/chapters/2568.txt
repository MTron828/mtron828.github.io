Chapter 2574: Brought Back to Life!

During the entire night, Lin Lan became the busiest person in Green Bull Town.

Of course, he also became the most respected person.

A grade two heavenly alchemist treated these ascenders without any airs.

These people went from having skepticism at the very beginning to being very respectful later on.

“Master Lin, you’re really a miracle-working doctor! With just a few moves, most of my internal injuries have healed.”

“Master Lin, without you, don’t know how many of us will have to die this time!”

“Master Lin, you hurry up and help me look. I’ve already waited for a long time!”

Seeing these looks that worshiped him, Lin Lan felt very content.

He had once held overwhelming power and influence, being far removed from the masses and reality.

He had once gotten lost in it. Only now did he understand that people only had fear towards him, and had no respect.

But now, the ascenders here only had respect towards him and had no fear.

This feeling of being needed by people was great!

Furthermore, he increasingly felt that Ye Yuan was unfathomable.

After obtaining Ye Yuan’s guidance, his medical skills and Alchemy Dao both advanced by leaps and bounds.

Only at this time did he understand that what he was playing with in the past, was simply child’s play!

In the past, he felt that the road before his eyes was getting narrower and narrower.

But now, he felt that it was a wide path ahead!

“Squeezing for what? Squeezing for what? Where did this impudent brat come from, don’t you have any civic-mindedness? Keep squeezing, do you believe that Your Father will beat you up?” At the back, an impatient voice suddenly came over.

“This brother, can you excuse me a bit?”

Outside Lin Lan’s house, it was surrounded until not even water could seep through. Ye Yuan was unable to enter and could only notify the people in front.

Duan Tao turned his head and saw Ye Yuan, and said with a frown, “Making a row for what, don’t you see that Master Lin is currently treating someone? Want to find him to treat, go queue up at the back!”

Ye Yuan was speechless and said, “I’m not here for treatment. I’m here to find Lin Lan.”

The moment Duan Tao heard, he was even more enraged and said, “Impudent! Is Master Lin’s name what you can call? Get lost to one side! If you disturb Master Lin, Your Father will tear you to shreds!”

Duan Tao was the boss of this group of ascenders, his strength being the strongest, already reaching the grand completion of Lesser Sublime Heaven Realm.

The order here was also maintained by him.

Seeing that Ye Yuan actually wanted to enter without queuing, he was the first to be indignant.

Ye Yuan was helpless. Furthermore, he did not want to disturb Lin Lan’s treatment either, so he went to one side to wait.

Seeing that Ye Yuan was so obedient, Duan Tao smiled coldly and said, “Coward! Cutting the queue in front of your Big Brother Duan, really tired of living!”

When the rest saw that Ye Yuan was like this, they all responded with a bout of snickering.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him and found a place to stand.

This angle could just nice see the scene of Lin Lan’s treatment through the crown.

No idea how long had passed either, Lin Lan finally finished treating everyone before planning on going to find Ye Yuan.

“Master Lin came out! Quickly make way!” Duan Tao hurriedly said.

“Heh heh,?Master Lin’s methods have truly attained the acme of perfection, really a divine doctor! I represent Green Bull Town’s ascenders to express gratitude to Master Lin,” Duan Tao praised with admiration.

His words came from the bottom of his heart.

Many people were seriously injured and might have kicked the bucket if they did not receive timely treatment.

Lin Lan smiled and said, “You’re welcome!”

Duan Tao said, “Master Lin, Lord Yao said that he went to arrange the withdrawal matters, and will come and see you in a while!”

Lin Lan nodded slightly but walked outside.

As soon as he went out, he saw Ye Yuan.

Duan Tao saw Ye Yuan too and said with a frown, “Brat, why are you still here? Since you’re not injured, go to Lord Yao there to help out, he needs people there! Quickly scram!”

Finished speaking, he hurriedly explained to Lin Lan, “Master Lin, this boy wanted to jump in line just now, and was chased to one side by me …”

Duan Tao was currently talking tirelessly, but Lin Lan arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

He was just about to bow, but he heard Ye Yuan say, “Taiyuan acupoint’s technique was 30% too heavy, the divine essence of Tuigoing doesn’t have a stable enough aura, the quantity of Fragrance Stopping Grass is slightly over by five grams …”

Ye Yuan said a whole bunch in one breath. At first, everyone was a little confused.

But very soon, they discovered that what Ye Yuan said was precisely the method and dosage that Lin Lan treated the people with just now.

After Duan Tao heard, he could not help snickering as he said, “Brat, who do you think you are, to actually dare teach Master Lin?”

“A measly Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum is actually giving pointers to a grade two heavenly alchemist! Are you crazy?”

“Master Lin, you go first. Let us take care of this fool.”

… …

Very soon, a series of snickering came from all around.

A Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum was actually giving pointers to a grade two heavenly alchemist, this scene was really very comical.

However, Ye Yuan ignored them and carried on talking on his own.

Duan Tao got impatient and scolded, “Brat, Master Lin won’t haggle over it with you and you’re showing off? Are you done yet? Do you believe that Your Father will exterminate you right now?”

Duan Tao rolled his sleeves up and was about to make a move against Ye Yuan.

But at this time, Ye Yuan also just happened to finish talking.

Lin Lan gave a bow and said, “Thank you, Master, for your guidance!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Diligence can make up for your weakness, but your talent is a bit poor. Fortunately, you came to realize the truth in time. Practice more and you will be able to comprehend it.”

“Yes, Master!” Lin Lan bowed piously again.

Everyone around was completely dumbfounded.

Especially Duan Tao, he froze there very awkwardly.

“M-Master?”

“What did Master Lin call just now? D-Did I hear wrongly?”

“What a joke! Master Lin actually acknowledged a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum as his master!”

“That’s right, it must be a joke!?Huhu,?Master Lin is joking with everyone.”

… …

The crowd burst into an uproar all at once.

They were all waiting to watch Ye Yuan’s show. In the end, Lin Lan really bowed!

Lin Lan appeared extremely respectful in front of Ye Yuan.

Truly unbelievable!

But right at this time, several figures suddenly appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

The pupils of Duan Tao and the rest shrunk, looking at the arrivals with looks of amazement.

“M-Ma Liang! Du Qian! A-Aren’t you guys dead? How … How did you come back to life again?” Duan Tao said in horror.

Yao Qing led a few people and appeared.

The crowd burst into an uproar again!

Because the few people behind Yao Qing were all people who had already been confirmed dead!

Furthermore, they were all thrown into the dead people pile.

Now, they actually appeared in front of them perfectly well, how could this not be surprising?

“How is this possible, you guys are actually not dead!”

“Hang on, could it be that you all were refined into puppets by someone? Right, it must be so!”

… …

When Ma Liang heard this, he could not help saying in a great rage, “Jiang Yang you moron! You’re the one who’s refined into a puppet! F*cking hell! I was saved by Master Ye, and yet you actually cursed me to die!”

Several people arrived in front of Ye Yuan, bowed to the ground, and said, “We thank Master Ye for your grace of saving our lives. This kindness will be engraved in our hearts.”

Ye Yuan let Lin Lan come here and treat ascenders. So he naturally would not be idle himself.

He went to those who were almost dead and could not be saved, and he forcefully saved four lives from among them!

These four people were precisely Ma Liang four people!

Yao Qing looked at Ye Yuan with a shocked face. When he saw these few people earlier, he got a big scare too.

How were dead people alive again?

But only after hearing Ma Liang and the rest did he understand that it turned out, they were actually brought back to life by Ye Yuan!
