Chapter 2724: You Can’t Harness It!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On the flat road, one human and one bull were currently advancing, seemingly slow, but in reality, they were fast.

The bull was Big Yellow.

The human was naturally Ye Yuan.

When Ye Yuan left the mountain, Big Yellow took the initiative to ask to follow and serve as a mount for Ye Yuan.

Clearly, Big Yellow already determined that Ye Yuan was not someone who belonged in a shallow pond. That was why he was willing to serve as his mount.

After all, being able to create six great Saint Sovereign Heavens at the realm of Jade Sovereign Heaven, he did not even dare to imagine such a thing before.

Then what if Ye Yuan broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven in the future?

One had to know, Saint Sovereign Heaven was not the end outcome.

On the contrary, Saint Sovereign Heaven was the road to destruction instead!

Not advancing would be death!

With regards to this, Saint Exalt Bull Demon naturally did not have objections.

With Big Yellow breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, his status was already different from before.

Furthermore, he also needed Big Yellow to maintain the relationship with Ye Yuan.

Meng Frostwind did not die. He had his cultivation crippled and was tied up in the center of Heavenly South City, being spat on and cursed by everyone.

Afterward, Saint Exalt Bright Tiger announced to Heavenly South City on behalf of the All-Saint Temple that they would never invade!

Ever since then, Ye Yuan had actually already become the uncrowned king of Heavenly South City.

Regardless of whether it was Zhao Xun or the City Lord Manor, they were extremely respectful toward Ye Yuan.

One could say that he completely eradicated the two diseases in Heavenly South’s heart with his power alone.

The current Ye Yuan already arrived at True Yang Heavenly Domain, ahead lied Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

Returning to the Five Great Heavenly Regions, Ye Yuan’s plan was to make a trip back to the Heavenspan World first, and then to help Yue Mengli they all reach Heavenly Stratum.

Then he would learn more about the Pill Alliance’s exact situation and enact revenge!

It had already been a few days since he returned to Five Great Heavenly Regions. Ye Yuan heard rumors, but also felt the power of the present Pill Alliance!

The present Five Great Heavenly Regions had already fallen completely under the control of the Pill Alliance.

They had also walked to the front of the stage from behind the scenes!

Five Great Heavenly Regions, no matter how brilliant the heavenly sect in the past, they all submitted at the feet of the Pill Alliance now.

The current Pill Alliance controlled all of the Five Great Heavenly Regions’ alchemy resources.

Regardless of whether it was heavenly alchemist or heavenly medicine, it was virtually all under the control of the Pill Alliance.

For those former major sects, the Pill Alliance sent powerful heavenly alchemists to hold down the fort, naming them first seats!

The status of first seats was even above the sect masters.

It was actually equivalent to making the sect master a figurehead.

Whichever sect was insubordinate would be directly destroyed!

During these over a hundred years, there had already been several disobedient sects that had completely disappeared.

In the course of time, no one dared to resist anymore as well.

Of course, these were just the general assumptions that Ye Yuan made.

He understood that the real game of the Five Great Heavenly Regions was still between the Saint Sovereign Heavens!

This level of game was not what the average person could access.

Suddenly, a sloppy taoist dressed in gray taoist robes rode on a giant eagle and whizzed past Ye Yuan’s head.

But very soon, he turned back and landed in front of Ye Yuan.

The sloppy taoist said with a sincere look, “Little Brother, I’ll use my Purplewind Black-Pupiled Eagle to exchange for your large yellow bull, alright?”

This Purplewind Black-Pupiled Eagle’s aura was very powerful. It was actually at the realm of upper Jade Sovereign Heaven.

For this sloppy taoist to be able to subdue this level of true spirit, his strength was naturally extraordinary.

It was just that he used a Jade Sovereign Heaven eagle to exchange for a Saint Sovereign Heaven bull. It was really blind as hell.

Of course, it was also that Big Yellow restrained his aura, looking just like an ordinary large yellow bull. The sloppy taoist could not see through the actual situation at all.

But he swept with his divine sense earlier and discovered that this large yellow bull seemed to be very extraordinary. That was why he had this thought.

When the Purplewind Black-Pupiled Eagle heard the sloppy taoist’s words, it seemed to be very displeased and cried a few times.

Ye Yuan did not even look at the sloppy taoist and said coolly, “Not exchanging.”

The sloppy taoist was not annoyed either, saying with a chuckle, “I, Taoist Wu Fang, is most proficient in beast taming techniques. Little Brother, this large yellow bull is a wanton waste of God’s good gifts by following you! You using an ordinary large yellow bull to exchange for an upper Jade Sovereign heaven Purplewind Black-Pupiled Eagle is a big win!”

Only then did Ye Yuan give him a glance and said lightly, “You can’t control him.”

Taoist Wu Fang laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Little Brother, I’m not bragging, there really aren’t more than a few true spirits on this Rainclear Continent that I can’t control!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh,?“Oh,?then you give it a try?”

Taoist Wu Fang had a confident look as he said,?“Haha,

?Little Brother, I’ll let you broaden your horizons today.”

Ye Yuan got off the bull. Taoist Wu Fang had the intention of showing off too; he then recited a spell. A powerful origin divinity power suddenly bloomed.

Ye Yuan was a little surprised too. He did not expect that he could actually see such a powerful soul technique here.

But this soul technique seemed to specifically target true spirits.

Of course, this soul technique was not worth mentioning at all in front of Ye Yuan’s Divine Emergence.

“Spirit Controlling Art, go!”

Taoist Wu Fang roared loudly, firing out streams of origin divinity power, sinking into Big Yellow’s sea of consciousness.

In the beginning, Big Yellow still had his eyes open.

Taoist Wu Fang bustling around for the greater part of the day actually made Big Yellow a little sleepy.

Ye Yuan could feel that this Spirit Controlling Art was really quite powerful.

If it were an ordinary true spirit, as long as its origin divinity was not as powerful as Taoist Wu Fang’s, even if its strength was stronger than him, it would probably succumb too.

But Big Yellow was Saint Sovereign Heaven!

The origin divinity of a Saint Sovereign Heaven was completely not what a Jade Sovereign Heaven could imagine after experiencing the baptism of the power of Great Dao.

It was just that Taoist Wu Fang did not know at all. When he saw Big Yellow shut his eyes, it was exactly the same as when subduing other true spirits. He could not help being overjoyed.

What made him even happier was that this large yellow bull actually did not resist at all.

“Heh heh,?Little Brother, saw that?”

Taoist Wu Fang was pleased with himself for a while and was about to go forward and pull Big Yellow.

The moment his hand touched Big Yellow’s horn, it startled Big Yellow awake at once.

Hence, Big Yellow’s bull hooves directly kicked onto Taoist Wu Fang’s chest.

Taoist Wu Fang only felt as if a large mountain had smashed against his chest. Spurting a mouthful of fresh blood, he flew a mile away.

It was also that Big Yellow only employed the power of his physical body. Otherwise, this kick could have claimed his life.

When Ye Yuan saw it, he could not help laughing and said, “I said that you can’t control him.”

Taoist Wu Fang struggled to his feet. Looking at Big Yellow with a horrified expression, he said, “This … How is this possible? There’s actually a true spirit that can block my Spirit Controlling Art!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Alright, Big Yellow is well-behaved, but you shouldn’t bully a well-behaved bull. Otherwise, the consequences will be very severe. Let’s go.”

Taoist Wu Fang’s entire body trembled and he hurriedly mounted the Purplewind Black-Pupiled Eagle and kept pace with Ye Yuan. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Little Brother, where did you get this large yellow bull?” Taoist Wu Fang asked while vomiting blood.

“Myriad Demons Mountain,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Taoist Wu Fang’s pupils constricted and he said in surprise, “Little Brother, being able to block my Spirit Controlling Art, this large yellow bull is definitely of a chaos aberrant! In the future, its accomplishments will be immeasurable!”

Taoist Wu Fang also could not be blamed for not thinking of it. How many Saint Sovereign Heavens were there on the entire Rainclear Continent?

He definitely could not imagine that this ordinary large yellow bull in front of him was actually a Saint Exalt!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I don’t need you to tell me this.”

“Little Brother, going to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect too, right? Why don’t we go together?” Taoist Wu Fang said.

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised and said, “How did you know?”
