Chapter 1302: Pill Formed!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hong Yin, you normally never make mistakes. But today, you already slipped up quite a number of times. Did you encounter something recently? I see that you seem to be somewhat absent-minded today,” an old man said to Hong Yin.

Hong Yin had worked for the Myriad Treasure Tower for a very long time already. She had never made mistakes before.

But today, her entire person seemed to be muddle-headed. It was either counting the divine essence stones wrongly or getting the wrong things for the customer.

When the shopkeeper saw this, he could not refrain from coming up to remind.

Hong Yin said slightly apologetically: “Manager Su, really sorry. The mistakes made today, deduct from my wages!”

Manager Su shook his head and said, “I didn’t mean that. This old man sees with my own eyes when you do things normally, so why would I deduct your wages for this minor thing? I see that you keep on looking around today like you’re waiting for someone. Could it be that ... you took fancy on some family’s son?”

Hong Yin’s face flushed bright red, and she hurriedly shook her hand and said, “What’s Manager Su thinking of? I was just ... I was just somewhat curious.”

“Curious?” Manager Su wondered.

Heavenly Dao nodded her head and did not have the intention of concealing it either, narrating Ye Yuan’s unusual situation that day, and said, “Today is just nice the tenth day, wonder if he succeeded or not. Hence, I’ve been restless all along.”

Manager Su chortled with laughter when he heard and said, “Oh, Hong Yin, you’re also a veteran of the Myriad Treasure Tower already. Why would you have this kind of naive thoughts? A guy who doesn’t even have divine essence, how can he possibly refine a divine pill? You also said it, that youth was merely 30 to 40 years old. This age, one can’t even accomplish learning the rudiments in alchemy, still want to refine pills with Formation Dao? What do you take those alchemy masters in the city to be?”

Hong Yin could not help being stupefied when she heard that, only then, feeling that she seemed to really be somewhat heading down a blind alley.

Around 30 to 40 years old, he was merely a youngster in the Heavenspan World.

Just as Manager Su said, how could this age possibly refine pills with Formation Dao, and refine divine pills?

Hong Yin was currently in a daze when a suit of azure robes walked out from the inner halls.

That place was precisely the direction that led to the cultivation rooms.

Ye Yuan walked straight towards Hong Yin and opened his mouth and said, “Miss, you said before that the Myriad Treasure Tower takes in middle-grade Divine Essence Pills. I wonder if it’s still valid?”

The moment these words came out, not just Hong Yin, even Manager Su also shuddered all over, using a gaze like they had seen a ghost to look towards Ye Yuan.

“You ... You ... You really refined the Divine Essence Pill?” Hong Yin was even stammering when speaking.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course I refined it. But there’s only one. I wonder if the Myriad Treasure Tower will accept?”

Hong Yin did not answer Ye Yuan but used a strange gaze to size Ye Yuan up and down. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She wanted to find a trace of divine essence undulation from Ye Yuan.

But sadly, she was disappointed.

No divine essence!

Not even the slightest trace!

“Could it be ... Could it be that you really ...”

Hong Yin’s words did not ask finish yet and were cut off by Manager Su.

He said with Ye Yuan smilingly, “Of course! Our Myriad Treasure Tower never refuses cooperation with alchemists. As long as the Divine Essence Pill you refined meets the requirements, we’ll take them all!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and took out a gray-black medicinal pill, medicinal fragrance suffusing everywhere.

Hong Yin and Manager Su’s gaze turned intent. The quality of this Divine Essence Pill was even better than they imagined!

Middle-grade Divine Essence Pill was not without any surprises at all.

Good quality ones could come close to high-grade. Poor quality ones would also not be too far away from low-grade.

This middle-grade Divine Essence Pill that Ye Yuan took out, the quality was rather decent.

Although it was not at the level close to high-grade, compared to middle-grade Divine Essence Pills, the quality was much better.

Manager Su said, “Little Brother, our Myriad Treasure Tower is equally honest with the old and young when doing transactions. Your middle-grade Divine Essence Pill’s quality is pretty good, the selling price will be a little higher than ordinary middle-grade Divine Essence Pills. This medicinal pill, I’ll give you 28 pieces of divine essence stones.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, and he said with clasped hands, “This one should be the manager, right? Then, thank you very much! However, just give me 16 pieces of divine essence stones. That will do. I still have 3 pieces of divine essence stones here, I still want to rent another day’s cultivation room. The rest, help me exchange all of it for the Divine Essence Pill’s materials.”

The remaining three pieces of divine essence stones were naturally leftover from Ye Yuan developing the array formation.

The array formation for refining Divine Essence Pills was called Lesser Divine Essence Formation.

This was an array formation specifically created for the Divine Essence Pill. The divine essence stones that it required were not many; just eight pieces.

Ye Yuan had 67 pieces left previously. Which was also to say that he only had eight chances.

Although the Lesser Divine Essence Formation only required eight pieces of divine essence stones, the complexity of this array formation far exceeded Ye Yuan’s imagination!

Lu Linfeng’s Formation Dao could be sad to be a pinnacle existence in the Immortal Grove World.

So much so that he already deduced the Heavenly Dao belonging to him.

But those array formations were not worth mentioning at all in front of this puny little Lesser Divine Essence Formation!

The two were on completely different orders of magnitude!

An array formation piled up with a mere eight pieces of divine essence stones virtually depleted all of Ye Yuan’s mental energy.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao foundation was much more solid than Dustless imagined.

Back then, inside the Peach Blossom Formation, Ye Yuan studied the array formation and laid down a solid foundation for Divine Dao array formations, making him infer some aspect of Divine Dao array formations from a glimpse.

Under the heavy pressure, Ye Yuan erupted with limitless potential.

He deduced the array formation frenziedly. In the following 55 days, Ye Yuan pushed himself to the limits.

That sort of craziness, even Dustless was secretly dumbfounded when he saw it too, exclaiming that he was sick.

However, what surprised Dustless even more was that Ye Yuan actually just lacked a tiny bit more to enter the Selfless Realm once again!

Ye Yuan at that time already entered a kind of mysterious state. But in the end, it still fell short of success by one step.

The Selfless Realm was too difficult to enter!

But Ye Yuan was not without harvests either. It was precisely the critical state this time, that let Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao attainments advance by leaps and bounds, finally comprehending the Lesser Divine Essence Formation.

At that time, even Dustless whose eyes were at the top of his head also screamed out freak.

He totally did not expect that Ye Yuan actually really completed an impossible task in a short 100 day’s time!

Formation Dao, medicinal properties, Ye Yuan comprehended all of it. It was just missing this final step of refinement.

Logically speaking, once the Lesser Divine Essence Formation was completed, as long as one placed the spirit medicines in a suitable position inside the array formation, it would be able to automatically complete the refinement.

But Ye Yuan’s comprehension of the Lesser Divine Essence Formation was still very shallow. In the process of the pill refinement, various unexpected situations would occur.

The time still had five days remaining. Ye Yuan still had the last 27 pieces of divine essence stones remaining, which were also three refinement opportunities.

Because once the array formation activated, the energy inside the divine essence stones would be depleted, becoming barren rocks.

The first chance, Ye Yuan’s refinement failed without the least bit of surprise.

Ye Yuan spent three day’s time and consolidated the experiences of the first failure.

The second refinement, he finally succeeded!

But unfortunately, what was refined this time was merely a low-grade Divine Essence Pill.

Ye Yuan settled down and researched another day. Finally, at the last juncture, he refined this middle-grade Divine Essence Pill!

After Ye Yuan returned to the cultivation room once more, Hong Yin and Manager Su exchanged a glance, both seeing astonishment from the other party’s eyes.

“This boy’s talent is truly terrifying! Hong Yin, you continue to pay attention to him. If he needs any help, do whatever it takes! In addition, the Divine Essence Pills that he refines, purchase all of them at a high price!” Manager Su said with a slightly solemn gaze.
