Chapter 2701: Displaying Strength!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There was a little tiger behind Bright Tiger King, with a tiger head. He looked really adorable.

Judging from the aura, he was merely an upper Greater Sublime Heaven.

“Yes, so what?” Bright Tiger King said.

Ye Yuan casually threw a heavenly pill over and said coolly, “For him to eat, just take it as a greeting gift.”

Bright Tiger King caught the heavenly pill, his brows furrowing slightly.

This was just a grade two heavenly pill. However, this heavenly pill was crystal clear, pure to the extreme. He had never seen it before.

This heavenly pill was precisely a true grade Greater Sublime Creation Pill.

But Bright Tiger King hesitated. He was afraid that Ye Yuan did something to it.

Ye Yuan saw through his concerns and could not help smiling as he said, “If you don’t dare, you can find others to test it. But let me say it first. This true grade Greater Sublime Creation Pill. I only have one in hand. It’s now or never; opportunity seldom knocks twice. At that time, if it benefits your subordinate, don’t blame me for not warning you.”

Ye Yuan was not lying. The Greater Sublime Creation Pill was a very precious heavenly pill too.

Back then, he refined all of the heavenly medicines left in Heavenly South Pill Hall. There was only this one last one remaining. He was prepared to use it when he wanted to break through.

In the end, he did not expect that he directly broke through to Limitless Sublime Heaven outside of the Land of Dragon Slumber.

The little tiger said in a childish voice, “Royal Father, isn’t it just a heavenly pill? If I really die from eating it, kill him and take revenge for me!”

Looking at this little tiger, Ye Yuan could not help recalling when White Light was little.

For a moment, he actually missed him very much.

After returning to the Five Great Heavenly Regions, he had to make a trip back to the Heavenspan World first.

With his current ability, letting Li-er and the others break through to Heavenly Stratum was already not a difficult thing.

“Okay! Let you try it then!” Bright Tiger King seemed to have made up his mind and said.

The little tiger swallowed the true grade Greater Sublime Creation Pill in one gulp. His gaze suddenly turned intent, and his entire person’s aura suddenly skyrocketed!

When the five great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens saw this scene, each and every one revealed shocked expressions.

The medicinal effect of this heavenly pill was a little too strong, right?

Just as when Huang Haoyan two people broke through, the little tiger’s aura soared, directly reaching grand completion Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Following that, it rushed up towards Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

“This … Honorable Nephew doesn’t have the slightest intention to stop at all. Could it be that he’s going to directly break through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum?” Myriad Elephant King said in surprise.

He had never seen before that a heavenly pill could have such a vigorous effect.

In reality, on the entire Rainclear Continent, powerhouses who knew that true grade existed were extremely few!

If not for the Pill Alliance’s appearance, even Ye Yuan would not have been able to touch this threshold.

Therefore, the five kings’ shock could be imagined.

When the little tiger’s realm directly broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, the five people were completely dumbfounded with shock.

“What a powerful heavenly pill, to actually directly let Honorable Nephew break through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!” Wild Lion King said with shock all over his face.

The five people looked at Ye Yuan and were collectively speechless.

Bright Tiger King was concerned about his son and asked, “Shuoyan, do you feel any discomfort anywhere?”

The little tiger’s body already puffed up by one size, looking like a half-grown tiger.

He shook his head and said, “There’s no discomfort. I feel unprecedentedly good! I even feel that the medicinal effect hasn’t been used finish yet. It’s just that my foundation isn’t stable now and can’t break through anymore! This big brother, thank you!”

The five people exchanged glances, shocked to the extreme.

At this moment, they finally understood that Ye Yuan was not joking.

This guy’s methods were simply fantastical!

Ye Yuan looked at Shuoyan and said with a smile, “Don’t mention it. I already said just now, this is a greeting gift.”

Bright Tiger took a deep breath and said to Ye Yuan, “Boy, what you’re giving us is this kind of heavenly pill?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Grade four heavenly imperial pill, Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill! Presumably in my hands, as long as it’s successfully refined, the medicinal effect will be a hundred times stronger than the Sacred Destiny Pill! At that time, even if you guys don’t want to break through, it probably won’t do either!”

“Hiss?… A hundred times!” Wild Lion King drew a breath of cold air, feeling his head become somewhat dazed.

Sacred Destiny Pill, that was a grade five heavenly pill!

A grade four heavenly pill actually had a hundred times stronger medicinal effect than a grade five heavenly pill. This was simply unimaginable.

Sacred Destiny Pill was only able to increase the probability of breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

But even a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven had the possibility of failure too.

Jade Sovereign Heaven to Saint Sovereign Heaven, this step was far too difficult.

Otherwise, why were there only so scanty few who could break through to this realm out of the Rainclear Continent’s millions upon millions of life forms?

But from Ye Yuan’s mouth, Saint Sovereign Heaven became like cabbages?

“Humph!?Brat, do you really think that us true spirits don’t know alchemy and is easy to hoodwink?”

At this time, Heavenly Rat King suddenly said, “The higher the level of heavenly imperial pill, the greater the difficulty of refining! Grade four heavenly imperial pills and grade two heavenly imperial pills, the difficulty can’t be mentioned in the same breath at all! In fact, it’s even harder than grade five heavenly pills! You want to make us withdraw the troops by using an empty promise now?”

Heavenly Rat King’s words made the four people’s expressions change.

They secretly thought what a close shave, almost fell for it.

Indeed, that scene earlier was too shocking.

Got to admit, what Heavenly Rat King said made a lot of sense.

The higher the rank of a heavenly pill, the more difficult it was to refine the heavenly imperial pills.

In the entire Land of Heavenly South, only Zhao Xun and Wu Jian were able to refine heavenly imperial pills.

Furthermore, what they refined was heavenly imperial pills of the worst quality.

Wanting to refine grade four heavenly imperial pills to the level of true grade, that difficulty was simply unimaginable!

The five people all looked at Ye Yuan, their expressions being unfriendly.

Ye Yuan smiled and suddenly said in a loud voice, “Two hall masters, I’m Ye Yuan! I’m currently negotiating with the five kings right now. The two of you please come down and chat!”

This voice spread extremely far. The expressions of Zhao Xun and Wu Jian who were waiting in full battle-array on top of city walls changed drastically when they heard that.

Zhao Xun suddenly stood up and said to Wu Jian, “It’s really Ye Yuan! He came back!”

Wu Jian was wildly ecstatic as he said, “That giant mountain just now should have been released by him! He said that he’s currently negotiating with the five great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens. There wouldn’t be a trick, right?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Zhao Xun’s expression changed, but he quickly shook his head and said, “There won’t! He did not stint to risk his life for a Huang Haoyan back then and faced the entire sea army! If he was captured, even if they killed him, he wouldn’t say such a thing either!”

Wu Jian fell into thought as well and nodded slightly.

At this time, Song Tianyang also said, “I agree with Head Hall Master’s idea! Ye Yuan suddenly speaking up, he might need our help! Moreover, It was all thanks to his credit that the three of us were able to break through to half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven! If not for him, Heavenly South City would have long perished!”

Zhao Xun nodded and said, “Okay! I’ll go down with Song Tianyang. Jian, you guard the city, just in case!”

Wu Jian nodded and said, “Yes!”

Over there, the few people did not know what medicine Ye Yuan was selling in his gourd. Heavenly Rat King said in a solemn voice, “Boy, you dare to play tricks, this king will kill you now!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Five kings, relax a little. If I’m really playing any tricks, I also wouldn’t have called them out. Isn’t this sending the sheep into the tiger’s mouth? Don’t you guys agree?”

The few people exchanged glances, thinking to themselves that it was true.

Zhao Xun saw Ye Yuan and was immediately overjoyed and said, “Fine lad, you’re back! This time, if not for your guidance, it would also have been impossible for this hall master to break through to half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, and Heavenly South City would have long been destroyed!”

Song Tianyang even gave a bow to Ye Yuan and said, “Song Tianyang thanks Third Hall Master for your guidance!”

The expressions of the five kings changed, nearly biting their own tongues.
