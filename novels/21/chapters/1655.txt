Chapter 1659 Fight of Spirit Circles

“As long as one can last 100 breaths in the light circle, they can obtain the recognition of the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate and enter inside, obtaining the inheritance!”

“All get lost for me! Those who bar me, die!”

“This light circle is mine! Bang!”

...

For some time, countless fervent gazes looked towards the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate. They all hoped to enter inside and obtain the inheritance.

However, there were only merely several hundred seats. The competition was unusually fierce.

In midair, countless divine essences countless without restraint, looking incomparably gorgeous.

Horrifying powers of law undulated in the sky. Martial artists fell from time to time.

The scene was extremely tragic!

However, the truly powerful existences had not made a move yet. The ones who rushed over now were all small fries.

“Your Excellency, these guys are crazy. It’s really terrifying!” Ning Tianping said emotionally.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “This kind of lucky chance is sufficient to change one’s life to bottom-level martial artists. They naturally have to do whatever it takes.”

Ning Tianping said, “Fortunately, this Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate has a bone age limit. Otherwise, it would really have nothing to do with us anymore.”

This Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate seemed to be searching for a successor. Hence, the skeletal age was restricted to under 5000 years old.

Those over 5000 years old, even if they occupied the light circle, they would be rejected too.

With Ning Tianping’s strength, he was already an outstanding talent among those below 5000 years old. Hence, him occupying a light circle was virtually a sure thing.

Otherwise, once those middle-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouse took the field, what has it got to do with the others anymore?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s almost time, let’s go!”

Ning Tianping smiled slightly, his figure rushing out.

Ye Yuan followed closely behind and was actually not much slower than Ning Tianping.

“You all look, there’s actually an Origin Deity who wants to occupy a light ring. Is he courting death?”

“Hahaha, truly, there are all kinds of birds once a forest is big.”

“Mn? Hang on! Why can an Origin Deity Realm fly?”

“It’s really so! I got it, he must have comprehended spatial laws! My God, truly monstrous!”

“So what? Whoever prevents your father from obtaining the inheritance, your father will take his life!”

...

Ye Yuan was seriously too conspicuous among a group of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, immediately drawing people’s attention.

Under Ning Tianping’s protection, Ye Yuan directly occupied a light circle.

Then, Ning Tianping also occupied a light circle in the vicinity.

Ning Tianping’s strength was too powerful, few were his match.

“Brat, get lost for your father!”

Not long after Ye Yuan landed and occupied a light circle, a first-layered heaven Divine Lord rushed over towards Ye Yuan domineeringly.

Occupying a seat was not the end, one must be able to hold for a hundred breaths before they could obtain the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate’s recognition.

Ye Yuan laughed coldly, the Junyi Sword suddenly attacking.

Rumble!

That martial artist was directly blasted flying by Ye Yuan with one sword!

Originally, everyone felt that Ye Yuan was a soft persimmon. So they were all raring to have a go.

This sword of Ye Yuan’s stunned everyone at once, making them not dare to make a move without careful consideration.

“This spirit circle, this Ye wants it! Those who are not convinced, come and fight me!”

Ye Yuan stood upright with his long sword, unparalleled and domineering.

Even though he was just Origin Deity Realm, his aura surged to the sky, and actually gave those martial artists tremendous pressure. For a moment, no one dared to step forward.

“How can this kid be so strong?”

“An Origin Deity Realm could actually overpower a first-layered heaven Divine Lord with one sword!”

“I remembered, heard that there was an Origin Deity Realm who defeated Melody Sun Imperial City’s Young Patriarch Jing Lu a few days back! This must be him!”

...

The moment everyone heard, their expressions could not help changing greatly, revealing looks of apprehension towards Ye Yuan.

For some time, there were already quite a few people who wanted to beat a retreat and compete for other spirit circles.

“Everybody, attack! He’s only one person. I’ll see how many people he can block!” Suddenly, someone in the crowd fanned the flames.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and looked at that person.

That person was none other than precisely Jing Lu!

Those martial artists being incited by Jing Lu were indeed moved.

“An Origin Deity Realm kid also wants to occupy a spirit circle, dream on! Everybody, attack together!”

Sure enough, over a dozen first-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses actually charged over towards Ye Yuan in unison.

Occupying a spirit circle, one could not move anymore. Otherwise, precious time of occupying a spirit circle would not be counted anymore.

Therefore, every person who occupied one must have the strength that surpassed people!

Because they were all living targets!

Clearly, Ye Yuan seemed much weaker among them.

Seeing this scene, Jing Lu was very pleased with himself in his heart.

“Heh, so what if you can jump realms and battle? I don’t believe that you can fight over a dozen Divine Lord powerhouses alone! Offended this young master and you still want to obtain the inheritance? Dream on!”

Done talking, Jing Lu raised his long sword and also rushed over toward Ye Yuan.

In an instant, Ye Yuan was surrounded by enemies in all directions!

He laughed coldly and said with disdain, “Want to bully the weak with numbers? Then you all have to be prepared for death!”

Regarding Ye Yuan’s threat, they naturally did not take it to heart.

After all, Ye Yuan was just an Origin Deity Realm!

Over ten of them, they did not believe that they could not force Ye Yuan out.

Buzz!

Those dozen over people were currently arriving swiftly when suddenly, with a series of whooshes, all of them fell down from the air.

Misty Sword Art!

Ye Yuan’s sword energy came out. Those few powerhouses who rushed in front were all swept by it. Their bodies being riddled with wounds by the sword energy.

“Origin magnetic laws! My God, how can this kid’s means be so many?”

“Spatial laws, origin magnetic laws, how can this kid comprehend so many obscure laws?”

“Too strong! First-layered heaven Divine Lords are not his match at all!”

...

Ye Yuan’s methods had astounded everyone.

Under the gaze of thousands of Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, he alone swept away over a dozen people. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

First-layered heaven Divine Lord Realm powerhouses did not have the strength to retaliate at all in front of him!

This kind of strength was already considered a top powerhouse among first-layered heaven Divine Lords.

Such a person naturally had the qualifications to obtain a spot!

“Who else is still unconvinced, you can all come! This Ye will receive you all!”

Ye Yuan stood with his sword brandished, his gaze like a torch, aura imposing.

Those powerhouses finally retreated.

“Q-Quickly run! This guy ... This guy is too strong!”

The martial artists who survived stumbled and crawled away.

Jing Lu was suddenly assaulted by the Origin Magnetic Field just now and did a dog-eat-shit tumble.

Fortunately, he charged a little later and was not hit by the sword.

Otherwise, he would be a corpse right now.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s invincible figure, Jing Lu was full of fear and resentment.

How could there be such a freakish person in this world? How could someone’s talent be even greater than his?

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s gaze passed through the crowd and cast at him.

Jing Lu’s entire body turned stiff as if being hit by a paralyzing hex, not daring to move in the slightest.

The killing intent in Ye Yuan’s eyes was not disguised in the least bit. Clearly, he was genuinely enraged.

Finally, all of the powerhouses retreated. Ye Yuan’s place became a forbidden place.

Even those second-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses were not willing to come and provoke Ye Yuan too.

Not that they were afraid of Ye Yuan, but that there were soft persimmons to knead, why should they pick a hard persimmon?

All around, bloody battles happened repeatedly. Quite a number of young geniuses perished, their Dao disappearing.

But Ye Yuan stood proudly. No one dared to come up and provoke anymore.
