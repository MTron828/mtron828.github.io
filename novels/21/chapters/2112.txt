Chapter 2116: I Am Guilty!

Ye Yuan sized up the old man in front of him. The old man had white hair and the complexion of a child, giving people a feeling of being as deep as the sea.

A Heavenly Emperor, that was a figure above the heavens, the true sovereign of this world.

Although Gongyang Lie was a Heavenly Emperor too, he was a servant and lacking some domineeringness. In front of Ye Yuan, he also did not dare to really reveal the aura of a heavenly emperor.

Only the Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun in front of him was considered a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse in the true sense.

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun sized Ye Yuan up as if wanting to see through him.

His aura was extremely powerful. Of the demon race powerhouses below, there were already quite a number of people that actually knelt down.

It was just that Ye Yuan was so close to him, but was completely fine.

Swoosh!

In the crowd, a white figure suddenly shot up to the sky.

But she had not gone very far when her figure actually fell back involuntarily, as if getting backtracked.

“Uncle Zhi, what are you doing?” Long Xiaochun said to the dragon race elder beside her with an indignant look.

The old man was expressionless as he said coolly, “This is an unimportant matter that you shouldn’t poke your nose into!”

Long Xiaochun raised her dainty fists and said angrily, “How can it be an unimportant matter? Ye Yuan killed Qi Zhen; it’s equivalent to taking revenge for Big Brother Xiaohai. He’s our Dragon Clan’s friend!”

Long Xiaohai also urged by the side, “Uncle Zhi, take action and help Brother Ye!”

Long Chi was not the slightest bit moved and said coolly, “Coming out this time, this old man’s duty is to protect your safety. Although I don’t fear that Shaoyun, I’m also not willing to get involved with this trouble. The strength of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, you all are aware too. If you still dare to make trouble, I’ll tell your mother everything that happened along the way.”

This last sentence indeed had massive killing power. The Long Xiaochun who feared neither heaven nor earth seemed to have heard a desolate behemoth’s name. Her expression actually showed her being frightened until it turned pale.

It was just that the meaning in his words was that he actually did not fear heavenly emperors!

This Long Zhi was actually a dragon race heavenly emperor who concealed his strength!

“Uncle Zhi, you’re unvirtuous!” Long Xiaochun puffed her cheeks up and said with an unhappy look.

Long Zhi still said coolly, “Long Xiaochun, just the trouble that you caused along the way, if not for Uncle Zhi being around, you could have poked a hole in the sky! Have you forgotten who was wiping your buttocks behind you? You say that Uncle Zhi is unvirtuous, but Uncle Zhi won’t shoulder this blame!”

Hearing the word buttock, even Long Xiaochun’s pretty face also turned slightly red as she said huffily, “Humph! Boorish! Ignoring you!”

Done talking, Long Xiaochun turned around. But a pair of intelligent eyes were swiveling around.

Heavenly Emperor powerhouses see through everything. How could the commotion here escape Shaoyun’s eyes?

That scene of Long Zhi taking action just now landed in his eyes fully and he could not help being startled in his heart.

Dragon race heavenly emperor!

This bunch of guys would not come out to cause trouble, right?

Shaoyun originally came in a threatening manner. But if this matter had the Dragon Clan’s involvement, it would not be good.

Got to cut the Gordian knot!

Shaoyun’s mind spun lightning fast, already making a decision.

His gaze looked towards an area in the void and he said in a solemn voice, “Gongyang Lie, Ye Yuan killed my clan’s Qi Zhen. This emperor is bringing him away now, you have no objections, right?”

The demon race powerhouses were all extremely shocked. Although Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun was overbearing, the meaning in his words was actually discussing with someone.

Who could be worthy of a heavenly emperor’s deliberation?

That was surely a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

Was there still another Heavenly Emperor powerhouse here?

Gongyang Lie’s figure slowly came out and he looked at Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun and said coolly, “Lord Second Sage is willing to sacrifice himself to help all the demons in the entire city. This emperor naturally have no objections.”

“It’s another Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!”

“It’s our demon race’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!”

... ...

The crowd immediately burst into an uproar.

Gongyang Lie’s existence, only a small number of Empyrean powerhouses knew. The demons in the city were completely unaware.

Toward Ye Yuan’s action, Gongyang Lie was also very surprised.

He even thought that Ye Yuan would definitely threaten to die. Who knew that he was actually so shameless, directly surrendering without resistance.

As for whether Ye Yuan could run or not, he never considered it at all.

A mere True God Realm wanted to escape from a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse’s hands?

That was not possible!

Ye Yuan could kill Qi Zhen that day. It was entirely because he was too careless, and also because Ye Yuan’s method was too unexpected.

Who could have thought that a True God Realm could actually control the Dao mark?

Thinking up to here, a hint of regret arose in Gongyang Lie’s heart.

If he was a little more decisive back then and directly restrained Ye Yuan, there would not be so much trouble.

It was just that there was no regret medicine that could be eaten in this world.

Shaoyun nodded slightly and looked over towards Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, this emperor is asking you; do you know your crime?”

Ye Yuan laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Crime? Hahaha, I’m guilty! Of course I’m guilty!”

Shaoyun’s brows furrowed slightly. A powerful pressure suddenly enveloped Ye Yuan.

This was not realm coercion, Shaoyun was genuinely enraged.

How horrifying was the world power of a Heavenly Emperor?

“Since you know your crime, why haven’t you knelt?!”

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun glared fiercely. A cold cry reverberated throughout the entire city akin to a clap of thunder.

Everyone’s faces became fearful, looking at Ye Yuan rather sympathetically.

“A shame, Second Sage was overly conceited and insolent on account of his ability. Today, all of his dignity is going to be trampled underfoot by the Qilin Clan.”

“Heavenly Emperor Second Sage is avenging Qi Zhen here, gaining back face for the Qilin Clan! That day, Second Sage killed Qi Zhen really refreshingly. But coming out, debts have to be repaid.”

“Humph! This incident was caused by him. So now, he naturally has to bear the consequences himself! How powerful is the Qilin Clan? How can they allow humiliation?”

... ...

Quite a few people harbored the emotions of gloating over others’ misfortune to watch the show, with their words full of mockery and cynicism.

However, a breath passed, Ye Yuan was there like he was completely fine as if he did not hear it.

Two breaths!

Three breaths!

Ye Yuan still stood there and did not have the slightest intention of kneeling.

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun’s pupils constricted, his eyes full of puzzlement.

Ye Yuan looked at him with a faint smile just like that, as if he was air.

The entire city was dead silent. Everyone looked at Ye Yuan in shock, their gazes full of incredulity.

Ye Yuan could actually be perfectly safe and sound under a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse’s coercion?

“This emperor is asking you to kneel! Didn’t you hear me!?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun shouted angrily again. An even more powerful aura surged to the sky and directly crushed over towards Ye Yuan.

Clearly, Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun was already enraged.

A powerful Heavenly Emperor powerhouse actually could not do anything to a True God Realm. This was too disgraceful!

So this time, he pulled no punches.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

... ...

This time, even those Empyreans could not withstand his pressure, all spewing fresh blood wildly.

The might of a Heavenly Emperor was too strong!

But Ye Yuan still stood there calmly without any reaction at all.

Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun’s expression changed wildly. He looked at Ye Yuan with a look of astonishment, his gaze full of disbelief.

“This is not possible! Why can a mere True God Realm stand up against this emperor’s move?”

“Hahaha ... your Qilin Clan is really awe-inspiring! Shaoyun, I’m indeed guilty! But, I’m an innocent man who got into trouble because of his wealth!”

Bang!

Ye Yuan turned his palm over, the Qilin emperor bone already in his hand. A powerful pressure of bloodline power enveloped the entire heaven and earth until it made people feel suffocated.
