Chapter 3020: Heaven, Don’t Play With Me Like This!

“This … What kind of monster is this?”

“These monsters are too brutal! H-Hurry up and run!”

“Too strong! Arghhh, save me!”

No heaven-shocking big moves at all. What these bloodline warriors used was all the most primitive means of killing.

But it was also due to this that it seemed more brutal and bloody.

The blood race did not fear death, but at this time, they were scared too!

There were 800 of such bloodline warriors under Ye Yuan’s leadership. There were more than 500 who were origin powerhouses!

This kind of army, it was sufficient to sweep away everything under Hegemon Realm.

Therefore, after they joined the battle, it had nothing to do with the Heaven One army anymore.

Even if it was the blood race’s origin powerhouses, faced with these bloodline warriors, they would be taken down in a few exchanges too.

On the Heaven One army’s side, they were completely dumbfounded.

“S-So strong! Turns out that you can fight like this!”

“For so many years, our fighting with the blood race was really incomparably tragic! But only today did I discover that we’re all refined gentlemen!”

“Are these monsters all following Ye Yuan’s orders? This guy indeed created a miracle again!”

… …

Suddenly, a ferocious gaze swept over, a bloodline warrior suddenly turned around and pounced toward him.

That Heaven One martial artist pissed his pants with fright, not knowing why the other party would target him.

Being stared at by the other party, he felt like he had died.

He did not know that the word ‘monster’ had triggered the other party.

“Roar!”

Jiang Zhennan gave an angry roar. Only then did that bloodline warrior stop and turn to charge toward the blood race.

Actually, they did not need to be commanded at all.

These bloodline warriors all had an innate hatred for the blood race.

Furthermore, they were born fighting machines that did not know fatigue at all.

Want to really talk about combat strength, they were more than ten times that of same rank powerhouses!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Ye Yuan casually threw out a few heavenly pills and said, “Hurry up and recover!”

Yang Qing and the rest directly swallowed it without hesitation.

“Humph!?You traitor, do you think that by doing so, you can redeem yourself?” Qin Shan crushed Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill and said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then, how do I prove that I’m not a traitor?”

Qin Shan sneered and said, “Unless you can eradicate the blood race! Otherwise, you have no way of proving at all!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head with a smile and said, “Okay!”

Qin Shan was taken aback. Clearly, he did not expect Ye Yuan to agree so simply.

“Hur hur,?you wouldn’t think that by bringing these monsters back, you’ll be able to eradicate the blood race, right?” Qin Shan smiled coldly and said.

“Roar!”

Before his voice faded, an angry roar came from the horizon.

Qin Shan’s pupils constricted. He saw an incredible scene.

A monster tore a blood race Hegemon to shreds with its bare hands!

“H-How can this monster be so strong?” Qin Shan’s complexion was somewhat pale, his body trembling a little. No idea it was because he was too heavily injured, or because he was intimidated.

But, this scene of tearing a Hegemon to pieces with its bare hands, it was still too shocking.

The battle of Hegemons had always been incomparably deadlocked.

Even if your strength was stronger than the other party, wanting to finish off the opponent was very difficult too.

But this scene completely subverted their understanding!

When Feng Xiaotian saw this scene, he was likewise unbelievably shocked.

Originally, he was already prepared to die. Who knew that someone threw a wrench in the works.

This monster killed until Bloodpromise three people threw away their helmets and coat of mails. This monster finished off one of the other side’s hegemons in a few exchanges.

However, that blood race Hegemon recovered again very quickly.

But the unfortunate thing was that Zhao Yue seemed to take delight in shredding his opponent to pieces without getting tired of it.

Once the other party recovered, he immediately rushed up and tore the opponent apart again.

Bloodpromise, this bloodkin, the blood on his face was gone, deathly pale.

Flee!

At this time, he only had this one thought.

Without the slightest hesitation, he turned around and ran.

He could not remember clearly how many times he had run away already.

However, no matter what, it was still his little life that was important.

“Argh!?Ye Yuan, are you sent by heaven to punish this seat? How many times? How many times has this been? Why is it always like this every time! Heaven, don’t play with me like this!” Bloodpromise’s chest was virtually about to explode.

He had always viewed Feng Xiaotian as his lifelong enemy. But who knew that ever since Ye Yuan came soaring into existence, he had been thrashed over and over again.

Each time, he would drop everything and run!

It was great that Heaven One finally managed to have internal strife, chasing Ye Yuan away.

Who knew that this guy would come back again!

If he came back, then he came back. But he even brought this group of violent monsters. How did he want people to live?

He did not dare to imagine what kind of interrogation he would have to face after going back.

He could not resist turning his head to take a look. Fortunately, Zhao Yue chased after someone else.

Finally managed to preserve his little life!

Amidst everyone’s astonished gazes, Zhao Yue killed the two great Hegemons more than ten times over. Finally, they were not unable to revive anymore.

Then, he wagged his tail and flew to Ye Yuan’s side, squatting at one side docilely.

From time to time, he even used his monster head to rub against Ye Yuan, like he was fawning on him.

It was just like the one who tore the Hegemons apart with his bare hands earlier was not him.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and rubbed the top of his head a few times, expressing approval.

Then, Zhao Yue roared twice very ‘happily.’

When Qin Shan saw this scene, his eyeballs popped out!

Such a brutal monster was actually squatting next to Ye Yuan like a puppy?

“Y-Ye Yuan, w-what kind of monster is he?” Qin Shan could not resist asking.

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue roared, nearly shattering Qin Shan’s internal organs.

Ye Yuan said, “He’s called Zhao Yue. Don’t call him a monster. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not being able to save you.”

Qin Shan swallowed his saliva, feeling like he had gone to the gates of hell and back.

“Then, can it prove my innocence now?” Ye Yuan asked with a smile.

Qin Shan’s expression changed, and he snorted coldly and stopped talking.

Actually, the suspicions in his heart were already mostly gone.

Hegemon Realms were not expendable to the blood race either.

Two Hegemons falling at once, it was a huge loss to the blood race too.

Now, the Heaven One alliance was already at death’s door. If Ye Yuan really turned traitor, there was no need to do so at all.

As long as this monster army that he brought stood on the blood race’s side, none of them could think about running away.

But, to make him put aside his ego to apologize to Ye Yuan, he was incredibly unwilling.

Therefore, he simply stopped talking.

Ye Yuan just smiled and threw another heavenly pill to him.

This time, Qin Shan did not refuse, directly swallowing it in one gulp.

Ugh?… Ye Yuan’s healing heavenly pills were better than his!

“Ye Yuan, you finally came back! It’s really great!” At this time, Feng Xiaotian came over too. Although the injuries on his body were extremely severe, he did not care at all. Instead, he was very happy when he saw Ye Yuan.

He and Ye Yuan were considered life-and-death friends too. He never doubted Ye Yuan at all.

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said with a smile, “I haven’t congratulated Brother Feng for becoming Hegemon Battlesky yet!”

Feng Xiaotian laughed loudly and said, “You brat, deliberately poking fun at me, is it? This brother that you brought can tear me apart with one hand!”

He heard the words just now too. So he was very careful with his words.

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue roared loudly, clearly very pleased with himself.
