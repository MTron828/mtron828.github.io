“It’s great, Big Brother Ye Yuan! They didn’t chase after us!”

When Shuoyan saw that the Purplelight Battle Wolf they all did not chase after, he could not help being overjoyed.

But Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “Silly boy, we must have stepped into a forbidden land in an accident arising from many causes. That’s why they didn’t dare to chase after! You take a closer look, what is this place?”

Shuoyan was startled when he heard that and hurriedly sized the surroundings up.

The moment he looked, he could not help getting a shock.

“I completely can’t recognize the terrain here! Could it be that … we barged into the territory of the Saint Exalt?”

Saint Exalt was the honorific title for Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

“Saint Exalt? Even if it’s the territory of a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, they wouldn’t need to be fearful to such an extent either, right?” Ye Yuan said in puzzlement.

“Big Brother, you aren’t aware, the territory of the Saint Exalt can’t be trespassed without permission! Once discovered, not only do they have to be sentenced to death, the faction that they came from would also be destroyed!” Shuoyan’s expression changed as he said.

When Ye Yuan heard this, he also frowned and said, “So overbearing? It’s merely Saint Sovereign Heaven, that’s all. Is there a need to be so domineering?”

“No way, Big Brother, we can’t go any deeper in! Once discovered, not only do we have to die, Royal Father will suffer a cataclysmic disaster too!”

As he said, Shuoyan pulled Ye Yuan and ran out.

But Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “It’s too late. We’ve already been discovered!”

Shuoyan’s expression changed, only to see a figure slowly walk out of the forest.

This was an old yellow bull, his breathing being as steady as a mountain. He was actually a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven expert!

The old yellow bull looked at the two people silently and opened his mouth and said lightly, “Trespassing the Saint Exalt’s territory, the two of you can kill yourselves to atone for your crime.”

That tone did not leave any room for negotiation at all.

“Let’s go!”

Ye Yuan shouted coldly and forcefully mustered up a burst of divine essence, bringing Shuoyan and whirled away.

Sitting passively to await destruction was not Ye Yuan’s character.

The old yellow bull gave a cold snort and said, “Refusing a toast only to drink to a forfeit!”

Finished talking, he stepped out, his figure disappearing in an instant.

Ye Yuan only felt a burst of heart palpitations, the terrifying pressure crushing him until he could not breathe.

This old yellow bull’s strength was too terrifying!

Just as the two thought that they were certain to die, this terrifying pressure suddenly disappeared.

It came fast and also left quickly!

But the old yellow bull already blocked their way.

The old yellow bull said coolly, “The two of you, follow me.”

Ye Yuan two people exchanged glances, uncertain what it meant.

However, they finally squeaked by with their lives.

Letting out a sigh of relief, Ye Yuan was almost fainting. He did not even have the strength to walk anymore and could only be carried by Shuoyan.

Ye Yuan took a heavenly pill out to eat and his injuries were recovering rapidly.

When the old yellow bull saw Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill, a hint of surprise flashed across in his eyes.

The old yellow bull said, “This heavenly pill … seems to be a little different.”

Ye Yuan closed his eyes to refine the heavenly pill and could not be bothered to pay attention to him at all.

He almost died in this old guy’s hands just now, Ye Yuan was not in such a good mood.

Getting rebuffed, the old yellow bull seemed to be somewhat embarrassed too.

However, when he saw the speed of Ye Yuan’s injuries recovering, he was incomparably shocked in his heart.

This heavenly pill was too impressive!

Not long ago, Ye Yuan was still on the verge of death, looking like he might die at any time.

Just how long did it take, he was actually alive and well already!

If one had such a heavenly pill in their hands, then their ability to continue fighting could simply be rated as terrifying!

While riding a tiger’s back, Ye Yuan’s aura grew stronger and stronger as his injuries healed.

Before this, Ye Yuan was already at grand completion lower Limitless Sublime Heaven.

The energy of the dragon heart pouring into his body this time was a great supplement to Ye Yuan.

Therefore, a break through also came naturally.

The old yellow bull looked at Ye Yuan and could not help being somewhat speechless.

… …

The old yellow bull led the two people and arrived at a deep and quiet cave entrance.

The old yellow bull warned Ye Yuan, “This place is the resting place of Lord Saint Exalt. You wait here, don’t run around randomly. Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself!”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to care about him and walked straight to a large rock and closed his eyes to rest.

The old yellow bull could not help snorting coldly when he saw the situation and said, “Ignorant human!”

After the two people entered, Ye Yuan called out to Mi Tian in his heart, but the other party never replied the entire time.

He felt that the aura of the dragon heart seemed to have wilted, and could not help giving rise to a foreboding premonition.

Looks like taking action this time cost Mi Tian a huge expenditure.

Ye Yuan felt a lot of guilt toward Mi Tian too.

He originally wanted to inquire what the chaos true spirit bloodline was. It seemed like there was no hope now.

Ye Yuan was not worried about Shuoyan. He guessed that this Saint Sovereign Heaven suddenly stopping the old yellow bull, it was likely because he discovered that Ye Yuan’s bloodline was extraordinary.

With nothing to do, Ye Yuan suddenly remembered the martial technique that Mi Tian used when he killed the Eight-spotted Leopard and could not help feeling energetic.

This Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist, the power was fearsome to the extreme.

Ye Yuan believed that if he learned it, even if he did not utilize the Heavenspan Mountain, it would also be sufficient to rarely find a match within Limitless Sublime Heaven!

To execute this move, Mi Tian borrowed Ye Yuan’s body to unleash it. Ye Yuan had clearly felt the revolution of dragon qi before.

However, the operation of this martial technique was very mysterious and complicated, the difficulty immensely high.

Ye Yuan started running the dragon qi according to the feeling in his body.

Slamming a punch out!

Bang!

There was no power at all.

In fact, even a tree in front only just swayed slightly too.

Felt it before did not mean that he could execute it.

This kind of mysterious martial technique could be understood, but it could not be expressed with words.

A terrifying martial technique that could jump a major realm to kill the enemy was even more formidable than Great Dao Transformation, how could it be easily mastered?

“When Senior Mi Tian utilized the martial technique, he was able to bring down the power of Great Dao. Actually, it achieved the same wondrous effect with different means as Great Dao Transformation. But when I revolved true dragon power, why am I unable to feel the power of Great Dao in the slightest?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Although the cultivation method of humans and true spirits was different, they arrived at the same destination via different means.

Humans relied on their comprehensions to understand the power of rules.

While true spirits sensed Great Dao rule through their own bloodline.

The dragon race was born in chaos, their bloodline power extremely powerful. Feeling the power of Great Dao was naturally also extraordinary.

But it was also precisely because of this that this response was even harder.

Ye Yuan practiced over and over again, the utilization method of the martial technique became more and more familiarized. But he was unable to find the crux from start to end.

However, he was not discouraged. This degree of setback was nothing to him at all.

And right at this time, the old yellow bull slowly walked into the cave by himself.

He looked at Ye Yuan and revealed a disdainful look as he said, “It turns out that you’re even a dragonblood martial artist. It’s just a pity that you try to emulate something beyond one’s ability, and then you fell flat on your face! The martial technique is a good martial technique. It’s just that sadly, you’re unable to unleash the true power. True dragons are born from chaos and are the darling of Heavenly Dao. How can they be what you, a human, can imitate?”

Ye Yuan ignored the old yellow bull, but a bolt of lightning suddenly flashed past in his mind!

The old yellow bull gave a cold snort and said, “Conceited and ignorant human, you probably can’t even know your end yet, right? Lord Saint Exalt said that humans shouldn’t appear on the Myriad Demons Mountain, specially making me send you on your way!”

The old yellow bull was extremely strong. If he made a move against Ye Yuan, Ye Yuan did not have the possibility of survival at all.

Ye Yuan still did not pay attention to him.. Furthermore, his eyes became brighter and brighter.
