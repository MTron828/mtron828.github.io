Chapter 1649 Causing a Sensation

Everyone left a clear space for Su Ting, letting her refine the medicinal pill.

Su Ting did not harbor much hope. Void spirit divine-grade pills were not cabbages, able to be bought wholesale casually.

If Ye Yuan said that he only had a void spirit divine-grade Vast Essence Pill, it would be somewhat believable.

But Ye Yuan’s meaning was clearly that his medicinal pills were all void spirit divine pills. This was a little too nonsensical.

“This kid is really calm enough. They are already about to test the pill and he’s still so calm.”

“Haha, it’s not over until it’s over!”

“I remember more than ten years ago, someone selling fake medicinal pills in the Heavenly Network Gathering was exposed. Later, that person was directly beaten to a cripple by the three great factions.”

“This kid has some strength, but compared to the three great factions, it’s still too far off.”

...

The surrounding martial artists were all waiting to see the joke. This matter today was stirred up so big that there was probably no way to resolve it anymore. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Heavenly Network Gathering was a trading venue renown far and wide, the three major factions still cherished their reputation more.

One discovered that someone was swindling, they would deal a ruthless blow.

Firstly, it could establish awe. Secondly, it could rectify their name.

Once the seal opened, a thick medicinal fragrance instantly swept throughout the whole place.

“What a thick medicinal fragrance!”

“What a terrifying medicinal strength!”

“This Vast Essence Pill would really be void spirit divine-grade, right?”

...

Everyone’s faces suddenly changed. The higher the quality of the medicinal pill, the thicker the medicinal fragrance, and the stronger the medicinal strength that effused.

This Vast Essence Pill in Su Ting’s hand was clearly extraordinary.

“What’s all the fuss about! Medicinal fragrance and medicinal strength can all be faked. The true quality of a medicinal pill still needs after refining before one can know!” Although Zhao Jian was alarmed in his heart, he still remained stubborn.

But what he said was also right, if not a medicinal pill refined on the spot, these things could indeed be falsified.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “Hurry up and refine it. The longer you delay, the more severe the medicinal strength’s dissipation.”

Su Ting was also slightly shocked in her heart, hurriedly stuffing the medicinal pill into her mouth.

A surge of incredible medicinal strength instantly exploded in Su Ting’s mouth and abdomen.

The horrifying divine essence scoured her four limbs and bones like tidewaters, making her have a feeling of suddenly feeling refreshed.

Su Ting felt like every pore in her body seemed to have loosened up.

Rumble!

The bottleneck of late-stage Origin Deity Realm was naturally burst through by this surge of medicinal strength.

“What a powerful divine essence undulation! She’s about to break through!”

“What a terrifying medicinal strength! Is ... Is this void spirit divine-grade?”

“One Vast Essence Pill and she can break through to the late-stage Origin Deity Realm, this ... this one billion divine essence stones was spent too worthwhile!”

...

Cries of exclamations sounded out everywhere.

Vast Essence Pill was just a medicinal pill that increased divine essence and did not have the effect of breaking through bottlenecks.

To Su Ting, swallowing another 100 or even 1000 ordinary Vast Essence Pills, and it was also impossible to burst through the bottleneck easily.

But the medicinal effect of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill was too strong. Plus, Su Ting was originally stuck at the bottleneck. Under the stimulation of the powerful medicinal effect, that was how she burst through the bottleneck in one go!

The spiritual energy in the Heavenly Network Gathering surged and condensed over, alarming even more martial artists.

Breaking through at Heavenly Network Gathering, this kind of place, was a very rare phenomenon. Everyone all wanted to know what happened.

Therefore, the martial artists at the peripherals gathered one after another in the direction where the spiritual energy concentrated.

The stream of people at the originally extremely remote last-rank stalls became more and more.

Very soon, it was packed until not even water could seep through.

But the more it was like this, the greater everyone’s curiosity.

Those who could not squeeze in were all inquiring one after another, wanting to know what happened inside.

All of a sudden, the entire Heavenly Network Gathering became a mess.

The abnormality at this side finally startled the three great factions.

The Heavenly Network Gathering had existed for God knows how many years already, such a thing that never happened before.

The three great factions were afraid of a mutiny happening and made a response very quickly, sending out powerhouses to hold down the fort one after another.

“Don’t squeeze inside anymore! Keep squeezing inside and it’s tantamount to causing trouble! Offenders will be killed without mercy!”

A sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses shouted at the top of voice, releasing a powerful realm suppression, finally making those people somewhat loosen up.

Finally, under the suppression of the three great factions’ powerhouses, the martial artists at the peripherals were finally dispersed.

But the last-rank stalls place was still surrounded until not even a drop of water could trickle through.

Su Ting slowly opened her eyes, her eyes flashing with rays of brilliant light, feeling like she had inexhaustible energy to vent.

She knew that the medicinal pill’s medicinal effect was not completely refined.

Su Ting only wanted to find a place to enter seclusion as soon as possible and refine the medicinal strength as quickly as possible.

Zhao Jian looked at Su Ting with blank eyes, already shocked until he could not be more shocked.

“L-Little Junior Sister?” Zhao Jian said stammeringly.

Su Ting sucked in a deep breath and slowly said, “That’s right, it’s a genuine void spirit divine pill!”

Murmur!

The surrounding martial artists thoroughly exploded!

Even though everyone already had an answer in their hearts, hearing Su Ting say it personally, that was another matter altogether.

“It’s really a void spirit divine pill!”

“My God, I have lived for so long and have yet to see before a void spirit divine pill!”

“A Vast Essence Pill and she could breakthrough to late-stage Origin Deity Realm, it’s indeed well-deserving of being a void spirit divine pill!”

...

Su Ting slowly got up and said to Ye Yuan with cupped fists, “Master, just now, the two of us brother and sister have offended greatly, please be magnanimous enough to forgive!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “No worries.”

Ye Yuan knew that void spirit divine pills were very hard to believe, therefore, their reactions were within expectations. He naturally would not mind.

Su Ting said, “May I ask Master, are the medicinal pills in your hands all void spirit divine-grade?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Pretty much. There are some that the grade isn’t high, but anyone wants them, it can be a little cheaper. 50 million a pill.”

“...”

Everyone was speechless, this not high grade ... was referring to divine-grade, right?

There was no way a heaven-grade medicinal pill could sell for 50 million!

But this was not the most important thing, the most important thing was that the medicinal pills in Ye Yuan’s hands were ... all void spirit divine pills!”

This was terrifying!

“Master, I also want a Vast Essence Pill! Here are one billion divine essence stones!”

“Master, I have 500 million here, I want a Flying Spirit Pill!”

“Master, I have 700 million here! I want a Heavenly Treasure Whitemoon Pill!”

...

In practically an instant, Zhao Jian and Su Ting were engulfed.

At this time, who still cared about what Sword Star Alliance? Buying a void spirit divine pill was the most important thing!

Ye Yuan suddenly discovered that in front of him were all hands, he could not see anything at all.

Those hands were all holding storage rings. Inside those storage rings were all glistening divine essence stones!

Among them, there were even quite a number of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses.

No matter whether itinerant cultivators or martial artists with factions, who did not have a junior?

One billion divine essence stones and they could buy a rank three void spirit divine pill, miss this chance and it would not come again!

“Enough!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan mustered up divine essence, his voice akin to rolling thunder, overwhelming everyone all of a sudden.

Only after seeing everyone became quiet did Ye Yuan say, “Want to buy medicinal pills, line up first! You all like this, I won’t sell a single one!”
