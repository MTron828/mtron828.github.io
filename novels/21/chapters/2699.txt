“Big Brother Ye Ye Yuan, I came to say goodbye to you!” Shuoyan had an eager look as he said to Ye Yuan.

In a short one year, Shuoyan already broke through to middle Limitless Sublime Heaven under Ye Yuan’s help.

The hunt was near at hand, Shuoyan came to bid farewell to Ye Yuan.

The so-called hunt was actually opening up land and occupying even more territory.

And this required fierce killing to achieve.

Ye Yuan was rather surprised and asked curiously, “Where are you going?”

Shuoyan explained, but Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed together and said, “You mean, there are no Jade Sovereign Heaven guards?”

Shuoyan smiled and said, “Royal Father is tempering us. If we bring Jade Sovereign Heavens, what meaning of tempering is there still?”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Have you met your elder brothers during this one year? What reaction did they have toward your vast improvement in strength?”

Speaking of this, Shuoyan smiled and said, “Of course I met them! Speaking of which, it was coincidental too, they are all in their own territories. In the past, it’s hard for me to meet two or three elder brothers in a year. This year, I actually met all of them. Furthermore, they are all very happy about my vast improvement in strength and even encouraged me to work hard and not to disgrace Royal Father’s face!”

Looking at Shuoyan’s appearance, Ye Yuan knew that he did not take his words to heart.

Although his strength already reached middle Limitless Sublime Heaven, his mind was actually not old.

Shuoyan’s age was roughly the same as Jingfei. His mind was still immature.

He even thought that his brothers were all kind and loved each other!

The more his older brothers appeared to not care, the more it meant that they cared.

Furthermore, Shuoyan met nine older brothers all of a sudden. This was a very strange thing in itself.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “It just so happens that I’m going out to find a few heavenly medicines, I’ll go together with you then.”

But when Shuoyan heard that, he hesitated and said, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, you’re too powerful! I’m merely dealing with an upper Limitless Sublime Heaven’s territory on this expedition. If you want to go, sure, but you can’t take action!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t you worry. I won’t hinder your trial. I’m just going to look for heavenly medicines, I won’t care about other things.”

Shuoyan was overjoyed and said, “Alright then, with Big Brother Ye Yuan accompanying me, Shuoyan won’t be too bored either.”

… …

Bright Tiger King did not stop Ye Yuan’s request.

The place that Shuoyan was going to attack was merely an upper Limitless Sublime Heaven’s territory. It was not considered dangerous.

Ye Yuan was restricted by the vow, it was also impossible to run out of sight, so he felt very relieved.

Bright Tiger King also knew that Ye Yuan had a good impression of Shuoyan.

In reality, Shuoyan was also his favorite among his ten sons.

In terms of talent, in terms of bloodline, the other nine sons were not as good as Shuoyan.

Let alone that he already left people far behind in the dust under Ye Yuan’s divine aid.

Letting Ye Yuan and Shuoyan get closer to each other was pretty good too.

Without words along the way, Shuoyan led a large group of true spirit army and killed their way to Three Saint Ridge in a mighty contingent.

The so-called Three Saint Ridge was actually three Blackthorn Boars gilding gold onto their faces.

Myriad Demons Mountain’s fighting did not have much strategy to talk about.

I came openly to snatch your territory.

When Boss Hei Fang saw the childish-looking Shuoyan, he could not help laughing as he said, “You little kitty, hair isn’t even fully grown yet and you actually dare to come to our Three Saint Ridge?”

The moment these words came out, Three Saint Ridge side burst into laughter.

Although Shuoyan had grown quite a bit, his childishness had yet to shed. He did indeed look like an adolescent cat.

When Shuoyan heard that, he said in a great rage, “Three black pigs dare to be insolent too! Little ones, kill for me!”

Hei Fang laughed loudly and said, “Kitty, I know that you’re formidable. But your opponent today isn’t me, Hei Fang!”

As he said, he whistled.

Rumble?…

Groups of true spirits rushed out of the forest. The army that Shuoyan brought fell into heavy encirclement almost instantly! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

All around, they were surrounded until not even water could seep through!

When Shuoyan saw the situation, his expression could not help changing greatly.

“Chunhe Mountain’s Black Scorpion, Purplecloud Mountain’s Purpledawn Beast, and Upper Ridge’s Golden Fur Hound … why did they all come?” Shuoyan said in astonishment.

Each of these true spirits was an overlord of a region. Some had even reached grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum already!

The army that Shuoyan brought fell into a deathtrap at once!

“Huhu,?little bastard, there’s also the two of us!” Two figures flew over the hill.

When Shuoyan saw them, he revealed an even more horrified expression.

“Golden Eagle Dual Fiends! Why … Why are you guys here too?” Shuoyan said in terror.

These Golden Eagle Dual Fiends were twin brothers. Their strengths were both Jade Sovereign Heaven!

Their appearance practically sentenced Shuoyan to death.

By the side, Ye Yuan said very calmly, “Still don’t understand? Your whereabouts have already been leaked by someone.”

Shuoyan looked towards Ye Yuan in surprise and shook his head and said, “This is impossible! Those who know about the hunt’s whereabouts are all Royal Father’s confidants. It’s absolutely impossible to divulge my whereabouts!”

Ye Yuan rubbed his head and said with a smile, “Little guy, this world isn’t as simple as you think. Maybe they won’t betray your royal father, but there isn’t any psychological burden in betraying you.”

Shuoyan was taken aback and said, “Why?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Because you blocked other people’s way! Still remember what I said before? Two tigers cannot share one mountain! Let alone that there are ten sons under your royal father?”

Shuoyan was akin to being struck by lightning, disbelief written all over his face.

But he was not a fool, everything before his eyes could only mean that Three Saint Ridge was long prepared!

This place was another half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven’s territory. As long as they prepared in advance, they could naturally transfer powerhouses over.

Let alone that the one who came this time was Bright Tiger King’s youngest son?

“Mn??Why is there a human? What you said is right. Someone did indeed inform us about it! Being able to kill Bright Tiger King’s youngest son this time, the two of us brothers will have rendered great contributions!” Golden Eagle Dual Fiends said with a loud laugh.

Shuoyan still did not quite believe it previously. But now, it was not up to him to not believe it anymore.

At this moment, he finally understood that he was too pure!

He suddenly turned towards Ye Yuan and said emotionally, “So, Big Brother Ye Yuan you didn’t come together with me to search for whatever heavenly medicines at all? You’re doing it in order to protect me?”

At this time, the gratitude in Shuoyan’s heart could not be described using words.

Very clearly, Ye Yuan had long anticipated the danger this time, but he was willing to take the risk and accompany him.

He really could not repay this kindness.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “If I don’t let you see it with your own eyes, you probably won’t believe it.”

“Haha,?a mere lower Limitless Sublime Heaven, his cultivation is not even as good as yours, can he protect you? A lowly human, really reckless and blind!” Golden Eagle Dual Fiends said with a loud laugh.

Shuoyan prostrated toward Ye Yuan and shed tears as he said, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, from now on, I, Shuoyan, only have one big brother, that’s you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Alright, leave those two golden eagles to me. There’s no problem leaving the others to you, right?”

Shuoyan nodded his head fiercely and said, “No problem!”
