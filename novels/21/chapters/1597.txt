1601 Fervent Self-confidence

Looking at the heartbroken Ning Siyu, Xuan Yu also did not know what to say.

He sighed slightly and said, “This was the path that he chose, nobody can change it. Sigh, before leaving, he entrusted me to take good care of his dear ones. We can only put in what meager effort we can.”

Entering the spatial inheritance in time, Ye Yuan did not bring Li-er they all inside.

After all, the journey this time was very perilous. If he was trapped inside the chaotic space, no matter how many divine essence stones Ye Yuan had, it could not support the necessary expenditure.

Without divine essence stones to provide spiritual energy, the Purple Extreme Hall was also just a metal lump.

At this time, Lu Yi suddenly came in and said to Xuan Yu with a bow, “Master, Head Elder that side gave notice to have you go and take part in the elders meeting.”

Xuan Yu’s face fell and he said with a cold snort, “Came so fast! He can’t even wait for a moment?”

Lu Yi also had a solemn expression as he said, “Master, even though the time we know Elder Ye wasn’t long, he had tremendous grace toward our lineage. We ...”

Xuan Yu gave a cold snort and said, “You rascal, could it be that in your heart, your master is that sort of person who repays kindness with ingratitude?”

Lu Yi was a little embarrassed as he smiled. Xuan Yu slowly got up and went to the Elders Hall.

...

Ruo Xu glanced at Xuan Yu and said with a grim look, “Even though this old man once had some unpleasantness with Elder Ye, I still held his strength with great respect! Originally, Elder Ye would become our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s pillar of society, but he perished inside the spatial inheritance. This old man feels deeply aggrieved!”

Ruo Xu had an appearance of shedding crocodile tears. Those present naturally would not think that having an elders meeting was in order to mourn over Ye Yuan.

Sure enough, his face fell and he said to Xuan Yu, “Second Elder, this matter, you have an inescapable responsibility! Your personal relationship with Elder Ye is considered the best. You clearly know that the spatial inheritance is very dangerous. Why didn’t you stop him?”

Actually, Xuan Yu also condemned himself greatly in his heart.

He heaved a sigh and said with a nod, “What Head Elder said is right. This matter, I indeed have a responsibility. If my attitude back then could be a little firmer, perhaps Elder Ye wouldn’t have entered inside.”

Ruo Xu snorted coldly and said, “What’s the use of saying this now? Since you have no objections towards this, then I propose for you to forfeit 10 years of all resources enjoyed, do you have objections?”

The muscles on Xuan Yu’s face twitched, but he said nothing and directly left.

Head Elder looked at Xuan Yu’s back, the corners of his mouth revealing a smug smile.

...

On this day, Lin Dong brought a group of people and came to the Ye Manor.

He came today to chase Li-er they all out.

Ye Yuan already died. So Head Elder could not wait to erase all of Ye Yuan’s sense of being.

“Steward Long, we meet again,” Lin Dong looked at Long Zhan and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Long Zhan snorted coldly and said, “You look pleased with yourself huh!”

Lin Dong smiled indifferently and said, “Could it be that I shouldn’t be pleased with myself? Not long ago, you were still lecturing me here. But now, you all don’t even have a place to stay anymore. Looking at it now, it seems like my choice back then wasn’t wrong.”

Long Zhan’s expression flickered incessantly, but White Light by the side could not watch on anymore and said with a cold snort, “Lin Dong, let me tell you, Big Brother won’t die! When he comes back, all of you will tremble!”

Lin Dong laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Haha, looking at your expressions, seems like you all don’t think that Ye Yuan would die! You guys are really fervently self-confident. The Martial Tower’s spatial inheritance, those who entered has never come out before! You actually tell me that Ye Yuan will come back? It’s really killing me!”

Li-er gave Lin Dong a glance and said coolly, “Other people not coming out doesn’t mean that Big Brother Yuan won’t come out! If you don’t believe it, let’s wait and see!”

Lin Dong felt that this group of people was simply impervious to reason. He originally wanted to come and reprove them well, who knew that this bunch of fellows completely did not believe that Ye Yuan already died. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

His face fell and he said with a cold snort, “The few of you, don’t think that with Second Elder protecting you guys, you can be high and mighty like before! Let this protector tell you this. Without Ye Yuan, you all are just a bunch of ants! Before long, your corpses might be strewn on the streets! Now, get lost for me!”

White Light still wanted to say something, but he was held back by Li-er who said indifferently, “Let’s go!”

...

“Kid, don’t waste your effort anymore! You’ll eventually mess yourself to death one day like this,” Coldfeather looked at the Ye Yuan covered with cuts and bruises and said coolly.

Not that he did not want to go out, but that it was seriously too dangerous inside the chaotic space.

A single misstep and he would play himself to death.

These few years, he watched Ye Yuan enter the chaotic space time and again, fooling around by himself until he was about to die over and over again. Hence, he could not resist secretly scolding that Ye Yuan was a lunatic in his heart.

Over 130 thousand years of loneliness made Coldfeather very much long for someone to interact with.

If a person finally managed to come in but died in the end, he would really cry until he had no place to cry.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “I came to this place in order to comprehend spatial laws. Not entering the chaotic space to comprehend, could it be staying here and wait for death?”

“Heh, I was the same as you when I just came in, also running into the chaotic space every day, thinking that I can comprehend spatial laws. But, thousands of years passed, the spatial laws that I comprehended became lesser and lesser, but my injuries grew heavier and heavier. All the way until one time, I almost didn’t come back, and I never dared to go in again,” Coldfeather said.

Coldfeather was frightened. That time, he was badly wounded and on the verge of death, almost dying in the chaotic space.

After returning to this spatial node, he recuperated for a full decade before recovering.

Since then, he never dared to enter the chaotic space again.

The chaotic space that Ye Yuan was at previously was just the peripherals of the entire spatial inheritance. The power of the spatial collapse was not considered strong.

But this spatial node’s chaotic space, once it collapsed, the power would be unimaginable.

A single misstep and one would perish, their Dao disappearing.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I were you, I’ll enter again!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan ignored Coldfeather and started meditating.

Coldfeather naturally did not know that these few years, Ye Yuan’s spatial laws improved further. It was just that his closed-seclusion inside the spatial node was all meditative comprehensions.

Without him breaking through, Coldfeather would not be able to feel it.

Comprehending spatial laws with Sword Dao was indeed a shortcut.

Although compared to the past, the difficulty was more than a hundred times, a thousand times greater, without a doubt, Ye Yuan was continuously improving.

Ye Yuan said so, and he achieved it.

A few times, when Ye Yuan returned from the chaotic space, he was virtually already at his last gasp.

Coldfeather naturally could not dispense with taunting and jeering remarks by the side. But after Ye Yuan recuperated his injuries, he resolutely entered the chaotic space once more.

Coldfeather’s expression at that time was really fascinating to the max.

Apart from scolding that Ye Yuan was a madman non-stop, Coldfeather seriously could not find a better adjective.

Just like this, the days passed by, from one year to another, Ye Yuan’s spatial laws improved with each passing day.
