Chapter 2497: The Arrogant Lin Chaotian!

“This … He’s going to unify the human race!”

“Listen to his orders? Then what about Lord Saint Azure?”

“Heh,?can’t you tell yet? He’s targeting Lord Saint Azure!”

… …

A series of indignant voices immediately came from inside the crowd.

Ye Yuan’s name of sainthood had long already spread throughout the human race.

Everyone obeyed Lord Saint Azure’s orders spontaneously.

But now, Lin Chaotian was oppressing people by force!

He already considered himself to be humanity’s number one person!

Tian Qing gave Lin Chaotian a glance and slowly retreated. Tian Qing did not speak.

He would not care about the human race’s affairs.

Lin Chaotian gave a cold snort and said, “This ancestor knows what you all are thinking! After Ye Yuan comes out, this ancestor will personally suppress him! Not submitting, then it’s death! Not just Ye Yuan; all of humanity’s Dao Ancestors have to submit to this ancestor! In the future, there will be no other great Dao Ancestors! Only me, Lin Chaotian!”

His words leaked overbearingness, reverberating throughout the sky.

Heavenly Dao Samsara, it was already not the era where nine great Dao Ancestors existed side by side any longer.

From now on, there was only Tian Qing and Lin Chaotian!

As for Ye Yuan, Lin Chaotian did not take him seriously anymore.

Being unkillable in the past, that was just because he was not strong enough.

Now, he believed that he absolutely had the strength to kill Ye Yuan!

The human powerhouses present dared to get angry but did not dare to speak.

The present Lin Chaotian was too strong!

Right at this time, the third passageway lit up!

The third Dao Ancestor was born!

Everyone’s gazes looked towards that passageway.

“I-It’s Sacred Ancestor High Priest!”

“He actually obtained the light crystal, becoming Dao Ancestor Light!”

“Not good, Lin Chaotian probably won’t let him off!”

… …

Seeing Sacred Ancestor High Priest, everyone’s gazes landed on Lin Chaotian naturally.

Sure enough, the corners of Lin Chaotian’s mouth curled slightly.

Clearly, he harbored ill-intent!

Sacred Ancestor High Priest was Ye Yuan’s man

Now, he became Dao Ancestor, how could Lin Chaotian possibly let him off?

“Wing, come over and pay respects to this ancestor!” Lin Chaotian’s words carried a sternness that brooked no intervention.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s brows furrowed, immediately getting annoyed.

He was already a Dao Ancestor. And yet, there was actually someone who dared to speak to him like that?

However, the moment his gaze landed on Lin Chaotian, his pupils could not help shrinking.

This guy actually became the new Dao Ancestor Firespirit?

Before Sacred Ancestor High Priest entered the Heavenspan Mountain, he was already a rule powerhouse!

Now, he became Dao Ancestor Light. His strength was also a tyrannical existence among Dao Ancestors already.

Lin Chaotian actually spoke to him like that. This made him very displeased.

Combined with the previous grudges, how could Sacred Ancestor High Priest lower his head?

“Lin Chaotian, you’re regarding yourself too highly, right? Even if this ancestor pays respects, it won’t be your turn too!” Sacred Ancestor High Priest said with a cold snort.

But Lin Chaotian just smiled faintly and said, “Is that so? Looks like you haven’t figured out the current situation yet!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest said disdainfully, “The current situation is that I’m a Dao Ancestor too! After Ye Yuan returns, plus Treasure Pig, what do you count as?”

Wing was very clear that he might not be Lin Chaotian’s match currently.

But Ye Yuan already possessed Dao Ancestor-level strength to begin with.

Coupled with Treasure Pig who could rival two great Dao Ancestors, their side was absolutely the strongest in the Heavenspan World!

Therefore, he did not fear Lin Chaotian at all.

However, Lin Chaotian just smiled faintly and said, “You didn’t hear it earlier. Then this ancestor will repeat this sentence again! From now on, humanity will hold me in the highest esteem! All Dao Ancestors must submit to this ancestor! Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest snorted coldly and said, “Who the hell do you think you are? To also dare be conceited enough to proclaim supremacy? Bear the consequences yourself??Heh,?this ancestor wants to see how I’ll bear the consequences!”

Lin Chaotian nodded slightly and said, “Okay, I’ll let you see how!”

Finished talking, his figure moved, a palm already smacking over.

Without that earth-shaking great battle just now, it was just an ordinary palm.

In fact, people could not even feel the undulation of fire-attribute rule on Lin Chaotian’s body.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest was unperturbed and not afraid. He just gave a cold snort, and similarly smacked a palm out.

Immediately, a light rule power overflowed from his palm area.

The terrifying energy undulation shocked the world!

It was just that the powerhouses present all sighed slightly.

Clearly, they were not optimistic about Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Bang!

The two great Dao Ancestors exchanged a blow. Sacred Ancestor High Priest only felt a terrifying flame power directly penetrated his body and entered.

“Pffft!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest spurted a mouthful of blood wildly, his figure directly flying out backward.

One move and he was already seriously injured!

Wing looked at Lin Chaotian in great shock and exclaimed, “This … How is this possible?”

He was the same as Lin Chaotian, a Dao Ancestor. But the two people’s strengths were too far apart!

Lin Chaotian said coolly, “Nothing is impossible! Do you think that Ye Yuan and that pig will be able to save you? After he comes out, this ancestor will personally end him! Now, tell me your choice, submit, or die!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s gaze was gloomy, and he shouted coldly, “Want this ancestor to submit to you? Dream on!”

Lin Chaotian just shook his head slightly and let out a sigh as he said, “You really won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin!”

It was only to see his figure moved, appearing beside Sacred Ancestor High Priest as if out of thin air.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s hair stood on end, a feeling of extreme danger welling up in his heart.

Instinctively, he was about to teleport away.

Corroborating his Dao and becoming an ancestor, his application of spatial law had similarly reached the extreme.

Furthermore, as Dao Ancestor Light, his movement technique was extremely fast to begin with.

Between Dao Ancestor and Dao Ancestor, there was deterrence!

Because among them, it was very hard to kill the other person.

Otherwise, for so many years, it would also have been impossible for the nine great Dao Ancestors to get along peacefully.

Evading this blow, Wing breathed a slight sigh of relief.

However, right at this time, a voice exploded in his ears.

“It’s useless! You can’t escape in front of this ancestor!”

No idea since when, Lin Chaotian actually caught up to him already!

And he actually did not even know it! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Terrifying!

Too terrifying!

How could this be?

But he did not have time to think about it.

Lin Chaotian’s palm was already imprinted onto his chest.

“Pffft!”

Wing spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, his entire innards like they were incinerated.

This palm practically shattered his internal organs.

Wing fell heavily to the ground, his aura weak, already unable to move.

He looked at Lin Chaotian with a shocked face, full of unwillingness.

Why?!

Similarly a Dao Ancestor, why is Lin Chaotian so strong?

Lin Chaotian stood with his hands behind his back. Trampling a foot on Wing’s face, he said with contempt, “I’ll leave you your life first. The light crystal will be stored in your body first. After this ancestor kills Ye Yuan, I’ll send you guys off together!”

Once a Dao Ancestor died, the rule crystal would condense anew.

A new Dao Ancestor would also be born.

It was just that in the last epoch, no Dao Ancestors died. There naturally also would not be changes in Dao Ancestors.

But this era was different!

He, Lin Chaotian, was too strong!

Each and every one of the human race powerhouses present was dumbfounded with shock.

They all did not expect that the disparity between Dao Ancestors would actually be so great!
