Chapter 3015: You All Play by Yourselves, as Long as You’re Happy!

“Door of Eternal Life! He’s going to assault Emperor Vast Heaven!”

Only to see Ye Yuan slam a punch out, chaos divine essence gushed out like tidewater, smashing onto the first seal like a cannon shell.

Everyone’s expression changed. They felt an impact that defied all comparison!

Boom!

The first seal opened in response!

“It opened? This is also a little too easy, right?”

“Isn’t it that easy? You think about it. When he was upper Emperor Cloud Heaven previously, he already beat the nine great young patriarchs until they didn’t have the strength to fight back!”

“With four great bloodlines fusing, it made me feel an endless power! It’s as if this power came out of the Door of Eternal Life!”

“It turns out that the four great bloodlines fusing is the power of chaos?”

… …

Smashing open the first seal with a punch, it was too simple.

Ye Yuan felt a sacred aura overflowing from the Door of Eternal Life, flowing into his body.

It was as if he had ascended to a higher level too.

“Is this the power of the Door of Eternal Life? Indeed miraculous! Just what is at that end of the Door of Eternal Life? No wonder every Hegemon Realm yearns to transcend the Great Beyond. This divine power seriously makes people yearn for it!”

Feeling this divine aura, Ye Yuan could not help feeling vicissitudes of emotion.

In the past, he did not understand.

But now, he somewhat understood.

The Hegemons could transcend samsara, could shatter the void with martial arts, and could surmount all life.

But, this Door of Eternal Life was like a shackle, locking them in this region of chaos.

This was a door that led to a new world, but they were unable to pass through.

Rumble?…

Endless tribulation clouds condensed above the void.

Dao tribulation arrived again!

The sky was a pitch dark mass, giving people an extremely gloomy feeling. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Anyone also knew that the power of this Dao tribulation was not small.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, the Dao sword condensing in his hand.

The surging chaos divine essence poured into the Dao sword in its entirety.

Hence, he swung his sword and pointed straight at the firmament.

An incomparably swift and fierce sword light directly split the sky into two!

Boom!

The tribulation clouds scattered with a loud bang!

His strength already far surpassed the power of the Dao tribulation.

This level of Dao tribulation could not pose a threat to him anymore.

However, Ye Yuan also knew that the day that he broke through to Hegemon, Heavenly Dao would definitely do its best to stop him.

At that time, it would definitely be the power of destruction!

The tribulation of Hegemon was when he would truly fight with Heavenly Dao.

At this time, Ye Yuan held the Dao sword in his hand, standing in the air with unparalleled splendor, blinding everyone’s eyes.

Even Hegemons could not be as free and easy as him too, cutting the Dao tribulation down above the firmament!

Long He’s expression was ashen. He discovered that he was simply a weakling in front of Ye Yuan.

His provocative action today was completely in order to help Ye Yuan achieve his aim.

The current Ye Yuan looked like a great hero of his generation no matter how one looked at him, lording over the world!

Meanwhile, he was the stepping stone beneath the foot of the overlord!

Ye Yuan retracted his gaze, landed on Long He’s body once more, and he said coolly, “Long He, you asked me to use bloodline power to have a battle with you. Receive my move then!”

Long He instinctively wanted to refuse, but Ye Yuan did not give him a chance at all. He already threw a punch over.

Boom!

It seemed to be an ordinary punch, but the four great true spirit bloodline powers in Ye Yuan’s body erupted at the same time.

Then it condensed into an incomparably sacred power of chaos, smashing over toward Long He.

Long He’s expression changed drastically, feeling like the sky had fallen down.

Without the slightest hesitation, he directly brought out his chaos innate divine ability!

“Heavenly Thunder Change!”

With a bellow, a clap of thunder out of Long He’s mouth, blasting until everyone’s eardrums hurt.

The moment the clap of thunder came out, a destructive aura poured out.

And right at this time, Ye Yuan’s fist had arrived!

Boom!

A loud bang, ten times louder than Long He’s clap of thunder.

Long He’s clap of thunder was actually forcibly smashed back by Ye Yuan!

The power of chaos was unstoppable!

It was only to hear Long spurt out a large mouthful of blood with a cough, directly being smashed underground by Ye Yuan.

Everyone drew a breath of cold air, looking toward Ye Yuan in horror.

This punch was strong until it made people’s hearts palpitate!

Among the nine great young patriarchs, Long He was the oldest, and his strength was the greatest.

Upper Emperor Vast Heaven, coupled with chaos innate divine ability, he was absolutely not what ordinary people could jump realms to fight.

But Ye Yuan seemed to have unleashed the power of great antiquity, smashing Long He’s innate divine ability back with one punch!

“S-So strong! The fusion of the four symbols true spirit bloodlines, such an ordinary punch actually erupted with such horrifying power! This boy is going to defy the heavens!” Long Hai said in shock.

The power of this punch was naturally very weak to him.

But, to an Emperor Vast Heaven, it was ridiculously strong.

This was because Ye Yuan did not use any method at all. He just released the pressure of his fusion bloodline and threw out an ordinary punch.

But, it was this ordinary punch that leapfrogged two minor realms, thrashing Young Patriarch Long He until he did not have an unscathed spot on his body!

It could be imagined that if Ye Yuan was in the same realm as him, he could blow him up with one punch!

Furthermore, he clearly felt the power of the Door of Eternal Life from that punch earlier.

This power did not originate from the Door of Eternal Life but the fusion of the four great bloodlines!

Long Jian similarly said in shock, “The fusion of the four great bloodlines can actually give off the power of the Door of Eternal Life? Doesn’t this mean that the four great true spirits’ bloodlines actually have some kind of connection with the Door of Eternal Life?”

Long Hai and Long Jian were both frightened by this conjecture.

For so many years, the four clans had gone about their own ways and even went on expeditions against each other.

But he did not expect that the fusion of these four powers could actually produce such a fantastical effect.

Long Hai said, “If that’s the case, if the four great progenitors joined hands, can they open the Door of Eternal Life?”

Long Jian’s expression changed, and he shook his head and said, “This … is hard to say, but this is too dangerous! The Door of Eternal Life grants us power, but it’s also extremely dangerous!”

Long Hai’s expression also became ugly. But this temptation was really great!

Just as everyone was in shock, Long He crawled out from underneath the earth.

Fresh blood sprayed wildly from his body; he was very miserable.

Half of this was the power of Ye Yuan’s punch. The other half was the power of his Heavenly Thunder Change’s smothered explosion.

Urgh, it was completely borne by him.

“You … You won! From now on, the nine of us won’t compete for the position of young patriarch anymore! The dragon race’s young patriarch is yours!” Long He said weakly.

The other eight also had dimmed faces.

They had fought for so many years. In the end, it was snatched away by a guy who popped out from god knows where.

To say that there was no reluctance, that was impossible.

But Ye Yuan’s strength and potential were really beyond strong.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said with a smile, “You guys keep competing. Take it as if I don’t exist! I won’t fight for whatever dragon race young patriarch. You guys also don’t need to worry that Senior Mi Tian will confer me the position of young patriarch. This is because he knows that I’m not interested in this at all.?Uh,?you all play by yourselves, as long as you’re happy.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan left with his hands behind his back, looking very natural and unrestrained.

The remaining group of people had dumbfounded faces.?You beat until so miserably when you were not freaking vying for it?

Hang on! It seems like this guy said that he was not fighting for it from the start!

It was just that, at that time, nobody believed it at all.
