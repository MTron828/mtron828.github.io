Chapter 2432: Strangers When Meeting Again!

Ye Yuan’s small world was undergoing earth-shaking changes.

Black energy metamorphosed. The sun and moon, as well as the constellations, began to gradually take shape.

On the earth, mountains and lakes were also being derived from the yellow energy.

The outline of a great world was currently slowly taking shape.

The chaos world that was initially without the slightest life had now started to glow with vigorous vitality.

At this moment, Ye Yuan truly felt the power of the world!

That sort of surging world power, made his strength soar in an instant.

This kind of strength gave him the feeling of having everything under control.

In this world, he was the absolute master, a paramount existence!

This surging sense of power made him have a feeling of being able to blow everything up.

Clearly, Daymeld also sensed the surge of Ye Yuan’s power!

Not just him, everyone present felt it.

This power was too terrifying!

Daymeld’s complexion was ashen as he said in shock, “You ... Just what kind of cultivation method are you cultivating? This sort of power increase is definitely not Deva First Blight!”

Judging from Ye Yuan’s current aura, he was no idea how many times stronger than Deva First Blight.

The gap was indeed very large between Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor and Deva First Blight. But it was absolutely not large until Ye Yuan’s extent.

Hence, that was why Daymeld would be so shocked.

Ye Yuan’s current strength was sufficient to rival Deva Second Blight powerhouses!

Coupled with Ye Yuan’s terrifying law attainments, his combat power approached middle-stage Nine-marks powerhouses.

Before breaking through, Ye Yuan’s combat power was already on par with Daymeld.

Now, killing him was merely a matter of lifting a hand.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You don’t need to care about what cultivation method. Either way, what can kill you is a good cultivation method! Alright, I can send you on your way now!”

The Sword of Spacetime lit up, a chill was revealed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Daymeld’s expression changed drastically, he knew that he could not block Ye Yuan’s next attack!

A feeling of despair spread in his heart.

In the last epoch, he fought against several Deva Fourth and Fifth Blight human sovereigns alone, and he could preserve his life.

In this life, he originally wanted to bring the divine race army to crush the human race.

Who would have expected that in the end, he actually ended up with the outcome of perishing and his Dao dissipating!

This result was something that he had never thought of before.

In his view, the present human race, there was already no one who could kill him apart from Dao Ancestors.

Even Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, this level of a sovereign, wanting to kill him head-on was basically impossible too.

But he never thought that he would actually die in the hands of a junior!

Whoosh!

The moment the cold light appeared, a large gap was directly torn apart in space.

The void seemed to have been directly sliced in half!

That sort of sharpness was simply irresistible.

Daymeld’s pupils constricted, casting Shrinking Earth into an Inch without the slightest hesitation.

But this sword contained profound power of spacetime. How could it be what the current him could evade?

In a blink, the sword’s edge already arrived!

It looked as if Daymeld was about to be cut in half.

But right at this critical moment, a beautiful figure suddenly walked out of the void.

Only to see the arrival cast a palm over. A formidable force actually collided head-on with the Sword of Spacetime.

Boom!

The void trembled, the two people were each repelled back.

Ye Yuan sighed lightly and said, “You finally still came.”

The arrival nodded slightly and said, “Yes, I have to come after all. Daymeld can’t die!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “I’m really not used to you talking like this.”

But the arrival said indifferently, “You’ll get used to it in the end. There will come a day when you and I will meet on the battlefield. If you don’t get used to it, you’ll die!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent and he said, “You really bear to make a move against me?”

The arrival did not carry the slightest emotion as she said, “The past has been severed. There isn’t any cannot bear it.”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said firmly, “I’ll bring you back!”

The arrival said coolly, “I’m still me. It’s just that I’m not the me in the past. How ... will you bring me back?”

Ye Yuan suddenly somewhat fell dispirited and waved his hand and said, “You guys leave!”

The arrival did not have the slightest nostalgia, turning around and bringing Daymeld away.

Everyone in the unpredictable army looked at this scene with shocked faces, being uncertain of what it meant.

But His Excellency already spoke up. So they naturally did not dare to stop.

Wan Zhen and Pang Zhen exchanged glances, both seeing the shock in the other person’s eyes.

They had never seen such a His Excellency before!

In their impression, His Excellency had always been calm and composed. He never showed mercy to the enemy.

But facing that woman who covered her face with a light gauze just now, His Excellency actually did not make a move.

Furthermore, it looked like the two of them were old acquaintances. Furthermore, the feelings were not shallow.

How did Lord Saint Azure know a woman from the divine race?

Ye Yuan watched that figure disappear into the horizon. His body seemed incomparably lonely and melancholic.

Even though a light gauze was covering her face and she was executing a pure Heavenly Dao True Martial, Ye Yuan still recognized this woman with one glance.

Because she was none other than precisely Yue Mengli!

Ye Yuan did not think that he broke through at the last moment and just as he was about to kill Daymeld, it was actually his beloved who suddenly rushed over and rescued him.

He was not surprised, but he was heartbroken.

That sort of indifference and resoluteness was like a knife, continuously gouging the flesh of Ye Yuan’s heart.

As early as when he brought Nineorigin back, Ye Yuan already knew that Li-er was no longer the original Li-er.

She accepted the baptism of the god statues and already became a true divine daughter!

Furthermore, Li-er’s talent was very suitable for the divine race’s cultivation method. Her cultivation speed was extremely fast and had long already reached the level of Nine-marks.

Judging from the strength that Yue Mengli displayed earlier, her combat power was not the least bit inferior to Ye Yuan’s.

The speed of her improvement could be imagined.

Actually, this was also something that Ye Yuan had always been worried about.

Ever since he regained his memories, he had been reluctant to face this issue head-on.

Nineorigin’s appearance left him no choice but to think about this problem.

Since Nineorigin brought Li-er away, he definitely had a way to make her a divine daughter.

Otherwise, what did he expend so much effort for?

It was just that Ye Yuan could not think of any method that the divine race had that could wipe away the feelings between him and Yue Mengli.

But, the moment when he brought Nineorigin back, he finally knew.

The divine race’s eight lineages, each lineage possessed a totem god statue.

These eight god statues were the foundation of the divine race!

And these eight god statues were precisely those eight that Ye Yuan saw back then at the Hidden Lineage!

It was just that those were reproductions of the eight lineages’ progenitors, and they were not the god statues’ true bodies.

Divine race members that experienced the baptism of the god statues would be irredeemably committed to the divine race.

Or should he say, this person had a strong sense of pride and belonging to the divine race?

But this was not an ordinary method of control.

Apart from being most loyal to the divine race, this person even retained their original emotions.

Pleasure, anger, sorrow, joy, not one was lacking, they were no different from ordinary people.

Ye Yuan learned from Nineorigin that Li-er was no longer that Li-er before.

Under his rage, Ye Yuan killed Nineorigin without hesitation.

But, this could not make up for the wound in his heart.

All the way until he saw Li-er again today, Ye Yuan’s heart hurt like a knife was twisting in.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan actually fell stiffly backward.

Wan Zhen and the rest turned pale with fright and hurriedly went up to support Ye Yuan.
