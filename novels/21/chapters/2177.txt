Chapter 2181: Move Aside!

“What? Went missing?”

Ye Yuan suddenly stood up, his eyes full of fury.

A horrifying aura surged to the sky, practically going to turn the entire hall upside down.

He went through countless hardships and stood here, standing in front of Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple, but the other party told him and Li-er went missing!

This result, he was somewhat unable to accept it.

When Fallen Maple and Jun Mingxin saw this scene, they also could not help being secretly startled.

Especially Jun Mingxin, only at this time did he know that when Ye Yuan was facing Lin Changqing previously, he did not use his full strength at all!

A Second Firmament Empyrean actually had such power.

“Second Sage don’t get angry first. Please listen to this emperor explaining until the end,” Fallen Maple slowly said.

Ye Yuan forcefully suppressed his fury and said in a solemn voice, “You say!”

Fallen Maple slowly stood up and said, “Follow me!”

As he said, he flicked his sleeves grandly and brought Ye Yuan into a room.

Upon entering the room, a pungent and nose-piercing smell hit him head-on.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he saw a person lying on the bed.

That person was unbearably rotten from head to toe, riddled full of holes, just like a cankered corpse.

When Ye Yuan looked over, he saw that that person’s breathing was akin to gossamer, merely still hanging in there with one last breath.

By the side, a thin and emaciated old man was currently spraying dew on the person’s body and turned a blind eye to the few people who just arrived.

Ye Yuan looked toward Fallen Maple, waiting for his explanation.

“He’s called Zhuo Yuanzhi. He’s this emperor’s disciple. Ten years ago, Angry Nether River was cut off and Blackflame Cave emerged. The surrounding hundred great imperial capitals turned into dead cities. Everybody said that that’s a Heavenly Emperor’s cave abode, attracting countless powerhouses over. The surrounding seven great Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas around Blackflame Cave all sent people to investigate, but in the end ... not a single one came out! The number of Empyreans that went missing was likely as many as hundreds!” Fallen Maple said with a sigh.

“Just a year ago, there were suddenly several people who escaped from Blackflame Cave. Junior Apprentice Brother Yuanzhi was one of them. It’s just that after he returned to Fallen Maple Bodhidharma, his entire person fell unconscious. In this one year, Martial Uncle Tan Yi exhausted all kinds of means and was also unable to curb the decay of Junior Apprentice Brother Yuanzhi. At the rate of this situation, he probably can’t last a month anymore.” Jun Mingxin followed up.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said unhappily, “Your Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas have so many heavenly emperors, so why make a bunch of empyreans go and seek death?”

Jun Mingxin smiled bitterly and said, “Not that we weren’t willing to go, but that the Blackflame Cave’s entrance is extremely unstable. Forget about heavenly emperors, even if late-stage Empyreans were to pass through, the cave entrance would likely collapse at once! That way, there would really be no hope at all.”

Pausing for a bit, Jun Mingxin continued, “You don’t need to suspect anything. These few years, Master has always viewed Junior Apprentice Sister Meng Li in a different light. Her cultivation resources even make many junior apprentice brothers envious. But she’s the little junior sister, and she’s also pretty. So nobody haggled over these with her. The mission this time, Junior Apprentice Sister Meng Li also took the initiative to volunteer for it. But we did not expect that this kind of thing happened.”

Hearing these, Ye Yuan finally calmed down slightly.

His gaze looked towards Zhuo Yuanzhi and he said in a solemn voice, “In that case, the crux lies with him?”

Fallen Maple nodded slightly and said, “If Yuanzhi can wake up, we should be able to know the events that happened inside Blackflame Cave.”

Ye Yuan did not say another word, came beside Tan Yi, and said in a solemn voice, “Move aside!”

Tan Yi’s brows furrowed and he said unhappily, “Where did this little rascal come from? To dare speak to this emperor like this?”

This Tan Yi was Fallen Maple’s junior apprentice brother, an Eight-star Alchemy God super existence!

But such a powerhouse was being ordered around by Ye Yuan, how could he not be enraged?

Except, the current Ye Yuan could not be bothered to talk crap with him at all, and he said in a solemn voice, “Orthodox Jade Illusory Dew can indeed revive the dead, but your medicine isn’t matching the syndrome. Keep doing this and he’ll be dead!”

Being shot down by a junior so mercilessly, Tan Yi’s beard billowed.

But Ye Yuan being able to recognize the Orthodox Jade Illusory Dew at a glance still made him slightly surprised in his heart. He knew that Ye Yuan was a practitioner and definitely had extraordinary attainments in alchemy.

It was just that this brat being so wildly arrogant made him very displeased.

He snorted coldly and said, “Junior, this emperor has lived to this ripe old age and has never seen this kind of strange poison before! This Orthodox Jade Illusory Dew is already the most ideal prescription! Could it be that you still have a better option?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Therefore, please move aside!”

Tan Yi nearly choked to death from anger and was just about to fly off the handle, but then he heard Fallen Maple say, “Junior Apprentice Brother, this is the Demon Clan’s Priest Temple’s Second Sage, with his alchemy strength being unparalleled under the heavens! Perhaps ... he can save Yuanzhi; who knows?”

Tan Yi’s pupils constricted, only then, sizing Ye Yuan up seriously.

He had never heard before Second Sage, but the Priest Temple was very famous.

This brat was the number one person beneath Sacred Ancestor High Priest?

How was this possible?

“Second Sage? Heh heh,

this emperor wants to take a look at how much ability the Priest Temple’s Second Sage has!” Tan Yi said with a cold laugh.

Ye Yuan’s current thoughts were not on him at all, he just said coolly, “You just watch and that will do.”

Ye Yuan came in front of the bed and fired out a strand of chaos divine essence, entering into Zhuo Yuanzhi’s body.

This wisp of divine essence circled five rounds within Zhuo Yuanzhi’s body and also did not find where the slightest problem lay. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He only felt that Zhuo Yuanzhi’s bodily functions were rapidly falling. An irresistible decaying energy seeped out of every pore on his body.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed tighter and tighter.

Tan Yi smiled coldly when he saw the situation and said, “Brat, even if you’re some dogshit Second Sage, you’re also looking down on Eight-star Alchemy Gods too much! Yuanzhi’s body, this emperor has already checked it no less than 20 times, but failed to get anything! It’s not some corpse poison and he also wasn’t inflicted with some poison. It’s just like he’s rotting out of the blue. Did you also discover that it’s like this?”

A hint of disappointment also flashed across Fallen Maple’s eyes.

He heard that Ye Yuan was Second Sage, so that was why he felt that there was some hope.

So he did not expect that it would not cut it either.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with Tan Yi’s mocking. The seals in his hands suddenly changed irregularly, inside the house suddenly became a sea of stars.

Chaos Heavenly Star Art!

Tan Yi’s pupils constricted, immediately discovering that Ye Yuan’s alchemy technique was extraordinary.

Broad and profound like the sea!

This was Tan Yi’s feeling.

Ye Yuan’s hands moved like lightning, one stream of chaos divine essence after another was sent into Zhuo Yuanzhi’s body.

Zhuo Yuanzhi’s body actually slowly suspended into the air and gave off a faint silver light.

Seeing this scene, the three Heavenly Emperor powerhouses in the house exchanged sidelong glances, struck dumb with amazement in their hearts.

Was this Second Sage’s strength?

Actually, when Fallen Maple saw Ye Yuan for the first time, he also had a feeling of young people could not be trusted with important tasks.

After all, being called Second Sage at this age was a little too inconceivable.

But now, his doubts were all gone!

The understanding of Dao that Ye Yuan exhibited was extremely deep.

“At a young age, he actually already comprehended his own Dao! This kid is truly a freak!” Tan Yi cried out involuntarily.

Right at this time, a brilliant light flashed in Ye Yuan’s eyes, and he said with a cold smile, “What a cunning thing, turns out that it’s actually hiding here! Come out for me!”

Ye Yuan struck a palm out, directly smashing down toward Zhuo Yuanzhi’s head.

Tan Yi and the rest turned pale with fright and were just about to stop him, but then they saw a dark thing suddenly fly out!
