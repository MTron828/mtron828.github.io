Chapter 2160: Miscalculating and Stumbling?

“Dragon Son Ye, although your status is noble, Ao Xu is my Purpledragon Stronghold’s heavenly emperor. His status is noble and can’t be easily insulted. Saying this sort of words, you have to take out hard evidence!”

The dragon lord who had been silent all along suddenly spoke up.

Ye Yuan’s sudden appearance made him rather surprised.

Being able to escape from under the hands of Bandit Xiao with this bit of strength, got to admit, Ye Yuan’s strength was pretty good.

Of course, it was likely more to do with luck.

Long Xiao this group of people, all of them were cunning like foxes, coming and going without a trace. Furthermore, their methods were extremely vicious and there had never been survivors.

Even the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon that died under their hands were quite a few too!

They did not expect that this time, this Son of the Heavenly Dragon actually escaped.

Ye Yuan looked at Ao Xu and said smilingly, “You seem to be very proud of yourself. Do you feel that I can’t do anything to you?”

Ao Xu snorted coldly and said, “Dragon Son Ye, this emperor calls you dragon son out of respect to the Heavenly Dragon Mountain! But you slandered this emperor, this emperor won’t willingly take things lying down either! Heavenly Emperors can’t be slandered!”

Ao Xu said it righteously as if the villain was Ye Yuan.

Everyone present knew Ao Xu’s ‘personality, and all felt that Ye Yuan was making trouble out of nothing.

But Ye Yuan shook his head and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Looks like you won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin. Dragon Lord Purpledragon, I wonder what’s the crime of murdering a Son of the Heavenly Dragon?”

Dragon Lord’s eyes glinted and he slowly said, “Murdering a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, one will be executed! However, the status of a Heavenly Emperor is transcendent, according to the rules set by Heavenly Dragon Mountain, they will be relegated to the second level of the Dragon Eye Cave!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes glimmered. The second level of the Dragon Eye Cave, that mysterious powerhouse should have come out of there, right?

But he guessed wrongly, Bai Chen did not come from the second level, but from a deeper place.

Ao Xu’s face fell, and he said, “Ye Yuan! A clay bodhisattva still has some anger! You provoked time and again, deliberately misrepresenting things. Just what intentions do you have? Do you think that with the status of a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, you can do whatever you want?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Wow, cornered dog about to jump the wall, is it? No rush, no rush. Come, come, come. Meet an old friend.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan pointed at the void, several figures fell out.

The few people had both hands behind their backs, kneeling in front of everyone, but had arrogant and unyielding faces.

Seeing these few people, Ao Xu’s expression changed wildly.

“Long Xiao! It’s the devil’s incarnate, Long Xiao! He ... He had his divine sea sealed!”

“This ... This isn’t possible! What kind of character is the living King Yama Long Xiao? How can he possibly be caught by him?”

“It turns out that he didn’t escape from Long Xiao’s hands, but he captured Long Xiao! It’s been so many years. Purpledragon Stronghold has sent out how many Heavenly Emperors and Empyreans, but failed to do anything to him. He was actually captured by a First Firmament Empyrean brat?”

... ...

The few people that fell out of the void were precisely Long Xiao and the others!

The powerhouses in Purpledragon Stronghold were all shocked until it could not be surpassed.

Long Xiao this group of people killed people like flies, their evil doings knew no limits and had plagued Purpledragon Stronghold for many years.

In order to capture Long Xiao and the rest, Purpledragon Stronghold had expended no idea how much manpower and material resources but returned without accomplishing anything.

Today, this group of people was actually eradicated by the measly little Ye Yuan. How could they not be shocked?

The world knew that it was extremely hard to jump realms and battle at Empyrean Realm.

A second Firmament Empyrean versus a First Firmament Empyrean was virtually getting crushed.

Even if your talent was unparalleled and combat strength monstrous, and could defeat a Second Firmament Empyrean as a First Firmament Empyrean, facing a Third Firmament Empyrean, there were no chances of victory at all.

But Long Xiao was Fourth Firmament Empyrean, a middle-stage Empyrean super powerhouse!

How could such a powerhouse get captured by Ye Yuan?

“Not greeting when you see an old friend?” Ye Yuan looked at Ao Xu and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Ao Xu’s heart shook wildly, he completely never thought that Ye Yuan would capture Long Xiao and his gang.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, being able to escape from under Long Xiao’s hands was already a stroke of luck, how could he possibly capture Long Xiao?

But Ye Yuan did something that he could not imagine!

Ao Xu finally knew where Ye Yuan’s confidence lied.

However, how could he resign himself to death?

“What greeting? Long Xiao has done all sorts of evils and plagued a region. For Dragon Son Ye to be able to capture him, it’s the greatest good! Dragon Son Ye, I know that you were attacked by Long Xiao without cause, so you suspect me. But I, Ao Xu, assures that this is just a coincidence!” Ao Xu was well-deserving of being a sly old fox, cutting off relations with a casual sentence.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed and he said with a smile, “Oh? Just a coincidence huh? Long Xiao, you tell Ao Xu, was this matter a coincidence or not?”

Long Xiao slowly lifted his head. He grinned, the scar on his face appearing even more hideous and horrifying.

“Dragon Son Ye, this matter was naturally a coincidence! What kind of status do I, Long Xiao, have? How can I possibly know an exalted Heavenly Emperor powerhouse? Kid, I don’t know what intentions you have, but if you want to use me to malign others, it’s impossible to prevail!” Long Xiao said with a proud look. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The moment these words came out, everyone revealed amused looks.

Ao Xu was even happier in his heart. It was not one or two days that he had been controlling Long Xiao this group of people, he naturally had a score in his heart.

Long Xiao was a clever person. Unless his brain was damaged, he would not betray him.

Otherwise, Dragon Source Village would be completely destroyed!

Ye Yuan’s face changed and he said in surprise and anger, “Long Xiao, this isn’t what you told me previously! You ... You tricked me?”

Long Xiao had an arrogant and unyielding look as he said with a cold smile, “What did I say to you previously? I don’t know what grudge you have with this lord, but even though I, Long Xiao, have killed countless people, I’ve never been someone’s pawn! You want to make use of me? No chance!”

Ye Yuan had a hesitant look and roared angrily, “Long Xiao, I’ll kill you!”

Under his rage, Ye Yuan smacked a palm out and was about to eradicate Long Xiao.

Dragon Lord lightly flicked his sleeves. A gust of strong wind blew over, directly sending Ye Yuan flying out.

“Dragon Son Ye, this Long Xiao has plagued Purpledragon Stronghold for many years. He can’t die just like this. For you to be able to capture him over, this lord is very grateful. But if you want to kill him, there’s no way. Come, men, detain Bandit Xiao and await sentencing!” Dragon Lord said coolly.

Ao Xu was incomparably delighted with himself inwardly but put on a benign appearance as he said coolly, “Dragon Son Ye, it’s all a misunderstanding between you and me. This emperor didn’t take good care of you and Long Xiaochun. It was this emperor’s blunder. This emperor ... apologizes to you.”

“You ... You’re really hypocritical! It was clearly you who instigated them, but now, you’re pretending to be a good person! You’re a bad guy! To think that I still trusted you so much!” Long Xiaochun said in a frenzy of rage by the side.

Ao Xu let out a sigh and said, “Forget it. Looks like the misunderstanding towards this emperor is too big. I will take my leave.”

As he spoke, Ao Xu’s figure flashed, disappearing.

Dragon Lord said coolly, “There’s a sudden turn of events today in the stronghold. The matter of setting off will be delayed for three days. Three days later, all of the dragon sons will head for Heavenly Dragon Mountain. Dragon Son Ye, you stay in the stronghold first.”

No one could have thought that things would actually develop to such a step.

Ye Yuan came in a threatening manner but became a joke in the end.

Returning to the residence, Ao Xu’s gaze glinted, and he said with a cold sneer, “Brat, you’re still ten thousand years too early to fight with this emperor! However, Long Xiao this group of people can’t be kept anymore! Something unforeseen will eventually happen with Dragon Lord keeping them.”
