1748 Flustered Refinemen

“One hour to refine a rank four demon divine pill. You’re also not afraid of blowing a hole in the sky with your bragging!” Mu Yuanchun said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Whether or not it’s boasting, you’ll know in a while. Uh, but I still have to thank you, your pill refinement earlier gave me quite a bit of reference.”

Mu Yuanchun’s strength stood out among this group of people.

His pill refinement was naturally worth learning.

Ye Yuan deduced the pill formula and compared his pill refinement with the other people’s pill refinement, and indeed benefited a great deal.

When Mu Yuanchun heard, his face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Don’t give me that! You aren’t going to say again that it’s your first time refining a demon divine pill, right?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Really smart, what I wanted to say was all said by you.”

Mu Yuanchun said with a cold smile, “Do you think that I’d believe it?”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Believing or not is up to you, what has it got to do with me? I’m going to start refining the pill.”

The moment he started refining, Ye Yuan’s entire person immediately entered a fully engrossed state.

The preparation work at the beginning, Ye Yuan completed it naturally and smoothly, with the air of a master.

Even the eyes of those three people above revealed looks of astonishment.

When experts make their move, the genuine and the fake would become clear at a glance.

Ye Yuan’s handling, even they, these Five-star priests, also prostrated in admiration.

When Mu Yuanchun saw this scene, his expression was incomparably ugly.

He had no choice but to admit that Ye Yuan’s talent was too strong!

Whatever accumulation of time, this sort of words, was simply like farting when placed on Ye Yuan.

“Still say whatever first time! One look and it’s a veteran who’s well-seasoned. Really take us to be three-year-old kids?” Mu Yuanchun said with a cold snort.

“It’s indeed his first time refining demon divine pills!”

Kong Lin arrived by Mu Yuanchun’s side at goodness knows when, looking at Ye Yuan with a serious look as he said those words.

Mu Yuanchun’s expression changed and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Kong, this ... How is this possible?”

Kong Lin said, “It’s what Master said, so definitely won’t be wrong! He must be an extremely formidable alchemist in the human race, but he also has a demon race bloodline. So he got started extremely quickly. It’s just that his talent ... is really too terrifying!”

Mu Yuanchun’s gaze revealed a look of astonishment, looking at Ye Yuan with immense shock.

At this time, Ye Yuan already started refining the pill. It was just that his current performance was akin to two different people from just now.

Only after getting started did Ye Yuan truly feel the difference between the two systems. It was really not that easy to cross.

Even though his demonic attraction art improved extremely fast, truly applying it to pill refinement was another matter altogether.

It was inevitable that he was unfamiliar.

Refining divine pills, the consumption of soul force was tremendous.

But refining demon divine pills had extremely high requirements on physical strength.

If not for Ye Yuan having long reached middle-stage fourth transformation, he would really have bitten off more than he could chew.

Ye Yuan discovered that using the demonic attraction art to fuse medicinal pills, the technique was a hundred times more complicated than the soul attracting art.

Each segment needed to expend tremendous physical strength.

Compared to really refining pills, fusing wood chips earlier was simply a child’s play.

However, while Ye Yuan’s hands and feet were thrown into confusion, it was completely not the case in other people’s eyes.

Regardless of whether it was Kong Lin or Mu Yuanchun, they were totally dumbstruck with amazement.

“Senior Apprentice Brother, I’m still unable to believe that it’s actually this guy’s first time refining a demon divine pill!” Mu Yuanchun gritted his teeth and said.

Kong Lin smiled bitterly and said, “How can I believe it too? But you look at his refining method, it’s clearly incomparably unfamiliar. But even so, it still gives you a feeling of pleasing both the eyes and the heart. This kind of feeling is seriously too contradictory.”

Mu Yuanchun felt that his confidence suffered a tremendous blow. If a person’s first time coming into contact with demon divine pills could do it to this extent, then wouldn’t his many years of hard work become a joke?

Of course, he would not think that for Ye Yuan to be able to have his present accomplishments, apart from talent, what he put in was a hundred times, even a thousand times of his!

Mu Yuanchun said in a solemn voice, “Senior Apprentice Brother Kong, then in your view, what grade of Darkcloud Profound Spring Pill can he refine?”

Kong Lin shook his head and said, “That’s hard to say! His technique is indeed very unfamiliar, one look and it’s a novice’s skill. However, he also rarely makes mistakes. I reckon it makes sense that there shouldn’t be a problem.”

Mu Yuanchun heaved a sigh in relief and muttered under his breath, “Just middle-grade huh ... then that’s still alright.”

The moment one hour was up, Ye Yuan indeed finished packing up, leaving everyone watching dumbfounded with their mouths agape.

Ye Yuan wiped the sweat on his forehead and let out a sigh of relief as he said, “Haven’t been so flustered in so long!”

Flustered ...

When the surrounding demons heard Ye Yuan’s words, they wished to kick his face.

That is called flustered?

You take a look at the others first, alright?

After the second round, there were merely less than 20 people remaining. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

And these people were currently all covered in sweat, at a loss on what to do, fearful of making the slightest mistake.

This is called being flustered, okay?!

These people, each and every one of them had refined pills for close to six hours.

You freaking finished in an hour and was still complaining about being tired here. Was there such a need?

After Ye Yuan finished refining, six hours were up very quickly.

Quite a number of people had not finished refining yet. Each and every one of them was extremely dispirited.

Finally managed to persist till the third round, but could not finish on time.

Actually, with their strength, even if they completed it, it was likely that they would fail to reach the requirement of middle-grade too.

Kong Lin started examining the pills. The vast majority of those successfully refined ones were all low-grade medicinal pills.

But apart from Mu Yuanchun, there was actually still one person who refined a middle-grade Darkcloud Profound Spring Pill, passing the examination.

“Hahaha! My thousand over years was finally not in vain! I finally got my break!”

Knowing that he passed the test, that demon youth started laughing excitedly, almost mad.

Clearly, these thousand over years, he had been under too much pressure.

When the others saw him, they were envious and also helpless.

Kong Lin frowned and said, “Shouting and wrangling in front of elders, where lies the sense of propriety?”

That demon youth could not help choking when he heard that and immediately became sombre.

Even though he passed the test, he belonged to the lowest standing priest trainees in the Priest Temple.

While Kong Lin was a true priest!

Reaching Mu Yuanchun, passing the test was naturally something within expectations.

“High-grade, not bad! Mu Yuanchun passes the test!” Kong Lin said with a slight smile.

Mu Yuanchun smiled and said, “Many thanks, Senior Apprentice Brother Kong!”

His view was the same as Kong Lin’s. Even though Ye Yuan was prodigious, in this last round, it was impossible to beat him.

That kind of unfamiliar technique, being able to refine middle-grade was already very heaven-defying.

High-grade was virtually without possibility!

The last one, it was Ye Yuan’s turn.

After opening the furnace, Kong Lin could not help choking as he cried out, “S-Superior-grade! This is impossible!”

Kong Lin was instantly flustered. Even though there had already been too many instances of shock previously, it was far from as intense as this time.

Ye Yuan’s refining technique looked really very clumsy.

But such a clumsy technique, he actually refined a superior-grade demon divine pill!

One had to know, he already became a true priest now. Refining the Darkcloud Profound Spring Pill, he might not be able to reach superior-grade stably as well.

Ye Yuan’s first refinement and he could refine a superior-grade Darkcloud Profound Spring Pill?
