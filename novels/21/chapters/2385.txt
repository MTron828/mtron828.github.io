Chapter 2391: Inheritance Grand Array!

“Lord Wenshui, we’ve already come to the Heavenly Hidden World for five years and haven’t even met the chief instructor. This cannot be justified no matter what, right?” Shang Hang said with a forthright look.

In front of him was an old man with a long beard.

Honestly speaking, he was also very puzzled by Ye Yuan confining himself inside.

This chief instructor that Lord Profound Secrets sent for wouldn’t be making use of Deicide’s resources to only care about his own cultivation, right?

“This ... His Excellency is currently in closed-seclusion. So it’s not convenient for me to disturb too.”

Heavenly Emperor Wenshui was sent to serve as Ye Yuan’s follower by the higher-ups. Although he was a Deva powerhouse, he was still a head lower in front of Ye Yuan’s identity.

After all, Ye Yuan was beneath one person and above millions.

Shang Hang sneered coldly when he heard that and said, “Heh! He, this chief instructor, is really taking it easy. Making use of Deicide’s cultivation resources every day, and in the end, he doesn’t care about anything. Lord Wenshui, if he doesn’t come out today, we won’t leave! Whatever for the sake of overthrowing the divine race’s rule, fuck that bullshit, we’re not entertaining anymore!”

The current Shang Hang was simply a hothead, being far less level-headed and imposing compared to his future character.

Wenshui also leaned toward their opinion in his heart. He also felt that Ye Yuan was going somewhat overboard.

But Ye Yuan gave the orders. No one was allowed to disturb him. So Wenshui was really in a dilemma.

Wenshui let out a sigh and said, “Sigh, honestly speaking, I also don’t know why upstairs let him be the chief instructor. But since it’s an order, this emperor must carry it out! You all are not to cause a racket!”

“Eh, Lord Chief Instructor!” Shang Hang’s eyes suddenly lit up, looking in the direction of Inquire Heavenly Palace.

Wenshui was stunned and could not help turning his head.

A hint of cunningness flashed across in Shang Hang’s eyes, his body already floating toward Inquire Heavenly Palace.

Wenshui was alarmed and said, “Fine lad, want to rush over from under this emperor’s hands, no chance!”

His reaction was extremely fast too. But just as he made a move, he suddenly discovered that something was not right.

The surrounding spacetime had been distorted to varying degrees.

Although this could not stop him, in just this short while, Shang Hang already flew in.

Wenshui turned pale with fright, secretly thinking to himself that this brat was so impressive, to actually comprehend spacetime law at the same time!

But just as he was surprised, Shang Hang retreated with an even faster speed.

All of a sudden, he landed on the ground, footsteps retreating repeatedly, only barely managing to stand still after several dozen steps.

Shang Hang had a pale face, his eyes full of shock.

“S-Spacetime law!”

Shang Hang never thought that there were actually also others who grasped spacetime law!

Furthermore, in terms of strength, he could not catch up even if he whipped his horse!

A figure slowly walked out, as if walking over from the fog. Everyone could not see him clearly at all.

This person was clearly standing in front of them, but they could not see this person’s features clearly!

Unfathomable!

At this time, this was the thought in the hearts of all the geniuses.

The arrival asked nonchalantly, “What’s your name?”

Shang Hang’s expression was rather ugly, he still answered, “S-Shang Hang.”

A hint of a smile appeared on Ye Yuan’s face. He did not expect that traveling through spacetime, he actually arrived at Grand Ancestor Spacetime’s youth era.

But, thinking about it, Ye Yuan also felt relieved.

Spacetime Reversal Chaos was the heaven-defying martial technique of Shang Hang, and he triggered Shang Hang’s Spacetime Reversal Chaos in later generations. Traveling through spacetime should also be related to Shang Hang.

But the current Shang Hang had a look of immaturity, being far from the future version of him showing disdain on all under the heavens.

Even if it was just a wisp of remnant consciousness, that sort of aura that considered all beneath his notice, was not the slightest bit diminished too.

“You can comprehend spacetime law at the same time, very good!” Ye Yuan said with a smile. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Shang Hang had a look of embarrassment and said unwillingly, “Is Your Excellency mocking me? What does my bit of meager cultivation base count as in front of you?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re not as good as me right now, but you’ll surely achieve great things in the future! Even that divine race’s progenitor, where’s the harm in battling?”

Shang Hang yearned for it as he listened, but he immediately smiled bitterly and said, “Your Excellency is thinking too much. These two power of laws are overly abstruse. Junior is already feeling somewhat struggling to make ends meet now.”

Ye Yuan did not follow up, but asked, “Then, what did you guys forcefully rush Inquire Heavenly Palace for?”

Upon hearing this, Shang Hang was invigorated.

But at the thought of Ye Yuan’s strength, he was like a deflated balloon, immediately shriveling up.

They originally wanted to challenge Ye Yuan, but just now, Ye Yuan did not make a move at all, just mobilizing the power of law a little and he returned to his original spot involuntarily.

This kind of means was truly inconceivable.

If Ye Yuan wanted to kill him, it was merely a matter of a single thought.

“Your Excellency, you as the chief instructor, have never appeared in five years. It’s chilling the hearts of the myriad races’ geniuses!” Shang Hang said forcefully.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he smiled and said, “It’s only been five years, and you can’t wait for this bit of time too? You guys are also too impatient!”

Shang Hang smiled coldly and said, “Who knows what Your Excellency is thinking? If we didn’t come to forcefully rush Inquire Heavenly Palace, Your Excellency probably won’t leave seclusion for ten years, even 100 years too, right? Lord Profound Secrets inviting you to be the chief instructor, it is not to let you cultivate yourself daily, but it is to groom the human race’s powerhouses! No matter how strong you alone are, how can you deal with the divine race’s major powers?”

Ye Yuan fell silent.

He could feel Shang Hang’s desire to grow strong, that sort of obsession was almost bursting out of his body.

These few in front of him were all like that.

It was precisely this sort of powerful desire that let them become that powerful, right?

When Shang Hang saw Ye Yuan’s appearance, he still thought that he was acknowledging that he was in the wrong, and said with a cold smile, “Nothing to say? Someone like you isn’t fit to be the chief instructor at all! You are the moth of Deicide!”

These words were said rather nastily.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “Is that so? You guys follow me.”

Finished talking, he turned around and flew in the direction of Inquire Heavenly Palace.

Everyone was uncertain what it meant but still followed after.

“What kind of tricks is this person going to play?”

“Shang Hang, you’re dead for sure! You said it so nastily just now. He’s definitely going to punish you underhandedly!”

“Humph! Scared for what? What I said is the truth!”

The few people followed behind, whispering quietly.

However, entering Inquire Heavenly Palace, everyone became dumbfounded.

“These ... What are these?”

When Shang Hang saw the scenery before his eyes, his entire person was stunned.

In front of him, there was a series of complicated to the extreme grand arrays.

These array formations were linked with one another, being incomparably complicated and profound.

Glancing over, it was like a dreamy ocean. It was exquisitely beautiful!

With their horizons, they could not see through the actual situation in front of them at all.

Even Heavenly Emperor Wenshui was also stunned at this time.

These five years’ time, he was tinkering with these things inside?

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and said smilingly, “Don’t you guys want to become strong? These array formations can help you all become strong! I’ve been thinking on how to impart the power of laws that I comprehended to you guys to the maximum limit. It’s just that preaching Dao to you guys every day is clearly not a good idea. Some things can only be understood and not expressed with words. Now, I’ve integrated all that I’ve learned during my lifetime into these array formations. As long as your talents are sufficient, you’ll naturally be able to comprehend.”

Shang Hang opened his mouth wide, looking at Ye Yuan with a shocked face, wanting to speak. But he discovered that his throat seemed to be blocked. He was unable to speak no matter what.
