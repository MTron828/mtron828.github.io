Chapter 1371: Talent Too Poor?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Starting from now, you all have one month’s time to comprehend the Wu Meng Wargod Formula’s first level cultivation method! After a month, you all will revolve the cultivation method on this jade pillar. You just have to make the jade pillar light up five scale lines, and it’s considered as a pass! After five scale lines, each scale higher, you’ll obtain 15 points!”

In front of the plaza stood an emerald green jade pillar.

There were 30 scale lines on the jade pillar. They naturally represented the comprehension degree of 30 levels.

“Five scales and you pass the test? Then isn’t this round very easy?” Ye Yuan said rather curiously.

Xie Jingyi smiled bitterly and said, “How can it be as easy as you think? Actually, this round is the hardest among the three rounds! The Wu Meng Wargod Formula is extensive and profound, how much can one comprehend in a month’s time? Right now, there are still around 2000 people remaining. It would be pretty good to have four to five hundred people remaining in the end! The majority of the people’s standard is also just around three or four scales. Five scales are very difficult. If you get those people who are eliminated come and comprehend, it would be pretty impressive to be able to have one scale.”

Ye Yuan came to understand in his heart and had a direct understanding of this round’s difficulty.

But this was not a problem for him. He was very confident in his comprehension ability.

“So that’s how it is! Then in your view, how many scales can Jia Chong reach?” Ye Yuan said curiously. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xie Jingyi’s expression turned stern, and he said, “In the legends, the highest record for this round is 23 scales! In normal years, the number one is approximately 15 to 16 scales. If judging him according to third place, it’s roughly 12 to 13 scales! Ye Yuan, are you ... confident?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a smile, “You just put your heart back in place! What you have to do is comprehend well and succeed in clearing the round!”

Seeing Ye Yuan so certain, Xie Jingyi settled down a lot in his heart.

Perhaps Ye Yuan could really create a miracle!

“Now, third round, Illumination ... start!”

Following the old man’s voice sounding out, everyone’s consciousness was pulled out of the body once more.

In the consciousness space, Ye Yuan was surrounded by endless divine inscriptions.

Presently, divine inscriptions were already not some unfathomable thing to Ye Yuan anymore.

“This set of cultivation method ... seems to be very simple!”

Ye Yuan browsed over the divine inscriptions and discovered that this set of cultivation method was surprisingly simple.

Originally, he still wanted to comprehend it earnestly but discovered that these divine inscriptions were easily discerned at a glance. There was no mystery to speak of in front of him at all.

A hint of understanding appeared in Ye Yuan’s heart as he sighed emotionally and said, “Yeah, the Chaos Heavenspan Canon is all-encompassing. It’s no idea how many levels stronger than this Wu Meng Wargod Formula. No wonder it would be so simple.”

Ye Yuan found the reason very quickly. His horizons were too high!

What kind of cultivation method the Chaos Heavenspan Canon turned into in the future, Ye Yuan was not clear as well. But to be able to trigger an illusionary Heavenspan Mountain to descend, this first level cultivation method was absolutely no ordinary!”Access Read.live if you like watching manga,comics.

Ye Yuan created the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, then coming to comprehend the Wu Meng Wargod Formula, he was like a top student learning advanced mathematics going to do elementary school math problems.

Too simple!

“This cultivation method has its merits. But sadly, it’s a little shallow. If modifying it slightly, it should have greater potential. But my current realm is too low. At most, I can only modify this first level’s cultivation method.”

Only using three days’ time, Ye Yuan thoroughly comprehended the Wu Meng Wargod Formula.

Not just so, he even saw through this cultivation method’s many shortcomings.

As long as he was willing, he could make this cultivation method even more perfect, letting the foundations of the people who cultivate it be even more solid.

It was just that there was no meaning in him doing so right now, so he could not be bothered to do it either.

This cultivation method was too simple. Ye Yuan was bored to death staying behind and directly withdrew out of the consciousness space.

“Mm? It has only been three days, and somebody left the consciousness space?”

The mind of the old man on the platform stirred, his brows knitted tightly, his gaze begun searching in the crowd.

“Could it be that somebody felt that the Wu Meng Wargod Formula is too hard, and is aware that they are unable to pass the test, so they abandoned themselves to despair?” said another old man.

“Afraid so!”

The test in the past, no matter how talented the student, there had never been a precedent of withdrawing out of the consciousness space in-advance too.

He did not expect that this time, it actually appeared.

Even if those people knew that they were unable to pass the test, they would also do their best to comprehend the cultivation method.

After all, Wu Meng Wargod Formula, this level of cultivation method, was one-of-a-kind in the entire Wu Meng Capital City, the opportunity hard to come by!

The two old men presiding over the test both gave rise to a strong contempt towards this person.

People of the Martial Dao dreaded retreating in the face of difficulties the most.

This kind of mind, how to accomplish great things?

Right at this time, Ye Yuan slowly left the lotus seat and walked over towards the waiting area.

“It’s him!”

“This boy, his talent should be so poor, right?”

“That’s hard to say too! After all, Martial Dao willpower and comprehension ability don’t have a definite relationship. His age isn’t young anymore as well, but his realm is only so little. Perhaps it’s a problem of comprehension ability!”

“What you say makes sense too! It’s just that his wager agreement ... probably can’t be realized anymore! Originally thought that he could definitely pass the test.”

“Heh, not fulfilling the wager agreement, Jia Chong probably won’t let him off, right?”

“Since he isn’t the academy’s student, his life and death have nothing to do with us.”

The two people already determined that this was Ye Yuan’s talent being too poor, unable to comprehend the Wu Meng Wargod Formula.

After all, the Wu Meng Wargod Formula, such a profound cultivation method, even just the first level, was also absolutely not what could be comprehended in a month,

In reality, the 30 scale lines on the jade pillar were not complete, they were just a portion.

Wanting to fully comprehend the first level’s cultivation method, no matter how talented, one needed a hundred year’s time too.

A month was just a bit of superficial knowledge.

But whether Ye Yuan was eliminated or not still had to wait until after the jade pillar’s test to decide.

Ye Yuan came before the platform, gave a bow toward the two old men as a show of respect.

One of them could not resist and still opened his mouth to ask, “Ye Yuan, why did you withdraw from the consciousness space so quickly? Although this cultivation method is profound, if you comprehend for a month, it’s sufficient to benefit you for life!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Thank you for Teacher’s concern! The Wu Meng Wargod Formula is indeed extensive and profound. But a month’s time seriously can’t comprehend much. I plan on comprehending in detail after entering the academy.”

The old man froze, being somewhat baffled by Ye Yuan.

With the way you were, you still want to enter the Wu Meng Academy?

He had never seen before someone capable of entering the Wu Meng Academy with just three days of comprehension.

The old man’s face fell, and he said, “Ye Yuan, you mustn’t reach beyond your reach as a person! Your Martial Dao willpower is very firm, but since your talent is lacking, you have to make up for it with diligence. How can you talk big to impress people?”

In his view, Ye Yuan was clearly too lacking in talent, yet insisted on acting and showing off.

At that time, they would not even know how they died.

Ye Yuan just smiled slightly when he heard that and said, “Thank you for Teacher’s concern, Ye Yuan understands!”
