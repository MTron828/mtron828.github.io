Chapter 2016: Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital

However, by the side, Empyrean Flutterfeather was slightly afraid in his heart.

He completely did not think that going to Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether there this time, he actually ran into Jian Sutao.

In the Southern Border, Jian Sutao’s position was only higher and not lower than his.

One had to know, behind Jian Sutao was the Jian Family, this colossal giant.

Although Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure was powerful, compared to Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, the difference was too great.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually had such deep ties with the Jian Family.

Furthermore, looking at Jian Sutao and Ye Yuan conversing, the resentment was actually quite deep; an appearance of you’re displeasing to my eyes, but I also can’t do anything to you.

This ... was very weird!

Jian Sutao suddenly beamed and said to Ye Yuan, “Heh, kid, remember the words today. This is what you said, you owe me a favor.”

The moment these words came out, Ye Yuan’s and Empyrean Flutterfeather’s faces both turned black.

Was this guy ... really the Empyrean Sutao that struck people with awe?

This appearance was completely the appearance of a despicable villain!

But Ye Yuan also long had an understanding of Jian Sutao’s character. After being stunned, he nodded and said, “That’s for sure! This Ye never reneges on my word.”

Jian Sutao nodded and said, “This matter is settled; this Empyrean is leaving.”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Senior, take care.”

Jian Sutao flashed a slight nod at Empyrean Flutterfeather to make an indication, then stepped out and concealed into the void.

“Senior Flutterfeather, today’s matter, thank you very much. Ye Yuan remembers it firmly in my heart.”

Ye Yuan naturally knew how exalted Jian Sutao and Flutterfeather’s statuses were. For them to be able to take action and help, this due to their status. He naturally had to thank both of them.

Empyrean Flutterfeather waved his hand and said smilingly, “What’s there to be courteous between you and me? If not for you, it will likely still need God knows how many years for this Empyrean to want to reach this realm that everyone is envious of. Moreover, this Empyrean knows that you have earned God knows how much divine essence stones for the Myriad Treasure Tower these few years. This favor, this Empyrean naturally has to receive it.”

Disregarding other things, just the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill earned boatloads of divine essence stones for the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Furthermore, after Ye Yuan broke through to the Origin Pill Realm, he even developed the rank six Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill. This pill formula was also handed over to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Of course, these were all nothing.

To powerhouses at the level of Empyrean Flutterfeather, divine essence stones were already mere worldly possessions.

The most important was realm!

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up and he said in surprise, “Could it be that Senior Flutterfeather already ...”

Flutterfeather laughed heartily and said, “That’s right! For so many years, Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s Empyrean Pilljade has always suppressed this Empyrean. The Cloudpill Summit this time, this Empyrean can finally lift my head up high!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Congratulations, Senior Flutterfeather!”

Ancestor Realm!

This was the realm that all alchemists yearned for even in their dreams!

But this door blocked countless alchemy geniuses outside of it.

Even for Ye Yuan, he benefited a great deal from the alchemy battle with Empyrean Flutterfeather. But wanting to break through to the Ancestor Realm was also not something overnight. It could be seen how difficult this hurdle was.

For Empyrean Flutterfeather to be able to break through this shackle, he would be a true Alchemy Dao leviathan in the future.

Furthermore, after reaching Ancestor Realm, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s realm would no longer be an obstruction.

Breaking through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor was also just a matter of time.

Flutterfeather laughed loudly and said, “Eh, don’t keep on calling me as a senior. Although you’re just at the True God Realm, your alchemy strength isn’t weaker than this Empyrean’s. In the future, you’re bound to step into becoming an Alchemy God. In the future, you can just call me Brother Flutterfeather!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and called, “Brother Flutterfeather!”

Flutterfeather smiled and said, “Younger Brother Ye Yuan, this Cloudpill Summit is indeed a grand event of the Southern Border. Each time it’s organized, not only do exceptional talents come forth in large numbers, but all kinds of rare spirit medicines and pill formulas also emerge in endless streams. After you settle the matters here, you can go over and experience it first hand. You won’t be disappointed.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “With Brother Flutterfeather saying so, Ye Yuan somewhat can’t wait for it. Fine as well; after this matter is settled, I’ll go over.”

Flutterfeather nodded and said, “This Empyrean just exited seclusion, so there are still many matters to take care of. When the time comes, we’ll rendezvous at Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Brother Flutterfeather, take care.”

...

The four great Empyreans agreeing to have gathered in the city was originally just doing it for the occasion and giving Ye Yuan some face.

But who knew that their stay lasted a month’s time, not willing to leave even if they were driven out.

The Dreamlike Wine that Ye Yuan brewed made the few great Empyreans enjoy so much that they forgot to go home, abandoning themselves to pleasure.

This wine was brewed with a special technique after Ye Yuan broke through to the Origin Pill Realm. It was specifically used to entertain distinguished guests.

Although it was refined with some rank six spirit medicines, the flavor of this wine was incomparably sweet and mellow, bringing back endless aftertastes.

Even if the few great Empyreans had vast experiences, they were also brought into submission by Ye Yuan’s wine.

Only then did they know why even Flutterfeather was so polite toward Ye Yuan.

After a month, the four great Empyreans were seriously embarrassed to stay on any longer. Hence, each person brought along ten vats of fine wine and left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City with reluctance.

After a month’s time, Ye Yuan also pretty much settled Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. Hence, he brought along Ning Siyu and stepped onto the road to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.

The present Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s situation was already totally different from back then.

Xuan Yu and the rest of the older generation alchemy powerhouses had long withdrawn from the core of authority at present.

Although there were Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills helping, their potential had long been exhausted, their improvement was naturally also very limited.

On the contrary, it was the young generation whose strength advanced by leaps and bounds.

Right now, Ning Siyu’s alchemy strength had long already surpassed Xuan Yu and her few senior apprentice brothers, becoming a distinguished talent of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s Pill Tower.

The current Ning Siyu was already at the middle-stage Celestial Deity Realm. Her alchemy strength had also already touched the threshold of Dao Realm.

Among the young generation, she had no equal.

Walking along this road, Ye Yuan’s influence on her was immense.

Back then, she had always followed along by Ye Yuan’s side and watched Ye Yuan refine pills. Later, she also obtained Ye Yuan’s personal guidance.

The present Ning Siyu was long already not the Ning Siyu back then.

However, when she heard that Ye Yuan was bringing her to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital, she was still happy like a little girl, dancing for joy.

“My God, this is Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital? Why do I feel that as long as the person is from here, they will know how to refine pills?” Ning Siyu said with curiosity written all over her face.

Ever since entering the city, Ning Siyu could feel that the air suffused with medicinal fragrance.

By the street sides, alchemy battle arenas were seen everywhere. Furthermore, each match had a full house.

Clearly, Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s alchemy atmosphere was already integrated into the lives of ordinary alchemists.

Ye Yuan also nodded and said, “Indeed, the standards of the alchemists here are much higher than at other places. It’s worthy of being the Southern Border’s number one alchemy holy land.”

Ning Siyu pursed her lips and said, “What’s the use even if it’s more impressive? In front of Your Excellency, everything is in vain! Your Excellency is the number one alchemy genius!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and laughed in spite of himself. This lass was already idolizing him blindly now.

Suddenly, a voice sounded out. The person said, “Ooh! What high-sounding sentiments! Such a snotty brat also dares proclaim to be the number one alchemy genius?”

Clearly, Ning Siyu’s words were heard by others, incurring a wave of displeasure.
