Chapter 2302: Dialogue with Ancestor

Above the great all, an old man whose hair and beard were all white slowly walked down from a high position. He then arrived before Ye Yuan.

He made an inviting gesture and said, “Second Sage, please sit.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and sat down with Ye Yuan as guest and host.

The disciples were dumbstruck with astonishment by the old man’s action!

How exalted was their master’s status? Apart from those few old monsters, who could afford to have his elderly self welcome so respectfully.

“Second Sage has already gained enlightenment on Dao?” Ancestor Maplegrove said calmly.

The tone seemed to be probing, but actually, he had long already ascertained it in his heart.

Otherwise, with his status, how could he possibly specially come down and sit down with Ye Yuan as equals?

“I have some enlightenment. Is Ancestor Maplegrove going to teach a thing or two?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“No need. Reaching our level of existence, it’s best to not easily take action. Firstly, spirit medicines are hard to come by. Secondly, our status is like this.” Ancestor Maplegrove directly refused.

“If Ancestor is like this, it makes it very hard for this Ye,” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

“Huhu, this old man knows that Second Sage has other motives. It’s just that exchanging moves with that person isn’t a wise action. This point, you should understand,” Ancestor Maplegrove said with a solemn look.

“This Ye understands, however ... this Ye has nothing to fear.” Ye Yuan said with a nod.

Ancestor Maplegrove shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “Indeed, the newborn calf isn’t afraid of tigers! Except, it probably won’t work with this old man here. Not just this old man here; it probably also won’t work with those other few people there.”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Then it’s truly a pity!”

These two people’s conversation felt like it was inside cloud and fog, but the disciples all understood.

The amount of information was too great!

Firstly, Ye Yuan already reached the level of Dao pill!

Secondly, Ye Yuan was going to challenge Medicine Ancestor!

Thirdly, Master was not willing to fight with Ye Yuan!

No matter which one, it was all information that was like a thunderbolt out of clear sky.

Ancestor Maplegrove was not willing to fight with Ye Yuan because no matter win or lose, it would not benefit him at all.

Moreover, an old monster like him had long already seen things as clearly as viewing a blazing fire, how could he be easily exploited by people?

Previously, it was because he did not know Ye Yuan’s strength. Now, since he already knew, he was naturally not willing to be the one to take the lead.

Lowering his head to Ye Yuan now could be said to be looking on the account of Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s face.

But once they exchanged blows, winning was ought to be. Furthermore, it could prove that Ye Yuan already reached the realm of Dao pill, helping him achieve his aim.

Losing ... that would really be a crushing defeat.

Yun Windborne and the rest had long already fallen into endless shock and were unable to extricate themselves for a long time.

Gaining enlightenment on Dao!

What Dao was gained through enlightenment?

The few of them were not fools, how could they not guess?

Ye Yuan already gained enlightenment on Alchemy Dao source and reached the level of Dao pill. He was the same level of powerhouse as their master already!

But how was this possible?

This fellow who was the same as a child in their eyes actually already stood at the true summit, reaching the realm of ancestor!

This sort of thing, they were not willing to believe. They did not believe it at all.

Especially Yun Windborne, he had already stood at this intersection for god knows how many years already, and was still at a loss on the direction to take.

Only a powerhouse like him could truly understand how difficult it was to take this step.

In the past, he took his time, quietly waiting for the arrival of that day. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

But today, the situation changed drastically!

A latecomer who came no idea how many years later than he did, yet the person actually ran in front of him and sat down with his master to debate on Dao.

This blow was simply incomparable.

Ye Yuan defeating Zhu Tianxiang, they could understand. After all, he was Second Sage.

Ye Yuan defeating Gu Yulong, they could also understand. After all, he was Second Sage.

Even Ye Yuan defeating Yun Windborne, they could still understand. After all, he was Second Sage!

But how did he take this step?

Dao pill!

That was the realm that all alchemists sought from high to low, but could not attain.

The realm that no matter how hard they worked, no matter how they struggled, they could not reach.

This ridiculously young child achieved it!

Right at this time, someone suddenly burst into the hall.

“What happened, Master? W-Why are you here?”

Zhu Tianxiang hurriedly ran in to take a look and suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan was sitting opposite of his own master, conversing happily. This shock was by no means insignificant.

Ye Yuan coming up, shouldn’t he have long been finished off by his senior apprentice brothers?

How ... did he start chatting with his master?

Looking over at his senior apprentice brothers there, each and every one was battered out of their senses, grief-stricken as if bereaved of their parents.

That appearance was like they were stricken dumb with amazement by something.

Just as Zhu Tianxiang was filled with doubts, he heard Ancestor Maplegrove say in a cold voice, “Vile spawn, look what you’ve done! Why haven’t you come over to kneel and apologize to Second Sage!”

Zhu Tianxiang shuddered all over, a look of disbelief as he said, “Master, you’re making me kneel down and apologize to this punk? I-Isn’t this bringing down your elderly self’s prestige?”

Zhu Tianxiang’s talent was extremely high, Ancestor Maplegrove normally doted on him a lot.

Many rules, he would open one eye and close the other.

It was really rare to be as stern as today.

Ancestor Maplegrove’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Why? Master’s words aren’t useful anymore? Or is it that you already feel that you can graduate?”

Zhu Tianxiang’s expression changed wildly, only then knowing that Master was not joking. He was being serious.

Hearing the meaning of his words, if he did not kneel down and apologize, he would likely be expelled.

Thud!

Zhu Tianxiang knelt down in front of Ye Yuan with a look of unwillingness.

“Master, I’m unconvinced! He ... Based on what?” Zhu Tianxiang was still unwilling as he said.

“Insolence! Second Sage is an existence in the same generation as Master. You’re a junior in front of him! Is this kneel wrong? Moreover, you fool! Being made use of by people and don’t know it, and even want to lead the fire onto Master’s head. With this, the entire Cloud Summer Mountain became a joke. Are you satisfied?” Ancestor Maplegrove said with an angry face.

Zhu Tianxiang was still unconvinced, but he heard Yun Windborne say with waned interest, “Little Junior Brother, don’t argue anymore! Second Sage has already comprehended Alchemy Dao source and is an ancestor-level powerhouse like Master. This kneel of yours, he can bear it!”

“What?! He ... He ... This is impossible!” Zhu Tianxiang’s entire body trembled violently, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was filled with horror.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I gave you the chance. Originally, it would have been dropped with an apology. Now ... it isn’t that simple anymore.”

Ancestor Maplegrove’s expression was very ugly now. Since Ye Yuan was an ancestor class powerhouse, then it was naturally impossible for this matter to be brushed off so easily.

Otherwise, if Ye Yuan brazenly and shamelessly insisted on challenging him, he still had to answer the challenge.

At that time, the entire Cloud Summer Mountain would really become a laughingstock.

If Zhu Tianxiang apologized, Ye Yuan would have nothing to say. At that time, he naturally would not announce anything to the outside world.

With a few sentences, Ancestor Maplegrove could already tell that even though Ye Yuan’s edge was extremely sharp, he was not some young and inexperienced hothead.

On the contrary, he was even wiser than these disciples of his!

Of course, with him reaching this level of realm at a young age, how could he be a fool?

Suddenly, there was a fluctuation in space, one figure after another stepped out of the void.

Seeing these arrivals, Zhu Tianxiang’s expression changed even more!
