Chapter 1564 The True Strength of Dao Realm!

Xuan Yu did not make any sound by the side. He wanted to see what means Ye Yuan had.

Although he did not like fighting, Deercry was merely a jumping clown in his eyes.

Ye Yuan’s suggestion made him look forward to it very much.

Lu Yi’s strength, he was all too clear. It was still a long way off from Deercry’s.

Although Deercry’s personality was a little scoundrelly, he also had real skill. Otherwise, it would also be impossible to become the Pill Tower’s high-level deacon.

Ye Yuan glimpsed at Deercry and said impatiently, “So much rubbish, are you here to squabble? You just say whether you dare or not! If you don’t dare, don’t put on the airs of a senior, who the hell are you?”

Deercry’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Compete then, will this old man still be scared of you all, these juniors? But ... what if this old man wins?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Didn’t you come to stand up for your disciple? If Lu Yi loses, I’ll close down the Miracle Hand Parlor and scram out of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.”

Deercry secretly cursed Ye Yuan for being razor-tongued, each sentence making people as uncomfortable as having eaten a fly.

His face fell and he said in a cold voice, “That’s what you said! If this old man wins, I still want Lu Yi to kowtow to me and admit his mistake in public!”

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said coolly, “You choose the medicinal pill, I need two hour’s time! Of course, the medicinal pill that you choose must be within the scope of Lu Yi’s ability!”

Buzz!

Ye Yuan’s words made the surroundings explode all at once.

Even Xuan Yu also revealed an incomparably surprised expression.

Letting the other party choose the medicinal pill, this was handing the initiative to the other party’s hands.

This kind of competition, whoever picked the medicinal pill would undoubtedly have the advantage. Because the medicinal pill that each person was good at was different. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Deercry’s strength was above Lu Yi’s in the first place. Now, even letting the other party pick the medicinal pill, wasn’t this courting death?

“Is Master Ye crazy? This ... Isn’t this putting the neck against other people’s blade?”

“I admit that Master Ye is very formidable, but this already isn’t rampant, this is seeking death!”

“I really don’t know how Master Ye thinks, to actually hand the initiative to the other party to exchange for two hour’s time. What are two hours ... enough for?”

...

Deercry was first stunned, then immediately laughed his head off and said, “Hahaha ... brat, you’re really someone ignorant who’s fearless. Do you really take yourself to be someone notable? Letting this old man choose the medicinal pill, this old man will toy you to death!”

He turned to look at Lu Yi and said smugly, “Lu brat, I heard that you’re studying the Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill recently? Why don’t ... we compete in this?”

The moment these words came out, Lu Yi’s face became ugly to the extreme, wishing to pounce up and bite Deercry to death with one bite.

At the same time, he also somewhat blamed Ye Yuan in his heart too.

This kid really blindly made a decision.

Now, things were great, there was not even a trace of hope anymore!

“No way! Deercry, you’re bullying people here!” Ding Xun said furiously.

Third Senior Brother also said anxiously, “You clearly know that Eldest Senior Brother can’t refine the Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill and still deliberately picked this medicinal pill to compete with him. Simply shameless!”

The more anxious these few apprentice brothers got, the more pleased with himself he became. He laughed loudly and said, “Heh, it’s this brat who let this old man pick the medicinal pill. Why, now that this old man picked it, you guys aren’t willing again? Could the Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill not meet the requirements?”

Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill was a consumable-type medicinal pill. It could help martial artists increase their ability to comprehend Great Dao for a short time and was extremely popular.

But the refinement difficulty of this medicinal pill was notoriously great.

Although it was an initial-rank Four-star divine pill, many middle-rank Four-star Alchemy Gods could not refine it.

Lu Yi’s talent was pretty good, but the time he spent immersed in Four-star divine pills was not long after all.

Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill, Lu Yi had already researched for a long time, but he did not make much progress all along.

Up till now, he could not refine it either.

The difficulty of the Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill was also considerable for Deercry.

But the problem was, he could still refine this medicinal pill.

On this point, he completely trashed Lu Yi.

But Ye Yuan brushed it over and said, “No matter, just it then. The spirit medicines, you guys prepare yourselves. I don’t have it here. You guys ... follow me inside.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around and entered the inner hall.

Xuan Yu’s group of people exchanged glances, but they still followed Ye Yuan in.

“Master Ye, I ... can’t refine the Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill! How to compete still?” The moment he entered the door, Lu Yi said anxiously.

“Yeah. Master Ye, you’re also too reckless. Even if we really want to compete, how can you take the initiative to give up choosing the medicinal pill?” Ding Xun also said.

“Alright, haven’t competed and already lost!” Fourth Senior Brother said unhappily.

Only Ning Siyu’s beautiful eyes swiveled around, seemingly thinking of something, and could not help faintly somewhat look forward to it.

“Alright, alright, what are each and every one of you doing? Since Master Ye dared to say so, he must have nothing to fear with something to back him up. You guys stop worrying about it. See what he says!” Ning Siyu said.

Ye Yuan smiled at Xuan Yu and said, “Didn’t you want me to help you teach disciples? You guys will get off cheap together. That old punk, I’m very pissed off looking at him too!”

Xuan Yu’s eyes lit up and he said, “Two hours’ time, could it be that Master Ye is going to refine the Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill?”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Even if I reach Dao Realm, it’s also impossible to refine a Four-star divine pill right now.”

Everyone was disappointed. Xuan Yu said, “Then ...”

Ye Yuan said, “The Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill, I’m unable to refine. But the Five Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill is nothing difficult.”

Lu Yi’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Five Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill ... I can refine too! Even if it doesn’t reach Master Ye’s level, it wouldn’t be too poor either. But rank four divine pills are two completely different things from rank three divine pills!”

Ye Yuan looked at Lu Yi and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Is that so? Do you understand Alchemy Dao like this? Great Dao connects to the heavens, interlinked and connected. Rank four divine pills are much more profound than rank three divine pills, this is true. But the same type of medicinal pill is passed down the same lineage. The Dao contained within them have highly similar aspects. If you think that rank four divine pills are higher level than rank three divine pills and isolate them separately, then you’ve made a grave error!”

Lu Yi was stunned when he heard, but he knew that what Ye Yuan said was right.

But the internal connection between medicinal pills was not so easy to link together.

Actually, when studying this Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill, Xuan Yu said this to him before as well. But he could not do it.

Everyone had a pondering look. Ye Yuan came before the medicinal cauldron, retrieving a Five Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill from inside his storage ring, he opened his mouth and said, “There’s only one chance, look closely!”

Suddenly, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body suddenly changed, becoming sacred all at once.

Inside the entire medicine refining room teemed with the aura of Dao.

But this time, it was goodness knows how many times stronger than when they were refining pills previously!

Ye Yuan’s entire person seemed to have transformed into a region of chaos, giving people an unreal feeling.

At this moment, Ye Yuan seemingly incarnated to become the master of creation, becoming incomparably surreal.

Xuan Yu’s gaze turned intent and he cried out in shock, “This ... This ... Turns out that this is the true strength of the Dao Realm!”
