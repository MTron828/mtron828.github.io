Chapter 2564: Save Some Strength!

“Is that so?”

Ye Yuan’s hand exerted force, that woman spat out a mouthful of black blood with a spurt.

When Second Prince and the emperor saw this scene, their expressions changed wildly.

Damn it!

This Ye Yuan was unbelievably inflexible.

With this, he offended the envoy badly.

Cheng Chongshan’s expression changed and he said, “Boy, you dare?!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Say … sorry!”

Cheng Chongshan’s eyes wanted to spew fire, he gritted his teeth and said to Lin Lan, “I can apologize, but do you think that you can bear it?”

Lin Lan stood up swayingly, his gaze revealing a look of fear and he said to Ye Yuan, “Master, why don’t …”

Ye Yuan cut Lin Lan off right away and said, “My, Ye Yuan’s, disciple, there’s nothing that can’t be shouldered! If you feel that you can’t bear it, you can leave right now!”

Lin Lan’s entire body trembled, suddenly recalling back then at the Tang Family.

This master was that unyielding!

Even if you were the bloody Jade Emperor, you could not deal with my people!

A warm current flowed through in Lin Lan’s heart.

Such a master was worth following!

All of a sudden, his gaze turned sharp, and he said in a solemn voice, “You just apologize, this old man can bear it!”

Cheng Chongshan gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Good! Very good! This envoy wants to see how a trash like you can bear it! I. Am. Sorry!”

Lin Lan said coolly, “It’s. Fine! Also, I’m not the nation teacher. My master is the nation teacher! I can’t save them, but it doesn’t mean that my master can’t save them!”

Cheng Chongshan’s gaze turned intent, looking at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly.

When he first saw Lin Lan, he directly overlooked Ye Yuan.

How could a middle Lesser Sublime Heaven possibly be the nation teacher?

“Rubbish! I heard that Eastward’s nation teacher is a grade two heavenly alchemist. How can it possibly be him?” Cheng Chongshan said in a great rage.

Lin Lan said, “More than a year ago, this old man had a wager with Master. In the end, I was completely defeated at his hands. Ever since then, I’ve respected him as my master. This position of nation teacher is naturally his too!”

Cheng Chongshan three people had been busy with the ancient tomb all along and did not hear that there were actually so many twists and turns.

A grade two heavenly alchemist actually acknowledged a middle Lesser Sublime Heaven as master, and he was even an ascender!

Suddenly, he burst out laughing and said, “Trash, are you kidding me? That kid is an ascender. So how can he possibly be a heavenly alchemist? In my view, your Eastward Country is really tired of living from top to bottom!”

The moment these words came out, the emperor and Second Prince’s countenances suddenly changed.

Clearly, Cheng Chongshan was genuinely enraged!

“I don’t know whether or not they are tired of living. But you’re probably tired of living!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Cheng Chongshan sneered and said, “Ascender, are you threatening this envoy? Do you know who this envoy is?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Who you are, has nothing to do with me. But I know that compared to the two of them, you’re in a little more danger. In less than three days, you’ll die beyond a doubt!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of everyone present changed wildly.

Cheng Chongshan’s aura was vibrant. He did not have any appearance of being injured or poisoned. So how could he face certain death?

Cheng Chongshan laughed loudly and said, “Boy, are you scaring me? Do you think that this envoy is so easy to scare? Moreover, what the hell do you, an ascender, know about alchemy, to dare spout a stream of empty rhetoric here?”

Ye Yuan shrugged and did not have the intention of arguing.

And right at this time, that woman beside Ye Yuan actually slowly woke up.

Cheng Chongshan’s expression changed and he was immediately ecstatic. He rushed straight to the bedside and helped the woman up.

“Junior Apprentice Sister Wu Shuang, you’re awake! H-How do you feel?” Cheng Chongshan said agitatedly.

Wu Shuang’s essence, energy, and spirit was much better than just now. She nodded slightly and said, “M-Much better!”

Cheng Chongshan said with pleasant surprise, “That’s good! That’s good then!?Eh,?hang on! Your situation was clearly deteriorating non-stop just now, how did you suddenly become much better?”

Wu Shuang said weakly, “I don’t know either! Just now, the poison energy within my body was already almost attacking my heart. But suddenly, a bout of power forced it out. I spat a mouthful of blood and felt much better.”

Cheng Chongshan’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan with amazement.

It turned out that that threatening earlier was actually treating Wu Shuang!

Cheng Chongshan was shocked in his heart. In merely a few short breaths of work just now, Ye Yuan could already control the direction of the poison energy within Wu Shuang’s body, and force it out of the body? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

This kind of means was truly fantastical!

At this time, his underestimation was long already put away. What replaced it was a hint of solemnness.

By the side, Lin Lan, the emperor, and Second Prince, all had shocked faces.

This means was truly fantastical!

They all knew that Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao was incredible, but they did not know that Ye Yuan’s medical skills were actually so heaven-defying too.

Everyone thought that Ye Yuan was forcing Cheng Chongshan to give in just now, who would have expected that he was actually treating Wu Shuang!

Too strong!

“Boy, treat Junior Apprentice Sister Wu Shuang well, your benefits won’t be dispensed with!” Cheng Chongshan said.

Although he knew that Ye Yuan was formidable, he still had a lofty and aloof appearance.

In his eyes, ascenders were outliers. They not worthy of respect at all.

When Ye Yuan heard that, his eyebrows also furrowed. Then he said coolly, “This is your attitude of asking someone for help?”

Cheng Chongshan frowned and said, “Why? An ascender like you, this envoy not killing you is already showing grace. What does making you treat a bit count for? In this True Yang Heavenly Domain, without my Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s protection, an ascender like you will find it hard to take a single step!”

Cheng Chongshan looked down on Ye Yuan’s identity as an ascender from the bottom of his heart.

Compared to Eastward Country these people, Cheng Chongshan’s feeling of standing high above the masses was even stronger.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Since that’s the case, then there’s nothing to talk about. Lin Lan, let’s go!”

The emperor’s expression changed, and he hurriedly stopped Ye Yuan and said, “Nation Teacher, what the envoy said is right! Without the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s protection, ascenders will really find it hard to take a single step! In True Yang Heavenly Domain, ascenders are aliens! Only in my remote land of Eastward Country, will there be a little less hostility towards ascenders. You just have to take action and treat the envoys, and they will definitely protect you! Otherwise, once the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect is enraged, my Eastward Country can’t protect you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Your Majesty, not that I’m not giving you face. This Ye doesn’t need other people’s protection and also doesn’t like to chase after people to treat their ailments. This Ye isn’t so cheap yet! Asking me to see a patient, also can. Show your sincerity. Also, Your Majesty, this Ye only came today on the account of your face. After today, those who want to receive medical help, come to Nation Teacher Manor yourselves!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan was about to bring Lin Lan and leave.

“Humph! Refusing a toast only to drink to a forfeit!” Cheng Chongshan gave a cold snort, his figure swaying and blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan did not even raise his eyebrows and said coolly, “Stop posturing here, save some strength! The faster you move, the faster you’ll die! Your time is running out. If you want to live, put aside your baffling sense of superiority! Also, don’t block in front of me, if I want to kill someone, you can’t stop me!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan did not care about Cheng Chongshan’s deadpan face at all and walked right past him.

Clearly, the threat worked very well!
