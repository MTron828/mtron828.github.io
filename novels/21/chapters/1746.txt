Chapter 1750 Sky Character No. 6 Room

“Eh, a newcomer is here. My God! Arranging him to stay in the Sky Character No. 6 Room, how big a grudge is there against him?!”

“The last time a kid entered the Sky Character No. 6 Room, his entire person was burned to black charcoal the next day, crying that he wanted to go home. It tickled us badly.”

“Heh heh, there’s a good show to watch again. Come, let’s go take a look.”

...

Walking into the room, three gazes shot over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan looked at them and said with a slight smile, “How do you do? I’m new here. I’m called Ye Yuan.”

No one answered him. Their eyes all were very unfriendly.

Ye Yuan naturally did not mind either and walked to a vacant spot on his own.

At this time, a burly man sitting on the bed spoke up.

“Who permitted you to sleep there?”

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard and said, “Not sleeping here, where do I sleep?”

The burly man nudged his mouth, pointing outside the door, and said, “At the corridor!”

Ye Yuan understood in his heart, these few guys were clearly taking him down a notch.

But how could he, Ye Yuan, be so easy to bully?

He nodded his head and said, “There? Indeed pretty good!”

When the burly man saw that Ye Yuan was so ‘sensible’, he grinned and said, “Since you know that it’s pretty good, why haven’t you scrammed over yet? This dormitory, Senior Apprentice Brother Hu Feng has the final say. Only when he allows you to come in can you come in.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned to the lazy young man lying on the bed.

Judging from his outfit, he should be a high-level priest apprentice of the temple.

The Priest Temple recruited priest apprentices once every ten years. Even though the people who passed each time were very few, over the years, there were still quite a few priest trainees.

According to the Priest Temple’s rules, only those who passed the priest test within a thousand years could stay in the temple.

As for those who kept failing the Priest Temple, they would be assigned to posts in various major capital cities or other places.

All in all, they could not stay in the temple anymore.

This Hu Feng was likely a veteran here.

Hearing the burly man’s words, Ye Yuan said coolly, “So nice, Senior Brother better go and stay there. This little brother is new here and had best be inconvenienced a bit, it’s better to stay inside.”

When Hu Feng heard Ye Yuan’s words, a hint of a mocking smile flashed across the corners of his mouth.

At this time, quite a few people already gathered around outside. Seeing this scene, each and every one of them was extremely excited.

“Ha, this kid is indeed a hothead. Tie Zhao’s hot-temper is about to explode right away, right?”

“Reckon that this kid will be burned to black charcoal straight away too! Tie Zhao’s fire controlling technique, apart from Hu Feng, no one can suppress him!”

That burly man called Tie Zhao froze when he heard that and said in a great rage, “A junior priest apprentice who just entered dared to mess with me? Heh, not showing you some colors, you won’t know how deep the temple’s waters are!”

Done talking, the burly man’s palm urged. A cluster of dark blue flames turned into a fire snake, shooting over towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan sighed slightly in his heart. This fellow really did not know the immensity of heaven and earth, to actually play fire in front of his ancestor who was an expert on fire.

Wasn’t this looking for abuse?

It was only to see Ye Yuan casually grab. That fire snake was directly caught in his palm.

Ye Yuan flipped his palm, that fire snake jumped with incomparable joy.

It was as if this divine fire was his own.

Hu Feng’s originally slightly narrowed eyes suddenly opened, his eyes seemingly looking shock.

Tie Zhao’s fire controlling technique, he was very clear. Ordinary people were not his match at all.

Now, it was actually easily resolved by this kid.

Tie Zhao himself opened his eyes wide, disbelief written all over his face.

Ye Yuan casually grabbed and he lost control of the divine fire!

“Merely thus!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Boss, this punk isn’t simple!” Tie Zhao said solemnly.

Hu Feng snorted coldly and said, “Entering the Sky Character No. 6 Room, even a dragon has to coil for me! Attack!”

With a word of command, three fire dragons split into three directions, flying towards Ye Yuan in unison. The temperature in the room suddenly rose.

Especially Hu Feng, his fire controlling technique was truly impressive. The fire dragon was clearly much stronger than the other two.

Ye Yuan’s face changed, both hands rapidly forming seals, and actually barely blocked the three fire dragons one-on-three.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s strained appearance, Hu Feng smiled coldly and said, “I thought that you had three heads and six arms, aren’t you still submitting obediently? Punk, I changed my mind, tonight, you’re sleeping in the latrine!”

Tie Zhao laughed loudly and said, “Brat, to dare provoke Boss Hu, you’re really asking for a beating! But to be able to force Boss Hu to personally take action, you can be sufficiently proud.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan suddenly beamed and changed to a relaxed appearance as he said, “I gave way to you guys, so don’t take it seriously. This latrine, you guys had better go sleep yourself there.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s fingers moved rapidly. The three fire dragons actually turned the spearhead and flew toward their owners!

Hu Feng three people were currently being pleased with themselves. Seeing this scene, their faces could not help changing drastically.

Want to run, but it was already too late.

Bang!

Three figures became three black charcoals.

The three people were pitch-black from head to toe, leaving only a pair of eyes still blinking.

The residual head had yet to dissipate. Smoke kept curling on top of the three people’s heads, like whole roast ducks.

“How is this possible? Senior Apprentice Brother Hu Feng actually lost in a fire battle!”

“More than just lost, their own divine fires were actually reverse-controlled by people!”

“Who on earth is this brat, one-versus-three and he actually completely won the other party!”

...

A wave of exclamations rose outside the house, being dumbstruck with astonishment by this scene before their eyes.

Hu Feng’s fire controlling technique was ranked at the top among all of the priest apprentices.

Today, he actually lost to a kid who just entered!

“Pffft!”

Hu Feng spat out a mouthful of smoke and bellowed, “Attack for me, shred this punk!”

Ye Yuan did not deal a heavy blow. He just put the three into a sorry state, burning all of their hair from head to toe.

At this time, Hu Feng was already unbelievably furious.

With an order, the three people pounced over as ferocious as tigers and wolves.

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh and said coolly, “Can’t fight with fire and want to use force? A pity, you guys miscalculated!”

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

It was only to hear three loud noises. Three figures shot back in reverse, colliding until the entire house was in a mess.

With this, everyone was stupefied.

These three people, Hu Feng was late-stage rank four, while the other two were both peak middle-stage rank four.

Such a line-up actually could not even receive a move from Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan looked at the three people indifferently and said, “The three of you know what to do?”

“G-Got it! We ... We’ll sleep in the latrine!” Hu Feng wailed.

His face was pitch-black, unable to see his expression.

But no need to see and one would also know that his current expression must be very ugly.

“Know and you’re still not moving? Do you want me to send you over?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Yes, yes, yes!”

The three people said in unison and scrambled out of the door, and really ran over in the direction of the latrine.

Seeing these three people’s wretched back views, everyone was stupefied.

“Goodness me, I guessed the beginning but didn’t guess the ending.”

“Who could have thought that the overbearing Hu Feng would actually have this day?”

“This newcomer is so formidable! Regardless of whether alchemy or martial arts, it’s completely crushing!”
