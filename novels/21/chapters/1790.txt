1794 Drumming Method That Made People Don“t Know Whether to Laugh or Cry

“Zhao Shu, tier three! Passed the assessment!”

“Zhao Zhao, tier four! Passed the assessment!”

The moment Deacon Hong’s voice fell, it immediately aroused a wave of exclamations.

“Zhao Zhao actually reached tier four. Him being called the Devil Elephant lineage’s number one person indeed wasn’t simply boasted out.”

“In comparison, Thundercloud Sect’s Han Yong is much worse.”

“The genius that the Thundercloud Sect nurtured this time is too weak!”

...

The grudges between Celestial Deity level sects were not some secret here.

Everyone all came from Celestial Deity level sects. Regarding Zhao Zhao and Han Yong’s matters, everyone was very clear.

Han Yong’s expression was very ugly. He thought that Zhao Zhao would at most be peak tier three. He did not expect that Zhao Zhao actually reached tier four.

This way, the pressure he was experiencing was very great.

It did not matter if he lost, but people would say that the Thundercloud Sect was inferior to the Devil Elephant Sect.

In reality, the two great sects each had their own merits. It was just that the Devil Elephant Sect developed rapidly these few years, and already faintly showed trends of overshadowing the Thundercloud Sect.

Therefore, Han Yong did not want to lose even more.

Zhao Zhao landed from midair and deliberately passed by Han Yong and said with a sneer, “Han Yong, I’ve already broken through to tier four. I know that you’re not convinced, so don’t get lower than this!”

Han Yong’s expression changed and opened his mouth, wanting to refute. But he truly did not have any confidence.

Putting out the big talk now, if he could not achieve it in a while, that would be even more humiliating.

At this time, Ye Yuan suddenly spoke up, “You rest assured, when Brother Han goes up in a while, he’ll only be higher than you and not lower than you.”

The Zhao three brothers and Han Yong were implacable enemies. He came down only because he wanted to show off a bit to Han Yong, so he did not notice that Ye Yuan was actually still here.

Hearing Ye Yuan speak, Zhao Zhao’s expression could not help changing, his eyes revealing a look of fear.

“Humph! W-With just the likes of him? Don’t I know how capable he is?” Zhao Zhao raised his neck and forcefully argued.

He was afraid of Ye Yuan, but it did not mean that he was scared of Han Yong.

After fighting for a little less than half of their lifetimes, could he still not know Han Yong’s strength?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “What this Jadelight Drum is testing is potential and not strength. Your strength is indeed greater than his, but it doesn’t mean that your potential is greater than his.”

The moment Zhao Zhao heard, he said disdainfully, “Just him? If he can surpass me, I’ll pluck my head off for him to kick as a ball!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No need for that. If he can surpass you, yell in front of so many people that the Devil Elephant Sect is no good three times! Do you dare or not!”

When Zhao Zhao heard Ye Yuan’s words, his expression could not help but become stifled.

This was betting with the sect’s reputation, it was not up to him to not be cautious.

When Ye Yuan saw his appearance, he said coolly, “Looks like you don’t have much confidence in yourself. Therefore, when people haven’t appeared on the stage yet, don’t posture here. There are plenty of people stronger than you!”

Seeing Ye Yuan stump Zhao Zhao with a few words, Han Yong could not help being greatly excited.

He naturally knew that he could not beat Zhao Zhao. But being able to make him feel deflated, he was also very happy.

Zhao Zhao smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “You’re goading me? Do you think that I’d fall for it so easily?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Regardless whether I’m goading or not, you’re a gutless loser! You don’t dare to bet, isn’t it still because you don’t have the confidence? You look, I dare to say that if I lose to you, I’ll commit suicide in front of the Shadowmoon Sect’s mountain gates to atone for my crime! But you, don’t dare!”

Zhao Zhao’s expression became incomparably ugly. Of course you freaking dared to say so!

How could a peerless genius who fused spatial law and Sword Dao law possibly lose to him?

This guy was even stronger than Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin!

“Hahaha ... You’re indeed a loser, to not even dare to agree to this! If you don’t dare to agree, then scram to one side, don’t be an eyesore here! Is tier four very impressive?” Han Yong also laughed loudly and said.

Being looked down upon by Ye Yuan, he felt like he had no temper.

But being despised by Han Yong like this, he could not quite endure it anymore.

“Han Yong, I dare to bet, then do you dare? If you lose, you’ll also shout Thundercloud Sect is no good three times! Do you have the guts?” Zhao Zhao said with a cold smile.

Han Yong’s expression choked up when he heard this. It was as if he had his throat clutched.

When Zhao Zhao saw the situation, he said to Ye Yuan with a cold smile, “See? It’s him who doesn’t have the guts, not that I don’t have the guts!”

The moment Han Yong heard this, his head heated up. He said, “Compete then, who’s scared of who?”

Zhao Zhao was startled inwardly, but he thought about it, it was impossible for him to lose to Han Yong. His face could not help turning dark as he said, “Okay, I want to see whether or not you can really turn into a phoenix from a hen! I’m going to make your Thundercloud Sect lose all of its face in front of everyone.”

This matter was settled like this. But Han Yong’s heart was racing.

He truly did not have much confidence in winning Zhao Zhao.

“Ye Yuan, you went a bit too overboard! If Han Yong loses, he won’t be able to even lift his head in the Shadowmoon Sect in the future! He’ll become a common target for scorn!” Yang Fan said in a solemn voice.

Clearly, he was enraged.

Yang Fan and Han Yong’s relationship was very close. Seeing Ye Yuan incite the wager this time, the fury in his heart blazed.

If Han Yong lose, the Thundercloud lineage’s people would thoroughly cast him aside, and view him as the sect’s traitor. In the future, he’d be alone and helpless in the Shadowmoon Sect. This was not as simple as yelling three times.

The future implications were too great.

Saying something unpleasant, this wager might directly ruin Han Yong’s future.

Furthermore, Yang Fan really could not see any hopes of victory for Han Yong.

The method that Ye Yuan said he would teach Han Yong, Yang Fan was very pessimistic about it too.

If casually teaching could defy the heavens, then wouldn’t the Shadowmoon Sect’s assessment become a joke?

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “You turn it around and think about it. If Han Yong wins, Zhao Zhao and brothers won’t be able to lift their heads in the Shadowmoon Sect in the future.”

Right at this time, a miscellaneous affairs disciple shouted, “Next one, Han Yong!”

Han Yong’s expression changed, a pair of legs like they grew roots, and actually did not dare to walk out.

When Zhao Zhao saw this scene, he was even more certain in his heart that Han Yong could not do it!

Originally, Han Yong was already inferior to him.

Ye Yuan lightly patted Han Yong’s shoulder and said with a smile, “Remember, use the method that I taught you to drum the drum, you won’t lose.”

Han Yong’s heart was somewhat racing as he said, “This ... Can this really work?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head with an indifferent look.

Now that it was hard to dismount from a tiger’s back, Han Yong was aware that he had no way out already too. Steeling his heart, he leaped and arrived up in the sky.

Han Yong suddenly turned around, back facing the Jadelight Drum, his abdomen ballooning more and more.

When everyone saw this scene, their faces became extremely fascinating.

Zhao Zhao’s complexion flushed even redder as he let out a big laugh and said, “Hahaha! You’re really killing me with laughter! This guy wouldn’t be thinking of using a fart to sound the Jadelight Drum, right?”

Baili Qingyan’s face turned red and she could not help turning away.

Below, waves of ridicules also came over.

Yang Fan was angered until his expression was livid and he questioned Ye Yuan, “This is the idea that you gave him? You want to make him become the laughingstock of the world?”

Puuuu ...

Yang Fan’s voice had yet to face when a loud fart could be heard clearly in the entire plaza.

However, everyone’s smiles had yet to fade away when an even more resounding drum sound spread out!

Dong!
