Chapter 2985: Divine Dragon Envoy’s Invitation!

“Have you heard? There’s a new guy that appeared recently who’s mountain challenging everywhere. He has already taken on the top 100 powerhouses on the Mountain Challenger List!”

“I heard it too. This guy is fierce! Dragon City Tribe’s Scarletplume made his world debut over 200 years and never had a single defeat. In the end, he was taken down by him. Too freaking impressive!”

“His first stop was the Dragon City Tribe, taking on three cities in a row! After defeating Scarletplume, he went to challenge quite a few in the top ten, and he won all of them in the end! Where did this guy pop out from?”

“This guy is a freak. He’s clearly a human, but his bloodline already reached heaven qian grade, too terrifying!”

“I heard that his next target is our Dragon Abyss Tribe!”

“Heh,?no matter how formidable he is, he’s not Long Yi’s match too! For so many years, how many people wanted to challenge his position? They all ended up losing! Lord Long Yi’s strength is simply unbeatable in Emperor Cloud Heaven!”

“That’s for sure! Just based on this punk, he dares to challenge Lord Long Yi’s position too, simply a fool’s talk!”

… …

Two years had already passed since challenging Scarletplume.

In these two years, Ye Yuan mountain challenged everywhere, virtually picking on East Billow Region’s powerful tribes without tasting a single defeat!

Ye Yuan’s reputation had already spread throughout the East Billow Region.

He was different from others, so it caused a great sensation.

When others made a challenge, the majority started challenging the weak ones, slowly going toward stronger opponents.

But Ye Yuan challenged Dragon City Tribe the moment he came up.

Following that, he consecutively challenged another ten powerful tribes.

Of the powerful ones, there were even the top five on the Mountain Challenger List!

This kind of battle achievement, it would not do even if you did not want it to cause a stir.

Of course, this was also the effect that Ye Yuan wanted to achieve.

Ranking at the top of the Mountain Challenger List within the shortest time!

The surrounding people’s conversation landed in the ears of a male and female, two youngsters.

“Right now, people in the entire East Billow Region are all singing praises of your deeds. Shouldn’t you be a little proud? You’re really hypocritical,” Feng Qingxuan said.

Ye Yuan was very annoyed, ignoring her.

This woman followed him for two years just like that. He could not even shake her off.

His movements were too big. He had no way of shaking her off at all.

Later on, this woman even broke through to Emperor Vast Heaven. Ye Yuan was even more unable to shake her off.

“I heard that this Long Yi is heaven qian grade bloodline, his combat strength closing in on Emperor Vast Heaven! Do you think that you’re his match?”

“This season’s Mountain Challenger List is going to be out in these two days, right? With your battle achievements, it’s enough to rank in the top five!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

… …

From start to end, it was all Feng Qingxuan alone talking.

Dragon Abyss Tribe was very large. The members were also very strong. The two of them had already arrived at the outer periphery of the tribe.

Recently, the Dragon Abyss Tribe gathered a large batch of powerhouses. These people all wanted to watch Ye Yuan and Long Yi’s fight.

Therefore, dragons and snakes were mingling together in the outer periphery of the Dragon Abyss Tribe.

Ye Yuan’s appearance naturally did not get too many people’s attention.

The objective of coming here was naturally to challenge the Dragon Abyss Tribe’s powerhouses.

Mountain Challenger List’s first place Long Yi and second place Wu Fa were both in the Dragon Abyss Tribe!

As for the third place, he had already been beaten down by Ye Yuan!

Actually, this was not anything surprising.

Two years ago, Scarletplume comprehended the Spatial Eight Styles. His strength was already sufficient to enter the top three.

Ye Yuan directly defeated him. Ye Yuan naturally had the strength to enter the top three.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd. Someone shouted at the top of his voice, “The new season’s Mountain Challenger List is out! The new season’s Mountain Challenger List is out!”

With this, everyone was boiling over with excitement.

Even Ye Yuan was also greatly stirred. He did not expect that the Mountain Challenger List actually came out at this critical juncture.

The publication of the Mountain Challenger List did not have too many rules.

As for who published it, nobody knew either.

But the majority speculated that the Mountain Challenger List was published by the Divine Dragon Envoy.

It was just that this version remained to be confirmed.

The Divine Dragon Envoy was very mysterious. There were not many who had seen his true face before.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, a series of exclamations erupted in the crowd.

“How is this possible? Did the Mountain Challenger List make a mistake?”

“Ye Yuan and Long Yi hadn’t even fought before. What right does he have to rank first place?”

“Unfair! This isn’t fair! We strongly request Ye Yuan and Long Yi to fight!”

… …

The crowd instantly exploded.

This was the Dragon Abyss Tribe’s territory. The vast majority of the people were all Long Yi’s worshipers.

Currently, the person that they worshiped was actually judged to have lost before even fighting. It made them extremely displeased.

Some people were already questioning the authority of the Mountain Challenger List.

Ye Yuan and Feng Qingxuan exchanged glances, both seeing the shock in the other party’s eyes.

He became first on the Mountain Challenger List?

Ye Yuan spent some heavenly crystals and got a copy of the Mountain Challenger List too.

The moment he looked, sure enough, his own name was ranked in the first place!

Meanwhile, Long Yi’s name was ranked second place.

Of course, this was just the position of the name being listed out. There was not even a sequence number in front of their names.

Only all the way until the 11th name was there a sequence number.

First place, Dragon Abyss Tribe, Long Lei!

Ye Yuan knew this person. He was originally number nine on the Mountain Challenger List.

Now, he was actually squeezed to the 11th position!

Ye Yuan knew that the people without a ranking on the Mountain Challenger List were people who were taken fancy upon by the Divine Dragon Envoy and preparing to be brought into the Heavenly Dragon Island!

This was also to say that his hard work of more than two years finally brought him the result that he desired.

“I didn’t expect that the Mountain Challenger List actually directly ranked me as first place,” Ye Yuan also said in surprise.

“It’s not surprising. The Mountain Challenger List is a comprehensive ranking. It doesn’t completely look at battle results. You’re ranked first. It naturally shows that your strength and potential are stronger than everyone,” Feng Qingxuan said.

“So that’s how it is!”

Ye Yuan thought about it and felt that it made sense too. On this Mountain Challenger List, among the top 30, only he was middle Emperor Cloud Heaven.

Furthermore, he had already broken through to heaven qian grade bloodline. Coupled with spatial rule, his strength was formidable.

Ranking in the first place was also not incomprehensible.

He was very confident that as long as he broke through another minor realm and reached upper Emperor Cloud Heaven, sweeping through this list would not be anything strange too.

All around were indignant people. Ye Yuan could not be bothered to care about them and quietly left.

Suddenly, an old man blocked his path.

Ye Yuan’s expression turned somber. This was a bloodline warrior, but his strength was extremely strong!

“You’re Ye Yuan?” The old man asked, looking like he was talking down.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “It’s precisely me. May I ask who Senior is?”

The old man said lightly, “I’m Lord Divine Dragon Envoy’s servant. I’m here to give you the Divine Dragon Token!”

As he said, the old man threw Ye Yuan a token and said, “Half a month later, take the Divine Dragon Token and go to the East Sea’s shore! There will be a flying boat there. The few of you will board the boat by relying on the Divine Dragon Token. At that time, there will naturally be someone to guide you all to enter Heavenly Dragon Island.”

Ye Yuan received the token and said with a bow, “Many thanks, Senior!”

The old man nodded slightly, seemingly still considered satisfied with Ye Yuan’s attitude.

However, he said to Feng Qingxuan, “If Miss Qingxuan is interested, you can come along with him. Heavenly Dragon Island welcomes the young patriarch of the Fire Phoenix Clan.”

Feng Qingxuan was overjoyed when she heard that and said, “Thank you very much, Senior! Feng Qingxuan will definitely go.”

The old man nodded his head and turned around. He then left.

Once the old man left, Feng Qingxuan said excitedly, “Brat, even the Heavenly Dragon Island welcomes me. You can’t shake me off!?Hehe!”

However, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed together, and he said in a solemn voice, “Don’t you feel that something is not quite right?”
