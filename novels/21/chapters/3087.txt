Chapter 3086: Realm Crossing Greater Teleportation!

Mi Tian was calm and relaxed. Ye Yuan similarly had an indifferent look.

These two people did not seem to have the awareness that they were trapped at all.

Seeing Mi Tian look at him, Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said with a smile, “I’m really looking forward to the expression on their faces in a while.”

Boom!

Spatial origin power instantly burst forth from Mi Tian and Ye Yuan’s body.

At this moment, it was as if the entire world’s space was going to collapse!

Furthermore, Mi Tian and Ye Yuan’s spatial origin actually produced some kind of wondrous resonance!

Logically speaking, Mi Tian and Ye Yuan, one was an apex Great Beyond powerhouse, while the other was just a rookie who had just entered Emperor Sakra Heaven not long ago. It was impossible for there to be resonance between these two people.

But at the moment, this resonance was unbelievably strong!

Mi Tian looked at Yi Xue and said with a smile, “Do you really think that we’d be foolish enough to penetrate deep into enemy territory by ourselves? If we didn’t have some trump card, how can we possibly pursue across four worlds? This Realm Crossing Greater Teleportation was created by Ye Yuan and me a few days ago. You all just take a look at its power!”

Yi Xue’s pupils constricted, and he cried out angrily, “Quick! Don’t let them complete this move!”

Finished saying, bloody energy rose violently on Yi Xue’s body, and a palm smacked toward Ye Yuan.

At the same time, those Great Beyond Realm and Hegemon Realm powerhouses brought out their ultimate moves one after another, charging toward the Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven army.

......

For a moment, space shattered, and galaxy blew away!

Swoosh!

But before these moves landed, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army completely disappeared!

“Where are they? Can’t feel any aura at all!”

“How is this possible? Those were tens of thousands of people. They are gone just like that?”

“This sort of thing, even if it’s a Great Beyond Realm, it’s impossible to do it too, right?”

“With so many powerhouses, they can’t hide their auras at all! Could it be that they directly teleported out of this world with one teleportation? This … How is this possible?”

“Just now, Progenitor Mi Tian seemed to have said that this move is called ‘Realm Crossing Greater Teleportation’? Could it be that they have really crossed realms?”

… . .

Everyone in the blood race was dumbfounded with shock!

When Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army came out, they were all elites, with more than ten thousand powerhouses.

Pursuing across four worlds, these four worlds still had many remnant powerhouses. Seeing the arrival of their saviors, they joined in one after another too.

By then, it already reached close to 70 thousand!

Realm Crossing Greater Teleportation bringing 70 thousand people, this was simply an unimaginable means!

Even if one comprehended spatial origin and became Great Beyond Realm, it was impossible to accomplish this too.

But these over 70 thousand people all vanished without even leaving behind a louse!

The encirclement that Yi Xue carefully devised had completely turned into a joke.

Meanwhile, Bloodooze and the others were motionless like wooden chickens.

Where was the said revenge?

When Yi Xue appeared, he was excited to the extreme, thinking that the opportunity for revenge had arrived.

But in a blink, it was all for naught.

That kind of feeling simply drove people crazy.

“L-Lord Yi Xue, is Mi Tian already strong to this kind of extent?” Bloodooze said.

Yi Xue’s expression was solemn, and he shook his head and said, “No. It’s not Mi Tian who’s strong, but it was Ye Yuan!”

Everyone was shocked!

Although this move was jointly launched by Mi Tian and Ye Yuan, in everyone’s view, it must have been Mi Tian who played the leading role.

Ye Yuan was just Emperor Sakra Heaven. How could he possibly be of much use?

But, hearing Yi Xue’s words, that did not seem to be the case.

Bloodooze said inexplicably, “Y-Ye Yuan? He’s just Emperor Sakra Heaven!”

Yi Xue said in a solemn voice, “It’s precisely because he’s Emperor Sakra Heaven that it’s even scarier! The move just now was actually led by Ye Yuan! His comprehension of spatial origin probably doesn’t lose to Mi Tian by much anymore! When others comprehend origin, it’s very hard to walk out on their own Dao too. But he has already walked out on his own Dao!”

“What?! L-Led by Ye Yuan?” Bloodooze was violently shocked.

The other Hegemons had also all fallen into extreme shock!

Such a big move, it was actually led by an Emperor Sakra Heaven.

If this sort of thing came out of someone else’s mouth, they would have long given a tight slap.

But Yi Xue’s realm was extremely profound. What he saw naturally would not be wrong.

Yi Xue nodded and said, “Greater teleportation technique is unable to penetrate the boundary wall at all! Even if it’s a Hegemon who comprehended spatial origin, it’s impossible to teleport across realms too! Clearly, Mi Tian can’t do it either! Ye Yuan’s means seem very weak, but the most crucial link in this move is constructing a spatial passageway in the boundary wall! Most likely, only by gaining enlightenment on the Eternal River’s chaos can one accomplish this! This boy is too monstrous. He absolutely can’t be kept alive!”

Hearing Yi Xue’s analysis, everyone was stunned.

Only then did they understand what kind of role Ye Yuan played in this.

Boundary wall, that was an existence that Hegemon Realms could not pass through too.

If Hegemons wanted to cross realms, they had to forcibly break down the boundary wall.

But Ye Yuan actually constructed a spatial passageway in it and realized a spatial shift!

Such means were inconceivable!

Bloodooze said with unwillingness: “Then … Then are we letting them go just like that?”

Yi Xue’s gaze was slightly intent, and he said in a solemn voice, “The more this is so, the more we have to kill this boy! Originally, I didn’t want to utilize the Bloodcloud Grand Array, but looking at it now, there’s no choice but to do so!”

… . .

Swoosh!

Several tens of thousands of people appeared at the Extreme Medicine Sect’s mountain pass gates out of nowhere!

“Where are we?”

“This … This is the Extreme Medicine Sect? We … We’re back in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven?”

“My God! Is my eyesight failing? We passed through four worlds in one go and returned to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven?”

“How amazing! Progenitor Mi Tian is actually already strong to such an extent, creating such a terrifying technique!”

… . .

In an instant, the Extreme Medicine Sect fell into shock.

This kind of experience was really too miraculous.

Just a while ago, they even thought that they had fallen into a deathtrap and were dead for sure. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

But in a blink of an eye, they crossed four worlds and returned home!

Such terrifying spatial means, it was simply unheard of.

“Hur hur,?you all are wrong! The one who created this move is Ye Yuan, and not this old man! The crux of this move also lies with Ye Yuan and not this old man! Without him constructing the spatial passageway in the boundary wall, this move can’t be executed!” Mi Tian smiled as he explained.

“What?! It’s actually Heavenly Saint Ye!”

“Heavenly Saint Ye is really getting more and more monstrous!”

“Thinking about that Yi Xue, his expression must be very ugly now, right??Oh,?right, also that Bloodooze. He must want to vomit blood now!?Hahaha?…”

… . .

After the shock, everyone was extremely overjoyed!

From death to life, this kind of feeling felt very amazing.

“Ye Yuan, if you had such means, why didn’t you say so earlier? Your Father almost rushed up just now to fight it out with that Yi Xue!” Yang Qing smashed a fist onto Ye Yuan’s chest, very unhappy.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I said it out, is it still called a trump card? However, the blood race’s strength somewhat exceeded my imagination! We can’t lower our guard. From now on, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven will be on the highest level of alert to prevent the blood race’s sudden raid!”

Mi Tian nodded and said, “That Yi Xue’s strength isn’t beneath mine! They all have witnessed the Realm Crossing Greater Teleportation. They will probably be even more apprehensive of you! Furthermore, we’re currently a thorn in the blood race’s side. They will definitely exhaust every method to destroy us!”
