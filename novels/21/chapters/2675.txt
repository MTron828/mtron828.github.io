Chapter 2681 - Dragon Qi Stone!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Punk, I’m talking to you! Are you deaf?” Youqing said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a sincere expression, “Sorry about it, looks like my words earlier hurt you. But what’s wrong with what I said? You guys are just a bunch of pseudo-dragons!”

When Youqing heard the first half of the sentence, the words were still gentle.

But, when it reached the second half of the sentence, Youqing immediately had a feeling of being played.

He flew into a great rage and said in a solemn voice, “Boy, you’re courting death here! How can my Dragon Clan’s affairs be butted into by an outsider? Dragon Lord, don’t blame this little nephew for being unbridled today!”

Youqing was just about to fly off the handle when Black Flood Dragon King finally opened his mouth at this time.

“Honorable Nephew Youqing, he isn’t an outsider! There’s dragon race bloodline in Ye Yuan’s body too! Furthermore, it’s extremely powerful!” Black Flood Dragon King said with a bitter smile.

“What?! How can he, a human, has the dragon race bloodline?”

“What a joke! How strong can extremely powerful be? It couldn’t be to the extent of being even stronger than Younger Sister Jingfei, right?”

“I understand, this boy must have fused dragon race bloodline! To talk about pseudo-dragons, he’s the real pseudo-dragon, right?”

… …

Black Flood Dragon King’s words made the crowd burst into an uproar again.

Only then did many young powerhouses realize that it was not that the Black Flood Dragon King did not get angry, but that he could not get angry.

But how could Youqing be willing to believe it?

He smiled coldly and said, “Extremely powerful? Huhu, how strong? I was wondering how much confidence you had. It turns out that what you’re relying on is this! A human fusing with bloodline, it’s merely blindly copying others and making yourself look foolish!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “How strong? At least stronger than you! Blindly copying others and making myself look foolish? Huhu, copying you?”

Ye Yuan knew that his bloodline power was far stronger than Jingfei’s.

He did not know how strong his bloodline was, but it was definitely at least much stronger than these pseudo-dragons!

He still had this bit of confidence.

But these words became a joke when they landed in Youqing’s ears.

A human was flaunting his bloodline power in front of him, this member of the dragon race.

What was this if not a joke?

“Stronger than me? Boy, you’re really not scared of spraining your tongue from talking big! Since you say that, I want to see just how strong your bloodline power is!”

Youqing gave a bow to Black Flood Dragon King and said, “Dragon Lord, please bring up the Dragon Qi Stone.”

The moment Little Dragon Girl heard, she immediately clapped her hands and said cheerfully, “Alright, alright! I also want to see how strong Big Brother Ye Yuan’s dragon qi is!”

Ye Yuan was taken aback when he heard it and asked Little Dragon Girl, “What is the Dragon Qi Stone?”

He did not know much about the sea race and naturally did not know about the stuff here.

Little Dragon Girl explained, “Dragon Qi Stone is a stone that tests bloodline power. Our seven great sea regions’ dragon clans will all use it to test the dragon qi. A high dragon qi indicates that one has great potential and has the potential to become a true dragon. Of course, my dragon qi has already reached the fifth segment. It’s about the same as Father’s! Among all the big brothers present, no one is stronger than me!”

Talking towards the end, Little Dragon Girl unwittingly showed off a little.

It was precisely because her dragon qi was extremely strong. Hence, her position in the seven seas was very aloof.

After all, this one had the potential to step into a true dragon!

If the seven great sea regions could produce a true dragon, that would absolutely be a great honor!

Therefore, even if this girlie was a troublemaker, everyone dared to get angry but did not dare to speak up as well.

In the sea race, these pseudo-dragons had an extreme, perverse pursuit for bloodline power.

The goal that they strive lifelong toward was becoming a true dragon.

It was just a pity that no one had ever succeeded.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s blank appearance, Youqing smiled coldly and said, “Boy, scared? This Dragon Qi Stone will reveal your true colors!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile that was not a smile, “How about this then? Let’s compete in this dragon qi! Whoever loses, will kneel to the other person. How about it?”

The moment Youqing heard those words, he sneered and said, “Compete then! Will I be scared of you? Speaking of which, this young master hasn’t tested my dragon qi in a long time too!”

When he said this, Youqing had a haughty look.

Clearly, he was very confident in his dragon qi.

Among the powerhouses present, apart from Black Flood Dragon King and Little Dragon Girl, there was probably no one stronger than him!

Sure enough, when he said that, many people used eyes like looking at a fool to look at Ye Yuan.

“Huhu, this boy actually dares to compete in dragon qi with Youqing, does his brains have holes? Youqing’s dragon qi has already reached the fourth segment a hundred years ago! Now, it has at least reached the middle-stage fourth segment too!”

“I admit that this boy is a genius in martial arts. But that’s all. Can’t even see through this point and yet he actually dares to provoke Youqing!”

“Before Sister Jingfei was born, Youqing was publicly recognized as the most promising genius to become a true dragon!”

… …

In the eyes of these people, Little Dragon Girl was already an extreme.

Youqing was just slightly inferior to her.

Competing in dragon qi with Youqing, this was no different from committing suicide.

Very soon, a two-person tall stone pillar was carried in by two Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

This stone pillar was made of jade. He did not know what material it was made of either.

However, it made the bloodline within Ye Yuan’s body have a feeling of boiling over.

Dragon Qi Stone had nine sections, representing the nine segments of dragon qi.

That appearance was like a nine-section whip that was erected.

Youqing looked toward Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Boy, you first? Or am I going first?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You first then. If I go first, I reckon that you’ll become embarrassed to do it.”

Youqing sneered and said, “Keep pretending! I’ll see when you can pretend until!”

As he said, he walked straight in front of the Dragon Qi Stone.

Boom!

A vigorous true dragon power erupted in an instant!

The young powerhouses present let out a series of exclamations.

Clearly, Youqing’s true dragon power gave them a huge impact.

Youqing’s true dragon power was climbing crazily.

His complexion was flushed almost totally red.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Clearly, he had mustered up all of his strength and planned on squeezing out even the last trace of dragon power in his body.

Bang!

Youqing struck a palm onto the Dragon Qi Stone, the Dragon Qi Stone suddenly lit up.

The first section was instantly lit.

Following that, was the second section, and then the third section.

When it reached the fourth section, the Dragon Qi Stone’s speed of lightning up clearly slowed down.

However, it was still climbing little by little!

Initial-stage fourth segment!

Middle-stage fourth segment!

Late-stage fourth segment!

At this time, Youqing’s entire body was emitting waves of steaming heat.

“HAH!”

Youqing roared, and the fourth section was finally completely lit.

In the main hall, came a series of exclamations.

“Peak fourth segment! Youqing’s growth during these 100 years is simply terrifying!”

“My God! His dragon qi is actually only slightly worse than Little Dragon Girl!”

“Huhu, this human brat, he really doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Of course, he doesn’t even know about the Dragon Qi Stone. So he probably completely doesn’t know what peak fourth segment means, right?!”

… …

Youqing looked at the Dragon Qi Stone that was being lit, a hint of a smile flashed across his face.

Clearly, he was also very satisfied with this result.

Someone like Little Dragon Girl, that was completely abnormal!

Who could reach the level of fifth segment at the age of 100?

Even the seven great sea regions’ kings could not achieve it either!

Youqing looked at Ye Yuan and smiled coldly as he said, “Boy, it’s your turn!”
