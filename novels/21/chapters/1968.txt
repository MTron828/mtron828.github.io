Chapter 1972: Consider Yourself Ruthless!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Isn’t it just relying on the power of an empyrean spirit treasure? What ability can that even be considered as?!” Zuo Mo laughed coldly with a look of disdain.

They were naturally unconvinced in their hearts. Putting aside the spirit treasure, Ye Yuan was not their match at all.

What kind of ability can that even be considered as, with him relying on foreign objects?

Of course, if these treasures landed in their hands, they absolutely would not say so.

Ye Yuan swept them a glance and said coolly, “I have empyrean spirit treasures; I’m bullying you all. Still not convinced?”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan did not say a word. The Stellar War Banner was waved once more.

When the three people saw the situation, their faces could not help changing.

Witnessing the Stellar War Banner’s power, how could they still dare to be neglectful? All mustering up their strength, the three people joined hands to resist.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Rumbling sounds shook the heavens.

Ye Yuan relied on the power of the Stellar War Banner and did not defend himself at all. He just pounced on the three people crazily, completely a bullying style of play.

Zuo Mo three people were beaten until they were practically about to vomit blood. They had yet to have fought such an aggrieved battle before.

They could only take a beating and could not fight back.

Fighting back was still okay, but they could not budge him even a little!

Their attacks did not have any effect when landing on Ye Yuan’s body.

Fighting until now, Ye Yuan was completely fine.

Rather, it was them who were beaten by the Stellar War Banner until their innards were in upheaval, divine essence being in disorder.

This kind of fighting style was simply unreasonable.

“Stop! Quickly stop! We ... We don’t want the empyrean spirit treasure anymore!” Feng Xiaotian shouted repeatedly.

This kind of battle, he did not want to continue fighting anymore.

Their divine essence was already somewhat losing steam. Looking at Ye Yuan, on the other hand, he was completely fine.

Was this guy really a First Firmament True God?

Could it be that his divine essence was endless?

This kind of fighting method was too shameless, but they could not help it at all and could only admit defeat.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s figure abruptly stopped.

Zuo Mo three people heaved a sigh at the same time. But currently, the three of them were panting heavily for air, clearly tired out badly just now.

At this very moment, the gazes that these children of destiny looked at Ye Yuan with were full of alarm and fear.

No wonder he was of the emperor surmounting aura. Being just a First Firmament True God and he actually already had two empyrean spirit treasures on him.

Furthermore, these two empyrean spirit treasures had both offensive and defensive ability, and could actually let him jump realms to overpower three Third Firmament True Gods.

This kind of destiny could be rated as heaven-defying!

“Various lord emperor surmounting auras, if you need empyrean spirit treasures, you’re welcome to come to take it at any time,” Ye Yuan had a proud appearance due to having spirit treasures as he said with a grin.

The few people’s faces were very ugly. Zuo Mo gritted his teeth and said, “Consider yourself ruthless! Let’s go!”

Finished talking, he brought his own squad into the fog. He seriously could not stay in this place anymore.

The rest also slunk away.

Originally, everyone harbored the mentality of watching a show. But no one could have thought that the few strongest children of destiny were actually suppressed completely by a First Firmament True God.

They finally knew that Ye Yuan’s strength was already the pinnacle-most existence among these children of destiny.

At this time, a handsome youth suddenly walked up and said to Ye Yuan with clasped hands, “Brother Ye is indeed skillful. I’m from Pure Source Great Imperial Capital; my strength is just alright. I wonder if I can form a team together with Brother Ye?”

With his taking the lead, many children of destiny who boasted that their strength was decent all wanted to form a team with Ye Yuan.

For some time, Ye Yuan became a hot property.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Sorry about this, but this Ye doesn’t have the intention of forming teams with people. If there are any fortuitous encounters, everyone each relies on their own abilities.”

As he said, Ye Yuan also strode straight into the fog.

He was neither kith nor kin with these children of destiny. He did not have the duty of being their protective umbrella.

Previously, when Zuo Mo the few of them came to find trouble, these people were all harboring the mentality of watching a show. Now, they wanted to come and find him. How could there be such a good thing in this world?

But Ye Yuan did not notice that a gaze in the crowd was staring fixedly at him all along without leaving.

...

Upon entering the fog, Ye Yuan’s eyesight could only reach several hundred feet far.

Ye Yuan immediately perked his spirits up 120%. He had a feeling that starting from here, it would be considered entering the truly dangerous region.

Were those battle spirits outside strong or not?

Very strong!

But those battle spirits, not one actually dared to approach this fog. It clearly indicated that this place was very dangerous.

“This damn place! I can’t see anything at all! How to search for treasures?”

“Damn it! I can only see several dozen feet away!”

“This place is too peculiar. Everyone, follow closer.”

...

Inside the fog, those children of destiny were all depressed to the extreme.

Their eyesights were not as good as Ye Yuan, so they could only see several dozen feet away.

For a True God Realm powerhouse, this was no different from being a blind person.

This feeling made them very depressed.

Ye Yuan discovered that after entering the fog, the various teams became much more scattered. It was not not like the group of battalions previously.

Everyone also knew that while this place was dangerous. There would probably be quite a lot of good stuff.

However, Song Yu and Zuo Mo’s two squads chose the same direction as Ye Yuan without prior agreement.

Of course, they actually completely did not know that Ye Yuan was not far from them.

“Mn? No, wait!”

Having just turned around, Ye Yuan suddenly felt that something was amiss. Turning his head around again, he looked toward Song Yu’s squad.

With this look, he could not help shuddering with fear.

They entered from Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital. There were a total of nine people.

Excluding him and those two who died, there should still be six people remaining.

But why were there seven people in the team currently?

The people that came together, Ye Yuan had an impression of them.

Sweeping a glance over, Ye Yuan discovered that there was something wrong with the last person.

He followed closely behind the last person before him, just like a specter.

About that last person, Ye Yuan had an impression. He was called Qian Feng, a peak First Firmament True God powerhouse.

But right at this time, that specter-like person’s fierce eyes actually looked over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan felt shocked. This guy could discover him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Could it be that this mist was useless against him?

“Qian Feng, careful behind you!”

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan immediately warned Qian Feng loudly.

At the same time, his figure shot out explosively, moving toward that specter behind Qian Feng.

They came out from the same great imperial capital after all. Ye Yuan did not wish to see something happen to Extreme Luck’s people.

When Song Yu’s squad heard Ye Yuan’s yell, each and every one of them was baffled. But they all instinctively turned to look at Qian Feng.

Qian Feng himself was also stunned, having a baffled look on his face.

He instinctively wanted to turn around, but already did not have the chance.

He felt a stabbing pain behind his neck. Then, his entire person shriveled up at a speed visible to the naked eye.

When Song Yu and the rest saw this scene, each and every one of their pupils constricted.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan arrived. The Stellar War Banner swept out without the slightest hesitation.

Bang!

However, that figure was faster than him. With a whoosh, it dove into the fog, disappearing.

“ARGHH!!”

“ARGHH!!”

“ARGHH!!”

...

At the same time, a series of miserable screams sounded out inside the fog, giving people a hair-raising feeling.
