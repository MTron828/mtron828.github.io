Chapter 1603 Bullying People Too Far

Ye Yuan slowly opened his eyes and took a step out, and he then instantly arrived beside Coldfeather.

He grabbed Coldfeather’s collar and said coolly, “Come, let’s go out.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan took a step out once more, and already entered inside the chaotic space.

The surrounding space was collapsing non-stop. The horrifying energy undulation made Coldfeather’s heart palpitating.

These energy undulations, if he touched a little bit, it was also dying without any burial ground.

However, Ye Yuan brought him along akin to strolling idly in a courtyard, shuttled back and forth inside these chaotic spaces without any obstruction at all.

Seeing these surrounding spaces shatter piece by piece, but it was like they were situated between two worlds, it did not affect them at all.

After the astonishment, Coldfeather was envious to the extreme.

What did he enter this spatial inheritance for?

Wasn’t it in order to comprehend spatial laws?!

Only a short while ago, he was also puffed up with pride, thinking that he could rely on his outstanding talent to comprehend spatial laws and become a powerhouse of his generation.

But the blow of reality made him utterly give up hope.

Spatial laws were really not what so-called geniuses could comprehend.

All the way until later, Coldfeather thought that it was completely impossible for someone to comprehend spatial laws in the spatial inheritance.

Hence, after Ye Yuan entered, he beat Ye Yuan down relentlessly without any mercy, mocking him for overestimating his own ability.

But today, this young man in front of him really succeeded!

Furthermore, he only used 100 years!

This made him have an impulse to vomit blood.

This kid was simply a freak!

He was clearly the Pill Tower’s elder and was actually so perverse when comprehending spatial laws.

Just how freakish was this guy?!

...

During these 100 years, for Yue Mengli and the others, their days were tough.

Although there was Xuan Yu looking after, he was the second elder, standing high above the masses after all. It was also not possible to care for them every day in all matters no matter how major or trivial.

When time passed, there would always be many vexing issues.

Xuan Yu arranged for them a large residence in the city, letting Li-er and the rest stay inside.

All food and clothing were also not an issue.

It was just that Xuan Yu’s instructions were Xuan Yu’s instructions. When it reached people below, it was another matter altogether.

“Truly preposterous! Now, the divine essence stones given to us are lesser and lesser. At this rate, how will we still cultivate?” White Light said furiously.

Li-er heaved a sigh and said, “Big Brother Yuan has been gone for a hundred years, his prestige has long already been lost. For Second Elder to be able to remember their old friendship and take extra care of us, it’s already rather not easy.”

White Light said furiously, “That Zhou Wei, simply bullying people too far! No way, I can’t stomach this, I’m going to find Second Elder!”

Li-er hurriedly pulled him and said, “Enough, don’t cause any more trouble! Before Big Brother Yuan comes out, we all don’t bring trouble on ourselves anymore! If you go to find Second Elder right now, putting aside whether or not he can meet us, even if you can meet him and then he punishes Zhou Wei fiercely, and then after that? In the future, Zhou Wei will definitely go from bad to worse! Big Brother Yuan’s favor can be used for some time, but can’t be used for life. If Big Brother Yuan were to really stay inside for a thousand years, do you feel that Second Elder’s lineage can still protect us for so long?”

Clearly, Li-er saw through the current situation very incisively.

Originally, with their strength, it was impossible to enter the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s inner city.

The reason why they could still remain here was entirely because of Ye Yuan.

Second Elder was indeed a good person that was quite rare to find. But he was the second elder who was far removed from the masses after all. He was not in the same world as them, these people, at all.

At first, Second Elder might take care of them because of his relationship with Ye Yuan.

However, there would always come a time when a favor is used up.

A powerhouse like Second Elder, one closed-seclusion might be several hundred, a thousand years, how could he keep on taking care of them?

The few of them were merely Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s bottom-level residents. Staying in such a mansion was already out of the norm in the first place.

Such a situation, how could it not attract people’s covetous eyes?

Yue Mengli was very clear, as long as Ye Yuan did not come back, this kind of situation could continue to deteriorate.

Going to find Second Elder might be able to obtain temporary help. But it would only make this situation worsen faster.

“Then ... Then we deserve to be bullied like this?” White Light said unhappily.

Li-er heaved a sigh and said, “Big Brother Yuan isn’t around, what we have to do is take care of ourselves! If anyone of us is harmed, what do you think the consequences will be? What he has to face is Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, this leviathan!”

White Light’s expression changed, breaking out in cold sweat.

Ye Yuan’s personality, he was naturally all too clear. Once they had a conflict with Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s forces, or even get any injuries, the result would be very frightening.

“Elder Sister Li-er, Young Master he didn’t come out for so many years, could he have encountered some danger?” Lu-er said rather worriedly.

Li-er smiled and said, “Your family’s young master, could it be that you still don’t know? Even if the whole world thinks that he’s dead, we should also have faith in him!”

Lu-er nodded her head and said resolutely, “Mn, when Young Master comes out, he’ll definitely stir up the entire city again, and give a vicious slap to those people who rolled their eyes at us!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Hahaha! It’s already been a hundred years, you guys are still harboring delusions? It’s impossible for your Young Master Ye Yuan to ever come out again!”

Right at this time, a laughter that made people abhor sounded out, the words full of mockery.

The moment White Light saw the arrival, he could not help burning with rage and said with an angry snort, “Zhou Wei, what did you come again for?”

This Zhou Wei was the Martial Tower’s low-level protector, holding a post in the City Lord Manor.

The mission of taking care of Yue Mengli and the rest was handed to him.

Because it was Second Elder personally giving a heads up, the few years at the start, Zhou Wei naturally did not dare to neglect.

But later on, Song Qiyang found him and bought him over.

Therefore, the days of Yue Mengli and the rest became worse day after day.

As time passed, Second Elder was in seclusion all year round, the attention paid to this area naturally lessen.

Even though he already had Lu Yi take care of Li-er and the rest, Lu Yi himself also had to cultivate. Being able to come once every few years was already pretty good.

In the course of time, Zhou Wei’s courage also gradually grew.

Zhou Wei swaggered into the hall and said with a cold smile, “I came to tell you guys this. According to the City Lord Manor’s rules, starting from today, each of you has to pay a tax of 500 thousand divine essence stones every year. If you can’t hand it over, then get out of the inner city for me as soon as possible! Our inner city doesn’t support idle people!”

One person 500 thousand, this was not a small sum.

Even though Ye Yuan left behind quite a bit of divine essence stones for them, paying according to this figure, they could not last for long at all.

The moment White Light heard, he was greatly enraged and howled, “Zhou Wei, don’t bully people too far! Us staying here was Second Elder arranging it personally, you dare to treat us like this?”

Zhou Wei chuckled and said, “It’s important to know your own limitations! If I were you guys, I would have long gotten lost from the inner city myself. Staying here will only bring disgrace on yourselves! Second Elder? Second Elder attends to a myriad of problems every day, so how could he care about you all, these few minor characters?”
