Chapter 2170: Divine Lightning Devastation

“Sigh! You shouldn’t have provoked Ye Yuan!” Seeing Long Seven, Long Zifeng could not help sighing as he said.

Long Seven endured the pain and said with gritted teeth, “How can this fellow be so strong?”

Long Zifeng said with a bitter smile, “Strong? Atavism Dragon Soul, perfect seventh transformation, a secret art to contract his strength, can he not be strong? Ao Yu provoked Ye Yuan and was trampled to death by him with one foot already! For you being able to come out safely was already him showing leniency! Now, there’s probably only Long Yuan who can have a showdown with him!”

Long Seven had a dumbfounded stare, his mouth gaping. How could he have thought that Ye Yuan’s trumps cards were actually so numerous?

Furthermore, each trump card was sufficient to shock the soul.

He actually still looked for trouble, posturing in front of Ye Yuan.

Fortunately, there were not many people left in the Mist Battlefield currently. He was kicked out seventh from the last.

This was also to say that in the Battle of Dragon Sons this time, he was ranked seventh, rather fitting with his name.

Suddenly, a Heavenly Emperor cried out in surprise, “Quickly look! Ye Yuan and Long Yuan have met! This time, it’s really the strong characters meeting! The victor among them will probably be the champion this time!”

Ye Yuan sensed the position of the dragon origin crystals and bumped into Long Yuan head-on.

When he saw Ye Yuan, Long Yuan was slightly taken aback.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan could actually walk until now.

Not encountering Ye Yuan for such a long time, he even thought that Ye Yuan was finished off long ago.

“Being able to get to this point, looks like you still have a bit of strength. However ... you shouldn’t be so cocky!” Long Yuan said coolly with his hands behind his back.

These words were clearly not planning on letting Ye Yuan off.

The words that Ye Yuan said outside had clearly triggered him, this Sons of the Heavenly Dragon’s number one person’s pride.

That kind of word that showed disdain upon all geniuses, only he was worthy to say it!

Ye Yuan said with a light smile, “Cocky, is it? I don’t think so. I was just stating a fact!”

“Is that so?”

Long Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly. Suddenly, his palm struck out. It was actually a Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand!

This move was quick as lightning and actually did not even need the time to cast the spell.

Making a move at a word of disagreement!

“Die!” Long Yuan shouted coldly, Ye Yuan was already a dead person in his eyes.

Ye Yuan laughed coldly and with a backhand, it was a Grand Universe Palm.

Bang!

The two people each fell back several steps and stabilized their figures.

“Eh?” Long Yuan let out a light cry of surprise. Clearly, he was very surprised by Ye Yuan’s strength.

Outside word, the group of heavenly emperors were extremely shocked.

“Long Yuan actually mastered the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand too! This kid is truly monstrous!”

“Ye Yuan merely relied on the Atavism Dragon Soul in order to master the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand. But Long Yuan cultivated by relying on his own talent. In comparison, whoever is superior can be determined at once!”

“Up until now, there has yet to be someone who forced out his true strength. Wonder if Ye Yuan can do it or not.”

... ...

The moment the two people attacked, the group of heavenly emperors all leaned toward Long Yuan one-sidedly.

It was not that Ye Yuan was not amazing, but it was that Long Yuan that was seriously too mysterious.

Up until now, nobody could force him to use his innate divine abilities at all.

Even the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand, it was the first time he used it.

They had practically seen all of Ye Yuan’s trump cards.

But Long Yuan’s trump cards, they did not see it at all.

Was it that Long Yuan’s opponents were not strong?

Of course not!

Long Yuan already wiped out quite a few powerful Sons of the Heavenly Dragon walking until now.

Some people’s strengths were even stronger than the Ao Yu after evolving.

But even so, nobody could force out Long Yuan’s true strength either. It could be seen how mysterious he was.

In contrast, the strength that Ye Yuan displayed was practically his limit already.

Hence, everyone naturally felt more optimistic about Long Yuan.

The reason why Heavenly Dragon Stronghold was powerful was that their bloodline was extremely strong.

One should not look at how Ao Yu awakened his Heavenly Dragon Mark a second time. Because when comparing bloodlines, he might even be inferior to Long Yuan who only awakened once.

This was the magnitude of disparity, and also the difference in talent. It was impossible to make up for.

Long Yuan looked at Ye Yuan and said rather surprisedly, “Indeed have some skill, to actually be able to block my Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand with the Grand Universe Palm! You have the qualifications to make me a little serious.”

Ye Yuan shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “Another arrogant fellow! You’re getting a little serious. It’s just that, I don’t know whether you can make me a little serious or not!”

Long Yuan had an appearance of looking down from high above as he said coolly, “You’d best be a little more serious. Otherwise, when I make my move, you won’t have the chance to be serious anymore!”

Finished talking, Long Yuan’s vital energy surged to the sky. A true dragon spirit appeared behind him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter again!

However, Long Yuan’s Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter was more than a magnitude stronger than Ao Yu’s!

That true dragon spirit’s aura gave Ye Yuan a feeling of Mt. Tai bearing down from above.

“To be able to force me to use an innate divine ability, you can be sufficiently proud! Now, you can go and die!” Long Yuan had an appearance of having everything under control, suddenly striking a palm out.

Ye Yuan laughed lightly, True Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand firing out fiercely.

Bang!

Two forces dissipated with a loud bang, returning to serenity.

Evenly-matched once again!

Long Yuan’s eyes narrowed, clearly not expecting that Ye Yuan would actually know the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand too.

Furthermore, before this move erupted, there was actually not the slightest trace of undulation.

That instant they exchanged blows, Long Yuan felt a force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas erupt, making him almost lose control of himself.

Similar to the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand, the power of Ye Yuan’s move was no idea how many times stronger than him!

He realized that he still underestimated Ye Yuan in the end.

This fellow was not simple!

However, it was also just not simple.

To the arrogant Long Yuan, there was nothing that he had respect for.

“This is the strength after you get serious? It’s also nothing much!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Long Yuan’s gaze turned cold, and he said in a cold voice, “Since you’re in a hurry to seek death, I’ll send you off then!”

It was only to see him open both hands, bending his fingers to form claws, suspending above in midair.

Behind him, a true dragon spirit appeared once more.

This time, the true dragon spirit was more solid than any time that Ye Yuan had seen before in the past.

A fierce wind swept up, Long Yuan’s hair fluttered, akin to a god.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Countless electric currents were flowing above the void.

The entire Mist Battlefield seemed to have transformed into an endless lightning sea.

Long Yuan used his eyes like looking at an ant as he looked toward Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice, “Do you see it? This is my true strength after getting serious! The second innate divine abilities that others comprehended are mostly Boundless Big Dipper Fist. But my bloodline power is far purer than theirs! The second innate divine ability that I comprehended is this Divine Lightning Devastation! This divine lightning is dipper lightning that drives the heavens; not within the five elements. It’s the lightning that the spirit of the true dragon controls, capable of annihilating myriad life on earth! Seeing this divine ability, you ... can die contently!”

At the outside world, the group of heavenly emperors was long already staring dumbfoundedly and their mouths agape.

No one thought that Long Yuan’s talent was actually so great!

For the second innate divine ability, he actually awakened Divine Lightning Devastation.

“Monster! This is a true monster!”

“Divine Lightning Devastation! Sons of the Heavenly Dragon capable of awakening this innate divine ability are one in a million!”

“This kid is bound to be another major power of my Dragon Clan in the future!”
