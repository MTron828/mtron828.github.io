Chapter 2565: Testing Poison with His Own Body!

“Qiao! Kai! Yuan!”

After Ye Yuan left, Cheng Chongshan’s angry roar shook until the roof collapsed.

He pointed at Qiao Kaiyuan’s nose and scolded, “This is the nation teacher that you found? Qiao Kaiyuan, are you rebelling? Just you wait, this envoy will definitely report to the sect after returning to the sect this time and eradicate your Eastward Country!”

The emperor and Second Prince’s complexions were ashen, feeling like the sky was about to fall down.

Once the envoys were angered, Eastward Country could not withstand it!

This father and son two people were like targets for venting, feeling helpless.

It was clearly you who postured and were not willing to lower your head, angering Ye Yuan, you still wanted to frame the charges onto our heads!

Who would we go find to reason things out?!

Both sides were big shots, both sides could not afford to be provoked!

The emperor had an ugly expression as he said, “Envoy, please calm your anger! That Ye Yuan is indeed arrogant at heart and haughty in manner, but he has genuine ability too! His means earlier, you saw it too! He said that envoy, you have a problem in your body too. Why don’t envoy put aside your ego and request him for medical treatment?”

Cheng Chongshan sneered and said,?“Huhu,?can this kind of half-genuine and half-sham trick scare this envoy? This envoy’s body, don’t I know it myself? With just the likes of him, what can he tell?”

He naturally did not believe Ye Yuan’s words. He felt that he was currently strong as a bull now.

He did not listen to Ye Yuan’s words at all.

He looked at the emperor and said with a cold smile, “Qiao Kaiyuan, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance! Within half a day, have that punk get over here and apologize to this envoy, this matter will be left at this! If not, heh heh, you know the consequence!”

The emperor’s complexion was ashen and could only bring Second Prince and leave.

… …

At Nation Teacher Manor, Qiao Kaiyuan and Second Prince urged Ye Yuan with earnest words and the best intentions for a long time.

But he was unmoved.

“The two of you don’t need to waste your breath anymore. Calculating the time, that cocky envoy should be here,” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

The father and son two people exchanged glances, both revealing disbelieving looks.

“Nation Teacher, Envoy Cheng looks very healthy and doesn’t seem like he has a problem at all! Were you mistaken?” Qiao Kaiyuan said.

His voice had yet to fade when a servant came to report hurriedly.

“Your Excellency, it’s not good! Someone is vomiting blood as he’s walking and rushed straight into Nation Teacher Manor! We … We can’t stop him!”

Qiao Kaiyuan father and son, as well as Lin Lan, trembled all over.

This was also foreseeing with too much accuracy, right? Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Could it be that it was Cheng Chongshan who came?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan really hit the mark, Cheng Chongshan really had a problem!

Lin Lan’s heart shook wildly. As a grade two heavenly alchemist, he actually did not even see any clues!

Ye Yuan got up and went out to greet.

Qiao Kaiyuan and the rest followed out with bellies full of shock.

After walking a short distance, they saw Cheng Chongshan swaying with every step, vomiting with each step, staggering over here.

A foul smell greeted the nose.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he hurriedly flicked his fingers repeatedly. An enchantment directly opened up, sealing the road that Cheng Chongshan had walked over from.

He already poisoned a large swathe coming all the way here.

The servants had long already retreated very far away and did not dare to approach.

This poison was very strong!

“All stay further away! Protect your body with divine essence. This poison isn’t ordinary!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

The others felt a chill in their hearts and hurriedly followed suit.

“S-Save me! M-Master Ye, I … I was wrong! I-I beg you, save me!”

Seeing Ye Yuan, Cheng Chongshan seemed to have clutched the last life-saving saw, using the last of his strength to shout.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Not putting on your airs as an envoy now?”

Cheng Chongshan said weakly, “Master Ye, I was wrong! I really know that I was wrong! Help me!”

When Qiao Kaiyuan saw this scene, he was also frightened badly and hurriedly said, “Nation Teacher, take it as We are begging you! He can’t die in Eastward!”

Second Prince also said anxiously, “Nation Teacher, I’m begging you!”

Ye Yuan was full of unwillingness, but in all fairness, Qiao Kaiyuan father and son had treated him with courtesy.

Moreover, there was also the Tang Family, Lu Yun, and Jiang Yu, these relationships.

Once the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect was enraged, it was troublesome too.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and fired out a thin thread, attempting to probe into Cheng Chongshan’s body.

Seeing this scene, Qiao Kaiyuan and the rest had ecstatic faces.

However, the fine thread had not gotten close to Cheng Chongshan yet and was actually burned to a crisp!

Furthermore, a cloud of mist actually followed along the thread and crept over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed and he hurriedly broke the thread off.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “This poison is very troublesome!”

Qiao Kaiyuan said in surprise, “Doesn’t Nation Teacher recognize this poison? Then how did you tell that there was something wrong with Cheng Chongshan’s body?”

Ye Yuan said, “I guess it! I only saw that there was a very formidable poison hidden in his body, about to erupt. But I also didn’t expect that this poison would actually be so strong! According to this kind of toxicity, he probably can’t last past two hours! I just ascended not long and don’t understand Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s poisons. It’s a little troublesome to save him!”

Everyone had shocked faces. To actually be able to discern with one look, how terrifying his skill must be!

However, Qiao Kaiyuan discerned it. Ye Yuan said that it was troublesome, not hopeless!

“Nation Teacher, he … he can’t die! As long as Nation Teacher can save him, our Qiao Family will follow Nation Teacher for directions!” Qiao Kaiyuan said.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “All of you step back a little.”

Everyone was uncertain what it meant and retreated to a further place.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan slowly got up and walked over toward Cheng Chongshan who was already in a coma.

Then, he actually reached his hand out toward the blood spot that Cheng Chongshan vomited!

When everyone saw the situation, they turned pale with fright!

“Master, you mustn’t!” Lin Lan exclaimed.

“Nation Teacher!” Qiao Kaiyuan father and son said in surprise.

A little bit of black blood stained on Ye Yuan’s hand.

Practically instantly, that drop of black blood disappeared, fusing into the skin.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed abruptly, hurriedly sitting cross-legged and revolving his skill.

The toxin was like a cluster of flames, instantly invading Ye Yuan’s meridians.

The toxicity far surpassed any poison that Ye Yuan had ever seen before!

With regards to the 33 Heavens’ poisons, Ye Yuan had never dabbled in them before.

But Ye Yuan was not just the ancestor of alchemy. He was also the ancestor of using poison!

Otherwise, he also would not have poisoned a hundred thousand Celestial Deity powerhouses to death back then!

In order to study the poison path, Ye Yuan had once tested poison with his body countless times.

Ye Yuan had long already formed his own set of methods to deal with toxins.

The toxins that he introduced were very precise, not much, but sufficient to be fatal!

Ye Yuan wanted to use his body to feel this toxin and find a way to cure the poison from there.

Very soon, a pitch-black color appeared on his face. Even his lips turned purplish black.

The symptoms were the same as Cheng Chongshan’s.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s hearts leaped to their throats.

“This … What exactly is Nation Teacher trying to do? Isn’t this tantamount to suiciding?” Qiao Kaiyuan said nervously.

Lin Lan said in a solemn voice, “Master is testing the poison with his body. This is a method to understand toxins. It’s just that there are extremely few people who dare to use it. Because a single misstep and it’s the outcome of death! Furthermore, this poison is extremely powerful. Master … he is probably … fraught with grim possibilities!”
