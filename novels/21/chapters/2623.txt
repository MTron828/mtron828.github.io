Chapter 2629: Hundred Poison Formation!

“Audacious fellow! To dare cause trouble on my Shangyu Heavenly Sect’s territory, deserves to be killed!”

A stern yell came from above the void. It was Ling Wancheng.

The five great sect masters rushed over at the same time!

The Pill Alliance made thorough preparations. So how could the five great heavenly sects be amateurs?

The five great sect masters moving out at the same time, how shocking was the commotion?

And right at this time, an astonishing sword rose to the sky, flying straight for the five great sect masters.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help being greatly shocked!

Who was this? To actually dare make a move against the five great sect masters with his strength alone?

Who could this person be if not Xiao Feibai?

In a single breath, Xiao Feibai clashed with the five great sect masters.

In a blink, Xiao Feibai and the five great sect masters exchanged more than a hundred moves.

The five great sect masters were actually unable to free themselves for some time.

It had long already fallen into a mess in front of Cloud Leisure Establishment.

The five great heavenly sects’ Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses also moved out in full force at this time.

It was just that their reaction was clearly not as fast as the Pill Alliance and other factions.

Even though they made a move, they could only hinder a dozen over people.

There were still nearly 20 Jade Sovereign Heavens who rushed in front of Ye Yuan.

When Feng Xuanyi saw this scene, his heart could not help palpitating, thinking inwardly that it was over!

With Ye Yuan’s bit of strength, how could there be any fluke under the joint-killing of 20 Jade Sovereign Heavens?

The nearest one was less than 200 feet away from Ye Yuan!

This bit of distance was but a single breath to a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

From the start until now, Ye Yuan did not even move a muscle, looking like he was scared silly.

When that Jade Sovereign Heaven saw this scene, a hint of a cruel smile flashed across the corners of his mouth.

Personally killing a genius who could defeat Holy Son was a great sense of accomplishment!

When the Huangfu Cloudthink on the watchtower saw this scene, a hint of smile similarly flashed across the corners of his mouth and he said, “No matter how monstrous the genius, it’s also useless if he’s dead! Boy, you showed too much of your ability!”

But very soon, the smile on his face froze.

Those dozen over people rushing towards Ye Yuan actually stopped at the same time!

And Ye Yuan’s figure also floated out from under the siege of more than a dozen people unhurriedly.

An expression of shock appeared on Huangfu Cloudthink’s face and he muttered, “This … What’s going on here?”

Suddenly, his gaze turned intent. He saw that wafts of hot steam actually emerged on top of those Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses’ heads.

Seeing this scene, how could Huangfu Cloudthink still not understand what had happened?

“Used poison? A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, what kind of poison did he use to be able to affect 20 Jade Sovereign Heavens at the same time?” Huangfu Cloudthink’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice.

This scene similarly landed in the eyes of Feng Xuanyi, Luo Yunqing, and the rest.

Seeing Ye Yuan succeed in breaking out of the encirclement, their minds could not help quivering!

This boy had such shocking moves!

Facing the besiegement of nearly 20 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, he could actually escape safe and sound!

Seeing Ye Yuan float out unhurriedly, the faces of those Jade Sovereign Heavens all revealed indignant expressions.

Not that they did not want to kill, but that they were strong in will, but lacking in strength!

Although this poison was not lethal, it severely affected their movements.

Especially one of the poisons, it even had a numbing effect.

That Jade Sovereign Heaven who charged right at the front had a baleful look on his face.

Just earlier, he suddenly discovered that he was poisoned.

Furthermore, he got hit by many poisons!

He suddenly discovered that he actually got caught in a poison formation.

Roughly calculating, he was actually hit by a hundred kinds of poison!

Furthermore, the effects of these poisons were different from each other.

Some targeted the meridians, some targeted the divine essence, some even targeted the origin divinity.

With a hundred types of poisons superimposed together, it actually made his bodily functions temporarily fall into paralysis!

Just like a machine that suddenly jammed.

This guy was clearly right under his nose, but he was unable to take action!

Damn it!

These Jade Sovereign Heavens did not dare to dawdle, expelling the poison on the spot.

There were many Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses of the five great heavenly sects lying in wait on every side. Getting poisoned at this time, even if it was just getting poisoned a little, it would be fatal.

Sure enough, right at this time, the five great heavenly sects’ Jade Sovereign Heavens arrived. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The last three Jade Sovereign Heavens at the back were directly hacked to death!

Just this tiny bit of delay, those Jade Sovereign Heaven assassins all fell into passiveness.

And Ye Yuan also directly floated to the safe area.

“Hahaha,

?terrific lad, indeed you didn’t let me down! Ye Yuan, wait a moment, this sect master will be there right away!”

When Feng Xuanyi saw Ye Yuan escape with his life, he could not resist letting out a loud laugh and said to the other four great sect masters, “I’ll leave this guy to you all, I’m going to protect Ye Yuan!”

“Go on!” Yang Jie answered.

No matter how strong Xiao Feibai was, it was also impossible to tie down five great sect masters at the same time.

His appearance earlier was just in order to buy a little time for the people below.

Now that the plan fell through, with four great sect masters pinning him down, it was enough.

Feng Xuanyi forced Xiao Feibai back with one move, his figure flying toward Ye Yuan like an arrow that left the bowstring.

Xiao Feibai still had a frosty expression, but during the fierce battle, his brows furrowed slightly.

He knew that the plan failed!

However, Xiao Feibai’s strength still shocked the five great sect masters.

Facing the siege of five great sect masters, Xiao Feibai could actually hold out for so long!

This level of strength was simply astonishing!

The five great sect masters knew in their hearts that Xiao Feibai’s strength was not beneath any of theirs!

“Just who is your esteemed self?!” Yang Jie asked.

Xiao Feibai’s hand movements did not slow as he said coolly, “Pill Alliance’s Heavenly Martial Hall, Xiao Feibai! This battle today, the name of the five great sect masters indeed lives up to the reputation! Unfortunately, I can’t battle to my heart’s content! In the future, this Xiao will naturally seek guidance from the five of you. Farewell!”

Sword intent surged on Xiao Feibai’s body, and he suddenly slashed out with a sword.

This sword was amazing to the extreme!

When the Luo Yunqing who was currently in a fierce battle felt this sword intent, his expression immediately changed wildly.

His gaze revealed a strong battle intent.

Xiao Feibai’s sword shocked him immensely!

Too strong!

Talented people indeed remained in concealment in the Pill Alliance!

Repelling the four great sect masters with a sword, Xiao Feibai’s figure moved, disappearing from the sky.

“Withdraw!” At the same time, he even left behind a word.

The Pill Alliance’s powerhouses knew that this matter already could not go through and retreated one after another.

On the watchtower, Huangfu Cloudthink frowned and said, “Hundred Poison Formation! I didn’t expect that this boy’s poison path can actually reach such a level! What a formidable boy!”

Finished saying, Huangfu Cloudthink’s figure flashed, disappearing.

Looking at Xiao Feibai’s distant figure, the four great sect masters had solemn faces.

“I didn’t expect that the Pill Alliance actually has such a formidable expert! His strength is likely not beneath any of us!” Hua Ziyou exclaimed with a sigh.

“Heh heh, no need to put feathers in your own cap! In a one-on-one, we might not be his match!” Yang Jie said with a cold smile.

Hua Ziyou’s expression choked, but he did not refute as well.

He knew that what Yang Jie said was the truth!

This Xiao Feibai’s strength was extremely strong!

Ling Wancheng sighed and said, “This Pill Alliance has hidden dragons and crouching tigers! Within a short two months, they could mobilize so many Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses! Most likely, their strength far exceeds our imagination! This faction is even more terrifying than we imagined!”

Yang Jie nodded slightly and said, “Our five sects can’t be in a state of disunity anymore! At this rate, the dominion that Lord Zhuo Bufan won over will be lost by us eventually!”
