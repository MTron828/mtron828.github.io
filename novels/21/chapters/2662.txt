Chapter 2668: No Amount of Money Can Buy My Joy!

“M-Master Ye?”

Huang Haoyan and Su Peiyun were somewhat stupefied, not knowing why Ye Yuan was walking toward them at this time.

In this place, they were just a pair of unbelievably insignificant minor characters.

But Ye Yuan had indeed walked in front of them.

“I heard that the two of you got engaged. This … is a gift that I prepared for the two of you. Peiyun this girl is pretty good. You mustn’t let her down in the future!” Ye Yuan handed over two wooden boxes with a smile.

“Ah??T-Thank you, Master Ye!” Huang Haoyan received the wooden box with a blank face, uncertain what it meant.

Ye Yuan smiled. Pointing at the wooden box, he said smilingly, “The two of you, use this gift right now. After leaving this place, you guys probably won’t have a chance to use it anymore!”

Huang Haoyan still had a blank look, but Su Peiyun was already trembling from excitement!

Clearly, she already guessed what was in this wooden box.

She smacked the back of Huang Haoyan’s head and had a look of anger from his failure to live up to expectations, and said, “You’re stupid as hell! This is a massive lucky chance! Hurry up and open it! It’s a true grade heavenly pill stored inside here!”

Huang Haoyan’s entire body trembled, his eyes revealing a look of astonishment. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A true grade heavenly pill was something that he did not even dare to think about.

Now, Ye Yuan actually gave it to him for free?

Opening the wooden box to take a look, it was indeed two crystal clear heavenly pills.

Regardless of whether it was Zhao Xun or Min Nanshan, the pupils of the alchemy powerhouses currently present constricted.

“This … This is the Greater Sublime Creation Pill! True grade … heavenly imperial pill!” Min Nanshan’s words were full of astonishment.

Although he had not seen a true grade heavenly pill before, the Great Dao accumulations seeping out of it was clear at a glance to him.

What was even scarier was that this was actually a heavenly imperial pill!

Jiang Li relied on a true grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill and broke through to Jade Sovereign Heaven.

Then, how strong was the medicinal effect of a true grade heavenly imperial pill?

In virtually an instant, many people in the banquet had both eyes turn blood-red.

Their eyes were full of greed.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Finally, someone could not resist making a move!

However, a streak of white light flashed past. The few people who made a move were directly blasted into residue!

Zhao Xun arrived in front of Huang Haoyan two people with a leap and said in a solemn voice, “This hall master wants to see who dares to act rashly! The two of you refine the heavenly pills. This hall master will stand guard over you guys!”

At this time, Head Hall Master Zhao Xun’s deterrent power was finally exhibited!

Min Nanshan and the rest of the Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were itching for a try at this time too.

But, seeing Zhao Xun demonstrate his power, they still did not take action sensibly.

Zhao Xun’s prestige in Heavenly South Pill Hall was not for show.

Which of the Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses present did not receive his favor before?

If the three great families wanted to withdraw from Heavenly South Pill Hall, it was naturally inconvenient for the others to make a move.

But, if it really came down to open hostilities, the three great families did not have confidence in winning at all.

Actually, Zhao Xun’s heart was currently surging with choppy waves too.

Ye Yuan actually brought out true grade heavenly imperial pills the moment he made his move!

He thought that if Ye Yuan could refine an ordinary grade two heavenly pill, it would already be very impressive.

Wanting to refine heavenly imperial pills to true grade, what kind of concept was that?

This was also to say that Ye Yuan had walked much further than they imagined along the path of true grade!

Of course, Zhao Xu was also clear that Ye Yuan had prepared for a long time and was finally making a big move.

At this time, it concerned the future of Heavenly South Pill Hall. He had to anchor the scene!

Didn’t you say that you had never seen before true grade heavenly pills?

Fine, today, I’ll let all of you witness what’s called a true grade heavenly pill!

How could Huang Haoyan two people have experienced such a spectacle before? They were already frightened silly.

In this banquet, the two of them were just small fries, the weakest kind.

If not because their relationship with Ye Yuan was pretty good, they would not even have the qualifications to enter this place.

But now, they were refining heavenly pills under the eyelids of a bunch of Jade Sovereign Heaven and Limitless Sublime Heaven powerhouses!

The pressure was tremendous!

“M-Master Ye, this gift is too precious! It … It’s too much for us! Why don’t you take it back?” Huang Haoyan said with a bitter smile.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No amount of money can buy my joy! I, Ye Yuan, am never stingy to friends. If I say that you’re worthy of it, you’re worthy of it!”

Su Yi let loose a torrent of abuse by the side, saying “You stupid pig, this is a massive lucky chance! You’re actually pushing it away! Your Father doesn’t have a son-in-law like you! Unworthy thing, angering Your Father to death!”

Huang Haoyan turned to look at Su Peiyun and discovered that his fiancée had a look of anticipation too.

This was really a massive lucky chance. After passing by this village, there would not be this shop anymore!

“O-Okay? Then we’ll … refine it!”

Huang Haoyan gritted his teeth and directly swallowed the Greater Sublime Creation Pill.

When the heavenly pill entered his abdomen, an overwhelming force surged crazily towards his small world.

His inner world seemed to have been filled to the brim all at once, the frenzied divine essence flooding in.

The medicinal effects of grade two heavenly imperial pills did not lose to grade three heavenly pills in the first place!

And how many times stronger was the power of true grade heavenly imperial pills compared to ordinary heavenly imperial pills?

What was even more terrifying was that even with such crazed divine essence was pouring in, his entire being actually did not face the slightest rejection!

Huang Haoyan was peak upper Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum in the first place. In virtually an instant, he crossed this threshold and successfully broke through the realm!

Grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven!

Seeing such a terrifying medicinal effect, the expressions of the heavyweights present all changed wildly.

“This … This is also too fast, right? Breaking through the realm was done in a flash!”

“Is this true grade? Utterly terrifying!”

“Even if it’s an upper ninth grade heavenly imperial pill, it’s not worth mentioning at all in front of this medicinal effect too!”

… …

Amidst the shocked voices, Huang Haoyan’s cultivation realm was still increasing rapidly.

The Great Dao accumulations contained in the Greater Sublime Creation Pill let Huang Haoyan give rise to a trace of comprehension.

Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum was right before his eyes!

The scariest thing about true grade heavenly pills was not that terrifying medicinal effect, but that trace of Great Dao accumulation that was integrated inside!

This trace of Great Dao accumulation could inspire the martial artist’s comprehension of heaven and earth.

Jiang Li broke through to Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum precisely because of this trace of enlightenment!

Huang Haoyan’s understanding of Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum became clearer and clearer.

That barrier confining him became more and more fragile.

Finally, with a bang, it broke!

The current Huang Haoyan felt as if he was soaring above the ninth heaven, overlooking the world.

That sort of feeling was wonderful to the extreme!

“Is this Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum?” Huang Haoyan slowly opened both eyes, recollecting the aftertaste endlessly.

His gaze swept over everyone’s faces and discovered that everyone in the main hall was looking at him with blank faces. It was as if they had seen something beyond comprehension.

But by his side, Su Peiyun broke through one step earlier than him!

Two true grade heavenly imperial pills, two Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratums!

Gulp!

Many people involuntarily swallowed a mouthful of saliva, showing their shock currently.

True grade heavenly pill, it truly shocked them!

Zhao Xun looked at the two with a look of surprise and said, “Is … Is this the power of a true grade heavenly imperial pill? From upper Greater Sublime Heaven to lower Limitless Sublime Heaven, it’s merely a snap of a finger! True grade heavenly imperial pill, it’s indeed utterly terrifying!”
