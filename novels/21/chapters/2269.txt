Chapter 2273: Respectful Without Fear!

“Senior Ji Mo, how can an existence like Medicine Ancestor organize such a grand alchemy summit for His Excellency alone?” Yun Yi could not resist asking.

In the Heavenspan World, for all alchemists, the Medicine Ancestor was a god-like existence!

In the path of alchemy, nobody could surpass the Medicine Ancestor.

He was like a totem, even making people not dare to profane.

Even though Ye Yuan was similarly a god-like figure in the hearts of Yun Yi and the rest.

But he was just a Seven-star Alchemy God after all.

They had never doubted that Ye Yuan would reach the realm of Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest in the future.

However, it was not now.

The current Ye Yuan matching up against the Medicine Ancestor, wasn’t it equivalent to strike a rock with an egg?

Ji Mo smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “The Medicine Ancestor is indeed aloof from the masses. He isn’t even inferior to Dao Ancestors in the hearts of alchemists! Only a short while ago, my Lord Sacred Ancestor also viewed him like a god. But, ever since after ‘Ask Not’, Lord Sacred Ancestor threw away all of these emotions. It’s true that the Medicine Ancestor is powerful, but he’s narrow-minded and doesn’t have the capacity to accommodate people! Lord Sacred Ancestor had once been decadent for several tens of millions of years after ‘Ask Not’, and was almost unable to recover from the setback. If not for so, his current strength might not be inferior to Medicine Ancestor’s!”

“This is impossible!” The expressions of Yun Yi and the rest changed wildly.

They were seriously unable to accept that the god in their hearts was actually such a person!

The Medicine Ancestor was the totem of all alchemists. When this totem collapsed, people’s first reaction could only be disbelief.

Power and status could conceal many things sometimes.

He was strong, so he was right in everything.

Even if Sacred Ancestor High Priest talked about Medicine Ancestor’s faults everywhere, he would only be thought of as babbling nonsense, intentionally slandering Medicine Ancestor after defeat.

Now, Ji Mo saying such words, the reactions of Yun Yi and the rest was this.

Ji Mo just smiled and did not speak, not explaining things.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “Nobody is perfect! No matter how strong Deity Realm powerhouses are, they aren’t true gods either. They still have seven emotions and six desires. Even though the Medicine Ancestor is the supreme lord of alchemy, very, unfortunately, he’s such a person. I know that it’s very hard for you all to accept, but I believe this fact shouldn’t be far off than the Medicine Ancestor that I know in the ‘Ask Not’ chess game.”

“This ... This ...”

Yun Yi and the rest had faces of being at a loss on what to do, feeling like their three views were about to collapse.

Ji Mo said coolly, “So this so-called Myriad Region Alchemy Conference is actually to destroy Second Sage’s faith, to crumble the Dao in his heart. This way, Second Sage won’t be able to impact his status anymore.”

Yun Yi and the rest all looked over towards Ye Yuan, shocked expressions on their faces.

They were still feeling honored earlier because Ye Yuan was invited. But now, they could not help worrying about Ye Yuan.

If they had to choose between the Medicine Ancestor and Ye Yuan, they would naturally stand on Ye Yuan’s side without the slightest hesitation.

“Your Excellency, why not ... Let’s not go to this alchemy conference?” Yun Yi said carefully.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Ever since I entered the Heavenspan World, I’ve always imagined fighting against the Medicine Ancestor one day. Now, this opportunity is in front of my eyes, how can I possibly miss it?”

“B-But that’s the Medicine Ancestor!” Yun Yi said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So what if Medicine Ancestor? Yun Yi, only by not having a god in your heart can you become a god! If you regard your master as a god, you won’t ever surpass your master! Your talent, willpower, and character are all superb! But, if you can’t overcome the fear in your heart, you’ll forever only be my disciple! In the hearts of powerhouses, there’s only respect, no fear!”

In the hearts of powerhouses, there was only respect, no fear!

This sentence was like a bolt of lightning, giving people a feeling of enlightening the benighted.

Even Ji Mo’s entire body trembled too.

He did not have a revering heart towards the Medicine Ancestor, but he held Sacred Ancestor High Priest in awe and veneration!

This kind of awe and veneration was deeply imprinted in his bones and had already been over tens of millions of years long.

Surpassing Master, this sort of thing, he did not even dare to think about it!

He suddenly remembered those words that Wing said to him, and finally understood why Ye Yuan would have today’s accomplishments.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “I once said before that I’m Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s opponent. That wasn’t some arrogant remark, but it was that I have the conviction and courage to surpass him! My strength is inferior to him, so what about it? I’ll do my utmost best to make myself become stronger! Even if I fail, I won’t regret it too! I think that Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s thinking should be the same as mine, he’s waiting for me to become stronger! I respect Sacred Ancestor High Priest not because he helped me before, but because he’s an opponent worthy of respect! But the Medicine Ancestor isn’t!”

Ji Mo was shocked speechless!

The words that Ye Yuan said were virtually identical to what his master said!

Could it be that this was the tacit understanding between the strong?

His master said before, he was not afraid of failure!

What he was afraid of having no opponent!

Even though Ye Yuan’s current strength was still worlds apart from Master.

But Ye Yuan’s might already made people unable to look directly at it!

By the side, Yun Yi’s mind shook heavily.

He understood that his master was teaching him to become a true powerhouse.

This kind of education had nothing to do with skills. It only cared about the heart of a powerhouse!

Only by not having a god in your heart can you become a god!

He had always thought that awe was a term.

But only now did he discover that he was wrong.

Respect was respect, fear was fear.

Respect, but do not be daunted!

Yun Yi sucked in a deep breath and nodded his head solemnly as he said, “Master, I understand!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you understand, cultivate your heart well! Talking about it is easy, but doing it is as hard as ascending to heaven!”

Ji Mo got up and carried out the etiquette of a disciple, bowing respectfully toward Ye Yuan and said, “Thank you for Second Sage’s pointers!”

Ye Yuan accepted it calmly and said with a smile, “Is the Medicine Ancestor taking action because of the Chaos Samsara Pill?”

Ji Mo nodded. Ye Yuan continued, “Refining the Chaos Samsara Pill, I seem to have touched the source of Alchemy Dao. That seems to be another realm that surmounts Ancestor Realm! Looks like Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest they all are at this level.”

Ji Mo thought about it and asked, “How confident is Second Sage in this battle?”

Ye Yuan directly shook his head and said, “Not even 10%!”

Everyone’s expressions changed, but then they heard Ye Yuan say with a laugh, “But for Medicine Ancestor to want to borrow this to attack my Dao heart, he’s probably thinking too much. Alright, you go back first then, I want to take a trip to the Heavenspan Mountain. After I break through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm, I’ll go to the Priest Temple.”

Ji Mo bowed in salute and took his leave.

Ye Yuan was very confident, but he was not blindly confident.

The opponent this time was the Heavenspan World’s alchemy path’s number one person!

This person had stood at the apex of the Heavenspan World’s alchemy path for trillions of years, no one had been able to shake it before.

His might did not need words to explain at all.

Being the first meant having to accept endless challenges!

Sacred Ancestor High Priest was just one of them.

For the Medicine Ancestor to be able to persevere and not fall, that was battled out with absolute strength, and not being touted by others.

Facing such an opponent, Ye Yuan did not have any confidence at all.

But so what?

He, Ye Yuan, would never give up!
