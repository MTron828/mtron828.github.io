Chapter 1536 Conferring Name

Ye Yuan making people not disturb was not really because he was afraid of people disturbing, but that his medicinal cauldron was too shocking.

Once the matter that he had a divine lord mystic treasure on him leaked out, what he would face would likely be the frenzied pursuit of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses.

In this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City where divine lords walked everywhere, Ye Yuan did not dare to be careless.

After two hours, a newly refined Detoxification Pill was completed.

This was the Detoxification Pill that Ye Yuan developed himself. It was very different from the rank three Detoxification Pill in the world.

“Divine-grade!” When the chief head saw the pill, his two eyes gave off rays of brilliant light.

A rank three divine-grade divine pill, this was not what anybody could refine!

Wu Feng was known as the south city’s number one alchemist. At the very most, he could only refine superior-grade divine pills.

Just this even needed a massive burst of luck.

But this young man in front of him, the moment he made his move, it was divine-grade!

The chief head drew a breath of cold air, endlessly shocked as he looked at Ye Yuan.

But he discovered the problem very soon and could not help saying puzzledly, “Master, what ... what medicinal pill is this?’

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said, “Detoxification Pill, what medicinal pill can it be still? Could it be that I’m letting him eat a medicinal pill to increase cultivation right now? Not eating? Give back to me if not eating.”

The chief head’s hand hurriedly shrank back and he said awkwardly, “M-Master, I didn’t mean that. Master might not be aware, the Crimson Fire Bone Corroding Poison is very powerful. Ordinary detoxification pills can’t cure it. Only by prescribing the right remedy for it one can cure the poison.”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and was just about to lose his temper when the chief head directly came to the bedside subserviently and stuffed the medicinal pill down the second head’s mouth.

He only questioned it instinctively. After all, the Crimson Fire Bone Corroding Poison’s power was rather famous.

But he discovered very quickly that his doubts were totally unjustified.

The master even joined back the heart meridians, could this medicinal pill be a bluff?

Furthermore, it was a divine-grade medicinal pill!

Sure enough, the second head whose complexion was black took a turn for the better very soon.

The medicinal pill’s efficacy was amazingly good.

“What a powerful Detoxification Pill! This ... Just how long has it been, Second Brother’s poison is actually gone?”

“Yeah. Even the Crimson Fire Bone Corroding Poison’s detoxification pill doesn’t have such a fast effect too!”

“What detoxification pill is this, it’s too exaggerated! Compared to this, those detoxification pills on the market are simply trash!”

The few brothers cried out with exclamations, all stunned by Ye Yuan’s detoxification pill.

They all, these gangs, lived a life on the edge every day. Getting injured and poisoned was all too normal.

If there was such a medicinal pill, who would still be afraid of getting poisoned?

Thud!

After the second head got up, he immediately knelt down in front of Ye Yuan and said respectfully, “Many thanks for Master’s life-saving grace. Zhu Yong won’t ever forget it!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Heh, don’t need to thank me. I didn’t treat you without conditions.”

As he said, his gaze looked towards the chief head and said, “Chief Head, don’t forget our agreement!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Chief Head was also forthright, nodding and said, “I, Xing Guan, am a man of his word. Since I promised Master Ye, I naturally won’t renege! But ... this Xing has a presumptuous request.”

Ye Yuan thought nothing of it and said coolly, “Tell me about it.”

Chief Head said, “I heard that Master Ye has just entered Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. I wonder if you have a place to go to?”

Ye Yuan froze and said, “Place to go ... There is. It’s just that it seems like I can’t go in right now.”

These few days, he already had Ah Four take care of this matter. But it seemed like it could not be resolved in a short while.

The difficulty of entering the inner city seemed to be even greater than he imagined.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City made clear distinctions, inner city and outer cities were like two different worlds.

Inner city was the place where the imperial city’s elites were located.

Chief Head said, “Since that’s the case, Master Ye needs a place to stay as well. Why not ... join our Dragon ... our gang, how’s that? Master, rest assured. All of your expenses will be borne by us!”

Ye Yuan gave Xing Guan a glance with a smile that was not a smile and said, “You all bear it? Do you know how much divine essence stones are needed to raise a Three-star alchemy god?”

Chief Head’s expression could not help choking up, revealing a blush.

He was just harboring the thought of giving it a try. Indeed it could not work out!

Master Ye’s level was much more formidable than Wu Feng. How could he take fancy on the Dragon Slaying Gang?

Even though alchemists were very rich, they burned even more money.

If they could afford to raise, they would have long raised one. Why would they wait until now?

Those capable of raising alchemists were just the three great families, this kind of major families with deep foundations.

Even though their three gangs were part of the six great factions, compared to the three great families, they were still much worse.

The streets that the three major gangs managed, those were all side-streets that the three great families did not take fancy on.

The truly prosperous areas were all controlled in the hands of the three great families.

Chief Head had an embarrassed look as he said, “This ... It was this Xing who was rash, hope that Master Ye doesn’t take offense.”

How could Ye Yuan not know what idea Xing Guan had? They offended Wu Feng to the core this time and was afraid of being suppressed by Wu Feng. That was why he would hope for him to stay.

Wu Feng was known as the south city’s number one alchemist. He naturally had immense summoning power.

If he could not treat the second head, then forget it. Xing Guan they all going to admit their mistake and gift some divine essence stones. Only then they could resolve the issue.

But he treated the second head. Wu Feng definitely would not spare any effort to suppress the Dragon Slaying Gang for the sake of his face.

At that time, their situation would be awkward.

Wu Feng this kind of existence was what any party wanted to rope in.

Hence, the current Dragon Slaying Gang’s situation was very pessimistic.

The current Xing Guan could not bring out the air of a half-step Divine Lord in front of Ye Yuan at all.

Alchemists were this awesome.

Even if his realm was not as high as yours, you did not dare to offend either.

Especially when Ye Yuan was the Dragon Slaying Gang’s only hope now.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Letting me stay behind, it’s also not impossible. But ... I won’t join in your gangs’ struggles. In addition, you guys prepare a shop for me.”

Xing Guan’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

The other few brothers similarly had stunned faces, their eyes when looking at Ye Yuan was full of incredulity.

A-Agreed just like this?

Originally, they already lost all hope. They id not expect that Ye Yuan did a 180-degree turn and actually agreed to it!

Immediately, their faces revealed a look of wild elation.

“Haha, no problem! Whatever you need, Master Ye feel free to open your mouth! Oh, right, since Master requests us to change names, then ... why not confer a name?” Xing Guan said with great joy.

Ye Yuan agreeing to Xing Guan naturally had his considerations.

He discovered that wanting to enter the inner city was really a very difficult thing.

That Ah Four probably could not be counted on.

The Myriad Treasure Tower was probably a first-rate major force in the inner city too.

Ah Four this kind of small fish, how could he get in contact with that kind of existence?

Since that was the case, he might as well find a place to settle down first.

Although this Dragon Slaying Gang was of lowly status, they were faithful and loyal to friends, and also quite trustworthy, making Ye Yuan feel pretty good.

Since he was unable to enter the inner city, let the Myriad Treasure Tower come find him then.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “A sudden clap of thunder out of the blue, why not ... use the name Thunderclap Gang then.”
