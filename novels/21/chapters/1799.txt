1803 Rage

There were no years inside the abode. Time flew, 200 years passed in a flash.

On Firecloud Peak, it was still so desolate and barren.

But on this day, there were several additional figures on the peak.

One of them looked around in a panic and said fearfully, “I heard that this Firecloud Peak has quite a few rank five fierce beasts. I hope we won’t run into them!”

The person in the lead said, “Scared of what? Firecloud Peak is so big. There are only that few rank five fierce beasts, they will just happen to be encountered by us? As long as we pluck the Crimson Tail Grass, we’ll be able to complete the sect’s mission!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Another person complained, “Really damn it! Why did this Crimson Tail Grass have to grow on Firecloud Peak? Firecloud Peak is more dangerous compared to most of the other places in the Shadowmoon Mountain Range!”

Suddenly, the eyes of that person leading lit up and he said in great joy, “Crimson Tail Grass!”

Everyone looked, there was indeed a small tuft of spirit medicine not far away. The crimson-colored leaves trailed very long, like a tail.

The few people were overjoyed and hurriedly dashed over.

But right at this time, an aura that almost made them suffocate suddenly appeared.

Then, an enormous bear appeared in front of them.

“Desolate Cloud Ancient Bear! R-Rank five fierce beast! W-Wouldn’t be so coincidental, right?”

When that person in the lead saw the old bear, his face immediately turned deathly pale, his pair of legs quaking.

He was a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord powerhouse too, but in front of the old bear, his strength was completely not enough to look at.

The Desolate Cloud Ancient Bear’s eyes revealed a murderous gleam and said angrily, “A few damn bugs came to interrupt your Grandpa Bear’s cultivation again! You guys really deserve to die!”

As he said, he swung a big slap over.

Under this horrifying pressure, those few Shadowmoon Sect disciples could not muster up any desire to resist at all, closing their eyes and waiting for death.

“Old bear, don’t harm their lives.”

Suddenly, a voice came out of the dense woods. The old bear’s expressions turned solemn, his aura immediately dissipating with the wind.

Those few disciples let out a long sigh in relief, feeling joyful from surviving a disaster.

“Disciple Lin Fan thanks Senior for your life-saving grace!”

That disciple in the lead bowed down in the direction of the voice. The others also followed suit one after another.

In Lin Fan’s view, to be able to stop a rank five fierce beast with a word, that must be a deacon-level existence.

Otherwise, with the ferocious nature of fierce beasts, how could it possibly listen obediently?

The old bear said with a disgruntled look, “Ye brat, you finally came out of seclusion!”

In the dense woods, a youth in white slowly walked out. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

When that group of disciples saw Ye Yuan, their eyeballs almost popped out.

They even thought about which senior or expert he was. Messing around for half a day, he was actually the same as them, all Divine Lord Realm martial artists!

Except, why would a rank five fierce beast be so obedient?

Ye Yuan looked at the Desolate Cloud Ancient Bear and said with a smile, “Old bear, you don’t need to show an appearance like you suffered bitterly and have a deep hatred. In these 200 years, your strength also increased considerably. So shouldn’t you thank me?”

Ye Yuan’s seclusion took 200 years’ time.

The Obstructed Tillage Spirit Eye’s abundant energy also made Ye Yuan’s realm rise rapidly within the 200 years, breaking through to Ninth Firmament Divine Lord in one stroke.

The three fierce beasts naturally also had a great increase in strength under such berserk spiritual energy.

Presently, their strength was already comparable to a human Second Firmament Celestial Deity.

Seeing Ye Yuan mention it, the old bear smiled embarrassedly and said, “Heh heh, isn’t it still all thanks to you?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Good that you know!”

When those few disciples heard Ye Yuan and the Desolate Cloud Ancient Bear chatting, each and every one of them was shocked until it could not be greater.

When could a human chat so peacefully with fierce beasts?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan was just a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord!

Hearing them talk, Ye Yuan seemed to live in this Firecloud Peak.

Wasn’t it said that Firecloud Peak was still a barren land, people who opened up abodes all died here?

Then ... what was going on here?”

Ye Yuan glanced at the Crimson Tail Grass not far away and said coolly, “You guys are here to look for the Crimson Tail Grass?”

Lin Fan drew a deep breath and said with clasped hands, “Yes. Junior Apprentice Brother, could this place be ... your abode?”

Ye Yuan slowly nodded, considered to have tacitly acknowledged it, and responded with a question, “Which sub-peak are you all from?”

Lin Fan did not dare to dawdle and answered, “The few of us are from Heavenly Heart Peak. Because we received the sect’s missions and need to use the Crimson Tail Grass, that’s why we came to Firecloud Peak. We didn’t expect to disturb Junior Apprentice Brother’s quiet cultivation.”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “It just so happens that I exited seclusion today. Otherwise, Old Bear probably won’t let you guys off.”

His words made everyone’s hearts clench, secretly thinking that they got lucky.

That slap of Old Bear smacking down earlier, none of them could escape!

But what surprised them even more was that this rank five fierce beast was actually guarding Ye Yuan’s door.

Who in the world was this guy?

Opening up an abode on Firecloud Peak, this young man should be Tianying Peak’s disciple. But when did Tianying Peak produce such a monstrous existence?

Ye Yuan suddenly thought of something and asked Lin Fan, “Oh, right, I have a good brother called Han Yong, also at your Heavenly Heart Peak. Not seeing him for 200 years, I wonder how he’s been doing recently?”

After the entrance examination back then, Ye Yuan, Han Yong, Yang Fan, and the rest were assigned to different sub-peaks.

Han Yong, Yang Fan, and the rest had their own lineages as backers. The sub-peaks that they were assigned to naturally would not be too lousy as well.

Heavenly Heart Peak was already considered average level among the nine peaks, the resources were still rather abundant.

Mentioning Han Yong, Lin Fan’s face could not help changing.

Ye Yuan’s heart thumped, immediately having a foreboding premonition.

His expression turned cold, a terrifying aura crept out from his body.

“What’s wrong with him?”

Feeling Ye Yuan’s powerful aura, Lin Fan felt like he was almost suffocating.

That was the aura of death!

Only now did he know that similarly Ninth Firmament Divine Lords, but Ye Yuan was god knows how many times stronger than him!

“After Han Yong entered the sect, he improved very quickly and became an outer-sect elite very fast. But, in the last Nine Peaks Competition, Han Yong ran into Heavenly Bud Peak’s Zhong Hanlin. In the end, he was dealt a deadly blow by Zhong Hanlin on the stage. Now ... Now, he’s already a cripple, being relegated as a miscellaneous affairs disciple.”

When Lin Fang said finish, he discovered that a layer of frost already hung on Ye Yuan’s face, and his heart could not help pounding.

He seemed to have seen a blazing fury on Ye Yuan’s body.

This was bristling with anger, right?

“You guys pick the Crimson Tail Grass and leave,” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Lin Fan was akin to being granted amnesty, being endlessly grateful toward Ye Yuan. Only then did he bid farewell and left.

After the few people left, Ye Yuan’s face was cold as frost as he gritted his teeth and said, “Qian Ye, Zhong Hanlin, you guys are really ballsy enough!”

Ye Yuan naturally understood in his heart. Han Yong was remembered by Zhong Hanlin, and hence, he was being implicated by him.

His feud with the Soaring Flower lineage grew deeper and deeper.

Han Yong this person was very crude, but he was very straightforward and also very loyal. He was deserving of being a good brother.

“Old Bear, you guys help me watch over the abode well. I have some matters and need to go somewhere,” Ye Yuan said to the old bear.

Old Bear nodded and said, “Relax, with the three of us around, unless it’s the Shadowmoon Sect’s deacon powerhouses that come, otherwise, no one can touch this place!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, feet striding out, his figure disappearing from Firecloud Peak.
