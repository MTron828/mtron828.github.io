Chapter 1445 Too Late!

Under everyone’s stares, Bai Chen slowly ate the Dao Fruit.

They all swallowed their salivas, staring at Bai Chen eagerly, their eyes full of envy.

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled, the light in his eyes gradually fading. A milky-white light screen enveloped him.

Bai Chen was like a fetus that returned to his mother’s body, curling up in the light screen, and falling asleep.

A boundless aura of Great Dao gradually spread out.

Rumble ...

The entire Divine Ruins started trembling, while this dome started collapsing, rubbles falling down one after another.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The Flame Wandering Universe Grand Array of the Eight Desolates actually started collapsing. Those fireballs scattered everywhere gradually disappeared.

“Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, I want to see who can still save you now!”

The pressure reducing drastically, Qin Tian let out a wild laugh.

He was tormented by this grand array until he was about to go crazy. Just now, in order to snatch the Dao Fruit, he even piled injuries on top of his injuries.

While on the other side, Duan Fei was even more miserable than him.

Duan Fei, from head to toe, one could use the phrase being riddled with a thousand gapping words to describe him. There was virtually not an area that was in good condition.

Ye Yuan nonchalantly gave Qin Tian a glance and said disdainfully, “Just based on your condition, you also want to kill you?”

Ye Yuan’s contemptuous eyes deeply stimulated Qin Tian and he said furiously, “I’m Wu Meng Academy’s number one genius! A measly initial-stage Heavenly Dao dares to utter wild raving?! Die!”

Qin Tian shouted loudly, his figure rampaging, charging toward Ye Yuan like lightning.

Except, his aura was already far weaker than his peak.

Ye Yuan laughed coldly. His figure swayed and vanished from where he was.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

The two people turned into two phantoms, exchanging several rounds like lightning.

Evenly matched!

Qin Tian’s internal organs suffered severe injuries, in addition to Heavenly Dao’s suppression, his current strength was even worse than before breaking through.

Chasing Moon this move, what it emphasized was the unification of man and sword, destroying a solid dike with an ant hole, the speed swift to the extreme.

Ye Yuan went at full firepower, the strength that he erupted with instantly was not the least bit worse than Qin Tian’s!

Under this sort of strange state, the two people’s strength actually reached a strange balance.

The two were people with extremely powerful combat strength. This contest that was well-matched in strength shocked until the dome collapsed rapidly, debris flying everywhere.

“Duan Fei, go kill that brat! Otherwise, when he refines the Dao Fruit, you’ll die until not even dregs can be left behind!”

In the fierce battle, Qin Tian’s bellow sounded out.

Duan Fei was already incomparably tragic under the fireballs’ attacks.

His Dao foundation was already ruined. Even if his injuries healed, his strength could not advance a step further anymore as well.

Qin Tian’s words sounded by his ear like a clap of thunder. He abruptly startled awake, pouncing over toward Bai Chen like lightning.

Although Duan Fei similarly suffered a great loss in strength, he was an Origin Deity powerhouse in the end.

With his strength, Bai Xiu and the rest were really not a match.

However, Bai Xiu did not hesitate in the slightest, directly blocking in front of Bai Chen.

He already harbored the resolve of certain death and had to stop Duan Fei’s attack.

Mo Yun and the rest of the elders also all rushed over, attempting to stop Duan Fei’s footsteps.

Duan Fei gritted his teeth, ignoring the injuries on his body, and unleashing all of his remaining divine essence!

“Grand Luo Bo Ruo Palm!”

Duan Fei shouted fiercely. A terrifying aura rippled out, causing the faces of Bai Xiu and the rest to change drastically.

With Duan Fei’s current injuries, if they wanted to escape, it could be done.

But behind him was Bai Chen!

“Protect Palace Lord to the death! Everybody attack with me!” Bai Xiu gritted his teeth and said.

“Yes!” Everyone did not shrink back at all, each executing various means, meeting that terrifying palm force.

Duan Fei laughed coldly and said, “A bunch of blind and reckless things! Since you all are seeking death, then this divine official will send you all to the western paradise!”

Finished talking, Duan Fei urged his palm force. A terrifying energy that blotted out the skies and covered the earth fired over in Bai Chen’s direction.

“Hahaha, that brat is about to die in front of you right away! Are you very desperate? Relax, you’ll also follow him to hell right away!” Qin Tian said with a big laugh. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Swoosh!

In the air, a hint of lightning laws suddenly flashed past.

Then, Qin Tian’s smile froze on his face. He lost Ye Yuan’s traces!

Ye Yuan disappeared from in front of him once more!

Qin Tian’s expression changed, and he said with great astonishment, “It’s ... It’s Heavenly Thunder Swift Talismans! Damn Thundercry! It’s his Heavenly Thunder Swift Talismans!”

Previously, the scene of Ye Yuan snatching the Dao Fruit was too sudden. Qin Tian did not react in time at all.

Now, he finally knew why Ye Yuan would disappear!

Chasing Moon plus Heavenly Thunder Swift Talisman!

When Ye Yuan unleashed Chasing Moon this move, he mobilized the Heavenly Thunder Swift Talisman at the same time! It could be said to be accelerating on top of speed!

The Heavenly Thunder Swift Talisman was Thundercry’s proud work. Once unleashed, even ordinary Origin Deity powerhouses could not catch up too!

Even though Ye Yuan was unable to unleash the Heavenly Thunder Swift Talisman’s full power, established on the basis of Chasing Moon, this move, coupled with the Heavenly Thunder Swift Talisman, his speed could virtually rival Origin Deity Realms.

Furthermore, with the Heavenly Thunder Swift Talisman’s augmentation, the power of Chasing Moon, this move, was even more terrifying!

Swish!

Qin Tian shuddered, hearing the sound of a long sword passing through the flesh.

The eyes of the originally imposing Duan Fei gradually became lax.

That terrifying palm also directly dissipated without a trace.

Bai Xiu and the rest who were akin to facing a great enemy suddenly felt the pressure on their bodies easing up.

Then, they saw Duan Fei fall down feebly in front of them.

Duan Fei, dead!

The entire process was just a split second. Everybody did not react to it.

By the time they reacted to it, Duan Fei was already dead.

Swoosh ...

However, the nightmare still continued.

Qin Tian shuddered again. The scent of death hit him head-on!

With his strength, he actually only saw an afterimage charge over toward him.

Clank!

In his haste, Qin Tian instinctively swung out a slash.

Qin Tian only felt a tremendous force transmit over. The originally suppressed injuries could not be suppressed any longer, a mouthful of fresh blood spewing out wildly, his body flying out backward.

“Not over yet! Again!”

Ye Yuan’s cold voice was like a death-hastening talisman, sounding out by Qin Tian’s ear.

Qin Tian felt his scalp tingle. But this move of Ye Yuan’s was too terrifying. He only managed to block it just now by relying on his instinctive reaction to danger.

The next sword, he did not have any confidence to block it!

Swish!

Qin Tian only felt a blur before his eyes, Ye Yuan arrived again!

Clank!

It was actually blocked again by him like a blind cat bumping into a dead rat!

It was just that under this immense force, the sword in Qin Tian’s hand could not be held on anymore, slipping out of his hand, eventually falling into the magma.

“You’re dead!”

Ye Yuan’s nightmare-like words sounded out by Qin Tian’s ears once again.

Qin Tian’s pupils constricted, using a near trembling voice to beg, “I was wrong! Ye Yuan, I was really wrong! L-Let’s reconcile!”

“Too late!”

Ye Yuan’s voice was icy-cold without the slightest emotion, sounding out beside Qin Tian’s ear for the last time.

Pfft!

The Evil Extermination Sword easily pierced the Heavenly Feather Flexible Armor, the long sword penetrating right through the internal organs!
