Chapter 1656 Dao Ancestor“s Helplessness

“To actually invite the descendant of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, looks like the things this time is really very good!” Dustless suddenly said.

Ye Yuan was rather surprised as he said, “Oh? Is this Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets very powerful?”

Dustless said, “More than powerful! He can observe the destiny of what’s under the heavens, talk about the life and death of martial artists, differentiate the truth and falsehood of myriad things, and is one of the most mysterious and most terrifying existences among transcendent heavenly emperors! Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ art of observing aura is unparalleled under the heavens! See that divine essence? That’s called profound secrets divine essence. Only Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets and his descendants can cultivate this kind of divine essence. It’s similar to a bloodline inheritance.”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “There’s still such a mysterious divine essence?”

Dustless nodded and said, “If Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets says that someone can become a heavenly emperor, that person will definitely become a heavenly emperor powerhouse! If he says someone will die halfway, that person is bound to meet with a premature end! As long as it’s things that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets predicted, it has never been wrong before!”

Ye Yuan was incomparably shocked in his heart. He did not expect that there was actually still a powerhouse who discerned heaven’s secrets so thoroughly!

What Ye Yuan did not know was that just a little earlier, Dao Ancestor Life quietly arrived at Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s manor.

“Profound Secrets, 500 years ago, Heavenspan Mountain’s abnormality, what do you think about it?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets gave Dao Ancestor Life a very meaningful glance and said with a smile, “Life, it’s not like you don’t know my rules. Matters regarding the Heavenspan Mountain, I’m completely ignorant!”

If outsiders were to know that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets actually talked to Dao Profound Life like this, they would definitely be incomparably shocked.

Dao Ancestors were high and above, showing disdain upon the world.

Even transcendent Heavenly Emperors were ants in front of them too.

But this Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets actually did not have the least bit of respect toward Dao Ancestor Life.

Dao Ancestor Life frowned and said, “This, I naturally know. I just wanted to ask you if the time has come or not!”

When saying this, Dao Ancestor Life had a solemn look, as if encountering an earth-shaking matter.

Something that could make a Dao Ancestor powerhouse so visibly moved naturally would not be that simple.

Profound Secrets heaved a sigh and said, “You’ve experienced the last epoch, you naturally have an idea in mind. This kind of thing, is there still a need to ask me? Everyone says that Dao Ancestors can live forever, but that’s just because they don’t live long enough. In this world, what can live forever is probably just the Heavenspan Mountain, right? Or maybe, even the Heavenspan Mountain isn’t undying and indestructible too! This kind of thing, who knows.”

Dao Ancestor Life’s expression changed. Profound Secrets’s words poked his sore spot.

The world all said that Dao Ancestors were above worldly considerations, but they did not know that Dao Ancestors had Dao Ancestors’ hardships too.

“In that case, it’s really coming?” Dao Ancestor Life said in a low voice.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled and said, “Oh, Old Mei, so many years have passed, you still haven’t gotten over it? Life and death are decreed by fate. It’s not what you and I can control.”

Dao Ancestor Life’s expression flickered incessantly, and he said with a sigh, “Saying is easy but doing it is difficult!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets gave him a glance and suddenly said, “On that day, I observed the celestial phenomena at night. In the south, Purple Qi surged to the sky. An abnormality is bound to happen. But this heaven’s secret, I can’t perceive it.”

Dao Ancestor Life’s gaze turned intent, his figure suddenly disappeared.

“Vast Universe!”

Before long, a middle-aged man appeared in front of Dao Ancestor Life.

“Dao Ancestor!” Heavenly Emperor Vast Universe said respectfully.

Heavenly Emperor Vast Universe was slightly fearful in his heart. It was rare for the dao ancestor to summon him one in a million years, what was this today?”

Dao Ancestor Life nodded and said, “You immediately send people to the south and search carefully for me. See in this recent 500 years, what kind of heaven and earth phenomenon appeared! I don’t want anything left out, understand?”

Heavenly Emperor Vast Universe hurriedly said, “Yes, this subordinate understands! This subordinate will go and send people right away!”

...

“In front of everyone, it’s the appetizer that the auction this time is starting with. Divine Dao rank five martial technique, Heavenly Profound Divine Sword! This martial technique is very powerful, one can cultivate all the way to Celestial Deity Realm! Each level cultivated, one can virtually sweep across all in the same rank! The base price is ten billion! Each increment has to be no less than 500 million!”

Jian Zhentao was clearly very experienced with this kind of auction because of his vast experience, stirring up the atmosphere at the scene with a few sentences.

Divine Dao rank five martial techniques were martial techniques created by at least Celestial Deity powerhouses. The power was naturally extraordinary.

And this cultivation method was clearly even more extraordinary. Jian Zhentao used sweeping across those in the same rank to describe it, it clearly let the auction liven up all at once even more authoritatively.

Very soon, this Divine Dao rank five martial technique was sold at a price of 16.5 billion.

Ye Yuan was not interested in this. No matter how strong the martial technique, it was also not as good as what was suitable for him.

Clearly, the Misty Sword Art was the most suitable for him!

The Misty Sword Art that was based on the Chaos Heavenspan Canon was something no martial technique could replace.

Sweeping across those in the same rank was merely a joke in front of Ye Yuan.

His current combat strength could already kill the majority of first-layered heaven Divine Lords.

Same rank?

To Ye Yuan, there was only jumping realms!

Uncle Huang persuaded ardently before Jing Lu realized Riverluck Capital City’s remarkableness, and also understood what their threat meant.

Jing Lu was arranged in the heaven rank area, which was also a private room. It was just that the private room was far lacking compared to the supreme area. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Young Patriarch, our goal this time is the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone. If the divine essence stones aren’t enough when the time comes, what should we do?” Uncle Huang said.

Jing Lu waved his hand and said full of confidence, “No worries, we brought 120 billion this time. It’s enough to win the bid for the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone. The Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone is useful to the Divine Lord Realm, while its value to the Celestial Deity Realm isn’t that much. The price won’t be too high. This is a complete Divine Dao rank five martial technique. Our Melody Sun Imperial City obtaining it is also akin to adding wings to a tiger, who dares to say anything?”

Uncle Huang saw Jing Lu’s aloof and indifferent appearance and could not help letting out a sigh and no longer urged.

He knew this young patriarch’s temper. Say anymore and he would get angry.

The price of 16.5 billion already exceeded the value of this martial technique. Uncle Huang felt that it was not worth it.

It was just that these words, he did not dare to say it.

Afterward, several more things were auctioned. The final transaction prices were basically all above 20 billion.

The good things tonight were truly a lot!

But these things were not indispensable to Ye Yuan. He could not muster up much interest.

“I believe that tonight, quite a number of people are aiming for an auction item. This piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone was discovered in an ore lode. Not only is the chunk extremely big, but it’s also very pure. This old man has already appraised it. It’s most suitable to use to help ninth-layered heaven Divine Lords and half-step Celestial Deity powerhouses to comprehend Heavenly Dao. This piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone, the base price is 28 billion. Each increment is no less than one billion! Now, start bidding!”

“35 billion!” The moment Jian Zhentao’s voice faded, someone immediately raised by seven billion divine essence stones.

Uncle Huang was slightly disappointed at the side. This Young Patriarch Jing Lu was still too young, no patience at all.

Auctions this sort of thing, what was play was psychological warfare. How was it competing on the volume of voice?

“37 billion!”

“40 billion!”

“50 billion!”

Jing Lu directly added another 10 billion, everyone became quiet.
