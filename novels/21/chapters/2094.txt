Chapter 2098: High Priest Redplume’s invitation

It was simply very hard for people who did not truly learn the rudiments of spatial law to imagine how profound this law was.

The higher the realm, the more accomplished with high proficiency the application of spatial law. It would instead form more of an illusion. That would be so for someone who was actually already very skilled in the aspect of spatial law.

However, being able to be called a supreme law, how could spatial law be that easy?

Martial artists’ understanding of law was just one aspect, the ingenuity in varying tactics depends on mother wit.

With Ye Yuan’s attainments in the aspect of spatial law, even if he was not an Empyrean’s match, if an Empyrean wanted to kill him, it was not as simple as dying to one palm.

Very clearly, Empyrean Vast Wind was misled just like that.

In reality, the Empyreans present were all deceived by Ye Yuan.

“Alright, you’ve experienced it now. You can give up hope now, right? Huntwind, send him on his way!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Eh, alright! Haha, it’s still Lord Second Sage who is impressive. Otherwise, this old bear, I, would have to expend considerable effort to kill him!” Empyrean Huntwind rubbed his fists and wiped his palms, appearing extremely excited.

He and Vast Wind were the demon race’s and the human race’s number one person. The two people had fought for no idea how many years.

Today, he could finally eliminate this guy. So how could he not be excited?

Huntwind’s palm carried horrifying power, directly annihilating Empyrean Vast Wind.

The all-powerful lord of the extreme north, Empyrean Vast Wind, was annihilated just like that.

As for Empyrean Windlike, it was naturally even less necessary to go into details. Under the garroting of the group of demon race Empyreans, he fell in battle very quickly.

“Young Master!”

At this time, Lu-er’s figure slowly walked out of the void, akin to a fairy maiden descending upon the world.

Even if these demon race Empyreans saw, they also could not help becoming absent-minded.

Ye Yuan looked at Lu-er and could not help sighing. The thin and frail young lass back then already grew into a tall and graceful lady now.

The current Lu-er did not lose to Li-er and Mu Lingxue, the two great goddesses, in terms of looks in the slightest.

Furthermore, Lu-er’s Profound Yin body bestowed on her a disposition as clean as ice and as pure as jade, akin to a fairy maiden that had transcended the mundane world.

“Huhu, it’s all over! In the future, this young master won’t let you suffer any harm again!” Ye Yuan lightly caressed Lu-er’s head and said smilingly.

Lu-er nodded her head and said, “It was Lu-er who caused trouble for Young Master.”

Not far away, Yang Fei-er looked at this scene with an envious look.

In Ice Cloud Tower, Yang Fei-er was the closest to Lu-er and naturally knew that she always kept that young master in her thoughts.

It was just that in her view, that so-called young master was not worthy of Lu-er at all.

Lu-er was exceptionally talented. There were practically no obstacles in corroborating her Dao as an Empyrean in the future at all, while that young master was merely a puny little imperial city’s alchemist.

A thousand years later, the two people would long already not be on the same level anymore.

But when she knew Ye Yuan’s identity, Yang Fei-er was thoroughly stunned.

Lu-er’s young master was actually so freakishly talented!

If it was merely talent, forget it. The series of events that happened later made her shocked until it could not be any greater.

Eradicating He Xiangyun with his fist, slaying Feng Tianyang with his sword, and even obliterating Empyrean Ice Cloud with a heaven-shocking attack.

Now, even the leader of the extreme north’s human race, Empyrean Vast Wind, also died in his hands.

Not just so, he even became the demon race’s Second Sage. Even the Empyrean Huntwind that Empyrean Vast Wind who was very wary of was also submissive and obedient to him.

This kind of peerlessly heroic man, which woman could not admire?

Yang Fei-er sighed faintly and actually became somewhat envious of Lu-er.

Ye Yuan comforted Lu-er a while and suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Already watched for so long, still not showing yourself?”

Huntwind and the rest of the Empyreans exchanged glances, looking all around, and did not discover traces of other people at all.

Suddenly, a layer of ripple emerged in space. A figure was like a ripple, slowly condensing and forming into an old man like

The old man had a goatee, looking very amiable.

When Huntwind looked at the arrival, he could not help opening his eyes wide.

He, this Seventh Firmament Empyrean powerhouse, did not even discover the arrival, Ye Yuan discovered him? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

No wonder Sacred Ancestor High Priest valued Lord Second Sage so highly. He was indeed extraordinary!

Previously, his awe toward Ye Yuan mostly originated from Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

But now, he discovered that this Second Sage was really not simple.

However, what shocked him even more was this goatee old man. With his strength, he actually could not fathom the old man’s depths!

The goatee old man gave a bow towards Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “This old man Gongyang Lie[1], as a servant by High Priest Redplume’s side, pays respect to Lord Second Sage!”

Toward goat beard’s self-introduction, Ye Yuan did not have any reaction. But each and every one of the demon race Empyreans present, their eyeballs nearly popped out.

“H-High Priest Redplume! Extreme north’s Huntwind pays respect to Lord Gongyang!” Empyrean Huntwind actually knelt straight down, knees hitting the ground.

“Paying respect to Lord Gongyang!” The group of Empyreans all prostrated.

Ye Yuan was at a loss and said in puzzlement, “High Priest Redplume? Who is that?”

The goat beard’s brows furrowed slightly, but he still explained, “High Priest Redplume is the eleventh disciple under Sacred Ancestor High Priest; one of the demon race’s strongest 11 people in terms of Alchemy Dao apart from the Sacred Ancestor High Priest himself!”

Ye Yuan was enlightened the moment he heard this.

This High Priest Redplume was Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s little disciple.

Not just any random Tom, Dick, or Harry, could become a servant by High Priest Redplume’s side.

This goat beard was likely a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

Hence, that was why Huntwind and the rest would be so respectful.

Of course, just based on High Priest Redplume’s servant, this identity, even if the goat beard did not have a Heavenly Emperor’s cultivation realm, it was also sufficient to do as he pleased in the demon race.

“So that’s how it is. Qhat did you come to find me for?” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Facing a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, Ye Yuan did not have much awe or veneration.

He saw Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s thoughts as clear as a blazing fire. Previously, when he solved ‘Ask Not’, he did not express anything but suppressed the matter instead. Sacred Ancestor High Priest was worried that giving him too high a status would hinder his growth.

Presently, Ye Yuan displayed his talent for the first time in the Southern Border, crushing until the whole territory’s Seven-star Alchemy Gods bowed their heads in submission. Sacred Ancestor High Priest felt that the time already arrived. That was why he would announce to the outside world that he was ‘Second Sage’.

This title of ‘Second Sage’ was not that he felt that Ye Yuan’s standing could already match up to this kind of status.

On the contrary, Ye Yuan’s present strength was completely inadequate to harness this title!

In terms of realm, Ye Yuan was merely True God Realm.

In terms of Alchemy Dao, Ye Yuan also merely just entered Ancestor Realm currently.

There were countless powerhouses in this world, but Ye Yuan never felt that he was invincible under the heavens.

Not mentioning others, just talking about these 11 disciples under Sacred Ancestor High Priest, each one of them was a demon race major power, with their Alchemy Dao strength being immensely formidable.

The current Ye Yuan was far from a match.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest giving him this title was to make him become the target of public scorn, to let him swiftly grow up amidst adversity.

Clearly, his every action and conduct, the other party was paying attention to it.

Humph, this kid is so condescending, to actually think nothing of Master! Does he really take himself to be Second Sage?

Seeing that Ye Yuan’s face did not have any look of awe, Gongyang Lie was very unhappy in his heart.

However, he did not show it on his face and said with a faint smile, “Westspirit Region under Master’s command is going to host a grand Demon Divine Pill Convention. He heard that Second Sage is an alchemy master and specially invited Second Sage over to give a pointer or two.”
