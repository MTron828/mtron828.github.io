Chapter 2752: Strength Soaring!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Really won … I really dare not believe it!”

“From not lasting more than 20 moves to successfully counter-attack, could it be that this guy’s potential has no end?”

“To think that we were still ridiculing him previously; what a joke!”

“Perhaps, this is a true genius!”

Saint Exalt Purplesun gave a long sigh and admitted his own superficialness.

They had ruled the Rainclear Continent for tens of thousands of years and had seen before God knew how many geniuses.

But those geniuses were simply like the firefly versus the bright moon in front of Ye Yuan; the disparity was too great!

The impact of Ye Yuan winning Sun Qi a month ago was not as strong as currently too.

Because they understood that the Jade Sovereign Heaven Sun Qi was not even worthy of carrying Qiu Chen’s shoes!

One was outstanding among Jade Sovereign Heavens.

But the other could rival Saint Sovereign Heavens!

The gap was not imaginable.

But Ye Yuan completed a virtually impossible counterattack in a short three and a half months’ time!

Qiu Chen looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold snort, “Beating me in Jade Sovereign Heaven doesn’t mean anything! The ranking in this cultivation room is the ranking of Saint Sovereign Heaven! Jade Sovereign Heaven to Saint Sovereign Heaven is a massive threshold. Do you really think that you’re remarkable?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, after I break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, I’ll come again!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan walked out of the battlefield and started regulating his breathing to recover.

However, he did not continue challenging the powerhouses in front but chose to continue fighting with Qiu Chen.

Although he won Qiu Chen, his combat power was just about on par with Qiu Chen.

Sure enough, in the following practices, the two people had wins and losses.

But, along with the passage of time, Ye Yuan’s superiority gradually became clear.

By the time Ye Yuan’s fourth form broke through to the realm of major accomplishment, Qiu Chen was no longer his match anymore.

Completely crushing Qiu Chen also made everyone sigh endlessly.

This was a rocket-like road to rise!

After taking care of Qiu Chen, Ye Yuan continued challenging the powerhouses in front.

Saint Exalt Purplesun discovered to their surprise that Ye Yuan actually crushed all the way.

Only all the way until the 64th place did Ye Yuan encounter an opponent that was evenly matched in strength.

Only then did they know that it turned out they were mistaken about Ye Yuan.

It was not that Ye Yuan skipped opponents; he really charged over all the way according to the rankings.

In a blink, three years passed.

Three years’ time was merely a transient instant to these Saint Sovereign Heavens and Jade Sovereign Heavens.

But they were demoralized from watching Ye Yuan fight until no part of their body was unhurt.

After Qiu Chen, Ye Yuan charged all the way to 47th place!

For three years, Ye Yuan did not sleep nor rest, entering a crazed cultivation state.

It was not that he did not encounter powerful opponents during this.

On the contrary, there were too many powerful opponents!

Those able to enter the Labyrinth Divine Palace would not be mediocre people even in their Jade Sovereign Heaven era.

Each of these people was peerless heaven’s chosen!

Many people were the same as Qiu Chen, thrashing Ye Yuan in the beginning.

But Ye Yuan became braver in the face of setbacks, suffering repeated defeats with each battle, finally crushing his opponent!

No matter how strong his opponent was, how miserably he was defeated, it was unable to shake his resolve to become strong.

Furthermore, he harbored the resolve of certain death to fight each battle.

During the battles with the 51st place Zhao Yuesheng, Ye Yuan fought with the opponent until both sides suffered heavy wounds more than ten times. He was seriously injured on the verge of death.

But, each time after recovering, he would throw himself into battle right away.

That battle was fought until everyone was profoundly affected and on constant tenterhooks.

But in the end, Ye Yuan finally broke through the realm of fourth form major accomplishment in the midst of battle and reached the pinnacle realm!

Great Dao Transformation fourth form, every step forward was immensely difficult.

Especially at the juncture of each minor realm, wanting to break through three Daos at the same time, the difficulty could be imagined.

But Ye Yuan attained frenzied advancement in the midst of crazed battles.

Three years later, the cultivation abruptly stopped.

It was not that Ye Yuan did not want to cultivate, but that all of the heavenly crystals had already been exhausted.

Although this kind of cultivation method was fast, maintaining the operation of the cultivation room consumed a lot of heavenly crystals too.

Cultivating this entire way, Ye Yuan had really never lacked heavenly crystals before.

Over these several hundred years, the heavenly crystals he accumulated were rather considerable.

But these heavenly crystals had long been wiped out a year ago.

During this period of more than one year, Ye Yuan practically squeezed the heavenly crystals of these powerhouses present dry. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

With this, it was completely gone.

Seeing the light of the cultivation room go out, Saint Exalt Purplesun sighed emotionally and said, “It’s finally expended entirely! If the heavenly crystals were sufficient, can he cultivate to Saint Exalt Heaven in one go?”

Skyfortune deeply felt that way too and said with a nod, “Very likely! Could it be that this guy doesn’t know fatigue? How powerful a willpower is needed to be able to not sleep or rest for three years?”

“This guy is asleep! It’s not that he wasn’t tired, but that he was using willpower to overcome it!”

While talking, Ye Yuan fell to the ground and slept.

The moment he stopped being tense, he could not hold on anymore as well.

Skyfortune shook his head and said, “Really a terrifying opponent! I feel that the Pill Alliance has probably provoked the wrong person!”

Everyone exchanged glances, all seeing the shock in the others’ eyes.

This guy was too crazy!

Cultivating three years without sleeping or resting, it was naturally nothing to a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse.

But, even if it was a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, their vigor was limited too.

Under such a high intensity situation, to cultivate for three years straight, the vast majority of people would go insane.

Few people would be able to last.

But Ye Yuan held on!

During these three years, Ye Yuan’s realm already reached peak middle Jade Sovereign heaven under the opponents’ tempering. He was only missing a little bit before he could enter upper Jade Sovereign Heaven.

Of course, the greatest improvement was still his power of rules.

His Great Dao Transformation already reached peak fourth form.

Right now, even if he did not utilize a grandmist treasure, he was close to invincible within Jade Sovereign Heaven Realm too.

Unless he ran into heaven’s chosen like the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s disciples.

Once he utilized a grandmist treasure, even if he matched up against a Saint Sovereign Heaven, he could fight too!

Ye Yuan slept for ten days and nights.

When he woke up, he discovered that everyone had already gathered here.

Big Yellow was currently guarding him.

Ye Yuan stared at Big Yellow and said with a smile, “Not bad. It seems like you improved quite a bit!”

Big Yellow smiled bashfully and said, “Compared to Master Ye, it’s still too far off!”

Ye Yuan said, “Made it to which checkpoint?”

“998th place!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Not bad! These heaven’s chosen, their strength is actually not uniform in Jade Sovereign Heaven Realm. But the Saint Sovereign Heaven ranking is the real deal. For you to be able to promote three places, it’s already rather impressive.”

Big Yellow chuckled, quite pleased with himself.

These three years, Big Yellow also cultivated like he went crazy.

In reality, there were many times when he could not persevere anymore.

But each time he could not persevere, he would come to the number one cultivation room.

Seeing Ye Yuan be even crazier than him, his drive would kick in.

During these three years, he only had one thought. It was to keep up with Ye Yuan’s footsteps to the best of his ability.

Otherwise, he would not have the qualifications to follow Ye Yuan one day.

And this day would not be too far away.

The cultivation would automatically record the strength of powerhouses and eliminate the last place.

Currently, at the number ten cultivation room, at the 998th place, there was already Big Yellow’s projection.
