Chapter 1300: Medicinal Properties of Divine Rank Spirit Medicines

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Divine pills are naturally accepted. But it will have to depend on what grade of Divine Essence Pill you refine. Our Myriad Treasure Tower guarantees quality. Divine Essence Pills lower than middle-grade, we won’t accept any.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Hong Yin was shocked inwardly but was still calm on the surface.

Furthermore, she was very puzzled. This youth seemed to be very short on money.

But, if he really knew Formation Dao Pill Refinement, how could he possibly be poor until he could not even afford to rent a Yellow Rank cultivation room?

But Ye Yuan did not mind Hong Yin’s words. He asked, “I wonder what’s your acquisition price?”

Hong Yin was not impatient and replied, “Middle-grade Divine Essence Pill, 25 pieces of low-grade divine essence stones. High-grade Divine Essence Pills, 80. Superior-grade Divine Essence Pills, 400 pieces.”

Middle-grade Divine Essence Pills’ selling price was 30 pieces of low-grade divine essence stones. High-grade was 100 pieces, superior-grade was 500 pieces.

Since the Myriad Treasure Tower purchased medicinal pills, they naturally wanted to earn the price difference.

This price was already very fair.

In reality, the one that sold the most was still low-grade Divine Essence Pills.

The majority of martial artists could only afford to consume low-grade.

Because Divine Essence Pills were running stock medicinal pills for martial artists to cultivate, middle-grade was still a little okay. High-grade would easily require hundreds of divine essence stones. Ordinary martial artists really could not afford it.

As for superior-grade Divine Essence Pills, that was really a sky-high price.

But what the Myriad Treasure Tower walked was the quality goods route. Hence, low-grade Divine Essence Pills which did not meet the mark, they did not sell at all.

Ye Yuan nodded and said to Hong Yin with clasped hands, “Thank you very much, Miss.”

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Hong Yin’s beautiful eyes swiveled around.

Although she did not think that Ye Yuan could refine Divine Essence Pills, she garnered interest in Ye Yuan.

After entering the cultivation room, Ye Yuan directly sunk his divine sense into the World Suppressing Stele according to the method that Dustless said. Suddenly, his eyes blurred, directly entering inside a milky-white space.

Ye Yuan discovered that the time flow rate here was indeed much faster than the outside world.

“Senior, get started then!” Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said with a firm gaze.

He only had 10 days, which were 100 days’ time inside the World Suppressing Stele!

A 100 days’ time to use to master Formation Dao Pill Refinement, this was an incomparably arduous challenge. He did not have any time to waste.

This was a virtually impossible task!

Dao Defying Pill said, “Compared to mortal-grade medicinal pills, the refinement threshold of divine pills is much higher! You had once refined the Dao Defying Pill before. Even though that medicinal pill was incredible, it’s also still in the scope of mortal-grade medicinal pills! Divine rank spirit medicines, even the lowest level divine rank spirit medicines, the complexity of the medicinal properties is also 10 thousand times, even 100 thousand times, a million times, of mortal-grade spirit medicines! Therefore, wanting to refine divine pills, one must first familiarize with the medicinal properties of divine rank spirit medicines! This is a drawn-out process. But you only have ten chances!”

The spirit medicines that Ye Yuan purchased were the quantity of 10 sets of Divine Essence Pills in total!

This was also to say that not only did he have to use these 10 sets of spirit medicines to familiarize himself with the medicinal properties, he even had to use them to attempt pill refinement.

Furthermore, he must even succeed in refining a middle-grade Divine Essence Pill.

This difficulty was too great.

Dustless sighed and said, “Kid, even if it’s Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, it’s also impossible to complete such a refinement. It’s really making things hard for you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, these emotional words, it’s not too late to wait until after Ye Yuan fails before talking.”

Dustless’s gaze turned intent, and he said with a nod, “I’ll be telling you about the medicinal properties of these few kinds of divine rank spirit medicines. As for how much you can comprehend, it will have to depend on yourself! First, it’s the Divine Rain Silk ...”

Dustless talked smoothly, clearly long memorized the medicinal properties of these low-level spirit medicines thoroughly already.

However, no matter how familiar Dustless was, that was Dustless’s business.

Pill refinement this sort of thing, only if the alchemist himself comprehended it could he refine it.

Talking and mastering were two completely different things.

There was a saying: ‘Knowledge from books was ultimately shallow, one must experience it firsthand to know the intrinsic quality.” This was the situation.

Pill refinement had always been a skill that was continuously refined and tempered. No matter how thoroughly the master expounded, it also required one to explore it little by little.

At most, it was just shortening this process.

Ye Yuan focused on things the way he had never done before. Every word that Dustless said, he imprinted it firmly in his mind.

He did not have many chances to go and repeatedly experience the medicinal properties of these spirit medicines. Then what Dustless said was very important.

Refining divine pills, Ye Yuan was an out-and-out novice. But in terms of pill refining experience, few people could match up to Ye Yuan.

Even if what he refined were all mortal-grade medicinal pills!

This talk was ten days and ten nights!

A hundred days, one-tenth was gone in a blink of an eye!

Even though Dustless had long warned before, Ye Yuan still did not expect that a mere five kinds of lowest-level divine rank spirit medicines were actually complicated to such a degree.

In these ten days, the quantity of information which Dustless narrated, even Ye Yuan had the impulse to shrink back at the sound of it.

Without the least bit of exaggeration, every kind of spirit medicine was an encyclopedia!

At this time, he finally knew why Dustless was so pessimistic about him.

The refining difficulty of this Divine Essence Pill, the Dao Defying Pill could not catch up to it even by whipping the horse!

What Dustless talked about was still just the medicinal properties. The true pill refining process was goodness knows how many times more complicated than this.

A hundred day’s time was indeed too forceful.

“Heh, kid, know the difficulty of refining divine pills, right? Now, are you still so confident?” Dustless could not resist teasing when he saw Ye Yuan’s expression.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly when he heard that and said, “The difficulty is indeed much greater than I imagined! But, it’s still that sentence: I already have no way out. Since that’s the case, then I’ll face the difficulties!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan slowly closed his eyes, and started digesting his gains over these ten days.

A colossal amount of information needed him to go and digest little by little.

He did not have the conditions to experiment repeatedly. He could only do his homework before-hand.

Two days later, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes.

Dustless said in surprise, “You used two day’s time and already completely digested it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Can’t say completely digest, but I more or less understand a little. The things that Senior said ultimately needs to be experienced firsthand. Otherwise, everything is just empty talk.”

Dustless’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Kid, I urge that you’d best experience it for a few more days. Your divine sea is damaged. After swallowing these spirit medicines, the medicinal properties will dissipate very quickly. The time left for you is just one-tenth, even one-hundredth of ordinary martial artists!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Of course I know this. But the verification of medicinal properties, it is still better to experience it firsthand.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan did not hesitate either, directly retrieving a portion of Divine Rain Silk and started chewing it bit by bit.

...

At this time, outside the Myriad Treasure Tower, Zhang Shun and another Liang Family’s family guard were already impatient from waiting.

“Why hasn’t that punk come out after entering the Myriad Treasure Tower?” the family guard said.

Zhang Shun mused for a moment and said, “He wouldn’t have ... entered the cultivation room, right?”

That family guard was stunned and said with a snicker, “Cultivation room? A cripple, enter a cultivation room for what? Isn’t this taking off the pants to let out a fart, an unnecessary move?”

Zhang Shun also felt that it was not too likely. But Ye Yuan staying until now, what could it be apart from entering the cultivation rooms still?

“This kid is very strange, mustn’t let down our guard! No matter what, we’d best keep a close watch. If he doesn’t come out, then we’ll wait until he comes out!” Zhang Shun said.
