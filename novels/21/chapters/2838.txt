Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Junior Apprentice Brother, you just entered the sect. Some things should originally not be said to you. But … you caused a lot of trouble for Master!” Hua Zong said with a solemn expression.

“Oh? Why do you say that?” Ye Yuan said indifferently.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s appearance, Hua Zong was even angrier at his failure to live up to expectations.

But Master repeatedly exhorted to definitely take good care of Junior Apprentice Brother. Clearly, he valued him greatly. So he could not flare up too.

“Junior Apprentice Brother just came to the sect. You’re probably not clear about many things yet. The Extreme Medicine Sect has many people, the factions standing in great numbers. Although these people’s

cultivation realms aren’t high, they more or less have some forces behind them. You want to dispatch them to the front-lines. It’s probably not realistic! But, you already put the word out just now. Wu Jiang they all will

definitely blow the matter up. At that time, we won’t be able to clean up the mess, and Master’s face will be utterly lost!” Hua Zong said in a solemn voice.

Hua Zong killed his way out from Saint Sovereign Heaven one step at a time too. That was how he was taken in as a disciple by Zuo Chen.

With regards to the petty tricks of Wu Jiang these people, his heart was clear as a bright mirror.

This kind of method to deal with Emperor Realm powerhouses, that was equivalent to seeking death.

But, to a newbie who just entered the sect, it proved effective every time.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother, I feel that the Extreme Medicine Sect is still too easy and comfortable! At present, we’re being confronted by a formidable enemy, but the Extreme Medicine Sect

hasn’t even gone to the front-lines. This isn’t appropriate! Wu Jiang they all are just the first batch. I feel that later, our Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples can be sent to the front-lines in batches. You got to know, that

place is where you can increase strength the fastest!”

Hua Zong opened his mouth wide, having a dumbfounded look on his face.

Not answering the question!

Forget about that; this kid actually still wanted to make everyone take a tour to the Absolute Heaven Barrier!

Was he crazy?

With just the likes of you, a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven?

Or did you think that you are the Extreme Medicine Sect’s sect master, and you are giving directions to the nation here?

Hua Zong smiled bitterly and said, “Junior Apprentice Brother, if this matter isn’t resolved, Master will be furious when the time comes. It isn’t a good thing to you either!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother, rest assured. I have a score in my heart!”

You have a score my *ss!

Hua Zong secretly cursed in his heart. This brat was really hopeless!

What kind of eyes did his master have to actually take fancy on this kind of fool?

“Brother will say up to here. Junior Apprentice Brother, take care of yourself!” Hua Zong’s tone also became unfriendly.

This kind of person who was rash and indiscreet, furthermore, closed his ears off to other people’s words, he really did not know what he should do.

Hua Zong settled Ye Yuan down and immediately left.

East Victory Mountain Range occupied a vast area with countless spiritual veins. Zuo Chen’s lineage also had their own dojo, Xuan Yang Peak.

The residences of Ye Yuan and Yang Qing few people were on Xuan Yang Peak.

After Ye Yuan returned to his own residence, a middle-aged man dressed in green Dao robes appeared out of thin air in the house just like that.

“Current sect master, Song Qingyang, pays respect to Martial Uncle!” This middle-aged man actually directly clasped his hands and said to Ye Yuan.

If someone was here, they would definitely be frightened until their jaws dropped.

This middle-aged man in green shirt was an Emperor Sakra Heaven overlord, a grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven mighty expert, as well as the current sect master, Song Qingyang!

He actually bowed to a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Of course, Song Qingyang’s face had some unnaturalness.

Asupreme powerhouse like him carried out the etiquette of a disciple to a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven. He also had bitterness that he could not say out!

Ancestor Cloudmount, his elderly self, really knew how to look for trouble, to actually take a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven in as a disciple!

Wasn’t this killing people?

Ye Yuan was currently in closed-seclusion and thinking. Hearing Song Qingyang’s voice, he slowly opened his eyes and said, “I’ve troubled Lord Sect Master!”

Song Qingyang hurriedly said, “Martial Uncle is killing Qingyang. You’re Ancestor Cloudmount’s personal disciple, so you’re naturally Qingyang’s senior too. Some trivial matters are what Qingyang should do.”

Song Qingyang coming over was naturally arranged by Zhou Pinespring.

Zhou Pinespring reminded him repeatedly that this junior apprentice brother was remarkable and highly favored by Ancestor Cloudmount.

Even if he was the sect master, he did not dare to be careless in front of Ye Yuan too.

Even if he knew that Ye Yuan was a divergent cultivator.

eally talking about it, Song Qingyang was Hegemon Cloudmount’s god knew how many generations of disciples already.

But he already cultivated to grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven and could barely manage to call Cloudmount grandmaster.

Therefore, when he saw Ye Yuan, he could only call martial uncle too.

n the Extreme Medicine Sect, the sect master was not the real person in charge.

Above the sect master, there were actually still two great powers.

The first was naturally Hegemon Realms!

And the second was the Extreme Light Pavilion.

Only after that did it reach sect master.

Inside the Extreme Light Pavilion were all some old monsters

Some were former sect masters, and some were the sect’s elders, etc.

However, those able to enter Emperor Sakra Heaven, the majority of their strength was grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven!

These people were in closed-seclusion all year round or wandering outside, assaulting that fleeting and ephemeral Hegemon Realm.

The Extreme Light Pavilion’s other two Hegemon Realms originated from the Extreme Light Pavilion.

And Zhou Pinespring was also a member of the Extreme Light Pavilion before promoting to Hegemon Realm.

Ye Yuan was the person that Cloudmount appointed to enter the Extreme Light Pavilion. Regardless of seniority or authority, he was above Song Qingyang.

Hence, he could only be careful.

It was just that, being like this to a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, Song Qingyang felt very uncomfortable in his heart.

“Lord Sect Master doesn’t have to be like this. Although Ye Yuan’s realm is low, I’m not an insensible person. Normally, you can just treat me as an ordinary disciple. I’ll also be respectful to Lord Sect Master. I entered

the Extreme Medicine Sect primarily to enter the Scripture Library. Hence, I’ll be entering closed-seclusion soon,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

After hearing this, Song Qingyang’s heart eased up slightly.

He was afraid that this youth’s status was high and would carelessly interfere in the sect’s affairs. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Then he, this sect master, would really be awkward.

However, Ye Yuan entered the sect just to enter the Scripture Library?

What was this playing at?

Song Qingyang hurriedly said, “Then I’ll have to make Martial Uncle feel wronged! The matter that happened outside the sect, Qingyang already knows. After arranging for Martial Uncle to enter the Extreme Light

Pavilion, I’ll make the arrangements.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks, Lord Sect Master!”

Song Qingyang nodded slightly and said, “Then … shall we enter the Extreme Light Pavilion right now?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly. Song Qingyang flicked his sleeves and disappeared with Ye Yuan.

A figure took large strides into Wu Jiang’s residence and said with a loud laugh, “Wu Jiang, I heard that you got taken care of by a Saint Sovereign Heaven? Hahaha, nice one!”

This person was Wu Jiang’s diehard follower, Zhou Qun.

Zhou Qun’s strength was not that strong, being comparable to Wu Jiang. But he was a capable person.

In the Extreme Medicine Sect, some people were very well-informed. Zhou Qun was one of them.

Hence, when Wu Jiang suffered a loss, he was the first to know.

When Wu Jiang saw Zhou Qun, he snorted coldly and said, “I was just about to go find you. You came just in time!”

Zhou Qun smiled and said, “Are you going to take this martial uncle of ours down a notch?”

Wu Jiang smiled and said, “It’s still you who understands me!”

Zhou Qun chuckled and said, “You rest assured. This is my specialty! In less than a day, this matter will definitely rage all over the city. Even those Emperor Realm powerhouses will know! At that time, I want to see how

this martial uncle of ours gets down from the stage!”.
