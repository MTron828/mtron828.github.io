Chapter 2850: Didn’t Think That You’re This Kind of Person!

Translator :Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Previously, Ye Yuan was clearly not at his residence.

With so many people surrounding here, where did Ye Yuan pop out from?

Even Zhu Yan, this Emperor Realm powerhouse, was very surprised too. He did not detect Ye Yuan’s return in the slightest.

But Wang Lin and the rest seemed to be greatly invigorated.

The perpetrator came out!

Aren’t you, Zuo Chen, amazing? Don’t you dote on this disciple?

Today, I’m going to slap your face ruthlessly in front of the entire sect!

Wang Lin looked toward Zhu Yan with a look of amusement and said, “Didn’t you say that he wasn’t around? Now, what do you still have to say?”

Zhu Yan had an awkward look. Looking toward Ye Yuan, he had a look of anger from his failure to live up to expectations.

Didn’t you know how to hide for a bit?

Running out at this time, wouldn’t it confirm ‘cowardly turtle’ this term?

Lu Daoyi looked at Ye Yuan and said with a snicker, “You’re Ye Yuan? I even thought about what kind of incredible genius you were. After messing around for a long time, it’s just a cowardly turtle!’

Ye Yuan looked at Lu Daoyi and said coolly, “Who are you?”

Lu Daoyi smiled smugly and said, “Don’t know who I am? Listen up. I’m Lu Daoyi, Extreme Medicine Sect’s grade five heavenly alchemist’s number one person! Very soon, I’ll become the number one person among grade six heavenly alchemists! I only have one goal, and that’s

Ancestor Pinespring! I’ll step into profound grade before stepping into

Emperor Realm!”

Got to say, this self-introduction was very impressive.

It was because daring to put Zhou Pinespring as a goal was a very courageous thing in the first place.

Furthermor&, Lu Daoyi had this capital.

He was just grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven and already defeated a powerhouse like Hua Zong.

When he reached grand completion True Sovereign Heaven, he might not be unable to step into profound grade.

Logically speaking, Lu Daoyi should be hated by many for being so arrogant.

But there was none at all!

“Lu Daoyi really underwent a complete change after the closed-seclusion this time! I didn’t expect that he set Ancestor Pinespring as his goal!”

“It Åounds very arrogant, but it’s really very promising! I heard that Ancestor Pinespring could already defeat the top grade six heavenly alchemists in the sect when he was at grade five realm!”

“Martial Uncle Qin Shan took in a good disciple! Although we’re grade seven realm, we might get caught up to by him if we’re careless!”

In the battle previously, Lu Daoyi exhibited a formidable alchemy path strength.

After ten years of closed-seclusion, he really underwent a complete transformation, shocking the world with one battle!

Even the Zhou Pinespring back then was likely not much stronger than Lu Daoyi.

Maybe when Lu Daoyi reached grand completion True Sovereign Heaven, he would really step into profound grade.

When Ye Yuan heard, he chuckled inwardly.

Was profound grade very hard?

He said coolly, “So incredible? Since you’re already number one, what did you come to find me for?”

Lu Daoyi said coolly, “I just exited seclusion a few days ago and heard that a peerless genius at the same rank joined the sect. I naturally have to come and defeat him! Otherwise, how can my title of number one be confirmed? But, seeing you, I’m very disappointed! You’re not worthy to be my opponent at all!”

These words were partly true and partly false. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He indeed looked down on Ye Yuan, feeling that Ye Yuan was not worhy of being his opponent.

But the other half was in order to infuriate Ye Yuan and then to slap his face mercilessly in front of everyone.

This way, it would feel amazing!

Who would have expected that Ye Yuan did not continue at all and said coolly, “Oh, since that’s the case, then what are you still waiting here for? You can go.”

The moment these words came out, everyone could not help being stupefied.

So cowardly?

Even Zhu Yan and the rest were also stunned.

Following, they felt so ashamed.

Why did their master take in such a disciple? He was too lacking in gutskö

If Lu Daoyi was True Sovereign Heaven, then forget it. But Lu Daoyi was just Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Even if he clearly knew that he was not a match, he also could not concede defeat under this kind of circumstances!

Otherwise, how would others view their master? How would people view you?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan had just entered the sect for a day. Even if he lost, it was not considered disgraceful either.

But Ye Yuan did not follow up at all!

They were disappointed, unbelievably disappointed!

Lu Daoyi looked at Ye Yuan and said with a big laugh, “In that case, you admit defeat?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I never said this.”

Lu Daoyi was stupefied again and said, “Since you’re not admitting defeat, then compete in a match!”

Ye Yuan continued to shake his head and said, “Leave. I won’t compete with you. Because there’s no meaning at all.”

Lu Daoyi could not help laughing as he said, “In that case, you’re being completely shameless?”

“Whatever you think.” Ye Yuan had waned interest and turned around and left, leaving behind the dumbfounded-looking crowd.

This Lu Daoyi could not muster up his interest at all. Ye Yuan did not even have the desire to slap Lu Daoyi’s face. Was winning Hua Zong very impressive?

Was sating Zhou Pinespring as a goal very impressive?

It was just that Ye Yuan’s behavior was simply stubbornly hanging on in the view of the others!

Clearly not a match and did not even dare to compete, but was not willing to admit defeat.

It was difficult for this kind of person to have great accomplishments!

“I even thought what kind of remarkable disciple Martial Uncle Zuo Chen took in! Looking at it now, it’s simply disgraceful!”

“Even if he loses after competing in a match, we won’t look down on him either. At least, he had the courage! But now, he’s clearly not a match and even refused to admit defeat, huhu!”

“Wll!t the hell! Martial Uncle Zuo is really blind, bringing a coward back and even protecting him like a treasure!”

Ye Yuan’s departure set up a mighty storm.

Zhu Yan and the rest wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

This was a complete and utter humiliation!

After Wu Jiang and the others were exiled, their perception of Ye Yuan immediately improved significantly. But now, it immediately returned to before emancipation.

No, it was even worse than before emancipation!

This was not losing your own face; this was losing their master’s face!

Lu Daoyi laughed loudly and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Zhu Yan, Uncle Zuo Chen was wise all his life, but I didn’t expect that he would have times where he’s blind too! This kind of trash, I, Lu Daoyi, don’t even have the desire to smack his face! Senior Apprentice Brother Wang, let’s go!”

Wang Lin smiled and said, “Indeed, this kind of person, Junior Apprentice Brother will be bringing disgrace upon yourself by taking action. Let’s go!”

As he said, Qin Shan’s lineage left straightaway.

There was already no need to compete in this match.

The effect was far better than beating Ye Yuan.

Zuo Chen’s lineage probably would not be able to lift their heads for a very long time.

Furthermore, Lu Daoyi defeating Hua Zong in this battle would surely shock the entire sect!

Their goal had already been achieved.

At Ye Yuan’s residence, Zhu Yan was very unhappy and said in a solemn voice, “Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, how can you be like this?

You got to know that who you’re representing isn’t just yourself. There’s also Master! If you admit defeat, fine then. But you didn’t concede and also did not accept the challenge. Master’s face has been utterly lost by you!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said smilingly, “Third Senior Brother, I really can’t muster interest in that Lu Daoyi. Competing with him is a complete waste of time!”

Zhu Yan was stunned and could not help laughing as he said, “In that case, you feel that you’re better than him?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head naturally and said, “That’s of course.”

Zhu Yan’s smile became a sneer and said, “Since you’re stronger than him, why didn’t you compete then?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Because he’s too weak!”

Zhu Yan could not resist laughing loudly and said, “Hahaha, even your Senior Apprentice Brother, I, don’t dare to say that Lu Daoyi is weak. You’re actually saying that he’s weak? Junior Apprentice Brother, you disappoint me too much! I really didn’t expect that you’re such a person!”

Finished saying, Zhu Yan flicked his sleeves and left!.
