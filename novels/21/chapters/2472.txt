Chapter 2478: Strongest Since Ancient Times!

“Originsmile, you go and play with him!” Tian Qing said coolly.

He had precisely the intention of probing Ye Yuan’s strength and naturally chimed in easily.

Tian Qing could tell that Ye Yuan’s power of laws was not at perfection and did not reach the realm of rule.

Although the commotion that Ye Yuan caused was huge, he did not think that Ye Yuan had the capital to pose a threat to him.

His dread toward Ye Yuan was primarily still because of Ye Yuan’s bizarre movement technique.

An unkillable opponent was clearly the most difficult to deal with.

However, it was also merely limited to being difficult to deal with.

This kind of dread was relative.

He was wary of Ye Yuan killing people. But was Ye Yuan not apprehensive of him killing people?

It was just that this scene was akin to a bolt out of the blue in the view of the others.

Ye Yuan’s current realm could at best be regarded as Deva Fifth Blight.

Deva Fifth Blight challenging the divine race’s progenitor?

You got to be kidding!

The divine race’s progenitors were all Nine-marks grand completion realm. Coupled with the divine race’s Heavenly Dao True Martial, their strengths were comparable to that of Dao Ancestors!

It was real Dao Ancestors, and not Dao Ancestors after Heavenly Dao Samsara.

Right now, Ye Yuan was actually going to challenge a Dao Ancestor level powerhouse? Wasn’t this nonsense?

Originsmile voiced his acknowledgment, took a step out, and looked at Ye Yuan as he said with a smile, “Ye Yuan, if you reached the realm of rule and became a Grand Ancestor, this progenitor would still fear you somewhat. It’s just that right now … you’d best tuck your tail between your legs and run! In a frontal confrontation, you’re not this progenitor’s match.”

Divine race progenitors, each one was a super powerhouse that shook heaven and startled the earth.

The Doomsday Battle back then, only Grand Ancestor Spacetime could faintly overpower them.

The others had to band together before they had the power to fight.

But in the end, it was also all the outcome of perishing and Dao dissipating.

They naturally had absolute confidence.

Below rules, they would not look someone in the eye at all.

Not even Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said coolly, “If bragging is useful, then still cultivate for what? Moving your lips are enough!”

Originsmile was taken aback and said, “Fine lad, then this progenitor will measure just how much capability you have!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Boom!

The moment Originsmile’s aura was released, nine sturdy Dao marks revolved around him.

His every action and movement actually carried the might of Heavenly Dao!

This was the divine race!

Swoosh!

It was only to see Originsmile’s figure flashed, already arriving in front of Ye Yuan in an instant.

A fist smashed over; the void trembled!

Boundless strength completely locked Ye Yuan down.

Even when separated by an extremely far distance, the piercing cold fist wind still howled until people’s cheeks hurt.

Without any flashy martial technique, this punch was Great Dao simplified to the utmost!

The first time a divine race progenitor showed his strength in front of the world, it shocked all sides!

“Hiss?… Is this the strength of the divine race’s progenitors? Really too terrifying!”

“I finally understand why that war ten billion years ago was called Doomsday Battle. Such horrifying power is virtually world-destroying!”

“Lord Saint Azure is still lacking a bit of skill level! If he can reach the realm of rule, he should be able to have a battle with the divine race’s progenitors, right?”

“But it’s fine. With that bizarre movement technique of Lord Saint Azure’s, the divine race’s progenitor can’t hurt him!”

… …

The great battle previously was disrupted by Ye Yuan.

Although the human powerhouses were shocked earlier, now the shock they experienced became even greater after directly watching this scene now.

Originsmile’s strength erupted completely, shocking the world!

Everyone thought that Ye Yuan would avoid the sharp edge.

This level of power, apart from Dao Ancestor, no one could block it at all.

But in the next instant, an unexpected scene occurred.

Ye Yuan gave a roar. The sound of a dragon roar rose to the sky!

This dragon roar shocked until everyone’s eardrums hurt, shocking until heaven and earth rippled!

It was only to see him stomp his feet and similarly slam a punch out.

A head-on clash!

Quicker than words could tell.

With their movement power, it was merely a matter of an instant.

Everyone did not react to it yet and these two people already clashed.

Rumble!

Terrifying energy undulations rippled out crazily.

Those who were weak were directly sent flying.

Fortunately, they were far enough away such that they would not be killed by this air billow.

Tian Qing extended his sleeves and flicked lightly, swiping this force away.

It was just that a shocked expression showed on his face.

This blow was evenly matched!

“What terrifying physical power! Grand completion Nine Transformations Golden Body is what no one could achieve since ancient times!” Tian Qing said in a solemn voice.

By the side, Tian Xing said in shock, “Nine cycles of nirvanic tribulation, nine life-and-death samsara. Ordinary people can’t even imagine the price that’s paid. The ninth transformation nirvanic tribulation is a hundred times even more terrifying than Deva Fifth Blight! Even powerhouses who have transcended the eighth transformation nirvanic tribulation don’t dare to transcend the ninth transformation nirvanic tribulation too! Really don’t know how he pulled through!”

Tian Qing nodded and said, “The world only sees his amazing talent, but overlooked his astonishing will! This is the most terrifying thing about Ye Yuan!”

Originsmile’s divine sea churned. He was also shocked by Ye Yuan’s strike.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan would be able to stand up to him as an equal just by relying on the power of the physical body.

“Is this the strength of the legendary divine race progenitors? Merely thus! Are you really not using Heavenly Dao True Martial?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Originsmile’s gaze turned slightly dark and he said, “Grand completion Nine Transformations Golden Body, the power of a primeval dragon! It turns out that your physical body has already reached the realm of a primeval dragon! Furthermore, you’re probably the strongest one out of primeval dragons! Grand completion Nine Transformations Golden Body has never happened since ancient times!”

“What?! The power of a primeval dragon! Strongest primeval dragon! Doesn’t that mean that Ye Yuan already reached the realm of Grand Ancestor in terms of physical body?” Ancestor Fire said in shock.

Lin Chaotian nodded slightly and said, “Extermination lightning tempering the body stimulated all of his potential! Ninth transformation nirvanic tribulation, even if it’s successive primeval dragons, no one dared to cross it too! Not only did Ye Yuan transcend this tribulation, he even tempered his physical body to the extreme! His strength likely isn’t inferior to you all already!”

Ancestor Water frowned and said, “I’ve also heard before that the eight great supreme demon clans all have inheritance methods for perfect ninth transformation. It’s just that successive samsara progenitors could only all transcend the eighth transformation nirvanic tribulation, and were unable to transcend the ninth transformation nirvanic tribulation! Those who attempted to cross the tribulation all died! I didn’t expect that Ye Yuan could actually complete the ninth transformation nirvanic tribulation!”

Before this, no one would care about Ye Yuan’s physical strength.

Ye Yuan’s might was firstly because of his strange movement technique. Secondly, it was because of his law fusion that set the world on fire.

But currently, when Ye Yuan punched out, the world was shocked!

His physical strength had reached an unprecedented realm!

Reaching the realm of a primeval dragon was already reaching the realm of a Grand Ancestor.

Now, Ye Yuan was even grand completion Nine Transformations Golden Body, becoming the strongest primeval dragon. His strength was already unimaginable.

Hence, that was how he was able to be evenly matched with Originsmile!

“I underestimated you! You indeed have the qualifications to fight with this progenitor! Since that’s the case, you’re worthy of me, this progenitor, showing my Heavenly Dao True Martial!”

Originsmile stomped his feet, the might of Heavenly Dao suddenly descended.

Nine Dao marks bloomed with a dazzling light.

However, nothing changed about Originsmile.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned slightly grim, his expression also became solemn.

No change was maybe even more terrifying than changes!

Although he reached the realm of a primeval dragon, each of these divine race progenitors was an old monster who had lived for countless billions of years. None of them were easy to deal with!
