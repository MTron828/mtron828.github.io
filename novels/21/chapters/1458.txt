Chapter 1462 Completely Annihilated

A group of soldiers dressed in black armor surrounded Ye Yuan and the rest.

Fiendish energy surged on these people’s bodies. They were actually all fiend race powerhouses.

“Jeje, there’s actually someone who lit a fire near Fiend Calling Ridge, really heedless of the consequences!”

“Turns out it’s a human race’s small squad. No matter how small the mosquito, it’s meat too. Annihilate them all.”

Ling Feng’s expression became dark. He did not expect to actually be able to bump into the fiend race’s squad in this area. Furthermore, it was five in one go!

The other party had five Heaven Glimpse Realm existences. Clearly, it was five fiend race squads.

But when the other human soldiers heard, they all could not resist glaring at Ye Yuan.

If not for Ye Yuan courting death and starting a fire and roasting meat, it also would not draw the fiend race squads. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Damn fellow, you’re still in the mood to eat barbecue!” A human soldier gritted his teeth in anger.

Being surrounded by the fiend race squads, Ye Yuan’s first reaction was not to be scared but to hastily eat the rabbit meat.

This action made the human squad members gnash their teeth in hatred even more.

Ling Feng said in a solemn voice, “Don’t talk nonsense anymore! The situation is not quite right. The Fiend Calling Ridge has a huge natural moat with a strange metamagnetic field existing there. Even if peak Origin Magnetic Field powerhouses descended from the natural moat area, they would fall and be smashed to pieces too! Logically speaking, the fiend race squads will not appear here. There must be some conspiracy involved! Zhao Bin, your movement technique is the fastest. In a while, we’ll break through toward the southwest direction. Everyone cover him to charge out, let him go back and report!”

“Captain, I’m not going ...”

“Shut up, this is an order! If you don’t want us to die in vain, bring this intel back!” Zhao Bin was just about to speak when Ling Feng yelled fiercely.

At this time, a fiend race’s captain sneered coldly and said, “You’re very smart. We’ve already found the way to overcome the metamagnetic field. The battalion will charge over from this side very soon. At that time, Tiderain City is ours! As for you all ... all of you can forget about leaving!”

Ling Feng’s expression flickered incessantly. This intel was a bolt out of the blue to Tiderain City.

Fiend Calling Ridge this region did not only have large numbers of Three-star fierce beasts existing, but the back of the mountain also had a 100 thousand miles long natural moat.

Inside this natural moat existed a natural metamagnetic field. Unless one reached the Divine Lord Realm, otherwise, there was completely no way to cross. It was Tiderain City’s natural protective defense.

Hence, each time they patrolled, this side was all routine business. Everyone came over to walk one round and then went back.

But now, the fiend race actually found a way to avoid those fierce beasts. This was not some good news for the human race.

A hint of decisiveness flashed across in Ling Feng’s eyes and he said in a cold voice, “What needs to be done, don’t need me to teach you guys, right?”

“Understood!” A glimmer of solemness and melancholy flashed across the others’ faces as they responded.

After that, Ling Feng’s gaze looked towards the Ye Yuan who was currently gnawing on rabbit meat again, his expression slightly complicated as he said, “Kid, in a while, good luck to you! Whether or not you can survive will depend on your fortunes.”

At this time, Ye Yuan finally finished gnawing on the rabbit meat in his hands and belched satisfactorily, smiling and saying, “Relax, I can take good care of myself.”

“Jeje, there’s actually still an idiot on the human’s side.”

“Huhu, this kid probably still hasn’t figured out the situation, right?”

“Mu Feng, leave that kid to you, finish the fight fast!”

“Relax, dealing with this kind of rookie, three moves is enough!”

The fiend race’s group clearly discerned that Ye Yuan was not the same party as those human soldiers.

Their vision was the same as Ling Feng, feeling that Ye Yuan was some large family clan’s disciple with one glance. Although his realm was high, he could not take a single hit at all.

Mu Feng slowly stepped out of the ranks, looking at Ye Yuan with an amused look as he said with a cold smile, “Kid, your flesh and blood is pretty good. Just nice, it can give your Grandpa Mu Feng to cultivate. Rest assured, Grandpa Mu Feng’s blow is very light and won’t let you feel pain.”

The flesh and blood of human powerhouses was a great tonic to the fiend race.

Many fiend race cultivation methods borrowed the power of flesh and blood to cultivate.

Precisely because so that fiend race powerhouses liked to carry out slaughter against human powerhouses.

“Careful, concealed weapon!” Ye Yuan smiled strangely, the remaining bone in his hand flying out directly.

Whoosh!

Mu Feng, who was currently being pleased with himself, did not expect Ye Yuan to attack when he said so.

He instinctively wanted to avoid it, but that bone’s speed was too fast. He actually could not avoid it in time!

Slap!

That bone struck Mu Feng’s face without deviation.

A greasy feeling immediately made Mu Feng burn with rage.

“Hahaha!”

This scene immediately incurred a bout of loud laughter.

A bone naturally would not cause any damage to Mu Feng. But in front of so many people, where would he put his face?!

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Sigh, already asked you to be careful, why were you still so careless?”

Mu Feng’s teeth chattered from gnashing, clearly already infuriated to the extreme.

“Good! Very good! Kid, Grandpa Mu Feng will let you know what’s called a life worse than death!” Mu Feng said in a cold voice.

“Stop playing, attack together, eradicate them!” said another captain in a cold voice.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Five fiend race squads, several dozen people rushed over at the same time, the impetus was quite astonishing.

Ling Feng’s expression changed, the smile from before immediately disappeared without a trace as he bellowed, “Kill!”

This team of around ten people protected that soldier called Zhao Bin in the middle, desperately breaking through to the outside.

But how could those fiend race soldiers give them the chance?

The remaining four fiend race captains burst forth, all charging towards Ling Feng.

The fiend race warriors were powerhouses to begin with. Ling Feng fighting four-on-one immediately felt a pressure that could topple mountains and overturn the seas.

Ling Feng already mustered up divine essence, prepared to meet the enemy.

But right at this time, those four fiend race captains suddenly directly exploded before his eyes, even the fiendish essence did not escape.

Ling Feng was utterly dumbstruck with amazement. What happened?

Suddenly, Ling Feng’s entire body trembled, looking over in Ye Yuan’s direction, discovering that the Mu Feng opposite him was already nowhere to be found too, without even leaving behind dregs.

Could it ... Could it be done by him?

Impossible!

How could an initial-stage Heaven Glimpse possible one-shot five fiend race captains?

Forget about Ye Yuan, even their centurion could not possibly do this either!

However, apart from these five people, there were still quite a number of fiend race soldiers. Ling Feng just was just slightly absent-minded for a moment, then joined the camp of slaughtering those fiends.

“You fiend dogs, to dare profane my human race, die!”

At this time, Ye Yuan shouted loudly and joined the group battle too.

This time, Ling Feng saw Ye Yuan attack, immediately feeling his eyes light up.

You don’t say, his strength was really not weak.

But, to say insta-killing four great fiend race captains in one move, that was clearly impossible.

Two might Heaven Glimpse powerhouses facing a bunch of Grotto Profound Realm fiends, that was naturally a massacre.

Ye Yuan’s movement technique was exceedingly fast. Those fiends who wanted to escape were directly slaughtered clean by him.

This battle’s reversal was too sudden. Everyone originally harbored the resolve of certain death. In the end, the other party was completely annihilated in a blink of an eye ...
