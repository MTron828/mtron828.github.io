Chapter 2867 100,000 Strong Army!

“Little … M-Master, how did you do it? This kind of restoration means is unheard of!” Shock was written all over Feng Xiaotian’s face. Even his term of address changed.

He had already been at South Qi Giant City for 3000 years.

This city protecting grand array had been damaged and repaired, repaired and damaged, god knows how many times already.

The grade nine heavenly formation masters that came to maintain the grand array died and were replaced, and then replaced and died again.

But Feng Xiaotian had never seen before such a breathtaking restoration method.

Liu Yi and the rest had already completely shut up.

He only felt a chill run down his spine: F*ck me, what have I done?

I nearly throttled a major savior!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “City Lord Your Excellency doesn’t have to be like this. This is just a small trick. Putting it bluntly, it’s actually nothing.” Everyone wished to smack Ye Yuan to death with one slap. You even freaking scared grade nine heavenly formation masters until they pissed their pants. Could you not posture? What kind of existence was Feng Xiaotian? He immediately discerned Ye Yuan’s underlying meaning, his entire body trembling as he said, “You mean that this sort of heaven-defying means can be disseminated?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Of course. Otherwise, why did I make them all stop?”

Feng Xiaotian sucked in a breath of cold air, immediately feeling wild elation! Over 1000 people using this kind of means to restore the grand array at the same time, what kind of terrifying efficiency was that? Even thinking about it felt a little exciting! Feng Xiaotian gave Ye Yuan a deep bow and said, “Master, please impart this technique! If we stop the blood race, you’ll be South Qi Giant City’s number one meritorious official!”

Ye Yuan hurriedly helped Feng Xiaotian up and said, “City Lord Your Excellency mustn’t be like this. The brothers are resisting the blood race here with almost certainty of death. Why would this Ye cherish my own belonging that’s of little value? This technique is called Lesser Origin Restoration Art. It’s specifically used for repairing large-scale array formations!”

“Hang on! You’re saying this is the Lesser Origin Restoration Art?” Beside Feng Xiaotian, grade nine heavenly formation master, Weng Fan, had shock written all over his face.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Precisely so!”

Weng Fan similarly drew a breath of cold air and said, “Legends have it that the Greater and Lesser Origin Restoration Arts were created by the number one Formation Dao Hegemon back then, Hegemon Luo Tian! It’s ever-successful in repairing array formations! But this technique has long already been lost for many years. Little brother, you actually let it see the light of day again?”

Actually, the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s demise back then was a tremendous loss to the entire 33 Heavens.

The Labyrinth Divine Palace’s road to rise accompanied slaughter and accompanied plundering

Back then, countless precious books, treasures, all had been collected by the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

But, in the wake of the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s demise, many precious treasures were all buried in the dust of history.

This Lesser Origin Restoration Art was one of them.

Mi Tian said that the truly formidable one was the Greater Origin Restoration Art.

However, the Greater Origin Restoration Art should be hidden in the real Labyrinth Divine Palace. Ye Yuan only obtained the Lesser Origin Restoration Art.

But the Lesser Origin Restoration Art was also a great tool to repair large-scale array formations!

This secret art normally did not have much use, but it was definitely incomparably sharp.

The so-called Lesser Origin Restoration Art was actually a kind of algorithm.

No matter how complicated the array formation was, there would always be rules to laying down formations. And the Lesser Origin Restoration Art was the technique that made use of damaged array formations to calculate the rule of laying down the formation.

As long as one found the rule to set up the formation, and then proceeded to repair the array element nodes inside, the array formation would be restored naturally.

Of course, talking about it was simple, but without exceedingly formidable means in Formation Dao, one absolutely could not find the rules involved.

Only by comprehending the source and standing at an extremely high level to analyze countless array formations could one find a suitable restoration art that could be used universally! Therefore, while it was simple, to really do it was as difficult as ascending to heaven! Just like one plus one equals two, this was the mathematical problem that everyone knew.

But to understand why one plus one equals two would be an extremely terrifying idea.

Even if it was a top mathematician, it was hard to solve it through immeasurable effort too.

Since time immemorial, there was only Hegemon Luo Tian alone who reached this level of attainment!

Therefore, after the Labyrinth Divine Palace fell, this set of techniques had also been lost.

Presently, this set of lost techniques saw the light of day anew, stunning all the formation path masters. That was also something within reason.

Hence, Ye Yuan began imparting the Lesser Origin Restoration Art.

This thing was like a formula. As long as you learned it, you could just nest it in.

Of course, there were difficult areas too.

Just as how to apply the formula nimbly was also a knowledge.

One had to know, heavenly formations were not mathematically formulas, its complexity even surpassed the level of astronomy.

Even if Heavenly Stratum powerhouses were all immensely formidable, it also could not be learned in a short while.

This process roughly needed three days.

However, a beard lathered was half shaved. These three days’ time would naturally be worth it.

At this time, there was already no one who felt that Ye Yuan was talking big to impress people anymore.

Those who cursed Ye Yuan before were all extremely embarrassed.

Especially Liu Yi, he was immensely regretful in his heart. Coming before Ye Yuan, he slapped his own mouth ruthlessly.

He nearly caused a great disaster!

If not for City Lord Feng having a sharp eye for discovering able people, then he would really have handed the chance of victory this time over to the blood race with both hands.

Then he would really be the sinner of the entire Heaven One Continent!

The news of the restoration of the grand array being at a standstill was sent back to the blood race like the wind.

Great Emperor Bloodpromise even personally went to the Absolute Heaven Barrier and looked at South Qi Giant City from afar.

Sure enough, everything stopped.

One day, two days, three days!

The entire South Qi Giant City did not have any activities.

However, he also saw that countless powerhouses flooded into South Qi Giant City. Clearly, the rear had reinforced a lot of forces.

South Qi Giant City was already prepared to put up a desperate fight!

But, without the city protecting grand array’s protection, when had their blood race been afraid of anyone before?

But when it reached the fourth day, the restoration of the grand array started again!

Hearing this news, Bloodpromise burst out laughing Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Could it be that this Feng Xiaotian went mad? Five days’ time, used up three days for no reason, now, there are only two days left, and he ran back to repair the grand array? What can two days be enough to do?”

Bloodpromise naturally knew this city protecting grand array like the back of his hand too.

Forget about two days. Even if it was 20 days, it was insufficient to repair it too!

Therefore, he was ridiculing Feng Xiaotian madly.

This troublesome opponent finally panicked!

As for the progress of the restoration, they were unable to judge it.

On the one hand, they could only observe from a distance.

On the other hand, if the grand array did not erupt with power, they could not feel it too. This was unless they came near the city. Only then could they feel the grand array distinctly.

Five days later, the blood race army was finished gathering! This time, they gathered a 100 thousand strong army!

This number was already the limit that the Absolute Heaven Barrier could withstand.

Any more and the Absolute Heaven Barrier would rebound, crushing all of these ants!

Of course, outside of the Absolute Heaven Barrier, those Hegemon Realms were all being tied down.

Otherwise, if they took the initiative to attack, a 100 thousand strong army was not even enough to look at.

Bloodpromise stood in front of the army with an imposing appearance!

“Children! Today, it’s finally the day where we’ll breach the Absolute Heaven Barrier! As long as we take down South Qi Giant City, we’ll be the blood race’s heroes! At that time, all the glory will fall on us! This seat will break through to Hegemon Realm, and you all will also soar to the heavens in one bound! Success or failure hinges on this one action!” Bloodpromise was filled with lofty sentiments as he said.

“Great Emperor is mighty!”

“The blood race will definitely win!”

… …

The tsunami-like voices echoed around the periphery of the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

“Now, you all follow this seat and trample South Qi Giant City flat!”

“Trample South Qi flat!” “Trample South Qi flat!” “Trample South Qi flat!”

The blood race’s momentum rose to the pinnacle.

They all already knew that Feng Xiaotian had already given up on the city protecting grand array!

The Heaven One Alliance without the city protecting grand array was too weak! The 100 thousand strong army charged into the Absolute Heaven Barrier in mighty contingents!
