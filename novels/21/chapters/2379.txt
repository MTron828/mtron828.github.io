Chapter 2385: Beneath One Person and Above Millions!

“What’s wrong with you?” Jian Rufeng saw that Ye Yuan’s expression was not right, and he asked rather surprisedly.

This boy did not feel uncomfortable at all when he saw him.

He invited him to be a chief instructor, and he was being overwhelmed by an unexpected favor until like this?

How could he know how great the shock in Ye Yuan’s heart was at this time?

Was this spacetime disorder, or a repeat of history?

Did he exist in history, or was this another spacetime?

Or was this simply a dream?

Everything, every single thing, they were unknown.

Perhaps God knew, but it was impossible for Him to tell Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan forcefully suppressed the horror in his heart, sucked in a deep breath, and said, “Okay, I promise you!”

Hearing that Ye Yuan was so straightforward, Jian Rufeng smiled.

The peerless genius plan had always been in the middle of advancing. It was just that, how much result this plan could achieve, even he had no idea in his heart.

The human race’s foundation was too poor!

Under such a foundation, how long did it need before they could achieve great development and reach the extent of contending with the divine race?

Jian Rufeng’s accomplishments in the path of divination were indeed unmatched.

But he was just a variant among humans.

It was easy to pass on the flame, but hard to produce something out of nothing!

Want to create a powerful cultivation method out of thin air, create a formidable martial technique, let their clansman comprehend laws, that was something as difficult as ascending to heaven.

But Ye Yuan’s appearance was like a beacon in the dark night.

Jian Rufeng’s last trace of doubt was also dispelled!

Everything was ready except for a crucial element!

Ye Yuan was that crucial element!

“Hahaha ... Okay! With you around, this ancestor can rest assured!” Jian Rufeng said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath and bowed almost to the ground towards Jian Rufeng, and said solemnly, “Senior Profound Secrets is righteous, exhausting your mind and body for the human race, till your heart ceases to beat! Please accept a bow from Junior!”

Jian Rufeng’s expression changed wildly and he said in surprise, “What did you guess again?”

Ye Yuan said solemnly, “Hundreds of millions of geniuses gathering together, there might be nothing at first. But after their talents are fully developed, how can that kind of astonishing aura hide from Celestial Master Miluo’s eyes and ears? And to conceal the heaven’s secrets operation of hundreds of millions of geniuses, even Senior can’t easily accomplish it too, right?”

Jian Rufeng looked at Ye Yuan woodenly and only came back to his senses after a while, saying, “Being able to encounter Little Brother is truly the great blessing of myriad races! I still don’t know what Little Brother is called.”

“Ye Yuan! But Senior, I only hope for you alone to know this name. In front of others, Senior can address me as Ji Qingyun!”

At the behest of supernatural powers, Ye Yuan made this request.

Jian Rufeng was uncertain what it meant, but this request was naturally nothing, he agreed to it readily.

There was clearly no footprint of his in the real history.

Ye Yuan even felt that he never took part in the Doomsday Battle at all.

Otherwise, with his talent, why would he be unknown to the public?

Furthermore, how this matter would be, still got to go and do before he would know.

Therefore, Ye Yuan did not plan on using his real name.

But Ye Yuan this name, Ye Yuan still told Jian Rufeng. This was respect toward him!

Just like this, Ye Yuan left with Jian Rufeng.

And the ones who left together with him were also Qin Chao and Mo Xiaocao.

They became members of the peerless genius plan, joining Deicide!

... ...

In Deicide’s underground palace, a group of higher-ups was all gathered here.

There was a group of Deva Realm powerhouses. Some were staring at Ye Yuan in surprise.

Lord Profound Secrets left for a thousand years, it was to wait for this kid?

What capability did this kid have, to actually be able to make His Excellency put aside Deicide’s affairs, and wait for a thousand years?

“This Jian left for a thousand years. During this period of time, everyone has worked hard!” Jian Rufeng’s gaze swept over as he said.

The moment everyone heard, they repeatedly said dare not.

In Deicide, Jian Rufeng was the absolute authority.

He created Deicide single handedly, recruiting the top major powers and aspiring people of all races under his command.

Deicide being able to develop to today’s scale, it was virtually all due to Jian Rufeng’s work alone.

If not for him shielding heaven’s secrets, how could what they do possibly hide from Celestial Master Miluo’s eyes and ears?

“Gentlemen, from today onward, Deicide is establishing the post of chief instructor! This position, the status is second only to this emperor, controlling all parties! He can mobilize all of Deicide’s resources and command everyone in Deicide! When necessary, it includes this emperor!”

Jian Rufeng’s expression was piercing, his gaze sweeping over everyone as he said those words slowly.

The moment these words came out, everyone’s breathing became ragged.

They did not know why the moment Lord Profound Secrets returned, he would suddenly set up such a position.

But they naturally hoped very much that this position would fall on them.

As for Ye Yuan, they never thought about it.

After all, Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was too low. He was still a junior.

Jian Rufeng thinking highly of him was just thinking highly of his future, that was all.

Chief instructor this position could be said to be beneath one person and above millions. It would not be handed to such a brat no matter what.

A Deicide’s higher-up said, “Lord Profound Secrets, Lord Witchcloud toiled hard and rendered great merits. He deserves this position! We’ll definitely support your decision!”

Someone concurred and said, “That’s right, this position, apart from Lord Witchcloud, there’s no one more suitable.”

Although everyone hoped to be this chief instructor, they were all clear that no one was more suitable for this position than Witchcloud.

Witchcloud did not speak. He just looked at Jian Rufeng with piercing eyes.

He knew that this position was definitely his.

Jian Rufeng waved his hand and said, “All of our Deicide’s aims are for the sake of the rise of the myriad races! We don’t need things like being promoted in order of seniority! If the myriad races don’t become powerful, so what even if this emperor gives this position to him? We’re still just a bunch of pigs and sheep being reared, without any dignity! The chief instructor that I’m talking about isn’t Witchcloud, but ...”

As he said, he turned his gaze towards Ye Yuan and slowly said, “Him!”

Buzz!

The entire main hall exploded at once!

“What?! Letting a brat who’s still wet behind his ears to be the chief instructor, keeping all parties in check? What ... kind of joke is this?”

“This brat is just a Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor! What capability does he have to take on chief instructor this position?”

“Lord Profound Secrets, are you joking with us?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

... ...

This result was seriously beyond their expectations.

Making a Heavenly Emperor Realm junior be the chief instructor, what qualifications did he have?

This position, even if they took turns one by one, it would also not be Ye Yuan’s turn!

Which of them did not do their best in a conscientious manner for Deicide, going through fire and water?

But now, a brat who popped out from God knows where, he rode on top of their heads all of a sudden. How could they be convinced?

Even Witchcloud also looked toward Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets in shock, as if it was his first time knowing him.

At this moment, a sour feeling surfaced in his heart, unable to dispel.

Between him and Profound Secrets could be said to be a life-and-death friendship.

But today, he had a feeling of being abandoned.
