Chapter 1971: All Didn’t Eat Rice?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Envy, jealousy, hatred.

These were those children of destiny’s current emotions.

People were casually picking up treasures there, but they had to deal with the endless battle spirits here.

This kind of mood was really what the f*ck.

But they could not help it!

With Ye Yuan obtaining the Qinghong Battle Armor, it was even more likely that he could enter a place where no one could put up resistance against these battle spirits.

Even those First Firmament True God existences could not get close to his body at all too.

The Ancient God Battlefield indeed had treasures everywhere. Ye Yuan really picked up quite a number of precious materials, mystic treasures, cultivation methods, secret manuals and etc along the way.

However, this area was just the outer-region of the ancient god battlefield. The majority of treasures were mostly celestial deity mystic treasures and true god mystic treasures.

The Qinghong Battle Armor that Ye Yuan obtained was absolutely an extremely rare item.

It was also precisely because of this that everyone was extremely envious of him.

These children of destiny were highborn. They normally did not lack true god mystic treasures on them.

But empyrean spirit treasures, even the lousiest empyrean spirit treasure, a single one was also not what they could be entitled to.

Empyrean spirit treasures being placed in the outside world, each item was sufficient to cause a stir.

Suddenly, the scene before Ye Yuan’s eyes changed. There were actually no more battle spirits following around him.

Those battle spirits seemed to fear something, all retreating away.

“Damn it, finally came out!”

“So many battle spirits! Just how many powerhouses died in that war back then!”

“Who the hell knows! Looking at this appearance, probably just the True God Realm powerhouses are in the tens of thousands!”

...

One small team after another killed their way out of the heavy encirclement of the battle spirit army, finally letting out a sigh of relief.

Even if it was forming teams to do battle, there were also quite a few children of destiny who died inside the battle spirit army.

Even on Extreme Luck’s side, they also lost two children of destiny.

Now, counting in Ye Yuan, Extreme Luck only had seven people left.

Song Yu arrived behind Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, hand over the empyrean spirit treasure!”

To them, empyrean spirit treasures were absolutely considered a major lucky chance.

As long as Song Yu obtained this empyrean spirit treasure, he felt that he might have a chance of breaking through to empyrean spirit treasure.

However, Ye Yuan ignored him.

Ye Yuan was currently straining his eyes and looking into the distance, brows tightly locked.

In front was a stretch of dusky fog. With his visual prowess, he could merely see a thousand feet away too.

Seeing that Ye Yuan had no reaction, Song Yu’s brows furrowed. He then said in a cold voice, “I’m talking to you right now, didn’t you hear?”

Right at this time, there were several more figures that slowly walked over, surrounding Ye Yuan in the center.

These were all Third Firmament True God powerhouses!

“Heh, emperor surmounting aura is also not a big deal. Hand over the empyrean spirit treasure,” said a handsome young man with well-chiseled features to Ye Yuan.

“Entering the Ancient God Battlefield, destiny is useless; strength is number one,” another effeminate middle-aged man said.

Although Ye Yuan performed extremely eye-catching inside the battle spirit army, in the eyes of these Third Firmament True Gods, it was nothing at all.

With their strength, even by themselves, they could barge through this battle spirit army too.

The might of a Third Firmament True God was far from what Second Firmament True Gods could compare to.

Ye Yuan turned around slightly, sweeping a glance over everyone’s faces, and said with a faint smile, “Want the empyrean spirit treasure? Come and take it yourself!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Heh, think that you’re of the emperor surmounting aura, you can be condescending? This place doesn’t have just you, one emperor surmounting aura! I, Zuo Mo, am one too!” said that handsome youth disdainfully.

“Just an emperor surmounting aura! I, Feng Xiaotian, am also one. Therefore, are you planning on making us take action?” said the effeminate man.

Counting in Song Yu, there were four people surrounding Ye Yuan at present. They were all Third Firmament True Gods.

No matter how one looked at it, Ye Yuan did not have chances of victory either.

The rest were all quaking, clearly not expecting that these two people were both people with emperor surmounting auras.

Possessing an emperor surmounting aura and their own strength was even this strong, this was the capital to be arrogant.

Meanwhile, in their minds, Ye Yuan was somewhat overestimating his own ability.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Really so much nonsense. If you’re not making a move, I’ll be taking action!”

His voice had yet to fade when the color of the sky suddenly turned dim.

A powerful stellar power suddenly appeared around Ye Yuan.

Stellar War Banner!

When the three people saw the situation, their faces could not help changing drastically.

“Empyrean spirit treasure! It’s another empyrean spirit treasure!” Zuo Mo cried out in surprise.

“This kid actually has two empyrean spirit treasures!” Feng Xiaotian similarly cried out in surprise.

However, it was already too late for them to cry out in surprise.

Ye Yuan, who had already reached Origin Pill Realm, when he used the Stellar War Banner again, the power already could not be mentioned in the same breath.

It was only to see him point the war banner, directly smashing over toward Song Yu.

That horrifying stellar power made Song Yu’s countenance change visibly.

He did not dare to be the slightest bit negligent, immediately mustering up all of his divine essence to stop the Stellar War Banner’s power with world power.

Zuo Mo and the rest were also swift when the opportunity arose, giving a loud roar, “Attack together!”

The other three people unleashed attacks toward Ye Yuan without thinking.

Three terrifying energy undulations charged straight over toward Ye Yuan.

This was a method of relieving the besieged by besieging the besiegers, wanting to force Ye Yuan to pull back and save himself.

It was not that they wanted to save Song Yu, but the strength which Ye Yuan exhibited made them rather terrified.

Losing a companion, their combat power would naturally be greatly discounted.

However ... Ye Yuan did not have the intention of defending at all!

It was only to see rays of verdant rainbow emit off Ye Yuan’s body, directly protecting him inside it.

Bang!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Under the Stellar War Banner, Song Yu was akin to being struck by a sledgehammer, directly flying out backward.

Meanwhile, the other three attacks landed right on Ye Yuan’s body.

The verdant light could not hold on very soon and dissipated.

Ye Yuan’s figure was shaking until he retreated more than ten steps in a row before barely managing to stabilize himself.

“How is this possible!”

“Is it real or fake?”

“He ... He’s actually completely fine?”

...

The three people looked at Ye Yuan, shocked until it could not be any greater.

The joint attack of three great Third Firmament True God powerhouses, Ye Yuan actually forcefully withstood it. There was not even a hint of injury on his body.

Even if he had an empyrean spirit treasure, this defensive power was also too perverse, right?

One had to know, empyrean spirit treasures were not a panacea.

If the offensive power was strong enough, one would also be shocked to death.

Under the teamwork of three Third Firmament True Gods, even if a Second Firmament True God used an empyrean spirit treasure, they should also have been shocked to death alive.

But Ye Yuan was actually completely unscathed.

Although Third Firmament True Gods were strong, Ye Yuan’s perfect sixth transformation golden body’s defensive power was perversely strong to begin with.

Now, adding on the Qinghong Battle Armor, for Third Firmament True Gods to want to hurt him, it was really very difficult.

Unless they could keep on dragging it out, and then deplete Ye Yuan’s divine essence.

Otherwise, there was no chance at all.

More importantly, Ye Yuan would not give them the chance at all.

Because Ye Yuan still had another empyrean spirit treasure in his hand. He had the Stellar War Banner!

Song Yu struggled to crawl up, already sustaining considerable internal injuries.

He looked at Ye Yuan with an apprehensive look.

Two empyrean spirit treasures, this was a set-up that made him jealous until it drove him crazy!

Ye Yuan patted the dust on his body and said with a cold smile, “What? All didn’t eat rice? Just this bit of strength and you also want to obtain an empyrean spirit treasure?”

The four people’s faces turned grim, practically dripping water.
