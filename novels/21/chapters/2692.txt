Chapter 2698: The Power of a Grandmist Treasure!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A grandmist treasure, that was the treasure that even Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses dreamed of!

But now, it appeared in the hands of a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, how could he not be shocked?

But very soon, his gaze changed from shock to greed!

A man’s wealth was his own ruin by causing others’ greed!

In Greenrock’s eyes, a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum holding a grandmist treasure, that was delivering a treasure to him,

“Hahaha,?great! Really excellent! Boy, this commander really wants to thank you, to actually deliver to me such a treasure!” Greenrock said with a loud laugh.

This fleeting and ephemeral aura, even the Su Yi on top of city walls felt it too.

This kind of aura could only be given off by grandmist treasures. Even if he had never seen one before, he guessed it too.

Seeing his, his expression changed and he said, “Third Hall Master is too rash! Taking such a treasure out, how can that green-furred commander let him off?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you have the ability, what’s the harm in taking it?”

Greenrock smiled coldly and said, “Boy, you’re also underestimating Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses too much! Today, I’ll let you experience what’s called a Jade Sovereign Heaven!”

“Roar!”

Greenrock suddenly raised his head to the sky and roared, his entire person turning into a four-legged green-furred beast! It was precisely the Greenrock Beast!

Boom!

It was only to see Greenrock roar. The ground directly collapsed.

Ye Yuan only felt his body suddenly plummet, as if imprisoned by something.

A terrifying gravity made him virtually unable to breathe.

“Hahaha,?how is it, boy? This is a thousand-fold gravitational field! Powerhouses who are similarly Jade Sovereign Heaven can forget about escaping from my gravity cage too! Now, I want to see what use your treasure has! Meteor Rain! Arise!”

Amidst the loud laughter, the dust on the ground kicked up, condensing into rocks in the air.

These rocks had all been transformed by the rule of earth and were tough to the extreme.

In the next instant, it was an earth-shattering blow!

“Hahaha,?that boy thinks that Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses only have this bit of strength? Thousand-fold gravitational field, even if same rank martial artists see Commander, they will avoid like the plague too!”

“This boy can’t even move. How will he still use the treasure? What a moron!”

“Commander has struck rich this time. That’s a legendary grandmist treasure!”

… …

When the beasts saw Ye Yuan get caught in the gravity field, they already sentenced him to death. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After all, no matter how strong the treasure was, if one could not use it, it was useless too.

Even if you could use it, in this thousand-fold gravitational field, every movement and action was slow to the extreme.

By the time your move was released, you would long be deader than dead.

“Boy, your grandmist treasure, this commander will accept it! Meteor Rain, fall!”

Greenrock made a hand gesture of pressing down, The huge boulders that covered the sky directly smashed down.

That commotion felt just like the sky had fallen down.

Regardless of whether or not it was the true spirit army or Calm South City’s powerhouses, each and every one of their faces changed abruptly when they saw it.

For Greenrock to be able to become the commander, his strength was indeed extraordinary.

He was considered an extremely strong existence among Jade Sovereign Heavens too!

It was likely that he had few rivals in the same rank!

When Su Yi saw this scene, he could not help sighing lightly.

However, just as those huge boulders were about to fall to the ground, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

Boom!

Amidst the huge boulders, the phantom of an enormous dragon tore through the air, shattering the falling rocks to smithereens.

And that giant dragon did not stop in the slightest, directly rushing out of the gravity field and flying straight for Greenrock.

“Roar!”

The sound of a dragon roar cut across the firmament. This giant dragon phantom even carried an astonishing sword intent!

This was a huge dragon condensed out of sword energy!

Boom!

Greenrock was caught off-guard and was hit directly, being blasted flying out.

His defense was extremely strong. But currently, his body was full of sword scars, akin to being sliced thousands of times.

The power of this sword was too terrifying. It definitely reached the level of Jade Sovereign Heaven!

The thousand-fold gravity field collapsed on its own without being attacked.

Greenrock looked at Ye Yuan with a look of horror, full of disbelief.

Not only did a Limitless Sublime Heaven break his thousand-fold gravity field, he even breached his defenses. How was this possible?

Ye Yuan slowly walked out of the fallen rocks and looked at him as he said coolly, “I said before, your knowledge is too shallow! Grandmist treasures are conceived in chaos, carrying the spirit of heaven and earth with boundless power. It’s not what heavenly spirit treasures can compare to at all! Moreover, this grandmist treasure is almost tailor-made for me.”

One had to know, Ye Yuan could rely on the Emerald Sea Divine Conch to kill a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse like the Black Flood Dragon King in the sea.

On land, although unable to borrow the power of the sea, dealing with a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven was still nothing difficult.

Moreover, this Dragon Spring Sword could combine his sword energy and dragon qi together, being ever-changing and having infinite power!

This move earlier, Ye Yuan used sword energy and dragon qi at the same time, condensing dragon qi with sword energy, unleashing a formidable sword.

That illusion was a dragon, but it was also sword energy!

Defeating Greenrock was naturally within reason too.

The true spirit army that was still shouting just now, was dead silent at this time.

Their commander was actually defeated!

Even the thousand-fold gravity field actually could not trap this Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Was this guy a freak?

Greenrock had a shocked expression on his face. He was frightened by Ye Yuan’s words.

Indeed, he knew that grandmist treasure was a treasure superior to heavenly spirit treasures. But, he had never seen before how strong grandmist treasures were.

A treasure like a grandmist treasure was virtually extinct on the entire Rainclear Continent.

Even those few Saint Sovereign Heavens in the Myriad Demons Mountain did not have grandmist treasures too!

The power of that sword just now, he finally witnessed it!

Of course, Ye Yuan actually released two powers of completely different natures from his body and even fused them into one.

This kind of thing was simply fantastical!

“Who the hell are you?” Greenrock said with a solemn expression.

“Right now, it’s me asking you. You just have to answer! Where did you all come from?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Greenrock’s expression flickered indeterminately, but he still answered, “This commander came from the Myriad Demons Mountain and is under the command of Myriad Elephant King! Boy, if you know what’s good for you, stop meddling in other people’s business. Otherwise, you won’t be able to bear the consequences of failure!”

Ye Yuan was shocked inwardly, this bunch of guys actually came from the Myriad Demons Mountain!

If that was the case, then it would really be troublesome!

There were seriously too many great demons in the Myriad Demons Mountain!

It was rumored that there were even a number of Saint Sovereign Heaven level overlords!

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan waved the Dragon Spring Sword, a ray of sword light was released, smashing Greenrock flying again.

“I said it before. I ask, and then you answer! So don’t talk nonsense! Keep being long-winded and I can’t be bothered to ask you anymore either. I think that with so many true spirits, there will always be those who are willing to answer!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Greenrock’s expression changed, gritting his teeth and nodding.

He could tell that Ye Yuan was not joking.

“You came from Myriad Demons Mountain. Why would you attack Calm South City? Could it be that the northern cities have all fallen?” Ye Yuan asked the thing that he was most concerned about.

The great demons went all the way south and even fought to the sea already. Then the northern cities were probably in danger.

“The vast majority of the northern cities have already been occupied by us! Heavenly South City hasn’t fallen yet, but they can’t hold out for long either! This time, our five half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven kings went south together. There definitely won’t be a single blade of grass that grows in the Land of Heavenly South!” Greenrock said in a solemn voice..
