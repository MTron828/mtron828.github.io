Chapter 2788: Fierce Battle with the Qian Kui Sea Clan!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan rode on Big Yellow and strolled leisurely on the sea.

The speed was not far and also not slow.

Little Dragon Girl Jingfei transformed into a flood dragon and circled around above the two people’s heads, like a jubilant skylark.

Very clearly, they did not take those seafolks seriously.

“Master Ye, is it really fine for us to be so leisurely?” Big Yellow said rather flusteredly.

“My goodness, you big yellow bull, why are you so long-winded? My Big Brother Ye Yuan is unparalleled under the heavens. How can these stinky seafolks be his match?” Before Ye Yuan said anything, Jingfei interrupted.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not that we’re not running, but that we can’t get away even if we run. Since it will be a fight sooner or later, we’ll fight then.”

“But if it startles a True Sovereign Heaven …”

“How can True Sovereign Heavens be so bored? If they really wanted to take action, Zhuo Bufan would have long died. How could he have possibly been chased down for ten million miles?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Big Yellow thought about it and felt that it made sense.

In the eyes of True Sovereign Heavens, Saint Sovereign Heavens were merely ant-like existences.

Killing a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven did not do much good. How could they really care about such a trivial matter?

According to the nautical chart, they only traveled less than half of the distance in the Qian Kui Sea Region.

True Sovereign level sea regions were too big. It was virtually ten thousand times as large!

Even if Ye Yuan pushed on with his journey with all his strength, it would take a year or two as well.

There was no way to run at all.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s mind stirred, and he said, “They are here! Two grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens!”

Big Yellow’s body tensed up, preparing for a great battle.

After several breaths, the void trembled, and a large group of powerhouses appeared above the sea.

After counting carefully, there were roughly 60 over Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, more than twice as many as before!

Whalebillow was in the forefront and looked at Ye Yuan and shouted coldly, “Boy, you dare to cause trouble in Qian Ye Sea Region. Are you tired of living?”

“This Ye didn’t cause trouble. It was just that my younger sister was mischievous. The trouble that she caused, I’ll shoulder it!”

Ye Yuan’s words were very flat, but it was extremely domineering.

It was naturally impossible to hand Jingfei over.

Since that was the case, then he could only shoulder it!

Whalebillow sneered coldly when he heard that and said, “A mere lower Saint Sovereign Heaven, can you shoulder it?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Whether or not I can bear it, wouldn’t you know after trying it out?”

“Alright, I’ll give it a try then!”

Whalebillow shouted loudly and threw a punch out with a loud bang.

A transformed giant whale directly smashed towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan raised his brows, did not expect that this guy was actually a transformation powerhouse.

However, he did not hesitate, similarly throwing a punch out.

Boom!

The surface of the sea shook; that transformed giant whale was actually dispersed by Ye Yuan with one punch!

The exchange of blows between the two actually directly blew those Saint Sovereign Heavens away.

It could be seen how strong this force was.

Whalebillow’s pupils constricted, horrified by Ye Yuan’s strength.

“It turns out to be a divergent cultivator! No wonder your strength is so powerful!” Whalebillow cried out in surprise.

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “You actually know about divergent cultivators.”

Whalebillow had a disdainful look as he said, “What’s strange about this? There are countless heaven’s chosens in the sea. Over time, there will more or less be some people that heaven is jealous of that appear! However, since you’ve stepped onto this path, your days are numbered too! Hand over that lass. This exalt can let you spend your remaining days in peace.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “My remaining years are very long. There’s no need for you to worry about it.”

Whalebillow laughed loudly and said, “Boy, stop self-hypnotizing! Even if the divergent cultivators in our sea cultivate to True Sovereign Heaven, they will die miserably under the Dao tribulation in the end, without exception! What right do you have to be an exception?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “My fate is up to me, not up to Heaven!”

Whalebillow sneered and said, “Looks like you won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin! Starshine, attack together and kill this boy!”

By the side, Starshine nodded his head, his figure suddenly flashing and disappearing.

While the other Saint Sovereign Heaven quickly retreated.

In the next moment, countless star-like motes of light appeared around Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, feeling a great danger.

His figure swayed, wanting to shake off these starlight dots.

But right at this time, Whalebillow’s giant whale attacked again!

This time, Whalebillow did not dare to underestimate Ye Yuan too. He directly used 70% of his strength.

Five giant whales sealed off all of Ye Yuan’s escape routes.

“Boy, even if it’s a divergent cultivator, they won’t dare to look down on our Qian Kui Sea Region’s five great war generals too! Go and die!” Whalebillow gave a loud roar, his aura releasing fully.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, a small sword faintly appearing between his eyebrows.

He bellowed and bombarded the surroundings frenziedly!

At the same time, those starlights suddenly burst apart.

Above the sea, it was as brilliant as fireworks.

Bang, bang, bang?…

The terrifying explosions completely drowned Ye Yuan.

When Big Yellow saw this scene, his pupils constricted too.

These two great grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens were so strong!

Jingfei’s complexion turned deathly pale, patting her chest and saying, “It’s ok, it’s ok. Big Brother Ye Yuan is the strongest. He’ll definitely be fine!”

“Humph!?Damn girl, you’d better worry about yourself! The five great war generals under Sovereign Qian Kui’s command are all transformation powerhouses! This time, in order to deal with this punk, two were dispatched at once. This kid is dead for sure!”

The large turtle and the others were already too impatient to wait. They charged toward Jingfei.

While another group of people also besieged Big Yellow.

They were unable to take part in Ye Yuan’s battle with the two great war generals at all.

Too strong.

If they entered, they would only be instantly killed!

“Pffft!”

“Pffft!”

Wu Tuan’s voice had yet to fade when Starshine and Whalebillow two people spurted blood at the same time, their bodies flying out backward.

Meanwhile, the place of the original explosion formed a vacuum area with Ye Yuan as the center!

Ye Yuan was perfectly unscathed while Starshine and Whalebillow two people were injured by the backlash.

The expressions of the Qian Kui seafolks present changed one after another.

“This … How is this possible? A divergent cultivator can’t be so strong either, right? He’s just lower Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

“Two great generals are actually not this boy’s match!”

“I heard that a divergent cultivator appeared in Nine Lives Sea Region before. But when he was lower Saint Sovereign Heaven, he could at most rival a peak upper Saint Sovereign Heaven! Why is this kid so strong?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

… …

It was not that there were no divergent cultivators, but they had not seen before such a freak!

For ordinary divergent cultivators, being able to jump two minor realms and face the enemy was already very impressive.

But Ye Yuan directly jumped three minor realms to confront the enemy!

Furthermore, it was one-on-two!

Furthermore, it was even two transformation powerhouses!

Those able to rank among the five great war generals were extremely powerful people.

Qian Kui Sea Region’s grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens were naturally not just the five of them.

But the five of them were the strongest.

But now, two people joined forces and actually could not beat Ye Yuan. This was a little scary.

“Damn it. This boy is a three-laws divergent cultivator. He’s too strong! The two of us can’t resist him! Wu Tuan, you quickly send a message and have Purplesandal and Soulcut come over too!” Whalebillow yelled out.

Hearing the yell, Wu Tuan was shocked.

This kid was actually already so strong to this extent?

It actually needed four great transformation experts to deal with him?

However, she did not hesitate, plunging into the sea fiercely.

A small sword loomed between Ye Yuan’s eyebrows, three great power of rules operated without ceasing, the momentum seemingly unstoppable.. It caused Whalebillow and Starshine two people to steadily lose ground.
