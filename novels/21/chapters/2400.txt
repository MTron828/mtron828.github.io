Chapter 2406: Battling Three Great Nine-marks Powerhouses Alone!

After a fierce battle, both sides suffered heavy casualties.

Of course, the losses of the Divine Children Legion were more miserable.

After more than half a day, the combat power that the Divine Children Legion lost was already several tens of thousands!

This scale of loss was the first time in the history of the Divine Children Legion.

Everyone wanted to kill Ye Yuan, but the final results were their own deaths.

Ye Yuan’s True Nirvana Sword Formation was like a bottomless hole, continuously devouring the lives of the divine children.

Presently, Ye Yuan alone already killed close to ten thousand divine children, but he himself stood firm like a mountain.

Nineorigin wandered outside of the sword formation, screaming frantically in his heart, hoping for those three great Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realms to arrive as soon as possible.

At this time, he was virtually passing each second as if it was a year!

Seeing one companion after another die in front of him, he was almost going insane.

Of course, along with the passage of time, the effect of the sneak attack was already lost.

Under the positional warfare, their casualties started to intensify.

In a short half a day’s time, the army of 100 thousand people already lost close to 20 thousand people.

A loss of this scale was still because Ye Yuan contained the vast majority of the military force.

Pang Zhen and the rest became more and more terrified as they fought. Only now did they know how strong the divine race’s combat power was.

Looking at the Ye Yuan who was shuttling back and forth indeterminately inside the army, they could not help but admire.

If not for Ye Yuan, even if they could find this place, even if they ambushed, it would likely be the outcome of complete annihilation too.

This point was not worth the slightest doubt.

But they also discovered that this battle fighting until now, even though the casualties were heavy, the casualties were gradually decreasing.

Some unpredictable children already made considerable improvement after experiencing a tragic battle.

Indeed as Ye Yuan said, a battle at one’s limit was the fastest way to increase one’s strength!

As long as they survived this battle, this human army would become an elite division!

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan’s expression changed.

He sensed that several powerful auras were moving quickly to this side.

This shock was by no means insignificant.

These few auras were very powerful, virtually arriving in an instant.

When Yuan Zhen three people rushed over and saw this miserable scene, they were also dumbstruck with shock.

They had never thought that the Divine Children Legion would actually be forced to such an extent!

This Divine Children Legion before their eyes was already close to half lost.

The army of over 200 thousand was only left with 120 to 130 thousand people already.

It could be seen how strong this battle’s opponents were!

“Where did this human army pop out from? How can they be so strong?” Tian Zhao said in shock.

Yuan Zhen’s gaze turned slightly dark and he said, “Looks like we underestimated the humans! However, Tian Xu is actually not in the army. Could it be that ... he actually fell?”

The moment the two people looked, they indeed did not find Tian Xu, and could not help being shocked.

The piece of intel was sent by Tian Xu, but Tian Xu was no longer in the army.

Then there was only one possibility. Tian Xu already died!

But the army was still there and the commander was already dead.

This kind of situation was really too surprising.

Yuan Zhen’s gaze suddenly fell on Ye Yuan and his pupils could not help constricting.

“That human restrained close to half of the military might by himself, truly terrifying! Tian Xu probably called us here for him! I really didn’t think that the humans actually had such a terrifying genius!” Yuan Zhen exclaimed. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But right at this time, Nineorigin finally discovered these three people and was immediately overcome with joy, calling out in a loud voice, “Lord Yuan Zhen, Commander Tian Xu has already been killed by Ye Yuan! This boy’s talent is too monstrous. We definitely can’t let him live! Three excellencies, please take action and kill this guy!”

Yuan Zhen’s eyes turned slightly grim and he said with a nod, “Understood! Tian Zhao, Li Qing, attack together and kill this boy!”

At the same time with him being shocked, Yuan Zhen’s apprehension toward Ye Yuan also became extremely strong.

He already saw through that Ye Yuan’s sword formation contained four kinds of terrifying power of laws. Furthermore, all of them practically reached the level of rank two source.

This kind of talent was simply too inconceivable.

How could this sort of person be left on this earth?

Boom!

Yuan Zhen released his aura, the pressure of Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm suddenly spread out.

Only then did many unpredictable children notice Yuan Zhen three people. Their expressions immediately changed wildly.

“Lord Saint Azure, things are bad! Three Nine-marks powerhouses actually came from the divine race! This place isn’t suitable to stay for long. Let’s hurry up and retreat!” Wan Zhen exclaimed.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan yelled out, “All hold steady for me! It’s already too late to retreat now. It will only cause more casualties! Leave these three people to me! Wan Zhen, Pang Zhen, the Divine Children Legion will be left to you all!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly turned into nothingness.

When he appeared again, he was already facing Yuan Zhen.

Rumble!

In virtually a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan already clashed with the three people.

A single rumble made everyone present extremely shocked.

Ye Yuan was actually completely unscathed under the pincer-attack of the three great Nine-marks powerhouses!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan came and went as he pleased.

If he wanted to go, nobody could keep him at all.

It was easy for him to leave, but it would not be that easy for the other unpredictable children to want to leave.

Therefore, Ye Yuan did not leave!

Wan Zhen and Pang Zhen were all sensible people. One looked and they knew what was going on.

This sudden turn of events was what everyone did not expect.

But Ye Yuan’s action made them inexplicably moved.

He alone blocked more than half of the pressure!

Wan Zhen said in a clear voice, “Brothers, hold on for me! Lord Saint Azure fought dauntlessly in a bloody battle for us. So we can’t hold him back either! The Divine Children Legion is merely like this. Let’s kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

... ...

For some time, the human army was greatly encouraged and erupted with a powerful combat strength.

However, the moment Ye Yuan left, the Divine Children Legion’s combat power was instantly liberated. Their combat strength suddenly increased by a huge margin.

In virtually an instant, both sides’ fighting escalated again.

The battle became even more miserable.

While on Ye Yuan’s side, Ye Yuan actually blocked three great Nine-marks powerhouses with his power alone!

And among them, there was even a true divine child, Yuan Zhen!

Although these three people just entered Nine-marks, their combat power already closed in on Deva Second Blight.

But even so, Ye Yuan’s True Nirvana Sword Formation still resisted them stubbornly.

“Blazing Flame Heavenly Pit!”

“True Martial Universe!”

“Taiyi Heaven Seal!”

Yuan Zhen three people did not hesitate in the slightest, unleashing powerful moves.

But when they faced off against Ye Yuan, they felt like they had fallen into a quagmire.

The vortex of spacetime law greatly reduced the power of their formidable moves.

The more the three fought, the more shocked they became!

A mere human late-stage Heavenly Emperor martial artist actually jumped realms and blocked the teaming-up of three great Nine-marks powerhouses?

When Nineorigin saw this scene, he was shocked until he was staring dumbfoundedly with his mouth agape.

To the divine race, Eight-marks to Nine-marks was a heavenly chasm!

This heavenly chasm was far from what Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor to Deva First Blight could compare to.

But crossing this heavenly chasm, it was tantamount to standing on top of the summit, and one could roam the world unhindered!

Even if a powerhouse who just entered Nine-marks faced off against a Deva First Blight, it was virtually rolling them over too!

But now, Ye Yuan actually blocked the teaming-up of three great Nine-marks powerhouses with his power alone?
