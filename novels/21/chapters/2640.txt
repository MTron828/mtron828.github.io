Chapter 2646: On-site Guidance

A city lord spoke up, “Zuo Fang and Ge Ling are both top-tier grade three heavenly alchemists of the nine cities. This information can be inquired as long as one has the intention of doing so.”

The moment everyone heard this, they came back to their senses, and their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan were even more contemptuous.

It was just that Su Peiyun and Huang Haoyan both knew that Ye Yuan was not someone from Heavenly South at all. How could he possibly inquire about the information deliberately?

Hence, there was only one possibility. It was that he perceived it himself.

Disregarding other things, just this visual prowess alone was scary enough.

“Su Yi, you got to watch over this beloved daughter of yours carefully!” Sun Yunjing looked at Ye Yuan and said meaningfully.

The subtext was that this boy was very scheming and expended considerable effort in order to fish your daughter.

How could Su Yi not discern it? His face immediately became black as the bottom of a pot.

His impression of Ye Yuan was not very good to begin with. Now, he was even more displeased.

If not looking on the account of his daughter’s face, he would have long had people break his legs and tossed him out.

A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum posturing in front of a bunch of city lords, were you aware of the occasion or not?

Su Peiyun’s pretty face turned red, immediately blushing heavily.

But the Huang Haoyan by the side was furious.

He gritted his teeth and said in a solemn voice, “City Lord Sun, food can be eaten indiscriminately, but words can’t be said indiscriminately! Peiyun is my, Huang Haoyan’s woman! I’m afraid that it’s inappropriate for you to carelessly matchmake people like this, right?”

With that said, Su Peiyun’s pretty face turned even redder, almost stuffing her head into her neckline.

Ye Yuan was rather surprised by Huang Haoyan’s bluntness. This boy had always been obsequious in front of him but did not expect that he was actually so staunch at this time.

It could be seen that he really liked Su Peiyun.

Sun Yunjing was taken aback and suddenly laughed loudly and said, “Interesting, interesting! You’re Huang Nanshan’s son, right??Huhu,?this city lord apologizes to you! You young people’s matters, I’m really not too clear about it.”

His laughter was unbridled and had an even deeper meaning.

The other city lords also started laughing out loud one after another. Su Yi almost wanted to find a hole in the ground to burrow into. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

How could he not understand what these guys were laughing about?

They were laughing with him: your daughter was really promiscuous!

“Girl, what on earth is going on here?” Su Yi said with a black face.

He rarely lost his temper at his daughter. But this time, he reached the limit of his patience.

“Dad, I … I …” Su Peiyun also panicked for a moment, at a loss on what to do.

“Nothing’s going on. It’s just that your daughter is very filial and wanted to win me over for you, that’s why she brought me here. But it seems like you don’t really welcome it,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Win you over??Huhu,?you, a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, what’s worth winning over? You boy, really know how to gild gold onto your own face! Think that having done a bit of homework, you really feel that you’re amazing?” Sun Yunjing said with a snicker.

Ye Yuan gave Sun Yunjing a glance and said profoundly, “You’re very cocky!”

Sun Yunjing’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Brat, do you know who you’re talking to or not?”

Ye Yuan ignored him, but looked at Su Peiyun and said, “Originally, I wasn’t interested in joining Calm South City. But now, I’ve changed my mind.”

Su Peiyun was overjoyed when she heard that and said, “Senior Ye, is what you said true?”

Right now, Su Peiyun suddenly felt a little grateful toward Sun Yunjing.

If not for him provoking Ye Yuan repeatedly, Ye Yuan probably would not join Calm South City.

At least, she could be sure that the faction behind Ye Yuan was definitely much stronger than Calm South City!

In fact, it was not inferior to Heavenly South City!

The moment Sun Yunjing heard, he only felt amused and said, “Boy, you can really pretend! You mean that when you join Calm South City, we’ll all have to be more careful?”

When the group of city lords heard that, they all laughed loudly without ceasing.

In their view, Ye Yuan was simply a moron, how could he be worth winning over?

They really did not know what kind of bewitching soup Su Peiyun was forced to drink, to actually acknowledge him!

Ye Yuan gave Sun Yunjing a glance rather surprisedly and said, “Looks like you’re not too stupid either!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan flicked his finger.

Only to see a ray of sword light fly straight for Ge Ling.

Bang!

Ge Ling’s pill refinement was directly interrupted crudely.

He was currently fully concentrated on refining the pill. Suddenly being interrupted, he also went into a rampage.

“Brat, are you courting death?” Ge Ling arrived in front of Ye Yuan like the wind and roared.

Ye Yuan’s sudden move directly stunned everyone.

Did he join Calm South City to deal damage?

Hahahaha,?really a pig teammate!

Thought that he would say some harsh words, in the end, he directly made a move to interrupt his own people’s pill refinement.

Facing Ge Ling’s wrath, Ye Yuan appeared calm and collected. Waving his hand, he said, “You don’t need to refine anymore. According to your refining method, it’s impossible to win Zuo Fang all your life! Remember I’m about to say next carefully. Just nice, make use of this auction time to repeat it in your head! Finish him off in the next round!”

Ye Yuan ignored Ge Ling’s wrath as well and started talking on and on in a flow of eloquence.

He had observed for a long time and was fully aware of some of the minor problems in Ge Ling’s pill refinement.

Giving guidance at this time, it struck the vitals directly!

In the beginning, Ge Ling was almost rampaging under his rage. Luckily, Su Peiyun kept holding him back, that was why he did not blow up.

But very soon, the expression on Ge Ling’s face changed.

But Sun Yunjing said disdainfully, “A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum teaching a grade three heavenly alchemist alchemy, this is simply a joke! If randomly saying a few words can make people become stronger, then anyone can become a heavenly alchemist!”

However, the expression on Ge Ling’s face became more and more serious.

There were also many grade three heavenly alchemists present. Their faces actually revealed thoughtful looks too.

At this time, even Sun Yunjing discovered that something was wrong too.

He did not know alchemy, but it did not mean that he was a fool.

Ge Ling’s current expression was just like a student, just short of kneeling down to Ye Yuan.

Sun Yunjing’s brows furrowed slightly and he asked someone next to him, “Master Jiang Li, could it be that what this brat says is really something?”

Jiang Li’s strength was even a bit stronger than Zuo Fang.

It was just that currently, no one could force him out yet.

But at this time, the expression on Jiang Li’s face was noticeably showing he was surprised.

Seeing Sun Yunjing asking, he nodded and said, “The few points that he talked about are all Ge Ling’s shortcomings! Actually, I’ve long discovered it too. Ge Ling’s strength isn’t weak. It’s just because of his uncultivated origins, many details couldn’t be controlled, resulting in the poor quality. I didn’t expect that this boy just take a few glances and perceive it! This boy isn’t simple!”

Sun Yunjing felt his scalp tingle when he heard and said with a frown, “But, can just saying these few sentences make Ge Ling become strong?”

Jiang Li shook his head and said with a smile, “How is it possible? Knowing is one thing, doing it is another matter altogether! Moreover, Ge Ling’s pill refinement has long already formed a fixed style. It’s writing, habits are very hard to change. Even if he knows, it’s also impossible to have any improvements within a short time.”

The moment Sun Yunjing heard, he immediately felt relieved and said with a cold smile, “I want to see how this brat cleans up the mess!”

At this time, Ye Yuan suddenly said to Su Yi, “Arrange for a secret room. I want to give him a small sermon.”

Su Yi was taken aback. Then, he immediately came back to his senses and hurriedly made people go arrange it.
