Chapter 2303: Cloudheart Realm’s Crisis

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A piece of news that caused a great sensation instantly spread throughout the entire Cloudheart Realm.

The five great ancestors punished their disciples severely and had their eldest disciples hold the line; they kowtowed and apologized to Second Sage’s two followers.

The five great holy lands admitted to the outside world that Zhao Zixuan five people deliberately set things up to make Second Sage’s two followers fall into a trap.

This kind of action that showed no respect for their elders should be severely punished!

This sentence revealed a subtext. The five great holy lands changed their stance and admitted that Ye Yuan’s Second Sage position was equivalent to the ancestors!

The entire alchemy world exploded!

Some said that Ye Yuan brought the five great holy lands to their knees by himself, forcing the give great ancestors to have no choice but to lower their heads.

Others said that Ye Yuan defeated Yun Windborne, his strength reaching the peak. The ancestor finally chose to compromise in order to not offend Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

It was just that both parties did not come out to clarify.

Nobody knew what happened inside the great hall.

Of course, the final result was that Ye Yuan won.

Zhao Zixuan five people refused to apologize. But the final outcome was kneeling and apologizing.

This unexpected turn of events scored full marks.

When Heavenly Emperor Justbright two people saw Zhao Zixuan kowtow, they were completely stunned.

Zhao Zixuan’s strength was inferior to his, but in terms of status, Zhao Zixuan flung him more than ten streets behind.

As for Old Drunkard, that went even more without saying.

When Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin three people heard this news, they were completely stunned too.

Before this, they all thought that Ye Yuan was looking for abuse and could not climb to the top of the mountain at all.

But who knew that the situation actually took a sudden turn for the worse, the five great holy lands yielded collectively!

“This is impossible! Could it be that that boy really already reached the realm of Dao pill?” Zi Jin’s expression changed wildly as he said.

Ye Yuan’s strength was a tremendous blow to Yun Windborne, how was it not the same to him?

People who refined pills, who did not wish to advance to the realm of Dao pill?

As the Medicine Ancestor’s youngest disciple, Zi Jin’s strength also reached Deva Realm already, and his Alchemy Dao reached the late-stage Ancestor Realm already.

Even though it was still separated by a layer of grand completion, his goal was already locked onto Dao pill!

Under the Medicine Ancestor’s command, only Eldest Disciple Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy and Second Disciple Heavenly Emperor Distantbook reached the realm of Dao pill.

The others were all unable to pierce this layer of windowpane paper.

One lineage, three Dao pill realms. Therefore, Cloudheart Realm was the well-deserving number one alchemy holy land of the Heavenspan World.

“Youngest Martial Uncle is thinking too much! That punk defeated Yun Windborne after all. His talent is astonishing. The five great ancestors must be wary of the Sacred Ancestor High Priest behind him. That’s why they would take a step back,” Leng Tianqi said.

“Yeah, Lord Zi jin also didn’t think about it; how difficult is it to pierce this layer of windowpane paper! How heaven-defying are the few lords’ talents, but they still failed to break through after so long. Just the likes of him, a brat who’s a few thousand years old, how can he possibly break through?” Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather said.

However, Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin did not think so.

He mused for a moment and said, “I feel that it’s more likely that he broke through to the realm of Dao pill!”

When the two people heard that, their expressions changed.

Zi Jin continued, “The importance that Master attaches to him exceeds your imaginations. If he didn’t reach the realm of Dao pill, Master absolutely won’t attach such importance to him! Furthermore, the five great ancestors are all figures who are incredibly shrewd. If Ye Yuan doesn’t have sufficient strength, how could they bow their heads? No matter how honorable and dignified the person is, making their disciples kneel down and apologize, this is a huge scandal!”

The more Azurefeather two people listened, the more alarmed they got. In the end, it already became shock.

This conclusion was too shocking!

Furthermore, Zi Jin analyzed with penetrating criticism, they really could not find a reason to refute it. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Actually, as long as one had sufficient status, analyzing these was not hard.

It was just that they were not willing to believe this fact, that was all.

“This ... How is this possible? He’s still only a kid!” Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather said in shock.

Being under the Medicine Ancestor’s command, he was all too clear what the realm of Dao pill meant.

Zi Jin’s eyes glimmered, a trace of understanding arose in his heart, and he said with a sigh, “I finally know why Master raised such a big rumpus to organize the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference!”

Azurefeather and Leng Tianqi two people trembled at the same time, and said in disbelief, “Could ... Could it be because of Ye Yuan?”

Zi Jin nodded slowly and said, “Master has always been devoted to Dao and has long already not questioned secular affairs. He has also not hosted such a grand alchemy conference for a long time already. But this time, he organized the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference unprecedentedly. Don’t you all find it strange?”

The more Zi Jin said, the more shocked the two people got.

Leng Tianqi muttered, “This ... the Priest Temple is Cloudheart Realm’s great enemy to begin with. The Sacred Ancestor High Priest is also only a hair’s breadth away from the Progenitor. If ... Ye Yuan is also a Dao pill realm powerhouse, then ...”

Thinking about it, Leng Tianqi felt terrified!

Cloudheart Realm had three Dao pill realms in one lineage, and it was reputed to be the strongest in the world.

But Ye Yuan also reached such a boundary, then the Priest Temple would have two Dao pill realm powerhouses.

Then the Priest Temple’s influence would also expand significantly.

It would even threaten the position of Cloudheart Realm!

Zi Jin suddenly smiled bitterly and said, “I’m afraid that it’s more than that!”

Leng Tianqi said in surprise, “What else is there?”

This kind of situation was already extremely bad, could it be that there was still something even worse.

Zi Jin’s vision was far more so than the two.

His thoughts and opinions were clearly more comprehensive than the two.

“Ye Yuan’s limelight is so bright. Is it just those five ancestors that he’s posing a threat to? What about Sacred Ancestor High Priest? What about Master? Ye Yuan comprehended Dao pill while being so young. Who dares to say that he ... can’t refine a true Dao pill in the future!” As Zi Jin said, his breathing suddenly became ragged.

True Dao pill!

These three words seemed to be overwhelmingly heavy!

Regardless of whether it was the Medicine Ancestor or Sacred Ancestor High Priest, or the various ancestors, their goal was the true Dao pill!

What the true Dao pill was, nobody knew either.

But that was their lifelong pursuit!

“Then Sacred Ancestor High Priest clearly knows this. So why does he still let him grow unchecked?” Zi Jin continued.

The two people were long already shocked until they were staring dumbfoundedly and their mouths agape. They replied mechanically, “Why?”

Zi Jin said, “Because he wants to borrow Ye Yuan’s hands to make himself grow! For so many years, he has always wanted to surpass Master!”

Talking up to here, their minds all shook violently including Zi Jin.

This consequence was too terrifying!

If Sacred Ancestor High Priest surpassed Medicine Ancestor in all aspects, if Ye Yuan gathered more and more momentum, the entire alchemy world’s arrangement would be completely overturned!

Cloudheart Realm would no longer be the number one alchemy holy land.

It would be the Sacrificial Temple!

Since time immemorial, how many alchemy path powerhouses have attempted to overturn Cloudheart Realm’s position as the overlord, but they did not accomplish it.

Even Sacred Ancestor High Priest with his level of astonishing talent was also suppressed by Master until he could not lift his head.

But now, a brat who was only over 2000 years old came roaring into existence and completely disrupted the alchemy world’s arrangement.

Once Zi Jin’s conjectures came true, this consequence would be too terrifying for Cloudheart Realm!

And this also explained why Myriad Region Alchemy Conference organized the grand Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time, going against convention.

His goal was simply Ye Yuan!
