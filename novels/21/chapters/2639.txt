Chapter 2645: Tell You!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Uncle Sun, what you said is wrong! Your Water Billow City is close to Heavenly South City. Being in a favorable position. You had the advantage in timing, geographical, and human conditions, and have always been number one, that’s why you became stronger and stronger. What’s the use of bullying our Calm South City? If you have the ability, beat Heavenly South City!”

At this time, Su Peiyun’s words interrupted Sun Yunjing’s reproving.

When Su Yi saw Su Peiyun, he had a look of pleasant surprise as he said, “Little Su, you’re finally back!”

Su Peiyun smiled and said, “Father, Yun-er just went to train. Do you have to be like this?”

The father and daughter two people clearly had a very good relationship. Su Yi’s eyes when looking at Su Peiyun were full of doting.

It could be seen that Su Peiyun was Su Yi’s beloved daughter.

“Huhu,?Little Girl Su is still so razor-tongued! Heavenly South City is the capital city of the Land of Heavenly South, how can we compare? Want to compare, it’s also comparing between the Thistle South Nine Cities. Otherwise, what’s the point of this Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit?” Sun Yunjing said with a laugh.

“Humph!?In the end, it’s still our lack of resources that led to the decline in Alchemy Dao! You guys won unscrupulously!” Su Peiyun argued strongly.

Sun Yunjing laughed and said, “You lass, alright. This city lord won’t stoop to the level of a junior like you. However, Su Yi, the next round is about to begin right away. Who are you all planning to send up to the stage?”

This Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit was not just a dispute caused by personal feelings. It was also a fight for resources.

Each city would obtain the resource bias of Heavenly South City based on their rankings!

One had to know, the judge of this Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit was a grade four heavenly alchemist sent by Heavenly South City!

It was evident that Heavenly South City attached great importance to these nine cities.

It was just that Calm South City suffered repeated defeats with each battle, forming a vicious cycle.

Coupled with that they were lacking talents, that was why they got bogged down deeper and deeper.

Su Yi had a black face and said to an old man beside him, “Elder Ge, I can only trouble you again!”

Ge Ling sighed slightly and walked over towards the pill refining area.

Su Yi could only hope for Ge Ling to outdo himself now and win the round.

It was just that this hope was very bleak. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Dad, let me introduce someone to you. This is a friend that Yun-er got to know outside called Ye Yuan! It’s all thanks to him that your daughter could return safe and sound!” Su Peiyun introduced Ye Yuan with an excited look.

Su Yi gave Ye Yuan a glance, lacking in interest.

Ye Yuan was merely middle Greater Sublime Heaven. Su Yi reckoned that he just warded off some danger for his daughter. That was all.

Later, he would give Ye Yuan some benefits and compensate a little, and it would be considered settled.

Maybe this boy even had the intention of currying favor with those in power and deliberately did so.

“Mn,?thank you very much, Little Brother!” Su Yi said coolly.

How could Ye Yuan not perceive Su Yi’s vigilance? However, he did not care either and just said indifferently, “Don’t mention it.”

Ye Yuan’s attitude made Su Yi a little unhappy.

Furthermore, his current thoughts were more on Ge Ling. Hence, he could not be bothered to pay attention either.

Su Peiyun saw that the atmosphere was a little stiff and could not help secretly panicking.

It was just that the occasion did not allow it, it was inappropriate for her to explain too much as well, she could only divert the topic and talk about the Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit.

But, she saw that Ye Yuan was absorbed in it and felt slightly relieved in her heart too.

“Senior Ye, I’ve incurred your ridicule. Our Calm South City’s alchemy path strength is bottom-tier among the nine cities. Although Master Ge is impressive, he’s powerless to turn the tables too!” Su Peiyun said with a bitter smile.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Ge Ling’s strength isn’t weak. It’s just that he has some minor defects when refining pills, which results in his quality being worse than others. If he fixes these minor problems, he won’t be weaker than the others!”

At this time, this round of alchemy competition already started too.

What kind of visual prowess did Ye Yuan have?

When he was at the Pill Pavilion, he was an existence who guided grade four heavenly alchemists!

Ge Ling’s pros and cons, he understood them at a glance.

If one really wanted to talk about which of these nine cities’ heavenly alchemists was weaker or stronger, it was not definite too.

After all, the nine cities were existences on the same level. Although there were differences in resources, it was not to the extent of being too different.

However, pill refining was like this.

The details determined success or failure!

Some minor problems would cause the final difference in quality.

Su Peiyun thought that Ye Yuan was consoling her and said with a bitter smile, “When Master Ge is in his best condition, the One Heart Life Crossing Pill can only reach lower fifth grade, sixth grade is absolutely impossible! He’s far worse compared to Master Zuo Fang!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Zuo Fang’s strength is also just like that. If Ge Ling gets rid of those minor problems, he’d probably be even stronger than him.”

Talking about pill refinement, Ye Yuan was also overcritical and very serious.

His current strength was god knows how many times stronger compared to when he was battling in alchemy with Cang Yongning!

The likes of Zuo Fang were really very ordinary in his eyes.

“Huhu,?what high-sounding sentiments! A measly little Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum actually looks down on grade three heavenly alchemists. Where did your courage come from?”

Sun Yunjing was not far away from them, these words naturally landed in his ears and he immediately felt very displeased.

If you were a grade three heavenly alchemist and postured a bit, forget it then.

A bullshit Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum was also posturing?

Su Yi frowned slightly too, his impression of Ye Yuan worsening.

In his view, Ye Yuan saying this was intentionally for him to hear. The purpose was naturally in order to ingratiate to him.

It was just that, you, a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, spouted a stream of empty rhetoric in front of a group of city lords, who gave you the courage?

These words were not kissing ass, but getting kicked by an ass!

But beside Su Peiyun, Huang Haoyan was secretly delighted.

Ye Yuan provoked a group of city lords, he probably would not gain anything good out of it.

At that time, City Lord Su Yi naturally would not like him.

“Yun-er, bring this friend of yours for a stroll in the city.” Su Yi gave face to his daughter and was already very tolerant of it.

But Sun Yunjing was unrelenting and stopped him and said, “Don’t! This little brother looks down on even grade three heavenly alchemists. He probably has some real skills! This city lord really wants to hear what brilliant opinions do you have?”

Su Yi’s face turned black, immediately feeling upset.

This Sun Yunjing was intentionally putting him on the spot!

Su Peiyun saw that the atmosphere was a little awkward and hurriedly said, “Uncle Sun, sorry! This friend of mine only said this to comfort me. I’ll bring him away at once!”

Finished saying, she hurriedly pulled the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves, hinting for Ye Yuan to leave.

Who knew that Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you want to hear, I’ll tell you about it then. Zuo Fang’s approach is very orthodox. It should have been taught by an expert! If my conjecture is right, he should be from Heavenly South City, right? In contrast, Ge Ling’s approach is much wilder. When refining, he doesn’t have a proper method system. Most likely, he fumbled his way into becoming a grade three heavenly alchemist. However, Ge Ling is pretty good. His foundation is very solid and his talent is decent too. If he cultivates the proper way, it’s also not impossible to step into grade four heavenly alchemist in the future.”

The review dumbfounded the group of city lords.

With regards to these two people’s background, although it was not some big secret, it was absolutely not what a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum could inquire about.

But Ye Yuan said it without the slightest error!

But Su Peiyun was shocked and said, “Senior Ye, you’re really too incredible! Master Zuo Fang has once studied under Heavenly South City’s Master Wu Deng’s tutelage, it’s just that very few people know about it! As for Master Ge Ling, he had once obtained some lucky chances before, and fumbled his way into becoming a heavenly alchemist!”
