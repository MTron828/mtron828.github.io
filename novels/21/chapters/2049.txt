Chapter 2053: Shedding All Pretenses of Cordiality!

At Heavenly Eagle, Duan Yunfei looked at Yun Yi with a look of awkwardness.

Before leaving, he pledged in all solemnity, saying that Yun Yi would regret it. But now, it was him who regretted it.

Yes, he came back again.

After receiving the news of Ye Yuan’s domineering breakthrough, he returned to Heavenly Eagle without any stop.

Presently, the Pill Tower’s administrator was Xuan Yu.

Toward these genius alchemists whose backgrounds were exceedingly profound, Xuan Yu could not offend them either. He could only let them come back.

Although he knew that Ye Yuan would not take these people in, how to decide it was Ye Yuan’s business. He could not very well make a decision for Ye Yuan too.

“Brother Yun, I ...” Duan Yunfei said with a bitter face.

He persisted for as long as ten years but did not expect to fall short of success at the last second.

But not coming to try one time, he was also not reconciled to it.

Maybe Ye Yuan’s heart would soften and take him in?

Yun Yi looked at Duan Yunfei and said with a sigh, “Sigh! I urged you not to leave back then, but you wouldn’t listen! You already held out for ten years, so why was there a need to be anxious after that long?”

Duan Yunfei revealed a smile that was even uglier than crying and said, “Who could have thought that ... it would be like this?!”

At that time, the whole world firmly believed that Ye Yuan already died. Duan Yunfei never dreamed that not only did Ye Yuan not die, but also his strength improved greatly instead.

He already received the news from the Duan Family that Ye Yuan’s domineering breakthrough at Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital shocked the world.

Essence, Energy, and Spirit; three paths breaking through at the same time, strength advancing by leaps and bounds, directly stepping into Ancestor Realm.

Such a heaven-defying figure, he actually thought that he was dead for sure previously!

Freaking hell, Your Father’s head must have been kicked by a donkey!

Yun Yi shook his head and said, “Although I don’t understand Grandmaster Ye, it seems like this level of figure will surely be proud to the extreme. Previously, even though you weren’t too diligent in cultivating, he might have taken you in in consideration of your willpower. But you left halfway, so it’s likely very hard for him to take you in anymore.”

Duan Yunfei’s expression choked up, Yun Yi’s words dealt a blow to him.

Ten years of persistence were scrapped in one day!

“Sigh, even if there’s only a trace of hope, I also want to stay! Hope that he’ll take me in on the account of my ten-year persistence!” Duan Yunfei said with a sigh.

He currently regretted it until his intestines were green, but there was no regret medicine to eat in this world.

At least, his hope was much higher compared to Luo Tianqi those people.

Ever since Ye Yuan’s news came over, the geniuses that left previously, many came back again one after another.

Presently, inside the Pill Tower, there were already close to 20 people.

Toward Yun Yi and Yang Xuan persisting like this, they were previously disdainful and scoff in derision at it before this.

But now, they were endlessly envious of these two people.

At the very least, these two people’s chances were greater than theirs.

...

Inside Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s City Lord Manor, Ye Yuan’s gaze looked towards Empyrean Proudcloud scorchingly and he said with a cold smile, “Brother Proudcloud, shouldn’t you all give this Ye an explanation?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Empyrean Proudcloud gave a cold snort and said, “What explanation do you want? I’ve already sent the order, all of this Empyrean’s forces will immediately withdraw out of your sphere of influence. Could it be that this still isn’t enough?”

“Not enough!” Ye Yuan said firmly and clearly.

Empyrean Proudcloud sneered and said, “You say that it’s not enough and so it’s not enough? Don’t look at how you’re sitting on the seat of a grandmaster, thinking that you can really throw hands with this Empyrean.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Throw hands? You’re fit too?”

“You!” Empyrean Proudcloud said, seemingly stifled.

But Ye Yuan did not even look at him. Looking at Empyrean Pilljade, he said, “Brother Pilljade, I wonder how you view this matter?”

From Empyrean Flutterfeather there, Ye Yuan had long known that this Empyrean Proudcloud and some of the other Empyreans were merely Empyrean Pilljade’s lackeys.

As long as he forced Empyrean Pilljade to lower his head, Empyrean Proudcloud naturally would not even dare to let out a fart.

Empyrean Pilljade’s face fell and he said, “Although Younger Brother Proudcloud was wrong in this matter, during these ten years, everyone thought that something happened to you. According to the alliance’s agreement, your territory was a land without a master. Therefore, Younger Brother Proudcloud’s crime is pardonable!”

Although Yun Yi wanted to acknowledge Ye Yuan as master, this was this, and that was that.

In front of such tremendous profits, why would Empyrean Pilljade care about a measly little Yun Yi?

One should not look at how the places that Empyrean Proudcloud they all occupied was small. All of the Empyreans added up also reached 30% of the entire territory.

Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital already lost the position of alliance chief and 10% of the share. So how could they still make any concessions?

No matter how genius that Yun Yi was, he was also just a junior.

His Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital was such a colossal titan. Wouldn’t grooming one or two geniuses still be easily accomplished?

Moreover, even if Yun Yi failed to acknowledge him as master, could it be that he could not teach him?

No matter what, he was an Ancestor Realm powerhouse too!

Empyrean Pilljade still had this bit of pride.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Land without a master? Heh heh, want to act shamelessly is it? Looks like ... you all won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin!”

Empyrean Proudcloud smiled coldly and said, “What? Could it be that you still really dare to withdraw from the alliance? Do you think that Brother Flutterfeather really dares to play such high stakes with you? Once you guys withdraw, that’s contending against the entire Southern Border’s alchemy world! You weigh the consequences yourself!”

The other Empyreans, including several grandmasters, all secretly nodded.

Ye Yuan said that he had more than a dozen pill formulas in his hands. He merely said it verbally, everyone would not take it seriously.

But becoming enemies with the entire Southern Border’s alchemy world, not everyone had this guts.

After all, although Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure was formidable, the Southern Border also had quite a number of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses whose strength was not inferior to his.

Empyrean Pilljade also said, “Brother Flutterfeather, once you withdraw from the alliance, it’s becoming enemies with everyone seated here! Although Ye Yuan’s talent is high, he hasn’t grown up after all and isn’t able to refine rank seven divine pills. Is it appropriate for you to bet like this?”

His words were threatening Empyrean Flutterfeather, and similarly also isolating Ye Yuan.

Heavenly Eagle was merely a small place. If Empyrean Flutterfeather did not accompany Ye Yuan, Ye Yuan could not stir up any waves at all.

“Brother Flutterfeather, you have to think thrice before acting!” Empyrean Blazing Sun also urged.

The few great grandmasters, even Empyrean Windrider, were persuading Empyrean Flutterfeather. Only Empyrean Lumen was silent.

Clearly, they were joining hands to apply pressure and also joining hands to suppress Ye Yuan.

Once they separated Empyrean Flutterfeather and Ye Yuan, Heavenly Eagle would be a piece of fatty meat. The alliance before would not count anymore.

Previously, the various grandmasters were in a state of disunity and did not condense together at all.

But the shock that Ye Yuan’s breakthrough this time brought to them was too strong, making them feel an immense threat.

If the Myriad Treasure Tower had Flutterfeather and Ye Yuan joining hands, who in the Southern Border could still suppress them in the future?

Hence, they unknowingly banded up together.

Everyone was currently chirping and talking non-stop when Empyrean Flutterfeather suddenly stood up. Gaze sweeping across everyone’s faces, he said coolly, “You guys are also looking down on me, Flutterfeather, too much! Since you all are so shameless, then ... wage war then! From this day forth, my Myriad Treasure Tower will withdraw from the Southern Border Alliance. As for territory, all of us, each will rely on their own ability! If you guys can snatch territory from my Myriad Treasure Tower’s hands, feel free to come and give it a try!”

Everyone’s faces could not help changing drastically when they saw the situation.

They all did not expect that Empyrean Flutterfeather was actually so decisive!
