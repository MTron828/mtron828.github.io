1388 Sundering Stars!

The crowd was seething!

A small black dot in the horizon was rapidly closing in on this side. Who was it if not Ye Yuan?

“My God! Could it be that he broke through to Divine Lord Realm? How is he actually able to fly in the sky?”

“Are you f*cking stupid? A middle-stage Grotto Profound breaking through to the Divine Lord Realm in three years?”

“If it’s Divine Lord Realm, the pressure is a little too small as well!”

“You guys, look under his feet! S-Sword flight?”

When the small black dot approached, the people finally clearly saw Ye Yuan in full view.

Under his feet ... He was stepping on a sword!

Ye Yuan was maneuvering a sword and flying!

Ye Yuan was approaching extremely rapidly. But the closer he got, the more powerful his aura.

“This guy is breaking through!”

“Sword maneuvering flight while breaking through, this ...”

The people were utterly flustered. Ye Yuan’s way of coming onto the stage was truly a bit too astonishing.

In the crowd, Little Fatty muttered to himself, saying with displeasure, “This guy is also too capable at posturing! This way of coming onto the stage is really freaking sensational!”

He looked at the besotted appearances of those female students nearby and was envious to the extreme.

Ye Yuan’s entrance to the playing field was simply too cool.

As he flew, he frenziedly devoured heaven and earth spiritual energy, throwing the surrounding heaven and earth spiritual energy in the entire martial arena into an upheaval.

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan turned into a stream of flowing light and finally stopped opposite Qin Shao.

While at this time, Ye Yuan’s realm firmly stopped at late-stage Grotto Profound.

“Apologies, I made you wait a long time,” Ye Yuan put away the Evil Extermination Sword and said to Qin Shao. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Shao’s face fell, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of dread.

There were more than tens of millions of people who cultivated the sword under the heavens. But those able to achieve sword maneuvering flight, there might not be one in a million.

Those able to do this, not one did not have an exceedingly profound understanding of Sword Dao.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao attainments were already unfathomable!

“I didn’t wait that long either, so let’s get started!”

Dread was dread, but Ye Yuan’s appearance stimulated Qin Shao’s powerful fighting intent even more.

“Hang on!” Qin Nantian shouted.

Tong Shou’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Family Head Nantian, what’s wrong?”

Qin Nantian said, “Ye Yuan learned sword maneuvering flight, this battle isn’t fair!”

“Heh, Family Head Qin, your words, this Chi doesn’t understand. Sword maneuvering flight was comprehended by Ye Yuan. It’s not cheating either, how is this fight not fair?” Chi Fang opened his mouth and said at an inappropriate timing.

Indeed, to the Heavenspan World’s martial artists under Divine Lord Realm, although their combat power was strong, not being able to fly, this weakness, greatly limited their combat power.

Once martial artists were able to fly in the sky and burrow into the ground, there was a tremendous advantage to boundaries of fighting and evading the other party’s moves.

Now, Ye Yuan was able to fly with his sword, he was virtually in an undefeatable position.

No matter how fast Qin Shao’s casting speed was, it was also not faster than Ye Yuan’s sword maneuvering flight.

Qin Nantian also did not expect that Ye Yuan gave him such a big surprise at the eleventh hour. This made his previous confidence immediately collapse.

Qin Nantian gave a cold snort and said, “Ye Yuan’s strength is no good, if he makes use of sword maneuvering flight to keep moving about non-stop, what then? That way, wouldn’t this life and death battle have to go on without ceasing? Elder Tong, I request to ban Ye Yuan from using sword maneuvering flight!”

Chi Fang immediately said, “Life and death battles don’t limit any methods in the first place. As long as it’s one’s true strength, nobody can talk behind their backs! Ye Yuan spent three years’ time to comprehend sword maneuvering flight, but you said that the fight isn’t fair. Where’s the logic? Moreover, Ye Yuan is far inferior to Qin Shao in cultivation realm to begin with! Why don’t you have Ye Yuan stick his head out and directly let Qin Shao chop.”

The two people each stuck to their own argument, neither giving in to the other.

Elder Tong’s side also fell into a dilemma for a while.

He thought about it and said, “Sword maneuvering flight has indeed never appeared before in life and death battles. Logically speaking, sword maneuvering flight is indeed Ye Yuan’s own strength, there’s no logic of placing restrictions. But Family Head Qin’s concerns are also not without reason. How about this, I’ll report this matter to the head elder and invite him to decide.”

“No need! I’ll only unleash one sword! If he can block it, I’ll admit defeat and take my own life!”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s voice sounded out.

Ye Yuan’s words immediately evoked a huge response.

Qin Nantian’s expression turned intent, and he immediately revealed a look of great joy.

While Chi Fang’s expression similarly turned intent, but his brows knitted tightly together.

“No way, right? Ye Yuan is also too arrogant, right? Even if he can fly on a sword, his realm is much worse than Qin Shao’s after all.”

“Regardless of whether it is realm or laws comprehension, Qin Shao reached the limits of Grotto Profound Realm. For Ye Yuan to want to win him, wouldn’t he need to have Heaven Glimpse Realm strength?”

“What kind of joke is this! Even if he comprehended sword maneuvering flight, it’s also impossible to reach Heaven Glimpse Realm strength, right?”

...

In everyone’s view, Ye Yuan saying so was simply conceited to the extreme.

Qin Shao’s strength, everyone was all aware. It could be said to be the strongest under Heaven Glimpse already.

Ye Yuan’s big talk was also boasted too ridiculously.

But Ye Yuan really did not have the intention of posturing. He only comprehended one move!

He was very confident in his move. If even this move could not deal with Qin Shao, he could only resign himself to fate.

“Since that’s the case, let’s start then!” After the surprise, Elder Tong opened his mouth and said.

“Only unleashes one sword? It looks like you’re really very confident in this sword of yours! Since that’s the case, then I won’t be courteous!”

His voice had yet to fade when Qin Shao’s powerful aura erupted with a loud bang. The realm oppression of half-step Heaven Glimpse blotted out the skies and covered the earth and crushed over towards Ye Yuan.

Clank!

The long sword came out of the sheath, cold light radiating everything!

“It’s Grand Chant Sword Void! Qin Shao he has actually been cultivating Grand Chant Sword Void all along! What a powerful power of laws!”

“Ye Yuan played it big this time! He probably never dreamed that Qin Shao had actually long cultivated one of the six supreme academy skills, Grand Chant Sword Void!”

“Heh, conceited people naturally have heaven to take in! A mere late-stage Grotto Profound actually dare tell Qin Shao that he was only unleashing one sword! I want to take a look at how he blocks this sword!”

...

The moment Qin Shao made his move, everyone immediately understood.

The Grand Chant Sword Void was the same as the Taiyi True Dipper Fist, one of Wu Meng Academy’s six supreme academy skills, its power immense!

Judging from his attack, this Grand Chant Sword Void was clearly already cultivated to the realm of grand completion first-level!

For a moment, the entire martial arena crisscrossed with sword energy. Powerful Sword Dao laws crushed over towards Ye Yuan.

“Fine sword! It wasn’t in vain for me to arrange a battle with you! Qin Shao, you didn’t disappoint me! Now, I’ll let you see the Chaos Heaven Opening Sword Art that I created in the Sword Tomb!”

Seeing Qin Shao’s powerful strength, Ye Yuan’s fighting intent was instantly ignited.

Ye Yuan comprehended for five years in the Sword Tomb. In these five years, he had no idea how many gouges sliced on his body, suffered how severe the injuries, and endured how much agony.

Now, he finally created a Sword Dao martial technique that belonged to him!

Ye Yuan named it the Chaos Heaven Opening Sword Art!

With Evil Extermination emerging, Ye Yuan pointed at the sky with his sword. A swift and fierce swift and fierce surged towards the sky!

Ye Yuan’s mouth lightly spat out two words, “Sundering ... Stars!”
