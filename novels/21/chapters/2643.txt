Chapter 2649: Heavenly South’s Number One Genius!

“Ge Ling, Fuxi Pure Yang Pill, peak sixth grade! Calm South City wins!”

When Cui Tong said this, his expression distinctly became somewhat unnatural.

Clearly, even he himself felt that it was inconceivable.

If one time, it could be said to be coincidental.

But the second time, Ge Ling overpowered Zuo Fang with his overwhelming talent, taking the top spot! It was not a coincidence anymore!

Just now, Cui Tong personally announced that Zuo Fang’s Nine Cauldron Grand Void Pill reached the level of upper sixth grade.

This was also to say that Zuo Fang performed to his highest standard this time!

But he still lost!

Peak sixth grade already reached the boundary of seventh grade, which was even higher than Zuo Fang’s result.

When Ge Ling himself heard this result, he felt rather incredulous too.

After the first match, he became a little more familiar with Ye Yuan’s guidance.

So the pill refinement this time, he became even more accomplished with high proficiency.

The result did not disappoint him.

“Won again! Really not a coincidence!”

“My God, this is also too miraculous! A grade two heavenly alchemist actually has the ability to turn stone into gold, making Master Ge have such a huge leap within such a short time.”

“Just what kind of person is that young man? Why have I never heard of him before?”

… …

Suddenly, Ye Yuan who was condescending and behaved like an idiot in their eyes became mysterious.

No one treated him as an ordinary Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum anymore.

Cui Tong three people’s gazes also looked over one after another.

Su Yi laughed loudly and said, “Sun Yunjing, you said that it was luck earlier? Ge Ling’s luck is really good!?Hahaha?…”

He was extremely proud of himself right now.

Each Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit, he would be the target of ridicule for the many city lords. Among them, Sun Yunjing was the worst.

Now, slapping faces over and over again made him feel like a freed slave singing songs.

That feeling of liberation really could not be described using words.

Seeing Su Yi’s smugful face, Sun Yunjing had an impulse to hit him.

But he was aggrieved currently!

How did Ge Ling become so formidable all of a sudden?

He could not figure it out after racking his brains!

“City Lord, please give me another chance! This time, I’ll definitely make Ge Ling that fellow knows my prowess!” Zuo Fang came before Sun Yunjing as he gnashed his teeth and said.

Clearly, he still did not give up.

He came from Heavenly South City and normally looked down on Ge Ling, this kind of barbarian most of all.

Now, he was actually surpassed by someone that he looked down upon. How could he stomach this frustration?

But Sun Yunjing was clearly not prepared to give him a chance anymore.

“Zuo Fang, you’ve worked hard too, rest for a bit. Leave the rest to Jiang Li,” Sun Yunjin said lightly.

“City Lord!” Zuo Fang said with unwillingness.

At this time, Jiang Li opened his mouth and said, “Zuo Fang, haven’t you discovered it yet? Ge Ling’s improvement this time is even greater than before! Although I don’t know how that boy did it, he indeed has the ability to transform the rotten into something magical! If my conjecture is right, Ge Ling’s pill refinement is very likely to break through to seventh grade the next time! At that time, you’ll lose even more miserably!”

Zuo Fang’s entire body trembled, and he fell silent.

Jiang Li patted his shoulder and said coolly, “Go rest. Leave the rest to me.”

Zuo Fang carried strong unwillingness and went to rest.

In the auction, Ge Ling’s Fuxi Pure Yang Pill was sold for a sky-high price of 600 thousand heavenly crystals, the highest of all present.

At this time, Jiang Li who was beside Sun Yunjing slowly stood up.

The moment he moved, it immediately caused a commotion.

“It’s Master Jiang Li! He’s finally taking the stage!”

“Master Jiang Li is known as Heavenly South City’s number one alchemy genius! Heard that even many grade four heavenly alchemists are not as impressive as him!”

“I didn’t expect that he was actually invited by Water Billow City. City Lord Sun definitely paid a huge price.”

… …

Seeing Jiang Li get up, Su Yi’s expression became ugly too.

Even Ge Ling also became fidgety.

Ye Yuan everyone’s nervousness and could not help being a little surprised.

“He’s very strong?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

Ge Ling nodded his head heavily and said, “Very strong! I stand no chance in front of him at all! Jiang Li is known as the Heavenly South’s number one genius. Although he’s still only a grade three heavenly alchemist now, in terms of strength, he’s already stronger than many grade four heavenly alchemists! I thought that he was just invited by City Lord Sun to hold the line. I didn’t expect that he actually personally took the stage! To put it bluntly, even if he sits on the judge bench, there also won’t be anyone complaining!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Jiang Li’s fame was extremely high. When he joined Water Billow City, it had once caused a great sensation.

No one would have thought that Heavenly South City’s number one genius actually joined the border Water Billow City.

Although each and every one of the grade three heavenly alchemists present all had high regards for themselves, they did not dare to be presumptuous in front of Jiang Li.

Ye Yuan just nodded slightly, thinking to himself that no wonder even Zuo Fang, this kind of arrogant person, went to rest obediently.

However, he did not really take it to heart either. No matter how strong Jiang Li, this number one genius, was, it was also impossible to be stronger than Cang Yongning.

Furthermore, even if he was really stronger than Cang Yongning, Ye Yuan did not mind either.

Calm South City’s win or loss had nothing to do with him.

Just now was just Sun Yunjing continuously squeezing him, that was why he took action.

Now that the other party had shut up, Ye Yuan was naturally not interested in taking action anymore too.

Who would have expected that Jiang Li turned around and actually came in front of Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Little Brother, are you interested in taking the stage to play?”

Buzz!

The whole audience was in a stir!

“Master Jiang Li actually challenged a grade two heavenly alchemist!”

“Isn’t this bullying people?”

“When Master Jiang Li refines grade two heavenly pills, it’s definitely all upper ninth grade. How to compete?”

… …

Although Ye Yuan was very mysterious, he was still utterly not worth mentioning in the face of Jiang Li’s prestige.

Jiang Li’s might was deeply entrenched in the hearts of people.

Ye Yuan could casually give pointers, but Jiang Li was an existence who could win grade four heavenly alchemists!

“Not interested!” Ye Yuan directly refused.

“Huhu,?looks like Little Brother only knows how to engage in empty talk. It was this Jiang who thought too highly of you,” Jiang Li was indifferent and said with a faint smile.

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said coolly, “You don’t need to goad me, I’m not accepting the challenge because you’re not worthy of making me take action.”

Murmur!

The whole audience was in an uproar!

This guy was simply too arrogant!

He probably did not know who Jiang Li was, right?

Jiang Li was considered level-headed too. But, hearing these words, his expression turned dark.

“Huhu,?brat, you’re also regarding yourself too highly, right? Even if a grade four heavenly alchemist is in front of me, they also wouldn’t dare say so!” Jiang Li said in a solemn voice.

“Grade four heavenly alchemist??Huhu,?if you want me to take action, can as well. But you have to be mentally prepared. If I make a move, your Water Billow City won’t have a chance anymore,” Ye Yuan said with a meaningful smile.

The words were full of disdain.

In Ye Yuan’s view, grade four heavenly alchemists were indeed nothing.

In the Pill Pavilion, when grade four heavenly alchemists saw him, they had to respectfully call him as Master Ye.

Jiang Li’s eyes turned cold and he said, “Is that so? I’m already mentally prepared. This Jiang wants to see how Water Billow City won’t have a chance!”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he shook his head. Slowly standing up, he said coolly, “If you want to see, I’ll let you take a look then.”
