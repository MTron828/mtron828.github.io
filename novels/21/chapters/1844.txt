Chapter 1848 What the Hell Happened?

“Young Patriarch, it’s not good!”Leng Hao was currently cultivating in closed-seclusion when the black-clothed man suddenly barged in.

The battle to determine the young patriarch was about to come to an end immediately, the black-clothed man observed his speech and countenance, and already quietly changed his term of address.

Sure enough, the moment Leng Hao heard, his mood immediately became much better.

“Mn? What’s going on?”

The black-clothed man said, “A few days ago, Leng Xu was still spending his days dispiritedly and indulging in excessive drinking every day. Since yesterday, someone saw him practicing the sword in the courtyard, seemingly very hardworking.”

The moment Leng Hao heard, he laughed disdainfully and said, “What is ten days of effort enough to do? No matter how he trains, he’s also not my match! You came to interrupt my cultivation for this matter?”

The black-clothed man was startled inwardly and said, “Young Master’s many years of hard work has already reached the most critical juncture. You mustn’t be careless!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Leng Hao’s brows furrowed. He thought about it and said, “Forget it, your reminder makes sense. There’s a bottle of Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder here, enough to make the person’s divine essence not circulate smoothly. You find an opportunity and let my good younger brother consume it. This battle, I want to beat him openly and uprightly!”

As he said, Leng Hao fished out a small bottle and passed it to the black-clothed man.

The Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder was colorless and tasteless. Even if one drank it, it would not be discovered either.

Only during the competition would flaws be revealed.

The black-clothed man smiled when he heard that and said, “Many years of long-cherished wish finally becoming real. This lowly one congratulates young patriarch in advance here!”

...

The ten-day period passed in a twinkle. On this day, many people gathered on the Leng Family’s practicing field.

The Leng Family’s disciples, family guards, even servants, all came to watch this battle of young patriarch.

“Heh, the superficiality of human relationships, the old family head passed away unexpectedly. Now, Leng Xu can’t even keep the position of young patriarch.”

“This battle is also just a formality. Leng Xu’s strength is not as good as Leng Hao’s to begin with.”

“If Leng Xu is sensible, he should have directly given up today.”

...

The fickleness of human nature was nothing more than this.

The old family head had already died for many years. Now, Leng Hao was akin to the noon-day sun. Everyone all knew that he was about to become the young patriarch. There naturally would not be anyone who would go and fawn on Leng Xu anymore.

In a large family clan like the Leng Family, human relationships were even colder.

Perhaps because he was about to become the young patriarch, Leng Hao seemed very enthusiastic. He had long arrived at the ring.

For this kind of important event, Leng Hongxiu as well as the Leng Family’s elders also all showed up one after another. Only Leng Xu failed to show up.

An elder was somewhat impatient from waiting and said with a cold snort, “Humph! This Leng Xu is also too outrageous, making so many of us elders wait for him alone! I think that he, this young patriarch, really don’t have a need to continue to be one anymore.”

“Leng Xu is too undisciplined and carefree. He’s normally not very respectful to elders. Speaking of which, Leng Hao this child is really not bad.”

The other few elders also seemed rather impatient and echoed in agreement.

When Leng Hao heard these elders’ discussion, he was pleased with himself inwardly.

These elders, he normally waited upon them nice and cozily. How was it condescending like Leng Xu, not paying any attention to the elders at all?

Hence, Leng Xu’s position of young patriarch also sent him onto the road to ruin.

Leng Hao smiled when he heard that and said, “This battle is very important. Young Brother Xu preparing longer is understandable. Hope that elders can be patient and wait a while longer.”

Leng Hao’s words immediately made the elders feel content.

Even Leng Hongxiu also could not nitpick any problem, secretly nodding his head.

Except, that celestial maiden-looking woman next to him furrowed her brows, appearing somewhat uncomfortable.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd, automatically opening up a path.

A handsome young man leaped lighting, jumping onto the ring.

He looked at Leng Hao and said with a faint smile, “It’s still Big Brother Hao who understands me. Such an important battle, how can I not prepare properly?”

The current Leng Xu, the decadence on his face was swept clean, his spirits soaring, like he gained a new lease on life.

When Leng Hao saw that faint smile of Leng Xu’s, he could not help being surprised in his heart.

In the past, what he saw in Leng Xu’s eyes was pain and decadence. But the Leng Xu today seemed to be different from in the past.

What the hell happened in these ten days?

Suddenly, his face changed and he said, “You actually broke through!”

Leng Xu nodded as he smiled and said, “Today’s opponent is Big Brother Leng Hao. So how can I not work harder?”

Seeing the surprise on Leng Hao’s face, a hint of delight flashed across in Leng Xu’s heart.

Today, he wanted everyone to know that he, Leng Xu, was the Leng Family’s number one genius!

This young patriarch, I don’t want it!

Of course, him being able to break through was naturally all thanks to Ye Yuan.

His realm was just initial-stage Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity. Originally, it was naturally impossible to break through so quickly. It was Ye Yuan’s void spirit divine pill that let him break through to middle-stage in a short ten days.

Leng Hao’s realm was late-stage Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity. This way, the gap between the two immediately narrowed significantly.

Although Leng Hao’s talent was pretty good, Leng Xu’s was clearly a notch higher. His law comprehension was stronger than Leng Hao’s!

Leng Hao’s expression was somewhat awkward as he smiled and said, “Haha, very good! However, my realm is still higher than yours, there’s absolutely no way that I lose to you!”

Leng Xu looked at Leng Hao and said with a calm smile, “Is that so? Big Brother Leng Hao, you’ve always been the big brother in my heart. You’re my goal to catch-up and surpass! And today, I’m going to catch-up from behind!”

He was not joking. Leng Hao’s strength indeed looked down on everyone among the Leng Family’s junior generation.

Otherwise, with his illegitimate identity, it was also impossible to be recognized as the young patriarch.

Leng Hao had always been an irreplaceable elder brother in Leng Xu’s heart. Hence, that was why he would be so decadent being edged out by Leng Hao.

A stalwart image crumbling in one’s heart, this blow was tremendous.

But under Ye Yuan’s help, he finally still got up.

Seeing that confident gaze of Leng Xu’s, Leng Hao sneered incessantly in his heart.

Leng Xu already drank the Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder, even if his realm broke through again, it was also useless!

This battle, it could only be him who won!

Leng Hongxiu smiled and said, “Since Xu-er has also come, then this battle for young patriarch begins.”

With the battle starting, sword energy immediately crisscrossed on the stage.

The two people were experts in the sword, law comprehensions were also both comprehended to rank five. The cultivation method that they cultivated was also pretty much the same.

However, the late-stage Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity Leng Hao actually could not gain any advantage over Leng Xu!

The more Leng Hao fought, the more alarmed he got. Leng Xu’s power of law also improved!

What the hell happened in these ten days?

Why did Leng Xu become like a different person from before?

Furthermore ... why didn’t the Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder show effect until now?

Leng Hao was practically going crazy in his heart!

“Big Brother Leng Hao, being absent-minded, you’ll lose!” Leng Xu said with a smile.

Leng Hao was startled inwardly, the force from his hands increasing a bit more.

But he was very puzzled. Why didn’t the Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder show effect until now?

“Is Big Brother Leng Hao waiting for the Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder to take effect? Don’t need to wait. I indeed drank the Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder, but ... the poison has already been detoxified!”

Right at this time, Leng Xu suddenly opened his mouth again.

Leng Hao was wildly shaken in his heart. The Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder’s poison was resolved!

How was this possible?
