1412 Bai Chen

After a long time, the milky-white light halo dissipated. Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes, his eyes revealing a look of excitement.

“It really worked!”

The current Ye Yuan already completely could not feel the Sky Foothill Heavenly Dao’s rejection any longer!

“You, how did you think of it? To actually think of using the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain to imitate the Sky Foothill Heavenly Dao’s aura!” Dustless exclaimed.

“Heh, small worlds are created by martial artists. Their Heavenly Dao is naturally born from the Heavenspan World’s Heavenly Dao too. Since that’s the case, the parent body imitating the child body’s aura shouldn’t be hard. Therefore, I tried communicating with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. Didn’t expect that it really worked,” Ye Yuan said with an excited look.

Dustless was speechless. This boy would frequently have some whimsical ideas. Even he was endlessly amazed.

This time, it clearly succeeded again until it shocked him.

With the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain protecting him, however vast this Sky Foothill World, it was free for him to roam!

Even if Origin Deity Realm powerhouses stood in front of him, they could not recognize him either.

Ye Yuan’s mind stirred, the Deity Realm powerhouse aura on his body gradually faded away.

Very soon, the Martial Dao aura on Ye Yuan’s body completely disappeared, looking just like an ordinary person.

Ye Yuan was confident that unless he encountered Origin Deity Realm powerhouses, otherwise, nobody could see through him.

Want to integrate into this world, it was better to be more low-profile.

Actually, the Sky Foothill World information grasped by Wu Meng Academy was not much. What Ye Yuan understood was very limited too.

Hence, he must first understand this world before he could know how to obtain the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone.

Finishing with this, Ye Yuan took a step and directly disappeared from where he stood.

In the forest, Ye Yuan seemed to be strolling idly in a courtyard. In reality, his speed was swift to the extreme!

Taking a step out, it was a thousand miles away.

“Mn?”

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly paused, stopping.

Arriving at the Sky Foothill World, his divine sense recovered to an extremely terrifying range again and already detected several figures ahead.

At the same time, Ye Yuan even detected that a deity realm fierce beast was currently coming in his direction.

“The fierce beast is in that direction! Teacher Mo Yun, this time, I can definitely personally capture that fierce beast and tame it! Don’t intervene today!” A young voice sounded out.

“Huhu, Mo Yun naturally believes in Young Lord Bai Chen’s strength! You just feel free to act. Not reaching the final juncture, I won’t intervene,” Mo Yun said with a light laugh.

He knew that this Young Lord Bai Chen enjoyed success at a young age and was very proud. Suffering major losses under the hands of this fierce beast repeatedly, he was very pent up.

However, Young Lord Bai Chen’s talent was indeed astonishing. In less than a year’s time, Young Lord Bai Chen already became much stronger under this fierce beast’s stimulation.

Although he was still not that fierce beast’s match yet currently, defeating it alone was already something sooner or later.

“Teacher Mo Yun, this time, you absolutely mustn’t be like last time, repelling it when I only suffered a bit of injury! Otherwise, I’ll really fall out!” Bai Chen said unhappily.

“Haha, Young Lord rest assured, I definitely won’t this time! Unless it concerns life and death, I absolutely won’t take action!” Mo Yun laughed and said.

“Come on, Young Lord! You can definitely defeat that fierce beast this time!”

“Young Lord is mighty!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Young Lord is mighty!”

...

Several accompanying martial artists were all cheering Bai Chen on.

Bai Chen smiled proudly and rushed over in the fierce beast’s direction.

“Roar!”

When Bai Chen rushed over, the fierce beast was currently roaring madly in Ye Yuan’s direction, the commotion extremely terrifying.

Originally, the dense woods blocked the view. Only when Bai Chen came near, did he discover that there was a young man standing there.

And the fierce beast was currently baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, assuming a posture about to pounce at Ye Yuan.

“Don’t move! Leave this guy to me!”

Bai Chen shouted loudly, his figure dashing towards that fierce best like lightning.

That was a lion-type fierce beast. Ye Yuan did not recognize it.

Although this species of fierce beast was extremely strong, it was not civilized and did not belong to the category of the demon race.

Bai Chen had an imposing momentum, brandished a divine artifact heavy spear, and clashed together with the fierce beast.

The moment he got started, Bai Chen thoroughly suppressed the fierce beast.

With this, he pressed on relentlessly, one spear following another, fighting until the fierce beast fell back repeatedly.

When Bai Chen saw this, he had an even more excited look, growing in bravery as he fought.

While at this time, Mo Yun and the rest also passed through the dense forest and arrived here.

When they discovered Ye Yuan, they all could not help being stunned.

Before this, they all sensed two powerful auras. They were precisely from Bai Chen and the fierce beast.

Apart from these two, they completely did not sense other people’s auras.

Did not expect that there was actually still a person here ... an ordinary person.

Mo Yun’s gaze sized up Ye Yuan. But no matter how he sized up, Ye Yuan was an ordinary person.

Boom!

Right at this time, a heavy spear of Bai Chen’s knocked the fierce beast over.

When those followers saw this scene, they immediately applauded.

“Good!”

“Young Lord Bai Chen, beautifully done!”

“Continue, Young Lord! Kill it!”

...

When these people saw that Ye Yuan was just an ordinary person, they directly ignored him.

Reckon that this guy was long frightened silly by the fierce beast, right?

Only Mo Yun’s brows furrowed slightly seemingly pondering about something.

Bai Chen’s attack succeeding, he gave even less of a chance for the fierce beast to catch its breath. One spear followed another, very quickly beating the fierce beast until it did not have the strength to retaliate.

Boom ...

Bai Chen gasped heavily for air, pounding the heavy spear on the ground. A golden collar appeared in his hands at no idea when.

“Summon!”

Bai Chen muttered words under his breath, then threw the collar. The collar slipped onto the fierce beast’s neck.

The fierce beast already did not have the strength to resist and could only helplessly watch Bai Chen’s action, with its eyes revealing a look of despair.

“Leave it to you guys!”

Bai Chen roared loudly to the entourage, but he then turned to Ye Yuan, patted his shoulders, and said with a smile, “Kid, scared silly, right? Just now, if this young master, I, came a bit later, you’d have become a meal in this guy’s belly!”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Many thanks for Young Lord Bai Chen’s life-saving grace.”

It was just that he had a calm and collected appearance. How was it at all like being scared silly?

But Ye Yuan did not say much, going along with things.

Bai Chen did not put on much air, waved his hands, and said, “No need, no need, just a simple matter not worth mentioning! But your guts are really plucky. This Wilderness Forest is full of danger. Even Deity Realm powerhouses don’t dare to easily set foot inside. You actually dared to come here by yourself.”

Ye Yuan smiled and did not dispute further.

Bai Chen put away the fierce beast and was in a great mood, saying to Ye Yuan again, “Forget this, this young lord’s mood today is pretty good, I’ll bring you out together!”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “Then I’ll have to thank Young Lord Bai Chen very much.”

“Haha, you, kid, are really lucky! Running into Young Lord Bai Chen coming out to train today! Otherwise, you wouldn’t even have bones left!”

“When you exit the Wilderness Forest, you have to thank Young Lord Bai Chen properly.”

“It’s also Young Lord Bai Chen who is kind-hearted. If it were others, they wouldn’t even be bothered with you!”

Those followers all came in front of Ye Yuan to poke fun, all feeling that Ye Yuan survived by a fluke.
