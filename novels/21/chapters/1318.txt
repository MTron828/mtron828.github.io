Chapter 1322: Overbearingly Blocking the Path

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The three of you, come here!” A guard looking martial artist was shouting to the three martial artists who were about to enter the Yin Wind Den.

Those three martial artists’ expressions changed. The martial artist in the lead said unhappily, “What for?”

The guard shouted coldly, “The three of you, put your palms on it!”

“Humph! Who the hell are you all? You ask us to put, and we’ll put?”

“If you don’t put, then we’ll help you put!”

“What a joke! The three of us brothers had entered this Yin Wind Den no less than a hundred times already, and had never seen before such a rude request! Who the hell are you guys, to actually dare be so arrogant?”

“Who we are, you all don’t need to care. Just comply, that will do!”

“Then what if ... we don’t do it?”

...

Before long, those three people obediently put their palms on that instrument.

Very soon, the instrument gave off a green light.

The guard shot the three of them a cold glance and said, “Scram, if you did it long ago, wouldn’t you have dispensed with physical pain?”

The three people did not dare to refute, leaving angrily.

At this time, over ten people were gathered outside the Yin Wind Den, like a checkpoint was set up.

All who wanted to enter the Yin Wind Den must go through that instrument’s check.

This group of guards was naturally the Wang Family’s men after changing attires.

Such overbearing actions, they naturally did not dare admit that they were members of the Wang Family.

“Second Brother, is this method reliable? What if that boy sees our line-up and gets frightened away?” Wang Yugan asked Wang Yutao.

Wang Yutao said coolly, “Relax, Yumin cut off his way back. Unless he doesn’t want the Night Twill Grass, otherwise, he definitely has to enter the Yin Wind Den. The first time that boy did when he left seclusion was to find a land of dead spirits. This shows that this place is very important to him, he’ll definitely come.”

Wang Yugan said, “I’m worried, no idea what kind of reaction Yang Rui will have if he knows about this matter.”

Wang Yutao laughed coldly and said, “Heh, if he’s already dead, what reaction can he have? Put your heart back into your stomach. We arranged many hidden sentries along the way, and that boy got two Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard as mounts from no idea where and is already headed over here. But ... that kid is indeed quite troublesome. Our hidden sentries had just discovered him and were already disposed of.”

Wang Yugan deeply felt that way too and said, “Yeah, I also didn’t think that not only is that kid a master of alchemy, but he’s also even a martial arts expert! If not for his realm being too low, I probably couldn’t see Second Brother anymore.”

Thinking about it now, Wang Yugan also felt lingering fear.

Luo Jian’s and Ye Yuan’s might greatly exceeded his imaginations.

At that time, he knew that he most likely could not take care of these two people by himself, that was why he would seek help from the family.

Wang Yutao came over very quickly and even brought the auxiliary-model profound divine artifact, a spectroscope.

This spectroscope was able to identify the martial artist’s divine soul. As long as there was an item that the other party used before, it would do.

This thing was naturally out of fear that Ye Yuan would change his looks and slip by.

...

Behind a pile of debris, two people’s heads were ducked down.

Luo Jian’s expression was solemn as he said, “The Wang Family laid down an inescapable net, just waiting for us to collide onto the spear tip! Didn’t expect that even the spectroscope was deployed!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “In order to kill me, the Wang Family actually brought out such a massive line-up, truly thinking highly of this Ye.”

Luo Jian looked at Ye Yuan’s indifferent expression and could not help saying gloomily, “You can still smile! The hidden sentries that we disposed of along the way were already seven or eight of them. I reckon that they should have guessed that we’ve already arrived here.”

Speaking of this, Luo Jian was impressed by Ye Yuan to the max.

Along the way, all of the hidden sentries were all discovered by Ye Yuan. No matter how concealed those people hid, they all could not escape Ye Yuan’s arcane sights.

This guy was simply a freak!

If not for the case, the Wang Family would probably wait here in hopes that a hare would kill itself by crashing into a tree trunk, but directly go over to encircle and suppress.

It was precisely because they finished off those hidden sentries that they were able to secretly lay low in the vicinity of the Yin Wind Den.

“Huhu, why can’t I smile? I’m really not scared of things blowing up! Since they came to kill me, they’ll have to be prepared to be counter-killed by me!” Ye Yuan said with a laugh.

“Counter-kill? Are you joking?! Last time was Wang Yugan not being prepared, that’s how we succeeded. This time, he even called over Wang Yutao. That Wang Yutao’s strength is even a notch above Wang Yugan’s! Ye Yuan, we’d better return to Jewelhill City and seek help from Tower Lord!”

Along the way, Luo Jian himself also did not become conscious that his words with Ye Yuan became more and more.

He was still that callous Luo Jian. But facing Ye Yuan, he could not be unfeeling no matter what.

The brotherhood established after sharing life and death was so miraculous.

Hearing Luo Jian’s words, Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “It’s too late! Moreover, returning for help now, it will definitely be what the Wang Family hopes for! If my conjectures are right, the way back is long cut off by them already.”

Being cut off was not the main point, the main point was that Ye Yuan really could not afford to delay.

Originally, there were less than three months’ time left. Now, one and a half months had already been used up along the way, and only a month’s time was left.

This to and fro, he could afford to wait, but Mu Lingxue could not.

Luo Jian’s expression changed, and he said, “So ... what then?”

Ye Yuan said, “Your injuries are not yet fully healed. Find a place to hide and wait outside for me. I’ll go in alone!”

“Absolutely not! Putting aside that you can’t clear the Wang Family, that hurdle, even if you clear it, the evil spirits inside are also not what you can deal with! I know that your strength is much stronger than it looks on the surface, but the evil spirits in this Yin Wind Den are far stronger than you imagine!” Luo Jian immediately rejected this suggestion.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, could it be that I’ll send myself to death? Rather, you believe that a traitor arose in the Myriad Treasure Tower now, right?”

Luo Jian’s expression was incomparably ugly. He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s words really hit the mark.

Want to utilize the spectroscope, there must be an item that the person used day-to-day. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Very clearly, if there wasn’t the Myriad Treasure Tower’s internal staff, this spectroscope had no way to be used at all.

Being able to obtain Ye Yuan’s and Luo Jian’s day-to-day items, this person’s position in the Myriad Treasure Tower was quite high!

Luo Jian gritted his teeth and said, “If I find out who it is, I’ll definitely tear him limb from limb!”

Luo Jian was a straightforward type, facing opponents, he could throw his life.

But, if he was stabbed in the back by his own, he would really be aggrieved to the extreme.

Originally, this trip could have been calm and tranquil, who would have expected that so many unforeseen events would be added.

If not for Ye Yuan, he would already be a dead man now.

Ye Yuan patted his shoulder and said with a smile, “Relax, you’ll definitely have a chance! When we return to the Myriad Treasure Tower, we’ll naturally have to settle this score properly! I’m going!”

Luo Jian raised his head and looked, his pupils involuntarily shrunk.

He discovered that the flesh on Ye Yuan’s face gave off a series of bizarre transformation, and he actually became another person.

At the same time, Ye Yuan’s entire disposition also underwent a massive transformation, about the same as those martial artists who entered the Yin Wind Den.
