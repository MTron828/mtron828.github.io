Chapter 2115: Qilin Arrives

The youth was taken aback. At this time, Long Xiaochun already walked out from the back-hall, using murderous eyes to look at Ye Yuan.

“Ye Yuan, I trusted you! But you actually betrayed me!” Long Xiaochun said angrily.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Little girl, running away from home, your family will be worried. You saying that you thank me for killing Qi Zhen shows that you really love your big brother. Then how can you bear to make him worry?”

Long Xiaochun was stunned, revealing a thoughtful expression.

By the side, Long Xiaohai was already shocked speechless.

He looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief and said, “You ... You killed Qi Zhen? How is this possible?”

A True God Realm killed an Empyrean Realm?

Long Xiaohai felt that this guy must be bragging.

Long Xiaochun held her head with her hand and revealed a furious appearance from failing to live up to expectations as she said, “You stupid big brother! This matter already caused a great sensation in the entire city, but you actually don’t know! He’s called Ye Yuan, the Second Sage personally conferred by Sacred Ancestor High Priest! He’s amazing!”

Shock was written all over Long Xiaohai’s face. Clearly, his brain could not quite wrap itself around it.

“S-Second Sage?”

He truly did not expect that this young man before his eyes actually had such a great background.

Long Xiaochun could not be bothered with Long Xiaohai’s shock and turned to Ye Yuan and said with the appearance of a little grown-up, “Uh ... I feel that what you said is very reasonable, but I finally managed to come out. Yet he wouldn’t let me go here, wouldn’t let me go there either. I could only sneak out.”

This Long Xiaochun stayed too long in the pseudo world and was filled with curiosity toward the outside world.

But along the way, Long Xiaohai refused to let her go anywhere. She was naturally very depressed. Hence, she secretly ran off halfway.

Long Xiaohai only came a few days later in order to find Long Xiaochun, so he did not hear the matter of Ye Yuan killing Qi Zhen.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Your big brother is worried about your safety too. That’s why he didn’t let you move around, isn’t that so?”

Long Xiaochun thought about it and nodded her head, but then she shook her head again and said, “I’m very amazing!”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Those who come are guests. Since you all came, sit down and drink a cup of wine.”

“Yay, yay! I love drinking wine the most!” Long Xiaochun said with an excited look.

A few cups of wine down the belly, Long Xiaochun was already slightly tipsy.

But her pretty face was glowing red, looking freaking adorable.

Long Xiaochun chirped away. Long Xiaohai also finally understood who Ye Yuan was. But he became even more shocked in his heart.

This young man was actually so incredible!

He had fought with Qi Zhen before and knew about Qi Zhen’s alchemy strength and even more about his pride.

But Qi Zhen actually did not even have the courage to make a move facing Ye Yuan!

Feeling an itch to test his skill, Long Xiaohai even wanted to spar with Ye Yuan a little. The result was naturally being abused until he was black and blue all over.

This way, Long Xiaohai admired Ye Yuan even more.

He finally knew why Qi Zhen did not even have the courage to make a move.

Long Xiaochun watched with great relish by the side, idolizing Ye Yuan to the extreme.

Long Xiaohai was also an alchemy fanatic, discussing in-depth with Ye Yuan for three days and three nights before being fully satisfied.

“Sigh, it’s getting late. Elder Xun they all must be worried sick from waiting. Otherwise, I’d really want to consult Brother Ye for a few months more,” Long Xiaohai said with a look of regret.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No worries. As long as you guys are willing, you can come to find me at any time.”

Long Xiaohai was pleasantly surprised when he heard that and said, “Brother Ye, is this for real?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I feel very congenial with your brother and sister two people. Looking at you guys is like seeing my kin, I naturally won’t refuse.”

Long Xiaochun nodded repeatedly and said, “Yeah, yeah, it’s true, I also have this kind of feeling! The first time I laid eyes on you, it’s like seeing a big brother.”

After some small talk, the two people took their leave.

Before long, Long Xiaochun even repeatedly urged Ye Yuan, “You have to remember. If the Qilin Clan dares to bully you, just report my name!”

Ye Yuan just brushed it off with a smile and naturally did not take it seriously.

... ...

Three days later, an aura powerful until it made people asphyxiated instantly enveloped the entire city.

At this moment, two words flashed across the minds of everyone: Heavenly Emperor!

This powerful aura akin to a god, only Heavenly Emperor powerhouses in the legends could possess it.

“This emperor is the Qilin Clan’s Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun! Give you all a hundred breaths of time! Hand over the chief criminal, Ye Yuan; otherwise, the whole city will be annihilated!”

A voice akin to a clap of thunder sounded out in the ears of every demon in the city.

The demon race powerhouses in the city were all ashen pale. Those who were slightly weaker were even injured by this voice.

“Heavenly Emperor powerhouse! It actually really drew a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!”

“Damn it! It’s all Lord Second Sage’s fault! Showing off momentary bravery, what to do now?”

“At this time, Lord Second Sage should sacrifice himself to protect the entire demon race!”

... ...

There were discussions everywhere in the city.

Ye Yuan’s residence was nearby, there were many demon race powerhouses yelling and hurling insults.

Suddenly, an angry voice sounded out, “All get lost for this empyrean!”

Everyone looked over, it was actually Empyrean Xin Luo!

“When the group of demon powerhouses saw Xin Luo, they immediately exploded.

“Lord Xin Luo, you have to stand up for us!”

“He, Second Sage, can’t make the entire city be buried in death with him because of his individual grudge.”

... ...

The pressure that a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse brought to people was seriously too strong.

At the moment of life and death, whatever Second Sage, whatever alchemy genius, it was all useless.

Xin Luo had a grim expression as he said coldly, “All shut up for this empyrean! This empyrean came to request Lord Second Sage to uphold justice for us!”

The moment everyone heard, their faces immediately revealed excited looks.

Uphold justice? Xin Luo’s meaning was handing Ye Yuan over.

Xin Luo arrived in front of the door and said in a clear voice, “Xin Luo requests an audience with Lord Second Sage!”

Creak!

The front door slowly opened. A white-robed youth slowly walked out.

When Xin Luo saw Ye Yuan, he was just about to open his mouth to speak, but then he heard Ye Yuan say coolly, “Don’t need to waste your breath anymore. I already said before on that day at the divine temple. This matter, I’ll shoulder it alone!”

Xin Luo could not help being stunned when he heard that. The words that Ye Yuan said back then, he thought that it was just joking around.

For this, he even laid down an all-encompassing net in the vicinity, afraid of Ye Yuan escaping.

However, not only did Ye Yuan not escape, he actually really stepped up right now!

Xin Luo even thought that he had to use force this time, who knew that Ye Yuan was so sensible.

Could it be that when he killed Qi Zhen, he already prepared to pay with his life long ago?

But no matter what, Ye Yuan himself being willing to go was naturally for the best.

Otherwise, a charge of being disrespectful toward Second Sage could not be avoided.

If Sacred Ancestor High Priest were to really demand accountability, he would definitely be that scapegoat.

Xin Luo gave Ye Yuan a bow and said, “Lord Second Sage understands the righteousness of a cause. Xin Luo admires Lord Second Sage.”

Ye Yuan looked at Xin Luo and said with a cold smile, “Stop putting on an appearance here. You arranged so many spies in the vicinity, do you really think that I don’t know? If this sage really wanted to leave, do you think that you can stop me based on these people?”

When Xin Luo heard that, he could not help revealing a look of surprise.

The spies that he arranged were all Empyrean powerhouses. Ye Yuan actually knew all about it?

Not waiting for him to react, Ye Yuan already took a step out and arrived above the void.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
