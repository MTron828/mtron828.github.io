Chapter 2552: Highly Popular!

“If you can really refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill, it will mean that your strength is above this nation teacher’s! So what if I let you be the nation teacher?” Lin Lan said with a cold smile.

There was a gap of 108,000 miles between the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill and the Jasper Regeneration Pill.

As a grade two heavenly alchemist, he was also unable to refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill to this day. This was sufficient to indicate a problem.

It was true that Ye Yuan’s talent was strong, but what he displayed just now, he had clearly already reached his limit.

This indicated that the shortcoming of affinity still had an impact on Ye Yuan.

Furthermore, it was not small!

Wanting to refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill within a short five years was simply a fool’s talk!

Being enraged, Lin Lan just wanted to doom Ye Yuan to death.

Therefore, he bet with Ye Yuan again!

The two made an origin divinity contract, stunning everyone present.

This Ye Yuan really desired to see the world plunged into chaos!

“Huhu,?Lord Nation Teacher, thank you very much for your generosity!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Lin Lan sneered and said, “You just pray that you don’t end up in this nation teacher’s hands!”

Finished talking, Lin Lan left with the large group of troops.

A ransacking operation on a grand and spectacular scale actually ended in such a manner, making people’s jaws drop.

Tang Yu father and son stumbled their way in front of Ye Yuan. Tang Yu said gratefully, “Thank you very much, Big Brother!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You already called me as you big brother, how can I ignore the Tang Family’s affairs? Alright, you are already injured until like this. Hurry up and go back and nurse your injuries!”

But Tang Yu did not leave, having an appearance of wanting to speak but swallowing the words back.

Ye Yuan knew what he meant and said smilingly, “You’re worried that I can’t refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill?”

Tang Yu was a little embarrassed and nodded slightly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, a mere Jasper Regeneration Pill, how can it stump me, Ye Yuan?”

Lu Yun came up and said, “Young Friend Ye, you’re also treating it too trivially! This Jasper Regeneration Pill, even grade two heavenly alchemists can’t refine it. I’m afraid that it’s unrealistic for you to want to refine it within five years!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Grade two heavenly alchemist? Wasn’t that grade two heavenly alchemist just defeated at my hands too?”

Everyone exchanged glances and could not help being speechless.

… …

“What did you say?! Nation Teacher … lost? This … How is this possible?” When Eldest Prince heard the news, he was shocked until he jumped up.

This news was seriously too shocking.

When his subordinate recounted the process, Eldest Prince was speechless for a long time. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

How much thought and effort had he expended before getting Nation Teacher to take action against the Tang Family?

In the end, Nation Teacher actually suffered a crushing defeat!

Before this, Eldest Prince was extremely proud of himself with regards to this hand of cards.

In this imperial city, who else could save someone from under Nation Teacher’s hands?

Yet, Nation Teacher was defeated!

Defeated so thoroughly!

The plan that he expended countless efforts to make was ruined just like that.

Eldest Prince waved his hand and chased everyone out.

A gray-robed old man walked out from behind the curtain.

Eldest Prince let out a sigh and said, “Forget it! At any rate, Nation Teacher clashed with Old Second! It’s simply impossible for that Ye Yuan to win this five-year agreement! At that time, take care of Old Second again! Master Yu, wonder what’s your opinion about it?”

This gray-robed old man was called Huang Zhaoyu, Eldest Prince’s master.

Rather than saying this battle for the throne was the struggle between Eldest Prince and Second Prince, might as well say that it was the battle of magics between these two Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratums.

Huang Zhaoyu said, “Five-year agreement, it’s naturally good if Nation Teacher that side can win. But you have to keep other cards in reserve too!”

Eldest Prince said in surprise, “Master Yu, this is impossible, right? A one point heavenly alchemist is indeed incredibly shocking. But there’s no comparison between the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill and Jasper Regeneration Pill at all! The Jasper Regeneration Pill is something that even Nation Teacher can’t refine.”

Huang Zhaoyu smiled and said, “Before this, wasn’t there no one who thought that Ye Yuan could win too? But what about the final result?

Eldest Prince choked and actually had nothing to say in reply.

Huang Zhaoyu said, “If you want that position of emperor, you have to consider everything that you do! It isn’t that you can sleep in peace after becoming emperor! Eastward Country isn’t an otherworldly paradise, there are powerful enemies casting covetous eyes all around, and there’s also the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, this leviathan above it. A single misstep and it will be the outcome of the country being ruined and the home lost! Do you think that becoming the emperor is so easy? These few years, which day was His Majesty not wary with extreme caution, akin to treading on thin ice? Otherwise, how would the two of you have this chance to compete for this position of emperor?”

Eldest Prince’s eyes sank slightly, immediately feeling a strong pressure.

Indeed, compared to Royal Father, they were still much more inexperienced.

He gave a bow toward Huang Zhaoyu and said, “Master Yu, please give guidance!”

Huang Zhaoyu nodded and said, “I don’t think that Ye Yuan can win either. But this Ye Yuan isn’t simple! How cunning is old man Lu Yun? How could he make a losing proposition? Don’t you forget what their bet is! If, I say if, that Ye Yuan really wins, he might very likely become the nation teacher! A heavenly alchemist who can refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill, even His Majesty isn’t willing to offend either!”

Eldest Prince’s pupils constricted, he really had not thought about this possibility.

If Master Yu’s words came true, then he would be in danger!

“Master Yu, this …” Eldest Prince said nervously.

Huang Zhaoyu said, “So, the first thing that you have to do now, is to investigate this Ye Yuan! The more detailed, the better! Only by knowing yourself and the enemy, can you fight a hundred battles without danger of defeat!”

Eldest Prince deeply felt that way too and nodded in response and said, “Then what about the second thing?”

Huang Zhaoyu said, “Those few from the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect have already become overlords! Even if you ascend to the throne in the future, you won’t be able to bypass them too! If they don’t nod their heads, you have no chance! Therefore, you must forge a good relationship with them! With their support, even His Majesty has to think thrice too! Only then, will there be no danger of anything going wrong!”

Eldest Prince’s eyes became brighter and brighter, having a feeling of dispelling the clouds and seeing the bright moon!

… …

The news of Nation Teacher being defeated instantly swept across the entire city!

Nation Teacher was defeated!

Nation Teacher actually lost to an ascender!

Furthermore, it was even an ascender who only had one point affinity!

This incident was seriously too explosive.

The entire imperial city was discussing this matter.

“You guys don’t know this, but everyone treated that ascender as a clown! But in the end, when the Cloud Mount Mother Stone determined his pill as seventh grade, everyone was stunned!”

“Is it real or not? Is a one point affinity really so incredible?”

“Absolutely true! So many people saw it, can it still be fake??Heh,?middle seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill! The Tang Family is going to rise up! Just based on a Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, the Tang Family can overwhelm all the families in the imperial city!”

“Now that you said this, I really have to go to the Tang Family to take a look!”

… …

In the main streets and alleyways, this scene could be seen everywhere.

A one point heavenly alchemist was an extremely sensational thing in itself.

Coupled with seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, plus Nation Teacher Lin Lan’s crushing defeat, bowing in apology, it would cause a stir even if you did not want it to!

The Tang Family became the most popular family all at once.

The Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill that Ye Yuan refined became the most popular heavenly pill in the entire city!

Each one was sold at a sky-high price!
