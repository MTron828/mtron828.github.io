Chapter 1709 Shielding Heaven“s Secrets

“Huhu, looks like Junior came in time. Lucky that Senior hasn’t broken through. Otherwise, the backlash of Heavenly Dao will make your eyes more serious and I’d be powerless to do anything as well,” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

Jian Zhentao’s entire body trembled and he said, “W-What do you mean?”

Ye Yuan said, “Coming this time, it’s firstly to request help from Senior. Secondly ... it’s naturally to help Senior treat your eyes as well.”

Jian Zhentao said in surprise, “You mean that ... this old man’s eyes actually still have hope of restoring sight?”

Heavenly Dao’s backlash was Heavenly Dao’s punishment to martial artists. It was naturally impossible to heal easily.

Jian Zhentao had long given up hope, so his entire person became open-minded too.

It was also because of this that his mind became illuminated and touched that layer of fleeting and ephemeral Heavenly Dao instead.

Originally, with Jian Zhentao’s talent, it was very hard to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm.

But now, Ye Yuan told him that his eyes had hope of restoring sight again. This made his long motionless heart stir up ripples once more.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The last time, at Riverluck Capital City, Ye Yuan did not know whether I could break through to rank four or not. My divine essence wasn’t sufficient to support applying acupuncture. So I didn’t mention it to senior.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Zhentao said excitedly, “In that case, you already broke through now? No wonder, wonder when I felt your aura, it’s somewhat different. I really didn’t expect it! Really didn’t expect it! This old man’s eyes actually still have hope of seeing the light again!”

Jian Zhentao’s strength was much stronger than Jian Ping. So his backlash was naturally much more severe than Jian Ping’s.

Even if it was Ye Yuan, he had to go through a great deal of trouble before he let Jian Zhentao see the light anew.

When Jian Zhentao opened his eyes, his eyeballs regained their liveliness once more.

Everything returned to the past!

Jian Zhentao looked at Ye Yuan gratefully and said, “These 200 years, this old man thought that I’ve long been at ease. Didn’t expect ... when this day arrives, this old man is still unable to keep calm! Little Friend Ye Yuan, thank you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior is too serious. Your eyes were originally due to Ye Yuan. How can Ye Yuan look on with folded arms.”

Jian Zhentao shook his head and said, “This old man looking at you with the aura viewing art, that was this old man’s problem, how can it be blamed on you? There’s no such logic! Oh, right, what did you come to find this old man for?”

Mentioning this, Ye Yuan controlled his expression and became solemn.

Ye Yuan said the purpose of his trip, but Jian Zhentao’s brows knitted together.

When Ye Yuan saw Jian Zhentao’s expression, he could not help having a foreboding premonition in his heart and could not resist asking, “Senior, is ... there any difficulty here?”

Jian Zhentao smiled bitterly and said, “Come, this old man will divine for you. You’ll understand!”

Ye Yuan had a puzzled look. It was only to see Jian Zhentao take out several copper coins.

These coppers coins were naturally not ordinary items but made with special materials.

Ye Yuan looked over, they were actually a set of divine lord mystic treasure!

Jian Zhentao slowly mustered up the Profound Spirit Chaos Formula and injected divine essence into the copper coins.

Very soon, a series of dense vapor curled upwards. The entire house was filled with a mysterious aura.

Ye Yuan was secretly alarmed. Jian Zhentao taking action was indeed extraordinary.

Zhang Haotian’s divination was considered pretty good already. But in front of Jian Zhentao, it was completely not enough to look at!

However, when Ye Yuan saw this situation, he also faintly looked forward to it, hoping that Jian Zhentao could help him find Li-er their news.

However, the results turned out contrary to his expectations.

Crack!

“Puhwark!”

Right at this time, a crisp sound echoed. Those few copper coins actually directly snapped!

While Jian Zhentao himself spewed out a large mouthful of blood, dyeing his chest red.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed greatly and he hurriedly went up to support Jian Zhentao and said, “Senior, this ... what’s going on?”

Jian Zhentao waved his hand, indicating that he was fine. He said with a bitter smile, “Sure enough, like I thought!”

Ye Yuan’s expression was ugly to the extreme as he said, “Senior, what’s going on?”

Jian Zhentao said, “The more exuberant one’s destiny, the higher the requirement of the person performing the divination too! Little Friend Ye Yuan, your destiny is too exuberant. It’s very likely the legendary imperial aura. Everything regarding you is a mystery! Your destiny shielded heaven’s secrets, there’s no way of prying into it at all. Otherwise, this old man also wouldn’t have received a backlash from Heavenly Dao with one glance. This divination is naturally the same principle too.”

Ye Yuan’s heart plunged fiercely to rock-bottom.

If it was like this, in the sea of faces, where should he go to find people?

An emotion called despair rose in Ye Yuan’s heart.

“Senior, this ... could it be that there’s no other way?” Ye Yuan said unwillingly.

Jian Zhentao said, “Your situation, there’s probably only inviting the pavilion lord to personally take action! It’s just that ...”

Ye Yuan was overjoyed when he heard that and said, “Senior, can the pavilion lord divine it?”

Jian Zhentao nodded and said, “Pavilion Lord’s cultivation method understands the mystery of good fortune. His attainments in augury are exceedingly accomplished. If he’s willing to take action, there is some hope.”

Ye Yuan was overjoyed and said, “As long as I can invite the pavilion lord to take action, Ye Yuan is willing to pay any price.”

Jian Zhentao slowly nodded and said, “Forget it, I’ll go and give it a try.”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Many thanks, Senior! I’ll help you treat your injuries first!”

Toward Jian Zhentao, Ye Yuan was still very grateful in his heart.

Just now, Jian Zhentao had clearly long expected the result, but he was afraid that he would feel that he was brushing him off, and still help him to divine.

In the end, even the divine lord mystic treasure was broken, and he even sustained injuries.

This friendship, Ye Yuan had no choice but to accept it.

Treating Jian Zhentao, he brought Ye Yuan to the Profound Secrets Pavilion.

When people saw Jian Zhentao, each and every one of them was extremely shocked.

“This ... Isn’t this Elder Jian Zhentao? His eyes are actually healed!”

“Truly inconceivable! Suffering Heavenly Dao’s backlash and already became a cripple. Who is so formidable, to actually be able to cure his eyes?”

“Heh heh, there’s something worth watching now! Elder Jian Zhentao returning domineeringly, the Profound Secrets Pavilion is going to get lively again.”

...

Because Jian Zhentao’s two eyes were already crippled and he was certain to become a cripple, that was why he would leave and live in seclusion.

Being unable to use the aura viewing art was equivalent to a cripple in the Profound Secrets Pavilion.

“Jian Zhentao, what did you come to the Profound Secrets Pavilion for? Mn? Your eyes ... can see?”

At this time, an old man suddenly appeared in front, blocking the three people’s path.

But when he saw that Jian Zhentao’s eyes actually regained sight, he turned pale with fright.

Jian Zhentao looked at the arrival and said with a cold smile, “Yeah, Jian Shaoning. You’re very disappointed, right?”

Clearly, the two were on very bad terms.

Back then, when Jian Zhentao went blind, it was Jian Shaoning who did his best to suppress and squeeze him out of the elder’s association.

Now, Jian Zhentao actually returned domineeringly, how could he not be alarmed?

Jian Shaoning’s expression changed, and he said with a cold snort, “Did you forget the Profound Secrets Pavilion’s rules? What’s the deal with bringing two strangers here?”

“Elder Senior Brother!” Right at this time, another voice sounded out.

Ye Yuan turned his head to look, who was it if not Jian Ping?

Truly, enemies met on a narrow path!
