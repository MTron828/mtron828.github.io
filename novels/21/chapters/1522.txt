1526 Some Experience

So angry!

The Blood Yama Hall went through great pains and expended countless material things to actually benefit a human?

Di En and Heavenstar exchanged a glance, virtually about to break down.

Suddenly, Heavenstar’s gaze turned to look at Di Fan and said viciously, “You said that he’s currently breaking through right now?”

Di Fan nodded and said, “That’s right! He entered the Selfless Realm and directly broke through the human race’s Origin Deity Realm bottleneck. That’s how the clue appeared.”

When Heavenstar heard this, he seethed with killing intent and said, “What a terrific human race lad, to actually dare toy with this old man in the palm of your hand! This old man will see how you see!”

Finished talking, Heavenstar directly took out several dozen Soul Refining Lamps and started casting the Blood Soul Curse.

Inside the ancient ruins, Dustless suddenly felt something, a hint of a sneer revealing at the corners of his mouth.

The Soul Suppressing Pearl came out of the body and suspended above Ye Yuan’s head, emitting a dark-red light.

“Heh, looks like those fiends know about Ye Yuan’s human race identity already. That old punk actually still dares to cast the Blood Soul Curse, simply seeking death! Don’t need to hold back anymore this time, let you eat a big loss!” Dustless said with a smile that was not a smile.

Ye Yuan was currently fully focused on breaking through realm and was completely oblivious toward this.

On the Soul Suppressing Pearl, the dark-red light became stronger and stronger, gradually forming a vortex, absorbing soul force crazily.

Previously, Dustless was afraid of Heavenstar detecting and intentionally exercised restraint.

But now, since the other party already discovered it, he naturally would not be over-cautious anymore.

Heavenstar activating the Blood Soul Curse was initially because he was in a great rage and wanted to put Ye Yuan to death.

But he discovered something wrong very quickly. His soul force actually poured out frenziedly involuntarily, as if being pumped out by someone to draw water.

Heavenstar was greatly shocked in his heart and wanted to stop the Blood Soul Curse.

But he discovered to his dismay that he could not do it at all!

Inside the array formation, Heavenstar surged with vitality, looking incomparably fearsome.

Quite a few fiend lords and geniuses were all exclaiming with regards to Heavenstar’s powerful strength and did not discover the slightest bit of abnormality.

“Such a powerful soul force! This lord’s strength is likely also in the upper echelons in the Blood Yama Hall, right?”

“Tsk tsk, I wonder what curse this lord activated. Most likely, at this time, that Source Night is feeling very awful, right?”

“Humph! He actually dared to toy with all of us in the palm of his hand. Serves him right to be cursed to death by His Excellency!”

...

Heavenstar was shouting frantically in his heart. But he was currently already brought into the gutter and could not even shout.

One had to know that his opponent was an empyrean spirit treasure!

Heavenstar’s face revealed a savage look. At this rate, his entire person would be sucked dry.

“Mn?”

Di En’s brows furrowed, finally discovering something amiss.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

His fingers flicked. Several dozen streams of light fired out, directly shattering those Soul Refining Lamps into pieces.

Woo, woo, woo ...

Countless ghostly wails reverberated inside this valley; incomparably shrill and forlorn.

“Noisy!”

Di En flicked his sleeves grandly, directly killing all of those fierce ghosts. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Puhwark!”

Heavenstar directly spewed out a large mouthful of blood, his entire person seemed to have had a great illness, feeble to the extreme.

Di En looked at Heavenstar and said with slightly furrowed brows, “What happened?”

Heavenstar said weakly, “D-Don’t know! The other party is like a black hole, continuously devouring my soul force. Couldn’t stop even if I wanted to! If you didn’t make a move, my fiend soul would likely be directly sucked dry!”

Di En’s expression was slightly dark. To be able to suck a Fiend Lord ninth-layered heaven powerhouse’s fiend soul dry, how formidable the strength did this require?

“This brat is peculiar! Most likely, there is quite a bit of secret on him. No wonder he could hide from all of us!” Di En said.

Heavenstar nodded his head feebly and said, “I was utterly played by this brat! Probably, he didn’t get hit by the Blood Soul Curse at all. No wonder when I cast the spell back then, it would expend large amounts of soul force each time.”

Heavenstar recalled the situation at that time and discovered that he was probably fooled right from the start.

At the thought that even the Profound Yellow Cauldron was cheated by Ye Yuan, Heavenstar’s heart was dripping blood.

This trip was really a double loss.

Di En’s brows furrowed and he said in a clear voice, “All disperse! Yi Han, you stay!”

Yi Han’s expression became fearful, knowing that this calamity likely could not be escaped.

The other hall masters knew that they could not poke the bull at this time, all taking their leave, leaving behind just Yi Han alone.

“Yi Han, the matter was caused by you. Now, I’ll give you a chance to make amends. Guard here. When that punk comes out, you can only leave after catching him, understood?” Di En said solemnly.

Yi Han hurriedly said, “Lord Di En, rest assured! Even if Yi Han needs to watch until the seas dry up and rocks decay, I’ll capture this brat!”

Di En nodded his head and said to Heavenstar, “Let’s go back. The secrets on this kid’s body might be even more valuable than these ancient ruins! As long as we catch him, everything can be discussed. In order to make provisions for contingencies, I’ll send someone else here and lend you a helping hand!”

Yi Han bowed and said, “Yes, Your Excellency!”

...

Breaking through to Origin Deity Realm made him have a feeling of peerlessness.

At this time, Ye Yuan’s divine sea expanded more than a hundred times from before. It was just that inside the Dantian space, it did not seem like a sea.

But like ... a region of starch paste!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he communicated with Dustless, “Senior, is my direction wrong? Why has the divine essence in my divine sea already almost became a pile of starch paste?”

Ye Yuan discovered that even though his divine essence was incomparably thick, it became stickier and stickier; completely different from ordinary people’s divine essence.

Dustless said, “This ... You’re walking a path that predecessors have never walked before. It’s not easy for me to judge. But your situation, I’ve indeed never seen before. However, when you created the cultivation method, it could trigger a heaven and earth phenomenon, and resonance of the Heavenspan Mountain. Presumably, this direction wouldn’t be wrong.”

Ye Yuan could not figure out after racking his brains and was very depressed in his heart.

His cultivation method was completely derived according to his understanding of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

That was a logical derivation.

But Ye Yuan’s cultivation method clearly contravened common sense and was vastly different from ordinary people. This unwittingly made him somewhat lose confidence.

Because Origin Deity to Divine Lord was an extremely huge chasm.

If the cultivation method that he derived was wrong and he was unable to open up a small world, then all of his efforts would turn to naught.

This was a very crucial step. Even Ye Yuan could not avoid thinking in terms of gains and losses.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Forget it, a shot arrow cannot be recalled. If I’m really unable to break through to Divine Lord Realm, we’ll talk again at that time.”

Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes and discovered that Zheng Jian was using a very shocked gaze to look at him.

“You won! Congratulations, you can obtain the Purple Extreme Hall’s true inheritance!” Zheng Jian said, somewhat lost in deep reverie.

His pride was trampled to the ground by Ye Yuan today.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks, Senior Zheng!”

Zheng Jian hesitated for a moment and said, “How did you do it?”

Ye Yuan froze for a moment before realizing that what Zheng Jian was referring to was Selfless Realm, and said with a smile, “That’s nothing. Before this, I’ve already entered it twice before. So ... there’s some experience.”

Zheng Jian was speechless.
