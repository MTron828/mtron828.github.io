Chapter 3094: Sacrificing Lives for Justice!

The mountain pass gates shattered. Corpses were scattered everywhere.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses suffered countless casualties.

After three days of fighting, more than half of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s elites were dead or injured!

Even if it was Hegemon Realms, more than a hundred died too!

As for below Hegemon Realm, the casualties were even beyond counting.

This war was tragic to the extreme.

Of course, the blood race did not get off cheap either, similarly suffering heavy losses.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses were completely risking their lives, completely disregarding casualties.

Different from the other heavens, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s cohesiveness was hair-raisingly strong.

Even Yi Xue was visibly moved by it too.

He thought that an absolute advantage would destroy these people’s will to fight very soon and make them fall apart and run away.

However, it did not!

In fact, those powerhouses that were brought back from all the heavens also fought until the last drop of blood one after another.

......

However, the blood race had a powerful recovery ability. In contrast, their losses were much smaller.

Around the vicinity of Extreme Medicine Sect’s main hall, a large group of Hegemon Realm powerhouses gathered.

Feng Xiaotian led more than ten Hegemon Realms and was currently defending nearby the main hall to the death.

He was dyed in blood all over, his aura disorderly, but his fighting spirit rose to the sky!

“Haha,?Feng Xiaotian, you all are risking your lives to defend this region of space. It looks like there’s really good stuff here! If I didn’t guess wrongly, the Heaven volume should be in here!” Bloodpromise looked at Feng Xiaotian and said with a loud laugh.

Feng Xiaotian said in a solemn voice, “So what if yes?”

Bloodpromise grinned and said, “Do you still want to have a cornered beast fight? In your current state, how long can you last?”

Feng Xiaotian wiped away the blood stains at the corners of his mouth and said proudly, “As long as I’m alive, you can forget about taking half a step into the Extreme Light Pavilion!”

In the midst of the fierce battle, an attack almost destroyed the Extreme Medicine Sect’s main hall.

This was the entrance to the Extreme Light Pavilion. It was also the location of the Heaven volume. It was where the foundation of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven lay.

It was naturally impossible for Feng Xiaotian to passively watch the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space be destroyed, so he sacrificed himself to block this attack.

But, like this, it exposed the importance of this place too.

Regarding this kind of space, it was very easy to hide from those below Hegemon. But it naturally could not be concealed from a powerhouse like Bloodpromise.

Hence, Bloodpromise gathered a large number of Hegemon Realms and attacked this place fiercely.

Originally, Feng Xiaotian had dozens of Hegemon Realms around him. But, in order to protect this place, they had nowhere to retreat and were unable to bypass the battle. They could only resist head-on.

After three days, there were only over ten Hegemon Realms left around Feng Xiaotian. Furthermore, each and every one was severely wounded.

“Hahaha,?like a mantis blocking a chariot! Feng Xiaotian, you and I have fought for so many years. Killing you today, it’s really a little melancholic! Attack together! Destroy this region of space and snatch the Heaven volume!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Under his word of command, dozens of Hegemon Realms rushed over like the wind.

Feng Xiaotian took the lead and went to meet the arriving enemies.

The fresh blood on his body added some desolate slaughter aura.

More than ten people versus dozens of people, this was a completely unfair battle.

But no one retreated!

“Zicang, Mingjiang, the two of you protect my flanks. After the others enter the hall, leave Bloodpromise they all to me!” Feng Xiaotian shouted fiercely.

There was no need for him to instruct. These two people were long already covering his flanks.

Zhou Zicang and Song Mingjiang, these two people were his comrades when he was at South Qi Giant City. Their cooperation had long already had a tacit agreement.

South Qi Giant City was a meat grinder, but it also gave birth to a large number of powerhouses.

Zhou Zicang and Song Mingjiang were outstanding talents among them.

Originally, it was very difficult for them to break through to Hegemon Realm.

But Ye Yuan made the Chaos Origin Formation. Zhou Zicang and Song Mingjiang, two people, broke through to Hegemon Realm in one stroke.

These two people had undergone trials in South Qi Giant City for many years. They were both people who were used to fighting, their combat power being extremely formidable. That was how they lived until now.

However, they were already arrows at the end of their flight too.

Fighting in close quarters, facing the powerful attacks of dozens of Hegemons, this group of people seemed to be struggling.

Of course, the most stressful one was naturally Feng Xiaotian.

He was currently still facing six great Peak Hegemons by himself!

And on Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s side, there was only him alone left!

But, facing such great disparity in strength, no one retreated.

Facing this battle situation of ten over people, Bloodpromise actually still failed to take them down after a long battle!

This group of people was too tenacious!

“Jin Yu, you go and cut off the flank. We’ll surround and besiege Feng Xiaotian again!” Bloodpromise suddenly said.

“Okay!”

Jin Yu was also one of the Peak Hegemons. After receiving the order, he turned around and headed for the flank.

Feng Xiaotian’s heart sank, but he was already powerless to stop it.

He was currently holding on entirely based on one breath. Regardless of whether it was spirit or physical body, they had all already reached the limit.

Jin Yu’s figure drew a blood-colored arc in the air, flying straight for Zhou Zicang!

“Be careful, Zicang!” Feng Xiaotian’s both eyes turned blood-red, crying out fiercely.

But Zhou Zicang laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha,?perfect! City Lord Feng, I, Old Zhou, will be making a move first!”

Finished saying that, he looked at Jin Yu and said with a loud laugh, “Damn bastard! Want to kill me, Zhou Zicang, it will break your teeth!”

Behind him, the Door of Eternal Life appeared.

Zhou Zicang’s entire person seemed to incarnate into a blazing fire, the aura on his body suddenly rising to an extremely terrifying level.

He was only a hair’s breadth away from Peak Hegemon!

Feng Xiaotian was facing five great Peak Hegemons and naturally could not get away. But how could he not feel Zhou Zicang’s situation?

But at this moment, he felt relieved.

“Hahaha,?take care, Old Zhou! This Feng will be following right away!” Feng Xiaotian suddenly laughed heroically and said.

Zhou Zicang had a calm look, holding a long saber in his hand, and swept across horizontally.

Puchi!

A Hegemon Realm head-on could not avoid it in time and was directly obliterated by this blade!

And this blade’s momentum did not reduce. It was as if it was going to split apart this firmament, flying straight for Jin Yu.

Jin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He felt the sharpness of this blade!

The power of this blade definitely already reached the level of a Peak Hegemon!

If he resisted it head-on, it would definitely be the outcome of mutual defeat!

It was only to see Jin Yu’s expression flicker, his body flying out in the air, attempting to dodge this blade.

At this moment, he retreated!

Either way, this saber of Zhou Zicang’s had already depleted his life force. He was deader than dead.

A frontal confrontation was not worth it!

“Hahaha,?coward! You don’t even dare to receive a blade from Your Father! Go to hell!”

Amidst the loud laugh, Zhou Zicang’s saber momentum turned, chasing right after Jin Yu, forcing him to accept the challenge.

Jin Yu was greatly shocked, because this saber was too fast!

No time to think too much, he turned around and dealt a blow.

Boom!

In the void, two powerful attacks collided together fiercely.

“Pffft!”

Jin Yu spurted a mouthful of blood wildly, feeling like all the blood in his body was blowing apart.

This saber of Zhou Zicang’s still inflicted heavy wounds on him.

But at this time, Zhou Zicang’s body fell down softly, falling from the air. He had already stopped breathing.

“Mad man! Really a bunch of lunatics!” Jin Yu cursed angrily.

This group of people was simply a bunch of mad men.

Not a single person escaped. All of them fought to the last breath.

Zhou Zicang was merely an ordinary Hegemon, but he erupted with shocking combat power, inflicting heavy wounds on him, this Peak Hegemon.

This was something unimaginable in other places.

However, before he recovered from the shock, another shocking attack erupted above the void again, flying straight for him.

Jin Yu felt all the hair on his body stand on end, only feeling the scent of death coming head-on.

“City Lord Feng, Old Song will also be making a move first!?Hahaha,?dog thing, die!” Song Mingjiang’s voice reverberated throughout the heavens.
