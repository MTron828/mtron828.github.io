“5000 divine essence stones!”

Chang Liang’s gaze turned intent, and he drew a cold breath.

To them, 5000 low-grade divine essence stones were not some small figure.

Even though all of the members of theYin Wind Seven Heroes, their strengths were uncommon, spending as long as several years in the Yin Wind Den, the divine essence stones added up for the seven people would not exceed this sum either.

But Ye Yuan’s opening offer was 5000 low-grade divine essence stones!

Furthermore, it was just leading the way!

These 5000 low-grade divine essence stones were earned too easily.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “That’s right. Here are 1000 low-grade divine essence stones, take it as a deposit. As long as you all bring me to gather up 500 late-stage One-star evil spirits, the remaining 4000 low-grade divine essence stones, I’ll pay up the sum in full.”

Ye Yuan helped the Myriad Treasure Tower create such a large profit, the Myriad Treasure Tower naturally would not treat him shabbily.

Low-grade divine essence stones, Ye Yuan naturally took whatever he pleased.

As long as it was not too overboard, the Myriad Treasure Tower would not say anything.

“5-500!” Chang Liang was speechless.

This boy was really hell-bent on shocking people to death with words!

Over 500 late-stage One-star evil spirits, even the average grand completion Grotto Profound did not dare to easily engage head-on either. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

An initial-stage Grotto Profound kid actually dared to boast so shamelessly!

Chang Liang suddenly felt several strange gazes coming from behind him.

No need to turn back and he also knew that those few brothers probably had killing intent aroused!

In this place, killing people to seize treasures was all too normal.

Ye Yuan’s opening move was 5000 low-grade divine essence stones. The divine essence stones he was carrying on him were probably far more than this figure.

As long as they killed Ye Yuan, then the divine essence stones on him were all theirs.

Compared to leading the way, they were clearly more willing to clean away the divine essence stones on Ye Yuan.

Actually, it was not just his six brothers who had killing intent aroused. Even Chang Liang himself also had killing intent aroused.

But he, Chang Liang, was able to hang around in the Yin Wind Den for so long because he was cautious by nature.

He could not resist glancing at Ye Yuan and discovered that Ye Yuan seemed to be completely clueless about his brothers’ killing intent like he was completely fine.

Chang Liang’s heart stirred, the temptation of divine essence stones finally overwhelmed everything.

But, just as he was about to make a move, he suddenly detected an imperceptible cold smile flashing across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

Chang Liang’s heart thumped, the words when reaching his mouth changed at the behest of supernatural powers.

“Haha, deal! Little Brother is really generous. I, Chang Liang, will make friends with you!” Chang Liang received a thousand low-grade divine essence stones with a hearty laugh.

Chang Liang’s words made the six brothers’ jaws drop.

When did Boss become so easy-going?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Lead the way then!”

Chang Liang said with a laugh, “Sure, easily arranged!”

Following that, Chang Liang brought Ye Yuan and made many twists and turns. Indeed, before long, the evil spirits that they encountered become stronger.

Chang Liang and the rest became cautious and on the alert one by one.

The strongest among them, Chang Liang, was merely middle-stage Grotto Profound too.

Encountering late-stage One-star evil spirits, there was not even time for them to run. They did not dare to approach at all.

“Ahead is the Purple Nether Cave. That place definitely has late-stage One-star evil spirits. But, Little brother, the few of us don’t dare to go in,” Chang Liang said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “You all can just wait outside the cave for me!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan entered the Purple Nether Cave without turning his head back.

“Boss, why didn’t you make a move just now? I dare to bet that this kid has at the very least no less than 50 thousand divine essence stones on him!” Seeing Ye Yuan enter the cave, the Yin Wind Seven Heroes’ Number Seven could not resist grumbling.

“Yeah, Boss! Normally, you aren’t so timid and cowardly! Seeing such a fat lamb, you’d have long taken action!” said Number Three.

Chang Liang’s gaze swept over their faces and heaved a sigh as he said, “Why wouldn’t I know what you guys are thinking? I nearly made a move just now!”

“Then why did you change your tune again? Now, he entered the Purple Nether Cave, so he’s probably already dead. For us to take the divine essence stones on him, we’d have to expend a lot of effort!” Number seven said.

In their view, this Ye Yuan was simply a silly young master flushed with money.

He did not know about this Yin Wind Den’s terror at all and wanted to barge into the Purple Nether Cave without due consideration. What difference was there from courting death?

Chang Liang gave him a glance and said with a cold smile, “Do you all really think that there are so many idiots in this word? Heh heh, it’s precisely because his actions looked very foolish that I felt that this kid was not to be provoked! No idea why, when I was planning on making a move earlier, I felt my heart palpitate with anxiety and fear! Just like being locked on by a hunter!”

Chang Liang’s words did not change the group of brothers’ views.

Number Two also interjected, “Boss, merely an initial-stage Grotto Profound brat, is there a need to be so careful? Us seven brothers, there are already three middle-stage Grotto Profound. Could it be that we still can’t deal with a brat who’s wet behind his ears?”

Chang Liang said coolly, “You guys just wait. I dare to wager that he can definitely come out from inside the Purple Nether Cave!”

Number Seven said, “How is this possible? He alone probably can’t even deal with an initial-stage One-star evil spirit, can he still deal with late-stage evil spirits?”

Number Three also said, “Yeah, Big Brother! Either way, we also earned a thousand divine essence stones for nothing! Let’s go right away! There’s no way he can come out.”

Chang Liang chuckled and said, “Dare to bet or not? I, Chang Liang, examine my own conscience and feel that I still have some knack in judging people. This kid is absolutely not simple!”

Number Seven said, being unconvinced, “Boss, don’t you really trigger me! You say, how to bet?”

Chang Liang smiled and said, “Let’s set three days as the limit. If that kid comes out, these 5000 divine essence stones, I’ll take 4000! If that kid doesn’t come out, these 1000 divine essence stones, I don’t want a piece and will even top you guys up a thousand divine essence stones, you all take them and split!”

With Chang Liang saying this, the brothers all laughed.

“Haha, Boss, since you’re so generous, then the brothers will kindly accept it! This wager, you’ll lose for sure! Don’t talk about three days, even if it’s 30 days, he can’t come out either!” Number Seven said with a loud laugh.

“Boss, when the time comes, you can’t renege on your bet! This wager, you lost for sure!” Number Two also said with a laugh.

“Boss, we’ve mingled around in this Yin Wind Den for so many years, when have you seen before an initial-stage Grotto Profound can come out from the Purple Nether Cave, this kind of place? What’s with you today, are you alright?” Number Three also laughed loudly and said.

Chang Liang just smiled and said nothing. He believed in his judgment.

He, this person, was meticulous; his vision was extremely sharp.

It was precisely because so that he could bring the brothers and slip away from under the Wang Family’s hands.

If it was another person, saying one sentence wrong and they would probably have to be silenced by the Wang Family to prevent divulgence of secrets.

...

“Second Brother, this Yin Wind Den is so large, the terrain is extremely complicated. How do we find him?” Wang Yugan was also made dizzy by the terrain here.

Wang Yutao said solemnly, “Find some people and ask! That kid is a new face, he’s definitely very conspicuous! I believe that for him to come here, it’s impossible to find a place with nobody to hide. As long as we ask more people, there will definitely be someone who knows!”

Wang Yugan’s eyes lit up, and he said, “Second Brother is brilliant!”

Wang Yutao said, “The few of you, all spread out for me. Find the local hegemons here and inquire! If somebody saw a new face, you must inquire clearly. Understand?”
