Chapter 2269: I Want a Lucky Chance!

“Hidden Lineage’s Head Elder, Ji Ling, requests an audience with Young Friend Ye Yuan!”

Li Zhaoqing was currently kowtowing when a hoary voice suddenly came from outside the door.

Even though the person outside the door did not deliberately give off pressure, Li Zhaoqing could detect that the two auras outside were powerful to the extreme.

This kind of existence was close to Heavenly Dao!

How could such characters be so respectful toward an Empyrean? Not daring to even directly enter?

Just who was this young man in front of him?

Li Zhaoqing suddenly discovered that he provoked an extremely terrifying existence.

At this moment, all his hopes were dashed to pieces. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He knew that he probably would not survive this time.

“Come in,” Ye Yuan sat up straight and said coolly.

An old man in white robes pushed the door and entered, his body emitting an aura that made people’s hair stand on end.

A peak Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm existence did not need to intentionally go and show anything and would have an imposing momentum close to Heavenly Dao.

Ye Yuan was deeply aware of the divine race’s might. Peak existences like Ji Ling and Ru Feng were probably what even one or two human Deva First Blight powerhouses could be a match for.

However, the human race’s powerhouses were too many!

One could not beat, two could not beat, I could beat with 50, right?

That was right, the number of Heavenly Emperors was indeed extremely few with regards to the entire human race.

But the human race’s numbers were put there, even if a Heavenly Emperor emerged out of a billion people, the number of Heavenly Emperors was also not what the divine race could compare to.

Ji Ling entered the door and gave a deep bow to Ye Yuan and said, “Young Friend Ye, the matter this time, it was my divine race that has affronted you. We’re willing to compensate! We only request Young Friend Ye to lift your hand high up in mercy and hand the antidote to us.”

Li Zhaoqing’s eyes went wide!

At this time, with Ji Ling standing in front of him, the aura exuding off of his body virtually made him unable to lift his head!

He was incomparably sure in his heart that this old man must be a late-stage Heavenly Emperor terrifying existence.

But such a powerhouse actually paid such solemn respects to an Empyrean, extending a formal apology!

This scene seriously subverted his worldview too much.

When could Empyreans be awesome to such a degree?

Ye Yuan gave Ji Ling a glance and said coolly, “Oh?

Wonder what Head Elder will use to compensate?”

Ji Ling clearly came prepared, saying, “My Hidden Lineage has also stored some Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures these few years. If Young Friend Ye takes fancy on them, you can freely choose. Additional, cultivation method, spirit medicines, divine essence stones, we can give compensation!”

Li Zhaoqing drew a cold breath, how great an enmity was this, to actually use Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures to pay it off?

Furthermore, it was to be freely picked!

When did Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures become so worthless?

How could he know that the Hidden Lineage had lurked in the Heavenspan World for a full epoch? The human powerhouses that they killed numbered God knows how many.

Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures this sort of thing, there was naturally quite a number accumulated.

“Not enough!” Ye Yuan was expressionless and just lightly spat out two words.

Ji Ling’s brows furrowed and he said, “Young Friend Ye, this old man examined my conscience and felt that I’m already very sincere! Could it be that you’re really going to force mutual destruction?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Your divine race’s life is life; my brother’s life isn’t a life?”

Ji Ling said, “But he didn’t die!”

Ye Yuan said, “But his master died!”

Ji Ling was very disdainful in his heart.

How could a lowly ant be mentioned in the same breath with the noble divine race?

But now, he really had no way about it.

This poison, he could not cure it!

Ji Ling said, “What the hell do you want?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I want a lucky chance!”

Ji Ling frowned and said, “The divine race’s lucky chances, you can’t force it!”

Ye Yuan said, “That doesn’t need Head Elder to worry about! Also, don’t keep on having a high and mighty appearance! What your divine race cultivates is Heavenly Dao. What my human race cultivates is also Heavenly Dao! Moreover, in my eyes, your divine race is also nothing impressive! At least in front of me, you all don’t have the capital to be high and mighty!”

Ye Yuan’s words did not save the slightest bit of face.

Ji Ling and Ru Feng’s faces were both very ugly.

But they could not find a word to refute it!

A human Empyrean could jump over a major realm and defeat the divine race’s Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse.

What qualifications did they have to consider themselves superior in front of Ye Yuan?

Ji Ling’s brows furrowed even tighter. Pondering for a moment, he nodded and said, “Fine, this old man promises you! Now, you can hand over the antidote, right?”

Ye Yuan did not say another word, taking out a bunch of powder from spirit medicines from his storage ring.

Then, his fingers moved slightly. An incomparably complex array formation formed very quickly.

Ji Ling’s pupils constricted. This kind of inconceivable array formation, it was still his first time seeing.

Below the array formation, a medicinal pill condensed and formed very quickly.

“Dissolve this medicinal pill in water and let those who are poisoned drink it, it will be able to suppress the toxicity and won’t spread anymore,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ji Ling’s brows furrowed and he said, “Suppress the toxicity? What this old man wants is the antidote!”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “Does Head Elder take me to be a fool? Curing the poison now, can I still walk out of here? Oh, forgot to tell you, the time that this medicinal pill can last is only one month. One month later, the toxicity will erupt once more. No need to be anxious. What I have is time, I’ll be a guest here for a period of time.”

Ji Ling and Ru Feng almost spewed out a mouthful of old blood!

This brat was still continuing to stay and not leaving?

They had lived for countless tens of thousands of years, it was still their first time seeing someone who dared to be so arrogant in the divine clan!

Yet, Ye Yuan had this confidence!

These two people did not dare to dawdle either, immediately bringing the medicinal pill and going to resolve the poison.

At this time, monstrous waves already stirred up in Li Zhaoqing’s heart.

Divine race!

What race was this?

Never heard before!

But he seemed to have been this race’s lackey these few years!

He suddenly turned to Rong Xiyue and questioned, “You guys! Who the hell are you all?”

Rong Xiyue was expressionless as she said, “Don’t you already know? We’re of the divine race! The supreme divine race! In the future, we’ll also be the divine race that destroys your human race!”

Li Zhaoqing’s complexion was ashen, seemingly seeing a huge conspiracy!

“Y-Your Excellency, I ... I didn’t know anything! It was all of them! Everything was all instigated by them!” Li Zhaoqing repeatedly kowtowed toward Ye Yuan and complained tearfully.

Ye Yuan was expressionless as he said coolly, “Is that so? While they are the ringleaders, have you never committed crimes before? These several hundreds of thousands of years, how many people have died at your hands? Mo Lifei’s entire family died at your hands! Even my brother almost died at your hands! Do you feel that you’re not guilty?”

Ye Yuan enunciated each word, directly announcing Li Zhaoqing’s death sentence.

He drew a long sword and passed it to Ning Tianping’s hand, and then he said coolly, “Your master’s grudge, you avenge it!”

After he finished talking, his palm pushed out. An incomparably powerful strength transmitted into Ning Tianping’s body.

Ning Tianping’s essence, energy, and spirit immediately recovered a lot and could already barely manage to stand up.

He took over the sword from Ye Yuan’s hand and walked over toward Li Zhaoqing.

A hint of viciousness flashed across in Li Zhaoqing’s gaze, and his figure suddenly erupted, charging towards Ning Tianping!

“Even if I die, you’ll also have to be buried with me!” A hint of smugness flashed across the corners of Li Zhaoqing’s mouth.

He was too close to Ning Tianping, the others did not have time to save at all.

“Immobilize!”

However, Ye Yuan lightly spat a word out of his mouth. Li Zhaoqing seemed to have been hit by a paralyzing hex, and froze in midair just like that, unable to move a muscle anymore.

His gaze revealed an extremely shocked look, doing his best to shake off this constraint.

But everything was to no avail.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, casting Time Freeze on him, he would not be able to move even the slightest for half a day!

Ning Tianping limped over just like that, arriving in front of him.
