Chapter 1309: Luo Jian’s Appraisal

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Uncle, actually, Rong-er has already liked you for very long!”

Liang Wanrong sprinted all the way. While running, she even took off her clothes and headed for the Wang Lingbo sitting above.

She had fallen for Ye Yuan’s move last time, and now the same thing happened. She was too elated with the situation that she forgot it. She had long tossed the matter of falling for this move back then beyond the nine clouds.

Caught unaware, Ye Yuan directly made her succumb.

When Wang Pianran saw this scene, she could not help jumping with fright. Why would her daughter suddenly become like this?

Wang Lingbo’s brows furrowed. Waving his hand, it was a slap.

Slap!

A clear slapping sound echoed throughout the entire great hall, clear and audible. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Liang Wanrong was directly slapped until she spun in the air. When she landed on the ground, she was already out cold.

“Rong-er! Brother, what are you doing!”

Wang Pianran screamed at the top of her voice, and she hurriedly went over to help up her daughter.

But Wang Lingbo ignored his sister. He used a murderous gaze to look at Ye Yuan.

“Ocular arts! Heh, I really underestimated you! But ... you deserve death!”

Wang Lingbo’s face was cold. Clearly, he had killing intent aroused towards Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If we can’t see eye-to-eye, then don’t talk anymore. But don’t take this Ye to be an idiot! Luo Jian, let’s go!”

Ye Yuan turned around and left without the slightest hesitation.

A flicker of surprise flashed across Luo Jian’s gaze. His look when looking at Ye Yuan finally had a slight change.

Wang Lingbo’s brows furrowed and he said coldly, “If you dare to walk out of this front door, that girl will be dead for sure!”

Ye Yuan turned around and looked at Wang Lingbo as he said with a faint smile, “Rest assured, even if you die, Wanru won’t die! Not only won’t she die, but she’ll even open her mouth and speak anew, stepping into Deity Realm. She will let you all, people who bullied her, have a good look!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around and left, and did not look back again.

Wang Lingbo laughed wildly and said, “Hahaha

... Ignorant child! My Wang Family’s Poisonfeather Thousand Night, even Feng Ping that old fart can’t do anything about it. With just the likes of you, a brat who’s still wet behind the ears? Dream on!”

As for what Ye Yuan said, making Wanru open her mouth and speak, and step into Deity Realm, Wang Lingbo even directly chose to ignore it.

This ... was impossible!

The reason why Ye Yuan chose to take action against Liang Wanrong was that he saw through this family, and they had no good faith at all.

He had been examining the words and expressions all along. When Wang Lingbo learned that he did not have beast taming arts, he thoroughly lost interest in him.

What replaced it was a look of disdain and banter.

This kind of people’s words, Ye Yuan would not believe at all.

Even if he really knelt down for Liang Wanru, it was also impossible for Wang Lingbo to give him the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s antidote.

The reason why he said so was entirely in order to humiliate him.

If he really knelt down and begged, not only would the other party not give him the antidote, they would even go from bad to worse.

Hence, he decisively chose to take action against Liang Wanrong.

She wanted to humiliate him, then let her disgrace herself first!

Ye Yuan walked straight out of the Wang Family and never looked back.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Wang Lingbo’s expression was grim to the extreme.

...

“This Ye Yuan, what do you think of him?” Yang Rui’s gaze was deep as he asked Luo Jian.

He had Luo Jian follow Ye Yuan. It was to protect Ye Yuan and also naturally to monitor and observe Ye Yuan.

After all, Ye Yuan’s origins were unknown.

“High morality reaching up to the clouds, wise and farsighted, unfathomable!” Luo Jian appraised.

Yang Rui’s gaze flickered, revealing a look of surprise and he said in surprise, “Oh? Someone able to make you evaluate like so isn’t simple! This boy is truly so impressive?”

Yang Yui knew that Luo Jian’s experience was exceedingly vast. Ordinary people could not enter his arcane sights at all.

There had never been a person who could make him appraise so highly before.

High morality reaching up to the clouds, he could understand. Wise and farsighted was also barely passable.

But a cripple with a damaged divine sea, no matter how formidable, it was limited too. Luo Jian actually used ‘unfathomable’ to describe him. It truly made Yang Rui very surprised.

“Perhaps, he’s a dragon wandering the shoal!” A glint flashed in Luo Jian’s eyes.

Yang Rui’s face revealed a musing look, and he said, “Then your meaning is that us roping this boy is correct?”

Luo Jian was silent for a moment and then said, “Maybe there will be unexpected gains.”

Yang Rui frowned and said, “Then do you think you can refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill?”

Luo Jian shook his head. Clearly, he also did not think that Ye Yuan could create a miracle.

After all, there were only over 30 days.

And Ye Yuan seemed to only know how to refine Divine Essence Pill currently. Wanting to refine a divine-grade Detoxification Pill, this was simply something impossible.

...

Returning to the Myriad Treasure Tower, Ye Yuan applied for sufficient quantities of medicinal herbs and divine essence stones from Manager Su. He then directly chose to enter closed-seclusion.

Out of 40 days, four days were already spent. He still had 36 days, which was also a year’s time.

In this one year, not only did he have to cultivate the Divine Essence Pill to divine-grade, he even had to cultivate the One-star Detoxification Pill to divine-grade!

This task was even more daunting than him cultivating the Divine Essence Pill.

Starting closed-seclusion, Ye Yuan began to refine day and night.

Although Ye Yuan’s understanding of the Lesser Divine Essence Formation became increasingly profound, wanting to refine a divine-grade Divine Essence Pill, it was still far too lacking.

He was still a long away from heaven-grade right now!

“The Lesser Divine Essence Formation is the foundation of all rank one pill refining formations. Not training it to the acme of perfection, it’s impossible for other array formations to have any accomplishments,” Dustless said.

“Senior, rest assured. I have a score in my heart and won’t rush for quick results,” Ye Yuan said.

“En, although your talent is extraordinary, wanting to cultivate the Divine Essence Pill and Detoxification Pill to the divine-grade realm within a year is still too forceful! Therefore, you have to be mentally prepared.”

“No need to be mentally prepared. I’ll definitely succeed!” Ye Yuan said with a sharp gaze.

Dustless looked at Ye Yuan and said no more.

He discovered that Ye Yuan belonged to that kind of becoming stronger when encountering something stronger personality.

The greater the difficulty faced, the more his fighting intent surged instead.

Although pill refinement did not compare to fighting, the difficulty placed in front of Ye Yuan was even greater than fighting.

Calm whenever encountering major issues!

This was the feeling that Ye Yuan gave Dustless.

Before failure, he would absolutely not see that sort of dispirited mood from Ye Yuan.

It seemed like Ye Yuan would never consider the issue of what happens after failure.

Dustless also had no choice but to admit that this kind of quality was extremely rare.

Perhaps Ye Yuan had come along this way, relying on precisely this quality.

One had to admit that entering the Selfless Realm at that time, the help to Ye Yuan was seriously too great.

According to normal comprehension, it was absolutely impossible for Ye Yuan to comprehend the medicinal properties of those few kinds of spirit medicines to such an extent in such a short time.

Through the refinement previously, Ye Yuan’s comprehension of the spirit medicines’ medicinal properties already reached 80%!

Adding on Ye Yuan’s comprehension towards the Lesser Divine Essence Formation becoming deeper and deeper, his attainments in the Divine Essence Pill advanced by leaps and bounds.

Half a month later, Ye Yuan was already able to steadily refine superior-grade Divine Essence Pills.

One and a half months later, Ye Yuan finally refined a heaven-grade Divine Essence Pill for the first time.

Three months later, Ye Yuan was already able to steadily refine heaven-grade Divine Essence Pills!

Finally, Ye Yuan arrived at the threshold of refining a divine-grade Divine Essence Pill!
