Chapter 1353: Falling Into a Pit of One’s Own Digging

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ten thousand miles away from Jewelhill City, two figures were riding two flying dragon colts, currently speeding in the direction of Brightraise City like the wind.

“Wang Su, it isn’t good for you to be like this, right? No matter what, Jewelhill City’s branch family is also a branch of the Wang Family, members of the same clan!” Wang Xuanfeng said.

“Jewelhill City’s branch family is already crippled. So just treat it as a cripple and make use of it! Not doing so, on what basis do we get the main family to send people over to eliminate that punk?” Wang Su said without a care.

Wang Xuanfeng heaved a sigh and said, “But this method is also a bit too vicious!”

Wang Su said nonchalantly, “Those who accomplish great things don’t bother with trifles! How can someone with the benevolence of a woman make it in the world of martial artists? Enough talk, better hurry on the way!”

Wang Xuanfeng gave him a glance but did not say anymore.

The two people were currently pushing on with their journey when suddenly, a gust of sinister wind howled past.

The two people only felt a blur before their eyes. There was actually an additional figure ahead.

Wang Su’s pupils constricted, his expression changed drastically as he said stammeringly, “Y-Y-You ... Why would you show up here?”

That profile ahead was none other than precisely Gui Yun!

Gui Yun said coolly, “Master ordered me to follow you all. As long as you all leave Jewelhill City, I’ll stop you guys. Now, follow me back.”

Wang Su’s face was ashen pale, a look of despair.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so cautious, sending this evil spirit over to follow them!

“Yang Rui, Ye Yuan, if you all don’t give me an explanation today, it’s not over between us! If you have the capability, kill me, Wang Pianran! Either way, you guys have already killed my big brother and my father! I want to see who else will buy your Myriad Treasure Tower’s things in the future ...”

Wang Pianran shrieked at the top of her voice, drawing more and more people over.

Seeing this scene, Yang Rui became more anxious.

At this rate, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s reputation would be utterly ruined.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “Brother Yang, hold your horses. Since they are taking the road to ruin themselves, that’s also up to them.”

Yang Rui said in puzzlement, “Do you know some things?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Don’t know, merely just took some extra precaution. Fighting with this bunch of despicable villains, how can one not pay a little more attention?”

With Ye Yuan saying so, Yang Rui did not have confidence in his heart anymore.

Right then, a gust of Yin wind suddenly howled at the Myriad Treasure Tower. Everyone all could not resist shuddering.

Thud!

Two figures were thrown into the crowd by no idea whom, falling heavily onto the ground.

Ye Yuan looked at the Wang Su struggling to get up and said with a faint smile, “Wang Su, didn’t expect that we’d meet again so soon. But isn’t it somewhat unfair for you to leave without bidding farewell?”

At this time, Wang Su and Wang Xuanfeng, the two people’s divine essence, they were sealed by Gui Yun. They could not even kill people even if they wanted to.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Wang Su’s expression became incomparably ugly.

“Ye Yuan, what do you mean? It’s not enough that you killed Jewelhill City’s Wang Family’s Wang Yuxiang father and son, now, you even want to provoke our Brightraise City’s main family?” Wang Su said with a cold snort.

Being framed by Wang Su, Ye Yuan was not worried either, saying with a faint smile, “If people don’t offend me, I don’t offend people; if people offend me, I’ll definitely won’t spare them! It was you all who provoked me time and again, so how did it become me provoking you all? Heh heh, this ability to confound black and white, you guys are truly invincible under the heavens!”

Seeing that look of Ye Yuan that saw through everything, Wang Su’s heart involuntarily felt somewhat nervous.

But upon thinking of his identity, he calmed down a little again.

With the Wang Family’s strength, what did a mere middle-stage Two-star evil spirit count as?

If he dared to touch him, he was dead for sure!

His thought arriving here, Wang Su involuntarily plucked up his courage again.

“Heh, confounding black and white? You guys don’t dare to admit it after doing it! Wang Yuxiang’s corpse is placed here, could it be that you dare say that he wasn’t killed by you?” Wang Su said with a cold smile.

“That’s right, Wang Yuxiang was indeed killed by me!” Ye Yuan nodded his head and said nonchalantly.

Wang Su was stunned. He originally thought that Ye Yuan would deny it outright and had long thought of his choice of words already.

But he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually admitted it very shamelessly.

This made the words that he thought of become useless all at once.

Not just Wang Su, everyone present was in an uproar.

They did not think that the Myriad Treasure Tower really used shady means and killed the Wang Family’s head elder, Wang Yuxiang!

“Heh, since you admitted it, then everything can naturally be discussed! I want to see how you’ll give an account to the Wang Family, how you explain to Jewelhill City’s martial artists!” Wang Su said with righteous indignation.

Ye Yuan looked at him with pity and said coolly, “Explain? Explain what? Want to give an account, it’s also you who gives it. What happened in the City Lord Manor, you’re aware of it yourself.”

Wang Su said with a cold smile, “Of course I’m aware! You plotted with Yang Rui, killing the Wang Family father and son with a venomous scheme! Does this matter still need to be explained? The Myriad Treasure Tower is so insidious and vicious. Everyone, make sure not to buy things here anymore in the future! Otherwise, you might die without even knowing how you died!”

Wang Su fanned the fire there, immediately obtaining many onlookers’ response.

After all, Ye Yuan himself admitted it, this matter was equivalent to being set in stone.

“Ye Yuan, I’ll fight it out with you! You caused my family to be ruined, its members dead! Even if I die today, I’ll drag you to be buried in death too!”

By the side, Wang Pianran already could not hold back long ago, finally erupting, pouncing toward Ye Yuan with a body full of excessive flesh.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with her, kicking a foot over, sending the body of fatty flesh flying out.

Such a tyrannical Ye Yuan made everyone give a sidelong glance even more.

For a moment, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s image fell to rock-bottom in everyone’s mind.

Seeing this kind of situation, Wang Su was incomparably thrilled in his heart.

What he wanted was this effect!

Ye Yuan looked at Wang Family with a smile that was not a smile, walked over towards him, and said while walking, “Are you secretly taking delight in your heart? Do you feel that with the Wang Family as backing, I won’t dare to do anything to you? Do you think that I need to borrow your mouth to explain anything to everyone?”

Wang Su had goosebumps breakout being stared at by Ye Yuan’s gaze, his figure involuntarily falling back.

“You ... What do you want to do? I’m telling you, my big brother is Brightraise City’s deputy city lord! You, this bumpkin, definitely don’t know how powerful the Wang Family’s strength is! You ... If you dare to touch me, you’ll die without a burial ground!” Wang Su said as his face turned pale while backing away.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh, “Wang Su, I really pity you! You think that you’re smart, thinking that everyone fears the Wang Family’s strength. Very sorry, I don’t care! Since you aren’t willing to say the truth, then there’s no need to say it anymore either!”

While talking, Ye Yuan suddenly attacked, destroying all of Wang Su’s vitality with one palm.

Wang Su did not even get to scream and died until he could not die anymore.

Seeing this scene, everyone was even more dumbstruck with amazement.

The current Ye Yuan was simply a murderous demon king in their eyes.

Killing people with a word of disagreement!

The Yang Rui by the side was also startled inwardly. He did not think that Ye Yuan was so decisive in going for the kill, and actually really killed Wang Su.

With this, the matter was somewhat troublesome.

“You ... You dared to kill Wang Su!”

Wang Xuanfeng was also stunned by this scene. He really did not expect that Ye Yuan was such a lunatic without any sense of judgment, to really dare to make a move and kill people.

Ye Yuan looked at him, shrugged his shoulders and said, “Now, it’s your turn, are you saying it or not? It’s fine if you don’t say anything. I can go and get the Lu Family and Lin Family, those two old fellows, here to tell it.”
