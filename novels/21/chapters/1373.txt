1377 Qin Tian

“Heh, what did I tell you guys? With your current strength, going in is equivalent to courting death. There won’t be any harvests at all.”

Zhao Qin looked at Ye Yuan, who was covered in injuries. His facial expression was filled with mockery.

This kind of student who overestimated their own ability, he had seen plenty and did not have any sympathy.

He already warned previously, so who was to blame for not listening to the warning?

Qin Shao passed his academy token to Zhao Qin and said, “Sword Tomb. Please help me deduct the points for entering the Sword Tomb once and write it on Ye Yuan’s token.”

In the academy, this kind of deduction method could be seen everywhere and did not have anything strange.

Of course, the prerequisite was that one took the initiative to request.

Zhao Qin froze and immediately could not help laughing as he said, “Heh, you all are new and still don’t know how valuable points are living in the academy, right?”

Qin Shao gave Zhao Qin a glance and explained, “I lost a bet to him. He persisted for a whole month in the Sword Tomb’s first level, this is the wager.”

With Qin Shao’s personality, he originally could not be bothered to explain.

But no idea why, he still explained it unbeknownst to gods and ghosts.

Hearing Qin Shao’s explanation, Zhao Qin got a shock. “What? He ... He persisted like this for a month? Impossible!”

It was no wonder that Zhao Qin was surprised. With Ye Yuan’s bit of strength, persisting inside for a month, he would long have been dismembered by a flurry of swords. How could it be possible to come out alive?

Many weak students all went in to challenge it, and then they came out to get treatment for a few days after being hurt by the sword energies.

After their injuries healed, they would enter again, rinse and repeat like this.

Zhao Qin thought that Ye Yuan receiving such heavy injuries, it must have been the case like the others, entering the Sword Tomb, leaving with injuries, entering again, and repeating the cycle. He thought this was God knows how many times Ye Yuan already attempted this.

But Qin Shao said that Ye Yuan just kept on persisting inside for a month!

Qin Shao was disdainful to explain too much. He had his pride and just said indifferently, “Senior Apprentice Brother, please help me to deduct the points.”

“Ah? O-Oh!”

Zhao Qin’s entire person was still in the midst of shock. Being told like this by Qin Shao, only then did he deduct Qin Shao’s 20 points and put it down on Ye Yuan’s token.

Finishing with these, Qin Shao said to Ye Yuan, “When is the next time you’re coming?”

Ye Yuan forced a smile and said, “Why? Still want to compete?”

Qin Shao shook his head and said, “There’s no point to compete again! Next time, I can definitely last 30 days! I just want to take a look at what on earth you’re trying to do.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Uh ... If barring no accidents, half a month later!”

Qin Shao nodded his head and said, “Okay, half a month later, I’ll come again!”

Qin Shao was just about to leave when a person came from head-on.

Seeing the arrival, Qin Shao’s expression changed, and he bowed and said, “I’ve seen Big Brother Qin Tian!”

Qin Tian’s expression was frosty, no joy nor sorrow on his face. Seeing Qin Shao greeted him, he nodded and said, “Heard that you obtained the top dog position this time?”

Zhao Qin’s expression turned stiff, and he looked at Qin Shao in surprise. He did not think that this guy was actually the top dog this time!

Since he was the top dog, Qin Shao’s strength could be imagined.

But he actually lost to this middle-stage Grotto Profound?

How was this possible?

Zhao Qin suddenly discovered that his mind was somewhat in a mess.

Qin Shao seemed to be rather fearful toward this Qin Tian and immediately said respectfully, “Mn, not bad.”

Qin Tian nodded. He said, “Work hard, and in the future, my Qin Family will definitely have a place for you!”

“Yes, Big Brother Qin Tian. Younger Brother will definitely work hard!” Qin Shao replied.

Then Qin Tian’s gaze looked toward Ye Yuan at this time, a cold light flashed in his eyes, and he said, “Stay further away from that punk. He’s a dead man sooner or later!”

These words that Qin Tian suddenly said made everyone stunned.

Qin Shao’s expression was very confused, uncertain what in the world happened.

Ye Yuan’s face fell; a cold light flashed in his eyes too.

Very clearly, this Qin Tian meant the incident at the Clearwind Inn that day.

It was just that this Qin Tian was too crazy, simply looking down on everything!

In his eyes, he already sentenced Ye Yuan to death.

Qin Tian had no intention of explaining. Handing the academy token to Zhao Qin, he said, “The 11th level, 5 times!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent again. He did not expect that Qin Tian’s strength was actually so strong!

Those able to make it to the 11th level were basically all that strongest batch in the academy!

Zhao Qin hurriedly helped Qin Tian swipe the token, then handed it back respectfully, thickened his face, and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian, it’s already done!”

Qin Tian nodded slightly, received the token, and directly entered the Sword Tomb.

Only then did Qin Shao come to his senses, but he discovered that Ye Yuan already dragged his heavily wounded body and left step by step.

His brows furrowed together, unable to figure out how Ye Yuan provoked Big Brother Qin Tian.

But being eyed by Big Brother Qin Tian, Ye Yuan most likely could not escape this calamity.

In Qin Shao’s eyes, he was already matchless among peers.

It was true that Jia Chong’s strength was strong, but Qin Shao’s disparity with Jia Chong would only grow wider and wider!

But the feeling that Ye Yuan gave him was completely different. He had a feeling that Ye Yuan was bound to be a formidable foe of his in the future.

He needed such a powerful adversary!

Finally, Qin Shao sighed and slowly left.

Zhao Qin looked at Ye Yuan’s departing back view rather sympathetically and shook his head and said, “This kid seems to be rather extraordinary. It’s too bad that ... he provoked Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian!”

...

“Goodness me, my ancestor, how did you get injured like this? Who did this? Your brother, I, will help you to take revenge!”

Upon seeing Ye Yuan, Xie Jingyi’s entire person jumped up.

Ye Yuan said feebly, “Enough crap. Quickly help me in!”

Xie Jingyi hurriedly went up and helped Ye Yuan into the residence.

After returning to the residence, Ye Yuan swallowed two divine-grade medicinal pills before his injuries were gradually brought under control.

But the injuries this time were indeed rather heavy. Without eight to ten days, he could forget about recovering.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s condition turned a little better, Xie Jingyi said, “I say, it’s only been a few days of not seeing you. So how did you end up like this?”

Ye Yuan said huffily, “Cultivating in the Sword Tomb. Didn’t I tell you?”

Xie Jingyi’s neck involuntarily shrunk, and he said in surprise, “No way, right? Your way of cultivation is too dangerous! How is this cultivation? This is totally playing with life! Lord Fatty, I, still want to live a few days more. Better don’t go.”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to talk nonsense with this guy and asked, “Ask you about something. Do you know who Qin Tian is? Uh ... He should be a Qin Family’s person.”

Xie Jingyi looked at Ye Yuan with a strange look and said, “No way, right? You actually don’t even know who Qin Tian is?”

Ye Yuan said with a curious look, “Is he very famous? Why must I know him?”

Xie Jingyi looked at Ye Yuan as if he was looking at an alien and said, “More than just famous! It’s too famous, very famous! In the entire Wu Meng Capital City, virtually no one doesn’t know him, okay?!”

Ye Yuan’s brows creased, discovering that he seemed to have been eyed by some remarkable guy.

Xie Jingyi continued explaining, “Back then, Qin Tian was only 30 years old. Being just at the middle-stage Grotto Profound Realm, he obtained that session’s top dog! 150 years old, he already passed the personal disciple test, and became City Lord’s personal disciple! Now, virtually all of Wu Meng Capital City’s people feel that he can become the first powerhouse to break through to the Divine Lord Realm in 100 thousand years! Do you think he’s famous or not?”
