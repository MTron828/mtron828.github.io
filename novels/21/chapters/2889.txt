Chapter 2895 My Motives weren’t Pure to Begin With!

Your look when selling people earnestly is really quite handsome!

Yang Qing really wanted to yell: You bunch of morons were sold!

Everyone’s dumbfounded looks really made people look forward to it!

However, Ye Yuan already started selling people. This scene should be visible very soon.

Over there, Bloodpromise and Feng Xiaotian were currently fighting fiercely. But, hearing Ye Yuan’s words, what they were thinking in their hearts were different.

Bloodpromise was originally questioning Ye Yuan too, but hearing Ye Yuan’s explanation, he thought to himself that His Highness was indeed formidable!

No wonder he could become the Blood Divine Son.

While Feng Xiaotian was struck dumb with amazement in his heart, when did it become so easy to kill bloodkins?

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually used this sort of method to scam the blood race.

No idea how many of them had to die to kill one bloodkin. But Ye Yuan killed tens of thousands in one move!

Previously, Ye Yuan already entrapped 100 thousand bloodkins.

In a blink of an eye today, he entrapped another ten thousand.

However … it was really very satisfying! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

If the blood race could all be killed like this, how great would it be?

How many brothers would not need to die on the battlefield?

However, he naturally knew that this was just an extravagant hope. Closely following that, Ye Yuan sold again and again. Each time, he changed to a different direction.

But, without the slightest exception, they all went to places where the city protecting grand array was strong.

S

In the beginning, everyone felt that Ye Yuan was brilliant and mighty.

But gradually, they also sensed that something was not right.

In this short while, 40 to 50 thousand people had already died!

At this rate, everyone would be dead, and they might not even be able to probe where the grand array’s weak spots were.

“Your Highness, I’m afraid that this isn’t appropriate, right? Over 40 thousand people have already died, but it’s not working at all! At this rate, when will it end?”

The one speaking was a half-step Emperor Realm powerhouse. He was also the number one person in True Sovereign Hundred Sons, Xue Yi!

He clearly had this qualification to question Ye Yuan.

“Your Highness, we can’t carry on probing like this anymore!”

“Yeah, Your Highness, let’s attack the city!”

The moment Xue Yi opened his mouth, many people concurred.

They seriously could not look on anymore.

Over 180 thousand people were reduced to only 140 thousand in a short while!

These 40 thousand people could have killed a few thousand of South Qi’s people no matter what, right?

But now, they were dead without even harvesting anything!

“Are you questioning this liege? Or … are you all questioning this liege? How this liege does things, do I still need you all to teach?”

Ye Yuan shouted coldly. Those people immediately stopped speaking.

These days, Ye Yuan’s accumulated prestige was put into full play at this moment.

But Ye Yuan also knew that it would not last long anymore!

“That’s right, Your Highness’ move must have a profound meaning, I’ll support Your Highness!” Yang Qing also came forward in a timely manner at this time.

These words also won the approval of many people.

Ye Yuan still had quite the foundation in this

army.

Sure enough, these words immediately silenced the doubts.

“You, bring 3000 people to attack that spot!” Ye Yuan pointed at Xue Yi and said in a cold voice.

Xue Yi’s expression changed. His gaze when looking toward Ye Yuan was full of chilliness.

Previously, those True Sovereign Heavens’ strengths were ordinary. They were merely just some cannon fodders. If they died, then they died.

But, the True Sovereign Hundred Sons’ number one going to be the cannon fodder was somewhat overboard, right?

“What? You want to defy orders? Or do you not want to dedicate your life for our race at all?” Ye Yuan’s eyes also turned cold.

Xue Yi clenched his teeth tightly, his eyes bloodshot.

He had currently fallen into a dilemma.

Go, die!

Not going, still die!

Being confronted by a formidable enemy, defying the order that the Blood Divine Son gave, this was no joke!

“Fine, I’ll go! But I hope that I’m the last batch to go! If I die under the grand array, Your Highness, please attack the city! At this rate, our numbers won’t be able to take down South Qi anymore!” Xue Yi said in a solemn voice.

“Just you go! This liege has in mind what should be done! This liege is the Blood Divine Son, Wang Zuo’s successor. Could it be that I can still be helping the Heaven One Alliance?” Ye Yuan said with a cold snort.

At this time, Ye Yuan highlighted his identity as Wang Zuo’s successor, and this immediately suppressed Xue Yi’s provocation.

Yeah, what reason did Wang Zuo’s successor have to let himself fail in taking over the city?

This defeat would be a fatal blow to the Blood Divine Son’s reputation!

One had to know, the Blood Divine Son had not been officially conferred yet!

Xue Yi went!

Then he died!

These 3000 people were still completely wiped out.

Xue Yi’s strength naturally went without saying.

But, no matter how strong he was, the number of people he brought was also too few.

Facing the grand array and the Heaven One army, he could only take the road that led to death.

Yang Qing’s heart blossomed with joy. Xue Yi this damn thing was actually scammed to death by Ye Yuan just like this.

Hahahaha!

The hundred sons battle, this guy defeated him and even humiliated him on the stage!

Excited!

No matter how impressive you were, you were also not as impressive as Your Father’s bro!

Your Father’s brother could take your life with a word!

Yet, you could not do anything about it!

“You, go and try over there!” Ye Yuan pointed at another True Sovereign Hundred Son and said.

Just now, he made a lot of noise. Who would Ye Yuan target if not him?

That True Sovereign Hundred Son was dumbfounded.

Are you freaking … finished yet?!

This time, the questioning voices grew louder!

ni

Xue Yi’s words still stirred up many people’s nerves.

This battle had not yet been fought and several tens of thousands of people had already died.

It would be strange if they did not have any thoughts.

If Ye Yuan was not the rare Blood Divine Son, these bloodkins would have long revolted.

It was also that the Blood Divine Son’s awe-inspiring reputation was too great, coupled with Ye Yuan’s explosive performance before, that let Ye Yuan last until now.

That Hundred Son still went.

Then he still died!

After many True Sovereign Hundred Sons were scammed to death successively, Bloodpromise was finally the first to explode.

“Bloodazure, what are you doing? Over 50 thousand people had already died and you still haven’t started the battle! Your method doesn’t work, hurry up and attack the city!” Bloodpromise said angrily.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “How this liege does things, it’s still not your turn to come and point fingers and order me about!”

Bloodpromise said in a great fury, “Bullsh*t! I’m this army’s commander! This battle concerns the bigger picture. I can’t sit idly by and remain indifferent!”

Ye Yuan still said nonchalantly, “Who the hell do you think you are? To dare be so impudent to this liege?”

“Your Highness, this subordinate feels that what Lord Bloodpromise says is right! We should attack the city already!” The one speaking was Bloodage, Saint Sovereign’s number one.

With him taking the lead, the other hundred sons also came forward to oppose it.

“Your Highness, we should attack the city already!”

“Your Highness, can’t carry on probing like this!”

“Your Highness, if we still don’t attack the city, all the previous efforts will be wasted!”

… …

Even at this point, they still did not dare to question Ye Yuan easily, but they only urged him to attack the city.

But these people’s meaning was already very clear.

Ye Yuan pointed at Bloodage and said coolly, “You go!”

Bloodage’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a cold voice, “I’m not going!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned chilly and he said angrily, “You dare defy orders?”

Bloodage said with a cold snort, “Your Highness, Bloodage … has no choice but to defy orders! I want to ask, who else wants to go and be cannon fodder?”

Everyone was silent.

Clearly, Ye Yuan had already exhausted the last trace of his prestige.

This army did not have anyone who listened to him anymore.

However, he naturally did not care.

This was the result that he wanted in the first place.

“Your Highness, pardon Bloodage for being bold. Right now … I’m very doubtful of your motives!” Bloodage looked at Ye Yuan and said coldly.

The hundred sons did not have fools.

It was just that due to Ye Yuan’s identity, no one dared to come forward and question him.

But now, things had already developed to this stage. They had no choice but to come forward and oppose Ye Yuan already.

These people naturally would not be stupid until they would only understand after Ye Yuan killed everyone.

Originally, Ye Yuan’s gaze when looking at Bloodage was very angry. But suddenly, he grinned and said, “Don’t need to doubt it. What you’re thinking is correct! My motives weren’t pure to begin with!”
