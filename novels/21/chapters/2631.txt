Chapter 2637: Matching Powers!

“Shi Feiyu! You old fogey, how can you be so shameless!”

In the midst of fierce fighting, when Feng Xuanyi saw this scene, he immediately burned with fury.

Normally, when Shi Feiyu targeted Ye Yuan, although it was inappropriate in his eyes, it was also just a dispute caused by personal feelings.

But now, during the sect’s time of crisis, he actually did this kind of despicable thing. It was truly shameless to the extreme.

“Shi Feiyu, if you want to seek death, I won’t stop you, but I, Shi Feiyu, don’t want to die!”

Shi Feiyu laughed coldly and smacked a palm toward Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, his expression changed, his entire body going numb and divine essence immediately became sluggish.

Hundred Poison Formation!

More than 20 years had passed. Ye Yuan’s Hundred Poison Formation became several times stronger than back then!

Ye Yuan had unlocked Zhong Jianchou’s jade slips. There was a dazzling array of methods of using poison inside, greatly broadening Ye Yuan’s horizon.

These poisons were added into the poison formation by Ye Yuan, its power multiplying!

Even Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses would succumb too!

When Huangfu Cloudthink saw this scene, he did not reveal a look of surprise. He had long known that Ye Yuan had this move.

This guy was not easy to capture at all.

“The power of this Hundred Poison Formation increased significantly again! Although it isn’t lethal to Jade Sovereign Heavens, they will probably have to stagnate for three to five breaths of time!” Hundred Poison Formation exclaimed in admiration.

Back then when Ye Yuan was at Cloudarch Great Nation, the Hundred Poison Formation could only stop Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses for half a breath of time.

Now, the power grew by at least three to five times!

Just as Huangfu Cloudthink was gasping in admiration, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body suddenly skyrocketed.

A grayish-black small mountain suspended in his palm.

Huangfu Cloudthink’s gaze turned intent and he cried out in surprise, “Heavenly spirit treasure!”

This small mountain was naturally the Heavenspan Mountain.

At this point, Ye Yuan also did not have anything to hide anymore.

Shi Feiyu wanted to kill him time and again. Now, he was even shameless to the extreme, Ye Yuan naturally would not hold back.

The Hundred Poison Formation could only stop Shi Feiyu for three to five breaths of time, but to Ye Yuan, it was sufficient!

Feeling the Heavenspan Mountain’s powerful undulations, Shi Feiyu’s expression changed abruptly.

How could he expect that Ye Yuan actually still had this level of weapon on him!

Ye Yuan did not even give him time to be surprised, the spell in his hand trembled and the Heavenspan Mountain turned into a streak of flowing light, smashing right towards Shi Feiyu!

The power of the Heavenspan Mountain was even a notch above the Heaven Killing Battlespear.

Although Ye Yuan could not unleash all of its power, it was enough to inflict severe injuries on the Shi Feiyu who was completely unguarded!

Boom!

Shi Feiyu’s chest took a solid hit, his entire being flying out backward, fresh blood spurting wildly.

His cultivation realm was high and his powers were profound. Otherwise, this blow could have taken his old life.

But even so, he suffered heavy wounds too, as if his internal organs had been displaced.

But Ye Yuan was clearly not prepared to let him off. The remaining time was still enough for Ye Yuan to launch another attack!

“D-Don’t! Elder Ye, I was wrong! I was really wrong!”

Shi Feiyu was utterly terrified, feeling the threat of death.

But Ye Yuan ignored him and just silently made his move.

Boom!

Another blow!

Shi Feiyu’s chest directly caved in.

When everyone saw this scene, each of them was dumbfounded.

A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum bashed a Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum to heavy injuries!

This scene was too shocking!

Forget about a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, even if it was a thousand Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratums, it was also impossible to be a Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum’s match!

The gap between Sublime Stratum and Sovereign Stratum was not small.

But Ye Yuan inflicted heavy wounds on Shi Feiyu to this extent!

Shi Feiyu begged for mercy pitifully, but there was no compassion on Ye Yuan’s face at all.

Due to being seriously injured, Shi Feiyu’s speed of detoxifying the poison also became much slower.

And Ye Yuan was currently launching the third attack! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Know how to beg for mercy now? Don’t you normally jump around very merrily? No need to look at him. Do you really think that the Pill Alliance will come to save you at this time? Elder Shi, are you thinking too much?” Ye Yuan said calmly.

Shi Feiyu looked with pleading eyes at Huangfu Cloudthink, but the latter did not have the intention of rescuing at all.

Clearly, Ye Yuan grasped Huangfu Cloudthink’s mentality very well.

To Huangfu Cloudthink, Shi Feiyu was merely a tool to probe Ye Yuan.

Now, Ye Yuan showed his trump card. Huangfu Cloudthink’s goal was also achieved.

Shi Feiyu became useless too.

If he died, then he died!

Huangfu Cloudthink’s attitude made Shi Feiyu despair.

If he had long known it would be like this, might as well have risked his life!

“Elder Ye, I was wrong! It was all my fault in my past! Let me off! I’ll go and fight it out to the death with the Pill Alliance’s people!” Shi Feiyu said with an indignant look.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “No need. Currently in this situation, having you or missing you is inconsequential. You set out on your journey first. Remember to run faster. Otherwise, if the sect’s people come, you’ll probably have to die again!”

Boom!

As he said, Ye Yuan urged the Heavenspan Mountain again and smashed toward Shi Feiyu.

Attacking for more than ten times in a row, Shi Feiyu finally died completely.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces could not help changing.

A Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum was smashed to death just like that!

This Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum was really scary!

But right at this time, Huangfu Cloudthink’s expression changed and his figure suddenly moved!

It was only to see him tap the void in the direction of his own people, the void trembled violently!

However, it was already too late!

A large swathe of the Pill Alliance’s Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum and Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses died all at once.

Huangfu Cloudthink’s gaze turned dark, and he said in a cold voice, “You boy, are really a genius! This Hundred Poison Formation utilizes spatial rule to be as elusive as a ghost. Even this alliance chief still fell for your trick in the end! However, you don’t have a chance anymore!”

Turns out that when Ye Yuan was bashing Shi Feiyu to death, he already quietly revolved the Hundred Poison Formation and quietly moved it to this side through spatial rule.

This Hundred Poison Formation was colorless and odorless. It was extremely difficult to distinguish.

But it clearly could not escape Huangfu Cloudthink’s eyes.

It was just that, he was also stunned by Ye Yuan killing Shi Feiyu just now, that was why he overlooked it.

Even if he had been keeping an eye out for Ye Yuan’s Hundred Poison Formation all along, Ye Yuan still succeeded.

Ye Yuan just said indifferently,?“Oh,?is that so? Hundred Poison Formation, spread!”

It was only to see him pointing in the void. Everyone was uncertain what it meant.

Because at the place where Ye Yuan pointed was completely void of anything.

As if nothing happened at all.

But Huangfu Cloudthink’s expression changed greatly!

Because he felt this Hundred Poison Formation scatter all at once, becoming one miniature poison formation after another, dispersing in all directions.

Furthermore, each miniature poison formation had spatial rule concealing its figure.

The power of these miniature poison formations naturally could not compare to the large-scale poison formation, the damage it dealt toward Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses was negligible.

But, it was tremendously harmful to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum and Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses!

Suddenly, a large swathe of the powerhouses on the Pill Alliance’s side collapsed loosely!

“What are you all still in a daze for? Everyone, listen up! Break out of the encirclement! After getting out of the mountain, escape in all directions! Remember not to stop! As long as the green hills remain, there’ll always be wood to burn!” Ye Yuan shouted coldly, reverberating throughout the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.
