1381 Counting Charges in Detai

In a blind angle of the alley, a figure slowly appeared.

This was a middle-aged man, his bearing extraordinary. It was clear that he was an expert at a glance.

Ye Yuan did not recognize him either. But this person had been following close to him all along, starting from when he entered the Wu Meng Academy.

This person did not have ill-intentions. Ye Yuan guessed that the other party might have been sent by the Myriad Treasure Tower to protect him.

When Wang Song saw this middle-aged man, his expression could not help changing drastically!

“T-Teacher Chi! Why ... Why are you here?”

Wang Song never thought that the Myriad Treasure Tower would actually deploy an Origin Deity powerhouse to come and protect Ye Yuan!

Just what origins did this Ye Yuan have?

The middle-aged man came to Ye Yuan’s side and gave a self-introduction, “I’m called Chi Fang, a teacher of the academy. But I’m very surprised you could actually discover my existence. When did you discover it?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Right from the start.”

Chi Fang concealed himself very well, but how could he hide from Dustless’s eyes and ears?

Chi Fang’s expression turned stiff when he heard that. He was confident that he concealed his being very well, so he did not think that Ye Yuan had long discovered him.

Now, he finally had some understanding of why Tower Lord made him come and protect Ye Yuan.

“Alright, leave them to me, you go,” Chi Fang said coolly.

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly and said, “Many thanks! I’ll also request Teacher Chi to inform Tower Lord, ask him to come forward and mediate this matter. Just say that ... this Ye owes him a favor.”

Chi Fang’s gaze turned intent, and he said with a nod, “You can rest assured, I’ll definitely pass on the message.”

Wu Meng Academy was naturally the city lord’s Wu Meng Academy. But it was naturally impossible for the city lord to manage the academy and the capital city by himself.

Therefore, the city lord also had many things that needed to rely on these major families.

Among them, also included the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Although the Myriad Treasure Tower was an outside force, this force could not be underestimated either.

In this Wu Meng Academy, there was naturally the Myriad Treasure Tower’s share too.

“Get lost!” Ye Yuan came in front of Wang Song and said in a cold voice.

This bunch of trash already delayed a lot of his time. He was very annoyed.

Wang Song’s expression flickered incessantly. He finally managed to seize this opportunity, did not expect that it was actually this result.

“Mn? Could it be that you still want me to personally take action?”

Chi Fang’s voice turned grim. The pressure of an Origin Deity Realm instantly spread out, crushing everyone until they could not catch their breath.

Especially Jia Chong, because he was only at the Grotto Profound Realm. How could he withstand such pressure? He actually knelt down with a thud.

He was currently facing Ye Yuan, looking just like he was kneeling down to Ye Yuan.

Although extremely unwilling, Wang Song still moved half a position away.

Ye Yuan did not have time to be long-winded with them. His figure moved, directly speeding away.

The moment Ye Yuan left, Chi Fang’s cultivation realm oppression instantly dissipated into nothing.

Wang Song’s face fell, and he said, “Teacher Chi, it’s ... against the rules for you to be like this. I will report this matter to Uncle Qin!”

Chi Fang said coolly, “By all means! But ... you should also be grateful that I have this identity of the academy’s teacher. Otherwise, you’d already been dead now!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Song’s expression turned fearful. Chi Fang’s figure moved and disappeared.

The dignity of an Origin Deity powerhouse could not be profaned.

Just based on Wang Song’s this one sentence, Chi Fang already had sufficient reason to kill him.

Although Wang Song was considered half of the Qin Family’s son-in-law, killing such a person with Chi Fang’s identity, it could not stir up much of a wave either.

However, Chi Fang was still a teacher at the academy. If he made a move against his own student, it would be hard to explain.

At that time, who he offended would not just be the Qin Family, but Wu Meng City Lord!

...

Wu Meng plaza was the largest plaza in Wu Meng Capital City. Currently, it was surrounded until water could not seep through.

There was a high platform in the middle of the plaza. The two figures on the platform were very conspicuous.

Ye Yuan divided the crowd and finally managed to squeeze to the front.

Not seeing for a year, Little Fatty seemed to have become fatter.

But currently, Little Fatty was dressed in ragged clothing, looking like a beggar.

On his face and body, whip marks were distinct and clear, deep until the flesh was visible!

But Xie Jingyi did not mind at all, as he said in a clear voice, “I believe everyone isn’t a stranger to this whore. She’s the Qin Family’s young lady, Qin Peiyu, known as demoness! The sins that she has committed doesn’t need me to say, I believe everyone would also have heard of it, or even experienced it personally before! Everyone is afraid of her identity and doesn’t dare to do anything to her. But Lord Fatty, I, don’t believe in heresy. Lord Fatty, I, am going to carry out justice on heaven’s behalf today!”

“Alright!”

Xie Jingyi’s words immediately incurred an earth-shaking response.

Qin Nantian spoiled this daughter terribly, resulting in her becoming infamous as a tyrant in the entire capital city.

It was just that everyone normally dared to get angry, but no one dared to speak.

Now, with someone bearing the brunt of the attack, their constantly suppressed emotions immediately erupted.

Slap! Slap! Slap!

Xie Jingyi directly gave a few slaps, arousing a series of applause once more.

Qin Peiyu’s eyes were spitting fire, and she said in extreme rage, “Damn fatty, you ... you’re dead for sure! The things that you’ve done to this young lady today, I’ll definitely repay it a hundred-fold to you!”

Xie Jingyi looked at her with a smirk and did not say anything. Reaching his hand out, it was another few slaps.

“Speak, what else is there, say it all!” Xie Jingyi said with a laugh.

With this, Qin Peiyu completely lost her wits to show any temper. She did not dare to say any more harsh words and could only glare at Xie Jingyi.

“Heh, that’s more like it!”

Xie Jingyi laughed lightly, turned around, and said to the plaza in a clear voice, “50 years ago, this whore was eight years old! She snatched the foot in the hands of a child surnamed Rong on the streets and got into a conflict with the child, and made people exterminate the entire Rong Family!”

Slap! Slap! Slap!

Finished talking, Xie Jingyi casually gave a few slaps. Qin Peiyu’s pretty face swelled up very quickly.

“47 years ago, this whore gave free rein to her horse on Elegant Water Street and trampled a little girl under three years old to death!”

Slap! Slap! Slap!

Finished talking, he flung his hand, and it was another few slaps!

...

Just like this, Xie Jingyi carefully detailed Qin Peiyu’s these few years of crimes that had utter disregard for human life one by one.

Each time he said finish one, he would throw a few slaps.

Very soon, Qin Peiyu was slapped into a pig’s head once more!

At the start, everyone was still hooting and cheering.

But later on, the expressions on their faces all became rage!

The crimes that this demoness committed were simply too numerous to be recorded.

Ye Yuan was also secretly shocked when he heard. At the start, he only thought that this little girl was unruly and willful. He did not expect that Qin Peiyu, such a young girl, was actually cruel and cold-hearted to this extent!

At the same time, Ye Yuan also viewed Xie Jingyi in a different light.

This little fatty normally looked very frivolous when doing things. Did not expect that once he took something seriously, he actually did it so beautifully and meticulously!

This one year’s time, Little Fatty practically dug this Qin Peiyu inside out.

Ye Yuan originally thought that Little Fatty was just acting on impulse. Did not expect that his preparations were actually so ample.

This play today looked reckless, but in reality, it was somewhat refined in its crude ways.

He made the commotion blow up so big, attracting the attention of everyone in the city. Then listed Qin Peiyu’s crimes one by one for everyone to hear. Not only did this make the Qin Family cautious in taking action for fear of damages and not dare to act rashly without careful thought, it even occupied the commanding ground on morals!

Even if the Qin Family wanted to make trouble, they also did not dare to talk about Little Fatty’s fault in front of so many people’s faces!
