Chapter 2215: Chaos Samsara Pill!

“R-Run an errand? Do my ears have a problem?”

“High Priest Stardrive is a true pinnacle major power. Making him come and run an errand ...”

“Everyone says that Ye Yuan is the Priest Temple’s Second Sage. I even thought that it was merely nominal. I didn’t expect that ... his status is actually so high!”

... ...

The Southern Border Alliance’s Seven-star Alchemy Gods all opened their mouths wide, looking at Ye Yuan in extreme shock.

This sort of thing seriously subverted their understanding too much.

High Priest Stardrive was a late-stage Eight-star super existence. He had a status that tipped the scales in the entire alchemy world.

Such a major power, they did not have the good fortune to meet in their lifetimes too.

But such a major power was actually just here to run an errand?

However, the following scene affirmed their thoughts even more.

High Priest Stardrive gave a respectful bow towards Ye Yuan and said, “Ji Mo offers greetings to Second Sage!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, but his gazes glimmered.

Seeing Ji Mo this time, he was even more unfathomable than the previous time.

“I’ve troubled you to make a trip!” Ye Yuan said.

Ji Mo smiled and said, “No trouble. It is only ought to be.”

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “Congratulations to Brother Ji Mo for making great improvements in strength!”

Ji Mo also grinned and gave another bow and said, “Coming over this time, it’s precisely to thank Second Sage!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Thank what? Being able to comprehend things, that’s your lucky chance.”

These two people’s conversations made everyone stunned again.

Concerning High Priest Stardrive’s strength advancing greatly, why did he have to thank Ye Yuan?

Could it be that Ye Yuan was already strong to the degree that he could casually give pointers to High Priest Stardrive?

This ... How was this possible?

However, some Empyreans were well-informed people. Their gazes flickered, seemingly recalling something.

A grandmaster said, “I heard that Ye Yuan solved the Eternal Chess Game ‘Ask Not’ in the Westspirit Region back then. It was High Priest Stardrive who brought it over! With Ye Yuan solving the game, High Priest Stardrive was watching by the side, he likely gleaned considerable gains!”

“There’s actually really such a thing?! That Eternal Chess Game ‘Ask Not’, I’ve also heard of it before. That’s the showdown between the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest. Someone like Ye Yuan can break the deadlock too?”

That grandmaster sighed and said, “Originally, this Empyrean naturally didn’t believe it too. But ... High Priest Stardrive came personally. So this matter naturally won’t be fake.”

The Demon Clan was too far from the human race in the end. There were naturally missing pieces of information when the news came over.

Hence, toward these news, these Empyreans were naturally half-dubious.

Especially that they viewed Ye Yuan’s strength as being meager. How could he possibly crack the chess game where Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest faced off?

It was just that looking at it today, this matter really could not be any more real!

“Brother Ji Mo, have you brought the things that I want?” Ye Yuan said.

Ji Mo nodded slightly and said, “Receiving Second Sage’s news, Ji Mo did not dare to stop for a second and gathered the spirit medicines and rushed over.”

As he said, Ji Mo took a storage ring out and said, “What Second Sage needs, I will do it on your behalf.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I’ll have to trouble you.”

Ye Yuan’s body did not have divine essence and could not even open the storage ring at all. Hence, that was why he needed Ji Mo to do it on his behalf.

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around and said to Empyrean Pilljade, “Just now, you said that I’m trash?”

Empyrean Pilljade’s expression flickered incessantly. What kind of eyesight did he have? He naturally saw through Ye Yuan’s actual situation with one glance.

The current Ye Yuan, his small world had already collapsed. He was unable to accommodate divine essence at all.

This kind of person, what was he if not trash?

No matter how strong the Formation Dao, what was the use if one could not cultivate?

He smiled coldly and said, “Could it be that what this Empyrean said is wrong?”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “Pilljade, today, I’ll let you see who’s the trash! From today onward, I, Ye Yuan, have the final say in the Southern Border’s alchemy world!”

Pilljade was startled inwardly! Could it be that this boy really had some method and could recover?

But, with his small world crumbling, even if Medicine Ancestor came, it would be difficult to repair too, right?

Not waiting for him to react yet, Ye Yuan’s fingertips flicked out like phantoms. One array formation after another constructed in the void.

Seeing his appearance, who still did not know that Ye Yuan wanted to refine pills?

They all knew that he was using Formation Dao Pill Refinement, but what kind of medicinal pill was Ye Yuan going to refine to be able to let himself recover?

However, the brilliance of Ye Yuan’s technique and complexity of the array formations made everyone secretly alarmed.

The array formations that Ye Yuan set up, they had not seen a single one before!

“Ten Absolute Heavenly Hu!” Suddenly, Ye Yuan called out loudly.

Ji Mo flicked his fingers, a spirit medicine flew towards the array formation.

Swish!

The spirit medicine entered the formation and immediately turned into a pile of powder. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

But the movements of Ye Yuan’s hands did not stop and was still laying formations frenziedly.

“Unreasonable Azure Spirit Fruit!”

“Ancient Orchid Earthsun Gold!”

... ...

Ye Yuan’s mouth uttered the name of one rank seven spirit medicine after another from time to time.

These rank seven spirit medicines were all incomparably precious.

It was very difficult for Ye Yuan to want to gather them. Therefore, that was why he informed the Priest Temple to have Ji Mo deliver them.

Ji Mo sent the spirit medicines into the array formation very cooperatively. They were refined in the formation.

But no one knew what he was doing.

Even the strange hue in Ji Mo’s gaze also gradually thickened.

With his vision, he actually could not understand what Ye Yuan was doing!

When pills entered rank seven, it was extremely rare for people to go and refine pills with Formation Dao anymore.

Concerning the complexity involved, ordinary people could not imagine it at all.

Furthermore, there was no one that had used Ye Yuan’s method to refine pills with Formation Dao.

Formation Dao Pill Refinement was done by setting up all the array formations, and then placing the spirit medicines inside, and letting the array formation complete the refinement process by itself

But Ye Yuan was refining the spirit medicines stalk by stalk.

This kind of method, they had never seen before at all!

But every spirit medicine as well as the portion that Ye Yuan sent into the array formation, those Seven-star Alchemy Gods all learned it deeply by heart.

What if this was an incredible medicinal pill?

It was just that they did not think about it, Ye Yuan dared to refine the pill in front of so many of them, how could he be afraid of them secretly learning?

Empyrean Pilljade sneered coldly and said with disdain, “The medicinal theory is utter rubbish. His array formations are too many and disorderly! What kind of bullshit medicinal pill can such an array formation refine?”

By the side, Empyrean Windrider also nodded and said, “With his small world crumbling apart, it’s simply beyond redemption! In my view, this boy is merely talking big to impress people.”

The array formation grew more and more massive, and increasingly complex.

A high building rose from the ground. It was as if Ye Yuan was using building blocks to construct a skyscraper.

This building took ten days and nights!

At this time, half the sky was filled with stars, as if Ye Yuan embedded the stars into the sky; exquisitely beautiful!

Ye Yuan flicked his fingers, shooting toward a corner of the array formation.

“Formation rise, pill condense!”

Clank!

With a crisp sound, the entire array formation seemed to have come to life all of a sudden.

Rumble!

The void trembled. Endless light radiated out.

The entire array formation suddenly seemed to have come to life. Incomparably shocking aura burst forth.

Ji Mo’s expression changed wildly, and he cried out in shock, “This ... This is the aura of a complete world! Second Sage used array formations and constructed a complete world!”

“Chaos Samsara Pill, condense!”

Rumble!

All of a sudden, light converged swiftly, a medicinal pill that radiated golden light suspended above the void quietly.
