Chapter 1883: A Shot Arrow Has No Way of Recalling

Bang!

A horrifying enormous wave rippled out. Ye Yuan actually could not stand still and was directly flung flying out.

A phantom gradually condensed and formed in the center of the hall.

“Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove!” Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, recognizing the phantom very quickly.

It was just that the aura of this phantom was entirely different from what was seen outside.

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang did not do anything and just quietly watched.

That appearance was as if everything was within control.

To a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, there was already nothing that could make their countenance visibly moved.

Let alone that Immortal Grove was just an Empyrean powerhouse and even an Empyrean powerhouse who was dead.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove did not see Ye Yuan, there was only Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang in his eyes.

“Jiu Shang, you indeed came!”

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang smiled slightly and said, “Didn’t you cause such a big commotion for me to come? Now that I’m here, what can you do to me?”

To him, he could make the Immortal Grove World turn to ashes with a wave of his hand. He did not fear a dead person at all.

Immortal Grove smiled coldly and said, “Is that so? Then ... wouldn’t you know after trying it out?! Today, the grudge between you and me should also have a conclusion!”

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang said coolly, “Merely a wisp of remnant soul, to also dare utter such wild ravings, truly don’t know what you’re talking about! This World Suppressing Stele, I’ll take it first.”

Done talking, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang took a step out. His aura suddenly changed, an apocalyptic aura reverberated within the entire palace.

Not far away, Ye Yuan immediately felt palpitation.

Under this horrifying pressure, he could not even move a muscle!

“Is ... Is this the power of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse? S-So strong!”

Although Ye Yuan’s Empyrean-class strength was horrifying, he had witnessed before Qiao Yuan and the rest taking action. That was at least still within the boundaries of normal people’s understanding.

But now, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang merely released the pressure from his body and it made the entire world tremble.

This kind of power already surpassed the scope of his understanding.

Inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, Dustless said, “Heavenly Emperor powerhouses already transcended samsara and aren’t within the Five Elements! Their strength, ordinary people are completely unable to comprehend it. Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s tiny bit of pressure, he didn’t use his full strength. Otherwise, the Immortal Grove World can’t withstand it at all.”

Ye Yuan’s expression was incomparably ugly. The matter this time already surpassed his control.

All along, Ye Yuan had always moved after planning it out.

But this time, the events that exceeded his predictions were too many.

Right now, the powerhouses inside the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace, even if placed in the Heavenspan World, they were already at the apex level.

But presently, it appeared within a small world where Heavenly Dao was lacking and incomplete.

As long as these two people made a move, the entire Immortal Grove World would surely crumble.

“Immortal Grove, what in the world do you want to do? This place is the small world that you created single-handedly! Could it be that you’re going to watch it collapse unfeelingly?” Ye Yuan used all of the strength in his body and roared furiously at Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s gaze finally looked towards this side, coldly.

“Do what? Of course it’s taking revenge! This Empyrean roamed unobstructed throughout heaven and earth, only a step away from stepping into the realm of Heavenly Emperor, but it was all ruined in the hands of this accursed thing! Not avenging this enmity, this Empyrean Realm can’t die in peace!” Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s eyes were actually full of the wrath of hatred.

Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and said, “Why? WHY! Your enmity, I’ll help you avenge it one day! Why do you have to draw him to the Immortal Grove World?”

The current Ye Yuan billowed with flames of fury.

One could say that for him to be able to have today’s accomplishments, it was entirely thanks to Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

As long as his strength was sufficient, he would definitely take revenge for Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

But now, matters actually developed to such a step.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove gave Ye Yuan a meaningful glance and said coolly, “Kid, you obtained my inheritance, but the strength of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses isn’t what you can imagine! Five million years ago, I already arranged everything today. Today, it’s time to make a clean break!”

Clearly, he had long seen through that Ye Yuan was his successor.

Except, he did not care at all. He schemed five million years for the sake of today.

“Sigh ...”

A long sigh sounded out, Dustless’s figure appeared.

The Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove who had always been cold finally showed a trace of visible change in countenance.

“Dustless! You woke up!”

Dustless gave Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove a glance and said with a sigh, “I originally thought that my slumber and Jiang Hun’s death was caused by your battle with Jiu Shang. Looking at it now, it wasn’t the case!”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s pupils constricted, the muscles on his face actually twinged.

“I ... I’m not reconciled to it! Not avenging this enmity, I can’t die with my eyes closed! Compared to my grudge, what does the small world count for? What do empyrean spirit treasures count for?”

But Dustless smiled and said, “There’s no cause for much criticism for you to do so. Jiang Hun and I were born because of you. It’s just that this time, you were really wrong! Ye Yuan’s potential is even greater than you imagined!”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s eyes turned sharp and could not help sizing Ye Yuan up once more.

He arranged for five million years for the sake of this setup today. But the world is constantly changing all the time, the things that could change in five million years were too many.

He would not have expected that he would have a successor who surpassed his predecessor, let alone think that this successor would actually arrive before him on this day when the grand scheme took shape.

And currently, monstrous waves stirred up in Ye Yuan’s heart too.

Jiang Hun who was mentioned by Dustless was likely the artifact spirit of the World Suppressing Stele!

Ye Yuan had always been puzzled why the World Suppressing Stele had an artifact spirit, while the World Suppressing Stele did not.

Come to think of it, turned out that the artifact spirit died!

Furthermore, Jiang Hun’s death had a direct relation to Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove!

All along, Ye Yuan had also always thought that Dustless’s slumber was also caused by Jiu Shang.

But looking at it now, it was simply due to Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove extracting the power of these two might peak empyrean spirit treasures.

If not for encountering him, Dustless might have to keep on slumbering.

“Huhu, you and I have lived together for so many years, you should be very familiar with me! I only believe in myself!” Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove suddenly laughed and said.

He turned to Ye Yuan again and said, “Kid, you shouldn’t have come on this trip!”

Ye Yuan’s expression was extremely ugly as he roared furiously, “I was born here, grew up here, my parents and friends are all here! Now, you want to personally destroy this place, can I ... not come?”

“Huhu, boy, you’re still too tender! The path of cultivation is destined to be lonely! So what if father and mother, so what if friends? If they can’t cultivate to the apex realm, they will similarly pass away! Only oneself is eternal!” Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove laughed loudly and said.

Crack, crack, crack ...

Fine cracks started appearing in the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace’s space.

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s aura became stronger and stronger.

“Heh, Immortal Grove, let me take a look at what you prepared for this emperor by spending five million years!” Jiu Shang said with a laugh.

Immortal Grove’s expression turned cold and he said, “A shot arrow has no way of recalling! Boy, hope for the best for yourself!”
