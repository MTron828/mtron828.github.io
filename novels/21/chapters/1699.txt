Chapter 1703 Because Your Eyes Didn“t Go Blind!

“This little brother, I see that your bones are special and you’re unusually endowed with talent, but you have an ominous sign! Quick, let me divine for you and help you resolve this disaster!”

“This little brother, this seat is a Jian Family’s direct lineage successor. I see that your glabella is dark. There must be a great calamity recently! Quickly come to my place and this old man will teach you the method to resolve it.”

“High as mountains and long as rivers, exposed to the winds and rains in travel, Little brother, you’re here to find someone, right?”

...

Within Extreme Light Imperial City, it had a totally unique atmosphere.

Ye Yuan walked on the streets, feeling like he entered a base camp of conmen and fortunetellers. There was someone pulling him to go divine his fortunes non-stop.

Some people said it was too profound to understand, making it really seem like the case at first glance.

“These guys are also too obvious in swindling and bluffing people, right? Will there really be this kind of idiot who will fall for it?” Ye Yuan was speechless as he said to Dustless.

But Dustless said, “You’re mistaken. They aren’t swindling or bluffing.”

Ye Yuan was surprised when he heard that and said, “No? Could it be that they can really fortune-tell?”

Dustless nodded and said, “They naturally can! Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ skill is involved in good fortune. These people peddling on the streets, most have the Jian Family’s bloodline. It’s just thinner. A person whose destiny is too flourishing, they can’t divine it. But how can there be so many people with exuberant destinies? The vast majority of the people are merely mortals. Us cultivators are the most sensitive to matters of good or ill luck and weal or woe. Some martial artists will specifically make a trip to Extreme Light Imperial City before entering a mystic realm to divine their fortunes. How can they come into contact with members of the Jian Family? These people naturally become their first choice. Although it might not be accurate, it can more or less still achieve the goal of pursuing good fortune and avoiding disasters.”

Ye Yuan was also extremely surprised when he heard that, not expecting that there was still so much involved in this.

These people looked too debased. Hence, it gave him a very unreliable feeling.

He did not expect that these people actually all had some skill.

Ye Yuan was also secretly shocked in his heart. Just how powerful was this Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets? Even just getting tainted by a tiny bit of bloodline and they could have such divination and scrying skills.

No wonder the martial artists in Extreme Light Imperial City were so many. It turned out that they were all aiming for the aura viewing art.

Different from Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, the majority inside Extreme Light Imperial City were clearly foreign martial artists.

Divine Lord Realm powerhouses could be seen everywhere on the streets.

Using Divine Lords walking all over the place to describe was also not the least bit of exaggeration.

“These people should know where the Profound Secrets Pavilion is. Let’s go over and ask,” Ye Yuan said to Ning Tianping.

At this time, a shy little girl came up to greet and said to Ye Yuan weakly, “Sir, fortune-telling? Come to our house, my father still has quite a bit of attainment in the path of divining fortunes.”

Ye Yuan originally had no plans of divining fortunes and was just asking for directions. But this little girl had a pitiful appearance, Ye Yuan somewhat did not have the heart to do so.

“Then ... fortune-tell then! Tianping, you go,” Ye Yuan said.

Ning Tianping froze and pointed at himself as he said in surprise, “I-I go?”

Ye Yuan scolded with a smile, “Ask you to go, just go, what’s with the nonsense?”

Ning Tianping nodded and said, “Okay!”

These stalls were all placed on the streets and could be seen everywhere. One look and it was clear that the level was very low.

Not far ahead, there were still shop fronts that also had signboards that wrote augury and aura viewing on it. Clearly, they were much more high-end.

At these stalls, everyone was calling out, vying to pull people to come and fortune-tell.

Those who dared to yell, the business was all pretty good too.

Rather, this little girl’s home was deserted, with nobody showing any interest. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Clearly, the people setting up stalls on the streets, their bloodline were all extremely thin, even the Jian Family would not acknowledge.

They were forced to make a living. That was why they did this kind of thing.

Otherwise, with Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s prestige, they would not be reduced to such a plight.

Ye Yuan went over to take a look, this little girl’s father was actually a cripple. Even walking was somewhat difficult, no wonder he would let a timid little girl go to the streets to pull people.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he stepped forward and said with clasped hands, “Elderly person, give this little brother of mine a good aura viewing and divination.”

This old geezer was very haggard, his face with the vicissitudes of life. Seeing that there were guests, he barely managed to squeeze out a smile and said to Ning Tianping, “Please sit! I wonder what this little brother is testing?”

Ning Tianping said, “We came to Extreme Light Imperial City to find people. Elder, just help me to test whether this trip will go well or not!”

That old man nodded his head, fished out a tortoise shell, and started to infuse divine essence[1].

A profound divine essence aura spread out, Ye Yuan could not help shaking his head inwardly.

The mysterious aura on this old man was far too weak. Compared to Jian Zhentao, it was simply one up in the heavens, the other down on Earth. No wonder they would end up in such a plight.

The old man fiddled for a bit, his brows could not help furrowing, and he said, “This little brother, pardon this old man for being blunt, but your trip ... likely won’t go too well. However, you have the help of a noble lord, all troubles can be easily resolved.”

Ning Tianping laughed when he heard that and said, “Haha, then that’s good! Elder, how much?”

As he said, Ning Tianping was about to pay up, but Ye Yuan’s heart stirred and he asked, “Elder, since you know the art of viewing auras, help me take a look at how my brother’s destiny is.”

The old man nodded his head and mustered up divine essence once more, looking over toward Ning Tianping.

With this look, his expression could not help changing and he shook his head and said, “Two little brothers, pardon this one for being ignorant, but I truly can’t see through the two of your destinies.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Say whatever there is, don’t need to be apprehensive.”

The old man’s expression was somewhat ugly as he said, “Then ... alright! This little brother, his destiny is exuberant. This old man’s strength is meager and can’t see through it. But with this old man’s experience, his destiny likely won’t be lower than cyan!”

Ning Tianping was also overjoyed when he heard that. Cyan destiny was already a very high-level destiny.

The vast majority of martial artists were only yellow destiny and below.

Looks like ever since encountering His Excellency, his destiny became much more booming!

Ning Tianping asked, “Then what about ... my lord’s?”

Seeing Ning Tianping ask, the old man’s expression became even uglier and he said, “This little brother ... has no color. It’s likely ... unranked!”

The old man looked towards Ye Yuan and there was nothing exciting. The aura viewing art could not stir up a trace of wave at all.

He had inspected countless people and had never seen before such a poorly endowed person.

“Hahaha! A trash who can’t even enter the ranks actually dares to come and fortune-tell too! I say, kid, do you still want face or not?”

Suddenly, a burst of loud laughter sounded out. A young man brought several guards and slowly walked over, a mocking expression on his face.

The little girl’s expression changed and she hurriedly pushed Ye Yuan away, saying anxiously, “Sir, s-sorry, you hurry up and go!”

Ye Yuan was naturally not what she could push. He looked at that young master with furrowed brows and said coolly, “You also know the art of viewing auras?”

That young man seemed to have heard some hilarious joke and said with a big laugh, “I also know? Are you joking? This young master, Jian Yu, is a direct lineage descendant of the Jian Family, do you think I know or not?”

Ye Yuan came to a realization and said, “Then do you think that my destiny can’t enter the ranks?”

Jian Yu said disdainfully, “Rubbish! This young master used the art of viewing auras to look just now, a stretch of stagnant waters! This young master has never seen before a person with such inferior aptitude. Aren’t you getting lost in your head there?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then your aura viewing level is too lousy, your skill is still lacking!”

Jian Yu’s expression changed and he said in a cold voice, “Who the hell do you think you are, to dare evaluate this young master’s aura viewing art?”

As the Jian Family’s direct lineage descendant, Jian Yu was extremely confident in his aura viewing art. Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, he was naturally greatly enraged.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I naturally have the qualifications, because ... your eyes didn’t go blind!”
