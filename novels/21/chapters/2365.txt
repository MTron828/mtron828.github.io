Chapter 2371: Vortex Sudden Change!

“Heh, you don’t know how arrogant and domineering the divine race was back then! They reared the myriad regions’ all lives in pens like pigs and sheep. After they are fattened up, they will be slaughtered in waves. Miracle panaceas, natural treasures, anything that they took fancy on, most of it is theirs! You don’t know what kind of a life of complete darkness that was!”

“The divine race occupied all of the land rich in spiritual energy around the Heavenspan Mountain, and drove all of the other races to remote places, and sent people to supervise the world, called divine envoys! Divine envoys have the power to control the life and death of all races. Even Deva Realm powerhouses, they can sentence them to death at will too!”

“In addition, as long as a heaven-defying genius emerged in the various races, they would concoct all kinds of plans to nip these geniuses in the bud! You say, how can we coexist with the divine race?”

Talking until he was indignant about it, Shang Hang almost wanted to slap the table and get up.

If not for that he only had a wisp of remnant consciousness, his current emotions would likely be able to cause huge undulations.

Titanic waves also stirred in Ye Yuan’s heart.

He did not expect that the various races actually had such a dark past.

Compared to the previous epoch, the various races’ powerhouses in this era were really living in paradise.

The divine race regarded all the races as ants, and they cruelly oppressed the world.

This kind of humiliation, anyone who had a bit of gut would not sit passively and resign themselves to death too!

Now that the divine race had bounced back, if really let them regain control of the Heavenspan World, with the divine race’s resentment, the various races would probably fall into an even darker life.

And the divine race heightening their vigilance, the likelihood of the human race wanting to be liberated in the future, was virtually zero!

“Then, how did Senior you all do it?” Ye Yuan looked at Shang Hang and asked.

Under such strict monitoring from the divine race, the human race actually had major powers the likes of Shang Hang emerged. It was simply inconceivable!

Ye Yuan was very curious about how they did it.

Shang Hang’s expression turned solemn and he revealed a look of admiration as he said, “This will have to start talking from Profound Secrets, that brat’s father! Before the 18 of us grand ancestors appeared, he was the human race’s leader. It was him who united the various races’ major powers together. He then used an inconceivable method, sacrificing himself as the price, to shield heaven’s secrets and send us, this batch, into a secret world. In the end, the 18 of us showed our talents, and became titled grand ancestors! Of course, there were still many peerless powerhouses whose strengths were not inferior to ours as well. But for the human race to be able to have today, Profound Secrets’ father, Jian Mi, made the greatest contribution!”

Ye Yuan was dumbstruck with amazement from listening. He did not think that the Jian Family still had such a history.

Back then, the power that the various races suddenly erupted with probably directly struck the divine race silly.

They definitely never dreamed that so many experts would suddenly emerge.

And at that time, their power of rules was already taken back by Heavenly Dao, they could only unfold a frenzied war with the various races.

In the end, they left for the Abyss World in defeat.

No wonder the Jian Family could become the Heavenspan World’s number one family. It was not just Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ strength, turns out that it was also due to his father.

After all, no matter how strong Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was, it was also impossible to contend with the nine great Dao Ancestors.

Furthermore, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets also inherited his father’s will and exhausted his mind and body for the human race’s future.

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan felt great admiration.

He could not help recalling inside the Ancient God Battlefield, the Empyrean Vast Universe who imparted him the bone sword, as well as the Qilin emperor bone’s main body.

They probably all perished in that great battle, right?

“So that’s how it is! Senior bent your body and exhausted all your energy for the human race, doing your utmost till death! Junior Ye Yuan will engrave it in my heart! Senior’s meaning, Junior understands. Senior rest assured, Junior will definitely follow Senior, and stop the divine race!” Ye Yuan said.

He naturally knew Shang Hang’s meaning. It was to hand this heavy responsibility onto his shoulders.

Not talking about it previously, was because Shang Hang felt that Ye Yuan could not shoulder it.

Assuming a serious attitude now, it was naturally acknowledging Ye Yuan’s ability.

Shang Hang nodded and said, “Good that you understand! Since you learned this ancestor’s spacetime law, you’ll have to inherit this ancestor’s will! Our human race can die, but we must never be pigs and sheep again!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Can there be unbroken eggs when the nest is totally wrecked? This logic, Junior understands! Moreover, Junior and the divine race’s dead knot can probably never be resolved! Senior, time is limited. Junior won’t be talking anymore. These remaining 100 plus years, Junior will do my best to comprehend spacetime law and not let Senior down!”

Shang Hang nodded his head, very satisfied with Ye Yuan’s attitude.

When Ye Yuan just entered, he did not find him pleasing to the eye no matter how he looked.

But now, he found him pleasing to the eye no matter how he looked.

In terms of talent, in terms of temperament, Ye Yuan was the best choice to inherit his mantle!

With just over a hundred years remaining, Ye Yuan was still very far away from this gap of an hour.

Hence, he jumped into the spacetime vortex again.

It was still being sliced into thousands of pieces, but his courage grew even stronger.

These ancient powerhouses’ resolve was still soul-stirring to this day.

How could he, Ye Yuan, be willing to be outdone by others?

Moreover, without the sacrifice of these ancient powerhouses, there naturally would not be the Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove who came later, let alone would there be the current Ye Yuan.

This karma, Ye Yuan also had the responsibility to repay it!

Time passed quietly. In a blink, it was another hundred over years.

The date of a thousand years was already approaching.

During this time, Ye Yuan’s spacetime law comprehension became smoother and smoother.

His spatial law already reached the critical point of comprehending power of source. Time law also reached a level of 1:100.

He was merely just a step away from the requirement of an hour too.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s rapid progress, Shang Hang secretly nodded by the side.

“This kid’s talent is really too terrifying! It’s a pity that he wasn’t born in our era. Otherwise, our human race might not have needed to face such tragic losses!” Shang Hang said with slight regret. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ye Yuan stood in the spacetime vortex. A hint of light gradually flashed across in his eyes.

“Turns out that this is the profound mysteries of spatial law? Yeah, this is Senior Shang Hang’s spatial law, while I need to comprehend the spatial law that belongs to me! My spatial law isn’t just the Heavenspan World’s spatial law, I have to create a spatial law that belongs to me! Mn, there’s also time law! These two great laws will be my Ye Yuan World’s two great supreme laws in the future!”

Although Ye Yuan’s small world had already opened up, it was still a region of chaos.

There, there was no Heavenly Dao, no power of laws.

Everything was in the state of the primitive universe.

The next time, Ye Yuan wanted to create Heavenly Dao laws that belonged to him, making everything operate on its own.

Suddenly, a Tai Chi diagram suddenly rotated behind Ye Yuan.

A powerful Great Dao power started revolving in the spacetime vortex.

The sudden appearance of the Tai Chi diagram completely roiled up the entire spacetime vortex all at once.

The entire spacetime vortex became incomparably berserk all of a sudden.

That was Ye Yuan’s own power of spacetime law!

His power of spacetime law and the power of law in the spacetime vortex seemed to have produced some kind of resonance, stirring up the entire spacetime vortex all at once.

Rumble!

Shang Hang’s expression changed drastically and he said in horror, “What is this kid going to do? Not good, he triggered Spacetime Reversal Chaos! He is going to be swept into the spacetime turbulence!”
