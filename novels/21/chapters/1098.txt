Chapter 1102: Interlinked Stratagem!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Howlsky, chase!”

Zhao Lingdong gave a cold yell. A pair of wings actually grew out of the Howling Sky Divine Hound’s two sides!

Whoosh!

Howlsky turned into a stream of flowing light and actually directly shook Zhao Lingdong off.

Ye Yuan only left for 15 minutes first. This bit of time was not enough to shake Zhao Lingdong, this Void Mystic powerhouse, off.

Zhao Lingdong’s perception locked onto Ye Yuan from far away, not giving him the chance to escape.

Howlsky’s current speed was probably not much slower compared to merging into heaven and earth too.

The distance between him and Ye Yuan was also currently shrinking with incredible speed.

Zhao Lingdong’s footsteps did not slow down, but he said hatefully, “Just how many trumps cards does this brat still have? That grand array earlier was actually able to kill Ertong. Just what in the world happened inside?”

Zhao Lingdong could not figure out after racking his brains!

Mo Ertong clearly had the Spirithorn Shattering Mirror in his hands. But why did he not break the formation?

Even if he did not break the formation, what kind of attack could kill Mo Ertong who possessed a divine artifact?

Zhao Lingdong felt that it was bizarre to the extreme.

Three figures, chasing each other in the fourth level’s space, ran a million miles out very soon.

Howlsky and Ye Yuan’s speed became closer and closer. He was virtually able to see Ye Yuan’s back view already.

Howlsky’s eyes suddenly became focused, his figure vanishing instantly.

At this instant, his speed skyrocketed several times and arrived behind Ye Yuan in a blink of an eye.

Whoosh …

In midair, a streak of cold light flashed past.

Sharp fangs and claws passed right through the chest.

However, Howlsky did not feel that pleasure of penetrating through flesh and blood.

With a rumble, ‘Ye Yuan’ turned into a mass of pale-yellow flames, and dissipated into nothing.

All the fur on Howlsky’s body stood up. A sense of danger assaulted his heart.

In the void, an incomparably swift and fierce sword light pierced out, and directly slashed towards Howlsky’s dog head.

This slash was too close, the speed was simply swift to the extreme!

“Be careful, Howlsky!”

When Zhao Lingdong who had just rushed over saw this scene, his eyes turned bloodshot.

Right at the critical moment, Howlsky urged his speed to the limits and instantly vanished from where he stood.

However, it was still half a beat too slow!

The azure light slashed right onto the wings that Howlsky grew out, forcefully chopping off the wings on his right side!

“Awoo!”

Howlsky gave off a miserable cry and arrived beside Zhao Lingdong with a flash.

A figure slowly walked out from within the void and said with a sigh, “What a shame … Just a little more, and I can chop off this dog head.”

Who was this figure, if not Ye Yuan?

It was just that the Ye Yuan at this time already changed into a long azure robe and was no longer wearing the white garment previously. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Awoo … awoo … awoo …”

Howlsky gave off a series of tragic cries. It was also unknown whether was he wailing, or complaining about Ye Yuan’s shameless conduct.

Probably, only Zhao Lingdong could understand.

That wing of Howlsky’s was already utterly chopped off by Ye Yuan, blood cascading down without stopping.

Although this sword did not claim Howlsky’s life, it made him suffer a great loss in vitality too.

Zhao Lingdong stared fixedly at Ye Yuan. If looks could kill, Ye Yuan would have already died God knows how many times right now.

The feelings between him and Howlsky had long crossed the boundary of master and servant. They were like kin.

Howlsky suffering such a big loss, how could he not be furious?

Only now did he understand that this was completely an interlinked stratagem!

Ye Yuan made that avatar body wore that white-colored long robes and pretend to escape, while he concealed himself within the void here, waiting for an opportunity to sneak attack!

Actually, Ye Yuan’s flying speed was far faster than they imagined!

Separating from the grand array, Ye Yuan unleashed merging into heaven and earth to the limits, and threw down an avatar body on the way, feigning an appearance of essence energy being exhausted and fleeing.

When Ye Yuan separated from the grand array, he had long calculated the time. That instant when the grand array fell apart, Ye Yuan immediately escaped into the void.

The moment Zhao Lingdong and the Howling Sky Divine Hound came out, they discovered Ye Yuan’s avatar body right away, and thought that that was Ye Yuan.

But this first impression was deadly.

Their perception locked onto the avatar body firmly and totally would not think that Ye Yuan was actually concealed within the void.

Especially Howlsky, he did not rely on just perception to lock onto Ye Yuan. He even relied on smell.

This avatar body wore Ye Yuan’s clothes, wouldn’t it be Ye Yuan’s smell?

When he erupted with his full strength and wanted to kill Ye Yuan, the move was already executed, and he was completely unable to perform a second reaction.

All of it took time to say, but actually it was just a split second for a spark to fly off a piece of flint.

This scene was too unexpected, resulting in Zhao Lingdong and Howlsky both already suffering a huge loss without reacting to it.

Except, Ye Yuan was still not too satisfied with this battle achievement.

This sword, he had accumulated power for a long time and fully thought that he would be able to chop off Howlsky’s dog head. Did not think that it was still dodged by him.

“Ji Qingyun, you’re courting death here!” Zhao Lingdong gnashed his teeth hatefully and said.

It was already uncertain how many years it had been since he had been so enraged before.

He would rather he get injured than be willing to see Howlsky get hurt.

But facing Zhao Lingdong’s wrath, Ye Yuan said very calmly, “You said it like you’d let me leave! Since you guys came to kill me, then you’ll have to be prepared to be killed. Not even having this bit of awareness, you … can’t kill me!”

Zhao Lingdong said furiously, “Is that so? Then I’ll take a look at just how many tricks you have! Today, I must dice you up into ten thousand pieces!”

“Roar!”

Zhao Lingdong let out a furious roar. Hideous fur suddenly grew out on his face and hands!

His teeth grew sharp, protruding fangs, his nails also grew sharp claws.

His body was in the air, looking just like a large dog!

“Yo! Actually became a dog! Turns out that this is your most powerful state! Really deserving of the title of Spirit Hound Divine King! Big dog plus a small dog, truly an invincible combination!” Ye Yuan said with an amused look.

Zhao Lingdong had a dog’s appearance, but he spoke in human language, “I hope that you can still laugh in a while!”

Swoosh!

Zhao Lingdong’s figure suddenly disappeared. Ye Yuan only felt a chill at his neck. A dog claw already extended onto his neck.

This skill was cut from the same cloth as Howlsky.

However, Ye Yuan’s Heaven Man Unity Heart Realm was fully released, and he had long taken Zhao Lingdong’s every movement and action into his sight.

He did not panic in the slightest. The Evil Extermination Sword left its scabbard instantly, and stabbed towards Zhao Lingdong’s throat from an extremely odd angle!

The Evil Extermination Sword reached first despite making a move later, and it was even actually a slight faster than Zhao Lingdong.

Zhao Lingdong’s face fell, not expecting Ye Yuan to actually use such a mutual-destruction fighting style.

His claw swiping down, Ye Yuan would no doubt lose his life, but he absolutely could not survive too.

Meeting on a narrow path, the brave wins!

Zhao Lingdong finally still yielded!

At the last second, his body leaned back slightly, narrowly avoiding Ye Yuan’s stab.

And just missing that tiny bit, his claws were unable to pierce through Ye Yuan’s throat anymore.

A drop of fresh blood remained at Ye Yuan’s neck area. His throat still had a small cut sliced open in the end.

It was just that Zhao Lingdong knew that this move, he still lost!

“Can’t even bear to part with your life, you still dare to say how much you love your dog?” Ye Yuan was completely oblivious to the pain on his neck and said with a scoff.
