Chapter 1745 Demonic Attraction Ar

The paper was still floating as Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Brother Kong, please look it over!”

Kong Lin’s expression changed, reaching his hand out and catching the piece of paper.

The moment it came into his hand, it was actually extremely hot!

Bang!

The piece of paper immediately combusted, turning into a cloud of ashes!

“This ... Critical temperature! How did you do it?” Kong Lin looked at Ye Yuan with a look of astonishment.

Those present were all professionals, they naturally would not say that Ye Yuan failed because the paper was burned.

The reason why it burned away was that the paper’s temperature was heated to the critical point by Ye Yuan.

When Kong Lin received the paper, friction was produced between his palm and paper, making the paper instantly exceed the critical point, that was why it started immolating.

Combustion and not burning depended on just a touch!

This level of fire-controlling means was truly inconceivable.

In the usual assessment, no one dared to play with fire like this, no matter how great his strength!

Because critical temperature was too difficult to grasp. As long as there was the tiniest hint of not controlling well, the paper would be burned.

If Ye Yuan used the Willow Cloud Wood to achieve this, even though it was impressive, it would not be inconceivable either.

But he used a mortal grade paper to achieve this. This was extremely terrifying!

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “This is nothing difficult. I could already do it when I was 300 years old. Uh, if you can find a piece of mortal grade tier 1 paper, I can display my real strength.”

Everyone was rendered speechless.

Mortal grade tier 1 could not be found in the Heavenspan World at all.

There were countless trees in the Skydemon Mountain Range but forget about mortal grade tier 1, even mortal grade tier 5 or tier 6 could not be found at all.

Want a mortal grade tier 1 tree, one could only go find it in a small world.

Furthermore, the 300 years old that Ye Yuan said was not this lifetime’s 300 years old, but the previous life’s 300 years old!

Previous life, when he was still Ji Qingyun, he could already achieve this at 300 years old.

Now that close to a thousand years had passed, Ye Yuan’s fire controlling technique was absolutely not what a mere mortal grade tier 1 paper could measure anymore.

But this was already shocking enough!

On the seats of honor, the three elders also exchanged glances, extremely shocked.

“Young man, what’s your name?” Stonefeather opened his mouth and asked.

“Ye Yuan!”

Stonefeather nodded and said, “Ye Yuan, your fire controlling technique is indeed impressive! Even the few of us old fellows are likely not your match too.”

The moment these words came out, those examinees were all shocked until they stared dumbfounded with gaping mouths.

Someone as powerful as Elder Stonefeather actually took the initiative to admit that he was inferior to such a young man?

Especially Mu Yuanchun, he wished to find a hole on the ground to tunnel into when he heard this.

Wasn’t Stonefeather’s words slapping his face?

Previously, Ye Yuan said that this kind of understanding would not work on some people.

Now, didn’t it affirm such words?

Those elders above, which one wasn’t an old monster who lived more than 100 thousand years?

Their accumulations, ordinary people found it hard to imagine.

However, Ye Yuan said that he reached this kind of standard when he was 300 years old, was there something more disgraceful than this?

But Stonefeather’s tone changed and he said, “But refining demon divine pills are different from refining the human race’s divine pills. You have to pass the two rounds of assessments at the back before it’s considered successful.”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “Yes, Elder. Ye Yuan won’t let you down.”

Stonefeather nodded his head and said, “Carry on then.”

Only then did Kong Lin recover from the shock and said, “Next, starting the second round, demonic attraction art! People who were eliminated in the first round don’t need to take part anymore.”

A hundred demon powerhouses, more than half were already eliminated in the first round.

Present, those who remained were merely 30 to 40 people.

“There are a hundred types of wood chips here, what you have to do is to use the demonic attraction art to glue them together! The more types bound together, the better the results naturally! Those who bind more 25 types and above, pass!” Kong Lin said.

The so-called demonic attraction art was the foundation skill of the demon race’s alchemy technique.

The human race’s divine soul was powerful. Furthermore, the secret arts were numerous and they could cultivate the divine soul.

But the demon race’s talent did not lie in the demonic soul, so their demonic souls were also relatively weak.

Apart from some minority powerful races, the demonic souls of the majority of the races were inferior to humans.

Wanting to be like a human alchemist, using soul force to serve as a lubricant for refining medicinal pills, it was beyond their power.

But the demon race also had an advantage that humans were not equipped with. It was that they were naturally closer to nature.

The demon race’s demonic divine essence also had more affinity with spirit medicines.

Hence, they blazed another trail, using demonic divine essence as a substitute for the humans’ soul force to refine medicinal pills. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This was the cultivation system of the demon race.

The strength of the demonic attraction art reflected the strength of the demon alchemist to a very large extent.

All in all, humans based soul force as the principal, divine essence as supplementary. The demon race based demonic divine essence as principal, soul force as supplementary.

Under Kong Lin’s guidance, the examinees started undergoing the second round.

Binding wood chips, this test method was similarly very novel.

Wood chips were not spirit medicines, there would not be too many law fragments complementing each other.

Wanting to adhere them together as a whole was not an easy matter.

However, this tested the alchemist’s demonic attraction art even more too.

Those people taking the test were watchful and cautious, fearful of missing any hint out.

But their strength could at best only bind together a dozen over kinds of wood chips.

Any more and it would not work.

In a corner, Ye Yuan stared at each person’s way of handling without moving his eyes, deducing non-stop in his mind.

Ye Yuan was totally clueless about the demonic attraction art, but he knew that the demonic attraction art had common aspects with the soul attracting art.

A burst of faint demonic divine essence flowed in Ye Yuan’s palm, he was currently imitating binding those wood chips.

Feeling the demonic divine essence undulations, quite a few people looked over sideways.

When Mu Yuanchun saw this scene, he could not help being stunned.

“This kid ... doesn’t know the demonic attraction art at all! Hahaha, like I said, this guy is simply a human alchemist, wanting to sneak into the Priest Temple!” Mu Yuanchun said.

When the rest saw this scene, they immediately perceived something wrong as well.

“No way, right? His fire controlling art is so incredible, but he actually doesn’t know the demonic attraction art!”

“Looks like he hasn’t refined demon divine pills before at all!”

“This guy wouldn’t be thinking of learning and selling on the spot, right? This ... This is also too funny!”

...

The first round, Ye Yuan astonished everyone.

But this scene currently, subverted everyone’s view of him.

Perhaps, Ye Yuan was indeed a very formidable human alchemist.

But he did not even know demonic attraction art. So how could he possibly pass the second round’s test.

“Elders, this guy is simply clueless about our demon race’s alchemy skills. He probably has malicious intent and wants to sneak into our Priest Temple! Elders please summarily execute him on the spot!” Mu Yuanchun clasped his hands and pleaded.

Ye Yuan completely ignored Mu Yuanchun. He was already immersed in it.

Those examinees’ strengths were not considered strong, but Ye Yuan continuously learned from others’ strong points while overcoming the weak points in his mind, deducing, and perfecting. His strength was currently advancing by leaps and bounds.

Stonefeather’s gaze was akin to a torch, staring fixedly at Ye Yuan, and said coolly, “This child isn’t an ordinary person. Let him give it a try!”
