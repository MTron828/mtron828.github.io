Chapter 2240: Does This Boy Want to Defy the Heavens?

It was a great battle. The losses were heavy. Everyone recuperated on their own.

Ye Yuan did not think too much, directly swallowing his portion of Blood Lotus Flower.

Blood Lotus Flower was an extremely rare rank eight spirit medicine, the spiritual energy contained within was extremely abundant.

If refined into a pill, it would be a medicinal pill that could let Heavenly Emperor powerhouses advance greatly in strength.

The Blood Lotus Flower grew in the Asura Blood Sea, this kind of place. Hence, it contained a lot of carnage energy inside. Ordinary human martial artists did not dare to directly swallow it at all.

Seeing Ye Yuan directly swallow the Blood Lotus Flower, the Empyreans could not help being stupefied.

However, Ye Yuan did not care. Carnage energy was similarly a great tonic to him.

Half a day later, Ye Yuan’s aura skyrocketed, finally reaching peak middle-stage Chaos Realm. There was only a hair’s breadth away from late-stage Chaos Realm.

Seeing this, everyone could not help feeling speechless.

This human was unable to gauge using common sense at all.

Ye Yuan found Wu Jiang and discovered that his aura also rose significantly, and that he had already reached peak Empyrean Realm.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan could detect that the Blood Lotus Flower still had a large portion of medicinal strength that was not refined.

The residual rank eight laws in the Blood Lotus Flower would also help him comprehend Heavenly Dao, and this would increase the chances of breaking through to become a Heavenly Emperor.

Ye Yuan could perceive that Wu Jiang’s strength was extraordinary.

With this Blood Lotus Flower, he already faintly had some awareness that breaking through to become a Heavenly Emperor in the future would likely not be difficult.

This thing meant too much to Wu Jiang!

Rather, it was Ye Yuan who was like a bottomless pit, sucking all the medicinal strength without anything remaining.

“Looks like Brother Wu’s harvest is greater than I imagined. Congratulations, Brother Wu,” Ye Yuan said with a light smile.

Wu Jiang had a grateful look as he said, “This is still all thanks to Brother Ye gifting the medicine!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “The Silvernet Blood Essence hasn’t appeared for a long time, but Heavenly Emperor level fierce beasts are already appearing here. Continuing forward will be unbelievably dangerous. Let’s bid farewell here.”

Wu Jiang’s gaze flickered and was just about to speak when suddenly, the laughter of a child suddenly sounded out inside the karst cave.

“Hehehe ...”

The faces of the Empyreans changed slightly. Suddenly, a streak of silver light flashed past.

Whoosh!

Everyone only felt a blur before their eyes, that silver light rushed straight for the Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather who was currently healing his injuries!

The powerful Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather actually did not have the slightest strength to resist and was directly abducted away.

“Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil, activate!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp, directly activating the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil. He then saw a seven to eight years old child biting Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather in his mouth, and he was heading toward the depths of the passageway.

Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather’s face revealed a look of terror. But he was being bitten by the child and did not have leftover strength to resist at all.

Wu Jiang’s face changed and he said, “That’s ... the aura of the Silvernet Blood Essence! A Silvernet Blood Essence that has taken human form!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed wildly. Virtually without the slightest hesitation, his figure shot out like lightning.

At the same time, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s figure also shot out like lightning.

The two figures, one in front and one at the back, vanishing from everyone’s line of sight in a blink of an eye.

“This Silvernet Blood Essence actually grasped spatial law!”

Ye Yuan was startled. With his spatial law comprehensions, he actually could not catch up to the Silvernet Blood Essence within a short time.

This Silvernet Blood Essence’s spatial law was already rather terrifying. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, Ye Yuan’s spatial law was ultimately a notch higher. The distance was constantly shrinking.

At the back, the more Heavenly Emperor Ninelives chased, the more alarmed he got.

He, this Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, actually could not catch up to an Empyrean!

Ye Yuan’s spatial law was not restricted here at all.

This guy was simply a monster.

However, he was, at any rate, a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, forcefully relying on his powerful divine essence as an advantage, hanging behind Ye Yuan.

Three figures, racing each other, dashing in the passageway.

But Ye Yuan was burning with anxiety in his heart, the deeper in, the more dangerous.

Those top major powers were all in the depths of the passageway.

The direction that this Silvernet Blood Essence was heading in was precisely where the bloody light was most flourishing.

While at this time, Ye Yuan’s Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil saw it clearly.

As the Silvernet Blood Essence fled, it gnawed on Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather!

He could feel that child’s aura currently becoming stronger little by little.

“Hurry! A little faster!”

Ye Yuan urged his speed to the limits, but he was still unable to be any faster.

Although the distance was shrinking, continuing to chase at this speed, no idea when he would have to chase until.

At this very moment, Ye Yuan only had one thought in his mind, that was to be a little faster!

Behind Ye Yuan, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s pupils suddenly constricted, his heart shaking wildly.

In his eyes, Ye Yuan’s speed suddenly skyrocketed, like he added an ignition device, heading for the Silvernet Blood Essence like flying.

“What’s going on? This boy clearly already reached his limits. Why would he suddenly become so fast? No, wait! It’s ... It’s me who slowed down!”

Monstrous waves stirred up in Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s heart. He discovered that the scenery on both sides gradually slowed down.

But he was clearly maintaining the fastest speed.

What was going on?

Earlier, when he saw Ye Yuan suddenly accelerate, it was just his misconception.

Suddenly, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s thoughts flashed in his mind, his gaze revealing a look of amazement.

“T-Time law! This boy comprehended time law?”

“Won’t be wrong! This ... This is definitely time law!”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’ current emotion was simply unable to use words to describe. He just felt his back drip with cold sweat.

He only felt like there was a myriad of profanities running across his mind.

How could there be such a monstrous person in this world?

“Time law, spatial law! Two supreme laws, he comprehended two forms of time! Does this boy want to defy the heavens?”

Any words were insufficient to describe his current shock.

At this moment, he was incomparably certain that Ye Yuan indeed touched time law, making the surrounding time flow slow down.

Hence, that was why his speed would be blinding fast.

Concerning supreme laws, comprehending one was already the blessing of 18 generations of ancestors.

This boy actually comprehended two of them!

In the future, after he corroborated his Dao and became a Heavenly Emperor, the day when he became a supreme lord, who could still be his match in this Heavenspan World?

Terrifying!

Too terrifying!

Just thinking about it, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives shuddered without feeling cold.

Reaching Heavenly Emperor Realm, the things that could make them bee in awe and veneration were already very few.

He had never thought that he would reveal fearful feelings toward an Empyrean Realm martial artist one day!

Meeting Ye Yuan for the first time, he only felt that his strength was decent.

But along the way, he forced out Ye Yuan’s strength little by little.

When Ye Yuan displayed Heavenly Emperor True Word, that instant he annihilated Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn.

Only then did he know what kind of a monster he provoked!

But he was still unconvinced. He was a Heavenly Emperor. How could he accept an Empyrean scaring him to this extent?

Hence, he wanted to borrow the opportunity of rebirth and kill Ye Yuan in one stroke.

But Ye Yuan’s spatial law erupted in full force, finally still avoiding his certain-kill strike!

At that time, he became extremely apprehensive of Ye Yuan.

If not for the Silvernet Blood Essence being too important to him, he even wanted to leave at this point.

But precisely because he followed after, he witnessed the moment of a miracle!

A peerless powerhouse who gathered two supreme laws onto one body was born!
