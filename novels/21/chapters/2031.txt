Chapter 2035: Empyrean Proudcloud

“Ye Yuan, purple spirit divine-grade!”

“Empyrean Azurerain, peak superior-grade!”

“Empyrean Jiuhao, superior-grade!”

...

Five Empyreans being defeated, another five Empyreans came. It was just that the result was still the same, a total defeat!

Five to six rounds were done in a row, the results were all the same.

Ye Yuan was forever purple spirit divine-grade, while the others were either peak superior-grade or superior-grade.

All in all, they were unable to break through to heaven-grade, this category.

Very soon, those Empyreans felt something amiss.

“Hiss ... This isn’t right!” Empyrean Lumen said with a frown.

By the side, his good friend Empyrean Windrider smile and said, “Huhu, you also perceived it? This Grandmaster Ye isn’t simple!”

Empyrean Lumen said in surprise, “You saw through long ago?”

Empyrean Windrider smiled and said, “The order of appearing on the stage is according to the strength of the Empyrean, which is also their seating order. The ones taking the field now, their rankings already reached 40-50th place. Their strengths are all much stronger than Younger Brother Longyi. Logically speaking, even if Grandmaster Ye’s strength is formidable, there should also be someone who broke through to heaven-grade already. But up till now, there’s actually no one who could break through to heaven-grade!”

“That is also to say that Grandmaster Ye still has the strength to spare! This ... Could it be that his strength can really reach the level of grandmaster?”

Empyrean Lumen was really shocked! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Originally, he thought that Ye Yuan was only extremely capable in deducing things, while his hands-on ability might be slightly lacking.

But who could have thought that Ye Yuan’s hands-on ability was even more horrifying than his deducing ability!

Ye Yuan was truly a monstrous-like young man!

Empyrean Windrider smiled and said, “Whether or not he has the strength of an Empyrean, I have no idea. But I’m very curious now just who can force out his true strength.”

Battling in alchemy until now, there was already no one who doubted Ye Yuan’s degree of monstrousness. It was just that everyone was greatly looking forward to who could force out all of his strength.

One battle after another, those Five-star and Six-star Alchemy Gods below long already went from surprise to admiration with regards to Ye Yuan’s strength.

They were different from those Empyreans. In the eyes of Seven-star Alchemy Gods, Ye Yuan was just a junior. A junior riding on top of their heads, so they were naturally unhappy.

But Ye Yuan and these juniors were peers. For a peer to be able to have such horrifying alchemy strength, what else could they do except admire?

After ten rounds of battle, Ye Yuan won all the way and not a single person could actually reach heaven-grade.

This kind of result was too unexpected.

“Grandmaster Ye is really too fearsome. From today onwards, he’s my idol. I’ll have the opportunity to stand in front of him in this life.”

“Screw off, you! Previously, you were still saying that he’s arrogant and ignorant about the immensity of heaven and earth.”

That person’s face turned red, and he argued and said, “That ... That’s because I didn’t know beforehand! Prior to this, who could have imagined that a Six-star Alchemy God could reach such a realm!”

“That makes sense. He really broadened my horizons today!”

...

After ten rounds of battle, Ye Yuan defeated 50 Seven-star Alchemy Gods. No matter whether he won or lost at the back, it was already sufficient to make these juniors worship crazily.

Swoosh!

A figure leaped into the air and landed in the ring, a look of scorn on his face.

“It’s Empyrean Proudcloud! It’s finally his turn to make a move!”

“Why? Is Empyrean Proudcloud very impressive?” Someone who did not understand asked wonderingly.

“Heh, more than impressive! Do you know why Lord Flutterfeather wanted Grandmaster Ye to fight one-on-one starting from Empyrean Proudcloud?”

“This ... Could it be that there’s still some reason?” He originally thought that this was just casually said thoughtlessly. Looking at it now, it was clearly not the case.

That holy land disciple clearly had the intention of showing off too, saying smugly, “Empyrean Proudcloud is ranked 25th among all the Empyreans, the Seven-star Alchemy Gods before him were all middle-stage Dao Realm. But starting from him, those are all late-stage Dao Realm mighty experts!”

“So that’s how it is! Starting from Empyrean Proudcloud, the strength goes up by a full level!”

There was a series of exclamations all around, finally understanding the difference involved.

Dao Realm was an extremely drawn-out realm. Similarly in middle-stage Dao Realm, the medicinal pills refined could have a huge difference.

And wanting to cultivate from middle-stage Dao Realm to late-stage Dao Realm, this was an incomparably difficult step.

Only by taking this step could one be considered a top Seven-star Alchemy God.

Empyrean Proudcloud was clearly such a powerhouse!

“Hang on! Then according to this, isn’t Grandmaster Ye already late-stage Dao Realm?”

Very soon, someone reacted to it and thought of Ye Yuan.

Empyrean Proudcloud was the watershed of late-stage Dao Realm. If so, then with Ye Yuan defeating all of the middle-stage Dao Realms, wouldn’t he very likely be late-stage Dao Realm?

A thousand over years old late-stage Dao Realm ...

When everyone reacted to it, each and every one of them sucked in a cold breath.

With Empyrean Proudcloud as a reference, everyone would have a taste of Ye Yuan’s monstrousness even more.

To Six-star Alchemy Gods, just entering the Dao Realm was already the limit. Forget about the middle-stage Dao Realm, they did not even dare to imagine the peak initial-stage Dao Realm.

Because once you entered the Dao Realm, the difficulty of comprehending Alchemy Dao would soar. That required the accumulation of countless years.

And this long period of time was sufficient to let these geniuses break through to the Empyrean Realm already.

Previously, everyone’s guesses about Ye Yuan’s strength were mostly in the middle-stage Dao Realm.

But now, Ye Yuan rose a level out of the blue, reaching the late-stage Dao Realm.

This kind of change made everyone feel too astonished ... as well as absurd.

The holy land disciple that was originally showing off was also stunned. He clearly did not think of this as well.

That holy land disciple said, “This ... Although Grandmaster Ye is indeed an exceptional genius, it’s impossible for him to be Empyrean Proudcloud’s match. After all, the duration that Empyrean Proudcloud has been in the late-stage Dao Realm is already not short!”

The others also nodded their heads one after another. Monstrousness got to have a limit. A thousand over years old late-stage Dao Realm, this already could not be imagined.

If Ye Yuan crushed all the way again, it was clearly being too unreasonable.

But now, none of these juniors already felt that it was not apt for Ye Yuan to sit on a grandmaster seat.

He already surpassed 80% of Empyreans at a young age, his future achievements would absolutely not be inferior to these grandmasters, even going further beyond.

Empyrean Proudcloud looked at Ye Yuan and said with a disdainful look on his face, “Ye Yuan, this Empyrean indeed underestimated you. I didn’t expect that you’re already late-stage Dao Realm at a young age. But you’re too condescending, too arrogant! You challenged all the Seven-star Alchemy Gods with the grandmaster token as a wager. You’ll stop here with me. You can only withdraw out of the Cloudpill Summit with a heavy heart!”

Similarly at the late-stage Dao Realm, he had cultivated several hundreds of thousands of years more than Ye Yuan. So how could he possibly lose to Ye Yuan?

But he was indeed surprised by Ye Yuan’s talent.

He was even somewhat jealous.

With Ye Yuan’s talent, surpassing him was just a matter of time.

Hence, he already made up his mind in his heart to ruthlessly quash Ye Yuan’s prestige this time, making him lose all of his pride, crushing this genius completely!

Geniuses were breathtaking, but they were also easy to break.

The more prodigious, the more proud they were, the faster they would wither after being struck down!

Thinking up to here, Empyrean Proudcloud was secretly feeling good in his heart.

“Oh? Is that so? To make me withdraw out of the Cloudpill Summit, just the likes of you aren’t qualified enough yet!” Ye Yuan looked at Empyrean Proudcloud and said calmly.
