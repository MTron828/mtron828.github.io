Chapter 1562 Scold You to Your Face All the Same!

Miracle Hand Parlor’s front door was directly blasted into smithereens.

Inside the hall was a mess. All kinds of spirit medicines were scattered everywhere.

The shopkeeper hid at one side and did not even dare to breathe loudly.

The pressure emitting off of Tang Rui’s body made him shudder.

“Call Ye Yuan out! Today, this Miracle Hand Parlor is going to disappear from the south city!” Tang Rui said coolly.

Right at this time, a group of people suddenly poured in. The one in the lead was the Thunderclap Gang’s chief head, Xing Guan.

When Xing Guan saw Tang Rui, his complexion could not help turning pale. But he still forcefully calmed down and said with clasped hands, “This lord, I wonder what my Miracle Hand Parlor has done wrong, to actually startle the Martial Tower!”

Tang Rui glanced at him and said disdainfully, “A mere ant, what qualifications do you have to question this divine lord? Scram!”

A ‘scram’ word rushed straight over carrying a surge of world power.

The Thunderclap Gang’s few brothers could not even block it and were directly sent flying, fresh blood spouting out wildly.

Xing Guan had already stepped foot into half-step Divine Lord. But in front of Tang Rui, he still could not stand up to a single blow.

Tang Rui was not Xiao Riyue, that kind of newbie. He was a second-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse. With a wave of a hand, he could kill Xing Guan and co.

If not for the Martial Tower’s rules restraining, Xing Guan and the rest would already be corpses now.

Xing Guan crawled to his feet, gritted his teeth, and said angrily, “Your Excellency, the Martial Tower has the Martial Tower’s rules too. You want to destroy my Miracle Hand Parlor’s business indiscriminately, where’s the logic?”

At this time, Wu Feng smiled coldly and said, “You want a reason, is it? Ye Yuan colluded with divine lord powerhouses and disturbed the south city’s order! I wonder if this crime is sufficient or not?”

Xing Guan’s expression changed and berated furiously, “Wu Feng, you’re set out to condemn someone and have no difficulty finding a pretext! The Miracle Hand Parlor’s Divine Lord Realm powerhouse only came to exchange on Alchemy Dao with Master Ye Yuan. When has he disturbed the south city’s order before?”

Tang Rui’s eyes narrowed and he said with a cold snort, “This divine lord doing things still need you to tell me right or not? Keep talking rubbish and this divine lord won’t be courteous anymore!”

Under the powerful oppression, the muscles on Xing Guan’s whole body was quivering.

However, he still stubbornly did not retreat.

Xing Guan reeked of an uncultured air and valued loyalty the most.

Ye Yuan treated Ol’ Second, he was overflowing with gratitude toward Ye Yuan.

Furthermore, Xiao Riyue breaking through last time, if not for Ye Yuan, the Thunderclap Gang would have long been wiped out.

Hence, when he learned that Wu Feng brought people over, he brought his brothers and rushed over straight away.

Except, he did not expect that Wu Feng actually invited over a Martial Tower’s powerhouse.

“Looks like you won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin!”

Tang Rui gave a cold snort, pointing a finger at Xing Guan.

The scent of death hit from head-on. Under this finger, Xing Guan did not have any leeway to resist at all and could only shut his eyes and await death.

Boom!

Right then, an aura that was not weaker than Tang Rui’s rudely inserted between the two people.

Tang Rui retreated several steps in a row, his aura in turmoil.

He did not use his full power just now and suffered a hidden loss all at once.

He was just about to fly off the handle when he suddenly saw the white-clothed youth behind Xing Guan, and his expression could not help changing.

“Lu Yi! You ... Why are you here?!” Tang Rui said in surprise.

Lu Yi was the Pill Tower’s rising star. It was very likely that he would inherit Master Xuan Yu’s mantle in the future.

In contrast, Tang Rui’s position in the Martial Tower was much worse. He could only climb up the ranks to be Master Deercry’s follower.

“Tang Rui, how awe-inspiring you all, running to the south city to flaunt your prowess! If you have the capability, go put on airs in the Martial Tower!” Lu Yi said sarcastically.

Tang Rui did not expect that Lu Yi was so demeaning, mocking him the moment he came up. At once, he snorted coldly too and said, “I’m under Master Deercry’s orders to capture the Divine Lord Realm martial artist who disturbed the south city’s situation! Lu Yi, could it be that you want to oppose me?”

In a few rounds, Lu YI and the few apprentice brothers already prostrated on all fours in front of Ye Yuan.

They really gleaned considerable benefits today and were just chatting away gaily in the inner hall, but it was swept clean by Tang Rui’s arrival. How could he not be angry?

Seeing Tang Rui pull out Deercry to suppress him, he smiled coldly and said, “Deercry? Deercry is a fart! Someone who takes advantage of his seniority! Master Xiao Feng that you’re talking about is my best friend and is currently debating on Dao with me. If you want to capture him, are you going to take me away together too?”

Tang Rui could not maintain his composure and said angrily, “You ... You’re breaking the imperial city’s rules here! I’ll definitely report to the Martial Tower and Pill Tower when I go back!”

Lu Yi said disdainfully, “Have it your way! But you have to be prepared to suffer my wrath!”

Tang Rui’s expression changed and was somewhat in a dilemma for a moment.

The strength of Xuan Yu’s lineage was too fearsome in the Pill Tower.

Not only was Xuan Yu’s own strength fearsome, but also the disciples that he groomed, each and every one, all of them were the Pill Tower’s young generation leaders.

Only the head elder’s lineage could contend with Xuan Yu’s lineage.

Although Deercry was the head elder’s faction, in front of Xuan Yu, he was not enough to look at at all.

As for him, Tang Rui, there was no need to even say anymore.

In the inner city, he was merely a minor character.

If the heavyweights got into a fight, he might become a sacrifice.

Wu Feng did not even dare to let out a sound by the side.

This level of exchange was already not what he could inject.

He totally thought that with his master coming forward, he could definitely annihilate the Miracle Hand Parlor today.

Who knew that another great deity popped out here again. His identity and status were even extraordinary. Even Tang Rui did not dare to be overly insolent.

At this moment, Wu Feng’s heart had collapsed.

Just what kind of magic did Ye Yuan this punk have? Why would this place continuously have great deities coming and going?

But just as he lost all hope, a slightly fat old man slowly entered the Miracle Hand Parlor.

Wu Feng’s eyes shone brightly. He was incomparably agitated.

“Lu Yi, your guts aren’t small, to actually dare scold this old man behind my back?”

This old man who suddenly appeared was none other than precisely Deercry himself!

Tang Rui had just left when Deercry got the news that Lu Yi apprentice brothers four people went out of the inner city. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

And the destination was precisely the Miracle Hand Parlor!

This new involuntarily made Deercry become solemn.

With the few of them around, Tang Rui definitely could not gain any advantage. Hence, he decided to come here personally.

As for Xuan Yu, his whereabouts were naturally not what Deercry could grasp.

He did not know that Xuan Yu had long been a step ahead of Lu Yi they all, and entered this tiny Miracle Hand Parlor already.

When Lu Yi saw Deercry, he was slightly stunned too. But very soon, he snorted coldly and said, “Who said that I’m scolding you behind your back? I’ll scold you to your face all the same! A guy who takes advantage of your seniority!”

Xuan Yu himself was very indifferent toward authority. But his alchemy strength, even the head elder was very apprehensive toward it.

Hence, in the Pill Tower, the head elder always suppressed and ostracized Xuan Yu’s lineage. Furthermore, Deercry was also a veteran of bureaucratic play and trickery. Lu Yi naturally disliked him.

Lu Yi as Xuan Yu’s head disciple did not have any favorable impression of Deercry at all.

Even though Deercry was a high-level deacon, Lu Yi’s status in the Pill Tower did not lose out against Deercry by a large margin.

Deercry did not expect that Lu Yi was so condescending. His expression became incomparably gloomy, and he said with a cold snort, “Your lineage is indeed a bunch of calves without upbringing! Scandalous! This old man will teach you all how to respect the seniors properly today on behalf of Second Elder!”
