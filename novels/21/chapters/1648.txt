Chapter 1652 Counting Money Until Hand Cramps!

“Yoo, Du Mingliang, you came early enough!”

Early next morning, Mu Dong came to the Heavenly Network Gathering, but he discovered that Du Mingliang was already queuing at the very front of the ranks.

He waved his hand at that martial artist behind Du Mingliang and then directly cut the queue.

No one dared to talk behind his back!

Considering the strength of a sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord, plus the faction behind him, if anyone made idle talk, wasn’t that courting death?

The rules here were set by the three major forces!

Du Mingliang saw Mu Dong and said coolly, “Didn’t you come pretty early too? I reckon that Liu Han is going to reach too, right? After all, it’s void spirit divine pill, so who can be unmoved?”

Mu Dong nodded his head and suddenly said with a sigh, “If I’d met Master Ye several tens of thousands of years earlier, how good would it be? How many years of bitter cultivation would this save me?!”

“Isn’t that so! Now, this rank three divine pill is already not much use to us. Truly a shame!” Liu Han arrived and exclaimed.

That martial artist queuing behind Du Mingliang wanted to cry but had no tears and could only move another place back.

However, this was not over yet.

Apart from these three major forces, over a dozen more people came one after another. They were all middle-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouses.

These people were without exception all powerhouses of the major forces within the city.

It was a pity for that person. He was queuing in the middle of the night since last night. In a short while, he was squeezed out of the first 20.

Right now, the procession was pretty much arranged according to the power of the forces in the city.

The stall owner had not appeared yet and the stall was empty. But everyone was very orderly, quietly waiting for the arrival of the stall owner.

Before long, Ye Yuan brought Ning Tianping and slowly stepped into the Heavenly Network Gathering.

Seeing Ye Yuan arrive, everyone had an excited look.

Yesterday, there were quite a number of people who bought the medicinal pills. Some news naturally spread out already.

The medicinal effects of Ye Yuan’s void spirit divine pills indeed lived up to its reputation. A night passed, there were already quite a number of Origin Deity Realm martial artists who broke through.

Therefore, everyone looked forward to Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills even more.

After all, compared to the Divine Lord Realm, the numbers of Origin Deity Realm were still more.

After tidying up, Ye Yuan gave Du Mingliang a glance and said coolly, “Begin then, what medicinal pill do you want?”

Du Mingliang was cautious as he said with a smile, “Little Brother Ye Yuan, what level nine difficulty medicinal pills do you have? Is there a Vastsun Universe Pill?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “There naturally is! But the spirit medicines of Vastsun Universe Pill is very hard to put together. I only have two on hand.”

But Du Mingliang was overjoyed the moment he heard and said, “Great! The two Vastsun Universe Pills, I want them! Additionally, I still want 20 Vast Essence Pills ...”

Du Mingliang reported the names of quite a few medicinal pills in one breath. All levels of medicinal pills were involved.

The martial artists at the back all listened until they were extremely shocked.

Indeed loaded as hell!

Calculating this total price, it was probably no less than ten billion, right?

But Mu Dong and Liu Han were indignant. Mu Dong said furiously, “Du Mingliang, don’t let your appearance of eating be so ugly! Could it be that only your Sword Star Alliance has money?”

But Du Mingliang smiled coldly and said, “Want to blame, blame that you didn’t come earlier! If you were the first, would you buy up these two Vastsun Universe Pills or not?”

Mu Dong snorted coldly and said, “Don’t give me that! Today, you must leave one for your father! Otherwise, let’s showcase our true abilities!”

Du Mingliang sneered and said, “Fight then. You think I am scared of you?”

The scene was dangerously explosive, with the air of coming to blows at a word of disagreement.

Also could not blame them, a void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill virtually represented a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, which faction could be unmoved?

At this time, Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Alright, keep making a row and I won’t sell a single one!”

Seeing Ye Yuan fly off the handle, the three people indeed stopped.

The martial artists at the back looked at Ye Yuan with shocked faces.

What background did this Master Ye have, to speak to sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses like this? They actually did not even dare to let out a fart!

Ye Yuan paused for a bit and continued: “If you guys can pool together the spirit medicines, I can also help you guys refine. As for the fees ... two billion will do.”

The moment Mu Dong and Liu Han heard, they could not help being overjoyed.

Gathering two sets of spirit medicines with the strength of these two families was still doable.

As for divine essence stones, they did not care at all.

The three major forces had been entrenched in Riverluck Capital City for many years, their foundation incomparably deep. Several billion was really no big deal to them.

Finally, Du Mingliang settled the accounts, he spent a total of more than 12 billion divine essence stones.

“Little Brother Ye Yuan, here’s 12.1 billion divine essence stones, please count it.” Du Mingliang handed the storage ring to Ye Yuan very respectfully.

Mu Dong and Liu Han were also very gallant, each buying around ten billion of medicinal pills.

Ning Tianping’s eyes became wide-saucers at one side.

This money ... was blown over by a strong wind, right?

Yesterday was just a small scale operation? So today was the main show?!

These three major forces added up were already more than 30 billion!

At the back, there was still a long line of people waiting.

Although these forces could not compare to the three great factions, they more or less had some background and were also people who did not lack money. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

On this day, Ning Tianping spent it counting divine essence stones. He felt that his head was already somewhat numb.

This was really counting money until hand cramps!

When this day ended, Ning Tianping counted it, a total of more than 110 billion entered the accounts!

One day, more than 110 billion!

Ning Tianping felt like his heart was about to jump out. Was there still this kind of operation?

However, this was not over yet.

In the following few days, all the places that sold spirit medicines in the city were raided by the three major forces.

These three great factions pooled together the portions of seven medicinal pills again. They requested Ye Yuan to take action to refine the Vastsun Universe Pill.

Without a doubt, among level nine difficulty medicinal pills, the Vastsun Universe Pill was the most popular and also the most practical.

Ten days’ time passed in an instant. In these ten days, Ning Tianping deeply experienced Ye Yuan’s powerful money-making ability.

“Hahaha ... Your Excellency, this is really too crazy! Ten days’ time, a short ten days’ time, we actually earned more than 400 billion! Over 400 billion!”

At the end of the tallying, Ning Tianping was happy until he almost went crazy.

The profit of refining void spirit divine pills was too great.

Just take the Vastsun Universe Pill for example, although its spirit medicines were rare, the total value was also just around 700 to 800 million.

But Ye Yuan refining and selling it, it then became three billion!

One Vastsun Universe Pill added more than two billion worth of value all at once.

Of course, Ning Tianping understood that only Ye Yuan, this kind of freak, could have such heaven-defying money-making ability.

If it were others, even Head Elder Xuan Yu and Second Elder Ruo Xu, they both did not have this ability!

Because they could not refine void spirit divine-grade!

Forget about void spirit divine-grade, even purple spirit divine-grade, they could not refine it.

Therefore, the added value of the medicinal pills was naturally not that high.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m also dog-tired these few days. There are still a few days before the auction. These few days, let’s go shopping in the Heavenly Network Gathering. Whatever good things we encounter, let’s buy them.”
