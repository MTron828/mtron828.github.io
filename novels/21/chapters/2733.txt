Chapter 2739: Well-prepared!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You’re keeping them??Huhu,?as long as you have the ability to get them, I have no objections!” When Saint Exalt Waycloud heard that, he smiled coldly.

“Brat, do you really think that you’re invincible under the heavens by having a Saint Exalt helper? This exalt wants to see how you collect them!”

“Shameless boasting little fellow, do you really think that us, these Saint Sovereign Heavens, are all incompetent?”

… …

When the few great Saint Exalts heard that, they all smiled coldly.

A mere Jade Sovereign Heaven also dares to boast shamelessly in front of them, did he really take it that the Bloodcentral Devil Vine was to be trifled with?”

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Is that so? Then you guys watch carefully.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan rode on Big Yellow and leaped, directly entering the medicinal land.

But the strange thing was that the Bloodcentral Devil Vine actually did not react!

Ye Yuan was not courteous either and immediately began collecting the surrounding heavenly medicines.

When the powerhouses at the periphery saw this scene, each and every one of their eyes went wide!

“What’s going on? Why isn’t there any movement from the Bloodcentral Devil Vine?”

“Really seeing ghosts!”

“Could it be that the Bloodcentral Devil Vine is full from absorbing the blood and won’t attack us anymore?”

… …

When many people saw the situation, they were all guessing.

Seeing that Ye Yuan was actually fine, they were naturally tempted too.

The gutsy would be stuffed and the cowardly would starve.

Since Ye Yuan was fine, then they would definitely be fine too!

Hence, someone plucked up their courage and rushed into the medicinal land again.

But, right at the moment they entered the attack range, the Bloodcentral Devil Vine moved out like lightning.

Puchi!

Those few Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were directly sucked into human jerkies!

With this, they no longer had hopes of getting lucky.

“Damn it, why doesn’t the Bloodcentral Devil Vine react to him?” Saint Exalt Waycloud said in shock and anger.

The faces of the other Saint Exalts were all very ugly.

Such a large piece of medicinal land, it was actually going to benefit Ye Yuan alone?

Having collected the surrounding heavenly medicine, Big Yellow leaped again and arrived at another area.

Ye Yuan repeated what he did and continued collecting heavenly medicines.

Of course, with this method of collection, it was impossible to collect all of the heavenly medicines. But, collecting 70%-80% was still not a problem.

“Kid, how is it? Does it feel great?” Mi Tian said proudly.

“Indeed very amazing! Many of these heavenly medicines are not available on Rainclear Continent, they are really rare to the extreme. I didn’t expect that it all benefited me,” Ye Yuan praised.

“This bunch of guys, they are considered lucky. How can the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s Bloodcentral Devil Vine back then have just this bit of strength? Chaos aberrant isn’t said for fun! This Bloodcentral Devil Vine is most likely that guy’s descendant. It’s just a shame that it didn’t have sufficient blood to support it, and it only has this bit of strength now,” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Who could have thought that the powerful Bloodcentral Devil Vine actually has bad eyesight! As long as you move about in his blind spot, you won’t be attacked?”

This was the reason why Ye Yuan was safe and sound! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Bloodcentral Devil Vine’s strength was extremely formidable. Even in the same rank, it was virtually invincible too.

But, it had its flaws too, that was that it had a blind spot in perception.

However, this blind spot was not static, but constantly moving.

Only an existence like Mi Tian would know about the Bloodcentral Devil Vine’s blind spot.

Otherwise, even if they knew that it had this shortcoming, it would be difficult to find it too.

At the periphery, a hint of a smile suddenly surfaced on Saint Exalt Skyfortune’s face and he said, “Everyone doesn’t need to get agitated. It’s naturally excellent that he can pluck these heavenly medicines out! We’ll just sit and reap the benefits of the fisherman!”

When the other Saint Exalts heard that, their eyes all lit up!

Yeah, why did they have to go and collect it?

After Ye Yuan returned from plucking them, wouldn’t it do if they directly snatched it?

“Haha,?it’s still Fellow Daoist Skyfortune who is shrewd! Such a dangerous thing, it’s better for others to go and do it!” Saint Exalt Waycloud said with a loud laugh when he heard that.

Ye Yuan’s movements were very fast, plucking those heavenly medicines clean very quickly.

Following that, Big Yellow directly jumped out of the circle with a leap.

And outside, the six great Saint Exalts have already been casting covetous eyes.

The moment Ye Yuan came out, they immediately blocked all of the escape routes.

“Kid, you’ve worked hard! Hand over all the heavenly medicines and you can get lost!” Waycloud said with a cold smile.

Now, with helpers, he could finally avenge the enmity.

Skyfortune also said coolly, “Little Brother, no matter how strong the Saint Exalt true spirit is, it’s also impossible to fight one-versus-six! If you’re sensible, better hand it over, we won’t make things difficult for you! You can keep the grade four heavenly medicines for yourself.”

“Huhu,

?weren’t you very cocky just now? Be cocky again for this exalt to see!” Saint Exalt Waycloud had an appearance like he had cornered Ye Yuan as he mocked.

But Ye Yuan did not care at all and said with a smile, “If I were you guys, I’d be worried about yourselves first! I’ve prepared a big gift for you guys, hope that you all like it.”

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Ye Yuan’s voice had yet to fade when the ground actually started vibrating.

The expressions of the Saint Exalts changed wildly, only feeling a wave of terrifying to the extreme undulation surging towards this side.

“This … What’s going on here? Seems like there’s a large group of powerhouses with terrifying strength heading over here!” Saint Exalt Waycloud said in alarm.

Saint Exalt Skyfortune stared fixedly at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Kid, what did you do?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s nothing. I just let several dozen Saint Sovereign Heaven true spirits out. If you all want the heavenly medicines, you can totally come and snatch them. But, whether or not you can escape in a while, I won’t dare to guarantee it.”

“What?! S-Several dozen true spirits! You’re insane!” Saint Exalt Waycloud’s entire body trembled and he said in horror.

Just the auras that he felt, there were more than a dozen that were not weaker than him!

In fact, there were even several who were significantly stronger than him!

That appearance was clearly middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, even upper Saint Sovereign Heaven!

This kind of terrifying aura, how could it be what they all could resist?

“Huhu,?you all are allowed to find helpers, but I’m not allowed to find helpers? Whether or not you want the heavenly medicines, decide yourselves,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

These true spirits were actually all reared by the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

The powerhouses of the Labyrinth Divine Palace all had their own mounts when they traveled back then.

Of course, those truly powerful true spirits had long already died out.

These true spirits that Ye Yuan released were all the descendants of the true spirits that the Labyrinth Divine Palace raised in the past.

These true spirits were all raised by the Labyrinth Divine Palace with special methods. They did not have any intelligence at all, only primitive wildness.

After they reached Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm, many were unable to transcend the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation, so they repeated the process of multiplying like that.

Before Ye Yuan came here, he quietly released these true spirits under Mi Tian’s guidance. Then, he lured these true spirits to go crazy and head over here.

Big Yellow alone was naturally not the match of these Saint Exalts joining forces.

Therefore, Ye Yuan was long prepared.

The faces of the six great Saint Exalts flickered indeterminately. As for the other Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses and even half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens, they had long fled.

This commotion was too terrifying!

“RUN!” Saint Exalt Waycloud finally could not bear the pressure and turned around and ran!

How could the other five still dare to stay? Being besieged by dozens of Saint Sovereign Heaven true spirits, it was totally impossible for them to escape alive!

They could only run!

Ye Yuan smiled slightly. Patting Big Yellow, he said, “Big Yellow, come on!”

Big Yellow took a step forward and walked into the dense woods unhurriedly, as if not worried about these Saint Exalt true spirits at all.
