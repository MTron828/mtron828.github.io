Chapter 1914: Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital

The legacy left behind by Sacred Ancestor High Priest let Ye Yuan have a clear understanding of Alchemy Dao realms.

Before the Dao Realm was the Initial Realm, surface level, ignorant about Dao; getting to know the Alchemy Dao was the Initial Realm.

Initial Realm alchemists relied entirely on experience when refining pills and could not find the proper approach. Hence, it was very hard to refine high-quality medicinal pills.

After Initial Realm was Dao Realm. Dao Realm alchemists already understood the Great Dao. Refining pills were accomplished with high proficiency, refining divine-grade divine pills were also accomplished with high proficiency.

Ye Yuan entered this realm since he triggered Great Dao Heavenly Melody.

At present, 100 years of comprehending Dao and creating the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill, his comprehension into the divine soul and Alchemy Dao grew deeper with each passing day, Dao Realm also finally reached the realm of grand completion.

Just as Ye Yuan predicted, the comprehension of this Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill let him have a tremendous understanding of Alchemy Dao.

Presently, although it still remained at the deducing stage, it already let him obtain tremendous benefits.

According to the inheritance left behind by Sacred Ancestor High Priest, there was an even higher realm above Dao Realm; that was the Ancestor Realm.

The Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest resided in this realm.

Ancestor Realm was an even more drawn-out realm. It was not just the two of them that reached Ancestor Realm, some Transcendent Heavenly Emperors were likewise able to reach this realm, but these two people clearly walked further.

Ye Yuan’s Dao Realm was at grand completion and only a step away from the Ancestor Realm. It was just that this step was far too difficult.

Alchemists capable of reaching grand completion Dao Realm could similarly be counted on the fingers of one hand. The majority were some formidable characters among Seven-star and Eight-star.

As for the Ancestor Realm, that was even rarer.

Ye Yuan was presently at the grand completion Dao Realm. It could be said that his comprehension in the Alchemy Dao already surpassed over 90% of the Heavenspan World’s alchemists!

And he was merely at rank five presently.

After more than ten years’ time, an upheaval transformation already happened to Heavenly Eagle.

In over a decade, a large batch of Celestial Deity powerhouses sprung up, Divine Lord Realms were even too many to enumerate. The overall strength of Heavenly Eagle rose to a new high.

Most important, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City already became just like a small-scale alchemy holy land.

Presently, the alchemists who rushed over from other places, hoping to join the Pill Tower, were too many to count.

The Pill Tower also drafted strict assessment criteria to select talents.

When Ye Yuan exited seclusion, Tong’er and Treasure Pig were already waiting outside long ago.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Treasure Pig flew over with a whoosh, tunneling straight into Ye Yuan’s bosom, the intention of curry favor was very obvious.

“Grunt, grunt!”

Treasure Pig seemed to have discovered Ye Yuan’s difference and cried very happily.

Tong’er sensed something, a hint of surprise flashing across his eyes as he said, “Heart carefree like clouds, will akin to running water flowing east and west, you ... are at grand completion Dao Realm?”

Grand completion Dao Realm was an extremely mysterious and abstruse realm. Those able to touch it were exceedingly few.

But Tong’er was someone in Dao Realm to begin with, so he could naturally detect Ye Yuan’s changes.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Secluding for 10 years, I finally have some understanding. It’s indeed at the grand completion!”

Hearing this, the corners of Tong’er’s mouth twitched slightly, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan became complicated.

As a Seven-star Alchemy God and being able to satisfy Treasure Pig, Tong’er’s strength naturally went without saying.

In reality, he had long stepped into the Dao Realm, making his Alchemy Dao strength far surpassing same rank alchemists.

“You punk, truly a freak! Could it be that you really comprehended the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill?” Tong’er said rather disbelievingly.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “How is that possible? I haven’t even touched spirit medicines, I just have some direction. As for whether it can succeed or not, it will depend on Bai Chen that kid’s fortunes.”

Tong’er’s heart felt a chill. Ye Yuan saying so indicated that he definitely had some confidence.

Creating a new kind of medicinal pill, furthermore, it was this kind of extremely high difficulty medicinal pill, this was absolutely not that simple of a matter. It needed countless deductions and failures before it had a possibility of succeeding.

Suddenly, Tong’er looked at Ye Yuan with a heated gaze and said, “Heavenly Eagle’s resources are unable to support you to complete this pill formula at all. So what do you plan to do?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I know, so I plan on making a trip to Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital and hope to reach an agreement with the Myriad Treasure Tower. That way, we won’t lack spirit medicines anymore.”

Tong’er suddenly said: “Since you’re already at grand completion Dao Realm, I need you to help me refine a medicinal pill.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said, “There’s naturally no problem! It’s just that rank five divine pills doesn’t seem to have any effect on you, right?”

Tong’er shook his head and said, “The cultivation method that my lineage cultivates is rather peculiar. Although the cultivation speed is very fast, every 50 thousand years, I’ll return to boyhood from old age once, the time as long as a thousand years! Each time I return to boyhood from old age, my body, looks, strength, will recover to the appearance of a seven to an eight-year-old child. In these 1000 years, I’m unable to cultivate and can only remain at the strength when I was seven or eight. However, our lineage left behind several pill formulas. As long as we consume the medicinal pills, we can recover to a corresponding strength. With your current realm, coupled with grand completion Dao Realm strength, the medicinal pill refined should be able to let me recover to True God Realm.”

“So that’s how it is! No problem, leave this to me.” Ye Yuan suddenly saw the light, only now knowing why Tong’er would become like this.

But Ye Yuan became interested too. If Tong’er could really recover True God Realm strength, then Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would undoubtedly have an additional genuine powerhouse holding down the fort.

At that time, even when facing the Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s three great powers, they would also have the strength to protect themselves.

Ye Yuan could not help having a headache when he saw the pill formula.

This medicinal pill was called Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill, a type of level nine difficulty super rank five divine pill. The refining difficulty was extremely great.

In fact, it was even a notch higher than the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill.

The spirit medicines on it, each type was extremely precious. No wonder Tong’er never mentioned this matter all the way until now.

...

After Ye Yuan delegated over some matters, he brought Bai Chen, Ning Tianping, Tong’er, Treasure Pig, as well as the Myriad Treasure Tower’s Xiao Feng, and left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

After a thousand years passed, Xiao Feng’s present strength was also no longer what it was in the past.

It was just that his age was a little too old, his potential long already exhausted. Even with Ye Yuan’s help, his improvement was also limited.

Presently, he still remained at the realm of Four-star Alchemy God.

But to Xiao Feng, his present realm was already what he did not dare to imagine.

To be able to walk until this step today, he was naturally overwhelmed with gratefulness toward Ye Yuan.

Inside the Purple Extreme Hall, a group of people sat opposite facing each other.

“This trip, I’ll have to trouble Brother Xiao,” Ye Yuan said.

Xiao Feng smiled bitterly and said, “Younger Brother Ye, you’re too serious. I’m merely a measly Four-star Alchemy God. I don’t even count as a supporting cast in the great imperial capital. During this trip, you’ll likely still have to bring out your own strength! But there’s one thing that you can rest assured about; the cities under the Myriad Treasure Tower mostly treat earning money as a top priority. As long as there are profits to be earned, they won’t refuse.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I heard that the one in charge of Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital is Empyrean Flutterfeather. He himself is a Seven-star Alchemy God, with his Alchemy Dao cultivation being exceedingly high. Not at all inferior compared to the powerhouses under the Medicine Ancestor’s command. Wonder if I can experience his splendor this time or not!”
