Chapter 1329: Fatal Encirclement!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Your Excellency, something seems to be not quite right! This Ghost King Cave ... is too quiet!” The guide’s expression was not too good as he said.

Wang Yutao’s face fell, and he said, “Enough crap! You just have to care about leading the way! I don’t believe that the kid can still overturn the heavens!”

No need the guide to warn, how could Wang Yutao not know that something was amiss.

They had always been on guard after entering the Ghost King Cave. But along the way, they did not even run into a single evil spirit.

Since the Ghost King Cave was one of the Yin Wind Den’s most dangerous places, then there should be a lot of evil spirits.

Wang Yugan also felt all the hairs on his body stand on end as he could not resist saying, “Second Brother, it’s better to withdraw! As long as we guard the entrance, will we still be afraid that the kid doesn’t come out?”

Wang Yugan’s suggestion made Wang Yutao palpitate with excitement as well.

“If he risks his life and just hole up inside here and not go out?” Wang Yutao asked.

The moment the guide heard that Wang Yutao was moved, he hurriedly said, “Impossible! Even grand completion Grotto Profound powerhouse can only last at most a year here. Any longer, the Yin energy here will corrode the fleshy body and cause tremendous damage to the physical body. If mild, it will damage the Martial Dao foundation. If severe, one will become a Yin corpse!”

Wang Yutao’s expression changed, not expecting that this Yin Wind Den still had so many things to pay attention to.

Since it was like this, he could rest assured.

“Okay, we’ll withdraw!” Wang Yutao’s heart was also somewhat pounding as he said.

But just as they turned around and were about to withdraw, Yin wind suddenly stirred up.

Woo! Woo!

All around, no idea where heaps of evil spirits emerged from either, all late-stage One-star!

Looking at the numbers, there were probably no less than a thousand!

Such a scale of evil spirits, even Wang Yutao, this kind of powerhouse, felt his scalp tingle too.

Although grand completion Grotto Profound could casually crush late-stage Grotto Profound, it was not to say that grand completion Grotto Profound was invincible.

Evil spirits were more difficult to tangle with in the first place for martial artists.

With over one thousand evil spirits jumping out all at once, even if Wang Yutao and Wang Yugan joined hands, they also did not dare say to be able to retreat unscathed.

“This ... What’s going on here? Where in the world did these evil spirits emerge from?”

“Second Elder, w-what should we do?”

“So many late-stage One-star evil spirits, we’re dead for sure this time!”

...

The faces of these Wang Family second generation powerhouses all turned green.

An aura of despair was spreading among them.

One late-stage One-star evil spirit was already enough for them to suffer. A thousand appearing all at once, how could they not despair?

“All shut up for me! Shouting and wrangling, can it scare away these evil spirits? All follow this old man, kill the way out together!”

Wang Yutao still had overwhelming prestige. This shout instantly calmed the Wang Family’s people.

At the same time, he raised his long spear. A terrifying force struck toward the evil spirits ahead.

“Howl! Howl!”

Miserable cries lingered incessantly by the ears. Late-stage One-star evil spirits were still a little too tender in front of Wang Yutao.

Except, not only did Wang Yutao’s overwhelming blow not frighten away the evil spirits, it made those evil spirits even more crazed instead, pouncing over at the crowd.

“Yugan, you cover the rear, I’ll open up the path in front! The others, take precautions on your own. Don’t let those evil spirits break in!”

Wang Yutao had clearly seen a grand spectacle before. Although alarmed, he did not panic, commanding with great composure.

He and Wang Yugan, two great experts, protected the team one front and one back. The other people’s pressure lessened drastically all at once.

However, the number of evil spirits was seriously too many. Furthermore, each and every one of them was ferocious and did not fear death. They just did all they could to bite.

Very soon, there was somebody who could not hold on anymore.

“ARGH!!”

A Wang Family’s guard whose strength was slightly weaker was suddenly brought down by four or five evil spirits.

The evil spirits were seemingly sharks that smelled the scent of blood. Around 20 to 30 evil spirits instantly drowned him out entirely.

Before long, that guard ceased breathing.

His divine soul was already divided and eaten by the evil spirits.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them felt a chill.

Maybe this was their outcome not long after!

Those evil spirits tasting the benefits, only tussled with Wang Yutao and Wang Yugan, while the focus of the attacks was placed on those Wang Family members in the center.

Very soon, there was another Wang Family’s member who was taken down.

“Lingqiu!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Wang Yutao’s gaze turned bloodshot from anger. That person who died was his biological nephew.

Before coming, he never dreamed that employing the Wang Family’s power to come and hunt down an initial-stage Grotto Profound brat, he would actually pay such a terrible price.

Except, sad was sad. He was completely powerless about the reduction in numbers when battling.

A hundred evil spirits pestered him. Even if his strength was any greater, he was too busy to care as well.

A single mishap and he would even stumble himself.

Two late-stage Grotto Profound experts defending, this group of people gradually approached the cave entrance.

It was just that miserable cries echoed incessantly in Wang Yutao’s ears.

His heart was dripping blood!

“Kill!”

A terrifying charge, Wang Yutao finally forcefully carved out a bloody path, charging out of the Ghost King Cave.

The current Wang Yutao’s eyes were blood-red, already unbelievably furious.

One figure after another charged out. Finally, Wang Yugan also came out in the end.

Boom!

The evil spirits did not have the intention of letting these people off. Large groups rushed out of the Ghost King Cave and continued to hunt down everyone.

Wang Yutao was aggrieved to the extreme and could only lead everyone to continue fleeing.

No idea how long they chased them either, there were finally no more evil spirits behind them. Everyone was all seemingly drained of energy, plopping down onto the ground, panting heavily for air.

Wang Yutao swept a glance over the remaining people, the joints of his fingers cracking.

When they went in, counting in the guide, they brought a total of 17 people!

But now, counting in him and Wang Yugan, there were only five people left!

This in and out actually forcefully incapacitated 12 people!

Apart from the guide, those Wang Family’s people were all the Wang Family’s elites.

Quite a number of people were all Wang Yutao’s sons and nephew generation.

Among them, the majority were all late-stage Grotto Profound powerhouses. There were even a few who were middle-stage Grotto Profound.

This trip directly cut the Wang Family’s elites by half!

“Ye Yuan, if I don’t avenge this grudge, I, Wang Yutao, am lesser than a human! This old man swears an oath to heaven that I must cut you down in this Yin Wind Den!”

Wang Yutao’s eyes were blood-red, gnashing his teeth in hatred, already hating Ye Yuan to the max.

He naturally would not think that it was actually them pursuing Ye Yuan all along.

Either way, others killing the Wang Family’s members, that was all the other person’s fault.

...

Inside the Ghost King Cave, Chang Liang five brothers were long dumbstruck with amazement already.

They exchanged glances, all with an expression like they had seen a ghost.

“B-Big Brother, what did we see just now? O-Our eyesight wouldn’t be failing, right?”

“How did he do it? Those ... Those were a thousand late-stage One-star evil spirits! He ... He’s actually able to command late-stage One-star evil spirits!”

Chang Liang looked at the Ye Yuan currently in meditation, his gaze full of deep apprehension!

Only this time, did they witness Ye Yuan’s true strength!

For Ye Yuan to want to kill them, it was truly as easy as turning his palm over!
