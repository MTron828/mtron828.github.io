Chapter 1293: Sisterly Affection

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I ... I’m going to kill you, lecher!”

Under shame and rage, Liang Wanrong raised a sword and stabbed over towards Ye Yuan.

But halfway there, she noticed that Ye Yuan was currently looking at her with a smile that was not a smile.

Liang Wanrong was suddenly startled, her figure abruptly stopping. Her gaze that looked at Ye Yuan was full of fear.

Liang Wanrong felt a cool breeze at her back, secretly thinking that it was a close call.

During the day, she fell for it without understanding anything and did not even know how she succumbed.

But she was certain that it was absolutely related to Ye Yuan!

“Zhang Shun ...”

Liang Wanrong was just about to order Zhang Shun when she suddenly remembered her actions during the day, her face flushing even redder.

Liang Wanrong even felt that even if the one she acted indecently to was Ye Yuan, it would have more face than Zhang Shun.

After all, Ye Yuan’s identity was unknown, while Zhang Shun was a subordinate. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With this, she was really in a dilemma.

The one in a dilemma was not just her, there was also Zhang Shun and the group of guards.

Zhang Shun was an experienced veteran in the end and suddenly said, “Second Miss, ahead is the Myriad Beast Forest! At this time, we’ll require you and Eldest Miss to cooperate to be able to lead us through together!”

Liang Wanrong was not an idiot in the end. Seeing that there was a way out, she hurriedly said, “Mm, what you said is right!”

...

After resting, the group of people entered the Myriad Beast Forest.

The Myriad Beast Forest was not a safe place. There were quite a number of divine beasts inside!

The divine beasts that were extinct in the Immortal Grove World were everywhere in the Heavenspan World!

Inside the Myriad Beast Forest were mostly ordinary demonic beasts. But the divine beasts that occasionally appeared were human martial artists’ nightmare.

After entering the Myriad Beast Forest, Ye Yuan distinctly sensed Zhang Shun becoming alert.

The awkwardness from before was already completely replaced by solemnness.

The Profound Essence Pill was worthy of being a high-grade Tier 1 divine pill. After several days, Ye Yuan could already get down and walk around.

Even though he did not look much different from the average person, he was at least able to move already.

“Miss Wanru, could you let this Ye diagnose your pulse? This Ye is an alchemist. Maybe I can help you!” On the carriage, Ye Yuan told her this.

Ye Yuan’s temperament had always been very easy-going. Liang Wanru did not have the intention of avoiding and nodded her head to allow it.

After a round of diagnosing, Ye Yuan’s brows also knitted together.

The matter did not seem to be as simple as he imagined. Ye Yuan searched through the medicinal pills that he grasped and discovered that there was not a kind that was able to resolve Liang Wanru’s symptoms.

Logically speaking, for hereditary deaf and mute, one could use medicinal pills to resolve. It was not a big deal in the Immortal Grove World.

However, Liang Wanru’s body’s situation seemed to be totally different from the Immortal Grove World!

This kind of innate muteness required the power of laws to resolve!

But Ye Yuan was completely clueless about divine pills!

His trumpet seemed to be blown a little too loudly.

Previously, Ye Yuan also thought that treating Liang Wanru’s muteness was very easy. Looking at it now, it was not that simple.

“Senior, for Miss Wanru’s situation, is there a low-grade Tier 1 divine pill that can resolve it?” Ye Yuan asked Dustless.

Ye Yuan already knew that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove had extraordinary attainments in Alchemy Dao.

The Soul Suppressing Pearl was Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s reliance!

Only with sufficient strong soul force could one have sufficiently great attainments in Alchemy Dao!

Dustless said, “That is, of course! In my view, when this Liang Wanru was born, she should have suffered an undeserved calamity, that’s why it resulted in this kind of situation! The descendants of Deity Realm powerhouses, even if a mortal, would not have this kind of situation occur either! Liang Wanru’s situation belongs to absent laws. The low-grade Tier 1 divine pill, Wisdomless Pill, can resolve this kind of situation.”

Ye Yuan muttered, “Wisdomless Pill? Senior Dustless, I wonder how should this medicinal pill be refined?”

The only divine pill that Ye Yuan could refine right now was the Dao Defying Pill.

Wisdomless Pill, he had not even heard of it before. Naturally, refining it was out of the question.

Alchemy Dao, on the one hand, it was comprehending Heavenly Dao. On the other hand, it was a deep understanding of spirit medicines.

The two aspects were indispensable!

Ye Yuan’s comprehensions towards Alchemy Dao might have barely managed to reach the level. But regarding spirit medicines, he was utterly clueless.

Dustless listed several kinds of spirit medicines. Ye Yuan simply had never heard of them before!

Harboring the mentality of giving it a try, Ye Yuan said to Liang Wanru, “Miss Wanru, I wonder if you’re familiar with the Heart Linking Grass, Tian Wang Branch, Purple Caltrop, these three types of spirit medicines or not?”

Liang Wanru was rather surprised. But after staring blankly, she walked to a carriage and pointed at a wooden box.

“This is ... the Heart Linking Grass?”

Under Dustless’ guidance, Ye Yuan knew about the origins of the spirit medicine inside this box.

Divine rank spirit medicine, Heart Linking Grass!

Ye Yuan reached his hand out towards that wooden box but was stopped by Zhang Shun halfway.

“Boy! On account of Eldest Miss’s face, I must give it! But these spirit medicines are all items that Master purchased. They are very important! If you want to touch, don’t blame this Zhang for not being courteous!”

Zhang Shun’s words were full of disdain!

A cripple who was unable to even gather divine essence actually wanted to poke his nose into divine rank spirit medicines, what was this if not a toad luster after swan meat?

These divine rank spirit medicines were all the Liang Family’s important material reserves. How could he allow a stranger to encroach on it?

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “So that’s how it is! It was this Ye who was rude!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan stepped aside and really did not touch those spirit medicines anymore.

Zhang Shun was stunned, not expecting that Ye Yuan was actually so forthright.

But very soon, the expression on his face changed, and he shouted, “Stop!”

Liang Wanrong said in puzzlement, “Guard Zhang, what is it?”

Zhang Shun’s expression was solemn as he said, “Something is not right!”

“What’s not right? Isn’t it pretty alright like this now?” Liang Wanrong said.

Zhang Shun said, “It’s precisely because it’s like this, that something is amiss! Passing through the Myriad Beast Forest, things absolutely won’t be so quiet! Along the way, even if we’re any more careful, we’ll encounter the obstruction of demonic beasts too! The quieter it is, the more amiss the situation is!”

Liang Wanrong knew that Zhang Shun was a veteran in this area.

Since he said so, then it was definitely a sure thing.

Zhang Shun’s voice had yet to fade when shadows loomed from inside the forest. Those figures that disappeared and reappeared again like smoke already utterly surrounded Ye Yuan’s party.

Among them, there were faintly several powerful undulations. They were divine beasts without a doubt!

Zhang Shun’s expression was incomparably ugly, and he said with a solemn look, “Second Miss, this seems to be ... a beast tide!”

Liang Wanrong’s face changed. She had naturally heard the reputation of the beast tide before.

Demonic beasts that covered the hills and filled the plains surrounded them, making it hard for them to escape even with wings!

Liang Wanrong never thought that she would actually encounter this kind of thing.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Hordes of wild beasts’ roars echoed throughout the entire Myriad Beast Forest.

They were already completely surrounded by these demonic beasts!

Right at this time, Liang Wanrong suddenly walked towards Liang Wanru and said with a bitter smile, “Elder Sister, didn’t expect that we fought for so much, but would actually perish in this place together!”

Liang Wanru froze, her eyes immediately revealing a gentle look.

A person’s words were nice when near death, birds cry plaintively before they died too.

She did not expect that Liang Wanrong actually thoroughly saw the light at this time!

Liang Wanru smiled slightly and shook her head, indicating that she did not mind.

Liang Wanrong took Liang Wanru’s hand and said with a sigh, “Elder Sister, in the past, it was all my fault. Don’t hate me, okay?”

Liang Wanru nodded her head, a look of relief on her face.

Chiii ...

But right at this time, the sound of a blade being drawn sounded out.

“Hahaha ... demonic beasts are extremely sensitive towards fresh blood. My good elder sister, if you die, it can let this younger sister escape alive! We can also be considered deeply affectionate sisters!” Liang Wanrong said with a loud laugh.
