Chapter 2524: Same Lineage!

Heavenly Stratum powerhouses who just ascended were not considered Heavenly Stratum powerhouses in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven at all.

Even the most ordinary lower Lesser Sublime Heavens could devastate them at will.

Although the Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger was not considered very formidable, tearing an ascender like Ye Yuan to shreds was easy to accomplish.

It was just that the result was just the opposite.

Ye Yuan killed it with one punch!

How could they know that Ye Yuan was not some ordinary ascender?

Ordinary ascenders tend to shatter the firmament with one power of rule.

But Ye Yuan had four apart from Alchemy Dao!

Furthermore, it was a four-way fusion!

His strength was naturally much worse when compared to a grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven like Jun Tian.

But compared to ordinary lower Lesser Sublime Heavens, he was a great deal stronger!

During the few months in this Inklight Forest, Ye Yuan already gradually adapted to the rule pressure here.

Apart from time law, Ye Yuan could already mobilize the other three types of power of rule.

What did killing a Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger count as?

Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu looked at each other, both feeling unbelievably ashamed and resentful.

Pah!

Pah!

The two each gave their subordinate a slap and said in unison, “Useless thing!”

Gui Tianyu arrived in front of Ye Yuan and said fiercely, “Brat, don’t think that by killing a Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger, it’s impressive! This thing, I can kill it by huffing a puff! Ants will always be ants!”

Ye Yuan raised the Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger up and said with a smile, “Come, huff a puff.”

Gui Tianyu’s face turned black and almost smacked Ye Yuan to death with a slap.

Even the Yang Xuezhen who was clouded with worry was also amused.

Huffing a puff, it was naturally boasting.

Gui Tianyu huffing a puff was sufficient to kill those martial artists in the Heavenspan World.

But no matter how weak this Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger was, it was still a true spirit!

True spirits were existences equivalent to Heavenly Stratum.

It was not hard for Gui Tianyu to kill, but being able to kill by huffing a puff was purely talking nonsense.

After the farce, Yang Xuezhen pulled Ye Yuan to one side.

Seeing this scene, Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu became even more jealous.

Yang Xuezhen’s looks were exquisite. She was an extremely beautiful woman. It was just that her face had an anxious look from start to end, giving people a feeling of keeping strangers at bay.

“We’ll be able to get out of Inklight Forest tomorrow. Let’s go our separate ways here. Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s native powerhouses discriminate against ascenders greatly. If not for me, my two senior apprentice brothers would likely have already killed you. If you want to live, go to Five Light Heavenly Region. That place is the territory of ascenders. You don’t have a way out in True Yang Heavenly Domain.” Yang Xuezhen said in earnest.

Ye Yuan had long discovered it. The ascender aura on his body was completely different from Yang Xuezhen and the rest. It could be identified easily.

It seemed like in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, ascenders and native Heavenly Stratum powerhouses were two camps that were distinct from each other!

This kind of situation was like locals looking down on outsiders.

This sense of superiority was innate.

Although he did not know just where this sense of superiority lay.

Ye Yuan said, “I just arrived and know absolutely nothing about Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. Wonder if Miss can allow for this convenience and let this Ye tag along to learn for some time? Otherwise, if I were to go out rashly, I’d probably die without even knowing how.”

“This …” Yang Xuezhen could not help hesitating.

What Ye Yuan said made sense too.

It was just that she was currently unable to even fend for herself. So how could she bring Ye Yuan along?

Ye Yuan was naturally not really afraid of going out himself. He was just following Yang Xuezhen to return a favor.

He could tell that Yang Xuezhen was kind-hearted. It was just that her family suffered a catastrophe. That was why she would become melancholic and moody.

Those two senior apprentice brothers did not harbor good intentions at all. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

If Ye Yuan let Yang Xuezhen leave freely, it would be equivalent to watching her enter the tiger’s maws like a sheep.

He, Ye Yuan, could not do this kind of thing.

“Honestly speaking, returning to Eastward Country this time, I’m actually surrounded by enemies on all sides. It’s very dangerous for you to follow me!” Yang Xuezhen said seriously.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The way I am, isn’t it dangerous wherever I go? To me, an unknown world is more dangerous. Miss is kind-hearted, I’d rather believe in Miss.”

Yang Xuezhen thought about it and said, “Then … alright.”

… …

In the dead of night, Ye Yuan’s consciousness sank into the chaos world, viewing the Heavenspan Mountain.

However, he was at a loss on what to do.

“These few months, I’ve already observed it no less than ten thousand times. But I don’t have any leads about this Wordless Heavenly Skill! Could it be that I’m really not fated with this skill?”

Ye Yuan did not lack patience, but after several months of hard work and not finding a way out, he could not help giving birth to doubt.

He shook his head and put aside the distractions, and continued observing.

Gradually, Ye Yuan only felt his eyelids get heavier and heavier, and he actually fell asleep.

In his dream, Ye Yuan arrived in an isolated space.

An enormous book was suspended above the void.

That book had an archaic aura that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life, which seemingly came from ancient times, stirring the soul.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled and he cried out in surprise, “Wordless Heavenly Skill!”

But very soon, he suddenly came to realize the truth and said with a bitter smile, “What you think about in the day, you will dream of it at night! I actually saw the Wordless Heavenly Skill in my dreams. Looks like I’m really bewitched. However … even if I know that it’s in a dream, I still couldn’t extricate myself!”

Ye Yuan went up and flipped open the title page of the book.

Woodless!

Ye Yuan was taken aback and said, “Wordless Heavenly Skill??Huhu,?this is the Wordless Heavenly Skill? If it’s wordless, how does one cultivate it?”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s eyes blurred.

The Wordless Heavenly Book suddenly turned into a cloud of chaos. Being situated in it, Ye Yuan felt a primeval aura.

It felt as if he had returned to the womb.

Amidst the chaos, Ye Yuan felt delicate streams of air currents flowing.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “This … Could the flow of this air current be the skill circulatory route? This cloud of chaos is actually quite similar to back then when my chaos just blossomed. It’s just that my chaos seems to be just like a baby in front of it!”

Ye Yuan’s heart was shocked to the extreme.

He discovered that the Chaos Heavenspan Canon he had comprehended was actually of the same lineage as this chaos!

Looking at it like this, it was no accident that he comprehended the Chaos Heavenspan Canon.

What he comprehended was merely a drop in the ocean of the Wordless Heavenly Skill.

Ye Yuan carefully felt the flow of that air current, not daring to miss the slightest bit.

But very soon, he could not bear it anymore!

Too complicated!

No idea how long had passed either. Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, and he startled awake.

His consciousness hurriedly sank into his small world, attempting to find clues from the Heavenspan Mountain.

But sadly, he was disappointed.

“Turns out that it was just a dream?” Ye Yuan’s tone exuded some helplessness.

But very soon, his expression changed.

He discovered that he did not forget the feeling of that air current flow!

“Within a person’s body is a small world. That air current should be the skill circulatory route of the Wordless Heavenly Skill!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, he imagined his own body to be a cluster of chaos.

Then he revolved his divine essence according to that feeling!

With a single circulatory cycle, Ye Yuan was wildly ecstatic in his heart!
