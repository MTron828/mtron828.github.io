Chapter 3033: Vertical Heaven Stairs!

Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven, one of humanity’s three great heavens.

This place was humanity’s world. It had the human race’s top major powers.

Of course, the geniuses here were also akin to schools of carps crossing the river, beyond counting.

Above the void, several figures looked down, their faces full of pride.

“Heh,?a group of ant-like things. Do they really think that there’s something like a meat pie falling from the sky in this world? Even if they pass through this Vertical Heaven Stairs, would this inheritance really fall on their heads?”

The one who spoke was a young master. He was called Zuo Qingyang, the direct descendant of the Zuo Family that was the top noble family of Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven.

He and these few people around him, were all the most talented juniors of Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven.

Their strength was unfathomable.

These few people were, respectively, the Melody Nether Heavenly Sect’s Lu Haoran, the Purple Extreme Heaven Pavilion’s Wang Ningyan, and the Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s Zhou Xianchen.

These four great factions virtually represented the apex of the human race!

Back then, the Labyrinth Divine Palace fell, but it pushed the human race to the apex of all the heavens.

Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven, Vast Court Firmament Limit Heaven, and Han Chong Miao Cheng Heaven rose domineeringly and were called humanity’s three supreme heavens!

Humanity’s three supreme heavens with 13 major factions and more than 10 Great Beyond Realm mighty experts could even suppress Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven by a notch.

Zuo Qingyang, Lu Haoran, Wang Ningyan, and Zhou Xianchen, this batch of people, virtually represented the strongest standards in all the heavens for humanity’s young generation!

Each of these people had the strength to jump realms and fight. They were strong to the extreme!

Therefore, the numerous living beings below them naturally could not enter their sights.

Vertical Heaven Stairs was that passageway leading to the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

Only by passing through the passageway was it considered completing the first test.

In every heaven and myriad worlds, how many did the human race numbered? Naturally, not everyone had the qualifications to enter the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

“Tch,?said it like this meat pie can smash on your head!” Zhou Xianchen said with a disdainful look.

Zuo Qingyang was not angry either, saying coolly, “Who doesn’t know how to brag? Actions speak louder than words. It’s time to see what someone is worth in a while.”

Unparalleled beauty Wang Ningyan, she was like her name, as if she was otherworldly.

It seemed like glancing at her would blaspheme her sacred face.

Only to see her slowly open her mouth and speak as beautifully as heavenly melody, “Brother Zuo makes sense. Actually, there’s no need for this kind of selection at all. Disregarding the other races, just talking about humanity, those who break out in the end won’t exceed the scope of 13 major factions. There’s no need for those low-level planes at all. That Heavenless is amazingly talented. He can even predict the future. But, in my view, it’s also nothing more than this.”

Zhou Xianchen and the rest nodded one after another.

Actually, they were very much in agreement with this kind of view.

It was just that these people were also secretly contending with each other and deliberately ridiculing the other party. That was all.

Zuo Qingyang said, “Can’t be bothered to be long-winded with you guys here anymore. I’m going down first! It’s time to let these ants feel ashamed of their unworthiness and beat a retreat in the face of difficulties.”

Finished talking, Zuo Qingyang’s figure moved and entered the Vertical Heaven Stairs.

Zhou Xianchen’s mouth curled, and he said, “This guy is really someone who’ll itch all over his body if he doesn’t posture for one day!”

Sure enough, a series of exclamations came over from the Vertical Heaven Stairs very quickly.

“So fast! Who is that, to actually be able to ignore the Great Dao pressure!”

“That’s the Zuo Family’s Zuo Qingyang! Well-deserving to be called the number one young master across all the heavens, his strength is really too strong!”

“With him around, so what even if we climb up the Vertical Heaven Stairs?”

“Sigh,?the gap is too big! I knew that I was hitting above my league! But, I’m really unwilling!”

“Everyone, don’t give up! Even if you can’t obtain the inheritance, as long as you can enter the Labyrinth Divine Palace, the harvest will be huge too!”

… …

Within the Vertical Heaven Stairs, many people started to feel ashamed of their unworthiness.

But, some people were naturally stubborn and were not willing to give up easily.

It was just that at this time, it was long already a blurry mess of flesh and blood within the Vertical Heaven Stairs?

Vertical Heaven Stairs, 99,999 steps. The higher up, the greater the Great Dao pressure.

Some people could not withstand the Great Dao pressure and were directly crushed into minced meat.

Just this difficulty was hell-level.

Those who were not true geniuses could not climb these hundred-thousand-step stairs at all.

However, this Great Dao pressure was very fair.

It had no requirement on cultivation realm. What it tested was only understanding of Dao.

Even if you were only Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, if your understanding of Dao was very deep, there was hope to pass the test too.

It was fine if cultivation realm was low; one could slowly comprehend.

Suddenly, several more figures in the crowd went up quickly. It was precisely Lu Haoran and the rest.

The three people turned into three afterimages, chasing right after Zuo Qingyang, the speed swift until the fleshy eye could not see clearly.

The three people’s appearance naturally set off another wave in the Vertical Heaven Stairs.

These four people’s strengths were seriously too strong.

Others had difficulty moving their feet on the Vertical Heaven Stairs, but they were akin to flat ground.

They even displayed movement techniques, not affected in the slightest.

This could not help making everyone sigh emotionally. The difference between people was really too great.

The four people’s movement techniques were extremely fast. The first 50 thousand steps could not stop their footsteps at all.

After 50 thousand, their speed gradually slowed down. But, they were much stronger than the rest too.

Regarding the steps in front, the Great Dao pressure was negligible to them.

Therefore, these few people were virtually running neck to neck.

All the way until 70 thousand steps later, some disparity finally gradually showed.

“Heh,?Zuo Qingyang, you’re too slow! At this rate, you’ll be caught up to by me!” Lu Haoran said.

Among the few people, he talked the least, but his strength was very strong. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Of course, the few of their strengths were all almost on par. Even if they were worse, they were also not much worse.

But, concerning this Vertical Heaven Stairs, 99,999 steps could divide the strength clearly.

Some things were obvious at a glance.

Sure enough, Zuo Qingyang had a black face and did not say a word.

However, Zuo Qingyang was not willing to easily admit defeat either and mustered up all of his strength.

Swoosh!

Zuo Qingyang’s figure leaped, directly jumping onto the platform.

He looked at the Lu Haoran behind him and ridiculed, “Lu Haoran, Zhou Xianchen, you guys are merely thus! However, Fairy Ningyan being in the first place, this Zuo is convinced!”

What this Vertical Heaven Stairs competed in was time.

He was the first to enter the Vertical Heaven Stairs. That was why he was first to climb up to the platform.

But at this time, the time that Wang Ningyan used was the least.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Three figures virtually got on the platform right after another.

And below them, people were still working hard to climb.

These four people actually caught up from behind. The first batch climbed onto the platform.

Lu Haoran said coolly, “What are you being smug for? I only used 80% of my strength. You’ve probably already used all of your strength, right?”

Zhou Xianchen also said disdainfully, “I only used 80% of my strength too. This position of first place naturally has to be given to Fairy Ningyan!”

Wang Ningyan’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Why? Could it be that my first place still needs to be handed out as charity by you guys?”

Zhou Xianchen smiled and said, “Look at this mouth of mine. Fairy Ningyan is the number one fairy maiden across all the heavens. Why would she need others to give alms? I was only angering Zuo Qingyang earlier. Fairy Ningyan’s first place is well-deserved!”

Wang Ningyang snorted coldly and said coolly, “Stop being talkative. Let’s go take a look at the All-Heavens List, and see who’s number one on this Vertical Heaven Stairs!”
