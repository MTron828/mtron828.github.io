Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Under the focus of all of the gazes, Empyrean Chaoyuan slowly got up.

He stroked his beard lightly and said smilingly, “This youth is formidable and worthy of respect! I’m not worthy of giving teachings. Let us compare notes.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, and he said with a smile, “Haha, toward Brother Chaoyuan, this Ye will definitely go all out!”

“What? Could it be that this isn’t Ye Yuan’s limit yet?”

The words made everyone incomparably shocked.

Grand completion Dao Realm already made everyone’s eyes fall to the ground.

But hearing the meaning in Ye Yuan’s words, he actually did not even go all out when crushing Empyrean Proudcloud like that just now!

This ... This was too terrifying!

Just where was this fellow’s limit?

All of the Empyreans used eyes like looking at a monster to look at Ye Yuan, their faces being full of doubt and shock.

Empyrean Chaoyuan was clearly very surprised too. It was only to see his two eyes narrowed together slightly, and then he said with a smile, “Alright, this old man will wait and see.”

Empyrean Chaoyuan took his seat. Empyrean Pilljade smiled and said, “In a while, you all have to open your eyes wide and watch. The battle of two great grand completion Dao Realms isn’t so easily seen. If you can comprehend just a little, you all will benefit for life!”

“What?! Empyrean Chaoyuan he ... is also grand completion Dao Realm?”

“No way, right? If Empyrean Chaoyuan is at the grand completion Dao Realm, wouldn’t he be even more formidable than some grandmasters? He’s actually still sitting on the Empyrean seats?”

“Empyrean Pilljade’s words hold true like an emperor’s, so it’s likely not far off! I really didn’t expect that there’s actually still this kind of mighty expert in the Empyrean seats. No wonder with Empyrean Purplewing’s strength, he can only lower himself to the second-rate seats.”

Clearly, everyone did not know Empyrean Chaoyuan’s true strength. There were even many Empyreans who had stupefied faces.

Empyrean Pilljade wanted to make use of Empyrean Chaoyuan to block Ye Yuan and chase him out of the Cloudpill Summit!

Everyone said that Empyrean Pilljade and Empyrean Flutterfeather were not on good terms. This was indeed the case.

But while surprise was surprise, everyone was still looking forward to this battle immensely.

Just as Empyrean Pilljade said, the clash of two great grand completion Dao Realms was bound to be a fierce struggle between two evenly-matched opponents.

This kind of alchemy battle was hard to come across in ten thousand years!

After the surprise, the alchemy battles continued.

It was just that the battles afterward no longer had much suspense.

Empyrean Daogan, Empyrean Wenlan, even the rank three Empyrean Remotenight, when they went up the stage, they all had expressions like their parents had died, being extremely ugly.

How venerated were their statuses? Now, they had to undergo a sure-lose alchemy battle under the watchful gazes of the people. It was really even more awful than killing them.

These few great Empyreans were all leading authority class figures. What they valued the most were their own feathers. Even if they really had to lose, it also could not be in front of so many people’s faces.

At this very moment, their intestines were green with regret.

But how could they have thought that Ye Yuan would actually be monstrous to such a degree?

Thinking about it now, their provocation seemed so laughable.

A late-stage Dao Realm expert challenging a grand completion Dao Realm powerhouse?

It was not on the same level at all, alright?!

The results were as expected. Even Empyrean Remotenight could not gain the least bit of advantage under Ye Yuan’s hands too, and he was defeated in the end.

But these few Empyrean’s final medicinal pill grades were all peak superior-grade without exception.

At this time, everyone finally came to realize the truth, turns out that Ye Yuan did it on purpose!

Even Empyrean Remotenight was firmly suppressed by Ye Yuan to peak superior-grade, so how terrifying was his control over alchemy?

Late-stage Dao Realm and grand completion Dao Realm, only being a hair away, but the strength was worlds apart.

After Empyrean Remotenight quietly walked off, everyone roused themselves.

The main show had arrived!

Even the powerhouses on the grandmaster seats also became 120% alert, looking forward to this pinnacle battle!

This match was absolutely a pinnacle battle!

Because Empyrean Realm Pilljade was the only Ancestor Realm powerhouse, no one was his match at all. So the battle of peak Dao Realm was the pinnacle battle.

The six great holy lands’ masters cherished their feathers, it was impossible to fight in front of people.

If not for a Ye Yuan appearing today, they could forget about seeing this kind of pinnacle battle all their lives.

Empyrean Chaoyuan looked towards Ye Yuan and said with a hint of marveling, “Truly didn’t expect that this old man would actually have a day where I’d cross swords with an opponent like you.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “In this world, the unexpected things are in the majority. The things within expectations are few.”

Empyrean Chaoyuan laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Good, an extraordinarily intelligent child! This old man hasn’t had this kind of blood-boiling feeling for far too long already. Encountering you today made this old man much younger all of a sudden!”

As he said this, he took out a medicinal cauldron. But it was not the Daytime Cauldron. It was a true god mystic treasure.

“This is the cauldron that this old man used back then. This old man won’t take advantage of you when crossing swords with you,” Empyrean Chaoyuan said.

But when Ye Yuan saw the situation, he shook his head and said, “Our battle should naturally call forth all the resources in our power. The Daytime Cauldron is Brother Chaoyuan’s highest standard. If this Ye has an empyrean spirit treasure, I’d also take it out without the slightest hesitation.”

When Empyrean Proudcloud heard this, he could not help smiling coldly as he said, “Truly arrogant to the extreme! He still dares to be so careless when facing off against Brother Chaoyuan!”

Empyrean Wenlan gave a cold snort and said, “Ignorant! Does he really think that he’s invincible under the heavens by entering grand completion Dao Realm? Facing Brother Chaoyuan’s strength, even holy land masters are somewhat wary, but you’re looking down on him here!”

These few people were all defeated at Ye Yuan’s hands and were very reluctant to give in in their hearts. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Now that they nabbed the chance, there naturally could not be dispensed with a bout of ridiculing.

Ye Yuan just smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “What do you know? This isn’t looking down on my opponent, but respecting my opponent. Dealing with you guys, this Ye couldn’t be bothered to use my full strength at all!”

The few people’s expressions changed, and they said in fury, “You! Unbridled! Wildly arrogant! When you lose to Brother Cloudpill Summit and leave the Cloudpill Summit dusty and dirty in appearance, I’ll see what you have to be arrogant!”

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s hard to come across a worthy opponent in life. Brother Chaoyuan is an opponent that this Ye respects! Toward opponents that I respect, this Ye will definitely go all out. So what even if I lose?”

These words were said valiantly, making the blood of the junior disciples in the plaza boil with excitement.

They saw through that Ye Yuan did not care about this grandmaster token at all.

Ye Yuan was enjoying the joy of battling in alchemy. This was seeking the apex of Alchemy Dao.

As for the grandmaster token, it was merely a worldly possession!

Cultivators of our generation should be like so!

For a moment, countless worshiping gazes were cast towards Ye Yuan.

“Hahaha! What a fine hard to come across a worthy opponent in life! Good, then this old man will go all out in this battle! Ye Yuan, regardless of whether victory or defeat, this old man will become friends with you, my friend across generations!” Empyrean Chaoyuan said with a big laugh.

With a thud, the Daytime Cauldron smashed onto the ring, giving off a series of horrifying undulations.

This Daytime Cauldron’s power was clearly several grades higher than even Empyrean Proudcloud’s Illusory Truth Cauldron.

“This old man was already at the grand completion Dao Realm 30 thousand years ago. I’ve gradually progressed in this realm for a long time. Coupled with the Daytime Cauldron, this peak empyrean spirit treasure, you have to be careful!” Empyrean Chaoyuan said with a laugh.

But Ye Yuan did not care at all and said calmly, “Please!”

Empyrean Chaoyuan nodded slightly. Seals formed in his hands and he said in a solemn voice, “Grand Luotian Thousand Illusory Dreamcloud True Art, release!”

The moment Empyrean Chaoyuan made his move, everyone’s expressions changed.
