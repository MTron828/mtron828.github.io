Chapter 2711: Unable to Teach!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the depths of the deep cave, a figure was faintly discernible in the darkness.

Shuoyan faced this shadow and did not even dare to breathe loudly.

After a long time, that shadow opened its mouth and said, “You’re Bright Tiger’s son?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Replying Lord Saint Exalt, my father is precisely the Bright Tiger King,” Shuoyan hurriedly said.

“Mn,?Bright Tiger gave birth to a fine son. What’s your name?”

“I’m called Shuoyan.”

“Shuoyan, are you willing to become this exalt’s disciple?”

Shuoyan was immediately stupefied there and was actually at a loss on what to do for a moment.

He completely did not think that Lord Saint Exalt actually wanted to take him in as a disciple!

Saint Sovereign Heaven, that was a god-like existence!

On the entire Rainclear Continent, there were countless powerhouses. But those able to step into Saint Sovereign Heaven could be counted with fingers.

Even Father, Bright Tiger King, already reached half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven; just half a step and he would be able to succeed in breaking through.

But he was ultimately still half a step away!

Half-step was a heavenly chasm!

This half-step was far too difficult!

Now, a god-like existence actually wanted to take him in as a disciple?

This was really a great thing that fell onto his lap!

Shuoyan revealed a look of wild elation and directly knelt down and said agitatedly, “Disciple pays respect to Master!”

The shadow nodded and said,?“Mn,?your bloodline power is very strong. With this exalt’s guidance, you have extremely high hopes of stepping into the realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven in the future! There are three great Saint Sovereign Heavens in this Myriad Demons Mountain. This exalt is called Saint Exalt Bull Demon! From now on, you’re this exalt’s disciple!”

“It turns out that Master is Saint Exalt Bull Demon! I heard Royal Father mentioned before that Saint Exalt Bull Demon swept across the Myriad Demons Mountain back then, overpowering myriad beasts and corroborated your Dao to become Saint Sovereign Heaven! Master attained Dao the latest, but Master is the strongest among the three great Saint Sovereign Heavens! Didn’t expect that this disciple actually has the fortune to acknowledge you as master!”

Hearing Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s name, Shuoyan could not help being overjoyed.

He did not expect that he would actually become the disciple of such a legend one day.

But Shuoyan knew that being able to become Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s disciple, a very large part of the credit belonged to Ye Yuan.

When he was on the brink of life and death previously, the reason why he could awaken his bloodline at the final juncture was due to Ye Yuan’s true grade heavenly pill playing a pivotal role!

True grade heavenly pills integrated the power of Great Dao. A portion of this Great Dao power still lurked in his body.

If not for this portion of power, it was impossible to awaken his bloodline by relying on his own talent.

Let alone being picked out by Saint Exalt Bull Demon and becoming his disciple.

“Those are all old events already. It’s not worth mentioning,” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said indifferently, without joy nor sorrow.

“Oh?right, Master, my Big Brother has bloodline talent too, can you give him some pointers too?” Shuoyan did not forget Ye Yuan and asked.

Who knew that Saint Exalt Bull Demon said coolly, “A trash bloodline martial artist can also be called to have bloodline talent? Humans shouldn’t appear in the Myriad Demons Mountain to begin with. I’ve already made Big Yellow go and dispose of him!”

Shuoyan’s expression changed wildly and he said, “What?! Master, you!”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon was indifferent and said lightly, “Remember, your bloodline is extremely noble and carries the power of chaos! He, a mere human, doesn’t have the qualifications to be associated with you!”

His voice had yet to fade when a terrifying dragon might came from outside the cave!

The sound of a dragon roar rose to the sky!

In the darkness, Saint Exalt Big Yellow’s expression changed wildly and he immediately transmitted his voice, “Big Yellow, stop!”

Outside the cave, Big Yellow’s expression was very ugly too.

Ye Yuan’s punch earlier actually forced him back three steps!

A middle Limitless Sublime Heaven, forced a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse back three steps, this was simply unimaginable!

One had to know, a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse could kill a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum with a wave of their hand.

Even if it was grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, it was also impossible to make him take half a step back!

But this young man in front of him did it.

Although this was him somewhat underestimating the enemy, forced back means forced back.

The power of that punch earlier could be rated as terrifying!

He believed that even a grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum would absolutely be blown up with one punch too!

Tyrannical!

Unparalleled!

Overbearing!

He was still mocking Ye Yuan for being a mixed-blood trash before. But a trash was actually able to unleash such a terrifying blow!

Got to admit, it was very face-slapping!

Turning angry from embarrassment, he was just about to make a move to kill Ye Yuan when he heard Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s voice transmission.

His expression was ugly as he said, “Lord Saint Exalt is asking you to go in!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and walked into the cave.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, it’s really great that you’re alright! Just now, it scared me to death!” Seeing Ye Yuan, Shuoyan said excitedly.

He was indeed frightened badly just now, he even thought that Ye Yuan was already killed.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s one martial technique actually made Saint Exalt Bull Demon change his mind.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Your big brother’s life is tenacious. I won’t die so easily.”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon opened his mouth and said, “Didn’t expect that this exalt will make an error of judgment too! Young man, you’re clearly of a human body. How can you have such a powerful true dragon bloodline?”

Ye Yuan’s bloodline was somewhat different from a true spirit’s bloodline.

His bloodline was recessive and did not take the initiative to release. The bloodline power would be hidden in the blood and one would not be able to tell at all.

But once it erupted, his dragon might would absolutely shock people.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s strength was transcendent, but he could only tell that Ye Yuan was a dragonblood martial artist.

Who knew that he had his face slapped with a backhand.

Just based on that move earlier, Ye Yuan’s bloodline power was absolutely not beneath Shuoyan’s!

He really made an error of judgment just now.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon also did not expect that he would actually encounter two heaven-defying bloodline powerhouses all at once!

Ye Yuan looked Saint Exalt Bull Demon and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Not killing me anymore?”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s face was somewhat embarrassed. Fortunately, they could not tell in the darkness of the cave.

“Since you’re a member of the dragon race, you’re naturally of my true spirit lineage too! Young man, are you willing to become this exalt’s disciple? With this exalt’s guidance, your chances of breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven are very high!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said.

To ordinary martial artists, breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven was definitely a huge temptation.

The Rainclear Continent had countless powerhouses, but how many people could break through?

Becoming a Saint Sovereign Heaven’s disciple, apart from being able to obtain even more resources, the greatest benefit was that they had the experience of breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven and knew what the deal was with breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Such an experience was the most valuable!

But Ye Yuan did not need it at all.

He replied with a question, “Lord Saint Exalt, I wonder if you can execute my punch earlier?”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon could not help choking when he heard that. Although the power of that punch earlier was nothing to him, it could actually call down the power of Great Dao!

This kind of terrifying and mysterious martial technique, he was unable to teach Ye Yuan at all.

He also understood what Ye Yuan meant: you could not even execute this punch, what right do you have to take me in as a disciple?

Logically speaking, Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses could use Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum martial techniques freely.

Even if he did not cultivate in it before, just by relying on his powerful understanding of Heavenly Dao, he could grasp it instantly too.

It was just a pity that Ye Yuan’s punch was not included in it!

This punch of Ye Yuan’s was just limited to his current realm and could not unleash its true power.

Once Ye Yuan broke through to Jade Sovereign Heaven, the power of this punch would become several levels stronger!

Such a profound punch, he could not teach!
