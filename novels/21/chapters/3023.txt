Chapter 3022: Counting the Time, They Should Be Reaching!

“Yang Qing, you didn’t lose unjustly! Brother Ye has already comprehended saint force!” Feng Xiaotian came up and explained.

Yang Qing’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise as he said, “Saint force! Isn’t that the power that only Great Beyond powerhouses can utilize? Even Hegemon Bufan can’t do it too! How can this guy do it!”

Feng Xiaotian did not answer. He waited for Ye Yuan to explain.

Ye Yuan did not hide it either, recounting the mutation from the four great true spirit bloodlines fusing, making everyone dumbfounded from listening.

This guy was also a little too amazing, right?

Disregarding other things, just one of the four great true spirit bloodline blood essences was not what the average person could obtain!

“You punk, there’s really no justice anymore!” Yang Qing said hatefully.

“Hehe,?I said it long ago, you’re not Big Brother Ye Yuan’s match, but you refused to believe! Now, you lifted up a rock to crush your own foot, right?” Jingfei said with a scoff.

Yang Qing snorted coldly and said, “So what? One day, I’ll trample him underfoot! I, Hegemon Azuresky, am invincible!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “You’ve indeed transformed a lot these few years! Just based on this spear, you’re not worse than Zhuo Bufan!”

Zhuo Bufan, who was also Heaven One Alliance Bufan, the Heaven One Alliance’s new leader, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s only Supreme Hegemon!

And this Zhuo Bufan was precisely the powerhouse who walked out of the Rainclear Continent back then!

Ye Yuan merely left for over a hundred years, but in these hundred years, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven underwent a complete transformation. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The blood race’s Wang Zuo broke through to Supreme Hegemon, breaking through the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Heaven One Divine Lord led Cloudmount and the rest of the Hegemons to fight to the death with the blood race, and eventually died.

Originally, Heaven One had already reached the end of the road.

Right at this time, Zhuo Bufan came soaring into existence, separating life and death paths with a sword, breaking through several realms in a row, directly crossing from origin realm to Supreme Hegemon!

At the critical moment, Zhuo Bufan arrived, fighting to the death with Wang Zuo, and inflicting heavy wounds on Wang Zuo with one sword. That was how it welcomed a respite for Heaven One.

Otherwise, even if Ye Yuan brought people back, what he would see would also be a Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven that was trampled flat.

Zhuo Bufan was originally the goal that Ye Yuan pursued. But after arriving at Heaven One, he had not heard about Zhuo Bufan, and he gradually forgot about him too.

Only when Ye Yuan returned this time did he hear that it turned out Zhuo Bufan had long gone out of the Absolute Heaven Barrier by himself with a sword.

As for how he survived in the territory of the blood race, nobody knew.

Everyone only knew that when the Absolute Heaven Barrier was breached, Zhuo Bufan returned alone with a sword again.

At that time, he was already a mighty expert of the origin realm, the number one person under Hegemon!

But, not reaching Hegemon, everything was empty talk.

The battle of a hundred Hegemon Realms, he was merely an ant!

Nobody expected that just as everyone thought that the Heaven One Alliance’s situation was beyond salvation, Zhuo Bufan broke through several realms consecutively in the midst of battle, directly reaching Supreme Hegemon, writing a legend that would be handed down for generations!

Originally, this generation’s men of the hour were Feng Xiaotian and Ye Yuan’ eldest senior apprentice brother, Li Clearcloud.

However, with Zhuo Bufan coming into being, he suppressed everyone’s light.

But nobody was unconvinced!

With the Divine Lord falling, Zhuo Bufan became Heaven One’s new leader.

Such a huge change, Ye Yuan also sighed endlessly when he heard it.

A hundred years in a haste, it was really, seas change into mulberry fields and mulberry fields into seas!

However, Ye Yuan was also curious before, why would Zhuo Bufan this kind of great prodigy, fade into the crowd?

Only now did he know that this guy was ultimately not ordinary!

However, Ye Yuan saw Zhuo Bufan’s shadow from Yang Qing’s spear!

That sort of domineeringness of who else could do it but me was absolutely not beneath Zhuo Bufan!

Being praised by Ye Yuan, Yang Qing rolled his eyes and said,?“Tch,?you mean that, Hegemon Bufan and I are inferior to you,?eh!?You’re really shameless! I, Hegemon Azuresky, won’t give up! No matter how long it takes, I’m going to trample you underfoot!”

Ye Yuan smiled and did not speak.

Yang Qing, this guy, really had the potential to become a powerhouse.

Ye Yuan knew that he had prepared a long time for this battle today.

If it were someone else, the blow from this fight would definitely be huge. But, he was not demoralized and was still full of fighting spirit.

While talking and laughing, a figure flew over from the horizon, falling heavily into West Sun City.

Feng Xiaotian’s pupils constricted, and he said, “It’s Hegemon Clearcloud! Not good! Something has indeed gone wrong at Hegemon Bufan there!”

Ye Yuan’s expression also changed wildly because he recognized that this person who fell into West Sun City was precisely his eldest senior brother, Li Clearcloud!

He should currently be with Master Cloudmount and Hegemon Bufan, holding back the blood race’s Hegemons.

But, this situation before his eyes, something must have happened over at Hegemon Bufan there!

A group of people hurried over and discovered that Li Clearcloud was already on his dying breath.

“Eldest Senior Brother!”

Li Clearcloud barely managed to open both eyes. Seeing that it was Ye Yuan, a hint of delight flashed across in his eyes!

“L-Little Junior Brother, it’s good that you’re back! Good that … you’re back!”

Feng Xiaotian said in a solemn voice, “Brother Clearcloud, what happened? Why are you injured until like this?”

Li Clearcloud’s breathing was weak as he said, “Hegemon … Bloodsky, broke through!”

Feng Xiaotian’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “What did you say? Hegemon Bloodsky he, broke through to Supreme Hegemon?”

Li Clearcloud nodded his head feebly and said, “He joined hands with Wang Zuo, Hegemon Bufan is … injured. Master … fought to the death to escort me out, to have me send a message and let you all … give up on Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

Everyone present trembled all over.

Li Clearcloud spoke intermittently, but they all understood.

The blood race gave birth to another Supreme Hegemon!

With two great Supreme Hegemons joining forces, the battle situation at the front line was not optimistic.

Hegemon Cloudmount they all had fallen into a great crisis.

Even Li Clearcloud also sustained such serious injuries. The danger of the battle situation could be seen!

Furthermore, the news that Li Clearcloud brought back was actually to evacuate Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

This showed that the Hegemons in front had already lost all hope!

Even Zhuo Bufan, this peerless powerhouse, was unable to overcome the raging tides too!

An aura of despair spread in everyone’s hearts.

After a long time, Feng Xiaotian heaved a sigh and said, “Brother Ye, let’s … go!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Zhao Yue, Brother Feng, let’s go! Go save Master!”

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue roared angrily and arrived next to Ye Yuan.

Feng Xiaotian nodded his head. But very soon, he reacted to it and said blankly, “What did you say?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was firm as he said, “I said, let’s go save Master Cloudmount and Zhuo Bufan!”

Feng Xiaotian smiled bitterly and said, “Ye Yuan, I understand your feelings. But there’s no hope! Two great Supreme Hegemons, we … have no hope at all!”

He really lost all hope!

A Supreme Hegemon, they could still resist.

But, two Supreme Hegemons. Furthermore, it was even Bloodsky, this spatial origin Hegemon, they really had no hope anymore.

It must be tragic to the extreme ahead. Otherwise, Hegemon Bufan would not have had Li Clearcloud come back to send the message.

Ye Yuan ignored Feng Xiaotian and said coolly, “Counting the time, they should be reaching!”

Feng Xiaotian was stupefied again and said, “Reaching? Who’s reaching? Ye Yuan, I really understand your feelings, but … it’s useless no matter who comes!”

Before his voice faded, there was a tremor in the void.

One unbelievably powerful aura after another emerged.
