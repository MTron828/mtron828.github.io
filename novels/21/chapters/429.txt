Xiao Ruyan received the jade slip hesitantly; her expression was rather vacant.

She agreed to acknowledge Ye Yuan as her master with ulterior motives, and it was not to really learn something.

She did not think that Ye Yuan really prepared a master acknowledgment gift for her.

"Take a look. Master prepared a set of soul cultivation incantation and two sets of refining arts for you. You have to study them well in the future," Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Xiao Ruyan sunk her divine sense into the jade slip as told and started to browse.

This scene looked extremely comical in everyone‚Äôs eyes.

Ye Yuan‚Äôs divine soul realm was more or less the same as Xiao Ruyan‚Äôs; both High-Rank Alchemy Grandmasters. Now, Ye Yuan wanted to take a girl whose strength was relative to his as his disciple. No matter how one looked at it, it was somewhat odd.

"What do you guys Ye Yuan is playing at here? Xiao Ruyan is one of the capital‚Äôs dual absolutes. Furthermore, you all look at that concerned look of Xiao Ruyan‚Äôs when Ji Qing was injured just now. Clearly in love with him. He actually . . . only took her in to be a disciple?"

"Aggravating me to death! Xiao Ruyan is my goddess! Ji Qing is already the capital‚Äôs number one now, and he actually dares to trample on my goddess‚Äôs dignity! I . . . I want to duel him!"

"Screw off you! With that strength of yours, it isn‚Äôt even enough to fill the gaps between his teeth! Still want to duel! However . . . Ji Qing‚Äôs action is really unimaginably weird. He himself is just a high-rank Alchemy Grandmaster. How is he going to teach disciples?"

"In my opinion, this Ji Qing thinks too highly of himself! Even though he‚Äôs Sovereign Star Abyss‚Äôs disciple, to talk about giving pointers in alchemy to the Alchemy Grandmaster Xiao Ruyan who is his peer, he probably isn‚Äôt qualified enough yet, right? I‚Äôm very curious though, about what are the things inside his jade slip."

"Heh heh, what can there be? Simply his own cultivation methods and refining methods. Just that these things, his comprehension is already slightly stronger than Xiao Ruyan, right?"

Master teaching disciples was not a simple imparting of cultivation methods. It was more so to clarify doubts for disciples and give pointers to various problems encountered during the process of cultivation.

Especially alchemy skills. It was deep and profound; hard to learn and hard to be proficient.

Everybody knew that Ye Yuan‚Äôs was amazing at alchemy. But regardless of how incredible he was, he was only an Alchemy Grandmaster. Regarding higher realm things, how much could he comprehend?

Imparting soul cultivation methods and refining methods a little and being someone‚Äôs master was truly a bit too child‚Äôs play.

And currently, Xiao Ruyan‚Äôs brows were slightly furrowed, and her expression gradually becoming solemn.

"Ji . . . Ji . . ." Xiao Ruyan was clearly not yet used to called Ye Yuan master.

"Call Master!" Ye Yuan said coolly.

Xiao Ruyan sucked in a deep breath and called out, "Master, this . . . Master‚Äôs acknowledgment gift is too precious! I . . ."

"Haha. You‚Äôre my disciple. Giving pointers in your cultivation is within Master‚Äôs duty, what precious? From today onwards, you‚Äôll cultivate the soul cultivation method on the jade slip. But you must promise master that this method absolutely mustn‚Äôt be divulged! Only you alone can cultivate it! Otherwise . . . even its flouting teachings, Master . . . will clean the household!" Talking until the back, Ye Yuan‚Äôs voice became extremely stern.

Actually, what Ye Yuan gave Xiao Ruyan was the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation as well as the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique and the Tri-Origins Samsara Art cultivation skills.

But what he gave Xiao Ruyan was only the first five levels of the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation; enough for her to cultivate to Peak Alchemy Sovereign!

Moreover, in the jade slip were extremely detailed annotations about the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantations and the two types of skills. They were all Ye Yuan‚Äôs notes of his understanding.

With these things, no matter how poor one‚Äôs talent was, cultivating to Alchemy King Ream was not an issue at all.

With Xiao Ruyan‚Äôs talent, cultivating to Peak Alchemy Sovereign was only a matter of time.

In truth, this introduction gift, Ye Yuan considered it carefully too.

Just talking about talent, while Xiao Ruyan was not considered at the zenith, she was already pretty decent.

Xiao Ruyan‚Äôs intentions, Ye Yuan was naturally very clear. Furthermore, through this period of living together, Ye Yuan could also trust Xiao Ruyan‚Äôs character.

Since that was the case, why not he be a bit more generous and pass down his mantle?

Killing Ji Canglan was a near certain death mission. Even Ye Yuan did not dare guarantee that he could succeed for sure either.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan was about to leave the Fierce Gale World right away. Towards this eldest disciple of his, he could not be shabby no matter what.

Hence, he passed these three things to Xiao Ruyan.

Presumably, with these things, Xiao Ruyan ascending to the Divine Realm in the future would not pose a problem.

Hearing Ye Yuan‚Äôs warning, Xiao Ruyan‚Äôs expression changed too and knew how great the weight of this jade slip in her hand was.

Xiao Ruyan was an expert too. Sweeping the contents of the jade slip over, she knew the value of this jade slip.

She acknowledged him as her master was to get close to Ye Yuan, but Ye Yuan really took her to be his legacy successor.

After musing, Xiao Ruyan nodded solemnly and said, "R-Rest assured, Master. Disciple will engrave the contents inside the jade slip into my divine soul to slowly understand and absolutely won‚Äôt reveal it to a third person to know!"

Ye Yuan nodded and said, "Okay, this matter is done. Master‚Äôs injuries aren‚Äôt light and still need to head back and recuperate a bout. You follow me back to Qixia Mountain then."

Xiao Ruyan nodded slightly and actually really supported Ye Yuan like a disciple and left.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly at Shi Haoran. The party was just about to leave when all of a sudden, a dozen over figures descended from the skies and blocked their path.

The one in front was an old man with age much alike Star Abyss‚Äôs.

And looking from the aura coming off of this person‚Äôs body, he was actually a Divine Traversing Realm martial artist!

"Ding Liang! What are you here for?" When Shi Haoran saw the arrival, his brows involuntarily knitted.

The old man called Ding Liang did not pay attention to Shi Haoran and said indifferently, "The Dark Shadow Guards are handling affairs. Unrelated personnel quickly leave! Otherwise, kill without amnesty!"

Ding Liang‚Äôs voice was not loud, but it spread out like a large bell. Every single person in the plaza heard it loud and clear!

"Dark Shadow Guards! It‚Äôs actually the most mysterious Dark Shadow Guards under the Wind Emperor‚Äôs command!"

"I-Is this the power of a sovereign level powerhouse? S-So powerful!"

"What are you still standing there for? If you don‚Äôt want to die, quickly go! I heard that the Dark Shadow Guards have extremely high autonomy when handling matters and can execute on the spot before reporting! If we don‚Äôt leave, we‚Äôll die a pointless death!"

There were tens of thousands of people in the plaza. But currently, they retreated like tidewater.

Very soon, in the vast plaza, only Ye Yuan‚Äôs group and Ding Liang‚Äôs group were left!

"Ding Liang, what the hell are you doing?" Shi Haoran asked again unhappily.

Although he was a full major realm lower than Ding Liang, in terms of status, he was not inferior to Ding Liang. Hence, he dared to directly call his name.

Shi Haoran was the number one person under Star Abyss. Other than needing to give a disciple‚Äôs bow when facing the Wind Emperor, he could directly disregard other people. DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

Ding Liang still did not answer. He took a look at the unconscious Zhao Chenggan not far away and his brows involuntarily furrowed. He asked Ye Yuan, "His Highness, the Seventh Prince, was defeated by you?"

Not knowing why, since the beginning earlier, Ye Yuan‚Äôs eyelids kept twitching constantly and had an uneasy feeling.

He had a feeling that this Ding Liang did not come with good intentions.

Seeing Ding Liang pose a question, Ye Yuan said, "So what if yes? Can it be that you want to take revenge for him?"

"Haha, taking revenge naturally won‚Äôt reach this old man‚Äôs turn! Ye Yuan, take a trip with me!" Ding Liang said with a light laugh.
