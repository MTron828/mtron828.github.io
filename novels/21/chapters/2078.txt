Chapter 2082: Apologize to Me

“Young Master!”

The moment she entered the medicine refining room in the back-hall, Lu-er could not hold back anymore and dove right into Ye Yuan’s embrace. She then started sobbing loudly.

Ye Yuan consoled carefully, his heart also filled with a thousand regrets.

To other martial artists, a thousand years was very short.

But to Ye Yuan and Lu-er, a thousand years was far too long!

Ye Yuan walking all the way from the State of Qin, the one who accompanied him the longest was Lu-er.

The two of them were known as master and servant, but actually, even Ye Yuan himself also could not tell the two of their feelings anymore.

A thousand years was seemingly as long as seas changing into mulberry fields and mulberry fields into seas to them.

“Alright, don’t cry, don’t cry. Young Master came to fetch you home!” Ye Yuan patted Lu-er’s back lightly and said akin to being relieved of a heavy burden.

Ever since Li-er and the rest left Heavenly Eagle, Ye Yuan was very worried every day.

Later, compared to the situation of White Light and Li-er, the one that he worried about most was naturally Lu-er.

But Lu-er did not have any news all along, Ye Yuan was also greatly anxious in his heart.

The suffering involved, only he himself was aware.

“Sniff, sniff ... Young Master, I even thought ... thought ...”

“Huhu, did you think that that Senior Apprentice Sister Xun of yours came to capture me, bully me?” Ye Yuan said with a laugh. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Lu-er nodded her head. These few years, she lost all desire for food and drink. What she was most worried about was this.

“Miss Lu-er, rest assured. His Excellency has a high prestige now. He defeated the Southern Border with his power alone, and he is presently the Southern Border’s number one alchemy god! Also, the present Heavenly Eagle is also the Southern Border’s number one alchemy holy land. Even Empyrean Realm powerhouses have to respectfully call Grandmaster Ye when they see His Excellency! Those few senior apprentice sisters of yours didn’t even figure out the situation and ran over to capture His Excellency, simply not knowing life from death.” Ning Tianping said with a cold smile on his face.

When Lu-er heard, it felt like she was listening to a book from heaven; her brain not quite enough to use.

Southern Border’s number one alchemy god and Southern Border’s number one alchemy holy land!

The present Lu-er naturally knew how vast a land the Southern Border was.

Ye Yuan actually became a figure that could command the wind and rain like so in the entire Southern Border.

“Turns out that Young Master is already this formidable?” Lu-er was shocked and also happy.

The more impressive her young master was, the happier she naturally would be.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No matter how impressive, I’m also your young master!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed. His expression turned cold, and he said, “You have injuries all over your body. Someone should have used a lightning-attribute array formation to hurt you, right? If I didn’t guess wrongly, it’s that Eldest Senior Sister of yours, He Xiangyun, right?”

Lu-er said in surprise, “Young Master, you ... you already knew?”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “That Senior Apprentice Sister Xun of yours was stupid and was already soul-searched by me! If this was not the case, why would I set up such a grand scheme and make Empyrean Ice Cloud send you over obediently?”

When Lu-er heard this, she could not help feeling pain in her heart.

Ye Yuan knew Lu-er’s personality and said with a sigh, “Oh, you, it’s been so many years, you’re also a grown girl already, to actually not have changed at all. He Xiangyun and Xun Mengyao abused you like so, but why you actually still want to plead on their behalf?”

When Lu-er heard that, she could not help saying with a wronged face: “They ... They are my senior apprentice sisters after all.”

Ye Yuan let out a slight sigh and changed the topic. He said, “Alright, don’t talk anymore. Young Master will help you treat your wounds first!”

Inspecting for Lu-er, only then did Ye Yuan know how severe the injuries on Lu-er’s body were.

How brilliant were Ye Yuan’s medical skills? Inspecting slightly, he knew that some of the wounds on Lu-er’s body already lasted for several decades.

There were even some old injuries that had been buried in the body for several hundred years!

The more he examined, the greater the fury in Ye Yuan’s heart.

He already secretly made up his mind that this He Xiangyun must be eliminated.

Of course, he would not tell Lu-er.

... ...

Just not long after Ye Yuan and Lu-er entered the medicine refining room, a matter that shook the Jiu Luo Ji happened.

Vast Wind Assemble’s Empyrean Vast Wind’s son, Feng Tianyang, exited seclusion. Empyrean Vast Wind’s brother, Empyrean Windlike brought Feng Tianyang and as a large contingent of troops and came to Jiu Luo Ji to get married.

And the target of marriage was a disciple of Ice Cloud Tower.

This matter caused a great sensation in the entire assemble.

Ice Cloud Tower that was originally a relatively weak power in Jiu Luo Ji became a highly popular faction all of a sudden.

Vast Wind Assemble was one of the strongest forces in the Northernmost Steppe. Empyrean Vast Wind was even a Fifth Firmament Empyrean super powerhouse, his status incomparably venerated.

Different from Jiu Luo Ji, everyone going their own way, Vast Wind Assemble was ruled by Empyrean Vast Wind alone.

There were as many as over a dozen Empyrean powerhouses under his command.

And Feng Tianyang was even known as the Northernmost Steppe’s number one genius, and already a Ninth Firmament True God mighty expert.

Just a step away and he could enter the realm of Empyrean!

Even Empyrean Ice Cloud also did not expect that Vast Wind Assemble would regard it with such importance, to actually sent Empyrean Windlike here.

At this time, all of Ice Cloud Tower’s disciples all came out to welcome Empyrean Windlike’s party.

The other eight great Empyreans were also all present.

“Huhu, not seeing for many years, Younger Sister Ice Cloud is more and more beautiful!” Empyrean Windlike said with a laugh.

Empyrean Ice Cloud smiled and said, “Brother Windlike is making fun of Ice Cloud. Ice Cloud is already a faded beauty. So how am I beautiful?”

Empyrean Windlike could not help laughing as he said, “What years is there to speak of for cultivators of our generation? Younger Sister Ice Cloud is too modest.”

At this time, another old man stepped forward to greet her. The moment Ice Cloud looked, who was it if not Empyrean Xiao Yu?

Empyrean Ice Cloud hurriedly returned the courtesy. She did not expect that Empyrean Xiao Yu actually came together too.

Everyone present was extremely surprised.

Vast Wind Assemble was attaching too much importance to this marriage, right? To actually have two Empyreans come at once.

After all, Feng Tianyang had a lawfully wedded wife. Marrying Lu-er was merely as a concubine.

Those who were not aware of the details all knew that Empyrean Xiao Yu probably had an ulterior motive, and it was with that Master Ji.

Especially Empyrean Loneswan, it was something that he already knew.

This Empyrean Xiao Yu was actually very envious of him entering Ye Yuan’s tutelage.

“Feng Tianyang pays respect to Senior Ice Cloud and various seniors.”

At this time, a mighty youth flashed out from behind Empyrean Windlike and bowed to Empyrean Ice Cloud.

But his appearance was not as a junior bowing respectfully to a senior, but as peers talking on equal footing.

Empyrean Ice Cloud did not mind either, saying with a smile, “Huhu, not seeing for some time, Honorable Nephew Feng’s cultivation grows with each passing day!”

Empyrean Ice Cloud was also very surprised in her heart. The last time she saw Feng Tianyang was still a hundred years ago.

At that time, Feng Tianyang was merely a middle-stage Ninth Firmament True God. Now that a hundred years passed, Feng Tianyang’s strength already approached grand completion. He was only a step away from becoming an Empyrean.

At this rate, in less than 2000 years, this boy would likely be stepping into the realm of Empyrean.

Feng Tianyang just smiled faintly, paying no attention to this kind of compliment.

It was just that his gaze swept, but his brows knitted together and he said in a solemn voice, “Senior Ice Cloud Tower, your Ice Cloud Tower’s disciples are all here. Why is only Lu-er missing?”

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s face changed and she hurriedly gave a few words of explanation.

Who knew that Feng Tianyang gave a cold snort and said, “Senior Ice Cloud, your way of doing things is also too preposterous! Loneswan is my unwed-wife, you actually had her stay in the same room with another man! Empyrean Loneswan, that Ji Qingyun is your Grand Pill Establishment’s people. You order them to bring Ji Qingyun over right now and apologize to me! Just say that I, Feng Tianyang, said it!”
