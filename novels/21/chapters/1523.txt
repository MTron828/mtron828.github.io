Chapter 1527 Instantly Understand

Even if trampling others, people should not be trampled like this!

This was trampling completely, and then still driving a roller to crush a few more times!

Zheng Jian felt that his world view was collapsing.

When did the Selfless Realm become a cabbage, easily found?

Back then, in order to master the Understanding Strike, he had narrowly escaped death no idea how many times, but never entered the state of Selfless State once before.

But he entered three times!

Three times!

Selfless Realm, entering once was a massive jackpot.

This guy actually entered three times!

Furthermore, it seemed like there was a trend of becoming smoother and smoother!

This ... Was this still humanly possible?

Zheng Jian felt that he was simply a joke.

That joke that transmigrated through time and space!

Genius?

In front of this guy before his eyes, the word ‘genius’ was so laughable!

After a long time, Zheng Jian suddenly changed his face and was no longer arrogant and no longer considered everyone and everybody beneath his notice, just like a wise man who had seen through worldly affairs.

“Looks like I indeed had a limited outlook! Your talent is unprecedented since time immemorial! I’m already submerged in the long river of history, while you’re destined to give off brilliance! Go on!”

At this moment, Zhang Jian actually smiled.

That ten-thousand-year-old corpse face actually revealed a smile.

That was a smile of relief. He seemed to have understood something.

Then, his figure gradually dissipated and turned into nothingness.

Ye Yuan’s eyes blurred and he arrived in the hall once more.

The current hall already switched scenes. Those arenas had all disappeared, appearing much more empty.

“Congratulations on your success in challenging the Purple Extreme Sect’s 18 geniuses, becoming the Purple Extreme Sect’s successor! Your reward ... is this hall!” The old voice sounded out once more, making Ye Yuan very surprised.

Wasn’t it said that every six rounds had a reward? Why did it become this hall?

Ye Yuan had a strange look as he said, “This hall, I can’t move it away too, want it for what?”

“Who said that the hall can’t be moved? This hall itself is a spatial flying-type true god mystic treasure. It can be big or small. When big, it can become a magnificent palace. When small, it can become a grain of dust. It can even travel as far as hundreds of millions of miles in a day. Of course, the prerequisite is that you need to have sufficient divine essence stones!” a thin and bony old man’s phantom appeared and said.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said in surprise, “So incredible?”

The old man snorted coldly and said, “More than incredible. Back then, my Purple Extreme Sect devoted the entire sect’s power to forge this true god mystic treasure, wanting to immortalize our legacy. There are extremely powerful killing arrays inside this hall. As long as you have sufficient divine essence stones, even eradicating true gods can be done!”

It sounded ... very impressive!

Eradicating true gods, thinking about it made people excited.

“Tsk tsk, I seem to have picked up a treasure” Ye Yuan said rather excitedly.

The old man said, “I’m running out of time. Now, I’ll impart you the Purple Extreme Sect’s supreme cultivation method. You have to cultivate well and bring my Purple Extreme Sect to greater heights!”

Ye Yuan froze for a moment and said, “Cultivation method? No need. My cultivation method is pretty good, I don’t plan on changing cultivation methods.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Got to be joking, supreme cultivation method?

In front of the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, it was nothing!

When the old man heard that, he said in sullen anger, “You obtained my Purple Extreme Sect’s inheritance, you must cultivate the Purple Extreme Sect’s supreme cultivation method. Otherwise, I’ll blot you out!”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned cold. This old man was also too unreasonable, right?

After a pause, the old man continued, “Furthermore, cultivating the Purple Extreme Heart Sutra is also saving yourself! There are three fiend lord powerhouses standing guard outside. If you don’t cultivate the Purple Extreme Heart Sutra, you won’t be able to refine the Purple Extreme Hall. When this old man dies, the Purple Extreme Hall’s array formation will dissipate and they will rush in!”

Hearing this, Ye Yuan’s heart turned cold and he immediately changed expressions and said, “Then still waiting for what? Come on!”

The old man smiled slightly and took his time to say: “The Purple Extreme Heart Sutra is divided into a total of six levels. It can help you cultivate all the way to True God ninth-layered heaven, even the realm of half-step Heavenly Empyrean; the pinnacle-most existence among grade-six Divine Dao cultivation methods! As long as you cultivate this cultivation method’s first level, you’ll be able to refine the spirit source crystal soul. Except, the speed will be very slow. As long as you refine a part of it, you can control the grand array and stop those fiend lords from entering!”

While talking, a milky-white crystal appeared in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan said, “Which is to say that the higher level I cultivate the Purple Extreme Heart Sutra, the faster the speed of refining the spirit source crystal soul, right?”

The old man said, “Yes. But the Purple Extreme Heart Sutra is extensive and profound, within a short time ...”

The old man had not finished talking and was cut off by Ye Yuan: “Then still waiting for what? Bring out the first three levels for me!”

The old man choked and said, “Young man, don’t bite off more than you can chew. Your foundation needs to be solid, otherwise ...”

Ye Yuan said speechlessly, “I say, Senior, did you say that time is limited? Can you hurry up or not?”

The old man choked again. But this time, he still brought out the Purple Extreme Heart Sutra. However ... just the first level cultivation method.

Countless divine inscriptions appeared in front of Ye Yuan, making people blurry-eyed.

However, Ye Yuan just swept a glance and said coolly, “Where’s the second level cultivation method?”

The old man still took his time to say: “Young man, you only browsed over it once and want to cultivate the second level cultivation method? Better not to reach beyond your grasp!”

I ... why did this old man have so much bullshit?

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him and started revolving according to the Purple Extreme Heart Sutra’s method.

Purple light radiated on Ye Yuan’s body, dazzling to the extreme. It was precisely the hallmark of grand completion first level cultivation method.

“Y-Y-You ... are already at grand completion? Could it be ... that you cultivated the Purple Extreme Heart Sutra in the past before? This ... This isn’t possible!”

The thin old man had been taking his time all along, neither too fast nor too slow. But this time, he was visibly moved and even started stammering when speaking.

How powerful this Purple Extreme Heart Sutra was, the thin old man was all too clear.

Even immensely talented genius disciples had to expend a hundred years back then before they could master the first level too.

Ye Yuan was an Origin Deity expert. Cultivating another cultivation method naturally yielded twice the results with half the effort. Even so, he at least had to spend two to three year’s time before he could master the first level too!

However, he instantly understood!

Ye Yuan was speechless as he said, “I say, Senior, time is urgent, can we stop wasting time? Quick, bring out the two levels of cultivation method at the back and let me take a look.”

Although Ye Yuan had the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, he could only cultivate the first three levels right now too.

As for the back, his realm was not there yet and naturally could not understand it too.

With this, the old man finally released the entirety of the two levels of cultivation method at the back.

After Ye Yuan swept a glance, he directly came before the spirit source crystal soul and started refining.

Watching Ye Yuan refine the spirit source crystal soul with the third level Purple Extreme Heart Sutra, the thin old man was full of shock.

This ... Just what kind of situation was this?

Seen before photographic memory with one glance, but never seen before success with a glance!

With just a glance, he mastered the extensive and profound Purple Extreme Heart Sutra, was this guy a monster?

How in the world did he do it?

“Hahaha, truly, heaven doesn’t want my Purple Extreme Sect to perish! Didn’t expect that after countless years, it actually let my Purple Extreme Sect find such a heaven-defying successor!” said the old man with a big laugh, as his turbid eyes suddenly became bright.
