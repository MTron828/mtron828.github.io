Chapter 1852: Almost Made a Huge Blunder

Everyone was stunned on the spot!

The Leng Family’s peerless genius, Thousand Soar Mansion’s disciple, Leng Qiuling, actually sung a different tune with her own father?

This reversal was also too dramatic.

“Qiuling, what did you say?” Leng Hongxiu was also taken aback and asked.

He knew that this daughter was the most filial and would never go against his will.

What was going on today?

Leng Qiuling said calmly, “The right and wrong, everyone has a scale in their hearts. Big Brother Leng Hao’s actions and conduct indeed isn’t worthy of the title of young patriarch. Father, I suggest better to let Big Brother Leng Xu continue to be the young patriarch.”

Another death-like silence!

No one would have expected that Leng Qiuling actually said such words in front of everyone.

Even Leng Xu also had an astounded face.

Leng Qiuling entered Thousand Soar Mansion very early and had very little interaction with him. Their relationship was also not considered close. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Why did she suddenly speak up for him?

Rather, it was Leng Hao. When he heard Leng Qiuling’s words, it was akin to a bolt out of the blue.

Even in his dreams, he never dared to believe that Leng Qiuling would actually say such things at this time!

In his view, the one least likely to oppose him were Leng Hongxiu father and daughter.

But Leng Qiuling actually gave him a fatal blow at this time!

Even though Leng Qiuling was the same as him, just a junior of the Leng Family, her status was completely different.

She was not just the Leng Family’s proud daughter of heaven. She was also the entire Thousand Soar Imperial Capital’s proud daughter of heaven.

Leng Qiuling normally would not care about the Leng Family’s affairs at all. Her horizons had long already transcended the Leng Family’s level.

But today, she actually spoke up!

Leng Qiuling’s words were absolutely heavyweight-class. It was even more useful than all of the elders’ words put together!

Leng Hongxiu’s brows knitted together. Recalling his daughter’s reaction previously, he immediately understood in his heart.

This Ye Yuan was likely that Ye Yuan!

Except, could it be that this kid called Ye Yuan really had a powerful background?

Otherwise, why would his daughter refute his face in front of so many people?

“Since Ling-er already said so, then ...” Leng Hongxiu finally still heeded his daughter’s words and planned to announce the final result.

Leng Hao’s face was akin to dead ash. His many years of hard work were actually no match for Leng Qiuling’s one sentence!

He hated it!

“Hang on!” But at this moment, Leng Xu suddenly interrupted his words.

Leng Hongxiu’s brows furrowed, but he heard Leng Xu say solemnly: “Big Brother Leng Hao, I’ve told you before, this position of young patriarch, I don’t care about it! What I value more is familial relationship and friendship! It’s just a shame that the big brother that was akin to a father and brother in my eyes back in the old days already slowly drifted further apart. I didn’t come today to fight with you over this position of young patriarch too. I just want to tell everyone that I, Leng Xu, have never thought about continuing to be this young patriarch either. From this day forth, I, Leng Xu, resign from the position of the Leng Family’s young patriarch!”

This sudden turn of events made everyone stunned.

When everyone all thought that the outcome of this struggle for young patriarch was already a foregone conclusion because of a sentence from Leng Qiuling, Leng Xu himself actually came forward and wanted to resign from the position of young patriarch.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene and secretly smiled as he nodded.

He understood that those able to do it like Leng Xu were not many.

One had to know, being a young patriarch meant more cultivation resources and advantages. This point, no one was clearly than Leng Xu about it.

But, he put it down straight away, without dragging anything out.

Actually, in Ye Yuan’s view, although cultivation resources were important, the path was carved out by oneself. However much the cultivation resources, it was also not as important as walking one’s path.

One’s own might was true might!

Except, very few people could understand this.

Leng Qiuling’s eyes also glinted, clearly very surprised by Leng Xu’s action.

Her horizons had transcended the scope of the Leng Family long ago.

The reason why she said so was entirely looking on account of Ye Yuan’s face.

She did not expect that Leng Xu did not care about this position of young patriarch at all.

Suddenly, Leng Qiuling felt that it was rather funny. It was really birds of a feather flock together.

If it were Ye Yuan, he would also do so, right?

Even though she did not have much contact with Ye Yuan, she could tell that Ye Yuan was similarly stubborn and unruly, someone unrestrained and carefree.

No secular concept could constrain such a person.

After falling silent for a moment, Leng Hongxiu nodded and said, “Forget it, all disperse. The position of young patriarch will be discussed another day!”

With the family head giving a verbal instruction, everyone dispersed, leaving behind only Leng Hao alone, his gaze glassy.

Leng Xu’s final words sent his entire person into a daze.

It turned out that an extremely simple thing was made complicated by him.

It turned out that this position of young patriarch could be won with extreme ease. But now, it turned into nothing.

It turned out that Leng Xu really did not care about the position of young patriarch!

It turned out that all of his efforts were just a superfluous joke!

...

“Does Father want to ask why I stopped you from dealing with Ye Yuan?” Leng Qiuling saw through her father’s unhappiness and took the initiative to start the conversation.

Leng Hongxiu was at any rate the head of a family. With his daughter embarrassing him in front of everyone, his face had nowhere to put!

But toward Leng Qiuling, Leng Hongxiu was clearly very tolerating. He had a black face as he said, “This Ye Yuan is that Ye Yuan you know?”

Leng Qiuling nodded her head.

“Just what origin does this boy have? You just had to come forward at this time!”

Leng Qiuling briefly recounted what she saw and heard back then on the Heavenspan Mountain, making the expression on Leng Hongxiu’s face gradually change.

“Your meaning is that ... this boy might be a genius under a Heavenly Emperor’s command?” Leng Hongxiu said in surprise.

Leng Qiuling shook her head and said, “I’m also not sure, but that old drunkard’s strength, Father, you, should have heard of it, right? He actually stood up for a young man who didn’t even reach the Divine Lord Realm. Isn’t this suspicious? Furthermore, the mysteries on Ye Yuan’s body are too many, numerous until it makes people unable to see through. Such a person, we at least can’t provoke him!”

The more Leng Hongxiu listened, the more frightened he got. To be able to make his daughter have such a high appraisal, this young man was clearly not ordinary.

In truth, how could a genius capable of comprehending spatial shift be ordinary?

The more he thought, the more lingering Leng Hongxiu felt. If Ye Yuan really came from a Heavenly Emperor, or even a Dao Ancestor faction, then the consequences of touching him would be too severe!

“This ... Why didn’t you say earlier?! Father nearly made a huge blunder!” Leng Hongxiu said.

Leng Qiuling said, “I wasn’t aware of it beforehand too. In truth, I completely didn’t expect that in a short few centuries’ time, Ye Yuan’s strength could actually reach such a level! You have to know, back then when I met him on the Heavenspan Mountain, he didn’t even reach Divine Lord Realm!”

Back then, when Leng Qiuling encountered Ye Yuan, Ye Yuan was only at the boundary of grand completion Origin Deity.

With Leng Qiuling’s cultivation speed, ordinary people would only get pulled further and further apart from her.

But Ye Yuan actually narrowed the gap until it was just a tiny bit within a short few hundred years.

Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity versus Second Firmament Celestial Deity, it might be insurmountable to ordinary people for life.

But placed on Ye Yuan, it was clearly not very applicable.

One had to know, Ye Yuan kicked the Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity Leng Hao flying with one foot on the stage!
