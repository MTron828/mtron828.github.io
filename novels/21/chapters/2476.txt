Chapter 2482: Conjecture!

“What’s the Heavenspan Token?” Ye Yuan asked with a curious face.

The appearance of the Heavenspan Token made the entire Heavenspan World seethe with excitement again.

Currently, the outside world was already in chaos.

Each Deva Realm powerhouse was mobilizing the Heavenly Emperors and Empyreans under them to go out and search for the Heavenspan Tokens, stirring up a sanguinary slaughter.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said, “Heavenspan Token is the key to enter the Heavenspan Mountain during Heavenly Dao Samsara! Only with it can one have the qualification to contest for the qualifications of a Dao Ancestor, and then dominate the next samsara!”

When Ye Yuan heard, he came to a realization!

After the war, he attempted to enter the Heavenspan Mountain.

But upon reaching the borders of the Heavenspan Mountain, he was pushed away by a powerful force.

Even a powerhouse like him was unable to resist it.

This was heaven’s might, mortals could not resist it!

“Presumably, those few are already raring to move out, right?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Those few that he spoke of were naturally referring to the nine great Dao Ancestors.

The nine of them had been in control of the Heavenspan World for an epoch, how could they be willing to submit to others?

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled and said, “That’s of course! In reality, they have already prepared for a very long time! Right now, the nest has long already been cast, right? With their ten billion years of management, obtaining a Heavenspan Token is naturally nothing difficult. But this time, if they want to obtain the position of Dao Ancestor again, it would likely not be so easy anymore. Furthermore, attaining the position of Dao Ancestor also doesn’t rely on just strength only. Luck is very important too.”

The last Heavenly Dao Samsara, the divine race’s progenitors were already beaten down by the 18 grand ancestors until they did not have the strength to fight back, that was how they had the opportunity to take advantage of.

This time, the divine race’s progenitors have all returned, they would naturally join in the fight for Dao Ancestor qualifications.

It would naturally be doubly difficult for the few of them to want to become Dao Ancestors again.

“Oh??Why do you say that?” Ye Yuan asked out of curiosity.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said, “The Heavenspan Mountain’s area is extremely vast. Where the rule crystal appears, nobody knows either. Furthermore, even if you obtain it, you might not be able to become a Dao Ancestor either! Back then, Dao Ancestor Light was the weakest among them, being only Deva Second Blight. But the powerhouses competing for the rule crystals all died out in the end. But he slipped through and became Dao Ancestor Light. Therefore, he’s also the weakest one among Dao Ancestors.”

Ye Yuan could not help being secretly tongue-tied when he heard it.

A Deva Second Blight actually obtained a rule crystal. This luck was insane.

But this time, the divine race would also join in the contending army.

Furthermore, the Dao Ancestors who retired this time, each of them was shockingly powerful.

The competition would surely be even fiercer.

Although luck was very important, strength was more important.

With so many Grand Ancestor-level powerhouses joining in, it was obvious that the weaker ones had even small chances.

“Ye Yuan, during this Heavenly Dao Samsara, you must win and return with the position of Dao Ancestor! Only by becoming a Dao Ancestor can you suppress the divine race, and make them not dare to behave wildly! Of course, those few guys, we’ll avenge grievances if there are any, and take revenge if there are grudges!”

The shamelessness of the few Dao Ancestors also disgusted him badly.

He was filled with displeasure towards those few.

“Dao Ancestor??Huhu,?I’m definitely going to the Heavenspan Mountain. It’s just that this status of Dao Ancestor … I don’t have any interest in it.” Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a laugh.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s expression changed and he said, “Ye Yuan, this isn’t the time to decline out of modesty! With your strength, coupled with a rule crystal, you’ll absolutely become the number one Dao Ancestor! Without you, the human race wouldn’t be able to suppress the divine race too. Just based on the few of them, they aren’t qualified enough at all! On the divine race’s side, once they become Dao Ancestors, their strength will become unimaginably strong!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “I have my own path. I don’t need the enhancement of rule crystals! Furthermore, don’t you feel that this Heavenspan World … is like a giant cage, imprisoning everyone here?”

Talking up to here, Ye Yuan lifted his head to look at the sky, his gaze revealing a complicated look.

At present, Ye Yuan was practically already standing at the very summit of the Heavenspan World.

The scenery before his eyes was already completely different.

Lin Chaotian they all would lament about what was above the Heavenspan Mountain.

Then how could Ye Yuan not be filled with vicissitudes of emotion?

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s entire body trembled, his eyes revealing a look of astonishment.

Could it be that the thing Lin Chaotian they all worried about would actually come true?

Ye Yuan would break the shackles and become an existence above Dao Ancestors?

But how was this possible?

There had never been such a record in the Heavenspan World; let alone such a legend. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Even Tian Qing back then was also unable to break the shackles with the augmentation of the rule crystal!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s words earlier were earth-shattering. He actually said that the Heavenspan World was a giant cage!

“What do your words mean?” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets felt that his breathing became somewhat ragged.

Ye Yuan was filled with vicissitudes of emotion as he said, “You know, I avenge grievances if there are any, and take revenge if there are grudges. I and the divine race shouldn’t be able to coexist under the same sky. Then why did I take the initiative to let them enter the Heavenspan World?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was taken aback and said, “Yeah, I was very curious too. This isn’t your style!”

The enmity between Ye Yuan and the divine race could be said to have stretched for ten billion years.

If he really thought of it, the 18 grand ancestors were all his disciples.

These 18 people, all had fallen.

Let alone that the divine race forcibly abducted Yue Mengli, making the pair of them lovers unable to accept each other despite meeting.

With Ye Yuan’s personality, he should have suppressed the divine race firmly in the Abyss World.

But he did not.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “I made a trip to the divine race this time. Only then did I discover that they are also a bunch of pitiful people! Maybe the things that they did were all against their own will!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s pupils constricted and he said, “You … What on earth did you discover?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I haven’t got a clue right now yet. But I have a feeling that everything in the Heavenspan World seems to have been manipulated! Dao Ancestors, divine race, human race, everyone and everything, all seems like it’s being manipulated by an entity in secret. And we’re living, fighting, falling into samsara over and over again according to this rule.”

A raging storm was stirred up in Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s heart.

Ye Yuan’s words really subverted his understanding of this world.

All along, his life’s creed was to guard the Heavenspan World and not let the divine race re-enslave the human race.

But Ye Yuan’s words made him think deeply!

Who was overlooking the world? Who was deciding their fate?

They were merely a bunch of piglets reared in pens?

“B-But who’s controlling all these?” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said rather flusteredly.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know, but I feel that it should be related to the divine race’s totem statues! Maybe the day when I break the statues, there will be an answer! But, no matter who’s controlling us, we’re too insignificant in front of him! Therefore, I need even greater power!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets muttered, “Even greater power, could it be that … Dao Ancestor isn’t enough yet?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “A strength capable of controlling the Heavenspan World, can you imagine how powerful it is?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s complexion turned deathly pale, and he said, “This … Does this mystery really need to be uncovered?”
