Chapter 2595: Borrowing a Chicken to Lay Eggs

“Halt!”

Ye Yuan was stopped by Han Qianyun as soon as he arrived at Flowing Cloud Peak.

The Land of Exile was an independent space. The five great heavenly sects all had transmission arrays that led there.

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s transmission array was on Flowing Cloud Peak.

Seeing Han Qianyun, Ye Yuan said with a frown, “I want to enter the Land of Exile!”

Han Qianyun said with a cold smile, “Sorry, Elder Ye! The Land of Exile is under the jurisdiction of my master. Without Master’s orders, nobody can enter the Land of Exile!”

Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and said, “You dare stop me?”

Han Qianyun said coolly, “So what if I stop you? It’s also not that you can’t enter. As long as you get the warrant from Master there, you can! Or you can defeat me and step over my body!”

Ye Yuan did not argue either, turning around and leaving.

Han Qianyun looked at Ye Yuan’s departing back view and could not help feeling the delight of having taken revenge.

After he left, a figure came out, who could it be if not Feng Xuanyi?

“You did very well!” Feng Xuanyi said.

Han Qianyun hurriedly said, “Sect Master, rest assured. With me around, it’s absolutely impossible for Ye Yuan to break through!”

Feng Xuanyi nodded and said, “I naturally feel reassured about you. But this period of time, you have to be on alert and not slack off in the slightest! Below Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, he can easily break through!”

Han Qianyun said, “Yes, Sect Master!”

After that day, Feng Xuanyi took various measures to prevent Ye Yuan from entering the Land of Exile.

He knew that Ye Yuan’s methods were strange and unpredictable, so he even transferred Han Qianyun this protector over to guard Flowing Cloud Peak.

Of course, he used Shi Feiyu as the shield, so as to also reduce Ye Yuan’s bad impression.

After Ye Yuan returned, he was surprisingly quiet and did not find him to make a big fuss.

One or two days, Feng Xuanyi was naturally uneasy.

But several months passed in a row. Ye Yuan was just cultivating in closed-seclusion or teaching the heavenly alchemists to refine pills. Feng Xuanyi also naturally set his mind at ease.

However, Feng Xuanyi still had Han Qianyun wait in full battle state, to prevent Ye Yuan from slipping in.

On this day, Ye Yuan finished giving pointers to Wu Chengchao as usual.

Wu Chengchao was naturally endlessly grateful.

“Elder Ye’s alchemy path strength grows deep with each passing day. Wu Chengchao benefited a lot each time!” Wu Chengchao said with vicissitudes of emotion.

These few years of guidance, they were not the only ones who improved.

Wu Chengchao could also clearly feel that Ye Yuan was improving!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s improvement speed was unimaginably fast!

This was the scariest part!

The longer it became, the more Wu Chengchao felt that Ye Yuan’s talent was terrifying.

As for affinity this benchmark, it was long already tossed to the back of his mind by him.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Your cultivation of grade one basic heavenly pills has already approached consummation. You can start the cultivation of grade two heavenly pills already.”

The moment Wu Chengchao heard, he said, “Really?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Would I still lie to you? Go. Go to your residence. I want to give you special training.”

Wu Chengchao was ecstatic and did not suspect anything, repeatedly saying yes.

The two arrived at Skywater Peak. Wu Chengchao resided here.

As a grade three heavenly alchemist protector, there was naturally a pill room in Wu Chengchao’s residence too.

Wu Chengchao had a look of excitement on his face as he said, “Elder Ye, how are you teaching me?”

Ye Yuan casually beckoned his hand, a row of heavenly medicines landed on the table neatly.

“You extract all of these heavenly medicines first.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Wu Chengchao looked at these heavenly medicines doubtfully and said in confusion, “Elder Ye, what heavenly pill can these heavenly medicines refine? I’ve never heard of it!”

Ye Yuan said solemnly, “This is an obscure kind of grade two basic heavenly pill. That’s why you don’t need to know its origins. In a while, you just refine according to my instructions! I want to see what problems exist in your refinement of grade two heavenly pills.”

When Wu Chengchao heard that, he came to a sudden realization and said sincerely, “Brilliant, Elder Ye!”

Ye Yuan just smiled slightly and did not say anything.

It was just that Ye Yuan could not help being amused in his heart.

In a while, you won’t be calling me brilliant!

Wu Chengchao did as he said, extracting entirely all these heavenly medicines, and sending them into the medicine cauldron all at once.

Start refining pills!

Ye Yuan talked on and on in a flow of eloquence, issuing one order after another.

Wu Chengchao was like a robot being controlled, operating frantically according to Ye Yuan’s instructions.

If it were before, it would have been absolutely impossible for him to complete these instructions.

But now, he was actually able to keep up with Ye Yuan!

This discovery made Wu Chengchao wildly ecstatic.

Elder Ye is Elder Ye. My current alchemy path strength has improved too much compared to before! This is still just having cultivated grade one basic heavenly pills. If I finish cultivating grade two and three basic heavenly pills, I probably won’t be far away from grade four heavenly alchemist too!?Wu Chengchao thought in his heart.

These few years, the growth in Wu Chengchao’s strength was crystal clear in his heart.

It could be said to be a qualitative leap!

When he refined grade one heavenly pills now, it could basically all reach seventh grade and above!

Refining grade two heavenly pills could basically all reach fifth grade and above too.

As for grade three heavenly pills, those that he could not refine in the past, he could refine them now.

Those that he could refine in the past, their quality also improved greatly now!

His current alchemy path strength was definitely not worse than Qin Shun! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

All these were due to Ye Yuan!

Therefore, he was extremely grateful to Ye Yuan.

When there’s a chance in the future, I must repay Elder Ye!?Wu Chengchao made up his mind secretly.

It was just that, he did not know that his chance to repay had already come.

Wu Chengchao’s refinement went very smoothly.

Very soon, the refinement was completed!

Wu Chengchao looked at Ye Yuan with a fidgety face and asked, “Elder Ye, I wonder if my refinement this time is still okay?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Whether it’s okay or not, wouldn’t you know when you open the furnace?”

Wu Chengchao nodded repeatedly and flipped his palm. He opened the furnace!

Boom!

A cloud of yellow smog gushed out.

Wu Chengchao was caught off-guard and directly sucked in a deep mouthful.

Then his eyes rolled back, and he fell stiffly to the ground, spasming endlessly.

While Ye Yuan’s figure had already disappeared.

Looking at the smoke billowing on Skywater Peak, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This enhanced version of Windward Topple is really strong! Zhong Jianchou probably also didn’t expect that Windward Topple could become so fierce, right??Heh,?Sect Master, you miscalculated. Can a mere Han Qianyun stop me, Ye Yuan?”

Finished saying, his figure sped by, heading for Flowing Cloud Peak.

On Skywater Peak, thick smoke billowed, virtually enveloping the entire mountain peak.

“What’s going on? Just what the hell did Wu Chengchao this fellow … refine?” On Skywater Peak, a protector directly collapsed on the ground before finishing his sentence, convulsing endlessly.

There were many protectors staying on Skywater Peak.

However, after this smoke came out, it was condensed and did not disperse.

Those protectors were all being alarmed. But as long as they touched this thick smoke, they directly fell to the ground and spasmed.

Very soon, the commotion on Skywater Peak naturally attracted the attention of all peaks.

“Quick look! What’s happening on Skywater Peak?”

“I heard that the Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses on it all collapsed. Let’s quickly go up and take a look.”

“Not good! You all quickly look! That thick smoke is headed for Flowing Cloud Peak!”
