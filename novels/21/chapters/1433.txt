Chapter 1437 Qin Tian Arrives!

Whoosh!

Whoosh!

Whoosh!

...

The Giant Flame Stoneman punched again and again. The momentum was vigorous, with its power sweeping away all.

Similarly Origin Deity Realm, Duan Fei could only keep on dodging and not dare to face the enemy head-on at all.

This Giant Flame Stoneman was too strong. Each punch carried extremely profound fire laws; incomparably powerful.

“Damn Ye Yuan, when I catch you, I’ll definitely tear you limb from limb!”

Duan Fei already hated Ye Yuan to the extreme.

It was just that thoughts were thoughts, this Giant Flame Stoneman in front of him was too powerful. Duan Fei was so fully occupied that he had no time to spare for other things at all.

All around, screams lingered on incessantly.

Everyone fell into the besiege of the Giant Flame Stonemen. There were already quite a few people who had fallen.

Swoosh!

Right at this time, a black silhouette charged out of the Giant Flame Stonemen’s encirclement, turned into an afterimage, vanishing from everyone’s line of sight.

Duan Fei’s face fell and he shouted fiercely again, “Life End, could it be that you want to betray the divine palace too?”

However, ‘Life End’ ignored him, directly disappearing from his line of sight.

Duan Fei was gloomy, virtually about to explode.

He, this divine official, there was actually no one who took him seriously!

Forget about the White Night Sacred Palace, the Life End Sacred Palace’s palace lord actually dared to not listen to his words too.

This was too much!

“Damn it! After going back this time, I must charge White Night and Life End. Let the divine palace punish them! These guys are simply too arrogant!” Duan Fei sulked in his heart.

Qin Tian’s head was full of thoughts about killing Ye Yuan currently, so how could he have time to care about Duan Fei?

How the Life End Sacred Palace would end up had nothing to do with him at all.

Qin Tian’s strength already reached the extent of half-step Origin Deity. Furthermore, his law comprehension was exceedingly high, much stronger compared to those so-called palace lords.

With his strength, although charging out of the heavy encirclement took some effort, it was not considered too hard.

Hence, he was the first to charge out.

He had concealed in the Sky Foothill World for ten years, the objective was in order to kill Ye Yuan.

Now that the opportunity was in front of him, how could he possibly let it go?

...

The White Night Sacred Palace’s party, Ye Yuan was scouting out the path in front, advancing slowly.

“Grand Elder, I keep feeling that something is not quite right! Entering the Divine Ruins this time feels much more dangerous!” Bai Xiu said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, there should be a precious treasure coming into being!”

“Precious treasure coming into being!”

Hearing these words, everyone was aroused.

Precious treasure being born, who could remain calm?

Perhaps it was a lucky chance!

Seeing their expressions, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “All of you, you don’t have this expression. Precious treasures coming into being are obtained by the fated. It can’t be forced! If one doesn’t have self-awareness, they will only lose their lives in vain.”

Ye Yuan directly splashed a tub of cold water on him. But it clearly could not extinguish their enthusiasm.

These words, everyone all knew. But facing a precious treasure, how many were able to stay calm?

Suddenly, everyone arrived at an open area. The boundless essence energy undulations made everyone’s eyes lit up.

“Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruits! So many!”

“There are also quite a number of matured ones! What a big haul!”

Before their eyes were around ten Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruit Trees. The trees were full of Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruits.

Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruit was categorized into semi-mature and mature. That one that Bai Chen gave Ye Yuan was semi-mature.

In reality, even in the Sky Foothill Divine Palace, there were extremely few mature Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruits too.

Mature Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruits were greatly beneficial to Origin Deity Realm powerhouses too, even capable of increasing the chances of Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artists breaking through to Origin Deity Realm.

Therefore, when everyone saw these Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruits, they naturally coveted endlessly.

“Grand Elder, this ... Can we pocket it or not?” Bai Xiu could not resist asking.

According to the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s rules, Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruit, Purple Sand Gold, these precious treasures all belong to them.

The Sky Foothill Divine Palace would occasionally reward that little bit according to each sacred palace’s contributions.

The Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruits in Bai Chen’s possession was obtained like that.

The Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s accumulated awe was too immense. Hence, Bai Xiu this kind of wily old fox did not dare to arbitrarily take forcible possession of these fruits.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “If you pluck all the fruits, then destroy all these trees, will Duan Fei know that you obtained the immortal fruits? As long as you all don’t say, what can he do to you? Moreover, whether or not he can get out alive is still up in the air!”

The moment everyone heard this, they could not help being greatly roused.

“So ... let’s do it?” Bai Xiu said rather excitedly.

“Do it!” Ye Yuan said without any hesitation.

With Ye Yuan’s instructions, everyone immediately acted like being injected with stimulants, dividing up these Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruits in no time flat.

Bai Xiu carried five to six mature fruits and came before Ye Yuan, saying with a silly grin, “Grand Elder, without you, there wouldn’t be our White Night Sacred Palace. These Nine Melodies Psychic Immortal Fruit are what you deserve! Also, that pile of semi-matures over there all belong to Grand Elder!”

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and took one of them and said with a smile, “At least you have some conscience! But I don’t really need this thing. This one, just take it as receiving your kindness. The rest, you guys divide it!”

The White Night Sacred Palace’s group of experts were like bandits entering a village at this time, sweeping it clean.

After that, they destroyed all of these fruit trees without leaving even dregs behind.

Each and every one had grins on their faces, like having eaten honey.

Suddenly, a black-robed person wearing a ghost mask slowly stepped into this open area.

Ye Yuan’s face fell. He did not expect that this guy actually charged out so quickly.

“Qin Tian, looks like I still underestimated you!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Hearing these words, Qin Tian clearly felt very surprised, slowly took off the mask, and said, “You actually know that it’s me! Looks like your probing means are indeed impressive. No wonder Uncle Yuanlong would succumb at your hands!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Heh, your Qin Family really cover the skies with one hand!”

Qin Tian smiled and said, “Looks like you’re very furious. I enjoy this expression of yours very much! Want to blame, blame that you didn’t reincarnate well!”

“Better forget it. Reincarnating into your Qin Family, I’m afraid that I’ll be ashamed until I commit suicide!” Ye Yuan said with a sneer.

Qin Tian’s face turned cold and he said solemnly, “Razor-tongued! Today, you can’t escape your doom! The humiliation that you gave me will be washed off with your fresh blood!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

While talking, Qin Tian slowly opened but his sword sheath, the aura on his body rising sharply, directly soaring to half-step Origin Deity Realm!

The White Night Sacred Palace’s group of experts had puzzled looks and had completely no idea what happened.

All the way until this instant, the expressions on everyone’s faces changed!

“I-Intruder! He’s an intruder!” Bai Xiu cried out in shock.

When Qin Tian’s aura rose to its peak, a faint pressure of Heavenly Dao descended, oppressing over toward Qin Tian.

Qin Tian’s realm was finally suppressed at grand completion Heaven Glimpse!

What the White Night Sacred Palace was shocked at was not Qin Tian, but Ye Yuan!

They used dumbfounded gazes to look at Ye Yuan, each and every one revealing looks of incredulity.

Through this conversation, even a fool also knew that Ye Yuan and Qin Tian were the same. Ye Yuan was an intruder too!
