Chapter 1486 All So Weak?

“Hey, are my eyes failing me? Miss Li Ji she ... is actually snuggling up to a man?”

“F*ck me, Miss Li Ji is my dream lover. She ... actually has someone she likes already! Truly a fresh flower stuck onto a pile of cow dung!”

“Are your eyes blind? Compared to that kid, you’re the cow dung, okay?”

“This kid looks like a human. He’s definitely a lead spearhead that looks silver; looks good but useless! I didn’t expect that Miss Li Ji actually digs this type!”

...

Ye Yuan and Li Ji two people walking on the capital city’s streets incurred waves of exclamations.

If looks could kill, Ye Yuan would have long died several tens of thousands of times already.

Regardless of whether it was the fiend race men or human race men, they all had an accursed attribute, that was that what could not be obtained was the best.

Li Ji was Capone Capital City’s famous cold-beauty, the pursuers countless, including Ka Xin this kind of young outstanding talent.

But not a single one could move her heart.

But now, their goddess was actually captured by someone. This was simply a piece of explosive major news.

On the entire street, it was suffused with a thick sour smell.

This was not knocking over a vinegar jar, but knocking over a vinegar sea; already drowning the entire street[1].

The moment they went out the door, Li Ji snuggled up to him very daringly. A delicate fragrance bored right into his nostrils, making him involuntarily feel his mind rattle.

One had to admit, Li Ji was an exceedingly beautiful stunner.

Unrestrained but without losing inner-restraint, enthusiastic but without losing shyness. It was very different from the average fiend race women.

She did not enthrall people, but bystanders would involuntarily be attracted by her.

On the surface, Ye Yuan held his chin up and chest out, seemingly feeling proud for conquering this belle.

But in his heart, Ye Yuan was crying bitterness without ceasing.

No matter how good Li Ji was, she could not compare to Yue Mengli and Mu Lingxue’s position in his heart too.

It was just that forced by the circumstances, he could only put on a show too.

“Fiend Medicine Hall? Miss Li Ji, why don’t we enter here to take a look first?”

The two people passed by a pavilion. On it was written ‘Fiend Medicine Hall’, these three words stirring Ye Yuan’s heart.

He wanted to refine a Second Transformation Profound Gold Pill right now and was still lacking some spirit medicines.

Just now passing by the Fiend Medicine Hall, he naturally had to go in and take a look.

A hint of surprise flashed across Li Ji’s eyes and she said in surprise, “Could it be that you’re even a fiend apothecary?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Understand a thing or two.”

Li Ji suddenly beamed widely and said, “I’m accompanying you, you go where you want to.”

Ye Yuan was speechless.

...

The two people entered the Fiend Medicine Hall. Waves of rumbling sounds came from inside.

Fire seething with activity made the entire Fiend Medicine Hall’s temperature become very high.

No idea what the Fiend Medicine Hall’s people were thinking either, to actually put the medicine refining room in the outer-hall.

Four to five old men were currently working hand in hand, urging the furnace fire non-stop, bustling until their faces were covered in sweat.

Ye Yuan only swept a glance and unwittingly shook his head secretly.

It looked like he overestimated the fiend apothecaries’ alchemy standards.

This kind of standard did not even count as apprentice level in front of him.

The Heavenspan World’s races were numerous, and Alchemy Dao was categorized into various forms. Hence, there was also no centralized organization similar to the Alchemist Association.

The standard of alchemy would depend on the grade of the medicinal pills refined.

But these fiend apothecaries’ refinement techniques were simply crude to the extreme. Ye Yuan could not quite bear to look straight at it.

Of course, this was also due to his level being too high.

When he was at One-star Alchemy God, he could already give guidance to the peak Three-star Xiao Feng. The height of his level could be imagined.

Now, Ye Yuan broke through to the Heaven Glimpse Realm, his Alchemy Dao level naturally rose higher along with it.

These few years, Ye Yuan’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds, but his Alchemy Dao similarly did not fall behind.

Ye Yuan entered the Dao with alchemy, creating the Chaos Heavenspan Canon. His deep understanding of Alchemy Dao, others could not understand it at all.

With the World Suppressing Stele in hand, Ye Yuan had ample time to study Alchemy Dao.

There were even quite a few middle-aged fiend apothecaries crowding around the old men.

It looked like they should be One-star fiend apothecaries.

Clearly, they were all learning.

Ye Yuan suddenly turned toward Li Ji curiously and asked, “Are Capone Capital City’s fiend apothecaries all so weak?”

Li Ji suddenly looked up, looking at Ye Yuan in surprise. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Weak?

These few in front were leading authority-class figures among Two-star fiend apothecaries!

Even the four great families had many requests for them too. Nobody dared to offend them.

These people would actually be said to be weak!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Puu, puu, puu!

At virtually the same time, everyone suddenly turned their heads and looked at Ye Yuan.

The medicinal pills in those few pill furnaces were virtually scrapped at the same time.

Ye Yuan himself was also stunned. He asked very softly and even thought that these people all could not hear.

He did not expect that everybody heard his words!

One had to know, when alchemists were refining pills, they all gave their full attention, having no distractions in their hearts.

Even when learning, one should also put in their heart and soul.

How could his soft voice be heard by people?

Ye Yuan still really did not understand the standards of the fiend race alchemists and even thought that these few old men were just small-fry class figures. Hence, that was why he would ask this.

But looking at it now, it seemed like he caused an uproar.

“Brat, you’re a toad yawning[2]; what high-sounding sentiments!” One of the old men who was abnormally ugly looked at Ye Yuan and gave a cold smile.

Ye Yuan had yet to speak when Li Ji hurriedly spoke up, “Haha, Grandpa Meng Qi, this is a misunderstanding! In Capone Capital City, who doesn’t know that you’re a leading alchemy authority? Source Night, why haven’t you quickly apologized to Grandpa Meng Qi?!”

Li Ji winked hard at Ye Yuan, signaling him to hurry up and apologize.

Except, Meng Qi clearly did not want to let Ye Yuan off so easily. He snorted coldly and said, “So, it’s the Fan Family’s lass. Could this be a boy toy that you recruited? Strength isn’t powerful, but his tone isn’t small! This old man refined medicinal pills throughout his lifetime. Today, I was actually said to be too weak by a brat still wet behind his ears! Haha, interesting, very interesting!”

Li Ji had an embarrassed look as he said, “Grandpa Meng Qi must be joking. In the entire Capone Capital City, who doesn’t know the renown of the Fiend Medicine Hall’s five elders? Source Night he’s new here and momentarily let his tongue slip, isn’t that right, Source Night?”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “Although I really want to flatter them a bit, I seriously can’t utter it. Can’t even concentrate when refining pills, what kind of good medicinal pills can you refine anyway?”

Li Ji’s expression changed, not expecting that Ye Yuan’s temper was so stubborn, to actually not be willing to lower his head.

She knew that Ye Yuan was very proud and also had the capital to be haughty. But in alchemy, these few were already old men who had made a name for themselves long ago.

Ye Yuan’s boasting was bragged too overboard.

Ye Yuan merely swept a glance earlier and could tell the level of alchemy standard?

This boy was also too haughty, too condescending!

She kind-heartedly helped him to mediate, this guy actually still went from bad to worse.

However, Li Ji did not know, Ye Yuan could compromise in other aspects. Only in alchemy, he was truly unable to meet halfway.

Making him butter up some guys who were not even fit to do chores for him, he really could not do it.

“Haha, good! Very good! Kid, your hair isn’t even fully grown yet, but to actually dare utter this kind of boasting! This old man wants to see how high a level you are!” Seeing Ye Yuan’s attitude, Meng Qi laughed from extreme fury.
