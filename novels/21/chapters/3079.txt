Chapter 3078: All Heavens Shocked!

In the Extreme Medicine Sect’s great hall, it was silent.

Mi Tian, Cloudmount, Zhuo Bufan, and the rest all had their eyes glued on Ye Yuan. It was as if they wanted to see through him.

Hearing everything that happened in the Labyrinth Divine Palace, it was like they were listening to a book from heaven.

This Labyrinth Divine Palace trip actually concealed such a huge conspiracy.

But in the end, the three great supremacies were scammed by Ye Yuan until they could not do anything about it.

This scheme that swept up the entire 33 Heavens, the biggest winner was actually Ye Yuan, this puny little Emperor Vast?Heaven1! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

If they did not know Ye Yuan’s character, they would definitely let loose a torrent of abuse, saying that Ye Yuan was making up stories.

What made people even more overjoyed was that among the Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven powerhouses that Ye Yuan brought, more than 40 Hegemon Realms were actually born!

These people all broke through their realms when visualizing the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings.

Although a large batch was refined and died, there were also more than 20 thousand people who came back with Ye Yuan.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s Hegemon Realm powerhouses was suddenly replenished again.

Ye Yuan brought them back safely. There was no greater merit!

“Kid, I really don’t know what to say about you …” After a long time, Mi Tian squeezed this sentence out.

......

Having learned about the events that happened in the Labyrinth Divine Palace, Mi Tian’s frame of mind was like it went on a roller-coaster.

Regarding Heavenless, not many people understood him better than him.

Not only was this guy extremely powerful, but he was also even adept at scheming. He was an extremely troublesome character.

Learning that he did not know, Mi Tian’s heart could not help pounding.

But who knew that he was actually completely eaten up by Ye Yuan.

But Cloudmount said worriedly, “Ye Yuan, this time, you’ve offended the three great supremacies at once. They will definitely view you as a thorn in the side. With our Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s accumulations, we probably can’t hold them off!”

Mi Tian frowned and said, “This matter is indeed troublesome. But in the present situation, Ye Yuan is an arrow notched on the bow; no choice but to release it! Otherwise, if Heavenless that brat really refines the chaos heavenly pill, the consequences will be too dreadful to contemplate. How about this? This progenitor will migrate all of the four symbols true spirit clans to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! Whatever they are going to do, this progenitor will receive it all!”

The moment these words came out, Cloudmount, Zhuo Bufan, and the rest were all visibly moved.

They did not expect that Mi Tian could actually go so far for Ye Yuan’s sake!

One had to know that the four symbols true spirit clans had already been in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven for got knows how many years already.

That place was their root. It was their home that was passed down from generation to generation!

Furthermore, Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven belonged to a higher level plane. The heaven and earth spiritual energy, origin comprehensions, all were much stronger than Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

But Mi Tian was actually going to migrate the four symbols true spirit clans over for Ye Yuan’s sake!

Cloudmount frowned and said, “Senior Mi Tian, this is no joke! I know that you’re powerful and your prestige in the Azure Dragon Clan is extremely high. But, migration this sort of thing, the implications are too deep. You still have to think thrice!”

Mi Tian waved his hand and said, “Those three great supremacies are each harboring their own ulterior motives. No matter which one of the three of them transcends the Great Beyond in the end, it will be a cataclysmic disaster for us. Therefore, what does it matter where we are? Alright, my mind is made up. No need to urge anymore.”

… . .

Very soon, the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s news spread out, and all the heavens were shocked!

Except, the protagonist of everyone’s discussion was Ye Yuan, this unknown Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouse.

“Ancestor Heavenless actually didn’t die! Luckily, I withstood the temptation and didn’t go to the Labyrinth Divine Palace. Otherwise, it would probably have been impossible to escape my doom this time.”

“Who’s Ye Yuan? This guy actually made the three great overlord Hegemons suffer a loss? Why have I never heard of this name before?”

“This boy actually just came out of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! According to what I know, in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, Supreme Hegemons can already claim hegemony!”

“There’s also news that just came over. Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven also produced a genius called Yang Qing this time, suppressing all the geniuses from all heavens! And Ye Yuan is even more monstrous than this genius. He couldn’t even be bothered to compete with his peers!”

… . .

When the geniuses from all heavens returned to their own factions, they naturally had to report to the top.

And these news spread far and wide, sweeping across the entire 33 Heavens very quickly.

Ye Yuan’s great reputation suddenly became known by all!

Fiend race, Ancestor Kong Nie was currently pacing back and forth, clearly angered badly.

He pointed at Kong Tan’s nose and cried out angrily, “You’re great! Really excellent!?Hur hur,?you fool, you’ve lost Your Father’s face across the entire 33 Heavens this time! Are you satisfied??Mn?”

Ye Yuan became famous across the 33 Heavens. Kong Tan also became famous across the 33 Heavens.

It was just that it was about his notoriety .

During the Labyrinth Divine Palace trip, the one who was the worst off was Kong Tan.

Not only was he toyed like a monkey by Ye Yuan, but he was also even utterly played by Ancestor Heavenless and almost did not make it back.

The fiend race Hegemons that he brought over had also all died out, the losses very severe.

When these news spread out, the fiend race had already become the laughingstock of all the heavens. Kong Tan’s days were naturally difficult.

Not just Kong Tan, even Kong Nie’s old face had nowhere to put.

In just these few days of work, there were already several ‘old friends’ who ran over to congratulate him.

Kong Tan knelt down with a thud and said in tears, “Progenitor, it … it’s all because of that Ye Yuan! This child swears to definitely tear that punk’s corpse to pieces, and restore the dignity of my fiend race!”

Kong Nie sneered and said,?“Hur hur,?with just the likes of you? That Ye Yuan can refine the Eternal River’s chaos. His talent shakes you off by more than ten streets! He doesn’t even need to break through to Hegemon Realm and can already abuse you to tears! How can a genius that can make even the three great overlord Hegemons apprehensive be a mediocre person? Forget about Ye Yuan; even compared to that Yang Qing, you’re far worse too!”

Kong Tan was scolded by Progenitor Kong Nie until he wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

Too little regard for his face!

Kong Nie saw that he was unconvinced and said with a cold smile, “Put away that pitiful pride of yours! From now on, don’t think about becoming enemies with Ye Yuan. You are not his match! Also, scram back to the clan and enter closed-seclusion for this progenitor! The 33 Heavens are going to fall into turmoil right away. If this progenitor doesn’t let you exit seclusion, you’re not allowed to take half a step out of the clan ground!”

… . .

At Zhoutian Emperor Palace, inside a region of space, Ancestor Endless’ aura was feeble. Clearly, he was badly injured.

By relying on his incredible cultivation, he rushed out of the Eternal River.

However, he was refined into serious injuries by Heavenless to begin with. Being severely wounded by the Eternal River as well, he was currently almost dead.

Next to him, Zhou Xianchen revealed a look of worry.

“Ancestor, are … are you okay?”

Ancestor Endless shook his head slightly and said, “Won’t die, but not far from death either!”

Zhou Xianchen said, “Ancestor, rest assured. This child will definitely refine a chaos heavenly hill and help you recover your strength!”

Ancestor Endless smiled bitterly and said, “You are still a bit lacking! Even if there’s chaos heavenly medicines for you, you’ll be squandering good stuff too!”

Zhou Xianchen did not argue anything. He knew that Ancestor was telling the truth.

Ancestor Endless sighed and said, “Old Man Heavenless is indeed still Old Man Heavenless! This time, it’s really a double loss! But fortunately, you broke through to Hegemon Realm too, and you became a chaos heavenly master! Your potential is greater than your father’s. You have hope of succeeding this ancestor’s mantle in the future! Remember, have more dealings with Ye Yuan in the future, this boy’s future accomplishments are limitless!”
