Chapter 2656: Negotiation

“What did you say?”

When the black shark commander heard that, he was immediately furious.

The seafolk had bloodthirsty temperaments to begin with and were very irritable. How could he endure Ye Yuan’s contemptuous tone?

“I said, moron!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Foolish human, you’ll pay the price for your stupidity!”

The black shark commander’s gaze turned dark, and he suddenly opened his gaping maws wide.

A huge wave suddenly swept up from the water surface under Ye Yuan’s feet, instantly engulfing Ye Yuan.

An enormous water column rose to the sky, forming a huge whirlpool.

It could be gathered that the Ye Yuan inside the whirlpool was probably directly ground into dregs already.

Seeing this, the black shark commander said smugly,?“Heh,?stupid human!”

On top of the city walls, Cui Tong and the rest all sighed heavily.

A peerless genius actually fell just like this!

Although talented, he was a fool!

Provoking the seafolk commander like this, how could there be the logic of not dying?

“Moron, what are you being pleased about?” Ye Yuan’s voice sounded out again.

His body turned from illusory to solid.

That water column did not hit him at all!

The black shark commander trembled all over and said in astonishment, “Fine lad, spatial rule!”

Ye Yuan nodded slowly and said,?“Mn,?at least you have some knowledge, moron. Then can we talk nicely now?”

Ye Yuan repeatedly calling him a moron created a rage in the black shark’s heart.

His gaze turned dark and he said in a cold voice, “Boy, do you really think that this general can’t do anything to you?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course, you have ways to deal with me. But, before you kill me, I can assure you that these numerous underlings that you brought, those below Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum will all die! All these earlier were just a warning. If you’re still impervious to reason, you can give it a try. If you really piss me off, your Thistle South Royal Clan will be a lone general without an army in the future!”

The black shark commander’s gaze turned dark, and he said with a cold snort, “Despicable human! You snatched our Emerald Sea Divine Conch and actually still dare to be so rude!”

He was afraid!

To tell the truth, the scene of Ye Yuan instantly killing ten miles worth of seafolk just now made him extremely fearful.

These seafolk were not dead yet, but next time, it would not necessarily be the case!

This boy’s method of poisoning was inconceivable.

This time, they brought more than 60% of the seafolk’s combat force!

If they all fell here, then the Thistle South Sea Race would really suffer a great loss in vitality.

Furthermore, the Thistle South Sea Race was not peaceful across the four seas, they had extremely powerful opponents all around too.

Once all these combat forces died out, then the Thistle South Royal Clan would definitely be replaced.

He could not afford this!

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “If you were so obedient earlier, wouldn’t it have been settled? The two of us came to return the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, and you were shouting and wrangling to kill us the moment you saw us, how rude! Now, you’re blaming us for being rude? Is it that if the two of us were directly killed by you, it would be called being polite?”

The black shark’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Since it’s to return the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, hand it over!”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said crossly, “Moron, does your fish brain work or not? Want the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, sure. But shouldn’t your sea race show some sincerity first? I think that you’re not the person in charge here, right? Get the person in charge to come out!”

This black shark general’s brain was completely stiff, he only knew how to shout and wrangle.

How could this sort of person lead an operation of hundreds of millions of seafolk?

“Blackrain, step down.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The black shark commander still wanted to say something but was stopped by a voice.

Hearing this voice, the black shark commander immediately became incomparably respectful and stepped aside.

In the sea race army, a youth with the head of a dragon and the body of a human slowly walked out.

“Yes, Dragon Son, Your Highness!” Blackrain said respectfully.

At this time, Cui Tong and the rest exchanged glances on top of the city walls.

Everyone looked at each other, all shocked to the extreme.

Ye Yuan really suppressed the Thistle South Royal Clan all by himself!

“He really did it! The dragon son showing himself, the sea race has already agreed to negotiate under Ye Yuan’s oppression! We all thought that he went to deliver himself to death. In the end, he really did it!” Cui Tong drew a cold breath as he was speaking.

Ye Yuan’s series of methods left him bedazzled.

Especially the scene of paralyzing a ten miles radius of seafolk through the poison formation, the impact of that scene was too strong.

A puny little Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum stood amidst countless seafolk but was akin to a demon god.

In fact, even the sea race army, the peak Jade Sovereign Heaven Blackrain, could not do anything to him as well!

“Master Ye is really divine!” Jiang Li said in surprise.

Everyone nodded their heads, being already speechless.

Who said that Ye Yuan went to seek death?

The dragon son looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Boy, you were so confident that no one among my sea race can suppress you?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Looks like you’re a member of the royal clan. You don’t need to say this sort of outwardly threatening, but inwardly trembling words to me. If I was scared of you all, I naturally wouldn’t have dared to come out either. If you want to kill me, sure. But you’ll need to be prepared to suffer heavy losses. I’ll give you a chance. You can try it again! But this time, it won’t be an anesthetic anymore!”

The dragon son’s dragon face seemed to have an ugly look.

The Thistle South Royal Clan was an existence that the entire Land of Heavenly South dreaded. But now, it suffered a loss in front of a boy.

The dragon son said in a solemn voice, “You humans stole my royal clan’s treasure and actually still dare to threaten me. Do you really think that this dragon son doesn’t dare to fight it out?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Dragon Son, Your Highness, what the truth of this matter is, I believe that you’re aware in your heart. How did your royal clan’s ultimate treasure end up in the merfolk tribe’s Treasure Depository Pavilion? This brother of mine was also just lucky enough to be there at the time. That’s how he accidentally took the treasure away. To really talk about it, it’s still your own people’s problem!”

The dragon son could not help feeling dejected. This incident was indeed their problem.

But, of course, they would not admit it.

Actually, this matter was really a coincidence.

His younger sister, Huan Qin, was born from his royal father and a concubine of the merfolk tribe and was deeply adored by Royal Father.

Yet, this lass relied on Royal Father’s doting and committed all manners of misconduct in the Dragon Palace.

This time, she even stole the Emerald Sea Divine Conch and quietly brought it back to her maternal-side family, and casually threw it into the merfolk tribe’s Treasure Depository Pavilion.

As it happened, Huang Haoyan and party caught up and directly took it away.

In reality, Huang Haoyan was really an ultimate scapegoat.

However, this sort of thing, the dragon son would not say it even if he was beaten to death.

The dragon son was somewhat impatient and waved his hand and said, “Enough nonsense! Hurry up and hand the Emerald Sea Divine Conch over! Otherwise, I want to see whether or not you can really poison my army to death!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Dragon Son, are you taking me to be a fool? Want the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, sure! You all immediately stop casting the Creation Heavenly Rain Secret Technique and retreat to the coastline! Ten days later, I’ll bring the Emerald Sea Divine Conch and return it to the original owner there!”

“No way!”

Dragon Son waved his hand and immediately rejected it. He said, “You humans are the most untrustworthy. If you don’t return it after ten days, what about it?”

In order to launch the sea war this time, the Thistle South Royal Clan expended a huge price too.

How could they possibly let him withdraw just like this?

In reality, wanting the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was one thing. They were originally planning to teach the humans a painful lesson too.
