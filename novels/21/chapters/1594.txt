1598 Chaotic Space

“Hey, did you guys hear? Elder Ye actually wants to enter the Martial Tower’s spatial inheritance!”

“No way, right? Isn’t this seeking death? Spatial inheritance, I never heard that anyone could come out of that place before!”

“Elder Ye is such a prodigious character, and yet, he actually wants to go and commit suicide!”

“Could it be that the elders are going to watch him commit suicide just like this?”

...

Opening the inheritance, this sort of thing, could not be concealed. The news of Ye Yuan wanting to enter the spatial inheritance spread throughout the inner city very soon.

This action of Ye Yuan’s made everyone very puzzled.

A Pill Tower elder, run to the Martial Tower to join in the excitement for what?

It was fine if going to the Martial Tower, to actually run into the most terrifying spatial inheritance.

Was this being tired of living?

“Huhu, youngsters are like this, thinking that they have some talent and consider everything and everyone beneath their notice. He thinks that he’s different from the rest and can come out of the spatial inheritance. But in reality, nobody has ever come out before.”

When Head Elder heard this news, his heart burst into joy.

These few days, he did not even dare to walk out of his front door. He truly had no face to go out.

He, the exalted head elder, was actually defeated at the hands of a Three-star Alchemy God. This made him feel like he had no face to see people.

But today, his mood was exceptionally pleased, because Ye Yuan was actually going to challenge the spatial inheritance.

“Master, this Ye Yuan, one look and it’s clear that he doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. No matter how high this kind of person’s talent is, he can’t live long either!” Song Qiyang said by the side.

These few days, it was hard on this pair of master and disciple, both not going out of the front door and not stepping out of the second door. They were even embarrassed to meet guests.

Ruo Xu nodded his head and said with a smile, “The spatial laws are incomparably difficult. That predecessor used several tens of thousands of years before barely managing to comprehend two levels. Who does that Ye Yuan think he is?”

Song Qiyang said excitedly, “Second Elder actually can’t stop him either. With this, a general that Second Elder’s side just acquired is actually gone right away. Hahaha.”

Ruo Xu sneered and said, “Do you think that Xuan Yu can control that kid? With that kid’s ambition, he won’t submit to anybody! Moreover, Xuan Yu is at most evenly-matched with me too. What right does he have to have Ye Yuan became one of his generals?”

Song Qiyang’s expression changed. He really had not thought about this.

“Then just what relationship the two of them have?” Song Qiyang racked his brains in extreme terror as he said in surprise.

Ruo Xu smiled coldly and said, “Heh, what relationship can there be? If my conjectures are right, Xuan Yu should have learned quite a bit from Ye Yuan! If you must put it in terms of relationship, it’s at most considered an alliance!”

“Hiss ...”

Song Qiyang sucked in a cold breath.

He was still unable to believe until now that a kid who was so much younger than him could actually have such terrifying Alchemy Dao attainments.

Even Master and Second Elder, this level of existences, were unable to shake each other.

...

A deacon managing the Martial Tower asked Ye Yuan doubtfully, “Elder Ye, you really want to enter the spatial inheritance?”

He did not believe that Ye Yuan did not know the danger of the spatial inheritance, but Ye Yuan still came.

He kept feeling that this thing was too fake. How could there be someone who would do this kind of stupid thing?

Confidence in their own talent?

If it was the Pill Tower, no one would doubt it.

But this was the Martial Tower!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’ll have to trouble Deacon Ling to send me right in!”

Deacon Ling was helpless and could only activate the transmission array.

Ye Yuan walked into the transmission array. A light flashed and he entered inside the Martial Tower.

“This place is ...”

Ye Yuan saw the surrounding scenery and could not help drawing a cold breath.

He seemed to have been situated amidst countless mirrors. Inside the mirrors, there were countless reflections of him.

With only one glance, Ye Yuan felt his eye blur, his head dizzy.

“This place is a chaotic space. Your individual reflection is projected inside countless spaces, that’s why this kind of phenomenon would appear. If you can’t find the way out, you’ll forever be lost inside these spaces. Furthermore, between spaces, spatial extrusion might be produced, just like spatial turbulent flows. A single misstep and you’ll be crushed into smithereens!” Dustless’s voice sounded out inside Ye Yuan’s mind.

Ye Yuan instantly understood and said in surprise, “To actually use this kind of method to cultivate spatial laws, it’s truly inconceivable. The senior who left behind this inheritance is really an astonishing genius!”

“Heh, you don’t be in a hurry to praise first, this overlapping space isn’t that easy to clear. Otherwise, there also wouldn’t be so many geniuses who perish here. Even for you, a single misstep and you would also lose your life!” Dustless warned.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I can feel the spatial laws here. Even though I only grasp a superficial understanding of spatial laws currently, this first-layered heaven should be shrinking earth into an inch! I think it can’t stump me[1]!”

In the beginning, Ye Yuan only comprehended spatial laws through Sword Dao and did not know anything at all.

But later, Ye Yuan’s comprehensions toward spatial laws became increasingly more profound, gradually having a hint of understanding in his heart.

First-layered heaven seemed to be the application of space in a small area.

Putting it bluntly, it was shrinking earth into an inch.

Making use of the comprehension towards, small-scale shuttling through the void, catching people by surprise.

However, what Ye Yuan comprehended was just a bit of smattering. What he was truly strong at was still Sword Dao laws.

Spatial laws only gave Sword Dao laws a supplementary effect.

But if one could fully comprehend spatial laws first-layered heaven, then the result would be completely different.

Even one-shotting half-step Divine Lord powerhouses would be a cinch too.

“Not good! These chaotic spaces are not static but constantly moving. Ye Yuan, you have to be careful!” Dustless said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Sure enough, those overlapping spaces actually started to gradually move.

Crack! Crack!

The sound of space squeezing and shattering gave people an immense shock.

The space where Ye Yuan was at was practically going to be crushed into dust.

To simply wait and do nothing, Ye Yuan would die without a burial ground.

How could Ye Yuan still dare to stay? Directly mustering up spatial laws, he shuttled into another region of space.

But very soon, this space collapsed once more!

Ye Yuan was incomparably wretched and could only shuttle through space continuously.

But he discovered very soon that his bit of spatial comprehension was not enough to use at all.

The space became more and more chaotic. Shuttling through space also became harder and harder.

This was also just him. If someone who was completely ignorant about spatial laws was here, they would likely have long been ground into powder.

...

Martial Tower first level, which was also the entire Martial Tower’s main center.

After several days, Head Elder Ruo Xu’s figure suddenly appeared here.

“Ling Yun, I heard that Elder Ye entered the spatial inheritance. How is it now?” Ruo Xu asked.

Ling Yun was that deacon guarding the Martial Tower.

When he saw Head Elder ask about it, he shook his head and said, “The situation is likely not very good. Elder Ye’s aura is getting weaker and weaker. Most likely ... he’ll be lost inside the chaotic space.”

While talking, Deacon Ling fired out a spell. A light screen appeared.

There was a yellow dot on it. Ruo Xu knew that that represented the aura of Ye Yuan’s life.

At this time, that yellow dot already became dim, virtually almost disappearing.

[1] For those unaware, shrinking earth into an inch is referring to a traditional Xianxia skill, where one can essentially travel thousands of miles by shrinking the distance.
