1436 Winds of Fortune Change

“Lord Divine Official, catch!”

Ye Yuan urged his palm force. That chunk of incomparably massive and heavy Purple Sand Gold flew straight at Duan Fei.

Duan Fei’s expression changed several times, finally still catching it, and putting it away into his storage ring.

But right then, everyone’s expression became unbelievably ugly.

The front of the bridge and rear were all blocked by Giant Flame Stonemen.

These Giant Flame Stonemen all had incomparably strong auras. Clearly, they were not easy to deal with.

“This ... There are normally only one or two Giant Flame Stonemen around Purple Sand Gold. How come there are so many?”

“These Giant Flame Stonemen’s auras are so strong. Quite a number are even Heaven Glimpse Realm existences! This ... We’re dead this time!”

“You guys, look! There are still more below! They ... They are climbing up!”

Everyone looked down the bridge and discovered that there were still many Giant Flame Stonemen scaling up the rock wall.

With this, the surroundings were all surrounded by Giant Flame Stonemen!

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and he shouted fiercely, “Charge with me! Rush in!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan held the Evil Extermination Sword out and charged over toward the Giant Flame Stonemen ahead.

The White Night Sacred Palace’s powerhouses did not hesitate in the slightest, following Ye Yuan and charging over in the direction of the Divine Ruins’ depths.

Clank!

Ye Yuan dealt Sundering Stars with a raise of a hand. But chopping onto the Giant Flame Stoneman’s body, only sparks splashed out.

That Giant Flame Stoneman raised its fire fists and smashed over towards Ye Yuan.

The fist had yet to arrive when a surge of powerful fire laws battered over toward Ye Yuan.

So strong!

Ye Yuan’s heart went slightly cold too. This was just an initial-stage Heaven Glimpse Giant Flame Stoneman and its strength was actually so powerful, virtually able to one-shot same rank martial artists!

Although Ye Yuan was shocked, he did not panic. Raising his life, it was another Sundering Stars!

Bang!

The stone fist that was currently in full swing directly exploded.

The moment Ye Yuan made a move, it crippled one of the Giant Flame Stoneman’s arm.

“Elders, pin down all the stonemen together, the others break through first!” Ye Yuan shouted.

“Yes!” Everyone immediately answered.

But at the back, Duan Fei’s face fell and he said, “We’re going too!”

Slam!

His voice had yet to fade when an even more robust Giant Flame Stoneman flew out of the magma, directly blocking in front of Duan Fei.

Duan Fei’s expression turned sharp and he cried out in shock, “Origin Deity Realm Giant Flame Stoneman!”

That Giant Flame Stoneman did not give him the chance to be surprised at all, its fist already smashing over towards him unreasonably.

Boom!

Duan Fei was forced to exchange a blow with the Giant Flame Stoneman, being shocked back over a dozen steps.

Before waiting for him to catch a breather, that Giant Flame Stoneman’s punch arrived again.

“Damn thing! To actually dare scam me?! How did he discover this Giant Flame Stoneman?”

Duan Fei gnashed his teeth in hatred. How could he still not know that Ye Yuan dug a pit for him?

Ye Yuan giving him the Purple Gold Sand right away was to lure this Giant Flame Stoneman to deal with him.

At this time, the Giant Flame Stonemen around Duan Fei were the most.

Those stonemen that crawled up from beneath the bridge, most of them closed in around him.

It was just that those Giant Flame Stonemen were nothing to him. The most terrifying one was still this Origin Deity Realm Giant Flame Stoneman in front of him!

Duan Fei was clearly aware that he was scammed by Ye Yuan, but could only suffer a quiet loss too.

After all, Ye Yuan’s way of doing things could not pick out the slightest fault.

Ye Yuan they all were treated as cannon fodders, at the front of the team.

But now, the Giant Flame Stonemen on their side were the least instead!

They had already reached the end of the bridge. Ahead was a large cave.

And the Giant Flame Stonemen that came out from the direction of the cave were only five or six, while what the rear battalion had to deal with were several dozens.

These Giant Flame Stonemen were very powerful. Ye Yuan already heard miserable cries lingering on incessantly from behind.

“Finish the fight quickly, don’t cling to battle!” Ye Yuan said in a clear voice.

He summoned Gui Yun out too. The Nether Ghostclaw was incomparably fierce, smacking over toward a late-stage Heaven Glimpse Realm Giant Flame Stoneman.

Ye Yuan recently had breakthroughs in laws and cultivation realm. Displaying the complete version Sundering Stars was already no longer that taxing.

Swish!

Swish!

Swish!

Ye Yuan released three sword moves in succession, directly blasting that Giant Flame Stoneman’s upper body into smithereens.

But executing these three sword moves, Ye Yuan’s divine essence, more than half were consumed.

He hurriedly took out a divine essence recovering medicinal pill to consume and could not be bothered with refining it, directly covering Bai Chen and the rest over to this gap.

Bang!

The Nether Ghostclaw slapped down, directly smashing that Giant Flame Stoneman into dust.

Looking at the others again, inclusive of Bai Xiu, they had all fallen into hard battles.

“You go and help Bai Xiu, I’ll go help the rest!” Ye Yuan said to Gui Yun.

“Yes, Master!”

Gui Yun voiced his assent and went. After he cultivated the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, his combat power was extremely powerful now.

Although these Giant Flame Stonemen were strong, they would be blown up after lasting a while under his hands.

Fortunately, their side did not have grand completion Heaven Glimpse Giant Flame Stonemen. This made their battles easy to resolve.

Before long, under Ye Yuan and Gui Yun’s cooperation, those five to six Giant Flame Stonemen were all smashed to pieces, becoming balls of fireballs scattering all over the ground. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He did not have the awareness to return to save people, directly bringing the White Night Sacred Palace’s powerhouses inside.

“Ye Yuan, you dare!”

The Duan Fei who was currently fighting fiercely with the Origin Deity Realm Giant Flame Stoneman felt something in his heart and shouted at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Lord Divine Official, it’s not that I’m not helping you. But this Origin Deity Realm Giant Flame Stoneman is seriously too powerful, I have the heart but not the strength too! As the saying goes, the greater the ability, the greater the responsibility. We’ll continue scouting the path ahead for you. Let’s meet again if it’s fated!”

Boom!

Ye Yuan’s words stirred Duan Fei’s mind. The Giant Flame Stoneman’s fist rumbled over, brushing by his cheek and flying past.

Although Duan Fei dodged it, the power of laws still burnt a chunk of his skin, turning it charcoal black.

“ARGH!!”

Duan Fei cried out tragically and was considered to be disfigured.

The burns of fire laws were not that easy to treat.

“Bai Chen, does your White Night Sacred Palace want to be enemies with the divine palace?” Duan Fei could not be bothered with the injuries on his face and shouted fiercely.

Bai Chen’s expression changed and indeed stopped his footsteps.

“Master ...” Bai Chen said hesitantly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Wait for him to go out alive before coming to threaten us! Not leaving now, we’ll all have to be buried in death! Go!”

Bai Chen’s gaze turned intent. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Go!”

Bai Xiu and the rest understood this logic too. Furthermore, they held resentment in their hearts toward Duan Fei and the rest.

Duan Fei let them be cannon fodders, not a single person stepped forward to say something.

When they suffered the attack of the lava flying monsters, no one lent a helping hand too.

The resentment in their hearts had long reached the peak already.

If without Ye Yuan, their group of people would probably have long been completely annihilated now. How could they still have the chance to stand here and watch a joke?

Seeing the other seven major sacred palaces screaming miserably on the bridge, everyone felt very pleased in their hearts!

Weren’t you guys watching a show just now? Now, the winds of fortunes changed, it’s our turn!

“This Divine Ruins seems to have some abnormal changes. It will likely not be very safe in front either. Everybody, be more careful. Take care not to get lost!” Ye Yuan warned.
