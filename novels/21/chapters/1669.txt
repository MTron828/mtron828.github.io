Chapter 1673 Heavenly Dao Tempering the Body!

After experiencing the initial-most shock, these Divine Lord Realm powerhouses all found their places and started comprehending Heavenly Dao.

Ye Yuan paused briefly every three steps. He had a prolonged pause every five steps, his mind revolving rapidly.

He must walk this path entirely before he could corroborate a complete cultivation method!

Just like that, one day passed after another. No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan finally walked to the summit of ten miles.

All around, every section of distance, there were many martial artists concentrating deeply on Martial Dao.

No one knew that Ye Yuan already walked to the peak of the Divine Lord Realm.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s heart stirred, conceiving the idea of going to the next level to take a look.

Ahead was a stretch of fog. Even if Ye Yuan stood in front of it, he could not see through what was after ten miles too. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Not hesitating at once either, Ye Yuan directly took a step out, walking into the fog.

Buzz!

Powerful Heavenly Dao pressure instantly descended on Ye Yuan’s body.

At this moment, Ye Yuan finally felt the terror of the Heavenspan Mountain.

That powerful Heavenly Dao pressure was as if it was going to destroy the world, crushing his entire person.

Such a large commotion immediately startled the powerhouses at the summit of ten miles.

When Leng Qiuling saw Ye Yuan had half his body stepped into the fog, her entire body involuntarily shuddered, her eyes revealing a look of disbelief.

After the shock, Leng Qiuling immediately felt something amiss and exclaimed, “He ... He actually walked to the summit of ten miles! No, wait, what’s he trying to do?”

Zhuo Han saw it too. His immediate reaction was the same as Leng Qiuling.

“This kid ... an Origin Deity Realm, actually walked to the summit of ten miles! This ... How is this possible? Why ... Why didn’t Heavenly Dao pulverize him?” Zhuo Han said with an unresigned look.

But very soon, he discovered something amiss very quickly. Immediately, his face revealed a look of wild elation.

“Hahaha ... kid, this is called Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk; hell has no gate yet you want to barge inside! An Origin Deity Realm actually dares to enter the fog realm, you’re courting death!”

Zhuo Han let out a huge laugh as if already seeing the sight of Ye Yuan being crushed into a meat pancake.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan who already had half his body buried in the fog realm suddenly stretched his head back again. He said to Zhuo Han with a faint smile, “Idiot, you’re really noisy! Don’t leave if you have the guts. Wait for this young master to come back and teach you how to behave properly!”

Facing Ye Yuan’s threat, Zhuo Han did not take it to heart at all, saying with a sneer, “Idiot thing, do you really take this Heavenspan Mountain to be a shop opened by your family? To dare walk into the fog realm, you’re dead for sure! This young master will wait right here, come back if you have the guts!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said coolly, “Gutsy, then you wait!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around, took another step out, his entire person stepping into the fog.

When Leng Qiuling saw the situation, she could not help turning pale with fright and cried out, “Ye Yuan, don’t!”

Hearing Leng Qiuling’s cry, Zhuo Han’s expression became incomparably ugly.

This concern was entirely emitted beyond her control!

Why was this iceberg-like woman brutally harsh to him, but she cared so much about that boy?

Zhuo Han smiled coldly and said, “Don’t yell anymore! Those who enter the fog realm will definitely die. Even if you broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm, you also can’t pass through from the fog realm! This point, you should know better than me! He is dead for sure[1]!”

Leng Qiuling did not go and look at Zhuo Han at all. She was repulsed by this person to the extreme.

But she knew that what Zhuo Han had said was correct. Even a genuine Celestial Deity powerhouse also did not dare to pass through via the fog realm and enter the next realm’s territory.

But Ye Yuan did it!

If it was to say that Ye Yuan still did not die by entering the Heavenspan Mountain with Origin Deity Realm, this was a miracle.

Then now, it was absolutely impossible for a miracle to appear!

Breaking through to the Celestial Deity Realm at the summit of ten miles, one would be transported out of the Heavenspan Mountain very soon.

Only next time could they enter the layer above ten miles by passing through the Celestial Deity Realm’s passageway.

However, Ye Yuan passed through just like that!

No one knew what was there in the fog realm. But it was safe to say that no one had ever returned alive before, including some Celestial Deity powerhouses who were very curious and attempted it.

...

As Zhuo Han and the rest expected, after entering the fog realm, Ye Yuan could be said to struggle to stride forward.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

In the fog, some tiny electric snakes were flying all around.

That horrifying energy undulation, even when Ye Yuan saw it, his heart palpitated too.

However, these electric snakes wandered around, but not one landed on Ye Yuan’s body.

At this time, currently the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain quietly suspended between Ye Yuan’s eyebrows, emitting the power of Heavenly Dao.

It was also precisely the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain that supported him to enter the fog realm.

“You, kid, are really crazy enough!” Dustless said with a sigh.

He naturally knew the prowess of this fog realm . Yet, Ye Yuan walked inside.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and Heavenspan Mountain originated from the same source. Since the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain acknowledged me as its master, then the Heavenspan Mountain’s Heavenly Dao would similarly acknowledge my existence. Entering this place may seem dangerous, but actually, it’s more scary than actual danger.”

Dustless smiled bitterly and said, “You, kid, are bold but cautious. You really dare to do anything! But this time, you gambled correctly!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “These electric snakes are the true Heavenly Dao existences! They should be the existences who truly control this ten-mile Heavenspan Mountain’s rules, right? I say ... if I were to use them to temper my fleshy body, would the effects be very good?”

Dustless’s little heart that had just calmed down was immediately thoroughly frightened out by Ye Yuan’s crazy idea.

“You ... You’re really a madman! These are all the lightning of heavenly punishment!” Dustless said mortifiedly.

He suddenly turned into a wisp of green smoke and tunneled into the Soul Suppressing Pearl and did not come out again.

He knew that the following events would be rather terrifying.

But he also knew that he could not stop Ye Yuan at all.

This guy was simply a lunatic at times!

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled, communicating with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain at the same time.

The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain disappeared and reappeared again at Ye Yuan’s glabella, emitting a multicolored light.

Then, Ye Yuan suddenly extended his palm and directly grabbed toward one of the electric snakes.

Buzz ...

Virtually instantly, Ye Yuan’s entire body started twitching violently.

That horrifying energy undulation practically burned Ye Yuan to ashes.

However, the waves of light that the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain emitted were like a shield, protecting Ye Yuan firmly.

Two horrifying auras intermeshed and canceled each other.

Then, traces of energy bored into Ye Yuan’s body.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s hairs suddenly stood on end, all of his hair standing up.

At the same time, Ye Yuan revolved the Heavenly Dragon Dharma Body frenziedly. Horrifying dragon aura spread out.

That trace of energy activated the dragon race bloodline in Ye Yuan’s entire body all at once.

Ye Yuan clenched his teeth tightly, his entire body caught in intense pain.

In the 300 years, he had long cultivated his fleshy body to the peak third transformation.

But this fourth transformation, he could not find the threshold from start to end.

Today, he planned to borrow this power of Heavenly Dao and break through the shackles in one stroke!
