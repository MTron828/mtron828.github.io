1382 Stepping Forward Bravely

“Kill her!”

“Kill her!”

“Execute justice on heaven’s behalf!”

“Rid the people of a scourge!”

...

For a moment, sentiments ran high.

Although the strong reigned supreme in the martial arts world, it did not mean that there were no constraints of ethics and morality.

Especially to a large family clan like the Qin Family, they could do many nasty things in private but did not dare to put it on the table.

This slapping of Little Fatty’s today was really done too viciously!

However, Ye Yuan was rather uneasy in his heart.

The Qin Family was too quiet!

Little Fatty caused trouble for the greater part of a day, the Qin Family actually did not have one person come forward to refute.

This indicated that the Qin Family was definitely brewing some big moves.

Suddenly, a figure dashed out from the crowd and directly landed on the platform.

Xie Jingyi was startled and hurriedly clutched Qin Peiyu’s life-gate acupoint, protecting his whole body[1].

He knew that his strength was lacking, his only reliance was Qin Peiyu.

But, when he saw the arrival clearly, his expression could not help changing drastically as he exclaimed, “Third Uncle! You ... Why did you come?”

“Third Uncle?”

Seeing that middle-aged man dressed in military attire, Ye Yuan had a foreboding premonition in his heart.

Most likely, the Qin Family’s back-up plan had arrived!

The middle-aged man’s face fell, and he said with a cold snort, “If I still don’t come, you’ll even poke a hole in the sky! Brat, you’ve really become capable!”

Xie Jingyi’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Third Uncle, I didn’t poke a hole in the sky! Me doing so is just because I couldn’t bear the sight of this girl’s actions. It has nothing to do with the family!”

The middle-aged man gave a cold snort and said, “Tell me, you deliberately ruined the Qin Family’s reputation and framed our Xie Family as being disloyal. Just who was it instigated by?”

Xie Jingyi’s expression changed slightly, and he said, “Does the Qin Family’s reputation still need me to go and ruin? Heaven can uphold justice, this whore’s actions and conduct, dying a hundred times isn’t even sufficient!”

The middle-aged man’s face fell, and he said, “Is that so? Then I ask you, you said this whole bunch, is there proof?”

Xie Jingyi’s face turned stiff. The Qin Family’s people did things very cleanly. He really did not catch much evidence.

The things that Qin Peiyu did, he had inquired about them.

The middle-aged man laughed coldly and said, “If you’re out to condemn someone, you can always trump up a charge! Qin Peiyu this lass is a little unruly and willful, but that’s also just the temperament of a young lady! Pray tell, among this capital city’s large families, which family’s missus isn’t unruly or willful? You put so many crimes onto a little girl, how can you bear it?”

Brilliant Peace City was one of the top major counties of Wu Meng Capital City. The Xie Family was a large family clan of Brilliant Peace City, their strength second only to the Jia Family.

Such a large family, there were naturally quite a number of people holding appointments in the capital city.

This middle-aged man was Xie Jingyi’s third uncle, Xie Zhaoyun. Presently, he was a high-level commander of the city guards, his strength uncommon.

With his status, coming forward to question his own nephew would not be more appropriate.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that the Qin Family actually pulled out this major killing tool. Little Fatty was probably going to be overwhelmed.

Sure enough, Xie Zhaoyun’s words made Little Fatty at a loss for words.

Although he clearly knew that Xie Zhaoyun was turning black into white, without sufficient proof, what would he use to refute?

If it was the Qin Family’s people, he could spit back.

But this one in front of him was his elder, his third uncle!

Xie Zhaoyun smiled coldly and said, “Also, what kind of person you are, I’m all too clear! With your strength, it’s totally impossible to pass the Wu Meng Academy’s entrance examination! Just how did you deceive everybody and become a student, I’m very curious!”

Talking until here, Xie Zhaoyun let out a sigh again and said sincerely in a grave tone, “Oh Jingyu, I know that your nature is pure, you must have been hoodwinked by bad guys, that’s why you would commit such a grave error! Alright, this farce ends here! Peiyu this lass is indeed rather overboard when doing things normally, you hand her to me, I’ll have Qin Nantian discipline her properly! As for you ... you rest assured, with me around, the Qin Family won’t do anything to you.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

While Xie Jingyi was smart, he had not seen such a grand line-up before in the end. He was very tensed up to begin with.

Now, under Xie Zhaoyun’s systematic guidance, this tightly wound nerve finally slowly loosened up.

In addition, Xie Zhaoyun was his third uncle, this made him have a natural closeness.

Gradually, he lowered his guard.

Right at this time, a cold glint flashed in Xie Zhaoyun’s gaze, and he was about to make a move and snatch her.

A figure floated up and blocked in front of him.

Although Ye Yuan’s strength was far from Xie Zhaoyun’s, the timing that he appeared was just right, which just happened to interrupt the other party’s accumulation of momentum.

Xie Zhaoyun also did not expect for someone to throw a wrench in the works. In a moment of oversight, he almost stifled out internal injuries.

“Who are you?” Xie Zhaoyun said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan gave him a nonchalant glance and said, “Didn’t you say that there’s someone instigating him behind the scenes? That’s me.”

Xie Zhaoyun’s face fell, and he said in a cold voice, “Sowing discord with my Xie Family and the Qin Family’s relationship, just what wicked intentions do you have?!”

Seeing Ye Yuan appear, Xie Jingyi’s expression was rather complicated.

Seeing Xie Zhaoyun questioned it at this time, he hurriedly said, “This is my own idea. It has nothing to do with Ye Yuan. He doesn’t know anything at all!”

Xie Zhaoyun smiled coldly and said, “Unrelated? Heh, do you think that I’d believe? I was still wondering, with your courage, how could you dare to do this kind of thing! Now, the main culprit finally came out!”

Ye Yuan patted Xie Jingyi’s shoulder and said with a faint smile, “Carrying out justice on heaven’s behalf is a good thing, why are you in a hurry to shake off relations with me? Why? This kind of good thing, don’t want to let me have a share?”

Xie Jingyi opened his mouth but did not know what he should say.

He purely had blood rush to his head previously and did such an earth-shattering major thing.

Ye Yuan’s questioning made him step into a dead end, only wanting to prove himself, but did not think how to clean up the mess after this matter was done.

Actually, standing on this platform, Xie Jingyi knew that he got into big trouble. Hence, he did not wish to involve Ye Yuan in it.

This matter was indeed done by him alone, Ye Yuan did not know about it at all.

He did not expect that this matter finally still startled Ye Yuan.

Furthermore, what Xie Jingyi did not expect was that Ye Yuan actually took the initiative to come forward to admit that this matter was instigated by him at the back!

The flesh on Xie Jingyi’s face was convulsing, tears already welling up in his eyes. He ... was too touched.

He understood Ye Yuan’s meaning, Ye Yuan was going to wipe his ass here!

Except, this matter already became the talk of the town. Ye Yuan was all on his own, so how would he clean up this mess for him?

“Carry out justice on heaven’s behalf? Heh, ignorant child, what qualifications do you have to carry out justice on heaven’s behalf? It’s still that sentence, bring out the proof!” Xie Zhaoyun said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Finding me for proof, is it? Then I’ll ... show you!”

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan’s finger already arrived on Qin Peiyu’s forehead, no idea since when. Divine essence spitting, it directly destroyed all of Qin Peiyu’s vitality.

Immediately, the entire Wu Meng Plaza became dead silent!

Xie Zhaoyun’s eyeballs were almost popping out, looking at this scene in disbelief.

“You ... You ... You really dared to do it!”
