Chapter 1458 Power of the World!

The entire sky seemed to be distorted.

Ye Yuan felt that there was a vast power ahead. His entire person seemed to have gotten stuck in a cloud of cotton, unable to break free no matter what.

“It’s the power of the world! That Wu Meng City Lord came in person!” Dustless’s voice sounded out in Ye Yuan’s mind.

Ye Yuan’s heart abruptly sunk to the bottom of the valley. What he was most worried about was this Wu Meng City Lord. He did not expect that this guy really made a move.

He originally thought that this Wu Meng City Lord disdained to bother with such things.

It looked like he really miscalculated this time!

This Wu Meng City Lord’s relationship with the Qin Family was even more extraordinary than he imagined.

Ye Yuan knew that he could not escape anymore and simply gave up resistance.

At this time, Qin Zhaoyun trio finally caught up.

Seeing the situation, Qin Zhaoyun burst into laughter and said, “Brat, aren’t you very good at running? Run for me to see!”

Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “Ate a face-full of dust following behind your little lord, still dare to bullshit. Your skin is really thick enough!”

Qin Zhaoyun’s face fell and he said fiercely, “Brat, you’re courting death!”

Qin Zhaoyun did not say another word, directly smacking a palm at Ye Yuan.

Boom!

The powerful attack force seemed to have hit onto a ball of sponge. Ye Yuan was entangled by the power of the world and could not avoid it at all, forcefully receiving this palm.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan spewed fresh blood wildly from his mouth, his body drifting down toward the ground like a kite with a broken string.

But the power of the world still wrapped around him, making him float in the air and not land.

If not for the power of the world withstanding most of the power, Ye Yuan would already be a dead man right away no.

“Heh, brat, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Be arrogant again for me to see!”

Qin Zhaoyun’s move succeeding, he immediately felt unusually liberated.

“Old dog! You remember it for me, all of this today, this young lord will return it a hundred-fold in the future!” Ye Yuan glared and said through gnashed teeth.

“Heh heh, are you, brat, still dreaming? Even Lord Qin Xiao has taken action. You still think you have a future?” Qin Zhaoyun said with a smug look.

The moment Qin Zhaoyun’s words came out, not just Ye Yuan, Zhao Yi and Wen Yiyang’s expressions changed.

The city lord was actually surnamed Qin!

This way, everything could be explained!

No wonder these few years, the Qin Family summoned the wind and commanded the rain in Wu Meng Capital City, suppressing the other major families, outshining the others.

No wonder the Qin Family’s disciples were so cocky, but the City Lord Manor turned a blind eye to it.

Everything originated from the city lord’s surname!

“Zhaoyun, you spoke too much!”

An icy-cold voice sounded out. A mighty middle-aged man walked out of the void.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent. This middle-aged man was precisely that middle-aged man he saw during the entrance examination!

Seeing Qin Xiao, Qin Zhaoyun’s expression involuntarily changed and he said with a bow, “Yes, City Lord, Your Excellency! Zhaoyun knows his mistake!”

Qin Xiao grunted his assent and said coolly, “This city lord is the Qin Family’s foster son and not a member of the Qin Family Clan. After you all hear it today, you’re not allowed to mention it to others again!”

Feeling Qin Xiao’s profound gaze, Wen Yiyang and Zhao Yi both got a shock and hurriedly bowed and said, “Yes, City Lord, Your Excellency!”

In Wu Meng Capital City, Qin Xiao virtually did not show face in front of people. No one knew his surname before either.

This matter, probably even Qin Tiannan did not know. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Only Qin Zhaoyun, this kind of Qin Family’s top existence, knew Qin Xiao’s true identity.

More than 100 thousand years ago, Qin Xiao received the Qin Family’s great kindness, that was how he had today’s accomplishments.

It was just that far too long had passed, no one remembered it anymore.

Qin Xiao slowly turned around, looked at Ye Yuan, and said indifferently, “Ye Yuan, your talent is outstanding, your future accomplishments will surely surpass this city lord’s in the future. It’s too bad, you shouldn’t have become enemies with the Qin Family.”

Ye Yuan glared at Qin Xiao and did not have the slightest fear toward a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse as he spat and said, “Pooh! You can’t tell right from wrong, condoning the Qin Family to engage in lawlessness. You’re not worthy of being the city lord! If I’d know it would come to this, this young lord should have cleaved that Four-star divine pill back then with a sword, so as to avoid feeding a dog!”

“Hiss ...”

Wen Yiyang and Zhao Yi were both shocked hearing it. There was actually someone who dared to speak this way to a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse!

This boy was really lawless and unbridled!

Rather, Qin Zhaoyun sneered coldly in his heart.

Scold, the more viciously you scold, the faster you die!

However, Qin Xiao’s self-restraint was much better than Ye Yuan imagined.

He just said coolly, “The Qin Family was kind to me, what’s wrong with this city lord doing so? After coming back from the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, this city lord already hinted to you to not be enemies with the Qin Family, but you were impervious to reason and advice. Not only did you remain impenitent, you actually went from bad to worse!”

Ye Yuan burst into laughter when he heard that and said, “Remain impenitent? Hahaha ... really making your grandfather die of laughter! Who the hell are you, to dare make Grandpa Ye repent?”

The three people at the back quaked in their boots listening. This Ye Yuan was really too wild. That was a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, a god-like existence!

Don’t look at how the three of them were all half-step Divine Lord Realm, in front of a Divine Lord Realm, it was completely not enough to look at.

Divine Lord Realm powerhouses opened up a small world and possessed the augmentation of the power of the world. It was completely not what Divine Dao Three Realms people were able to imagine.

The closer one was to the Divine Lord Realm, the more awe they had toward this realm!

People able to reach this step, not one was not a peerless genius.

However, Ye Yuan did not place Qin Xiao in his eyes at all!

Qin Xiao swept a glance over Ye Yuan and said coolly, “This world is originally the strong reigning supreme! I control a region of the world, taking charge of a capital city. I ask you to repent, you have to repent! The outcome of not repenting ... is death!”

Finished talking, Qin Xiao lightly tapped a finger out. A terrifying aura instantly condensed.

Qin Zhaoyun trio all had solemn looks when they saw this.

This was the strength of a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse!

“Now is the time!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, his figure suddenly bursting forth, rushing out like an arrow that had left the string.

Qin Zhaoyun trio had stunned looks. Qin Xiao’s gaze turned intent too.

Ye Yuan actually broke through his power of the world!

An initial-stage Heaven Glimpse brat actually broke through a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse’s power of the world!

This ... This was simply an unthinkable thing!

This matter was even more astonishing than Ye Yuan killing five great geniuses.

Ye Yuan urged divine essence to the limit, fleeing desperately.

Resigning himself to death had never been his, Ye Yuan’s, style.

As long as there was a trace of hope, he would put in 100% effort!

The so-called power of the world was merely a type of application of Heavenly Dao.

It seemed profound and unfathomable, but Ye Yuan had the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!

He was shouting abuses with Qin Xiao and the rest on the surface. Actually, he was secretly communicating with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain the entire time.

He could imitate the Sky Foothill World’s Heavenly Dao, he could naturally break apart Qin Xiao’s power of the world!

After being thunderstricken, the corner of Qin Xiao’s mouth smiled coldly and he said, “Somewhat interesting, but ... it’s useless!”

While talking, Qin Xiao took a step out, instantly moving a thousand miles!

Ye Yuan’s speed was already quick to the extreme but was instantly surpassed by Qin Xiao!

“I very much want to see just what secrets you have on you.” Qin Xiao smiled as he pointed a finger. Ye Yuan felt that the entire world was crushing toward him.

Swoosh!

Qin Xiao’s gaze turned intent. Ye Yuan actually disappeared before his eyes!
