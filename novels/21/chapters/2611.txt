Chapter 2617: Swearing

On True Feather Peak, the sound of a needle dropping could be heard.

No one expected that Sect Master did not stint to abdicate and actually wanted to protect these two people too!

Even Ye Yuan was shocked for a while too.

A sect master was a sect’s sea-stabilizing needle.

Unless a huge change happened to the sect, otherwise, there would be extremely few changes.

Especially the master of a sect who was like the noonday sun, such as Feng Xuanyi!

But now, he actually took the initiative to abdicate for him and Luo Yunqing.

A warmth flowed through Ye Yuan’s heart.

Just for this high regard, Ye Yuan also had to help the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect tide over the difficult hurdle this time!

Head Elder Shen Chang’s gaze turned slightly intent, showing a visible change in countenance all over his face.

He did not expect that Feng Xuanyi was actually so determined.

“Sect Master, you’re speaking too seriously!” Shen Chang let out a sigh and said.

But Feng Xuanyi said calmly, “Head Elder, it isn’t too serious! This matter concerns the sect’s destiny. I’m also not impassioned with excitement! I admit that when Qin Shun was expelled from the sect back then, this sect master severely underestimated the Pill Alliance’s strength. But, since shedding all pretenses of cordiality is already unavoidable, we have no need to offer ourselves up to be humiliated anymore!”

“If we lower our heads this time, disregarding how the other sects would view us, could it be that the Pill Alliance will let us off? No one will pity the weak. Want to resist the Pill Alliance, we can only continuously strive to become stronger!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Shi Feiyu smiled coldly and said, “Sect Master, you said it just nicely! But without the assistance of heavenly pills, how do we continuously strive to become stronger? Disregarding ordinary disciples, even you and I, these Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, also have to purchase heavenly pills from the Pill Alliance there, right?”

Feng Xuanyi’s brows furrowed, immediately feeling put on the spot.

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect did not have grade four heavenly alchemists. They all, these elders’ heavenly pills, had to be purchased from the Pill Alliance.

It was also precisely because of this that the Pill Alliance’s boycott was a powerful deterrent.

Feng Xuanyi being forced to nod his head previously, actually, the biggest reason was also precisely because of this.

Without grade four heavenly pills, it was not that they, these Jade Sovereign Heavens’ cultivation would come to a standstill, but it would definitely become much slower.

If things went on like this, the sect’s strength would definitely have the distance pulled apart quickly.

Heavenly pills were not a must, but without heavenly pills, it was hard to take a single step.

Even if it was Ye Yuan, he only successfully broke through after consuming several dozen heavenly imperial pills too.

Shen Chang also nodded and said, “Sect Master, this crime of forcing you to abdicate, this old man can’t bear the charge. But you’ve got to come up with a solution for the sect’s current predicament, right? Saying to continuously strive to become stronger with all talk but no promises, that is useless!”

These words were somewhat penetrating criticism. It was also equivalent to checkmating.

Feng Xuanyi’s expression became even uglier. But now, he already mounted a tiger’s back and found it hard to get off.

At this time, Ye Yuan walked out slowly and said coolly, “Is Head Elder asking for a solution with all talk but no promises here is useful?”

Shen Chang’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Impudent! Brat, is it your turn to speak here?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I wonder if my position as an elder has already been revoked? If it hasn’t been revoked yet, my status in the sect should be equal to Head Elder. It shouldn’t be considered impudent, right?”

Shen Chang’s face turned face, and he was choked on the spot until he could not speak.

These few years, everyone all thought that Ye Yuan was dead. So nobody went to care about this elder.

A Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum elder, if he was dead, he was dead.

Even if he caused a stir for some time, it was also just akin to a comet.

But now, it made Shen Chang unable to speak.

“Looks like I, this elder, still have the right to speak. Then, I’ll say a few words.”

Ye Yuan cleared his throat, his gaze sweeping across the faces of the elders, and said with a sneer, “With all due respect, everyone present here is a trash!”

One sentence caused everyone’s faces to suddenly change.

Even Feng Xuanyi’s expression changed slightly too.

This guy was really hell-bent on shocking people to death with his words!

“Ye Yuan, you, a mere Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, actually dare to engage in wild talks here and insult all the elders!” Shi Feiyu said in a great rage.

“Brat! You caused such a terrible disaster, and yet you actually still have the face to insult the sect’s elders now! Do you really think that this elder doesn’t dare to kill you?” Head Elder also flew into a great rage.

But Ye Yuan smiled brightly and said disdainfully,?“Tsk tsk,

?turns out that Head Elder still knows that it’s a terrible disaster huh! Since it’s a terrible calamity, what have you all done these few years??Mn??Sent the sect’s most talented disciple in alchemy onto the enemy’s bed! Made the elder with the strongest combat power in the sect heartbroken and break his sword!?Heh,?are you all our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s elders, or that Pill Alliance’s elders?”

“An enemy is invading, you guys don’t think to unite against outsiders, but you exhausted your abilities and means against your own people! Head Elder, let me ask you, do you know how many Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses the Pill Alliance has? Do you know how many grade four heavenly alchemists the Pill Alliance has? Do you know which are the Pill Alliance’s forces??Huhu,?looking at your expression, you don’t know! You, you all! Can’t even figure out your opponent’s exact details, but you only know to exhaust your abilities to deal with your own people! Scolding you all trash is thinking highly of you all!”

Ye Yuan was stern in voice and countenance, stating the painful aspect in grief, his fingers almost pointing at Head Elder’s nose and making the group of elders lower their heads dejectedly.

Yes, they did not know how strong the Pill Alliance was at all!

The Pill Alliance’s boycott came very suddenly.

Then the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect discovered that they could not purchase heavenly medicines and heavenly pills anymore.

Their original channels for purchasing heavenly medicines and heavenly pills had all disappeared.

Feng Xuanyi had also thought of various methods for this, but it was to no avail.

As a result, the Pill Alliance’s mysteriousness and power became deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

But, being pointed out by Ye Yuan at this time, many people’s faces turned red with embarrassment.

Indeed, they had done nothing in these past 20 years!

Ye Yuan looked at the Shi Feiyu who was glaring at him and said with a sneer, “What are you looking at? Not convinced? I’m scolding you!”

Shi Feiyu answered back sarcastically,?“Huhu,?you’re impressive! Having caused such a terrible disaster, you still dare to scold people here. You’re impressive! If you have the capability, resolve the sect’s crisis!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Wasn’t counting on you in the first place either! Other than ranting a few words and racking your brain to deal with your own people, you have no other capability either.”

Done talking, he turned to Feng Xuanyi and said with cupped fists, “Sect Master, since this matter was caused by Ye Yuan, then the deadlock will be broken by Ye Yuan! Leave this matter to me!”

Feng Xuanyi smiled bitterly and said, “This sect master knows that you’re amazingly talented, but your cultivation realm is too low. What can you do to a behemoth like the Pill Alliance? Forget it. This matter still needs to be discussed at length!”

Ye Yuan scolding them was to give vent to his anger. But Feng Xuanyi felt that his blood was currently boiling with zeal.

There was no need to come forward forcefully at this sort of time, and it was also impossible.

How could a mere Ye Yuan be the Pill Alliance’s match?

But Ye Yuan said, “Sect Master, this Ye isn’t showing off momentary bravery! I’ll give the sect an explanation for this matter! But this Ye also needs the sect’s support! Give me 20 years, and I’ll break the situation of the Pill Alliance’s monopoly! In 20 years, not only will I break this deadlock, I’ll even return the sect a grade four heavenly alchemist! At that time, the sect won’t need to live at the whims of others too!”

Ye Yuan’s words made Feng Xuanyi’s expression change slightly.

But Head Elder smiled coldly and said, “Bragging too hard! If you can’t do it, what will you do?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If I can’t do it, this Ye will commit suicide by cutting my throat to thank the sect!”
