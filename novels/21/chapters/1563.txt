Chapter 1567 This Ye Proposes a Toast to You

“Hahaha! I finally broke through! Half-step Divine Lord! This step has eluded me for how many years! Today, I finally took you down!”

Inside a hidden chamber, Zhu Yongtian started laughing wildly.

Secluding for a month, he finally broke through to the half-step Divine Lord Realm!

This step had troubled him for many years.

Once he broke through, he would also be an apex existence in the entire outer city.

“Master Ye’s Alchemy Dao is unparalleled. One medicinal pill let me break through the bottleneck that had plagued me for many years!” Zhu Yongtian said with vicissitudes of emotion.

A month ago, Ye Yuan came to the Thunderclap Gang’s headquarters and gave the few of them brothers a medicinal pill each.

It was this medicinal pill that let him break through the bottleneck.

Toward Ye Yuan, he had the utmost admiration.

Zhu Yongtian slowly got up and said to himself, “I wonder how those few fellows are? Master Ye taking action, they probably broke through successfully too, right?”

Coming to the headquarter’s hall, he saw that Boss Xing Guan was already there.

Seeing Xing Guan, Zhu Yongtian’s eyes lit up and he said in pleasant surprise, “Big Brother, you ... you’re almost breaking through?”

The aura on Xing Guan currently was very unstable, a feeling of breaking the cocoon to become a butterfly, seemingly going to burst at any time.

The joy on Xing Guan’s face could not be concealed in the slightest, and he said with a smile, “All thanks to Master Ye’s Five Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill, I finally touched that layer of threshold! When the south city’s matters have been dealt with, I’ll enter terminal seclusion and strive for an early breakthrough!”

Zhu Yongtian was overjoyed and said, “Congratulations and felicitations to Big Brother! That Xiao Riyue probably never dreamed that he broke through to Divine Lord Realm and did not unify the south city, but we did it!”

Xing Guan smiled and said, “I also didn’t expect that I really have the chance to step into Divine Lord Realm in this lifetime! All thanks to Master Ye! If not for him, our Thunderclap Gang would likely have long been destroyed!”

Zhu Yongtian nodded and said, “What we owe Master Ye is really too much!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Before long, the third head also came to the hall.

Xing Guan and Zhu Yongtian’s eyes both lit up and they said with pleasant surprise, “Ol’ Third, you broke through too! Hahaha ... three half-step Divine Lords in one gang, who will still dare to be insolent in front of my Thunderclap Gang in the future in this south city!”

The third head’s strength was slightly weaker than the second head’s, but he had also long stepped into grand completion Origin Deity.

Consuming Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill, he also successfully broke through to become a half-step Divine Lord.

After learning the news that Xing Guan was about to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, Third Head was also extremely excited.

Before long, Fourth Head, Fifth Head, and the rest all exited seclusion. Each one all broke through without the least bit of surprise.

Xing Guan said with vicissitudes of emotion, “An alchemist like Master Ye is simply too terrifying! He used a month’s time to create an unshakable force in the south city!”

When the few people heard, they also had a feeling like a lifetime had passed.

Ever since encountering Ye Yuan, their Thunderclap Gang underwent earth-shaking changes.

Recalling back then, when Ye Yuan requested them to change names, they nearly even came to blows.

Thinking about it, they all had some lingering fear.

If they were to really fall out with Ye Yuan, the consequences would be very terrifying!

Xing Guan’s gaze suddenly became sharp and he said in a solemn voice, “The south city has been in chaos for so many years. It’s also time to establish a new order!”

That very night, blood flowed like a river in the south city.

The Silverfeather Gang’s chief head, Luo Yu, was personally killed by Xing Guan.

As for the Sun Moon Gang’s He Xiao, he also died under Zhu Yongtian’s palm, finally avenging the enmity of an arrow.

The Thunderclap Gang annexed the Sun Moon Gang and Sun Moon Gang, becoming the south city’s number one major power.

Under the Thunderclap Gang’s persecution, the Dongfang Family and Deyi Hall chased Wu Feng out.

That very night, Wu Feng died on the streets.

As a result, the south city formed an arrangement of one dragon and three tigers.

The Thunderclap Gang ran a monopoly. Immediately after were the three great families.

...

While at this time, Ye Yuan was currently walking on Wu Meng Capital City’s streets calmly and composedly.

“Really can’t imagine, how did such a low-grade capital city groom a peerless genius like you?!” Ning Siyu looked at Ye Yuan and said with a puzzled look.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “My experiences here weren’t so pleasant. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be this trip either.”

While talking, a group of people came to a luxurious restaurant. It was precisely the Clearwind Inn.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Come on, the dishes in this restaurant are pretty good. Let’s go upstairs and wait for them.”

Entering the Clearwind Inn, the shopkeeper recognized Ye Yuan at a glance.

He could not help trembling all over, revealing a disbelieving expression.

“Y-Y-Ye Yuan! Y-Y-You ... actually came back!”

The bloodbath on the streets back then, Ye Yuan killed five grand completion Heaven Glimpse academy students alone, akin to a killing god. The shopkeeper’s impression was very deep.

Hence, seeing Ye Yuan at first glance, he recognized him.

Ye Yuan was not surprised and said with a faint smile, “Yeah, came back.”

The shopkeeper hurriedly pulled him to one side and whispered, “How can you return?! Although so many years have already passed, the wanted order for you has never been revoked! With you returning, isn’t it walking right into a trap?”

Ye Yuan was somewhat surprised and said with a smile, “I even thought that you’d blow the whistle on me!”

The shopkeeper laughed and said, “What are you saying?! You were the entire Wu Meng Capital City’s hero back then, defeating several hundred capital cities’ elites in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, bringing back glory to Wu Meng Capital City. I didn’t expect that City Lord actually treated you like this! Hurry up and go, there are eyes and ears everywhere in the Clearwind Inn, how can you show up here?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s okay, shopkeeper, bring up fine wine and good dishes for me. Revisiting an old place, this young master’s mood is pretty good, haha!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan went straight up to the second floor, leaving behind a baffled looking shopkeeper.

Even if 20 years had passed, Ye Yuan was still a legend of Wu Meng Capital City.

Because of the things that he did, no one could match it in the history of Wu Meng Capital City.

The shopkeeper still served Ye Yuan and the rest wine and food. Ye Yuan raised his cup and said with Little Fatty with a smile, “Revisiting an old place, what emotions do you feel?”

Little Fatty shook his head and said, “I’ve long become indifferent! Right now, I only want to obtain powerful strength and tell those people who looked down on me before that I’m living very well!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You see, you see, there you go again. Oh, you, said that you’re indifferent, but actually, you’re still living in the shadow of the past. That joker little fatty back then is already gone?”

Little Fatty said indifferently, “People need to grow up!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Mental demon not disappearing, whence the grow up? Only by going back to yourself, can it be considered truly walking out.”

The group of people was chatting away when teams of city guards already surrounded the Clearwind Inn like an iron bucket.

The originally noisy street became very quiet.

An icy-cold aura crept out within the Clearwind Inn.

“Ye Yuan, come out and prepare to die!” an icy-cold voice sounded out.

The shopkeeper ran up hastily, his head covered in cold sweat as he said to Ye Yuan, “You see, I asked you to be more careful, right?! Commander Zhao has already brought the city guards and surrounded the Clearwind Inn like an iron bucket! Now, you’re hard-pressed to escape even if you grow wings!”

Ye Yuan smiled. He gestured toward the shopkeeper to sit on a chair there, and he said with a smile, “Shopkeeper, you’re pretty good! Come, this Ye will propose a toast to you, cheers!”
