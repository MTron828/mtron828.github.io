Chapter 2347: Golden List Powerhouse!

“Young Friend Ye, are you still persisting? Do you know that you’ve already become Cloudaid City’s laughingstock? Do you know what they are saying about you behind your back? Especially Jiang Zhe, what he says is very unpleasant,” Earth Duck urged painstakingly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

For three years, Ye Yuan had been persistently collecting time law fragments all this while.

Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck husband and wife naturally also knew about this news. Hence, they wanted to persuade him to dispel this idea.

But Ye Yuan was very stubborn.

“Two seniors, Ye Yuan’s mind is made up. You don’t need to persuade me any longer,” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

These three years, Ye Yuan practically did not go out to train. The majority of the time was staying in Cloudaid City to wait for news.

As long as he received the news, he would head to the wilderness to hunt Battle Xuan Beasts.

However, it was also not without gains.

Every once in a while, he would go out to hunt for a period of time.

Primeval War Realm’s heaven and earth spiritual energy was extremely rich. In a short three years’ time, Ye Yuan’s realm already closed in on peak initial-stage World Realm.

This time, he just received the news that a Battle Xuan Beast King appeared in Longriver Forest. Ye Yuan was just planning on going out of the city to hunt.

Battle Xuan Beast Kings were very powerful, their realm comparable to peak Sixth Firmament Heavenly Emperor, but their combat strength was far greater than that.

More importantly, the time law of Battle Xuan Beast Kings was very strong, ordinary martial artists could not beat them at all.

Ye Yuan’s current time law fragment was only left with the last tiny bit.

After hunting this Battle Xuan Beast King, his time law piece should be able to be pieced together.

Hence, he did not hesitate in the slightest, directly getting ready and setting off.

Ye Yuan did not care about god of war points ranking at all. The god of war points that he hunted these few years was practically all exchanged for heavenly emperor spirit treasures apart from using to issue missions.

Presently, Ye Yuan’s sword formation was already replaced with Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures.

The power of the sword formation was virtually unstoppable!

Seeing Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck looked at each other and smiled bitterly.

“This babe, it’s true that his talent is high, but he’s too stubborn!” Earth Duck said.

Heaven Mandarin nodded and said, “Yeah! This kid is a character who’s hopelessly headstrong. We can’t persuade him.”

“Huhu, our genius went out to hunt Battle Xuan Beasts again? Tsk tsk,

after he comprehends time law, he’ll definitely sweep across the entire Primeval War Realm! Remarkable! Remarkable!” From the back, came Jiang Zhe’s ridiculing laughter.

Another person burst into laughter as he said, “Does this fool want to use this kind of method to prove that his talent is stronger than Wan Zhen? I only want to say that, very stupid and very naive! Hahaha ...”

Similar ridicules, Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck already heard too much.

Either way, Ye Yuan’s affairs had long already become the topic of ridicule for everyone after their meals.

The two of them also could not be bothered to care. So they just snorted coldly and directly left.

... ...

Leaving Cloudaid City, Ye Yuan sprinted straight for Longriver Forest.

Longriver Forest’s fierce beasts were extremely powerful. There were also a lot of powerhouses here.

Ye Yuan arrived at the location of the intel and started searching for the whereabouts of the Battle Xuan Beast King.

“Roar!”

After a bout of searching, Ye Yuan finally discovered traces of the Battle Xuan Beast King.

He looked overjoyed and stepped forward brandishing his sword.

The Battle Xuan Beast King was well-deserving of being beast king level. Just his figure was twice as large as an ordinary Battle Xuan Beast.

The moment Ye Yuan approached its surroundings, he immediately felt like he had fallen into a time quagmire.

“Roar, roar ...”

When the Battle Xuan Beast King saw a human, it pounced over crazily.

“Vile beast, you dare?!”

Ye Yuan bellowed, spatial law and sword formation suddenly operating.

Two great powers of source surged frenziedly in the quagmire of time law, attempting to cause trouble for the Battle Xuan Beast King.

However, Ye Yuan really met his match this time.

Time law’s power greatly exceeded his imagination.

His sword formation operated very strenuously.

His divine essence and soul force expenditure was practically several times the usual.

But the efficiency was less than half of the usual.

Coupled with that he was several minor realms lower than the Battle Xuan Beast King, Ye Yuan virtually fell into a hard fight in an instant.

Right when Ye Yuan fell into a tough battle, on top of the treetops of a distant forest, a middle-aged man in a sky-blue long robe was standing on top, his hands behind his back, currently watching the battle over there from a distance.

“Hehe, what an ignorant little fellow, to actually really want to comprehend time law! Wan Zhen, are you afraid that he will beat you?”

Suddenly, another figure appeared on a treetop not far from the middle-aged man in a blue robe.

This person had a beautiful face. If not for his adam’s apple, probably everyone would think that he was a stunningly beautiful woman.

But his face made many peerless beauties feel ashamed of their unworthiness.

This middle-aged man in a blue robe was actually Cloudaid City’s number one person, Wan Zhen!

Wan Zhen’s face had no joy nor sorrow. His eyes never left Ye Yuan. He just said coolly, “Zhang Lian, you’re thinking too much! If he can really comprehend time law, I’ll be happy for him.”

Zhang Lian!

If somebody was here, they would discover to their surprise that this beautiful man was actually Zhang Lian who was ranked second on the God of War Golden List!

Cloudaid City’s number one person and number two person actually appeared in Longriver Forest at the same time, in order to watch Ye Yuan fight.

Zhang Lian revealed a look of resentment and said with a grin, “You this person, your words don’t match what’s in your heart!”

Wan Zhen had a deep gaze as he said coolly, “Primeval War Realm’s training is nothing more than a game. That’s all! The human race is imperiled. With Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets opening up the Primeval War Realm, it’s in order to let us increase our cultivation as soon as possible, and fight for the human race! At this time, the more the human race’s powerhouses, and the stronger, the happier I naturally am! Can there be unbroken eggs when the nest is totally wrecked? If the divine race is really going to attack Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s side, I’m afraid that the first batch they are going to kill is us, these so-called geniuses!”

Zhang Lian did not think that Wan Zhen would actually say such a thing.

He and Wan Zhen had fought for a hundred years. The two had always found it hard to determine the victor.

It could be said that he was Wan Zhen’s only opponent.

However, his considerations were just inside this Primeval War Realm.

Zhang Lian never thought that Wan Zhen was actually considering the matter of the Doomsday Battle.

He frowned and said, “Is the divine race really so powerful?”

“They will only be more powerful than you imagine! The Heavenspan World’s former overlord, the existence that towered above all life, how could it be a trifling matter?” Wan Zhen said.

Zhang Lian was silent. After a long time, he suddenly opened his mouth and said, “That kid is going to die!”

But Wan Zhen said coolly, “The Battle Xuan Beast King is going to die!”

“Tch, under time law, it’s hard for you and me to escape too, let alone this brat?” Zhang Lian said with a look of disbelief.

Wan Zhen seemed to be very confident in Ye Yuan and said coolly, “He knows time law too!”

An incomparably shocked expression suddenly showed on Zhang Lian’s stunning face and he said, “How is that possible?”

Wan Zhen said indifferently, “Your understanding of him is too little!”

“Immobilize!”

Right then, this word seemed to pierce the void, drawing down the paramount Heavenly Dao.

A powerful and unmatched power of Heavenly Dao suddenly descended in the dense forest.

Feeling the undulation of the power of Heavenly Dao, Zhang Lian’s shock could not be any greater.

It turned out that the time law Wan Zhen was referring to was this!

But very clearly, the power of Heavenly Dao that Heavenly Dao True Word induced was even stronger than the Battle Xuan Beast King’s power of law!

Time suddenly solidified!
