“What’s happening?”

In the crowd, an authoritative voice suddenly sounded out.

Everyone gave a sidelong glance. It was actually Qin Tian!

They were all shocked by Ye Yuan but did not realize that the Qin Tian, who had just completed a grand feat already exited the Sword Tomb who knows when.

When he successfully cleared the 11th level, he knew that the entire academy would be shocked because of it.

However, Qin Tian was already used to this kind of surprise and astonishment long ago.

To a true genius, enjoying these was natural and right.

It was just that after he came out, he discovered that things were not as he expected.

Everyone was indeed in shock, but the way of shock was somewhat different.

Logically speaking, he was everyone’s focal point. When he came out, everyone should immediately react to it, then shout and jump with jubilant cheers, with all kinds of felicitations.

But after he came out, he discovered that not a single person was paying attention to him.

“Ah? It’s Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian! Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian, you look at that guy on the light screen.”

Qin Tian’s brows furrowed, looking towards the light screen rather curiously.

He was very curious about what thing could overshadow the light of him clearing the 11th level.

Qin Tian was not someone who fished for fame. It was just that he was used to the light halo of the main character and used to being marveled at by everyone.

Now, these exclamations were gone, he was not quite used to it, and it was not very ... comfortable.

When Ye Yuan’s figure came into his view, Qin Tian’s gaze suddenly turned intent!

“How long has it been?” Qin Tian said solemnly.

Zhao Qin said cautiously, “Already been an hour! Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian, this ... what to do here?”

“What else can you do? Report to the academy and invite a teacher over! Ye Yuan wrecked the Sword Tomb and should be punished for this crime!” Qin Tian said solemnly.

Zhao Qin gave an ‘ah’ and hurriedly said, “I ... I’ll invite Teacher Fan over right now!”

Finished talking, Zhao Qin took out a talisman and directly transmitted the sudden turn of events here over.

In Wu Meng Academy, any sword in the Sword Tomb could not be pulled out. Otherwise, the consequences would be very severe!

As long as someone pulled out a sword, all of the swords in the entire level would unleash an attack at him.

This attack was on a completely different level from those law fragment attacks!

Even with Qin Tian’s present strength, after pulling out a sword in the first level, it’s also certain death!

In Wu Meng Academy’s history, there were quite a number of people who pulled out a sword in the heat of the moment, but no one was able to survive.

And wanting to succeed in clearing the round, one had to burst past the blockade of a hundred flying swords.

Therefore, that was why Ye Yuan’s actions would arouse such a huge reaction, resulting in everyone throwing the matter of Qin Tian clearing the 11th round to the back of their minds.

If it were someone else, Qin Tian would not be to the extent of being so furious either.

But that person was Ye Yuan, a person already sentenced to death by him.

Before long, Teacher Fan came to the Sword Tomb.

Seeing Ye Yuan on the Light screen, his expression could not help changing, and he said, “How did he do it? Could it be that ... something went wrong with the Sword Tomb’s first level?”

Qin Tian went forward and said, “Teacher Fan, it’s said that this Sword Tomb has already existed for as long as a million years. This kind of abnormality has never appeared before. Currently, Ye Yuan probably ruined the Sword Tomb’s first level’s order with some kind of method. That’s why it would be like this!”

Teacher Fan nodded and said, “What Qin Tian said makes sense. I’ll go in and take a look at the situation first. If he really wrecked the first level’s order, I’ll definitely behead without mercy!”

Finished talking, Teacher Fan turned right around and entered the Sword Tomb’s first level.

“You’re called Ye Yuan? What in the world did you do? To make this first level’s sword all lose control?” Teacher Fan questioned.

However, Ye Yuan seemingly did not hear it at all and was still minding himself and saying things to the sword in his hand.

Just like ... old friends of many years.

Teacher Fan’s face fell, and he gave a cold snort. His figure moved and swept into the Sword Tomb.

However, right at the instant, his body just entered the boundary of the Sword Tomb, all of the first level’s swords emitted a series of light humming!

Hum ...

All of the swords were trembling incessantly, about to pull out of the ground!

In virtually an instant, Teacher Fan’s expression changed drastically. A feeling of immense danger welled up in his heart.

He wanted to retreat, but it was already too late.

Clank, clank ...

All of the swords pulled out of the ground and charged over toward Teacher Fan.

Teacher Fan was an Origin Deity powerhouse, and his strength was formidable. Seeing that he could not withdraw in time, a powerful surge of aura gushed out and welcomed those long swords.

Boom!

An enormous boom, Teacher Fan’s figure retreated out of the sword burial ground’s radius stumblingly.

Repelling Teacher Fan, countless long swords danced in the air for a moment, and then all returned to their original places.

Teacher Fan had a look of alarm. Regarding that scene just now, he still had lingering fear in his heart. His gaze looked toward Ye Yuan, his eyes full of disbelief.

These swords did not lose control!

Just now, if he went in a little deeper, it probably would not be that easy to come out.

But Ye Yuan was seemingly oblivious to the events that happened just now and still mumbled to himself. It was as if he was possessed.

In the lobby, a commotion burst out long ago.

“The first level’s swords did not lose control! Teacher Fan nearly succumbed too!”

“My God, what in the world is going on? How can that kid be safe and sound inside?”

“Why do I feel that those swords are all controlled by that kid?”

“This ... This isn’t possible, right?”

Qin Tian looked at the light screen. His usually expressionless face had a rare display of a startled look.

His feeling was the same as those guys, like ... Ye Yuan controlled all of the swords in the first level!

How in the world did this guy do it?! Qin Tian was incomparably shocked in his heart.

These several hundred years, as long as he had spare time, he would come to the Sword Tomb to comprehend the sword.

However, he had never thought that one could control all of the first level’s swords!

These swords were all left behind by Wu Meng Academy’s predecessors. Among them, some people’s strengths later on were unimaginable.

All of the swords’ power added together was not what an individual’s strength could resist at all.

But Ye Yuan actually controlled all of the swords!

No idea since when, Qin Shao was already among the crowd. He finally understood just what Ye Yuan’s one year of crazed abuse was for.

He was comprehending the sword!

Except, this comprehension ability ... was a little too fearsome, right?

Just as everyone was shocked, Ye Yuan slowly got up, stuck that sword in his hand back in place, and walked out of the Sword Tomb.

Seeing Teacher Fan, Ye Yuan could not help being stupefied and said with a bow, “Disciple Ye Yuan has seen Teacher.”

Teacher Fan’s expression was very odd. Ye Yuan also detected his peculiarity and was somewhat uncertain what it meant.

“Ye Yuan? You ... What in the world did you do just now?” Teacher Fan said with an ugly expression.

Ye Yuan froze when he heard that and said, “Do what? Didn’t teacher saw it too? I was comprehending the sword.”

“Comprehending the sword? Ye Yuan, don’t act dumb anymore! You pulled out a sword just now!” Teacher Fan said unhappily.

“Pulled out a sword? Yeah, I pulled out a sword earlier. Why, could it be that the swords inside the Sword Tomb ... can’t be pulled?” Ye Yuan said with a guileless look. He really did not know.

Teacher Fan could not help choking up and said solemnly, “Those who pull a sword are bound to be attacked by all of the swords. Nobody has been able to survive! But why didn’t these swords attack you?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Maybe ... it’s because I made friends with them?”
