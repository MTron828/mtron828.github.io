Chapter 2413: You All Are Tired Too, Go Back and Rest!

“Where did this impudent person come from, to dare act atrociously in my divine race’s territory!” Yu Qin looked at Ye Yuan and said in rage.

However, he was also extremely surprised in his heart.

When did this human youth before his eyes enter the camp?

With his strength, he actually did not notice it!

“You’re Yu Qin? I’m bringing Nineorigin away. Calling you out is just to inform you,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Facing a lofty mountain-like pressure, it was as if Ye Yuan was completely clueless.

This camp seemed to be like his own backyard.

When had Yu Qin seen before such an arrogant human? After hearing, he could not help saying in a great rage, “A tiny human ant dares to be so impudent in front of this progenitor too? Forget about you. Even if your family’s adults are here, they also won’t dare to say this kind of arrogant words! If you have the ability, try bringing him away!”

The group of Nine-marks powerhouses by the side snickered heavily when they heard that.

“Where did this babe pop out from? He doesn’t know how high the sky is, and how thick the earth is, right?”

“Did he run to the wrong camp and think that this is the human camp?”

“Haha, a Heavenly Emperor Realm little fellow really dares to talk big! If you can take him away, then wouldn’t we become jokes?”

... ...

Although this camp was not the divine race’s top combat strength, their strength was extremely strong too.

Then a human little fellow ran up to them to posture.

This kind of thing, even thinking about it felt funny.

But Ye Yuan ignored everyone ridiculing him. Picking up the Nineorigin who was like mud, he walked slowly out of the camp.

That appearance showed utter disregard for these super powerhouses.

When Yu Qin saw this scene, he could not help flying into a great rage.

When did such a foolish young man emerge in the human race?

“Humph! Since you want to seek death, then this progenitor will fulfill your wish!”

Yu Qin snorted coldly, the imposing aura on his body suddenly erupting.

Although it did not reach the peak, it was more than enough to annihilate a swathe of heavenly emperors.

Only to see him strike a palm over, even space was trembling.

How could the might of a middle-stage Nine-marks be ordinary?

Boom!

The place that Ye Yuan was standing at, space shattered.

His entire person seemed to have been shredded by space, being torn apart into pieces.

“Hahaha ... To dare posture in front of this progenitor, this progenitor was wondering how strong you were! After a farce, it’s just a braggart!” Yu Qin said with a big laugh.

At this time, a Nine-marks powerhouse next to him suddenly said, “L-Lord Yu Qin, you look!”

Yu Qin was taken aback and looked in the direction that he was pointing in, and discovered that Ye Yuan was still carrying Nineorigin, walking outside of the camp.

Ye Yuan was actually completely unscathed!

Then what the hell happened just now?

Yu Qin’s face changed wildly, a look of astonishment on his face, not understanding why this sort of thing would happen.

Just now, he clearly killed Ye Yuan. Why was he still walking out perfectly fine?

Even if he had experienced the vicissitudes of life for a long time, his old face flushed red at this time too.

Just now, he even talked big.

Who knew that in a twinkle, his face was really slapped by Ye Yuan.

And this also made him somewhat angry from embarrassment.

“Humph! To dare play tricks in front of this progenitor, you’ll die very horribly!”

Yu Qin gave an angry yell, his aura bursting forth again.

This time was much more terrifying than just now. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even the divine race powerhouses present, each and every one of their faces changed slightly.

Boom!

Yu Qin struck a palm over again. The void shattered and debris flew everywhere.

Ye Yuan was killed once again!

This time, Yu Qin learned to be smart, he did not mock Ye Yuan for overestimating his own ability right away.

Only after several breaths seeing that Ye Yuan did not appear, he laughed coldly and said: “Humph! Got some skill! But, provoking this progenitor to my face is the biggest mistake that you’ve made!”

However, his voice had yet to fade when the void trembled slightly. Ye Yuan’s and Nineorigin’s figures appeared again.

This time, Ye Yuan had walked even further and was about to walk out of the boundary of the camp soon.

Yu Qin’s smile instantly turned stiff on his face, only to feel his face burn hotly.

He already used 70% strength just now. Even ordinary Deva Third Blights would have been smacked to death by his one slap too!

Hence, that was why he was confident that Ye Yuan was already dead until he could not be any more dead.

But who knew that Ye Yuan really did not die.

Originally, it was Ye Yuan posturing.

But now, it became Ye Yuan posturing and having Yu Qin’s face slapped.

A dignified peak middle-stage Nine-marks powerhouse actually could not deal with a measly little Heavenly Emperor Realm! It was simply unprecedented humiliation!

“Still in a daze for what? Everyone, attack together! This progenitor wants to see if he really has three heads and six arms!”

Ignoring the humiliation, Yu Qin was also no longer conceited, directly ordering everyone to attack together.

If he let Ye Yuan walk out in a grand manner today, where would his face go?

Where would the divine race’s face go?

At this point, how could everyone still not tell that there was something fishy going on with this human kid?

Several dozen Nine-marks powerhouses could not be bothered to care about anything else, rushing in like a swarm of hornets one after another.

This kind of horrifying line-up, even if a bunch of human Deva Realms was here, they would be bombarded into dregs too.

Only to see one terrifying energy undulation after another, crazily smashing over towards the place where Ye Yuan was standing.

That place had long already been bombed into ruins.

More than half of the entire camp was had already been destroyed!

Under this kind of concentrated attacks, they believed that even if Ye Yuan had three heads and six arms, he would have died utterly too.

“Stop!”

No idea how long they bombarded either before Yu Qin did a hand gesture, making everyone stop.

That place already became a black hole.

Spatial storm poured out of the black hole continuously, attempting to engulf everything.

“Got to be dead this time, right?”

“Have to be! Who can block so many of us joining forces?”

“This kid has some skill, but he’s too arrogant, to dare be unbridled in the camp!”

... ...

The group of Nine-marks powerhouses searched for a long time and discovered that they completely could not see Ye Yuan’s figure. Only then did they confirm that Ye Yuan was already dead.

As for Nineorigin’s life or death, they did not pay attention to it anymore.

To these Nine-marks big shots, Nineorigin was merely a minor character.

However, Yu Qin’s face still did not relax.

The previous failures made him somewhat lacking in confidence.

He could not tell until now, just what method Ye Yuan used to avoid his attacks.

At this time now, he was very scared of Ye Yuan jumping out again, carrying Nineorigin and walking outside.

However, whatever one feared would come.

The void trembled, two figures walked out of the void. Who were they if not Ye Yuan and Nineorigin?

It was just that at this time, Ye Yuan already arrived outside of the camp.

He looked back at Yu Qin and said coolly, “Busying about for the greater half of the day, you all are tired too, go back and rest! I’ll be bringing Nineorigin away.”

In Ye Yuan’s hand, Nineorigin’s eyes had a dead gray color.

Only at this very moment did he know how terrifying Ye Yuan’s strength was.

Indeed, Ye Yuan was not Yu Qin’s match in a head-on confrontation.

But, just based on Yu Qin’s strength, he could not kill Ye Yuan at all!

It was not just Yu Qin. Even if these Nine-marks powerhouses joined forces, they could not do anything to Ye Yuan either.

Just now, he was brought to a mysterious place by Ye Yuan.

That place seemed to not have the definition of time and space.

They evaded the frenzied attacks of Yu Qin and the rest there.
