Chapter 2474: A Feeling Called Despair!

“This … Then with the current situation, isn’t it that we can only wait for death?” Ancestor Fire’s expression changed slightly as he said.

Lin Chaotian said, “Not necessarily! No matter how great his talent is, wanting to take this last step is also not an easy thing! Our strengths have made considerable improvements during these few years. If he really wants to deal with the few of us, I’m afraid that it’s not enough yet! Therefore, what we have to do now is to strengthen ourselves!”

The group of Dao Ancestors had dispirited faces. They, as Dao Ancestors, roamed the world unhindered.

Now, they were actually forced into such a situation by someone!

But the nine people did not dare to slacken their efforts. In the remaining days, they comprehended Heavenly Dao desperately, strengthening themselves.

… …

Four years later, on one fine day, heaven and earth suddenly changed.

The wind swept the clouds away. The mountains cried out and the sea howled, lightning flashed and thunder clapped.

It was as if the end of the world had arrived for the Heavenspan World.

The powerhouses were all extremely terrified.

This kind of heavenly might, they had never experienced it before.

On Heavenspan Mountain, one silhouette after another flew out.

They were kicked out by the Heavenspan Mountain!

“What happened? Why did the Heavenspan Mountain not allow cultivation anymore?”

“Heavenly Dao Samsara! This must be Heavenly Dao Samsara! I didn’t expect that it would arrive so quickly!”

“This … What to do about it? Once Heavenly Dao Samsara begins, the power of rule on Dao Ancestors will be taken back by Heavenly Dao. What can we do to resist the divine race?”

On Heavenspan Mountain, spiritual energy was vast and mighty.

But a powerful force blocked everyone out.

Currently, Heavenspan Mountain already became a forbidden land. There were people being thrown out continuously.

Those who were thrown out in the beginning were all some weaklings.

Following that, those who were thrown out got stronger and stronger.

Until the back, there were even quite a number of Deva Realm powerhouses who were squeezed out of Heavenspan Mountain against their will.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Several more figures were thrown out of Heavenspan Mountain one after another.

The moment these people appeared, it immediately caused a stir.

“It’s the nine great Dao Ancestors! They were forced out too!”

“Their auras are a bit chaotic. Could it be that their power of rule has already been taken back?”

“But it feels like their aura doesn’t seem to have been affected much!”

“Heh, don’t you all know that they took away that precious treasure from Saint Azure? I reckon that this time, they gained a big advantage! In terms of shamelessness, I concede to the few of them!”

… …

Seeing the Dao Ancestors appeared, it did not arouse the respect of the strong, but rather, a large wave of scornful voices.

That day when Ye Yuan mobilized the aura of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, the world already knew the truth long ago.

The nine great Dao Ancestors borrowed the name of humanity’s righteous cause to do filthy things and forced Saint Azure away.

This matter was despised by the world!

Azure Saint exhausted his mind and body for the human race until his heart ceased to beat.

In the end, what he got was actually such a treatment. The people were indignant at the unfairness!

Saint Azure fought on the frontline, but these Dao Ancestors stabbed him in the back.

This way of doing things ruined their favorable impression.

If not for their strength being too strong, they would probably have been swarmed to death by people.

Boom!

Suddenly, the power of flames burst forth, dyeing half the sky red.

A group of powerhouses directly turned to scattering ashes!

“Whoever keeps being noisy, this is the outcome!” Ancestor Fire said with a cold gaze.

How could they not hear these people’s comments?

Ancestor Fire’s fuse was the shortest. He actually directly went on a killing spree!

The moment he raged, sure enough, no one dared to speak anymore.

Except, those powerhouses were all indignant at the unfairness, glaring angrily.

Dared to be angry but did not dare to speak!

When dealing with the divine race, they did not see these few Dao Ancestors showing their faces.

But when dealing with their own people, they killed readily!

With a wave of a hand, there were probably thousands of powerhouses that fell!

It could be seen that in the eyes of the few great Dao Ancestors, they were merely a bunch of ants.

Lin Chaotian furrowed his brows, but in the end, he did not speak.

Just earlier, Heavenly Dao took back the power of rules.

The nine of them were already no longer Dao Ancestors now!

But, because of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, the nine of their strength did not weaken by a lot.

During these ten years, the nine of them made great progress, especially in terms of cultivation methods. They remolded their cultivation methods and greatly improved their strength.

At present, they had practically already reached the limit that human beings could attain!

Apart from being unable to break the shackles!

Therefore, even though Heavenly Dao was transmigrating, their strength did not decline too much.

“Hahaha

?… These Dao Ancestors are really amazing! Attacking their own people, they actually didn’t show any mercy!” Right at this time, a burst of hearty laughter reverberated throughout heaven and earth.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

One figure after another stepped out of the sky, each one having an extremely powerful aura.

The expressions of the human powerhouses changed wildly. These powerful auras crushed them until they were virtually unable to breathe.

“Divine race! It’s the divine race!”

“W-What powerful auras! C-Could it be that they are the legendary progenitors?”

“Really so strong! Is it possible that humanity’s doomsday is arriving?”

… …

These powerhouses that came were precisely members of the divine race!

And the one talking was Tian Qing!

The expressions of the human powerhouses changed one after another. They were shocked by the progenitors’ powerful auras.

This was a peerlessly domineering aura. Tian Qing’s might made people unable to look him in the eye.

The eight great progenitors’ auras virtually covered the entire horizon.

When they appeared, it astounded the entire era!

Lin Chaotian’s expression was solemn as he said in a deep voice, “Being disrespectful to Dao Ancestors, don’t they deserve to die?”

Tian Qing laughed loudly and said, “Don’t give me that! You don’t think that this progenitor doesn’t know about the Heavenspan World’s affairs because I’m in the Abyss World, right??Huhu,?this progenitor is very grateful to you all, for driving Ye Yuan away!”

Lin Chaotian’s face turned black. This guy was really skilled with words!

Rubbing their noses in it!

Lin Chaotian said in a cold voice, “Why? Does Progenitor Tian Qing think that with the few of us having the power of Heavenly Dao taken back, you’ll be able to take advantage of people??Huhu,?since that’s the case, bring it on!”

But Tian Qing did not have the intention of taking action. He still had a beam on his face as he said, “This progenitor knows that you all obtained a precious treasure from Ye Yuan there! However, you all didn’t seem to have broken the shackles! What a pity, what a pity! Do you all think that having obtained a precious treasure, you’ll be able to stop this progenitor?”

Lin Chaotian said in a deep voice, “Although this ancestor didn’t break the shackles, but … I don’t fear you either!”

Tian Qing was calm and composed, and said with his hands behind his back, “Is that so??Hoho,?Little Li, show yourself and let them take a look at our divine race’s true strength!”

The moment his voice faded, a beautiful figure stepped out of the sky.

That beautiful figure was beautiful until she could topple kingdoms, and that the moon hid its face and flowers blushed in shame!

Who could it be if not Yue Mengli?

It was just that the current Yue Mengli was different again from that time when Ye Yuan saw her!

Her aura was actually not the slightest bit weaker when compared to Tian Qing!

One had to know, among the eight great progenitors, Tian Qing’s aura could be said to outshine the others, overwhelming everyone.

Now, Yue Mengli’s aura was actually not weaker than Tian Qing!

Lin Chaotian’s expression changed wildly, a look of shock on his face.

A feeling called despair spread in everyone’s heart!
