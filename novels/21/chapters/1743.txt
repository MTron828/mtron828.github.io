Chapter 1747 Acted Too Realistically

“52! Surpassed! Surpassed!”

“53!”

...

At the back, each time Ye Yuan fused a type of wood, everyone counted along in unison.

Very soon, Ye Yuan surpassed Mu Yuanchun’s 51 types.

But it was not over!

“98!”

“99!”

“100!”

“Really amazing! This guy was pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger, right?”

“My face was slapped so freaking swollen!”

“This guy definitely did it on purpose just now!”

“You look at him, still looking dissatisfied about it. This … This is too infuriating!”

...

Back then, when Ye Yuan fused the last type of wood, the field immediately burst into an uproar.

No one could have thought that Ye Yuan actually fused all of the 100 types of wood!

Extremely few people were able to complete this in the priest examination.

Those able to complete it were at least geniuses that appeared once every 100 thousand years!

If say Ye Yuan did not do it on purpose before, they would not believe even if beaten to death.

Ye Yuan was indeed not satisfied yet. He got the hang of it more and more toward the back and already could not stop.

100 types of wood were not his limit yet.

Kong Lin looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold snort, “Is pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger very interesting?”

Mu Yuanchun also spoke up, “Strength is clearly uncommon, yet want to feign an appearance of not knowing anything, toying with everyone’s feelings! Malicious motives!”

The moment these two people spoke up, the others also concurred with it, clearly very unhappy with Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan said with a helpless look, “Regardless whether you all believe or not, it’s really my first time using the demonic attraction art!”

Kong Lin sneered and said, “First time? Do you still take us to be fools? Fusing 100 types of wood, in the history of our Tyrant Origin Imperial City’s Priest Temple, there’s merely only two able to accomplish it. You’re telling me that it’s your first time using the demonic attraction art?”

Mu Yuanchun gave a cold snort and said to the three elders, “Three elders, this person’s strength is clearly uncommon, yet pretend that he doesn’t know anything! In my view, he’s intentionally here to humiliate the temple!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was tickled and said with a smile, “Hey, you’re retarded, right? I, a Fourth Firmament Divine Lord, specially came to Tyrant Origin Imperial City from afar to deliver myself to death? If you’re retarded, don’t simply think that others are as retarded as you, alright?”

Mu Yuanchun’s face fell and he said with a cold snort, “Who knows what plan you have in mind. Either way, you don’t have good intentions!”

At this time, Stonefeather said coolly, “Alright, since you’ve already taken part in the priest examination, then follow the rules. Ye Yuan already passed the second round, so carry out the third round.”

The third round was genuinely refining demon divine pills.

Stonefeather speaking up, even though Kong Lin and the rest were unhappy, they did not dare have the slightest bit of defiance.

Kong Lin’s expression was very ugly as he said, “The third round, pill refinement. The demon divine pill tested this time is the Darkcloud Profound Spring Pill, middle-grade as pass!”

Finished announcing, the remaining examinees were all preparing to refine the pill. Ye Yuan suddenly cupped his fists at Stonefeather and said, “Elder, this … can I take a look at the pill formula?”

The demon race’s pill formulas, Ye Yuan had heard before some names, but really did not have pill formulas.

Demon divine pills were an independent pill refining system. Immortal Grove could not refine at all, he naturally would not go and deliberately go collect pill formulas too.

The moment Kong Lin heard, he smiled coldly and said, “What the Priest Temple tests are all pill formulas made open to the public. You could use the demonic attraction art to such an extent. So how could you not even know the Darkcloud Profound Spring Pill’s pill formula?”

The words that Ye Yuan said right now, they did not believe it at all.

Clearly ridiculously impressive, and yet want to pretend to not know anything, was it very fun?

Feigning ignorance previously, forget it. But now, everyone already knew and you were still pretending!

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “But I really don’t know!”

“Let him take a look. However, the assessment time is only six hours. You have to grasp it well.” Stonefeather said coolly.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was overjoyed and said with clasped hands, “Many thanks, Elder.”

Pretending!

Look at you pretending!

What’s with Elder today?

This punk is clearly feigning ignorance, yet, Elder still want to play along with him!

Helplessly, Kong Lin could only hand the pill formula over to Ye Yuan.

The Darkcloud Profound Spring Pill was an initial-stage rank four demon divine pill. To talk about the difficulty, it was roughly level two.

One should not judge at how level two difficulty was not high. Using it as an entry-level examination, the difficulty was pretty high.

In the human race, as long as one stepped into Divine Lord Realm and could refine the simplest rank four divine pill, they would be considered Four-star Alchemy Gods.

But in the Priest Temple, this threshold clearly would not cut it.

To a novice, wanting to refine a level two difficulty rank four demon divine pill as soon as they came up, it was virtually a task that was impossible to complete.

Forget about a novice, even for these demons participating in the assessment, it was absolutely not an easy thing too.

Moreover, the lowest requirement to pass the test was even middle-grade!

Just this requirement barred the vast majority of people outside the front door of the Priest Temple.

Ye Yuan took the pill formula, akin to obtaining a priceless treasure, and started studying it.

He deduced the pill formula as he observed the others refining pills, an appearance as if absorbed in thought.

Level two difficulty rank four demon divine pill, the difficulty was not too high to him. Deducing it was also not considered too troublesome.

But the demon divine pill was indeed a brand new domain to Ye Yuan.

When Kong Lin saw Ye Yuan’s intoxicated appearance, he had a strange expression on his face.

He seriously could not resist anymore and grumbled to Stonefeather, “Master, this kid can act too well. Why do you keep on helping him?”

Stonefeather gave him a glance and said with a smile, “Act? Hur hur, then his acting is too realistic!”

Kong Lin’s expression changed and he said, “Master’s meaning is that it’s really his first time coming into contact with demon divine pills? How is this possible? First time using the demonic attraction art and he fused 100 types of wood, is there really someone capable of accomplishing this kind of thing?”

Stonefeather smiled and said, “Before today, this old man didn’t believe either. But now, this old man saw it with my own eyes. I have no choice but to believe it! This child’s Alchemy Dao talent is truly terrifying!”

Kong Lin’s pupils constricted slightly, his eyes revealing immense shock.

He was seriously unable to imagine what kind of talent could fuse 100 types of wood the first time using the demonic attraction art.

This was simply inconceivable.

In a twinkle, more than four hours passed.

Mu Yuanchun’s medicinal pills were finally refined successfully!

Suddenly, he felt a scorching gaze. Lifting his head and looking over, he discovered that Ye Yuan was currently staring straight at him.

Looking again, Ye Yuan actually had not started refining the pill yet!

Mu Yuanchun was first stunned, then immediately smiled coldly and said, “You watched me refine the pill until now?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan smiled and said with a nod, “Your strength is decent, but the process of refining pills missed out too much. Basic skills are also not too solid. What a pity.”

He watched all the way until now. This review was also from the bottom of his heart and did not have the intention of mocking.

The moment Mu Yuanchun heard, his expression could not help turning sullen and he said with a cold smile, “If you have the time to review me, better to hurry up and start refining the pill! Heh, less than two hours is remaining, I want to see how you pass the test!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand dismissively and said with a smile, “One hour is enough. No rush, no rush.”
