Chapter 1498 Iron Wire True Fiend Punch

Ka Xin pointed at the cheering crowd and said proudly, “Do you think that only you can jump realms to battle? Listen to their cheers. This is what I exchanged for using one victory after another!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “I know, 800 over matches of consecutive wins. It’s no big deal. In the past, nobody ended your winning streak. But it doesn’t mean that right now, there isn’t.”

A mere 800 over matches of consecutive wins were nothing in Ye Yuan’s eyes.

Back then, he won several thousand matches in a row in Cloudmarsh City, seeking but one defeat and not getting it.

That was the feeling of seeking defeat amidst loneliness.

The things that Ka Xin had felt before, he felt before. The things that Ka Xin never felt before, he had similarly felt before.

He acknowledged that Ka Xin was a powerful opponent, but he was even more confident in himself!

However, Ye Yuan’s words immediately caused a mighty uproar.

“What did he say? Over 800 matches of consecutive wins is nothing? Huhu, what a riot!”

“He’s talking big to impress people here! Ignorant fool, when he witnesses the King of Blood Battle’s terrifying strength, he’ll know what over 800 matches mean!”

“Shameless boasting! A pretty boy like him will be dead in less than three days going onto the Blood Battle Stage.”

“He actually dares to insult my idol! A mere high-rank Fiend General, truly unbelievably arrogant!”

...

Ye Yuan’s words had another feeling when others heard them.

Overestimating your own ability, ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth. In general, it was what these people thought of Ye Yuan.

Ka Xin was the undefeated god of war in their hearts, so how could he possibly lose to such an unusual fellow?

Ka Xin laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Haha, perhaps there’s someone capable of ending my winning streak, but that person definitely isn’t you. Regarding your action of seeking death, I admire it very much!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Whether or not it’s seeking death, you’ll know right away.”

Seeing the gunpowder smell gradually became thicker, the referee spoke up in a timely manner, “Since both of you parties have agreed upon life-and-death, this battle isn’t limited to any means. As long as you can kill your opponent, it will do. Now, the battle begins!”

Finished talking, the referee withdrew from the main ring. The protective grand array activated. A wave of fanaticism was set off on the grandstands once more.

“Attack, King of Blood Battle! Kill that pretty boy!”

“Your Highness Ka Xin, let us have a taste of the style of the King of Blood Battle again!”

“Kill, kill, kill! Beat him into scraps!”

...

The cheering sounds were louder one wave after another.

The entire Blood Battle Stage was virtually supporting Ka Xin one-sidedly.

As for Ye Yuan, probably only the Fan Family would cheer him on.

“Heh heh, nobody has dared to challenge me for 200 years! Got to admit, you’re very courageous. In order to reward your courage, I’ll blast you until not even residue remains!”

Ka Xin laughed ferociously, the aura on his entire body suddenly changed.

That image of an elegant and poised prince was immediately gone.

What was standing on the ring right now was a vicious wolf, full of a dangerous aura from top to bottom.

Fiendish energy surged on Ka Xin’s body. On a pair of divine artifact gloves, two black-colored virtual images of a fist condensed and formed.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, the fiendish energy within his body also secretly revolved, taking precautions.

Bloodeagle’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “The moment he came up and it’s the Iron Wire True Fiend Punch? That boy is in danger! Back then, when he was still only initial-rank Fiend General, he used this move and unleashed 300 punches in a row, forcefully smashing a middle-rank Fiend General into minced meat! From start to end, that middle-rank Fiend General never made a single move! And that middle-rank Fiend General already won 86 matches in a row at that time!”

Regarding Ka Xin’s past, Bloodeagle could speak on it with great familiarity.

To be able to make the Blood Battle Stage’s hall master pay such attention, Ka Xin’s prowess back then could be seen at a glance.

You Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said, “Looks like he’s going to compete in speed with Source Night! Ka Xin this lad is still so domineering! Wonder whether or not Source Night this brat can block or not.”

You Ming naturally knew that Ye Yuan’s sword art was adept at speed.

Ka Xin’s move was going to compete in Ye Yuan’s strength with him!

Weren’t you fast?

I’ll use speed to beat you!

“Mn? This stance ... it’s the Iron Wire True Fiend Punch! Haha, truly a move that hasn’t been seen for a long time!”

“His Highness Ka Xin did a big move the moment he came up! This punk is pitiable!”

“Back then, the Da Meng who was known as the ‘Iron Butcher’ was forcefully bombarded to death by His Highness Ka Xin and didn’t even make a single move! Let us guess how many punches this kid can block? Hahaha!”

...

The moment these words came out, everyone started guessing one after another.

Some said three punches, some said ten punches, some said one punch.

All in all, no one was optimistic about Ye Yuan at all.

Swoosh!

Right then, Ka Xin moved!

From silence to moving, it was extremely sudden.

Even if everyone was prepared, they also felt that their reaction was somewhat lagging behind.

At virtually the same time, Ye Yuan moved too!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Right after, a series of detonating sounds transmitted over.

The vast majority of the people on the grandstands could not see the two people’s fight at all. They only saw the black fist images filling the air everywhere.

Those were the fist images of the Iron Wire True Fiend Punch!

However, they could not see Ye Yuan draw his sword at all!

Very clearly, Ye Yuan was being completely suppressed.

Those dense fist images made people practically about to suffocate.

Separated by the protective grand array, they could feel that horrifying laws undulation.

“So strong! This is the strength of the King of Blood Battle!”

“His Highness Ka Xin’s present strength completely can’t be mentioned in the same breath as back then!”

“Speed, strength, power of laws, all have gone up several steps! I feel that his strength is also not much worse compared to initial-rank Fiend Commanders, right?”

...

The people forgot to cheer for a moment. It was exclamations everywhere on the stands.

Under the fist images, Ye Yuan appeared very flustered.

Ever since comprehending Chasing Moon to grand completion, there were virtually not many people capable of keeping up with his speed.

But after Ka Xin’s Iron Wire True Fiend Punch was unleashed, it was like a motor that never rests, unable to stop at all!

Over a dozen breaths of time, Ka Xin already unleashed several hundred punches, each punch faster than the last!

Ye Yuan had just dodged a punch and the next punch arrived with a howl.

He did not have time to draw his sword at all. Just a fraction slower and he would be swept by the fist winds.

Currently, Ye Yuan’s vital energy and blood were erratic. Although he barely managed to dodge these hundreds of punches, the undulations of power of laws suffused everywhere in the air still caused considerable damage to him.

Ka Xin’s might was somewhat out of expectations!

“No, wait, he’s building up fist momentum! Can’t drag on like this with him anymore! His realm far surpasses mine, his explosive power is much stronger than mine!”

If it were others, such high intensity moves, the fist momentum should get weaker and weaker.

But Ka Xin’s fist was clearly one punch stronger than the other.

His fist winds already gradually caught up with Ye Yuan’s movement technique.

At this rate, Ye Yuan would lose without a doubt!

“Sundering Stars!”

Ye Yuan did not even turn his head back, the Evil Extermination Sword chopping out like lightning.

Boom!

Two power of laws collided together vigorously at close range.

Ye Yuan spurted fresh blood wildly, figure slamming onto the protective grand array like a straight line. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

While Ka Xin’s Iron Wire True Fiend Punch finally stopped because of this chopping move.
