Chapter 2660: Still Want It?

Ironcore stretched out his hand, having an expression that it was natural and right.

Cui Tong hurriedly said, “Brother Ironcore, this Emerald Sea Divine Conch was guaranteed by Ye Yuan to the dragon son with an origin divinity contract that he’ll return it. That’s why the seafolk would return to the coastline! If he doesn’t return it, Ye Yuan will die from Heavenly Dao’s backlash!”

Ironcore said indifferently, “Exchanging a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum for a grandmist treasure, this is a great bargain! Brat, hurry up and hand it over. Don’t force this city lord to make a move! Sacrificing you alone to bolster the Land of Heavenly South, your sacrifice is very meaningful!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Cui Tong was dumbfounded when he heard it, this Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum was not an ordinary Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

His significance was even greater than a grandmist treasure!

“Brother Ironcore …”

“No need to say anymore, this city lord’s mind is made up.”

Cui Tong still wanted to explain more but was directly cut off by Ironcore.

He looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Boy, I give you three breaths of time. Hand over the Emerald Sea Divine Conch. Otherwise, this city lord is going to make a move.”

“No need, you can directly make a move.”

Ye Yuan was directly amused from extreme anger. This guy’s brazenness was really to the extreme level!

He stabilized the situation of the sea war with his power alone.

This guy was good, wanting his life and the Emerald Sea Divine Conch the moment he came.

Very good, very powerful!

Ironcore’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Boy, looks like you’re refusing a toast only to drink to a forfeit!”

“Drink your bloody head! Just the likes of you also want my Emerald Sea Divine Conch! See if I don’t take care of you! Big Brother, return the Emerald Sea Divine Conch to me, I want to teach him a lesson!”

Before Ye Yuan said anything, Little Dragon Girl lost it first.

Little Dragon Girl was young, but it did not mean that she did not understand anything.

Ye Yuan taking the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, it was just to return it.

But this deplorable guy wanted to take it for himself.

If he really prevailed, she would probably have to die here too.

Ye Yuan just smiled slightly and handed the Emerald Sea Divine Conch to her.

He only took the Emerald Sea Divine Conch in through that trace of mysterious sensation just now. He did not know the method of usage at all.

But Little Dragon Girl was different.

After Little Dragon Girl got the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, she did not talk nonsense either, directly deploying it.

A terrifying pressure descended once more!

A huge wave gushed out of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, directly crushing over toward Ironcore.

Ironcore’s entire being was stunned. Before he had time to react, Little Dragon Girl had already taken action.

Seeing the enormous wave smash over, Ironcore only felt his hair stand on end.

However, he was, at any rate, a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven super powerhouse, it was naturally impossible to be taken down just like that.

It was only to see him give a cold snort and suddenly smash a fist over.

Boom!

The terrifying fist force directly collided together with the enormous wave, emitting a violent explosion sound.

But Ironcore’s entire person was directly smashed flying out.

“Emerald Sea Tide, Endless Water Dragons!”

Little Dragon Girl gave a light cry. The water level of the entire Calm South City practically rose several meters in an instant.

Several dozen water dragons rose from the water!

Everyone only saw that several dozen water dragons were dancing wildly in the air; utterly terrifying.

The water dragons gave no chance for explanations, each and every one baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, rushing over toward Ironcore.

Each of these water dragons actually possessed the strength of a Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum!

From this point of view, when Little Dragon Girl was fighting with Ye Yuan previously, she probably did not even display one percent of her means.

Fortunately, his bloodline power was even purer than Little Dragon Girl’s. That was how he collected the Emerald Sea Divine Conch.

Otherwise, he would really be in an embarrassing situation.

Each and every one of the powerhouses present was dumbstruck with amazement.

They all knew that a grandmist treasure was powerful, but did not expect that it was actually this formidable!

A Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum lass could actually summon dozens of Jade Sovereign Heaven level water dragons.

She alone was equivalent to a large army!

However, Ye Yuan knew that actually they had misunderstood.

Ordinary people could not unleash the true power of Emerald Sea Tide at all.

Little Dragon Girl’s dragon race bloodline was extremely pure. The Emerald Sea Divine Conch was her lifeblood treasure. That was how she could unleash its power to the maximum degree.

It was also no wonder that she dared to run out alone.

With this Emerald Sea Divine Conch, this little girl was practically established in an undefeatable position.

It was just that probably even Little Dragon Girl herself did not expect to actually run into a freak like Ye Yuan, whose dragon race bloodline was even purer than her.

“Dripping Water Penetrating Stone!”

“Myriad Arrows Simultaneous Release!”

“Dragon Prancing the Four Seas!”

… …

Under Little Dragon Girl’s control, the dozens of water dragons bombarded Ironcore frenziedly, virtually without resting in the least bit.

However, Ironcore was well-deserving of being Heavenly South City’s deputy city lord too, his strength was incomparably fearsome.

Although he only had the ability to parry, he barely managed to hold on.

But Little Dragon Girl’s complexion started turning a little pale.

Her cultivation realm was too low after all, how could she withstand such a huge consumption?

“Big Brother, I almost can’t hold on anymore! Hurry up and lend me a bit of your true dragon power!” Little Dragon Girl said anxiously.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and pressed his palm on Little Dragon Girl’s back.

Boom!

Little Dragon Girl’s tender face turned red all at once.

That surging and pure true dragon power was akin to tidewater, making her empty dragon power become incomparably plentiful all of a sudden.

Boom!

Outside, those water dragons seemed to have received the summons, their stature suddenly increasing several times, their strength also greatly increasing!

Ironcore was originally still being pleased with himself, planning on draining Little Dragon Girl.

How could he know, this sudden change caught him by surprise.

He only felt a tremendous force transmit over. Those water dragons breached his defenses unreasonably.

One terrifying surge of force after another bombarded against his body.

Ironcore spurted fresh blood wildly, only having the ability to parry and no more power to fight back.

“Hahaha,?amazing! Big Brother, you’re really amazing! I’ve never felt such a powerful strength before!”

Little Dragon Girl laughed like a silver bell tinkling, appearing very happy.

While the powerhouses present were stunned.

“This … What’s going on here? Why would Master Ye have such powerful true dragon power?”

“I heard that Little Dragon Girl’s dragon blood is the purest in the Thistle South Sea Region! But it looks like Master Ye is a lot stronger than her!”

“Freak! Really a freak! A grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven and a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven actually finished Deputy City Lord off!”

… …

A grandmist treasure was indeed a powerful treasure. It could greatly enhance a martial artist’s strength.

But this kind of increment was also too terrifying.

Two small fries together actually finished off a giant dragon.

This conclusion, anyone would be shocked by it.

“Hehe,?do you still want the Emerald Sea Divine Conch?”

“Still want it?”

“Mn??Still want it or not!”

… …

Ye Yuan’s dragon power was not powerful, but it was pure!

Incomparably pure!

Little Dragon Girl pummeled Ironcore onto the ground now, rubbing him on the ground over and over again.

“Don’t want! I don’t want it anymore! Really don’t want anymore! My grandaunt, quickly stop!” Ironcore wailed.

He was currently covered in injuries. Continuing to fight like this, even if he was made out of iron, he would be pummeled to death too.

If not for his cultivation realm being much higher than Ye Yuan two people, he would have long died several times over.

But, at this point, he had no other choice but to beg for mercy.
