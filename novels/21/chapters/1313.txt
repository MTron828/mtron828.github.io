Chapter 1317: Land of Evil Spirits

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“En, Heaven rewards the faithful. I finally recovered!”

Ye Yuan did not hide anything either, directly admitting it.

This kind of thing, wanting to conceal it could not be done either. It was clear at a glance.

But to Su Linpu, this sentence was undoubtedly a bolt out of the blue. It was too astonishing.

He was a One-star Alchemy God too, and he was completely aware of how difficult to refine the one-star Heavenly Mark Pill was.

To a One-star Alchemy God, this was virtually an impossible task.

He grabbed hold of Ye Yuan and lowered his voice and said, “You ... You really refined a one-star Heavenly Mark Pill?”

Refining the one-star Heavenly Mark Pill, that was a heavyweight bomb, much more explosive than divine-grade Detoxification Pill, this thing.

More importantly, the pill formula of the one-star Heavenly Mark Pill, was not what everyone could know.

For Ye Yuan to be able to refine it, showed that his background was definitely not simple!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Didn’t you see it? Without the one-star Heavenly Mark Pill, I can’t possibly repair my divine sea either.”

“Hiss ...”

Su Linpu sucked in a cold breath and looked at Ye Yuan with an expression like he had seen a ghost and said, “You, kid, are really a freak! But, the timing you came out is too perfect. Still don’t come out, this old man really almost can’t hold on anymore!”

Ye Yuan said with a puzzled look, “Where did this come from?

Su Linpu said, “You aren’t aware how popular those medicinal pills that you refined were in Jewelhill City ...”

Su Linpu briefly recounted the situation these few years. Ye Yuan was also slightly surprised when he heard it.

He did not expect that the medicinal pills he refined were actually so sought after.

Ye Yuan did not shirk either and directly said, “Since that’s the case, I’ll find time to refine a batch of medicinal pills. I don’t dare to say about Tier 1 middle-grade divine pills, but ordinary low-grade divine pills shouldn’t be an issue.”

Su Linpu was overjoyed and said, “Heh, knew that you, kid, won’t shirk! Then this matter will be entrusted to you!”

Ye Yuan was aware that he owed the Myriad Treasure Tower a favor. After all, without the Myriad Treasure Tower supplying spirit medicines endlessly, he also had no way of refining the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill in ten year’s time.

But actually, the profits that Ye Yuan brought to the Myriad Treasure Tower was far from as simple as those medicinal pills which he left behind. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In these ten years, the Myriad Treasure Tower could be said to have limitless glory, crushing the other three families until they could not even raise their heads.

In this, Ye Yuan had the absolute contribution.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “There are quite a new ready-made divine pills inside the practice room. You can send people to go and tidy it up a bit. I took away all of the divine-grade divine pills. If you all need them, I can help you all refine. Additionally, you make an inventory list and send the spirit medicines to the cultivation room. I’ll go take a look at Miss Wanru first.”

Su Linpu hurriedly said, “That is, of course! These few years, Miss Wanru has missed you dearly!”

Ye Yuan smiled and suddenly asked, “Manager Su, are there places of evil spirits near Jewelhill City?”

Su Linpu’s expression changed and he said, “What are you finding lands of evil spirits for? Lands of evil spirits aren’t some good place!”

Dustless told Ye Yuan that apart from the cities in the Heavenspan World, there were all kinds of evil spirit places.

The so-called land of evil spirits were places where those martial artists who had abnormal deaths, their divine souls converting to death spirits, and gathering in places where Yin energy was entrenched, forming a land of danger.

The evil spirits of evil spirit lands killed and devoured each other to strengthen themselves. Those able to survive were mostly powerful.

Ordinary martial artists, fighting solo was not a match for the evil spirits at all.

Furthermore, the divine souls of martial artists was excellent nourishment to those evil spirits.

Once they discovered that there were martial artists who entered the land of evil spirits, they would unleash attacks frenziedly, all the way until devouring the martial artist’s divine soul in the end.

But the evil spirit lands would also give birth to some Yin-attribute natural treasure. Furthermore, each kind was very valuable. Therefore, quite a number of martial artists would brave the dangers and enter inside to search for treasures.

Those with good luck could really make a fortune and even maintain several decades, up to a hundred years of cultivation.

Hence, the moment Su Linpu heard that Ye Yuan wanted to find a land of evil spirits, his expression changed immediately.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Ye wants to refine a kind of medicinal pill and needs to use Night Twill Grass, so I want to make a trip to a land of evil spirits.”

The matter of possessing the Soul Suppressing Pearl, this kind of empyrean spirit treasure, Ye Yuan naturally would not disclose it. Hence, he made up a reason.

Him going to a land of evil spirits was naturally not really in order to refine some medicinal pill but to search for nourishment for Dustless.

The evil spirits of the land of evil spirits were the best nourishment to Dustless.

At present, there were only three months left from the ten-year period. Ye Yuan already could not afford to delay.

If he still did not find nourishment for Dustless, Mu Lingxue would not be able to hold on.

Hence, no matter what, this trip to the land of evil spirits, he had to go.

But the moment Su Linpu heard, he could not really stop him. The Myriad Treasure Tower really did not have the Night Twill Grass!

The natural treasures of evil spirit lands were very hard to come by in the outside world.

Each time it appeared, they would be seized away. Furthermore, the prices were exceedingly high.

It was precisely because of this that those martial artists would enter the land of evil spirits at the expense of their lives, wanting to find some natural treasures.

“This ... In the place one million miles in the north-east direction of Jewelhill City, there’s a Yin Wind Den. That place is the largest land of evil spirits in the vicinity of Jewelhill City. But the danger there is also much greater compared to other places. It’s just that other lands of evil spirits probably don’t have the Night Twill Grass,” Su Linpu said.

Ye Yuan became interested the moment he heard this. Evil spirits that were too ordinary did not have much effect on Dustless.

Dustless told him, want to find a useful land of evil spirits, there must have the Night Twill Grass, this level of spirit medicine.

Therefore, that was why Ye Yuan would say so.

He did not expect that there really was one!

“Manager Su, can you tell me about this Yin Wind Den in detail?” Ye Yuan said.

Su Linpu nodded and said, “That is, of course! The Yin Wind Den is the largest land of evil spirits in Jewelhill City area. Jewelhill City has quite a few powerful martial artists who would stay at the Yin Wind Den all year round. Some of the Yin-attribute spirit medicines produced there are highly popular with martial artists. But the danger there is also plain for all to see. The Deity Realm powerhouses who die at the Yin Wind Den every year are no fewer than a hundred people! It’s said that the Yin Wind Den’s depths, there are even two-star evil spirits whose strength rivals human Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm! Once encountered, the average person would die beyond a doubt!”

Ye Yuan felt terror in his heart when he heard it too!

Grotto Profound Deity Realm was divided into initial-stage, middle-stage, late-stage, as well as grand completion.

Each minor realm, the strength disparity was exceedingly great.

Middle-stage Grotto Profound martial artists could easily crush initial-stage martial artists!

Ye Yuan had currently just recovered his strength and was merely initial-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm.

While two-star evil spirits, those were existences even stronger than ordinary Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouses.

Once ran into two-star evil spirits, they would die without a doubt.

Dustless said that the Heavenspan World could not compare to the Immortal Grove World anymore.

In the Immortal Grove World, he would easily devour the Deathsoul Tree.

But here, he was at most able to deal with a late-stage one-star evil spirit.

Encountering a one-star grand completion evil spirit, he would have to give a wide berth too.

As for two-star evil spirits, even he had no way of dealing with them either.

Ye Yuan did not expect that this trip really had quite a bit of danger!

Su Linpu gave Ye Yuan a glance and said, “If you insist on going, better let Luo Jian follow along with you.”
