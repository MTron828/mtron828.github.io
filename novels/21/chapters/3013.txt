Chapter 3012: Overcoming Strength With Strength!

Hearing this, everyone was stupefied.

Not interested?

It was admitting cowardice, right!

True, a wise man did not fight when the odds were against him!

However, Long He did not have the intention of letting Ye Yuan off. His figure moved, blocking Ye Yuan’s path, and he said with a sneer, “You say that you have no interest, means you have no interest?”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “Then what do you want?”

Long He said coolly, “Unless you kowtow to the nine of us and take the initiative to withdraw from the competition for young patriarch!”

If he kowtowed in front of so many people, even if Progenitor let Ye Yuan be the young patriarch, he would not have the face to take on the role too.

The actions of Long He and the rest seemed very childish to Ye Yuan.

No matter what, they were Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses too.

Even if they wanted to fight for the position of young patriarch, they should rely on strength to vie for it too.

But sometimes, in front of benefits, people tend to appear very immature.

The position of young patriarch represented greater accomplishments and a higher status!

Nobody was unmoved.

Long He and the rest did not look down on Ye Yuan. On the contrary, they regarded Ye Yuan very highly. That was why there was such an action.

Ye Yuan was only Emperor Cloud Heaven now, they could still suppress him.

But, if Ye Yuan stepped into Emperor Vast Heaven, they would really have no advantage at all.

Hence, for the position of young patriarch, they unanimously decided to teach Ye Yuan a lesson, making him automatically withdraw from the competition for young patriarch.

Ye Yuan looked at Long He and said with a smile that was not a smile, “In that case, you all are hellbent on me taking action? The nine of you think that you’ve cornered me?”

Long He said coolly, “Cornered you??Huhu,?it should be a fair fight for us! Just now, we said it too. You cultivated the Eternal River’s chaos, with your strength far surpassing those in the same rank! Moreover, if the future lord of the Dragon Clan can’t even suppress us, the young patriarchs of the nine lineages, what right do you have to become the lord of the dragon race?”

Ye Yuan was shocked. He discovered that he actually had nothing to say in response.

You were clearly full of shit, but why did it sound like it made a lot of sense?

“Pfff!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ye Yuan snorted with laughter and said, “Alright, you’ve already put it like this. If I were to still decline with all sorts of excuses, then I really can’t justify it. Which of you is coming first?”

The nine people’s eyes lit up, thinking to themselves that this brat indeed could not stand being goaded.

The few people seemed reckless, but actually, they had long planned it out.

Ye Yuan’s performance previously, they also took it into their sights.

Facing Progenitor Mi Zhen, Ye Yuan did not back down in the least bit. It was sufficient to see his pride.

“I’ll go first!”

A guy with a dragon’s head and lion’s body stepped forward. This was the Suan Ni Clan’s young patriarch, Long?Hui1.

Long Hui had just broken through to Emperor Vast Heaven not long. His strength was lower Emperor Vast Heaven.

Ye Yuan guessed that he should be the weakest among the nine people.

“Ye Yuan, what you cultivate is the Eternal River’s power of chaos, with boundless power. When we fight in a while, you have to show mercy!” Long Hui said with a smile that was not a smile.

“Relax, I will,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

These few guys really made people speechless.

They were not like those geniuses, posturing everywhere; instead, they deliberately showed weakness to the enemy.

It was like Ye Yuan was bullying them.

Their cultivation realms were clearly much higher than Ye Yuan’s.

Opening the Door of Eternal Life’s first seal and not opening the seal, it was completely different.

Once the seal was opened, the aura of the Door of Eternal Life would overflow, greatly increasing one’s strength.

Under normal circumstances, Emperor Vast Heaven was invincible against Emperor Cloud Heaven!

Only those guys with powerful backgrounds and deep foundations could rely on powerful trump cards to make up for such a huge disparity.

But very clearly, the ones who possessed all kinds of trump cards were the nine great young patriarchs!

It was naturally doubly difficult for Ye Yuan to want to jump realms and fight.

Ye Yuan’s response directly rendered everyone speechless.

“Is this boy really stupid or pretending to be dumb? He wouldn’t really think that by cultivating the Eternal River’s chaos, he’s invincible under the heavens, right?”

“Heh heh,?he even really dares to agree to it! He probably hasn’t realized who his opponent is, right?”

“The nine clans’ young patriarchs, each and every one has exceedingly formidable means. They are not some ordinary Emperor Vast Heaven!”

“I think that this Ye Yuan has interacted too much with Hegemon Realms and simply looks down on Emperor Vast Heaven. His standards are too high!”

… …

In the void, two figures stood side by side.

These two people were both paying attention to this challenge.

One of them was precisely the Hegemon Long Jian, who stayed behind to guard Heavenly Dragon Island.

While the other was the Qin Niu Clan’s progenitor, Hegemon Long Hai!

“I thought that you’d make a move to stop it,” Long Hai said.

Long Jian gave the other party a glance and said coolly, “The brats are just fighting in jest. It’s not to be taken for real. Moreover, I’m also very curious how strong the power of chaos in the Eternal River is!”

Long Hai smiled and said, “Yeah, it indeed makes people curious. However, Ye Yuan’s realm is still too low. It’s simply impossible to be Long Hui’s match. This boy is too proud. It’s easy to break if one is too tough!”

Long Jian gave a cold snort but did not speak.

Clearly, he did not feel optimistic about Ye Yuan either.

This kind of fight was clearly unfair.

Even the weakest Long Hui was not an ordinary person.

The dragon race’s young patriarchs did not have a single mediocre person!

These few people were all seedlings targeted to be Supreme Hegemons in the future!

This boy really could not be spurred on at all!

“Make your move!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Long Hui grinned and said, “You’re the genius that Progenitor Mi Tian thinks highly of. Brother Ye, please give guidance.”

Finished saying, Long Hui turned into an afterimage, pouncing straight for Ye Yuan.

It was only to see him raise his dragon claw and directly smack down toward Ye Yuan without the slightest flashiness.

However, at this moment, his bloodline power directly erupted to the peak.

“Suan Ni Clan’s bloodline divine ability, Sacred Heaven Seal!”

“Fine lad, Young Patriarch Long Hui is going to crush domineeringly!”

“Under bloodline pressure, this move virtually sweeps across those in the same rank! I want to see what Ye Yuan will use to receive this move!”

… …

Sacred Heaven Seal was the Suan Ni Clan’s divine ability secret technique.

Coupled with Long Hui’s peak heaven qian grade bloodline, the power was irresistible.

This move did not have the slightest flashiness. It was an out-and-out crushing.

It was like hand-to-hand fighting between mortals.

However, the moment this move was unleashed, that power soared several times over!

Even if facing ordinary middle Emperor Vast Heavens, Long Hui could directly crush them too!

As for Ye Yuan, this upper Emperor Cloud Heaven, he never thought that he could receive it at all.

Ye Yuan’s smartest approach now was to avoid the sharp edge!

Under the circumstances where there was such a huge gap in cultivation realm, overcoming strength with strength did not exist at all.

However, right at this time, Ye Yuan moved too.

Similarly, without the slightest flashiness, he raised his fist to meet the enemy.

In fact, Ye Yuan did not utilize any martial technique!

Chaos divine essence completely erupted on Ye Yuan’s body, all of it gathering on his fist.

A genuine overcoming strength with strength!

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them was dumbstruck with shock.

Was this guy courting death?

You’re freaking … not even using martial techniques?

In the void, Long Hai said with a loud laugh,?“Hahaha?… this boy is really interesting! Just how much is he looking down on our dragon race that he’d use this kind of method to fight?”

In his view, this way of fighting was too laughable.

An Emperor Cloud Heaven actually chose to confront an Emperor Vast Heaven head-on!

No matter what you cultivated, this was no different from courting death.

Boom!

One human and one dragon, directly collided together.

Thud, thud, thud?…

Long Hui’s figure retreated ten thousand feet explosively, before barely managing to stabilize.

His face swelled until it turned purple.
