Chapter 2298: Sweeping Away!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hahaha ... This boy repeatedly does alarming things. Blocking the door and face-slapping, truly overbearing!”

Inside Feather Mountain’s great hall, Sacred Ancestor High Priest burst into laughter.

Ye Yuan’s action caused such a great commotion. Sacred Ancestor High Priest would know even if he did not want to.

“Master, with Second Sage messing around like this, if he loses, what he loses will be our face!” Eldest Disciple said.

“Yeah, Master! Take the chance that challenging the mountain hasn’t begun yet. You should make a move and stop this absurd move! Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove has already been famous for a long time. He’s absolutely not an existence that Second Sage can shake!” Third Disciple said.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest swept across the faces of his disciples and said with a big smile, “Why do I have to stop it? Such an exciting great show, how boring would it be to stop it? Face? How much is face worth? The few of you have been in a high position for too long, and you have long already forgotten your initial intention! Face isn’t what others give to you, but you vying for it yourself! The reason why you all have face is because Master’s strength is powerful enough! Master doesn’t have face, it’s because Master’s strength isn’t as powerful as Medicine Ancestor’s, nothing more!”

The group of disciples trembled all over, all revealing expressions of shame.

Ji Mo was silent for a moment, and then he spoke up, “Master, if Lord Second Sage is defeated, what should we do?”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest said indifferently, “Lose then lose, what’s the big deal? Some people, if they lose, then they are really defeated. While others will become braver in the face of setbacks! Which type do you think this boy is?”

Ji Mo said without thinking, “Lord Second Sage’s temperament is extremely steadfast and persevering. So he’s the latter!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest nodded and said, “Therefore, he won’t lose. Regardless of getting a win or a loss, the victor will be him!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s words were somewhat awkward-sounding, but the meaning was very clear.

If he won, Ye Yuan’s name would become renowned throughout the Heavenspan World, and he would rise to the rank of ancestors from there.

If he lost, Ye Yuan would definitely reflect on the bitter lesson and learn his lesson from the failure.

No matter what, Ye Yuan was already in a position that could not be defeated!

Ji Mo was shocked, suddenly feeling that Ye Yuan’s operation was full marks.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest gave him a glance and said smilingly, “This boy is clear about what he’s doing! This boy isn’t somebody who causes trouble for no reason. You go and investigate the reason why he suddenly wants to challenge Cloud Summer Mountain.”

“Yes, Master!” Ji Mo received the order and left.

... ...

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind him, climbed up the steps, neither hurriedly nor slowly.

The commotion stirred so much. It was impossible for Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove to not receive the move.

After all, ancestors have the pride of ancestors.

A large group of people followed behind Ye Yuan, they were all here to watch the show.

The commotion was too big. They had to pay attention to it even if they did not want to.

“Heh, how far do you guys think Second Sage can challenge until?”

“His strength is really very strong. But Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove’s disciples’ strengths are similarly not weak! I reckon that he should be able to meet their eldest senior brother, Yun Windborne!”

“Heh, Yun Windborne is a grand completion Ancestor Realm level powerhouse, aren’t you overestimating him too much? In my view, he can meet their third senior brother, Tong Qiwei.”

... ...

With the battle against Zhao Zixuan earlier, Ye Yuan already proved his own strength. Right now, there was already no one who felt that Ye Yuan this Second Sage enjoyed undeserved fame.

However, he was actually going to challenge ancestor-level powerhouses right now. It was still overestimating his own ability a little too much.

One had to know, ancestor-level powerhouses, their disciples’ strength already reached the peak of the Heavenspan World’s Alchemy Dao too!

Only in front of the ancestors would they be a notch lower.

In front of others, those were all heaven-shocking big shots.

This kind of powerhouse was not what anybody could provoke.

Very soon, a youth in green robes walked over from on top of the mountain. His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was filled with disdain.

“It’s you who’s challenging the mountain?”

“Yes.”

“Do you know what place this is?”

“I know.”

“You know and you still dare to come?”

“I’m here to slap faces!”

“Ha, what high-sounding sentiments! This emperor is Ancestor Maplegrove’s eighth disciple, Gu Yulong. I’ll size up Second Sage’s strength!”

“You’re too weak. It’s better to let Ancestor Maplegrove himself come out.”

Gu Yulong had a disdainful look and said with a cold smile, “I hope that your strength is as great as your tone! Since you came to challenge the mountain, pass me first before talking!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said coolly, “Okay! Mu Tiesheng!”

“Oh, this lowly one is here!”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s summons, Mu Tiesheng ran out subserviently, a flattering look on his face.

He was a late-stage Heavenly Emperor super powerhouse too. Currently, in front of Ye Yuan, he was like a little lackey.

In the crowd, Fang Tianren was already crazy with envy.

He hated it!

Why did he have to posture in front of Ye Yuan? Why did he step on Ye Yuan?

Originally, he was still very happy to have earned several billion.

But now, when he saw Mu Tiesheng, that bit of profit suddenly became dull and tasteless. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Furthermore, Ye Yuan actually went to find Mu Tiesheng again!

Several days later, Mu Tiesheng held the vast spirit divine pill in his hand gleefully, smiling like an idiot.

While Gu Yulong was sitting at one side dejectedly, battered out of his senses.

He lost too miserably!

The medicinal pill was chosen by him, it was much harder than even Zhu Tianxiang’s.

Gu Yulong already performed very well, but he was still completely wrecked by Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan continued advancing. Before long, another person came down the mountain.

The opponent this time was Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove’s sixth disciple.

The result was still a miserable defeat.

The few disciples at the back, Ye Yuan swept all the way.

No matter what medicinal pill the other party picked, Ye Yuan would firmly suppress the other party.

The current Ye Yuan was like an unrivaled expert, no matter how formidable your means were, I would stand firm and not budge an inch.

His might was like a tall mountain, being insurmountable.

Finally, Ye Yuan encountered the third disciple, Tong Qiwei.

The reason why many people predicted that Ye Yuan would stop at Tong Qiwei was because starting from him, the disciples at the back were all late-stage Ancestor Realm powerhouses.

Late-stage Ancestor Realm powerhouses represented the apex of Alchemy Dao.

As long as ancestors did not come into being, this level of powerhouse was the strongest existence in the world!

When Tong Qiwei saw Ye Yuan, he said coolly, “To be able to walk until here, you’re indeed very strong already! Second Sage indeed lives up to your reputation. It’s just that it ends here.”

Ye Yuan had an indifferent look as he said, “You’re a junior, you choose the medicinal pill.”

Tong Qiwei’s face changed and he said in a solemn voice, “Reckless and blind! Since you’re looking for abuse, then this emperor will grant you your wish! I choose the Supreme God-refining Pill!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Begin then.”

Tong Qiwei frowned and said, “Since it’s an alchemy battle, it naturally starts at the same time.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I refine pills with Formation Dao. If I start, you don’t need to refine anymore. That way, you’ll lose even more face.”

Tong Qiwei was shocked and angry as he said, “Formation Dao Pill Refinement! You’re refining the Supreme God-refining Pill with Formation Dao?”

At this time, Gu Yulong smiled bitterly and said, “Third Senior Brother, he has been doing Formation Dao Pill Refinement all the way!”

Tong Qiwei’s entire body trembled, finally starting to look at Ye Yuan squarely.

He nodded his head and said, “Fine, I’ll refine first! Today, I’ll witness your Formation Dao Pill Refinement!”

Several days later, Tong Qiwei looked at that end spirit divine pill and was speechless for a long time. He did not even realise that Ye Yuan walked past him.

Mu Tiesheng was agitated until his heart was about to jump out. He put away the Supreme God-refining Pill happily.
