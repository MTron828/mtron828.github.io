Chapter 1831 You All, Can“t Even Admit Defea

“You can try, see if they have the chance to concede or not!”These words were akin to a heavy hammer, smashing onto the hearts of High Clarity Sect’s people.

If Ye Yuan said these words the last time, no one would take it seriously at all.

But now, he had this confidence to say these words!

One-shotting Li Yiping with one move, this was not what everyone could do.

Yang Shen’s two eyes narrowed, shooting out two cold rays of light.

This Ye Yuan was too rampant!

Suddenly, Yang Shen’s gaze landed on Baili Qingyan and he said with a cold smile, “If I’m not mistaken, this is your lover, right? Heh, do you think that only you can kill people?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, expression turning gloomy.

How strong Yang Shen’s strength was, Ye Yuan was not clear. But he absolutely would not underestimate the other party.

It was true that Ye Yuan was confident, but he was never arrogant.

“If you want to kill me, feel free to come and try! Although my Shadowmoon Sect can’t match up to your High Clarity Sect, we still have this bit of backbone!” Ye Yuan had not spoken yet and Baili Qingyan already spoke up first.

Yi Qingxiang also said coolly, “At most it’s death! Even if the three of us all die, three lives for seven lives, it’s also more than enough to break-even!”

Yi Qingxiang’s words had just landed when Jiang Xueyan actually showed a rare support for Ye Yuan as she said, “Your High Clarity Sect’s face can’t be provoked, then can my Shadowmoon Sect be trampled upon by anybody?”

Ye Yuan looked at the three people rather surprisedly, not expecting that they were actually so supportive.

Was this still those people he knew?

Baili Qingyan was still alright; she had pride in her bones. Ye Yuan could feel it.

But Yi Qingxiang and Jiang Xueyan indeed greatly exceeded his expectations.

Hearing this, Yang Shen’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He suddenly discovered that the High Clarity Sect’s domineeringness already forced the Shadowmoon Sect to twist into a rope.

These four people’s stances were to fight to the bitter end with the High Clarity Sect.

Ye Yuan looked at Yang Shena and said coolly, “You hear that? My Shadowmoon Sect’s dignity is similarly not allowed to be provoked! Since you all picked the fight first, then you have to be prepared to be counter-attacked by us! Let’s go!”

Finished talking, the Shadowmoon Sect’s few people immediately left.

Returning to Upper Groove Court, Ye Yuan’s expression was not as composed as before anymore.

“Elder Xu, is Yang Shen’s strength very strong?” Ye Yuan asked.

Seeing Ye Yuan asked, only now did Xu Yan let out a sigh and said, “I still thought that you had anger going to your head and was blind with arrogance!”

It was not that he did not know the danger of provoking the High Clarity Sect like this. It was just that he similarly did not want sully the Shadowmoon Sect’s reputation, that was why he did not stop it.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “The High Clarity Sect is bullying people too far. We merely stayed at the Upper Groove Court, but they wanted to take people’s lives like there’s a great enmity. Senior Apprentice Sister Jiang’s luck in the first round was a little better and didn’t run into the High Clarity Sect’s people. But once she runs into them at the back, they’ll definitely still deal a deadly blow. As for Senior Apprentice Sister Baili, Yang Shen probably won’t let her off either. Even if I don’t do this, they won’t let us have an easy time too.”

Ye Yuan saw it very penetratingly, the High Clarity Sect was this domineering.

They felt that their face was more important than anything and did not allow anyone to tower above him.

The Shadowmoon Sect staying in the Upper Groove Court touched that sensitive nerve of theirs.

They did not give Yi Qingxiang a chance to admit defeat, immediately taking off his lower jaw when they came up. This already explained everything.

It was precisely because of so that Ye Yuan had killing intent aroused.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Xu Yan’s brows knitted tightly together. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Clearly, he did not think as thoroughly as Ye Yuan.

“Yang Shen is known as the High Clarity Sect’s number one genius in one million years! His strength is very formidable! But just how strong it is, apart from the High Clarity Sect’s people, no one knows. Normally speaking, disciples taking part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, the disparity in strength would not be too great. Of course, there are exceptions too. You’re one, Yang Shen should be one as well!” Xu Yan said with a solemn look.

Ye Yuan fell silent when he heard that. Everyone did not speak, quietly looking at him.

Little Tong also looked at Ye Yuan very curiously, wanting to see how he would resolve the present situation.

After a moment, Ye Yuan’s gaze swept across everyone’s faces and he said, “Senior Apprentice Sister Jiang, I’ll refine a Jadethaw Purpleheart Pill for you and help you break through to become a Second Firmament Celestial Deity.”

Jiang Xueyan’s eyes lit up, immediately feeling inexplicably surprised.

She did not think that she could actually obtain the Jadethaw Purpleheart Pill too.

Actually, when Yi Qingxiang got this medicinal pill, she was very covetous.

But she knew that Ye Yuan’s impression of her was very bad, so she also gave up hope.

Did not expect that under this kind of circumstance, Ye Yuan actually wanted to help her refine!

Xu Yan said, “It’s no use like this! Second Firmament Celestial Deity is equally too weak to stand up to the competition in front of him as well.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I naturally know this. So starting from today, I’ll help you all refine medicinal pills on one hand. On the other hand, you all have to accept my special training. And the goal is to admit defeat before I kill you all!”

Everyone was taken aback when they heard it, not expecting that Ye Yuan thought of such a method.

Ye Yuan saying so was equivalent to saying that he felt that his strength was very close to that of Yang Shen’s.

Or even stronger!

But is this possible?

Similarly a peak Second Firmament Celestial Deity, Yang Shen’s strength far surpassed Chen Tianlin’s. This indicated that his laws comprehension was definitely exceedingly strong, far surpassing those in the same rank.

“Heh heh, kid, you’re playing a joke with their lives!” Little Tong could not help disparaging and being cynical when he heard this.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “Whether it’s a joke or not, you’ll know very soon.”

...

In a blink, more than a month passed. Eighth round, Ye Yuan finally ran into a High Clarity Sect’s disciple again.

This time, it was the rank six Peng Huan.

His strength was not that high. He was only an initial-stage Second Firmament Celestial Deity, being much worse than even Li Yiping. It was naturally even less possible to be Ye Yuan’s match.

With the lesson drawn from Li Yiping’s failure, Peng Huan naturally chose to directly admit defeat.

Hence, after Du Rufeng announced the start of the match, Peng Huan opened his mouth straight away.

“I ...”

It was just a pity that he only spat a word out of his mouth and his eyes began to turn lax, and could no longer speak.

Ye Yuan’s sword was too fast!

Below the stage, there was the sound of cold air being sucked in.

Too strong!

If one was to say he could succeed the last time against Li Yi Ping because he was not prepared, then this time, it was completely the manifestation of strength!

“You all can’t even admit defeat, still call yourselves what number one sect?”

Ye Yuan looked at Yang Shen, his words full of scorn.

Yang Shen glared at Ye Yuan and bellowed, “Ye Yuan, you forced me!”

Ye Yuan ignored him and immediately left.

In the 17th round, Ye Yuan slew High Clarity Sect’s rank seven Wu Min with a sword again.

In the 25th round, Ye Yuan similarly instantly killed with a sword against Bian Ziqiu!

Halfway through the competition, the High Clarity Sect already had four disciples who died under Ye Yuan’s sword.

Each one of them wanted to concede the moment they came up, but no one could do it.

Ye Yuan’s sword was much faster than them speaking.

High Clarity Sect’s elder and Yang Shen were practically going insane.
