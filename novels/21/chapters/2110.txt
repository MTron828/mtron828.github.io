Chapter 2114: Long Xiaochun

Hearing Xin Luo’s explanation, Qi Chen was taken aback with shock.

Indeed, that emperor bone was extraordinary!

With Qi Chen’s status, he had naturally seen before emperor bones handed down from ancestors.

But he had never heard of that an emperor bone could suppress bloodline and make the Qilin Clan not have the slightest strength to retaliate.

Let alone that Qi Zhen was even an Empyrean powerhouse.

Wouldn’t that mean that as long as Ye Yuan grasped the emperor bone in his hand, he would be in an undefeatable position when facing the Qilin Clan’s Empyreans?

No way, this emperor bone must be brought back to the clan!

“Very soon, Xin Luo, this matter, my Qilin Clan has remembered it. Your Westspirit Region just wait for my Qilin Clan’s wrath! Qi Yun, let’s go!”

Done talking, Qi Chen brought Qi Yun and the rest along, and then they left in a huff.

Xin Luo had long somewhat expected this scene. Seeing the situation, he could not help smiling bitterly.

It seemed like a blood storm could not be avoided anymore.

Thinking up to here, Xin Luo could not help giving rise to resentment toward Ye Yuan in his heart.

He vented his hatred but involved the entire demon race in the fires of war.

After Qi Chen and the rest left, Gongyang Lie’s figure appeared.

“Lord Gongyang! What should be done about this matter?” Xin Luo said.

Gongyang Lie’s face turned dark and he said, “What else can we do? If the Qilin Clan comes to denounce us, then there’s only handing Ye Yuan over!”

Xin Luo’s expression changed drastically when he heard that and said, “But ... But he’s Lord Second Sage!”

Gongyang Lie sneered and said, “So what if Lord Second Sage? The might of the Qilin Clan, it’s also not that you’re not aware. Once a war starts, the entire demon race will definitely suffer a great loss in strength. At that time, can the other various races still be so quiet? Could it be because of Ye Yuan alone, we make the entire demon race fall into a crisis? I think that even if Sacred Ancestor High Priest was here, he would also hand Ye Yuan over without the slightest hesitation. Moreover, saying that he’s Second Sage, he’s currently merely a True God Realm. Who can know how the future will be? This Heavenspan World, the most valuable are geniuses, the least valuable ... are also geniuses!”

Before geniuses grew up, they were merely geniuses.

This Heavenspan World, there were geniuses dying every second. It was not lacking Ye Yuan alone.

Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength indeed made them astounded. But why would a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse like Gongyang Lie really pay attention to a genius?

All of his respect toward Ye Yuan all stemmed from Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Furthermore, Gongyang Lie also had selfish motives.

Ye Yuan’s appearance already affected High Priest Redplume’s status in the demon race.

Borrowing the Qilin Clan to eliminate Ye Yuan was also a pretty good choice.

By the side, Xin Luo’s expression flickered incessantly.

This kind of thing was already not what he could intervene in.

... ...

Regarding killing off Qi Zhen, Ye Yuan did not have much feeling.

After returning to his residence, he went into seclusion for ten days and finally completely chased away that icy-cold feeling.

While using the power of Dao marks could make his strength soar, the consequence was also tremendous.

Under normal circumstances, Ye Yuan already did not dare to utilize Dao marks anymore.

However, Ye Yuan did not have too much fear toward the Qilin Clan.

With the Qilin emperor bone around, even if ordinary Heavenly Emperors came, he could directly suppress too.

Ye Yuan believed Empyrean Vast Universe’s words more and more. The ancient era’s powerhouses were really incomparably powerful.

This Qilin emperor bone had been through countless eons and actually still had such powerful might.

That kind of bloodline suppression, unless the Qilin Clan’s pinnacle heavenly emperors came, otherwise, there was no way to contend at all.

According to Ye Yuan’s judgment, it was unlikely that a mere Qi Zhen was unlikely to provoke the Qilin Clan’s top heavenly emperors to act.

In front of a heavenly emperor, empyreans were merely ants too. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Your Excellency, someone is requesting an audience outside.” Ning Tianping’s voice came from outside the door.

“Who is it?” Ye Yuan went out and asked.

“It’s a little girl with a horn growing on top of her head. She said that she came to thank you.” Ning Tianping said.

“Thank me?” Ye Yuan was at a loss.

Apart from Yang Fei-er and Lu-er, he did not know any little girl with a horn growing on her head here.

Arriving at the hall, Ye Yuan indeed saw a little girl with a horn growing on her head. Her appearance was very lovely and cute, making people feel happy when they saw her.

When Ye Yuan saw this little girl, he actually had a very cordial feeling.

“Could it be ...”

Ye Yuan was currently astonished in his heart when that little girl already saw Ye Yuan and came in front of Ye Yuan with a few leaps and bounds, having a pair of large eyes wide open as she said with a beam, “You’re Second Sage Ye Yuan? It was you who killed Qi Zhen?”

Ye Yuan was just about to admit it, but was interrupted by the little girl again. She said, “Hehe, well killed! This young lady has long found that Qi Zhen displeasing to the eye. I came today to tell you thanks. Oh, right! If the Qilin Clan dares to come to find trouble with you, you just report my name. They definitely won’t dare to make things difficult for you! Oh, and also, I’m called Xiaochun[1].”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard that and asked, “You’re from the Dragon Clan?”

Long Xiaochun revealed a look of surprise, and she said in astonishment, “Eh, how did you know?”

When demons transformed, their shapes were diverse. Not revealing their auras, one could not differentiate the race.

But when Ye Yuan saw Long Xiaochun, the dragon race bloodline in his body actually stirred restlessly. How could Ye Yuan still not understand what was going on?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I guessed it. You had enmity with Qi Zhen?”

Long Xiaochun nodded her head like a rattle drum as he said, “That guy won against my big brother in an alchemy battle and even flaunted his prowess, saying that my big brother can’t surpass him for life! Tch, don’t their Qilin Clan just rely on fire-attribute law to win by a notch in alchemy?”

Ye Yuan also secretly nodded when he heard it. This conformed to Qi Zhen’s temper, being overbearing.

Long Xiaochun sized Ye Yuan up and down and asked with a very curious look, “I heard that Qi Chen made a bet with you. But in the end, Qi Zhen really did not dare to accept the challenge and canceled the bet with not being present as the reason, and he even threatened you. That’s why he was killed by you; is that so?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “There was indeed such a thing.”

Long Xiaochun giggled after hearing and said, “Qi Zhen that fellow is really as cocky as before! But now, he can’t strut around anymore, hahaha ...”

Talking until the back, Long Xiaochun laughed until she shook with laughter, appearing very happy.

Laughing finish, Long Xiaochun patted Ye Yuan’s shoulder like a little grown-up and said smugly, “Remember, if those Qilin Clan’s old fellows come to find trouble with you, you just report my, Long Xiaochun’s name, got it?”

Ye Yuan found it funny. What sorts of existences were the Qilin Clan’s major powers? Why would they fear you, a little lass?

But, towards this childlike and naive little lass, he really could not bear to reject. Smiling, he nodded and said, “Long Xiaochun, okay. I’ve remembered it.”

“Xiaochun!”

“Xiaochun! Are you here or not?”

Outside the door, an anxious voice suddenly sounded out.

The moment Long Xiaochun heard, she could not help getting a shock, hurriedly running to the back-hall.

In the end, she even turned her head around and warned Ye Yuan, “Not allowed to say that I’m here, got it? Otherwise, I’ll beat you up!”

Long Xiaochun stuck her dainty little fist out, a threatening look on her face, then she slipped into the back-hall.

At this time, a handsome young man walked into the great hall with hurried steps.

Seeing Ye Yuan, the young man clasped his hands and said, “This brother, I wonder if you’ve seen a little girl with a horn growing on her head?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Seen before. She’s hiding in the back-hall.”
