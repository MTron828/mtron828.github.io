Chapter 2334: The Jian Family’s Curiosity Is Innate

In front of him was an ordinary but hale and hearty old man. Ye Yuan even could not feel the undulation of divine essence in his body.

Throwing him into the crowd absolutely would not arouse any attention. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He was like air, clearly standing there. But it was as if he did not exist.

It was seriously very hard for Ye Yuan to associate this person in front of him to the master whose name shook the world, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets.

Very clearly, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets had already reached the realm of returning to one’s original simplicity on the journey of Dao!

Ye Yuan was sizing Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets up. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was also sizing him up at the same time.

“Little Fellow, you seem to be very curious about this old man,” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said with a warm smile.

When Ye Yuan heard that, he also smiled and said, “Senior is probably the Heavenspan World’s most mysterious Deva powerhouse. Isn’t it very normal for this junior to be a little curious?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said meaningfully, “Huhu, little fellow, you’re also very mysterious in my eyes!”

Ye Yuan’s heart went cold. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s words had an implicit meaning!

Could it be that he discovered something?

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets laughed and said, “You don’t need to be so nervous. Geniuses who can reach unpredictable aura, which one doesn’t hide massive secrets on them? It’s just that you seem to be a little more mysterious compared to them. Hence, this old man is very interested in you.”

“Unpredictable aura?” Ye Yuan asked doubtfully.

Back then, Jian Hongxiao said that he was of the emperor surmounting aura. What was this unpredictable aura?

The Jian Family’s cultivation method was very mysterious. Ye Yuan did not know much about it either.

Jian Yunxin explained, “Our human race’s numbers are huge. With Father’s means, the vast majority of people’s fate can be predicted. But heaven’s secrets are hard to predict. There will always be some people’s fate that’s beyond Heavenly Dao! These people’s fate, even Father finds it difficult to predict too. People possessing this kind of destiny have an unpredictable aura! Previously, our Jian Family members being unable to discern your destiny with the aura viewing art, it’s due to this!”

Ye Yuan was enlightened when he heard that. No wonder the Jian Family’s members would go blind when they saw him. It turned out that it was actually due to this reason.

Heaven’s secrets could not be predicted. So how could it be measured with the naked eye?

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said, “Unpredictable children are not within the operation of Heavenly Dao! Even Heavenly Dao can’t grasp their destiny too. Their talent tends to be extremely astonishing, and they are distinguished talents of the current era!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “According to what Senior said, there should be many unpredictable children. Our human race has huge numbers. Since there are so many extremely talented people, then our human race should be extremely strong. Why is it so weak now?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets sighed deeply and looked straight at Ye Yuan as he said, “A destiny that even Heavenly Dao isn’t able to control, how can Heavenly Dao allow it to live in this world?”

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, seemingly understanding something.

Unpredictable children were incredibly talented, their destinies being extremely strong. But because of this, they were not tolerated by Heavenly Dao!

Therefore, Heavenly Dao would obliterate these existences in all sorts of ways, to ensure the normal operation of Heavenly Dao.

This way, wouldn’t he have to face the sanction of Heavenly Dao?

“Therefore, over the past ten billion years, the human race’s geniuses have been abundant like schools of carps crossing the river. But those who could truly survive are scanty few! Of course, for those able to survive, each person’s strength is immensely strong. Since you’re an unpredictable child, I believe that you’ve also experienced it strongly. Your encounters were probably much more perilous than ordinary martial artists,” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said.

Ye Yuan recalled his encounters and thought that it was indeed the case.

Walking all the way until today, the dangers that he had experienced were beyond count.

Fortunately, he pulled through all of them.

“Senior didn’t come to find me to tell me these, right?” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled and said, “Didn’t I say just now that you’re very mysterious too? During these 100 years, this old man has seen before no idea how many unpredictable children. But those who can have such accomplishments at your age, there is only you alone! Hence, this old man is very curious about you too.”

Ye Yuan said hesitantly, “Does Senior ... want to use the aura viewing art on me?”

“Huhu, the Jian Family member’s curiosity is innate.” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled and said.

“But didn’t you say that I’m of the unpredictable aura? Will your eyes have any problem?’ Ye Yuan asked rather worriedly.

Only then did he understand where the Jian Family’s people’s curiosity came from.

It turned out that it was all inherited from their forefather.

However, he was a little worried about Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets. Because he was different from the others.

He was in possession of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. Its power was boundless.

Even though he was facing Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, Ye Yuan was also a little worried.

But Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets laughed loudly when he heard it and said, “Little Fellow, you’re still the first one who looks down on this old man like this! You have to know, the aura viewing art was created by this old man. Other people can’t look at unpredictable aura. So you think this old man is not able to perceive it? Heavenly Dao is ethereal, but one can always discern some inklings.”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said with a nod, “Since that’s the case, Senior go ahead and cast the spell then.”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets nodded slightly, the aura on his body suddenly changing.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, feeling as if he had arrived in another world.

This world was the world belonging to Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets.

In this place, he felt like he was stripped bare, all secrets unable to remain hidden.

Ye Yuan was shocked in his heart. Was this the strength of the strongest person who could pry into Heavenly Dao?

A milky white light surfaced on Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s eyes.

This light shone on Ye Yuan’s body, seemingly wanting to see through Ye Yuan’s secrets.

But right at this time, a shocking change suddenly occurred!

On a sunny day, a bolt of lightning suddenly cut through the sky, and directly slammed into this space!

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ expression changed wildly, all the hair on his body standing on end.

There was no time to think too much. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets suddenly pointed a finger at the sky. An astonishing aura erupted.

At this time, the number one Heavenly Emperor’s strength was displayed to the fullest expression of its beauty and form.

The expression of Ye Yuan who was in front of him similarly changed wildly. He felt as if this finger of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets could pierce a hole in the sky!

This finger was too strong!

Rumble!

With a loud bang, space collapsed, and the mansion was directly turned into ruins!

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets spewed a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, looking toward Ye Yuan with a shocked face, speechless for a long time.

The scene earlier was too shocking!

He looked at Ye Yuan with the aura viewing art just now, but seemed to have seen an eye!

That eye seemed to piece through the unreal, looking at him from some hidden place.

Meeting eyes with that eye, he felt like he was going to die.

He felt ... as if he met gazes with Heavenly Dao!

How could such a thing happen?

Unpredictable children were not tolerated by Heavenly Dao.

But why did he feel like he was staring at Heavenly Dao?

This kind of feeling was too contradictory!

And this thunderbolt out of the clear sky was Heavenly Dao’s warning!

Prying into Heavenly Dao was treason and heresy!

Heavenly Dao would naturally send down a warning!

It was also that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ strength was fearsome. If it were others, they would have likely been directly smitten into flying ashes!

How could he have known that the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain on Ye Yuan could be said to be a miniature Heavenly Dao?

Him prying into Ye Yuan’s secrets was equivalent to peeping at Heavenly Dao.

How could this sort of action be tolerated by Heavenly Dao?

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ strength was monstrous. Ever since he attained Dao, this sort of situation had never happened before.

Today, he was really scared.
