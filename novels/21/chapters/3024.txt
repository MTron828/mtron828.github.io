Chapter 3023: Supreme Luxurious Lineup!

“Kid, you, a mere Emperor Vast Heaven, summoned this seat here and there, causing this seat to run across several planes. What an incredible face you have!” Long Jian, who was wearing an azure robe, stepped out of the sky, his overwhelming aura billowing to the sky.

Together with him were also three of the dragon race’s Hegemons.

One of them was Long Ran.

“Supreme Hegemon! The dragon race’s Supreme Hegemon!” Feng Xiaotian cried out in surprise and looked toward Ye Yuan in disbelief.

Dragon race, that was absolutely the pinnacle-most race in the 33 Heavens’ planes!

This race was proud to the extreme and would not give face to anyone at all.

But, judging from Long Jian’s words, his relationship with Ye Yuan was not superficial!

Ye Yuan smiled and said with clasped hands, “It’s been hard on Senior Long Jian! In the future, if Ye Yuan has any leads, I’ll be the first to help Senior!”

Long Jian said disdainfully, “Making an empty promise, do you think that this seat is a three-year-old kid?”

At this time, several more figures stepped out. They were several women.

A woman of unparalleled beauty in the front looked at Ye Yuan with a look of resentment and said, “You normally give me the cold shoulder. When the situation becomes critical, you’re even ordering this young lady around. Does this young lady owe you?”

This woman was precisely Feng Qingxuan!

There was also Luan Qinghe who came along with her!

Feng Xiaotian’s pupils constricted. It was another Supreme Hegemon!

The Vermilion Bird Clan’s Supreme Hegemon!

It was only to hear Luan Qinghe said, “Kid, don’t forget your promise! You owe my Vermilion Bird Clan a favor!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, rest assured. Feng Qingxuan and this Ye are good friends. As long as this Ye makes it, I’ll definitely lend her a helping hand!”

Luan Qinghe nodded slightly and stopped speaking.

The void shuddered, and several more figures stepped out.

These figures were somewhat illusory. One look and Feng Xiaotian discerned that it was the soul race!

But the arrivals were the Nirvanic Soul Clan’s Hegemon Cloudneon and Hegemon Imperishable!

Hegemon Imperishable came in person!

There was also a middle-aged man that Ye Yuan did not recognize. But he saw through the other party’s Qi Soul Clan identity at a glance.

This Qi Soul Clan powerhouse was a Peak Hegemon too!

It seemed like the Qi and Nirvanic two clans had already buried the hatchet.

However, Ye Yuan did not expect that Hegemon Heavenly Soul would actually send someone over.

“With Senior Imperishable coming in person, Ye Yuan is overwhelmed by the unexpected favor!” Ye Yuan said toward Hegemon Imperishable with clasped hands.

Hegemon Imperishable waved his hand and said, “I heard that there’s a chance to fight with the Chaos Bloodstone this time. That’s why I came!”

Ye Yuan smiled and did not argue.

He understood that Imperishable was returning his favor.

No matter what, it was him who saved the Nirvanic Soul Clan and also saved him, Hegemon Imperishable!

He saluted the Qi Soul Clan Hegemon and said, “Many thanks to Senior for helping out!”

The middle-aged man waved his hand and said, “This seat is Soul Intent. Lord Heavenly Soul wants me to tell you that he remembers the grudge!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then this Ye will personally pay a visit and ask for punishment on another day!”

Heavenly Soul was a proud but honest and frank man. He naturally could not put aside his ego.

However, this Hegemon Soul Intent came; it already explained everything.

Feng Xiaotian already could not speak. He did not dare imagine how shocked his heart was at this time!

In just this short while, nine Hegemons came!

Furthermore, these were all not ordinary Hegemons. Each of their auras was incomparably powerful. They were at least Peak Hegemon level too!

Especially Long Jian, Luan Qinghe, and Hegemon Imperishable, they were bona fide Supreme Hegemons!

Plus Zhao Yue, whose combat strength approached Supreme Hegemon, it was equivalent to them having four Supreme Hegemons!

This lineup was simply luxurious to the extreme!

One had to know, even if it was the soul race, they only had two Supreme Hegemons too!

What on earth did Ye Yuan this fellow do in these hundred years?

So many big shots actually descended upon Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven for him, a puny little Emperor Vast Heaven.

If not for seeing it with his own eyes, he would not believe it even if he was beaten to death too!

It was not that Ye Yuan was a prophet but that he could feel that the Chaos Bloodstone had become much stronger.

Therefore, the blood race’s strength would definitely become stronger!

Ye Yuan was worried. So he requested Long Jian to head to the Vermilion Bird Clan and Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven to invite these Hegemons to take action.

Actually, he was just borrowing some Hegemon Realms and did not invite Luan Qinghe and Hegemon Imperishable. He did not expect that they would come on their own.

This result had also exceeded his expectations.

But, looking at it now, it was naturally the stronger the better.

Yang Qing, Jingfei, Big Yellow, and the rest were long already dumbstruck with amazement and did not even dare to breathe loudly.

These Hegemon Realms’ auras were too powerful!

One had to know that these Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven powerhouses had never seen Supreme Hegemons before at all.

Qin Shan suddenly felt that life was lackluster.

Was it so easy to be friends with Supreme Hegemons?

Traveling for over a hundred years, it was merely a snap of a finger to powerhouses like them.

But not only did Ye Yuan’s strength catch up to him in these years, he also even brought so many Hegemon Realms all at once!

Life was so uninteresting!

“Ye Yuan, this … this …” Feng Xiaotian really did not know how to express it.

Hegemon Realm, even if it was the most ordinary Hegemon Realm, they were aloof from the masses in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

But he felt that he was so insignificant now!

Ye Yuan knew his shock and said with a smile, “Seniors, this is my close brother, Hegemon Battlesky! These few thousand years, he has always been fighting against the blood race. He’s an elder brother that this Ye holds great esteem for!”

“So, it’s Brother Battlesky. After resolving the blood race’s calamity, you can come to my Dragon Clan if you’re free,” Long Jian greeted with a smile.

Feng Xiaotian was being overwhelmed by an unexpected favor

“Brother Battlesky,” Luan Qinghe also greeted him.

“Brother Battlesky, you can also come to my Qi Soul Clan when you’re free,” Hegemon Soul Intent said.

Feng Xiaotian answered one by one, feeling very honored.

Although he knew that these people were all looking on the account of Ye Yuan’s face, that was why they greeted him like this.

Hegemons were very strong, but he was really nothing in front of this powerful group.

“Alright, since everyone is here, then let’s not delay! The blood race and Heaven one’s Hegemons are currently fighting fiercely. Seniors, please lend a helping hand!” Ye Yuan said to everyone with clasped hands.

“Let Brother Battlesky lead the way. You stay behind.” Long Jian said.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I can feel that the Chaos Bloodstone’s clone is about to come into being! If I’m not around, you all might not be able to handle it!”

These words were arrogant enough, but the expressions of Long Jian and the rest turned somber.

The Chaos Bloodstone’s clone coming into being, that must be a Great Beyond Realm overlord.

They all, these people, really could not handle it.

Long Jian frowned and said, “He’s already coming into being. What can you, a measly little Emperor Vast Heaven, do?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I have some means. Maybe it will have a surprising effect!”

Long Jian raised his eyebrows and said with a nod, “Alright, let’s go then!”

Hence, more than ten Hegemon Realm powerhouses brought Ye Yuan and tore across the sky.

West Sun City’s main camp was dead silent.

After a long time, Yang Qing suddenly said to Qin Shan, “You said that Ye Yuan was a traitor?”

Qin Shan choked when he heard that, almost giving himself a slap.

He said with a black face, “Rubbish! When did I say that? Yang Qing, don’t think that you can fabricate rumors everywhere because you’re strong!”

Traitor?

You have got to be kidding! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

If he was really a traitor, bring these few people here and he could sweep the entire Heaven One Alliance away!
