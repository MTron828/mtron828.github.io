Chapter 2849 Bullying to the Doorstep!

“A great destiny wielder plus the power of blessing, this … simply has no solution!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Not just lower True Sovereign Heaven, I’m afraid that if middle True Sovereign Heaven encounters this boy, they will vomit blood too!” “Yeah! Although Ye Yuan can’t do anything to a middle True Sovereign Heaven, if the middle True Sovereign Heaven wants to kill him, it’s simply dreaming!”

“I suspect that if this boy goes to a mystic realm right now, will he be able to find treasures if he went to relieve himself?”

Those martial nephews of Ye Yuan were rambling away, finding it hard to hide the shock in their hearts.

This luck was really going to defy the heavens.

One could say that the entire Extreme Medicine Sect was standing behind Ye Yuan now! Wanting to kill him, you would have to ask the Extreme Medicine Sect’s predecessors!

With the augmentation of the sect’s destiny, it would be hard even if Ye Yuan wanted to die!

These grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses were all envious until they wanted to smack Ye Yuan to death.

Very soon, the tribulation clouds scattered in disgrace, as if feeling some kind of deep helplessness too.

Ye Yuan’s realm also broke through smoothly, reaching upper Saint Sovereign Heaven.

He came before Li Clearcloud rather excitedly and said with a smile, “Eldest Senior Brother, this power of blessing is really very useful! When you transcend tribulation, is it like this too?”

Li Clearcloud’s face turned black, immediately wanting to ignore Ye Yuan.

Was it like this?

Yes!

But it was already very impressive to have one time under ten rounds of Dao tribulation.

He was simply cheating!

If he transcended tribulations like this for all future realms, then would the first divergent cultivator Hegemon in history be born?

It was not impossible!

He thought that the bet that Ye Yuan made with him would only be realized after a very long time.

He did not expect that the face-slapping came so quickly!

It was likely not easy to outlast Ye Yuan!

He was a wielder of great destiny to begin with. Now, having obtained the power of blessing too, it would really be hard to die even if he wanted to.

Swoosh!

Li Clearcloud threw a small and exquisite jade sword over, saying in a muffled voice, “I don’t want to talk to you. Take this jade sword and hurry up and go! Also, don’t come to the Extreme Light Pavilion if you have nothing to do. Either way, your realm is still lacking. It’s no use to come here too!” The others nodded one after another, deeply feeling that way too.

This guy seemed to purely be here to bully people!

Finished saying, Li Clearcloud did not give Ye Yuan the chance to talk at all, flicking his sleeves. Ye Yuan was sent out of the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space.

……

“Ouch!”

Ye Yuan plopped his buttocks onto the ground and grimaced in pain.

This Li Clearcloud was really merciless!

Ye Yuan felt that he was very innocent. Wasn’t it just transcending a tribulation? Was there a need for each and every one of you to look like you’re bound by a common hatred for an enemy?

Ye Yuan surveyed the surroundings. He returned to his residence.

The means of an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse was really fantastical.

Even with his spatial rule attainments, he did not figure out how he returned.

He was holding the Extreme Light Jade Sword in his hand. This was the token of an Extreme Light Pavilion’s pavilion elder’s identity and also the key to enter the Extreme Light Pavilion.

The location of the Extreme Light Pavilion was very secret. Ordinary people did not know at

all.

However, Ye Yuan had the Extreme Light Jade Sword in his hands. As long as it was within the boundary of the Extreme Medicine Sect, he could enter the Extreme Light Pavilion at any time.

With the Extreme Light Jade Sword, Ye Yuan was one of the most powerful people in the Extreme Medicine Sect.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan heard a din outside.

“Zhu Yan, after messing around for a long time, this little junior brother of yours is a coward!” “It’s also just bullying some juniors. When it really comes down to exchanging blows with his peers, he doesn’t even dare to let out a fart!”

“Martial Uncle Zuo Chen is so protective of him like a hen protecting her chicks. I was wondering what kind of alchemy genius he was. After messing around for a long time, he doesn’t even dare to show his face.”

At this time, Xuan Yang Peak was surrounded by many people. Most were Emperor Realm powerhouses. There was also a minority who were True Sovereign Heavens.

But the words were rather impolite.

Zhu Yan’s brows were tightly furrowed, and he said, “Wang Lin, stop showing off here! If you have the ability, let’s have a contest! Little Junior Brother just entered the sect, and you all are bullying to the doorstep like this. Do you really treat our lineage like we have nobody?”

But Wang Lin was not angry and said with a smile, “My Junior Apprentice Brother Lu is grade five realm too. How can fighting with a peer be bullying to the doorstep? You all don’t even dare to have this kind of competition. Are you not cowardly turtles? Zhu Yan, if you were to admit that your lineage’s people are all cowards in front of all the senior and junior apprentice brothers, we can turn around and leave!”

The expressions of Zhu Yan and the few senior apprentice brothers were ugly to the extreme. While by the side, Hua Zong’s face was flushed red, wishing to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

This Wang Lin was Emperor Qin Shan’s eldest disciple.

Emperor Qin Shan was Emperor Zuo Chen’s sworn enemy.

The two people’s strengths were comparable, and their status in the sect was similar too. They were also backbone figures of the conservative and warring factions. They could be said to be incompatible like water and fire.

Previously, Emperor Qin Shan added fuel to the fire with regards to Ye Yuan’s matter, planning on making Zuo Chen lose a great deal of face. In the end, he himself ended up dusty and dirty in appearance. Everyone was perfectly clear about those affairs in the sect.

Having lost so much face, Qin Shan was naturally not willing to let the matter go.

Just nice, his youngest disciple exited seclusion and his alchemy path strength improved greatly, so he came to bully to the doorstep.

Who was his youngest disciple?

Lu Daoyi, Extreme Medicine Sect’s grade five heavenly alchemists’ number one person!

Before Ye Yuan entered the sect, Lu Daoyi was the Extreme Medicine Sect’s man of the hour.

He challenged the entire Extreme Medicine Sect’s grade five heavenly alchemists by himself!

In alchemy, he could be said to have fought all over the Extreme Medicine Sect and was unrivaled!

Even many grade six heavenly alchemists were not his match either.

Back then, Zuo Chen and Qin Shan were both very optimistic about Lu Daoyi and wanted to take him in as a disciple.

As a result, Lu Daoyi still chose Qin Shan in the end.

After he got the title of number one grade five, he immediately went into closed-seclusion.

This closed-seclusion was ten years long!

Just a few days ago, Lu Daoyi just exited seclusion. Before he could display his ability, Ye Yuan just happened to have arrived.

Under Qin Shan’s hastening of influence, Ye Yuan merely entered the sect for less than half a day and was already the man of the hour in the entire Extreme Medicine Sect.

Qin Shan naturally could not swallow this insult. Didn’t he send Lu Daoyi to come and challenge him?

It was just nice. It also let Lu Daoyi display his strength after leaving seclusion!

On the one hand, it showed that he, Qin Shan, could teach disciples. On the other hand, it was also to let the conservation faction obtain more say.

You look, only by secretly developing in the rear, could one produce experts!

Of course, Lu Daoyi did not let Qin Shan down either.

He came to Xuan Yang Peak to challenge Ye Yuan. In the end, Ye Yuan just happened to have gone to the Extreme Light Pavilion.

Zhu Yan and the rest just happened to be here. It was naturally impossible to let Ye Yuan, this newcomer disciple, step forward.

Lu Daoyi did not talk rubbish either, directly issuing Hua Zong a challenge letter to compete in alchemy with him.

In the end, Lu Daoyi won!

His alchemy strength already surpassed Hua Zong all-round!

A grade five heavenly alchemist actually defeated a grade six heavenly alchemist. How could this not make people sigh with admiration?

One had to know that Hua Zong was not an ordinary grade six heavenly alchemist. He could be ranked within the entire sect.

Otherwise, why would he have been accepted by Zuo Chen as a cross-generation disciple?

In order to slap the face of Zuo Chen’s lineage, Wang Lin deliberately spread the news and attracted many sect powerhouses.

In the end, Lu Daoyi shocked the world in one battle, crushing Hua Zong!

Hence, that was why Hua Zong was so ashamed.

Hua Zong’s fists were clenched tightly as he said, “Third Senior Brother, it’s all my fault! If my strength wasn’t lacking, we also wouldn’t be humiliated by people like this!”

Zhu Yan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Striving harder after knowing humiliation is what a real man does!”

Hua Zong clenched his jaws tightly and nodded his head. But Zhu Yan felt a headache too. This situation currently was not easy to resolve! At this time, a voice broke the silence, “Hey, each and every one of you, what are you quarreling about at my residence? You guys, do you still want people to cultivate or not? Do you have any civic-mindedness or not?”

The moment Hua Zong looked, he could not help staying dumbfoundedly, “Little Junior Brother? W-When did you come back?”

With this, everyone’s gazes all looked toward Ye Yuan simultaneously with a whoosh.
