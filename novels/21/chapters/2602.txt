Chapter 2608: Stop Making a Spectacle of Yourselves!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Whoosh!

A bright light rose into the sky.

The expressions of Lin Tong and the rest changed greatly, and they cried out in surprise, “Your Excellency, that person went to report just now. Now, the entire Holy Mountain’s transformation powerhouses probably all know that we’re here!”

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “If they know, then they know; no harm!”

The faces of Lin Tong and the rest turned black, criticizing endlessly in their hearts.

This guy was also too bold, right?

Even several hundred transformation powerhouses could not scare him?

After traveling several more miles, Ye Yuan suddenly stopped.

Lin Tong and the rest were overjoyed, thinking inwardly that this guy finally had a change of mind and was going to run.

However, Ye Yuan circled one round around the few of them and said coolly, “The few of you, don’t leave the circle that I’ve just walked. Otherwise, don’t blame me if you die.”

Lin Tong and the rest had baffled faces. Right at this time, six to seven figures suddenly came from all directions, surrounding Ye Yuan.

The middle-aged man with a scar on his face who was leading, said in a solemn voice, “Punk, to actually dare trespass the Holy Mountain, are you courting death?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I heard that there are transformation powerhouses on Xianyun Mountain. So I wanted to come and have an exchange. I didn’t expect that the person guarding the gates doesn’t know how to speak human language. So I taught him a lesson. How did it become trespassing?”

The man’s expression changed when he heard that and exclaimed in surprise, “What? You defeated Jiang Zhenyu?”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said, “Is it very strange to beat him? Or is it that it’s all the likes of him on this so-called Holy Mountain?”

The muscles on the few people’s faces were all twitching when they heard that!

The likes of him?

When did transformation powerhouses become like that?

“Brat, don’t be arrogant! You, a sect disciple, can you really overturn the heaven on the Holy Mountain? Attack together, kill this boy!” The man with the scar gave a cold yell and rushed up along with the people around him.

Ye Yuan broke the grand array and defeated Jiang Zhenyu forcefully and then trespassed the mountain. The man did not dare to underestimate him.

Hence, he directly called his companions to attack together.

Seven to eight transformation powerhouses rushed forward together, the commotion was quite shocking.

Some took the form of weapons, some took the form of predatory birds, and some took the form of celestial phenomena to attack!

The terrifying power made the faces of Lin Tong and the rest who were not far away to change drastically.

Seven to eight transformation powerhouses, they had never seen it before!

It was just that these people’s transformations were mostly just the Great Dao Transformation of a single rule. It was too weak to stand up to a single blow in Ye Yuan’s eyes and even worse than Jiang Zhenyu.

It was also no wonder that they would be so surprised at him defeating Jiang Zhenyu.

Ye Yuan was rather perplexed. Since these people comprehended Great Dao Transformation, why did the perfection process be so slow?

After he ascended, he had been studying Alchemy Dao most of his time and did not come into contact with Great Dao Transformation people.

No need to talk about Eastward Country, there definitely was not.

Martial Secure Heavenly Sect definitely had, but at least even Lu Zhanyuan that level of powerhouse did not comprehend it.

Luo Yunqing might have comprehended it. It was just that he had never displayed it before.

Hence, Ye Yuan did not have a clear contrast.

He thought that since they could comprehend Great Dao Transformation, their comprehension ability naturally would not be poor.

Even if it was not as good as his, it should also have been perfected in eight to ten years.

In the end, Jiang Zhenyu comprehended for 50 years and did not even fully perfect it.

Therefore, in his eyes, this bunch of people was really unbelievably trash.

He reckoned that they hit the jackpot, that was how they comprehended Great Dao Transformation.

Under the environment of the Land of Exile, it was not necessary to be extremely talented to break through.

Wandering on the edge of life and death countless times, as long as one could kill their way over, even if their talent was slightly poor, they could comprehend it too.

These people might belong to that type.

All in all, Ye Yuan did not face much pressure dealing with the scar-man these few people.

In fact, he did not even need to use two swords at once.

One sword, swimming between the seven to eight people, there was plenty of room for playing the butcher’s knife.

By the side, Lin Tong and the rest were long already dumbstruck with amazement.

They knew that Ye Yuan was strong, but they did not expect that he was so strong!

Fighting one-versus-eight, he was actually still overpowering the other side!

One had to know, Ye Yuan only comprehended Great Dao Transformation for a short three years!

Suddenly, Lin Tong’s expression changed, discovering that there were another over a dozen people flying over here swiftly.

Those people right now were all attracted by Ye Yuan.

Then this batch of powerhouses that came over this time would definitely make them the first target of assault!

“Freaking hell, fight it out!” Xu Weiqing drew his saber and was about to fight it out to the death with this group of people.

Lin Tong suddenly remembered Ye Yuan’s instructions and said, “Old Xu, don’t be impulsive! His Excellency made us stay where we are. He must have some means!!”

Xu Weiqing’s expression turned heavy and he immediately became quiet.

They knew that Ye Yuan had a lot of methods. It was just that they could not understand just what method Ye Yuan had deployed.

“Humph!?A bunch of outside world ants also dare to trespass the Holy Mountain? You’re really tired of living! The few of you, go and die first then!”

An old man in a blue shirt had an extremely vigorous aura, pouncing over towards Lin Tong and the rest.

The three people’s expressions changed greatly, immediately feeling the threat of death.

The moment transformation was released, the imposing aura became completely different.

Even if their cultivation realm was the same, their combat power was vastly different.

But right at this time, the old man in blue shirt suddenly vomited blood, his body falling from midair.

When he fell to the ground, he had actually already breathed his last!

Lin Tong and the rest exchanged glances, all extremely shocked.

“He was poisoned! When did His Excellency … use the poison?” Xu Weiqing said with a look of shock.

Lin Tong pondered for a moment and said, “It should be when he walked a circle around us! What a brilliant method of poisoning, we actually didn’t detect it at all!”

Wei Xiang smiled bitterly and said, “Not just us! These transformation powerhouses, their sensitivity to poison is many times stronger than us! Even they are completely unaware!”

The three people were deeply shocked inwardly.

Only then did they understand why Ye Yuan dared to be so arrogant?

With such means, it was simply overwhelming in this first level!

So what if a transformation-level powerhouse?

Killing you was as easy as blowing off the dust!

It was just that Ye Yuan came here to temper himself, so he was disdainful to use it.

Looking at it this way, Ye Yuan saying to slaughter all the transformation powerhouses on the mountain previously was not empty talk!

Only with confidence did he dare to look down on them.

Sure enough, when the others saw the blue-shirt old man’s bizarre death, each and every one of them did not dare to get close to Lin Tong and the others. They simply rushed toward Ye Yuan together.

More than ten transformation powerhouses surrounded Ye Yuan all at once.

Some of them, their strengths were not weak.

Ye Yuan killed his way in and out of the crowd with one person and one sword and already severely wounded three to four people as if it was a no man’s land!

The so-called Holy Mountain’s powerhouses were akin to toddlers learning how to walk in front of Ye Yuan; very comical.

Without the threat of transformation powerhouses, the minds of Lin Tong and the rest also relaxed, observing the battle carefully.

The more they watched, the more alarmed they got.

“His Excellency is too strong! His opponents are too trashy. They are completely not on the same level at all! Furthermore, His Excellency’s sapling has two leaves, but he only utilized one leaf. So he clearly isn’t using his full strength! Just what kind of a monster did Martial Secure Heavenly Sect produce?” Lin Tong said in horror.

The other two people nodded one after another in deep agreement. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“All withdraw, stop making a spectacle of yourselves!” Right at this time, a voice sounded out.

A handsome youth walked down the mountain.

The group of transformation powerhouses stepped back one after another, their faces full of shame.
