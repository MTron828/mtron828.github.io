Chapter 2085: Sit Back and Wait

Ye Yuan?

Who was Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan was struck silly by Ye Yuan, her brain not wrapping itself around it for a while.

Rather, it was Yang Fei-er who suddenly cried out in surprise. Looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief, she said with a cry of surprise, “Ye Yuan? You ... You’re that young master who Lu-er spoke of ... Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said with a smile, “That’s right. It’s precisely me! Senior Apprentice Sister Fei-er, for the past one thousand years, thank you very much for taking care of Lu-er.”

As he said, Ye Yuan gave a deep bow toward Yang Fei-er, to show his thanks.

This bow, it came from the bottom of Ye Yuan’s heart.

In these 1000 years, if not for Yang Fei-er looking after, Lu-er would probably have died long ago.

Yang Fei-er was full of disbelief and muttered, “This ... how is this possible? Didn’t Junior Apprentice Sister Xun go to find you ... Oh, right! With your strength, how can Junior Apprentice Sister Xun be your match?”

Speaking up until here, Yang Fei-er shook her head with a bitter smile.

They all thought that Ye Yuan was easy to bully, but who could have expected that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually even stronger than Eldest Senior Sister He Xiangyun?!

One had to know, Lu-er’s cultivation speed was already extremely horrifying, cultivating from the Heaven Glimpse Realm to the True God Realm in a thousand over years’ time.

How could Ice Cloud Tower’s people think that her young master’s cultivation talent was even more horrifying than hers?

Although his realm was still clearly lacking, his combat power was off the charts, directly using the power of the fleshy body to crush He Xiangyun, who was a Ninth Firmament True God.

This kind of talent was truly terrifying to the extreme.

More importantly, Ye Yuan was also an unrivaled alchemy master, sweeping across the Northernmost Steppe, making a group of Seven-star Alchemy Gods bow their heads in submission.

The shock in Yang Fei-er’s heart simply could not be any greater.

Was there really such a monstrous genius in this world?

“Y-You’re Ye Yuan!” He Xiangyun used a muffled voice and cried out in surprise.

Although they could not hear what she was saying too clearly, they could hear her fear.

He Xiangyun finally understood why Ye Yuan found fault and directly gave her a few slaps.

It turned out that he was taking revenge for Lu-er!

That target that they could freely knead in their hearts actually appeared in the Northernmost Steppe now, casually kneading them.

This kind of thing made people too unable to accept it.

Just like you saw an ant from afar. Walking in front of it to take a look, turns out that it was a giant.

That kind of terror, this kind of shock, simply could not use words to describe.

“Huhu, also, you! For the past one thousand years, I have to thank you for taking extra care of Lu-er. Of course, stemming from repayment, you can go and die already.”

Ye Yuan pointed a finger out, directly blasting He Xiangyun to dregs, destroyed in body and soul.

At this time, Yang Fei-er finally recovered from the shock, and looked toward Ye Yuan while being somewhat fearful as she said, “Y-You hurry up and bring Lu-er away from here, while Feng Tianyang hasn’t discovered it yet! Not only does he want Lu-er, but he also wants to deal with you. If you let him discover your relationship with Lu-er, he definitely won’t spare you!”

When Yang Fei-er learned of Ye Yuan’s real identity, what she thought about right away was to have them hurry up and escape. The further they ran, the better.

After all, no matter how strong Ye Yuan was, he was also just a True God Realm.

In this Jiu Luo Ji, there were ten Empyrean-level powerhouses.

Once discovered by them, the two of them could forget about escaping.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Leave here? Why leave? If I wanted to leave, I would have left long ago. The reason why I stayed behind is to meet this Feng Tianyang. I want to see what kind of character he is.”

Yang Fei-er even thought that Ye Yuan’s temperament flared up and said anxiously, “Now isn’t the time to be willful. Feng Tianyang’s strength is not what Eldest Senior Sister can compare to. Furthermore, he even brought two Empyrean powerhouses.”

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not answer, but looked at Empyrean Loneswan and said smilingly, “Have you thought about things over? If you’ve thought it through, swear a Heavenly Dao Oath, you only have this one chance.”

Empyrean Loneswan kept quiet by the side the entire time, but in his heart, monstrous waves were similarly stirred up.

Although he did not understand what was going on, he could think of the reason why Ye Yuan suddenly appeared in Jiu Luo Ji; his goal was simply Lu-er!

What a grand scheme!

The entire Jiu Luo Ji’s people were toyed with by Ye Yuan in the palm of his hand!

Especially Empyrean Ice Cloud, she actually even delivered Lu-er over submissively.

If not for seeing with his own eyes, he would not believe even if beaten to death that the entire Northernmost Steppe’s Empyrean powerhouses became Ye Yuan’s tool.

What kind of scheming was this!

What kind of daringness!

What kind of means!

However, Loneswan still could not tell what confidence Ye Yuan had, to dare remain here and provoke Feng Tianyang.

Hang on!

Ye Yuan played such a grand game of chess, so how could he possibly not leave himself a way out?

Thinking all about these, Loneswan was taken aback by the shock.

In this one year plus of living together, he thought that he already understood Ye Yuan very well.

But only today did he discover that his understanding of Ye Yuan was too little!

In fact, he, an Empyrean powerhouse, was unable to imagine just what Ye Yuan’s path of retreat was.

Suddenly, he sucked in a deep breath and made the wisest decision in this life.

“Loneswan is willing to follow Master till death and absolutely not betray! If I violate this oath, Loneswan is willing to accept heaven’s punishment!” Empyrean Loneswan said in a solemn voice.

By the side, Yang Fei-er could not help being struck dumb with amazement.

She felt that the scares that she suffered in this life were not as many as today.

After Empyrean Loneswan knew about Ye Yuan’s real identity, he actually swore a Heavenly Dao Oath and said that he wanted to follow Ye Yuan?

Was ... Was he crazy?

“Smart!” Ye Yuan smiled faintly and threw two jade plates to Loneswan and Yang Fei-er respectively, saying coolly, “In a while, if you encounter danger, just deploy divine essence and shatter the jade plates. It will naturally ensure your safety.”

Empyrean Loneswan’s pupils constricted, thinking to himself that he indeed did not misjudge!

It was just that, could this small piece of jade plate escape from under the noses of ten Empyreans?

That Empyrean Windlike, Empyrean Redfeather, both were Third Firmament Empyrean powerhouses!

... ...

An hour arrived in a flash. Inside Ice Cloud Tower, Feng Tianyang slowly opened both eyes and said coldly, “Looks like he’s refusing a toast only to drink to a forfeit! Looks like this Ji Qingyun hasn’t figured out who has the final say in this land of extreme north!”

By the side, Ice Cloud said with a cold snort, “That kid doesn’t have anyone in his eyes in the first place. He’s someone who won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin! But ... logically speaking, Xiangyun should have also brought him back already. Could it be that Brother Loneswan stood in the way?”

Feng Tianyang curled his mouth and said disdainfully, “I think that this Loneswan is likely muddle-headed with age, to actually acknowledge a True God Realm as his master with the status of an Empyrean! Martial Uncle, let’s go over and take a look. If that Loneswan doesn’t know how to appreciate favors, we don’t mind sending him off!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Empyrean Windlike nodded slightly and slowly followed after.

Seeing Feng Tianyang’s seethe with killing intent, Empyrean Ice Cloud was incomparably delighted in her heart.

She had long found Ye Yuan and Loneswan displeasing to the eyes. This time, she could just nicely borrow a blade and kill people. Erasing these two people, Jiu Luo Ji would have peace and tranquility!

The group of Empyreans and True Gods arrived at Grand Pill Establishment in a threatening manner but discovered that the hall had just experienced a great battle.

While the Grand Pill Establishment was long already void of people.

On the hall’s stone steps, Ye Yuan sat with his ankle on his knee, sitting on a wooden armchair, drinking wine calmly as the wine aroma overflowed.

Empyrean Loneswan and Yang Fei-er two people were standing on the left and right in attendance.
