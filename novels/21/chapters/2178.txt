Chapter 2182: Devilish Monster Appears

The dark thing vanished after a flash, being unimaginably swift, directly shuttling into the void.

The three great Heavenly Emperors were caught by surprise and could not even react in time.

However, Ye Yuan was long prepared, his mouth opening slightly.

“Immobilize!”

Ye Yuan uttered the true word, it was as if time stopped.

That black bug had not escaped yet and was immobilized in midair.

The three great Heavenly Emperor’s eyes went wide, looking at this scene in disbelief, and actually forgot to make a move for a moment.

“Still in a daze for?” Ye Yuan shouted coldly.

Fallen Maple suddenly woke up. Pointing at the void, a powerful restriction directly spread out, thoroughly imprisoning the black bug.

This was an Empyrean level black bug. With Ye Yuan’s strength, it was very hard to bind it. That was why he had Fallen Maple take action.

Ye Yuan’s gaze looked over toward the black bug, but the three great Heavenly Emperors’ gazes stared fixedly at Ye Yuan. It was as if they were looking at a monster.

The impact that the scene just now gave the three of them was seriously too strong!

Time and space froze at the same time!

Even Jun Mingxin was also affected by Ye Yuan’s Time Freeze, his movement being sluggish for an instant.

As for Fallen Maple and Tan Yi, the influence was negligible.

The two of their strength were too powerful.

But this did not hinder their shock!

“Heavenly Dao True Word! It’s actually Heavenly Dao True Word! An Empyrean Realm actually grasped Heavenly Dao True Word!” Fallen Maple sucked in a cold breath and cried out in surprise.

“How can this kid possibly grasped Heavenly Dao True Word?” Tan Yi said in surprise.

“What a formidable Heavenly Dao True Word! Just now, I was actually frozen for a moment!” Jun Mingxin said in shock.

Ye Yuan was still unaware, looking at the black bug, his expression increasingly solemn.

The aura that this black bug emitted, he was very familiar!

“This is ... mn? All looking at me for what?” Ye Yuan turned around and was just about to discuss with the three people, but then he saw that the three people were currently using extremely strange gazes to look at him.

What do you think?

You freaking did such a heaven-defying move and still did not allow us to be surprised?

The three great Heavenly Emperors were rendered speechless.

Invisible posturing was the most lethal!

“Just now, what was that move of yours?” Fallen Maple asked.

Ye Yuan was taken aback and said, “You’re talking about Time Freeze? That’s the dragon race’s innate divine ability! Could it be that Zheng Yufeng didn’t tell you that I’m the Dragon Clan’s Heaven’s Chosen Son?”

Ye Yuan had an appearance of them getting excited over nothing.

Since he threw this title out, he was naturally not some nameless person in the Dragon Clan. Wouldn’t possessing one or two powerful divine abilities be something very normal?

It was just that these people completely did not take his latter identity seriously.

“Time Freeze ... the Dragon Clan’s Heaven’s Chosen Son ...” Fallen Maple muttered under his breath, clearly not knowing what this Heaven’s Chosen Son meant.

The Dragon Clan, this kind of demon race with a supreme bloodline, each one was incomparably mysterious.

In the Heavenspan World, even for Heavenly Emperor major powerhouses, very few could know about the secrets involved.

The title of Second Sage was resounding like the roar of thunder to them, resulting in overlooking the identity of the Dragon Clan’s Heaven’s Chosen Son.

But now, Fallen Maple knew that Heaven’s Chosen Son was absolutely an identity that could rival Second Sage!

Just based on this move!

This person in front of him was truly a monster that was beyond words!

What kind of eyesight did Yue Mengli have? To find such a peerless monster?

With Ye Yuan, who could still enter her eyes?

Thinking up to here, Fallen Maple could not help pitying his disciple.

But Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “This isn’t important! What’s important is that ... this black bug is strange!”

The faces of Fallen Maple and the rest turned stern and asked, “Oh? What’s strange?”

Ye Yuan said, “This thing is called an abyss monster!”

That was right! The aura coming off of this black bug was precisely the aura of an abyss monster!

Ye Yuan did not expect to actually see an abyss monster here.

Weren’t these monsters suppressed in the Dragon Eye Cave by the Dragon Clan’s major powers?

Could it be that ... Li-er got caught in that kind of terrifying place?

Thinking up until here, Ye Yuan wished to fly to the Blackflame Cave immediately.

“Abyss monster? Never heard of this thing before!” Fallen Maple said with a blank face.

Ye Yuan flicked his finger and shot out a streak of sword energy, directly annihilating the black bug, and said in a solemn voice, “You don’t need to know too much. You just have to know that these things are very dangerous, and that will do! Once these things run to the outside world, the people will be plunged into misery and suffering!”

Suppressing abyss monsters was the Dragon Clan’s secret, the outside world did not know at all. Ye Yuan naturally would not spread it either.

But this thing suddenly appeared in the Heavenspan World, so it was clearly not a good omen.

Hearing this, the three people’s expressions were strange. But Ye Yuan already returned to the head of the bed and continued exhibiting the Chaos Heavenly Star Art.

His Chaos Heavenly Star Art was all-inclusive, it could be said to have assembled the major accomplishments of his Alchemy Dao. Using it to shave the bone and heal the injury was naturally a cinch too.

Under the Chaos Heavenly Star Art, everything had nowhere to hide. Only then did Ye Yuan discover that this little abyss bug actually hid inside Zhuo Yuanzhi’s sea of consciousness, being extremely covert.

It was also no wonder that Tan Yi, this Eight-star Alchemy God, did not discover it.

After a day and night, Zhuo Yuanzhi’s decaying body actually started to slowly take a turn for the better.

That feeble aura of his actually slowly rose again too.

When Tan Yi saw this scene, his eyes became wide saucers!

“What an overbearing alchemy technique, to actually have such a miraculous effect! No wonder! No wonder Sacred Ancestor High Priest that kind of powerhouse actually viewed him in a different light, and he bestowed him the title of Second Sage!”

Another two days passed, Zhuo Yuanzhi finally slowly opened his eyes.

Seeing this strange man in front of him, Zhuo Yuanzhi felt as if he was dreaming.

“Zhuo Yuanzhi, let me ask you. How is Li-er doing now?” The moment Zhuo Yuanzhi woke up, Ye Yuan was too impatient to wait and asked.

Zhuo Yuanzhi clearly had not woken up from the nightmarish state yet as he murmured, “L-Li-er?”

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “It’s Yue Mengli! Didn’t you guys enter the Blackflame Cave together? Where is she now? Is she still alive?”

Zhuo Yuanzhi’s eyes gradually focused, akin to waking up from a dream.

He struggled to recall the situation at that time, his gaze gradually becoming frightened.

“Ahh! Don’t come over! Don’t come over! I ... I’ll kill you all!”

Zhuo Yuanzhi seemed to have recalled some terrifying scene, his entire person became crazed, and he suddenly struck a palm out.

A terrifying force erupting at such a small distance, it could be seen how horrifying the power was.

But while he was quick, Ye Yuan was faster!

Zhuo Yuanzhi’s force had not spat out yet, but Ye Yuan reached first despite launching later, pointing a finger out, directly restraining him.

Then, an extremely powerful soul force burrowed into Zhuo Yuanzhi’s sea of consciousness domineeringly.

“Ye Yuan, what are you trying to do?” Fallen Maple said in alarm and anger. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Casting soul search, the damage to a person was irreversible.

But this scenario happened too suddenly. It was already too late for them to want to stop it.

Interrupting Ye Yuan at this time, it would be even more hopeless to salvage the situation for Zhuo Yuanzhi.

“Shut up! He’ll be fine!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Following that, one scene after another surfaced in Ye Yuan’s mind.

After essence, energy, and spirit became one, Ye Yuan’s divine soul strength became even more condensed and powerful.

Under the circumstances of Zhuo Yuanzhi being unconscious, Ye Yuan searching his divine soul would not cause harm.

Except, this scene in the view of Fallen Maple and the rest was something inconceivable.
