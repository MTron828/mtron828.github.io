Chapter 1913: Grand Completion Dao Realm

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Inside the hidden chamber, light revolved around.

Bai Chen let go of his whole divine soul and also fully released the Dao that he comprehended.

Ye Yuan’s soul force spread out, carefully sensing the secrets within Bai Chen’s body.

This kind of state had been ongoing for more than a month.

Every day, Ye Yuan would investigate until his soul force was depleted.

Suddenly, the light converged, and inside the hidden chamber things returned to tranquility.

“Master! Are you alright?”

Seeing the Ye Yuan who was tired until he was virtually collapsing, Bai Chen hurriedly went up to support him.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “I’m fine. Just that I used too much strength today.”

“Master, let’s forget it! It’s simply impossible for people who refined Dao Fruits to advance anymore.”

When Bai Chen saw Ye Yuan being dog-tired every day, he was moved, but he really could not bear it in his heart.

The crux was that this matter was simply a futile effort.

Since time immemorial, how many major powers wanted to break this shackle. But no one was able to succeed.

Disregarding what was far away, just talking about the present era, there was still an Alchemy Dao supreme existence around, but it was also unheard of that he could create this kind of medicinal pill.

Bai Chen naturally knew that Ye Yuan was formidable, but this kind of unprecedented thing, it was truly not what the word formidable could accomplish.

Ye Yuan looked at Bai Chen and said smilingly, “Could it be that you’re willing to stop in front of the True God Realm in this life?”

Bai Chen said with an indignant look, “I’m naturally unwilling. It’s just that ... seeing Master exhaust your soul force for me every day, Bai Chen feels that I’ve let Master down. The road back then was chosen by me. I know that I’m being somewhat hypocritical now, but I can’t control myself.”

Bai Chen understood that Ye Yuan’s time was too valuable.

Wasting his time made Bai Chen feel grievously sinful.

If hope could be seen in this matter, it was still alright, but it was clearly a hopeless endeavor. If he spent several years, even several decades’ time but returned without accomplishing anything. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This kind of loss was simply immeasurable.

Ye Yuan said, “If there’s unwillingness, then it’s good. Under the operation of Heavenly Dao, there are no absolutes. Back then, the small world that Master was in, Heavenly Dao dwindled to zero. No one could step into the Deity Realm for more than 100 thousand years. But even so, Master also blazed a new trail and entered Great Dao with alchemy, finally entering Deity Realm.”

Bai Chen sucked in a cold breath when he heard that and said in amazement, “Turns out that master was actually born in a small world too? Entering Great Dao with alchemy ... truly incredible!”

He was presently Sky Foothill World’s controller and naturally knew what Heavenly Dao signified.

Heavenly Dao missing Divine Dao, no matter how monstrous your talent was, it was also impossible to step into Deity Realm.

But his master did it!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There are no absolutes in the world, what you see with your eyes might not be the truth. Back then, if I gave up on Divine Dao because Heavenly Dao dwindled to zero, there also wouldn’t be the present me.”

Bai Chen drew a deep breath and said with a nod, “Master, I understand! I won’t give up!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The reason why one can’t advance after refining a Dao Fruit is that the Dao you refined isn’t your Dao1! Other people’s comprehensions are other people’s in the end. Even if you refine them, that’s also other people’s lifetime comprehension. That’s like wearing clothes. What you wear is clothing tailor-made for others, no matter what, you can’t possibly fit into it completely too. It’s also precisely because of this that your divine soul and your physical body can’t completely conform to other people’s Dao as well.”

Bai Chen thought about it and said, “But this kind of thing is too abstruse. Divine soul, physical body, Dao Fruit; three things completely becoming one, can it really be achieved?”

Heavenly Dao was abstruse, the physical body and divine soul were similarly abstruse.

Great Dao revolved, but the human body was also a small world that revolved according to some kind of law.

Martial artists cultivating, most knew how but did not know the whys.

Wanting to pry into the mysteries of the human body was an extremely difficult thing to begin with, let alone even having to make these three completely fit together?

Since remote antiquity, how many alchemists had attempted to breach this gap, but no one was able to succeed.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not trying, how would one know? I have a feeling that once the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill succeeds, my Alchemy Dao strength will definitely improve further!”

...

Ye Yuan used a full three years to probe Bai Chen’s body.

In these three years, Ye Yuan could be said to have exhausted himself and racked his brain, completely depleting his soul force every day because he was willing to stop.

The current Ye Yuan seemed to have returned to when he was studying the Dao Defying Pill back then, his entire person insane.

Bai Chen also finally experienced Ye Yuan’s craziness.

Only then did he knew that for Ye Yuan to be able to have today’s accomplishments, it was not coincidental.

Other people all said that Ye Yuan’s talent was high, but did not know how much hard work he put in behind.

It was just that this kind of frenzied probing was not what ordinary martial artists could stomach.

Bai Chen felt that if it were him, investigating the body’s mysteries with such intensity, he would probably have long gone mad.

Without astonishing willpower, it was simply impossible to accomplish.

Three years later, Ye Yuan suddenly told Bai Chen that he was entering closed-seclusion and disappeared.

Inside the World Suppressing Stele, Ye Yuan sat cross-legged in front of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

“Senior, just what is the divine soul?” Ye Yuan suddenly asked.

Through three years of probing, Ye Yuan discovered that wanting to create the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill, the crux still lied with the divine soul.

And in this aspect, Dustless undoubtedly had the greatest right to speak.

Dustless said, “This question, no one can answer clearly. However, humans can’t exist without the soul. The divine soul can exist independently in this world, but the physical body can’t break away from the existence of the divine soul. It’s a kind of mysterious mental energy, connecting the physical body and Heavenly Dao. Martial artists can cultivate Dao because the divine soul can communicate with Heavenly Dao. If one has to insist on saying what it is, I feel that ... it’s the extension of Heavenly Dao.”

“The extension of Heavenly Dao ...” Ye Yuan ruminated on Dustless’s words, his mind starting to sink into the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

“Myriad lives have intelligence and are a part of Heavenly Dao.”

“The physical body is a dead substance without the soul. Grass and wood are dead objects without spirit.”

“If say that the divine soul is a line, this end connects to material, that end is anchored to Heavenly Dao ...”

“...”

Gradually, a trace of enlightenment was born in Ye Yuan’s heart.

Above the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, the aura of Dao gradually grew thicker.

Ye Yuan’s divine soul left the body and flew above the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

Gradually, his figure became illusory, becoming countless light dots, and finally, completely dissipating!

In this area of space, the existence of Ye Yuan’s divine soul could no longer be seen.

But sensing carefully, it was as if his divine soul was omnipresent.

Seeing this scene, Dustless’s pupils constricted slightly as he cried out in surprise, “This kid gained epiphany again! Soul fusing into Dao, feeling the source of Great Dao, even Empyreans can’t accomplish it too!”

A hundred years passed in a twinkle. On this day, Ye Yuan slowly opened his eyes, his gaze incomparably deep.

Divine soul returning to position, Ye Yuan felt an inflating feeling within his body, he was actually going to break through.

Thoughts stirring, countless middle-grade divine essence stones appeared around Ye Yuan.

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan started absorbing divine essence frenziedly.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan finally reached Seventh Firmament Divine Vestige in one stroke!

“Dao Realm is at grand completion! Wonder when can I step into that fleeting and ephemeral Ancestor Realm!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.
