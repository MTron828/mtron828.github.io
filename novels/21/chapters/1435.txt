Chapter 1439 Devastation to Both Sides!

“Bai Rong!”

“Elder Bai Rong!”

Bai Xiu and Bai Chen virtually cried out at the same time.

Bai Xiu’s gaze even turned bloodshot from anger, his two eyes blood-red.

However, Bai Xiu’s eyes were currently going lax. How terrifying was Qin Tian’s Sword Dao laws? After entering the body, it destroyed all of Bai Rong’s vitality very quickly.

But at this time, the Nether Ghostclaw also fell toward Qin Tian. It was already too late for him to want to draw his sword.

But Qin Tian did not panic in the face of danger. Left hand forming fingers as a sword, powerful Sword Dao laws directly tapped onto the Nether Ghostclaw.

It was just that he was currently responding in a haste and not the Nether Ghostclaw’s match at all.

But Qin Tian’s strength was too powerful. With this drawing the bow with the left and right, his imposing momentum was still equally matched with the Nether Ghostclaw!

Not being able to kill Bai Xiu, Qin Tian was secretly rather regretful.

After all, Bai Xiu was the person with the greatest strength apart from Gui Yun.

But being able to finish off one could at least diminish the other party’s combat strength.

But right at this moment, Qin Tian’s alarm bells sounded. A fierce killing intent erupted without any warning.

Swift as a thought!

All this happened in an instant. Qin Tian had both hands preoccupied and was unable to care about other things anymore at this time.

This attack appeared too craftily. The timing of the opportunity was grasped too timely. It was simply a certain kill situation!

The scent of death hit him head-on. Qin Tian was already unable to save himself and could only muster up the divine essence within his body crazily, protecting his whole body.

“Chasing Moon!”

The sharp Evil Extermination Sword was seemingly like a meteor, stabbing straight for Qin Tian’s stomach!

The power of this sword was actually a magnitude stronger than Sundering Stars.

From Ye Yuan mobilizing to stabbing onto Qin Tian’s body, it was only a twinkle, the movement swift to the extreme. Everyone did not have the time to react to it at all.

Boom!

This sword move made a showy display of ability. It was as if a sharp knife that could pierce myriad objects in the world.

The Evil Extermination Sword passed through Qin Tian’s protective divine essence without any surprises, stabbing Qin Tian’s body.

“Puhwark!”

Qin Tian’s entire body was akin to being electrocuted, fresh blood spraying wildly from his mouth, his body flying out horizontally, smashing ruthlessly into the rock wall.

“Gui Yun!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed and he shouted fiercely.

Gui Yun understood tacitly. Deploying the Nether Ghostclaw, he smacked straight for the rock wall!

Boom!

The rock wall directly had a large pit smashed out. The life and death of the Qin Tian inside, it was unknown.

“Go!”

Ye Yuan bellowed and was about to bring everyone towards the depths of the Divine Ruins.

But right at this time, Bai Xiu suddenly went berserk, his figure speeding toward that rock wall’s hole rapidly.

“Damn intruder! I’ll kill you!” Bai Xiu roared as he flew speedily.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed. Figure swaying, he attempted to intercept Bai Xiu from the side.

“Bai Xiu, calm down!” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

Bai Xiu did not have the slightest intention of stopping. Looking at Ye Yuan with both eyes bloodshot, he said sharply, “You damn intruder, get lost for me!”

Bai Xiu raised his hand and it was a palm smacking over toward Ye Yuan!

But right at this time, a swift and fierce sword light rushed out of the rock wall without any warning signs.

But Gui Yun deployed the Nether Ghostclaw and intercepted this sword light.

Boom!

Bang!

At virtually the same time, Bai Xiu’s palm landed on Ye Yuan’s body, while the Nether Ghostclaw forcefully resisted this sword light.

Ye Yuan and Gui Yun simultaneously flew backward in two very different directions!

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan’s internal organs quivered, directly spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood.

While Gui Yun’s body became much fainter. The Nether Ghostclaw could not sustain either, vanishing.

Whoosh!

Gui Yun turned into a cloud of green smoke and flew into Ye Yuan’s body, escaping into the Soul Suppressing Pearl.

In an instant, Ye Yuan and Gui Yun were seriously injured at the same time!

Bai Xiu’s entire body trembled, only then, abruptly startling awake.

If not for Ye Yuan, he would already be a dead soul under Qin Tian’s sword now.

That sword of Ye Yuan’s only severely wounded Qin Tian and did not really cause irreversible injuries to him. He still had the strength to fight back.

Hence, that was why Ye Yuan made them leave right away.

“Bai Xiu, you’re crazy! What the hell are you doing?!”

When Bai Chen saw this scene, he roared at Bai Xiu.

Bai Xiu was a late-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses. How terrifying was the power of this palm?

If not for Bai Xiu pulling back the majority of the force at the last moment, Ye Yuan might even be killed by him with one palm.

“Master Ye Yuan, are ... are you alright?”

Bai Chen’s voice was almost in tears.

Ye Yuan clutched his chest and said with difficulty, “Leave ... Quickly leave!”

Mo Yun gritted his teeth and barked at Bai Xiu, “Still in a daze for what?!”

Bai Xiu shook, bringing along Bai Rong’s corpse, and headed over towards the Divine Ruins’ depths.

Mo Yun also brought along the heavily injured Ye Yuan and sprinted wildly all the way.

Fortunately, they did not encounter any dangers along the way. The group of people ran wildly, no idea how long they ran either. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, everyone felt a blur, dashing out of a cave.

“So ... So many doors, where should we go?” Bai Chen said with a panicky face.

“If not, let’s turn back!” Someone suggested.

“No ... No way!” Ye Yuan forcefully endured his churning vital energy and blood and said.

On the way, Ye Yuan swallowed healing medicinal pills. His injuries were already brought under control.

But his internal organs were still in upheaval, It was as if they had shifted positions. Within a short time, he was unable to take action anymore.

Ye Yuan patted Mo Yun’s shoulder, signaling him to put him down.

“We’ve already entered an array formation. The original caves have already been completely displaced. These eight doors, only one is a life door. The others are ... certain death!” Ye Yuan said.

Everyone’s faces changed!

One out of eight!

This ... The chance of death was too great.

“This ... What to do? Aren’t we at death’s door right now?”

“Previously, panicking and not choosing the path, we entered here bafflingly!”

“It’s all Bai Xiu’s fault! If not for him, we wouldn’t be in such a difficult position either!”

“This guy simply can’t distinguish right from wrong! How can Bai Rong’s death be blamed on Grand Elder? From start to end, he never opened his mouth to ask us for help before!”

...

For a moment, everyone tried to get a word in, all pointing the spearhead at Bai Xiu.

Bai Xiu’s expression flickered incessantly but did not refute. Instead, he was full of guilt.

Thud!

Bai Xiu flushed red and directly knelt down towards Ye Yuan.

“Grand Elder, it was all Bai Xiu being foolish, causing you and Lord Grand Elder to be heavily injured! I ... I’ll ... apologize for the sin with death!”

Bai Xiu gritted his teeth. Raising his hand, he smacked down towards the top of his head.

“Stop!”

Ye Yuan had sharp eyes and agile hands, grabbing hold of his wrist.

“Cough, cough, cough ... Pffft!”

This affected his injuries, Ye Yuan spouted out a mouthful of blood again.

Bai Xiu’s expression changed greatly, hurriedly supporting Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan said with sullen anger, “You fool! Right now, among us, you’re the strongest one! If you die, what are they going to do?”

Bai Xiu choked up, the thought of suicide immediately dissipating.

Seeing the situation, Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Qin Tian infiltrating the Sky Foothill World was aiming for me. Bai Rong’s death was indeed caused by me. You and Bai Rong were on very close terms, I know that his death was a great blow to you. If it were me, I’ll probably be even more enraged than you. This matter ... wasn’t your fault!”
