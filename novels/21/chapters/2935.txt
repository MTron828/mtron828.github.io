Chapter 2934: The Powerful Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!

“Explode! Explode! Explode!”

Qin Shitian’s soul force poured out frenziedly, and one Star Soul Explosion after another exploded next to Ye Yuan.

But, apart from his body being a little distorted, Ye Yuan did not show the slightest signs of dissipating.

Qin Shitian’s heart was wildly shaking. Could it be that this guy was really of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique?

“Ten wroughts, our genius only has this bit of strength? If it’s just this bit of strength, you aren’t even qualified to make me turn into mist form!”

Amidst the Soul Star Explosions came Ye Yuan’s ridiculing voice.

At this time, he felt the power of the soul body!

Got to say, Qin Shitian’s attack was already extremely strong.

If an Emperor Realm powerhouse did not defend in the slightest, allowing Qin Shitian to cast his spell as he wished, he would also have to die with regrets at this time.

But Ye Yuan did not even utilize soul force at all, and Qin Shitian could not breach his soul body too.

This soul physique’s toughness was terrifyingly strong!

Finally, Qin Shitian suddenly rescinded his move.

The first move, he lost!

Ye Yuan’s soul body recovered back to new. It was as if nothing had happened just now.

With this, everyone was shocked!

Even Great Emperor Eastsun felt the power of Ye Yuan’s soul body too.

This kind of toughness, even if it was ten wroughts, it was impossible to achieve it too.

“I absolutely don’t believe that you can awaken the Imperishable Soul Physique!”

Qin Shitian virtually roared it out, the soul force on his body skyrocketing once more!

The killing move that erupted this time was even stronger than Star Soul Explosion!

It was just that sadly, he was still unable to hurt Ye Yuan.

Qin Shitian had a lot of means. He unleashed nine moves in a row, each move stronger than the last.

It was just that sadly, Ye Yuan’s soul physique was like a roly-poly. No matter how strong your means, you could not knock him down too.

Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, the strongest form was to turn into mist.

But Qin Shitian unleashed nine moves in a row, and Ye Yuan did not even release his mist form at all.

The Nirvana Soul Hall’s powerhouses were shocked.

“So strong! Is … this the Imperishable Soul Physique?”

“There’s no weakness to exploit at all! Qin Shitian’s ten wroughts soul body coupled with killing moves can virtually rival Emperor Realm powerhouses already. But it’s actually unable to even make him use the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!”

“Such a freakish soul body, who can kill him?”

… …

It was not that Qin Shitian was not wrong, but that Qin Shitian was too strong!

It was precisely because he was strong until it was shocking that it showed the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique’s power even more!

At this time, they already pretty much believed that what Ye Yuan awakened was probably really the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique.

Nine moves failed, while Qin Shitian himself was dog-tired.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There’s still one move. If you still can’t kill me, I’m going to make a move.”

Qin Shitian clenched his jaws hard and said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, don’t you get cocky! This tenth move, I’ll definitely make you regret it! Speaking of which, I have to thank you too. If not for you, I also wouldn’t have achieved mastery through comprehensive study of my previous killing moves, comprehending this sub-origin soul martial move!”

It was only to see a bright moon slowly rising in Qin Shitian’s hand.

The aura of Dao filled the entire space.

When everyone saw this scene, each of them was extremely shocked. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Sub-origin soul martial! This is the embryonic form of an origin soul martial!”

“How can this guy be so monstrous? Once he reaches Emperor Sakra Heaven, this move will be able to transform into an origin soul martial.”

“As long as he’s given time, he’ll definitely be able to become Hegemon!”

… …

When human race powerhouses comprehended the power of origin, they would create divine abilities.

Meanwhile, what soul race powerhouses comprehended was origin soul martials!

Qin Shitian had not comprehended an origin yet. It was naturally impossible to comprehend an origin soul martial.

But the sub-origin soul martial this time already touched the level of Dao. Comprehending origin in the future was just taking something out of his bag.

Being able to reach this step at True Sovereign Heaven, Qin Shitian was absolutely a genius among geniuses already.

Hence, that was why people would be so surprised.

The hall entrance assessment this time was really where developments of many things kept reaching new heights, all kinds of surprises emerging in endless streams!

Ye Yuan felt the extraordinariness of this move too and said with a smile, “This move is a little interesting!”

Qin Shitian smiled coldly and said, “A little interesting? Ye Yuan, I admit that your soul physique is very powerful. But the final victory will definitely be me! Moon Akin to Frost, annihilate for me!”

There was no earth-shaking soul force undulation. Under the moonlight, the frost was akin to silver, cascading down, covering Ye Yuan’s soul body fully.

This time, Ye Yuan’s soul body finally had a change!

His soul body actually started to disintegrate and dissipate!

When everyone saw this scene, each one of them was extremely shocked.

Qin Shitian actually really did it!

The current Ye Yuan seemed to have been decomposed into billions of pixels, his soul body shattering into pieces.

Sub-origin soul martial already came into contact with Soul Dao Origin, it had boundless power.

But very soon, those fragmented pieces of soul body actually started to turn into mist.

A cloud of mist began to emerge.

The misty air did not dissipate but headed towards that bright moon.

The frost was still raining down, but under the propulsion of the misty air, it did not have any leeway to resist at all.

Boom!

Suddenly, the bright moon dissipated. Qin Shitian gave a muffled groan, his soul body becoming much dimmer too.

Following that, the mist condensed again, turning into Ye Yuan.

Qin Shitian’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He lost!

Completely defeated!

His Moon Akin to Frost had already touched origin, but it was still unable to do anything to Ye Yuan.

“This move is decent, but it’s also merely just decent. That’s all. I don’t know whether or not my soul physique is the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, but I think it’s sufficient to deal with this move of yours. Then, following that, it’s my turn to make a move!”

Ye Yuan looked straight at Qin Shitian and just did so, looking.

How could Qin Shitian be willing to surrender without resistance? He was even waiting to make a move and fight back.

But he suddenly discovered that he could not move anymore.

His consciousness began to blur.

His soul body began to dissipate.

All around, each and every one of the Nirvana Soul Hall’s powerhouses felt their hair stand on end.

Ye Yuan just looked at Qin Shitian like this and did not even see him make any movements at all.

Just one look, Qin Shitian’s ten wroughts soul body began to dissipate!

Everyone drew a breath of cold air. That was a ten wroughts soul body!

The legendary ten wroughts actually could not even beat a single look?

“ARGHH!!”

Qin Shitian let out a miserable scream, but his voice became weaker and weaker, turning into nothingness in the end.

The entire Nirvana Soul Hall was quiet until the sound of a pin dropping could be heard.

“Lord Hall Master, tell me, is this soul physique of mine the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique or not?” Ye Yuan asked Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique rather curiously.

Actually, until now, he also did not dare to confirm whether or not it was the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique.

The latter was startled. Only then he returned to his senses and said with a bitter smile, “This, this seat really doesn’t know. Hegemon Imperishable, that’s a figure in the heavens. This seat has no way of knowing about the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique’s characteristics too. It’s just that judging from the form, it’s indeed exactly like in the legends!”

He drew a deep breath and said, “This matter is by no means insignificant. Lord Young Hegemon should cultivate in the Nirvanic Soul Hall. This seat will immediately send the news back to the clan and request the powerhouses in the clan to confirm.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Alright. Then I’ll have to trouble Lord Hall Master.”

Watching Ye Yuan leave, everyone’s hearts were still incredibly shocked.

No matter whether or not Ye Yuan was of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, the strength of this soul physique was hair-raisingly strong!
