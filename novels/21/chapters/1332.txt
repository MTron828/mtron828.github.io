Chapter 1336: Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!

“Impossible! With your strength, how can you possibly be those three old fellows’ match? I don’t believe it!”

Feng Ping’s gaze turned intent. Clearly, he did not believe Ye Yuan’s words.

He was more inclined to believe that Ye Yuan escaped the three of their pursuits and fled back to Jewelhill City.

Clearly, this explanation was much more reasonable.

But Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “The reality is, I’m standing here right now, while their soul lamps are already extinguished, haven’t they? Wang Yuxiang will know whether the three of them were finished off or not if he goes to the Yin Wind Den to inquire.”

Wang Yuxiang was destined to leave with hope and return full of disappointment.

Messing with the Wang Family’s people if he had nothing to do was also pretty good.

When talking up to here, Yang Rui also could not resist looking toward Ye Yuan, his gaze carrying some astonishment and confusion.

He also could not figure out how in the world Ye Yuan, an initial-stage Grotto Profound rookie, finished off those three great elders of the Wang Family.

Those three people were all Grotto Profound Deity Realm’s peak powerhouses already. Under Heaven Glimpse, virtually no one was their match.

Unless Ye Yuan had Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm strength, otherwise, it was very hard to dispose of all three of them.

Moreover, they even brought a large group of the Wang Family’s experts.

When he asked Luo Jian, Luo Jian was also vague and did not speak in detail. This made Yang Rui even more uncertain.

In Yang Rui’s eyes, this guest alchemist became more and more mysterious.

But what assured him was that Ye Yuan’s conduct drew a clear demarcation between whom or what to hate or love.

Even under the situation where Luo Jian was heavily injured and dying, he did not escape alone either.

Everyone said that time revealed a man’s heart. In these ten years, Ye Yuan’s actions and conduct were all in his sights.

Since that was the case, then the more powerful Ye Yuan was, it was naturally not some bad thing for the Myriad Treasure Tower.

“Sigh, Elder Feng, you and I have worked together for many years but didn’t expect that ... there would actually come such a day!” Yang Rui heaved a sigh and said.

Feng Ping snorted coldly and said, “Yeah! I slogged for the Myriad Treasure Tower all my life, but I didn’t think that what it exchanged for was this conclusion! Only see the newcomers smile, but don’t hear the old-timers cry! Heh heh.”

“Why does Elder Feng say this? Even though this tower lord puts Ye Yuan in an important position, I touched my heart and feel that I didn’t neglect you, right? Regardless of whether it is spirit medicines or salary, the Myriad Treasure Tower has never owed you before!” Yang Rui said.

“Humph! Now that it came to this, no need to say anymore! Want to kill or dismember, it’s up to your preference!” Feng Ping snorted coldly and said.

When Yang Rui saw that Feng Ping refused to listen to reason, he could not resist letting out a long sigh.

He also did not expect that, in the end, it would actually end up with such a conclusion.

Yang Rui heaved a sigh and said, “Luo Jian!”

Luo Jian received the order, his figure shooting out like a ghost.

“Ahh! Yang Rui, you ... you’ll die a horrible death!” Feng Ping cried out miserably.

Yang Rui still did not kill Feng Ping in the end, but wasted his divine sea, making him become a cripple.

Luo Jian escorted Feng Ping again. Yang Rui looked at Ye Yuan with an apologetic look and said, “Young Friend Ye Yuan, this time, I’ve made you suffer a shock! I didn’t expect that my Myriad Treasure Tower actually produced a traitor. This was Yang’s oversight, nearly causing a great disaster! This Yang apologizes to Young Friend Ye Yuan here.”

At this point, Yang Rui would not think that Ye Yuan was still that cripple who needed to seek help from the Myriad Treasure Tower anymore.

Being able to annihilate the Wang Family’s three great elders, no matter what kind of trump card Ye Yuan had, he very likely already had means to protect himself.

This trump card could even pose a threat to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouse!

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Tower Lord’s words regard me too much as an outsider! This matter was all Feng Ping’s fault, what has it got to do with Tower Lord? To really say sorry, that should also this Ye saying that. If not for this Ye, the Myriad Treasure Tower would not have gone so far as to have such a matter happen as well.”

Yang Rui waved his hand and said, “Young Friend, you don’t need to be like this. Feng Ping has always been the Myriad Treasure Tower’s chief alchemist, with a high position and heavy authority. Hence, his nature was not exposed as well. Even without you, he’ll be a hidden danger of the Myriad Treasure Tower eventually, with us not knowing when he’ll erupt!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then I’ll have to thank Tower Lord very much! Tower Lord’s grace towards this Ye is as weighty as a mountain. This Ye has no other strengths, only alchemy is passable. How about this, I’ll refine a batch of divine-grade medicinal pills. Tower Lord can use this as a gimmick and attract Jewelhill City’s martial artists.”

Yang Rui was overjoyed the moment he heard and said with a laugh, “Then I’ll have to trouble Young Friend!”

Talking with smart people was effortless. Feng Ping being a cripple, Yang Rui still had to report this matter to upstairs, and request upstairs to send an alchemist over again.

In this period, he would naturally need Ye Yuan to take charge of the overall situation.

Actually, even if upstairs sent a Two-star Alchemy God over, he would not be as effective as Ye Yuan either.

Could Two-star Alchemy Gods refine divine-grade medicinal pills?

After all, Jewelhill City this kind of county, Grotto Profound Deity Realm martial artists and mortals were the population.

...

In the following period of time, Jewelhill City entered a relatively peaceful period.

Outside of expectations, the Wang Family maintained great restraint after sustaining such heavy losses.

As for the Myriad Treasure Tower, they ushered in a period of rapid development.

The rolling out of divine-grade medicinal pills raised Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s reputation to the highest level.

Of course, divine-grade medicinal pills were not what ordinary people could afford to consume. Even if it was the lowest-level Tier 1 low-grade divine pill.

But this did not hinder the rise of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s reputation!

This period of time, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s business virtually skyrocketed, snatching away more than half of the three great families’ business all at once.

The Myriad Treasure Tower’s glory was unparalleled.

While Ye Yuan himself entered closed-seclusion after preparing sufficient quantities of medicinal pills.

His cultivation had already stagnated for very long. Previously, there was always no time to increase cultivation. Now that all of the dangers were already resolved, he could finally settle down and think about the direction of his cultivation in the days to come.

“Boy, you have to think clearly! Comprehending heaven and earth laws on the World Suppressing Stele and creating a cultivation method that belongs to yourself, this is a prolonged process! Maybe, you can comprehend a heaven-defying cultivation method, maybe ... you’ll waste massive amounts of time!”

Inside the World Suppressing Stele, Dustless was doing his final urging.

After all, the cultivation method that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove left behind was already very heaven-defying. It could be cultivated all the way to peak Empyrean. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This was a shortcut, but Ye Yuan refused to take it and insisted on taking a path of no return.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was firm as he said, “Senior, you don’t need to persuade me anymore! I said before back when we were at the Immortal Grove Region, that I want to walk a path that belongs to me. No matter ... how arduous this path is!”

Dustless had been with Ye Yuan for a long time and had also figured out Ye Yuan’s temperament, and knew that saying anymore was useless.

He could only let out a long sigh and said, “You, this fellow, just like to walk one path till the end! I want to see whether or not you can also be heaven-defying in martial arts!”

Rumble ...

Inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space, an enormous mountain rose straight from the ground, charging straight to the clouds!

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, a surge of unfathomable aura hit him head-on.

It turned out that this was the World Suppressing Stele’s main body!

“Ugh ...”

Ye Yuan could not resist using divine sense to probe this large mountain a little, but he was struck by a tremendous force, instantly making his divine soul sustain serious injuries.

“You, this punk, really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! The Great Dao concepts contained in this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain are sufficient to exterminate Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, and you actually dared to offend it!” Dustless said.
