Chapter 2079: Despaired Ice Cloud

In front of Empyrean Ice Cloud Tower, Second Senior Sister Yang Fei-er said anxiously, “Master, our Ice Cloud Tower has already not had gotten new medicinal pills for the greater part of this year. At present, the medicinal pills reserves are already less than 10%!”

He Xiangyun smiled and said, “Junior Apprentice Sister, what are you anxious about? In this Northernmost Steppe, what can stump Master?”

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s face was cold as frost as she said coolly, “Humph! That boy thinks that by relying on a mere Grand Pill Establishment, he can boycott our Ice Cloud Tower? Ttruly overestimating his own ability! Although the Northernmost Steppe respects alchemists, the ones who know how to refine pills aren’t just one Loneswan alone!”

“Huhu, that boy has just arrived. How can he understand Master’s means?” He Xiangyun continued buttering up.

But actually, she was still somewhat unhappy in her heart.

She was presently already Ninth Firmament True God and already not far from grand completion True God Realm.

He Xiangyun heard that Master Ji’s ability was remarkable and could even refine a divine-grade Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill.

If she could obtain one, wouldn’t she be able to corroborate her Dao and take the seat of an Empyrean?

There was just this one shop in this Northernmost Steppe!

Yet, her master offended him. Now, being boycotted by him, this thoroughly throttled her trace of hope to break through to become an Empyrean.

He Xiangyun understood her potential. It was likely that the grand completion True God Realm was her limit.

As for Empyrean, this step was far too difficult!

In this greater part of a year, Empyrean Ice Cloud ran everywhere and finally managed to fix up a contract with Northday Assemble’s Empyrean Dragonjade. They agreed to provide Ice Cloud Tower with medicinal pills.

While it was a little troublesome, it was not to the point of having no medicinal pills.

Thinking up to here, Empyrean Ice Cloud’s expression eased up slightly and she said coolly, “Mn, counting the time, the first batch of medicinal pills should already be almost arriving. No need to worry too much. Rather, that lass Xun’s side has no news whatsoever until now. Could some accident have happened?”

He Xiangyun smiled and said, “Master is worrying too much. A mere imperial city, what formidable character can it produce? Rather, it might be that Junior Apprentice Sister Xun couldn’t find the person. That’s why it delayed some time.”

Empyrean Ice Cloud nodded her head slightly, also feeling that it was not too likely.

But by the side, Yang Fei-er’s pretty face changed slightly. If Junior Apprentice Sister Xun brought that Yang Fei-er back, Little Junior Sister would definitely be forced to give in.

The few people were currently chatting when suddenly, Empyrean Ice Cloud’s thoughts stirred. Only to see her spit divine essence, a powerful virtual image appeared in the great hall.

Seeing the person, a trace of a smile finally appeared on Empyrean Ice Cloud’s ten-thousand-year-ice face.

“Brother Dragonjade, how have you been?! Suddenly coming to find Ice Cloud, could it be that the first batch of medicinal pills we agreed upon is arriving?” Ice Cloud said smilingly.

This virtual image was shockingly a wisp of Empyrean Dragonjade’s divine sense.

Dragonjade smiled and said, “Younger Sister Ice Cloud, this Empyrean is finding you to let you know that our cooperation probably can’t carry on anymore. As for the deposit that you paid in advance, this Empyrean will send someone to return it in due time. Alright, this Empyrean still has something, goodbye!”

“Wait, Brother Dragonjade ...”

Empyrean Dragonjade completely ignored Empyrean Ice Cloud. His virtual image gradually dissipated, leaving behind Ice Cloud and the rest whose expressions changed drastically.

“This ... How can this be?” He Xiangyun was still brimming with confidence previously. Who knew that in a blink of an eye, the situation suddenly changed.

Empyrean Ice Cloud recovered to a dead person’s expression. Her expression was as ugly as it could get.

When she went to find Empyrean Dragonjade previously, Empyrean Dragonjade was still very enthusiastic.

Empyrean Ice Cloud also paid a great price for this.

But who knew that in a blink of an eye, Empyrean Dragonjade actually went back on his word.

Suddenly, a voice sounded out in the great hall. The person said, “Younger Sister Ice Cloud, are you there?”

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s eyes glimmered and she said, “It’s Brother Redfeather. Please enter.”

A figure slowly stepped in. It was precisely Empyrean Redfeather.

In this Jiu Luo Ji, the nine great Empyreans each acted of their own free will. But to talk about relationships, it was pretty good between Empyrean Redfeather and Empyrean Ice Cloud.

The moment Redfeather entered the hall, he said, “Younger Sister Ice Cloud, you have to be more careful. Master Ji traveled around the various territories in this greater part of the year, challenging powerhouses from everywhere, with his fame already shaking the Northernmost Steppe.”

But he suddenly discovered that the expressions of everyone in the hall were very amiss.

Empyrean Ice Cloud even had a face like dead ashes, disbelief on her face.

“What is it?” Empyrean Redfeather asked uncertainly.

Ice Cloud did not answer. He turned to Yang Fei-er.

Yang Fei-er laughed bitterly and said, “Lord Redfeather is a step too late. Just earlier, Empyrean Dragonjade broke the contract and already stopped providing medicinal pills to our Ice Cloud Tower.”

Empyrean Redfeather’s expression changed. Following this, he sighed and said, “Sigh, Younger Sister Ice Cloud, your attitude should change! This Master Ji’s alchemy strength is unrivaled and really can’t be offended!”

Empyrean Ice Cloud gnashed her teeth in hatred at this time. Her chest was heaving up and down. She was practically at the brink of rampaging already.

“I don’t believe that a mere six-star Alchemy God can still make the Northernmost Steppe bow its heads in submission! This Empyrean will go and find Empyrean Xiao Yu right now!”

As Empyrean Ice Cloud said this, she was about to leave. But then she heard Empyrean Redfeather sigh faintly and said, “It’s too late. Just earlier, Vast Wind Assemble sent news that Ji Qingyun challenged Empyrean Xiao Yu. Empyrean Xiao Yu suffered a crushing defeat and carried out the etiquette of a disciple in front of Ji Qingyun.”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of everyone in the great hall changed wildly.

“What? Empyrean Xiao Yu was also ... also defeated? He ... He’s the extreme north’s number one Alchemy Dao person, a middle-stage Dao Realm powerhouse!”

Empyrean Ice Cloud was really visibly moved this time.

Vast Wind Assemble was the strongest pill establishment in the Northernmost Steppe. And Empyrean Xiao Yu was also the publicly recognized strongest Seven-star Alchemy God in the Northernmost Steppe.

But now, Ji Qingyun even defeated him too!

Defeated then defeated, but Empyrean Xiao Yu actually carried out the etiquette of a disciple towards Ji Qingyun like Empyrean Loneswan.

Just how monstrous was this Ji Qingyun?

Vast Wind Assemble was actually managed by Feng Tianyang’s father.

Empyrean Ice Cloud was planning on forcefully bringing Lu-er to request help from Vast Wind Assemble just now.

But hearing this news, she was akin to being struck by lightning.

Matters between Empyreans could not be settled by marriage and becoming in-laws.

Ji Qingyun was currently like the noonday sun. Even Empyrean Vast Wind also had to give Ji Qingyun some face.

How could he possibly offend Ji Qingyun, this great buddha, for Lu-er?

Let alone that Feng Tianyang had at least ten, if not eight women too. Why would he pay attention to her, a measly little Empyrean Ice Cloud?

Empyrean Ice Cloud suddenly discovered that with how vast the Northernmost Steppe was, there was actually no place for her to stay anymore!

Empyrean Redfeather gave Empyrean Ice Cloud a glance rather sympathetically and sighed and said, “Younger Sister Ice Cloud, after Master Ji returns, give in to him! While he’s a little arrogant, he’s actually very easy-going.”

Having contact with Ye Yuan these few days, Empyrean Redfeather discovered that Ye Yuan was actually very easy to have dealings with.

As long as one did not oppose him, he would even give quite a lot of concessions in medicinal pills.

Furthermore, Ji Qingyun’s medicinal pills were really extremely impressive.

He requested for a few medicinal pills, and then the disciples under him actually all broke through their cultivation realms.

How could this kind of powerhouse be easily offended? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Furthermore, Ye Yuan threw them an even larger bait, which was Empyrean Loneswan!

This time, Ye Yuan brought Empyrean Loneswan along to tour the extreme north. Once they returned, Empyrean Loneswan might have a large improvement in strength!
