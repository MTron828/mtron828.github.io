“In order to resist the blood race, 32 Hegemon Realm powerhouses joined forces and built the Absolute Heaven Barrier, only then barely managing to resist the blood race.”

“But the vicinity of the Absolute Heaven Barrier became a meat grinder. Countless powerhouses have died there. This battle is a thousand years old! In these 1000 years, the Absolute Heaven Barrier was breached many times, but we forcefully fought back again and again. Within a thousand years, seven of

our Hegemon Realm powerhouses died in battle. The Emperor Realm powerhouses who fell reached three figures! But, we finally managed to fend off!”

“But no one could have thought that the blood race actually opened up a spatial passageway and launched a surprise attack from the north. If not for you risking your life to report the information this time, our northern cities would definitely have fallen on all fronts. At that time, Heaven One Continent

would be completely occupied by the enemy.”

Song Miao was laden with anxieties, clearly being very worried about the present situation.

One could tell that the blood race appearing in the rear this time also made him break out in cold sweat from fright. Until now, he still had lingering fear in his heart.

Ye Yuan also did not think that this end of the sea would actually be in such a situation.

He heard Mi Tian say before, wherever the blood race went, it was akin to locusts crossing the border, having not a blade of grass surviving.

They lived by feeding on the blood of all races across all the heavens, growing stronger the more they fought!

Furthermore, their propagation was also different from other races.

They were like spore organisms, splitting off directly from the main body, with extremely strong reproductive abilities.

Furthermore, the stronger the main body, the stronger the bloodkin that split off too.

They sucked blood continuously, growing stronger continuously, multiplying continuously, and expanding continuously.

Until later, once they scaled up, the race would become extremely terrifying,

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s current situation was precisely this sort of situation!

More than 100 thousand years ago, the Hegemon Realm powerhouses across all the heavens joined forces to exterminate the blood race and had once wiped out the blood race.

But Mi Tian also never expected that after more than 100 thousand years, the blood race actually rose again from the ashes. Furthermore, they even displayed the force of a prairie fire.

The Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was actually only left with less than a third.

No idea what kind of situation the other 32 heavens were either.

Of course, that was too far away for Ye Yuan.

If Heaven One Continent were to fall, Ye Yuan himself would likely not be able to escape death too.

“Senior, is the current situation on the northern front not optimistic?” Ye Yuan said.

Song Miao shook his head and said, “The blood race sent out more than 10 Emperor level powerhouses and a 20 thousand strong Saint Sovereign Heaven army. Although we’re prepared, the other party’s strength is too strong, defending the spatial passageway desperately. We fought three bloody battles

with them and didn’t gain any advantage either. Instead, we suffered heavy casualtie:

“Currently, the spatial passageway hasn’t completely stabilized yet. The blood race’s Hegemon Realm powerhouses are not able to pass through. But, as long as the spatial channel is there, they can continue to send powerhouses over ceaselessly! Once the spatial passageway is stabilized and they send

Hegemon Realm powerhouses over, we … probably won’t be able to defend!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There’s no harm. This Ye still has this bit of confidence.”

Song Miao frowned and said, “Little brother, you came from outside. You might not know the terror of the blood race! Even Hegemon Realm powerhouses will find it difficult to resist the corrosion of blood energy too. I know that you have battle spirit level chaos true spirit bloodline, but … it’s still not

enough!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, a surge of bloodline power flowed out.

Song Miao’s expression changed, and he cried out in surprise, “Battle soul level! You … Your bloodline power broke through?”

During the heavenly punishment, Ye Yuan had displayed the battle spirit level chaos bloodline before. So, Song Miao had an idea in his heart.

Chaos true spirits were born from chaos. Their bloodline was extremely noble.

The blood energy of the blood race could corrupt all races across all the heavens but could not corrupt chaos true spirit bloodline.

Of course, this was limited too.

Song Miao was injured by a True Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. His battle spirit level bloodline was unable to withstand the corruption of a True Sovereign Heaven powerhouse.

Chaos true spirit bloodline was divided into five level, battle spirit level, battle soul level, battle god level, earth kun level, and heaven qian level!

Heaven qian level bloodline powerhouses were virtually all Hegemon Realm!

It was not up to Song Miao to not be surprised because the advancement of chaos true spirit bloodline was extremely difficult.

In reality, the vast majority of chaos true spirit bloodline was innate and determined by talent. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wanting to take the initiative to improve it was virtually impossible.

But, after Ye Yuan experienced the heavenly punishment, he actually directly raised his bloodline by a level. It was too inconceivable.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heavenly punishment is a crisis and also an opportunity. As a divergent cultivator, each Dao tribulation is a life-and-death trial for this Ye. Since I succeeded in overcoming the tribulation, then I naturally have to obtain some benefits.”

Song Miao smiled bitterly and said, “While that might be the case, how can the improvement of chaos true spirit bloodline be accomplished so easily? Young Friend Ye is really too surprising, Back then, when I saw the heavenly punishment, I even thought which True Sovereign Heaven Dao friend it was.

Didn’t expect that it was actually a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, simply unbelievable.”

Ye Yuan’s words were right, but there had been plenty of people who had overcome tribulations.

If it were so easy, then Heaven One Continent would not have fallen so far as to be nearly occupied by the enemy.

Hence, Ye Yuan started to diagnose Song Miao.

‘When his divine essence entered the body, Ye Yuan felt an extremely strong corruption force.

This corruption force virtually wanted to corrupt Ye Yuan’s divine essence completely. It even wanted to invade into his body by following Ye Yuan’s divine essence.

But very soon, Ye Yuan’s battle soul level bloodline power erupted, immediately suppressing this corruption power..
