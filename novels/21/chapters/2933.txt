Chapter 2932: Strongest Soul Physique!

Many people did not understand why Great Emperor Eastsun would lose composure like this.

Even when Qin Shitian broke through to ten wroughts earlier, they did not see him so shocked either.

What did this smoking represent?

But Westdawn and Woodrelease, two Great Emperors, seemed to have realized something. Their expressions immediately became fascinating.

“You’re saying, that … that’s the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique? This … This is impossible, right?” Westdawn said.

Great Emperor Eastsun drew a deep breath and said, “Otherwise, how do you explain why the Dao fires are still descending? There’s no mistake. It’s definitely the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!”

Not far away, Qin Shitian’s pupils constricted, and he exploded at once, exclaiming, “What?! Could Master be talking about … Hegemon Imperishable’s Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique?”

Eastsun nodded and said, “Otherwise, can there still be a second Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique?”

Hang on, didn’t a second one appear now?

With this, everyone was shocked, and the entire place burst out into an uproar.

“One of the three great Hegemons, Hegemon Imperishable? What Ye Yuan awakened is the same soul physique as him?”

“Doesn’t that mean that Ye Yuan might very likely corroborate his Dao as a supreme in the future?”

“Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique! It’s also called Imperishable Soul Physique! The reason why Hegemon Imperishable got his name is because his soul physique is too strong and can’t be killed at all! Could it be that … Ye Yuan is the same as him?”

“This … This is impossible, right? How did it suddenly … Then wouldn’t Qin Shitian become a joke?”

… …

Soul race’s three great Hegemons, Hegemon Imperishable, Hegemon Samsara, as well as Hegemon Heavenly Soul!

Hegemon Samsara and Hegemon Heavenly Soul were both Chaos Hegemons that the Qi Soul Clan gave birth to.

Meanwhile, Hegemon Imperishable was the strongest Hegemon that the Nirvanic Soul Clan gave birth to!

This so-called strongest Hegemon was not the strongest in the world, but he was the strongest across all the heavens!

Hegemon Cloudmount’s strength was extremely formidable, but he could not rank in the top three in the human race at all.

But Hegemon Imperishable was one of the strongest three Hegemons in the entire soul race!

Now, Ye Yuan awakened the same soul physique as him. Everyone’s shock could be imagined.

This kind of soul physique was too strong!

Could not be killed no matter how you tried to kill the person; this kind of soul physique could be rated as freakish.

No matter how exceedingly formidable your means, if you can’t kill the opponent, how would you play?

Although both Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique and ten wroughts were hailed as being unkillable, the level was completely different!

Ten wroughts could be killed.

But up to this point, out of the Hegemons in all the heavens, no one could kill Hegemon Imperishable yet!

Qin Shitian stared fixedly at that smoking Soul Refining Furnace, his eyes full of unwillingness.

How was this possible?

Ten wroughts was not the final form of the soul body.

Above ten wroughts, with the meeting of karmic fate, the soul race would awaken all kinds of powerful soul physiques that had attributes.

Such as Hegemon Heaven Subduer from 30 thousand years ago, he awakened the powerful Tyrant Heaven Soul Physique, also achieving his unmatched and awe-inspiring reputation.

But, for countless years, there had been many soul physiques that the soul race awakened. But, not one could surpass the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!

And ever since Hegemon Imperishable, no one could awaken the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique anymore.

This soul physique was too hard to awaken!

Therefore, up until now, the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was also publicly recognized as the most difficult soul physique to awaken in the soul race!

Not one of!

However, today, Ye Yuan actually awakened it! The significance was extraordinary!

After the shock, Great Emperor Eastsun’s face was full of an agitated expression.

If a genius who awakened the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique appeared in the Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall, this was absolutely tremendous glory!

As the saying went, When one man attained Dao, his fowls and dogs ascended to heaven too.

What did a mere ten wroughts count for, when compared to the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique?

Seeing Great Emperor Eastsun’s expression, Qin Shitian felt like he had incredibly bad luck.

He naturally understood what Great Emperor Eastsun was thinking. An object was valued in proportion to its rarity. If Ye Yuan was really of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, that would be the Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall’s pride.

As for him, concerning his ten wroughts soul body, he was no longer important. He could only scoot over to one side!

But, the important thing now was that, did Ye Yuan really awaken the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique?

“Master, the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique is the strongest in the world! Countless tens of thousands of years have already passed. How can it possibly suddenly appear? In my view, even if Ye Yuan awakened a special soul physique, it’s impossible for it to be the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique too!” Qin Shitian said.

Great Emperor Eastsun was taken aback, but he reacted to it very quickly too.

Yeah, how could the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique be so easy to awaken?

The 33 Heavens had already existed for God knows how many years.

But for so many years, only one Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique appeared!

The other soul physiques, no matter how long the interval, it had all appeared once before.

Only this Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique did not.

As for the Qi Soul Clan’s soul physiques, that was born from chaos. It was totally different from the Nirvanic Soul Clan.

Great Emperor Eastsun’s brows furrowed, and he said, “But his current form is virtually identical with the legendary Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!”

Qin Shitian smiled coldly and said, “Our soul race presently has thousands of soul physiques recorded! After so many years, there have been special soul physiques that appeared non-stop too. Perhaps, the soul physique that Ye Yuan awakened is just similar to the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique? Or, even if his soul physique really has attributes like the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, it might be worlds apart compared to the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique? How can Hegemon Imperishable emerge so easily?”

The moment everyone heard,?yeah!

These countless years, god knows how many soul race Hegemon Realm powerhouses had been born, and a large batch had fallen too.

But the ones who stood firmly and indomitably at the summit of Hegemons were the three great Hegemons!

The Nirvanic Soul Clan also wanted to give birth to another powerhouse that could rival the three great Hegemons.

However, they did not!

Qin Shitian’s words splashed down their heads like a basin of cold water.

Great Emperor Eastsun nodded and said, “What Shitian said is right! However, carry on looking and we’ll die!”

Amidst the discussions, the Soul Refining Furnace’s trembling became fiercer and fierce. The mist also grew thicker and thicker.

Finally four hours’ time was up.

Boom!

A loud boom could be heard. The Soul Refining Furnace exploded with a loud bang, fragmenting into pieces.

Dozens of Dao fire scattered everywhere!

The thick mist teemed the entire space.

Everyone’s expression changed wildly!

The three Great Emperors’ expressions turned intent, taking action at the same time, extinguishing these Dao fires.

The mist started to slowly gather and actually transformed into Ye Yuan’s figure in the end.

“Hiss …”

Everyone drew a breath of cold air.

“He really didn’t die! Furthermore, this is virtually identical to the legendary Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!”

“Could it be that after Hegemon Imperishable, a second Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique is really going to be born?”

“Originally, I thought that Ye Yuan was just a stepping stone. Only now do I know that he’s a sky-scraping pillar!”

… …

In the Nirvana Soul Hall, cries of exclamations sounded out.

No one could have thought that a simple test would develop into such an explosive situation in the end. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

First, it was Qin Shitian breaking through to ten wroughts, and then it was Ye Yuan giving birth to the strongest soul physique!

Ye Yuan’s gaze landed on Qin Shitian, and he could not help saying with some surprise,?“Eh??I didn’t expect that you really broke through the 42 kinds of chaos Dao fires! Looks like your talent is indeed pretty good!”

Everyone’s faces revealed extremely strange looks, looking toward Qin Shitian one after another.

The latter’s face already became a horse’s face.

Why did this sound so sarcastic?

I’m called pretty good talent, then what are you called?
