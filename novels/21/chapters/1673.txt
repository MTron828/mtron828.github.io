Chapter 1677 Plundering Clean

Ye Yuan’s current realm was merely more or less the same as a first-layered heaven Divine Lord.Logically speaking, Ye Yuan’s fist could not cause real damage to Zhuo Han. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

But each punch of his was fist to the flesh, pummeling Zhuo Han’s face brutally.

Zhuo Han’s protective divine essence could not block Ye Yuan’s fist at all.

With a few fists, Zhuo Han’s entire person was hit until he was dizzy, unable to differentiate north, south, east, west at all.

He only had one thought right now, that was to run!

“D-Don’t hit anymore!”

Everything turned dark before Zhuo Han’s eyes, eyes kept on rolling back, shouting as he ran wildly.

That appearance was comical to the extreme.

On the massive Heavenspan Mountain, the two people could be described as ‘you chased, I fled.’

Except, a first-layered heaven Divine Lord pursuing a ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord and beating the latter, this image was seriously too impactful.

Yet, one could not fly on the Heavenspan Mountain. Ye Yuan even knew spatial magical abilities, walking as if on wings.

No matter how Zhuo Han ran, he could catch up in a couple of steps, then firmly give him a punch.

By the side, the people were all dumbfounded.

“This guy is also too strong, right?”

“The crux is that why didn’t he trigger heavenly punishment?”

“This kid is really too mysterious. All along the way, he subverted our understanding!”

“Tsk tsk, Zhuo Han suffered a big loss this time. An exalted ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord could only be beaten and not fight back, it’s really aggrieving to death.”

...

Zhuo Han’s junior apprentice brothers all did not dare to step forward. They did not dare to make a move either and could only watch Zhuo Han get beaten helplessly.

Finally, Zhuo Han could not take it anymore and cried out tearfully, “I beg you, don’t hit anymore. Keep hitting and I’ll be disfigured! As long as you don’t hit anymore, I’ll agree to anything you want me to do!”

Sure enough, Ye Yuan stopped and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Anything really goes?”

“Yes! Anything goes! As long as you stop attacking!”

Zhuo Han was really frightened. This was simply an endless torture.

This guy in front of him was simply a devil!

Zhuo Han suddenly felt that in this Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan was invincible.

The Heavenspan Mountain’s various restrictions on ordinary martial artists completely had no effect on him.

You could not attack, but he could!

You could not enter the fog realm, he could!

In this world, was there still such an unreasonable thing?

A dignified ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord, placed outside, that was a powerhouse of a region!

Now, he was actually beaten by a fellow who just broke through to the Divine Lord Realm until his looks were beyond recognition, who would I go and find to reason things out?!

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Alright. I’ll say two things, and as long as you can accomplish them, not attacking you is doable.”

“You say, you say! You say whatever and I’ll agree!” Zhuo Han did not even think and immediately said.

He was not dumb and naturally knew that Ye Yuan would demand an exorbitant price.

But currently, he had no choice!

Facing an invincible opponent, other than yielding, what other choices did you have?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Firstly, apologize to Miss Leng and swear a Heavenly Dao Oath to not pester her again in the future!”

Zhuo Han’s brain had just come back to his senses. Hearing this, his expression could not help changing and he pointed at Ye Yuan and said furiously, “Ye Yuan, you ... you’re despicable!”

Ye Yuan did not get angry either, raising his fist smilingly.

Zhuo Han could not help choking and gnashed his teeth in hatred as he said, “Fine, I promise you!”

In Zhuo Han’s view, Ye Yuan definitely wanted to lust after someone out of his league, using this kind of method to force him to quit.

Actually, Ye Yuan really did not have improper thoughts toward Leng Qiuling. It was all Zhuo Han’s own wishful thinking.

But Ye Yuan also would not explain it. After all, in front of so many people, a lady’s face was still very important.

Letting everyone misunderstand a little was unimportant to him.

Leng Qiuling looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly, not expecting that Ye Yuan’s first request was actually for her sake.

Honestly speaking, she was really annoyed by this stick candy-like Zhuo Han to the max. Yet, she could not shake him off no matter what.

The two families’ elders were very optimistic about the interaction between them.

Now, being able to resolve this problem once and for all, it was naturally a good thing to her.

Thinking up to this point, she was rather moved by Ye Yuan in her heart.

It was only to see Zhuo Han come before Leng Qiuling unwillingly. Using an extremely resentful gaze to look at her, he opened his mouth, but could not say anything.

Everyone said that the more unobtainable the woman, the more tempted men were.

Conquering an iceberg beauty like this was an extremely fulfilling sense of accomplishment to Zhuo Han.

He also believed that by relying on his talent, he could melt this iceberg one day.

But now, because of one oath, all of his efforts vanished like soap bubbles.

“What? You still have a chance to go back on your word now!”

Ye Yuan looked at Zhuo Han with a grin and raised his fist again.

Zhuo Han was already frightened out of his wits by Ye Yuan. He gritted his teeth, bowed to Leng Qiuling, and said, “Junior Sister Leng, in the past, it was all my fault. I shouldn’t have pestered you! I, Zhuo Han, swear in the name of Heavenly Dao, to absolutely not pester you anymore in the future! If I violate this oath, I’ll die a horrible death!”

Zhuo Han hated Ye Yuan in his heart!

But he could not do anything about it!

He already thought it over. After leaving the Heavenspan Mountain, he must think of ways to kill Ye Yuan.

This enmity must be avenged!

Hearing Zhuo Han’s oath, Leng Qiuling also had a feeling akin to being relieved of a heavy burden.

She turned to Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Thank you!”

Although the tone was very indifferent, Ye Yuan could feel her sincerity and smiled at once, saying, “A small matter, Miss Leng don’t have to mind.”

These two people’s conversation seemed very plain, but it was extremely sardonic in other people’s ears.

Zhuo Han said that he would no longer pester Leng Qiuling, but Leng Qiuling said thanks to Ye Yuan.

This smack was really smacked resoundingly!

How adverse was she toward Zhuo Han to say this kind of words in public?

Zhuo Han’s expression was simply even uglier than having eaten a fly.

Uh, of course, his currently pig-head-like face, others could not tell either.

Many people were secretly snickering, the scene was extremely embarrassing for some time.

Leng Qiuling’s disposition was cold. Her emotional intelligence was obviously on the low-side. She still had not felt that there was anything wrong with her words.

But looking at everyone laughing, she was somewhat confused.

Zhuo Han himself could not take it anymore. Turning to Ye Yuan, he said, “I’ve already done the first condition, so state the second!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Hand over all of the storage rings on you and your junior apprentice brothers!”

When Zhuo Han heard, he immediately wanted to roar. But seeing Ye Yuan raise his fist, that chest full of rage immediately fizzled out.

“C-Consider yourself ruthless!’ Zhuo Han was angered until he was about to explode, but could not do anything to Ye Yuan at all.

Apart from yielding, what else could he do?

Zhuo Han turned to the group of junior brothers and said crossly, “Hand over all of the storage rings on your bodies!’

Finished talking, he himself took out a bunch of storage rings. After removing the imprints, he threw them to Ye Yuan altogether.

Ye Yuan looked at Zhuo Han and said with a smile that was not a smile, “All swear a Heavenly Dao Oath, don’t think of smoking through!”

Zhuo Han could not help choking when he heard that and could only fish out another storage ring from his body.

Clearly, the things inside this storage ring were very important to him.

He looked at Ye Yuan viciously, wanting to say a few fierce words, but when the words reached the tip of his tongue, he forced it back.

Saying fierce words at this time was purely asking for trouble.
