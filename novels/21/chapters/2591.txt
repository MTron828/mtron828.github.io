Chapter 2597: Killing People to Establish Awe!

“Wang Tie, this White Pine Melody was discovered by our Ning Si City first. You guys dare to snatch it?”

“Liang Wen, is your brain freaking spoiled? Who will talk to you about who discovered it first in this Land of Exile? Whoever snatches it first belongs to whom!”

“Screw you! I will hack you to death!”

“Am I scared of you?! Brothers, kill for me!”

… …

In the dense woods, two groups drew their swords against each other at a word of disagreement.

Although both sides were all Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums, their combat strength was extremely intrepid.

For some time, they were locked in a struggle.

Especially Wang Tie and Liang Wen, the two people exchanged dozens of moves in the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint. No one could get close.

“F*cking hell! If our Ning Si City can’t get it, your Resplendent Sun City can forget about getting it too! Zhang Yang, go and destroy the White Pine Melody for Your Father! Don’t leave a single one behind!”

Liang Wen gradually faltered in strength and fury immediately rose up in his heart, and he was going to destroy this stretch of White Pine Melody.

White Pine Melody was a grade one heavenly medicine that was very hard to come across. With several dozen stalks appearing here all of a sudden, both sides naturally coveted it greatly.

Having gotten the order, Zhang Yang forced his opponent back with a single saber blow and moved toward the White Pine Melody like lightning.

His movement technique was extremely fast. His opponent could not catch up in time at all.

Seeing the White Pine Melody in front of him, Zhang Yang raised his hand and dealt a saber blow!

However, right at this time, a change suddenly occurred.

Zhang Yang only felt a blur before his eyes, a figure already blocked in front.

Bang!

Before he could see his opponent clearly, his figure directly flew out.

“I didn’t expect that the moment I came to the Land of Exile, I ran into so many White Pine Melody. My luck is really good!”

A youth in white played with the White Pine Melody in his hand, his face seemingly full of satisfaction.

This youth was in white was naturally the Ye Yuan who had just entered the Land of Exile not long ago.

He was currently at a loss when he suddenly heard that there was the sound of fierce fighting over here, and he came over following the sound.

But unexpectedly, he saw such a large stretch of White Pine Melody.

This White Pine Melody was precisely a main medicine for the imperial grade heavenly pill, Yu Qi Dust Cleansing Heavenly Imperial Pill.

But Ye Yuan’s sudden arrival made both sides’ fierce fighting come to an abrupt end.

Ye Yuan started collecting the White Pine Melody unhurriedly and said nonchalantly, “You guys carry on. Don’t need to care about me. I’ll leave after collecting all of them.”

Both sides stopped fighting and quietly surrounded Ye Yuan in the middle, blocking all of his paths of retreat.

“Heh heh,?another brat who doesn’t know life from death!” Wang Tie said with a playful smile on his face.

“Looking at this attire, it should be the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, right? Looks like it’s a fool who came in this time!” Liang Wen said with a cold smile.

“Brat, hand over the storage ring on you and kneel down and kowtow three times. Elder Brother Tie, I, can spare your life and let you follow Elder Brother Tie in the future,” Wang Tie said with a smile.

Not only did Wang Tie and Liang Wen not get angry, but they also seem to be very happy instead.

The various sects’ disciples that came to train in the Land of Exile would normally carry all sorts of treasures on them, which were much more valuable than the White Pine Melody.

The various sect disciples who came to train were all cautious after entering, akin to treading on thin ice.

This guy was good, directly running in front of two great factions to posture; how ridiculous!

Since that was the case, they naturally would not be courteous either. They would kindly accept the treasures on Ye Yuan.

With regards to everyone’s encirclement, Ye Yuan remained indifferent.

After collecting the White Pine Melody, he pointed at Wang Tie and said, “You come and tell me about the distribution of this Land of Exile’s first level, and then kneel down and kowtow thrice, and get lost!”

Wang Tie was stunned. This boy who came to train seemed to be somewhat different from the rest!

Ugh?…

Seems like, he was really a fool!

“Hahaha,?boy, you probably don’t even know what’s your surname, right? Making Elder Brother Tie, I, kneel for you. Can you bear it?” Wang Tie said with a loud laugh.

“Listen up, our Big Brother Tie is Resplendent Sun City’s ranked 29th big shot!”

“If you don’t know what 29th place means, then let me tell you. His strength is invincible among your sect’s Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums!”

“Punk, why haven’t you knelt down to apologize for your offense!”

… …

The small fries immediately brought out Wang Tie’s identity, attempting to scare Ye Yuan.

It was just that Ye Yuan was aloof and indifferent and said coolly, “You just kneel down. I can bear it!”

Wang Tie’s gaze turned cold and he said, “Refusing face when it’s given! Since you’re courting death yourself, then Big Brother Tie, I, will send you off! Attack!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Under Wang Tie’s word of command, more than ten figures rushed towards Ye Yuan.

Liang Wensheng was afraid that the good stuff would be snatched by Wang Tie. So he also brought his men and rushed over.

More than 20 upper and grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums swarming over, their commotion was quite shocking.

None of these people were mediocre.

Those able to survive in the Land of Exile were all veterans of a hundred battles. No one knew how much fresh blood had stained their hands.

Their combat strength was far from what cultivation realm could measure.

These people, even if it was just a small fry, they could also jump realms to battle when placed outside.

With over 20 people dealing with one person, that feeling of oppression could only be imagined.

However, Ye Yuan dodged in the crowd, akin to strolling idly in a courtyard.

Occasionally flicking his finger, sabers and swords would slip out of the hand directly.

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint, Liang Wen slashed over with a saber.

Ye Yuan turned sideways slightly and guided with his fingertip, Liang Wen staggered and could not pull his saber back in time.

Pffft!

This blade just happened to stab right through Wang Tie!

Wang Tie did not dare to believe everything that happened before his eyes until death.

How could a trial-taker be so strong?

It turned out that he was that fool!

Wang Tie’s eyes gradually dimmed, completely losing consciousness.

“This … How can it be like this?”

“S-So strong! He hasn’t even attacked and Wang Tie already died?”

“This trial-taker is different from the others!”

… …

Liang Wen similarly had a look of disbelief. He could not quite imagine that his blade actually killed Wang Tie so easily.

That blade just now, he seemed to have been bewitched, thrusting it out involuntarily.

The timing was just right!

It was as if Wang Tie himself got tired of living, colliding onto the edge of his saber.

One had to know, he was evenly matched in strength with Wang Tie.

Even if he wanted to kill the opponent, it had to at least be after several hundred moves too!

“He’s not saying anything. So why don’t you tell me then?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Y-Yes! Y-Your Excellency, spare my life!” Liang Wen let go of his saber and directly knelt in front of Ye Yuan.

The others knelt down one after another.

The Land of Exile did not have any rules at all. Whoever’s fist was harder, whoever would be the boss!

The people here also had ways of seeking death. Ye Yuan did not have the slightest psychological burden in killing any one of them.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I don’t like to kill people, but I’m not afraid of killing people too. What happens will depend on your performance.”

Liang Wen hurriedly kowtowed incessantly and said, “Your Excellency just ask away. This lowly one will definitely spill everything that I know!”

Very soon, Liang Wen introduced the Land of Exile’s first level’s forces.

Land of Exile, each major cultivation realm lived on a level.

The first level was the place where Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums were at.

If one reached Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, they would ascend to the next level.

The first level had ten great factions, gathered in ten cities respectively.

The ten cities were ruled by ten sovereigns respectively.

Friction would often occur among them.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
