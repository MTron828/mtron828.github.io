Chapter 2509: Retreat!

“Heavenly Dao? This thing is also worthy of being called Heavenly Dao?” Ye Yuan put Li-er into the World Suppressing Stele’s space and said with a look of disdain.

Ye Yuan did not know what Heavenly Dao was.

But it was absolutely impossible for these strange-looking things to be Heavenly Dao.

Only the divine race would treat this thing as a treasure.

Ye Yuan spat a mouthful of blood, and slowly stood up. The sword intent on his body surged to the sky!

“Universe!”

Ye Yuan took a step out, flying straight for the statues!

Whoosh!

Another terrifying surge of energy undulation!

Ye Yuan did not back down in the slightest. Universe bloomed, directly welcoming it.

Boom!

The void shook violently. Ye Yuan was directly sent flying, smashing heavily into the ground.

Facing the enormous statues, Ye Yuan was like the moth flying into the fire, being weak to the extreme.

The ever-victorious Universe seemed to also have lost its effect at this time.

When Tian Qing saw this scene, he could not resist sneering as he said, “A mantis blocking the chariot, overestimating your own ability! A stubborn fellow who refuses to come to your senses, you really don’t know life from death! Is heavenly might what human strength can shake? No matter how strong you are, you’re also just a human!”

But Ye Yuan was oblivious, pouncing toward the statues over and over again.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

… …

Over and over again, Ye Yuan was directly blasted flying.

But he rushed forward over and over again stubbornly, as if he did not know exhaustion.

This energy undulation was extremely strong, strong beyond imagination!

But Ye Yuan’s Universe was likewise powerful to the extreme.

Coupled with his formidable to the extreme physical body, he forcibly pulled through.

It was just that each time, he was blasted deep into the ground by that powerful force.

But even so, his entire body was already dripping with blood, looking savage and terrifying.

Under such intense shocks, even if Ye Yuan’s physical body was astonishing, he suffered considerable injuries too.

The strength of these eight statues was indeed terrifying to the extreme.

That powerful energy undulation completely had no problems killing at least one Dao Ancestor!

If the target was not Ye Yuan, they would have long died no idea how many times.

That voice said with a scornful laugh,?“Hahaha?… Ant, haven’t you figured out the situation yet? With your strength, another ten thousand times will be futile too!”

“Oh,?is that so?” Ye Yuan did not care in the slightest, continuing to assault, then get blasted flying again.

“Of course! I’m the heaven! The paramount heaven! All you ants are nothing in front of heaven!”

When the divine race powerhouses saw the Ye Yuan who was like a moth flying into the fire, they shook their heads one after another.

“This is the power of Heavenly Dao. Although Ye Yuan is strong, he’s merely a slightly stronger ant. That’s all!”

“This boy really overestimates your own ability, to actually dare provoke the majesty of Heavenly Dao!”

“Heh,?this brat had best be killed by the divinity. That way, our divine race will be able to reign over the world again!”

… …

The strength that Ye Yuan exhibited previously, it deeply hurt the divine race’s self-esteem.

They knew that they would never be able to surpass Ye Yuan.

They could not, but Heavenly Dao could! The Eight Extreme Divinities could!

Looking at the powerful Universe, it was nothing in front of the Eight Extreme Divinities!

That sort of delight was practically bursting out.

Boom!

Ye Yuan was blasted flying again, spurting out a large mouthful of blood with a cough.

His aura already withered significantly.

“Boy, I’m already tired of this. I can’t be bothered to carry on playing with you anymore! This strike will send you on your way!” That voice held unspeakable banter.

At the same time, the eight statues actually condensed energy at the same time!

Above the void, the wind and clouds surged, as if the end of the world was arriving again.

Everyone present was crushed by this pressure until they were practically unable to breathe.

Under this terrifying pressure, Ye Yuan’s clothes fluttered madly.

“This … This is heavenly might! When a god is angered, Heavenly Dao is angered too! Ye Yuan’s provocation already affronted heaven’s mighty! He’s dead for sure!” Tian Qing’s expression changed abruptly as he said.

Under this apocalyptic power, even he could not remain calm anymore.

This was the true heavenly might!

At this moment, he became incomparably devout, slowly kneeling down.

“God, please calm your anger!”

With him kneeling, all of the divine race knelt down.

“God, please calm your anger!” Everyone lied prostrate on the ground, praying to heaven, incomparably religiously.

“Ant, do you see it! This god is heaven! This is heaven’s might! Under heaven’s might, your chaos origin divinity will turn to ashes too! You are too weak!” The Eight Extreme Divinities looked at Ye Yuan with pity as it said with a loud laugh.

Each of the eight statues was holding a different weapon in their hands.

But currently, extremely terrifying energy was condensing on each weapon!

If this strike landed, the entire Cangyan Mountain would likely be leveled to the ground!

In the area of ten million miles, not a blade of grass would survive!

It was just that Ye Yuan’s expression seemed very calm.

He slowly opened his mouth and said, “Heaven’s might? Perhaps! Extracting the energy of the Heavenspan World to launch attacks can indeed be called heaven’s might! It’s just a pity that your technique has already been figured out by me!”

Over on the Eight Extreme Divinities’ side, he clearly choked. He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually saw through the nature of this trick.

However, he did not care, saying with a laugh,?“Hahaha?… you’ve figured out this god’s technique? A mere ant also dares to utter such big talk, what a joke! Boy, no matter how glib your tongue is, you’ll die without a doubt too!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ye Yuan slowly shook his head and held his palm out. The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain appeared in his palm impressively.

At the same time, an astonishing aura rose steadily from Ye Yuan’s body!

That was the aura of Great Dao!

Feeling this terrifying aura, the voice of the Eight Extreme Divinities finally changed!

He seemed to have seen an extremely terrifying thing and said in shock, “You … You actually refined the Heart of Heavenspan! This … This is impossible! H-How can you, an ant, possibly obtain the recognition of the Heart of Heavenspan?”

The voice of the Eight Extreme Divinities seemed extremely panicky.

Clearly, the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain put tremendous pressure on him.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly and he said with a smile, “So, it’s called Heart of Heavenspan! Looks like you really know quite a bit! Coming to find you is indeed correct!”

It was only to see Ye Yuan hold both palms out flatly. The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain rose up.

At this time, heaven and earth seemed to be revolving around Ye Yuan.

“Retreat!”

Ye Yuan lightly spat a word out of his mouth.

Following that, those surging wind and clouds, the lightning flashing and thunder clapping, the fitful heaven’s might, all retreated!

One word made everything return to tranquility!

The terrifying power condensed by the Eight Extreme Divinities directly dissipated with the wind!

This was the might of Great Dao!

Ye Yuan looked at the eight statues and said with a sneer, “Now, try executing your heaven’s might again?”

The divine race powerhouses present were all completely stunned!

No words could describe the shock in their hearts currently.

“What’s going on here? Heaven’s might was frightened away by Ye Yuan?”

“This … This is also too exaggerated, right? He … a mortal, actually frightened heaven’s might away?”

“Could it be that Ye Yuan already reached the point where he’s on par with heaven? This … This is impossible, right?”

… …

At this time, they did not know what they should say anymore. Only a deep shock remained.
