Chapter 571: Creating History!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This Ye Yuan was actually someone who had become stronger when encountering strong enemies!

Regarding the strength of these brothers of his, Kuai Liang was all too clear.

But even so, they were still crushed by Ye Yuan domineeringly!

Those two punches earlier, even he felt terror.

Too strong!

Could it be that this boy had no limits?

This group of people was all Fourth Level Soul Sea strength. What did this illustrate?

This showed that when they, these people, were at the Fourth Level Soul Sea, as a team still could not triumph over Ye Yuan this Fifth Level Sea Transformation!

Furthermore, when they were at the Fourth Level Soul Sea, they did not have their current concepts comprehension at all.

Ye Yuan using these two punches perfectly elucidated what was called powerful!

Kuai Liang looked at Ye Yuan and suddenly burst into laughter, “Hahaha! How many years has it been? The Vast Heaven Pagoda finally welcomed an interesting youth! Ye Yuan, you’re excellent! This Vast Heaven Pagoda Inheritance, the final three rounds are the most important. You have to put in great effort. Don’t let me down!”

As he said, Kuai Liang swung his sword in a circle, then swiped towards his own neck.

The other illusionary spirits all followed suit, all choosing to commit suicide!

Very soon, Kuai Liang and the rest all revived from the dead, appearing in front of Ye Yuan once again.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Thank you very much, Elder Brother Kuai!”

“Huhu, thank for what? There has never been compassion in the martial artists’ world, only strength! If you don’t have adequate strength, how can you be qualified to let me view you in a different light? Who knows how many martial artists came to this Vast Heaven Pagoda. But barely any had the qualifications to let me a word more. And you, have this qualification. Alright, you go to the inheritance space then,” Kuai Liang said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Farewell!”

. . . . . .

“Cleared! Really made it through! The seventh level! Seventh level!”

Outside the Vast Heaven Pagoda, everyone’s emotion was boiling over!

The seventh level!

This was a result which created history!

Since Lu Linfeng made it into the seventh level, several thousand years had already passed. During this period, nobody ever made it inside.

Lu Linfeng’s prowess, nobody dared to dispute it.

After a time interval of several thousand years, was another Grand Yan True Lord such existence going to appear again?

Entering the seventh level meant that Ye Yuan at least made it into the top five in this ten thousand years!

Ten thousand years. How many geniuses slowly rose up, then vanished in the long process of history again?

To be able to rank in the top five of all the geniuses in ten thousand years, this glory, just thinking about it made people feel excited.

“Quickly look! You guys, quickly look! Ye Yuan’s name is changing again!”

On the light screen, the originally gilded ‘Ye Yuan’ two characters were gradually plated with a layer of purple halo.

The initially gold-colored name, after adding this layer of purple halo, actually became sacred.

When the surrounding martial artists saw that name, a feeling of prostrating in worship actually birthed in their hearts!

“Ye Yuan’s name actually became purple-gold colored! This . . . What does this represent?” Ning Yixian said in astonishment.

Ning Yixian, Qin Hongtao, and Jing Xuan exchanged glances. Their hearts all had a conjecture which shocked them to the core!

“Ye Yuan should have perfectly cleared the round once again!” Qi Hai’s voice suddenly rang out.

“Hiss . . .”

Although they had surmised it in their hearts, hearing Qi Hai say it out, the shock in their hearts was still beyond words.

The Grand Yan True Lord swept across the Endless World after coming out from the Vast Heaven Pagoda back then. This legend was passed down all the way until now. But Ning Yixian they all had never heard before that the Grand Yan True Lord had once perfectly cleared the rounds.

How many times greater was the difficulty of the middle three levels compared to the first three levels?

But under such circumstances, Ye Yuan still cleared the rounds perfectly?

“What in the world did Ye Yuan do inside this Vast Heaven Pagoda? If he can even perfectly clear the sixth level, what kind of realm has his present strength already reached?” Ning Yixian felt rather hard to wrap his mind around it.

“The middle three levels all configure the opponents according to the martial artist’s own boundary. Ye Yuan’s realm is only Sea Transformation Realm, but his true combat power can cross a major boundary. If it’s like this, he has a huge advantage in clearing these middle three levels,” Qin Hongtao said.

“Not so! When Ye Yuan was at the fifth level, the opponents he faced were all First Level Soul Sea! I witnessed with my own eyes that those opponents were all killed by Ye Yuan!”

Qin Hongtao had just finished talking when a voice immediately jumped out to refute.

Everyone turned around to look. It was precisely the Guo Taoqun who was already kicked out of the fifth level.

Guo Taoqun’s words stirred up an intense wave once again.

“What? You said that Ye Yuan’s opponents in the fifth level were actually all First Level Soul Sea?” Ning Yixian’s eyes became round as a ball.

Guo Taoqun nodded and said, “That’s right! Furthermore, there was the augmentation of array formation. The power of the Illusionary Spirits Killing Array is very strong! Even if I have Third Level Soul Sea strength right now, I might not be able to pass through the fifth level either! And I personally witnessed that Ye Yuan carried out a complete suppression against the Illusionary Spirits Killing Array right from the start, all the way until they were all killed!”

Silence! Deathly silent!

The news that Guo Taoqun brought was even more astounding than Ye Yuan’s name becoming purple-gold earlier.

A Sea Transformation Realm martial artist actually suppressed a group of Soul Sea Realm illusionary spirits across the board, and he even killed all of them!

How horrifying a combat power did this required?!

“En? Oh, right, what does this Perfect Completion that you guys talked about mean?”

Guo Taoqun had just come out from the Vast Heaven Pagoda and was still unaware of what Perfect Clear signified.

Ning Yixian briefly explained to Guo Taoqun. Guo Taoqun was not as shocked as imagined. Because he already personally witnessed Ye Yuan’s prowess in the Vast Heaven Pagoda.

Except that after hearing Ning Yixian’s explanation, Guo Taoqun could not help saying with a bitter smile, “Looks like at the fifth level, Ye Yuan did not use his full strength! I reckon that the opponents in the sixth level are at least at the Third Level Soul Sea Realm! Maybe even Fourth Level Soul Sea! He actually still killed all the opponents same as before. This shows that the fifth level was just an appetizer to him!”

Guo Taoqun never could have expected that the Vast Heaven Pagoda trip this time actually pulled apart the distance between him and Ye Yuan so greatly.

The present Ye Yuan was already on an entirely different level from them, these juniors!

Ren Xingchun’s entire body was somewhat trembling right now. How many years has it been since he was so agitated?

Even when he became Wu Fang City Lord back then, he had not been so agitated before too.

The worry in the beginning to the pride and arrogance now, this sort of situation made him, this old man who had experienced the hardships of life, somewhat surging with agitation in his heart.

At present, Ren Xingchun involuntarily recalled the scene of him forcing Ye Hang and Ren Hongling husband and wife out of Wu Fang City back then. Thinking about it, he truly did something extremely foolish back then.

If one person’s willpower was not staunch enough between the two of them, how could he have such a remarkable grandson now?

If his separation of the loving couple back then succeeded . . . Ren Xingchun even did not quite dare to imagine right now.

Ye Yuan’s rising momentum was too strong!

With Ye Yuan around, Wu Fang City would become the entire Endless World’s pinnacle existence for at least a thousand years! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Before long, Wu Fang City would completely quash the Three Sects, becoming the number one major faction in this Endless World!

Ren Xingchun was an ambitious old man. Thinking about Wu Fang City’s future, he was rather agitated.
