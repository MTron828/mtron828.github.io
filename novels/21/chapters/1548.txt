Chapter 1552 Ning Siyu Refining Pills

Outside of the Pill Tower, a young man came up to greet.

Seeing the arrival of that person, Ning Siyu went up to greet him with a smile, “Hehe, Second Senior Brother, were you punished by Master again?”

This person was Ning Siyu’s second senior brother, Ding Xun, an initial-stage Four-star Alchemy God existence!

Ding Xun was stunned and said, “How do you know?”

Ning Siyu beamed widely and said, “Divine essence unsteady. One look and it’s excessive use of divine fire. Master punished you to practice fire control a hundred times again, right?”

Ding Xun pouted and said, “Little Junior Sister, you still have time to worry about me? Better worry about yourself! You went overboard this time!”

Ning Siyu smiled mischievously and said, “Second Senior Brother, why don’t we make a bet?”

Ding Xun said suspiciously, “You lass, what lousy idea did you think of again?”

Ning Siyu smiled and said, “I say that not only will Master not punish me, but he’ll also even praise me greatly!”

Ding Xun laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and said, “You lass, did you get delirious after going out for a few days? You actually ran away from home this time. Master will at least punish you with a closed-seclusion for three years. You actually said that Master he’ll praise you?”

Ning Siyu said with a mischievous look, “Just say whether you dare to bet or not!”

Ding Xun could not help laughing as he said, “What item of Senior Brother’s did you take fancy on again? But this time, you can’t possibly win.”

Ning Siyu grinned and said, “If Second Senior Brother you lose, then give me your Blue Voyage Insight Divine Fire!”

Ding Xun’s eyes narrowed and he said with a smile, “Mischievous girl, your Cerulean Divine Flame is much stronger than the Blue Voyage Insight Divine Fire. What are you having designs on it for?”

Ning Siyu said, “Don’t need you to worry about that. You just say whether you dare to bet or not! If I lose, the Heavenly Sieve Secret Art that Master bestowed on me the last time will be given to you!”

Ding Xun’s eyes lit up and he said, “For real?”

“Even more real than real gold!” Ning Siyu said with a smile.

Ding Xun nodded and said, “Okay! Second Senior Brother will bet with you! I don’t believe that you can really escape Master’s punishment this time!”

Ning Fangrong did not make a sound the entire time, looking at his little sister rather surprisedly.

He was the same as Ding Xun, uncertain where this lass’ confidence came from.

Inside Ning Fangrong’s mind, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly flashed across.

Could it be ... related to that brat?

Ning Fangrong denied this notion very quickly. How could this be possible!

...

Inside the lobby, Master Xuan Yu currently had his eyes shut to rest.

Hearing the commotion, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “Girl, you still know to come back, huh?!”

Master Xuan Yu’s voice was very awe-inspiring, sounding very angry, but there was a trace of excessive doting that inadvertently flowed out too.

As the saying went: love hard, whip hard.

Master Xuan Yu was very satisfied with Ning Siyu, this final disciple, but also had a big headache.

This girl’s talent was astonishing, but she just did not work hard.

Alchemy this path, such superficialness was very hard to have accomplishments.

Therefore, this time, he planned on punishing this lass properly, let her get her mind together.

Ning Siyu giggled and dashed to Master Xuan Yu’s side with a lunge, pulled his arm up, and said coquettishly, “Master, I didn’t go out this time to be naughty. It’s going out to learn new skills!”

Master Xuan Yu was just a sucker for this. But this time, he decided to not fall for it. He must punish this girl!

Only to see him billow his beard and said with a cold snort, “Learn new skills? I think that you became capable! Don’t need to say anything, immediately go to the heaven character number 3 room for closed-seclusion right now. You’re not allowed to take a step out within three years!”

Hearing this, the corners of Ding Xun’s mouth raised.

This girl clearly underestimated Master’s fury this time.

That Heavenly Sieve Secret Art’s rubbing, he had coveted it for a long time already.

This time, he finally got it!

But Ning Siyu was not afraid at all. Swaying Master Xuan Yu’s arm, she said, “Master, I really went out to learn new skills this time! If you don’t believe me, I’ll refine a medicinal pill for you to see right now!”

Xuan Yu glanced at her and said with a cold smile, “Heh, lass, even if you pull any tricks, you can’t escape the punishment of confinement too.”

The smile on Ding Xun’s face became even thicker. Ning Fangrong also beamed widely.

Master Xuan Yu was finally angered by this girl!

“Goodness, Master, I really went out to learn new skills this time! There’s a very powerful fellow inside that Miracle Hand Parlor in the outer city. I went this time to ... interact with him! Master, if you don’t believe, Siyu will refine a medicinal pill for you to see. If you still want to punish me after seeing it, Siyu will accept the punishment obediently!” Ning Siyu said.

Xuan Yu did not believe Ning Siyu’s words at all. That little medicine shop, he already investigated it before. It was an unremarkable little medicine shop, almost closing down. What expert could there be still?

This girl was clearly playing tricks!

But he still said, “Alright, you try refining a medicinal pill. I want to see what you learned these few days!”

You have got to be kidding!

Merely a few day’s time, how much improvement could her alchemy skills have?

Even though Ning Siyu this girl’s talent was exceedingly high, a short few day’s time, it was also not possible to make much progress.

Before long, Ning Siyu brought a pile of spirit medicines to the pill refining room.

Xuan Yu’s gaze swept and could not help saying rather surprisedly, “You’re going to refine the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill? But you never succeeded once before!”

Ning Siyu smiled smugly and said, “It’s because I never succeeded once before that it can demonstrate my improvement!”

Xuan Yu pursed his mouth and declined to comment.

He did not believe that after a few days’ time, Ning Siyu would be able to refine the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill.

But after Ning Siyu started refining the pill, Xuan Yu discovered something off.

He discovered that a kind of change happened to Ning Siyu!

This kind of change was ... focus!

Ning Siyu’s disposition was being too hyper. When refining pills, it was very hard to calm down.

But this time, Ning Siyu was unprecedentedly focused.

Every movement, Ning Siyu completed it very on-point, working with the greatest care.

However, with the passage of time, the shock on Xuan Yu three people’s faces became thicker and thicker.

In the past, when Ning Siyu refined pills, it was very easy to lose control in the second-half and have various situations occur.

But this time, she gradually entered an optimal state, her condition getting better and better!

Finally, Ning Siyu lightly cried, “condense.” The medicinal pill formed!

When the last step was completed, Ning Siyu actually had a feeling of being beside herself with joy.

This kind of feeling had never happened before in her alchemy career.

She really did it!

Being imperceptibly influenced in the Miracle Hand Parlor these few days, she obtained tremendous improvement!

Especially when Ye Yuan cast the Chaos Heavenly Star Art at that time, it brought her into a mysterious realm, letting her obtain tremendous harvests.

Seeing Master and Second Senior Brother’s incomparably shocked looks, Ning Siyu had a smug look.

“Master, Second Senior Brother, open the furnace and take a look then! I’m very much looking forward to it too!” Ning Siyu smiled and said.

Xuan Yu’s palm shook, a medicinal pill flew out of the medicine cauldron.

The four people looked at that medicinal pill in the jade box, faces all revealing extremely shocked looks.

Even Ning Siyu herself also felt that it was unbelievable.

She had long expected that she made progress and should be able to refine the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill.

But she completely did not think that she could actually perform so well!
