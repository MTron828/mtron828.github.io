Chapter 3081: Chaos Origin Formation

The great migration started!

This great migration shook the entire 33 Heavens.

“Old Man Mi Tian, is he nuts? For the sake of a divergent cultivator, he actually gave up on the entire Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven?”

“The four great true spirit clans, that’s the 33 Heavens’ top faction! Back then, in their prime, the four symbols families all had Great Beyond powerhouses holding down the fort. Didn’t expect that they actually fell to such a point now.”

“Those innate chaos true spirits were born in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven. The four great true spirit clans’ bloodlines are also most suitable for Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven. They actually gave up on their land of foundation and ran to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, that sort of low-level plane. It will definitely be incredibly difficult for their clansmen to want to break through.”

“Heh,?just wait to see the joke! The entire Dragon Clan migrating, their clansmen will definitely have a lot of resentment. When they arrive at Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, this kind of team won’t have combat power at all!”

“Oh,?right, there’s also the Nirvanic Soul Clan and Zhoutian Emperor Palace. Ancestor Endless is considered to have stumbled this time. The Nirvanic Soul Clan actually completely broke away from the Qi Soul Clan this time, and they cast their lots with Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! Imperishable that old ghost has also lost his mind!”

… . .

The Hegemon Realms from the various major factions in all heavens were all discussing this great migration.

Ye Yuan’s monstrousness was already known to all.

But, whether or not he could prop up the future, everyone was not optimistic about it.

After all, this was the world of the strong, not the world of geniuses.

The three great supremacies were too strong!

......

They were the closest people to transcending the Great Beyond in the 33 Heavens!

Geniuses only had hope of becoming a powerhouse. They were not genuine powerhouses.

If they did not grow up for one day, they were still just rookies. That was all.

Although the three great supremacies suffered severe injuries, they all had powerful factions behind them.

Especially the blood race’s progenitor, he created an extremely powerful race.

No one knew how strong this race was at all.

This was because everyone understood that what they saw was merely just the tip of the iceberg.

… . .

However, the reality was different from what everyone imagined.

The self-slapping law was manifested to the fullest expression of its beauty and form on the four great true spirit clans’ powerhouses.

In Extreme Light Pavilion’s space, Extreme Medicine Sect.

At this time, Bai Zhi was currently following behind Ye Yuan subserviently in a very anxious manner.

It was a huge array formation in front of him. Ye Yuan was currently pacing back and forth, thinking deeply.

“Younger Brother Ye, can this really work? Drawing the Eternal River’s chaos to a major world, this is unheard of!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This array formation was actually already conceived by me when I was comprehending chaos. It’s just that at that time, my Formation Dao was not perfected yet. That’s why I didn’t take action all along. Now, my Formation Dao has entered origin. My cultivation realm has also entered Emperor Sakra Heaven. There’s still some certainty of succeeding.”

Bai Zhi felt akin to being relieved of a heavy burden and said, “Then that’s good! That’s good! Younger Brother Ye, you have to hurry up. Time waits for no one! Who knows when the blood race will come to attack Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven?”

“Senior, rest assured. I’m even more anxious than you all. But, the more urgent it is, the slower it has to be done, no? Otherwise, what’s delayed is everyone’s cultivation realm,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Bai Zhi nodded like a rattle drum and praised repeatedly, “Right, right, right! Younger Brother Ye’s composure is really outstanding!”

The intention of the drunkard lies not in the wine – having an ulterior motive. Ye Yuan naturally understood that Bai Zhi was anxious to cultivate the Heaven volume.

When in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, Mi Tian tossed out a heavyweight bombshell.

That was, Ye Yuan would set up an array formation and provide a steady flow of chaos divine essence, and let everyone be able to comprehend the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings.

Originally, Bai Zhi and the rest were still worried about how to convince their clansmen.

But with this, nothing was a problem anymore.

Nobody could resist the temptation of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings!

Ye Yuan comprehended chaos in the Eternal River and re-cultivated his cultivation method. He no longer needed to enter the Eternal River to comprehend anything anymore.

However, he needed a steady flow of Eternal River chaos to cultivate.

It was just that. Going to the Eternal River each time was too troublesome. Hence, that was why he thought of this idea. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace this time, Ye Yuan comprehended Formation Dao origin and witnessed the power of the number one great formation in all the heavens. It had a huge inspiration to him.

He was currently using the most basic nine array elements to construct this grand array.

Ye Yuan called this grand array as Chaos Origin Formation.

He would also set up a sub-array in the Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s Eternal River chaos.

Then it would be like a channel, drawing the Eternal River’s chaos over.

And for the Extreme Light Pavilion’s main formation, Ye Yuan even integrated his chaos divine essence, converting the Eternal River’s chaos that was drawn over into chaos divine essence.

Then it pumped the chaos divine essence into the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings for everyone to cultivate.

This was Ye Yuan’s idea.

It sounded fantastical, but to Ye Yuan, it was not considered a very difficult array formation.

Putting it bluntly, this was a high-level transmission array.

It was just that this transmission array was a little too difficult.

Ordinary formation path masters could not set up this kind of array formation at all.

In this world, only Ye Yuan alone could set up this array formation!

Because what he gained enlightenment on was chaos divine essence!

Furthermore, this Eternal River’s chaos could only be completed using those nine array elements too.

Ordinary formation path methods could not withstand the weight of the Eternal River at all.

The more the array elements, the looser the array formation would be.

Using the fundamental nine array elements to set up the array formation was the most stable!

Half a year later, only to hear a loud bang.

A gap directly opened up in the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space. The Eternal River’s chaos flooded like raging floodwaters.

After the Eternal River’s chaos entered, it was directly absorbed by the Chaos Origin Formation, returning to tranquility.

This feeling was like a headwater channel.

Mi Zhen, Long Jian, Bai Zhi, Zhuo Bufan, and the rest trembled all over when they saw the situation.

Zhuo Bufan said with an emotional sigh, “Drawing the Eternal River’s chaos into the mortal world, this scene is really spectacular! Ye Yuan, this boy, is really unbelievably strong!”

While Mi Zhen was incomparably excited as he said agitatedly, “I can finally recover my strength!?Hahaha?… In the future, this Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven will be my home!”

Long Jian and the others were similarly extremely excited.

This was because they finally had the hope of stepping to Great Beyond Realm!

Seeing Ye Yuan come out, Mi Zhen was the first to go up and greet him, saying agitatedly, “Ye Yuan, how is it? Can … Can it work?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The Chaos Origin Formation is very successful! These Eternal River chaos are currently being converted to chaos divine essence in an endless stream. I’ve set up several hundred miniature array formations in the Extreme Light Pavilion. When you guys enter the rooms, you’ll be able to gain enlightenment on the Heavenly Dao Painting. Are the geniuses that your various races picked ready?”

Long Jian said, “It’s long done. Just waiting for you! Those little bastards are all already impatient from waiting!?Haha,?Ye Yuan brat, if I, this old dragon, can step into Great Beyond Realm this time, if you say to head east in the future, I definitely won’t go west!”

“We’re all one family. No need to be courteous. However, Mi Zhen, I’m still a little worried about letting you recover your strength.” While talking, Ye Yuan looked at Mi Zhen.

The latter only felt a chill run down his back, and he hurriedly said, “Don’t, Ye Yuan! I’ve already turned over a new leaf! I’ll swear a Heavenly Dao Oath right now. As long as I recover my strength, I’m willing to be your henchman for 100 thousand years! I’m willing to do whatever you make me do!”
