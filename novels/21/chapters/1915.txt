Chapter 1919: Where’s Your Family’s Grown-Up

“Came out! This boy came out!”

“Just how long has it been, he’s already done refining?”

“Refine my ass! It’s naturally a failure! Just this short while can refine a level nine difficulty medicinal pill?”

...

The moment Ye Yuan came out, it immediately caused a commotion.

He came out too quickly, using only less than four hours.

Logically speaking, the higher the difficulty of the medicinal pill, the more troublesome it was to refine.

Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill this kind of medicinal pill, the time expended would naturally be longer.

Even for a master like Chen Chang, spending eight to ten hours, 12 to 14 hours was a normal occurrence.

Ye Yuan entered the pill refining room for less than four hours from start to finish, what could he refine?

Did he really take level nine difficulty medicinal pills to be cabbages on the streets; anyhow refined?

Toward these meddlesome people, Ye Yuan naturally could not be bothered with them.

He divided the crowd as he walked right over toward the stall of that middle-aged man in the felt hat.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help having stunned faces.

This kid really went?

Asking for trouble?

“Mn? This kid can get back so quickly?” A large group of people pouring over naturally attracted the attention of Chen Chang and the middle-aged man in the felt hat.

After Ye Yuan left, he hounded the middle-aged man in the felt hat and prattled for a long time. But the middle-aged man in the felt hat did not commit himself until success was certain and insisted on seeing the divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill before he was willing to let it go.

Seeing Ye Yuan come over, Chen Chang said huffily, “Stinking brat, you really dared to come! Don’t tell me that you already refined a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill in this short while!”

When the middle-aged man in the felt hat looked at Ye Yuan, his eyes revealed an impatient look but did not speak.

“That’s of course! Otherwise, would I, a junior, really dare to make fun of you two?” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

As he said, Ye Yuan took out a small bottle with a seal and threw it to the middle-aged man in the felt hat.

The middle-aged man in the felt hat received it and took a look, his expression immediately changed.

Not just him, the expression on Chen Chang’s face also became serious.

Through the small bottle, one could see that the color of the medicinal pill was extremely pretty, giving people a refreshing feeling.

Needless to say, the quality of this medicinal pill must be very high.

The middle-aged man in the felt hat sunk a wisp of divine sense into the small bottle, the expression on his face became more and more shocked.

Following that, it was a look of wild elation.

Looking at the color was one thing, whether or not it was really a divine-grade medicinal pill still needed to be tested.

Everyone stared at the middle-aged man in the felt hat, his expression infected the people around him, making everyone’s faces likewise becoming shocked.

Could it be that inside this small bottle was really a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill?

Ye Yuan looked at the middle-aged man in the felt hat quietly and did not say anything.

With his present strength, even refining a vast spirit Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill was a cinch, let alone talk about a purple spirit divine pill.

Suddenly, the middle-aged man in the felt hat lightly pushed the jade box containing the Earth Qilin, pushing it in front of Ye Yuan, and said, “This Earth Qilin is yours! The quality of the medicinal pill is even better than I imagined. If you need any other compensation, feel free to open your mouth.”

One sentence shocked everyone!

“I-It’s really a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill?”

“My eyesight must be failing! Could it be that this brat’s Alchemy Dao strength is even stronger than Master Chen Chang’s?”

...

Master Chen Chang pushed for half a day here and this middle-aged man in the felt hat refused to loosen up.

Now, he actually gave the Earth Qilin to this young man just like that!

The impact that this scene brought to everyone was too intense.

In great imperial capitals, divine-grade medicinal pills were not rare. But divine-grade level nine medicinal pills, that was seldom-seen.

The difficulty of level nine medicinal pills, it could be said that each one was as hard as ascending to the heavens!

Heaven-grade was easy to encounter, divine-grade was hard to find!

But now, Ye Yuan took out a divine-grade level nine medicinal pill, how could they not be shocked?

Plus, there was Chen Chang, this master for comparison by the side, this shock became even more intense.

Ye Yuan reached his hand out to take the Earth Qilin, but he heard Chen Chang shout loudly, “Hold on!”

The middle-aged man in the felt hat frowned and said, “Master, now that the transaction is done, could it be that Master wants to wreck the deal?”

In the Hundred Herb Gathering, the transaction of things was given by one and accepted by another.

Ruining deals here was a very serious crime. Even for an existence like Chen Chang, he could not bear it too.

Chen Chang did not answer. Reaching his hand out towards the middle-aged man in the felt hat, he said, “Let me take a look at the medicinal pill.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The middle-aged man in the felt hat hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he still passed the small bottle over.

He was not worried about Chen Chang destroying the medicinal pill, because he could not bear the consequences.

Chen Chang received the small bottle and also sunk a wisp of divine sense inside.

Very soon, the expression on his face became complicated and astonished, just like the middle-aged man in felt hat earlier.

“Brat, where’s your family’s grown-up?” Chen Chang asked Ye Yuan with a solemn look.

“Grown-up?” Ye Yuan was stunned when he heard that.

“Stop feigning ignorance! Looking at your bone age, you absolutely won’t exceed 2000 years old. If you can refine an Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill that infinitely approaches vast spirit divine-grade at your tiny age, wouldn’t this old man’s many years have been in vain?” Chen Chang said.

Hearing this, the surrounding people all revealed a look of sudden realization.

Yeah!

This boy must have come from some great alchemy family. There must be an extremely formidable high-level alchemy god behind him.

That high-level alchemy god’s strength was at least by no means inferior to Master Chen Chang. He might be even more powerful than him.

Otherwise, Master Chen Chang also would not take it so seriously.

As for Ye Yuan spending two to four hours to go refine the pill earlier, that was merely to pull the wool over people’s eyes.

Hearing Chen Chang’s words, Ye Yuan’s face revealed a strange look.

Could it be that his performance was too astonishing?

This Chen Chang actually did not believe that the medicinal pill was refined by him.

If he refined a vast spirit divine pill, would Chen Chang speculate that the powerhouse behind him was Lord Medicine Ancestor?

“This medicinal pill was refined by me,” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly.

Chen Chang looked at Ye Yuan and said in earnest, “Young man, wanting to become famous is a good thing, but you have to rely on your own ability! With the way you are, even if you really become renowned under the heavens, if other people really came to find you to request for pills, what will you do? Your background isn’t bad, don’t harm yourself!”

Clearly, Chen Chang did not believe Ye Yuan’s words at all.

Ye Yuan went out and walked one round, and only spent less than four hours and then took out a purple spirit divine pills.

In Chen Chang’s view, this was merely Ye Yuan exposing himself unwittingly by trying to cover things up, hoping that others would believe that this medicinal pill was refined by him.

In reality, in his mind, Ye Yuan merely just happened to have a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill on him.

If he came from a powerful alchemy family, carrying a few healing holy medicines on him was all too normal.

It was just that this kind of ‘vanity’ made Chen Chang very disdainful.

By the side, Bai Chen and Ning Tianping seriously could not listen anymore and was just about to refute with a few words but was stopped by Ye Yuan with a hand gesture.

“Master Chen Chang lectured well, this junior has learned my lesson. However, my family’s grown-up isn’t following by my side. I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint Master,” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

Ye Yuan understood in his heart that no matter how he explained, this old man probably would not believe it, so he could only go along with his words.
