Chapter 1479 My Fault?

Ye Yuan cultivated the sword, reducing complexity to simplicity, which already did not go by convention.

‘Sundering Stars’ this move, the quintessence was in the word ‘chop’.

While ‘Chasing Moon’ this move, the quintessence was in the word ‘stab’!

One straight stab, and it could evolve into millions of moves. However, their core was still the ‘stab’ character.

Ingenuity in varying tactics depends on mother wit.

Rigidly adhering to every move and motion would only limit one’s own development.

Sword Dao Laws second-layered heaven cultivating to grand completion, Ye Yuan’s strength went up another level.

Killing that Lang Ge again, Ye Yuan was confident that one move would suffice!

At this time, Long Zhan’s voice came from the outside, “Master, Miss Li Ji requests the pleasure of seeing you.”

“Got it,” Ye Yuan answered indifferently.

When he saw Li Ji, there were even two Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artists behind her.

The moment those two people saw Ye Yuan, they had unfriendly looks.

Ye Yuan understood in his heart. These guys were probably the Fan Family’s guest retainers too, and they knew that his salary was twice of theirs, and were all rather aggrieved. From there, they gave rise to enmity towards him.

Beside Li Ji, there was even a young fiend race male.

He sized Ye Yuan up and said to Li Ji, “Li Ji, this is the expert that you said? He looks very ordinary!”

Li Ji rolled her eyes at him and said, “Fan Yu, just manage your people well will do! My people, don’t need you to bother!”

Fan Yu smiled and said, “Alright, alright, I don’t bother, I don’t bother! But you have to get it straight, this kid is so handsome. Later, some people will get jealous!”

Li Ji pursed her mouth and said, “They do themselves, what has it got to do with me?”

This Fan Yu was Li Ji’s biological elder brother.

Fiend race women’s status was low and not permitted to carry the surname.

Even if Li Ji’s looks were akin to a celestial maiden, there was no exception too.

Finished talking, she said to Ye Yuan, “Brother Source Night, Big Brother and I are going to take part in His Highness Ka Xin’s get-together. Why don’t you and Luo Qi and Pei Lan come together with us?”

Ye Yuan naturally had no reason to not consent and nodded his head to allow it.

...

Ye Yuan originally thought that the fiend race’s aristocrats did not understand literary pursuits and that the City Lord Manor was definitely very sloven.

But entering and taking a look, it made him completely change his understanding of the fiend race.

Fake mountains, pavilions, terraces, footbridges, running water, combined together, they were not the slightest bit inferior compared to human race residences.

“Wah! What a handsome little brother! Tsk tsk, everyone says that Younger Sister Li Ji is pure and noble, being; vastly different from our fiend race women. Looks like ... you keep your own counsel!”

Ahead, a man and a woman came up to welcome them.

When that woman saw the Ye Yuan behind Li Ji, her two eyes immediately shone, a pair of beautiful eyes skimming on Ye Yuan’s body.

This woman was incomparably seductive. Her looks were actually around on par with Li Ji.

But that man’s gaze turned cold, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of ice-cold killing intent.

That woman’s words made Li Ji’s face flush and she spat, “What’s Elder Sister Lian Hua saying? Source Night is my newly recruited guest retainer.”

Lian Hua pulled Li Ji’s hand and said with a smile, “I understand! How can Elder Sister not understand?”

As she said, she moved close to Li Ji’s ear and said softly, “This Little Brother is really handsome, why not ... lend Elder Sister to play for two days?”

Li Ji shot Ye Yuan a glance, her expression somewhat ugly as she said, “Elder Sister Lian Hua, if you carry on joking like this, Li Ji is leaving!”

The man’s brows furrowed and he was even more unhappy. But he still spoke up, “Lian Hua, it’s not that you don’t know Li Ji’s temperament either, stop joking around.”

This man had chiseled features and elegant brows, a rare handsome man of the fiend race.

It was just that compared to Ye Yuan, he was more than a notch worse.

This person was none other than precisely the City Lord Manor’s young lord, Ka Xin.

Lian Hua turned her head and rolled her eyes at Ka Xin and said, “My good elder brother, I’m helping you, how can you be so fierce to me?”

But Ka Xin ignored her and just said coolly, “Fan Yu, Li Ji, inside please.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Before long, there were several fiend race disciples in opulent clothing who entered, and they said hello to Ka Xin, the two of them.

But when they saw the Ye Yuan behind Li Ji, each and every one revealed murderous looks.

Clearly, they all viewed Ye Yuan as Li Ji’s exclusive chunk of meat, their animosity surging greatly.

Ye Yuan only had Two-star fiend general strength but was able to become Li Ji’s guest retainer. They would not believe it even if you beat them to death.

In their view, Ye Yuan definitely got his position by relying on the virtue of his looks.

Seeing those young masters’ looks, Luo Qi and Pei Lan, the two, exchanged a glance, both revealing gloating smiles.

Toward these hostile looks, Ye Yuan had a guileless look as well.

I’m just good-looking, and it’s my fault?

Who asked you all, these fiends, to all look like such disappointments to your parents?

After a round of small talk, someone suggested, “Your Highness Ka Xin, time is almost up. Let’s get to sparring?”

The fiend race loved fighting. This kind of gathering, it naturally could not dispense with fights.

But Ka Xin smiled slightly and said, “Sparring here and there daily, the few of us all know our backgrounds. Why don’t we change things up today, how’s that?”

The moment everyone heard, they immediately had their interest aroused.

“Oh? What kind of novelty does Your Highness Ka Xin have?”

Ka Xin smiled faintly and said, “A family’s strength isn’t just dependent on the few of us. The family guards’ strength is also very important. Why not today, everybody let their family guards compete? How’s that?”

The moment everyone heard, they immediately revealed a knowing smile.

This move was clearly targeted at Ye Yuan.

“Fine idea! What Your Highness Ka Xin said is right, the family guards’ strength represents a family’s strength to a very large extent!” The moment Ka Xin’s voice faded, someone immediately concurred.

But the moment Li Ji heard this, she panicked and was just about to speak, but she was held back by Fan Yu.

Fan Yu smiled and said, “What Your Highness Ka Xin said is right, Fan Yu agrees.”

“You!” Li Ji said angrily.

Fan Yu’s brows furrowed, shooting a fierce glare at Li Ji.

Li Ji’s entire body trembled but did not dare to speak anymore.

This kind of gathering seemed simple. Actually, it was also the venue for the various major families to contend in secret too.

Cowering at this time, that would utterly lose the Fan Family’s face.

Ka Xin smiled and said, “Since that’s the case, we have eight people here. Each person comes up with three household guards, battle in pairs, all the way until the three people are all eliminated. Uh ... since it’s the household guards’ competition, let’s add a little more stakes.”

As he said, Ka Xin took out a small bottle. Inside was filled with a paste-like black substance.

The moment the guest house guards saw, a wave of exclamations immediately burst out.

“It’s the Blackjade Profound Spirit Ointment! This is a body-tempering holy medicine!”

“With it, I might be able to break through to Three-star fiend commander!”

“Heh, this Blackjade Profound Spirit Ointment is mine! Whoever dares to snatch with me, the outcome is death!”

...

Even Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up too.

This Blackjade Profound Spirit Ointment was a Two-star body-tempering holy medicine. His body-refinement realm had always been stuck at the grand completion realm of the first transformation and kept failing to break through.

With this Blackjade Profound Spirit Ointment, breaking through was a thing to be expected.

Lian Hua smiled sweetly and said, “Since Big Brother is so generous, I can’t be too stingy either, right? This Emerald Jade Metalheart Pearl will be my stake.”

“Hiss ...”

Another wave of cold breaths being sucked in spread out.

Along with each and every one of the stakes being brought out, the group of house guards’ eyes all gave off envy, becoming incomparably fervent.
