Chapter 2636: Great Battle Begin!

“Sect Master Feng, you can’t say that! As long as you all take the initiative to hand Ye Yuan over, and take the initiative to plant an origin divinity will, your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect will still be your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! From now on, you’ll be responsible for managing ascenders.”

Huangfu Cloudthink still had a faint smile, but the words said made the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect from top to bottom feel a bone-penetrating chill.

Planting an origin divinity will, it was becoming the Pill Alliance’s minion servant!

To proud ascenders, it was even more unacceptable than killing them!

Only then did people come to realize the truth. What Feng Xuanyi said was right. The Pill Alliance’s goal was not just Ye Yuan.

Feng Xuanyi suddenly gave a cold laugh and said, “Your esteemed self wouldn’t really think that my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect is easy to bully, right? Today, even if we fight until the last man, you all can forget about getting any bargain!”

As he said, a completely black long spear with electricity dancing around it appeared in Feng Xuanyi’s hands.

The moment the long spear appeared, the expressions of everyone present changed.

Huangfu Cloudthink was not surprised and said with a smile, “Heavenly spirit treasure, Heaven Killing Battlespear, the lifeblood treasure of Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s founding ancestor, Chu Tiange! Back then, Chu Tiange followed Zhuo Bufan and relied on this Heaven Killing Battlespear to kill until the four great heavenly regions were terrified! Today, it finally sees the light of day once more?”

On the Rainclear Continent, treasures were divided into three levels, mortal spirit, earthly spirit, and heavenly spirit!

Heavenly spirit treasures were extremely seldom-seen existences on the entire Rainclear Continent.

When Ye Yuan saw the Heaven Killing Battlespear, he was stunned.

The undulations coming off from this battle spear were actually identical with his Heavenspan Mountain.

Ye Yuan could jump realms to kill an enemy by wielding the Heavenspan Mountain. It could be seen that this treasure was not at all inferior to it as well. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Feng Xuanyi snorted coldly and said, “You really know quite a bit!”

Huangfu Cloudthink smiled and said, “It’s just a shame. Chu Tiange was a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse of his generation. This battle spear can unleash 120% power in his hands. But you probably can’t even unleash 70% of it!”

Above Jade Sovereign Heaven was Saint Sovereign Heaven!

It was just that at present, Saint Sovereign Heavens were already extinct on Rainclear Continent.

This step was far too difficult!

“It’s enough to deal with you!”

Feng Xuanyi gave a cold cry, his body turning into a streak of electricity, shooting straight for Huangfu Cloudthink.

In order to catch bandits, round up the ringleader first!

This was the only lease of life that Feng Xuanyi saw!

However, right at the moment that Feng Xuanyi moved, Xiao Feibai moved too.

It was only to see his entire person transform into a sharp sword, clashing with Feng Xuanyi instantaneously.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The two people instantly exchanged more than ten moves above the void.

Evenly-matched!

What made people despair even more was that the undulations of the sword in Xiao Feibai’s hand were actually not the slightest bit inferior to the Heaven Killing Battlespear!

An elder cried out in despair, “Heavenly spirit treasure! The sword in that Pill Alliance powerhouse’s hand is a heavenly spirit treasure as well!”

This Pill Alliance’s strength was powerful until it made people lose all hope.

They even had heavenly spirit treasures.

“Your opponent isn’t me!”

Huangfu Cloudthink had an indifferent look as he turned to Ye Yuan and said, “Ye Yuan, you killed the holy son. Are you willing to join my Pill Alliance and become the new holy son?”

“What?! The Pill Alliance actually wants Ye Yuan to directly become the holy son!”

“It turns out that they are not taking revenge for the holy son, but took a fancy on Ye Yuan’s strength!”

“To be able to have the Pill Alliance take such great pains, Ye Yuan’s alchemy path strength is likely not the slightest bit worse when compared to the Pill Alliance’s powerhouses!”

… …

Huangfu Cloudthink’s words immediately caused an uproar in the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

They all thought that the Pill Alliance came to denounce publicly for crimes.

Who knew that the moment Huangfu Cloudthink opened his mouth, he actually wanted to solicit Ye Yuan.

For a moment, everyone looked over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan had no joy nor sorrow on his face, no inclinations could be seen.

After being silent for a moment, he suddenly opened his mouth and said, “If I agree, can the Pill Alliance let the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect off or not?”

Everyone trembled all over, after which, their eyes revealed hopeful looks.

But Huangfu Cloudthink shook his head and said coolly, “The Pill Alliance has the intention to unify the Five Great Heavenly Regions. However, the five great heavenly sects are stubborn and unruly. They are the Pill Alliance’s greatest stumbling blocks! Actually, the Pill Alliance’s plan to devour the five great heavenly sects was currently being carried out systematically. But, your appearance completely disrupted our plans! If not for so, we also wouldn’t resort to this plan, to forcefully attack the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! What follows can’t dispense with a bout of bloody battle!”

Huangfu Cloudthink’s words made everyone stare wide-eyed and tongue-tied.

It turned out that the Pill Alliance’s ambition was actually so great, to actually want to swallow the entire Five Great Heavenly Regions!

Compared to native factions, the five great heavenly sects’ ascenders not only had formidable strength, but their personality was also arrogant and unyielding.

Wanting to make them submit was even harder than ascending to the heavens.

Therefore, the Pill Alliance had long been planning it out, to slowly gobble up the Five Great Heavenly Regions.

But who would have expected that someone threw a wrench in the works? Ye Yuan’s domineering rise completely disrupted the Pill Alliance’s plan.

And Ye Yuan even made Holy Son Cang Yongning perish in the alchemy battle.

Hence, that was why the Pill Alliance was forced to dispatch troops to attack the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

But, after destroying the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect and destroying the Pill Pavilion, when facing the other four great heavenly sects, the Pill Alliance would have already walked to the front of the stage from behind the scenes. They would surely have to face a bloody battle.

And this sort of situation was not what the Pill Alliance wanted.

In a way, Ye Yuan’s domineering rise brought tremendous losses to the Pill Alliance.

Ye Yuan looked at Huangfu Cloudthink and said coolly, “Since that’s the case, then there’s nothing to discuss. Fight then!”

Huangfu Cloudthink’s eyes turned sharp and he said, “Ye Yuan, your talent is above Holy Son’s, it’s too much of a pity to die like this! Do you really want to fight?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “For a man, death is but dying. Why would I fear a fight?”

His words made the countenances of the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciples change.

This was his only lease of life, Ye Yuan actually gave it up just like that!

Previously, Ye Yuan was still being universally condemned.

One could say that ever since he entered the sect, he had been enduring criticism every minute and second.

But he did not grumble in the least bit!

In this moment of life and death, he chose to live and die together with the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect!

“Hahaha?… Well said! My good brother, I didn’t misjudge you! Sect Master, I’ll come and help you!” Luo Yunqing laughed wildly, drawing his sword and looking around.

The moment he moved, the Pill Alliance’s side also moved!

More than 100 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses rushed over in succession.

The great battle shocked the heavens!

It was just a pity that on the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s side, there were only a scanty 20 over Jade Sovereign Heavens, virtually one person had to face seven to eight people by themselves!

Although ascenders had unparalleled combat power, they also could not fend off such a huge difference in numbers.

Huangfu Cloudthink smiled slightly and said, “Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s people, whoever takes Ye Yuan down can not only not die, you can even have a place in the Pill Alliance!”

At this time, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect still had a small portion of people who were hesitating.

Among them, included Shi Feiyu!

Huangfu Cloudthink’s words made his two eyes lit up.

Almost without hesitation, he rushed toward Ye Yuan!

“Brat, he who understands the times is a wise man! Alliance Chief Huangfu already made you the holy son, what are you still discontented with?” Shi Feiyu said with a cold smile.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions changed.

No one expected that Shi Feiyu could actually do such a shameless thing!

But his strength was too strong!
