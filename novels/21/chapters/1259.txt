Chapter 1263: Half-Deity Realm

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

To other people, Tier 9 grand completion and Half-Deity Realm still had an immense gap.

Because even if one’s Essence, Energy, and Spirit, all reached grand completion, it was also not Half-Deity Realm.

Heart realm grand completion, this hurdle, stumped countless heroes.

But what Ye Yuan was lacking was merely just on aspect of essence energy realm.

Of course, essence energy realm reaching peak Divine King also could not be accomplished with one stroke.

But Ye Yuan could.

Exchanging blows the last time, Ye Yuan had merely just stepped into becoming a first-rate divine king.

They had just separated not long ago, and Ye Yuan actually directly broke through already.

This was the part that Li Gui was really shocked at.

Even when placed in their era, he had never seen before such rapid breakthrough as well.

“What are you still waiting for? Take the opportunity when he’s breaking through and directly take his life!”

Zhuge Qingxuan’s tone was somber but revealed some anxiousness.

“What the hell do you know? He has already triggered Half-Deity Realm and merged the Essence, Energy, and Spirit, three paths, achieving Half-Deity Realm! Going forward to kill him at this time is opposing the Heavenly Dao. You’ll be annihilated straight away! If you want to die, go forward. At most, this deity will find another physical body!” Li Gui scolded angrily. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Humph! Didn’t you claim to be a peak Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouse? To actually not even dare face the breakthrough of Half-Deity Realm!” Zhuge Qingxuan said with a cold smile.

“It’s useless even if you goad me! If it were a million years ago, this deity really wouldn’t take this level of Heavenly Dao seriously. But now ... heh heh.”

The meaning of his words was naturally that he did not dare to make a move against Ye Yuan anymore.

Although Zhuge Qingxuan was anxious, he also knew that Li Gui’s hatred toward Ye Yuan was even stronger than his. If the tribulation was able to kill him, Li Gui absolutely would not make a move.

“Then Could it be that we’re going to watch him break through just like this?” Zhuge Qingxuan said solemnly.

“Even if he breaks through to the Half-Deity Realm, it’s also merely the strength of Divine Dao second-stage. Although your physical body is a little shabby, this deity still has some confidence in dealing with him!” Li Gui said.

Zhuge Qingxuan unexpectedly did not refute Li Gui’s words. Ye Yuan breaking through to Half-Deity Realm, he could already completely crush him in terms of realm.

Actually, Zhuge Qingxuan had long cultivated Essence, Energy, and Spirit, three paths, to grand completion already. Except, that final heart realm boundary kept failing to break through to the realm of Heaven Man Unity.”

This disparity with Ye Yuan was not a tiny bit.

Li Gui was not shitting on him, but merely stating a face.

...

At this moment, Ye Yuan finally experienced what was called Heaven Man Unity!

That moment when his essence energy reached grand completion, Ye Yuan produced a kind of wondrous resonance with the Heavenly Dao.

His Essence, Energy, and Spirit, three paths, reached unprecedented harmony at this moment.

“Mortals come from the Earth, the Earth is born from Heaven, Heaven originates from Dao, Dao is the source! This is the Half-Deity Realm!”

Ye Yuan felt that he was unprecedentedly powerful.

Previous life, Ye Yuan had similarly reached peak Divine King. But this feeling now was completely different from that time.

Essence energy, fleshy body, divine soul, under the mediation of Heaven Man Unity, became an entity formed by nature.

No matter which path one chooses, the other two paths would provide a massive compounding power.

Just this step and Ye Yuan felt a world of difference from his strength before!

No wonder Fang Tian was able to have an earth-shaking great battle with Kanuo. Such strength had virtually reached the limits under Deity Realm already.

But Ye Yuan sensed that he was currently in a kind of critical state.

That fleeting and ephemeral Deity Realm seemed to be within arm’s length!

In the Divine Dao Era, there was originally no so-called Half-Deity Realm.

Being able to cultivate the heart realm to the Heaven Man Unity grand completion, breaking through to the Deity Realm was virtually something that happened without extra effort.

Because this step was the critical step to break through to the Deity Realm!

With the heart realm as the mediator, perfectly reconciling Essence, Energy, and Spirit, touching that fleeting and ephemeral Heavenly Dao. This was the crucial step to become a deity.

But when Ye Yuan attempted to touch that Heavenly Dao, he discovered that he could not touch it at all.

Not too high to reach, just unable to touch!

That sort of feeling was just like someone who used strength to grab something. As a result, the person grabbed too hard and missed, extremely dispirited.

That Heavenly Dao was absent!

It did not exist!

At this moment, Ye Yuan finally understood Fang Tian’s feelings.

This feeling of being within arm’s length, but also out of reach, simply made people go crazy.

“Jeje, this feeling of wanting to breakthrough, but being unable to break through, is unpleasant, right?” Li Gui said sarcastically.

Ye Yuan shot him an indifferent glance and said, “Aren’t you even more pitiful than I am? Clearly have peak Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm’s divine soul, but you’re being suppressed at Half-Deity Realm. It’s very unpleasant, right?”

Li Gui’s expression turned cold, and he said in a cold voice, “What a razor-tongued brat! You ruined my million years of bitter effort, today, I’ll make your blood-debt in blood!”

Sure enough, even though Ye Yuan had touched upon Heavenly Dao, he had not experienced it personally before.

But Li Gui clearly had that strength but was forcefully suppressed at Half-Deity Realm. This made people even more depressed.

That sort of feeling was like he wanted to emerge out of the surface of the water but forcefully had his head pressed down by someone.

And yet, he could not lift his head.

“Bring it on. I want to experience a bit just what kind of strength peak Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm is like,” Ye Yuan said disdainfully.

Li Gui’s fury was finally incited by Ye Yuan.

It was only to see his face turned cold. The surrounding space immediately wailed with ghostly shrieks and howls.

Countless savage ghostly figures blotted out the skies and covered the earth and chomped down towards Ye Yuan.

“Hundred Ghosts Devouring the Soul!”

This move was the cumulation of essence energy and Ghost Dao. Not only did it harm the person’s body, it similarly had tremendous damage on the divine soul.

With Li Gui’s laws boundary, this move naturally could not be underestimated.

However, Ye Yuan did not have the slightest change in countenance on his face. The Evil Extermination Sword suddenly attacked. An incomparably pure sword energy flew everywhere, charging over towards those fierce ghosts.

“Monumental Sword!”

With righteous air in one’s chest, heroism was unbeatable1!

The moment this move was unleashed, it possessed the might of heaven and earth, and at the same time, it was the jinx of those ferocious ghosts!

Ye Yuan displaying this move with Half-Deity Realm, the power naturally could not be mentioned in the same breath. It was no idea how many times stronger than before!

In less than ten breaths, those ferocious ghosts were slaughtered clean.

Seeing this scene, Li Gui’s expression could not help changing.

He naturally knew about Ye Yuan’s Monumental Sword. He did not hope for this move to be able to cause any damage to Ye Yuan’s main body.

His true target was Ye Yuan’s divine soul.

But ... Ye Yuan seemed to be completely fine. He was utterly immune to this divine soul attack!

“What moves do you still have, feel free to use them!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ye Yuan naturally knew that this move of Li Gui’s contained an exceedingly powerful divine soul attack. But regarding divine soul attacks, he did not need to defend at all.

With the Soul Suppressing Pearl around, any divine soul attacks were existences like paper tigers.

“Humph! Damn Absolute Heaven, truly lingering on persistently! Since that’s the case, I want to take a look at whether or not your successor can withstand my Undying Ghost Slaughter move!”

Li Gui smiled coldly. A terrifying divine soul power spread out. Heaven and earth changed colors because of it!
