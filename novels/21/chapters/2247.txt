Chapter 2251: A Slim Chance of Survival!

Ye Yuan did not follow up, his brain was in the midst of rapidly revolving.

It seemed like he still underestimated these two Deva Realm powerhouses’ resolve toward the Limitless God Killing Bow.

The allure of Dao artifacts was too great!

Men die in pursuit of wealth, birds die in pursuit of food.

In order to obtain the Limitless God Killing Bow, Riverword almost threw away even his life.

And these two Deva Realms clearly would not give up so easily either. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Shui Yuan and Lonesoul definitely found a tracking expert. Furthermore, this tracking expert is very proficient in array formations! To be able to get invited by them, it must be a Deva Realm powerhouse too!” Ye Yuan analyzed.

Shui Yuan and Lonesoul, two great Deva Realm powerhouses, their reputation was extremely resounding. It was impossible for Riverword to not know them.

Ye Yuan also learned of these two people’s names from his mouth.

Riverword’s face changed and he said with a look of despair, “Then it’s definitely Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye! His heavenly eye is able to see through all that’s unreal. He is even able to cast time recall! Little Friend Ye, leave me behind and escape for your life by yourself!”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “It’s too late! Even if you hand the Limitless God Killing Bow to them, will they let me go? I originally thought that I did it flawlessly. I didn’t expect that there’s still a divine ability like Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s. Looks like it was me who underestimated Deva Realm powerhouses!”

Riverword heaved a sigh, knowing that what Ye Yuan said was true.

Ye Yuan already got involved in the muddy waters. It was very hard to get out.

Even if he handed over the Limitless God Killing Bow, these few Deva Realm powerhouses absolutely would not let Ye Yuan go.

As for him, he was currently merely a cripple.

“Little Friend Ye, it’s me who dragged you down!” Riverword said with a sigh.

Even if he was an old monster who had lived for no idea how many years, he felt grateful toward Ye Yuan too.

If it were others, they would have long killed and snatched the treasure.

Not only did Ye Yuan not take away the Limitless God Killing Bow, he even treated his wounds.

He went from the initial vigilance to the current shedding tears of gratitude.

Unfortunately ...

“Senior Riverword, do you know what place has extremely powerful restrictions that even Deva Realm powerhouses are extremely fearful of?” Ye Yuan suddenly asked.

“Restrictions?” Riverword was stunned.

“That’s right! This is our only way out!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Fleeing along the way, Ye Yuan ran through all of his trump cards. Only in the path of array formations did he had a lease of life!

These three people were all Deva Realm powerhouses, their strength significantly stronger than even Nineorigin’s.

Even if he took them into the chaos world, it would also be impossible for Ye Yuan to have any chances of victory.

As for whatever Time Freeze, with his current strength, it would cause negligible interference to Deva Realm powerhouses.

The only path that remained was the Dao of array formations!

Riverword was an old monster who had lived for a trillion years, his understanding of the Heavenspan World must be a lot more than his, that was why there was this ask.

Riverword had a strange expression as he said, “Restrictions that made even Deva Realm powerhouses dread, it will be an even more dangerous place to us!”

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “Do you want to die or live?”

Riverword said, “Of course I want to live!”

Ye Yuan said, “Want to live then stop talking nonsense! Is there such a place or not?”

Riverword said, “If talking about powerful restrictions, a place that made even Deva Realms dread, then there’s only ... Eight Void Mountain!”

Ye Yuan clearly had not heard of this name before, saying, “Eight Void Mountain?”

Riverword said, “Eight Void Mountain Range is the junction between the Middle Realms and West Realms, the boundary of two worlds, stretching continuously for a trillion miles! And on its main peak, Eight Void Mountain, there are powerful restrictions everywhere. Legends have it that the Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions were set up by an ancient major power overnight and had once annihilated countless powerhouses before. The restrictions there stretch for 80 million miles, being incomparably massive! But there are indeed many major lucky chances there. Quite a number of people will brave the risk to go there and seek out lucky chances. There is even no lack of Deva Realm powerhouses. And many Deva Realm powerhouses died there.”

When Ye Yuan heard, he was extremely shocked in his heart too.

Overnight, vast restrictions that spanned 80 million miles were formed. It was simply unimaginable.

How powerful a Formation Dao master to be able to set it up!

Ye Yuan’s present Formation Dao strength was absolutely great grandmaster class.

But even making him set up 8000 miles of restrictions overnight, he would find it extremely difficult to do.

This was the difference in level!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent and he said, “Okay, go there! You lead the way!”

Shinra Ghost Region was in the southwestern lands. They just had to keep on flying in the northeastern direction and they would be able to reach Eight Void Mountain.

Both sides, one party chased and the other fled. Their speed was swift to the extreme.

However, both parties’ distance was gradually shrinking.

In merely half a day’s time, it shrunk from the initial one million miles to only 500 thousand miles currently.

At this rate, in merely half a day’s time, the three Deva Realm powerhouses would be able to catch up.

“Brat, run away! This Deva wants to see how far you can run!” Behind came Shui Yuan’s smug laughter.

With the strength of Deva Realm, sending out their voices with divine essence, it was not anything hard to transmit it for several hundred thousand miles.

Heavenly Eye was still alright, but Shui Yuan and Lonesoul two people had a stomach full of pent-up anger.

The two of them fought for the Limitless God Killing Bow until the sky and earth dimmed.

But who knew that a snipe and a clam were locked in a fight, it was only to the advantage of the fisherman. In the end, it was actually snatched away by a Riverword who did not want his life.

However, just as they were about to catch Riverword, Ye Yuan rescued Riverword.

The two people did not have any solution, and so they spent a huge price to request Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye to take action.

With the unexpected turn of events, they finally found the perpetrator now, the two people’s anger could be imagined.

The two of them wished to tear Ye Yuan apart right now.

Ye Yuan was not affected at all, still increasing his speed to the limit.

But Riverword frowned hard and said, “No way! We can’t last until Eight Void Mountain like this!”

Ye Yuan said, “Is there any place ahead with irregular space?”

Riverword’s eyes lit up and he said, “There is! Go north! With your speed, you’ll reach it in at most half a day!”

Ye Yuan did not say another word, immediately making a turn and headed north.

Riverword was secretly shocked, he discovered that Ye Yuan’s mind was too stoic.

Under such enormous pressure, he could still maintain such calm, it was simply not like what a young man should have.

He had lived for a trillion years and also felt that he was not as cool as Ye Yuan.

Currently, both parties were on a flat road, there was not the slightest bit of ripple in space.

This way, even if Ye Yuan urged his speed to the limit, he would still be unable to shake off the three people.

But going to an irregular space, Ye Yuan’s spatial law would be able to unleash its greatest effect.

In irregular space, even though Ye Yuan’s speed would be affected too, the impact on those three people would be greater!

This way, the advantage of Ye Yuan’s spatial law would be magnified, shaking off the three people from there.

Originally, this idea should have been thought of by him, this old man. But he had long already lost his cool.

In an environment where one could not see any hope at all, people who were able to keep their cool were truly very few.

But Ye Yuan was not affected in the least bit.

Starting from discovering these three people, Ye Yuan’s mind did not have the least bit of fluctuation, calm until he was like an ice-cold machine!

Just how on earth did this boy accomplish it?
