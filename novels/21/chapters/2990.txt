Chapter 2989: Contingency Plan!

“Senior Long Ran, there’s no need for me to say anything more, right?”

In a secret cave of the Dragon Abyss Tribe, Ye Yuan put away the light screen in front of him and said calmly.

This Ye Yuan was his human soul clone, the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique.

He naturally would not venture into this fake Heavenly Dragon Island without due consideration. Otherwise, it would be sending himself to death.

Hence, he found this hidden cave under Mi Tian’s guidance. It was Dragon Abyss Tribe’s progenitor Long Ran’s cave abode. He was a Hegemon Realm powerhouse.

In order to convince Long Ran, Mi Tian directly revealed his identity.

But if Ye Yuan said that the Heavenly Dragon Island was actually laying their hands on their own people, Long Ran would not believe it even if he was beaten to death.

After all, the Heavenly Dragon Island was the dragon race’s holy land.

Therefore, Ye Yuan split his origin divinity into two, leaving his human soul clone here.

Then he used a soul race secret technique to share what the dragon race soul clone saw and heard, displaying his experience on the light screen.

Shock was written all over Long Ran’s face, his heart in wrenching pain and bitter hatred.

Long Yi did not recognize the people there, but Long Ran knew many of them in the water prison!

During these 100 thousand years, those geniuses who entered Heavenly Dragon Island actually all entered the Blood Dragon island!

Some were no longer around.

Some became like disembodied ghosts.

“Why? Why! WHY! Why would Heavenly Dragon Island lay their hands on their own clansmen?” Long Ran practically roared out.

He was too disappointed!

Too shocked!

Heavenly Dragon Island had deceived them for 100 thousand years!

These 100 thousand years, how many geniuses had the East Billow Region produced?

These geniuses actually all died at the hands of their own people!

Seeing the miserable appearances of those younger generation disciples, Long Ran felt heartache to the extreme.

Ye Yuan clearly saw tears at the corners of his eyes.

In reality, the killing intent in Ye Yuan’s chest could no longer be contained too.

To be able to make a Hegemon Realm who had lived for several hundred thousand years shed tears, it could be seen how tragic Blood Dragon Island’s situation was!

War and death were very tragic.

But, using some fresh lives to do human experimentation, this kind of cruelty simply could not be described.

Animals were better!

“Because of the blood race! They exploited Heavenly Dragon Island’s ambition!” Ye Yuan said.

Long Ran’s pupils constricted, his gaze gradually turning cold as he said, “Come!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Three days later, several hundred powerhouses from more than ten major tribes set off for Blood Dragon Island!

… …

“Lord Bloodless!” The Divine Dragon Envoy said respectfully to the blood race powerhouse in front of him.

When Ye Yuan saw this blood race powerhouse, his pupils could not help constricting.

Hegemon Realm!

There was actually a Hegemon Realm on this Blood Dragon Island!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan could feel that this Hegemon Realm was very strong.

He originally thought that the Divine Dragon Envoy was responsible for Blood Dragon Island.

Did not expect that there was actually such a powerhouse.

Could Long Ran be his match?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan was not sure whether or not there would be other Hegemon Realms on this island.

This was somewhat troublesome!

But at this time, the arrow was already notched on the bow and had no choice but to release.

Bloodless swept a glance over everyone, his gaze finally stopping on Ye Yuan, and he said in pleasant surprise, “This batch is pretty good! Especially this kid; having a human physical body but his bloodline power is extremely strong! A fine sapling! Perhaps, our blood bestowal can obtain great success this time!”

Divine Dragon Envoy said in pleasant surprise, “Your Excellency, could it be …”

Bloodless nodded with a smile and said, “Heaven rewards the faithful. The new Conversion Blood Crystals are finally out. With these, we’ll be able to control those berserk guys.”

Divine Dragon Envoy was agitated until he was almost weeping and said, “Lord Bloodless has toiled hard and rendered great merits. The dragon race is endlessly grateful!”

Bloodless smiled and said, “We’re an organic whole, bound together for good or ill. What’s the talk about toiling hard and rendering great merits? We need to wait for another two days, and the Conversion Blood Crystals will be able to come out. Lock them up first and fuse two days later!”

The Divine Dragon Envoy waved his hand, commanding people to take Ye Yuan and the others away, and to lock them in the water prison.

There were handcuffs on their hands, shackles on their legs, and the water prison even had powerful restrictions.

This bunch of people was practically waiting for death.

Feng Qingxuan said in despair, “Ye Yuan, you’ve doomed me this time! If this young lady dies here, I won’t let you off even if I become a ghost!”

Crack!

Her voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan’s handcuffs fell right off.

Everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied.

“This … isn’t your bloodline sealed …” Long Yi looked at Ye Yuan and said with a look of shock.

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled, and he said, “My bloodline can’t be sealed.”

Got to be kidding. He had the origin of blood. It was the source of all bloodlines.

Seal his bloodline?

It did not exist!

Feng Qingxuan said excitedly, “Hurry! Quickly untie me!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Not yet!”

Feng Qingxuan’s face turned black, and she said in a solemn voice, “Why?”

Ye Yuan said, “I’m going to scout out this underground city. Bringing you all along is too cumbersome.”

Feng Qingxuan and Long Yi were speechless.

Ye Yuan said, “All of you hold your horses. In less than three days, someone will come and save us.”

Long Yi said, “But powerhouses are plentiful like clouds here. There are even Hegemon Realm powerhouses! Even if people come, they can’t save us too!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then if your ancestor comes out of retirement?”

Long Yi’s entire body trembled, and he said, “You’re saying … Ancestor Long Ran? This … How is this possible?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “His elderly self has already moved out and is currently calling the various major tribes to set off for Blood Dragon Island! At that time, blood will flow into rivers!”

Feng Qingxuan said in shock, “It turns out that those few days, you went to meet the Dragon Abyss Tribe’s progenitor? You, this fellow, you hid from me so bitterly!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “This kind of thing, the less you know, the better. If you reveal any flaws, not only will it waste all the previous efforts, you’ll even doom all of us!”

Feng Qingxuan’s face turned black. This guy really did not show mercy when knocking someone down a notch!

However, she also knew that what Ye Yuan said was right.

But what Feng Qingxuan was surprised by was that Ye Yuan acted too well along the way!

All of his expressions were just right.

He got angry when he should get angry, panicked when he should panic, and even when he should posture, he postured very adequately.

Feng Qingxuan did not expect that this guy still had this side!

Meanwhile, Long Yi and the others were shocked to the extreme.

Ye Yuan’s meaning was that he had long anticipated everything, and he made complete arrangements!

How did he discover it?

The entire East Billow Region was kept in the dark!

How could a measly little Ye Yuan actually detect it?

“Brother Ye, since you’ve already seen through everything, why do you still let yourself get caught in danger?” Scarletplume said in confusion.

Ye Yuan’s eyes turned cold, and he said, “Originally, I thought that the Divine Dragon Envoy was being controlled by the blood race. So I wanted to come and probe. But then I didn’t expect that the truth is actually like this! The blood race and Heavenly Dragon Island joined hands to inflict great suffering on the living! If I didn’t sneak in, I also wouldn’t have seen such a ghastly sight!”

The moment these words came out, the few geniuses revealed indignant expressions.

Indeed, when they saw each and every one of those seniors being turned into things that were less than animals, the killing intent in their hearts could not be contained too.

“But, even if these can’t seal your bloodline, this water prison is being sealed by powerful restrictions. How will you get out?” Feng Qingxuan asked.

Ye Yuan got up and said coolly, “You all stay here first. Make sure not to reveal anything. I’ll be right back!”

Finished saying, his figure moved, passing right through the door!
