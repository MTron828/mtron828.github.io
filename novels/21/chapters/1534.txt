Chapter 1538 Didn“t Expect That . . . It“s So Easy

The shopkeeper had an embarrassed look, stammering and somewhat unable to speak.

‘Will grant all request,’ these words, no medicine shop dared to say it.

If they treated someone to death or could not refine the medicinal pill, that would really be smacking their own face swollen.

Furthermore, Cinnamon Street was out-of-the-way. This small shop of theirs did not attract people’s attention. Otherwise, this place would have long been rallied and attacked by their peers.

But the shopkeeper knew that this kind of thing could not be avoided. It would be known by people sooner or later.

And this youth was likely the first one dropping in to find fault.

“Hey, shopkeeper, I’m asking you something, talk! Since you guys will grant all requests, then I’ll request for a pill right now! Do you dare to accept, shopkeeper?”

The youth had an overbearing appearance, forcing the shopkeeper back several steps.

The shopkeeper also wanted to say yes, but he did not have the confidence!

One look and it was clear that this youth was a wealthy young master. He was clearly here to cause trouble. So how could the medicinal pill he requested be easy to refine?

“This ... This ...” The shopkeeper’s head was full of sweat, not knowing how he should answer.

The corners of the youth’s mouth curled and she said disdainfully, “If you don’t have the ability, pretending to be capable for what?! Hey, this ... young master will tear down your signboard!”

“Y-Young Master, this ... this isn’t good, right?” Little Huan felt very embarrassed by her ‘young master’s overbearing appearance and urged.

“What’s not good? They dared to make this boast, do they still not let people tear down this plaque?” the youth said unrelentingly.

Right then, a young man came out from behind the screen, opened his mouth, and said indifferently, “Miss, what medicinal pill you want to ask for, just feel free to say. Tearing down people’s signboard at the drop of a hat, this isn’t good.”

Ye Yuan’s words were said very calmly, seemingly forgotten that he had just torn down people’s signboard a few days ago and even forced them to change their gang’s name.

Uh ... this was voluntary, not forced.

That youth could not help being somewhat surprised when she saw Ye Yuan see through her at one glance. Soon after, she was a little angry.

This guy, the logic of not exposing when seen through, did he not understand?

But saw the corners of her mouth curl and she said disdainfully, “And I was wondering, this signboard was hung by you, right?”

Ye Yuan said without any change in countenance: “So what if yes?”

“So what? Huhu. what a big tone! Do you think that you’re the Medicine Ancestor? Will grant all requests! This ... young lady will tear down this signboard of yours today!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Tearing down my signboard, you need to have the ability to do it.”

“Ha! Look at you, brat. Age isn’t old, tone really isn’t small! You wait!”

This girl suddenly turned around and ran out of the hall, coming to the street. Cupping her hands around her mouth, she shouted loudly, “Hey, everyone come over and take a look, everyone come and see!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

With her shouting, there were immediately quite a few people who were drawn over.

Even though Cinnamon Street was in a remote place, it more or less had some popularity. Otherwise, the Thunderclap Gang would not open a small shop here either.

The girl sneered coldly and thought to herself, Aren’t you very cocky? So many people watching, when you can’t refine the medicinal pill in a while, I want to see how you clean up the mess! This signboard of yours, this young lady is bent on tearing it down today!

Seeing this scene, the shopkeeper’s heart thumped and secretly thought to himself that it was over.

But an imperceptible smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth. This ... seemed to be pretty good too.

Little Huan had an embarrassed look and said to Ye Yuan, “This sir, really sorry, my family’s young lady has a personality that craves for the world to be plunged into chaos.”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a smile, “No harm, let her make trouble.”

The shopkeeper gave Ye Yuan a sidelong glance, thinking to himself, you’re about to fold up for good soon, still let her cause trouble ...

With this, he was going to lose his job.

Seeing everyone gather over, the girl was pleased with herself inwardly, but her face was indignant as she said, “Everyone, look at this small shop. It actually writes will grant all requests. I think this medicinal shop’s alchemist must be very impressive! Today, this young master will let everyone test the water, let everyone see if this little medicine shop is really a lair of undiscovered talents!”

With her shouting, it immediately caught everyone’s attention.

“Eh, when did this plaque of Miracle Hand Parlor hang up? How come I didn’t know?”

“Will grant all requests! What high-sounding sentiments!”

“Those major medicinal shops in the inner city don’t dare to hang this kind of plaque too, right?”

...

Miracle Hand Parlor was this small medicine shop’s name. It had also been on Cinnamon Street for some years already. Everyone had long become used to it.

The shopkeeper quietly hung this plaque out, afraid of drawing people’s attention.

Now, it was good, this lassie directly attracted all the people here.

A look of despair appeared on the shopkeeper’s face.

This lassie was too ruthless!

Done talking, that girl turned around and said to Ye Yuan, “Hey, kid, dare to come out or not? In front of everyone, let’s take a look at how impressive this ‘will grant all requests’ of yours is!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and slowly came out. He clasped his hands at everyone and said, “How do you do, neighbors? This Miracle Hand Parlor will be managed by me, Ye Yuan, in the future! Whatever rare or puzzling illness everybody has, pill refinement and medicine, you can all come and find me. Below rank four, all demands will be satisfied[1]!”

“Ha, this kid really dares to brag!”

“Below rank four, all demands will be satisfied. This boast is bragged too hard, right?”

“Isn’t the Miracle Hand Parlor the Dragon Slaying Gang’s territory? Where did this punk pop out from?”

...

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone burst into an uproar all at once.

The girl narrowed her eyes, looking at Ye Yuan with a sneer in her heart.

Still pretending!

In a while, I see how you wind up the matter!

Kid who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!

“Heh, Master Ye, since you’re so incredible, then I’ll request a pill from you right now!” That girl said.

Ye Yuan did a go ahead hand gesture and said, “Requesting pill, prepare your own spirit medicine and pill formula. Rank three divine pills starts from one million divine essence stones.”

“Hiss ...”

The moment these words came out, that girl could not help opening her mouth wide and said in shock, “One million divine essence stones? Why don’t you go and rob people?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “My medicinal pills are worth this price!”

Wildly arrogant!

Truly wildly conceited!

Master Wu Feng’s medicinal pills were not so expensive either!

This kid was crazy for money, right?

Looking at Ye Yuan’s appearance that asked for a beating, that girl could not help feeling exasperated and said, “Fine! I, Ning Siyu, want to try what kind of medicinal pill you can refine! Here, pill formula and spirit medicines are all inside this storage ring! If you can’t refine, I’ll smash your signboard on the spot!”

Ye Yuan received the storage ring and took out the pill formula and took a look, involuntarily showing a look of surprise on his face.

When Ning Siyu saw Ye Yuan’s expression, she could not help saying with a cold smile, “How is it? Stunned, right? Watch me smash your signboard!”

Done talking, she leaped up and was going to smash the signboard.

But her body had just flew into midair and had her ankle caught by Ye Yuan, and was forcefully dragged down.

“You! So many people are watching, you dare to go back on your word?” Ning Siyu said angrily.

Ye Yuan glanced at her indifferently and said, “When did I say that I can’t refine it?”

Ning Siyu sneered and said, “Your expression just now already betrayed your thoughts!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “I thought that you’d give me some difficult problem. Didn’t expect that ... it’s so easy.”

[1] Rank four = Four-star. For some reason, author actually seem to use this more than the star system. Previously, I’ve been converting it to star. But now, I think I’ll translate it as it is. Just take note that they mean the same level.
