Chapter 1705 Wait for Him to Come!

“Well fought!”

“Beautifully done!”

“Finally vented this foul breath!”

“Vented this anger, but with Jian Yu’s temperament, he’ll definitely take revenge!”

“His elder brother, Jian Ping, is a member of the Profound Secrets Pavilion, his strength is very powerful!”

...

When everyone saw Jian Yu’s legs being broken, they immediately felt very appeased, shouts of bravo linking up together.

This Jian Yu, they normally did not dare to provoke at all. He had always played the tyrant on these few streets.

Today, someone finally came out to take care of him.

It was just that they could not help worry for Ye Yuan.

After all, the Jian Family’s people were not to be trifled with.

“Sir, it was all Xiaoran’s fault, s-sorry! You hurry up and go! That Jian Yu is very powerful. He won’t let you off!” Zhang Xiaoran supported Zhang Haotian as she said with a rueful look.

Ye Yuan did not speak, but walked in front of Zhang Haotian, and took out a medicinal pill for him to take.

That kick earlier was very heavy. Zhang Haotian’s injuries were not light and already could not speak.

Ye Yuan looked at Xiaoran and said with a smile, “Do you want to marry Jian Yu to be a concubine or not?”

Zhang Xiaoran shook her head repeatedly and said with a decisive look, “I won’t marry him even if I die!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Well, we’ll wait here for him to come.”

Zhang Xiaoran’s expression changed and she waved her hand and said, “No, no, no, Sir, you hurry up and leave! Jian Yu’s elder brother is a member of the Profound Secrets Pavilion.”

Ye Yuan revealed a hint of surprise when he heard that and said with a smile, “A member of the Profound Secrets Pavilion? Then perfect, I was just about to go to the Profound Secrets Pavilion.”

When the people beside heard Ye Yuan’s words, they could not help shaking their heads secretly.

This kid was simply a hothead. He completely did not know what Profound Secrets Pavilion represented in Extreme Light Imperial City!

“This sir, it was all this old man who dragged you in, truly sorry. You hurry up and go, you really can’t afford to provoke the Profound Secrets Pavilion! At most, this old man will fight it out to the death with them!” Zhang Haotian suddenly said. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Zhang Xiaoran got a fright. She suddenly discovered that Zhang Haotian’s complexion was ruddy, full of energy. He was actually completely recovered already!

This medicinal pill was also too miraculous, right?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Elder, your leg should have been injured by a Flatland Poison Wolf, right?”

Zhang Haotian froze, already at this point, he still had time to care about his leg?

However, he still nodded and said, “Yes. Back then, we husband and wife brought the newly-born Xiaoran back to Extreme Light Imperial City. Who knew that we encountered Flatland Poison Wolves halfway. Xiaoran’s mother did not hesitate to feed the wolves with her body in order to save Xiaoran, exchanging for us father and daughter two people to escape with our lives. However, this old man’s leg was still crippled. Sigh, the one who should have originally died should have been this old man, who knew ...”

Talking up to here, Zhang Haotian evoked a painful memory, tears running down his old face.

“Dad, don’t blame yourself anymore, this isn’t your fault!” Zhang Xiaoran was also in tears as he said.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that this father and daughter’s encounter was actually so tragic.

However, this was also the true portrayal of ordinary martial artists.

Not everyone could possess Ye Yuan’s heaven-defying talent and destiny.

The majority of martial artists were all struggling to survive at the bottom.

The toxicity of the Flatland Poison Wolf was very fierce and extremely hard to remove.

Hence, Zhang Haotian’s body aged very quickly too.

And his leg was also unable to regrow because of the toxins.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “I’ll treat it for you then.”

Zhang Haotian smiled bitterly and said, “The reason why we father and daughter are in such a state of poverty is because of this old man’s leg. These few years, this old man has sought countless medical treatments, but it can’t be cured at all.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s no big deal, just pricking a few needles will do.”

After talking, Ye Yuan took out a set of silver needles and started to apply acupuncture on Zhang Haotian’s severed leg.

“Kid, don’t show off your skill anymore. Old Zhang’s leg, even Master Li Xiuqing couldn’t treat it, with just the likes of you?”

“Really don’t come up with a draft when boasting! If it was so easy, wouldn’t Old Zhang’s so many years of suffering be in vain?”

“Yeah, youngster, you’d better hurry up and leave. In a while, when Jian Ping comes, you won’t be able to leave even if you want to.”

...

Ye Yuan said it casually, everyone all felt that he was boasting.

These few years, Zhang Haotian spent all of his savings in order to seek medical treatment, which also barely managed to maintain the injury.

Even so, his injury was still continuously deteriorating.

But very soon, the expressions on everyone’s faces changed.

Zhang Haotian’s severed leg area started to have black blood ooze out continuously, emitting a pungent and repulsive smell.

Ye Yuan’s divine fire emerged, completely refining it.

Under everyone’s astonished eyes, Zhang Haotian’s severed limb actually started re-growing!

“Really cured! This kid has such formidable means!”

“Truly a magic hand that restores life! The poison that even Master Li Xiuqing couldn’t cure, he treated it!”

“I really didn’t expect that this kid is actually an alchemist. No wonder he would have a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse as a follower!”

...

All around, the people around let out a series of exclamations.

Master Li Xiuqing was already a very famous alchemist in this vicinity. His strength was very powerful.

Zhang Haotian’s poison wound that even he could not treat, it was basically already sentencing one to death.

No one could have thought that this unknown young man really cured Zhang Haotian in no time flat.

Zhang Haotian opened his mouth wide, looking at his own leg in disbelief.

Ever since coming back from Master Li Xiuqing there, he thought that he would never stand up in this lifetime.

Who knew that Ye Yuan cured his leg in no time!

Ye Yuan fished out another medicinal pill, passed it to Zhang Haotian, and said, “Eat this Detoxification Pill. The residual poison in your body will be pretty much cleared. You try standing up.”

Zhang Haotian received the medicinal pill tremblingly and attempted to stand up. Tears rolled down his old face and he said, “S-Sir, you ... you’re really this Zhang’s great benefactor! How much are these two medicinal pills, this old man ... even if this old man risks this life, I’ll also pay the money.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “These medicinal pills, just take it as covering the cost of the divination just now.”

“Who broke my younger brother’s legs, scram outside!” At this time, an icy-cold voice was heard.

Everyone’s faces changed.

“It’s Jian Ping! Came so quickly!”

“Jian Ping is also fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord, there’s a good show to watch now.”

“I heard that Jian Ping’s bloodline is very pure. His Profound Spirit Chaos Formula is also cultivated very solidly.”

...

The crowd divided, a dashing young man with a valiant bearing walked over.

This young man had some similarities with Jian Yu at the glabella. He was naturally Jian Ping.

By the side, Jian Yu was on crutches. At the sight of Ye Yuan, he roared loudly, “Big Brother, it’s that punk! An unranked trash actually dared to break my legs, you have to take revenge for me! Ouch, so painful!”

“Unranked?”

Jian Ping’s brows furrowed, looking at Ye Yuan rather curiously. Unable to even enter the ranks and could actually cultivate to the Divine Lord Realm?

Furthermore, as long as one was a martial artist, they more or less had some destiny.

Unranked, so how did this fellow survive until now?

Members of the Jian Family were the most curious about destiny.

People who were unranked were very seldom-seen!

Under the urging of his curiosity, Jian Ping could not resist mustering up divine essence, and looked over toward Ye Yuan ...
