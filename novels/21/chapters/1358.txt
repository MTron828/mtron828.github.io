Chapter 1362: Beaten in Vain

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Inside the Qin Family’s parlor, a middle-aged man and a young man were currently seated according to positions of host and guest.

The middle-aged man said solemnly, “Honorable Nephew, you’ve disappointed me greatly this time!”

The young man was startled and hurriedly said, “Yes, it was this little nephew who was reckless! This nephew was anxious to take revenge for my younger brother, but didn’t expect that the Myriad Treasure Tower’s action was actually so swift, already reaching an agreement with the City Lord Manor! With this, it’s shooting myself in the foot!”

The middle-aged man snorted coldly and said, “Such a heaven-defying medicinal pill, unless the Myriad Treasure Tower doesn’t sell to the outside, otherwise, how can they possibly swallow it all by themselves? Forget it, now that it played out like this, grow wiser with each setback. Since you returned, then cultivate well and strive to promote to the heaven camp soon!”

The young man hurriedly said, “Yes, this nephew obeys Uncle Qin’s instructions!”

This middle-aged man was the Qin Family’s current family head, Qin Nantian, while the youth was Wang Song!

To talk about this Wang Song, he had quite the means too, to actually win over the Qin Family’s concubine’s daughter, Qin Peiying, in Wu Meng Academy. Now, he was considered half a Qin Family’s son-in-law.

In addition, his strength was uncommon. He already broke through to late-stage Heaven Glimpse, and also entered the Qin Family’s sights.

Although the Wang Family was powerful, that was also just powerful in Brightraise City.

While the Qin Family was the entire Wu Meng Capital City’s hegemon-level family clan!

Not only were experts as abundant as clouds in the clan, but they also occupied many high positions in Wu Meng Capital City. Moreover, the businesses spanned throughout Wu Meng Capital City.

The Wang Family was not worth mentioning at all in front of the Qin Family.

Drawing close to the Qin Family, Wang Song’s future was limitless.

Back then, a year ago, he suffered a loss in front of Xiao Feng. Hence, he thought of exposing the matter of the Essence Cultivating Pill to the City Lord Manor.

It was just that he schemed in every possible way and also failed to calculate that the City Lord Manor had long reached an agreement with the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Not only did the news he sent not make things difficult for the Myriad Treasure Tower, but it also made the City Lord Manor dismiss both him and Chen Yongnian, transferring them back to Wu Meng Academy.

With this, he came to pay respects to Qin Nantian when he just arrived at Wu Meng Capital City.

Wang Song, as a deputy city lord, was just a delegation of the Wu Meng Academy. In the end, he was still a student of Wu Meng Academy.

What Wang Song did not know was that Ye Yuan had long made Yang Rui remind Wu Meng Capital City’s Myriad Treasure Tower that the Essence Cultivating Pill’s profits had to be divided with the City Lord Manor. Furthermore, they had to provide Essence Cultivating Pills to the City Lord Manor.

When Han Tian saw this news, he already took it seriously and reached an agreement with the City Lord Manor.

What was laughable was that Wang Song acted smart and slammed onto the spearhead himself.

“Alright, you go back. Ying-er has already been looking forward to your return for a long time!” Qin Nantian said coolly.

Wang Song got up and took his leave: “This nephew takes his leave.”

Wang Song was just about to turn around and leave when a woman whose face swelled like a pig’s head rushed in.

“Dad, I don’t want to live anymore! Sniff, sniff ... I don’t want to live anymore! Yu-er has no face to see people in the future!”

“Yu ... Yu-er?”

Wang Song froze for a second before coming to a realization.

This woman, from figure to clothing, wasn’t it Qin Peiyu?

It was just that ... why was her face beaten by people until like this?

Qin Nantian got a daughter at an old age and doted on Qin Peiyu greatly.

Seeing her like this, he immediately flew into a great rage and said, “Yu-er, who is so bold, to actually hit you until like this?”

Wang Song’s expression changed too, and he said fiercely, “Yu-er, who hit you until like this? I’ll go and exterminate him!”

Qin Peiyu’s face was already beaten out of shape, looking too wretched to look at. If not for the clothes his daughter wore and her figure, he virtually could not recognize that this was his daughter.

His daughter’s face being beaten until like this, it was equivalent to smacking the Qin Family’s face. How could he not be furious?

“It was all ... It was all that punk! Sniff, sniff, Dad, brother-in-law, you all have to take revenge for Yu-er! Sniff, sniff ...”

Qin Peiyu wept heavily. Talking for a long time, she did not say clearly who beat her either.

Qin Peiyu’s face fell, and he shouted, “Where’s Granny Hua? Have her scram over here for me!”

Granny Hua was that old woman.

Normally when they went out, it was all her following Qin Peiyu. Now that Qin Peiyu was beaten until like this, Granny Hua could hardly absolve herself from the blame.

Granny Hua entered totteringly and knelt on the ground with a thud, saying, “Family Head, spare me! It wasn’t that this elderly self didn’t do my best, but there was a late-stage Two-star evil spirit by that boy’s side, this elderly self wasn’t a match!”

Granny Hua’s words seemed to have stepped on Wang Song’s tail, making him startled inwardly.

“Two-star evil spirit? It wouldn’t be so coincidental, right? It’s just that, the one beside Ye Yuan was a middle-stage Two-star evil spirit. Could it be ... it broke through?” Wang Song secretly thought to himself.

When mentioning the Two-star evil spirit, he virtually thought of Ye Yuan right away.

For the average person, barely anyone was able to bring a Two-star evil spirit around.

“Humph! When the master is shamed, the subject dies! Yu-er was beaten up until like this, but you’re perfectly fine. You ... deserve death!” Qin Nantian said furiously.

Granny Hua’s expression became extremely ugly. How was she perfectly fine? She was already clearly seriously injured, alright?

At this time, Wang Song spoke up, “Uncle, don’t get angry first. It’s best to listen to her explain until the end.”

Granny Hua recounted today’s events quiveringly. Wang Song’s expression became uglier and uglier.

Hearing Granny Hua’s description, that person who made a move was clearly Ye Yuan!

“Uncle, I think ... I know who beat Yu-er!” Wang Song said solemnly.

Qin Nantian’s expression changed, and he said, “Could it be that punk called Ye Yuan that you talked about?”

Wang Song’s expression was solemn as he nodded his head. He knew that Ye Yuan already came to Wu Meng Capital City but did not expect that enemies meet on a narrow path. The moment Ye Yuan came, he beat his sister-in-law into a pig’s head!

But this way was good too, at the very least, Qin Nantian absolutely would not sit by idly and remain indifferent.

“Yu-er, Father will definitely catch that kid and let you give vent well. Granny Hua, take Yu-er away and have her rest well!” Qin Nantian said dotingly.

Qin Nantian coaxed with deception, coaxing Qin Peiyu away.

The moment Qin Peiyu left, Qin Nantian’s expression still turned grim.

“Since this punk came to Wu Meng Capital City, he has probably already joined the Myriad Treasure Tower officially. With the Myriad Treasure Tower protecting, it’s very troublesome!” Qin Nantian said with a headache.

He was not some rash young lad. Angry was angry, but he also knew that the Myriad Treasure Tower could not be provoked.

Although he was the Qin Family’s family head, he was still not qualified enough to take on Han Tian.

Those able to have a dialogue with Han Tian were only their old man, that generation.

Qin Nantian made a correct assessment of the situation and knew that although Ye Yuan’s realm was low, by relying on the Essence Cultivating Pill, his status in the Myriad Treasure Tower definitely was not low.

Could it be ... beaten in vain?

Qin Nantian naturally could not stomach this!

Clearwind Inn that place had dragons and fishes jumbled up together. Ye Yuan beat Qin Peiyu to a pig’s head in front of so many people. Tomorrow, probably the entire Wu Meng Capital City would know.

Not venting this anger, how could his Qin Family keep a foothold in Wu Meng Capital City in the future?

Wang Song was seething with righteous indignation as he said, “Uncle, let’s keep a close eye on the Myriad Treasure Tower. I don’t believe that he can keep hiding in the Myriad Treasure Tower! As long as he comes out, we’ll have a myriad of ways to mess him to death!”

He discovered to his dismay that Ye Yuan was just like a porcupine, unable for him to bite down at all. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Qin Nantian’s expression was very ugly as he nodded and said, “Right now, it can only be like this too!”
