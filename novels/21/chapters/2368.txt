“D-Dead? He ... He killed a divine envoy!”

“You dare to kill a divine envoy! How dare you kill a divine envoy!”

“It’s over! You’ve doomed us all! Our Ziwei Sect is finished this time!”

... ...

With Ye Yuan killing the middle-aged divine envoy, everyone’s first reaction was not how strong he was, being about to jump realms and kill a member of the divine race, but it was that Ye Yuan had implicated them.

Hearing this, he could not help shaking his head and sighing.

The might of the divine race had long already penetrated deep into the bones. These people did not dare to resist at all.

Ye Yuan was also burning with anxiety from watching at one side, that was why he would make a move.

He thought that the Ziwei Sect would resist. But in the end, Mo Qingshan did not dare to make a move either.

However, he could understand. Under tremendous pressure, the human race could only swallow their pride and endure in silence.

The price of resisting was death.

How could a puny little Ziwei Sect stop the divine race’s army?

Even ants drag out an ignoble existence, let alone humans?

“Oh, then why don’t you guys kidnap me and send me to the divine race there?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Mo Qingshan’s expression changed, and he said with an ugly expression, “This ... How can this do? Little Brother, don’t joke around! It’s just that ... killing a divine envoy, this is a major crime!”

He knew that Ye Yuan was mocking him.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “I’m being serious, you guys are really not sending?”

Mo Qingshan was stunned, but still shook his head and said, “Little Brother did it in order to save us. Even if I, Mo Qingshan, am less than an animal, I also can’t do this sort of thing! Little Brother, you quickly leave! After the Sentry Celestial Palace’s divine official comes, you won’t be able to leave! Divine officials are late-stage Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses, you’re not a match!”

In the Ziwei Sect, the strongest one was also Mo Qingshan this sect master.

His cultivation realm was also merely Sixth Firmament Heavenly Emperor. There was still a fine line away from a late-stage Heavenly Emperor Realm.

An Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse coming over could virtually sweep everything away!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “Do you think that I’m joking with you? If you don’t kidnap me over, I’ll destroy your Ziwei Sect today!”

Mo Qingshan’s expression suddenly changed, immediately feeling tremendous pressure!

With Ye Yuan’s present strength, destroying an unremarkable Ziwei Sect was really too easy.

Just as everyone was at a loss on what to do, a young man stepped forward crisply.

The young man said, “S-Senior, are you thinking of ... going to destroy the Sentry Celestial Palace?”

Ye Yuan looked at this young man rather surprisedly. He remembered that this young man was precisely one of Ziwei Sect’s geniuses who was about to be executed.

Just now, he even had his hands tied behind his back. But now, he was released.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “A little interesting, what’s your name?”

He did not expect that among this bunch of obsequious people, there was actually still one who could see through his thoughts.

His thought was not hard to guess. It was just that for these people, wanting to guess correctly was hard.

Because they never thought of revolting before at all.

The young man said respectfully, “Junior is Qin Chao!”

Ye Yuan said, “Mn, you guessed correctly, I’m precisely going to destroy the Sentry Celestial Palace!”

Qin Chao had a solemn look as he said, “I know the path to the Sentry Celestial Palace. Junior will lead the way for you!”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised and said with a smile that was not a smile, “You aren’t afraid of death?”

Qin Chao nodded and said, “Of course I’m scared! But Junior has already had enough of this kind of days! With our human race not resisting, we’ll always be treated as pigs and sheep. If they aren’t happy, they will slaughter and eat! Moreover, Senior saved this junior’s beloved earlier. Junior is willing to repay with death!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze could not help looking in Mo Xiaocao’s direction and discovered that she also had a look of surprise.

Clearly, this was just Qin Chao’s unrequited love.

In the Ziwei Sect, those who liked Mo Xiaocao, there were also 800 if there weren’t 1000.

Qin Chao was merely one of them.

However, these two people’s conversation made everyone stare dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

What the Sentry Celestial Palace represented was the divine race!

Touching the Sentry Celestial Palace was tantamount to pulling teeth from the tiger maws of the divine race!

At that time, the divine race’s upper echelons would surely be shaken.

Disregarding this, Ye Yuan was merely Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor. Even if he killed a divine envoy, what right did he have to go and destroy the Sentry Celestial Palace?

Of course, the human race being oppressed for a long time, there would also be people who overestimated their own ability, going to provoke the divine race.

The final outcome naturally went without saying.

This young man was definitely another one of them.

He was seeking death here and Qin Chao actually wanted to go together with him!

“Qin Chao, what are you messing around for?” Mo Qingshan said angrily.

Him not daring to flare up with Ye Yuan did not mean that he did not dare to get angry with Qin Chao.

Qin Chao smiled miserably and he said, “Master, you turn back and look. That’s your daughter! The divine race wanted to violate your daughter and you actually allowed them to take her away freely! Also, you all! How many among you all like Junior Apprentice Sister Xiaocao? But did any one of you step forward?”

“Senior saved us and saved your beloved Junior Apprentice Sister Xiaocao. But none of you thanked him, and even wanted to blame him for being a busybody, implicating our Ziwei Sect! We’re humans! Proud and dignified humans, not pigs and dogs! Not fish and meat! The divine race treats us as pigs and dogs, could it be that we also have to treat ourselves as pigs and dogs? I’m already someone who has died once, what’s the harm in going to die again with Senior?”

Qin Chao’s words echoed loudly.

Many Ziwei Sect disciples lowered their heads in shame.

When Ye Yuan heard this, he could not help revealing a look of approval.

In this era, it was precisely because there were many iron-blooded men like Qin Chao, that there was the human race’s future!

Ziwei Sect was merely an epitome of the era.

There were many many Ziwei Sects in the world.

Even if each sect only produced one Qin Chao, it was an extremely powerful force as well.

“Senior, I’ll bring you!” Qin Chao turned and said to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan nodded his head smilingly and said, “Let’s go.”

Ziwei Sect’s ten thousand people send these two people away with their eyes.

In the crowd, Mo Xiaocao’s eyes sparkled, as if knowing this Qin Chao this senior apprentice brother for the first time.

... ...

Along the way, Ye Yuan was absorbed in thought. But Qin Chao’s emotions started to change.

In the beginning, he had the solemness and melancholy of the wind howling and the waters turning cold, the brave warriors never returning.

But as they got closer and closer to the Sentry Celestial Palace, his breathing also gradually became ragged.

Clearly, he was starting to get nervous and scared.

The might of the divine race was deeply imprinted in the hearts of every human, unable to disperse.

Qin Chao’s hot blood was surging at the beginning, that was why he would disregard everything.

But when he really arrived at Sentry Celestial Palace, he started to get fidgety again.

Ye Yuan did not notice his changes but fell into contemplation.

“I already fell into the chaotic spacetime. Then is this world real or fake?”

“If it’s fake, how should I return to my own world?”

“If it’s real, then will my actions here change the course of history, and let the human race go in another direction?”

“If I really change history, then will ... I still exist or not?”

... ...

Countless doubts lingered in his heart.

He passed through spacetime and arrived. He was just a tiny butterfly.

Then would he, this small butterfly, make the experiences of future generations, all change?

This was really a profound question.
