Chapter 1518 Something“s Wrong!

No one was clearer than Ba Tu about the fifth guardian’s strength.

If Ye Yuan could even pass through the fifth round, then he would really have to suspect that there was something shady.

At this time, Di Fan was currently resting, preparing to continue challenging.

After each round passed, that space would automatically help the martial artist recover their strength. It only took around a quarter of an hour and the challenger would be at a peak state.

While the other two of the Eminent Orchid Six Sons were currently in fierce battles with the sixth guardians.

It seemed like it was somewhat taxing.

At this time, the two defeated Eminent Orchid Six Sons were also transported back. Seeing that Ba Tu was already defeated, they could not help being somewhat surprised.

“Ba Tu, you were actually defeated so quickly?” one of them asked.

Ba Tu’s strength ranked in the middle among the few of them. Logically speaking, he would not lose so quickly.

Ba Tu nodded and said, “I was too eager to win. A careless move and I was defeated. However, even if I try harder, it’s useless too. I can’t pass the sixth round no matter what.”

Those two people nodded their heads, indicating agreement.

Suddenly, they glimpsed with their peripherals, their faces revealed a shocked look.

“This kid actually made it to the fifth round? Is there a mistake?”

Ba Tu said, “I also can’t make head nor tail of it. Just now, when everyone was watching Di Fan clearing the sixth round, this kid made it to the fifth round bafflingly.”

The two people were speechless.

Didn’t this mean that Ye Yuan’s strength was around the same as them?

While at this time, Ye Yuan already faced-off with the fifth round’s guardian.

Everyone all stared at the No.3 arena without shifting their eyes, wanting to see what capability Ye Yuan had, to actually be able to make it to the fifth round.

Ye Yuan still had that unhurried appearance, tangling in battle with his opponent.

Under the opponent’s fierce attacks, Ye Yuan seemed to be somewhat straining.

But Ye Yuan was very stubborn. Each time, he could turn peril into safety.

“Something’s wrong! I remember that when this kid was in the first round, he was this half-dead manner. Why is he still like this when he made it to the fifth round?” Bu Zhe suddenly said.

He discovered to his shock, Ye Yuan’s current battle did not seem to be any different from when in the first round.

It was as if his opponents did not become strong at all.

This discovery immediately got many people’s acknowledgment.

“Yeah, he was also being overwhelmed at the first round. After five to six hundred moves, he won without rhyme or reason.”

“The second round seemed to be like this too! Could it be ... that there’s really something shady?”

“Rubbish. This ancient ruins, it’s everyone’s first time entering. What shady deal can there be?”

...

Just as everyone was talking all at once, Ye Yuan’s sword passed through his opponent’s chest bizarrely.

Ye Yuan won!

The hall was dead silent. Everyone all looked at this scene in disbelief.

How could it be like this?

Could it be that Ye Yuan’s strength already surpassed the Eminent Orchid Six Sons?

This ... This was also too fake, right?

“F*cking hell, there must be something wrong here! This kid’s opponent definitely isn’t as strong as ours!” Ba Tu said with an indignant look.

The other two people also had glassy looks and said in disbelief, “There must be something wrong here! They also said earlier, this kid has always been half-dead like this. Yet, he could clear the round each time! If there’s nothing wrong, I’ll wring my head off for him to kick like a ball.”

Whoosh!

A streak of cold light flashed by. One of the Eminent Orchid Six Sons, his head directly flew out, his fiend soul also ground into pieces.

“The Purple Extreme Sect treats all challengers equally without discrimination. Those who question, dies!”

The old voice sounded out once more. It was just that this time, it was unusually cold.

Everyone was silent like cicadas in winter. No one dared to question whether there was something shady anymore.

But, for Ye Yuan to clear five rounds, this result, they still felt that it was unbelievable.

They could not see it. Clearing five rounds in a row, Ye Yuan’s sword art became even more erratic.

Only his opponents could distinctly sense his power.

Ye Yuan discovered that these ancient era young geniuses were really incomparably powerful.

Their application of laws surpassed Ye Yuan’s imaginations.

From them, Ye Yuan learned many things.

Learning now and selling now, Ye Yuan discovered that his drawing parallels from inference, his comprehension toward spatial laws became increasingly deeper.

Spatial laws were one of the highest-ranking laws, and also one of the hardest laws to comprehend that the Heavenspan World universally acknowledged.

The Heavenspan World’s spatial laws were on a completely different level from a small world’s.

Even grand completion Origin Deity Realm powerhouses were unable to fly, this in itself indicated many problems.

Only by reaching half-step Divine Lord Realm could one touch the threshold of spatial laws, achieving the goal of temporary flight from there.

Ye Yuan’s Chasing Moon, Daybreak, these two moves, after incorporating spatial laws, it made his sword moves become erratic, the power unimaginable.

This was not purely comprehending spatial laws, but the spatial laws which Ye Yuan comprehended through Sword Dao could integrate with Ye Yuan’s sword moves perfectly.

One would never know where Ye Yuan’s sword would appear or when it would appear.

“Congratulations to the no. 3 arena lord for defeating the sixth opponent. Obtained a low-grade divine lord mystic treasure.”

This voice sounded out, making everyone trembled all over.

Cleared the sixth round ... just like this? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“A-Are you kidding me? Could it be that this guy has no limits?”

“Really seeing ghosts! Just what trick is this kid playing? Why does it feel like he’s going to lose every time, but win in the end?”

Ba Tu had a sullen look and said, “If his opponent has no problems, then there’s only one explanation.”

The moment these words came out, everyone all perked their ears and listened attentively.

Ba Tu paused for a bit and said, “He’s totally hiding his strength!”

“Hiding his strength? He’s clearly a grand completion Fiend General!”

“Heh, can realm illustrate anything? When I was at half-step Fiend Commander, I could completely hang you up and pummel you!” Ba Tu said with a cold sneer.

That person did not say anything. He was unable to refute these words.

“Mn, this way, it also makes sense. The strength that he displayed in the ring previously was already very strong; practically crushing others with one move, unable to see his depths at all.” another Eminent Orchid Six Sons said.

Ba Tu nodded and said, “He wouldn’t be deliberately acting for us to see. I reckon that ... he deliberately slowed down the pace. He’s probably comprehending those ancient geniuses’ martial techniques!”

“This ... This is also too freakish, right? Such a strong opponent, he actually still has the mood to learn his opponents’ martial techniques?”

Everyone drew a cold breath, frightened looks showing on their faces.

How incredible the nerves for one to dare do such a thing?

“Very likely! If I didn’t come out and see these projections, I wouldn’t even know that the situation inside could actually be seen! There’s no way he’s deliberately concealing his strength!” said another one of the six sons, agreeing with this.

Right at this time, Di Fan defeated the seventh round’s guardian, successfully clearing the round.

“Hahaha ... this challenge is really interesting! So many powerful opponents, it’s still my first time encountering such situation! Feels so good! Defeating seven people, my strength improved a step further! The next opponent will likely make my hot blood boil with excitement even more! Those guys have probably all lost already, right?” Di Fan said with a loud laugh.
