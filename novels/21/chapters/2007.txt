Chapter 2011: Make a Trip With Me

Above the void, two figures clashed.

Lu Yan retreated in defeat time and again under Bai Tong’s folded fan, virtually without strength to retaliate.

If he really fought recklessly, he could hurt Bai Tong too.

But the problem was, Bai Tong was wearing the Qinghong Battle Armor on his body. The same damage, he suffered 100%. Bai Tong would only suffer 50% or even 30%.

Continuing to fight like this, the one to cave first could only be him.

Looking at the other two areas again, Deng Yunzai and Dai Chunhao were similarly being suppressed by their opponents.

Lu Yan’s heart sank to rock-bottom with a rush.

The three of them came in a threatening and overbearing manner, fully thinking that they had cornered Ye Yuan. Who knew that they were actually being forced into a desperate strait by Ye Yuan now?

Producing clouds with one turn of the hand and rain with another was talking about Ye Yuan this kind, right?

Even though Ye Yuan was just a puny little True God Realm, the appearance of these three great Empyreans in front of them all had direct connections with Ye Yuan.

Furthermore ... when did Empyrean powerhouses and empyrean spirit treasures become so worthless?

One tremendous force after another came over, Lu Yan’s innards were in upheaval, virtually wanting to vomit blood.

“Puhwark!”

Finally, Lu Yan could not refrain from spewing out a mouthful of blood.

With consecutive clashes, he already sustained considerable internal injuries.

“No way! At this rate, I’ll definitely succumb here! This guy’s strength is above mine to begin with, and he also has the help of empyrean spirit treasures. I don’t have a chance at all!”

Lu Yan finally got a clear understanding of the situation.

From exchanging blows until now, the combat power that Lu Yan exhibited far surpassed Lu Yan’s imaginations.

How was this a newbie who just entered Empyrean?

This was clearly an old eccentric who had entered Empyrean for many years!

Lu Yan already faintly guessed in his heart that Bai Tong was likely Empyrean Realm in the first place. It was just that because of some reasons he would fall to True God Realm.

But this way, he clearly had even less of a chance.

Lu Yan gritted his teeth and said, “Where’s there’s life there’s hope! Retreat!”

Done talking, Lu Yan’s divine essence surged, using even the strength to suckle for milk, finally forcing Bai Tong back a little.

And he seized this opportunity to turn around and escape.

Bai Tong just smiled coldly and said, “Want to go? How can it be that easy?”

It was only to see his figure flash and actually directly block Lu Yan’s path.

Lu Yan’s pupils constricted and he cried out in shock, “S-Spatial law!”

Bai Tong was not an ordinary Empyrean powerhouse, he also knew spatial law!

An emotion called despair spread in Lu Yan’s heart.

He gritted his teeth and said to Bai Tong in a cold voice, “Must you force me to mutual destruction?”

Bai Tong looked at him very calmly and said, “Mutual destruction? Just based on you?”

He was originally a peak Empyrean super powerhouse. How much greater was his strength compared to Lu Yan?

Although his realm was more or less the same as Lu Yan’s at present, he still had Ye Yuan’s Qinghong Battle Armor and his Carefree Jade Fan, these two empyrean spirit treasures.

No matter what trump card Lu Yan had, he did not fear in the slightest too.

Bai Tong waved his hand and attacked again without another word.

Lu Yan felt his scalp tingle. Helpless, he could only meet the battle passively.

However, although Ye Yuan’s side was domineering, wanting to take the other party down within a short time also could not be done.

Both parties’ battle actually lasted for three days and nights. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The current Lu Yan had a head of disheveled hair, his breathing being in disorder. How was there any demeanor of the lord of a city still? Rather, he was exactly like the beggars on the roadside.

The other two people were also not much better than him, already forced into a desperate strait.

“Ye Yuan, I’m an Empyrean under Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether’s command. You dare to kill me? You can create several Empyreans, but can you create a Heavenly Emperor? If you kill me, Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether definitely won’t let you off!” Lu Yan used the last of his strength to roar.

The moment these words came out, the entire city was shocked.

If they were still able to imagine Empyreans, Heavenly Emperor already exceeded their imaginations.

Offending a Heavenly Emperor, the consequences were extremely terrifying.

At the top of city walls, Ye Yuan stood in the air, and said coolly: “Even if I let you off, could it be that you won’t go find Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether to get reinforcements? At that time, what will I use to restrain you? Since that’s the case, better to kill you. Brother Bai, don’t need to hold back, feel free to kill.”

Bai Tong nodded slightly, the force in his hands becoming heavier.

Both parties’ conflict clearly could not be mediated already. Wouldn’t threatening again now be a joke?

The matters in the future, talk again in the future.

Furthermore, Bai Tong had a score in his heart.

Even if he really killed Lu Yan, Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether might not really get angry.

After all, a future Seven-star Alchemy God compared to a mere Second Firmament Empyrean, which held greater weight, it was impossible for Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether to not be able to differentiate.

Toward an existence like Ye Yuan, the significance of roping in was clearly greater than killing and being merry after.

Bang!

Bai Tong pointed a fan out, Lu Yan’s world domain was akin to having suffered a heavy blow, figure directly flying out backward, fresh blood spurting wildly.

The current Lu Yan was already an arrow at the end of its flight.

During this time, Lu Yan naturally unleashed all of his killing moves. But Bai Tong had two empyrean spirit treasures and did not fear the other party’s killing moves at all.

Bai Tong’s two eyes narrowed slightly and said coolly, “About time to send you on your way!”

Lu Yan’s pupils constricted, eyes revealing a look of unwillingness and despair.

He never dreamed that he would actually die here.

This place was just a tiny little imperial city!

Bai Tong pointed a fan out again. A powerful white light headed straight for Lu Yan.

But right at this time, a layer of ripple surfaced in space.

A figure stepped out of the void and just lightly waved a hand. The white light was instantly extinguished.

Bai Tong’s pupils constricted, looking at the arrival with apprehension.

This was a gray-robed old man. The aura on his body, even the current Bai Tong also felt terrified.

In the city, including Ye Yuan, their faces all changed.

This gray-robed old man was very strong!

When Lu Yan saw the old man, his face revealed a look of wild elation and he cried out in surprise, “Brother Cang Yuan! Hahaha, you came right in the nick of time! Ye Yuan this traitor actually dared to murder an Empyrean, his crime is unpardonable.”

Empyrean Cang Yuan did not look at Lu Yan, but looked towards Bai Tong and said, “You esteemed self wants to kill my Extreme Nether Bodhidharma. That is treating Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether too lightly, right?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and his figure moved, stepping forward to welcome, saying coolly, “It was him who was overbearing. We merely retaliated. Why is it only he’s allowed to kill and others aren’t allowed to kill him?”

Empyrean Cang Yuan looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly and said, “You’re that Ye Yuan who poisoned several thousand True God Realms to death?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So what if yes?”

Empyrean Cang Yuan nodded his head and said, “Then that’s right, make a trip with me.”

Hearing this, everyone’s faces changed.

This Empyrean powerhouse who suddenly appeared was actually here for Ye Yuan.

They did not expect that the matter of Ye Yuan poisoning several thousand True God Realms to death actually spread to Extreme Nether Bodhidharma.

This was troublesome!

This Empyrean Cang Yuan’s strength was clearly stronger than Bai Tong.

The realm of Empyrean Realm, even if it was just the difference of one minor realm, it was also a gap that could not be made up for.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly and he said, “If I don’t go with you?”

Empyrean Cang Yuan smiled slightly, the Empyrean pressure on his body suddenly released.

A power that was several times stronger than Lu Yan spread between heaven and earth.

“That’s not up to you!” Empyrean Cang Yuan looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly.
