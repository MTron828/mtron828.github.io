Chapter 2440: Laid Completely Bare!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hahaha ... Lin Chaotian, justice lies in the hearts of people. Do you hear it? Open your eyes wide and see. Who will believe that someone who sent the divine race back to the abyss will betray the human race! Will someone who betrays the human race have such a powerful aura of righteousness?” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said with a loud laugh.

He also did not think that with Ye Yuan coming to confront face to face would actually have such a thing happen.

Ever since he went to find Ye Yuan, Ye Yuan had been together with him all along.

In fact, Ye Yuan even instructed Pang Zhen and the rest, forbidding them from coming to get involved in this matter.

He knew that Ye Yuan was afraid of implicating them.

These people all came spontaneously!

The feelings of the people were clear at a glance!

Lin Chaotian’s gaze turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “Indeed deserving of being Saint Azure. What a terrific trick that beguiles the hearts of people! Finding so many people to come to Origin Enlighten Mountain Range, is it to force an abdication?”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Force an abdication? Huhu, you’re also thinking too highly of yourself. Already a Dao Ancestor, can’t you be a little more broad-minded?”

Lin Chaotian’s face turned black, these words were simply lecturing him as a junior!

Yet, he could not find words to refute.

Lin Chaotian gave a cold snort and said, “Ye Yuan, stop putting on your airs of Saint Azure! Fine. Put aside the matter of Daymeld first. Are you going to explain the matter of your beloved woman becoming the divine race’s divine daughter? You said that you won’t betray the human race. Then when you meet her on the battlefield one day, what will you do? This time, you let her leave!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This matter was the most crucial!

Lin Chaotian daring to convict Ye Yuan, this was also the most important point.

The feelings between Ye Yuan and Yue Mengli, as well as Ye Yuan’s character, he had looked into it deeply before.

Ye Yuan valued relationships immensely and could completely put his life on the line for the people around him.

Now that Yue Mengli became a Divine Daughter, Ye Yuan absolutely would not sit by idly and remain indifferent, let alone meet on the battleground!

And this was precisely where Ye Yuan’s weakness lay!

Sure enough, mentioning this point, the muscles on Ye Yuan’s face involuntarily twitched.

This matter already became a sore spot of his.

Lin Chaotian mentioning it in public was tantamount to scattering salt on his wound.

Ye Yuan’s eyes were icy-cold and he said in a deep voice, “Lin Chaotian, who the hell do you think you are, to make me explain to you? What I, Ye Yuan, want to do, isn’t your turn to point fingers and order me about!”

When Lin Chaotian saw that Ye Yuan got angry, he smiled instead and said, “Oh? Angry? Looks like Saint Azure values this woman very highly! Since that’s the case, then who can guarantee that you won’t betray the human race because of this woman in the future? This matter, Saint Azure got to give us an explanation! Or you can kill this woman with your own hands and prove your loyalty to your clansmen! Don’t you all agree?”

As he said, his gaze swept towards everyone.

Everyone drew a breath of cold air!

This move was a little too vicious.

Forcing Ye Yuan to personally kill his most beloved woman, this was too cruel!

It was just that at this time, no one could point out any problems.

After all, the human race and divine race were mortal enemies.

Either you die or I perish.

There was no room for salvation between the two parties at all.

Ye Yuan getting angry was precisely what Lin Chaotian hoped to see.

When he discovered that his opponent was Saint Azure, even the Lin Chaotian who was revered as a Dao Ancestor, had no choice but to be careful too.

Who was Saint Azure?

That was a peerless major power who single handedly groomed him from a mediocre person with no accomplishments to his name into the Heavenspan World’s number one person!

Others did not know Saint Azure’s might, but he came over from that era, how could he not know?

Although Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was not high yet, his potential was too terrifying!

Without Saint Azure, there would not be the present human race’s prosperity, let alone him, this Dao Ancestor Life.

Hence, he deliberately used Yue Mengli’s matter to provoke Ye Yuan.

Very clearly, he achieved his goal!

“Lord Saint Azure, you give an explanation!”

“Yeah, we completely don’t believe that you’ll betray the human race! But, you’ve got to explain things!”

... ...

The group of powerhouses were all very anxious, they discovered that Ye Yuan was too proud!

Proud until he was completely disdainful to defend himself.

Even if it already concerned his name of Saint Azure now!

But Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Lin Chaotian, you’re also thinking too highly of yourself! Do you think that I came today to explain to you? Or is it that you feel that I’ll care about the name of Saint Azure? Heh heh, in the end, you’re also just a frog at the bottom of the well!”

Ye Yuan’s words expressed volumes.

Lin Chaotian’s heart seemed to be pricked by something.

While everyone in the hall was extremely shocked.

Ye Yuan actually used ‘frog at the bottom of the well,’ this kind of term, to describe the Heavenspan World’s number one person, Dao Ancestor Life!

These words sounded somewhat ridiculous.

But right now, nobody could laugh.

Ye Yuan said, “My right and wrongs, future generations will naturally comment on it. How can it be summed up in a few words by you? It’s just that, whether is it being crowned with eternal glory or leaving behind a bad name forever, what has it got to do with me? I, Ye Yuan, follow my heart when I do things. Who the hell are you, to make me specifically come and provide an explanation to you?”

“The reason why I came is just that I wanted to see what’s there on my body that’s worth you coveting! Previously outside the mountain pass gates, I could already confirm it! Heh, speaking of which, apart from breaking the shackles, what else in this world can still move you, this number one Dao Ancestor? You concealed your selfish motives under the righteousness of the human race, being truly shameless to the extreme!”

“If you disregard your identity and personally made a move against me, I can still regard you a little higher. It’s just a pity that although you’re honored as a Dao Ancestor, you’re an out-and-out despicable villain! Do you think that by becoming a Dao Ancestor, you can transcend your race and laugh proudly at the world? You don’t know that you’re merely just an ant-like existence in the eyes of Heavenly Dao too!”

Finished saying these words, the entire audience was deathly silent.

Everyone opened their mouths wide, looking at Ye Yuan in great shock.

‘Breaking the shackles’, these three words, seemed to have magic powers, capturing everyone’s heart.

“What ... What did he say just now? Breaking the shackles! Could it be that Lord Saint Azure is actually able to break the shackles of Dao Ancestor?”

“A secret that can make Dao Ancestors improve further? No wonder Dao Ancestor Life will covet it!”

“But how is this possible? Since time immemorial, Dao Ancestors are the strongest! Even in the era that the divine race ruled, they were unable to break through the existence of Dao Ancestors too. How can someone possibly break the shackles of Dao Ancestor?”

... ...

One stone stirred up a thousand ripples, Ye Yuan’s words made everyone’s emotions blow up.

The words he said were indeed too earth-shattering.

This kind of thing was too fantastical, already exceeding their imagination.

Originally, they were still curious why Dao Ancestor Life wanted to target Lord Saint Azure.

After all, Lord Saint Azure was the entire human race’s hero!

But if it was according to what Ye Yuan said, then everything could be explained!

The expression on Lin Chaotian’s face did not change much, but he already hated Ye Yuan to the extreme in his heart.

He still underestimated Ye Yuan and did not think that Ye Yuan was actually so clever!

He actually saw through his intentions from the little clues and inklings.

He thought that he understood Ye Yuan very well, thinking that Ye Yuan would definitely care about the title of Saint Azure.

It was just a pity, he still projected his own shortcomings onto others!

Ye Yuan’s head had always been clear until it could make people’s hair stand on end!
