Chapter 1500 True Fiend Mantle VS Daybreak!

“Is my eyesight failing? His Highness Ka Xin was actually defeated?”

“This Source Night ... is so strong! Really too strong!”

“He’s just a high-rank Fiend General, to actually be able to defeat the half-step Fiend Commander His Highness Ka Xin!”

“His Highness Ka Xin has basically been all jumping realms to battle after ten years at the Blood Battle Stage! Today, he was actually defeated by someone jumping realms. This ... This is too inconceivable!”

...

The momentous and tidal-like yelling disappeared. What replaced it was a series of exclamations.

Those fanatical supporters of Ka Xin suddenly became confused.

What they saw was an idol suddenly collapsing.

They finally knew that Ye Yuan was not a fool seeking his death. He was really impressive!

“Hahaha, Ka Lan, didn’t you say that Ka Xin will pummel him into minced meat? Didn’t you want to brag? Why don’t you boast now!”

When Fan Lin saw this scene, he could not resist speaking sarcastically.

Ka Lan’s expression was ugly to the extreme. He gave a cold snort and said, “It’s not over yet! How many times do you think that kid can use this move?”

Fan Lin said smugly, “Heh, just need to be able to use once more will suffice! You look at Ka Xin’s state. Can he still resist a second time?”

At this time, the fiendish energy on Ka Xin’s body had dissipated significantly.

This Phantom Kill move of Ye Yuan’s was too ruthless. The Brahma True Fiend Dharma Idol blocked the majority of the power, but it still made him sustain heavy injuries.

Compared to Ye Yuan’s injuries earlier, his was much more severe.

Ka Xin crawled up from the ground rather difficultly, his gaze looking over toward Ye Yuan coldly.

Until now, he still did not dare to believe it. A year’s time, how could Ye Yuan improve so quickly?

He was previously still mocking Ye Yuan forcefully breaking through realm. Looking at it now, it was completely not the case!

Not only did Ye Yuan break through to become a high-rank Fiend General for real, furthermore, his realm was also already consolidated very solidly, without the slightest trace of instability.

“Good, very good! Source Night, to be able to force this prince to this extent, you can be sufficiently proud of yourself! If my conjectures are right, that move just now, you can only attack once more, right?” Ka Xin said with a dark expression.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “So what if yes, so what if not?”

Ka Xin snorted coldly and said, “Whether yes or not, you can’t escape death! True Fiend Mantle, Magnificent Devilish Heaven!”

Rumble ...

An enormous true fiend phantom condensed and formed above Ka Xin’s head. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Countless heaven and earth spiritual energy gathered over here.

The terrifying true fiend pressure made everyone somewhat breathless.

“It’s True Fiend Devil Soul Mantle! My God! His Higness Ka Xin is actually already able to summon the true fiend devil soul!”

“Devil soul mantle! Not only can it let fiend essence instantly recover, furthermore, one can cast numerous ancient forbidden moves, its power being incomparably terrifying!”

“Really didn’t expect that His Highness Ka Xin still had such a trump card! With this, Source Night is in danger!”

“This Source Night’s talent is indeed terrifying, even surpassing His Highness Ka Xin! It’s too bad, his realm is too low. Ultimately, it’s difficult to escape death!”

...

The moment Ka Xin’s move was unleashed, everyone got a huge shock.

Summoning true fiend devil soul, this was a unique secret art of the fiend race; exceedingly difficult to master.

Those able to summon true fiend mantle were all peak geniuses of the fiend race.

Seeing this scene, Bloodeagle whose expression had just taken a turn for the better immediately changed drastically and said, “It’s over, it’s over! Still thought that it’s a big win this time. Didn’t expect that Ka Xin this boy can actually summon the true fiend devil soul already!”

You Ming frowned and said, “Looks like the victory has been decided!”

On the third level stands, the man who had both brows tightly knitted the whole time finally eased up, and said with a faint smile, “Looks like he isn’t Ka Xin’s match in the end! Such talent, what a shame!”

Yi Han’s face also revealed a look of surprise, but she smiled and said, “Congratulations, City Lord Ka Long, for having a worthy successor! This Source Night is a promising talent. Looks like ... It was too hasty.”

This man was actually Capone Capital City’s city lord, Ka Long!

Look at Yi Han’s tone when speaking with him, they were actually on equal footings.

Ka Long smiled when he heard that and said, “Looks like you have no other choice as well!”

Yi Han smiled but did not say anything.

At this time, the true fiend devil soul on top of Ka Xin’s head slowly landed and actually fused into his body.

For some time, fiendish energy surged monstrously!

Ka Xin slowly opened both eyes, his eyes pitch-black.

“Hahaha, what powerful strength! Really makes my hot blood boil! Source Night, I admit that you’re very strong! But you still have to die! Heavenly Fiend Hidden Art, Boundless Devil Shadow! Iron Wire True Fiend Punch!”

Ka Xin gave a fierce cry, his figure suddenly vanishing on the spot!

He was actually the same as Ye Yuan, vanishing from everyone’s line of sight!

“Phantom Kill!”

At the same time, Ye Yuan gave a light cry, his figure likewise disappearing!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

On the ring, terrifying bombardment sounds came over.

Two terrifying power of laws clashed in the ring.

However, no one could see their figures at all.

The two people seemed to have disappeared into thin air. Only that intense tremor sound made it clear to all about these two people’s existence.

Although they could not see, everyone felt like they were about to suffocate.

These two people’s strengths were too formidable, virtually already reached the limits that Fiend General Realm could achieve!

“This ... Just who is dominating? Can’t see at all!”

“Is there still a need to say? It must be His Highness Ka Xin! He’s cloaking on the true fiend, fiend essence being supplied endlessly. Furthermore, there’s the true fiend secret art, his speed can already catch up to Source Night’s! This battle is already without suspense!”

“Lucky, lucky! I wagered all of my assets on His Highness Ka Xin to win. Didn’t expect that this Source Night was actually a major dark horse, almost causing me to lose all of my net worth!”

“Heh, who isn’t! That move of Source Night’s is really strong. It’s just too bad that he can only sustain for a short while.”

...

Everyone only saw bombarding sounds coming from the corners of the ring continuously, determining their positions with this.

It was just that how the battle situation was, nobody knew as well.

In a twinkle, several dozen breaths passed.

On the battlefield, a quiet voice faintly transmitted over.

“Daybreak!”

There was a violent explosion sound, blowing up the entire ring’s floor. Dust and smoke were flying everywhere.

Finally, that violent fighting sound ceased.

The dust and smoke dispersed. Two extremely wretched figures appeared in front of everyone.

Ye Yuan panted heavily for air, his complexion incomparably pale. There was no idea how many injuries sustained on his body, blood flowing non-stop.

However, Ka Xin’s situation was even worse than his!

Ka Xin’s true fiend devil soul was already utterly dispersed by Ye Yuan, his fleshy body virtually having more than half shaved off by Ye Yuan, looking incomparably devastating.

Ka Xin’s gaze stared fixedly at Ye Yuan, gnashing his teeth in hatred as he said, “You ... actually still had a trump card to play!”

Ye Yuan’s trump card was the Chaos Heaven Opening Sword Art’s third form: Daybreak!

This move broke myriad moves under the heavens!

Under the state of Phantom Kill, Ye Yuan unleashing this move directly shattered his true fiend devil soul.

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “I said this before, your winning streaks are nothing. That’s because ... you never encountered me!”

“Haha ...”

Ka Xin suddenly laughed wildly non-stop, looked at Ye Yuan, and said with pity, “Do you think that it’s over just like this? Since I can’t kill you at Fiend General Realm, then ... I’ll use Fiend Commander Realm to kill you!”
