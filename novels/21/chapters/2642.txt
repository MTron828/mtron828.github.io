Chapter 2648: Acting Like a Snob

“Six Ren Carefree Pill, regardless in terms of quality, refinement difficulty, or practicality, it wins against the Emerald Dawn Meteorite Pill! The three of us unanimously rule that in this round, Ge Ling wins!”

Cui Tong’s voice had neither joy nor sorrow, but it struck everyone’s hearts.

No matter whether it was Sun Yunjing, Jiang Li, or Su Yi father and daughter, they were all stupefied at this time.

He actually really won!

“This is impossible!” Jiang Li’s first reaction was that it was impossible.

Su Yi also came back to his senses at this time and immediately burst out laughing and said,?“Hahaha?… just now, who said to shave our Calm South City bald? Do your faces hurt? Sun Yunjing, didn’t you say that my Calm South City doesn’t have anyone? Now, do you still dare to say it?”

Actually, Su Yi was really prepared to be shaved bald already.

But, who would have expected that there would actually be a turnaround.

Ge Ling won!

These few days, he was mocked by Sun Yunjing and the few great city lords immensely.

Venting this frustration now, it really felt invigorating to the max.

His gaze involuntarily looked towards Ye Yuan and discovered that Ye Yuan had his head lowered, looking straight down. It was as if this had nothing to do with him at all.

If it was earlier, he would definitely feel that this guy was pretending to be mysterious.

But now, it was completely not the case at all.

This guy that his daughter brought back, really had the skills.

Sun Yunjing’s expression was very ugly. He was still mocking Su Yi and Ye Yuan just now. Who would have thought that in a blink of an eye, he had his face slapped?

“Su Yi, what are you being smug for? Your Calm South City only won one match!” Sun Yunjing said with a cold snort.

But Su Yi did not care at all and laughed loudly as he said, “So what if one match? One match and you can’t shave bald anymore! At least, you can’t make it zero anymore!”

Sun Yunjing’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “You’re really shameless! One match got you smug until like this!”

Su Yi did not show weakness in the slightest and snorted coldly as he said, “I’m proud of it! I feel great slapping your face!”

Sun Yunjing lost his temper. Su Yi winning under this kind of circumstances was indeed worthy of being proud of.

He was different from him. He did not have hope for Heavenly South City’s resources to begin with.

Now, at least he got lucky!

“That … Young Friend Ye, just now, it was this Su who had eyes but couldn’t see! Now, this Su officially apologizes to you. I hope that Young Friend Ye doesn’t take offense!” Su Yi bowed towards Ye Yuan as he said slightly embarrassedly.

He kept calling brat earlier, not taking Ye Yuan seriously at all.

Now, he was embarrassed.

Logically speaking, he was revered as a city lord, a grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, he should not apologize to a junior.

But Su Yi did not feel that there was anything wrong.

He was not stupid, a grade two heavenly alchemist casually giving pointers could make a grade three heavenly alchemist’s heavenly pill directly advance a grade. This was not what anyone could do.

At least, those three grade four heavenly alchemists above could not do it!

Even Heavenly South City’s titans could not do it, then how strong was the faction behind this young man?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’ll accept the apology, but this Ye gives City Lord Su a word of advice. It’s best if you don’t act like a snob in the future!”

Since he entered, Su Yi had been looking at him through colored glasses. How could he not feel it?

If not looking on the account of Su Peiyun’s face, Ye Yuan would have long fallen out.

A Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum city lord, Ye Yuan did not take him seriously yet.

He had even killed a Jade Sovereign Heaven before. So why would he pay attention to a Limitless Sublime Heaven?

“Insolence!”

“Impudent!”

“To actually dare speak to City Lord His Excellency like this!”

… …

When Su Yi’s guards heard this, they immediately exploded but were stopped by Su Yi.

He believed his daughter’s words now, she really wanted to rope an impressive character in for him, but he kept pushing him out continuously.

It was just as Ye Yuan said. He had acted like a snob!

“All withdraw for me! What Young Friend Ye said is right. This Su did indeed act like a snob before!”

Su Yi’s attitude surprised Ye Yuan a little.

A dignified city lord could actually stomach this grievance.

At this time, Ge Ling came down too.

He directly came before Ye Yuan, gave a deep bow, and said, “This Ge thanks Master Ye for your guidance!”

Ye Yuan accepted it calmly and said coolly, “Do you have any gains?”

The moment Ge Ling heard, he said excitedly, “Plenty of gains!”

By the side, Zuo Fang said with a cold snort,?“Humph!?Pretending to be mysterious! Just now, it was merely getting lucky. Getting cocky for what? The next round, I’ll definitely teach you a lesson!”

Ye Yuan gave Zuo Fang a glance and said coolly, “Refining pills never has any luck. There’s only the inevitability of endless training! Placing your hopes on luck, your accomplishments are bound to be limited.”

Zuo Fang’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold snort, “Brat who’s still wet behind your ears, this old man isn’t Ge Ling that sort of trash. It’s not your turn to come and teach yet! Whether or not it’s luck, you’ll know in the next round!”

He completely did not believe that a few words of guidance could make Ge Ling undergo such an upheaval change.

Being able to refine middle sixth grade could only be attributed to luck!

Very soon, Ge Ling’s Six Ren Carefree Pill was auctioned for a sky-high price of 400 thousand heavenly crystals!

It was directly 100 thousand heavenly crystals higher compared to Zuo Fang’s One Heart Life Crossing Pill previously. It could be seen how high the value of the Six Ren Carefree Pill was.

After resting, the nine cities’ heavenly alchemists went onto the stage again.

Each city had more than one heavenly alchemist.

Hence, there was also a particular method to marshal soldiers for battle.

The strengths of these heavenly alchemists were mostly very close. It depended on how their condition was.

However, to Calm South City, the other heavenly alchemists were seriously somewhat lacking in skill.

So this round, it was still Ge Ling.

“Jiang Li, why don’t you take this round?” Sun Yunjing looked toward Jiang Li and asked.

Zuo Fang’s face turned black, feeling immensely being insulted.

“City Lord, this round, I absolutely won’t lose to him! Earlier, Ge Ling just got lucky; that’s all!” Zuo Fang said in a solemn voice.

Jiang Li fell silent for a moment and said, “Whether or not it’s luck is still hard to say! City Lord, I want to observe again!”

Sun Yunjing nodded and said, “Fine. Master Zuo Fang, you must take him down this time!”

Zuo Fang snorted coldly and said, “Rest assured, he won’t have the chance!”

Carrying a strong desire for revenge, Zuo Fang took the stage again.

This time, he brought out his trump card, the Nine Cauldron Grand Void Pill!

“It’s the Nine Cauldron Grand Void Pill! Master Zuo Fang is releasing a big move!”

“The Nine Cauldron Grand Void Pill is Master Zuo Fang’s signboard! This heavenly pill already infinitely approaches the level of heavenly imperial pill. Furthermore, Master Zuo Fang’s highest record is upper sixth grade!”

“Master Ge Ling unleashed his ultimate move too! What he’s refining this time is the Fuxi Pure Yang Pill! The difficulties of the two heavenly pills are evenly-matched in strength. However, he’s still a little worse compared to Master Zuo Fang. It’s said that Master Ge Ling’s best record is merely middle fifth grade!”

… …

The moment the refinement started, the crowd became excited.

This match could be said to be a pinnacle showdown already.

In the alchemy competition previously, everyone was holding back.

Firstly, when refining highly complex heavenly pills, stability was insufficient. Any carelessness and the quality would drop.

Secondly, trump cards had to be saved until the end.

Zuo Fang was forced into a corner. That was why he would bring out the Nine Cauldron Grand Void Pill.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
