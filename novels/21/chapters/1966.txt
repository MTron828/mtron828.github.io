Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bang!

Ye Yuan lightly threw a punch out, directly crushing a True God Realm battle spirit to dust.

Entanglement?

It did not exist!

The battle spirit’s strength was not up to his level. It could not cause any hindrance to him at all.

“Sigh, if we had known earlier, we’d have followed me. Facing these battle spirits, body-cultivators have too much advantage.”

“Isn’t that so. It’s too late now.”

...

Extreme Luck’s people had regretful faces. Song Yu’s face swelled to the color of pig liver.

Ye Yuan walking over was like looking at flowers while riding on horseback. It was too effortless.

Very soon, his position went past those squads that went first.

While those squads were still caught in arduous struggles, their progress was very slow.

“Enough crap! Still not moving, the treasures will be snatched by people!” Song Yu said crossly.

One sentence made everyone startle awake. A group of people also rushed into the battle spirit great army.

One squad after another pressed onward ahead and also scattered the battle spirit army. Everyone’s speed of progress also became much faster.

Ye Yuan came out from the center, but at this time, he already walked to the front of the entire squad.

The places that he passed by, those teams were all extremely surprised.

Of course, they were also very envious.

Although the cultivation of a body cultivator was very arduous, at this time, it was undoubtedly the most useful.

“Mn?”

Ye Yuan’s brows suddenly raised up, his gaze sweeping to the earth mound not far away, where more than ten skeletons were lying scattered.

Looking at the appearance, they were the children of destiny that entered in the past.

Existences with the potential to become Empyreans died quietly in this place just like that.

Ye Yuan turned around and walked over towards the earth mound.

“Eh, what is that body cultivator doing? There are quite a number of True God Realm battle spirits over there!”

Ye Yuan’s every action had everyone’s attention. Someone discovered his unusual action very quickly.

The strength of the battle spirits over at the earth mound was clearly a magnitude stronger. There were already quite a lot of True God Realm battle spirits gathered.

But Ye Yuan did not care. Those were mostly First Firmament True God strength battle spirits. They did not pose much threat to him at all.

When he came over, he would smash them with one punch.

Before long, Ye Yuan arrived at those skeletons that numbered over a dozen.

It was only to see him reach his hand out and sweep, collecting the storage rings scattered around the skeletons.

The backgrounds of these children of destiny were all very noble. They naturally would have with them some good stuff. Ye Yuan collected them without being courteous.

When the various teams saw this scene, each and every one of them was extremely envious.

No wonder he was a person with the emperor surmounting aura.

This was picking up treasures wherever he went!

Collecting all the storage rings, Ye Yuan then lifted his hand and punched, blasting out a large hole in the earth mound.

Then, flicking his sleeves grandly, he swept those skeletons inside.

“All of you are also considered pitiful people. I’ll lay you all to rest.”

Ye Yuan gave a sigh and buried these skeletons.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s heart stirred. A weak aura was detected by him.

“These children of destiny clearly know that it’s dangerous here, but all run over here. There’s a problem!” Ye Yuan thought.

His gaze aimed at the top of this earth mound, even though that side had people’s line of sight blocked by countless battle spirits.

“Mn? What is he trying to do?”

Everyone was extremely doubtful when they saw Ye Yuan’s action.

The further one went up, the stronger the strength of the battle spirits.

If Ye Yuan went further up, wasn’t that courting death?

Up there were Second Firmament True God powerful battle spirits!

No matter how strong your defensive power was, could it still resist a Second Firmament True God?

But Ye Yuan went up just like that.

Heading up, First Firmament True God battle spirits became more and more. Ye Yuan did not care at all, giving a punch for each one, hitting until those battle spirits cried in pain.

When the children of destiny below saw this scene, each and every one of them was shocked until they stared dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

This strength was also a little too fearsome, right?

Dealing with a First Firmament True God battle spirit, they could achieve it very easily.

But a group of True God Realm battle spirits, their pressure would be very great.

However, Ye Yuan seemed to be completely fine.

Ye Yuan’s attention was not on those battle spirits at all. His eyes were looking around, as if searching for something.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up.

In the dirt, an inconspicuous battle armor caught his attention.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Right at this time, three battle spirits suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking his path.

Ye Yuan looked at those three battle spirits and said with a faint smile, “It’s not easy for you all to cultivate. Do you want to dissipate like clouds and mist?”

The three battle spirits were indifferent. Roaring wildly, they pounced over toward Ye Yuan.

These three battle spirits were shockingly Second Firmament True Gods.

There were also more than ten First Firmament True God battle spirits that pounced over together with them.

Far away, when Song Yu saw this scene, he was immediately wildly ecstatic.

“Die! Die! Who ask you to posture! Three Second Firmament True God battle spirits, I want to see how you fend off!”

Roar!

A dragon roar surged to the sky, obliterating the three Second Firmament True God battle spirits.

Those battle spirits immediately had a large swarm of them dead.

Then, Ye Yuan laid his hands on that unremarkable battle armor from the earth mound.

“S-So strong! I really didn’t expect that his strength was actually so strong! Those were three Second Firmament True God battle spirits! They were actually obliterated by him just like that.”

“Eh, what’s he holding in his hand? It looks shabby and tattered.”

...

Right at this time, that battle armor trembled slightly. The dust on it immediately scattered off.

A powerful force immediately appeared before everyone.

That battle armor seemed to be emitting a joyous light cry.

Song Yu’s face changed and he cried out in surprise, “This undulation, could it be ... could it be an empyrean spirit treasure?”

Whoosh!

That battle armor turned into a stream of flowing light, wrapping Ye Yuan’s body up.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, and he said with a smile, “Qinghong Battle Armor! Not bad, not bad! Good stuff! No wonder those children of destiny all braved the danger and still wanted to climb up this earth mound.”

This battle armor was called Qinghong Battle Armor. It was precisely an empyrean spirit treasure.

Everyone looked toward Ye Yuan with envious looks on their faces.

Inside this Ancient God Battlefield, there were treasures everywhere. It depended on whether you had the lucky chance to obtain it.

No one could have thought that Ye Yuan actually obtained an empyrean spirit treasure so effortlessly!

Right at this time, several First Firmament True God battle spirits pounced toward Ye Yuan without heed for their lives once again.

All of a sudden, a green light radiated brilliantly on Ye Yuan’s body.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Those battle spirits were directly blasted into debris by the green light just like that.

Ye Yuan did not even take the initiative to activate it and it actually had such terrifying power.

A bright pearl being cast into darkness; seeing the light of day again presently, the Qinghong Battle Armor seemed to have the intention of seeking credit, and it actually took the initiative to exhibit its power.

When the others saw this scene, they were all shocked until they could not close their mouths.

This luck was also a little too heaven-defying, right?

If this battle armor was worn on them, that was simply sweeping away all obstacles!

It was just a pity that that belonged to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, his figure moving, descending the earth mound. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Along the way, those battle spirits did not dare to approach him in the slightest at all.

With the Qinghong Battle Armor, it was even more effortless for him to advance now.

When the rest saw this scene, apart from envy, it was still envy.

Except, they did not dare to ease up in the least.

Continuing ahead, Ye Yuan even casually picked up quite a number of true god mystic treasures by the roadside.

Either way, he was walking in front. Everyone could not keep up with his speed at all.

Those children of destiny were all angered until they vomited blood. They were powerless to do anything no matter what.
