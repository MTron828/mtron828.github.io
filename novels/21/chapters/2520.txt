Chapter 2526: Everyone, Get Lost for Me!

A youth in brocade slowly walked out of the back hall.

Beside him followed a rather attractive middle-aged lady who had partly lost her good looks, looking respectful and submissive.

The moment the youth appeared, Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu’s faces changed at the same time.

“Y-Young Master Yu!”

Li Zhengqiu had a smug look as he said, “This marriage affair was single-handedly arranged by Young Master Yu.”

Young Master Yu stopped in front of the two, looking at them with a condescending gaze, as he said coolly, “The Yang and Li families have fought for many times. This young master will be a mediator and tie a nuptial knot, burying the hatchet. Do the two of you have any objections?”

“N-No objections!” Being cowed by Young Master Yu’s imposing momentum, Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu could not help taking two steps back.

Young Master Yu nodded his head and said, “It’s been hard on the two of you, sending Younger Sister Xuezhen back from far away. If you’re free, go to the Tang Family for a drink.”

The moment the two people heard, they could not help being overjoyed.

This Tang Yu was the Tang Family’s eldest young master, his status revered.

The Tang Family’s status in the imperial city was completely not what these few families could compare to.

The Tang Family was one of Eastward Country’s three great family clans, their power and influence spreading across the entire Eastward Country.

Behind them was the royal family’s Second Prince, His Highness.

With this layer of connection, who dared to not give the Tang Family face?

Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu dared to posture in front of Li Zhengqiu but did not dare to act wildly in front of Tang Yu.

And Tang Yu’s sentence that had the intention of solicitation made the two of them ecstatic.

The Tang Family’s tall branch was not what any family clan could cling onto!

“T-Thanks, Young Master Yu!” The two said with joy.

Not far away, Yang Xuezhen’s eyes were filled with despair.

She did not think that she actually had to face such a situation when she came back.

“Two senior apprentice brothers, you guys …” Yang Xuezhen was almost weeping.

At the time of despair, these two were her final straw to clutch at.

But now, even these two people also …

Lu Yuanjie let out a sigh and said, “Junior Apprentice Sister, actually, Younger Brother Zhengqiu is a man of striking appearance. He is also a pretty good choice! The two of you are even well-matched in social status!”

Yang Xuezhen’s gaze was cold as she said angrily, “Senior Apprentice Brother Lu, didn’t expect that you’re actually this kind of person who acts in bad faith! Consider it that I, Yang Xuezhen, misjudged you!”

Lu Yuanjie gave a cold snort when he heard that, suddenly turning hostile as he said, “Yang Xuezhen, don’t pretend to be pure in front of this young master! Don’t think that this young master doesn’t know, aren’t you just making use of this young master to deal with Li Zhengqiu?”

Yang Xuezhen’s complexion turned deathly pale and she said stiffly, “You …” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Actually, it was not Yang Xuezhen who begged them to come at all, but that these two people pestered incessantly to follow.

Yang Xuezhen refused at first. But at her time of despair, she could only borrow these two people’s power.

She did not expect that now, Lu Yuanjie was actually playing the blame game!

Normally, Lu Yuanjie ingratiated himself with her in all manners. But, his face changed like flipping a book.

“Alright, Young Sister Xuezhen, your mother and Madam Xiao have both already agreed to this marriage. Furthermore, this young master feels like Zhengqiu is pretty good, his background also matches yours. You won’t suffer from injustice either. If enmity isn’t settled amicably, there is no end to it! Why not give me face and agree to this marriage, how about it?” Tang Yu looked at Yang Xuezhen and said gently.

She gritted her teeth and said, “Young Master Yu, even if I, Yang Xuezhen, were to die, I also won’t marry the son of the enemy who killed my father!”

Tang Yu did not seem to care, saying with a smile, “Is that so? If that’s the case, this young master can’t guarantee the safety of your mother’s life anymore.”

Yang Xuezhen’s expression changed, her beautiful body trembling, almost falling to the ground.

Despair!

The current Yang Xuezhen was only left with this kind of emotion.

Wanted to die, but she could not die!

Even had to be coerced into marrying the enemy who killed her father!

This kind of despair, who could understand it?

Tang Yu covered the sky with one hand, a woman like her did not have any leeway to resist at all!

“Junior Apprentice Sister, what’s wrong with being the Li Family’s daughter-in-law? Why go so far! Could it be that you can’t bear to part with this boy who ascended from the Lower Realms?” Gui Tianyu suddenly said.

The moment he spoke, everyone turned their eyes to Ye Yuan.

The ascender aura on his body was too distinct.

Previously, everyone’s focus was all on Yang Xuezhen, and none of them noticed this ascender.

But now, after Gui Tianyu’s reminder, Ye Yuan became the focus of everyone’s attention all at once!

Furthermore, Gui Tianyu had an implied meaning in his words. He was clearly dooming Ye Yuan.

Yang Xuezhen’s beautiful body trembled and she hurriedly said to Ye Yuan, “Y-You quickly leave! Young Master Yu, I don’t know him. I just brought him out of Inklight Forest, that’s all!”

But Young Master Yu said coolly, “Since that’s the case, an ant who just ascended, kill him and be done with it. It’s no big deal, right? Zhengqiu, Xuezhen is your woman. You take care of this matter yourself.”

Sure enough, Li Zhengqiu’s gaze turned cold and he said with a cold smile, “A toad also wants to lust after swan meat? An ant-like thing actually dares to compete with this young master for a woman?”

Yang Xuezhen did not have much feelings for Ye Yuan, but she did not expect that she actually dragged Ye Yuan in.

Her heart was burning with anxiety, but she also felt powerless.

In the imperial city, people that Young Master Yu wanted to kill, there were really none who could escape before.

“She isn’t my woman!” The Ye Yuan who had been silent all along suddenly said.

The moment these words came out, everyone laughed.

This kid was scared!

“Hahaha?… you coward! Weren’t you very arrogant? Now, scared? Can’t wait to draw the line anymore?” Gui Tianyu said with a loud laugh.

A kind of ridicule came over from Lu Yuanjie and the group of family guards.

Young Master Yu just smiled slightly, clearly feeling that Ye Yuan was very laughable too.

Yang Xuezhen bit her lips gently. She understood Ye Yuan, but in this kind of situation, how she wished that someone could stand by her side!

She was Ye Yuan’s life savior after all, but Ye Yuan actually turned his back on her at this time.

Sad!

Despair!

Amidst everyone’s loud laugh, Ye Yuan said nonchalantly, “But, she won’t be your woman either! Now, all get lost for me!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s laughter did not stop, but became even louder instead.

“Huhu,?you’re making me get lost? Did your brain get squeezed by the plane passageway when you were ascending until it spoiled? Brat, kneel down now and apologize. Maybe if this young master is in a good mood, I can still spare your life!” Li Zhengqiu said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan looked at Li Zhengqiu quietly and said lightly,?“Oh,?is that so?”

Swoosh!

Right at this time, Ye Yuan moved.

Only to see an afterimage flashed past, Ye Yuan’s speed was swift to the extreme.

Bang!

Bang!

It was only to hear two crisp sounds, Li Zhengqiu knelt down.

His kneecaps were already kicked to pieces by Ye Yuan!

The laughter stopped abruptly!

Everyone looked towards Ye Yuan, eyes filled with shock.

This ant-like ascender crippled the middle Lesser Sublime Heaven Li Zhengqiu in one move?

“This … How is this possible? He’s clearly an ant who just ascended!” Gui Tianyu said in shock.

“S-Spatial rule! Just now, that was … spatial rule?” Lu Yuanjie’s pupils constricted as he exclaimed.

In Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, spatial rule was similarly an extremely hard to comprehend power of rule.

Arriving here, Ye Yuan’s spatial rule was greatly suppressed.

It was just that, it was enough to deal with Li Zhengqiu!

Ye Yuan was still expressionless and said indifferently, “Since you knelt down, I’ll spare your life then. Now, everyone, get lost for me!”
