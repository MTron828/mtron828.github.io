Chapter 1625 Combat Strength That Astonished the World!

splash!

as soon as they landed, gu han directly knelt down and kowtowed toward ye yuan.

“elder ye, i beg you, save master!” gu han said with red eyes.

when they came out earlier, ye yuan also brought gu han along conveniently.

being able to say those words at that time showed that this kid’s nature was not bad. it was just that he was too arrogant and willful in the past, that was why he would argue a point to death.

ye yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “your river eternal imperial city engages in close combat with fiend race territories and should be the most hostile. but when ling zikun encountered the fiend race, he actually still wanted to pretend to be polite and compliant. this kind of person, why should i save him?”

not that ye yuan had a heart of stone, but that he really had enough of these people’s shamelessness.

gu han gritted his teeth and said, “master has shown great kindness to me. i can’t watch him die here unfeelingly! elder ye ... if elder ye doesn’t save him, i’ll rush back!”

ye yuan said coolly, “you go back then. i only saved you conveniently. if you seek death yourself, can i still stop you?”

gu han’s blood surged, suddenly standing up, and rushed over to that side.

but he had not walked a few steps when countless dark-red eyes swept over toward him.

swoosh! swoosh! swoosh!

a large group of deboning great rats rushed over toward him!

gu han seemed to have been splashed by a basin of cold water, his entire body feeling penetratingly cold.

at the same time, a powerful force field instantly enveloped him, making him unable to move a muscle.

origin deity realms were simply too weak here.

plop!

gu han took a few steps back in fright but was stumbled by a rock.

“h-help!”

a figure flashed, a sharp edge appeared!

puu, puu, puu ...

with a single sword move, those variant deboning great rats were directly cut into two!

ye yuan stood with a sword, his back turned to gu han as he said coolly, “still want to go back?”

gu han’s head shook like a rattling drum, frightened until he kept trembling.

only at this time did he truly realize how great the gap between him and ye yuan was.

when he encountered these fierce beasts, he did not even have the courage to attack.

but ye yuan killed them as easy as taking something out of his pocket!

him going back was no different from courting death.

swoosh! swoosh! swoosh!

more and more variant deboning great rats were drawn by this side, rushing over to this side.

ye yuan’s sword moved agilely, like a harvester, willfully reaping these deboning great rats’ lives. there was no enemy who could last one exchange at all.

“relax, those few old fellows are each more shrewd than the last, each with a foundation deeper than the other. although these deboning great rats are powerful, wanting to kill them is probably still a little lacking,” ye yuan said indifferently as he brandished his sword.

not just gu han, it was also zheng qi and heavenly eagle’s people’s first time seeing ye yuan make a move. they were similarly incomparably shocked in their hearts.

ye yuan avoided gu han’s attacks with spatial laws and did not really make a move.

but now, they finally knew how powerful ye yuan was!

if ye yuan made a move back then, gu han probably could not even receive one move and would be insta-killed!

“turns out that elder ye wasn’t powerful in spatial laws. his truly formidable aspect is on fusion of laws!”

“to be able to fuse sword dao laws and spatial laws to this extent, elder ye is truly a genius among geniuses! this is even harder than solely comprehending spatial laws!”

“very clearly, elder ye still has plenty more in his sack! really don’t know how powerful his strength will be if he goes all out!”

...

originally, when everyone saw ye yuan make a move, they still had the intention of going forward to help.

but looking at it now, they did not need to take action at all.

those deboning great rats could not approach him at all!

these variant deboning great rats were existences that even divine lord realm powerhouses were very fearful of. ye yuan was actually like in his own backyard.

in a blink, ye yuan slew hundreds of deboning great rats, but he was still calm and composed, unable to see the slightest hint of disorderly aura. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

suddenly, an enormous deboning great rat dashed out of the huge rat swarm, turning into a stream of flowing light and charged straight for ye yuan.

“ye yuan, careful! this is a rank four fierce beast!” zheng qi cried out.

finished talking, he was about to make a move to go help ye yuan.

ye yuan suddenly spoke up, “none of you move! what i was waiting for was it!”

everyone exchanged glances, eyes full of disbelief.

facing a rank four deboning great rat, ye yuan did not retreat, but advanced instead, raising his sword and rushing over toward it.

at this time, ye yuan’s aura skyrocketed, sword energy wispy and ethereal, shuttling back and forth in space.

ye yuan’s sword dao laws had long broken through to fourth-layered heaven in the spatial inheritance!

fourth-layered heaven sword dao laws fused with second-layered heaven spatial laws, this was unprecedented.

its power had now reached the time to test it out!

bang! bang! bang!

ye yuan’s sword energy intersected with the deboning great rat’s sharp claws in midair. spiritual energy fluctuated, blasting those deboning great rats flying out.

when heavenly eagle’s people saw this scene, each and every one of them was utterly stunned.

“i ... what did i see? an origin deity realm martial artist actually fought to a draw with a rank four fierce beast?”

“no, wait, my eyes must be blurry! rank four versus rank three is invincible, how can someone possibly break this curse?”

“there’s actually such a freak in this world! so monstrous! elder ye is simply not human!”

“elder ye is truly quiet when not making a move, the moment he makes his move, it’s earth-shattering and heaven-battering!”

...

rank four fierce beasts also evolved a small world within their bodies and were similarly able to use world power.

and ye yuan actually fought to a draw with it!

this kind of combat strength was simply inconceivable, shocking everyone’s jaws off.

when ye yuan was at grotto profound deity realm, he had also once jumped realms and defeated a heaven glimpse deity realm powerhouse before.

but that significance was completely extraordinary compared to now.

to the vast majority of the people, this kind of battle across major realms was impossible.

but there was a small minority of geniuses who could still rely on powerful law comprehensions to jump realms and defeat their opponents.

when ye yuan was in the small world, those martial artists’ experience and knowledge naturally could not compare to the heavenspan world’s martial artists.

but even in the heavenspan world, origin deity realm martial artist not being able to defeat divine lord realms was also an iron law!

there had never been anybody who could break this iron law!

from rank three to rank four, that was a qualitative metamorphosis.

once martial artists possessed world power, that was truly possessing the qualifications to rule over a region because he could insta-kill all existences below his realm!

therefore, the intensity of the astonishment in the hearts of heavenly eagle’s people could be imagined.

ye yuan wielded the junyi sword, his entire person seemingly turning into a god of war. each sword came and went like a shadow, drifting from place to place.

the misty sword art at this time was truly being performed by ye yuan to the peak!

even rank four fierce beasts could only eat dust under ye yuan’s sword too!

zheng qi’s eyes became wide-saucers, his mouth opened for a long time and could not close.

now, even he was somewhat doubting how in the world heavenly eagle imperial city found such a freak.

“i thought that i already had a clear understanding of ye yuan’s strength. but only now do i know that my understanding of him was merely the tip of the iceberg! this kid, giving us any surprises after this isn’t gonna be surprising!” zheng qi said with a bitter smile.
