Chapter 2242: Infinite God Killing Bow!

In just a blink of an eye, the Silvernet Blood Essence tunneled into that person’s bosom.

Ye Yuan’s injuries had yet to recover, but it was already too late to want to catch up.

The current Silvernet Blood Essence was already unbelievably weak. That person hugged him, Dao marks flashing on his body.

The Silvernet Blood Essence was actually recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Then, the Silvernet Blood Essence chirruped. People had no idea what he was talking about.

That person’s gaze looked toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly turned stiff, feeling like his throat was being clutched by someone, unable to even breathe.

This person was too terrifying!

Just this look, Ye Yuan was certain that the other party’s strength was probably much more horrifying than Nineorigin!

That was right, this guy who walked out of the blood pool, his aura was identical with Nineorigin’s.

He was of the divine race!

Furthermore, he was an existence even more terrifying than Nineorigin!

The divine race powerhouse rubbed the Silvernet Blood Essence’s little head and said, “Relax, this ancestor helped you to unlock intelligence. So you’re this ancestor’s person. If somebody bullies you, this ancestor will naturally seek justice for you. After this ancestor takes care of these few fellows, I’ll extract that boy’s divine soul out, and let you eat him!”

Hearing this, the Silvernet Blood Essence giggled, appearing very happy.

A hint of surprise flashed across Ye Yuan’s eyes, but he did not run away.

The Silvernet Blood Essence was not captured, so how could he possibly escape?

At most ... enter the gray-pupil state once more and clash head-on with this guy once!

Although this divine race powerhouse was extremely terrifying, his present state was far from comparable to Nineorigin.

Even though Ye Yuan was wary, it was not to the extent of fleeing in defeat either.

The divine race powerhouse gave Ye Yuan a glance rather unexpectedly and said, “Under this ancestor’s pressure, you actually didn’t escape. Boy, you somewhat surprised me.”

Ye Yuan was merely a little crawling bug in his eyes. He would not care at all.

His attention was still on those several Heavenly Emperors.

After all, those were existences that could threaten him.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned slightly dark and he said, “You’re the divine race’s ancestor. So you call yourself this ancestor?”

“You know about the divine race?” The divine race powerhouse was really surprised this time.

While the few Heavenly Emperors looked at Ye Yuan with blank faces. Clearly, they had not heard of such an amazing race before.

“Not only do I know, but I also even fought them before. It’s just a pity, too weak!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Seeing the divine race, the fury in Ye Yuan’s heart soared, and he naturally did not have any good expression.

The moment the divine race powerhouse heard, he could not help bursting out laughing and said, “Haha ... weak? It’s still the first time somebody said that the divine race is weak in front of this ancestor! Boy, you’re very cocky! However, you have to come up with a draft first when you’re boasting too! My divine race, in the same rank, there’s still no problem fighting ten of you by themselves!”

“Is that so? Then I wonder how many of your divine sons can fight me alone?” Ye Yuan said with a look of contempt.

The divine race powerhouse’s eyes shrunk again. He discovered that Ye Yuan really seemed to know quite a bit about the divine race!

The past had faded like smoke. Those in this Heavenspan World who knew that the divine race’s existence were only those old monsters who survived from the last epoch.

How could this brat in front of him possibly know?

His gaze turned dark and he said in a cold voice, “Humph! Brat, to dare provoke this ancestor! Well done, after this ancestor takes care of these few, I’ll slowly deal with you again!”

Finished talking, his gaze turned sharp and he said to those few people, “Alright, send the few of you on the way first!”

Done talking, the aura on the divine race powerhouse’s body suddenly erupted, causing Dao marks flickering incessantly.

An outrageous pressure made the faces of the few great Heavenly Emperors change drastically.

They were currently heavily injured and did not even have the chance to escape.

However, right at this time, something unforeseen happened!

The Dao marks on the divine race powerhouse’s body stimulated the air in the enormous cave all at once.

Rumble!

An even more frightening energy undulation than before rose up in the huge cave.

Within the karst cave, the blood light faded, eight dazzling beams of light suddenly lit up, rapidly spreading to the eight directions of the cave.

Those eight directions were precisely where the eight god statues were located.

Rumble!

The eight god statues actually came to life all at once!

The eight god statues moved around, each and every one of their postures extremely bizarre.

Their mouths even emitted strange syllables, like they were chanting.

Suddenly, the void trembled!

Limitless golden light shone inside the cave, akin to a blazing sun descending, illuminating every place in the cave as if it was daytime.

That boundless blood color was completely replaced by golden light in this instant. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

An ancient aura came out of the void.

The expression of the divine race powerhouse changed abruptly, crying out in surprise, “Limitless God Killing Bow! This bunch of damn things, not resting even if they are dead! To actually still leave behind such a contingency!”

Ye Yuan looked above the dome with a face of shock, a golden bow and arrow slowly appeared.

This bow’s aura was horrifying to the extreme.

Ye Yuan had seen before a heavenly emperor spirit treasure, but even Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’ Youluo Ghost Lantern paled in comparison to this bow and arrow.

This aura seemed to be from above the clouds as if it came from Heavenly Dao.

Dominating myriad things!

“Dao artifact! This is a Dao artifact! The blood sea has existed for countless tens of thousands of years. I didn’t expect ... that it was actually still hiding a Dao artifact!”

Looking at that bow and arrow, Heavenly Emperor Quicksand’s face carried unbelievable shock.

Right at this time, the golden bow completely revealed its image.

The entire underground cave started trembling violently.

Space was twisting, the cave was collapsing.

The aura of this bow and arrow was seriously too strong!

The divine race powerhouse seemed to be crazy, laughing loudly as he said, “Hahaha ... there’s the Limitless God Killing Bow and Sunderless Feather Emperor Arrow! What can you all, this bunch of damn things, do to me? I, Daymeld, will receive an arrow from you head-on!”

Daymeld’s aura skyrocketed. The Dao marks on his body turned into a huge domain.

An aura that showed disdain on all under the heavens erupted from his body.

This horrifying aura was actually able to stand up to the Limitless God Killing Bow above the dome as an equal!

When Heavenly Emperor Quicksand and the rest saw this scene, each and every one of their faces revealed astonished looks.

“What a terrifying aura! His aura is clearly just around Sixth Firmament Heavenly Emperor, but how can he be so strong? Just what kind of race is this divine race? Why have I never heard of it before?”

Even Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted too!

Daymeld’s control of Dao marks was absolutely far above Nineorigin’s!

This guy’s strength was too terrifying.

Ye Yuan weighed it over. Even if he took Daymeld into his small world and carried out a life-and-death battle with him, he did not have the assurance to finish off the other party either.

Fortunately, the powerhouse who sealed Daymeld back then left behind a contingency.

Even if this arrow could not kill Daymeld, it could definitely seriously injure him too!

While at this time, the Limitless God Killing Bow above the dome was slowly drawn.

A peerlessly domineering aura surged to the sky, burst right through the cave, and headed straight for the clouds!

At this moment, the entire Shinra Ghost Region could feel this astonishing aura.

Outside the cave, starlight sprinkled down.

Bow arched to the limit like the full moon!

Only seeing this scene did Ye Yuan know why Daymeld chose to receive it head-on.

Not that he did not want to run, but that he could not escape!

This power, even if you run beyond the ninth level, you could not evade this arrow either!

Daymeld let out an explosive roar as he roared furiously, “Come!”

As if hearing Daymeld’s challenge, the Limitless God Killing Bow released an arrow!
