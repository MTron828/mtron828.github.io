Chapter 2448: Not a Shameful Thing

“Oh, is that so? Looks like it’s indeed pretty scary.”

Facing Xin’s three great Heavenly Dao True Martials, Ye Yuan appeared very calm.

It was only to see him extend a hand out casually, and he then called out, “Sword, come.” Then the Sword of Spacetime came into being!

The oppressive chill made Xin’s expression change.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan could actually condense a light sword out of thin air too.

“Then let me see how strong the three great Heavenly Dao True Martials targeting me are.” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly.

Xin’s wrath was instantly ignited.

Ye Yuan did not take him seriously at all!

“Courting death!”

Xin clenched his jaws tightly, the wings behind his back shaking slightly. His figure cut right through the void, arriving a thousand feet in front of Ye Yuan.

The speed was inconceivably swift!

Only to see his wrist turn, the Void Blade suddenly slashed, directly slicing open a hole in the void.

At the same time, layers of frost appeared around Ye Yuan.

The space around him was actually directly frozen!

Three great Heavenly Dao True Martials suddenly erupting, the power was truly formidable to the extreme.

The surrounding divine children were all extremely excited, they were already brought into submission by Xin’s strength.

“DIE!”

Xin let out a loud roar, the Void Blade slashing down without hesitation.

But right then, Ye Yuan moved.

There was no astonishing strike with a shocking commotion. Even spatial law was not used, he just met the Void Blade with a casual swing.

The frost in front of him was directly sliced into two.

The so-called imprisonment became a joke.

Xin’s pupils constricted, he did not expect that the light sword in Ye Yuan’s hand was actually so sharp!

In a blink of an eye, the blade and sword intersected!

Crack ... Crack, crack!

The Void Blade in Xin’s hand actually produced fine cracks.

“Pffft!”

Xin seemed to have suffered a heavy blow, his entire person being blown away.

The Void Blade in his hand fragmented inch by inch!

With a frontal clash, three great Heavenly Dao True Martials collapsed with a loud bang.

Ye Yuan won!

Xin spurted a mouthful of blood wildly, eyes looking at Ye Yuan in shock.

Everyone was transfixed, not daring to believe the scene before their eyes.

Three great Heavenly Dao True Martials, cultivation realm winning Ye Yuan’s, he was actually completely defeated with one exchange?

This was too ridiculous, right?

“N-No way, right? Lord Xin couldn’t even receive a single move?”

“Lord Xin is already a top existence among Nine-marks powerhouses. He was actually leapfrogged by a human in cultivation realm and then defeated? W-Who is he?”

“When did such a prodigious powerhouse appear in the human race?”

... ...

The divine children felt that their worldview had completely crumbled.

The powerful divine race was actually defeated by a human!

“This is the result of your hard work over these years? Really weak!” Ye Yuan brandished his sword and cornered Ye Yuan, a look of disappointment on his face.

Xin was indeed very strong, it was just that he was not even as good as the Daymeld after getting injured, how could he be his match?

Let alone that the current Ye Yuan was also much stronger compared to when he just broke through.

Xin had a look that was battered out of his senses, he cultivated bitterly for so long, narrowly escaping death several times, what he waited for was today.

Ever since the last defeat, his strength advanced by leaps and bounds these few years, and he originally thought that he could avenge himself.

Who would have expected that he lost in a single exchange!

The three great Heavenly Dao True Martials were weak like a pile of sand sculptures in front of Ye Yuan, crumbling at a touch.

Before taking action, he felt that he was strong to the extreme.

But after attacking, just as Ye Yuan said, he was too weak!

“Impossible! H-How can I lose to you? This is impossible! How much hardship have I suffered these few years, it was for the sake of defeating you! I won’t lose! I won’t lose!” Xin roared angrily.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “You only cared about cultivating, you probably don’t know how many major events happened outside these few years. If you knew, you wouldn’t be so naive anymore. Uh ... But it all doesn’t matter. Tell me about Li-er’s affairs, or ... die.”

Ye Yuan’s words were said very lightly as if they were friends engaging in small talk.

But anyone could tell that he did not mind killing Xin off.

Xin and Nineorigin were both the chief culprits who took Li-er away back then. Ye Yuan did not have the slightest psychological burden in killing him.

“Humph! Kill if you want to! Even if I die, I won’t tell you a single word too!” Xin roared angrily.

“Oh,

go and die then.”

Ye Yuan just gave a nonchalant “oh.” The Sword of Spacetime was moving forward, and it was about to kill. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The expressions of the divine children changed wildly, not expecting that Ye Yuan was actually so decisive.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly changed, disappearing from his original spot with a teleport.

Space trembled slightly. An old man stepped out of the void in front of Xin. Appearing together with him was also Originguard.

The moment this old man in front of him appeared, Ye Yuan felt an extremely strong pressure.

This old man looked just like an ordinary old man.

Too ordinary!

Then there was only one explanation. This old man was too strong!

The old man said with a laugh, “Hoho, well-deserving of being the Saint Azure of eternity. Such keen insight!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said, “You’re ... the Profound Lineage’s progenitor?”

The old man nodded slightly and admitted, “This old man is Originsmile. I’m precisely the Profound Lineage’s progenitor.”

Xin had a shocked face. He did not expect that it actually alarmed Lord Progenitor!

“Lord Originsmile, I ... I lost face for the Profound Lineage!” Xin knelt down and kowtowed as he said.

Originsmile said smilingly, “There’s no shame in losing to Saint Azure. Get up.”

Xin had a dumbfounded look, uncertain what it meant.

Originguard motioned for him not to talk and to just listen by the side.

Originsmile looked toward Ye Yuan and said, “With how honorable Saint Azure’s status is, don’t haggle over things with juniors. Li-er is different from them and isn’t cultivating in Heavenly War Hunting Ground. You can’t inquire about anything too. Why not go to this old man’s place? This old man will tell you everything. How about it?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed tightly, very unhappy with Originsmile’s form of address[1].

However, he still nodded his head and said, “Okay!”

“Please!” Originsmile turned sideways slightly and made an inviting hand gesture.

Ye Yuan did not say a word, figure moving, merging into the void.

Everyone present was dumbfounded.

All the way until Originsmile’s figure disappeared, the entire Heavenly War Hunting Ground was deathly silent.

Lord Progenitor was actually so polite to a human?

There was no mistake, right?

Especially Xin, his pair of eyes were almost popping out.

He thought that Progenitor came to help him kill Ye Yuan. In the end, he was so courteous toward Ye Yuan.

“Lord Originguard, this ... what’s going on here?” Xin asked dumbfoundedly.

Originguard sighed and said, “Ye Yuan is no longer the original Ye Yuan! You’ve been in closed-seclusion cultivation all along these few years and don’t know what happened in the outside world. Our divine race’s defeat was thanks to him!”

Originguard did not hide anything either, briefly recounting Ye Yuan’s matter.

Finished saying, Originguard patted Xin’s shoulder and said with a sigh, “Losing to him isn’t something disgraceful. You have to know, even the human race’s nine great Dao Ancestors suffered a big loss to him! Otherwise, with his cultivation realm, how can he dare enter the Abyss World?”

Finished saying, Originguard turned around and left.

Xin’s entire person was frozen there, feeling like his entire person was unwell.

Anyone who heard about Ye Yuan’s affairs would probably not be fine.

Xin was merely having the same reaction of Originguard back then.
