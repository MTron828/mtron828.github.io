Chapter 2103: Kneel Down

“This ... This ... I ... I ...” Crimsonsky’s face reddened to the ears, stammering heavily, not knowing how to explain.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was sharp and fierce as he said with a cold cry, “Kneel down!”

Crimsonsky trembled all over, raising his head high as he said with refusal to give in, “Based on what to make me kneel down?”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “I’m the Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred. In terms of status, I’m even above your master, High Priest Redplume! Even if he saw me here, he also won’t dare to be as impudent as you. Why? I’m not allowed to make you kneel? Or is that to have me go and reason it out in front of High Priest Redplume?”

All of the Empyreans were silent like cicadas in winter. No one expected that once Ye Yuan exploded, the commotion would actually be so shocking.

Just now, Crimsonsky was still ordering people here and there by pointing with a finger when he came in. But at this time, he did not even dare to breathe loudly anymore.

Furthermore, what Ye Yuan said was also very reasonable.

Even if High Priest Redplume was here, he also would not dare to rebut Ye Yuan to his face.

Otherwise, why would Gongyang Lie play this kind of small trick where he was agreeable in public while opposing in private?

Crimsonsky’s expression flickered incessantly and looked toward Gongyang Lie pleadingly.

Gongyang Lie let out a slight sigh, but he had yet to open his mouth when he heard Ye Yuan say with a cold laugh, “You want to plead on his behalf? Then your meaning is that he blasphemed Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s face and doesn’t need to be punished?”

Gongyang Lie choked when he heard that and could only say to Crimsonsky, “Sigh, get on your knees!”

This matter, he really could not help Crimsonsky anymore.

If it reached the ears of Sacred Ancestor High Priest, this issue could not be settled no matter what.

Unless, he killed Ye Yuan.

But there were so many people present. So who dared to kill the Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred?

Crimsonsky stood there with a face of struggle.

As High Priest Redplume’s proud disciple, Crimsonsky gathered myriad glory on him and always had his eyes at the top of his head. When had he suffered such humiliation before?

It was just that the prestige of the Sacred Ancestor did not allow provocation!

This point, he could still weigh the relative importance.

“Kneel down!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan gave a cold cry. Crimsonsky trembled and knelt in front of Ye Yuan with a thud.

The group of Empyreans was completely stunned. Crimsonsky was actually punished by someone; he was to kneel toward that person.

They should not look at how each and every one of them was a Seven-star priest, comprising of middle and late-stage Empyrean mighty experts. In front of Crimsonsky, they were still a head lower.

Crimsonsky was arrogant, but he also had the capital to be arrogant.

He only used 8000 years and reached Ancestor Realm in Alchemy Dao. He was the fastest to reach Ancestor Realm among all of High Priest Redplume’s disciples.

This kind of talent, coupled with his identity as High Priest Redplume’s disciple, was sufficient for him to do as he pleased in the Westspirit Region.

Hence, when these Empyreans saw Crimsonsky, they all had to bow respectfully.

But now, he was punished with kneeling toward someone else!

Ye Yuan looked down from a height and denounced sharply with a scowl, “Crimsonsky, do you know your crime?”

How proud and arrogant was Crimsonsky? He was about to explode on the spot but he saw Gongyang Lie winking at him non-stop, and he could not help being startled.

“Crimsonsky knows his crime!” Crimsonsky gritted his teeth and said.

How sly and cunning was Gongyang Lie? He was far from what Crimsonsky, this guy, who grew up soaking in a honey jar, could compare to.

At this time, the more Crimsonsky retorted, the more miserable the outcome.

In fact, if it really went out of control in the end and Ye Yuan ordered people to kill Crimsonsky, no one would dare to say a word of no either.

Offending the Second Sage was equivalent to offending Sacred Ancestor High Priest. Killing you was you getting off lightly!

Fortunately, Crimsonsky was not stupid and understood Gongyang Lie’s meaning very quickly. He could only swallow his pride and endure in silence.

“Good that you know your crime! Now, this sage punishes you to kneel and repent in front of the Sacred Ancestor’s statue for half a month. Do you accept the punishment?” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Crimsonsky suddenly lifted his head, his gaze full of rage.

The Demon Divine Pill Convention was about to happen right away, how numerous were the demons coming and going in front of the Sacred Ancestor Plaza?

But he had to kneel for as long as half a month in front of the statue. Wouldn’t he become a laughingstock for everyone?

This guy definitely did it on purpose!

“Mn? Do you feel that you weren’t wrong?” Ye Yuan’s voice gradually became cold.

Crimsonsky glared at Ye Yuan, his eyes spewing fire as he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Crimsonsky ... received the punishment!”

Ye Yuan flicked his sleeves grandly and said coolly, “Go on!”

Crimsonsky’s chest was practically about to explode. Carrying limitless grievances, he came in front of the Sacred Ancestor’s status and knelt down.

All of the Empyreans were dumbfounded. Crimsonsky came in a threatening manner, clearly to find Ye Yuan to fight for supremacy. In the end, he barely said a few words and was punished to kneel before the Sacred Ancestor’s statue. This really made everyone’s jaws drop.”

But many people felt that Ye Yuan was overwhelming others with his influence, and he was actually scared of Crimsonsky.

Crimsonsky was different from them. Even though he was just First Firmament Empyrean, he was a genuine Ancestor Realm powerhouse.

Who was stronger among the two was really hard to say.

Ye Yuan was afraid of losing the face of Second Sage. That was why he did not dare to take action.

Yet, Crimsonsky himself even slammed onto the spearhead, selling himself with the first sentence he said when he ran in.

Ye Yuan would not care about what these people thought, directly leaving with his hands behind his back.

“Looking at what? Never seen before others repenting in front of the Sacred Ancestor? Scram!”

In the plaza, Crimsonsky’s roars transmitted over from time to time.

... ...

Ye Yuan ignored what Crimsonsky was thinking. He still had an objective of coming to this Westspirit Region, which was to search for some spirit medicines to refine pills to break through the bottleneck of late Origin Pill Realm.

Reaching Origin Pill Realm, Ye Yuan finally realized how horrifying the cultivation method he cultivated was.

Now, with each minor realm that he broke through, the spiritual energy required was virtually several times of the same rank.

One had to know, True God Realm cultivation was easily calculated with tens of thousands of years. Several times of this was several tens of thousands of years of spiritual energy.

This massive amount of spiritual energy, even if Ye Yuan had the help of medicinal pills, the advancement speed was also extremely slow.

In the past, he could break through a minor realm in 10 years to 20 years. Now, he needed at least several decades or even 100 years before he could do it. This was still after Ye Yuan swallowed no idea how many top grade medicinal pills before he had this speed.

Otherwise, with the spiritual energy quantity of Origin Pill Realm, ordinary martial artists might not be able to break through a minor realm in 100 thousand years too. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan reached peak Sixth Firmament Origin Pill a few years back. It was just that the medicinal pills in his hands were all consumed entirely during his way to the land of extreme north. It was still a step away before he could break through the bottleneck.

The Demon Divine Pill Convention this time, it naturally could not do without all kinds of spirit medicines. Ye Yuan naturally could not make this trip in vain.

“Young Master, you’re really too incredible, to actually even become the demon race’s Second Sage! You don’t know, the Northernmost Steppe’s demons are ferocious. But they are so docile in front of you.” Lu-er followed by Ye Yuan’s side with an idolizing look.

Loneswan and Yang Fei-er followed behind the two people, with their expressions and emotions being complicated.

Yang Fei-er followed Ye Yuan this half a year. Under the assistance of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills, she already broke through to be a Ninth Firmament True God.

This kind of cultivation speed, she did not even dare to think about it in the past.

While Lu-er having obtained Ye Yuan’s help, her cultivation speed was even more terrifying.

Yang Fei-er practically saw Lu-er every day and discovered that her aura was growing non-stop. It was simply too monstrous.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “Silly lass, do you think that Second Sage is so easy to be? Right now, no idea how many people staring at me in this Demon Divine Region!”

Lu-er smiled and said, “I don’t care, either way, Young Master is the most impressive!”

The few people were currently chatting when they brushed past a group of men and women.

Suddenly, a red-haired and barebacked youth in the front furrowed his brows, and he turned around to look at Ye Yuan.
