Chapter 2319: Powerful Originguard!

“Yuan Xiu, Yuan Shi, the two of you lead two teams of abyss monsters to deal with that brat. Don’t think about capturing him. You guys can’t capture him. Just directly kill him!” Originguard looked in Ye Yuan’s direction and said coolly.

Yuan Xiu and Yuan Shi were two middle-stage Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses. The two small squads of abyss monsters that they brought were shockingly middle-stage Heavenly Emperor Realm too.

When the human powerhouses saw this line-up, each and every one of them was stunned.

These two squads could sweep away any Heavenly Emperor powerhouse already, but they were deployed to deal with the initial-stage Heavenly Emperor Ye Yuan.

It could be seen from this how highly Originguard regarded Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, his figure swaying, suddenly disappearing from where he was.

When he appeared again, he already arrived outside Cloudheart Mountain.

Amidst the chaotic battle, Yun Yi, Ning Siyu, and the rest were currently being besieged by the abyss monsters.

What surprised Ye Yuan was that the ones currently guarding by Yun Yi two people’s sides were Empyrean Pilljade and Empyrean Flutterfeather.

Especially Empyrean Pilljade, he was covered in blood all over, with his aura being weak. He had already received severe injuries.

And beside him, there were still quite a number of peak Empyrean abyss monsters.

Of course, Flutterfeather was also not much better than him.

The moment Ye Yuan appeared, there were immediately Heavenly Emperor Realm abyss monsters that charged over.

He did not hesitate in the slightest, sword intent surging, instantly one-shotting several Heavenly Emperor abyss monsters.

More than a dozen streaks of sword energy suddenly descended. Those abyss monsters besieging Yun Yi and the rest were instantly sliced into countless pieces.

Whoosh, whoosh!

Several medicinal pills flew toward Flutterfeather and Pilljade.

When the two saw Ye Yuan, they immediately saw the dawn of hope.

Without the least bit of hesitation, they swallowed the medicinal pills that Ye Yuan tossed over.

The effects were instantly seen!

Suddenly, Empyrean Pilljade’s entire body trembled, the Heavenly Emperor Realm that had blocked him for many years finally loosened at this moment!

What Ye Yuan gave him to eat was not the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill, it was just an ordinary healing medicinal pill.

But this medicinal pill was a spiritlink divine pill!

Empyrean Pilljade knew that he was half a step away from Heavenly Emperor to begin with. Under the catalysis of the Dao accumulations inside the spiritlink divine pill, he finally broke the fetters and broke through to Heavenly Emperor!

Ye Yuan’s fingertips moved, instantly forming a formation, protecting Yun Yi and the rest inside the array formation.

“You guys wait inside the grand array! Don’t go anywhere!”

Ye Yuan dropped these few words coolly while his figure turning around, and he met with the two squads led by Yuan Xiu and Yuan Shi.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

A thousand flying swords suddenly appeared, sweeping toward the two squads.

These two squads had a total of more than 20 middle-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

Furthermore, they were not human race powerhouses, but divine race and abyss monsters.

This combat power was significantly stronger than 20 over Fourth Firmament Heavenly Emperors.

However, after Ye Yuan broke through to World Realm, how much stronger was the power of his sword formation?

He maneuvered the sword formation and could actually withstand the attacks of the two squads!

It was just a shame that these over 20 people were seriously too strong. Under their teaming up, the sword formation was in imminent danger.

Seeing this scene, the human powerhouses were all dumbfounded with amazement.

Ye Yuan actually blocked so many divine race members and abyss monsters by himself. Was this guy still human?

Previously, they all looked down on the divine race and felt that the abyss monsters were ugly and lowly. But after exchanging blows now, they were deeply aware of these two mighty race’s power!

One on one was simply an extravagant hope.

But Ye Yuan jumped realms and blocked so many powerhouses. This was too shocking.

While at this time, they also deeply realized why Originguard regarded Ye Yuan so highly.

This guy was much more monstrous than even the race chosen by heaven, the divine race!

“Manpower is so tight. Yet Progenitor Originguard still let us form two squads to come and kill him. I was still very disdainful about this previously. Now, this Ye Yuan really broadened my horizons!” Yuan Xiu said in shock.

“Really too strong! No wonder after Divine Son returned, he entered the Megadeath Cave without a word. Looks like he was really triggered!” Yuan Shi said.

“Hold steady first. Don’t be in a rush to kill him! After the lord got the opportunity, it won’t be late to kill him then.” Yuan Xiu said.

Yuan Shi nodded his head, deeply feeling that way too.

Ye Yuan making a move shocked everyone.

... ...

Originguard looked in Ye Yuan’s direction and clicked his tongue in wonder as he praised, “This kid is really strong! I don’t know how he cultivates up till now. A mere human actually cultivated to such a realm. This is truly astonishing! If he’s given another 5000 years, I’m afraid that my divine race will have to turtle up inside the Abyss World forever!”

Ye Yuan’s combat power made people sigh with admiration.

If not for Nineorigin being beaten until that state, Originguard would never have believed that the human race actually produced such a monstrous freak.

The race chosen by heaven was actually beaten by a human!

When Medicine Ancestor saw Ye Yuan’s combat strength, his eyes also revealed a look of astonishment.

“Divine race is it? Truly a surprising race! This ancestor wants to see how much capability you have!”

Medicine Ancestor’s gaze turned dark, an earthshaking imposing aura surged to the sky.

Originguard smiled faintly and said, “You alone isn’t enough. The two of you attack together!”

Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest were the two strongest people among the humans present; both Deva Fourth Blight supreme powerhouses[1].

Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest exchanged a glance, and actually reached a rare unanimous conclusion.

Rumble!

Medicine Ancestor pushed a palm out, heaven and earth instantly changed colors.

The incredibly strong source power gushed out of his palm.

Cloudheart Mountain instantly turned to ashes at this moment!

The spiritual veins were severed, mountains and rivers shattering. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The seemingly played-down palm had the power to destroy heaven and decimate the earth.

This was the power of a Deva Fourth Blight supreme powerhouse!

At the same time, Wing also threw a punch out.

Space was like glass, countless cracks instantly fissuring apart.

The entire Cloudheart Realm started trembling.

Horrifying energy undulations scattered everywhere, anything that came into the slightest contact with it, instantly turned to ashes!

Great Dao was simple!

These two supreme powerhouses did not have any flashy martial technique, but the moment they took action, it obliterated the heaven and destroyed the earth.

Cloudheart Realm was singlehandedly founded by Medicine Ancestor, this realm was extremely sturdy.

But under the power of such powerhouses, it could not stand up to a single blow at all.

The Ye Yuan in the midst of fierce fighting also felt shocked. No wonder it could be called Doomsday Battle.

The fight of such powerhouses was simply too terrifying.

If a bunch of such powerhouses fought, even the Heavenspan World would also be fought until it broke to pieces.

Outside Cloudheart Mountain, powerhouses were fleeing one after another. How could they still care about fighting?

Opposite of them, Originguard beamed and said, “Not bad, not bad. Alchemy Dao can’t make it, but Martial Dao is worth seeing. It’s just a shame that who you guys are facing is this ancestor!”

Done talking, the Dao marks on his body released a breathtaking blue light.

A Great Dao aura that towered above all life suddenly erupted.

This eruption actually suppressed both great Deva Fourth Blight powerhouses with his strength alone!

“Detonate!”

Originguard bellowed, the void exploded!

A huge amount of energy exploded together with Medicine Ancestor two people.

Except, this explosive force was too strong, and actually overshadowed the two great Deva Fourth Blight powerhouses

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

The two supreme powerhouses tasted sweetness in their throats and actually spewed fresh blood wildly.

The divine race’s ancestor actually overwhelmed two great Deva Fourth Blights with his power alone!

This scene was too shocking.

A feeling of despair spread in the hearts of all the human powerhouses.

[1] Yeah, I know, Sacred Ancestor is from the demon race, but the raw text just says human.
