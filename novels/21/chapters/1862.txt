Chapter 1866: Great Destiny

Everything was as a matter of course. It was as if all this was prepared for Ye Yuan.

No matter looking from which angle, climbing up to the sky to pluck the blood, this sort of thing, was an extremely dangerous thing. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

But Ye Yuan did it so calmly.

That appearance was like walking one round in his own backyard.

“You refine it here. I’ll stand guard over you. Nobody should come over to this place anymore.”

Ye Yuan handed the Vermilion Bird true blood to Leng Qiuling, but Leng Qiuling did not take it.

“This ... you’re really giving it to me?” Leng Qiuling’s eyes carried some doubt.

Not that she was suspicious, but that this kind of massive lucky chance was what even peak True God powerhouses were moved by. But Ye Yuan gave it to her without the slightest hesitation.

This kind of thing, anyone would feel like they were dreaming.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How can the relationship between friends be what a drop of true blood can replace? That day, if not for you speaking up to stop it in the Leng Family, this Ye would have many more troubles appear out of thin air. This drop of true blood, give to you.”

“B-But this is too valuable.”

With the treasure being in front of her, it would be false if Leng Qiuling said that she was unmoved. But this Vermilion Bird true blood was really quite a hot potato.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How can an Empyrean’s abode possibly just have this bit of Vermilion Bird true blood? The real treasures are all inside the abode. This Vermilion Bird true blood might not be considered very valuable.”

...

This refinement took three months’ time.

On this day, in the oasis, a scorching light shot to the sky.

An enormous Vermilion Bird phantom formed behind Leng Qiuling.

Her aura was also much stronger than before and actually already stepped into Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity.

“Huhu, congratulations! From today onwards, ice and fire laws fusing, Miss Leng’s strength will increase greatly! The title of Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital’s number one genius will likely change owners very soon.”

Leng Qiuling slowly opened her eyes, Ye Yuan’s voice transmitted into her ears.

Leng Qiuling was just about to answer when her gaze turned sharp, a hint of surprise flashing across her eyes.

Unknowingly, Ye Yuan also actually broke through to become a Third Firmament Celestial Deity already.

“Didn’t you break through too?” A hint of a bitter smile flashed across the corners of Leng Qiuling’s mouth.

She thought that by obtaining the Vermilion Bird true blood, she would suppress Ye Yuan for some time. She did not expect that within a short three months, Ye Yuan similarly broke through his realm.

Could it be that this guy had no bottlenecks?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Vermilion Bird true blood’s vital energy is too beneficial. I also suffered a considerable impact by the side and actually found the opportunity to break through just like that. Alright, it’s getting late, we should head out. Opening up the Empyrean abode still needs to borrow the power of your Vermilion Bird true blood.”

Leng Qiuling nodded her head slightly and followed Ye Yuan, heading toward the exit together.

When they returned to the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range, that valley was already packed full of martial artists.

“Tsk tsk, that Xu Xing is really remarkable, to actually obtain the White Tiger true blood! His strength is formidable to begin with. Now, among the junior generation, nobody is his match at all.”

“Isn’t that so? Heard that a kid called Ye Yuan actually dared to snatch away his woman, really tired of living!”

“Heh, to talk about this Ye Yuan, that isn’t some nice guy either! Inside the Door of Vermilion Bird, Ye Yuan killed Heavenly Water City Lord Ji Xun’s disciple in front of his face. Putting aside that Ye Yuan’s strength is fearsome, his gall is also unbelievably fat! However, Ji Xun obtained the Vermilion Bird true blood, so that kid will likely suffer a disaster.”

“There’s still such a thing? Then this kid really took the road to ruin! No matter how talented he is, he’s also merely a Second Firmament Celestial Deity. In front of Xu Xing and Ji Xun, he’s akin to an ant.”

...

At this time, the general situation had already settled down. Everyone was discussing the ownership issue of the Four Symbols true blood this time.

Several wisps of discussing sounds floated into Leng Qiuling and Ye Yuan’s ears.

Leng Qiuling’s brows furrowed. She did not think that Xu Xing actually obtained the White Tiger true blood.

She knew how difficult it was to obtain the true blood from the hands of a group of True God powerhouses.

This Xu Xing was truly a proud son of heaven, his destiny exuberant!

Suddenly, a dark shadow arrived with a howl. The powerful aura immediately enveloped Ye Yuan two people.

“DIE!”

On the Thousand Soar Alliance’s side, Gu Tianque’s expression suddenly changed, attacking fiercely at the same time.

Bang!

In an intense clash, Gu Tianque was actually struck until he fell back repeatedly.

“Ji Xun, what’s the meaning of this?” Gu Tianque said in a solemn voice.

This dark shadow was none other than precisely the Ji Xun who just came out of the Door of Vermilion Bird.

At this time, Ji Xun’s aura was much more gloomier and colder compared to before, virtually able to freeze people.

“Gu Tianque, I only want this boy’s life, it has nothing to do with you! If you don’t move, I’ll kill you too!” Ji Xun said in a cold voice.

Gu Tianque was greatly enraged when he heard that and said, “Want to kill me? With just the likes of you?”

Ji Xun released his aura. The terrifying aura spread out, making Gu Tianque’s pupils shrink.

This Ji Xun seemed to be different.

“You can try!” Ji Xun said in a cold voice.

At this time, Ji Kang suddenly stepped forward and said, “Alright, everyone is about to enter the Empyrean abode, the real treasure should all be hidden there. Two great True God powerhouses having an internal strife here isn’t some good thing. Give me face, put aside whatever grudge there is. It won’t be too late to kill people after leaving this Empyrean abode.”

Ji Xun’s expression changed several times and he snorted coldly and said, “Fine, I’ll give you face! Gu Tianque, after going out, if you still dare to protect this little animal, I’ll definitely kill you! If you don’t believe it, you can give it a try!”

Gu Tianque snorted coldly and said, “Impervious to reason!”

Actually, he was extremely shocked in his heart. Exchanging a blow just now, Ji Xun’s strength seemed to be much stronger than before.

But in this place, everyone suppressed their cultivation realms. Just how one’s strength was, one could only know after going out.

Ji Kang smiled and said, “Huhu, Ji Kang heard that you obtained the Vermilion Bird true blood. Come, the other three people are already in position. You guys open up the Empyrean abode!”

Hearing this, Ji Xun’s expression became even uglier as he said in a solemn voice, “I didn’t get the Vermilion Bird true blood!”

Ji Kang’s smile turned stiff on his face and he said in surprise, “You didn’t obtain it? Then who got it?”

Ji Xun’s unfriendly gaze looked toward Leng Qiuling.

“Heh, if a snipe and a clam are locked in a fight, it’s only to the advantage of the fisherman! I didn’t expect that in the end, it actually let this girlie become the fisherman!”

Everyone’s gazes looked over toward Leng Qiuling, all incomparably surprised.

Only then did Gu Tianque also pay attention to this disciple of his at this time, she actually already broke through to become a Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity!

Beyond the shock, he was pleasantly surprised.

“Haha, Ling-er, you really obtained the Vermilion Bird true blood?” Gu Tianque said with a big laugh.

Leng Qiuling nodded her head, counted as acquiescing to it.

When Xu Xing heard this news, he also laughed loudly as he said, “Huhu, it’s really great! Junior Apprentice Sister Qiuling, you and I are both people of great destiny! It’s impossible for you and that ant beside you to get together! The gap between you guys will only get bigger and bigger! Come, let’s go open up the abode!”

He felt that him acquiring the White Tiger true blood and Leng Qiuling obtaining the Vermilion Bird true blood could already shake off all of the young generation.

In the future, even stepping into the realm of Empyrean was also not impossible.

Ye Yuan was naturally even less worthy of Leng Qiuling.

“Great destiny? Senior Apprentice Brother Xu, I think that you’re mistaken. The one who possesses a great destiny isn’t me, but Ye Yuan. This Vermilion Bird true blood was given to me by him,” Leng Qiuling shook her head and explained.
