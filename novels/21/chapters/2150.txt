Chapter 2154: Branch

After the pill was formed, Long Xiaochun broke through the next day.

Following that, Ye Yuan and Long Xiaochun followed Ao Xu and left the Raindragon Stronghold.

Ye Yuan did not wish to take part in whatever Battle of Dragon Sons, more than a hundred years had already passed since he made this trip to save Lu-er. He was somewhat worried about Heavenly Eagle in his heart and planned on preparing to leave after staying for a few days.

But he could not withstand Long Xiaochun’s hard and soft tactics as well as Long Xiyue’s earnest hopes, so he set off with a half-reluctant attitude.

“Huhu, Dragon Son Ye is truly a peerless talent, to actually cultivate to the realm of Empyrean at this age. You’ll surely be able to enter the Heavenly Dragon Mountain in the future,” Ao Xu said with a laugh.

He was very humble and polite along the way and did not have any airs of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

However, he had long already had killing intent aroused toward Ye Yuan.

From Long Chi’s mouth, Ao Xu already knew how monstrous Ye Yuan was.

If such a monster grew up, he would pose a tremendous threat to Dragon Son Ao Yu.

This threat absolutely could not stay!

Ao Yu was precisely Purpledragon Stronghold’s Son of the Heavenly Dragon, and he was also Ao Xu’s nephew.

Hence, even if Long Chi did not pay the price, he would kill Ye Yuan too, disposing of this hidden danger while it was in a budding state.

“Senior is too kind. This Ye was merely a little lucky,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Long Xiaochun rolled her eyes and said, “You’re really hypocritical! Clearly very impressive yourself, yet, feigning an unimpressive appearance! Your Dragon Beard Purpleshine Pill is really too incredible. The Seven-star priests in the stronghold are simply laymen when compared to you!”

Ao Xu was alarmed in his heart. This kid even knew how to refine pills. Furthermore, he was very formidable?

No wonder Long Xiaochun broke through so quickly. It turned out that it was actually due to the medicinal pill.

Ao Xu knew that Long Xiaochun was very lazy in cultivation and it was completely impossible to be Ao Yu’s match, so he paid no attention to it.

He did not expect that when he came this time, Long Xiaochun actually broke through overnight, making his jaw drop.

This way, Long Xiaochun also became a formidable enemy of Ao Yu.

Ye Yuan could not help being speechless when he heard it. He was being modest. How did it become hypocritical when it reached Long Xiaochun’s mouth?

He could not have people praise him and he put on a straight face and say that he was very impressive, right?

How to let people follow up with this!

Except, he did not know that these words strengthened Ao Xu’s killing intent even more.

The three people moved extremely fast. Half a month later, they arrived at an area of high mountains and lofty peaks.

“The two of you, this place is a forked-road. This emperor still has to make a trip to Southhope Stronghold and receive the Son of the Heavenly Dragon, Long Zheng, to the Purpledragon Stronghold. You guys travel too slowly, I’ll have to trouble you two to wait here for a few days. The latest by half a month, this Emperor will definitely catch up,” Ao Xu clasped his hands and said.

Long Xiaochun’s thoughts were pure and did not suspect anything. Waving her hand, she said, “Go on, go on, we’ll wait for you.”

Ao Xu smiled slightly, figure moving, and disappeared.

After Ao Xu left, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly but became alert.

“Hey! Are you mistaken? You even made it through the Dragon Eye Cave, but this wilderness is scaring you?” Long Xiaochun snickered.

Ye Yuan frowned and said in a solemn voice, “Better an open enemy than a false friend, an open foe may prove a curse but a pretend friend is even worse! The spatial structure here is very unstable. Once one hides in a spatial rift, it will be like a fish entering the sea. We will be unable to find those spatial rifts at all. Of course, this place is also the ideal place for an ambush!”

Long Xiaochun laughed and said, “My Big Brother Ye Yuan, are you being overly cautious? This place is East Suppression Pseudo World. Who dares to ambush us in my noble Dragon Clan’s territory?”

Clearly, Long Xiaochun did not take Ye Yuan’s cautiousness to heart at all.

But Ye Yuan had journeyed north and south, and had gone to no idea how many places before and experienced how many massacres before. He naturally would not be as pure as Long Xiaochun.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “This place isn’t advisable to stay for too long. We’d better hurry up and leave.”

Long Xiaochun said, “Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu asked us to wait here for him, if we were to go, how would he find us?”

Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and said with a cold smile, “I’m afraid that he doesn’t have good intentions too!”

Originally, Ye Yuan did not have any suspicions towards Ao Xu either. But Ao Xu’s words just now had too many suspicious points!

Travel slow?

Forked road?

Would bringing two Empyreans on the journey really delay a lot of time?

Furthermore, this forked road was a little too coincidental, right?

Instinct told him that this place was not safe!

The more he thought, the more Ye Yuan felt that this was a scheme, a plot specifically to kill the two of them!

Long Xiaochun felt that Ye Yuan was rather abnormal and said unhappily, “Ye Yuan, you’re too sensitive! Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu doesn’t put on any airs at all. Along the way, he also took extra care of us. How can he possibly harm us?”

Ye Yuan could not help being speechless. This lass was too pure and did not know the viciousness of the human heart at all!

He did not believe that this East Suppression Pseudo World was a pure land without strife.

Although Ye Yuan did not know why Ao Xu would make a move against him, this place being very dangerous was certainly without a doubt.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “You’re not going?”

“I’m not going! Want to go, you go!” Long Xiaochun said stubbornly.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Forget it, I want to see just what tricks Ao Xu can play!”

He did not believe that Ao Xu dared to act against the two of them in a flagrant manner.

After all, Ao Xu was a receiving envoy, if the two of them died in Ao Xu’s hands, he would have to be buried in death himself too.

Long Xiaochun had a disdainful look as she said, “Ye Yuan, I’ve misjudged you! You’re projecting your own shortcomings onto others! Not every one is as black-hearted as you.”

Ye Yuan smiled and paid no heed to it. Landing among the mountains, he found a place to rest.

The way each person saw the world was different. Long Xiaochun’s thoughts were simple and naturally felt that this world was very simple.

Didn’t Ye Yuan like this little sister because of this too?

Loyal to friends, simple thoughts, having dealings with such a person took no effort at all.

Ye Yuan did not haggle over it. Rather, Long Xiaochun was unrelenting and chased after Ye Yuan angrily and said, “Humph! I really couldn’t tell that you were such a person! Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu has no grudge nor enmity with us. He is also very kind. So what reason does he have to harm us ...”

Got to admit, Ao Xu pretended very well along the way. Even Ye Yuan was deceived, let alone talk about Long Xiaochun.

Ao Xu’s ripe old age was not lived in vain in the end.

Even Ye Yuan also did not detect the killing intent in his heart.

Along the way, Ao Xu was not overly close to the two, but he also did not put on the airs of a Heavenly Emperor.

Answering every question, helping with every problem.

Everything was expressed too normally.

He looked just like a kind and gentle grandpa.

If not for the reason just now being somewhat shoddy, coupled with that he was extremely sensitive to space, he probably would not discover the danger yet.

“Talk! Say something! Being speechless, do you think that what I said makes sense? Humph! Half a month later, when Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu comes, see what face you still have to meet him!” Long Xiaochun said angrily.

However, what Long Xiaochun did not expect was that Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu did not come. Instead, a bunch of ferocious and sinister bandits came.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
