Chapter 1067: Sun Man’s Proposal

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The old man’s words made everyone fall into despair.

An array formation that even Deity Realm powerhouses could not break, how could they all, these people, possibly crack it? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Dao Spirit Fruit that could help them break through to the Deity Realm was placed before their eyes, and they actually could not reach it. Nothing was more tormenting than this.

“Master Ding, you’re a formations path master. Can you lead us to break through the grand array?” Somebody asked.

This old man was none other than precisely the Heavenly Dawn Palace’s formations path master, Ding Zhanguo.

After the Heavenly Dawn Palace’s people left Ye Yuan and his group, they went all the way deep in. When the essence energy here surged, they also rushed over right away.

When Ding Zhanguo saw this grand array, he had a look of despair at that time as well.

Ding Zhanguo shook his head when he heard that and said, “If divine rank array formations were so easy to crack, what did this old man come to find what Dao Spirit Fruit for?”

Hearing his words, everyone had even more hopeless looks.

They all looked at the Dao Spirit Fruit overflowing with essence energy, their hearts like being scratched by cats, abnormally itchy and hard to bear.

“Could it be ... Could it be that we can only watch blankly like this? That ... That is a Dao Spirit Fruit!” Someone said with unwillingness in their heart.

This kind of situation, no one would be willing either.

Deity Realm, this was countless martial artists’ lifelong pursuit for 100 thousand years.

Within easy reach, but while right under their noses, was far away at the horizon!

In the crowd, Ao Qian asked Ye Yuan softly, “Milord, is that really a Dao Spirit Fruit?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly and said, “Indeed exactly the same as a Dao Spirit Fruit. It’s just that ... I keep feeling that something is not quite right. If this place has a Dao Spirit Tree, it’s impossible that Father didn’t bring me over to have a look back then. Moreover, the Medicine King Hall was shut for 20 years, and Sun Man had never appeared before. His sudden appearance this time also makes me feel rather odd. Also, that black-clothed person is definitely not an ordinary person! I keep feeling that I’ve seen him before somewhere.”

The Dao Spirit Tree was a heaven and earth spiritual plant. It was born as a divine rank spiritual object and was incomparably rare.

If the Dao Spirit Plant was sealed inside the Heaven Burning Annihilation Chaos Grand Array, there would not be any danger at all. With Ji Zhengyang’s strength, he could totally bring him over and experience it.

But Ji Zhengyang did not!

“Milord, could it be that you’re thinking too much? A divine rank spirit medicine coming into being, the Medicine King Hall is likely unable to stay calm either, right? Moreover, the Dao Spirit Fruit’s undulations that surpasses Tier 9, it shouldn’t be fake, right?” Jiang Taicang said.

“Yeah, Milord, This essence energy undulation absolutely surpasses Tier 9. It’s also no different from the legendary Dao Spirit Fruit’s aura. Shouldn’t ... have any problem, right?” Ao Qian also said.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “I hope so.”

Ye Yuan’s heart realm breaking through to Heaven Man Unity, he more or less had some inferences toward many things in the unseen world.

He kept feeling that his concern was not groundless.

Just as Ye Yuan was wavering hesitantly, Sun Man suddenly rose up into the air and said in a clear voice, “Everyone, since you’ve already arrived here, how can there be the logic of entering a treasure mountain and returning empty-handed? This Sun has a proposal, I wonder if everyone is willing or not?”

Sun Man’s words immediately aroused everyone’s attention.

Hearing the meaning in these words, Sun Man had a way of dealing with this divine rank grand array!

At present, everyone was currently in the midst of despair. Suddenly hearing that there was a way, how could they be unwilling?

“What method does Hall Master Sun have? Just feel free to say it!”

“Yeah, Hall Master Sun. The chance to achieve Deity Realm is right before our eyes. We can’t just give up like this, right?”

These martial artists could not wait to listen to Sun Man’s method. Even Ding Zhanguo did not have any means, at this time, there was only making a Hail Mary effort.

Sun Man sneered coldly in his heart: just the likes of you fools also wish to achieve Deity Realm?

But he naturally could not bring it out on the surface. He just slowly said, “Master Ding is a formations path great master second only to the Grand Yan Divine King in the Divine Realm. Although this grand array is an ancient divine rank grand array, I feel that he should be able to see through where this array formation’s vulnerable area lies. Since we can’t pass through this array formation, why not everybody joins forces and break this grand array together! We have so many people here, even a divine rank grand array probably can’t withstand so many of our attacks too!”

Following Sun Man saying finish, the crowd burst into an uproar all of a sudden. They felt that Sun Man’s proposal was truly brilliant and immediately echoed voices of assent.

“Yeah, we probably have 100 thousand martial artists here. If we’re of one heart and join forces, the power is extremely terrifying. Perhaps we really can break this grand array!”

“Hall Master Sun’s suggestion is really too reliable! 100 thousand martial artists, among which even have quite a few Void Mystic Realm powerhouses, I don’t believe that it can’t break the grand array!”

“Hall Master Sun, how about this, you take command, we’ll all listen to you!”

Sun Man made a hand gesture, making everyone shush, and said in a clear voice, “I wonder what are the opinions of the fellow Void Mystic Realms?”

Ding Zhanguo and Shu Yunqing exchanged a glance, and both nodded their heads. Ding Zhanguo said in a clear voice, “This elderly self has no objections!”

“I have no objections!” Sword Thirteen also voiced out.

“I have no objections either!”

He Dajiang also spoke up at an appropriate time. His injuries finally recovered a little through a period of recuperating. But his current state was even worse than Shu Yunqing’s.

“No objections!” Cao Tianyou who appeared before everyone’s eyes for the first time also spoke up.

“...”

Right on the heels of that, one voice after another sounded out. They did not have any objections towards Sun Man’s proposal.

Counting it, the Void Mystic Realm experts were actually as many as 13 people!

Close to half of the people among them did not reveal themselves in front of people after entering the Immemorial Medicine Garden.

At present, it seemed like apart from Sun Man’s suggestion, there was no other path that could be taken.

These Void Mystic powerhouses asked for nothing else. Their only pursuit was the Dao Spirit Fruit. Letting them leave at this point, that was impossible.

When the other martial artists heard all of these Void Mystic Realm powerhouses agree, they immediately felt the pressure on their bodies surmount.

Without a doubt, these Void Mystic Realm powerhouses were the strongest competitors for the Dao Spirit Fruit!

But the temptation of the Dao Spirit Fruit was seriously too great. They were unable to refuse at all. Furthermore, who knew that they could or could not obtain the Dao Spirit Fruit?

Before the Spirit Bristle Divine King acquired the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art, who knew him?

Among the martial artists present, there were quite a few Divine King Realm experts. There were even many peak Divine King powerhouses.

These people were also just a step away from the Void Mystic Realm. How could they be willing to give up on the Dao Spirit Fruit?

Quite a few of them already made the decision in their hearts, once they caught the Dao Spirit Fruit, they would swallow it at all costs!

As long as they could escape and find a place to enter closed-seclusion, when they came out again, they would be able to sweep across the Divine Realm!

This sort of temptation, nobody could resist it!

Sun Man nodded his head, very satisfied with these people’s replies.

But finally, he turned his gaze to Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Qingyun, the others have all agreed. What about you?”

This sentence drew everyone’s gaze toward Ye Yuan. Only then did they recall that Ye Yuan brought along two Void Mystic Realm powerhouses.

As for Ao Qian, they were still unaware that he had already broken through to Void Mystic.

Under everyone’s gazes, Ye Yuan mused for a moment, but said coolly, “We ... withdraw!”
