Chapter 2106: Unrelenting

A palm attacked, carrying the power to crush heaven and earth.

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, unperturbed and fearless.

Just as everyone thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure, a figure manifested itself.

Xin Luo took a step out of the void and caught Qi Chen’s palm, saying with a smile, “Huhu, Brother Qi Chen please calm your anger.”

The powerhouses in the city were suddenly enlightened. No wonder Ye Yuan dared to be so arrogant. It turned out that his backer was this strong.

With Qi Chen being blocked, his brows could not help furrowing. He said in a solemn voice, “Xin Luo, what’s the meaning of this?”

Xin Luo gave Ye Yuan a meaningful glance, thinking to himself that this boy was too cunning. He had probably long known that they were watching the show, so he simply did not move, forcing them to come out.

They all were dissatisfied with Ye Yuan and all wanted to watch Ye Yuan suffer a loss.

But Ye Yuan was cool as a cucumber under Qi Chen’s pressure and did not have any appearance of being in a tight corner.

“Brother Qi Chen, he can’t be touched!” Xin Luo said in a grave manner.

“Humph! Merely a human brat who stole a demon bloodline. Why can’t he be touched?” Qi Chen said with a cold snort.

“Brother Qi Chen has just come into being and might be unaware, but this ... is the Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred!” Xin Luo said helplessly.

Qi Chen’s face changed, looking at Ye Yuan with a stupefied look.

When the martial artists in the city heard this, each and every one of them was incredibly shocked.

“What? He’s the legendary Second Sage? This ... He is also too young, right?”

“Really blinded my dog eyes! Why would Second Sage be a human? Furthermore, he is only at the True God Realm?”

“What capability does this boy have, to dare be called Second Sage? Is Sacred Ancestor High Priest cracking a joke with us?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

... ...

Qi Chen naturally understood what Second Sage meant. It was just that his face was full of disbelief as he said, “Huhu, is Brother Xin Luo joking around with this Empyrean? What kind of existence is Sacred Ancestor High Priest? Why would he confer a human True God Realm as Second Sage?”

Xin Luo smiled bitterly and said, “When this Empyrean first met Second Sage, I had the same idea as you. But how can Xin Luo dare to joke around with the name of the Sacred Ancestor High Priest? This is indeed our demon race’s newly established Second Sage! Furthermore, Lord Second Sage’s alchemy strength, we have also witnessed it before and are wholeheartedly convinced!”

Qi Chen naturally understood in his heart that Xin Luo would not joke about this kind of thing.

But this matter was a little too inconceivable.

If he was really Second Sage, he really could not do anything to Ye Yuan.

Although he was powerful, he was still far too lacking from the Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s level.

Although the Qilin Clan did not fear Sacred Ancestor High Priest, it was still not worthwhile to lose all decorum with Sacred Ancestor High Priest for a treasure.

“Humph! Even if this is the case, he stole my Qilin Clan’s bloodline and took possession of my Qilin Clan’s treasure. He even injured a member of my Qilin Clan. Could it be that it’s dropped just like this?” Qi Chen said in a solemn voice.

“This ...” Xin Luo could not help having an awkward look.

This matter was originally you all making trouble out of nothing, alright? Now, you’re even going from bad to worse.

The Qilin Clan had not come into being for a long time and really did not know about the ways of the world at all.

The treasure that people obtained, that was naturally theirs. How was it your Qilin Clan’s?

Sure enough, Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Do you still want face, old thing? Fine, since you want the treasure, I’ll give it to you right now! But I want to see if your family’s ancestor will acknowledge you, this unfilial grandson or not!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan flipped his hand over, a crystal clear jade bone was already held in his hand. It was precisely the Qilin emperor bone.

The moment the emperor emerged, an archaic power immediately filled the world.

Inclusive of Xin Luo, everyone opened their eyes wide, staring fixedly at the emperor bone in Ye Yuan’s hand.

The Qilin Clan’s people even trembled all over, as if all the bloodline power in his bodies were ignited.

The powerhouses in the city all revealed heated gazes. They were clearly moved by the Qilin emperor bone.

If not for there being so many Empyrean powerhouses present holding the line, the city would probably have already become a deathmatch pit at this time.

“Qilin ... emperor bone!” Qi Chen practically squeezed these few words from the crevices between his teeth, his gaze full of intense heat.

How could Ye Yuan not understand these people’s gazes? But he did not pay any attention.

The emperor bone was spiritual. He only obtained the emperor bone’s recognition after going through all kinds of hardships and difficulties.

Even if Qi Chen killed him right now, he also could not bring away the Qilin emperor bone at all.

Amidst everyone’s stupefied gazes, Ye Yuan casually threw and tossed the emperor bone to Qi Chen.

Qi Chen’s gaze turned sharp, stepped into the void, attempting to grab the emperor bone in his hand.

However, just as he was about to grab the emperor bone, a blazing white light suddenly erupted from within the emperor bone.

Qi Chen was caught off-guard, his entire person akin to being struck by a heavy blow, figure flying out backward. A mouthful of fresh blood spurted out wildly, already suffering heavy wounds.

Then, the emperor bone flew one round in the air and returned to Ye Yuan’s hand again.

Even when Ye Yuan saw this scene, he was somewhat astounded too.

Initially, when Jian Sutao attempted to seize the emperor bone, he was also merely burned by the emperor bone, that was all.

Ye Yuan did not expect that the Qilin emperor bone was actually even more ruthless toward its own descendants.

But he also understood that the Qilin emperor bone was standing up for him.

“Impossible! This is impossible! How can the Qilin emperor bone acknowledge an outsider as its master? You ... Just what method did you use?” Qi Chen ignored his injuries and pointed at Ye Yuan as he roared.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I said long ago, the treasures of the world had their own regulations and laws and can’t be compelled. If it’s yours, others can’t snatch it away. If not yours, you can’t keep it! You only know that I obtained the treasure, but you don’t know what I paid for the treasure. But you pledged in all solemnity here, saying that the treasure is owned by your Qilin Clan? Truly ridiculous and laughable!”

Seeing this scene, those originally heated gazes gradually withdrew.

Since the Qilin emperor bone already acknowledged a master, no matter how hard others worked, it was also useless.

Even if they killed Ye Yuan, they also could not get the Qilin emperor bone’s recognition. It was also impossible for them to bring it away.

It was also precisely because of this that Ye Yuan dared to take it out.

Qi You smiled bitterly and said, “No wonder his Qilin bloodline is so thick, and he even awakened an innate divine ability! It turns out that he actually obtained the Qilin emperor bone’s recognition.”

By the side, Qi Yun already woke up and said in a solemn voice, “Even if there’s the emperor bone’s recognition, for him to be able to awaken an innate divine ability at this age, his talent already surpasses the vast majority of the clan members!”

Awakening innate divine abilities was an extremely difficult thing. It was not that it could definitely be accomplished by possessing the emperor bone.

For Qilin Clan, being able to awaken innate divine abilities at Qi Yun’s age was already very remarkable.

But Ye Yuan was clearly even more talented than them.

“No way, this Qilin emperor bone is extraordinary, we must bring it back to the clan!”

Qi Yun’s gaze turned intent, stepping onto the void, he pointed at Ye Yuan and said, “Since you’re Second Sage, I believe that your alchemy strength must be extremely strong, do you dare to wager?”

Ye Yuan looked at Qi Yun and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Oh? Bet on what?”

Qi Yun said sternly, “My Big Brother, Qi Zhen, is the Qilin pseudo world’s distinguished alchemy talent among the young generation. Do you dare to bet with him? If you lose, leave behind the emperor bone!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed and he said coolly, “Then ... what will you guys use to bet against me?”
