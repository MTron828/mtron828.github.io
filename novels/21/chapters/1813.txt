“Heh, Song Ting’s luck is really good. Qian Ye was finished off by Ye Yuan, that’s how he covered his position without a hitch and obtained the qualifications to participate in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.”

“His strength is too weak. He’s also playing a supporting role by going. In my view, might as well let Ye Yuan go!”

“What a pity, Ye Yuan’s strength can absolutely go to the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, but he’s unable to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm.”

...

On the plaza in front of the main peak’s great hall, the entire sect was sending off the disciples taking part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.

There were a total of four disciples taking part in the Baili Qingyan. They were respectively Baili Qingyan, Jiang Xueyan, Yi Qingxiang, and Song Ting.

Originally, Song Ting had no chance to participate in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave. But Qian Ye’s death gave him a chance.

Within the scope of the age allowed, picking the best person available, there was only Song Ting remaining.

Song Ting broke through and became a First Firmament Celestial Deity more than a hundred years ago. Presently, his strength already could not be compared to what it used to be.

The current Song Ting appeared to be in high and vigorous spirits. No matter what, being able to take part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave was also a very glorious thing.

At least, the Devil Elephant lineage would benefit along with him.

“Heh, so what if Ye Yuan’s talent is outstanding? At least in this season, he has no hopes of participating in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave!”

Song Ting was pleased with himself inwardly.

He knew that him participating in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave was hard to convince the masses. But with Ye Yuan failing to live up to expectations, who could be blamed?

Over there, Baili Qingyan’s beautiful eyes scanned the crowd, as if searching for something.

Jiang Xueyan smiled coldly when she heard that and said, “Stop looking. It’s impossible for that kid to appear. Breaking through to the Celestial Deity Realm in 10 years, nobody can do this sort of thing. Or is it that you feel that he’ll come to see you off?”

Baili Qingyan said quietly, “He said before that he’ll break through!”

No idea why, even though Baili Qingyan herself did not believe it, she still looked forward to Ye Yuan succeeding.

Sometimes, human psychology was so wondrous.

Jiang Xueyan pursed her lips and said scornfully, “Although that kid’s law comprehensions is formidable, his cultivation speed isn’t considered fast. With his cultivation speed, it’s simply impossible to cultivate to become a First Firmament Celestial Deity from a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord. Don’t you know about this?”

But Baili Qingyan insisted and said, “Others can’t, maybe ... he really can?”

Jiang Xueyan could not resist rolling her eyes and said, “You lass, you’re really silly!”

Participating in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave this time, the one leading the team was the Canopy Peak’s skill-imparting elder, Xu Yan.

This time, Canopy Peak had two disciples taking part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave. He, as the skill-imparting elder, naturally felt proud.

He gave a few words of encouragement on the plaza, flicked his sleeves grandly, and said, “Set off!”

Baili Qingyan’s expression turned dim and she let out a soft sigh, “He still didn’t come in the end!”

Finished talking, she followed Xu Yan and flew high into the sky.

“Wait a minute!”

Right at this time, a figure leaped into the air, blocking the few people’s path.

“It’s Ye Yuan! He ... He actually broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm!”

“Truly inconceivable! In just 10 years’ time, he broke through two realms in a row, reaching the Celestial Deity Realm!”

“Heh heh, with this, Song Ting is probably feeling awful in his heart, right? The cooked duck suddenly flew.”

“Serves him right! This guy looks like a scoundrel who realized his ambitions all day long ever since obtaining the qualifications of the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.”

...

Song Ting’s expression was incomparably ugly. He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually broke through at the final juncture!

This way, his Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave qualifications would definitely be revoked.

This kind of thing, he really found it a little hard to accept.

Jiang Xueyan’s expression was also not much better than Song Ting’s.

She was still mocking Ye Yuan just now, saying that there was no way he could break through to Celestial Deity Realm.

In the end, her voice had yet to fade and Ye Yuan appeared in front of her in the manner of a Celestial Deity Realm.

Baili Qingyan had a surprised expression on her face. She did not expect that Ye Yuan really did it.

Ten years ago, Ye Yuan said that he could break through to the Celestial Deity Realm. She did not believe it at all.

This guy was simply a freak!

From the Divine Lord Realm to the Celestial Deity Realm, this hurdle, many people spent several tens of thousands of years and found it difficult to break through.

Ye Yuan was exceptional. He did it in ten years.

Ye Yuan looked at Xu Yan and said, “Elder Xu, I want to take part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.”

Xu Yan looked at Ye Yuan with an astonished look and said with a nod, “I didn’t expect that you actually broke through at the last juncture. You really surprised this old man! Since you already broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm, then everything can naturally be discussed. With your strength, you should naturally obtain a spot.”

Hearing this, the expression on Song Ting’s face was incomparably ugly.

He went through numerous fights and eliminated many powerhouses of the same generation before obtaining this spot.

In the end, a word from Xu Yan revoked him.

Now, he already rose into the sky. But had to return to the main peak again, those people below were probably all watching the joke, right?

What a big loss of face!

Ye Yuan smiled and said with clasped hands, “Many thanks, Elder Xu. But this disciple has long broken through. It’s just that I made a trip to the Medicine Refining Hall, that’s why it took some time.”

Xu Yan was rather surprised as he said, “You just broke through and shouldn’t need medicinal pills. What did you go to the Medicine Refining Hall for?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I heard that geniuses gather at the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave this time. There are even some sects’ disciples who already broke through to Second Firmament Celestial Deity. So I specially went to refine a medicinal pill for Senior Apprentice Sister Baili.”

Baili Qingyan was extremely surprised when she heard that. Ye Yuan actually refined a pill for her!

Xu Yan said in surprise, “You even know how to refine pills?”

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Know a thing or two.”

As he said, Ye Yuan passed a small bottle to Baili Qingyan and said, “With Senior Apprentice Sister’s aptitude, swallow this Jadethaw Purpleheart Pill and you should be able to break through to Second Firmament Celestial Deity.”

When these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar!

Even though Baili Qingyan’s talent was outstanding, after breaking through to the Celestial Deity Realm, the speed of her realm improvement also clearly slowed down.

These 200 years’ time, she only barely managed to cultivate to late-stage First Firmament Celestial Deity. There was still a way off from the peak.

But Ye Yuan said that this medicinal pill could make Baili Qingyan directly break through to become a Second Firmament Celestial Deity.

Was this medicinal pill so magical?

Baili Qingyan opened the small bottle puzzledly. A burst of medicinal fragrance rose into the sky. She opened her mouth wide and said in disbelief, “D-Divine-grade Jadethaw Purpleheart Pil!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Hurry up and eat, keep staring blankly and the medicinal effect will weaken!”

Baili Qingyan was slightly startled and hurriedly swallowed the medicinal pill.

Xu Yan looked at Ye Yuan in incomparable shock. He already could not use words to describe his feelings at this time.

Not only did this boy’s strength surpass others, his talent outstanding, but his pill refining skill was also impressive too!

Not long after Baili Qingyan consumed the medicinal pill, the aura on her body started climbing frenziedly, rushing toward Second Firmament Celestial Deity.

“Broke through! Really broke through! My God, the medicinal effect of this medicinal pill is also too strong, right?”

“With this, Senior Apprentice Sister Baili’s strength is going to soar a great deal. The hopes of our Shadowmoon Sect seizing a spot also greatly increased!”

“This Ye Yuan brought us pleasant surprises time after time! This guy is really remarkable!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Under the watchful gazes of the people, Baili Qingyan’s really broke through to become a Second Firmament Celestial Deity just like that!
