Chapter 2335: Cloudaid City

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

One incomparably powerful aura after another arrived in an instant.

The Jian Family had many experts. Seeing such a terrifying line-up, each and every one of them was alarmed.

“Who dares to act wildly in the Jian Family!”

“To dare make a move against Progenitor, got tired of living?”

... ...

Alarmed and angry voices came over one after another. But when they arrived here, they could not help having stunned faces.

A handsome youth was standing in front of their progenitor. There was no one else.

This youth’s strength was only Heavenly Emperor Realm, but their progenitor who was opposite him was heavily injured until he vomited blood!

Could it be that it was this youth who hurt their progenitor?

How was this possible?

They wanted to berate this youth, but they felt that it was somewhat funny.

How could their progenitor possibly be hurt by a Heavenly Emperor?

Just as they were stunned, they saw Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets wave his hand slightly and say, “It’s fine. All go back!”

Everyone exchanged glances, being at a loss on what to do.

Jian Yunxin also woke up from the shock and said, “It’s fine. All go back for now!”

Only then did everyone leave with puzzled looks.

Ye Yuan also had a helpless look and said, “Profound Secrets Heavenly Capital should have many spirit medicines, right? Why not, let this Ye refine a medicinal pill for Senior to heal your injuries?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets nodded slightly, expressing his consent.

He naturally knew about the matter of Ye Yuan being conferred the status of an ancestor. If anyone in this world could refine pills for him, it would be none other than Ye Yuan.

Jian Yunxin sent Ye Yuan to refine the pill and then turned back.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was well-deserving of being the number one Heavenly Emperor, at this time, he already recovered to normal.

Seeing Jian Yunxin looking like he wanted to speak, but swallowing his words back, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said coolly, “He’s different from the rest! Unpredictable children similarly have the distinction of high and low. But no matter how high they are, they also won’t provoke Heavenly Dao’s warning! This old man has divined for a trillion years and also can’t see where the human race’s way out lies. Perhaps this slight variable ...will fall on him for all I know!”

Jian Yunxin’s entire body trembled and he said, “This boy must be hiding a massive secret on him! Why don’t ... Father replace him?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets gave him a glance and shook his head and said, “It’s been so many years. Don’t you understand it yet? Every single being has its own destiny! That secret with him is a variable. Placed on me, it will become a fixed number! In this battle, the human race will definitely be defeated! If it becomes a fixed factor, then the human race will be ruined in this old man’s hands! Putting aside merits and demerits, will the divine race let us, these existences, off?”

Jian Yunxin drew a breath of cold air and said in shame, “It was this child who was impulsive! But he’s currently too weak! Can he really grow to the extent of influencing the battle situation?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets laughed in spite of himself and said, “How can I know? If he can be divined, he wouldn’t be an unpredictable child! It’s precisely because he’s unpredictable that the human race has a chance! Actually, the one who’s curious isn’t just you. This old man is very curious too!”

Several days later, Ye Yuan refined a quasi-Dao Pill.

After Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets consumed it, his injuries immediately improved significantly.

Except, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ realm was too high. Ye Yuan’s realm was not there yet currently. Hence, the medicinal pills refined could not let him recover fully.

But with Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ ability, what remained was not that serious.

With regards to Ye Yuan’s alchemy skill, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets also lauded over and over again.

After the matter, Jian Yunxin brought Ye Yuan into the Primeval War Realm.

The Primeval War Realm’s entrance was in Profound Secrets Heavenly Capital.

“Alright. I’ll send you up to here. After you go in, you’ll naturally know what to do,” Jian Yunxin said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and entered the small world.

A feeling of weightlessness suddenly appeared. Ye Yuan only felt a blur before his eyes and he entered a ball of light.

Then a large amount of information entered his mind.

It turned out that this Primeval War Realm was actually a world like the Death Cultivation Space.

This ball of light could perfectly replicate his strength.

Of course, this Primeval War Realm was established by Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets by expending great efforts. It was naturally God knows how many times more advanced than the Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove!

Ye Yuan led the clone. Furthermore, all that this clone acquired in the Primeval War Realm was equivalent to him obtaining it.

This was also to say that when the clone cultivated in the Primeval War Realm, the heaven and earth spiritual energy would be transmitted onto the main body.

This was equivalent to the main body cultivating.

This clone was actually equivalent to Ye Yuan’s own body!

Furthermore, this clone could revive infinitely!

This kind of means was simply inconceivable.

This clone would enter the Primeval War Realm to fight!

In the Primeval War Realm, there were a hundred cities. Each city had ten thousand unpredictable children.

The unpredictable children fought among each other or went out of the city to hunt all kinds of ferocious beasts.

Fighting was not allowed in the city. Outside the city, there were hunting grounds.

With each fierce beast hunted, one would obtain god of war points.

Among unpredictable children, they were ranked based on god of war points.

This Primeval War Realm was actually a virtual battle space!

“Hiss ... A million unpredictable children! Furthermore, they are all Heavenly Emperor powerhouses!” When Ye Yuan became aware of this information, he could not help feeling shocked.

He did not expect that the human, demon, fiend, and various races actually had so many unpredictable children.

This was still merely just unpredictable children. The human race’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouses are probably numbered in the tens of millions!

Ye Yuan discovered that he still underestimated the human race.

He used to think that Heavenly Emperors were paramount existences. The numbers must be extremely few.

But reaching his present realm, the level that he came into contact with was totally different. Only then did he discover the strength that the human race concealed!

The reproduction ability of these few races was too strong!

Back then, the few races used human wave tactics and brutishly defeated the divine race to death.

If I could not beat you with one progenitor, then three.

If three could not beat, then five! Ten!

The invincible divine race was suppressed just like that.

But thinking carefully, Ye Yuan felt at ease.

The Heavenspan World was boundless without horizon, the numbers of the few races could simply be calculated in billions of trillions.

Even if one Heavenly Emperor appeared among a billion martial artists, the number that accumulated would also be very considerable.

However, Heavenly Emperors were easy to obtain, while Devas were hard to ask for!

Deva Realm powerhouses were truly rare.

Those able to transcend the Deva blight tribulation were one in a million.

The vast majority of Heavenly Emperors all died in the Deva blight tribulation.

Hence, in the last Doomsday Battle, the human race sovereigns virtually all fell. It was a destructive blow to the human race.

After understanding the Primeval War Realm’s information, Ye Yuan’s consciousness sunk into the light ball. He only felt a blur before his eyes and his entire person arrived at a prosperous city.

Ye Yuan, Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

City location: Cloudaid City!

God of war points: zero!

God of war ranking: 12,532!

At this time, some more information appeared in Ye Yuan’s head.

Very clearly, there were currently a total of 12,532 unpredictable children in this Cloudaid City.

And his ranking was at the bottom!

“Eh, another newcomer.”

“Huhu, so weak, just Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor.”

“This bit of strength also dares to come to the Primeval War Realm. Reckon that before long, he’ll be frightened until he doesn’t dare to go out of the city, right?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

... ...

The moment Ye Yuan landed, he immediately attracted a crowd of onlookers.

Of course, there was more disdain.

Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor strength was not worth mentioning in the city.

Ye Yuan knew that the Primeval War Realm had already been open for more than a year.

It was equivalent to him falling far behind the rest!
