Chapter 2762: Very Sorry to Tell You!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The powerhouses that were onlooking were stunned!

You’re a True Sovereign Heaven, but you’re so cowardly?

The True Sovereign Heaven of the legends that was flying up to heaven and tunneling into the earth; each one of them was omnipotent!

In the end, he was sent packing by a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven!

It was fine that he was driven away. But he actually directly said that he was going to get away from the Rainclear Continent!

People looked at Ye Yuan’s near-empty origin divinity, their gaze full of confusion and admiration.

This guy was really impressive!

However, Ye Yuan also let out a long sigh of relief when he saw that Yan Jadetrue ran.

This battle had practically exhausted his origin divinity entirely!

The origin divinity of a True Sovereign Heaven was really too formidable.

Even if Yan Jadetrue did not have much origin divinity means, even if he allocated the vast majority of his soul force to suppress the Frivolous Life Like a Dream, the opponent was still powerful until it made people despair.

However, he did not lie to Yan Jadetrue. The Arrow of God Extermination could indeed imprint a mark.

Within a certain range, Ye Yuan could sense the existence of the other party’s origin divinity.

Nowhere to hide!

Furthermore, with the Divine Emergence’s capability, it was virtually impossible for Yan Jadetrue to want to erase the mark!

At this time, Ye Yuan could feel that Yan Jadetrue was currently heading south at an extremely fast speed.

It looked like he was truly scared.

Ye Yuan was not worried about him causing new problems. Yan Jadetrue’s state was not much better than him.

Frivolous Life Like a Dream was already on the verge of eruption.

Looking at the corpses that covered the land, Ye Yuan could not help shaking his head slightly.

The Jadetrue Heavenly Sect was considered to be thoroughly finished.

Yan Jadetrue created the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect with his own hands and also personally destroyed the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

But none of this had anything to do with him.

As long as his loved ones were safe, everything was fine.

The current Ye Yuan was extremely weak as if a gust of wind would be able to scatter his origin divinity.

He turned around slightly and was about to leave.

But right at this time, the void suddenly flickered, and a figure stopped him.

The arrival looked at Ye Yuan and asked, “You’re Ye Yuan? Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s Ye Yuan?”

In front of him was a middle-aged man in Chinese clothing. He actually had Saint Sovereign Heaven cultivation.

But it looked like he had just broken through not long ago.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. The other party clearly did not come with friendly intentions.

“It’s precisely this Ye!” Ye Yuan did not have the intention of denying it and said coolly.

But, the moment these words came out, the expressions of the powerhouses present changed one after another.

“It’s actually him! Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s remnant spawn! He’s actually not dead!”

“Not only did he not die, his origin divinity even broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven! Just now, he even routed the origin divinity of a True Sovereign Heaven until he fled!”

“However, he’s already an arrow at the end of its flight now! Zhang Kaiyun probably won’t let him off!”

… …

Ye Yuan did not know this man, but the majority of the powerhouses present knew him.

This man was none other than precisely Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s first seat, Zhang Kaiyun!

And Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s first seat was naturally a member of the Pill Alliance!

When Ye Yuan entered the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, Zhang Kaiyun was in closed-seclusion.

A few days ago, Zhang Kaiyun broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven and just exited seclusion.

He did not expect that today, an astonishing great battle would happen within the boundary of Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

Through Yan Jadetrue and Ye Yuan’s conversation, Zhang Kaiyun learned of Ye Yuan’s identity very quickly.

Back then, when the Pill Alliance launched an attack ahead of schedule, it was because of Ye Yuan. As one of the Pill Alliance’s middle-level, Zhang Kaiyun naturally knew about Ye Yuan’s identity.

It was just that he never thought that the present Ye Yuan was already so formidable, to actually beat a True Sovereign Heaven until he covered his head and scurried away!

At that time, he already gave rise to the idea of reaping advantages from both sides without lifting a finger.

The moment the middle-aged man heard, two rays of brilliant light shot out of his eyes.

“Hahaha

?… Fortune is really shining down on me, Zhang Kaiyun, recently! First, I broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven. After that, I picked up a great contribution for free!” Zhang Kaiyun said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “You’re a member of the Pill Alliance?”

Zhang Kaiyun smiled and said, “That’s right! This exalt is Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s first seat! A few days ago, this exalt just broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven. I didn’t expect that you delivered this exalt a big gift so quickly!”

Zhang Kaiyun laughed very happily. Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s collapse had nothing to do with him whatsoever.

Him being in the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, apart from extortion, it was still espionage.

It was also precisely because of this that he could break the shackles and break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

The Pill Alliance’s first seats were no different from vampires in the various sects.

In his view, Ye Yuan was already in his pocket.

Ye Yuan looked at Zhang Kaiyun and said with a smile that was not a smile, “In that case, you’ve got me?”

Zhang Kaiyun similarly had a smile that was not a smile and said, “Boy, you’re already an arrow at the end of its flight. Do you think that this exalt can’t tell? Earlier, you forcefully mustered up a breath and used that move to scare Yan Jadetrue away. Now, if you release that move again, your own origin divinity will probably be buried in oblivion first, right? Furthermore, this exalt’s physical body is in good condition. I’m not afraid of your origin divinity attack!”

With regards to Ye Yuan, Zhang Kaiyun was clearly brimming with confidence.

He had long seen through that Ye Yuan’s Arrow of God Extermination move was a hand-to-hand combat move that specifically targeted the origin divinity.

This kind of move was extremely lethal to an exposed origin divinity. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But he was Saint Sovereign Heaven. His origin divinity was similarly incomparably powerful. Furthermore, it resided in the sea of consciousness.

It was simply a fool’s talk for Ye Yuan to want to use that move to directly breach his sea of consciousness!

If Ye Yuan was still at the height of his power, he would naturally be a little fearful.

But now, apart from surrendering without resistance, Ye Yuan had no other path to take!

Zhang Kaiyun became more and more confident as he spoke and continued to say smugly, “Furthermore, do you think that a member of my Pill Alliance is the same as that fool just now? Without origin divinity attack means??Huhu,?my Pill Alliance’s foundation is what you can’t imagine!”

Finished saying, Zhang Kaiyun’s origin divinity power spread out, the expressions of the powerhouses around changed one after another.

So strong!

Zhang Kaiyun’s origin divinity power and Ye Yuan’s, one was like the noonday sun while the other was like the sun setting in the west; there was no comparison at all.

The illusory Ye Yuan was still very calm at this time and could not help laughing as he said, “So, this is all of your analysis? You feel that I already don’t have the strength to fight back now. You were sitting on top of the mountain watching the tigers fight previously, waiting for the two of us to wear each other out before you dare to come out and deal with me?”

Zhang Kaiyun’s face turned black. Ye Yuan’s words were very insulting!

Ye Yuan was indifferent to the black-faced Zhang Kaiyun and continued saying, “You Pill Alliance has a deep foundation. Your cultivation realm is similar to mine. Furthermore, your origin divinity is stowed in your sea of consciousness. This powerful and you don’t even dare to come out and have a frontal confrontation? Maybe if you made a move just now, the result would be totally different! Very sorry to tell you, True Sovereign Heaven isn’t as weak as you imagine! The reason why Yan Jadetrue was beaten until like that by me was that he was just lacking an opportunity to catch his breath! Once he catches his breath, I’ll only have one road open to me; it will be death!”

The more Ye Yuan said those words, the blacker Zhang Kaiyun’s face became.

He suddenly felt that he seemed to have missed something.

Ye Yuan continued talking, “Saying so much, I actually just want to tell you that you missed the best chance to capture or kill me! Although the current me is already an arrow at the end of its flight, killing a weakling like you, this degree is enough. No matter how plentiful your means, how deep your foundation, you’re still too weak to stand up to a single blow in front of me!”

Zhang Kaiyun smiled coldly and said, “Brat, are you making an empty show of strength? Do you think that this exalt will let you off like this?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Making an empty show of strength? You’re thinking too much!”

Zhang Kaiyun only felt his head go buzz, and then he did not know anything anymore.

He did not even have the chance to release the big move that he was preparing!
