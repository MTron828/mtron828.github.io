Chapter 2978: Mountain Challenging!

Above the void, dragon and phoenix contended in cries!

Two absolutely different bloodlines superimposed together actually produced an effect of one plus one equals greater than two.

This was what everyone did not expect.

The two great bloodlines were completely sublimated under Ye Yuan’s Dragon and Phoenix Prosperity move!

In an instant, Phoenix Nine Ensembles and Dragon and Phoenix Prosperity collided together, causing a violent shock.

Even for an expert such as Feng Ninesong, her expression changed drastically when she saw this kind of terrifying power too.

These two people’s strengths had already far exceeded the scope of ordinary Emperor Cloud Heavens!

This was a true battle of geniuses!

Boom!

Feng Qingxuan’s phoenix phantom directly shattered under the suppression of the dragon and phoenix, two great bloodlines.

A force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas slammed into her body.

Feng Qingxuan spurted out a mouthful of blood with a cough, her figure drawing a parabolic curve, falling to the ground.

Meanwhile, Ye Yuan was completely unharmed.

He stood proudly in the air, still recollecting the aftertaste of the feeling just now.

The power of Dragon and Phoenix Prosperity somewhat exceeded his expectations.

This move was naturally researched by him based on the origin of chaos blood.

He did not expect that the power would actually be so great when fusing two supreme bloodlines together!

“Senior …”

“Mn,?I really didn’t expect it turns out that after the bloodlines of dragon and phoenix two races fuse together, it actually has such power! Then if the four great chaos true spirits’ bloodlines can all be fused, then the power …”

Mi Tian’s voice was also somewhat trembling, clearly quite excited.

Concerning the fusion of supreme bloodlines, this was simply something impossible.

Four great chaos true spirit bloodlines, their physical bodies were born for their bloodlines. It was simply impossible to fuse another kind of bloodline.

The compatibility of human cultivators was extremely high. But, when bloodlines entered their bodies, it would become extremely faint.

Furthermore, bloodlines were inherently averse to each other. It was impossible to fuse at all.

If ordinary human cultivators wanted to fuse bloodlines, the only outcome would be being blown up by the confrontation of two great bloodlines.

But Ye Yuan had the origin of blood. He had dragon blood in his body but the physical body of a human. The convenience of all these created conditions for the fusion of bloodlines.

If one could really fuse the four great bloodlines, that power would simply be unimaginable.

“If it’s possible, I can really try to do it,” Ye Yuan said.

However, he also knew that this difficulty was considerable.

This time, it was luck, for him to encounter someone like Feng Qingxuan who was being pursued.

Otherwise, heaven qian grade bloodlines were all the precious treasures of the various races. Wanting to obtain it was not so easy.

As for Feng Qingxuan and the rest, they were long already too shocked to speak.

When everything dissipated with the wind, only then did they wake up from the dream.

“The bloodlines of the dragon race and phoenix race can actually fuse!”

“The power after fusion is also a little too strong, right?”

“Sir Ye completely defeated Feng Qingxuan at middle Emperor Cloud Heaven! This … This is simply unimaginable!”

… …

They were all too clear about Feng Qingxuan’s strength.

Even under the pursuit of Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses, she still escaped.

Feng Ninesong examined her own conscience and felt that, compared to Feng Ninesong, she was a complete rookie.

But this kind of proud daughter of heaven was completely defeated like this.

“You guys can leave!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Feng Ninesong’s expression changed, and she said, “You … You’re really letting us go?”

Ye Yuan said, “This Ye has always kept my word. Since I’ve promised you guys, I’ll naturally let you all go. If you draw the Fire Phoenix Clan to come and kill me, just bring it on.”

Feng Ninesong smiled bitterly. It turned out that Sir Ye’s heart is like a clear mirror. He knew everything.

Sure enough, he was a man of his word!

Feng Ninesong gave Ye Yuan a deep bow and said, “This matter, Ninesong will definitely keep a tight lid on my mouth. Sir, please rest assured!”

Ye Yuan waved his hands and said indifferently, “Suit yourself.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Ninesong smiled bitterly again and brought everyone away.

Fusing bloodlines this sort of thing was a major thing to the various major true spirit bloodlines.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan fused with heaven qian grade bloodline. This was also something that could not be tolerated to the Fire Phoenix Clan.

Once the Fire Phoenix Clan knew, they would definitely send people to come and kill Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan did not care at all.

After Feng Ninesong and the rest left, Ye Yuan’s figure moved, heading in the direction of East Billow Region.

Before traveling for long, he stopped.

Feng Qingxuan actually kept following him.

“Following me for?” Ye Yuan said.

“I have nowhere to go.”

“Our deal has already ended!”

“I feel that you’re still a pretty good person.”

Ye Yuan was speechless.

… …

In the Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, the various races’ true spirits mostly lived in tribes.

The dragon race had many offspring bloodlines that each formed a tribe.

The powerful ones even had Hegemon Realm powerhouses.

The weak ones did not even reach battle spirit grade bloodline.

The Divine Dragon Envoy surveyed the world. Wanting to catch the attention of the Divine Dragon Envoy, there was a method called Mountain Challenging!

Mountain challenging meant that for a person to go to the various major true spirit tribes, challenging the bloodline powerhouses in the clan.

This was the fastest way to enter Heavenly Dragon Island!

Dragon City Tribe was a powerful dragon race tribe of East Billow Region.

Although they considered themselves to be a dragon race tribe, this was actually a tribe based on the Heaven Swallowing Python.

However, the Heaven Swallowing Python’s dragon race bloodline was very strong too. According to Mi Tian, this tribe had even given birth to heaven qian grade bloodline before.

Therefore, Dragon City Tribe was a powerful tribe too.

To do mountain challenging, one could not avoid Dragon City Tribe.

Ye Yuan and Feng Qingxuan, one in front and one behind, arrived in front of Dragon City Tribe.

“Stop! Foolish human, to dare approach the noble Dragon race! Hurry up and get lost!” In front of the tribe, Ye Yuan was reprimanded by a human male.

Ye Yuan was shocked.?Aren’t you a human too?

He asked to clear his doubts. The human male sneered and said, “What the hell do you know? I’m a dragonblood warrior who’s currently evolving towards a noble true spirit!”

Ye Yuan let out a slight sigh. Perhaps, this was the inferiority complex of humans.

He knew that Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven’s humans were very difficult, most of them born by depending on tribes.

But he did not expect that they were lowly until this extent.

This dragonblood warrior’s cultivation realm was not low. It had already reached Emperor Realm.

It was just that his bloodline was a little terrible. It did not even reach battle spirit grade bloodline.

Emperor Cloud Heavens could be considered a powerhouse of a region too. But, they could only guard the door for the Dragon City Tribe.

“I’m here to challenge the mountain,” Ye Yuan said.

The human male was taken aback and immediately burst out laughing and said, “You, a human, coming to the Dragon City Tribe to challenge the mountain? Are you kidding me?”

However, in the next second, the human male’s expression changed greatly.

From Ye Yuan’s body, an incomparably pure dragon pressure suppressed him until he could not breathe!

The human male had a look of horror on his face and said in shock, “Earth kun grade bloodline! You … You … How is this possible?”

He was seriously unable to imagine that a human’s dragon race bloodline could reach earth kun grade!

There were far too many dragonblood warriors in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven.

But, for the vast majority among them, it was impossible to surpass battle soul grade.

As for battle god grade, those were all existences like the feather of a phoenix and horn of a qilin, being very rare.

Each one was a supreme powerhouse among bloodline warriors.

But this young man in front of him actually had earth kun grade bloodline. It shocked him until he could not close his mouth.

“Now, can I?” Ye Yuan looked at the human male and said lightly.
