Chapter 2096: Second Sage

This middle-aged man that suddenly appeared had a stocky and imposing build, having a full beard on his face, looking very boorish.

It was just that the divine essence undulation on his body was different from Vast Wind and the rest. It was shockingly a demon race’s major power!

He was Empyrean Huntwind, one of the Northernmost Steppe’s five great demon race Empyreans.

His status was comparable to Empyrean Vast Wind’s in the demon race.

Hearing Empyrean Vast Wind’s question, Empyrean Huntwind chuckled and said, “You old wily fox, using the human race to come and suppress this Empyrean? Heh, if not for dreading those few old monsters, do you think that it’s your turn to be unbridled here?”

Empyrean Vast Wind snorted coldly and said, “This boy has the enmity of having killed my son. If you protect him, you can forget about leaving this place today!”

But Empyrean Huntwind ignored him. Instead, he turned around and gave a respectful bow toward Ye Yuan and said, “Huntwind was tardy in coming to the rescue. I hope that Lord Second Sage pardons my offense.”

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and said coolly, “No worries. The time was just right.”

Empyrean Huntwind suddenly switched to a pleased expression as he asked excitedly, “Lord Second Sage killed Feng Tianyang?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said coolly, “Feng Tianyang coveted Lu-er’s Profound Yin Divine Physique and was killed by me with one sword move.”

“Hahaha, well killed! This Empyrean wanted to kill that punk long ago, but Vast Wind this old thing is too cunning, not giving me any chance. I didn’t expect that he actually died in Lord Second Sage’s hands!” Empyrean Huntwind said with a big laugh.

Although he was laughing, he was actually extremely shocked in his heart.

What kind of character was Feng Tianyang?

Even he, one of the demon race’s five great Empyreans, was extremely apprehensive of him.

Once Feng Tianyang grew up, it would absolutely be a catastrophic blow to their demon race.

Hence, for so many years, Empyrean Huntwind had once engineered numerous murder schemes targeting Feng Tianyang.

But none ever succeeded even once.

For this, the demon race even lost numerous geniuses.

Who could have thought that Feng Tianyang actually died just like that?

He died in the hands of a middle-stage True God Realm!

When Vast Wind and the rest of the Empyreans saw Huntwind’s attitude, their eyeballs nearly popped out.

This stubborn and unruly demon race major power was actually so respectful toward a human race’s True God Realm?

In this land of extreme north, Vast Wind and the rest had fought with the demon race’s five great Empyreans countless times before. When had they seen him be so respectful toward someone before?

Also, Empyrean Huntwind actually called Ye Yuan ‘Second Sage’.

Who could shoulder this form of address?

Just who was this kid in front of him?

Empyrean Vast Wind did not know that before Ye Yuan came to the extreme north, the demon race’s Sacred Ancestor High Priest announced to the entire demon race that he was conferring to Ye Yuan the title ‘Second Sage.’

In alchemy, this was an existence second only to him!

This title stirred up monumental waves in the demon race.

The Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s status in the demon race was extremely revered. The ‘Second Sage’ that he personally conferred, how venerated was that status?

Why would Ye Yuan not have any reliance when coming to this Jiu Luo Ji?

This title of ‘Second Sage’ was the path of retreat that he saved for himself.

Ye Yuan knew that the Northernmost Steppe was a vast territory. Even if he saved Lu-er, he might not be able to escape too.

And this Northernmost Steppe’s demon race was his greatest reliance.

Hence, that was why Ye Yuan used up the Heaven Shocking Lightning without any scruples.

Seeing Empyrean Huntwind’s gloating appearance, Empyrean Vast Wind finally could not endure it anymore.

“Humph! Huntwind, this Empyrean doesn’t care who he is! If you dare to stop this Empyrean today, this Empyrean will make you fall here!”

Empyrean Vast Wind’s aura suddenly released and actually directly reached Seventh Firmament Empyrean!

Huntwind had a look of amusement as he said, “Haha, did you think that only you broke through?”

The moment Empyrean Huntwind’s aura was released, berserk demon divine essence was emitted, and he was actually not the least bit weaker than Empyrean Vast Wind!

Empyrean Vast Wind’s expression changed. He thought that he would be able to suppress the five great Empyreans after he broke through. Who knew that Empyrean Huntwind was the same as him, also breaking through to the late-stage Empyrean Realm.

Except, his notion of killing Ye Yuan would not change at all simply because of Empyrean Huntwind’s breakthrough.

“Tian Jue, Mie Yu, Zhen Huang, this Empyrean will deal with this old bear. You all attack together, go kill that boy!” Empyrean Vast Wind ordered.

Empyrean Huntwind laughed loudly and flicked his sleeves grandly and said, “Competing with numbers? Open your dog eyes and take a look!”

The moment these words came out, each and every one of the human race’s major powers’ faces changed drastically.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In the void, one figure after another stepped out of the air. It was all Empyrean powerhouses!

Roughly calculating a bit, there were probably already several hundred Empyrean powerhouses.

The faces of Vast Wind and the rest turned pale with a whoosh.

“This ... What the hell is going on here? The demon race’s five great Empyreans have always been divided, why would they join hands and attack this time?”

“This kind of line-up, probably the entire extreme north’s demon race Empyreans are all here, right?”

“How is this possible? The extreme north’s demon race goes on conquests year in and year out without ceasing, that’s how our human race can keep a foothold here, but today ...”

... ...

When the human race’s several dozen Empyreans saw such a terrifying line-up, each and every one of their faces revealed looks of despair.

In the Northernmost Steppe, the demon race’s strength was much stronger than the human race.

It was just that among the demon race’s powerhouses, neither yielded to the others. That was how the human race could survive between the crevices.

But today, these different species of demons actually all joined hands.

This kind of situation had never happened before.

If prior to this, their understanding of ‘Second Sage’ still remained on that it was a term.

However, now, they finally had a clear understanding of how powerful this noun was.

What kind of person could make the entire extreme north’s demon race be bound by a common hatred for the enemy?

Even if Huntwind broke through to the late-stage Empyrean Realm, he also could not do this!

In fact, those few old monsters of the demon race likewise could not do it too!

But Ye Yuan did it.

Empyrean Vast Wind finally understood what kind of powerful opponent he was facing.

“Hahaha! Vast Wind, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Continue to be cocky now! You want to kill Second Sage, then today, our extreme north’s demon race will annihilate your human race!” Huntwind laughed wildly and said.

Several hundred Empyreans ganging up on several dozen Empyreans, this kind of strength comparison was not on the same level at all.

Empyrean Vast Wind’s face was ashen. He never dreamed that he would end up in such a hopeless situation today.

When he heard that Ye Yuan used up the Heaven Shocking Lightning, he not only had fear toward Ye Yuan in his heart.

But who could have thought that a measly little True God Realm actually moved the entire extreme north’s demon race Empyreans?

“Vast Wind, this Empyrean said before, you can’t kill Master!” A figure slowly stepped out. It was precisely Empyrean Loneswan who escaped with the spatial node technique.

Empyrean Vast Wind’s expression flickered incessantly, and he gritted his teeth and said, “You all really want to fight a life-and-death struggle for a human?”

One of the demon race’s five great Empyreans, Empyrean Divine Scorpion, said with a sinister smile, “Heh heh, Vast Wind, this Empyrean wanted to kill you long ago! This time, you can forget about escaping!”

The five great Empyreans each stood separately, surrounding Empyrean Vast Wind.

As long as he made any unusual movements, what awaited him would be a lightning blow.

Finally, Empyrean Divine Scorpion clearly could not hold back anymore, wanting to take action.

“Stop! Without my orders, no one is allowed to make a move!”

Ye Yuan stood in the air, Empyrean Divine Scorpion stopped rather unwillingly.

He looked at Empyrean Vast Wind and said coolly, “Vast Wind, I wonder if this Ye’s warning is effective or not?”
