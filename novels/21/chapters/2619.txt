“Ninth grade perfection again! Tied again!”

“Too strong! The two are both too strong!”

“When heavenly imperial pills reached their hands, it can actually reach ninth grade perfection too! Really too monstrous!”

Ye Yuan’s heavenly imperial pill reached ninth grade perfection again. This made the whole audience seethe with excitement once more.

They had never seen before such a fierce alchemy competition. The two people’s Alchemy Dao had both reached the extreme, there was no way of determining the victor at all.

Bringing out a heavenly imperial pill now, the two people similarly reached ninth grade perfection!

Especially that the Cloudarch Great Nation at this time, many ascender heavenly alchemists had already gathered.

They were astonished by Ye Yuan’s performance!

Cang Yongning was a native heavenly alchemist, his affinity even reached a horrifying 70 plus, his strength being powerful was within reason.

But, as an ascender heavenly alchemist, Ye Yuan could actually contend with Cang Yongning this holy son with ten points affinity!

How amazingly talented was that!

Cang Yongning’s smugness had not lasted very long and his expression had already become very dark.

Got slapped in the face again this time!

The pill formula came from him. Furthermore, it was even a heavenly imperial pill, Ye Yuan definitely had not refined it before.

But he still reached ninth grade perfection!

He discovered that he severely underestimated Ye Yuan’s strength.

This guy was likely not far away from true grade as well!

Of course, Cang Yongning was clearly that ninth grade perfection to true grade, that was a great chasm!

Even in the Pill Alliance, the elders capable of refining true grade were very few too.

Ye Yuan being able to reach ninth grade perfection did not mean that he could refine true grade too.

However, Cang Yongning also realized that ninth grade perfection was likely unable to defeat Ye Yuan anymore!

Wanting to defeat Ye Yuan, there was only true grade!

“Lord Holy Son, the question that you asked is just so-so as well! Seems like reaching ninth grade perfection isn’t too difficult!” Ye Yuan mocked.

Cang Yongning calmed down instead at this time and said in a solemn voice, “It’s your turn to pose the question!”

Seeing Cang Yongning’s appearance, everyone was slightly somber in their hearts.

They all realized that Cang Yongning was serious!

Once Cang Yongning got serious, it meant that the chances of true grade appearing would probably greatly increase!

Cang Yongning said it before that when he refined grade two heavenly pills, the probability of true grade was about one in five times!

Now, two times had already passed, there were not many chances left for Ye Yuan anymore!

Ye Yuan did not care and said with a faint smile,?“Uh,?grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill then!”

“Grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill! H-He’s mad, right?”

“Choosing this kind of basic heavenly pill, wouldn’t the probability of Holy Son reaching true grade be higher?”

“What’s Ye Yuan thinking, isn’t this digging his own grave?

… …

Those ascender heavenly alchemists directly burst into an uproar.

If one had to say, they were the same as Ye Yuan, all ascenders. There was naturally a natural sense of closeness.

If Ye Yuan could really win, the Pill Pavilion would be able to stand up to the Pill Alliance as an equal.

Then, the springtime of them all, these ascender heavenly alchemists, would be here!

But Ye Yuan actually dug his own grave now and ruined the Great Wall himself!

Cang Yongning narrowed his eyes and said with a smile, “Very good! Looks like you’re very confident in the grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill! Do you want to use the grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to break through to true grade?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Why? Can’t I?”

Cang Yongning nodded slightly and said, “Of course you can. However, you’ll have to hurry it up!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said,?“Mn,?I’ll hurry up!”

The third round began very soon.

This time, it was even more thrilling!

Cang Yongning said that he would reach true grade one out of five times.

This did not mean that he would only refine a true grade on the fifth try.

This was an issue of probability!

A probability of one-in-five!

This was also to say that Cang Yongning might be able to directly refine a true grade heavenly pill this time!

After all, a grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill this sort of basic heavenly pill, it was seriously too easy to Cang Yongning!

The simpler, the higher the probability of refining true grade naturally.

Refining a grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, the situation was far more intense than everyone imagined.

The two people’s Alchemy Dao were virtually brought out to the extreme.

That profound and inscrutable accumulations of Great Dao seemed to be like a splendid burst of martial techniques, clashing chaotically all around.

While Cang Yongning’s Great Dao accumulations were incomparably powerful, Ye Yuan’s Great Dao accumulations were extremely solid!

Refining a grade two basic heavenly pill, the two people clearly accomplished it with even greater ease and could put more energy on the other party.

This battle dazzled everyone’s eyes.

The refinement ended, the furnaces opened!

Cang Yongning’s expression was very ugly.

He failed!

This guy was seriously too hard to deal with!

Sure enough, the end result was still both ninth grade perfection!

Unexpectedly, Cang Yongning also chose a grade two basic pill in the fourth round!

But the two still drew a tie in the fourth round!

Following which, the fifth round, sixth round, all the way until the 19th round, the two still only refined ninth grade perfection.

Cang Yongning did not use a true grade heavenly pill to seal the victory like he said!

A total of 19 rounds were carried out for half a month!

The crowd in front of Cloud Leisure Establishment gathered more and more and was already densely packed.

Many people even inquired and rushed over from various places.

This kind of pinnacle alchemy battle already attracted more and more people’s attention.

And at the scene, the people were almost asphyxiated by such fierce alchemy battles.

Too nervous, too exciting!

These two practically represented Rainclear Continent’s pinnacle-most alchemy path standard.

When Cang Yongning brought out true grade this obstruction, everyone all thought that Ye Yuan would lose.

But he persevered for a full 19 rounds!

Ye Yuan’s stubbornness surpassed everyone’s imagination.

This was a fierce battle. It was not just a test of strength; it was a test of character, spirit, and endurance!

After half a month, this level of peak showdown, the two people’s minds were already tightly wound to the extreme.

Even if Cang Yongning was a grade three heavenly alchemist and was much stronger to begin with, it was already more than he could bear.

This alchemy battle had an even greater expenditure than experiencing a war unequaled by contemporaries!

Since it was called an alchemy battle, the two people’s refinement, Great Dao accumulations, aura perception, all were crossing swords every hour and moment!

He was somewhat unable to imagine how Ye Yuan persevered.

Apart from the first round and second round, the remaining 17 rounds, the two people both chose grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

But no one broke through!

The 19 rounds were tied without exception!

After a bout of adjusting his breathing, Ye Yuan said disdainfully,?“Huhu,?you said one in five. Now, there have already been 19 matches, you haven’t even refined true grade once! The Pill Alliance’s Holy Son is merely thus!”

Cang Yongning got serious, but he really could not do anything to Ye Yuan!

He discovered that this guy was simply too difficult to deal with.

Ye Yuan was like a perpetual motion machine. After fighting 19 consecutive matches, he could still keep up with his pace!

Cang Yongning was very certain that Ye Yuan’s mind had already reached its limit.

Because he, this grade three heavenly alchemist, the Pill Alliance’ holy son, had already reached his limit too!

But he was just able to hold on.

Cang Yongning had to admit that if it were him, he would not have been able to hold on!

At this point, what they competed in was already not just strength, but even more of will!

Whoever failed to persist first would be eliminated!
