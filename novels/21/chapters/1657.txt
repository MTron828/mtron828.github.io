1661 He Can Do I

The end of the starry sky was a stretch of darkness.

An unfathomable aura emanated from the darkness.

Ye Yuan did not hesitate, directly taking a step out.

Entering inside the darkness, a powerful repulsive force hit him head-on, as if going to push his entire person out of the darkness.

Walking all the way until now, Dustless did not give him help.

He relied on his own strength to arrive here!

But his strength was clearly inadequate in front of a True God.

A powerful soul force surged out. Ye Yuan felt the pressure on his body suddenly reduce.

Since things that entered this place were only wisps of martial artists’ consciousness, this repulsive force naturally acted on the martial artist’s consciousness.

But the Soul Suppressing Pearl was too domineering in this regard.

Even a True God had to kneel in front of it!

Just like that, Ye Yuan slowly moved forward, entering the boundless darkness.

“It’s only because you didn’t break through to the Divine Lord Realm. Otherwise, there’s no need for this old man’s help at all and you’d be able to enter this space,” Dustless said with a smile.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That True God powerhouse should be looking for a Divine Lord Realm successor, that’s why he’d do so, right? Most likely, he also didn’t think that there’s actually an Origin Deity Realm who could walk until here.”

Dustless nodded and said, “That’s natural. Divine Lord Realms create a world, that’s a true Deity Realm powerhouse. Before Divine Lord Realm, accurately speaking, one is just a quasi-deity. Hence, he didn’t consider Origin Deity Realm martial artists at all.

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “Pity that I’ve been unable to open up a world and let him down.”

Dustless smiled and said, “A True God powerhouse’s inheritance is merely a minor assistance to you. Only true god mystic treasures, these things, still have some help to you.”

While chatting away, a starry sky vortex suddenly appeared ahead, being incomparably bright.

“This is the true inheritance, right?”

Ye Yuan took a step out and arrived in front of the starry sky vortex in an instant.

However, right at this time, a horrifying aura came from within, making Ye Yuan’s expression changed drastically.

This horrifying aura was extremely powerful, even making Ye Yuan’s consciousness almost collapse!

A massive figure appeared above that cluster of starry sky, looking down at Ye Yuan with a gloomy-cold gaze.

This gaze seemed to be somewhat angry and a little disappointed.

That enormous figure said, “I didn’t expect that the first one to walk until here is actually just an Origin Deity Realm kid. It really disappoints this seat too much.”

A gentle force instantly wrapped Ye Yuan up, making Ye Yuan recover to his initial-most state.

He looked at that massive figure and said coolly, “This Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate inheritance was left behind by Senior, right?”

Ye Yuan’s consciousness only trembled for a bit and recovered back to its original state. This made the other party rather surprised.

After being slightly surprised, he shook his head and said, “You have some skills, but your talent is too poor! Skeletal age already 500 over years old and actually still haven’t broken through to the Divine Lord Realm! You aren’t fit to obtain my inheritance!”

This powerhouse clearly had an extremely high requirement toward the successor’s talent. Hence, the moment he laid eyes on Ye Yuan, he denied Ye Yuan’s qualifications to become his successor.

One had to know, the 500 years old Jing Lu was already almost second-layered heaven Divine Lord and he could not even meet his requirements.

Even though Ye Yuan walked until here, his realm was too low. He turned his nose up at him too.

Ye Yuan was not angry and said with a faint smile, “This Ye already walked until here. Whether I get the inheritance or not isn’t Senior’s call.”

“Insolence!”

The powerhouse was greatly enraged when he heard it. Pointing a finger out, the starry sky changed colors.

A majestic and powerful will instantly crushed over toward Ye Yuan.

What entered this place was merely a wisp of Ye Yuan’s divine sense. The target of that powerhouse’s attack was naturally this wisp of divine sense too.

However, it was as if Ye Yuan was completely oblivious to it, and did not have the intention of resisting at all.

Even though this powerhouse only left behind a trace of remnant thought, he was also a True God Realm powerhouse no matter what. Eradicating an Origin Deity Realm divine sense was too easy.

However, when this burst of powerful will arrived in front of Ye Yuan, a terrifying energy vortex suddenly appeared.

That powerful will was directly swallowed up by this surge of energy vortex.

When the powerhouse saw the situation, his expression changed drastically. Pupils constricting, he said in shock, “This ... This is an empyrean spirit treasure!”

A True God powerhouse’s knowledge was naturally not what the average martial artist could compare to.

This horrifying energy undulation, only an empyrean spirit treasure could emit it.

There was actually an empyrean spirit treasure on this Origin Deity Realm kid’s body.

Moreover, it was even an extremely rare soul-type empyrean spirit treasure!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I wonder if I have the qualifications to be the successor?”

The powerhouse’s expression flickered incessantly. He never dreamed that he would actually be threatened by an Origin Deity Realm kid.

No, not threatened!

A soul-type empyrean spirit treasure was simply his nemesis!

As long as Ye Yuan was willing, blotting out his existence was simply as easy as turning his hand over.

Forget that he was just a wisp of remnant thought currently, even in his heyday, he was also not an empyrean spirit treasure’s match.

The powerhouse suddenly looked up at the sky and said with a sigh, “Truly, a tiger landing in a plain! Looks like my, Mo Lifei’s, big enmity, it has no luck to be avenged! Kid, do it! Exterminating this seat, you can naturally take away the inheritance!”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised. This Mo Lifei seemed to have a deep hatred, that was why he would set up the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate here and attempt to find a successor, to help him get revenge.

“Senior, you misunderstood. Actually, I’m not very interested in your inheritance. I just came in to take a look. If you really need a successor, I have a suitable candidate,” Ye Yuan suddenly said. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Mo Lifei was taken aback when he heard that and soon after, laughed in spite of himself and said, “Yeah, you are in possession of a soul-type empyrean spirit treasure, so why would you take fancy on this seat’s inheritance? But who is the suitable candidate that you speak of?”

Ye Yuan smiled, “Right in this stretch of starry sky, Senior should be able to sense it, right? He’s the closest to this place right now!”

Who Ye Yuan said was naturally Ning Tianping.

Mo Lifei’s brows furrowed slightly, his remnant thought flitted out, immediately seeing the Ning Tianping who was currently struggling bitterly.

“Him? Although his talent is pretty good, he’s still a little off from this seat’s requirements,” Mo Lifei shook his head and said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior doesn’t seem to have a choice now! But I can assure Senior that he’s absolutely the most suitable candidate! If Senior has any grievance unrequited, you can entrust it to him. He can definitely help Senior to fulfill your dying wish.”

Facing an existence like Ye Yuan, Mo Lifei completely had no temper at all.

Indeed, under this kind of circumstance, Ye Yuan finding a pretty good successor for him was considered giving him a lot of face already.

Otherwise, if Ye Yuan wanted to directly eliminate him, he would not be able to resist at all.

But Mo Lifei still shook his head and said, “You don’t know how powerful my enemy is! He might very likely already be an Empyrean powerhouse by now! Even by obtaining all of my legacies, the hope of revenge is also very bleak. He won’t be able to shoulder it!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “He can do it! Because he has me as a friend!”

Mo Lifei’s gaze turned intent, looking at Ye Yuan, being rather surprised.

This kid gave him a strange feeling in all aspects.

Moreover, for an Origin Deity Realm to be able to own an empyrean spirit treasure, this in itself was a matter beyond comprehension.
