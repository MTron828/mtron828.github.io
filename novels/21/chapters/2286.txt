Chapter 2290: First Lesson

“Hahaha! Splendid!” Wing clapped his hands and laughed loudly, seemingly very delighted.

Clearly, he was satisfied to the extreme with Ye Yuan’s performance.

Wing made an inviting gesture, indicating for Ye Yuan to take a seat.

This meant that Ye Yuan had the qualifications to sit and debate on Dao with him.

The title of Second Sage also became in reality as well as in name.

“Senior Sacred Ancestor’s strength is what broadened junior’s horizons,” Ye Yuan sat down opposite Wing and said with a smile.

Ever since entering the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan was virtually ever-triumphant in alchemy. He had never encountered a match before.

But this time, Ye Yuan knew that he really met his opponent!

The Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest were the two great peaks of Alchemy Dao, the apex of the world.

Wanting to surpass them was immensely difficult!

Even if Ye Yuan comprehended the source of Great Dao, and touched the level of Dao pill, there was still a considerable gap compared to them.

Those few moves earlier and Ye Yuan already deeply felt that might of Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

It was as if what was in front of him was an insurmountable mountain.

Of course, Ye Yuan was too young.

Regardless of whether it was the Medicine Ancestor or Sacred Ancestor High Priest, the time that they researched on alchemy had already been too long.

Wing filled Ye Yuan’s cup with tea and said smilingly, “I indeed didn’t misjudge. You didn’t let me down! It has only been a short 2000 years and your alchemy strength is already so terrifying, far exceeding my imagination.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Actually, from the first time I cracked Ask Not, you knew that there would be this day, no? In alchemy, this junior is confident that I’m not inferior to anyone, even if it’s you or the Medicine Ancestor!”

Ye Yuan had extremely strong confidence in alchemy path.

This was exchanged from his trillions of tempering and tens of millions of victory.

This kind of confidence was already deeply engraved in his bones, nobody could shake it.

But the moment these words came out, the faces of all the disciples changed. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The third person among the 11 disciples said in a solemn voice, “Impudent! Even if Master conferred you the title Second Sage, before you reach Deva Realm, you don’t have the qualifications to be so unbridled in front of Master too!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “This isn’t insolence, it’s a hero valuing a hero! This Ye respects Senior Sacred Ancestor’s breadth of spirit. So beating him is the greatest respect towards him! What he needs is not yes-men, but a powerful opponent! How can someone who behaves respectfully and is a yes-man be fit to be his opponent?”

The third disciple smiled coldly and said, “Preposterous! For you to have today’s accomplishments, isn’t it still because Master deliberately nurturing you? But when you come before Master, you don’t have the slightest gratitude, simply showing ingratitude for kindness!”

Ye Yuan laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “You guys seem to have some sort of misinterpretation of the meaning of nurturing. That’s right, I’d indeed borrowed Senior Sacred Ancestor’s power these few years. But in terms of nurturing, I’m afraid that this Ye can’t compare to one-ten-thousandth of you all, right?”

When the disciples heard that, each and every one of their faces became extremely ugly.

The implied meaning of these words was that you guys were too weak!

You all, these disciples, which one wasn’t personally groomed by Sacred Ancestor High Priest?

They enjoyed the Priest Temple’s resources, consuming countless of them.

But up until today, they did not have the qualifications to sit opposite their master too.

This was the disparity between them!

“This Ye have today’s accomplishments. It wasn’t by relying on anyone’s nurturing, but it was exchanged for by relying on my own efforts! Relying on other people’s grooming, one will never become a true powerhouse! You guys are like this, and the Medicine Ancestor’s those disciples are similarly like so! No doubt that walking other people’s paths are shortcuts, but not being able to walk your own path, you guys can forever only stand there. But I can sit here!”

Apart from Ji Mo, the other disciples’ expressions changed drastically one after another.

Wildly arrogant!

Too wildly arrogant!

This guy actually still dared to be so rampant in front of their master!

Second Disciple said in a solemn voice, “Master, this boy is too condescending! He doesn’t show any respect for you at all! In the future, when he achieves supremacy, he’ll surely be our Priest Temple’s mortal calamity!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest did not speak all along. He just drank tea quietly, allowing Ye Yuan and his disciples to cross swords with words.

He put down the cup and said with a loud laugh, “Hahaha ... you all are wrong! Not only will Ye Yuan not become our enemy, but he’ll also become our most powerful ally instead! Or should I say, he’ll forever be the Priest Temple’s Second Sage!”

Second Disciple was perplexed as he said, “Master, this is impossible! Such a conceited person, this disciple has seen before no idea how many. How can this kind of person possibly become our ally?”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest gave him a glance and said, “What Ye Yuan said, each word is a gem! It’s just that you all aren’t able to understand, that’s all! Didn’t you all discover that these few days, Number Seven changed a lot?”

All the disciples were startled, looking toward Ji Mo one after another.

If Sacred Ancestor High Priest did not say, they really would not have noticed it.

With him saying this, they noticed that it was really true!

These few years, not mentioning about Ji Mo’s great improvement in strength, his entire person’s temperament and aura also changed greatly.

Could it be that these changes were all because of Ye Yuan?

This shock was by no means insignificant.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest smiled and said, “Not only is Ye Yuan not disrespectful toward me, but he’s actually very respectful toward me! I didn’t choose him because I want him to be obsequious in front of me, but because I want him to become a true powerhouse. I want him to help me break the shackles!”

“He doesn’t owe me anything. For him to be able to have today’s achievements, it was by relying on his powerful willpower and strength!”

“From that moment he sat opposite me, our confrontation is considered to have officially begun! Every movement, every word, even action, are all a competition between us. Since it’s a competition, then one can’t lose on aura! If he’s reverent and respectful in front of me, then there’s no need to compete. He already lost!”

“What Ye Yuan said is right. He can sit opposite me calmly, but you guys? Which of you can sit in front of me and regard with equanimity, drink tea calmly, and debate on Dao?”

The group of disciples all had ashamed looks on their faces. What their master said was right. Making them sit opposite him and drink tea indifferently and calmly, none of them could do it!

Even the Eldest Disciple, High Priest Green Nether, who followed their master the longest, could not do it too!

Sacred Ancestor High Priest smiled and said, “This is the first lesson that Second Sage taught you guys. Think about it properly! His appearance might be a turning point in your lives!”

Everyone’s hearts suddenly trembled. No wonder their master brought all of them with him.

At first, they even thought that it was bringing them to witness the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference. Only now did they suddenly come to realize the truth. It turned out that it was for Ye Yuan!

Their master’s action was well-intentioned!

Sacred Ancestor High Priest poured tea for Ye Yuan and said smilingly, “Huhu, I naturally know that you have this potential and strength. Except, I won’t lose either!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Losing and winning is very important, but it’s also not important! Losing, need to see if the loss is worthwhile or not!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest gave Ye Yuan a meaningful glance and let out a sigh as he said, “You’re stronger than me! This logic, I only understood it after a very, very long time. But it looks like you’re already prepared.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Understanding now isn’t too late either! The strong will always become braver in the face of setbacks!”
