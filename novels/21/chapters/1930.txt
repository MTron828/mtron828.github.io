Chapter 1934: Springwind Hall’s Methods

“Younger Brother Ye, this matter was all my fault. This Jiang apologizes to you again here. I know that killing this damn thing isn’t sufficient to appease Younger Brother Ye’s wrath either, and so I specially brought some gifts as compensation.”

As he said, Jiang Yuan clapped his hands. Several servants carried a big pile of things up.

“Younger Brother Ye, this is the list of gifts. Please kindly accept them.”

As he said, Jiang Yuan handed over a long red list. Looking at the appearance, there were probably no less than a hundred items on it.

When Ning Tianping saw Ye Yuan nod his head, he went forward to receive the list.

Sweeping his gaze through, he could not help being flabbergasted.

Terrific fellow, this guy, was called he who had wealth speaks louder than others.

The gifts on the list, not one was not a treasure, worth several cities.

Ning Tianping marveled at Springwind Hall’s extravagance in his heart. Of course, he marveled even more at his own lord’s impressiveness.

Such a major hall like the Springwind Hall actually rushed to come and apologize.

Putting aside killing Jiang Hua, they even compensated with so many things.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Then this Ye will thank Elder Jiang.”

Jiang Yuan hurriedly said, “Not at all! This Jiang still has to thank Younger Brother Ye for being magnanimous and letting bygones be bygones!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Alright, this matter ends here, you and I are squared. Hall Master Mu, Elder Jiang, please!”

Although Ye Yuan had not entered the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion yet, everyone knew that this was already a sure bet.

The status of an alchemy celestial elder was a very special influence above that of the various major hall masters.

Hence, Ye Yuan had this confidence now.

The current Ye Yuan already did not need to cooperate with Springwind Hall anymore.

In reality, the hall masters of Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital’s other three major Myriad Treasure Tower halls already sent people to get into contact with Ye Yuan.

Not just the three major halls, some other major forces also racked their brains, wanting to work together with Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan had long let out the news. With his current identity, the forces that wanted to cooperate with him could be easily found. He naturally had no need to work together with the Springwind Hall that he had a grudge with anymore.

Seeing Ye Yuan directly send them out, Jiang Yuan’s expression could not help changing.

They delivered such a big gift, it was naturally not just to make up with Ye Yuan so simple.

Hearing that Ye Yuan let out the news concerning people’s interest in collaborating with him, Jiang Yuan wished to kill Jiang Hua a thousand times over.

This damn thing really bungled matters!

With Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao strength, this sort of cooperation would absolutely be greatly beneficial to the Springwind Hall.

What did some spirit medicines count for? What was truly hard to seek were high-quality medicinal pills! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A level eight difficulty vast spirit divine pill, the value was thousands of times, even ten thousand times of the spirit medicines itself!

More importantly, this quality of medicinal pills, barely anyone could refine it.

As long as they cooperated with Ye Yuan, Springwind Hall would be equivalent to monopolizing the market of high-quality medicinal pills.

Whoever wanted to request for pills would have to go through their Springwind Hall.

This way, their Springwind Hall’s status would soar, flinging the other halls far behind.

This significance was out of the ordinary!

Sadly, it was all ruined by Jiang Hua that bastard.

Originally in a favorable position, but now, it was far away in the horizon.

Jiang Yuan looked at Mu Feng rather anxiously, but the fatty hall master smiled slightly and said, “Little Friend Ye, I actually came today because I wanted to introduce you to someone.”

This fatty had a smiling face all day long, but Ye Yuan could sense that he was a formidable character.

Not talking about other things, for this fatty to be able to apologize to him in front of so many people, this was not what ordinary people could do.

After all, his identity was not ordinary.

If not for Mu Feng’s attitude, Ye Yuan also would not possibly drop this matter easily.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Hall Master Mu, your honorable hall and this Ye’s affairs are already squared. This Ye doesn’t wish to have any more ties with your honorable hall. Hall Master Mu’s good intentions, this Ye appreciates it, but as for getting to know this person ... best forget about it.”

Springwind Hall’s overbearing style, Ye Yuan had already experienced it many times.

No matter what Mu Feng did, that unpleasantness in Ye Yuan’s heart was not so easy to wipe away.

But Mu Feng smiled and said, “Little Friend Ye, don’t refuse me so quickly. This person, you definitely want to become acquainted.”

Ye Yuan was just about to refuse once more, but two figures walked right over.

“Ye Yuan!” The arrival was all smiles, his aged face even seemingly much younger.

“Brother Xiao? You ...” Ye Yuan was surprised.

The arrival was none other than precisely Xiao Feng. There was also a white-haired old man who came over together with him.

A few days ago, Xiao Feng suddenly said that he had business and immediately left. But today, he brought back an old man.

“Ye Yuan, I ...” Xiao Feng was somewhat abashed, seemingly having a bone in his throat.

Mu Feng smiled and said, “Little Friend Ye, let me re-introduce to you; Xiao Feng is our Springwind Hall’s high-level protector now. Also, this Mr. Lu Zhe is presently also my Springwind Hall’s elder.”

Ye Yuan immediately understood; this fatty indeed had ulterior motives!

But Ye Yuan was also filled with emotions at this fatty’s impressive methods, to actually think of making a move on the Xiao Feng by his side.

Xiao Feng was merely a measly little low-level deacon. There was still a distance of 108,000 miles away from being a protector.

High-level protector, that was a position that only Celestial Deity Realms could take on. Xiao Feng could be said to have ascended to the heavens in one step.

Ye Yuan finally knew why Xiao Feng was embarrassed. Turns out that he accepted Springwind Hall’s arrangements and was afraid that Ye Yuan would be unhappy, that was why he would be like this.

However, Mu Feng’s method, he really did not have any temper.

Ye Yuan understood Xiao Feng’s feelings toward Springwind Hall. Although he was on very friendly terms with him, his sense of belonging to Springwind Hall was also extremely strong.

One could say that Springwind Hall was his home.

Moreover, there was even a Lu Zhe who was conveniently brought along.

Now, with this layer of relationship, apart from choosing Springwind Hall, who else could Ye Yuan choose?

“Huhu, congratulations to Brother Xiao on your promotion. Ye Yuan pays respect to Elder Lu. The matter previously, thank you very much, Elder Lu,” Ye Yuan said and clasped his hands.

Within reason and favor, Ye Yuan owed Lu Zhe a favor. He had always remembered it in his heart.

Lu Zhe hurriedly said, “Master Ye is too courteous, it was merely the effort of lifting a finger. Furthermore, this old man’s face is meager and can’t be of much help. I’ve incurred Master Ye’s ridicule.”

Ye Yuan’s identity, Lu Zhe had long learned about it from Xiao Feng.

In front of Ye Yuan, he naturally did not dare to take advantage of his seniority.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s not that Elder Lu didn’t have the prestige, but it was just a despicable villain blocking the path. I have several medicinal pills here. Elder Lu, please kindly accept them.”

As he said, Ye Yuan took out several small bottles and passed them over.

Elder Lu’s expression could not help changing drastically when he saw and hurriedly turned it down, “I can’t accept rewards without making any contributions. Master Ye, these medicinal pills are too precious.”

Ye Yuan could tell that this Elder Lu had death qi revolving around his face. Clearly, his longevity was almost depleted, so he gave him some longevity extending medicinal pills.

With Ye Yuan’s means, what he took out was naturally not ordinary goods. How could Lu Zhe dare accept it?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Elder Lu, disregarding that you’ve helped me before, Brother Xiao and I regard each other as brothers. You’re his master, and naturally also this Ye’s senior. If you don’t accept it, that’s looking down on this Ye.”

Only when Xiao Feng heard this did his heart ease up, knowing that Ye Yuan did not get angry. He also urged, “Master, accept it.”

Lu Zhe saw that Ye Yuan already put it like this and could only accept it.
