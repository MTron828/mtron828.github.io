Chapter 1493 Special-Grade Retainer

After the contract entered his hands, a powerful law undulation came from it, making Ye Yuan secretly alarmed.

No idea whose hands this contract originated from, but that person’s strength was definitely very powerful.

Ye Yuan’s divine sense entered inside. The contents of the contract revealed itself.

He carefully analyzed the contents of the contract. After verifying that there was no problem, only then did he slowly say, “No problem. Now, can I ask for the information that I want to know?”

Yi Han smiled and said, “Of course you can! You can just directly ask the contract, the contract will automatically determine the grade of your question. Drip your blood essence on the contract and the information that you want to know will appear on it.”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and asked the contract, “A million years ago, Capone Capital City had a fiend commander called Kanuo. I want to know who sent him to carry out the last mission, as well as all of the information for that person!”

After asking this, the contract had a reaction very quickly. A large word gradually appeared on it: Eight.

A hint of surprise flashed across Ye Yuan’s face. He did not expect that this information’s grade was actually so high!

But seeing that ‘eight’ word on the contract, Yi Han was all smiles and said, “Hehe, didn’t expect that Sir Source Night’s information is actually so valuable. Looks like ... this favor isn’t small.”

From fourth-grade to ninth-grade, the contents of the contract were naturally different.

Fourth-grade was still relatively easy to return. Ninth-grade ... it would probably be a favor to drive one to their death.

If someone checked for information not matching their own strength, that price might be death.

Yi Han looked at Ye Yuan rather interestedly, wanting to see how he choose.

However, she was a little disappointed.

She completely could not see through Ye Yuan’s inner-heart activity, as if what Ye Yuan held in his hand was a piece of blank paper.

Suddenly, a cold light flashed. The tip of Ye Yuan’s finger had a gash cut open. A drop of golden blood slowly fell, dripping onto the contract.

The golden blood instantly disappeared. Very soon, densely packed words appeared on the contract.

Ye Yuan rapidly browsed it over, but the expression on his face became ugly.

Sure enough, the one who sent Kanuo to the Immortal Grove World was precisely that generation’s city lord, called Ka Suo.

It was just that not only did this Ka Suo not die, he already broke through from the second-layered heaven Fiend Lord back then to the current Fiend King first-layered heaven, which was also the human race’s Celestial Deity first-layered heaven!

After one’s Martial Dao broke through to Divine Lord Realm, it was entering a whole new realm. Each step would become even more difficult.

Each major realm was divided into nine heavens.

Each breakthrough of a minor realm was exceedingly difficult, easily starting with 100 thousand years.

Presently, a million years had passed. That Ka Suo’s strength steadily increased and actually already reached the Fiend King Realm!

Looks like wanting to find this Ka Suo to settle scores, I have to give the matter further thought and consideration. Ye Yuan secretly sighed in his heart.

This Ka Sou had already left Capone Capital City long ago. Right now, he was at Eminent Orchid Imperial City, wielding immense authority.

Apart from these, there were still many intel related to Ka Suo. This information was indeed very valuable, worthy of being an eighth-grade contract.

However, Ye Yuan was also secretly shocked and had an even clearer understanding of this Blood Yama Hall’s strength.

Even a Fiend King powerhouse’s information could be recorded so comprehensively, this was clearly not what an ordinary power could do.

After Ye Yuan silently noted down Ka Suo’s information, the words on the contract gradually disappeared.

And Ye Yuan distinctly sensed that there was a kind of mysterious connection established between him and the contract.

“Looks like Sir Source Night is very disappointed!” Yi Han said with a smile.

Ye Yuan returned the contract to Yi Han and said indifferently, “Indeed a little disappointed. But, it’s nothing as well.”

He indeed did not care. There would come a day where he would step into Celestial Deity Realm and seek justice for the Immortal Grove World.

“Huhu, Sir Source Night doesn’t care, but Yi Han cares a lot! I have a feeling that Sir Source Night’s favor is much more valuable than this information! As for fiend essence stones, just take it as Yi Han becoming friends with Sir, forget about it,” Yi Han said with a broad smile.

Ye Yuan glanced at her and said coolly, “Becoming friends with Miss Yi Han, one has to become more vigilant.”

Yi Han giggled and said, “Is Sir praising Yi Han here?”

Ye Yuan said, “You can understand it like that.”

Yi Han’s strength was unfathomable. This Blood Yama Hall was even more mysterious and hard to fathom. Becoming friends with them, one would probably not even know when they were sold.

...

Returning to the Fan Family, Fan Yu was naturally inexplicably grateful toward Ye Yuan.

The Fan Family heard that a very powerful Fiend Apothecary appeared in the family and burst into an uproar all at once.

The Fan Family immediately convened an elders meeting and raised Ye Yuan to a special-grade retainer.

The treatment that Ye Yuan enjoyed in the Fan Family could virtually rival Fiend Commander Realm elders already.

Those people who said that Ye Yuan relied on a woman to get his position immediately shut up, all extremely flustered.

Offending a Fiend Apothecary retainer was not some wise thing.

Medicinal pills, who did not need it?

The Fan Family could not be blamed for going through so much trouble. It was true that fiend apothecaries were too in demand in the fiend race. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

With the status of Fiend Apothecaries, they did not stoop to go to some large family to be retainers at all.

Otherwise, the Fan Family also would not be so cautious because of a batch of medicinal pills.

The news of a Fiend Apothecary emerging in the Fan Family immediately spread throughout the entire capital city like the wind.

The other three families, including the City Lord Manor, were all envious about this to the extreme.

Of course, if there were people envious, there were people unhappy.

When Ka Xin heard this news, his entire person went blank.

“Damn it! How can that brat possibly be a Two-star Fiend Apothecary? The important person that Meng Qi saw that day was actually him! This ... How is this possible?”

Ka Xin was full of indignation and puzzlement. He seriously could not figure out how a young man with such powerful martial arts strength could possibly become a Fiend Apothecary that even Meng Qi bowed his head in submission to!

Lian Hua’s face was also full of shock. She did not expect that Ye Yuan was a Fiend Apothecary. Furthermore, even the Fiend Medicine Hall’s five elders were actually docile and obedient towards him to this extent.

Originally, she was just harboring the thought of teasing a little, that was why she would be like that toward Ye Yuan.

Now, she was really envious of Li Ji to death.

If she had long known it was like this, she should have thought of everything possible to snatch Source Night!

But now, it was too late to say anything. Source Night and Ka Xin were already like fire and water. It was completely impossible to bury the hatchet anymore.

She let out a sigh and said, “This matter is already beyond all doubt! The Assassination Hall took our bounty to assassinate Source Night, but it was stopped by the Fiend Medicine Hall’s five elders. It was said that for this, the Fiend Medicine Hall already went to war with the Assassination Hall, cutting off all of their medicinal pills supply. I reckon that within a few days, the Assassination Hall will have to yield. Meng Qi clearly doesn’t have this authority. For the Fiend Medicine Hall to do so, they definitely obtained the hall master’s approval! Waging war with their own family for an outsider, this matter of thing, even thinking about it feels inconceivable.”

Ka Xin’s expression was green and already did not know what he should say.

He discovered to his dismay that he seemed to have really kicked a metal plate this time!

Lian Hua paused for a bit and continued, “To be able to make the Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master do this, that Source Night’s alchemy skills must be extremely remarkable! The Fan Family picked up a treasure this time!”
