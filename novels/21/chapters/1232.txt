Chapter 1236: Accidentally Entering the Peach Blossom Forest

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Flying rock!”

The stoneman in the lead position suddenly shouted. The group of stonemen all stopped.

But saw them seemingly perform conjuring tricks, plucking off a piece of stone from their bodies, lifting their hands, and throwing it over towards Ye Yuan and the rest.

A terrifying undulation came over from behind. Ye Yuan could only stop his footsteps and answer the challenge.

Over a dozen rocks arrived with a howl, akin to arrows whistling through the air.

Ye Yuan’s face fell, the Evil Extermination Sword suddenly striking.

“Fury Sword Fire Lotus!”

Clank! Clank! Clank!

A series of metal clashing sounds came over. The Evil Extermination Sword crossed swords with those rock chunks, scraping out fierce sparks.

Ye Yuan’s figure received a tremendous impact and glided back several thousand feet before barely managing to stabilize his figure.

Even if his fleshy body was powerful, the webbing between his thumb and index finger was also shocked until it went numb.

Except, with this delay, the four people already had their retreat paths utterly blocked off by the ten stonemen.

“Lu-er, enter the Vast Heaven Pagoda,” Ye Yuan said.

Although unwilling, Lu-er also knew that this battle was already not what she could take part in.

Putting Lu-er away inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda, Ye Yuan said to Li-er and White Light, “You guys, two each. Leave the rest to me! Don’t cling to the battle, once there’s a chance, immediately run!”

“Ignorant human, do you think that you guys still have the chance to escape?” said a stoneman.

Ye Yuan’s face turned dark, and he said to the stonemen, “We were just passing through your honorable land and had no intentions of offending. Why does your esteemed self pursue so relentlessly?”

The stoneman gave a cold snort and said, “Humans, there’s not a good one! Enough crap, offer up your life!”

These stonemen seemed to have an immense grudge toward humans. Without listening to any explanations at all, they made a move straight away.

Those stonemen punched out like the wind. Each and every move actually carried the power of Divine Dao laws.

Ye Yuan even suspected whether or not these guys were genuine Deity Realm powerhouses in the Divine Dao Era!

However, these ten stonemen’s strength, it was clear that one in the front whose strength was the greatest.

The others, their strengths were a notch inferior to him.

If every one of them were so powerful, it would probably be hard for Li-er and White Light to have chances of winning.

But even if there were just two, it was also very taxing for the two people to cope with it.

What was damnable was that these guys’ defenses were seriously too perverse. Even receiving one of Ye Yuan’s Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm, it was also merely being knocked over onto the ground.

Those guys prepared for a bit and plunged into the battle again like they were completely fine.

Golden light flickered on Ye Yuan’s body. Relying on the power of the fleshy body and getting into a fierce battle with six stonemen, there was actually no distinction of superiority or inferiority for some time.

Although those stonemen were strong, they were unable to break through the limits of Divine Dao too.

Ye Yuan was already increasingly closer to grand completion at present. In the entire Divine Realm, it could be said that his strength was second only to Fang Tian.

But at the rate of this declining trend, he was fine, but Li-er and White Light were bound to find it hard to sustain for long.

“No way, got to think of a way to leave. At this time, we’ll be pummeled by them into meat paste sooner or later.”

Ye Yuan thought in his heart and suddenly arrived beside Li-er with greater teleportation.

“Li-er, wait for me ahead!”

While talking, Ye Yuan’s both palms struck out. Two Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palms gushed out, directly striking two stonemen flying out.

Li-er and Ye Yuan already did not need much communication long ago, understanding without many words, and leaped out with a bound.

“White Light!”

Ye Yuan shouted loudly. White Light similarly understood tacitly.

It was only to see him suddenly roared out. A punch suddenly rumbled out.

“Fierce Tiger Heavenly Tyrant Fist!”

A terrifying white tiger phantom appeared, forcefully repelling the two stonemen back over a dozen steps.

Borrowing the recoil strength, White Light’s figure sped away hastily, chasing after Li-er’s footsteps and leaving the battlefield.

All of this happened in the time it took for a spark to fly off a piece of flint. Those stonemen had yet to catch up, but they already heard a dragon roar surged to the sky!

“Voice of the Dragon God!”

Ye Yuan used his ace in the hole. Within this area, it attacked indiscriminately!

The figures of the ten stonemen immediately stiffened there quiveringly!

These stonemen simply had no weaknesses to exploit. Regardless whether was it essence energy martial techniques or body-refinement martial techniques, it virtually had no effect on them.

Only this Voice of the Dragon God that crushed everything had an effect on them!

Bang ... Boom ... Boom ...

Those stonemen’s bodies were completely piled up using rocks. But at this time, those rocks were actually falling apart!

Boom!

Finally, a stoneman could not withstand the Voice of the Dragon God’s power, his entire body collapsed with a loud bang, disintegrating directly!

Rumble! Rumble!

One stonemen after another was dismantled by the Voice of the Dragon God just like that. Even that strongest one was no exception either.

One breath, two breaths!

Ten stonemen were all shocked by the Voice of the Dragon into piles of rock debris.

Huff huff ...

Ye Yuan panted heavily for air; the feeling of his entire body aching immediately hit.

Unless there was no other option, he was really unwilling to deploy this martial technique.

Powerful was powerful, it was just that the sequela of using it was also rather agonizing.

At this time, he only wished to find a place and have a good sleep.

He took a look at those shattered rock pieces and was just about to leave, but all of a sudden, his face changed.

Those shattered rubble pieces actually started moving on its own! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Under Ye Yuan’s dumbfounded gaze, those rocks actually pieced together once more!

Could these guys be of undying bodies?

His Voice of the Dragon God was even able to shock Yue Ji to death, but it actually could not shock these stonemen to death!

“@#¥¥%% ...”

Ye Yuan could not refrain from swearing. Dragging his exhausted body, he hurried away from here.

When these guys finished piecing together, he would not even be able to run.

Ahead, Li-er and White Light were currently waiting for Ye Yuan. Seeing Ye Yuan’s appearance, they hurriedly went forward to support him.

“How is it, Big Brother? Even the Void of the Dragon God was used. Those clunks should all be shattered already, right?” White Light said with a smile.

Speechlessly, Ye Yuan said, “Quickly leave! Still don’t go, it will be too late!”

Ye Yuan’s words made the two people’s faces change drastically.

With the way Ye Yuan was currently, how could they still be those ten stonemen’s match?

At once, without the slightest hesitation, they brought Ye Yuan and fled speedily.

“Big Brother, this ... What in the world is going on?” White Light said in bewilderment.

Ye Yuan’s expression was very ugly, recounting the events that just transpired. The two people were both speechless.

Those stonemen were a bit too freakish, right?

“Big Brother, there’s a peach blossom forest ahead!” White Light suddenly said.

“Go in!” Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, directly instructing White Light to enter the peach blossom forest.

However, the miraculous thing was that the stonemen pursued relentlessly, but after they saw that they entered this forest, they actually did not chase inside anymore!”

“Lord Stonebrave, this human is so strong! That roar could actually dismantle us!” A stoneman said to the leader.

Stonebrave said, “This human is rather extraordinary! That roar earlier seems like the Voice of the Dragon God of the legends! Strange, he’s clearly a human, why would he know the dragon race’s paramount martial technique? Forget it, since they entered this peach blossom forest, they definitely can’t come out anymore. Don’t need to care about them anymore, let’s go back. Recently, the abnormalities in the Godsfall Mountain Range are quite a few. Most likely, Patriarch is also going to wake up.”
