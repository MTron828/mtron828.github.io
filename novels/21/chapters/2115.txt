Chapter 2119: Mysterious Long Xiaochun

“Remember, if those Qilin Clan’s old fellows come to find trouble with you, you just report my name: Long Xiaochun!”

This sentence echoed in Ye Yuan’s mind.

Originally, Ye Yuan just took it as a joke. But looking at it now, it was not the case.

This girl’s identity was very extraordinary!

Furthermore, what was the deal with that horrifying strange power just now?

Ye Yuan also did not expect that this little girl was actually already a rank seven powerhouse at a young age!

But even if it was a rank seven powerhouse, the power of that punch earlier was also too terrifying.

Heavenly Emperor Zixu looked at Long Zhi, his expression slightly dark as he said, “Is your Dragon Clan going to intervene in this matter? Since this emperor appeared here, you should know my clan’s attitude. Is it worth it for a mere human True God Realm?”

Heavenly Emperors did not easily wade into the mortal world, let alone an existence like Heavenly Emperor Zixu?

Since Heavenly Emperor Zixu came, that represented that the Qilin Clan already regarded this matter very importantly.

If the Dragon Clan intervened in this matter, it would surely aggravate the Qilin Clan’s upper echelon.

This was something to be very afraid of to the two clans.

Long Zhi was just about to speak, but he noticed Long Xiaochun put her hands by the side of her waist, and then she said, “Humph! Don’t talk about whatever Dragon Clan, Qilin Clan, Today’s matter, this young lady is butting in for sure! Ye Yuan is my good friend. So if you dare to touch him, this young lady will show you!”

Long Zhi cried bitterness in his heart, he wished to block this little girl’s mouth.

This one in front of him was the Qilin Clan’s Heavenly Emperor Zixu, a Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor horrifying existence!

This kind of powerhouse was a peerless powerhouse that could rule over a region.

With him coming, what it represented was the Qilin Clan’s face and attitude.

Hence, that was why he would forcefully suppress Ye Yuan, attempting to gain back face for the Qilin Clan.

It was just a shame that just as he was about to succeed, Long Xiaochun suddenly popped out, making him fall short of success.

“Huhu, very good! Looks like your Dragon Clan thinks that my Qilin Clan is easy to bully! Since that’s the case, don’t blame this emperor for going on a killing spree!” Heavenly Emperor Zixu laughed from extreme fury when he heard that.

At the same time, the Heavenly Emperor’s pressure on his body instantly covered the entire world akin to the thunderclouds in the sky.

The moment his world power released, heaven and earth changed colors.

The world power of a Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor was too strong!

Even Long Zhi’s expression also became incomparably ugly, and he said in a solemn voice, “Lord Zixu, my Dragon Clan has no intention of intervening in this matter! Long Zhi will bring Xiaochun away right now.”

At the same time, Long Xiaochun also put away the teasing look on her face and said seriously, “Uncle Zhi, I’m not going! Ye Yuan is my Long Xiaochun’s friend! I, Long Xiaochun, won’t abandon my friend! If you dare to forcefully bring me away, I’ll cry for you to see!”

Although the current sight was incomparably serious, the numerous demon race powerhouses in the city were still tickled by Long Xiaochun.

Ye Yuan also found it funny, this lass’ way of blackmailing people was also too unique, right?

Looks like it was really a little princess!

But Long Zhi’s face revealed an incomparably serious expression.

“Don’t, don’t, don’t! My great-grandaunt, you mustn’t cry! Sigh, I really can’t do anything about you!”

Long Zhi sighed slightly and turned to Heavenly Emperor Zixu and said, “Lord Zixu, this matter ... your esteemed clan please lift your hand high in mercy and let this little brother off. As for Xiaochun, you can’t afford to provoke her. Better withdraw. Otherwise ... you’d be the chief culprit of launching a divine war!’

The moment ‘divine war’ two words came out, everyone’s faces changed drastically.

These two words represented destruction!

“Divine war, that’s the tangled warfare of late-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses! With these two clans’ strength, there might even be Transcendent Heavenly Emperors taking part. At that time, the entire pseudo world will probably be collapsed, right?”

“Divine war! Who on earth is this little lass? The Dragon Clan actually won’t scruple to launch a divine war for her?”

“Maybe it is just to scare people, right? That Dragon Clan’s Heavenly Emperor wants to use these two words to scare away Heavenly Emperor Zixu?”

... ...

The power of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses was too terrifying, especially late-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses. With every movement and action, they had the power to destroy heaven and obliterate the earth.

Back then when Ye Yuan used the Heaven Shocking Lightning, the strike of a Heavenly Emperor directly leveled a radius of ten thousand miles to the ground.

Jiu Luo Ji that was several tens of thousands of miles away also suffered a powerful secondary impact.

That kind of power was really too frightening.

Once a divine war was launched, it would surely be fought until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open and the people plunged into misery and suffering.

It was also precisely so that Heavenly Emperor powerhouses would maintain relative restraint and not easily enter the mundane world, and only move around in the Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda that they opened up.

Now, Long Zhi actually said that the Dragon Clan was going to launch a divine war for this little girl!

By the side, Ye Yuan observed with cool detachment, but monstrous waves already set off in his heart.

He felt that Long Xiaochun’s threat was only joking around just now, but looking at it now, it was not ordinary!

Long Xiaochun definitely had an extremely important position in the Dragon Clan.

He did not expect that this artless and childlike little girl was actually so unfathomable.

Even Heavenly Emperor Zixu was also stunned by Long Zhi’s words.

Qi Zhen’s status in the Qilin Clan was indeed extremely high, but it also did not reach the extent of launching a divine war.

The Qilin Clan sending him this time, more importantly, it was still for the sake of obtaining the emperor bone.

But this unassuming little lass actually had such an important status?

Kill? Or not to kill?

Heavenly Emperor Zixu actually fell into hesitation.

After all, the significance of ‘divine war’, these two words, was exceptional.

Once the Dragon Clan and Qilin Clan started a divine war, it would probably engulf the entire Demon Divine Region.

With the two clans’ strength, the casualties would definitely be very tragic. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Arriving in the mortal world, he was a supreme Heavenly Emperor hegemon.

But in front of the two clans’ top major powers, he was still inadequate to look at.

He could not shoulder ‘divine war’ two words!

Heavenly Emperor Zixu was not worried that Long Zhi was lying. No Heavenly Emperor powerhouse dared to use divine war, this kind of word, to threaten the other party.

Furthermore, looking at the clues and inklings, Long Xiaochun this little girl seemed to really be exceptional.

“Forget it, looking on the account of the Dragon Clan, I’ll spare your dog life! But you have to be more careful. Maybe some day, my Qilin Clan will come and take your life. You don’t be so lucky every time,” Heavenly Emperor Zixu finally heaved a sigh and looked at Ye Yuan as he said coolly.

Everyone looked at the sky in disbelief. Heavenly Emperor Zixu actually gave up just like that.

With Heavenly Emperor Zixu leaving, it would also be equivalent to Ye Yuan slapping their faces for nothing. The Qilin Clan was considered to have swallowed the insult and humiliation silently.

With the Qilin Clan’s pride, they were actually able to stomach this insult.

It seemed like the deterrence of ‘divine war’ two words was really huge!

Long Zhi also let out a slight sigh in relief but shot Long Xiaochun a fierce glare. The latter rolled her eyes and turned her head around, completely ignoring him.

When Long Zhi saw the situation, he could not help feeling stifled.

Heavenly Emperor Zixu turned around and arrived beside the emperor bone.

But right at this time, there was a ripple in the void. A figure stepped out of the void first and grabbed the emperor bone.

“Dao mark! You can actually control Dao mark!”

Heavenly Emperor Zixu’s eyes turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “Humph! This emperor already spared your life, but you actually still want to take away the emperor bone?”
