Chapter 1731 Really Can“t Find a Sixth One

Luo Yong’s eyes lit up. The corners of his mouth revealed a hint of a smile like his wicked scheme succeeded.

While Duan Peng and the rest revealed looks of surprise.

This kid had some nerves!

Rather, it was Yu Jing who said rather anxiously, “Ye Yuan, you mustn’t act without due consideration!”

Ye Yuan looked at her and said with a smile, “Merely a Raging Fire Centipede, no big deal. Why not Elder Sister Jing stand guard for me, how’s that?”

Yu Jing thought about it but still nodded her head.

Ye Yuan did not talk rubbish either, taking out the Junyi Sword and slowly walked over toward the Raging Fire Centipede.

Seeing the Junyi Sword, the eyes of Duan Peng, Luo Yong, and the rest involuntarily turned sharp.

High-rank divine lord mystic treasure!

This kid indeed had some background.

Especially Luo Yong, his eyes revealed a greedy look.

Even though he was already Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, he only had an initial-rank divine lord mystic treasure on hand.

Compared to Ye Yuan, he was simply like a beggar.

Ye Yuan walked over toward the Raging Fire Centipede unhurriedly, without the least bit of pressure.

“Click click.”

The centipede emitted a series of strange chirping sounds and suddenly turned around, tunneling into the woods.

Luo Yong’s eyes went wide, caught somewhat off-guard by this sudden change.

The Raging Fire Centipede actually ran?

Facing a Third Firmament Divine Lord human, it actually ran?

One had to know, the strengths of fierce beasts were normally stronger than humans of the same rank.

Moreover, uncivilized fierce beasts, under the situation where the power gap was not too big, would not know what was called fear at all.

For example, when the Raging Fire Centipede clearly saw that there were five to six humans here just now, it still planned to attack them.

Now, what was going on?

“Where are you running!”

Just as they were in shock, Ye Yuan’s figure moved, tunneling into the forest.

Everyone was taken aback once more, this kid’s gall was so fat!

“Ye Yuan, don’t chase!”

Yu Jing’s expression changed drastically, immediately carrying her sword and chasing after.

But passing through the dense forest, how was there still Ye Yuan’s figure?

Yu Jing did not give up and chased ahead again.

Luo Yong came back to his senses, his face revealing a radiant smile.

This kid was really courting death himself!

“What’s wrong with that Raging Fire Centipede? Why would it run when it saw Ye Yuan?” Duan Peng said with a look of confusion.

Luo Yong smiled and said, “What else can it be? It must have unlocked a hint of wisdom and perceived that we weren’t to be trifled with, that’s why it would run away.”

Duan Peng nodded and said, “It’s likely the case! It’s just that ... Ye Yuan chasing after like this is very dangerous. I hope that Yu Jing can find him.”

Luo Yong naturally did not hope for Ye Yuan to return and said with a smile, “That brat was indeed a hothead. If he wants to seek death himself, can’t blame others.”

Duan Peng also shook his head, feeling that Ye Yuan’s foolish actions were rather unreasonable.

Even though he disliked Luo Yong, what Luo Yong said was right as well.

This Ye Yuan did not have any self-awareness at all. If he died, he could not blame others either.

Before long, Yu Jing dashed out of the dense woods, her expression very ugly.

“How is it? Found him?”

Even though he knew the result, he still asked.

Duan Peng could tell that Yu Jing was very concerned about this little brother.

Yu Jing shook her head rather blankly, her entire person like she was drained.

Luo Yong was secretly pleased in his heart and said, “No need to care about that kid anymore, at this time, he’s most likely already swallowed by the Raging Fire Centipede. Let’s continue walking.”

When Yu Jing heard this, she said in annoyance, “Luo Yong, what do you mean? You treat your companions like this? If you abandon Ye Yuan now, will you immediately leave us behind if we encounter danger later?”

Luo Yong could not help choking when he heard that, his expression ugly as he said, “H-How can it be? That kid overestimated his own ability and chased after himself. I didn’t force him to go either.”

Leaving behind one’s companions was a taboo to them. This was an unspoken rule among squads that frequently came to the area.

Once the reputation spread, no one would dare to use them in the future anymore.

One person entering the mountain, the danger was also too great.

Yu Jing’s words somewhat unmasked his motives, Luo Yong really did not dare to follow up.

“Boss Duan, I request to wait here for Ye Yuan!” Yu Jing looked at Duan Peng and said with a serious expression.

Duan Peng thought about it and said with a nod, “Then we will wait an hour for him then! If he still isn’t here in an hour, we’ll have to carry on our way.”

“No need, I’m back!”

Yu Jing still wanted to say something when a voice suddenly sounded out. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Everyone followed the voice and looked over, and saw Ye Yuan slowly walk out of the dense forest.

Suddenly, everyone’s gaze turned intent, all revealing a look of shock.

It was only to see that after Ye Yuan walked out, a huge centipede came out from behind.

The centipede was being dragged by Ye Yuan, already dead until it could not be any deader.

Bang!

Ye Yuan casually threw and threw the Raging Fire Centipede in front of everyone.

Duan Peng said with an astonished look, “This ... This was your doing?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Otherwise? Is there still anyone else?”

Everyone was speechless, the outcome of the matter was too far from their expectations!

Especially Luo Yong, he simply felt even more uncomfortable than having eaten a fly.

Originally, he already sentenced Ye Yuan to death, being delighted and pleased in his heart.

Who knew that in a blink, not only did Ye Yuan return, he even killed the Raging Fire Centipede.

While talking, Ye Yuan took out several bright red fruits and threw them over one by one.

Of course, except for Luo Yong.

Duan Peng caught the fruits, gaze turning intent as he said in surprise, “Rank four spirit medicine Blood Curdle Fruit! You ... Where did you get it from?”

Ye Yuan said, “I chased this beast just now, chased all the way to its lair. After killing it, I searched its lair while I was at it and found these Blood Curdle Fruits. Since everyone is in the same team, of course those who see it will get a share. Also, this Raging Fire Centipede will be given to Boss Duan. The benefits gotten later will be distributed by Boss Duan.”

Although the Blood Curdle Fruit was not some overly rare rank four spirit medicine, casually selling for several billion divine essence stones was still doable.

Ye Yuan was considered to have given them a big gift.

They did not do anything and earned several billion divine essence stones.

Furthermore, this Raging Fire Centipede was also full of treasures from top to bottom.

They previously even thought that Ye Yuan was here to scrape benefits. In a twinkle, Ye Yuan threw them a big bunch of benefits.

Boss Duan looked at Ye Yuan with an astonished face, not expecting Ye Yuan to be so generous.

This made them even more certain that Ye Yuan’s identity was definitely extraordinary.

If it were any of them, they would definitely pocket these things alone. Either way, no one saw it too.

But Ye Yuan actually took them out to share with everyone.

Luo Yang’s expression was gloomy as he said in a solemn voice, “Punk, what’s the meaning of this? Since those who see get a share, why do the rest all have, but I don’t?”

Ye Yuan said with an apologetic look: “Brother Luo, really sorry about it, this Ye only found five Blood Curdle Fruits in its lair just now and really couldn’t find the sixth one. I’m forced to make things a bit inconvenient for Brother Luo. Uh ... if find something later, this Ye will bring Brother Luo to share it.”

With Ye Yuan’s one sentence, everyone all secretly found it funny in their hearts.

These Blood Curdle Fruits were neither more nor less, just nice five. It was also too coincidental, right?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan shared with the rest, only Luo Yong’s was missing. This was definitely no coincidence as well.

Luo Yong had a grim expression as he said, “Humph! Kid, well done! A mere Blood Curdle Fruit, your father doesn’t think anything of it!”
