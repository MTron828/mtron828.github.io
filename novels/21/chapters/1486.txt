Chapter 1490 Double Standards

“Brother Lu He, what’s this? Didn’t you say that Lord Meng Qi isn’t seeing anyone?”

Ka Xin tried his best to make his tone seem calmer, covering up the rage in his heart.

This double standard was also a little too obvious, right?

He had not even left yet! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lu He’s brows furrowed and he said unhappily, “Mn? Your meaning is that I’m lying to you? Why not do this then? After Master comes out, we’ll confront face-to-face?”

Although Ka Xin tried his best to control his tone, the skepticism in his words could not be concealed no matter what.

Lu He’s anger rose up with a puff.

He helped him go in to report. Putting aside that he did not get any benefits, he was even scolded angrily by Master.

Meng Qi did not have just him, one disciple, alone. A single misstep and he fell out of favor, there would be nothing to do with him in the future.

Forget it if Ka Xin was not grateful, he even wanted to question him.

Even a clay bodhisattva had some anger. Lu He finally stopped showing Ka Xin a nice attitude.

Ka Xin said with an awkward look, “Brother Lu He misunderstood. I ...”

Lu He directly cut off his words and said with a cold smile, “I didn’t misunderstand anything! The matter previously, just take it as it didn’t happen. Consider it myself being opinionated. Just treat it as I was careless in making friends. Your Highness Ka Xin, please go back!”

Ka Xin’s expression changed, knowing that this was offending Lu He to the core.

He stood there, unable to leave nor stay.

Lu He said in a cold voice, “Why? Your Highness is not leaving? Could it be that you still want me to send Your Highness out?”

Ka Xin finally left dejectedly. But the grievance nursed in his heart, no one could understand.

With his status and standing, when had he been subjected to this kind of treatment in Capone Capital City before?

The more he thought, the more amiss it felt, and he said in a solemn voice, “There must be something wrong with this! How can the Fan Family and Fiend Medicine Hall’s relationship possibly compare to ours? Today’s incident is too abnormal, I must investigate clearly who Meng Qi was meeting!”

...

Fan Yu followed Lu He to the side-hall with a blank look. Pushing the door and taking a look, he saw an all too familiar figure.

“Li Ji? Why are you here?!” Fan Yu said in surprise.

“Eh? You came too? I ... I was accompanying Source Night to stroll around in the city. He said to come to the Fiend Medicine Hall to take a look and I followed.” Li Ji said with a slightly red face.

“Came with Source Night? Where is he?” Fan Yu said with a dark expression.

This punk, his younger sister accompanied to come out, but he was good, hanging his younger sister out here alone to dry.

But a glimmer of smugness flashed across in Li Ji’s eyes as she said with a smile, “He’s currently chatting with Grandpa Meng Qi! This chat lasted three days and three nights!”

“What?!” Fan Yu nearly jumped up, being taken aback with fright by Li Ji’s sentence.

He turned his head and looked at Lu He, and said with his eyes wide-open, “Brother Lu He, the important guest that you said wouldn’t be Source Night, right?”

Lu He beamed and said, “Who else can it be if not him? Heh, your Fan Family really remained deeply hidden, to have actually invited this kind of big shot and still maintaining your countenance.”

Fan Yu said with a confused look, “B-Big shot?”

Source Night’s strength was indeed not bad, but to say big shot, it was a little too far-fetched, right?

What in the world ... happened in-between this?

Lu He even thought that Fan Yu knew. But looking at it now, he was really kept in a dark.

Li Ji said with a proud face, “Big Brother, I only knew that Source Night was actually even a Fiend Apothecary when I saw Source Night refining pills too! Furthermore, it’s the very formidable kind ...”

Li Ji described the events that happened previously with a look of excitement, making Fan Yu dumbfounded with shock.

His first reaction was, was this Source Night really that Source Night he knew?

Source Night’s age seemed to be even quite a bit younger than him. How could he possibly be a fiend apothecary that even Lord Meng Qi looked up to?

But Li Ji was here, who could that be if not that Source Night?

He originally thought that Meng Qi was meeting some remarkable important person, that was why he would not even give face to Ka Xin.

He did not expect that it was actually Source Night!

No wonder, oh, no wonder!

That excitement when Lu He saw him, turned out that it was because of Source Night!

What kind of character was Fan Yu? He practically reacted to it right away. Lu He being extra familiar with him was treating him as a straw to clutch at.

Previously, because of helping Ka Xin to pass a message, he offended Meng Qi.

But he was Li Ji’s elder brother. Li Ji and Source Night’s relationship was very ambiguous. Meng Qi naturally regarded him as someone very close to Source Night.

This ... Why did it feel like a dream?

...

A full three days had already passed since the Fiend Medicine Hall’s five elders listened to Ye Yuan’s sermon on Dao.

These three day’s time, Meng Qi five people listened like they were in ecstasy and enrapture.

They had never known that pill refining still had so many tricks involved!

Especially when Ye Yuan performed a skill to focus on pill refinement, they used all kinds of methods and also could not distract Ye Yuan in the slightest.

Finally, Ye Yuan still refined a high-level medicinal pill, making them marvel in astonishment.

Only then did they know why Ye Yuan would say that they were weak previously.

They could not even accomplish the most basic focusing, let alone talk about refining high-level medicinal pills.

Ye Yuan also knew that the fiend race’s disposition was hot-tempered. Most were frank without tact. Making him focus on pill refinement was indeed making things a little hard.

But, where there was a will, there was a way. Meng Qi they all failing to do so was primarily still because their method was not right.

Ye Yuan casually imparted some spirit calming and mind focusing spells to them. These old fellows were all akin to having obtained a priceless treasure, endlessly grateful towards Ye Yuan.

Meng Qi was currently in high spirits when Lu He came in and said that Ka Xin was looking for him. How could he not be furious?

Compared to advancing his own alchemy strength, what the hell did Ka Xin count as?!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan seemed to have thought of something and said, “Oh, right, talking nonsense with you all these few days, forgot all about proper business.”

The five elders were rendered speechless. How did this transmission and preaching of Dao become talking nonsense?

Except, the things that Ye Yuan narrated to them were really not that profound.

Similar to focusing, it was alchemists’ basic skills, the five elders all could not do it.

For them to be able to refine complete medicinal pills could not be said to not be a kind of miracle.

Of course, even though Ye Yuan turned his nose up at the five elders’ pill refinement, he could not underestimate fiend apothecaries either.

The fiend race’s alchemy skills also had quite a few saving graces.

“I wonder what the proper business Master Source Night said is? Meng Qi will send people to go and do it right away! I beseech Master Source Night to be generous and preach Dao to us for a few more days!”

Meng Qi was incomparably respectful towards Ye Yuan now. Ye Yuan’s alchemy standard was an existence that he could not look up to at all.

He even felt that those few Three-star fiend apothecaries in the city could not compare to a fraction of Master Source Night too!

Even though they could refine Three-star medicinal pills.

But Ye Yuan said, “Preaching Dao will end here first. Coming to the Fiend Medicine Hall, I just wanted to purchase a few kinds of spirit medicines. In addition, I still have some matters and want to take a trip to the Hundred Knows Hall. You all can’t do it on my behalf.”

The moment Meng Qi said, he hurriedly said, “Isn’t Master Source Night smacking Meng Qi’s face by saying this? Just a few kinds of spirit medicines, what’s there to buy? As long as the Fiend Medicine Hall has it, feel free to take it! If there isn’t, the Fiend Medicine Hall still has the confidence in acquiring it within a short time! As for the Hundred Knows Hall that side, their door isn’t easy to enter. How about this, you take my Blood Yama Token and go. Those guys won’t cause problems for Master!”
