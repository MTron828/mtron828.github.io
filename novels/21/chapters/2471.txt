Chapter 2477: You Can Come and Give It a Try!

“Just what kind of realm did this guy’s divine soul reach? Even extermination lightning actually can’t harm him?” Ancestor Fire opened his mouth wide and said with a shocked face.

“He really is a crazy fellow! He never takes the usual path when breaking through realms!” Lin Chaotian said with an ugly expression.

While Tian Qing’s brows furrowed slightly and he said with vicissitudes of emotion, “Really damn it! He’s making use of extermination lightning to temper his fleshy body, and break through the divine essence realm at the same time! This guy’s monstrousness is really unreasonable!”

Apart from Ye Yuan, no one dared to play like this.

The high and mighty Dao Ancestors could not; he, a Ten-marks powerhouse, similarly could not.

Extermination lightning, capable of destroying everything!

Even though they were paramount existences, in front of heavenly might, they were still incomparably insignificant.

The expressions on the faces of the groups of old ancestors were incomparably complicated, completely unable to describe their current feelings.

An earth-shattering great battle that had already been planned for a long time, was disrupted just like that!

.

Over on humanity’s side, they all let out a long sigh in relief.

Just now, if not for Ye Yuan’s timely appearance, all those present who were under Deva Realm would probably have died off.

The area that a Dao Ancestor-level battle covered was too vast. It was not what they could resist at all.

Let alone that they were even hit by the ocular art, and got caught in an illusion.

“Lord Tian Qing, what should we do now?” Profound Lineage’s progenitor, Originsmile, said with a frown.

Tian Qing mused for a moment and said, “I really want to see what level his strength will reach after he breaks through! We’ve waited far too long for this war. We can’t just give up!”

The few progenitors also nodded their heads slightly.

Making them give up just like this and return to the abyss, that was impossible!

Furthermore, they currently possessed two great Ten-marks powerhouses. Their strength already could not be mentioned in the same breath long ago, there was no need to fear anyone.

Boom!

Crack!

Wind, rain, lightning, and thunder, crisscrossed.

Ye Yuan was situated inside, glimmering and fading indeterminately.

That appearance was like a small rowboat in a tsunami.

It was just that no matter how big the storm was, he stood firm as a rock!

His fleshy body realm and divine essence realm were advancing frenziedly.

To him, the divine essence required for breaking through one cultivation realm now was too vast.

Cultivating according to the normal routine, he would only be able to cultivate the Creation Realm to the realm of grand completion after God knows how long.

But this Heavenly Dao Samsara created an opportunity for him.

“Heh,?the chaos origin divinity is really useful! Although I still haven’t figured out what it is, without a doubt, it’s very strong!” Ye Yuan said gleefully.

Judging from the shock of that mysterious voice, the chaos origin divinity was not an ordinary thing too.

Looking at it now, not only was the chaos origin divinity undying and imperishable, it could even withstand extermination lightning.

The extermination lightning that even Dao Ancestors and Ten-marks powerhouses avoided like the plague, he faced it calmly.

Furthermore, he did not go all out. He deliberately leaked a trace of extermination lightning power, and he used it to temper his physical body.

With the extermination lightning’s power, using it to temper the physical body was most suitable.

Ye Yuan’s physical body had long already transcended the ninth nirvanic tribulation, reaching the level of perfect ninth transformation.

But after reaching the ninth transformation, his progress became extremely slow.

Because there were virtually no treasures capable of enhancing his physical strength anymore.

Now, with the tempering of the extermination lightning, the strength of his physical body gradually reached grand completion.

His strength was growing rapidly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Earth-shaking changes were also occurring to Ye Yuan’s chaos world.

The sun, moon, stars, mountains, and rivers gradually became real.

When the nine great Dao Ancestors saw this scene, their gazes revealed extremely envious looks.

Especially Lin Chaotian, he was incredibly jealous.

He expended so much thought to acquire the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. In the end, it was all for naught!

“Just what kind of cultivation method did this guy comprehend? The commotion of his breakthrough is a little too big, right?!” Ancestor Fire said in a solemn voice.

The commotion of Ye Yuan’s breakthrough was seriously too great.

Even above the ninth heaven, that powerful pressure made everyone’s hearts shocked too.

“I really don’t know what kind of cultivation method can make world power so solid! I have a feeling that this is the key to him being different from us! He doesn’t need to transcend the tribulation!” Lin Chaotian said in a solemn voice.

No matter how Lin Chaotian racked his brain, he also could not imagine that Ye Yuan relied on his own comprehension ability. He forcibly created a small world that was comparable to the Heavenspan World!

Hence, they could only be envious.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan’s aura finally climbed to the peak, and it could not increase anymore.

At this point, his Chaos Heavenspan Canon was finally cultivated to the realm of grand completion!

Ye Yuan did not have any clues about the next realm.

He had devoted himself to studying the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain before but did not have the slightest clue.

It seemed like everything ended here.

But Ye Yuan had a feeling that his cultivation method should be able to break through to a higher realm.

Ye Yuan examined his own small world. Everything was already created completely.

A great world had already taken shape!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said to himself, “My world is missing something! Yes, although my world is powerful, it doesn’t have the slightest lease of life! No flowers, grass, and trees; without birds and animals, let alone cultivating martial artists. Even if a martial artist is in my world, they wouldn’t be able to cultivate too! But how should I let it have a myriad of lives?”

Ye Yuan felt that this was the key to his breakthrough to the next realm.

It was just that he did not know where the problem was.

Creating a world was not saying that if God wanted light, there would be light.

If it were so simple, Ye Yuan also would not have walked with so much difficulty.

Although the time that he cultivated was not long, the things that he experienced, ordinary people simply could not imagine it.

Not talking about other things, just the comprehension of the Chaos Heavenspan Canon was not what ordinary people could understand.

“When other martial artists cultivate, as long as they reach Divine Lord Realm, they will be able to form a small world and can derive life. But it doesn’t seem to work for my world! While it’s strong, it’s missing something!” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

“Forget it. Take it one step at a time. My power of laws isn’t perfected yet. After I reach the realm of rule, I should be able to do whatever I want in the Heavenspan World!”

After the chaos world had finished evolving completely, his strength also reached an inconceivable level.

Ordinary Deva Fifth Blights were utterly not worth mentioning in front of him.

Only Dao Ancestors relying on the power of rule could have a battle with him.

Ye Yuan took a step out and directly returned to the surface of the earth.

He looked at Tian Qing from afar and said in a cold voice, “Tian Qing, I don’t have objections about your divine race wanting to return to the Heavenspan World! But if you all dare to inflict living things with great suffering or want to continue enslaving the myriad races, this Ye will definitely kill you with my own hands!”

With him saying these words, it was equivalent to protecting the nine great Dao Ancestors.

Although Ye Yuan was full of unhappiness with these few guys, they could not die yet.

Without them, the myriad races would lose their support.

His current strength was still not enough to overwhelm the divine race.

But it was enough to make the divine race dread him!

However, Ye Yuan’s words were arrogant to the extreme.

Personally killing the divine race’s number one person, only Ye Yuan dared to say these words.

Sure enough, Tian Qing laughed loudly when he heard that and said,?“Hahaha?… Ye Yuan, it depends on whether or not you have the qualifications to say this!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said coolly, “You can come and give it a try to see whether I have the qualifications to say this or not!”
