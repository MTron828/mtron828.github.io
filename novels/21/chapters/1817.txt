1821 Blissful Treasure Pig

Ye Yuan lowered his head and took a look at his bosom. A pink piggy was currently desperately boring into his clothes.

Then a little boy around five or six years old ran in front of Ye Yuan with a waddle.

The child reached his hand out to Ye Yuan and said, “Return Treasure Pig to me!”

Ye Yuan was taken back, grabbed hold of the little pink pig in his bosom, and passed it to the child.

The child giggled and reached his hand out to receive the little pink pig. Taking over the little pink pig, it struggled and immediately broke free of the child’s arm, boring into Ye Yuan’s bosom again.

The child was stunned and could not help saying furiously, “Treasure Pig, are you trying to rebel?”

“Awoo, awoo!”

That little pink pig clamored in Ye Yuan’s bosom and refused to come out.

Ye Yuan was also perplexed, uncertain of what was going on.

The kid could not help saying angrily when he heard Treasure Pig’s cries, “What the hell are you doing? A First Firmament Celestial Deity stinking brat, you actually like him? Did you eat too many medicinal pills and spoiled your head?”

The child gave no chance to explain and directly reached his arm out to grab Treasure Pig.

But Treasure Pig bored into Ye Yuan’s bosom desperately and refused to come out.

Ye Yuan had a flashed of inspiration, as if understanding something, and said coolly, “You let it go, let me do it.”

Who knew that that kid did not buy it at all, and said angrily, “Brat, who the hell do you think you are? Keep being long-winded and Grandpa Tong will immediately kill you! Hurry up and return my Treasure Pig to me!”

Ye Yuan was stunned. This child talked in a kiddish manner but had the appearance of a patronizing elder. The feeling that it gave people was extremely weird.

But this kid’s arrogant appearance also ignited Ye Yuan’s anger.

His brows furrowed, and he said in a cold voice, “Are you letting go or not?”

The kid raised his head and said, “I’m not letting go, what can you do to me?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ye Yuan laughed coldly and reached his hand out to grab, grabbing toward the child.

That child similarly laughed coldly, figure immediately becoming illusory.

Ye Yuan’s grab actually caught nothing!

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he said in surprise, “Spatial law!”

The child was proud of himself as he said, “Merely a First Firmament Celestial Deity, and yet you really take yourself to be somebody noteworthy!”

This child’s strength was very vague. Even by his side, Ye Yuan could not sense his strength too.

It was just that this spatial law, it was still Ye Yuan’s first time seeing apart from his and Coldfeather’s.

Furthermore, this child’s spatial law comprehension was not weak.

That child was currently being pleased with himself when a hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, reaching his hand out to grab at him once more.

The child chuckled and said, “It’s no use, your bit of ability isn’t even fit to carry shoes for your Grandpa Tong!”

This time, he still wanted to avoid Ye Yuan’s grab through spatial law.

It was just a pity that Ye Yuan’s grab trailed closely behind like a shadow.

Inside the void, Ye Yuan grabbed hold of the child’s arm.

The child turned pale with fright and cried out in surprise, “You actually know spatial law too!”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “You wouldn’t think that only you know spatial law in this world, right? Really don’t know which family’s child, so mischievous! Today, I’ll discipline you well on behalf of your family’s grownups!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan allowed no explanations and put the child on his legs and smacked his buttocks.

Children had thin skin and tender flesh, how could they withstand Ye Yuan’s iron palm?

With a few slaps, the child burst into tears.

“Wah! Wah! Let me go! You stinking brat, I’ll definitely kill you! Definitely kill you!”

By the side, Zhu Wen looked at this scene, a gloating look on his face.

“Heh heh, the evil that people brought on themselves is the hardest to bear!”

Xu Yan’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “What do you mean by this?”

Zhu Wen had a smug look as he said, “That kid has always been following Elder Du Rufeng recently. Elder Du Rufeng listens and does whatever he wants. Their relationship must be extraordinary. That punk hit Elder Du Rufeng’s people now, do you think his outcome can be good?”

The moment these words came out, Xu Yan’s expression instantly became very ugly.

Baili Qingyan had been watching happily by the side all along. Now, hearing Zhu Wen say so, she could not resist asking, “Elder Xu, who is Elder Du Rufeng?”

Xu Yan’s expression was ugly as he said, “Over 300 thousand years ago, he was the number one alchemist of the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s young generation! That season’s Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, he entered the temple by getting the first place. Presently, he’s already a True God Realm elder.”

Baili Qingyan’s expression changed drastically. The temple’s elder, also an alchemist, this was having provoked an incredible major figure!

Zhu Wen this kind of person could only be a minor character in the temple.

But a rank six alchemist, that identity was absolutely extraordinary.

She hurriedly shouted, “Ye Yuan, stop hitting!”

Ye Yuan did not listen at all and still beat the child’s buttocks severely.

Right then, a figure swept over here as swift as lightning.

An old man had an imposing momentum as he looked at Ye Yuan with a furious look and bellowed loudly, “Where did this punk come from, to actually dare hit ... hit Little Tong!”

“Ouch! So painful! My butt! Du Rufeng, h-hurry up and save me!” Little Tong cried.

Ye Yuan really dealt heavy blows. The kid was really in pain right now.

Ye Yuan gave Du Rufeng a glance and said coolly, “This is your family’s child?”

Du Rufeng was taken aback and immediately nodded his head and said, “That’s right!”

Only at this time, did Ye Yuan stop. Throwing Little Tong to Du Rufeng, he said coolly, “Your family’s child, you have to discipline him well. Acting patronizingly like an elder, wanting to kill people at the drop of a hat. This child’s talent is pretty good, he mustn’t take to evil ways.”

Du Rufeng had a peculiar expression on his face. Reaching his hand out and beckoning, he caught Little Tong.

Little Tong shed tears and mucus, looking extremely pitiful.

“Du ... Grandpa Du, quickly help me take a look. I can’t feel my butt now, sniff sniff ...”

As he said, he stuck his little buttocks up, almost killing people with cuteness.

Du Rufeng had a dark expression. Pulling down Little Tong’s pants, he discovered that the buttocks were bright red.

He gritted his teeth and said, “You punk, really ruthless in your blows huh! Looks like you really want to die!”

Du Rufeng raised his head, the aura of True God Realm suddenly released. Everyone’s faces changed drastically.

But when Du Rufeng looked over toward Ye Yuan again, he discovered that he was currently squatting there, Treasure Pig wriggling into Ye Yuan’s palm extremely happily.

“Awoo, awoo!”

Treasure Pig’s cheerful cries made Du Rufeng have a stunned look. The powerful aura also disappeared into thin air.

Du Rufeng looked at Little Tong with a shocked expression as he said, “Little Tong, this ...”

Little Tong also stopped crying already, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of shock.

Hearing Du Rufeng’s yell, he nodded his head and said in a solemn voice, “Treasure Pig he has never bleated so happily before! How did this kid do it?”

“Grunt, grunt!”

The pink Treasure Pig baby had a blissful appearance and finally ate all the medicinal pills in Ye Yuan’s hand. Then, his neck tilted and he collapsed on the ground, falling asleep blissfully.

Ye Yuan picked up Treasure Pig and returned it to Little Tong and said coolly, “Little snotty brat, don’t yell about killing at every move. This little pig is clearly hungry. Just feed it to its fill and that would do it?”
