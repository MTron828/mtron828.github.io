Chapter 2372: Unknown Land

Rumble!

Supreme inheritance divine temple suddenly emitted violent rumblings, reverberating throughout the clouds.

The entire Primeval War Realm was virtually all trembling.

The other two inheritance divine temples were practically shattering under this powerful undulation!

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets and Ancestor Lightning, this level of existences, were immediately startled.

“Profound Secrets, what’s going on?” Ancestor Lightning said in a solemn voice.

Profound Secrets’ expression was very ugly as he said in a deep voice, “I don’t know either. This undulation seems to have happened in the supreme inheritance divine temple. Could it be that something happened to Ye Yuan?”

The moment Ancestor Lightning and the rest heard, they immediately calmed down.

As long as it was not their descendants and disciples meeting with a mishap, it was fine.

As for Ye Yuan, what did his life and death have to do with them?

In fact, Ancestor Lightning was even somewhat gloating over his misfortune!

This kid considered everyone beneath his notice and actually dared to negotiate terms with this ancestor? He deserved to die!

Originally, today was the day when the unpredictable children exited seclusion.

But no one could have thought that such a huge change suddenly occurred at this time.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ expression changed slightly, his figure moving, disappearing on the spot. The rest followed one after another.

When they arrived at the inheritance divine temples, the other unpredictable children already came out of the temples.

While the supreme inheritance divine temple had long already fallen apart to pieces!

A shocking power of spacetime law surged to the sky, forming a huge whirlpool in the air.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s complexion was deathly pale as he cried out in surprise, “This ... This is Spacetime Reversal Chaos! Not good! Ye Yuan is in danger!”

The unpredictable children were all baffled, completely not knowing what had happened.

“What a powerful law undulation! I didn’t expect that inside the supreme inheritance divine temple is actually spacetime law!”

“Ye Yuan should be in the inheritance divine temple, right? Such a powerful undulation, has he already been killed?”

“Heh heh,

best if he died! This is probably Heavenly Dao’s punishment to him, this unpredictable child!” Yu Tanzhi sneered coldly as he watched this scene.

“Isn’t that so! This punk killed me, not letting me enter the top 11, serves him right to die!” Someone immediately concurred.

He was completely ravaged by Ye Yuan this time and did not even get the ten great inheritances, and could only obtain the most ordinary inheritance.

His inheritance was very ordinary. For his strength, it could not improve it too much, making it equivalent to being useless.

Therefore, he hated Ye Yuan a lot and wished for him to die right away.

He did not expect that his dream actually came true!

This bunch of guys was already beside themselves with joy.

“Shut up! Whoever says another word, this emperor will make you regret being born in this world!” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets bursted out with a loud roar. His expression was gloomy until it could drip water.

The unpredictable children shut their mouths sensibly. They did not have the slightest doubt that if they said another word, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets would make them unable to speak again.

While at this time, a phantom slowly walked out of the spacetime storm. It was precisely Shang Hang.

When Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets as well as Ancestor Lightning saw Shang Hang, they both bowed in salute.

“Senior! Ye Yuan he ...”

The group of unpredictable children was filled with fear!

Who was this? To actually be worthy of these two people’s bow?

One had to know that one of them was a Dao Ancestor!

Shang Hang accepted it calmly and said with a sigh, “That kid was swept into the spacetime turbulence!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ expression changed wildly and he said, “Senior, just ... just what’s going on here?”

Ever since seeing Ye Yuan, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets viewed him as the hope of the human race.

But now, this human race’s hope was banished into the spacetime turbulence, and could no longer come out again!

One had to know, back then, it was Shang Hang who banished Tian Qing to the spacetime turbulence.

Even that kind of terrifying existence was unable to escape from the spacetime turbulence, let alone Ye Yuan?

Shang Hang smiled bitterly and said, “I don’t know either! He seemed to have comprehended something at the final moment. But right at that time, the spacetime vortex suddenly became berserk, sweeping him into the spacetime turbulence. Later, you all saw it.”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets only felt that it was preposterous. Spacetime Reversal Chaos was Shang Hang’s ultimate profound intent. But even he himself did not understand what was going on?

But, with Ye Yuan being banished, wasn’t it cutting off the human race’s last hope?

“Then ... Then what should we do now?” Even someone as level-headed as Profound Secrets was also somewhat at a loss on what to do now.

Shang Hang smiled bitterly and said, “Forget about now. Even when this ancestor was at my prime back then, I was also unable to bring people back from the spacetime turbulence. Now ... we can only wait, see if a miracle appears! Oh, right, protect his physical body well. I hope that this boy isn’t fated to die!”

When Ye Yuan was being swept into the spacetime turbulence, it was his consciousness as well as the physical body that the Primeval War Realm condensed.

If he was unable to return, Ye Yuan’s fleshy body would be a living corpse.

... ...

This was a lush green mountain, endowed with natural spirits.

Ye Yuan strolled around, not knowing where he was.

Just earlier, he was swept into a turbulent flow, and only felt the scenery before his eyes changing non-stop.

Then he arrived at this unknown place.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said to himself, “Spacetime Reversal Chaos, am I ... banished to the Ganges river of time? But, where is this place? It seems pretty good. But, how should I go back? Right now, Senior Profound Secrets and Senior Shang Hang they all, should be panicking, right?”

A series of questions lingered in Ye Yuan’s heart.

When he was swept into the Spacetime Reversal Chaos, he faintly heard Shang Hang yell out, Spacetime Reversal Chaos.

Wasn’t Spacetime Reversal Chaos precisely Shang Hang’s ultimate profound intent?

Him comprehending spacetime law actually produced a resonance with the spacetime vortex, and increased the power of the spacetime vortex many times!

Then this meant that he sent himself to exile!

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “I’m afraid that it’s unprecedented to be banished like me, right?”

He just wanted to comprehend a spacetime law that belonged to him. But he did not expect that it triggered this kind of horrifying power, and he banished himself.

This sort of thing seemed like a blunder no matter how one looked at it.

“Forget it. Since I came, might as well make the best out of it! Take a look at what place this is first,” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

Ye Yuan wandered over and discovered that there were many restrictions on the mountain. But to him, this Formation Dao rank two source powerhouse, it was naturally nothing.

This place looked like a mountain pass gate, but there did not seem to be many human footmarks.

Ye Yuan discovered that the spiritual energy here seemed to be a lot more abundant than in his own world.

Hence, he followed the trail of spiritual energy and headed to the thickest place.

There, it was normally where the core of the mountain pass gates lied.

With Ye Yuan’s footsteps, his speed was naturally extremely fast. Before long, he arrived at the highest peak.

Ye Yuan faintly felt many powerful auras.

When he stepped onto the mountain pass gates, he was stunned by the scene before his eyes.

In front of the vast mountain pass gates, ten thousand people were prostrated on the ground, trembling away. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In front of the ten thousand people, several figures were extremely domineering.

Beside them, laid corpses that covered the ground!

Bang!

A huge energy undulation flashed past, a young man was directly blown to pieces, not having an intact corpse.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, his pupils could not help shrinking!

“Divine race!”
