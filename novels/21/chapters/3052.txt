Chapter 3051: 300 Origin Powerhouses!

“Go!”

Ye Yuan gave a low cry. The 300 Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pills flew toward those Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses.

The nirvanic rebirth fire dissipated with a loud bang.

“Miracle! Truly a miracle! Master Ye’s alchemy technique really broadens this Zhou’s horizons!” Zhou Xianchen had already been holding it in for too long. At this moment, he finally could not help but erupt.

“Controlling strength like thread, with great meticulousness, stable as a mountain, vast like the sea! Brother Ye’s refinement can really live up to the word ‘master’! What’s laughable is that we are actually displaying our meager skills before an expert. Thinking about it now, I really perspire from embarrassment!” Chu Fang gave Ye Yuan a respectful bow and said.

“Master Ye is a wise man who attained Dao! Jinnan is ashamed!” Jinnan also said.

These three people went from mocking, to shock, then to great admiration. This journey of the heart could be called ups and downs.

But, having witnessed Ye Yuan’s methods, they were really convinced.

Actually, before the three of them did this, the crowd had long already exploded.

“All 300 reached origin grade!”

“My God, the quality of these Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pills are actually exactly the same!”

“Not only Master Ye completed it, but he also did it so perfectly! This move really created an insurmountable peak!”

… …

Even if they were a fool, they would also know how strong Ye Yuan was.

Zhou Xianchen three people were not even fit to carry his shoes in front of him!

Such a performance was not unexpected.

But the current Ye Yuan had somewhat weak footsteps. Clearly, the consumption was too great.

This refinement was not easy!

Before breaking through to Emperor Sakra Heaven, this should be the pinnacle of his creation!

“All right. All take the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill!” Ye Yuan waved his hand and said.

Those 300 people had excited faces. Giving a bow toward Ye Yuan, they said in unison, “Many thanks to Heavenly Saint Ye for bestowing the pill!”

Finished saying, these people took the heavenly pill on the spot and broke through right away.

Ye Yuan also fished out a black heavenly pill and directly swallowed it.

When Zhou Xianchen three people saw the situation, their pupils could not help constricting.

This was not the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill!

Ye Yuan even split his attention to refine another heavenly pill with the 300 Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pills?

This … was also a little too impressive, right?

However, what heavenly pill was this black thing?

It seemed like they had never seen it before!

“Master Ye, I wonder what’s the heavenly pill you took just now?” Zhou Xianchen could not resist asking.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The name? I haven’t thought of it yet.”

Zhou Xianchen was stunned, had not thought of it?

In that case, this pill formula was just created by Ye Yuan?

This … Did he still want people to live?

“This pill formula was improvised by me and randomly done amidst the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pills. Didn’t expect that it actually succeeded,” Ye Yuan said.

Zhou Xianchen was speechless. Jinnan and Chu Fang were likewise so.

This was also being said too casually!

Boom!

Before his voice faded, the chaos divine essence in Ye Yuan’s body exploded with a loud bang, his aura surging to the sky.

Broke through!

The facial muscles of Zhou Xianchen and the rest could not help but twitch.

Randomly done and broke through?

One heavenly pill, one minor realm!

Reaching Emperor Vast Heaven Realm, this was already something impossible.

Even if it was some formidable cultivation heavenly pills, it could merely save a thousand years of bitter cultivation too.

But, wanting to break through, it was far from enough.

However, Ye Yuan casually refined a heavenly pill and broke through?

Zhou Xianchen let out a sigh and said, “Master Ye has already gleaned the essence of Alchemy Dao. A simple movement or action is all Dao! Looks like he has already reached the threshold of doing as he pleases! Entering Hegemon with Alchemy Doa is merely a matter of time for him! In contrast, the few of us are seriously too shallow!”

Jinnan nodded and said, “The few of us are still clinging onto form, but Master Ye is already following his instinct. This is called disparity!”

Right at this time, a commotion came from the crowd.

A surge of origin power suddenly descended.

Someone gained enlightenment!

“So fast! He just took the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill not long and already comprehended?”

“My God, the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill that Master Ye refined is also too magical, right?!”

“This isn’t increasing cultivation realm, but comprehending origin! Origin is a big hurdle for everyone. I didn’t expect that that guy comprehended so quickly!”

“Hurry up and look! It’s another power of origin! That person comprehended too!”

… …

Among the 300 people who swallowed the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill, there were already people who gained enlightenment on Dao and stepped into origin realm!

Furthermore, the numbers were still continuously increasing.

One origin power after another descended. This stretch of wilderness instantly became lively.

Even Kong Tan and Wang Ningyan, this kind of geniuses, were also extremely envious as they watched.

“Is this heavenly pill really so magical? These guys’ aptitudes are just like that. However, they actually all seem to have had an epiphany, comprehending origin!” Kong Tan was somewhat sour as he said.

“According to this kind of breakthrough method, if there are sufficient heavenly medicines, then wouldn’t Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven be able to create origin powerhouses unceasingly?” Yu Yan also said with a melancholic look.

She suddenly remembered what Yang Qing scolded her. She was indeed blind!

It turned out that the leader on Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s side was simply Ye Yuan, and not Yang Qing!

Wang Ningyan said, “I think I understand something! Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s sudden emergence this time is most likely because of Ye Yuan! He actually brought 1.2 million people up the Vertical Heaven Stairs, and he brought more than 50 thousand people from the Thousand Souls Hall … How is this possible! This … How is this possible?”

Kong Tan and the others were all shocked when they heard that, only then coming back to their senses.

A total of 1.2 million people, that was an absolutely terrifying number.

Bringing 50 thousand people over from the Thousand Souls Hall was even more horrifying than the 1.2 million people previously!

It sounded somewhat fantastical.

But one could understand from those 50 thousand people’s respectful attitudes that all these had nothing to do with Yang Qing. It was all due to Ye Yuan.

Except, regarding how on earth Ye Yuan did it, they could not figure it out after racking their brains too.

Very soon, Ye Yuan transcended the Dao tribulation and reached middle Emperor Vast Heaven.

When he cultivated now, ordinary heaven and earth spiritual energy could no longer satisfy him.

The efficiency of converting to chaos divine essence was far too low. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Luckily, the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s heavenly medicines were really complete. He only came up with this pill formula after expending considerable effort in those three months.

In a blink of an eye, it was another month.

A series of exclamations suddenly came from the crowd.

“The 300th! A-All broke through! This … How is this possible?”

“The Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill that Master Ye refines is actually able to 100% breakthrough to origin realm! This is too amazing!”

“Holy hell! Your Father’s intestines are green with regret! If I’d long known, I’d have found Master Ye to refine, and I’d also be an origin powerhouse now!?ARGH!!”

… …

When the 300th power of origin descended, the whole place seethed with excitement.

The Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill was not a divine medicine. Even if it had the effect of mind clarity, it depended on lucky chance too.

Origin this step was far too difficult!

Many people, even some geniuses, might not be able to break through to origin realm after consuming the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill too.

But those people who consumed Ye Yuan’s heavenly pills all broke through!

A total of 300 origin powerhouses, this was definitely an astonishing force.

The quality of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s martial artist army upgraded by several grades all at once!

Such terrifying alchemy path strength made all the geniuses present give sidelong glances!
