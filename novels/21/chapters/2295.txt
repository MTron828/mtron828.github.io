Chapter 2299: Seething Cloud Summer Mountain!

“How can this Second Sage be so strong?”

“Against a late-stage Ancestor Realm expert, he was actually crushed by Second Sage until he’s black and blue all over! Second Sage is so young, and yet he actually already reached the peak late-stage Ancestor Realm?”

“The highlight of the show is at the back! Eldest Senior Brother Yun Windborne is a grand completion Ancestor Realm powerhouse, a truly apex existence! Winning against him, even if Second Sage loses, no one will dare to say anything either!”

... ...

Leaving behind the Second Senior Brother with a defeated look, Ye Yuan advanced once again.

This time, who he was facing was a true apex existence, Yun Windborne!

Grand completion Ancestor Realm, this was the limit that ordinary alchemists could reach already.

If there was no heaven-defying lucky chance, comprehending Dao pills was virtually something impossible.

The various major ancestors’ chief disciples had already followed their ancestors to cultivate for God knows how many years. Most of them stopped at this realm and did not advance.

A powerhouse such as Sacred Ancestor High Priest, his first three disciples were all grand completion Ancestor Realm!

But there was not even one person among them who had comprehended Dao pill.

The human race’s powerhouses were numerous. The state of Alchemy Dao was flourishing. There were still some grand completion Ancestor Realm alchemists.

But among these people, those who could take this final step were scanty few.

If not for Medicine Ancestor issuing this call this time, these few ancestors would not come into being at all.

The alchemy powerhouses who followed up were inexplicably excited.

This kind of pinnacle showdown, how could one see it normally?

The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time was originally hosted for disciples of the younger generation.

Everyone also completely did not expect the peak showdown of grand completion Ancestor Realms!

Yun Windborne looked at Ye Yuan and said with a calm demeanor, “Able to walk until this point at a young age, you truly set the world ablaze. This Yun admires endlessly!”

The current Yun Windborne was not whatever Ancestor Maplegrove’s disciple, but a grandmaster of the generation!

Ye Yuan was very strong, and he saw it.

But he would not shake his own faith because of Ye Yuan’s might.

Reaching this level of realm, he had long already cultivated extremely strong confidence. No one could shake it in the slightest.

With the ancestors not coming out, he was the summit of the top!

As for Ye Yuan comprehending Dao pill, he did not think about it at all.

Because that was something impossible.

Thinking back then, how amazingly talented was he too?

Even if he could not compare to the present Ye Yuan, he also would not be too lacking.

But countless tens of thousands of years had passed, he was still unable to take that step.

Ye Yuan was indeed outstandingly talented, but he would be stuck at this step in the next 100 thousand, one million, ten million, even a trillion years!

“Same old rules. You’re a generation younger. So you pick the medicinal pill,” Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly.

The rest all had strange looks. Ye Yuan was young in age but behaved like an elder. It was really incongruous.

But these words were also true in all senses. Nobody could find any fault either.

Yun Windborne’s self-restraint was much better than his junior apprentice brothers.

He did not get angry, but he said with a faint smile, “It ends here then. Being able to walk in front of this emperor is already sufficient to prove your title of Second Sage. Withdraw now and this emperor can take it as if nothing happened. If not, this defeat will affect your Dao heart!”

“Tsk tsk, a master is a master, this tolerance ... is really extraordinary!”

“Yun Windborne’s strength isn’t at all inferior compared to the Priest Temple’s High Priest Mao Yuan too!”

“He’s already standing at the top of the alchemy path. If the ancestors don’t come out, who can challenge! If Second Sage is sensible, he should withdraw.”

... ...

Yun Windborne’s action immediately drew many praises.

This was the bearing of an expert!

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and could not help laughing as he said, “You all are indeed old fellows who have lived for trillions of years. But on the path of alchemy, those who reached first can teach! You all are not viewing this Ye as Second Sage, that’s fine! Then ... I’ll fight until you all are convinced!”

From Zhu Tianxiang to Yun Windborne, including many people present, they all felt that he was relying on Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s awe-inspiring reputation to obtain the title of Second Sage.

Hence, that was why they dared to go from bad to worse, digging a pit for Heavenly Emperor Justbright to jump, then even acted in collusion.

Since that was the case, I’ll fight until you are convinced!

He did not explain anything, because words were feeble.

If he said that he knew how to refine Dao pills, nobody would believe it at all.

Since that was the case, then he would face the ancestors and have a dialogue with ancestor-level powerhouses!

Yun Windborne was clearly indifferent as he said with a smile, “Since that’s the case, fine then. The medicinal pill will be chosen by Second Sage.”

Ye Yuan shook his head and insisted, “You are a junior. So you choose it! Otherwise, this Ye will win unscrupulously.”

Everyone had strange looks on their faces.

Yun Windborne shook his head and laughed in spite of himself and said, “Fine, this Yun will choose the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill then.”

“Hiss ...”

Everyone sucked in a cold breath, this South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill was the most difficult existence among rank eight divine pills.

Yun Windborne’s strength already reached until here?

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and nodded his head slightly and said, “Okay, Mu Tiesheng!”

Mu Tiesheng’s entire person was in a daze, he did not know how he walked over.

Coming all this way, his entire person already floated up to the sky!

The difficulty of the medicinal pills got higher and higher, but the quality got higher and higher!

Today, a pie really fell from the sky!

Right now, he was endlessly grateful toward Fang Tianren’s 18 generations of ancestors in his heart.

If not for this guy wanting to step on Ye Yuan to move up, he also would not have picked up such a huge bargain!

Spending ten billion superior-grade divine essence stones, he bought a set of spirit medicines from Yun Windborne there.

“Begin then,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Yun Windborne did not argue either, smiling slightly, and started refining the pill.

The moment he made his move, the wind and clouds immediately surged!

An aura of Dao suddenly descended upon Cloud Summer Mountain.

For some time, on Cloud Summer Mountain, fate arose and extinguished, flowers bloomed and faded!

It was like a world was slowly forming inside the medicinal cauldron.

Compared to Yun Windborne’s pill refinement, his junior apprentice brothers did not even count as a fart.

Many people have witnessed the pill refinements of Zhu Tianxiang and the rest. At that time, it already took their breath away in astonishment, being immensely shocked.

But only now did they know how insignificant they were, and how ignorant!

It turned out that Alchemy Dao can reach such a level! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Forget about Zhu Tianxiang; even Ancestor Maplegrove’s second disciple paled in comparison in front of Yun Windborne too!

Yun Windborne’s might was the strength accumulated over the years. It was an unrivaled strength.

With the ancestors not coming out, no one could reach such a height at all.

Many people all cast sympathetic gazes toward Ye Yuan. This time, Second Sage finally kicked a metal plate!

Even if Ye Yuan’s realm also reached grand completion Ancestor Realm, it was impossible to surpass Yun Windborne too.

This kind of strength that was tempered endlessly, was simply unmatched.

Unless one reached the legendary Dao pill level, otherwise, it was simply impossible to win.

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered, his eyes staring at Yun Windborne without blinking.

Indeed, compared to his junior apprentice brothers, this Yun Windborne was much stronger.

From Yun Windborne’s refinement, Ye Yuan learned many things.

He would never overlook his opponents because they were weak. If there was good stuff, he would learn without the slightest hesitation.

Just like this, time passed quietly.

Several days later, the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill formed!

Yun Windborne’s face still had a faint smile, opening the furnace calmly.

For a moment, Cloud Summer Mountain seethed with excitement!
