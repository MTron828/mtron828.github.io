Chapter 2846 Little Martial Uncle!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan’s joke of wanting to exile Wu Jiang was currently being mocked by the entire sect.

Very soon, another explosive news came.

Wu Jiang those few hundred people were really exiled!

That group of people who offended Ye Yuan in front of the mountain pass gates, none of them managed to escape!

The Extreme Medicine Sect burst into an uproar from top to bottom!

“How did that boy do it? This time, it’s actually Saint Sovereign personally giving the order to punish a group of True Sovereign Heavens and Saint Sovereign Heavens?”

“The boast that he made is really accomplished! This matter blew up so big. In the end, Wu Jiang himself became the biggest joke, how laughable!”

“No way, right? It’s a few hundred people. They got exiled just like that. Could it be that the Extreme Medicine Sect’s wind direction is starting to change?”

“In my view, this matter was likely Zuo Chen personally speaking up! He has extremely high hopes of advancing to grade nine heavenly alchemist. If he were to really fly off the handle, Sect Master has to give him some

face too! It’s just that Zuo Chen pampers this little disciple a little too much, right?”

With Sect Master personally giving the order, this caused a mighty uproar in the sect from top to bottom.

Wu Jiang and the rest were merely a group of small fries. Nobody cared.

Presently, at this critical juncture, such an order seriously made people’s minds fall into a reverie.

All along, the conservative faction and warring faction could be said to act independently and defiantly.

Sect Master’s attitude had always been impartial too.

But this time, directly exiling a few hundred people, it was still the first time after the war!

Although the Extreme Medicine Sect had close to half of its disciples at the Absolute Heaven Barrier, the vast majority voluntarily took part in the war.

Those who were not willing to participate in the fight were usually not forced to, under normal circumstances.

But this time, it changed!

Did the wind change, or was it really just for a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven?

But no matter what, the boast that Ye Yuan put out was truly realized!

The situation that Wu Jiang and Zhou Qun painstakingly created not only did not let Zuo Chen’s lineage become a joke, but it also fulfilled their wishes instead!

Now, the entire sect knew that Zuo Chen won!

Then would the warring faction have the upper hand?

When Hua Zong heard this news, he was stunned.

He wondered whether he heard wrongly or not.

Saint Sovereign actually personally gave the order to exile Wu Jiang and the others for a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven?

He thought of Zuo Chen right away.

Other than Zuo Chen, who else could have such power?

But this also deeply reflected how much his master valued Ye Yuan!

Third Senior Apprentice Brother, Zhu Yan, patted Hua Zong’s shoulder and said with a bitter smile, “The few of us should go and meet this little junior brother together! Master has always taught us that apprentice

brothers should help each other and be close as a family. But now, Little Junior Brother just entered the sect, and he got left out to dry by us. Most likely, his elderly self is very enraged, right?”

There were five senior apprentice brothers present.

Just earlier, they were still discussing how to deal with this matter.

They did not expect that it had been resolved!

Furthermore, it was even with such a fierce method!

Zuo Chen took in a total of 16 disciples, but five had already died in battle.

At present, there were five that remained in the sect, with Third Senior Apprentice Brother Zhu Yan as the eldest.

The remaining were all following Zuo Chen to fight at Absolute Heaven Barrier.

These 11 people, only Hua Zong alone was True Sovereign Heaven. The rest were all Emperor Realm powerhouses.

When Zhu Yan and the rest heard about this, they were very angry too and did not have the intention of going to meet Ye Yuan at all.

But now, reality slapped them in the face.

Reality proved that Master’s concern toward Ye Yuan was even stronger than they imagined!

Hua Zong smiled bitterly and said, “We can only do this! It looks like this little junior brother of ours is really beloved by Master!”

These words were a little sour.

Zuo Chen’s requirements of them senior apprentice brothers were very stringent.

He had never done this kind of pampering thing before.

Zhu Yan and the others very naturally pinned this on Zuo Chen.

Although they were also somewhat doubtful whether Zuo Chen had so much weight to make Sect Master personally give the order, this was the most logical explanation.

Zhu Yan said coolly, “Being able to be valued so much by Master, Little Junior Brother must have aspects that surpass others! Rather than being sour about it here, it’s better to work hard and increase our strength and

strive to make Master view you in a different light! This time, Sect Master personally taking action might also be that the wind direction changed. Absolute Heaven Barrier’s war situation might not be optimistic!”

Hua Zong was startled and hurriedly said, “Senior Apprentice Brother lectured well. It was Junior Apprentice Brother who was rash!”

The senior apprentice brothers five people came to find Ye Yuan, but Ye Yuan was not around.

Zhu Yan and the rest were afraid of new formed cracks forming between them and Ye Yuan and could not leave immediately either. They could only wait in Ye Yuan’s residence.

At this time, Ye Yuan already entered the Extreme Light Pavilion.

The Extreme Light Pavilion was formed in an independent space.

When Ye Yuan entered inside, he only felt spiritual energy fill his body.

The heaven and earth spiritual energies here were several dozen times that of the outside world!

One had to know, the East Victory Mountain Range was one of Heaven One Continent’s limited major spiritual veins, its spiritual energy being extremely abundant.

And the spiritual energy here was even more terrifying!

The sun and moon circled this place, forming its own world. It was clearly an amazing work.

Ye Yuan had a feeling that this place was where the Extreme Medicine Sect’s true foundation lay.

Song Qingyang brought Ye Yuan and went straight into a great hall.

Countless memorial tablets were enshrined in the great hall.

Ye Yuan could not feel death qi from these memorial tablets. Instead, there was an incomparably sacred feeling!

“The Extreme Light Pavilion is where the foundation of the Extreme Medicine Sect lies. Only pavilion elders and the sect master have the qualification to enter this place! The memorial tablets enshrined here are all our

Extreme Medicine Sect’s predecessors. Those whose cultivation reached grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven will leave behind a wisp of source aura on their deathbed. In the course of time, this place became

the Extreme Medicine Sect’s land of destiny. Our Extreme Medicine Sect also prospered with each passing day! Although Ancestor Cloudmount said to let you enter the Extreme Light Pavilion, you must pay respects to

the predecessors and obtain their recognition before you’re considered the Extreme Light Pavilion’s pavilion elder!” Song Qingyang said.

Ye Yuan’s heart also turned somber as he listened.

There were no less than 3000 memorial tablets before this eyes!

So many grand completion Emperor Sakra Heavens had actually appeared in the Extreme Medicine Sect!

Ye Yuan heard Mi Tian said before that source aura was the crux to step into Hegemon Realm.

Only by reaching grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven could one have the possibility of comprehending source aura.

Such a precious thing, these predecessors could actually bear to leave them in their own memorial tablets.

It was also no wonder that the present Extreme Medicine Sect was like the noonday sun!

“Yoo, this is the new disciple that Master newly accepted? Just Saint Sovereign Heaven, Master his elderly self is really impressive, to actually find such a brat for me to be a junior apprentice brother!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s eyes blurred, an old man who was emaciated like a stick appeared in front of him, sizing him up and down with a hint of amusement in his eyes.

This old man gave Ye Yuan an unfathomable feeling.

Although he was the same as Song Qingyang, both grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven, Ye Yuan had a feeling that he was much more powerful than Song Qingyang!

Ye Yuan felt that this person might be able to break through to Hegemon Realm at any time!

When Song Qingyang saw the old man, he immediately bowed and said, “Disciple Song Qingyang pays respect to Pavilion Elder Clearcloud! Martial Uncle Ye, this is Ancestor Cloudmount’s eldest disciple, your eldest

senior brother, Li Clearcloud!”

Ye Yuan’s heart turned somber, and he said with a bow, ” Ye Yuan offered greetings to Eldest Senior Brother!”

Li Clearcloud’s mouth curled, and he suddenly yelled loudly, “Little bastards, all come out for me and pay respect to your little martial uncle! Do you all think that you can get through this hurdle? Humph humph, if that

old fellow finds out, you guys will get it!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

With his roar, one figure after another suddenly appeared in the great hall, their expressions very awkward.

Each and every one of those who came out had extremely powerful auras. But compared to Li Clearcloud, they were still a notch inferior.

But, compared to Song Qingyang, they were significantly stronger.

One look and you could tell that these people were very old, it was just that their expressions were a little ugly.

“P-Paying respects to Little Martial Uncle!” An old man with age spots all over his face bowed toward Ye Yuan with an embarrassed look..
