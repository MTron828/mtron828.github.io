1414 Playing Cat and Mouse

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh ...

Several dozen sword lights tore across the sky, lighting up breathtakingly.

Bai Chen only felt a blur before his eyes, and his long spear pierced right through his opponent’s chest without the slightest hindrance.

Bai Chen had yet to have time to rejoice when he discovered that fresh blood sprayed off the other party’s body, then he broke off into several pieces.

The other party opened his eyes wide, not understanding how he died towards the end.

Bai Chen opened his eyes wide too, similarly not understanding how his opponent died.

Very clearly, it had nothing to do with his spear at all.

Not just Bai Chen, his several followers were stunned in place too.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh ...

The Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s powerhouses were all diced into pieces; deader than dead.

“What ... What happened just now?”

“S-So strong!”

“T-Too strong! This is a true expert!”

Bai Chen’s followers all drew a cold breath, gazes looking towards Ye Yuan in horror.

That expression, there was surprise, gratefulness, but even more, it was fear!

In a blink of an eye, annihilated over a dozen Grotto Profound Deity Realm powerhouses. Among them, even included a half-step Heaven Glimpse powerhouse.

This kind of strength, they did not dare to imagine it at all!

Even if a Heaven Glimpse powerhouse was here, he probably could not do it so neat and tidily either, right?

Those were over a dozen deity realm powerhouses. He actually killed them like chopping melons and vegetables!

Mo Yun’s face was white as a sheet, the muscles on his body shivering endlessly because of fear.

What did he do previously?

Slammed a palm at Ye Yuan?

Was he tired of living? Wanting to seek death?

That Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s middle-aged man’s strength was similar to his, but the former was exterminated by Ye Yuan without even reacting in time.

He absolutely would not last an additional half a breath’s time in front of him either!

The shock that this opening move of Ye Yuan brought was too intense.

Mo Yun sucked in a breath deeply, forcefully suppressing the horror in his heart, and bowed to Ye Yuan and said, “Mo Yun has wronged Your Excellency previously, resulting in doing a foolish thing. Many thanks to Your Excellency for disregarding my former suspicions and saving our lives! Mo Yun is aware that I’m guilty, Your Excellency, please punish! It’s just that ... Your Excellency, please let Young Lord Bai Chen off!”

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled, hurriedly saying, “Ye ... Your Excellency, Teacher Mo Yun was just anxious to protect his student. Your Excellency, please give him a way out! Bai Chen is willing to pay any price!”

Mo Yun watched him grow up all the way, like a master and like a father. The two people’s relationship was extremely good.

Letting Bai Chen helplessly watch Mo Yun be killed, he could not do it.

Mo Yun’s expression changed and he said, “Young Lord, don’t need to plead. Mo Yun offended His Excellency and has committed a capital offense! For His Excellency to make a move and save us is already magnanimous and broad-minded! Young Lord, don’t need to plead for Mo Yun!”

Ye Yuan looked at this master and disciple, two people, and could not help feeling somewhat funny, but was also rather touched.

This Bai Chen was pure in nature, very much to his liking. Otherwise, he would not have made a move earlier as well.

Ye Yuan suddenly grinned and said, “If you guys keep arguing here, that fellow is going to escape.”

Mo Yun’s expression changed. It was only now he detected that Bai Chong did not die yet and already escaped like a wisp of smoke.

Ye Yuan making a move just now, Bai Chong was scared silly too, directly freezing there.

Now, seeing Mo Yun master and disciple having small talk with Ye Yuan, how could he still care about so much, hurriedly escaping.

Mo Yun gave a cold snort, his figure flying out like lightning.

His strength was much greater than Bai Chong’s. But Bai Chong took the lead and already flew out far away. Mo Yun actually could not catch up for some time.

Bai Chen’s expression changed. If Bai Chong were to run, there would be no end of future troubles!

In his anxiety, he could not refrain from begging Ye Yuan, “Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan was not long-winded either. Waving a hand, a sword slashed out.

This sword, everybody saw it clearly.

Bai Chen and his followers’ expressions were white as paper, being deeply shocked by this sword.

They were still singing their own praises previously, feeling that they saved Ye Yuan’s life.

Actually, he was completely disdainful to take action!

Bai Chen suddenly understood why the Lion Mirage Beast was so subdued this time, being brought down by him with two or three hits.

It was completely in fear of Ye Yuan!

The swift and fierce sword light streaked across the horizon as if splitting the entire sky into two halves.

Wrapped in an outrageous momentum, this streak of sword light arrived first despite launching later, cutting off Bai Chong’s path in virtually a blink.

Bai Chong was currently sprinting crazily when suddenly, an earth-shaking sword light cut right across ahead, scaring his pants off. How could he still run?

With this delay, Mo Yun’s figure was like lightning, finally catching up.

Bai Chong was scared by this sword’s shocking presence until his legs turned soft. How could he still be Mo Yun’s match? He immediately had his divine sea sealed by Mo Yun and carried back like a chicken.

When Bai Chen saw this, he heaved a great sigh in relief and said gratefully, “Many thanks, Your Excellency, for taking action!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Alright, this matter is done, I should go too. Don’t need to see me off.”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and was about to leave.

Bai Chen’s expression changed and he hurriedly shouted, “Your Excellency!”

“Mn? Is there still anything else?”

Bai Chen said, “I wonder ... where Your Excellency is going?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Wandering around the world, without any permanent residence.”

Bai Chen was delighted the moment he heard. It turned out that Lord Ye Yuan was a reclusive expert. He did not expect that his luck was so good, to actually run into him.

Otherwise, the one dead today would probably be him.

“Since Your Excellency doesn’t have a play to go, why not go to the White Night Sacred Palace to be a guest. How about that? For Your Excellency’s life-saving grace, Bai Chen has nothing to repay with. Please allow me to carry out the hospitality of a ghost,” Bai Chen looked at Ye Yuan and said with hopeful eyes.

Ye Yuan naturally did not really want to leave. He just played a little cat and mouse trick, that was all.

He had long seen through that this Bai Chen’s identity was probably not ordinary in the Sky Foothill World. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Furthermore, the faction that Bai Chen was at was called White Night Sacred Palace, while the Sky Foothill World’s supreme ruler was the Sky Foothill Divine Palace. There might be some connection between the two.

Entering the White Night Sacred Palace, he might be able to inquire about the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone’s information.

It was just that, Ye Yuan also knew that the trial-takers who entered the Sky Foothill World over the years were quite a number too, all aiming for these few items.

If Ye Yuan’s goal was too obvious, it would probably arouse people’s suspicions.

Hence, this matter still needed gradual planning.

Ye Yuan deliberately fell silent for a moment, and said with a nod, “Alright then. I’m unoccupied, no harm in going to do a little sightseeing either.”

Bai Chen was overjoyed the moment he heard and repeatedly said, “Great! Many thanks, Your Excellency, for giving face!”

At this time, Mo Yun escorted Bai Chong and rushed over, directly pressing, pressing until he knelt on the ground.

Bai Chen’s face fell and he said furiously, “Bai Chong, I’ve always treated you as a biological elder brother and was incomparably respectful towards you from young! Even if you were dissatisfied with me, I wouldn’t fuss about anything either! But you actually colluded with the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s people and did this kind of thing today! It really chills my, this younger brother’s, heart!”

Bai Chong hugged Bai Chen’s thigh and said, “My good younger brother, I ... I was wrong! I really know that I was wrong! I ... I was muddleheaded for a moment! I beg you, beg you to let me off!”

Bai Chen said with a cold smile, “I know that you all say that I’m weak and incompetent in private, unworthy of this position of young lord! But I’m not stupid! This kind of explanation, you go say it to Royal Father!”
