Chapter 1819 Treading on the Waves

On the vast expanse of water, a small rowboat slowly advanced.

All around was a stretch of white fog lingering, unable to see one’s fingers when the hands were stretched out.

Powerful restriction powers came from all around, making Ye Yuan and the rest secretly startled.

The Bamboo Groove Divine Temple was indeed incomparably powerful. It actually turned such a vast ocean into their forbidden land.

Nobody urged the small boat, but it just drifted on the ocean just like that.

Rumble!

Suddenly, the small boat rocked violently. The bow of the boat swayed and actually plunged into a cloud of mist. Even if it was face to face, one could not see their companions clearly too.

“Everyone, be careful. We are entering the restrictions storm. The undulations of the power of laws are incredible. Everybody needs to avoid the power of restrictions. Otherwise, if you fall into the Spirit Nether Sea, no one can save you!”

From the bow, came Zhu Wen’s warning.

Everyone’s hearts went slightly cold, each carefully avoiding the power of restrictions.

No idea how long had passed either. The party finally passed out of the fog and returned to the normal sea.

Suddenly, Baili Qingyan’s face changed and she said, “Where’s Ye Yuan? Ye Yuan is gone!”

Everyone looked sideways and discovered that the Ye Yuan who was originally at the stern of the boat was really gone.

Xu Yan’s face fell and he said, “Zhu Wen, this kind of thing had never happened before in the past, what’s going on here?”

How could Xu Yan still not understand? Zhu Wen had resentment arise in his heart and deliberately set up a stumble, sending Ye Yuan down.

Unknowingly, Xu Yan even changed his term of address.

Ye Yuan was this Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s latent growth stock. Xu Yan thought very highly of him. Now that he was gone, how could he not be angry?

When Ye Yuan was a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, he could only fight with the First Firmament Celestial Deity Realm Qian Ye until neither could gain the upper-hand. Now that he broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm, his strength would really be hard to gauge.

But Xu Yan felt that Ye Yuan should have no problem matching up against Second Firmament Celestial Deities.

As for how far he could go, it was really hard to tell.

Such a great black horse was actually gone now, Xu Yan’s entire person felt dreadful.

Zhu Wen sneered in his heart, but feigned ignorance on the surface as he said, “Didn’t encounter in the past doesn’t mean that the Spirit Nether Sea is without dangers. The power of restrictions here will often undergo changes. A single misstep and even True God powerhouses will fall inside. Just now, that was just a minor restriction undulation, that’s how we could be safe and sound. Elder Xu, not that I’m saying you, but your disciple’s strength is too weak, right? You look, aren’t the rest fine?”

He naturally did it on purpose. This Spirit Nether Sea, outsiders did not know, but he was very familiar with it.

Zhu Wen deliberately went off course and had a small contact with the restriction.

And the place of contact was precisely the stern of the boat where Ye Yuan was at.

The stern was naturally also the place where the law undulations were the strongest.

Baili Qingyan’s eyes turned red and she said angrily, “You’re despicable and shameless! Turn around right now for me, I’m going to look for Ye Yuan!”

But Zhu Wen shook his head and said, “Can’t find anymore. This Spirit Nether Sea changes myriad of times in a twinkle. Dropping into the sea, he would definitely trigger the power of restrictions, it’s already impossible to come back.”

Baili Qingyan’s eyes turned red and she said angrily, “I ... I’ll fight it out with you!”

Zhu Wen said coolly, “If you want to make everyone be buried together with you, then feel free to give it a try!”

Xu Yan grabbed hold of Baili Qingyan and said in a cold voice, “Don’t be rash, wait until we get ashore before talking!”

Baili Qingyan’s tears rolled down. But she was unable to resist the powerful Xu Yan and could only give up.

But her gaze when looking at Zhu Wen was icy-cold.

But Zhu Wen smiled coldly in his heart. Toward Baili Qingyan’s threat, he did not take it to heart at all.

Although Baili Qingyan’s strength was decent, wanting to pass the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave was still a little forceful.

As long as she could not enter the temple, there was nothing to discuss.

Before long, an island appeared in everyone’s eyes.

Stepping onto the island, Baili Qingyan immediately turned into a stream of flowing light and rushed over towards Zhu Wen.

Zhu Wen seemed to have long expected it and casually pointed a finger out.

“Break for me!”

Zhu Wen gave a cold cry. Baili Qingyan only felt a tremendous force transmit over, directly being knocked flying back.

The disparity between Zhu Wen and her was too great! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Humph! Overestimating your own ability! If not looking on the account of Elder Xu’s face, I’d have killed you just now!” Zhu Wen said with a cold snort.

Baili Qingyan looked at Zhu Wen coldly and said in a chilly voice, “Just you wait, there will come a day where I’ll take revenge for Ye Yuan!”

Zhu Wen pursed his lips and said disdainfully, “That will have to depend on whether you can pass the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave or not! But in my view, the hope isn’t big.”

Xu Yan also felt a wave of anger well up in his heart and he said in a solemn voice, “Zhu Wen, you’re too much! Today’s matter, I’ll definitely report it to Lord Envoy and request him to uphold justice.”

But Zhu Wen did not care at all and just said with a faint smile, “Go ahead!”

Seeing Zhu Wen’s attitude, Xu Yan’s heart also sunk.

In front of the temple, they all, these True God powerhouses, really did not have any right to speak at all!

“Eh? You guys look, there seems to be someone on the Spirit Nether Sea!” Yi Qingxiang suddenly said.

Everyone’s face changed, looking over in the direction Yi Qingxiang pointed at. Sure enough, they discovered that a small black dot was currently closing in on here.

Although everyone’s eyesight was excellent, the sea was foggy, they could not see the actual situation too.

“Could it be ... Ye Yuan?” Xu Yan said in surprise.

Zhu Wen’s expression similarly changed, both eyes narrowing into a line, seemingly wanting to see through the fog.

But, there was indeed a black figure swaying about inside the fog, currently coming towards the shore.

“This ... How is this possible?” Zhu Wen said with an astonished look.

When Baili Qingyan saw the flickering figure, she was immediately overjoyed.

“It’s definitely Ye Yuan! It must be Ye Yuan!” Baili Qingyan said excitedly.

That figure got closer and closer, the outline also became clearer and clearer.

In the end, everyone could see a slightly thin figure currently speeding like the wind over to this side, sweeping up waves.

And he came treading on the waves.

“It’s real! He didn’t die! He really didn’t die!” The agitated Baili Qingyan was somewhat incoherent in speech.

But, at this time, no one paid attention to these.

All of the people including Xu Yan were all inexplicably in shock.

“This ... This is impossible! Apart from the temple’s disciples, no one has ever been able to pass through the Spirit Nether Sea! He ... How did he do it?”

Zhu Wen had a look of disbelief. This scene in front of him was seriously too fantastical.

Ye Yuan stepped on massive waves and walked over leisurely like he was a surfer.

“You can’t, doesn’t mean Ye Yuan can’t! Now, you must be very disappointed, right?”

Baili Qingyan smiled coldly, her gaze looking at Zhu Wen was full of disdain.

Seeing Zhu Wen’s expression, she was also incomparably delighted in her heart.

In her heart, the temple had always been an extremely sacred place; incomparably holy.

But now, seeing Zhu Wen’s performance, she had a trace of wavering in her heart.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan took a step and flew to the shore.

Baili Qingyan burst into tears of joy. She immediately pounced forward and started sobbing.

Ye Yuan was also struck dumb with amazement by this scene. But he still lightly patted Baili Qingyan’s shoulder and consoled, “It’s fine, it’s all over.”
