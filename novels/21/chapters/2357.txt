Chapter 2363: Rank Two Sword Source!

“The combined attack of 17 peak unpredictable children, it’s too terrifying!”

“That kid is probably already blown into flying ashes, right?”

“To think that he still bragged, saying to challenge one-versus-17. Now, his face is slapped swollen, right?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

... ...

Feeling the horrifying undulations coming from inside the cage, the million unpredictable children were all shocked.

This kind of horrifying power, dealing with one person at the same time, even if he was a bastion of iron, he would also have to be blasted to smithereens.

Before taking action, the aura already billowed to the clouds.

Attacking at this time, that was truly startling heaven and earth and making gods and ghosts wept.

The 17 children displayed their strength to the fullest expression of its beauty and form.

They had the intention of embarrassing Ye Yuan and naturally did not show the least bit of mercy.

An unpredictable child said with a big laugh, “Hahaha, really awesome! Who asked you to be arrogant! See if you still don’t die!”

Even for them, this was also similarly the first time joining forces to deal with one person.

They did not imagine that 17 people joining forces could actually erupt with such terrifying power.

That torrential and grandiose scene made their blood seethe with excitement too.

At this time, they felt like they could smash the sky!

That pleasant sensation of being filled with power made them feel intoxicated.

Pang Zhen sneered and said, “A fool who overestimated his own ability! You don’t know how terrifying our power is at all! You are merely a pitiful frog at the bottom of a well; that’s all!”

Yu Tanzhi burst out laughing and said, “Haha, Brother Pang is right! This kid is merely a frog at the bottom of a well!”

After a bout of wanton bombardment, everyone also felt rather drained, only then, each pulling back their cultivation method.

But that region of space was still being blanketed by all kinds of violent energies.

As if everything was being annihilated.

That place was already a dead place. It was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to survive.

“Alright, finished off this punk! Now, it’s your turn, Wan Zhen!” Pang Zhen said with a cold smile.

Wan Zhen was also dumbfounded with shock by the scene before his eyes. Under such an intense attack, even if he comprehended five great sources, it was also impossible to survive.

Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

At this time, inside Cloudaid City, Zhang Lian suddenly opened his mouth and said, “If Ye Yuan died, he should be revived here! Has he come back?”

A word woke up the dreamer!

In the city, tens of thousands of people looked around.

“Nope!”

“Didn’t see!”

“There doesn’t seem to be Ye Yuan!”

“Could it be that ... he didn’t die? How is that possible?”

... ...

Everyone was extremely shocked, discovering that Ye Yuan did not appear in Cloudaid City.

They did not dare to believe that under such a horrifying attack, Ye Yuan was actually still not dead.

“All in such a hurry for what? The fighting’s not over at my side yet!” A leisurely voice came out from the vacuum zone over there.

At the same time, the faces of the million unpredictable children changed at the same time.

“Impossible! Like this and he’s not even dead?”

“It’s too ridiculous, right? That area of space is already shattered!”

“How did this guy do it?”

... ...

Ye Yuan’s figure gradually appeared, and the faces of each and every one of the 17 children all became incomparably ugly.

At this time, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body was somewhat disorderly.

But, he did not receive a fatal blow!

Pang Zhen’s pupils constricted and he said in shock, “This is impossible! You ... You’re actually not dead yet!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Nothing is impossible! I said it, there’s no difference dealing with one of you or 17 people. Since you all have already tested the waters, then now ... it’s my turn!”

As Ye Yuan said it casually, his fingers lifted lightly and he said, “Sword, come!”

As if hearing Ye Yuan’s summon, a mysterious power of law reverberated between heaven and earth.

Buzzing ...

“This ... My sword!”

“What’s going on here? My sword isn’t listening to orders anymore!”

“Where do you think you’re running! Stay with me! Ahh!”

... ...

Countless sword cries sounded out. Of the one million unpredictable children, as long as it was someone who used the sword, the swords on them all lost control at this moment, breaking free!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

... ...

Countless streams of flowing light tore across the horizon, flying into the cage.

The cage was an independent space, it could be said to be a realm within a realm of the Primeval War Realm.

But at this moment, it was as if the barrier of the cage did not exist, allowing those flying swords to pass through freely.

The sword was the leader of a hundred weapons, there were many swordsmen to begin with.

The swords flying over at this time numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

When the 17 children saw such a scene, each and every one of them was shocked until they stared dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

This turn of events was too ruthless, right?

“Rank two Sword Source! He gained enlightenment on it!” Pang Zhen’s expression became incomparably solemn.

Yu Tanzhi’s mouth opened wide and he said in shock, “Prior to this, he was clearly still rank one! Was it him who concealed his strength, or did he break through just now?”

Pang Zhen’s expression flickered incessantly and he said, “Must have broken through just now! If he concealed his strength, he didn’t have the need to forcefully resist our attacks!”

Yu Tanzhi stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied, and said, “This talent is also too terrifying, right? Gaining enlightenment on Dao at the last moment, furthermore ... it’s even the power of source!”

The so-called power of source was actually to borrow a portion of the power of rules!

Above the laws were rules!

When a certain Dao was comprehended, after reaching a certain realm, they would faintly produce a hint of understanding of the power of rules, called the power of source!

This process was divided into five levels, corresponding respectively to the Deva Five Blights!

Rules were the foundation that made up the world. They were the source of all power of laws!

But, even these unpredictable children with outstanding talents, also mostly stopped at the level of rank one in the comprehension of power of source.

Those able to reach rank two were in the minority!

Among the unpredictable children present, only Pang Zhen’s lightning law reached the level of rank two source.

This was also why he could rely on one law to forcefully resist other geniuses.

Presently, Ye Yuan also reached this level in Sword Dao!

Just now, under the frenzied bombardment of the 17 children, Ye Yuan urged the True Nirvana Sword Formation to the limit.

Two great sources coupled with laws of time and space pushed him to the limit.

Under this state, it was the easiest for Ye Yuan to break through!

And this was the fundamental reason why he challenged the 17 children.

Only by pushing himself to the limit could he make progress!

Clearly, he succeeded!

Sword Dao law was all-conquering and the sharpest. In terms of power, it was even above lightning law.

It was just that, those able to comprehend Sword Dao to this level were very few.

Sword Dao was easy to learn, but it was hard to master!

Therefore, there were many who cultivated Sword Dao law to law but comprehending Sword Dao source was extremely rare.

All along, what Ye Yuan was most proficient in, apart from Alchemy Dao, was Sword Dao.

Even spatial law was only comprehended by drawing parallels from inference after he cultivated Sword Dao to the extreme.

This time, under the powerful pressure, he broke through once again!

Comprehending rank two sword source, as long as one’s comprehension of laws was not as good as his, they would not be able to control their swords.

Therefore, those unpredictable children who used the sword, their swords all flew toward Ye Yuan, for Ye Yuan’s use!

From today onward, they would not be able to even draw their swords in front of Ye Yuan!
