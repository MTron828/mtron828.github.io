Chapter 2176: Leaving

In the deepest parts of the abyss, a light cry of surprise suddenly transmitted over.

Following that, several powerful auras started surging.

“What’s wrong, Boss?” Bai Chen’s voice came in the midst of darkness.

After being silent for a moment, the mysterious powerhouse slowly said, “That kid ... erased the imprint that you left behind!”

Bai Chen was slightly surprised and said, “This isn’t possible, right? Just based on his strength, he can discover the concealed means that I left behind? Unless ...”

“That’s right! Under the dragon spirit, nothing can hide! He ... is already acknowledged by the Dragon Mark Monument!” The mysterious powerhouse’s words carried some marveling.

“What? Old Bai just bestowed the Heavenly Dragon Mark and he obtained Divine Stele Injecting Spirit?”

“This kid has Your Father’s style back then!”

“Another Divine Stele Injecting Spirit! Looks like ... the next Dragon Ancestor is about to be born!”

The moment mysterious powerhouse’s words came out, a series of exclamation came over from the darkness.

Clearly, Divine Stele Injecting Spirit was also an extremely major thing to them as well.

Bai Chen suddenly said, “This boy, when I saw him back then, I kept feeling that he was extremely unusual! His realm was clearly not worth mentioning, but ... I had a feeling of being unable to see through. Looking at it now, this boy is indeed extraordinary!”

The mysterious powerhouse said, “Heaven shall confer great responsibility onto this person! A great era is arriving, capable people are emerging! Now that the seal is getting more and more unstable, it likely can’t last much longer. Once the abyss opens, the Heavenspan World will be plunged into an abyss of misery and suffering again! But what I’m most worried about isn’t this! Perhaps, this boy is where the hope of this era lies!”

When everyone heard that, they all fell silent.

... ...

The white light faded. Ye Yuan slowly stood up.

His upper garment was long already incinerated by blazing flames, revealing a strong muscular body.

A golden dragon was imprinted onto his chest as if it was a living thing.

Even if it was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, in front of this golden dragon, they actually also had an impulse to prostrate in worship.

If not for their realm being too high, they would probably have long already knelt down.

However, the other Sons of the Heavenly Dragon did not have this kind of strength.

This horrifying bloodline pressure directly pressured them until they knelt on the ground!

Only Long Xiaochun alone was not affected.

Long Yuan wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into. He cracked himself up to be the Dragon Clan’s number one genius. But now, he did not even have the qualifications to carry Ye Yuan’s shoes anymore!

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned, a white long robe was already put on his body.

He cupped his fists lightly toward Morningstar and said coolly, “Senior, now that things are over, this Ye takes my leave!”

Morningstar’s face changed and he hurriedly said, “Hold on! You can’t go!”

Ye Yuan frowned slightly and said unhappily, “Why? Does Senior still have something?”

Morningstar’s expression flickered incessantly and he said, “Ye Yuan, the matter previously was all this emperor’s fault! Now, this emperor sincerely welcomes you to join Heavenly Dragon Mountain!”

Ye Yuan chuckled when he heard that and said, “No need. There is little common ground for understanding between persons of differing principles! Moreover, this Ye still has more important things to do. I won’t be going up Heavenly Dragon Mountain!”

Previously, you looked down on me. Now that you saw that my bloodline was powerful, you want to keep me behind?

The pride in Ye Yuan’s heart was far greater than Long Yuan’s.

It was just that he had experienced the many vicissitudes of life and would not show it at all, that was all.

But this kind of pride was carved into his bones.

Some things, he was disdainful to do!

Morningstar’s face fell and he said, “Ye Yuan, since you obtained the Divine Stele Injecting Spirit, I’m afraid that leaving or staying isn’t up to you anymore!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed and he said with a light smile, “You want to forcefully keep me back?

Morningstar said, “If you refuse to realize your mistake, then this emperor can only take action!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh and said, “Heh, in the end, your bones still think that I’m a different species! I obtained Divine Stele Injecting Spirit. Your Heavenly Dragon Mountain ... will probably find it hard to eat and sleep after today, right?”

Morningstar’s expression was somewhat ugly, and he said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, I hope that you don’t force me to take action!”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “I, Ye Yuan, will rather break than bend! Want to make me go up the mountain, make your move then!”

At this time, Long Xiaochun suddenly blocked in front of Ye Yuan. Staring fixedly at Morningstar, she said, “Grandpa Morningstar, if you dare to make a move against Ye Yuan, I’ll never go up the mountain!”

Morningstar’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Xiaochun, this is a serious matter! Don’t mess around! Move aside!”

“I’m not moving!”

Morningstar’s two eyes narrowed, his finger pointed lightly. Long Xiaochun then fainted.

With his strength, it was too easy to deal with Long Xiaochun.

Morningstar looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “I’ll be offending you then!”

Facing an opponent like Morningstar, even if Ye Yuan obtained Divine Stele Injecting Spirit, it was also completely impossible to be a match.

A late-stage Heavenly Emperor, that was a supreme level powerhouse who was capable of truly looking down upon the world.

Morningstar had not made a move yet, and Ye Yuan felt a giant mountain-like pressure descend on his body.

Just as Morningstar was about to make a move, his expression suddenly changed drastically!

The imposing aura on his body withdrew, and he let out a sigh and said, “Forget it, leave!”

Seeing this scene, everyone could not help being very surprised.

Lord Morningstar actually shrunk back?

The Long Yuan who was originally waiting to watch a good show could not help dropping his glasses.

Just as he thought that Ye Yuan was finally going to be forced to submit, Morningstar actually brushed it over easily!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said, “Who was that person?”

His heart was akin to a clear mirror, immediately aware that it was that major power who bestowed him the Heavenly Dragon mark that gave the order.

It was just that he was very curious about that person’s identity.

Morningstar shook his head and said, “When the time is right, you’ll naturally know! Ye Yuan, remember, no matter where you go, you’ll always be my Dragon Clan’s pride!”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled, and he turned around and left.

He had a lot of fetters with the Dragon Clan and also did not have any irreconcilable conflicts, there was naturally no way to cut away.

It was just that he did not like Morningstar’s way of doing things. That was all.

After Ye Yuan left, Long Tianyu’s face revealed an indignant expression and he said, “Lord Morningstar, letting him go just like that? On his body, there’s the Dragon Clan’s destiny!”

Although he did not want to admit it, Long Tianyu still had no choice but to admit that Ye Yuan’s talent already exceeded their understanding.

The significance of Ye Yuan’s existence was also far more important than they imagined!

How could such a person move around freely outside?

Morningstar’s face fell and he yelled coldly, “Does this emperor still need you to direct me how to do things? Get lost!”

Long Tianyu’s expression changed, and he could only retreat to one side obediently.

Morningstar currently needed a target to vent at this time and Long Tianyu ran out.

Scold who if not him?

At this time, Morningstar’s heart was surging turbulently like a tsunami!

It turned out that that legendary lord was actually still alive!

It turned out that Ye Yuan’s Heavenly Dragon Mark was actually bestowed by him!

Ye Yuan was actually the person that he picked!

How many years had he already not appeared?

Including those supreme powerhouses of Heavenly Dragon Mountain, they all also thought that that lord had already died long ago.

Morningstar did not think that he was actually still living in this world!

This news made his mind, a late-stage Heavenly Emperor’s mental state, shook.

Earlier, in front of Ye Yuan, he barely managed to maintain composure and nearly broke decorum.

He was thinking, if anything really happened to Ye Yuan earlier, would that lord directly smack him to death with one slap or not?
