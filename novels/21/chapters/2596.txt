Chapter 2602: Can’t Continue Posturing Anymore!

With two great supreme powerhouses confronting each other, it made everyone’s breathing become ragged.

One was a veteran overlord, a saber god of his generation who had once dragged He Yunxiang down the horse.

The other was a new king who challenged the entire Resplendent Sun City with one sword!

To which direction these two people’s fight would develop, it stirred up everyone’s nerves.

“Back then, He Yunxiang and Changsun Xingyu fought fiercely for 300 rounds before they barely managed to determine the victor! Now, Changsun Xingyu defeated him with a light palm, the two are already not on the same level anymore!”

“Ten years of Dao debate, Changsun Xingyu has already been reborn anew!”

“No matter how formidable this boy is, it’s also impossible to be Changsun Xingyu’s match anymore!”

… …

The striking impressiveness of this palm immediately let everyone realize Changsun Xingyu’s terror.

Although Ye Yuan was powerful, it was impossible to reach Changsun Xingyu’s height.

After all, that battle previously where Ye Yuan fought one-versus-six, he barely managed to win too.

Changsun Xingyu looked at Ye Yuan and said with a faint smile, “Brat, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance. I’ll only unleash one saber cut. If you can block it and not die, I, Changsun Xingyu, will leave you with an intact corpse!”

The words were full of contempt.

In his view, it was impossible for Ye Yuan to block his saber cut.

Even if he blocked it, he would be seriously injured on the verge of death too.

Then he would grant him death!

Everyone’s expressions turned fearful, feeling Changsun Xingyu’s killing intent.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said indifferently, “This saber cut of yours, I’ll receive it! If it can harm me, I’ll leave you with an intact corpse!”

“Hiss …”

Domineering!

There were already glints and flashes of cold steel in these two people’s speeches.

Changsun Xingyu gave a cold laugh and said, “Sect disciples like you really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Forget it. Since you’re wholeheartedly seeking death, I’ll send you off then!”

His voice had yet to fade and Changsun Xingyu moved!

Only to see him take a step out, the saber intent on his body billowed straight to the sky!

Amidst this sharp and fierce saber intent actually even had other power of rules mixed inside.

The rule of life!

The rule of death!

These two great rules fused perfectly together with Changsun Xingyu’s saber intent, forming into one entity!

Everyone’s countenance changed visibly.

Under the coercion of this saber intent, they actually fell back without prior agreement.

They could not withstand this saber intent!

Even He Yunxiang and Di Xing could not withstand it either!

He Yunxiang’s face was first shocked, following that was a bitter smile.

“I didn’t expect that in ten years, his life and death saber intent has actually already been perfected to this point! It’s already akin to heaven and earth between me and him! Looks like I gambled wrongly this time!” He Yunxiang said with a bitter smile.

Di Xing said in shock, “Didn’t expect that Changsun Xingyu’s talent was so strong! Looks like even if that boy has hidden means, it’s also impossible to be his match anymore. Let alone that Changsun Xingyu is a minor realm higher than him!”

He Yunxiang had a firm look as he said, “If he doesn’t make a move within three steps, he won’t have the chance to make a move any longer! With this saber cut, he’ll definitely die!”

Di Xing nodded slightly, expressing his approval.

Because Changsun Xingyu was accumulating momentum!

Once the saber momentum was formed, it would be a heaven exterminating power!

Ye Yuan absolutely could not stop it!

While talking, Changsun Xingyu took another step. The saber intent rose again!

This rise directly doubled!

Under this saber intent’s oppression, everyone retreated again and again!

Everyone’s faces became incomparably solemn.

Only Ye Yuan remained unmoving!

He did not seem to feel this saber intent and did not have the intention of using his sword. He just looked at Changsun Xingyu quietly like this.

He Yunxiang shook his head and said, “This boy is still lacking in knowledge and experience in the end! Not making a move at this time, he won’t have the chance to make a move any longer!”

Di Xing said, “Fool, what is this guy thinking in his head? Not making a move at this time, is he going to wait until his saber momentum is achieved, then take action?”

Changsun Xingyu looked at Ye Yuan and said with a faint smile, “Boy, your composure is pretty good! But if I take this final step, you won’t have the chance to live anymore! Are you sure that you want to wait?”

He was extremely confident in his saber momentum. Although he did not plan on using his full strength, the saber momentum of three steps was sufficient to kill Ye Yuan!

When Ye Yuan heard that, he just smiled faintly and said, “If I don’t let you posture to your heart’s content, you won’t feel satisfied too! Bring it on!”

Changsun Xingyu’s face turned black and killing intent immediately arose!

This boy was not looking for abuse in an ordinary way!

Even He Yunxiang they all were also stunned.

Witnessing Changsun Xingyu’s heaven-defying combat power, this guy could still be so cheeky?

Could it be that he really had some reliance?

But, thinking about it, He Yunxiang still denied this notion.

Changsun Xingyu’s success was not just the countless times of life and death fights, his talent itself was also extremely monstrous, that was how he had today’s achievements.

And Ye Yuan should be the talented type of powerhouse.

Compared to fighting, Changsun Xingyu shook him off by more than ten streets!

Therefore, even if the two were similarly talented, it was absolutely impossible for Ye Yuan to be Changsun Xingyu’s match too!

Just as everyone was shocked at Ye Yuan’s ignorance, Changsun Xingyu took the third step!

This third step, it doubled the momentum again on the foundation of the second step!

The saber intent at this time had already condensed until it was corporeal, fearsome until it made people’s heads tingle.

Changsun Xingyu gave a cold snort and said, “Brat, today, I’ll use my saber to tell you that the price of wild arrogance is death!”

Finished saying, Changsun Xingyu took out a saber from god knows where, and a saber cut left!

This saber cut was silent!

Everything seemed to be at a standstill!

Everyone only felt a life and death samsara intent, lingering in their hearts. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Although this saber intent was not directed at him, they were all greatly affected.

As if they had died and lived again, lived and died again.

That horror of pacing back and forth between life and death almost made them asphyxiate.

And the Ye Yuan who was in the center of the storm, the pressure that he was enduring could be imagined.

However, in the instant that Changsun Xingyu unleashed his saber, there was finally a change on Ye Yuan’s body.

“Universe … Sword Formation!”

Three power of rules instantly hovered beside Ye Yuan.

Rays of sword light became illusory.

It turned into a domain around Ye Yuan!

Not sword intent, but a sword formation that condensed and formed after three kinds of power of rules fused.

Changsun Xingyu was currently being pleased with himself. When he saw this change, his expression could not help changing wildly.

But at this time, it was already too late to pull back the saber momentum.

He was not prepared to pull back the saber too!

Boom!

The life and death saber intent erupted with tremendous energy when it faced off against the Universe Sword Formation, directly sending everyone flying out.

Many people were even crushed into meat paste by the sword intent and saber intent that scattered flying everywhere.

This strike was utterly fearsome!

Ye Yuan and Changsun Xingyu each fell back several dozen steps before barely managing to stabilize their figures.

The two people were evenly-matched!

Changsun Xingyu looked at Ye Yuan with a shocked face as he exclaimed in surprise, “Sword Dao rule! Spatial rule! Formation Dao rule! Boy, you concealed so deeply!”

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “It’s not that I concealed deeply, but that no one could force my full strength out. You’re not bad. You did it. But you can’t continue posturing anymore. What a shame. You failed to harm me. Therefore, I don’t plan on leaving you with an intact corpse anymore either!”

Changsun Xingyu’s expression turned dark, his eyes full of coldness.

Shock was written all over the faces of He Yunxiang and the others!

No one expected that the strength that Ye Yuan concealed was actually this strong!
