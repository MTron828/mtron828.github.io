Chapter 1328: Catching Turtles in a Pot

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The appearance of Wang Tutao and the rest caught the Yin Wind Seven Heroes by surprise. They were stunned too.

But Chang Liang reacted extremely quickly, understanding what was going on virtually right away.

At the same time, he could not help being secretly alarmed.

Wasn’t it said that the Myriad Treasure Tower’s alchemist was a cripple who could not cultivate? How could he have such formidable strength?

The current Chang Liang already ascertained that that youth who entered the Ghost King Cave was precisely the Myriad Treasure Tower’s guest alchemist. It was Ye Yuan!

“This lord, this Chang doesn’t understand what you mean? If this Chang has the capability to destroy the spectroscope, then I also wouldn’t need to strive in this Yin Wind Den all year round!” Chang Liang said with cupped fists.

His mind flashed like lightning and knew that only by refusing to admit even unto death at present could he have a slim chance of survival.

In reality, he really did not expect that Ye Yuan was the person the Wang Family was looking for.

But Wang Yutao sneered coldly when he heard that and said, “You don’t need to quibble anymore. I only believe the truth I see with my eyes! We’ve already inquired clearly. After that punk entered the Yin Wind Den, it has always been you guys leading the way for him. Just based on this point, you all deserve death!”

Chang Liang groaned in secret, but his expression was in a daze as he said, “Your Excellency, this lowly one really doesn’t know what you’re talking about! There was a youth who offered 7000 pieces of divine essence stones to have us lead the way. But ... this Chang also didn’t know that that was the person Your Excellency wanted to find!”

Wang Yutao said coldly, “No matter how glib your tongue, helping that boy is also a fact! Come, men, take them down for me! If there is resistance, capture and immediately execute!”

Wang Yutao’s words thoroughly extinguished the last trace of Chang Liang’s hope for a fluke. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

His expression changed, and he said gravely, “Brothers, enter the cave!”

At this time, the other three sides were all blocked off. The Ghost King Cave at the back was the only retreat path.

The figures of Chang Liang, the seven of them, were like lightning, speeding over towards the Ghost King Cave.

Seeing this, Wang Yutao snorted coldly. Raising his hand, it was a palm!

“A bunch of people who have no idea of life or death!”

Powerful divine essence instantly exploded. A terrifying air billow swept over towards the seven people.

Chang Liang revealed a horrified look and cried out, “Brothers, you all go in!”

He unleashed all of his strength in this lifetime, wanting to deal with Wang Yutao’s blow.

However, this was merely an ant trying to topple a tree!

Facing the grand completion Grotto Profound Wang Yutao, Chang Liang did not have the least bit of strength to resist.

However, Chang Liang already made the resolve to die. He wanted to protect his brothers to enter the cave!

Although the ‘Yin Wind Seven Heroes’ were not some good people, when facing such an imminent disaster, adversity tests friendship.

Boss Chang Liang blocked the spear for his brothers without the slightest hesitation!

But right at this time, two figures suddenly dashed out, covering up Chang Liang’s profile.

“Big Brother, live well and take revenge for us!”

It was Number Three and Number Seven!

Chang Liang’s eyes turned bloodshot, his two eyes scarlet-red.

But Wang Yutao’s palm-force already arrived. Even if he wanted to do something, it was too late as well!

Boom!

An enormous force directly blasted Number Three and Number Seven, together with Chang Liang, flying.

However, the majority of the force was blocked by Number Three and Number Seven.

Chang Liang vomited a mouthful of fresh blood with a ‘wah.’ Number Three and Number Seven beside him had long ceased breathing already.

Chang Liang was very decisive. He knew that now was not the time to be irresolute and hesitant. Forcefully crawling up, he headed over towards the Ghost King Cave.

Although this palm of Wang Yutao killed Number Three and Number Seven, Chang Liang also borrowed the force of this palm and arrived at the Ghost King Cave’s entrance.

His figure speed, burrowing straight into the cave.

“Second Brother, what do we do now?” Wang Yugan asked.

“What else can we do? Go in and capture the people! Right now, we’re catching turtles in a pot!” Wang Yutao said without the least bit of hesitation.

At this time, a martial artist said rather fearfully, “Y-Your Excellency, this place is the Ghost King Cave!”

This martial artist was the guide that the Wang Family found.

Wang Yutao’s face fell, and he said, “So what if it’s the Ghost King Cave?”

The guide said, “The Ghost King Cave is the most dangerous place in the Yin Wind Den, the evil spirits inside too many to count. Furthermore, the Ghost King Cave’s depths might have Two-star evil spirits existing! Once we startle the Two-star evil spirit, none of us can escape!”

Wang Yutao’s expression also turned apprehensive when he heard that, but he became relieved very quickly and said with a cold snort, “What about that? I don’t believe that that brat dares to enter the depths of the Ghost King Cave! Go!”

That guide was helpless and could only enter the Ghost King Cave.

...

Chang Liang five people had also never entered the Ghost King Cave before. This place was all human martial artists’ forbidden area.

So after entering, Chang Liang five people ran wildly without distinguishing the direction at all.

But what made them surprised was that along the way, they actually did not even encounter a single evil spirit!

No idea how long they ran either, they suddenly saw that there was a figure ahead, currently sitting cross-legged.

“Big Brother, it ... it’s that kid!”

“If not for this boy, Number Three and Number Seven wouldn’t have died either! This score, we have to find him to settle it properly!”

“Big Brother, kill this kid! Take revenge for Number Three and Number Seven!”

These few people were almost in tears when talking. Clearly, the death of Number Three and Number Seven, they were all unable to accept it.

They knew that they were forever not Wang Yutao’s match. Therefore, they cast the anger onto Ye Yuan.

Chang Liang’s injuries were not light. Currently, he was forcefully holding onto a breath.

Seeing the appearance of his group of brothers filled with righteous indignation, Chang Liang’s expression was also ugly to the extreme.

“Brothers, every injustice had its perpetrator, every debt its debtor! Number Three and Number Sevenwere killed by Wang Yutao. Want to settle this score, we also have to settle it with them! Us and Master Ye only did a transaction. Putting this score on his head isn’t fair!” Chang Liang said.

Ye Yuan slowly opened his eyes and looked at Chang Liang with some surprise, and slowly opened his mouth to say, “The Wang Family being so utterly devoid of conscious exceeded my expectations. But, the one who caused the deaths of Number Three and Number Seven wasn’t me, but yourselves! If you all want to count this score on this Ye’s head, this Ye will keep you company!”

Ye Yuan’s words made the few people explode all at once.

“We caused the death of Number Three and Number Seven? Brat, you don’t make unfounded accusations!”

“Don’t think that by killing a few evil spirits, you can scare us! You’re merely a puny little initial-stage Grotto Profound, I don’t believe that you’re really us brothers’ match!”

Chang Liang’s expression was incomparably ugly. Ye Yuan’s words made him regret to the max!

But they heard Ye Yuan saying indifferently, “The seven of you, each and every one of you had killing intent aroused towards this Ye before! Putting it bluntly, you’re all just a bunch of robbers who murder and seize goods! If not because of this, perhaps this young master would have made a move to save previously, and even brought you all into the Ghost King Cave.”

Ye Yuan’s words made Chang Liang five people shocked inwardly.

Turns out that their killing intent, Ye Yuan had long perceived it keenly. It was just that he did not expose it all along!

Now, Number Three and Number Seven died. It was a retribution for them having killing intent aroused!

Not that they did not wish to kill Ye Yuan, it was just that Chang Liang detected the danger. That was why they did not make a move.

Hence, Ye Yuan had no need to be responsible for their life and death.

Between them was merely just a transaction.

“Also, if not looking on account of your brotherly affection, do you guys think that ... you can still live to see this young master?” Ye Yuan said coolly.
