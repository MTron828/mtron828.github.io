Chapter 1875: Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean

“It’s so quiet here. It’s likely not a good place. Ye Yuan, be more careful.” The surroundings were very quiet, making a foreboding premonition arise in Gu Tianque’s heart.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “This place is extremely heavy with Yin energy, there are likely many evil abominations that come and go.”

In reality, Ye Yuan was not worried.

Dustless told him that this place was called Asura Ghost Domain, the place where Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove reared ghosts.

In this place, many powerful Ghost Dao powerhouses were being raised. There might even be an Empyrean Realm powerhouse existence.

But, with Dustless around, Ye Yuan was not worried at all.

It had already been close to a month’s time since coming out of the Heaven Killing Sword Formation.

Along the way, the few people saw quite a few dead bodies, but the three of them were safe and sound.

All this was naturally thanks to Ye Yuan.

To say that Gu Tianque did not have any ideas about the Stellar War Banner, that was impossible.

But the current Ye Yuan was already not the Celestial Deity Realm martial artist who could be bullied by anyone.

His combat strength approached Ninth Firmament True God!

Even if he had any ideas, Gu Tianque could only stifle it in his heart.

The three of them gradually penetrated deep into the Asura Ghost Domain. Suddenly, a series of fierce fighting sounds came from in front and they could not help becoming alert.

“Yang Yidao, finish off these ghosts first, otherwise, no one can think about getting the Seven-Colored Aegirine!” Ji Kang said with a furious roar.

The world power in Yang Yidao’s body erupted and he was currently locked in a tangled warfare with a peak rank six ghost.

These ghosts were all very hard to tangle with. Practically every one of them knew the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, their strength exceedingly formidable!

Ji Kang’s pressure was tremendous, dealing with several ghosts.

The others also suffered heavy losses under the encirclement of a group of ghosts.

One of the Ghost Dao powerhouses among them roared angrily, “You all, these damn humans, to actually dare have designs on the Seven-Colored Aegirine! You all deserve to die!”

The number of Ghost Dao powerhouses were too many, the humans’ situation was clearly disadvantageous.

Hearing these people’s conversation, a hint of glimmer flashed across Gu Tianque’s eyes.

“Seven-Colored Aegirine! It’s actually the Seven-Colored Aegirine!”

Ye Yuan had a look of puzzlement as he said, “Senior, what’s Seven-Colored Aegirine?”

Gu Tianque looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly and said, “Yo actually don’t know about the Seven-Colored Aegirine?”

In his view, with Ye Yuan’s identity, how could he possibly not know about the Seven-Colored Aegirine.

Ye Yuan was taken aback, secretly thinking that it was not good.

The reason why Gu Tianque was very courteous toward him was that he was wary of his identity.

He blurted out just now but did not think about this. It likely made Gu Tianque produce a trace of suspicion already.

“Oh, I heard people mention it before in the past. But as for the specifics of what effects it has, I don’t know.” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

A hint of suspicion flashed across Gu Tianque’s eyes, but he still explained, “Seven-Colored Aegirine is a specialty product of the Heavenspan Mountain. Furthermore, it only appears in the Empyrean-level area! However, this thing is too rare, one piece might not appear in a million years. If a True God Realm can acquire a piece of Seven-Colored Aegirine, stepping into the realm of Empyrean will be right around the corner! This thing, even to Empyrean Realm powerhouses, it’s also immensely useful.”

Ye Yuan was also secretly shocked when he heard it, able to let a True God break through to the Empyrean Realm. It was not surprising that these people were crazy about it.

Clearly knew that they could not beat these Ghost Dao powerhouses, but refused to retreat no matter what.

“Ye Yuan, this Seven-Colored Aegirine, we must obtain it!” A hint of fierce glint flashed across Gu Tianque’s eyes.

This was a massive open space. Behind the Ghost Dao powerhouses, there was a deep dark cave.

If there were no accidents, the Seven-Colored Aegirine should be inside that cave.

Swoosh!

Gu Tianque’s figure moved, speeding over toward that cave.

This sudden turn of events naturally alarmed the group of powerhouses.

“Gu Tianque, you dare!” Ji Kang howled.

“Gu Tianque, you deserve to die!” Yang Yidao also roared angrily.

Gu Tianque’s actions made everyone extremely indignant.

They fought fiercely for half a day. Yet, they did not expect that they actually let Gu Tianque find an opening.

However, Gu Tianque’s speed was extremely fast. In just a blink of an eye, he tunneled into that cave.

The leader of the Ghost Dao powerhouses shouted angrily, “Ghostwind, you go in and kill him! The Seven-Colored Aegirine absolutely can’t allow others to take a share!”

“Yes!” That Ghostwind received the order and also tunneled into the cave.

The moment Ghostwind left, the pressure on Ji Kang’s side reduced significantly.

“Ye Yuan, this ...” Leng Qiuling also did not expect that Gu Tianque was so decisive, and was actually at a loss on what to do for a moment.

There was no idea what kind of existence inside that cave. She was rather worried about Gu Tianque’s safety.

Ye Yuan did not move and just said, “Wait and see first. Those people who concealed their strength will likely reveal their fox tails soon as well.”

Sure enough, the leader of the Ghost Dao powerhouses suddenly howled loudly at this time and said, “Into formation! Eradicate all these people for me!”

Woo! Woo!

All of a sudden, Yin wind howled, terrifying evil ghost power surged out.

When Ji Kang and the others saw this scene, each and every one of them turned deathly pale.

Those late-stage rank six Ghost Dao powerhouses all fired out mysterious and unfathomable seals. A terrifying aura condensed and formed.

The Ghost Dao leader roared angrily, “Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean, condense!”

Roar!

An enormous Ghost Dao powerhouse condensed and formed! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The gloomy and cold aura coming off his body virtually made space become solid.

Ji Kang’s pupils constricted, his face white as a sheet as he cried out in shock, “Ghost Empyrean! G-Ghost Dao Heavenly Empyrean!”

The Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean held a curved blade made out of no idea what kind of material. A pair of deep eyes swept past, bringing everyone a feeling of death.

The Ghost Dao leader immediately knelt down and said, “Lord Ghost Empyrean, these people cast their covetous eyes on the Seven-Colored Aegirine. Your Excellency, please take action to punish!”

“Those who covet the Seven-Colored Aegirine, die!” The Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean practically squeezed these few words out of his throat, incomparably ear-piercing.

All of a sudden, the Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean cleaved a blade out, the places that it passed through, space fragmented!

The violent spatial storm brought out a massive tempest vortex. It was as if it was going to devour everything.

The countenance of Ji Kang and the rest suddenly changed, figures retreating explosively.

But, while he was fast, the Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s blade was faster!

This Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean was a true Empyrean-level powerhouse, his strength terrifying to the extreme.

But right at this time, two unbelievably powerful auras suddenly erupted among the human powerhouses.

Two clouds of black energy rose to the sky, the power was actually not much weaker than the Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean!

Another two Empyrean powerhouses!

Bang!

Bang!

Two streams of black energy fired out, directly clashing together with the Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s blade.

The Immortal Grove World’s space was like paper, shredding into pieces by these three powerful to the extreme attacks.

A fiend race Empyrean powerhouse laughed strangely and said, “Je je, even thought that I could conceal my strength until Old Fart Immortal Grove’s palace. Didn’t expect that I was forced out here!”

The other fiend race Empyrean said, “Old Fart Immortal Grove is indeed well-deserving of being a peerless powerhouse capable of contending with Lord Jiu Shang. Already dead until like this and he can actually still summon out such a terrifying Ghost Dao powerhouse!”

These two were actually both fiend race’s Empyrean powerhouses!

The three powerful attacks gradually dissipated. Space recovered bit by bit.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene, expression being ugly to the extreme.

The thing that he was most worried about indeed still happened!
