Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Yuan, I want you dead!”

Black Flood Dragon King’s roar practically made the seabed boil. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The powerhouses were all extremely shocked.

Of course, what surprised them even more was that Ye Yuan actually really stripped away the Emerald Sea Divine Conch!

The current Ye Yuan was like a ruler. The things that he bestowed upon you were all taken back.

Black Flood Dragon King completely rampaged, the aura of half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven being released fully.

It was only to see his dragon head open its gaping maws. A light ball spat out of his mouth.

“That’s the Black Flood Dragon King’s consummate skill that made him famous, Dragon Flame Bullet! It was said that back then, he used this move and defeated the Cang Xuan Sea Region’s Black Mountain Dragon King by a hair’s breadth! Looks like Black Flood Dragon King is genuinely enraged!”

“Even if Ye Yuan controls the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, he can’t escape death either. The strength of a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven is too terrifying.”

“Ye Yuan wouldn’t think that by taking in the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, he’d be able to defeat a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, right? That’s a powerful existence that has half a foot stepped into Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

… …

Seeing Black Flood Dragon King use his famed consummate skill, everyone immediately sentenced Ye Yuan to death.

Half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, although it was not a real Saint Sovereign Heaven, their strength was also far from what one could mention in the same breath as Jade Sovereign Heavens.

And Ye Yuan was just a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven.

The two people’s disparity was too great!

The moment the Dragon Flame Bullet appeared, the entire seabed was turned upside down.

That terrifying pressure made everyone keep a wide berth.

Ye Yuan was situated in the midst of the storm, without the slightest fear as he said coolly, “Black Flood Dragon King, you’ve obtained the Emerald Sea Divine Conch for so many years and look to be infinitely glorious. But you’re merely a pseudo-dragon and can’t unleash the true power of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch at all. Today, I’ll let you witness the Emerald Sea Divine Conch’s true power!”

All of a sudden, the true dragon power in Ye Yuan’s body erupted.

The entire seabed seemed to be transmitting out waves of dragon roars.

The expressions of the dragon race members present suddenly changed in an instant.

Under this pressure, they actually had an impulse to kneel down.

In reality, some dragon race members with impure bloodlines were already kneeling on the ground and could not even raise their heads.

Among them even included a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

And after the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was flooded with this dragon might, it became incomparably dazzling.

It seemed to have come to life!

Black Flood Dragon King’s pupils constricted slightly, his eyes full of astonishment.

He had never seen the Emerald Sea Divine Conch be so excited before despite being in his hands for so many years.

Yes, excitement!

Divine objects had spirits, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, this level of heaven-defying treasure, was naturally spiritual.

After all, having possessed the Emerald Sea Divine Conch for so many years, Black Flood Dragon King could faintly feel the ‘happiness’ of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch currently!

That feeling was like the regret of a bright pearl being cast into darkness for so many years in his hands.

At this time, it finally bloomed to its true colors!

“Emerald Sea Tide, Heaven-defying Torrent!”

Ye Yuan roared and the torrent of the seabed actually turned the other way in an instant.

At that moment, it was as if the entire ocean had become Ye Yuan’s weapon!

Under this torrent, Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses could not stand firmly too and were directly swept away by the torrent.

Only at this time, did they understand what was called floodwaters surging!

As the saying went, the water that could carry the boat was the same that could swallow it up.

These true spirit seafolk were all kings in the water.

They were like fish in the water.

But now they currently felt as if they were in hell.

That feeling of having no command over themselves made them feel at a loss on what to do.

Black Flood Dragon King’s expression changed wildly. These astonishing floodwaters were actually not the slightest bit inferior to his power!

He understood that this was not Ye Yuan’s own strength, but the Emerald Sea Divine Conch’s power.

Ye Yuan’s move that solved a major problem with little effort was used too breathtakingly!

His bloodline power was the lever while the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was that fulcrum.

Ye Yuan used this lever to move the power of the entire seabed.

No matter how strong the Black Flood Dragon King’s strength was, it was also impossible to be stronger than the entire ocean.

He was insignificant in the ocean!

“Dragon Flame Bullet, break for me!”

Facing such a shocking torrent, Black Flood Dragon King did not have other methods either and could only fight power with power!

Fortunately, his strength was much stronger than Ye Yuan and he still had the power to fight.

It was also thanks to Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm being low. If he was Jade Sovereign Heaven realm, this torrent could directly turn him into meat paste.

Under the watchful gazes of everyone, the Dragon Flame Bullet collided together with this astonishing torrent.

Rumble!

The violent explosion directly sank the seabed several hundred feet!

The terrifying power directly blasted those sea race powerhouses flying.

Even if they had already evaded very far away.

Black Flood Dragon King spurted fresh blood wildly from his mouth and was akin to being struck by lightning. How did he still have the demeanor of a king?

Although Ye Yuan’s complexion was a little pale too, it was not a serious problem.

Clearly, Black Flood Dragon King was defeated.

“This … Is this the true power of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch? It’s simply too terrifying!”

“It’s also that Ye Yuan is just Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum. If he reached Jade Sovereign Heaven, wouldn’t he swept across the seven great sea regions just by relying on this Emerald Sea Divine Conch?”

“More than sweep across! Even if a Saint Sovereign Heaven runs into him, they will have to give a wide berth too, right? Even the Dragon Flame Bullet can’t block the power of this torrent, it’s too terrifying!”

… …

The expressions of many sea race powerhouses were deathly pale too. Clearly, they were frightened by the power of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch.

They naturally would not think that this was Ye Yuan’s own strength. But, similarly using the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, the power was completely different in the hands of Black Flood Dragon King compared to it being in the hands of Ye Yuan.

This already indicated many problems to begin with.

At least, the dragon might in Ye Yuan’s body had obtained the true recognition of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch.

Even if Black Flood Dragon King already refined it for ten thousand years, it was useless too!

Ye Yuan looked at Black Flood Dragon King and said disdainfully, “Emerald Sea Divine Conch is a high-grade grandmist treasure, its power being boundless! Unleashing its power with your bloodline power, it doesn’t even reach 10%! It’s simply a bright pearl that’s cast into darkness in your hands! Furthermore, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch still has many brilliant uses, but you … don’t understand it at all!”

As if to confirm Ye Yuan’s words, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch circled around Ye Yuan. It was as if it was a lively elf.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help clicking their tongues in wonder.

Even a fool could also tell that the Emerald Sea Divine Conch really found its home now.

Black Flood Dragon King’s complexion was ashen, with indescribable despair on his face.

He did not expect that he actually lost so thoroughly.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I won’t offend people unless I’m offended! Originally, I only came to Thistle South Sea Region due to Jingfei’s invitation. But you had impure motives. Then it can’t be blamed on this Ye!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan formed a seal with his hands again, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch erupted with a terrifying power once more.

This time, it was the final hit.

Leaving behind a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven enemy was not Ye Yuan’s style.

“Don’t! Big Brother Ye Yuan!” Right at this time, Little Dragon Girl suddenly cried.

Ye Yuan’s movements suddenly turned stiff and he looked toward Jingfei.

Little Dragon Girl wept as she yelled, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, I beg you! Please don’t kill my royal father! He … He’s the best royal father in the world!”

When Ye Yuan heard this, his brows could not help furrowing.

Although this lass loved to play pranks, she was just not mature yet.

Previously, when Black Flood Dragon King wanted to kill him, she even spoke up to stop him. It could be seen that her character was not bad.

Now, Ye Yuan could not help feeling a little troubled..
