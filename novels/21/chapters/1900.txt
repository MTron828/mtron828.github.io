Chapter 1904: Not Giving Face.

“You ... You want to publicly execute me in order to lure Ye Yuan out?” Jiang Jadehall said with a furious roar.

Yu Jinsong had a smug look as he said smilingly, “You’re not stupid, understanding it so quickly. Today, City Lord Manor has already arranged three True God Realm experts to lie in wait around the execution ground. The moment he appears, the three great True God Realm powerhouses will attack at the same time! You guess, what will be his outcome? Hahaha!”

Jiang Jadehall was incomparably shocked in his heart. In order to deal with Ye Yuan, the City Lord Manor actually sent out three True God Realm powerhouses.

Ye Yuan’s strength was actually already powerful to such a degree?

It had just been a short few hundred years, Ye Yuan’s growth completely exceeded his imagination.

Ye Yuan barged into a dragon’s lair, a tiger’s den alone in order to save him and save Jiang Haitang. He was very touched in his heart.

This made his promise to Ye Yuan become very important.

Except, this Yu Jinsong was shameless when doing things, by fair means or foul.

If he rashly came to save him, wouldn’t he lose his life in vain?

Thinking up to here, his hatred toward Yu Jinsong was even more akin to a wave that dashed to the sky.

“You ... Despicable! Shameless! Yu Jinsong, even if I, Jiang Jadehall, become a ghost, I won’t let you off either!”

Jiang Jadehall gnashed his teeth in hatred, doing his best, wanting to break free of the shackles.

It was just a pity that this shackle was forged from purple gold divine metal. Forget that his divine sea was sealed, even normally, it was impossible to break free too.

“Become a ghost? Hehe, you need to have a chance to become a ghost too! Bring him away!”

Yu Jinsong waved his sleeves grandly, the guard escorted Jiang Jadehall and marched for the execution grounds.

Jiang Jadehall was being sent away, his face ashen.

He hated Yu Jinsong, he hated his inability! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But he was completely powerless to change anything.

“Ye Yuan, you ... shouldn’t have come!” Two rows of hot tears flowed down his face.

...

There had never been a lack of those who wanted to watch the fun. Currently, Heavenly Grove Plaza was long already packed full of people, nowhere to find a foothold at all.

“Really can’t understand why executing a puny little patrolling inspector has to cause such a big commotion.”

“Heh, you don’t know this, right? Do you know who was the girl who was rescued, slaughtering their way out of Carefree Grove? It’s this Jiang Jadehall’s daughter! This show today, the real interest of the drunkard isn’t in the wine!”

“You’re talking about that Ye Yuan? Terrific lad, that’s a god! A Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity and he actually slew Lord Fang Kun, truly remarkable.”

“A shame! This scheme that Young Master Yu came up with today, even if Ye Yuan knows that it’s a pit, he has to jump too! Unless, he doesn’t want to save Jiang Jadehall anymore.”

...

The matter of Ye Yuan causing a disturbance in Carefree Grove was no longer some secret long ago. It caused a huge stir in the city.

Curious folks naturally clawed out the whole sequence of events.

Originally, an insignificant patrolling inspector. But now, because of Ye Yuan’s trouble-making, the degree of focus was extremely high.

Today, so many people came, wanting to see whether Ye Yuan dared to come or not.

Yu Jinsong sat on the seat of honor with a relaxed look.

“Discovered Ye Yuan yet?” Yu Jinsong said to the protector behind him.

This Wang Hu was precisely the leader of the four great protectors who had once fought with Ye Yuan before.

Hearing Yu Jinsong’s question, Wang Hu shook his head and said, “Reporting to Young Master, didn’t discover traces. Young Master, we put on such a grand line-up, so he ... probably don’t dare to come, right?”

Yu Jinsong smiled and said, “This kid has been friends with Jiang Jadehall for several hundred years, their friendship very close. This time, for Jiang Jadehall’s sake, he barged into Carefree Grove alone and rescued Jiang Haitang. It can be seen how important he views Jiang Jadehall. Therefore, there’s no way he doesn’t come! You continue investigating. Once you discover his trace, don’t act rashly and alert the enemy. Tell me immediately.”

“Yes, Young Master.” Wang Hu received the order and left.

In order to capture Ye Yuan, Yu Jinsong laid down an inescapable net today.

Today, the city guards present were all elites among elites. Not only were their strengths formidable, but the power of their combined attacks were also extremely powerful.

Apart from this, he even brought a bunch of late-stage Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses, dispersed in all directions of the plaza.

The moment Ye Yuan appeared, this dense large web would directly pounce on Ye Yuan and kill him.

As for the three True God Realm powerhouses, they were also hidden in various areas of the plaza at this time.

Among these three True Gods, there were two First Firmament True God and one Second Firmament True God. It could be seen how highly he regarded Ye Yuan.

He had absolute confidence that as long as Ye Yuan dared to show face, he absolutely could not escape.

Suddenly, three figures barged into the execution ground.

When Yu Jinsong saw the arrivals, he could not help revealing a look of amusement. Getting up, he bowed and said, “Little Nephew Jinsong pays respect to Academy Head Fei!”

The person in front had a very powerful aura, he was actually a True God Realm powerhouse.

Bystanders did not know him, but Yu Jinsong naturally recognized him. He was called Fei Mingtian, one of Kongming Academy’s assistant academy heads.

Following behind Fei Mingtian were Flowing Wind Establishment’s establishment head Li Zian, and assistant establishment head, Song Yancai.

Fei Mingtian nodded his head and said, “Not seeing for several years, Honorable Nephew Yu’s realm improved considerably again!”

Yu Jinsong smiled and said, “Academy Head Fei is too kind! Little Nephew is currently carrying out the City Lord Manor’s law, I wonder what Academy Head Fei came for?”

Fei Mingtian’s face fell. Yu Jinsong’s words concealed a needle in wool, blocking him dead with one sentence.

Since Yu Jinsong dared to frame Jiang Jadehall, he naturally would not give people a handle and had long created sufficient ironclad proof.

Otherwise, the Kongming Academy would not go so far as to not make any noise at all.

Fei Mingtian said coolly, “Honorable Nephew Yu, Jiang Jadehall is at any rate from the Kongming Academy. Can you give our academy face and spare his life?”

Yu Jinsong laughed when he heard that and said, “Academy Head Fei’s words aren’t right! Although Jiang Jadehall originated from the Kongming Academy, he works in the City Lord Manor now. For so many years, the City Lord Manor also spent large amounts of cultivation resources on him, but he didn’t think to repay it, and actually assassinated me! This kind of person, if he isn’t sentenced to death according to the law, what will my City Lord Manor use to manage the Nine Pledge Imperial Capital?”

Fei Mingtian’s brows furrowed slightly, Yu Jinsong’s words were flawless, he could not find any words to refute at all.

Although Flowing Wind Establishment was the place where Kongming Academy managed imperial cities, it was too inferior to show in public.

On the surface, all of the imperial cities were under the City Lord Manor’s name.

“In that case, there’s no leeway to maneuver? If I were to forcefully bring him away?”

The imposing momentum on Fei Mingtian’s body gradually grew. Horrifying world power crushed over toward Yu Jinsong. Clearly, he was already angered.

But Yu Jinsong was completely fine as he said with a faint smile, “Academy Head Fei’s emotion, this lowly nephew naturally understands. It’s just that the law is the law, nobody can violate it, right? If Academy Head Fei were to really take action, I’m afraid that Lord Father will be making a move. Academy Head Fei wouldn’t think that Lord Father knows absolutely nothing about today’s matter, right?”

Fei Mingtian’s expression changed. Yu Jinsong’s father was naturally City Lord Yu Wenfeng, his strength unfathomable.

This punk actually used the city lord to threaten him!

Kongming Academy originally thought that by sending a True God powerhouse to act in capacity, Yu Jinsong should give face.

Who knew that Yu Jinsong’s attitude was actually so decisive.

Yu Jinsong looked at Fei Mingtian and said with a light smile, “Academy Head Fei, not that this lowly nephew isn’t giving face, but that the law beats everything! Kongming Academy is also a part of Nine Pledge Imperial Capital, producing such a treacherous traitor, shouldn’t Academy Head Fei observe the execution then?”
