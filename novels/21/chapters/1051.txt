Chapter 1055: Flattering Oneself

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing this scene, Jian Wushuang exploded all at once!

“Ji Qingyun, you despicable person! Our Heavenly Sword Sect is currently surrounding and suppressing the Seven Stars Miluo, but you actually sit idly and reap the fruits of others’ labor! Hand over the Seven Stars Miluo, and I’ll spare you from death!”

Ye Yuan said with an innocent look, “My great Young Master Jian, I saved your life. Do you treat your savior this way? This Seven Stars Miluo has already become a medicine spirit. With your strength, you can’t deal with it at all. If not for me taking it in, you’d already become a corpse now.”

Jian Wushuang was stifled. He was teetering on his feet just now and clearly could not hold on anymore already.

If those spurs were released for a while more, it would really be hard to say what the outcome would be.

But earlier, he saw Sword Thirteen and that Desolate Ancient Celestial Lion fight until the skies turned dark and the earth dimmed. He himself was already made dusty and dirty in appearance by this Seven Stars Miluo. But in the end, Ji Qingyun got off cheap. He could not accept this result at all.

“Bullsh*t! It was clearly you who stole my Seven Stars Miluo, and you’re still not admitting that you got off cheap here! Truly shameless to the extreme!” Jian Wushuang shouted fiercely.

Jian Wushuang felt like he was about to have a breakdown. Why was he nearly pricked to death by the Seven Stars Miluo, while this guy conveniently plucked it without extra trouble?

One had to know that Ye Yuan was merely First Level Dao Profound currently!

Ye Yuan was defeated by this guy’s shamelessness and could only say, “Alright then, alright, even if I stole your Seven Stars Miluo, what do you want to do to me then?”

Jian Wushuang was filled with righteous indignation and drew his longsword without even thinking about it and said, “Leave behind the Seven Stars Miluo, and I’ll spare you from death!”

Ye Yuan said with a doubtful look, “Really want me to leave it behind?”

“Rubbish! Are you leaving it or not?”

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “Fine, since you want it, giving it to you then.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Done talking, Ye Yuan directly threw the Seven Stars Miluo over.

Jian Wushuang could not help being thrilled when he saw the situation, and instinctively wanted to reach his hand out to go and catch.

This Seven Stars Miluo was too important to him. Without it, he would not be able to break through to the realm of Void Mystic!

But the next instant, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed drastically.

That Seven Stars Miluo breaking free of Ye Yuan’s palm immediately seemed to come to life. Spikes that covered the skies sprayed towards Jian Wushuang.

This time, Jian Wushuang was too close to it. There was no way to avoid it at all.

Right at this critical moment, several beams of swift and fierce sword light tore through the air and arrived.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.

The spurs were broken by the sword light one after another.

A figure arrived with a howl. Who could it be if not Sword Thirteen?

It was just that the Sword Thirteen at this time had holes everywhere on his body. His aura was also very chaotic, and there were even blackish-red bloodstains.

It looked like he had clearly just gone through a great battle.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Sword Thirteen’s expression darkened slightly, and he said, “Ji Qingyun, you dare to kill Wushuang? This is seeking death here!”

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “Are your Heavenly Sword Sect’s people all so unreasonable? I saved Jian Wushuang earlier. He insisted that I snatched his Seven Stars Miluo, and I returned the Seven Stars Miluo to him. You’re saying to kill me too.”

Sword Thirteen said with a cold snort, “Humph! Who in the Divine Realm doesn’t know that you and Wushuang are sworn enemies? Will you be so kind-hearted?”

Ye Yuan sighed and said, “That Jian Wushuang is flattering himself. He’s not qualified enough to be sworn enemies with me.”

Sword Thirteen could not help choking up when he heard that and wanted to speak up to refute, but could not find the words.

Ye Yuan was just elaborating a fact. Regardless of whether in his previous life or present life, Jian Wushuang was never an opponent in Ye Yuan’s eyes. It was Jian Wushuang’s wishful thinking on his own part, viewing Ye Yuan as his mortal foe.

Jian Wushuang provoked Ji Qingyun back then for Mu Lingxue. As a result, he was almost wasted by Ji Qingyun.

At that time, although they were both successors of two mighty super holy lands, the strength disparity between the two people was too great!

Even in this life, Ye Yuan wielded a divine artifact in his hand and even brought along a large group of Void Mystic powerhouses. There was no need to make a move at all to deal with Jian Wushuang.

Except, these words stomped Jian Wushuang’s pride into the earth in his ears. He roared, “Ji Qingyun, if you have the capabilities, don’t use the divine artifact! Let’s go one-on-one directly! With the likes of your current bit of strength, it isn’t even enough to fill the crevices between my teeth!”

The current Jian Wushuang had already utterly lost his reason.

He felt that Ye Yuan was simply a jinx sent down by heaven specifically to target him.

Yet, when Sword Thirteen heard these words, he wished that he could find a hole in the ground to tunnel into.

Fights between martial artists would never talk about making others use something, or not use something. A life-or-death battle, any item was a part of strength, inclusive of luck.

As long as one could beat their opponent, any means was not an issue.

Being able to obtain a divine artifact in itself was a part of Ye Yuan’s strength. How was there the logic of making people tie their two hands up?

Jian Wushuang saying this sort of words was an expression of yielding in itself already.

Who knew that after Ye Yuan heard, he said with a faint smile, “Is that so? Then you receive this move of mine and give it a shot!”

Jian Wushuang had yet to come back to his senses when a terrifying soul force already spread out. His divine soul instantly sunk into darkness.

When Jian Wushuang saw the situation, his expression could not help changing drastically: “Myriad Soul Extinction! You ... Your divine soul boundary already broke through to high-rank Alchemy Emperor?”

In this instant, Jian Wushuang suddenly felt like his divine soul had tendencies of going to collapse and dissipate. His entire person was in a listless and muddled state.

Back then, Ye Yuan used precisely this move to severely injure him. He did not expect that after reincarnating, Jian Wushuang still did not have the strength to retaliate under this move.

Alchemists were not completely powerless to retaliate against martial artists. If the alchemist’s divine soul mystic art was powerful enough, it was quite a headache for martial artists.

Like Ji Zhengyang, Old Man Han, this kind of existence, it was also just a flick of a finger for them to eradicate Void Mystic powerhouses whose strength were slightly weaker.

Unless martial artists were able to kill alchemists in an extremely short time or had a powerful divine soul defensive holy artifact, otherwise, there was only resigning themselves to fate.

“D-Don’t! I ... I admit defeat!” Jian Wushuang utterly crumbled.

Sword Thirteen did not intervene. He saw that Ye Yuan did not have killing intent. It was just that sensing Ye Yuan’s Myriad Soul Extinction, his expression was very ugly.

He also did not expect that after this reincarnation, Jian Wushuang still did not have the strength to retaliate in front of Ji Qingyun.

He did not blame Jian Wushuang. About Jian Wushuang’s talent, the Heavenly Sword Sect was already aware of it. Want to blame someone, they could only blame Ji Qingyun for being too powerful!

Being born in the same era as such a genius was simply a tragedy.

In a blink of an eye, the soul force retreated like tidewater. The pressure on Jian Wushuang’s divine soul lightened, then he gasped heavily for air.

He felt that he had already circled one round around the gates of hell and back.

Ye Yuan said to Sword Thirteen nonchalantly, “Although Jian Wushuang provoked me time and again, there isn’t deep-seated hatred between him and me. If I wanted to kill him, he’d have already died God knows how many times. Even if I really killed him back then, what can your Heavenly Sword Sect do to me? Even though he’s somewhat condescending, the offense doesn’t deserve death.”

Sword Thirteen knew that what Ye Yuan said was the truth. But he was also very unwilling to acknowledge this truth.

“Since you wanted to save him, why did you want to kill him with the Seven Stars Miluo again earlier?” Sword Thirteen said solemnly.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Just cracking a joke with him. Didn’t you come back? Would you watch him be killed before your eyes?”
