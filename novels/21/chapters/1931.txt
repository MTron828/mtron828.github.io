Chapter 1935: Challenging the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Heh, Hall Master Mu truly played a good hand!”

There was only Mu Feng and Ye Yuan left inside the hall. Ye Yuan looked at the other party and spoke those words with a cold smile.

Mu Feng smiled and said, “Little Friend Ye calm your anger, this matter was this Mu’s fault; hence, this Mu apologizes to you first.”

Ye Yuan drank a mouthful of tea and said coolly, “What mistake did Hall Master Mu do? I still have to thank Hall Master Mu.”

Mu Feng smiled and said, “I know that the other few hall masters have already come to find Little Friend Ye. Our Springwind Hall has also indeed offended you. But speaking of which, actually, the incident that Little Friend Ye encountered, it would likely have happened regardless of which hall. But our Springwind Hall is the most closely connected with Little Friend Ye. The obstacles will also be fewer when cooperating together, isn’t it so?”

This point, Ye Yuan was naturally well aware of it.

It was just that if it happened, it happened, there was no if.

If his strength was inadequate, wouldn’t he have died at Jiang Hua’s hands?

“Letting Xiao Feng assume the post of a protector is naturally looking on the account of Little Friend Ye’s face. But it’s also not entirely because so. I plan on having Xiao Feng reside in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City permanently, specifically be in charge of the matters of cooperation. Letting him be in charge of this matter is naturally the most suitable. I wonder what Little Friend Ye thinks about this?”

Hearing this, Ye Yuan could not help being moved.

Heavenly Eagle cooperating with Myriad Treasure Tower, no matter who was sent, all sorts of friction could not be avoided.

Each serving their own master, this was unavoidable.

But if this person was Xiao Feng, it was naturally a different matter.

Seeing that Ye Yuan was moved, Mu Feng smiled again and said, “Furthermore, Little Friend Ye and our Springwind Hall are deeply connected. That Xie Jingyi and Liang Wanru are also under my Springwind Hall’s name at present too. I’ve understood the situation, their talents are both pretty good, I plan on fetching them to the great imperial capital and heavily groom them.”

Ye Yuan looked at Mu Feng with a solemn look. Mu Feng still had a smile on his face.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan beamed and said, “Hall Master Mu’s terms make me unable to refuse!”

Ye Yuan had to admit that this Mu Feng was a formidable character.

Not that his martial prowess was very high, but he also grasped human nature rather accurately.

This fellow already had a clear insight of his personality!

The other various major forces all thought of using various kinds of superior terms to move him, but Mu Feng was different.

He discerned that Ye Yuan regarded the people around him very highly. His regard for his friends even surpassed his pursuit of benefits.

Otherwise, Ye Yuan also would not have flicked his sleeves and left at the Jiang Manor.

Ye Yuan was naturally displeased with Mu Feng acting first and reporting afterward, but he was happier for Xiao Feng.

At least with this identity, he could also straighten his back in the Springwind Hall.

Mu Feng also smiled and said, “Little Friend Ye, a pleasure to be working with you! You rest assured, I’ll give Xiao Feng the highest authority. Whatever spirit medicines Little Friend Ye requires, as long as our Springwind Hall can get them, everything can be discussed.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said smilingly, “Okay, let’s have a good cooperation!”

The darkviolet arena storm passed very quickly. What astonished everyone was that Ye Yuan actually chose to cooperate with the Springwind Hall in the end.

The various major forces could only sigh and lament.

But what everyone paid attention to more was just how far Ye Yuan could walk in the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion.

Entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion was not an easy thing.

For blackscale alchemists to want to enter the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, they had to defeat three Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders.

This difficulty was simply too great!

Alchemy celestial level powerhouses, each one was a Dao Realm powerhouse. The might of their Alchemy Dao strength, ordinary people could not imagine it at all.

People should not look at how Yu Ying was at the Dao Realm. In front of alchemy celestial level powerhouses, he completely could not stand up to the competition.

Everyone did not know the little interlude that happened at the Hundred Herb Gathering, so everyone also did not have a direct understanding of Ye Yuan’s strength.

In reality, even Chen Chang himself also did not know Ye Yuan’s limits.

The various major forces losing the cooperation, each and every one of them was deriving pleasure from other people’s misfortune, waiting to see Springwind Hall make a fool of themselves.

Time passed very quickly. In a twinkle, two months passed. Ye Yuan overcame all the difficulties along the way, rising from darkviolet to blackscale, and also obtained 30 straight wins in blackscale, finally obtaining the opportunity to challenge Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders.

The blackscale arena was different from the darkviolet arena, the number of blackscale level powerhouses was far fewer than darkviolet.

Furthermore, the strengths of blackscale level powerhouses were all the more closer. Wanting to obtain consecutive wins was doubly difficult in the first place.

But Ye Yuan still made a clean sweep along the way.

Even Yu Ying was instantly defeated in front of him, so how many could be his match?

Finally, the time to challenge Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders arrived.

On this day, there were streams of people.

The Alchemy Celestial Pavilion had 15 elders. Apart from two that were currently in terminal seclusion, the other 13 all turned up.

Quite a few came a long way from other places, for the sake of today’s challenge.

Chen Chang looked at Ye Yuan, a rueful look.

He did not expect that this day arrived so quickly.

Dealing with Ye Yuan, he had no confidence at all.

“Ye Yuan, you obtained the chance to challenge Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders. Now, you can choose the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders that you want to challenge,” Chen Yu looked at Ye Yuan and said.

Ye Yuan said, “Elder Chen Yu, Ye Yuan has a presumptuous request, wonder if the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion can permit it or not?”

Chen Yu was puzzled, but still nodded and said, “Let’s talk about it.”

Ye Yuan said, “The three elders that I want to challenge are respectively you, Master Chen Chang, as well as Master Xiao Zhen! I wonder if it’s allowed?”

The moment these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar.

“Is there a mistake? These three are the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s publicly recognized strongest three elders. Ye Yuan is actually going to challenge the three of them?”

“This guy is really a mad man!”

“Isn’t it said that persimmons have to pick soft ones to knead? He’s picking a stone to knead!”

...

Arriving at the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion for such a long time, Ye Yuan naturally had some understanding of the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders’ strength too.

The three people that he challenged were precisely the strongest three among the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s elders.

Xiao Zhen came from another great imperial capital. His Alchemy Dao strength was not the least bit inferior compared to Chen Chang too.

However, Chen Yu felt bitter in his heart. The thing that he did not wish to see the most still happened.

Other people challenging the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, that was all finding the weakest elders. But Ye Yuan failed to show restraint and directly challenged the three of them.

The most important thing was that he did not have any confidence in beating Ye Yuan.

The matter that Chen Chang spoke of, Chen Yu had long already known about it.

That level of divine-grade divine pill, he did not have confidence in refining it.

The three of them were all old fellows who had become famous for a million years. Ever since entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, they had never been defeated before.

But today, they encountered a troublesome target.

If they lost, it would also be embarrassing!

Either way, Ye Yuan entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion was already set in stone, how great would it be to challenge those weak ones?

Chen Yu nursed a bitter grudge in his heart.

“You naturally can! What about the thing you want to ask?” Although Chen Yu was not willing to confront Ye Yuan, at this time, he naturally could not say no.

Ye Yuan looked at Chen Yu and said with a solemn look, “What I want to say is, I want to challenge the three of you at the same time!”

Murmur!

With this, below burst into an even greater uproar.

Challenging the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s strongest three people at the same time, what kind of concept was this?
