Chapter 3064: Major Move!

Perspective of God!

Even Ye Yuan was also amazed by the Heaven scroll’s miraculousness.

He seemed to be standing above Heavenly Dao, overlooking all life.

Everything and everything was in his eyes.

At this time, every flower and blade of grass, every leaf and tree, even the slight movements of the wind, they were all in his sight.

“Transforming into heaven and feeling the changes of all life? No, not just all life in the world; even if it’s an object without life, one can feel it too! All things have their own spirit. So that’s how it is!” Ye Yuan said in shock.

“How is this possible! If that’s the Heaven scroll in your hands, then what’s that in Ancestor Endless’ hand?” Yang Qing still could not restrain the shock in his heart.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “That might be the Heaven scroll that Ancestor Heavenless copied! Although the aura of Dao is very rich, compared to this, it seems to still be lacking something.”

Yang Qing felt it carefully and said in surprise, “It’s true! But why would this thing be casually placed in a side hall? Doesn’t Ancestor Heavenless want it anymore?”

Ye Yuan said, “Ancestor Heavenless didn’t need this item since a long time ago, right? If this thing is useful to him, he would have long broken through the shackles and transcended the Great Beyond. How could he have been defeated by Hegemon Samsara? Even if it’s a Heavenly Dao treasure, each person has a limit to comprehend it too. It’s far too difficult to be equal with Heavenly Dao!”

Yang Qing thought about it and felt the same.

No matter how powerful the treasure, that would also have to depend on who obtained it.

When some people obtained it, they would directly soar to the heavens in one bound.

......

But some would have limited accomplishments.

It might even call down a disaster.

Treasures were not necessarily good things.

Ancestor Heavenless’ talent was the strongest among past generation palace masters. But he had his limits too.

Yang Qing said speechlessly, “Your luck is also too good, right? A group of Great Beyond powerhouses is fighting to the death below, but in the end, it’s a fake. You casually picked something up, and it’s actually the Heaven scroll that they yearn for even in their sleep? Do you still want people to live?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Hence, I’m someone with a great destiny! This is called when one man attains Dao, his fowls and dogs ascend to heaven too. You benefit immensely from following me by the side too!”

“Pooh!?You’re the chicken or dog!” Yang Qing said angrily. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Is that so? Then I’ll kick you out?”

“Don’t, don’t, don’t! This feeling is too magical; let me feel it more! I’m a chicken and dog! I’m a chicken and dog!”

… …

When Ye Yuan and Yang Qing were currently overlooking everything from the perspective of God, the situation below suddenly changed!

Boom!

Another surge of Great Dao aura rose to the sky.

A red-green jade scroll actually flew out from a Heavenly King Palace.

Ancestor Endless three people who were currently in the midst of fierce fighting, their expressions changed wildly!

“This is … Earth volume!” Ancestor Endless cried out in surprise.

Swoosh!

Hegemon Profound Ice grabbed toward the Earth scroll right away!

However, right at this time, the third Heavenly Dao painting flew out!

“The Universe volume! What medicine is Old Man Heavenless selling in his gourd?” Ancestor Endless’ expression became more and more ugly.

He instinctively felt that it was not right, but he also could not pinpoint what was not right.

The 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings appeared one after another. Faced with such a huge temptation, nobody could resist!

Following that, one Heavenly Dao Painting after another appeared!

Boom!

A massive energy directly sent Hegemon Profound Ice flying.

She failed to get the Earth scroll!

Boom!

The Heaven scroll in Ancestor Endless’ hand directly exploded, flying towards the sky!

Ancestor Endless’ expression was livid. After expending such a great effort, the Heaven scroll actually flew away!

Very soon, 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings were arranged in a sequence above the void.

Everyone looked at the sky in great shock.

Ancestor Heavenless really played a major hand!!

Without the slightest surprise, Ancestor Heavenless’ figure appeared above the void.

He looked at the Hegemons that filled the sky, his eyes revealing ruefulness.

Only to see him stand with his hands behind his back, his gaze landed on Ancestor Endless three people as he said coolly, “Endless, Ming Hui, Profound Ice, how have you been?”

Endless three people snorted coldly, but did not speak.

Ancestor Heavenless did not think anything of it too as he continued, saying, “This ancestor is just a dead man. No matter how many grudges in the past, it’s also transient as a floating cloud! The three of you betrayed me. This ancestor doesn’t blame you! Back then, it was this ancestor who was too anxious! However, the 33 Heavens are currently at a time of great crisis now. Once that blood race progenitor comes into being, his strength will probably be above this ancestor!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s expressions changed.

The crisis of the blood race was no longer some secret.

In fact, the blood race’s general direction was already formed; they are gaining momentum. These powerhouses could not help it either.

As long as they could protect themselves in this overall situation, that would suffice.

Ancestor Endless and the others naturally knew the danger of this trip, but they still came.

Most likely, they felt the pressure too.

“This ancestor was once the overlord of all the heavens. Today, the 33 Heavens are confronted with danger. This ancestor naturally has to do my part! Today, this ancestor will open up the Labyrinth Divine Palace and share the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings! Whichever among you can obtain the recognition of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings and become the strongest, you’ll be able to receive this ancestor’s origins enlightening you, inheriting all of this ancestor’s strength! Now, start comprehending Dao!”

Ancestor Heavenless said it neither too fast nor too slow, but each word stirred people’s hearts.

Inherit all of Ancestor Heavenless’ strength; this allure was seriously too great!

“Inherit all of Ancestor Heavenless’ strength! My God, doesn’t that mean that a second Ancestor Heavenless will appear?”

“I heard that Ancestor Heavenless’ strength is not the slightest bit worse than Hegemon Samsara! If I can become the second Heavenless, then who in all the heavens and myriad worlds can still post a threat to me?”

“Too crazy! This trip really wasn’t in vain! This time, I definitely won’t lose to Ye Yuan!”

… …

The group of geniuses went completely crazy.

Ancestor Heavenless was synonymous with supremacy.

Although he had long fallen, he was absolutely a legend.

His awe-inspiring reputation was not the least bit weaker than Hegemon Samsara’s.

His mantle drove people too crazy!

Hence, how could the group of geniuses still care about searching for treasures? Each and every one of them wished to burrow into the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings.

Above the void, the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings each emitted a different aura.

As if a complete Heavenly Dao was displayed in front of everyone.

Heaven scroll; clouds rolled and smoothened out, the sun, moon, and stars changing unpredictably!

Earth scroll; the atmosphere was deep, mountains and rivers could carry everything!

Universe scroll; space flowed, all the heaven and earth were inside it!

Aeon scroll, with a distant source and a long stream, however much time elapsed with the wind!

… …

12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, what it brought to everyone was endless shock!

As if all the truths in heaven and earth were all within these 12 painting scrolls.

“So that’s how it is! So that’s how it is!?Hahaha?… 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, it indeed lives up to its reputation! I’ve comprehended!”

Kong Tan suddenly let out a loud laugh, the Door of Eternal Life appearing behind him.

He, a middle Emperor Sakra Heaven, actually skyrocketed in aura, heading straight for grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven.

Everyone was in great shock.

“He … Is he going to directly assault Hegemon Realm? Well-deserving of being the fiend race’s number one genius, this comprehension ability really surpasses ancient and modern times!”

“This time, Ye Yuan is finally beaten!”

“That Yang Qing too. He can’t be unconvinced this time even if he wants to! Once Kong Tan enters Hegemon, he won’t let him off!”

… …
