Chapter 2494: Breaking the Deadlock!

Puu, puu, puu!

It was also at this moment that Ye Yuan flicked his fingers repeatedly.

Three streaks of sword energy penetrated into the three people’s bodies respectively.

Following that, his divine essence did the leading. A powerful suction force swept Pang Zhen and Wan Zhen over.

All of these were completed in the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint. Clearly, Ye Yuan had long already made a plan. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Only all the way until this time did the water rule crystal land on the ground quietly.

The change was too fast. Apart from Ye Yuan himself, everyone did not react to it.

Even Pang Zhen and Wan Zhen themselves were also dumbfounded at this moment.

Zhang Zhen was utterly dumbfounded by the side.

He did not understand why Lin Chaotian did not make a move to stop it.

With Lin Chaotian’s strength, he could definitely make it in time.

But at this time, Lin Chaotian shook his head suddenly, only to feel a stabbing pain in his divine soul.

He was taken aback, recovering to his senses.

Divine soul attack!

He could not help looking towards Ye Yuan and discovered that the people were actually all rescued, and his pupils could not help shrinking.

“DIE!”

His thoughts stirred, and he was going to detonate the wood spirit divine essence within Pang Zhen’s body.

However, Pang Zhen did not even move, not even an eyelid!

Lin Chaotian’s heart thumped, being taken by surprise, and secretly thought that it was not good.

How was this possible?

His wood spirit divine essence was resolved so quickly?

Ye Yuan’s means were also too heaven-defying, right?

But currently, Ye Yuan’s pair of icy-cold eyes were currently looking over toward this side.

“No need to try! Your wood spirit divine essence has already been sealed by my sword energy. You can’t detonate it!” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

Lin Chaotian had a look of shock on his face and said, “This is impossible! How can you possibly do it within such a short time?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Nothing is impossible! My law comprehensions are inferior to yours, but you’re far worse in quality of divine essence! You think that I suffered so many palms of yours in vain?”

Lin Chaotian’s expression changed wildly and he said in a solemn voice, “You … What on earth did you do?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “That mouthful of blood essence was tainted with my chaos origin divinity in it! I handed a rule crystal over to you just to exchange one person over, it didn’t matter who. As long as someone comes over, I’ll naturally have a way of stopping you from making a move. So when I tossed out the second rule crystal, the chaos origin divinity turned into a soul sword and sneak attacked your divine soul, making you absent-minded temporarily. And this period of time is enough for me to inject sword energy into their bodies.”

Everyone present was stunned from listening.

This … This was also too monstrous!

Within such a short time, Ye Yuan actually thought of such a meticulous method, it was truly inconceivable!

Everyone thought that Ye Yuan was hesitating to take action out of fear of damages, not daring to fight back.

Who could have thought that Ye Yuan was actually making concessions in order to gain advantages, concealing his means!

Everyone thought that Ye Yuan had no choice but to hand over the rule crystals.

Who could have thought that he was actually trying to grasp Lin Chaotian’s method!

From start to end, Lin Chaotian thought that he held absolute dominance, thinking that it was absolutely impossible for Ye Yuan to make a comeback.

But Ye Yuan led the direction of the whole thing without him noticing it!

By the time Lin Chaotian reacted, the situation had already completely reversed!

Advancing gradually and entrenching himself at every step!

Incredibly meticulous!

Bizarre means!

Lin Chaotian only felt that he was battling in magic with a monster, losing so thoroughly.

This move was set up by him painstakingly over many years.

Each detail involved, he took it into consideration.

Ye Yuan was completely dealing with it passively.

However, it was under such a passive situation that Ye Yuan thought of a solution so quickly.

And reverse-schemed against Lin Chaotian, succeeding in breaking the deadlock!

This sort of cunningness, this kind of means, it was truly undefeatable!

Talking about this soul sword again, it was a utilization method of the chaos origin divinity that Ye Yuan found out.

With regards to the chaos origin divinity, Ye Yuan understood too little.

But its might was beyond all doubt.

So, these few years, Ye Yuan had always been trying to unearth some of the chaos origin divinity’s functions.

This origin divinity decomposition technique was one of the methods that Ye Yuan found out!

Lin Chaotian this kind of old monster who had lived for so many years. His divine soul had long already reached the extreme.

Although Ye Yuan’s chaos origin divinity was powerful, wanting to attack this level of powerhouse head-on, it was clearly rather inadequate.

After all, nobody was a fool. Lin Chaotian knew that Ye Yuan’s origin divinity was powerful, how could he possibly not take precautions?

But, decomposing the origin divinity and hiding it in blood essence, incubating within Lin Chaotian’s body to suddenly launch a sneak attack, it was absolutely impossible for him to guard against.

Sure enough, Lin Chaotian fell for it!

He thought that Ye Yuan just spat in anger.

But he did not know that failure was already destined at that time!

Lin Chaotian opened his eyes wide. Until now, he still did not quite dare to believe it.

He never planned on handing over the hostages to Ye Yuan at all!

Just now, he planned to directly detonate the wood spirit divine essence and kill Profound Secrets and Wan Zhen.

As for Pang Zhen, as long as he was around, Ye Yuan would not dare to be unbridled.

He had determined Ye Yuan’s weakness, that was why there was the scheme this time.

But, before he made his move, the hostages were already rescued.

“You … You’re really a monster!” Lin Chaotian only felt a chill run down his spine. This fellow in front of him was really too scary!

Ye Yuan’s eyes gradually grew cold and he said, “Is that so? Including chatting so much with you just now, my injuries have already recovered by 50% too! Now, you can go to hell!”

Boom!

His voice had yet to fade when Universe was already unleashed!

Lin Chaotian’s expression changed wildly, turning around and fleeing with a whoosh, merging into that main road.

Ye Yuan did not pursue, but he bent down and stuffed a medicinal pill each for the three of them.

Then he healed their injuries for them.

Profound Secrets three people were too heavily injured. Furthermore, Lin Chaotian’s wood spirit divine essence was also just temporarily suppressed.

If it was not removed in time, there was a danger to their lives.

“Your Excellency, i-ignore us! Go and kill that damn dog! Having obtained the fire rule crystals, he’ll definitely refine it right away! If you wait for him to refine it, he’ll be even harder to deal with!” Pang Zhen gritted his teeth and said.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Shut up!”

Pang Zhen was helpless and could only shut up.

But in his heart, a warm current was flowing through.

This was a brother; no need for more words.

Lin Chaotian left, but Zhang Zhen did not.

This sudden change rendered his entire person stupefied.

He did not expect that Lin Chaotian actually did not even fight, directly slipping away.

He was left alone, what to do?

His gaze landed on the water rule crystal not far away.

Greed overflowed from his eyes.

But he just had the thought of moving when Ye Yuan’s devilish voice came over.

“If I were you, I’d stand there obediently and not think about anything. The more you think, the faster you’ll die!”

Zhang Zhen’s entire body shook, his eyes full of unwillingness.

Swoosh!

He still moved!

The temptation of Dao Ancestor was too great!

Furthermore, it was death either way. So why not risk his life?

Zhang Zhen’s speed was extremely fast. In a breath, he arrived in front of the water rule crystal.

His gaze revealed a look of wild ecstasy.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan was scaring him.

How could the wood-attribute divine essence that Dao Ancestor Life left behind be that easy to remove?

However, just as his hand was about to touch the water rule crystal, a streak of cold light flashed past.

Pffft!

His hands were directly gone!
