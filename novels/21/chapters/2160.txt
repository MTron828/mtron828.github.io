Chapter 2164: A Thousand Years Later

“I ... I’m not going! What’s good about the Heavenly Dragon Mountain? It’s like a cage!” Long Xiaochun said unwillingly.

Everyone was rendered speechless. Everyone wanted to go up Heavenly Dragon Mountain even in their dreams, this little girl was actually not willing!

She should not make fun of people like this!

Morningstar pulled a long face and said, “This is your fate! No matter whether you’re willing or not, you have to accept this arrangement. A great era is about to arrive. Only by possessing sufficient strength, can one survive, and can our Dragon Clan last!”

Long Xiaochun’s head shook like a rattle drum, and she said, “I don’t want means I don’t want! I still want to follow Ye Yuan and roam the Heavenspan World!”

Long Xiaochun threw a tantrum, giving Morningstar a headache.

Ye Yuan was rather surprised though. He did not expect that this little girl actually already made up her mind to go out with him.

One should not look at how Long Xiaochun was normally happy-go-lucky Once this lass decided on something, even nine Heavenly Dragons could not pull her back either.

But in this aspect, this girl was rather similar to him. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Morningstar glared, the sullen rage of a Heavenly Dragon quietly erupted. Everyone present felt tremendous pressure and could not help prostrating even lower.

That was the pressure originating from the bloodline!

“Time waits for no man! Lass, if you still don’t enter the Heavenly Dragon Mountain this time, this emperor will be forcefully bringing you up.”

Long Xiaochun’s stubborn temper flared up too, and she said angrily, “Grandpa Morningstar, if you dare to forcefully bring me up, I’ll cry every day for you to see!”

Morningstar’s face turned black. Thinking about this girl’s destructive power, the corners of his mouth could not help twitching.

Of course, although this destructive power was not to the extent of causing any damage to Heavenly Dragon Mountain, sending it into a tizzy could not be avoided.

Morningstar immediately felt his head swell. He looked at Long Xiaochun and billowed his beard as he glared and actually did not know what he should do for some time.

The Sons of the Heavenly Dragon present were all incomparably shocked in their hearts.

They were still curious previously. Long Xiaochun did not have a Heavenly Dragon Mark. So why would she come to the Battle of Dragon Sons.

Looking at it now, Long Xiaochun’s identity was extraordinary!

They could all tell that even though Morningstar was angered until he was billowing his beard and glaring, he had a kind of unspeakable doting toward Long Xiaochun.

It seemed like Long Xiaochun was the Dragon Clan’s future!

While they, these Sons of the Heavenly Dragon, were merely dregs.

“You ... You lass, angering this emperor to death!” Morningstar nearly jumped up.

Seeing Morningstar’s appearance, Long Xiaochun felt pleased with herself.

Either way, she did not want to go up the Heavenly Dragon Mountain and also did not want to cultivate.

“Senior Morningstar, let me try!” Ye Yuan suddenly spoke up.

Morningstar gave him a glance, shook his head, and said, “It’s no use! This lass, even her mother can’t put her in place.”

While Long Xiaochun looked at Ye Yuan vigilantly and said, “Ye Yuan, just whose side are you standing on? No need to urge me! Either way, I won’t go up Heavenly Dragon Mountain!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Girlie, with my talent, how big do you think that gap between you and me will be after a thousand years?”

Long Xiaochun was taken aback, she really never considered this problem before.

But the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon by the side, each and every one of them revealed disdainful looks.

“This guy is really cocky!”

“A thousand years time, how big a gap can there be?”

Ao Yu knew more than the others and said with a cold smile, “Long Xiaochun’s cultivation talent is extremely high. She would also have a middle-stage Empyrean cultivation no matter what after a thousand years! Could it be that he can cultivate to the late-stage Empyrean Realm?”

Saying that Ye Yuan could cultivate to the late-stage Empyrean Realm a thousand years later, he did not believe it even if beaten to death.

The Sons of the Heavenly Dragon present, each one was a genius in cultivation, who could be lousier than Ye Yuan?

Even they did not dare talk about how it would be like a thousand years later.

What basis did this brat have?

However, Long Xiaochun held her head in her hand and pondered for a while, and said seriously, “A thousand years later, you can probably kill me by puffing out a breath ...”

“W-What?”

Ao Yu somewhat doubted his own ears. The other Sons of the Heavenly Dragon’s faces also had stunned looks.

They all, these Sons of the Heavenly Dragon, were all very close in strength.

A thousand years, a distinction could not be made at all.

But Long Xiaochun said that a thousand years later, he would be able to kill her by puffing out a breath!

This kind of thing was very easy to understand when place on geniuses and mortals.

But between geniuses, it was simply a fantasy tale.

Indignance!

Displeasure!

Disdain!

Many emotions interwoved together, making the atmosphere on the platform became strange.

Even Morningstar’s pupils also constricted slightly. His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan became different.

Others did not understand, but Long Xiaochun herself understood it very well. This appraisal was not over the top.

It might even be low!

How much time had passed since she met Ye Yuan in the Westspirit Region?

Ye Yuan’s realm and strength soared by more than one or two levels!

When she first met Ye Yuan, Long Xiaochun could blast Ye Yuan to death with one punch.

But now, she was already far from Ye Yuan’s match.

A thousand years later ... only ghosts knew what kind of realm Ye Yuan would reach!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “At that time, even if I bring you by my side, will ... you follow me by my side?”

Long Xiaochun blinked twice and shook her head and said, “No!”

Ye Yuan said, “Moreover, a turbulent era is arriving. Nobody can escape by sheer luck as well. Your mother, your clansmen, all of them getting caught in the fires of war. You will need power to protect them. Only then did you discover that you don’t have that strength; will you be in despair?”

Ye Yuan let out a heavy sigh and said, “I ... have once experienced this kind of powerless moment. Hence, I have to continuously become strong, become strong until no one can surpass me! Only when you grasp true power can you truly be free and unfettered in this world.”

“Alright, alright! I got it! I’ll go up Heavenly Dragon Mountain!” Long Xiaochun pursed her mouth and said unwillingly.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Cultivate well. In the future, you and I, brother and sister, join hands and roam the world unmatched!”

Cocky!

Too cocky!

Who the hell are you, still roam the world unmatched!

The group of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon was already ticked off by the side.

If not for Morningstar being by the side, they would likely have joined hands to cripple Ye Yuan.

Aren’t you unmatched? I’ll make you unmatched!

But these Sons of the Heavenly Dragon’s anger was already completely stoked.

Everyone’s gazes were gathered on Ye Yuan, treating him as their enemy.

Long Xiaochun looked at Ye Yuan and said, “That’s what you said! When I have achievements in cultivation, you have to bring me to the Heavenspan World to play!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Relax, I, Ye Yuan, am a man of my word!”

When Morningstar saw this scene, he could not help having a stupefied look on his face.

Heavenly Dragon Mountain had thought of no idea how many ways to make Long Xiaochun go up the mountain.

Using both soft and hard tactics, adopting every possible means.

But this lass was impervious to everything and refused to go up the mountain no matter what.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan convinced this girl with a few words.

Morningstar looked at Ye Yuan, his interest in him growing stronger.

His earlier attitude toward Ye Yuan was naturally because he was different from the rest.

Heavenly Dragon Mark was automatically formed when the Dragon Mark Monument sensed the bloodline power of the various strongholds’ junior generation.

But Ye Yuan’s Heavenly Dragon Mark was engraved on the Dragon Mark Monument artificially!

This showed that there was definitely a major power in the clan who bestowed upon Ye Yuan the Heavenly Dragon Mark!
