Chapter 2275: My Dad is a Heavenly Emperor!

“Ye Yuan, I don’t know how strong you are right now. But he isn’t someone you can afford to provoke! Quickly leave, don’t worry about my affairs!”

Old Drunkard finally recovered from the shock. But his first reaction was to have Ye Yuan hurry up and leave.

Because Tang Yucheng’s status was high, Ye Yuan could not afford to provoke him at all.

He tried to push Ye Yuan out, but he discovered that he could not budge him at all.

Tang Yucheng slowly got up, came before Ye Yuan, and said with a light smile, “Punk, do you know why he’s so scared of me?”

Ye Yuan said rather interestedly, “Oh? Why?”

“Because ... I’m the son of a Heavenly Emperor!” When he said this, Tang Yucheng had a smug look. Clearly, he felt very proud of this identity.

“My father is Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain. The 30 million miles area at the foot of the Heavenspan Mountain is all under my father’s jurisdiction! Therefore, do you know what’s the outcome of you offending me?” Tang Yucheng’s face was almost planted in front of Ye Yuan’s, a proud look on his face.

Ye Yuan revealed a guileless smile and said, “What outcome I have, I really don’t know, but ... I know your outcome.”

Rumble!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s aura billowed to the sky. The terrifying pressure directly sent the guardian manor flying.

Tang Yucheng was caught off-guard and directly overwhelmed until he knelt on the ground by this horrifying pressure.

Those True God Realm guards were directly crushed into meat pancakes.

The few remaining Empyrean Realms were crushed until they lay prone on the ground, unable to even move an inch.

Ye Yuan’s pressure carried a strong power.

If he intentionally released it, it was not what these initial-stage Empyreans could resist at all.

Old Drunkard’s heart shook wildly, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of disbelief.

He never even dared to dream that in a short 2000 years’ time, Ye Yuan’s strength actually turned out to be so terrifying.

He had not made a move yet and directly pressed the Empyrean Realm powerhouses unable to move on the ground.

How formidable a strength did this need?

He previously still thought that Ye Yuan was here to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm.

Thinking about it, it was simply a joke.

He could clearly feel that Ye Yuan’s current strength was likely even stronger than the Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove back then!

How was this possible?

Just 2000 years!

In just 2000 years, from a rookie who could not even break through to be a Divine Lord, growing into a peak Empyrean sovereign?

He suddenly somewhat understood the meaning of those words that Dustless said back then.

Lord Immortal Grove’s successor was truly incredible!

It was just that ... behind Tang Yucheng was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

Under the heavy pressure, Tang Yucheng had a contorted look on his face. Gritting his teeth, he bellowed, “You dare to touch me?! You dare to touch me?! My dad is a Heavenly Emperor! You’re dead! You’re dead!”

Tang Yucheng himself was an Empyrean powerhouse too. But he was weak like a three-year-old child in front of Ye Yuan.

Old Drunkard was also shocked and said, “Ye Yuan, quickly go! Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain dotes on this son immensely. If he knows that you made a move against Tang Yucheng, he won’t let you off! My affairs, I don’t need you to care!”

He was not afraid of dying himself, but he was afraid to implicate Ye Yuan.

Even if Ye Yuan was currently peak Empyrean, it was also impossible to be a Heavenly Emperor’s match.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m going to intervene in your affairs!”

Clank!

The sounds of swords clanging sounded out, a dozen over swords sword energy around Tang Yucheng, the sword energy threatening.

Ye Yuan rapped on Tang Yucheng’s head and said, “Come, repeat your words just now again.”

Sensing the chilly air coming from the tip of the swords, Tang Yucheng’s face changed wildly and he hurriedly shook his head and said, “I ... I don’t dare anymore! Y-Your Excellency, I don’t dare anymore!”

“Then tell me now, did Lin Xiu deserve to die or not?”

“Deserved it! Deserved to die! He courted death himself! It’s not Old Drunkard’s fault! Really, really, I don’t blame Old Drunkard at all! He’s my cousin, when my aunt heard that he died, she was extremely enraged. That’s why I had no choice but to find trouble with Old Drunkard. Actually, I admonish his actions and behavior a lot too!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Like this huh! In that case, you’re a good guy?”

“A good guy! I’m really a good guy!”

Ye Yuan seemed very satisfied with Tang Yucheng’s answer. Patting his shoulder twice, he smiled lightly and said, “Since you’re a good guy, then I’ve wrong you. You can go.”

Tang Yucheng was akin to being granted amnesty, scrambling out in a panic.

But Old Drunkard’s face changed and he said, “Ye Yuan, can’t let him go! You believe in this sort of nonsense too?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Yeah, why wouldn’t I believe?”

Old Drunkard had an appearance like he expected better of him and gritted his teeth and said, “This brat is a silkpants. After you humiliated him like this, he’ll definitely go and tell Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain to come and kill you after he returns! Quickly leave, it will be too late otherwise!”

In his view, even though Ye Yuan’s talent was terrifying, he was too young and believed in people too easily.

He was somewhat perplexed. With this kind of personality, how did he survive until now?

But Ye Yuan avoided the topic and said with a smile, “What plans does Senior Drunkard have in the future?”

Old Drunkard’s expression turned stiff and he said with a bitter smile, “What plans can I still have? Us guardians all have a wisp of divine soul imprint in the hands of Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain. Even if I run to the ends of the world, I can’t escape his pursuit either. Rather, it’s you, it will be too late if you still don’t go! Hurry up and leave!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Like this huh? Then just nice. After Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain arrives, I’ll have a good talk with him and take back your divine soul imprint.”

Old Drunkard was anxious until he almost wanted to jump up. This guy really would not shed tears without seeing the coffin!

Were Heavenly Emperors whom you could reason things out with?

But if Ye Yuan did not leave, he really could not do anything about it.

Ye Yuan’s present strength already made him unable to influence the former.

He tried his best to persuade Ye Yuan to leave, but Ye Yuan just refused to go.

It was not that Ye Yuan was deliberately hiding from Old Drunkard, but that if he said that he could deal with Heavenly Emperors, Old Drunkard would not believe it either.

Ye Yuan helped Old Drunkard heal his wounds and took out a Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill for Old Drunkard.

Old Drunkard was shocked speechless. After consuming this Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill, he broke through to the Empyrean Realm without any surprise.

This step had blocked him for hundreds of thousands of years.

He thought that he could not take this step for life. He did not expect that Ye Yuan resolved it with a medicinal pill.

But not long after he broke through, Tang Yucheng led a large contingent of troops over.

A pair of husband and wife slowly walked out, looking at Ye Yuan coldly.

Old Drunkard’s expression changed wildly and he cried out in shock, “Even Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance came as well! I asked you to go, but you refused to leave! Now, you can’t leave even if you want to!”

As he said, Old Drunkard revealed a hint of a bitter smile.

This couple was precisely Tang Yucheng’s father and mother. They were Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain and Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance!

These two were both First Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

“Hahaha ... you fool, you’re actually really still here! Father, Mother, it’s this punk who almost killed me! You have to avenge me!” Tang Yucheng said sobbingly.

Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance felt her heart ached and hurriedly consoled, “Cheng-er, don’t cry! Mother’s heart hurts! Don’t you worry, Mother will definitely cut this punk into little pieces and avenge you!”

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain’s brows furrowed and he looked at Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice, “Brat, it’s you who made a move against Cheng-er and even killed this Heavenly Emperor’s subordinates?”
